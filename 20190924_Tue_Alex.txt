[00:00.000 --> 00:16.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.760 --> 00:25.000]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[00:25.000 --> 00:31.160]  if you're under 40 you might be surprised to learn that people didn't use to express
[00:31.160 --> 00:37.200]  concern about the environment by littering that used to seem weird but then the point
[00:37.200 --> 00:42.840]  of environmentalism used to be about nature and preserving and protecting it the point
[00:42.840 --> 00:48.200]  now is very different the point now is political power you gin up a crisis and you demand the
[00:48.200 --> 00:53.520]  population submits to your will or else and as you do that of course you don't need to
[00:53.520 --> 00:58.520]  fight fair or acknowledge democracy or if you make a rational case for your position you do
[00:58.520 --> 01:04.720]  whatever it takes you'll even use children if it helps just today for example a 16 year old
[01:04.720 --> 01:09.880]  Swedish girl addressed the United Nations at the behest of climate activists here's part of what
[01:09.880 --> 01:19.040]  she said this is all wrong I shouldn't be up here I should be back in school on the other side
[01:19.040 --> 01:29.880]  of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope how dare you you have stolen my dreams
[01:29.880 --> 01:37.600]  my childhood with your empty words we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you
[01:37.600 --> 01:45.160]  can talk about is the money and fairytales of eternal economic growth how dare you if you
[01:45.160 --> 01:52.560]  really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act then you would be evil and that
[01:52.560 --> 02:02.280]  I refuse to believe you stole my childhood do what I want you to do or else you're evil how do
[02:02.280 --> 02:08.080]  you respond to statements like that the truth is you can't respond and of course that's the point
[02:08.080 --> 02:14.680]  when you use children to demand power they become a kind of human shield you can hide safely behind
[02:14.680 --> 02:21.000]  them no one can criticize you but who would do something that unscrupulous anyone who would
[02:21.000 --> 02:27.400]  do that is someone who would literally do anything to seize control well that's very
[02:27.400 --> 02:33.640]  well said ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this September 24th 2019 global
[02:33.640 --> 02:41.080]  broadcast I am your host Alex Jones and we're gonna be here live for the next four hours now
[02:41.080 --> 02:48.720]  Greta Thunberg is super annoying she's autistic on record her parents are Antifa globalist she's
[02:48.720 --> 02:53.240]  openly funded by George Soros we're going to document all that after the break but you really
[02:53.240 --> 02:59.320]  cannot get away from the historical parallels of a German youth lecturing the world on how
[02:59.320 --> 03:04.680]  they better behave at the behest of powerful organizations and institutions that seek to
[03:04.680 --> 03:10.720]  take full control of the infrastructure of the planet and have AI computers watch every activity
[03:10.720 --> 03:23.360]  that we engage in on this earth this whole carbon tax program is about a societal takeover of the
[03:23.360 --> 03:29.960]  civilization that's really what it comes down to at the end of the day and it's extremely dangerous
[03:29.960 --> 03:36.920]  and they know that they can't brainwash and convince adults to submit to all of this and so
[03:36.920 --> 03:44.600]  now they're simply moving forward taking action against the children a classical authoritarian
[03:44.600 --> 03:52.000]  move that is done over and over and over again throughout history so I put together last night
[03:52.000 --> 04:01.560]  a powerful report I think where I look at this from the perspective of somebody like Bill Gates
[04:01.560 --> 04:05.520]  and where you can also look at it from the perspective of the globalist what we're trying
[04:05.520 --> 04:12.760]  to do we're gonna be airing that later but first my breakdown of redda thunberg on the other side

[06:12.800 --> 06:38.400]  it's Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen we're broadcasting worldwide I am your host Alex Jones
[06:38.400 --> 06:47.880]  it is September 24 2019 on this Tuesday transmission we are seeing really classical
[06:47.880 --> 06:57.600]  tyranny the way it shows up every time in history over and over and over again using the youth
[06:57.600 --> 07:05.680]  against the population targeting the parents and the culture and the system with a group of hyped
[07:05.680 --> 07:14.000]  up angry vicious youth demanding revolution and overthrow society now the youth get brainwashed
[07:14.000 --> 07:18.840]  and frightened by a crisis when they're five six seven eight nine ten years old then they're put
[07:18.840 --> 07:26.920]  into action in youth programs to be the arbiters and the initiates and the igniters of change
[07:26.920 --> 07:34.600]  and by the time they're 16 they're then turned into paramilitary police units if you remember
[07:34.600 --> 07:44.240]  Barack Obama back when he was first running for office in 2007 2008 said that they were going to
[07:44.240 --> 07:49.200]  create a domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military and he did
[07:49.200 --> 07:55.280]  indeed set up his Obama Corp of youth that want to take the guns and want to global carbon tax
[07:55.280 --> 08:01.080]  and want to get rid of our borders that then metastasized into the ranks of Antifa that had
[08:01.080 --> 08:07.280]  been set up by communists in the 1970s so this is really their authoritarian move to bully all of
[08:07.280 --> 08:13.120]  us now there are popular billboards and bumper stickers all over Germany saying F Greta Thunberg
[08:13.120 --> 08:21.640]  she is an autistic young lady who has been abused who has been brainwashed they admit this by her
[08:21.640 --> 08:29.720]  antifa controllers and she's out there saying how dare you kill all these people how dare you not
[08:29.720 --> 08:34.920]  let us have carbon taxes how dare you not let us take control of all of civilization and the
[08:34.920 --> 08:41.280]  question for her should be this we should write an article say questions for Greta Thunberg ten
[08:41.280 --> 08:48.880]  questions like Martin Luther put on the church door why does China India 160 plus other countries
[08:48.880 --> 08:53.240]  have to make zero carbon cuts but only Western countries do and why are there all these big
[08:53.240 --> 08:59.080]  banks and hedge funds that have been promoting this and lobbying for this who will sell you the
[08:59.080 --> 09:04.280]  carbon credits and make literally trillions of dollars a day the currency market has trillions
[09:04.280 --> 09:09.240]  traded this is trillions once they get it set up a day and the surveillance over every aspect of
[09:09.240 --> 09:14.680]  life and then all the studies show it would kill billions of people to get rid of fossil fuels
[09:14.680 --> 09:20.160]  they've not found replacements and they've blocked other clean energies let's go to this special
[09:20.160 --> 09:32.240]  report that's on info wars dot com please share this report because he's channeling Hitler people
[09:32.240 --> 09:39.440]  are dying people are dying this is serious already there are people who are dying from results of
[09:39.440 --> 09:44.160]  climate change in 80 years there could be a mass extinction event it's a crisis that could at its
[09:44.160 --> 09:51.040]  worst lead to extinction and we only really recently happened to 12 years to stop it we will die
[09:51.040 --> 09:56.240]  i'm sure of it the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change entire
[09:56.240 --> 10:07.760]  ecosystems are collapsing we are in the beginning of a mass extinction more than 70 years ago
[10:07.760 --> 10:13.440]  adolf hitler cryptically stated first you get the women then you've got the children
[10:13.440 --> 10:20.880]  so follow the man i shouldn't be up here i should be back in school on the other side
[10:20.880 --> 10:31.840]  of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope how dare you this is child abuse you have
[10:31.840 --> 10:39.440]  stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words yet i'm one of the lucky ones
[10:39.440 --> 10:47.520]  gretta thunberg is a victim gretta thunberg is autistic she has ass burgers and like so many
[10:47.520 --> 10:53.280]  other children in history who've been handicapped she's been taken advantage of by her auntie for
[10:53.280 --> 11:00.320]  parents and by the left and she's a symbol of how the children across the west are brainwashed and
[11:00.320 --> 11:05.440]  told that they're killing the earth and killing animals that are being taught to hate themselves
[11:05.440 --> 11:11.600]  well now the world has been shocked by a video that just came out today where she is showing
[11:11.600 --> 11:19.680]  hitlerian hatred and arrogance towards everyone that haven't accepted her list of political demands
[11:20.240 --> 11:27.600]  which would kill billions of people and shut down the west people are suffering people are dying
[11:27.600 --> 11:35.440]  and entire ecosystems are collapsing we are in the beginning of a mass extinction
[11:35.440 --> 11:42.960]  she wants all carbon all gas all coal to be shut down she wants only countries like china
[11:42.960 --> 11:48.560]  india and others even be able to operate the popular idea of cutting our emissions in half
[11:48.560 --> 11:56.320]  in 10 years only gives us a 50 chance of staying below 1.5 degrees and the risk of setting up
[11:56.320 --> 12:03.120]  irreversible chain reactions beyond human control this is economic warfare by the globalist and the
[12:03.120 --> 12:08.720]  very hollywood scum that flies around all these private jets that lecture us that we shouldn't
[12:08.720 --> 12:14.240]  have a lifestyle at all are the very ones that exempt themselves from the rules they're foisting
[12:14.240 --> 12:20.560]  upon us the studies are conclusive and they are legion if you cut carbon on this planet if you
[12:20.560 --> 12:26.800]  take fossil fuels away civilization will collapse billions will die and we will return to the stone
[12:26.800 --> 12:36.240]  age the world is waking up and change is coming whether you like it or not we'll be watching you
[12:36.240 --> 12:42.160]  we are watching you she says whether it was under hitler amount say tongue there's nothing more
[12:42.160 --> 12:48.800]  dangerous than the youth whipped up on a supposed mission to save the world when all they ever do
[12:48.800 --> 12:56.240]  is kill millions you are failing us but the young people are starting to understand your betrayal
[12:57.680 --> 13:06.400]  the eyes of all future generations are upon you and if you choose to fail us i say we will never
[13:06.400 --> 13:13.440]  forgive you we will not let you get away with this right here right now is where we draw the line
[13:13.440 --> 13:20.000]  line synchronicity serendipity during one of these hate filled rants today president trump
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.800]  showed up during her speech and stole her thunder and as we slow this video down you can see again
[13:26.800 --> 13:34.000]  what can only be described as hitlerian hatred look at the contortions and the twisted look
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.800]  in her face and the glaring hate coming out of her eyes poor little Greta has been turned into an
[13:40.800 --> 13:49.760]  engine of deindustrialization of societal collapse and genocide how dare you pretend that this can
[13:49.760 --> 13:56.880]  be sold with just business as usual and some technical solutions there will not be any solutions
[13:56.880 --> 14:03.840]  or plans presented in line with these figures here today because these numbers are too uncomfortable
[14:03.840 --> 14:10.400]  and you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is filmmaker dinesh to susan others
[14:10.400 --> 14:17.680]  have shown the parallels between Greta and joseph gerbil's Nazi hitler youth posters these two
[14:17.680 --> 14:23.280]  were brainwashed children told that they were saving their right and the earth from evil if you
[14:23.280 --> 14:30.720]  really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act then you would be evil i have
[14:30.720 --> 14:35.040]  three daughters and a lot of their friends over the years have told me that they feel bad and they
[14:35.040 --> 14:40.720]  feel evil and that humans are inherently bad because we're killing the earth this is the vicious
[14:40.720 --> 14:46.560]  brainwashing that children across the board are going through and Greta because she's autistic
[14:46.560 --> 14:55.120]  has taken on the mantle of a savior who is here to force us to submit to the will of her controllers
[14:55.120 --> 15:00.160]  the multinational banks that write her scripts and the corporate media that force feed their
[15:00.160 --> 15:07.280]  propaganda through her little hate-filled mouth and all you can talk about is the money and fairytales
[15:07.280 --> 15:15.040]  of eternal economic growth how dare you one does not even need to scratch the surface of
[15:15.040 --> 15:22.240]  the modern environmental movement to understand it is an anti-human post-human neo eugenics trans
[15:22.240 --> 15:29.360]  humanist movement teaching humanity to hate itself and to destroy civilization and turn all
[15:29.360 --> 15:36.080]  power and control over to a technocracy who will guard the planet via the orderly extermination
[15:36.080 --> 15:43.040]  of humans and then out of this will be the rise of the new age human that's merged with silicon
[15:43.040 --> 15:48.080]  i know that sounds insane because cults are insane but this is the guiding to ladies and

[21:03.120 --> 21:08.960]  government that hoist selective carbon taxes only on certain nations and we're being told that there
[21:08.960 --> 21:14.160]  aren't two genders and that the families are inherently bad and don't talk about men and women
[21:14.160 --> 21:22.960]  on government forms because someone might not be a man or woman we are seeing the 5g the 4g the 3g
[21:22.960 --> 21:27.840]  and the signs going up all over the country i'm going to cover that later that 5g is an operation
[21:27.840 --> 21:33.520]  and if you don't like it leave the area but you don't have a question of whether it's in the area
[21:34.080 --> 21:37.920]  so that's how they're going to deal with the fact that gives you cancer they're actually putting
[21:37.920 --> 21:44.400]  signs up i'm going to get to later saying that it could hurt you they're now putting it up
[21:45.680 --> 21:51.760]  even on realty entries when when the house is by a cell tower i mean boy they know what they're
[21:51.760 --> 21:58.240]  doing they're putting the fine print out everywhere and by the way we've got a story that's linked
[21:58.240 --> 22:03.200]  up on the mighty drudge report dot com that i'm gonna be getting to a little bit later in the hour
[22:04.720 --> 22:12.560]  professor warns social credit to shift law from constitution to analytics and algorithm
[22:13.440 --> 22:20.080]  which are programmed by the establishment there's this idea that computers are fair no they're
[22:20.080 --> 22:26.160]  programmed the first use of computers to control people of course was in nazi germany ladies and
[22:26.160 --> 22:30.480]  gentlemen in nazi germany
[22:32.880 --> 22:37.040]  and ibm worked to run the whole thing and of course the tattoos on the arms
[22:37.040 --> 22:42.160]  of the people at the death camps was that facebook plans launch of its own supreme court
[22:42.160 --> 22:51.280]  which they appoint for handling takedown appeals again there's an example of that whole algorithm
[22:51.280 --> 22:55.040]  that we're dealing with we're going to be covering all of that we're going to be opening the phones
[22:55.040 --> 23:01.840]  up as well we're going to be looking at the different tactics they're trying to use to pick
[23:01.840 --> 23:07.680]  people off one at a time so that we don't resist and say no to the tyranny and the oppression
[23:07.680 --> 23:13.280]  until when you wake up it's too late for you and that's really the message i want to impart to
[23:13.280 --> 23:17.760]  everyone and i know this audience gets it so i'm not preaching at you but to new viewers new listeners
[23:19.040 --> 23:26.160]  everyone's a target of this it's been decided that humans are obsolete it's been decided we're
[23:26.160 --> 23:31.600]  going into a post-human world and then the high tech world that's been built every part of it
[23:31.600 --> 23:39.840]  lowers our IQs makes us more alone makes us have less of an attention span physically makes us weaker
[23:40.720 --> 23:46.800]  and more unhappy every metric every statistic shows it and the system knows it and remember
[23:46.800 --> 23:55.520]  shon parker one of the co-founders of facebook one of its earlier directors admitted that they
[23:55.520 --> 24:02.000]  set it up to control you and make you depressed and to make you get deeper in to the bear trap
[24:03.360 --> 24:08.560]  once it catches your leg you don't run away from it you don't pull away you fall in love with it
[24:08.560 --> 24:13.600]  stick your neck in it and then you're done and that's the plan total phone addiction
[24:15.280 --> 24:19.600]  total computer addiction until you take the brain shift because the next update only operates
[24:19.600 --> 24:23.760]  with the neural implant and oh get over it it's the cool thing everybody's getting it
[24:23.760 --> 24:29.280]  that's been announced three months ago by the guy that said he protect us from ai the good guy
[24:29.920 --> 24:37.600]  elon musk oh what a sweet little person what a what a helper it's not a chip of course it's a whole
[24:37.600 --> 24:44.640]  bunch of wires and he says you will succumb to it everyone will take it or be like a roach
[24:44.640 --> 24:54.800]  or an ant or a potted plant and he says the ai will dominate you then he laughs at you on the stage
[24:54.800 --> 25:03.200]  with his head of development and they obviously are on high tech drugs a bunch of meth they're
[25:03.200 --> 25:09.360]  sweating their eyes are bulging out of their heads then this is silicon valley a bunch of drug doubt
[25:09.360 --> 25:16.640]  whack jobs you see elon musk when he comes out on a tmz video he'll be so high i mean that guy's on
[25:16.640 --> 25:21.680]  a bunch of designer drugs they all are you look at uh like let's find that and play that for our
[25:21.680 --> 25:31.120]  next segment what's wrong with tim cook's eyes i mean every interview he's in under lights man
[25:31.120 --> 25:42.800]  they're 80 iris open the pupils are wide open because they already have wires in their brains
[25:42.800 --> 25:47.840]  by the way we're gonna break this tomorrow with an engineer on air turns out we did some poking
[25:47.840 --> 25:58.160]  around and it turns out that google already has quantum computing that can break any encryption
[25:58.160 --> 26:04.960]  when they always announce something like forbes did on friday it's always five 10 15 years old
[26:06.400 --> 26:10.960]  that was things accelerate stuff will be old when it's a year old or a month old or a day
[26:10.960 --> 26:16.560]  old or an hour old or a millisecond old because there is this singularity of computing and uh
[26:16.560 --> 26:23.120]  compression and code breaking and all of that just means ai will be able to constantly instantly
[26:23.120 --> 26:29.280]  read every piece of data on earth that's digitized and track it in real time and then be able to
[26:29.280 --> 26:33.680]  manipulate it and control populations in mass through mass movements you know that's the new
[26:33.680 --> 26:40.640]  patent that a company has and facebook uh flaunting its monopoly behavior its oligopoly
[26:40.640 --> 26:48.720]  cartel behavior defiant facebook by startup focused on controlling computers with your mind
[26:48.720 --> 26:55.040]  that then tracks mass movements of people and use a stimuli to manipulate mass movements of people
[26:55.040 --> 27:02.560]  like schools of fish which when they set up google in 1998 at their founding meeting which
[27:02.560 --> 27:10.640]  they released five years ago in wire magazine they said our goal is to predict the future
[27:10.640 --> 27:19.520]  and to be an ai system neural link hooked into all humans in a biological silicon interface
[27:20.160 --> 27:25.760]  and that the new organism is the human interface with the machine and that is really the ai system
[27:25.760 --> 27:32.160]  is humans powering a machine all of us nodes into it and then it programming back to us
[27:32.160 --> 27:43.600]  to not just manipulate us but to control the future godlike power in the hands of anti-human
[27:43.600 --> 27:50.560]  sycophantic rusa variants who've been promised by a force that gave them this idea that they
[27:50.560 --> 27:56.880]  will transmute into silicon to be the new age man is how it's translated in latin
[27:56.880 --> 28:08.880]  in latin and then once they transition into the nuvo homo sapien sapien all of us must die as the
[28:09.680 --> 28:17.600]  admittance fee and all the companies out promising soon enough to upload your conscious to a computer
[28:17.600 --> 28:22.800]  say but you need to give your body up when you do it to stop hurting the earth plus the process
[28:22.800 --> 28:28.800]  kills you oh of course it kills you and the ai will watch you for years know who you are
[28:29.840 --> 28:36.000]  be able to deceive people that it's you with voice print face print all of it and it won't be you
[28:36.000 --> 28:44.080]  you'll really die but people will line up and they'll be worshiped on the news as they oh carousel
[28:44.080 --> 28:58.080]  take me up i'm merging i'm beautiful i'm transcendent the ultimate con the ultimate fraud finally

[33:52.080 --> 34:00.160]  and we show the eyes in just a few videos of elon musk of tim cook and others and they're definitely
[34:00.880 --> 34:05.840]  on very serious drugs i mean i've seen people i wasn't a druggy myself but i've seen people on
[34:05.840 --> 34:13.280]  a couple hits acid and their pupils are not that big i've seen people on ecstasy their pupils are
[34:13.280 --> 34:19.200]  not that big and they get bigger it's what police look for these guys have pupils that are 80 percent
[34:19.200 --> 34:24.800]  dilated they're sweating their underlights they're whacked out of their minds and this is who
[34:25.520 --> 34:29.840]  is building our future who's broken into all your computers who built the whole architecture
[34:29.840 --> 34:34.640]  to track you and watch you and then lied to you the whole time about it and now we're using it
[34:34.640 --> 34:40.160]  to control your speech and to control what words you can use and what you can say and do
[34:41.280 --> 34:46.160]  the new encyclopedias are coming out with all of the weird pronouns and the attacks on the family
[34:46.160 --> 34:51.840]  to find the articles at info wars dot com what's wrong with big tech's eyes here's the short report
[34:55.600 --> 35:02.320]  you know the top nazi verner von bron wrote a 1959 book or 1949 book i'm going from memory here
[35:02.320 --> 35:09.360]  called project mars where the elons are the aliens who end up taking over the earth we wear the elon
[35:09.360 --> 35:16.880]  and the elon invasion dr werner von bron wonder what he knew when i watched his promo about this
[35:16.880 --> 35:21.440]  with executives from his company they all look like they're on hardcore drugs i mean they're
[35:21.440 --> 35:28.160]  like sweating their eyes are like lit up like i mean they look nuts you know what somebody's on
[35:28.160 --> 35:33.680]  drugs you know they admit silicon valley is into hardcore speed and illusions they're taking ivy
[35:33.680 --> 35:40.080]  drips at work of dmt they're taking lsd micro doses in a civil side of mushrooms and peyote
[35:40.080 --> 35:45.680]  every day who in the hell would want to join with these people i've seen people take like three hits
[35:45.680 --> 35:49.200]  of acid their eyes aren't that big what the hell are they on and one of the crew members said maybe
[35:49.200 --> 35:53.840]  they've already got this whole neural link wires hooks in their brain because this pkd pointed out
[35:53.840 --> 35:58.960]  philip k dick back in the 70s the cyberpunk future is where you can get any type of pleasure you want
[35:58.960 --> 36:04.080]  to plug in but no one wants to even get up or eat for weeks or days you just die because you
[36:04.080 --> 36:08.960]  just plug all this in and it's the matrix and now the matrix is here and you look at tim cook or
[36:08.960 --> 36:13.600]  elon musk or any of his executives when they're up there on that stage they'll be under white lights
[36:13.600 --> 36:20.080]  their pupils are 90 open zuckerberg all of them these people either have brain chips that's it
[36:20.080 --> 36:27.200]  these guys are wire heads something's going on i'm in here underneath bright lights and my pupils
[36:27.200 --> 36:32.560]  are very little and zoom in if you can my pupils are tiny because i'm not on drugs i've had two cups
[36:32.560 --> 36:37.760]  of coffee today here let me show you my pupils okay my pupils are little they're supposed to close
[36:37.760 --> 36:41.920]  that's what happens under the sun or under bright lights but not these guys these are drug addicts
[36:41.920 --> 36:47.760]  and they want the hint of wires in their brains and all of them got those giant pupils because
[36:47.760 --> 36:56.720]  they've been there and they ain't coming back and they're trying to take us there with them so here's
[36:56.720 --> 37:07.120]  what i want to do we have carpe dontum popping in about 15 minutes into the next hour to talk about
[37:08.000 --> 37:17.440]  the death of the donald arguably the biggest pro to crump area or domain or realm on the internet
[37:17.440 --> 37:22.880]  tens of millions of visitors every day hundreds of thousands of contributors
[37:22.880 --> 37:26.000]  and they did university studies that
[37:29.760 --> 37:35.120]  more than two-thirds of the memes supporting trump and supporting america came out of the
[37:35.120 --> 37:42.400]  donald subreddit and four-chain and eight-chain but but of those three the donald was half of it
[37:44.960 --> 37:50.720]  well they froze it a few months ago and i told everybody i said they're gonna freeze it till
[37:50.720 --> 37:55.360]  it loses the traffic and then they're gonna start killing it and it's essentially dead now and they're
[37:55.360 --> 38:01.280]  just getting rid of it and they put in moderators that are censoring it and it's gone but no one
[38:01.280 --> 38:05.200]  wants to criticize it oh we might get kicked off and i told them they'll strangle it then they'll
[38:05.200 --> 38:10.640]  just destroy it well that's now happened and so it's it's it's bigger than the reddit and then
[38:10.640 --> 38:19.840]  the subreddit the donald's it's about how they strangle things and how people don't organize
[38:19.840 --> 38:25.440]  against it and say no to it they just let them incrementally first put you in the digital ghetto
[38:26.240 --> 38:31.440]  then they start disappearing people out of the digital ghetto where they're suddenly totally banned
[38:31.440 --> 38:36.160]  and then they finally pull up with the trains and grab everybody that's what matt rudge for 10 years
[38:36.720 --> 38:42.080]  and here on the show four years ago said they put you in the digital ghetto first then they start
[38:42.080 --> 38:47.840]  disappearing and people start reporting on the other folks in the ghetto oh don't take me
[38:47.840 --> 38:52.640]  oh i'm not going to promote alex jones i'm not going to promote
[38:55.280 --> 39:01.760]  laura loomer i'm not going to promote anybody that's been banned and then of course it's you
[39:02.560 --> 39:08.000]  and by the time they get to you they're now banning some days hundreds of thousands of people a day
[39:08.000 --> 39:19.680]  they've banned uh facebook and instagram systems in was just a month or so ago in one day that had
[39:19.680 --> 39:26.160]  hundreds and hundreds of millions of followers that's hundreds of millions of people that were
[39:26.160 --> 39:34.000]  going places following things and sharing memes when just a few hundred major meme sites and
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.720]  and conservative and libertarian sites were taken off facebook and twitter and it got almost no attention
[39:44.960 --> 39:50.160]  you know we didn't really feel that much traffic hit when facebook took us down last year others
[39:50.160 --> 39:55.600]  because we were already shadow banned but let me tell you and i knew when i watched them delete
[39:55.600 --> 40:01.360]  hundreds of millions of followers off facebook and off instagram a month and a half ago it was like a
[40:01.360 --> 40:06.880]  ton of bricks hit us it hit everybody else it's hitting trump that's the organic communication
[40:06.880 --> 40:12.000]  but trump 73 he thinks fox news with an average viewership of a million people
[40:13.200 --> 40:18.400]  seeing ends like a hundred thousand he thinks that's important we were getting
[40:21.280 --> 40:27.920]  80 million views a week on average months before the election 2016 just on facebook and youtube
[40:27.920 --> 40:33.280]  if you counted my site it was over 10 million people clicking the audio feed every day
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.880]  it's still millions and millions in fact sometimes even more because that's where they have to go
[40:39.680 --> 40:44.720]  but trump is surrounded by all these corporate types that just want all the

[47:56.880 --> 48:03.920]  or if you'd like to have time to see the civilization grow and return make some real decisions about
[48:03.920 --> 48:10.800]  what we want to do in the universe see god is all about free will and is not going to take control
[48:10.800 --> 48:18.160]  of us but there are weak things in the universe that violate the rules and will take control of
[48:18.160 --> 48:23.520]  something like this planet and that's why they're damned to hell and can only try to take us with
[48:23.520 --> 48:31.600]  them i for one i'm not going with them so do not fear he who can kill the body but fear decisions
[48:31.600 --> 48:40.640]  you can make that will send your system your spirit your program that's free will to the
[48:41.600 --> 48:46.800]  globalist mainframe they tell you in all their hollywood movies what they're doing
[48:46.800 --> 48:55.200]  the main program in tron once all the programs bound to it absorbed into it gone their free
[48:55.200 --> 49:05.280]  will destroyed their souls devoured and the mainframe is going to give all its power to the beast
[49:06.560 --> 49:14.560]  just like in tron all my systems yours and the system of oppression is going to become a thousand
[49:14.560 --> 49:26.480]  foot colossus but it has clay feet built on mud going to fall so all you servants of satan keep
[49:26.480 --> 49:33.920]  doubling down keep arrogantly claiming you're in power look at you you're falling and ugly the demons
[49:33.920 --> 49:44.400]  aren't too nice to you you take on their form don't you and then you become nothing more than
[49:44.400 --> 49:52.400]  slaves let's look at gretta gretta thunberg pumped full of more vaccines and a porcupine
[49:56.000 --> 50:00.560]  looking just like the grinch whose heart was three times too small
[50:03.680 --> 50:06.880]  brainwashed by her anti for parents
[50:09.120 --> 50:12.960]  to hate civilization to hate humanity but to believe that she has a right
[50:12.960 --> 50:19.680]  to rule and to cut off the fossil fuels that it's almost like there's a god
[50:20.640 --> 50:24.480]  to put him here right when the earth starts losing his atmosphere which we are lowest
[50:24.480 --> 50:30.960]  level of carbon dioxide ever recorded in the last century a trace gas not even one tenth of one percent
[50:33.360 --> 50:40.000]  and suddenly we find giant supplies of it held within the earth at the key time to terraform
[50:40.000 --> 50:50.240]  and save the planet and they zoom in jacked spacetroopers dropping in turn off kills humans
[50:50.240 --> 50:57.520]  are bad give it everyone save yourselves by dying i mean i mean dropping in man
[50:58.160 --> 51:04.480]  avataring in but not avataring in to save the planet to kill it give up humans lay down and
[51:04.480 --> 51:11.840]  die it's all right in front of you here comes trump in we're not turning the power off we're
[51:11.840 --> 51:16.320]  not going to roll over and die she's literally giving the speech minutes before that we've been
[51:16.320 --> 51:21.840]  playing which is like how dare you you'll need to stand down and you need to cut off all the carbon
[51:21.840 --> 51:34.320]  now i am watching you american and then literally trump i checked it she gave that rant seconds
[51:34.320 --> 51:39.840]  before he comes in to the sorrows people the media are all clapping she's like we're watching you'll
[51:39.840 --> 51:44.720]  leave a deal with you and all of a sudden trump comes in our economy's getting better we're the
[51:44.720 --> 51:52.240]  net exporter of energy there's known sorrows operatives there is her security and they don't
[51:52.240 --> 52:00.080]  even know what to do but i have had i have three daughters and so there's been a lot of birthday
[52:00.080 --> 52:04.880]  parties we usually have over my parents because my parents have got a big pool
[52:07.120 --> 52:11.360]  at least the daughters that fall in the summer which is two of them
[52:14.240 --> 52:19.440]  and there'll be all these mothers there and they'll come over and say you know i'm really kind of a
[52:19.440 --> 52:23.440]  liberal but my daughter comes home and cries when she drives by and sees a new house being built
[52:23.440 --> 52:27.360]  she's taking the animals the bugs the bunnies are dying she feels really guilty and says she wants
[52:27.360 --> 52:31.840]  to die and so i kind of hear what you're saying is right now and then the daughter swims over and
[52:31.840 --> 52:38.320]  goes look at my toy turtle you know and that's a true story and i hear those constantly and we had
[52:38.320 --> 52:43.120]  savannah hernandez on she's a young lady so you know she was a little kid just like 10 years ago
[52:44.000 --> 52:49.120]  12 13 years ago and you know she was scared at night because they said the earth's gonna die
[52:49.120 --> 52:54.160]  and all the penguins are drowning right now and they show a penguin on top of the ice flow
[52:54.160 --> 52:58.400]  now look they can't can't swim he's gonna die and the little girls cry they go it's your fault
[52:58.400 --> 53:05.360]  little girls i remember my parents took me to the elephant man when i was like five years old
[53:05.360 --> 53:09.680]  and i was crying we had to leave because it was so sad watching the deform guy get beat up it was a
[53:09.680 --> 53:15.600]  true story at least part of it was a composite of a true story children are very tenderhearted
[53:16.560 --> 53:21.840]  and people just i don't go to horror movies hardly ever but i mean i'll go to a horror movie
[53:21.840 --> 53:27.120]  and i mean there were people with five-year-old kids that it a few years ago when the when it came
[53:27.120 --> 53:32.880]  back out a movie about kids getting killed and people had their kids at it it's it's sick
[53:34.320 --> 53:38.320]  and but this is the real world they're telling them the earth's dying your parents are able
[53:38.320 --> 53:42.720]  nothing's being done they're believing it when they see congresswomen saying the earth is gone in
[53:42.720 --> 53:49.440]  12 years and beto says 11 and other people say seven they believe this and then they become angry
[53:49.440 --> 53:54.160]  by the time they hit puberty because when you're little you don't know what to do but then they
[53:54.160 --> 54:02.240]  teach them the hate then they become the antifa which is what grata is autistic aspergers believes
[54:02.240 --> 54:09.920]  you must follow her will you must do it now beto's saying 10 years it was 11 now now now it's
[54:09.920 --> 54:13.440]  they've all got to compete with each other and then they admit in videos we got that oh we're
[54:13.440 --> 54:21.440]  really just trying to scare you so surprise the official escort for the 16-year-old global warming
[54:21.440 --> 54:29.360]  expert gretta thunberg is a leftist hack funded by george soros
[54:32.080 --> 54:36.800]  gretta thunberg is demon possessed and in need of an exorcism the osagami says
[54:36.800 --> 54:44.720]  says and then it just goes on from there i've got some of the tweets here that uh president trump
[54:44.720 --> 54:51.840]  put out here they are look how gretta looked five years ago three years ago she didn't look
[54:51.840 --> 54:57.600]  as psychotic but boy they've gotten to her now video trump still show from gretta during brief
[54:57.600 --> 55:02.160]  appearance at climate summit and then trump said she seemed like a very happy young girl when
[55:02.160 --> 55:07.280]  you watch the hateful video looking forward to a bright and wonderful future so nice to see we're
[55:07.280 --> 55:10.480]  going to play some of that for you when we come back and then give the number out and take your
[55:10.480 --> 55:16.400]  calls and carpe donkton's going to join us but look brandon darby of right bart says why was it
[55:16.400 --> 55:21.520]  okay to criticize one 16-year-old but not the other remember the covenant kid smiling standing
[55:21.520 --> 55:30.480]  his ground was a white supremacist and evil but now gretta she's good so let's go ahead and roll
[55:30.480 --> 55:36.400]  the video in the audio of just a brief exchange where trump comes walking into the un right after
[55:36.400 --> 55:42.480]  she gives us into the world rent says we are watching you you will pay if control the central
[55:42.480 --> 55:48.720]  banks of all oil all production tax everything oh you will pay this is her looking at trump here it is
[55:53.440 --> 55:55.760]  look at that absolutely amazing
[55:55.760 --> 56:04.160]  and we're slowing that down radio listeners can't see this but you need to see it for yourself
[56:06.480 --> 56:12.000]  they say a picture tells a thousand words this tells a billion words look at that that is like
[56:12.000 --> 56:16.240]  the hitler youth that is the crazed hate with the soros lackey there's an article about who he is
[56:16.240 --> 56:22.960]  who he works for hovering around behind her and look at how much they hate him make no mistake
[56:22.960 --> 56:28.240]  soros a strong make no mistake trumps the president he's running things himself and they can't stand
[56:28.240 --> 56:32.640]  it we're going to go to break and come back and get to her actual rant that is hard to listen to
[56:32.640 --> 56:37.360]  but you need to hear the hate of the grinch that would steal the carbon from the planet
[56:38.240 --> 56:44.000]  you can overestimate how bad news she is please don't forget i've decided to bring black friday

[1:00:21.200 --> 1:00:27.920]  trump's impeachment and his execution including the former governor of massachusetts bill welbert
[1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:34.720]  play that clip coming up next segment i'm gonna open the phones up towards the end of the sour
[1:00:34.720 --> 1:00:38.880]  we're gonna already be taking calls the entire third hour will be that but also i need to get to
[1:00:38.880 --> 1:00:44.160]  trump i get irritated with trump because i want to fight the globalist harder and i see how criminal
[1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:48.720]  they are now they've gotten away with it but man no president in in 50 something years has given a
[1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:54.240]  speech about religious persecution at the un and he's put laws in place where churches can talk about
[1:00:54.240 --> 1:00:58.480]  their political views and talk about abortion in the second amendment so he's reinforced the first
[1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:05.040]  amendment i mean he's just done a lot he gave a powerful speech with pence um at the un last
[1:01:05.040 --> 1:01:09.600]  night that i want to get to today gave a speech at the un i want to get to but let's get back to
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:17.360]  gretta thunberg who i've i've known about she's super nails on chalkboard so she's just another
[1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:23.680]  brainwashed youth happens to be autistic she's got a different parents but the image of trump coming
[1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:30.400]  into the un yesterday and then her looking like a psychotic and and from every angle every time
[1:01:30.400 --> 1:01:35.600]  she talks she looks completely nasty and hateful i mean if your team if you were look at this every
[1:01:35.600 --> 1:01:42.480]  photo every shot this is a crazed person who's working for the most ruthless sickening evil
[1:01:42.480 --> 1:01:50.480]  post-human exterminist eugenicists that want to cut the power off so uh here she is ever
[1:01:50.480 --> 1:02:08.320]  she gave this bizarre rant when trump walks in here it is see what happens we have a long way
[1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:13.200]  to go we'll see what happens we're doing just fine we're doing very well with the economy some
[1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:18.160]  numbers came out that are fantastic our economy now is better than anybody's in the world and it
[1:02:18.160 --> 1:02:24.000]  has been for the last two years but we're doing very well and as far as the meeting is concerned
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:30.960]  we'll see what happens again again um you can watch that and you don't pick her up but when
[1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:36.480]  you slow it down you can see it and it's just incredible and we do that at the front of our
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:42.480]  report where we talk about her channeling hitler that report is at bandot video here it is our
[1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:48.400]  ecosystems are collapsing we are in the beginning of a mass extinction
[1:02:52.160 --> 1:02:58.640]  more than 70 years ago adolf hitler cryptically stated first you get the women then you've got
[1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:06.800]  the children so follow the men i shouldn't be up here i should be back in school on the other
[1:03:06.800 --> 1:03:16.560]  side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope how dare you this is child abuse
[1:03:17.600 --> 1:03:25.600]  you have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words yet i'm one of the lucky ones
[1:03:25.600 --> 1:03:34.480]  gretta thunberg is a victim gretta thunberg is autistic she has ass burgers and like so many other
[1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:40.320]  children in history who've been handicapped she's been taken advantage of by her antifa parents
[1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:43.200]  all right by the left again i just wanted to play some more of that because the report is so
[1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:49.840]  important it's at band dot video and it's already gotten 70 000 views since it went up last night
[1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:54.720]  which is good for our site but when some stuff goes viral we've had some things get 10 million views
[1:03:55.440 --> 1:03:59.120]  since we launched our own video platform a year ago because we've been censored off the web
[1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:03.120]  but we've not been censored off the web you are able to share the links from band dot video
[1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:09.520]  info wars.com is blocked in pop-up blockers the whole site it's blocked in spam filters it's
[1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:16.000]  blocked at most companies you have to go around that and tell people it's forbidden but news wars.com
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:21.920]  is not as blocked and band.video is not blocked anywhere yet and don't worry as they do that
[1:04:21.920 --> 1:04:28.480]  we'll just keep launching more URLs this is how we resist that's why it's so precious that's why
[1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:35.840]  it's so paramount that's why it's so critical to win this information war when you by hand tell

[1:05:55.360 --> 1:06:21.280]  nine the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:32.960]  ladies and gentlemen redda thunberg is embraced by the globalist embraced by the un
[1:06:33.600 --> 1:06:40.720]  and their anti-human post-human anti-carbon plan that they admit is to reduce forcibly world
[1:06:40.720 --> 1:06:46.800]  population we've seen democrat candidates come out admit that they want depopulation they want to
[1:06:46.800 --> 1:06:50.960]  abort the brown people now that's why they're fighting the nazi trump who doesn't want to
[1:06:50.960 --> 1:06:55.040]  abort the brown people that's why they keep screaming racism so much because these people are
[1:06:55.040 --> 1:07:02.160]  just anti-human period they want euthanasia the old uh it's just not marriage just how authoritarian
[1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:08.320]  they are because they come out of the eugenics movement that hitler was just a spinoff of or was a
[1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:17.760]  small branch but ibm helped create hitler helped fund hitler helped run computers that decided
[1:07:17.760 --> 1:07:21.280]  how long to work people and when to kill them in the death camps the holler of the machines
[1:07:21.280 --> 1:07:27.520]  and now they're establishing this planetary world government based on ai tracking carbon
[1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:33.200]  so gretta thunberg has been rejected in germany she's very unpopular in europe but they force
[1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:40.800]  feeder as this youth believing it will make the youth suddenly hate their parents and get
[1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:46.480]  in their faces and she's got antifa parents she's an antifa member we've got the photos and all
[1:07:46.480 --> 1:07:50.640]  the admissions she's there being run by the soros organization when she was at the un
[1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:58.080]  and trump shows up while she's sitting there doing a multi-hour long photo op ranting hatefully in
[1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:06.000]  fact here's video shot literally minutes before trump arrives in the press junket area and steals
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:11.360]  the show here she is threatening everyone we're watching you we're coming after you you're killing
[1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:20.880]  all these people climate change when cutting carbon would kill billions of people and carbon the amount
[1:08:20.880 --> 1:08:26.240]  of carbon we're putting out is negligible to a volcano and they know that they want to teach you
[1:08:26.240 --> 1:08:32.080]  that you're bad as a reason to conquer you and control you remember india mexico china and 160
[1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:36.960]  other countries make zero cuts but they're lobbying for us to because no one can do business here
[1:08:36.960 --> 1:08:43.440]  hitler couldn't conquer us the communist russians couldn't conquer us mal couldn't conquer us the
[1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:49.760]  british crown couldn't conquer us but carbon taxes and speaking to our guilt manipulating our christian
[1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:57.120]  ethos can't it's unbelievable how they've taught us to give up our power to give up our industry to
[1:08:57.120 --> 1:09:03.520]  act like fools but the the mind controls lifting young people don't buy into global warming and
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:07.040]  statistics they don't buy into abortion they don't buy into world government they don't buy the
[1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:11.840]  leftist garbage people know it's establishment and they're rebelling against it you know god built
[1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:17.120]  that into us as a species to want to get us out of the nest at 13 or 14 we start rebelling against
[1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:21.520]  our parents and sometimes they're good parents and it's wrong we rebel but sometimes we've got bad
[1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:26.880]  parents and sometimes we've got bad governments and bad priests and bad systems and so it's built
[1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:36.080]  into humans to rebel guess what the young people know what the establishment is they know what the
[1:09:36.080 --> 1:09:42.160]  government cheese is they don't get a thunberg is a mental patient and everyone is rejecting her
[1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:47.040]  but the very weakest minded people so you go to a leftist event and they look like the walking
[1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:53.920]  dead and act like the walking dead because these are the pathetic followers the cannon fodder the
[1:09:53.920 --> 1:10:03.440]  useful idiots the morons the smucks the dupes the marks the swabs the fools the ignorant idiots
[1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:09.600]  the people that bought the con and keep doubling down on the con forever and again how many of
[1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:15.760]  you know someone who bought into one of those speaker scams where you're at the shopping center
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:19.600]  and the guy goes oh i got these speakers i gotta sell them they're really worth 500 but i gotta get
[1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:24.880]  rid of them i'm willing to sell them to you for 100 bucks and you go that's a scam they get mad at
[1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:31.920]  you well i've i've been in parking lots twice once with some family that's no longer in my family
[1:10:33.040 --> 1:10:38.400]  and once with some friends and the person goes don't listen to him he just wants you to do a good
[1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:43.920]  deal and the person goes yeah i'm getting the deal how many people you know and bought into the
[1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:50.960]  nigerian scam i know two people actually three one of them was i knew in business they wouldn't
[1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:56.560]  talk to me after they got ripped off by them they thought i called the nigerians and stopped them
[1:10:56.560 --> 1:11:03.920]  from giving them the five mil the left has bet on the scam so much and believe there's a a pot of
[1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:07.760]  gold at the end of this tunnel and they can't admit they've been conned that they've got
[1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:12.240]  worthless educations that the whole system was built to make them dependent so they'd be pissed
[1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:17.360]  and follow the establishment around by the nose like a horde of lemmings off a cliff
[1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:22.960]  so here's gretta being very threatening and demanding we all submit to her and
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:28.000]  if you look at her and listen to her she acts like the grinch that stole christmas even has
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:35.360]  the same shape head she's very disturbing here it is my message is that we'll be watching you
[1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:44.480]  ah back that up let's play that again my message is i will be we will be watching you
[1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:50.560]  with the computers and the ai and the youths movement and you hear the crowd
[1:11:53.760 --> 1:11:56.480]  the blast for total power continue please
[1:11:56.480 --> 1:12:07.440]  my message is that we'll be watching you very sinister
[1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:18.960]  this is all wrong i shouldn't be up here i should be back in school your minion on the other side
[1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:29.520]  of the ocean ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope i'm sure you you have stolen my
[1:12:29.520 --> 1:12:37.280]  dreams and my childhood your enemy words yet back up again five seconds it's not the teachers
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:42.320]  that brainwasher it's not the parents that told her all these lies you know alwar 2003 the earth
[1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:48.160]  will be over by 2013 all of this no it's your fault you have stolen my dreams you have made me
[1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:55.120]  angry and now i will avenge you i am watching you you will submit to me let us continue
[1:12:55.920 --> 1:13:04.240]  well for hope how dare you how dare you you have stolen my dreams and my childhood with

[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:16.080]  but everything is projection the globalists are trying to steal our dreams they're trying to cut
[1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:19.840]  off the energy they're trying to tell us that families are bad breakup families they're doing
[1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:22.480]  everything they can to make us mentally ill pushing all these dangerous drugs on us
[1:13:28.560 --> 1:13:36.080]  and then she gets into you all just want some money she has some money to balski we are nihilists
[1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:41.920]  we care about nothing except some money which doesn't make you a nihilist
[1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:49.120]  that can we roll the grinch place so the most likely reasonable
[1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:54.320]  may have been that his heart was two sizes too small
[1:13:58.960 --> 1:14:03.600]  that's a good one because i told do i said hey we find this there's one where he's straight on
[1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:11.360]  and he's mad he gets an idea a horrible idea the most horrible ideas is what they say
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:16.000]  and then have her next to that because he's making the exact same face same shape head
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:22.080]  you're a bad one mr grinch and so we're gonna have that for you ladies and gentlemen
[1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:26.080]  we're going to look at how the globalists strangle
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:32.000]  you know that's that's that's close to it we're going to
[1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:38.240]  as a radio listener you always have to remember we're simulcast television so we're radio that
[1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:42.560]  meets television but a lot of times i'm commenting on things i'm seeing on screen sometimes i'm
[1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:46.880]  driving on the road listening to rebroadcast and it sounds a little bit incongruent but that is
[1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:52.400]  why that is going on as i said we're gonna go to break and we've got a great window into why we
[1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:58.800]  may lose and i'm not saying why we may lose to demoralize you i say so we correct course
[1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:06.240]  and don't do this anymore you know i spend a good part of my time dealing with organizations and
[1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:12.640]  groups of people who are always trying to make sure their conservative or nationalist or patriot
[1:15:12.640 --> 1:15:20.720]  organization gets the most publicity and something instead of actually just taking action and getting
[1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:28.000]  things done and that's why they're not successful and we're about the death of the donald subreddit
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:33.600]  you know it's dead it's gone but see it's like these old crazy guys whose wives die they don't
[1:15:33.600 --> 1:15:37.200]  tell anybody they got they got their skeleton in the bed and still puts lipstick on them
[1:15:37.840 --> 1:15:41.200]  it's kind of like that they're still folks they still got the corpse dolled up in the back
[1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:47.200]  and you know they still go in there sometimes on the moonlit night they ignore the smell and
[1:15:47.200 --> 1:15:53.440]  plum on top of it but the donald subreddit is that dead carcass people have sex with the red

[1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:34.560]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones welcome back my friends well it's
[1:20:34.560 --> 1:20:41.680]  very frustrating to tune in to c span and to watch democrat congressman and senators in
[1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:48.480]  intelligence committees arm services committees the most powerful committees say my name and
[1:20:48.480 --> 1:20:53.120]  say we want him to not be able to post anywhere on the internet and to watch the ceo's of major
[1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:58.560]  tech companies say we're working on it right now and then i tune in to mainstream news and they go
[1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:04.880]  oh no one's censoring anybody but then right next with 11 articles celebrating how they're
[1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:11.120]  banning all these different people i mean it's like schizophrenic they're like training you just
[1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:20.960]  to accept lies and then it came out last year mit did a big study for the democrats
[1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:27.600]  and they found that the majority of memes more than two-thirds come from two subreddits donald
[1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:36.400]  mainly and fortune and then the eu pass laws where you have to get pre-approval to make a meme
[1:21:37.520 --> 1:21:44.800]  where you go to prison they pass that law now it's here now all the memes is cave drawings
[1:21:44.800 --> 1:21:52.640]  graffiti just taking a picture and saying something funny that's on just human communication
[1:21:52.640 --> 1:21:57.760]  to communication and they're trying to pass copyright laws right now in congress that bypass
[1:21:57.760 --> 1:22:02.160]  courts and just take money out of your bank account if someone says a meme is theirs
[1:22:03.680 --> 1:22:08.320]  even though there's already supreme court rulings and everything you know any war hall
[1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:12.880]  would cut out Campbell soup things out of the newspaper and then glue them together and call
[1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:18.400]  them art people try to say hey that's ours no you he changed it it was fair use they're getting rid
[1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:25.200]  of that so you don't even need to do that since ai can't stop memes because it doesn't get jokes
[1:22:25.200 --> 1:22:30.000]  on facebook twitter you name it they're just restricting it and they got rid of again thousands
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:35.760]  of major meme sites in the last year hundreds of thousands of people destroyed hundreds of
[1:22:35.760 --> 1:22:42.080]  millions of followers who were following them gone and that's just killing a form of human
[1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:51.520]  communication like saying you can't pass notes in prison so the donald was the biggest of all of
[1:22:51.520 --> 1:22:59.440]  these millions and millions of visitors a day and it's the place where people were sharing memes
[1:22:59.440 --> 1:23:05.200]  they made how dare those dirty americans and others take an image make a joke take a video put it
[1:23:05.200 --> 1:23:10.640]  together with something else carpe donkton showing joe biden come up behind joe biden when he was
[1:23:10.640 --> 1:23:17.200]  groping people and and and they said that was fake cnn said he's deceptive he showed joe biden
[1:23:17.200 --> 1:23:21.840]  grumping groping joe biden no it was called a joke no one thinks joe biden really did that it's a
[1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:29.680]  cut out they're all the deep fake or or or paul watson tweeted out an image of a zoom in on jim
[1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:34.160]  acosta hitting the woman and grabbing the microwave wasn't even his video it was somebody just zoomed
[1:23:34.160 --> 1:23:39.680]  it in paul saw it grabbed it tweeted oh input war is faked it we need action now to stop the the
[1:23:39.680 --> 1:23:48.400]  deep faking meanwhile mainstream media edits things and deep fakes things and lies so i told carpe
[1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:51.600]  donkton this month ago when he was on the show we were talking to her right and he said yeah the
[1:23:51.600 --> 1:23:55.440]  donald you know it's putting quarantine nobody can visit unless you know the url it's killed the
[1:23:55.440 --> 1:23:59.920]  traffic 95 percent and i said he said you know there's an appeal in a few months and i said yeah
[1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:03.520]  they're not going to take the appeal off this is how they strangle things in the dark and then
[1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:08.160]  you're going to have people on there that say oh let's let them do that and just keep it frozen
[1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:11.600]  and they're going to be people that reddits talk to them make sure it just dies slowly
[1:24:12.800 --> 1:24:18.880]  and now exactly as i've said has happened which again is why we keep losing is that everyone
[1:24:18.880 --> 1:24:24.240]  hangs on oh alex got censored better not talk about him then we'll be safe and you get censored
[1:24:24.240 --> 1:24:28.080]  then no one talks about you because they'll be censored and people just hope they're the last
[1:24:28.080 --> 1:24:34.480]  people standing you end up losing everything because you acted like a slave that's the creed of slaves
[1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:41.840]  lay down hope you're last to be eaten and so i was very glad but he said well i'm going to create
[1:24:43.360 --> 1:24:49.200]  i'm going to create uh the site memeworld.com and you know hopefully you and others will
[1:24:49.200 --> 1:24:52.960]  contribute to it you know i don't want to step on the toes of uh i'm going to go to him here in a
[1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:56.960]  minute but i'm telling the story i was talking about his toes he's hard of a make a site and i'm
[1:24:56.960 --> 1:25:02.080]  like yeah it's america you better it's not coming back carpe he goes well i just want it to be a
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:05.360]  place for everybody to share i don't want to compete with that i said look it's dead already
[1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:09.840]  i said you better go in there and tell people come over here we better build our own sites like
[1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:17.200]  matt drudge said so now here we are and of course the the donald's gone it's shut down nobody can
[1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:21.520]  even hardly post but a few operatives and everybody's so oh leave it alone don't talk about it just
[1:25:21.520 --> 1:25:25.920]  just you know there'll be one little remnant one little leaf will blow off the tree and we'll all
[1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:34.240]  right away on that that's where this is going and again the donald is the model of how they kill
[1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:40.560]  everything slowly strangle it and that's a chinese company that gave the donald owner read it all this
[1:25:40.560 --> 1:25:47.200]  money in february millions of dollars so you wonder what's going on the chai comms are in our elections
[1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:54.000]  it's election meddling 10 cent an internet-based technology and cultural enterprise chinese censorship
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:26:03.040]  in america run by the chinese government they run all their media systems and they're here
[1:26:03.920 --> 1:26:09.440]  we don't just own hollywood so joining us is carpe donkem from meme world again the president loves
[1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:13.920]  this information puts it out and i just don't know why we're gonna allow the chai comms to come
[1:26:13.920 --> 1:26:17.440]  do this but it's already happened but i'm not trying to tweak my horn but did i not tell you
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:21.760]  months ago this is how this is gonna play out and and you agreed but you you had to wait and see
[1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:27.680]  you're so polite you didn't even want to warn people hey come over to meme world and then now it's
[1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:32.320]  kind of like is it all right for us to say meme world will we make the donald lords the chai comms
[1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:38.800]  that own it mad i say screw the chai comms screw them and screw the donald the dictator of china
[1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:47.360]  now runs reddit go ahead i agree um you know and you did tell me um and this has been a
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:54.080]  long time coming you know there's a there's another deadline in two days of when an appeal
[1:26:54.080 --> 1:27:02.320]  can go out and every time that they've done an appeal so far they've imposed more restrictions
[1:27:02.320 --> 1:27:07.120]  on it you say well now all you need to do is like fix this even though they've held up their end of
[1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:14.320]  the the bargain the moderators of the donald we do need to create infrastructure and we need to
[1:27:14.320 --> 1:27:20.560]  create other sites like meme world and i'm i'm willing to promote any any website that someone
[1:27:20.560 --> 1:27:25.280]  wants to come up with that's going to provide an alternative where people can get their information
[1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:31.520]  out i really i really still think that the people need to fight what's happening on reddit and i
[1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:35.600]  think getting the word out is one of the most important things and getting some i was getting
[1:27:35.600 --> 1:27:42.560]  some attention on it because the donald does occupy a very unique space of being an island in the
[1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:48.880]  middle of a sea of liberal tears um and there has been a lot of people that have been redpilled just
[1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:54.240]  by you know visiting the site and finding out that it's not at all like what it has been advertised
[1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:59.120]  as you know a place of racism and hatred and big well that's another reason they want to kill it so
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:03.360]  that once it's dead they can make up whatever they want about it exactly they can say well you know
[1:28:03.360 --> 1:28:08.080]  that they can rewrite the history and they can they can say well you know it was removed because
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:14.480]  it was they did all these bad things there and um here are three posts that show exactly what the
[1:28:14.480 --> 1:28:19.680]  donald was all about you can't look at it anymore because we already took it all down but you know
[1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:26.160]  that we're telling you the truth that it was all just racist posts and craziness and conspiracy
[1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:31.440]  theories that's what they want to do they want to rewrite the history when we come back we're
[1:28:31.440 --> 1:28:34.640]  going to lay this out and and again you're a trooper you do a great job you've helped get a
[1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:39.200]  lot of people over to memeworld.com so they can keep operating but i know the inside baseball
[1:28:39.200 --> 1:28:43.360]  is folks are telling you hey you shouldn't even have memeworld you know just stick with the donald
[1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:47.520]  or do something with us you just control freaks who don't want to actually produce anything
[1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:50.800]  they just want to tell us what to do well guess what we're going to keep fighting we're going to
[1:28:50.800 --> 1:29:06.480]  keep making memes and we're going to keep posting them like some micros doing at memeworld.

[1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:16.640]  memes that are so effective and and we just sit there strategically and let that happen
[1:35:17.200 --> 1:35:22.640]  in our country shame on reddit and the evil leftists that run it you know it's fine if you
[1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:26.880]  want to stage an event where you threaten to kill me and my family at a dinner table
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:31.440]  that at lucy's chicken and i try to walk out and they confront me then they edit it and put it on
[1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:35.520]  reddit and say i attacked them the statesman went down there and found out they came and threatened
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:41.520]  me that's what they said at lucy's but see reddit doesn't care they put on their front page because
[1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:50.400]  they're chai kong think about that folks and remember it so they slowly strangled the donald
[1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:56.320]  the number one place for memes in the world that had billions of impressions every month
[1:35:56.320 --> 1:36:02.960]  during the election and after and president trump thinks fox news with an average audience of
[1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:10.480]  million people is important because he likes slickness he still thinks all the 70-year-olds
[1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:17.040]  watching that are what's going to dictate the future when just facebook videos a week just on
[1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:26.640]  politics are 50 times better than fox news and fox news is the biggest table news channel
[1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:33.360]  nothing against fox news or tucker carlson or the other folks on there that's taking a turn
[1:36:33.360 --> 1:36:38.800]  and so trumps meets with carpe donked him and his family and a couple times says great job and
[1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:44.080]  does all that and you know tweet somewhat carpe does out great but how about we understand that
[1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:48.800]  this country is being taken over so get into memeworld.com i know there's going to be a
[1:36:50.160 --> 1:36:54.640]  article coming out tomorrow i guess in the resurrected conservative publication human
[1:36:54.640 --> 1:37:00.560]  events that's good about this but everybody needs to send out memeworld.com i mean i'm
[1:37:00.560 --> 1:37:04.800]  promoting it because i know we need a place where the donald was because when i watched it
[1:37:05.520 --> 1:37:09.920]  be marched up to the gallows when the chai comms bought it bought a can you know an
[1:37:09.920 --> 1:37:15.040]  interest to be able to uh well i guess a payoff basically in my view my opinion uh that i was
[1:37:15.040 --> 1:37:19.840]  like hey we better have something and and instead folks ran around on the deck i know inside baseball
[1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:24.480]  and bitched and said no don't build it ain't new stay here in this hanging ship and so i know you
[1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:27.920]  didn't promote it as much as you would have and i were even like and i'll promote everyone else
[1:37:27.920 --> 1:37:32.960]  please other people make sites launch lifeboats like no don't launch lifeboats the titanic's doing
[1:37:32.960 --> 1:37:38.400]  quite fine uh well that's not what's going on here so memeworld.com the great ben garrison's there
[1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:44.080]  there's so many other amazing people are there on the site tell us about some people that are on
[1:37:44.080 --> 1:37:46.960]  memeworld then let's get back into this and what's happened i'll kind of shut up so you can have a
[1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:54.480]  floor um so we have uh i mean as you said ben garrison i've i've talked with uh the great mark
[1:37:54.480 --> 1:38:01.520]  dice um you know he's uh he's agreed to put some kind of exclusive content up from time to time
[1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:09.520]  um i have uh myself i'm on there as well um mad liberals uh he visited the oval office with me
[1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:18.000]  uh i invited him along uh he is on there um we've got uh brick suit he's sort of a famous figure
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:24.560]  at trump rallies he always wears the the wall suit uh when he goes there um we've got something
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:30.160]  wicked which uh i think you played uh several of his videos trump is shared too oh yeah i mean i
[1:38:30.160 --> 1:38:33.200]  mean he's as good as you are and there aren't many so you guys are right up there at the top
[1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:38.560]  amazing so a lot of exciting things happening at memeworld.com yeah and the sole memes is there i
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:44.080]  mean there's there's a lot of people up there um really any video that you've seen probably in the
[1:38:44.080 --> 1:38:50.080]  last year and a half is somebody that's on the site i i i keep only the best friends and all my
[1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:53.920]  friends are on there well you've done a great job and again i'm not an infighter i'm not a
[1:38:53.920 --> 1:38:58.240]  troublemaker everybody knows that watching with donald slowly strangled really upset me i'm glad
[1:38:58.240 --> 1:39:02.560]  you launched a live boat uh but but but give us the latest is there any hope for it maybe making
[1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:07.280]  a bunch of attention maybe this article coming out tomorrow maybe we all push that i mean is
[1:39:07.280 --> 1:39:12.400]  there any chance to get the chai comes to back off or well you know it's it's really hard to say i
[1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:17.040]  mean it it it really depends on whether or not they feel threatened by the amount of attention
[1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:22.240]  that it gets and um you know i talked to um i was in an event a couple weeks ago and i talked to
[1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:29.520]  you know 10 or 15 different people about uh can we get some momentum behind this and and that the
[1:39:29.520 --> 1:39:34.160]  response was all yes we should we should get it behind it so this is sort of the the tip of the
[1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:43.520]  spear i think um what really needs to happen is that uh red it needs to feel pressure that they
[1:39:43.520 --> 1:39:52.160]  need to abide by the rules that they are making everyone abide by um the over the last four years
[1:39:52.160 --> 1:39:58.720]  or so uh what has been happening is they have been creating special rules for the donald specifically
[1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:03.040]  number one that the donald can't go on the front page anymore uh there was a week right around the
[1:40:03.040 --> 1:40:09.040]  pulse shooting where uh 13 out of 25 of the top posts and all of reddit were from the donald
[1:40:09.040 --> 1:40:15.040]  and they changed the algorithm and said uh the donald no longer could be on the front page of reddit
[1:40:15.040 --> 1:40:21.680]  uh just for anything for any reason and so that's the slow ongoing strangulation of of one of
[1:40:21.680 --> 1:40:28.240]  trump's you know top sites bigger than fox news he just doesn't get it his people don't understand
[1:40:28.240 --> 1:40:33.440]  it and and and now it's uh the secret you can't even find it and it's like like one one millionth
[1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:40.800]  of itself well trump trump himself did in a uh and asked me anything on the donald in 2016 uh
[1:40:40.800 --> 1:40:46.240]  brad parskill is is quoted as saying that he uh visited the donald every single day to see what
[1:40:46.240 --> 1:40:54.320]  was up there so uh it's it's been a very huge part of the trump universe and it's been slowly
[1:40:55.360 --> 1:41:00.320]  strangled as you said and they did that so trump wouldn't take action but trump needs to take action
[1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:04.240]  and just tweet about how the chinese invested in it and now it's very very disturbing that they've
[1:41:04.240 --> 1:41:08.640]  shut down this great community but but i i want to be fair so let's do one more segment and give
[1:41:08.640 --> 1:41:12.800]  me the floor because i'm ranting okay about the article coming out tomorrow what people can do to
[1:41:12.800 --> 1:41:16.800]  get the president to take action because it could start with something like this we also have these
[1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:21.840]  antitrust investigations uh that are going on and we have examples of how trump's going after the
[1:41:21.840 --> 1:41:26.960]  vape companies with antitrust and and and with consumer investigations there's a lot of ways
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:33.680]  via espionage uh investigations to go after not just donald and not just reddit but but but let's
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:43.600]  be fair let's give the communist chinese a little bit of a say here on the show right now here it is

[1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:49.040]  everything in one side of deals for 40 years scrutus in the chai comms total control of
[1:47:49.040 --> 1:47:53.680]  arrears minerals all the major deep water ports i mean we have strategically been set up for failure
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:58.160]  because in 1950 we were four percent of the world population had half the wealth and we were going
[1:47:58.160 --> 1:48:05.600]  to be able to make everybody wealthy and go to the stars by now but along the way chinese central we
[1:48:06.320 --> 1:48:12.320]  which means slave laboratories total control and if you look at communist china even watching
[1:48:12.320 --> 1:48:15.760]  posts had to admit six months ago what i was telling you five years ago i was told this five
[1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:20.720]  folks i know let's just leave it that they're investigating it that these confucian institutes
[1:48:20.720 --> 1:48:26.720]  run by the chinese government that they control all the major state run universities i mean they
[1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:32.160]  have a controlling interest i mean we're talking hundreds of millions in ut every year it got outlawed
[1:48:32.160 --> 1:48:41.040]  last year by trump over a hundred million a year pumped into that baby i mean that's why they spray
[1:48:41.040 --> 1:48:45.760]  paint antifa on the walls in austin we've shown you video you know down with trump down with white
[1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:53.920]  supremism up with china it's a malice system and so the reddit a major multimillion dollar controlling
[1:48:53.920 --> 1:49:01.680]  interest will put the article on screen for tv viewers in february they invest reddit banned in
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:06.720]  china is reportedly set to land 150 million investment from a chinese sponsored powerhouse
[1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:13.920]  house and that was right before they did it and guess what they landed it in fact what what they
[1:49:13.920 --> 1:49:20.080]  end up landing i saw the hundred fifty million number now you know how it works folks and so
[1:49:21.200 --> 1:49:27.520]  we don't get anything from anybody we don't get it from the mercers we don't get it from the
[1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:32.480]  coke brothers the the coke brothers fund democrats more i get it from you buying products
[1:49:32.480 --> 1:49:41.920]  you understand that folks and it takes a lot of money to run this place and i'm i have no problem
[1:49:41.920 --> 1:49:48.960]  that i've been paid over a year because i'm taking money i saved years ago to run this place and
[1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:52.960]  expand in the face of this and do a lot of things behind the scenes i'm gonna leave with that
[1:49:55.120 --> 1:50:00.560]  but the hand of alex jones is out there thanks to you and i've got punch in my strike because
[1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:05.360]  of you when you pray for us when you spread the word when you buy the product so listen to me
[1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:10.960]  most mainstream media is going bankrupt they were maneuvered into that position
[1:50:12.480 --> 1:50:16.080]  they were paid to lie that discredited them further that made them more dependent now they're
[1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:21.680]  just shutting down and conservative libertarian and nationalist media is super popular but it's
[1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:26.320]  being shut down and strangled we need your financial support you to take action we're up against the
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:33.040]  chai comms that make hitler look like an amateur when it comes to killing people we're gonna win
[1:50:33.040 --> 1:50:36.880]  though because we've got ideology and truth and god on our side but we need the funds to keep it

[1:51:03.760 --> 1:51:08.880]  point you can buy stuff that's gourmet that costs five times as much but the nexus of cost being good
[1:51:08.880 --> 1:51:14.400]  and quality being good it's like an x it's how i do it and who's reliable but they let me do these
[1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:19.600]  deals a couple times a year the 50 percent off that's it cost puts a lost leader for them to get

[1:51:23.280 --> 1:51:27.520]  well they had to shake up in the company over this years ago because all the other distributors
[1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:30.640]  couldn't get the deal i was getting because they didn't know how to make a deal like that and you
[1:51:30.640 --> 1:51:38.960]  weren't the biggest seller of the food boys but the point is is that i am and so you get the best

[1:51:49.440 --> 1:51:54.640]  cannot do a better deal because it's insurance you can eat and it's insurance into freedom
[1:51:54.640 --> 1:51:58.560]  and standing up against the globalist to keeping this on the air that absolutely
[1:51:58.560 --> 1:52:02.880]  outrages them and is an affront to their control freak tyranny they can't stand it
[1:52:04.080 --> 1:52:08.240]  and so we have all the supplements man they're amazing you got to get the fish oil and you
[1:52:08.240 --> 1:52:13.360]  got to take the knockout with it with the krill oil for dreams and sleep and and energy and
[1:52:13.360 --> 1:52:17.280]  the turbo force and the brain force and the super mobility and just all the products are
[1:52:17.280 --> 1:52:22.240]  incredible there's so many good ones there in four store dot com or triple eight two five three
[1:52:22.240 --> 1:52:26.240]  three one three nine triple eight two five three three one three nine but whatever you do take
[1:52:26.240 --> 1:52:30.640]  action sign up for auto ship you do every 15 days every month every two months up to nine months
[1:52:31.840 --> 1:52:36.000]  or that coffee you say you want every two months comes it's excellent really good price too
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:39.680]  and then it comes again in two months or three months or every month and then cancel any time
[1:52:39.680 --> 1:52:44.800]  with one click it's free you have an account on there one click and it doesn't come again no charge
[1:52:44.800 --> 1:52:48.640]  so it's a win-win-win but i did get myself in a position
[1:52:50.640 --> 1:52:57.360]  where we sell at such small margins and people wait for sales that it's putting me into a pickle
[1:52:57.920 --> 1:53:02.240]  so the plan is next year we're not going to do but 40 percent off as our best sales and the
[1:53:02.240 --> 1:53:07.040]  prices are going to say the same but i just can't do it anymore because take the cream that has the
[1:53:07.040 --> 1:53:11.040]  great nano silver silver salt in it that's in the silver wound gel but now in a cream with
[1:53:11.040 --> 1:53:15.600]  hyaluronic acid and all the these minerals it's just it's high in cream the women would pay 30
[1:53:15.600 --> 1:53:20.640]  bucks for just a hyaluronic acid that size of two because it's marked up seven times ours isn't
[1:53:21.600 --> 1:53:29.040]  when 50 off it's at cost right now okay then forward store.com we'll get a lot of stuff in
[1:53:29.040 --> 1:53:33.040]  there i want to thank you all for your support look at that 100 percent reviews that's for the
[1:53:33.040 --> 1:53:40.800]  naturally scented grapefruit okay let's go back to carpe donkdom and one of the top if not the top
[1:53:40.800 --> 1:53:45.440]  memer out there and i have to say being here since more prolific can you call that a meme yeah it's
[1:53:45.440 --> 1:53:49.680]  it's it's memes in uh and it's not about who's number one but it's good to celebrate that
[1:53:49.680 --> 1:53:54.800]  being yours isn't just the biggest pro trump guy he's hands down the biggest political cartoonist
[1:53:54.800 --> 1:53:59.440]  ever there's no doubt now in the five minutes we have left my my friend
[1:54:02.960 --> 1:54:08.000]  as number palpatine would say my little green friend um where are we going with the donald i
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:11.760]  know you're still trying to save it you heard my analogy the guy that keeps his dead wife's
[1:54:11.760 --> 1:54:18.400]  carcass you know in a trunk because he can't you know bear to bury her i'm not happy about this i
[1:54:18.400 --> 1:54:23.520]  tried to warn people didn't take action earlier the chai comms get what they pay for 150 mil bought
[1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:27.440]  the reddit the news all spun it the chai the chinese government bought the reddit and they're
[1:54:27.440 --> 1:54:33.280]  saying you don't have trump on that we're on your country you're dead i mean they kill people in mass
[1:54:33.280 --> 1:54:38.400]  over there that was out in the news this week so you're lucky from the reddit's owners gg ping
[1:54:38.400 --> 1:54:48.480]  that you're not dead son but it's true i mean they did buy uh it's no coincidence that within
[1:54:48.480 --> 1:54:58.320]  a month or so of uh of their investment that suddenly um a uh sub that has been uh under
[1:54:58.320 --> 1:55:05.200]  attack for four years suddenly just gets quarantined um but you know i wanted to touch on just a few
[1:55:05.200 --> 1:55:12.000]  things here is uh what i have what i have discovered or what i what i think i have condensed down
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:18.560]  is uh the model that reddit has been using for uh censorship and what what i think that other
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:24.480]  social media are starting to use as well uh the the first step is just to limit visibility um if you
[1:55:24.480 --> 1:55:33.280]  can limit where people can see you um you can you can then go on to the second point which is to
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:39.040]  limit engagement uh and when you limit the amount of engagement people get the response the retweets
[1:55:39.040 --> 1:55:47.040]  the the upvotes all those things uh you can create a feeling of just aloneness that every time you
[1:55:47.040 --> 1:55:52.000]  post something well only three people in the whole world liked it well that's not the way that it
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  works only maybe only three people saw it um they limit interaction uh they try to separate
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:03.120]  you into make you into your own group where you can't interact with other people you they have
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:11.280]  banned uh the ability of the donald to uh post links to other uh subs so like it put if politics
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:18.320]  decides that they're gonna run a uh a hit piece on the donald you can't link to it and say hey
[1:56:18.320 --> 1:56:22.560]  these are the things that's wrong you can't even link to it otherwise the sub could get banned
[1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:31.760]  the the fourth point uh was basically that uh once you have done the first three then you can
[1:56:31.760 --> 1:56:37.920]  just completely quarantine uh you can control all the information that goes uh out about that
[1:56:37.920 --> 1:56:42.320]  place or that person and then you can just wait for the whole thing to collapse and that's what
[1:56:42.320 --> 1:56:48.480]  they're doing right now is um they're hoping that people give up they're hoping that people move on uh
[1:56:49.760 --> 1:56:55.520]  again i i fully support people doing that but i also think we have to maintain a fight in the
[1:56:55.520 --> 1:57:01.280]  places where the fight is like twitter like facebook like all of the the social media
[1:57:01.280 --> 1:57:08.640]  that they want us to leave leaving is exactly the result that they're hoping for and i think
[1:57:08.640 --> 1:57:14.560]  that we have to stay in fight we should explore alternatives and we should promote alternatives
[1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:20.000]  but we need to stay in fight i one trillion to infinity agree with you let's come back into
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:24.720]  one more segment but what matt rudge said is right build your own sustained infrastructure
[1:57:25.440 --> 1:57:29.760]  only use those other platforms to push people back to it because they're going to take it away
[1:57:29.760 --> 1:57:34.160]  he was told in a meeting with the supreme court justice the whole plan four years ago he told us
[1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:39.040]  almost and it all came true this is not like the supreme court justice guessed it they have
[1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:42.800]  international conferences where they try to get the supreme court justices to go along with this
[1:57:42.800 --> 1:57:49.600]  we'll be right back i like yes i got a plug for the patriot point second oh thanks i got 180
[1:57:49.600 --> 1:57:54.000]  dollars so far this year and i feel like i'm stealing from you i buy so much in the store
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:56.640]  because i mean i don't want to give that money to walmart i don't want to give that money to
[1:57:56.640 --> 1:58:00.480]  people who are going to donate it to causes i don't believe in so i'd rather give that money to you
[1:58:00.480 --> 1:58:05.120]  and i'm getting quality product the products that i do receive have changed my life i mean the x2
[1:58:05.120 --> 1:58:09.200]  has really done a lot for me i've lost weight my brain works a whole lot better i think my
[1:58:09.200 --> 1:58:14.400]  kids they use the toothpaste my son used to get these little sore throats and he puts x2 in water
[1:58:14.400 --> 1:58:18.400]  and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore throat uh he'll start let me break this down for you i want
[1:58:18.400 --> 1:58:22.960]  high quality stuff in there i want a good price but i've kind of habituated everybody to where
[1:58:22.960 --> 1:58:27.440]  everybody buys when it's 50 off i'm making two dollars on the toothpaste 50 off and so it's the
[1:58:27.440 --> 1:58:31.760]  same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but
[1:58:31.760 --> 1:58:36.480]  listen when people get the patriot points a lot of times it makes things a loss later because if
[1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:40.960]  you're already getting 10 off because you're on autoship then we're doing 50 off and then you do
[1:58:40.960 --> 1:58:44.800]  something like that uh we have patriot points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support
[1:58:46.880 --> 1:58:51.520]  there are a few things in this universe that are a sure bet but i'm here to tell you the products
[1:58:51.520 --> 1:58:57.920]  that in four wars life dot com are we go out we find out what is the best rated best tested
[1:58:58.640 --> 1:59:04.480]  most loved most documented substances that god gave us through mother nature and then we
[1:59:05.120 --> 1:59:09.920]  make it even stronger even better and lower the price now turmeric has been known for thousands
[1:59:09.920 --> 1:59:15.440]  of years to help with inflammation headaches it's good for the immune system so many things it sells
[1:59:15.440 --> 1:59:24.160]  itself but normal turmerics only has three to five percent curcuminoid the active enzyme or system in
[1:59:24.160 --> 1:59:31.360]  the plant originally obviously from india well body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95 percent
[1:59:31.360 --> 1:59:36.560]  curcuminoid level that's got other natural things that help boost it help your body absorb it and
[1:59:36.560 --> 1:59:42.080]  that's why people absolutely love it i'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet
[1:59:42.080 --> 1:59:45.200]  50 off on bodies at it for us live dot com
[1:59:49.280 --> 1:59:51.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:59:57.120 --> 2:00:02.320]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:00:02.320 --> 2:00:10.720]  we are back live broadcasting worldwide and
[2:00:12.080 --> 2:00:15.120]  you guys print me all those articles because i remember reading that the reddit was being
[2:00:15.120 --> 2:00:19.360]  bought by communist china because they run their tech companies and i forgot that it was even in
[2:00:19.360 --> 2:00:25.040]  mainstream news and then that's why they were censoring and got rid of the donald basically
[2:00:25.840 --> 2:00:29.360]  but they did it by strangling it and shutting it down and putting it in quarantine they put it in
[2:00:29.360 --> 2:00:34.240]  them reeducation camp hoping everybody would be reeducated in there to you know oh you're allowed
[2:00:34.240 --> 2:00:41.200]  to talk to people millions visit you you like democrat and kami china now you'll be allowed to
[2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:46.880]  to talk for all of you say what we say it's like the few christians that have been arrested in china
[2:00:46.880 --> 2:00:52.080]  and killed the new bibles they have are mouths red book and the ten commandments are quotes from
[2:00:52.080 --> 2:00:58.720]  mal i'm not joking that that happened last week info wars dot com wrote about it so i agree with
[2:00:58.720 --> 2:01:03.600]  carpe donkton it'd be great to be able to use twitter and facebook and reddit and all that but
[2:01:03.600 --> 2:01:08.720]  they're in the process of phasing us out it's not just quote accompanying decision it's oppressing
[2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:12.880]  a whole group of people it's a political takeover and if we don't have the will to sit there and
[2:01:12.880 --> 2:01:17.680]  stand up to it like dodo birds that have never been hunted but had freedom so long if we don't
[2:01:17.680 --> 2:01:21.680]  have an immune system to say no to that we want foreign governments that are that are mass murderers
[2:01:21.680 --> 2:01:26.240]  and take over our communication systems because the president's you know 73 and each mcdonald's
[2:01:26.240 --> 2:01:30.800]  all day and thinks fox is the only thing on the planet then we deserve it americans deserve it
[2:01:30.800 --> 2:01:35.920]  but i agree with you it'd be nice if we could be on those platforms you know like they jack into the
[2:01:35.920 --> 2:01:40.080]  matrix and you know go back and forth between the matrix in the real world but uh carpe what do you
[2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:49.760]  say to that well i mean it's uh i understand exactly what you're saying that uh this it's a hard
[2:01:49.760 --> 2:01:56.960]  it's a hard line line to uh you know straddle um staying staying in there and being abused all the
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:02:03.360]  time um and not getting not being as effective as you could be because of the censorship um
[2:02:04.240 --> 2:02:07.440]  but you do need to stay in there and fight i mean you still need to try no i agree but the
[2:02:07.440 --> 2:02:11.920]  listeners need to understand that we we but if we always did our content on our own sites and
[2:02:11.920 --> 2:02:16.240]  promoted them everybody from promoted twitter and reddick and facebook with their own already built
[2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:20.800]  sites and they're advertising money on the side of their trucks on their websites on their cars
[2:02:20.800 --> 2:02:25.760]  we made these people and now they pull the rug out from under us if we'd listen to drudge everybody
[2:02:25.760 --> 2:02:29.920]  would have built their own systems we'd have an original good truly diverse internet it's all
[2:02:29.920 --> 2:02:35.600]  i'm saying yes we're in their trap now yeah and you know something that i've talked about for a
[2:02:35.600 --> 2:02:41.920]  while is that you know 10 years ago was the time that we needed big people to invest in tech
[2:02:41.920 --> 2:02:47.680]  and they didn't do it all the people that invested in tech 10 15 years ago were leftists and of course
[2:02:47.680 --> 2:02:50.400]  they wanted to control everything and they knew what it was going to be yeah they can
[2:02:50.400 --> 2:02:56.400]  spiral this control our lives exactly so i mean the the point that we're at now i i think we need
[2:02:56.400 --> 2:03:02.320]  to uh we need to do major investment in in those those areas we need to build our own infrastructure
[2:03:02.320 --> 2:03:08.000]  i it's going to be really hard to overcome the infrastructure that's already there but uh once
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:13.600]  once they tighten down and they they get rid of most of us off of these platforms there'll be nowhere
[2:03:13.600 --> 2:03:18.720]  to go if we don't build the infrastructure first and they're and it will only be easier once we're
[2:03:18.720 --> 2:03:25.600]  off those platforms to separate uh to uh make make everyone confused turn people against each other
[2:03:25.600 --> 2:03:31.920]  things like that uh we wanted to buy tech is already going after gab and and me and and everybody
[2:03:31.920 --> 2:03:35.680]  they want us shut down they want a monopoly i mean it's not just facebook didn't want google
[2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:41.360]  didn't want google plus they don't want anything right and and there's uh there's something to
[2:03:41.360 --> 2:03:46.960]  be said for that that uh big tech allows some of these places to continue to exist because
[2:03:48.240 --> 2:03:51.840]  it's it's a place where you can say well look we've got this we've got this place we got gab
[2:03:51.840 --> 2:03:57.200]  you can go to well they want you there because you're not effective there nobody else there
[2:03:57.200 --> 2:04:03.040]  except for your own little bubble is there so i i love these these platforms that uh are creating
[2:04:03.040 --> 2:04:08.720]  new spaces but you still have to fight on on uh you have to fight on there but it's a chicken or egg
[2:04:08.720 --> 2:04:14.400]  what i'm saying is you use gab or telegram or info wars or band on video as a place to back
[2:04:14.400 --> 2:04:19.840]  your stuff up it's always there and then use the enemy platform to promote that as you do sorties
[2:04:19.840 --> 2:04:25.440]  into their operations absolutely absolutely you you use their platforms against them and use them
[2:04:25.440 --> 2:04:32.320]  to the best of your ability and uh we just we need to create uh platforms like memeworld.com uh that
[2:04:32.320 --> 2:04:38.880]  can go into the future uh after things are shut down well said let's do a few more minutes then
[2:04:38.880 --> 2:04:43.280]  open the phones up and i gotta go a few more minutes with carpe dantum on what the dark age
[2:04:43.280 --> 2:04:47.760]  will look like which is just a few months away i mean everything's almost shut down now i mean
[2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:51.920]  info wars is one of the few places memeworld.com one of the few places band on video one of the
[2:04:51.920 --> 2:04:57.200]  few places dredgerport.com few places we sold secret 12 for four years and it was our number

[2:06:39.280 --> 2:06:44.480]  i read this stuff i know this stuff it was even in the wall street journal i've got the
[2:06:44.480 --> 2:06:49.920]  articles right here we can put them on screen 150 million plus dollars invested in february
[2:06:49.920 --> 2:06:57.440]  by a chinese communist controlled chi-com company and then they ban the reddit subreddit donald
[2:06:57.440 --> 2:07:02.320]  and freeze it put it in quote quarantine where only the people already on it can basically use it
[2:07:02.320 --> 2:07:07.280]  other people can't find it and now they're just shutting it down it's dead and that's a scandal
[2:07:07.280 --> 2:07:14.240]  that trump's number one website bigger than his campaign site that subreddit they have an mit study
[2:07:14.240 --> 2:07:18.160]  where the internet gets its memes from and they said most of it from the donald subreddit

[2:07:54.400 --> 2:08:01.840]  but we're live right now we're talking about all of this this is all unfolding this is real
[2:08:03.360 --> 2:08:08.000]  and so we're here and and and that they're going down to individual accounts now they're
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:14.400]  saying people can't show women at a shooting range the republicans can't run ads
[2:08:16.800 --> 2:08:20.800]  that say we're looking for strong women to join the party anything effective is banned and i'm sorry

[2:08:53.120 --> 2:08:58.960]  system it's sick and here we are carpe donkton watching it happen and i know trumps had you
[2:08:58.960 --> 2:09:02.880]  the white house you've been there a few times and you're a great guy and trumps i love trump
[2:09:02.880 --> 2:09:08.320]  but my heavens to betsey i know what he does i'm people that know him well he watches fox and seeing
[2:09:08.320 --> 2:09:14.240]  in and he reads the new york times and he visits drudge sometimes and he and you know in the secret
[2:09:14.240 --> 2:09:18.960]  service shows him clips and full wars talk to some folks just last week about that but
[2:09:20.640 --> 2:09:24.720]  and their big fear is keep alex away from him and keep you away from him and we know what's
[2:09:24.720 --> 2:09:30.800]  going on compadre and you know i've been offered the money people think i sell people hey i got
[2:09:30.800 --> 2:09:35.360]  offered 10 million dollars a year 15 years ago to sell out people that's that you never that's
[2:09:35.360 --> 2:09:41.920]  so much money folks info wars is gigantic even then they they spend hundreds of millions of dollars
[2:09:41.920 --> 2:09:51.120]  a year from sorrows just propping up things like vox or vice vox gets 250 mil from nbc
[2:09:51.760 --> 2:09:57.040]  disney put two billion last time i checked in device so they could do anti alex jones and
[2:09:57.040 --> 2:10:06.480]  anti trump videos till the cows come home we're operating on 20 something million dollars a year
[2:10:07.440 --> 2:10:10.560]  and it's getting a much bigger effect folks but think about that i have to sell
[2:10:10.560 --> 2:10:14.560]  40 million dollars a product because on average that's a hundred percent markup and we're not
[2:10:14.560 --> 2:10:20.080]  even doing that now to go to info wars store dot com folks stand against the chai comms hollywood
[2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:24.560]  all of we can stay on the here we can do it but only when you support us financially and get great
[2:10:24.560 --> 2:10:28.640]  products already need and only when you spread the damn word and i want to thank matt drudge
[2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:33.200]  he's been linking us every day and i got to tell you that massive traffic and info wars is sending
[2:10:33.200 --> 2:10:38.800]  us a lot of the new people we are able to deprogram and show what's happening so thank you matt drudge
[2:10:38.800 --> 2:10:43.120]  but matt drudge understands this is a fight i haven't even gotten to the story he linked to today
[2:10:43.120 --> 2:10:46.560]  about what facebook's up to will do that next segment then i'll open the phones up but
[2:10:47.360 --> 2:10:50.800]  carpe don't come i keep interrupting you got five minutes to recap it all to talk about it
[2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:56.000]  and what we're facing and the chai comm government that mentally runs and owns that company 150 mil
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:05.120]  buys the reddit takes control of it kills donald and then we're talking about this this crypt uh
[2:11:05.120 --> 2:11:08.800]  you know that people are still wanting to keep going and i get it but it's gone brother it's
[2:11:08.800 --> 2:11:13.440]  gone people need to go to meme world dot com and they need to abandon ship and go to other places
[2:11:13.440 --> 2:11:17.680]  now and everybody needs to stay on the reddit hey come here before it's too late so you at least
[2:11:17.680 --> 2:11:21.920]  get some of the people everybody knows oh don't do that or you'll get banned too we're already
[2:11:21.920 --> 2:11:29.120]  self-censoring prisoners this is the road to destruction go ahead well you know to to uh the
[2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:36.480]  credit of uh the donald the the metrics have have actually maintained um over the last few months
[2:11:36.480 --> 2:11:44.480]  even in in uh quarantine they've still got new subscribers but um again that it's we're going
[2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:51.760]  into another point where there's a uh an appeal and every single time you do an appeal and you lose
[2:11:51.760 --> 2:11:57.840]  the time doubles so it started out with a 30 day quarantine then it went to a 60 day if uh if this one
[2:11:57.840 --> 2:12:03.440]  is denied uh we're going to be up to i think january is the next time that you can think how
[2:12:03.440 --> 2:12:09.040]  authoritarian that is they call it a quarantine like we're a disease gosh these people are sick
[2:12:09.760 --> 2:12:13.680]  yeah i mean they're they're not even they're not even hiding what what it is i mean they're
[2:12:13.680 --> 2:12:19.200]  they're keeping us away from everyone right now they've been doing that for for four years they've
[2:12:19.200 --> 2:12:25.520]  been uh pretending like we we don't exist they've been pretending that uh so you're in a death camp
[2:12:25.520 --> 2:12:30.320]  they just haven't killed you yet yeah you know they've they've been marching us around in circles
[2:12:30.320 --> 2:12:37.520]  for uh for four years um now again i want to stress this point that that the amount of people that
[2:12:37.520 --> 2:12:45.520]  still visit the donald is it's greater than uh the the viewership of fox news on on an average
[2:12:45.520 --> 2:12:49.760]  night i mean there's there's millions and millions and millions of people that visit that site every
[2:12:49.760 --> 2:12:52.880]  single day and trump won't do a damn thing the chinese government came and did it i mean the big
[2:12:52.880 --> 2:12:59.760]  fat dragon's like it's mine now haha yeah well i mean that that's something that we need we need
[2:12:59.760 --> 2:13:06.720]  to get his attention about um i i think that uh i think that it is high time that uh we have
[2:13:07.680 --> 2:13:14.800]  him talking about um one of his his greatest assets um you you talked about the memes and
[2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:21.360]  the and the study that uh was done about where memes come from the donald is is responsible for
[2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:30.080]  for at least 15 of the most viral things that president trump has ever tweeted um i mean to be
[2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:38.640]  fair like six six six to eight of them were mine but um you know the uh the wrestling gif that uh
[2:13:38.640 --> 2:13:46.160]  that sparked the cnn blackmail that came from the donald um all of the things that uh um
[2:13:46.160 --> 2:13:52.160]  um that something wicked has done has come from the donald the the the batman video uh that got
[2:13:52.160 --> 2:13:59.280]  removed from his channel came from um the donald the memes come from there i i am sure that that uh
[2:13:59.280 --> 2:14:07.600]  that greenland trump uh trump greenland uh trump tower picture came from the donald where he said
[2:14:07.600 --> 2:14:12.400]  i promised not to where he said i promised not to do this right exactly all of those viral
[2:14:12.400 --> 2:14:17.120]  moments they all come from this place and most of the memes that you're going to see running
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:22.240]  around twitter are a day old from the donald um i mean other than the stuff that i put out because
[2:14:22.240 --> 2:14:26.000]  i put it out on twitter at the same time i do everything and again i just want to win and
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:29.840]  that's why i was so happy to hear you were building meme world and why i'm trying to promote it so
[2:14:29.840 --> 2:14:33.840]  that we don't lose the donald but they've already done it to a great extent and then and then again
[2:14:33.840 --> 2:14:39.120]  president trump uh they've got jim hoffed over at gateway punnett great folks saying hey what
[2:14:39.120 --> 2:14:44.000]  happened to drudge well what happened to trump's all i'm saying is that we need trump to take action
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:49.040]  this is a foreign government comes in buys the most effective place bigger than trump's twitter
[2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:53.280]  probably the chinese government basically took the equivalent of trump's twitter away from him
[2:14:53.280 --> 2:14:59.600]  and if he puts up with it it really upsets me well and yeah and it upsets me as well that uh i mean
[2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:07.600]  the donald is largely responsible for for trump's election um without without the donald i don't think
[2:15:07.600 --> 2:15:14.480]  he he uh gets as close um well it's like fingers make up a fist i mean drudge would be the thumb
[2:15:14.480 --> 2:15:19.280]  info wars would be the the index finger the donald would be the middle finger literally you know
[2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:22.800]  flipping off his tab was right and then all the other grass rich stuff facebook's the other
[2:15:22.800 --> 2:15:27.040]  fingers and things and and exactly and and youtube and they're taking it all the way they're taking
[2:15:27.040 --> 2:15:32.560]  it all the way except drudge drudge is the only thing that hasn't been crippled what and we're
[2:15:32.560 --> 2:15:38.240]  letting them and we can't let him hey you're amazing we love you um memeworld.com we hope they

[2:21:53.200 --> 2:22:00.480]  yeah that's the truth there are a lot of good people left in this nation but the churches have
[2:22:00.480 --> 2:22:09.520]  been taken over the systems have been taken over and people don't have any fighting spirit except
[2:22:09.520 --> 2:22:17.840]  to fight against anything good that's all it is period they don't have the spark i was watching
[2:22:17.840 --> 2:22:24.400]  the west that pbs documentary uh uh while i was on the elliptical this weekend and it was just the
[2:22:24.400 --> 2:22:29.920]  black and white photos of everybody's eyes it didn't matter there were chinese coulis or white
[2:22:29.920 --> 2:22:34.400]  people or black people or native americans in the black and white photos you take black and white
[2:22:34.400 --> 2:22:38.720]  photos today and they don't have that look in the eyes i mean you can almost see the color in people's
[2:22:38.720 --> 2:22:46.240]  eyes they were so powerful and then you just see it and it's like the soul has been sucked out of
[2:22:46.240 --> 2:22:56.640]  people they're in a mesmerized sleep state and medically they are when you watch television all
[2:22:56.640 --> 2:23:02.000]  day particularly that isn't interactive or you get on the internet it creates a flicker rate
[2:23:03.680 --> 2:23:11.120]  that just eases people into suspended disbelief and then they're programmed and then they're gone
[2:23:11.120 --> 2:23:16.320]  they're gone they're gone to where now really all we're doing is conditioning people in a way it's
[2:23:16.320 --> 2:23:20.880]  like oh yeah world government yeah the chai comms you know own reddit yeah they bought it up and
[2:23:20.880 --> 2:23:26.400]  shut the president up and the president just sits there in the white house and puts up with it
[2:23:28.880 --> 2:23:30.160]  oh they're a private company
[2:23:34.400 --> 2:23:40.240]  and the chinese government has a nine hundred billion dollars a year of our money they steal

[2:24:13.920 --> 2:24:17.840]  up we'll try to take some phone calls and hope to have jesus always informative always amazing
[2:24:17.840 --> 2:24:23.040]  is coming on the show so let's go ahead and go to that report the deals with people like
[2:24:23.040 --> 2:24:31.920]  gretta thunberg here we go some of the models suggests to dr mazlowski that there is a 75
[2:24:31.920 --> 2:24:42.480]  percent chance that the entire north polar ice cab during summer during some of the summer months
[2:24:42.480 --> 2:24:50.320]  could be completely ice free within the next five to seven years climate change madness is upon us
[2:24:50.320 --> 2:24:56.160]  without any consideration of the consequences they will surely face a generation blinded by
[2:24:56.160 --> 2:25:02.080]  junk science and blame accepts the carbon taxation scheme of a global elite class largely
[2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:07.360]  responsible for the very pollution and erosion plaguing the earth is someone who already struggles
[2:25:07.360 --> 2:25:11.840]  with anxiety and struggles with depression from my understanding of climate change and what i
[2:25:11.840 --> 2:25:16.560]  experience watching our government knowingly perpetuate the climate crisis is extremely
[2:25:16.560 --> 2:25:21.760]  overwhelming i wrestle with this anxiety every day from the moment that i wake up in the morning
[2:25:21.760 --> 2:25:27.520]  to the moment i fall asleep at night if we keep going on with business as usual both hunders and
[2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:34.000]  new york the places where my family and i are from will forever be lost to the sea february 2018
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:40.240]  was colder than february 1998 if someone is tempted to argue that the reason for recent
[2:25:40.240 --> 2:25:45.840]  record cooling periods is that global temperatures are getting more volatile it's not true the
[2:25:45.840 --> 2:25:52.400]  volatility of monthly global average temperatures since 2000 is only two thirds what it was from
[2:25:52.400 --> 2:25:59.520]  1880 to 1999 add to that evidence from nasa reveals that the earth is entering a solar minimum
[2:25:59.520 --> 2:26:05.760]  basically a low point in sunspot activity and the growing possibility of what has been known as the
[2:26:05.760 --> 2:26:11.840]  monitor minimum which would drive temperatures below the average and could produce a mini ice age
[2:26:11.840 --> 2:26:17.040]  failed presidential candidate and worthless new york city mayor deblazio guided by the
[2:26:17.040 --> 2:26:23.040]  rockefeller new world order technocratic communist vision for america allowed the students of new
[2:26:23.040 --> 2:26:30.480]  york city to skip school and pour onto the streets to embrace their misguided concern for the earth
[2:26:30.480 --> 2:26:36.560]  creating a wave of copycat protests across the country if these kids want to know what kind of
[2:26:36.560 --> 2:26:41.600]  controversy they actually face just take a look at the carbon pricing scheme in australia introduced
[2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:47.280]  by the gelard labor government in 2011 as the clean energy act of 2011 which came into effect
[2:26:47.280 --> 2:26:54.080]  in july of 2012 the scheme was repealed in july of 2014 it did very little to curb any investment
[2:26:54.080 --> 2:27:00.400]  in coal as it was intended but it did make a lot of australians very angry and i got no money because
[2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:05.600]  i've got a lunatic government that's been putting taxes on me to call the planet it's a form of socialism
[2:27:05.600 --> 2:27:11.280]  masquerading as environmentalism it may well be as you say michael that most australian economists
[2:27:11.280 --> 2:27:16.720]  think that a carbon tax from emissions trading scheme is the way to go um maybe that's a comment
[2:27:16.720 --> 2:27:22.800]  on the quality of our economists meanwhile the propagandized media drills it in increasingly
[2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:26.880]  people are much more comfortable saying we've got wildfires like we hadn't seen we've got drought
[2:27:26.880 --> 2:27:30.320]  like we haven't seen we've got flooding like we haven't seen we've got hurricanes like we
[2:27:30.320 --> 2:27:34.080]  haven't seen we've got melting like we haven't seen and there might be some connection and it
[2:27:34.080 --> 2:27:39.760]  might be climate how are we going to screw the people how are we going to kill indigenous cultures
[2:27:39.760 --> 2:27:45.760]  how are we going to mess with the amazon as the old scam rears its ugly head again a reinvigorated
[2:27:45.760 --> 2:27:52.240]  call for the so-called expert economist support of al gore and the world bank's carbon tax as the
[2:27:52.240 --> 2:27:58.400]  globe gazette reported us economists have joined together to recommend attacks on carbon emissions
[2:27:58.400 --> 2:28:04.880]  as the most effective way of controlling carbon emissions and mitigating climate change recommending
[2:28:04.880 --> 2:28:10.320]  a carbon tax offers the most cost effective lever to reduce carbon emissions at the scale
[2:28:10.320 --> 2:28:16.320]  and speed that is necessary a carbon tax should increase every year until emission reduction
[2:28:16.320 --> 2:28:23.600]  goals are met a sufficiently robust and gradually rising carbon tax will replace the needs for
[2:28:23.600 --> 2:28:30.480]  various carbon regulations this is a recipe for economic collapse brought to you from the hidden
[2:28:30.480 --> 2:28:37.120]  halls of bill berg the united nations and a host of think tanks hell bent on reducing the united
[2:28:37.120 --> 2:28:45.040]  states to a pile of rubble while the us taxpayer goes all in on their own demise john bound reporting

[2:33:24.320 --> 2:33:29.120]  loved as you were broadcasting worldwide i'm your host alex jones and president trump gave an
[2:33:29.120 --> 2:33:34.000]  incredible speech this morning that we're gonna be playing more of in the next hour we've already
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:39.360]  mentioned some of there's a very important article by jamie white that's up on info wars dot com that
[2:33:39.360 --> 2:33:46.240]  needs to go extremely viral trump to the u n the future does not belong to globalists the future
[2:33:46.240 --> 2:33:51.040]  belongs to sovereign independent nations that is just so beautiful our uncorporate media saying
[2:33:51.040 --> 2:33:56.480]  nation states shouldn't even exist now and then he goes on on globalism and how criminal it is he
[2:33:56.480 --> 2:34:02.560]  gets into open borders big tech censorship and endless wars and says he's taking action on all
[2:34:02.560 --> 2:34:07.440]  of it he's been trying to block a new war with iran this is an amazing time lord christopher
[2:34:07.440 --> 2:34:12.400]  montan's going to join us on gretta thunberg and the way she's being rejected so much here in her
[2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:18.160]  bizarre hitlarian rants with the viral video we have posted on info wars dot com but first off
[2:34:18.160 --> 2:34:23.520]  let's go ahead and play this clip of trump telling it like it is against world government we've come
[2:34:23.520 --> 2:34:27.600]  so far they denied world government all these years and now it's here and now we're saying we
[2:34:27.600 --> 2:34:32.240]  don't want it we don't want foreign multinational corporations ally with the chai comms buying
[2:34:32.240 --> 2:34:39.120]  us up and treating us like we're chinese slaves like they've done reddit here it is looking around
[2:34:39.120 --> 2:34:51.360]  and all over this large magnificent planet the truth is plain to see if you want freedom
[2:34:52.400 --> 2:35:01.040]  take pride in your country if you want democracy hold on to your sovereignty and if you want peace
[2:35:01.040 --> 2:35:11.760]  love your nation wise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country
[2:35:11.760 --> 2:35:21.120]  first the future does not belong to globalists the future belongs to patriots the future belongs
[2:35:21.120 --> 2:35:29.200]  to sovereign and independent nations who protect their citizens respect their neighbors and honor
[2:35:29.200 --> 2:35:36.720]  the differences that make each country special and unique instead of transferring our power to
[2:35:36.720 --> 2:35:41.920]  unelected globalist organizations with front people like redda thunberg the autistic
[2:35:43.680 --> 2:35:47.840]  victim really i think of the brainwashing we've seen christopher montany is the leading expert i
[2:35:47.840 --> 2:35:52.320]  would say if everybody out there even martin morano was advised congress of course on the
[2:35:52.320 --> 2:35:57.520]  fraud or the carbon tax and all of it and they're screeching and squawking and abuse of the children
[2:35:57.520 --> 2:36:02.400]  trying to tell them the world's ending now they're saying in ten years beto and others are so i'm
[2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:07.520]  glad you could join us mr. mongton lord mongton to get into all of this because this is an amazing
[2:36:07.520 --> 2:36:11.200]  moment i want to get into redda thunberg you're someone of an expert on her her mother says she
[2:36:11.200 --> 2:36:16.720]  saw you can see the devil gas the plants breathe carbon dioxide but wow what do you make of trump's
[2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:24.720]  united nation speech well this was one of the finest speeches ever to have been delivered at that
[2:36:24.720 --> 2:36:31.200]  largely useless organization the united nations has long outlived any usefulness it once had
[2:36:31.200 --> 2:36:37.360]  it's trying to substitute itself for individual national governments it's using the climate
[2:36:37.360 --> 2:36:44.400]  change scam as one of its major weapons in doing that and mr trump isn't buying any of it and he
[2:36:44.400 --> 2:36:53.600]  made a speech which was at once statesman-like but also ringingly patriotic and there is a man who
[2:36:53.600 --> 2:37:01.840]  is saying to his own countrymen whatever you may think of me i will stand up for you and for my
[2:37:01.840 --> 2:37:09.840]  country and i'll stand up against these global creeps who are trying to take over and who elects
[2:37:09.840 --> 2:37:16.400]  the united nations nobody who elects the european union nobody elects the european commission it's
[2:37:16.400 --> 2:37:22.880]  an unelected body which has absolute power or who elects the law of the sea conference who elects the
[2:37:22.880 --> 2:37:31.040]  world bank who elects the international monetary fund nobody every time power is transferred from
[2:37:31.040 --> 2:37:36.960]  elected hands here to unelected hands at these various international and increasingly global
[2:37:36.960 --> 2:37:44.880]  bodies democracy dies a little and that is the main purport of what mr trump was saying he was
[2:37:44.880 --> 2:37:50.880]  saying if you want democracy then you have to look for it in your nation because you will not find it
[2:37:50.880 --> 2:37:56.960]  in any of these international organizations and the only way the united nations can in my view be
[2:37:56.960 --> 2:38:05.120]  allowed to survive at all is if in future all the delegates to that body are elected by the peoples
[2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:09.760]  of the countries that constituted and that's going to be difficult in countries like china where
[2:38:09.760 --> 2:38:14.400]  they're not used to electing anyone well they're going to have to get used to that idea because
[2:38:14.400 --> 2:38:22.080]  otherwise the un has no future and in effect mr trump was giving it notice you either become
[2:38:22.080 --> 2:38:34.560]  democratic or you fail and you go now we had you on today very well said lord montan to get into
[2:38:34.560 --> 2:38:39.520]  gretta thunberg you're quite the expert on this is breaking news on info wars dot com
[2:38:39.520 --> 2:38:45.680]  gretta parents reported the child services in sweden this morning uh so that's going on
[2:38:45.680 --> 2:38:50.560]  early today a private person posted pictures of her concern about gretta thunberg for child abuse
[2:38:50.560 --> 2:38:55.120]  of the parents the report was allegedly sent out of the district administrator for stock home and is
[2:38:55.120 --> 2:39:00.240]  being taken very seriously i'd say she has stock home syndrome and all people talk about how she
[2:39:00.240 --> 2:39:06.400]  just seems completely crazed wild eyed very hateful she sees trump come in under the un and
[2:39:06.400 --> 2:39:11.520]  she's right behind him and looks at him with just a what i'd call a psychotic look she's up there
[2:39:11.520 --> 2:39:17.280]  hating everyone blaming everyone saying we're watching you we're coming after you i mean
[2:39:17.280 --> 2:39:23.440]  she is a very deranged person right now you're an expert on her how would you quantify this this
[2:39:23.440 --> 2:39:33.600]  young lady i think she is a victim a victim of ruthless marxist indoctrination in the schools
[2:39:33.600 --> 2:39:38.320]  the marxists who were originally behind this global warming scam they are the ones who are
[2:39:38.320 --> 2:39:44.800]  driving it they can't believe that the west is destroying its economies at the rate that it is
[2:39:44.800 --> 2:39:51.520]  doing and now they're even using children just as fascists and communists always have you had the
[2:39:51.520 --> 2:39:57.760]  hitler youth you had the comsul in russia you had the young chinese communists all of these
[2:39:57.760 --> 2:40:05.120]  organizations which regimented children and exploited them for the political ends of
[2:40:05.120 --> 2:40:10.720]  adults and i think i feel very sorry for gretta sunbag of course she'll end up with the Nobel
[2:40:10.720 --> 2:40:15.920]  peace prize and everybody will say what a wonderful thing it is that she's trying to save the planet
[2:40:15.920 --> 2:40:22.880]  i think we should not too much question her motives we should question those who indoctrinated
[2:40:22.880 --> 2:40:29.360]  her so completely that she cannot realize the value of somebody with whom she disagrees such as
[2:40:29.360 --> 2:40:36.080]  mr trump so i don't think we should get into trying to psychoanalyze her by looking at the
[2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:42.480]  face of hatred which she's just put up there small children tend to put on faces like that
[2:40:42.480 --> 2:40:47.200]  and it doesn't mean that they are full of hatred it just means they haven't yet learnt
[2:40:47.200 --> 2:40:53.840]  to control their facial muscles and control their emotions but what we should say is this that she
[2:40:53.840 --> 2:41:00.080]  and the millions of others who took to the streets and started to say that they were going on strike
[2:41:00.080 --> 2:41:04.880]  against their own education which is a pretty silly thing to go on strike about for the sake of
[2:41:04.880 --> 2:41:12.880]  saving the planet first of all it's not going to do any good secondly nothing of this is necessary
[2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:18.640]  a brilliant paper just published by professor patrick frank a good friend of mine at the stanford
[2:41:18.640 --> 2:41:24.960]  linear accelerator has demonstrated formally and beyond all dispute it was reviewed by the most
[2:41:24.960 --> 2:41:30.560]  eminent people on the other side of the case and they could not fault it that the climate models on
[2:41:30.560 --> 2:41:38.240]  which the case that gretta sunberg is arguing are based are incapable of telling you the time of day
[2:41:38.240 --> 2:41:41.920]  let alone telling you what the weather is going to be like in a hundred years time

[2:47:44.400 --> 2:47:50.640]  oh destroyer when the war room starts uh in about an hour and 13 minutes he's gonna air the whole
[2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:55.680]  speech in his first hour in fact that's exactly enough time to do it because there's 15 minutes
[2:47:55.680 --> 2:47:59.680]  of ads each hour so he's gonna air the whole speech maybe going to the second hour and
[2:47:59.680 --> 2:48:04.240]  analyze it he went after big tech censorship went after communism went after big corporations
[2:48:04.240 --> 2:48:08.480]  trying to get rid of national sovereignty he struck at the root and his lord christopher montan just
[2:48:08.480 --> 2:48:14.720]  said i was watching him we played the clip because he's on the tv over there even when he's not on
[2:48:14.720 --> 2:48:21.120]  live on air and i saw real satisfaction gleam in his eyes and i was getting chills even though
[2:48:21.120 --> 2:48:26.240]  i'd read the transcript i hadn't seen it yet and because globalism is pure authoritarianism it was
[2:48:26.240 --> 2:48:31.680]  a hitlerian plan the eu was and to know how evil it is and how anti-humanist i'm getting
[2:48:31.680 --> 2:48:39.280]  literally chills like i only get a pleasure when i see my children born and they're healthy
[2:48:39.280 --> 2:48:45.600]  i mean i'm having major endorphin releases right now i'm as high as a kite and we should be because
[2:48:45.600 --> 2:48:50.800]  trump doing this means he's for real and this is this is so devastating these authoritarians
[2:48:50.800 --> 2:48:54.800]  because as lord montan said it's a very few billionaire globalist that want this
[2:48:54.800 --> 2:49:01.840]  panopticonic carbon tax bloomberg uh you know a few others they want to be able to run this and control
[2:49:01.840 --> 2:49:05.840]  this and then they've got foreign governments aiding and funding it like china and saudi arabia
[2:49:05.840 --> 2:49:11.600]  because they want our fossil fuels shut down lord montan gretta funberg talks about billions
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:15.920]  are going to die the sea bubbles are rising the same old line but if they cut all carbon
[2:49:15.920 --> 2:49:20.400]  use wouldn't it kill billions the studies show i mean it's just insane how evil globalism is
[2:49:20.400 --> 2:49:28.240]  let's get the figures straight it's already killing tens of millions every year in africa
[2:49:28.240 --> 2:49:36.880]  because since 2010 the world bank the unelected world bank the globalist world bank has refused
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:42.800]  to lend to poor countries in sub-saharan africa desperate to give electricity to their people
[2:49:42.800 --> 2:49:47.600]  it won't lend for building the one kind of power stations that work in those countries
[2:49:47.600 --> 2:49:52.560]  because they've got plenty of coal and that's coal fired power now these days coal fired power is
[2:49:52.560 --> 2:50:01.200]  clean it's efficient it's continuous it's reliable and yet the world bank denies it result people in
[2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:08.240]  sub-saharan africa who don't have electricity die 15 to 20 years before those of us who do
[2:50:08.880 --> 2:50:16.080]  so the death toll is already in the tens of millions every year they're not killed by climate change
[2:50:16.080 --> 2:50:22.960]  they're killed by climate change policies which as dr franc's paper now proves are completely
[2:50:22.960 --> 2:50:30.640]  unjustifiable there is no existing case for doing anything about global warming at all so
[2:50:30.640 --> 2:50:36.400]  that's the truth of it they're already killing millions and yes if they were to get their way
[2:50:36.400 --> 2:50:42.560]  the latest thing there's an enormous campaign now worldwide particularly on the bbc here against
[2:50:42.560 --> 2:50:50.960]  eating meat now as i know because i was told i had diabetes two years ago the cure for that
[2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:55.840]  is to stop eating bread and pasta and other carbohydrates and potatoes and rice and grains
[2:50:55.840 --> 2:51:01.680]  and eat lots of meat and the reason why everybody's getting diabetes in the west is they're not eating
[2:51:01.680 --> 2:51:07.600]  enough meat and yet here are these people who are already killing the people of africa now they
[2:51:07.600 --> 2:51:13.360]  want to increase the death toll which is already very high in the west from diabetes and its complications
[2:51:13.360 --> 2:51:20.240]  i no longer have diabetes because i now eat plenty of meat every day that's how i cured myself and i
[2:51:20.240 --> 2:51:26.400]  am completely free of this disease having been genetically hispanics and and native americans
[2:51:26.400 --> 2:51:32.320]  particularly can't handle corn syrup or processed sugars uh even more exactly that and literally you
[2:51:32.320 --> 2:51:36.640]  drive down the street at bus stops you'll see folks with their legs chopped off they're almost all
[2:51:36.640 --> 2:51:41.520]  hispanic and then they'll admit that it's three times more likely in hispanics to be killed by
[2:51:41.520 --> 2:51:47.200]  sugar i mean so sugar is deadly it's really deadly for hispanics and as the studies show they need
[2:51:47.200 --> 2:51:52.080]  they need high meat diets and and not the sugar diets just the sugar you see it's also getting rid
[2:51:52.080 --> 2:51:57.040]  of the carbohydrates because they turn into sugar so quickly it's the same eating sugar and that's
[2:51:57.040 --> 2:52:02.320]  where the meat comes in because it takes longer to digest so you don't get the sugar rush it doesn't
[2:52:02.320 --> 2:52:08.400]  overload your pancreas and you do away with the diabetes so we've now got a new info war on our
[2:52:08.400 --> 2:52:14.480]  hands alex which is to explain to the people that if you don't want obesity and you don't want
[2:52:14.480 --> 2:52:19.920]  diabetes you don't want your feet and hands chopped off you don't want to go blind all the various
[2:52:19.920 --> 2:52:24.560]  complications of diabetes you don't want dementia you don't want Alzheimer's all of these come from
[2:52:24.560 --> 2:52:32.000]  carbohydrates then what you should do is eat more meat but the international communist left
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:38.240]  are determined to take away from our plates the roast beef of old england itself and why
[2:52:38.240 --> 2:52:44.480]  because they want to kill us one should never underestimate just how much communist and fascist
[2:52:44.480 --> 2:52:50.160]  hate humanity well christopher they're now out of the open saying humans are bad depopulate us
[2:52:50.160 --> 2:52:55.840]  we've got the democratic party candidates for president coming out and saying depopulate kill
[2:52:55.840 --> 2:53:00.800]  the brown people i mean we have bernie sanders saying it's about depopulation nothing to be
[2:53:00.800 --> 2:53:09.120]  more racialist than the current democrat party in its attitude to countries where what they need
[2:53:09.120 --> 2:53:17.200]  is our support they do not need this kind of naked racialism from the democrats who actually
[2:53:17.200 --> 2:53:23.760]  hate poor people they because they're all rich people now the democrats they hate black people
[2:53:23.760 --> 2:53:28.640]  they hate people who do not come from the privileged background in greenwich village
[2:53:28.640 --> 2:53:36.400]  that they come from they want to rule by communism by fascism by one form or another of
[2:53:36.400 --> 2:53:43.040]  absolute totalitarian control well i've got news for them democracy which is what you and i believe
[2:53:43.040 --> 2:53:51.680]  in alex that doesn't care what color your skin is it's one man one vote and everybody's vote
[2:53:51.680 --> 2:53:58.480]  is equal there's nothing that's more of a leveler up than democracy itself and that i think was the
[2:53:58.480 --> 2:54:04.880]  great significance of mr trump's speech he has done two things now that justify that presidency
[2:54:04.880 --> 2:54:11.520]  of his the first was to pull america out of the paris climate nonsense and the second one
[2:54:11.520 --> 2:54:17.920]  was that speech today it's going to go down as one of the great speeches made by american presidents
[2:54:17.920 --> 2:54:23.520]  it's going to be read and reread and studied and retweeted and passed on and commented on
[2:54:23.520 --> 2:54:28.960]  around the world and the left are already not knowing where to look because they realize he
[2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:35.200]  has confronted them directly that's your word he's confronted them he's faced them down he said no
[2:54:35.200 --> 2:54:41.840]  we are not going to allow democracy to pass out into the night we are not going to hand over our
[2:54:41.840 --> 2:54:48.960]  national rights and freedoms and independence and democracy and prosperity to an alien bureaucratic
[2:54:48.960 --> 2:54:54.240]  force whether it's the united nations the world bank or any of these others we will be free
[2:54:54.240 --> 2:55:00.320]  and you will not be able to stop us it was a great moment for america and a great moment for the world

[2:55:16.560 --> 2:55:22.800]  speechless right now i was in a super bad mood uh today when i started talking about the communist

[2:55:28.240 --> 2:55:34.800]  but i just i i got reminded by it and got even rage on air and off here but then i knew trump
[2:55:34.800 --> 2:55:41.600]  gave this powerful speech but it ended right when i went on air at 11 a.m so i started going through
[2:55:41.600 --> 2:55:45.680]  transcripts of it and saw articles on info wars and i watched the clip during the break and went
[2:55:45.680 --> 2:55:50.960]  into euphoria because i get mad at trump not taking enough action because i know how serious
[2:55:50.960 --> 2:55:56.560]  his battle is i love trump but also get irritated and i know he does stuff when you put heat on him
[2:55:56.560 --> 2:56:00.240]  he's a good guy but man him coming out and saying the globalists aren't going to run the world you're
[2:56:00.240 --> 2:56:05.040]  a bunch of trash and coming out against big tech at the un that is going to be all over the world
[2:56:05.040 --> 2:56:11.440]  that means he's really taking action so i'm just really happy so thank you all of you that have

[3:00:41.520 --> 3:00:45.440]  of them in this hour but you heard lord mongton earlier i agree with him this is trump's most
[3:00:45.440 --> 3:00:50.400]  powerful most epic speech that when you understand that the globalists used to want to have people
[3:00:50.400 --> 3:00:55.440]  arrested if they talked about this and they used to tell police and training manuals we've shown
[3:00:55.440 --> 3:00:59.360]  you that if people have to get out of the u n stickers on their car go ahead and arrest them
[3:00:59.360 --> 3:01:05.680]  that was in law enforcement magazines it all that fired we believed in humanity we exposed it and
[3:01:05.680 --> 3:01:12.000]  now it's it's nationalism versus globalism and you'll never have your world government

[3:07:41.200 --> 3:07:49.200]  ladies and gentlemen i started this broadcast out optimistic but very very upset and it's a
[3:07:49.200 --> 3:07:53.360]  problem i have that david knight has and the no one shroyer has and i know that will johnson and
[3:07:53.360 --> 3:08:00.240]  tom papper dave and then savannah hernandez has and all our other hosts when you look at this stuff
[3:08:00.240 --> 3:08:03.920]  i mean i i do a lot of preparation at home and in the morning and when i get here
[3:08:07.200 --> 3:08:10.400]  and it's upsetting i mean i'm not being a victim here i'm just telling you that
[3:08:13.440 --> 3:08:16.720]  it's it's really upsetting to study the left because
[3:08:16.720 --> 3:08:23.680]  there there there's so much worse than i can even say and at the end of the show almost every day
[3:08:24.240 --> 3:08:29.600]  for the broadcast i'll go through the papers and i'll go oh man i didn't cover that i didn't
[3:08:29.600 --> 3:08:36.320]  cover this and i feel guilty like i'm not doing a good enough job and i think about people out there
[3:08:36.320 --> 3:08:40.160]  that don't care about humanity or society who all think everything's a big joke
[3:08:40.160 --> 3:08:46.960]  what must that be like because i'm fighting all the time and i feel like i'm not doing enough
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:53.680]  and it's not from some goody two shoes perspective i'm not an evil person i like to see people hurt
[3:08:53.680 --> 3:08:59.280]  for no reason and i don't like to dominate people for no reason and i don't want power for no reason
[3:08:59.280 --> 3:09:06.240]  wanted to protect myself and i don't like seeing people poor i don't like seeing animals hurt
[3:09:06.240 --> 3:09:16.640]  hurt but i have a instinctive territorialism and i get enraged
[3:09:18.800 --> 3:09:23.440]  a lot of people think oh you get mad you you're you get stupid no that's you get scared you can't
[3:09:23.440 --> 3:09:29.760]  think no when i'm angry i can think real good it's like a rush of just all this information and
[3:09:29.760 --> 3:09:35.120]  everything's so clear when i'm in that state and it's not a demonic anger it's a it's a it's a
[3:09:35.120 --> 3:09:42.800]  human anger i wouldn't even call it a godly anger it's a it's a human clarity and just focus
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:50.400]  because my very cells it's because you've got the spirit that's that's god and then that's your
[3:09:50.400 --> 3:09:56.960]  connection to god your spirit but the body has a life the body the cells have a will to survive as
[3:09:56.960 --> 3:10:03.520]  well they're a shadow of the spirit and my body's like this is the enemy i mean you want to hurt
[3:10:03.520 --> 3:10:13.200]  children you want to destroy their innocence my cells want to fight my very sinews my bones
[3:10:13.760 --> 3:10:20.640]  want to run up against the enemy my teeth want to sink into their flesh i want to squeeze the
[3:10:20.640 --> 3:10:25.520]  life out of them i want to watch the the damn evil light go out of their eyes my hands are
[3:10:25.520 --> 3:10:30.400]  around their neck politically because they're hurting innocent people and my very body wants
[3:10:30.400 --> 3:10:35.600]  them off the children and it's willing to do anything to get them off anything
[3:10:38.240 --> 3:10:45.360]  it doesn't hurt other innocence but we're gonna have to be very patient to get this job done
[3:10:47.840 --> 3:10:51.520]  and i can tell you trump has that same rage many other people have that same rage
[3:10:55.280 --> 3:10:59.760]  but it's not the rage it's going to get us through this it's going to be that quiet determined
[3:10:59.760 --> 3:11:07.040]  focus and we've got to get in that quiet determined focus place or the anger is going to go sideways
[3:11:07.920 --> 3:11:12.480]  on people we care about around us and it's radioactive it's got to be a balance and
[3:11:13.120 --> 3:11:20.000]  i spend so much time trying to not get angry then i look at other people that let themselves just
[3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:34.400]  be trampled on constantly and it it's dangerous and i watch the twisted and the fallen
[3:11:38.960 --> 3:11:41.200]  organize themselves into armies of evil
[3:11:43.120 --> 3:11:48.000]  and then try to convince those of us that have a conscience that we need to bow down to them
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:52.640]  because they can point out a few problems we have or something our ancestors did and it needs
[3:11:52.640 --> 3:11:58.000]  to be rebuked it needs to be shouted out it needs to be blocked that doesn't mean go out and bully
[3:11:58.000 --> 3:12:03.440]  them and go out and get in their face that just means don't do business with them and when you
[3:12:03.440 --> 3:12:07.920]  see them let them know and when they get in your business look them right in the eye and say you
[3:12:07.920 --> 3:12:14.480]  listen here you know damn well you're a control freak that in these people and hate civilization
[3:12:14.480 --> 3:12:19.120]  and you're of your father the devil so in the name of jesus christ get behind me satan and let me
[3:12:19.120 --> 3:12:23.360]  tell you i've been doing that now when they come over and they go f you f your family you're shame
[3:12:23.360 --> 3:12:28.560]  on you and they're all in a certain i just go you're of your father the devil and the name of
[3:12:28.560 --> 3:12:34.640]  jesus christ get behind me satan and they run this happens routinely now they they start stumbling
[3:12:34.640 --> 3:12:42.320]  over themselves they go and i just because they know it's like down they go whoa and it's that
[3:12:42.320 --> 3:12:47.920]  it's that deed we have on this planet because of christ see the devil was given this planet
[3:12:48.800 --> 3:12:56.160]  but we are given the down payment on the deed if we simply take it and and it's our planet
[3:12:56.160 --> 3:13:03.760]  as a launchpad to infinite futures and the system doesn't like that everything is about
[3:13:03.760 --> 3:13:09.760]  the end of the future the end of civilization the globalist singularity humans fall away like rocket
[3:13:09.760 --> 3:13:17.440]  boosters on a on a space shuttle mission and and and they control the future and then we suck and
[3:13:17.440 --> 3:13:22.560]  we're horrible and we're bad and it's all over for us and it's all for an conclusion give up lay down
[3:13:22.560 --> 3:13:28.880]  on the ditch it's all over no it's not that's because those of you that chose satan it's all
[3:13:28.880 --> 3:13:37.120]  over for you you're what's going to fall to the side not us every bit of its projection look at
[3:13:37.120 --> 3:13:43.120]  globalists they could be worth a trillion dollars some of them control trillions it's all made up
[3:13:43.120 --> 3:13:53.280]  inflated crap anyways and they look devoid of power of of regalness of strength even if they have
[3:13:53.280 --> 3:14:01.360]  pretty bodies they've paid for they they look like mummies painted trolops and they are soulless
[3:14:01.360 --> 3:14:07.520]  and they are without any real direction we'll see we can get our guests on here i want to get
[3:14:07.520 --> 3:14:10.720]  him on hote of jesus we'll see if that happens but regardless i'm going to play some more of these

[3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:44.320]  but it has to happen and we're not filing lawsuits just to play games here that's why we
[3:14:44.320 --> 3:14:50.240]  don't just file them right away so this is serious business that's another reason to get the products
[3:14:50.240 --> 3:14:54.320]  at m4store.com you want to fight you want somebody to fight you're looking for somebody that ain't
[3:14:54.320 --> 3:15:00.400]  gonna back down oh you found it right here folks this is a real deal that's why they spend all day
[3:15:00.400 --> 3:15:07.040]  on the internet from a patriot perspective that's paid for saying we're not real saying we work for
[3:15:07.040 --> 3:15:14.080]  this or that or i'm bill hicks all that crap is to tell you that the bona fide the bones the real

[3:20:44.640 --> 3:20:49.760]  talk about trump taking big chi-com tech to the woodshed and i wanted to get hooked up jesus on
[3:20:49.760 --> 3:20:53.520]  the day he's hard to get on he's a busy guy we got him on we got a little bit late so we already
[3:20:53.520 --> 3:20:57.440]  got in the wings which is another person i want to get on today or tomorrow leo zigami
[3:20:58.240 --> 3:21:01.760]  who's an expert on the vatican and he's written an article at leo zigami dot com
[3:21:01.760 --> 3:21:08.800]  it's also at info wars dot com gretas parents reported to child services in sweden uh this
[3:21:08.800 --> 3:21:14.960]  morning i talk about an abused child a brainwashed child surprised gretta thumbberg's coach is a
[3:21:14.960 --> 3:21:22.000]  soros billon melinda gates operative well of course they are and her security and the guy
[3:21:22.000 --> 3:21:27.520]  handling her at the un uh is also that of course her parents are antifa so we're gonna get hooked
[3:21:27.520 --> 3:21:31.840]  up jesus's take on that uh but i want to bring and we'll go to hooked up just a moment i wanted
[3:21:31.840 --> 3:21:39.040]  to bring leo zigami in here uh who's who's broken this news uh give us the latest intel on gretta
[3:21:39.040 --> 3:21:44.640]  i mean she was like possessed by hitler when i say that i mean she really had the wild eyedness
[3:21:44.640 --> 3:21:52.720]  that certain look uh that certain uh cadence a lot of people are making the hitler parallel right now
[3:21:54.080 --> 3:22:00.320]  yes alex i've been sincerely praying very much for gretta in the last 24 hours because the moment
[3:22:00.320 --> 3:22:07.120]  trump crossed the greater this demon came out of her and was visible in her eyes and it really
[3:22:07.120 --> 3:22:16.240]  broke my heart because this child is being not only abused uh as of course for propaganda reasons
[3:22:16.240 --> 3:22:23.440]  but she obviously has some demon inside that and it's becoming increasingly visible so when
[3:22:23.440 --> 3:22:31.120]  earlier this morning a friend from stockholm contacted me sending me this news that uh the
[3:22:31.120 --> 3:22:38.480]  parents have been reported for child abuse and this report is being taken seriously well in a way
[3:22:38.480 --> 3:22:46.400]  alex i was really relieved because yesterday here on my own channel i actually prayed for her
[3:22:46.400 --> 3:22:52.640]  and made the kind of like a liberation prayer because i felt really sorry for this person
[3:22:52.640 --> 3:22:58.880]  he is like i mean the exorcist was a film in which you had a priest who was mac from cedar who was
[3:22:58.880 --> 3:23:06.480]  a swedish and a jazz white with a with a girl and in this case the girl is swedish and she is
[3:23:06.480 --> 3:23:13.200]  possessed and there is no doubt on that because when trump a man of god who is about to talk about
[3:23:13.200 --> 3:23:19.840]  a subject like religious intolerance in a way nobody has done ever before who has invested
[3:23:19.840 --> 3:23:25.920]  now 25 million talking about the fact that christians have been killed jews have been killed
[3:23:25.920 --> 3:23:32.960]  muslims of various denomination kill each other every day religious intolerance has to end and
[3:23:32.960 --> 3:23:39.680]  instead we are talking here about the rubbish that greta was pushing through with their propaganda
[3:23:39.680 --> 3:23:45.840]  and of course at one point when she went on stage it was visible to the whole world and even to the
[3:23:45.840 --> 3:23:51.520]  child services in sweden who are taking this report very seriously so i expect the parents of
[3:23:51.520 --> 3:23:56.720]  greta to have some big problems on their return to sweden because they're just passing her around
[3:23:56.720 --> 3:24:02.480]  to the globalist everywhere she's clearly totally brainwashed hotep jesus has been marketing um for
[3:24:02.480 --> 3:24:07.120]  many uh decades both traditional and digital spheres very well known he's a natural teacher
[3:24:07.120 --> 3:24:12.640]  in the wealth of knowledge he was a popular radio and tv shows a huge guest everybody knows that

[3:24:27.040 --> 3:24:35.120]  programs brian's dream is a life of philanthropy hotep jesus hotep jesus at hotep jesus on twitter
[3:24:35.120 --> 3:24:38.640]  hotep i want to get you on about the waterfront leo's with us a little bit longer we'll get leo
[3:24:38.640 --> 3:24:43.120]  back on tomorrow now we can chew on routinely because we love your work loved you on joe rogan
[3:24:43.120 --> 3:24:49.440]  what what do you make of uh gretta thunberg trump's speech at the un just the climate we're in right
[3:24:49.440 --> 3:24:56.240]  now the energy level i can feel the energy do you feel that leo leo made me laugh when he said she
[3:24:56.240 --> 3:25:01.840]  was possessed i was like yo that kind of goes in line with what i was thinking because when i first
[3:25:01.840 --> 3:25:08.160]  saw gretta i thought of the tucky dog right so everybody's saying oh you know you can't talk
[3:25:08.160 --> 3:25:13.360]  about this little kid and that's the third i said to myself i said if the tucky dog if the
[3:25:13.360 --> 3:25:18.960]  tucky dog was running after you with a knife in his hand would you punch the little thing or would
[3:25:18.960 --> 3:25:28.480]  you feel bad you know so with gretta i'm like i see tucky i see somebody that i we don't care
[3:25:28.480 --> 3:25:36.240]  with their ages you know if you once you enter the uh the conversation and you put yourself
[3:25:36.240 --> 3:25:40.080]  in the front you got to be able to take some bullets right you got to be able to take some
[3:25:40.080 --> 3:25:45.040]  criticism there she is right there that's gretta to me that's what i see i see i know you're right
[3:25:45.040 --> 3:25:50.880]  i was calling her the grant she looks more like chucky you see that you see that like like this is
[3:25:50.880 --> 3:25:56.320]  not and it's the sad chucky says chucky goes i'm watching you she says i i haven't watched she's
[3:25:56.320 --> 3:26:02.880]  like she's like the german she's like a she's like hitler meets chucky yeah and you know it's a
[3:26:02.880 --> 3:26:10.080]  it's a fraud it's a facade because she gets into character when she did that little speak right and
[3:26:10.080 --> 3:26:15.920]  i think her dad was actor his mom or something like that this little girl is being propped up to
[3:26:15.920 --> 3:26:23.680]  pushing agendas god presley has done more for the climate in in two days than her entire movement
[3:26:23.680 --> 3:26:31.440]  will ever do uh this is the type of situation where we have to allow capitalists so-called
[3:26:31.440 --> 3:26:36.080]  capitalists to handle the climate problem don't let the socialists handle problems because the
[3:26:36.080 --> 3:26:43.280]  problem won't get solved but it get worse you have private corporations right now that have
[3:26:43.280 --> 3:26:52.240]  invented uh machines or ideas that are cleaning up garbage uh from the ocean people are going to be
[3:26:52.240 --> 3:26:57.280]  able to solve these problems and then what's the first thing that these climate people do they shut
[3:26:57.280 --> 3:27:02.000]  down biotech they say oh we don't want to deal with you know the tech people that want to help with
[3:27:02.000 --> 3:27:09.600]  this issue well how else do you clean up stuff without technology at one point the garbage truck
[3:27:09.600 --> 3:27:14.480]  was technology then the garbage truck create had arms and picked up the garbage the guy didn't have
[3:27:14.480 --> 3:27:19.520]  outside a truck technology is always going to be around so technology is going to have to help us
[3:27:19.520 --> 3:27:24.400]  clean up this mess and the first thing want to do is this is is attacking the technology
[3:27:24.400 --> 3:27:27.840]  well you're right they want to be able to decide what technology we can have and be the new kings
[3:27:27.840 --> 3:27:32.640]  of the earth right and they don't want to create solutions they don't want things to get better
[3:27:32.640 --> 3:27:37.520]  because then they're out of a job i have to say why are they so anti-success because the left at
[3:27:37.520 --> 3:27:42.000]  midstown and the whole environmental movement is about an anti-human future it's just a nightmare
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:47.920]  we're all going to die it all sucks i mean if you're a garbage man and there's no garbage you're
[3:27:47.920 --> 3:27:52.400]  out of business if you're an activist there's no problems you're out of business and these people
[3:27:52.400 --> 3:27:58.720]  make a lot of money as activists so the only thing they can do is after a problem solved is create
[3:27:58.720 --> 3:28:03.520]  a new problem that's the socialist specializing creating problems out of thin air all right i'm
[3:28:03.520 --> 3:28:07.520]  going to ask you we're going to break what you want to get into because you've always got a lot
[3:28:07.520 --> 3:28:10.720]  of really cool stuff in your radar we're gonna come back real fast and finish up with leo zagami

[3:31:41.360 --> 3:31:45.120]  of times it makes things a loss leader because if you're already getting 10 percent off because
[3:31:45.120 --> 3:31:49.280]  you're on autoship then we're doing 50 percent off and then you do something like that uh we have
[3:31:49.280 --> 3:31:54.720]  patriot points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support we are working with

[3:32:58.080 --> 3:33:01.360]  you
[3:33:18.560 --> 3:33:23.040]  the devil went down to georgia he was looking for a soulless deal he was in a band because he
[3:33:23.040 --> 3:33:27.760]  was way behind he was willing to make a deal when he came across this young man sewing on a fiddle
[3:33:27.760 --> 3:33:32.480]  and playing it hot and the devil jumped up on a hickory stumps and boy let me tell you why
[3:33:32.480 --> 3:33:38.320]  i guess you didn't know it but i'm a fiddle player too and if you'd care to take a dare i'll make a
[3:33:38.320 --> 3:33:43.680]  bet with you now you played pretty good fiddle boy but give the devil his due i bet a fiddle of
[3:33:43.680 --> 3:33:48.720]  gold against your soul because i think i'm better than you but at a crazy time hotep jesus is our
[3:33:48.720 --> 3:33:53.520]  guest here one of the great top markers expert on twitter i'm a really smart guy about the new
[3:33:53.520 --> 3:33:58.720]  award and leo zagami best-selling author vatican expert and so much more who we got on because
[3:33:58.720 --> 3:34:02.960]  he's got a breaking story at leozagami.com leo i want to get you back on soon thanks for popping
[3:34:02.960 --> 3:34:06.560]  on short notice what else would you like to talk about that's happening in the world right now
[3:34:07.280 --> 3:34:12.800]  well i would like to conclude regarding gretta the fact that she has asperger's syndrome and this
[3:34:12.800 --> 3:34:19.840]  has been proven by exorcists in the past to lead to demonic possession so i respect totally what
[3:34:19.840 --> 3:34:25.600]  your guest is saying and giving of course the more materialistic view of how she's been used and
[3:34:25.600 --> 3:34:31.360]  abused but there is also a spiritual problem here and it needs to be addressed seriously
[3:34:31.360 --> 3:34:37.520]  because this woman is demonically possessed and demonic possession is a very serious issue so thank
[3:34:37.520 --> 3:34:43.200]  you for having me on and giving me the possibility to break this to all our viewers well as it unfolds
[3:34:43.200 --> 3:34:47.280]  the story you're breaking the cps is at their house please join us again the next few days thank you
[3:34:47.280 --> 3:34:54.480]  leo thank you for this hotep we're three years into trump and change the world's crazy we've got the
[3:34:54.480 --> 3:35:02.560]  republican rival governor of massachusetts bill weld saying we need to execute trump stuff is really
[3:35:02.560 --> 3:35:08.240]  starting to get crazy what would you call the climate the planet's in right now with all these
[3:35:08.240 --> 3:35:14.800]  wars rumors of wars massive change ai quantum computing what would you call this period
[3:35:14.800 --> 3:35:21.120]  oh man what would you call it that's a great question it's definitely a turning point right
[3:35:21.120 --> 3:35:31.520]  we're at that we're at a fork in a row right now where we can we can rescue america but if it
[3:35:31.520 --> 3:35:36.800]  doesn't happen within the next few years we're going to find out that people are going to be
[3:35:36.800 --> 3:35:42.800]  showing up at c-pack announcing their pronoun that's what we're headed for we're headed for
[3:35:42.800 --> 3:35:50.240]  a future where conservative influencers have pushed the right so far left that the right
[3:35:50.240 --> 3:35:55.120]  is now the left we've got to be very careful with who we associate with we have to be very
[3:35:55.120 --> 3:35:59.920]  careful with who we give a microphone to i think we need to remove kids from politics periods if you
[3:35:59.920 --> 3:36:05.040]  don't pay taxes if you don't have kids you should be ignored we should not be exulting these kids
[3:36:05.040 --> 3:36:08.560]  they should not have millions of followers on twitter thousands of followers on twitter
[3:36:08.560 --> 3:36:13.280]  because they have some opinions because the first thing they do is when you criticize them
[3:36:13.280 --> 3:36:18.000]  they want to say oh wait i'm a kid so basically what they want is they want all the perks of
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:24.240]  being an adult with none of the drawbacks with none of the cons no you either get everything
[3:36:24.240 --> 3:36:28.240]  or you get nothing so i say because they're going to pull this young kid thing that they
[3:36:28.240 --> 3:36:32.480]  should all be ignored they should not be used they should not be given a platform i wouldn't
[3:36:32.480 --> 3:36:37.760]  interview anybody who is under the age of 18 i would not let them on my platform no go grow up
[3:36:37.760 --> 3:36:43.760]  and then you come back right because it's too dangerous you're not experienced enough you're
[3:36:43.760 --> 3:36:49.600]  not you have enough staying in the game never paid tax never paid corporate tax i can't trust
[3:36:49.600 --> 3:36:53.600]  you to make the right decisions for america i can't trust you i can't trust your opinion it's
[3:36:53.600 --> 3:36:59.440]  not based on anything you don't have kids well you don't have a stake in the future of america
[3:36:59.440 --> 3:37:05.440]  when you're gone that's it there's nothing left of you so i i think we need to do that also i'm
[3:37:05.440 --> 3:37:11.280]  i'm also questioning repeal the 19th women a way to emotional i think until women learn to
[3:37:12.720 --> 3:37:18.160]  control their emotions they should not be given a platform they should not be given a microphone
[3:37:18.160 --> 3:37:23.840]  because these people are the same ones that that is socialist youth socialist economists use women
[3:37:23.840 --> 3:37:30.800]  and they use children to push their agendas which is why we have to remove these people from the
[3:37:30.800 --> 3:37:36.080]  spotlight and bring it back to the male the head of the household and let us handle some of these
[3:37:36.080 --> 3:37:42.720]  things and let women handle the things that the womanly things and and let kids be kids and grow
[3:37:42.720 --> 3:37:48.640]  up and and learn how to be a man and learn how to be a woman but right now it's time for the men
[3:37:48.640 --> 3:37:54.880]  the men that want to change america it's time for the men to step up and be strong voices and stand
[3:37:54.880 --> 3:37:59.760]  up for the principles they believe in and speak up if you don't like something within the conservative
[3:37:59.760 --> 3:38:05.440]  movement we can't be trying to budge we can't be trying to make the left like us or or we can't do
[3:38:05.440 --> 3:38:11.360]  this so fuck them you know what i mean you saw what they did to alex jones right they did bad alex
[3:38:11.360 --> 3:38:16.400]  jones on the internet that lets you know right now with cold red there's no time to put the pussy
[3:38:16.400 --> 3:38:21.200]  for it they did it right before elections this is election meddling now's the time when the
[3:38:21.200 --> 3:38:27.360]  man got to step up and the women got to support the men we got to support the real men well once
[3:38:27.360 --> 3:38:32.320]  you bring up gets a lot of attention but hitler did say first you get to women and you've got the
[3:38:32.320 --> 3:38:37.200]  children so follow them in it is a fact that 80 percent of advertising targets women and i can get
[3:38:37.200 --> 3:38:42.320]  emotional about once i've made a decision on something to drive me but what happens is on average
[3:38:42.320 --> 3:38:49.200]  women are more collective and they want to work with people and uh they tend to historically
[3:38:49.920 --> 3:38:54.240]  get fooled by authoritarians like hitlers biggest supporters were women and i'm not saying women
[3:38:54.240 --> 3:38:58.160]  i don't think i'm going as far as you are obviously but the issue here is is that
[3:38:58.880 --> 3:39:04.800]  we have this egalitarian open liberal society the west empowers women and then it is statistically
[3:39:04.800 --> 3:39:09.040]  at the big tech companies everywhere and and the communist chinese are hiring women now
[3:39:09.040 --> 3:39:13.760]  who statistically will carry out authoritarianism in the name of everyone being nice and good like
[3:39:13.760 --> 3:39:20.400]  the head of uh youtube and so men then i mean they're saying men are bad uh uh oh my gosh look
[3:39:20.400 --> 3:39:25.040]  at barstool sports men are being masculine now they're saying we can't be masculine so they're
[3:39:25.040 --> 3:39:30.480]  saying we can't vote basically we can't have websites we can't be heard from and so what's
[3:39:30.480 --> 3:39:34.960]  happening is we expand and open up the freedom and then we're being told now our freedom goes away
[3:39:34.960 --> 3:39:40.080]  so the pushback is is obviously where you're going with that and it really shows the authoritarianism
[3:39:40.080 --> 3:39:45.280]  that the globalists do not want any leadership to fight the takeover that anytime an authoritarian
[3:39:45.280 --> 3:39:49.680]  takes over he enslaves or kills the men and so we have culturally killed men for this takeover
[3:39:49.680 --> 3:39:56.480]  it's like lbj said his letters are public i'll have the f-ing inwards you know voting democrat
[3:39:56.480 --> 3:40:01.440]  for democrat for a hundred years and he said we're going to pay women to not have men in the house
[3:40:01.440 --> 3:40:07.360]  and so it's it's it that is their plan not blaming women evil men come in and literally try to remove
[3:40:07.360 --> 3:40:12.880]  men i mean it's a fact yeah i saw somebody the other day they said they said it's so clear they said
[3:40:12.880 --> 3:40:19.760]  men are capitalist and i hate that term and women are communist and it's true uh which is why they're
[3:40:19.760 --> 3:40:25.280]  so susceptible to socialism and communism and they they love it so much but that just points
[3:40:25.280 --> 3:40:32.400]  to their nature that they belong in the community the commune that's where women belong you stay in
[3:40:32.400 --> 3:40:37.200]  the community we're going to go out and fight the battle today the battles are more like a
[3:40:37.200 --> 3:40:43.200]  court war than a real war right that was that was facing here in america at least the women
[3:40:43.200 --> 3:40:47.360]  you need to get back in the kitchen you need to make sure that you know my sandwich is ready
[3:40:47.360 --> 3:40:52.320]  so i can go fight the war you need to make sure that these kids know what gender they are you know
[3:40:52.320 --> 3:40:56.640]  i mean once you got the mom removed now that this i don't know where they're learning this gender
[3:40:56.640 --> 3:41:01.760]  stuff for sure no one can deny that the family's been broken up so they can go sterilize the kids
[3:41:01.760 --> 3:41:06.000]  and in humanity i mean i mean it's true they're killing the way humans operate to come in and
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:11.840]  replace us and so in the name of freedom it's a post-human world everybody's dead sir i mean look
[3:41:11.840 --> 3:41:17.200]  at the conservative movement you got trans people in a conservative movement what is conservative
[3:41:17.200 --> 3:41:21.120]  about being trans now you got no problem with trans people that's what you want to do that's
[3:41:21.120 --> 3:41:27.120]  what you want to do but that's trans that's not conservative and people actually got these people
[3:41:27.120 --> 3:41:36.720]  out here pushing pushing the conservative movement they giving them the the baton you have gay people
[3:41:36.720 --> 3:41:42.000]  that are in the conservative movement there's nothing gay in the bible and conservative movement
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:46.000]  is very much so christian now i ain't got no problem with gay people i love gay people i got
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:50.800]  gay friends but that's not conservative that's gay that's not part of the conservative movement
[3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:54.800]  so the more the conservative movement and i don't agree with everything conservative movement
[3:41:54.800 --> 3:41:59.760]  but when i see something that compromising this principle whether i agree with it or not if you're
[3:41:59.760 --> 3:42:04.240]  compromising your principles you're going to compromise your whole life two weeks ago and i
[3:42:04.240 --> 3:42:08.160]  should have aired it i forgot the name of it that was really good he was saying that that
[3:42:08.160 --> 3:42:12.880]  the conservatives aren't conservatives anymore they're just i mean i mean the democratic party
[3:42:12.880 --> 3:42:19.840]  officially is endorsing pedophilia now and yeah it's crazy yeah that's where the pedophilia is
[3:42:19.840 --> 3:42:26.400]  that's where it's always been that's how is it it's all in his book who's perpetrating the
[3:42:26.400 --> 3:42:32.640]  trafficking of children go look at tammany hall i believe uh early 20th century when they were
[3:42:32.640 --> 3:42:39.280]  trafficking women in new york city type of tammany hall women traffic new york city of 20 000s in
[3:42:39.280 --> 3:42:45.680]  that ring democrat c president the democrats literally are satanist i mean the republics

[3:47:14.640 --> 3:47:18.320]  in about 13 minutes the warren starts with our destroyer and i gotta tell you
[3:47:18.320 --> 3:47:24.560]  uh he's gonna be airing large segments of trump's speech that was incredibly good through down the
[3:47:24.560 --> 3:47:28.880]  gauntlet christopher montan was on earlier he says the best speech he's ever seen not just by
[3:47:28.880 --> 3:47:34.000]  trump i mean what he said was a declaration of war on everything the global stand for and they're
[3:47:34.000 --> 3:47:38.800]  gonna go completely eight now now potep jesus is here with us laying out some really heavy
[3:47:38.800 --> 3:47:44.320]  stuff and i'll say this about what he said we were already in a period of humans being taken
[3:47:44.320 --> 3:47:48.720]  out of their natural form and natural roles doesn't mean people don't do the other roles
[3:47:48.720 --> 3:47:52.400]  sometimes but people force in the roles that are not natural and now they're going to end
[3:47:52.400 --> 3:47:56.480]  humanity as we know it in the family that's the admitted goal they're now announcing it
[3:47:56.480 --> 3:48:00.640]  and so you can look at what he's saying is extreme but the extreme openness and freedom of the west
[3:48:00.640 --> 3:48:06.000]  allowed all these things uh that that were not natural and then now it's being directed to
[3:48:06.000 --> 3:48:11.760]  end the ability to be natural so now anything upright organic authentic is under attack anything
[3:48:11.760 --> 3:48:16.480]  false is held up and worshiped so i agree with him in the spectrum of you know from what she speaks
[3:48:17.280 --> 3:48:21.200]  but there have always been people in groups that are that are from orthodoxies that then
[3:48:21.200 --> 3:48:25.440]  go into other areas naturally just because the way humans operate and that's part of our real
[3:48:25.440 --> 3:48:30.720]  diversity but the force diversity of things and things that are unnatural is our destruction
[3:48:30.720 --> 3:48:36.480]  you were saying you're ready to define the arrow we're in and you said the poop is about to hit
[3:48:36.480 --> 3:48:45.760]  the oscillating fan so please get into that yeah so we're in the era of the silent majority
[3:48:46.400 --> 3:48:52.640]  we are at the whim of the silent majority the silent majority doesn't get there it's together
[3:48:53.680 --> 3:48:59.440]  we're in trouble the silent majority has to cease being silent we saw the silent majority show up
[3:48:59.440 --> 3:49:06.000]  at the post the front we see them show up at the front rally but if people don't start speaking up
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:12.000]  you're basically consenting to the evil that's about to take over the world so that's why i call
[3:49:12.000 --> 3:49:17.680]  this the arrow of the silent majority it's on you it's not on people like me my only job is
[3:49:17.680 --> 3:49:24.560]  and alex's only job and rex rex jones only job is is to put the battery in your back to make you
[3:49:24.560 --> 3:49:29.920]  not be afraid to come out and speak we're showing you you can be brave you don't have to be afraid
[3:49:29.920 --> 3:49:36.640]  to speak your mind you know grab your co-owners make sure you're still a man and speak up stop
[3:49:36.640 --> 3:49:42.000]  being afraid to lose from your job and because here's the fact of the matter if you lose your job
[3:49:42.800 --> 3:49:48.880]  take the money you've got and sue them sue them for firing you for wrong reasons you should be happy
[3:49:48.880 --> 3:49:53.040]  if you get fired for something that happened on your twitter you should be happy because that's the
[3:49:53.040 --> 3:49:56.800]  lowest way to happen now you never got to work again get the million dollar check to go home
[3:49:56.800 --> 3:50:03.680]  but that's it's a it's a violation of your right as a american and we keep allowing these socialists
[3:50:03.680 --> 3:50:09.280]  and communists to just tear down the constitution and just amend it and amend it and amend it and
[3:50:09.280 --> 3:50:15.360]  amend it so it's just not the same thing anymore so it's no longer the bill of right now it's just
[3:50:15.920 --> 3:50:24.480]  conglomerate foolery you know um also you know hote that nation we have ten commandments right and
[3:50:24.480 --> 3:50:29.680]  these are the ten commandments we follow i think it's hard time the servers need to sit down at
[3:50:29.680 --> 3:50:34.560]  the table and figure out what is what are the principles they stand on you know because when
[3:50:34.560 --> 3:50:38.800]  you look back you want to wonder what happened to conservatives you know how to get this right
[3:50:39.440 --> 3:50:45.600]  um the michael malis says conservatism is liberalism moving this by the way your logo your logo is
[3:50:45.600 --> 3:50:53.760]  kick ass i wish you'd make me one i think i thought of that i envisioned it in my head i gave it to
[3:50:53.760 --> 3:51:00.320]  somebody um i had dozens of people that could not get it right i had you know i think 200 designs
[3:51:00.320 --> 3:51:04.960]  were delivered and that one finally came and i was like that's the one that's exactly i wanted
[3:51:04.960 --> 3:51:08.800]  because because i've been thinking about trying to come up with a logo for m4s it's like a shield
[3:51:08.800 --> 3:51:13.600]  or something and i thought about it kind of like a tower but i just can't ever come up with that
[3:51:13.600 --> 3:51:19.120]  that is the best logo i've ever seen yeah i you know hote nation we are marketing and business so
[3:51:19.760 --> 3:51:26.080]  you know maybe we can ideate something for m4 wars let me think about it shield i like it i like it
[3:51:27.600 --> 3:51:30.240]  um let's go back to that logo talk about what that means
[3:51:32.000 --> 3:51:36.720]  so we gotta be the sovereigns don't we we've gotta stand up in our own birthright and declare that
[3:51:36.720 --> 3:51:40.640]  we're free and that we're above the system that means that's what america was supposedly about
[3:51:40.640 --> 3:51:44.480]  didn't mean we ever actually realized it but we're saying we're sovereign there's no king over us
[3:51:44.480 --> 3:51:50.480]  because we are the lords and ladies of our own lives our homes or our castles yeah if you look
[3:51:50.480 --> 3:51:54.960]  at the hotef nation logo or let's start with the name so of course hotef is going to tell you the
[3:51:54.960 --> 3:52:00.560]  ideology and you have the word nation today we have people that want to defeat nationalism
[3:52:00.560 --> 3:52:04.560]  nationalism is basically tribalism what you're basically saying is you're trying to
[3:52:04.560 --> 3:52:10.480]  remove people's freedom of association which means you want to control it they're saying we don't want
[3:52:10.480 --> 3:52:15.680]  you to even have any ideology or any kinship or any crew that stands up for you we want you alone
[3:52:15.680 --> 3:52:22.160]  by yourself so we can destroy you yeah yeah or you rock with the state so that's why it's
[3:52:22.160 --> 3:52:28.320]  hotef in the nation and then when you look at the crown the crown is basically denoting uh denoting
[3:52:28.320 --> 3:52:33.760]  our royalty a lot of people want to say that you know if we're talking colorful black people
[3:52:33.760 --> 3:52:41.920]  or uh worse came from slavery and we don't we don't follow that ideology you know we we we come
[3:52:41.920 --> 3:52:47.920]  from the ideology that we come from faro which are the european equivalent to king so you know we
[3:52:47.920 --> 3:52:52.720]  we were royalty you know a lot of people say we was king we was king i don't i don't deal in this
[3:52:52.720 --> 3:52:57.680]  you know somebody said something today they said some white ladies she apologized they said oh
[3:52:57.680 --> 3:53:02.240]  oh i'm sorry that your ancestors went through slavery i said i'm sorry your ancestors went
[3:53:02.240 --> 3:53:07.040]  through slavery because the slobs had it bad the irish had it bad exactly i was there
[3:53:07.040 --> 3:53:11.040]  it's supposed to gonna air tomorrow we'll see if it does with the tiff ti and he kept bringing
[3:53:11.040 --> 3:53:14.560]  up slavery and i said listen it's going on everywhere everybody had it in their past but but
[3:53:14.560 --> 3:53:19.200]  we are the greater things in our past i'm not belittling it or taking away from it he was saying
[3:53:19.200 --> 3:53:24.000]  i'm saying i don't look at the bad stuff as my identity i look at the at the great things as
[3:53:24.000 --> 3:53:29.200]  my identity and and people moving forward not being victims and these people just i don't care
[3:53:29.200 --> 3:53:33.760]  if it's white kids black kids whoever it is they get into being victims and and they're they obsess
[3:53:33.760 --> 3:53:39.680]  on it and i'm sick of it well i think ti is a lot older at least not a lot older but he's older
[3:53:39.680 --> 3:53:49.120]  than me and that generation was inundated a lot where we confuse the quote-unquote colorful black
[3:53:49.120 --> 3:53:55.360]  power movement with you know gripe it's always in just the position with white people right
[3:53:55.360 --> 3:54:02.240]  it's always about you know we overcame we to overcome anytime you say overcome you're basically
[3:54:02.800 --> 3:54:09.200]  putting white people in a conversation so well exactly always it's like people obsess over israel
[3:54:09.200 --> 3:54:13.280]  it's like worshiping israel or something like why can't it probably be their own thing and then
[3:54:13.280 --> 3:54:17.440]  that's how you really dominate is building your own big thing that you already had instead of always
[3:54:17.440 --> 3:54:22.480]  obsessing about this group over here instead of just taking off and dominating regardless that's
[3:54:22.480 --> 3:54:29.360]  how you really win yeah group up get with your tribe mind your business and build because we got
[3:54:29.360 --> 3:54:34.720]  enemies on all fronts the other day i watched the arabs um mac the shit out of some white lady i mean
[3:54:34.720 --> 3:54:43.280]  some black lady um uh there was a black business that was in hair and she was out in california
[3:54:43.280 --> 3:54:48.960]  melanating young lady and after a year her business is out of her business went out of business
[3:54:48.960 --> 3:54:54.960]  because the korean wouldn't sell to her so you talk about the white man your enemy man you this
[3:54:54.960 --> 3:55:00.720]  everybody's in it has a tribe if you can't stick your tribe and work with your tribe there's a
[3:55:00.720 --> 3:55:06.480]  problem and if your tribe is talking about other tribes you are really in deep shit you know so
[3:55:08.000 --> 3:55:16.160]  ti has to be unconditioned we have to recondition ti to focus on us you know like when we look at
[3:55:16.160 --> 3:55:23.120]  that revoke tv thing with tana's own why would you bring up donald trump in the mecca you know
[3:55:23.120 --> 3:55:29.920]  the the the melanated mecca of america atlanta that's where all the you know african related
[3:55:29.920 --> 3:55:37.040]  people are are basically our capital so why would you have all these black people on this on this
[3:55:37.040 --> 3:55:43.200]  panel and talk about trump like what does he have to do with uplifting our nation you know
[3:55:43.200 --> 3:55:49.360]  how they focus on yourself but again he's from a different generation that hasn't been able to
[3:55:49.360 --> 3:55:55.120]  take himself i was caught in that in that mental trap at one point you know so focused on on
[3:55:55.120 --> 3:55:59.600]  you know the so-called white man i was focused on that and then i got out of that mentality and
[3:55:59.600 --> 3:56:05.120]  i started seeing how it's much more freeing and it's much more liberating and i became more powerful
[3:56:05.120 --> 3:56:09.520]  because well exactly and expanding on that everybody's got their own issues and people
[3:56:09.520 --> 3:56:14.240]  that all these old scores and fights but the globalist are here to replace humans with a
[3:56:14.240 --> 3:56:19.440]  post-human world they play us off against each other on purpose while they're dominating we
[3:56:19.440 --> 3:56:25.440]  have to deal with that and they've wound up china with one side of deals to dominate everybody and
[3:56:25.440 --> 3:56:29.200]  if we don't deal with that they're enslaving the chinese people they're not getting that under this
[3:56:29.200 --> 3:56:33.920]  and they're dominating us we're all getting screwed by the globalist ally with china and the big
[3:56:33.920 --> 3:56:39.600]  banks and hollywood and that's the enemy humanity is under attack by radical orthodox islam in my
[3:56:39.600 --> 3:56:46.400]  view uh the the eu tyranny the chai kham threat and this whole globalist leftist central banking
[3:56:46.400 --> 3:56:52.000]  cartel and they are all combined against everybody else and and training us to all fight with each
[3:56:52.000 --> 3:56:55.680]  other and it doesn't mean there aren't issues and things going on but the point is is that it
[3:56:55.680 --> 3:56:59.920]  doesn't matter the big overarching thing to put in fluoride and all our water putting gmo and all
[3:56:59.920 --> 3:57:06.480]  is putting 5g out trying to break up all of our families is this sinister evil globalist force
[3:57:06.480 --> 3:57:11.920]  and if you don't wake up to that we're all going to lose period they're trying to pick the african
[3:57:11.920 --> 3:57:19.360]  against the the anglo-saxon you know they've been doing it for centuries now but we've been allies
[3:57:19.360 --> 3:57:25.760]  for a really long time if you go look at the maroccan treaty uh the maroccan american treaty
[3:57:25.760 --> 3:57:31.520]  you'll see that america's first ally was an african name hochep we're out of time you got to join
