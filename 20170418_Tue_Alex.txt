[00:00.000 --> 00:16.040]  Well here we are it's Tuesday already the 18th day of April 2017 I'm Alex Jones
[00:16.040 --> 00:19.840]  here in studio David Knight and many others are coming up with breaking news
[00:19.840 --> 00:27.120]  as well as guests with us here in studio today look at the headlines all out war
[00:27.120 --> 00:31.480]  North Korea warrants nuclear war could break out any moment as country vows to
[00:31.480 --> 00:38.040]  test more missiles this week after one failed last Sunday North Korea will test
[00:38.040 --> 00:44.280]  missiles weekly senior official tells the British broadcasting company US
[00:44.280 --> 00:48.200]  deploys two more aircraft carriers towards Korean Peninsula that from zero
[00:48.200 --> 00:54.280]  hedge we have the article posted on info wars.com that is a huge massive
[00:54.280 --> 01:04.200]  movement Pentagon starts review of nuclear posture ordered by Trump. North
[01:04.200 --> 01:09.640]  Korea all-out war if US uses military action high-nuke threat North Korea
[01:09.640 --> 01:17.640]  threatens missile launch and now we have Russian state-run media coming out that
[01:17.640 --> 01:20.920]  means officially from the government saying Donald Trump is more dangerous
[01:20.920 --> 01:28.600]  than North Korea well technically that's absolutely true now the media is
[01:28.600 --> 01:34.040]  gonna say Jones agrees Trump is worse than North Korea no I mean scientific
[01:34.040 --> 01:41.000]  about this who has 50,000 nuclear weapons who has 15 aircraft carriers who has
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.840]  over a thousand predator drones alone on and on and on the biggest military in
[01:44.840 --> 01:51.480]  the world 55% of military budget globally of course technically an elephant
[01:51.480 --> 01:57.760]  is more dangerous than a rat. The difference is North Korea is the one
[01:57.760 --> 02:01.680]  firing missiles off the coast of Japan constantly grabbing fishing boats
[02:01.680 --> 02:05.760]  constantly shooting artillery over at islands constantly going after people
[02:05.760 --> 02:12.200]  constantly threatening to nuke Tokyo Japan and constantly threatening to nuke
[02:12.200 --> 02:19.640]  South Korea's capital Seoul. So technically Trump is more dangerous America
[02:19.640 --> 02:24.360]  has bigger teeth but America is not starting it but I also understand Russia's
[02:24.360 --> 02:32.800]  statement here. It is scary overall to have North Korea in this position and
[02:32.800 --> 02:36.840]  then to have Trump calling their bluff because we've had this strategy of
[02:36.840 --> 02:41.920]  appeasement the strategy of giving them nuclear reactors the strategy of going
[02:41.920 --> 02:49.680]  along with them for decades really since 1953 and it's a joke and now China has
[02:49.680 --> 02:54.480]  bought into that posture and has grabbed 90% of the South China Sea in fact we
[02:54.480 --> 02:58.640]  could probably play over this clip right now the CNN layout where they
[02:58.640 --> 03:03.080]  actually show you accurately that 90% has been grabbed by China from Japan all
[03:03.080 --> 03:06.080]  the way down to the Philippines thousands and thousands of square miles
[03:06.080 --> 03:11.560]  more than they ever had it's a very belligerent posture so bottom line Trump
[03:11.560 --> 03:16.960]  is letting China know we're not gonna be pushed around but North Korea is so
[03:16.960 --> 03:20.400]  psychotic that they didn't launch a missile or detonate an atomic weapon
[03:20.400 --> 03:25.800]  like they promised to do on their Founders Day from the grandpa you know
[03:25.800 --> 03:29.720]  first dictator of North Korea so they didn't detonate that on the 15th I thought
[03:29.720 --> 03:33.800]  oh wow North Korea blinked maybe they're gonna be sane maybe they can open up the
[03:33.800 --> 03:38.000]  free trade like East Germany did maybe we can end all this and then as I'm
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.480]  shooting the video Saturday night it was already the 16th in North Korea already
[03:43.480 --> 03:47.800]  halfway into the 16th I saw the text coming in Alex they just tested a
[03:47.800 --> 03:51.480]  missile you're wrong fake news how am I supposed to know they don't fire it on
[03:51.480 --> 03:56.640]  the 15th it's on the 16th I say wow they blinked which they did and then they
[03:56.640 --> 03:59.960]  supposedly test one and it blows up on the launch pad that was happening live
[03:59.960 --> 04:03.800]  so I was correct they did blink on the 15th they didn't test the nuke that's
[04:03.800 --> 04:09.080]  another blink but now they say they're not and so I'm just trying to have some
[04:09.080 --> 04:13.160]  positive you know news here it's mainstream media saying end of the
[04:13.160 --> 04:18.840]  world nuclear war imminent oh my gosh get ready for it all the rest of it so
[04:18.840 --> 04:22.360]  we're gonna really focus on Korea in this situation today I know David
[04:22.360 --> 04:25.960]  Knight's an expert on it he's done a lot of research he's gonna be joining us and
[04:25.960 --> 04:28.960]  we've got so much more to break down I'm gonna go over more of this when we come
[04:28.960 --> 04:34.520]  back what these two new aircraft carrier groups mean but the big thing is
[04:34.520 --> 04:38.000]  let's pray to God for peace let's pray for the whole world to come together the
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.440]  North Korea be freed that the United States not be played by the global
[04:41.440 --> 04:45.680]  send a conflict with Russia that we not back radical jihadist Islam and that
[04:45.680 --> 04:49.960]  humanity basically come back from the brink we'll be back with so much more

[09:33.080 --> 09:37.640]  were better in the news of course Teresa May has called a snap election coming up
[09:37.640 --> 09:42.920]  in June she's trying to consolidate support to move forward with Brexit we
[09:42.920 --> 09:47.320]  also have a special election that is taking place in Georgia today that is
[09:47.320 --> 09:53.160]  getting a lot of national press it has become a cause celeb for the left to
[09:53.160 --> 09:57.240]  move against Donald Trump we're gonna talk about that as well as some
[09:57.240 --> 10:03.160]  information about the election in France and an update on Turkey before we get to
[10:03.160 --> 10:06.120]  all of that and before we get to what's happening in North Korea there's also
[10:06.120 --> 10:11.160]  been some interesting developments in North Korea as well that have just come
[10:11.160 --> 10:16.200]  out I want to remind you that we have our Easter mega special at info wars
[10:16.200 --> 10:22.040]  store.com that's going to be ending tonight and this is a large special very

[11:37.640 --> 11:42.080]  special that is ending tonight that's at info wars store.com there's been an
[11:42.080 --> 11:47.280]  update on the Facebook killer you may have seen this he just killed himself
[11:47.280 --> 11:51.440]  committed suicide in Erie, Pennsylvania after a chase and of course he committed
[11:51.440 --> 11:55.800]  these this live murder in Cleveland that's been a nationwide manhunt for him
[11:55.800 --> 12:01.240]  and he just committed suicide and I think as I look at this we look at all
[12:01.240 --> 12:05.720]  the press attention that was given to this Facebook killer you know there was
[12:05.720 --> 12:08.720]  an article last week and I covered it and of course it was out of the UK and
[12:08.720 --> 12:13.960]  Drudge report had it but nobody really talked about this everybody was talking
[12:13.960 --> 12:18.440]  about the Facebook killer and yes it was outrageous it was it was really really
[12:18.440 --> 12:22.080]  disgusting and outrageous but there was some other Facebook stuff that was
[12:22.080 --> 12:24.680]  really disgusting and outrageous it didn't get a lot of press coverage and
[12:24.680 --> 12:29.720]  perhaps it was because it involved Facebook itself you know anybody can put
[12:29.720 --> 12:33.160]  up a live stream and they they took this stream down when they found it but in
[12:33.160 --> 12:37.720]  the UK they have a lot of problems because the British government I'm gonna
[12:37.720 --> 12:41.840]  report this again because other people really haven't picked up on this the
[12:41.840 --> 12:46.360]  British government is taking them to task they say they risk criminal
[12:46.360 --> 12:51.800]  prosecution let me repeat that Facebook risks criminal prosecution according to
[12:51.800 --> 12:55.720]  the British government because they refuse to remove potentially illegal
[12:55.720 --> 13:01.880]  terrorist and child pornography content despite being told it was on their
[13:01.880 --> 13:07.160]  site you understand people found this information they had a violent pedophile
[13:07.160 --> 13:11.900]  cartoon a video of an apparent sexual assault on a child they had propaganda
[13:11.900 --> 13:16.440]  posters that were glorifying recent terrorist attacks in London and in Egypt
[13:16.440 --> 13:20.840]  I remember there wasn't much talk was there about the attacks on the Christian
[13:20.840 --> 13:25.000]  churches in Egypt we didn't see those people dying slow deaths we didn't see
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.960]  the people who were run down by ISIS terrorists with trucks we didn't see
[13:27.960 --> 13:31.720]  them dying so deaths because that wasn't something that was going to be used for
[13:31.720 --> 13:36.920]  a political purpose but boy if you have an attack in one place it's gonna get a
[13:36.920 --> 13:41.320]  lot of attention and they're not going to blur out the faces they're not going
[13:41.320 --> 13:45.440]  to censor the pictures no they will show you in slow motion the people who are
[13:45.440 --> 13:48.400]  dying because they want to use that politically but in this particular
[13:48.400 --> 13:54.000]  situation Facebook had these this sexual assault on a child these propaganda
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.000]  posters for terrorist attacks and they were told and the British government
[13:59.000 --> 14:05.480]  said look if you are told about this and you don't take it down your moderators
[14:05.480 --> 14:10.320]  are told you hire these people to be moderators and you don't take that down
[14:10.320 --> 14:17.120]  you own that you own that now you have criminal liability and I think it's
[14:17.120 --> 14:23.720]  interesting as we look at what broke yesterday Mike Cernovich looking at this
[14:23.720 --> 14:30.160]  this document that we saw from a Google putting this out we see today
[14:30.160 --> 14:34.360]  business insider Google is trying to distance themselves saying that it was
[14:34.360 --> 14:39.640]  a rogue vendor it wasn't them ah but they are the ones who are setting
[14:39.640 --> 14:44.240]  themselves up as the arbiters of truth they are the ones who are taking down
[14:44.240 --> 14:47.360]  controversial content on YouTube stay with us we're gonna break that down for
[14:47.360 --> 14:53.400]  you when we come back as well as North Korea the empires on the run Alex Jones
[14:53.400 --> 14:57.200]  and the GCN radio network
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.440]  on Sunday Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones broke the news that Google contractors
[15:03.440 --> 15:07.040]  are being directed to write info wars articles to push them even further down
[15:07.040 --> 15:10.920]  and search engine results and liberals came out of the woodwork to say we were
[15:10.920 --> 15:15.560]  lying well now we have business insider Google says rogue vendor violated
[15:15.560 --> 15:19.560]  guidelines by instructing contractors to rate info wars as untrustworthy site
[15:19.560 --> 15:23.240]  Google said that the vendor had mistakenly told staffers working for the
[15:23.240 --> 15:27.120]  search engine that info wars should be ranked as a low-quality site oh yeah we
[15:27.120 --> 15:30.520]  believe you Google we believe you Google reps are attempting to distance
[15:30.520 --> 15:33.520]  themselves from the contractors instructions by saying it does not
[15:33.520 --> 15:38.000]  instruct quality raters on how to grade specific websites let's read what the
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.120]  contractor said in their bonus example while CNN isn't a perfect news outlet it
[15:42.120 --> 15:45.160]  is a popular news source that covers stories with depth to compare the
[15:45.160 --> 15:48.400]  info wars article is brief and only mentioned statements from sources not
[15:48.400 --> 15:52.200]  typical of course they're talking about the recent Syrian chemical attack that
[15:52.200 --> 15:56.280]  we're saying is a false flag and is now being proven in spades robbed your
[15:56.280 --> 16:00.120]  reporting for info wars dot com and info wars nightly news hey everyone
[16:00.120 --> 16:03.720]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs here host of the Bright Side and as many of you know I'm
[16:03.720 --> 16:07.560]  on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy you all heard the shocking
[16:07.560 --> 16:12.000]  statistics despite spending trillions of dollars in health care nearly $10,000

[21:48.480 --> 21:53.560]  mega Easter sale is going to end tonight that's what Alex was just talking
[21:53.560 --> 21:56.880]  about. Just before the break I was talking about how Google has now
[21:56.880 --> 22:00.240]  responded to the information that we revealed yesterday remember Mike
[22:00.240 --> 22:05.760]  Sernovich over the weekend had a contractor send him a sample of how
[22:05.760 --> 22:11.600]  Google is going to censor entire sites and of course they used info wars as an
[22:11.600 --> 22:15.560]  example of this saying well here's a story where Assad says he thinks that
[22:15.560 --> 22:20.480]  this serious attack was fake CNN talks about it and they're trustworthy you
[22:20.480 --> 22:23.640]  should rate them high because they talk to government sources they talked to
[22:23.640 --> 22:27.880]  people from the Pentagon they talked to bankers okay but info wars talks to
[22:27.880 --> 22:32.880]  people like Ron Paul they tell you what Assad said and then yesterday we told
[22:32.880 --> 22:37.920]  you that there was a guy who was an MIT professor emeritus a scientific
[22:37.920 --> 22:42.080]  advisor former scientific advisor to the Department of Defense who was a scientific
[22:42.080 --> 22:45.980]  advisor four years ago and he was part of the group that took a look at the
[22:45.980 --> 22:49.480]  false flag back then that they were trying to say look this is a sarin gas
[22:49.480 --> 22:53.280]  attack and only the government of Syria could have done it and they said no now
[22:53.280 --> 22:57.760]  that's not true they debunked that four years ago before there was any kind of
[22:57.760 --> 23:01.840]  military action the UN agreed with it Russia was saying that as well so the
[23:01.840 --> 23:06.600]  Russia Russia the US and the UN all agreed that that was a false flag four
[23:06.600 --> 23:11.000]  years ago now this story here you can see this on info wars.com he put this up
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.600]  and he said look you can see that this was not an aerial munition this was
[23:16.600 --> 23:20.520]  crushed it did not explode from within it was crushed and that created the
[23:20.520 --> 23:25.800]  crater so he says the very photo that the Pentagon is putting out here shows
[23:25.800 --> 23:30.840]  that their narrative is not true he said this is amateurish and it is
[23:30.840 --> 23:35.720]  politicized but here's the other thing they use that as an example that was the
[23:35.720 --> 23:39.760]  example that story that went out on Friday they use that as an example over
[23:39.760 --> 23:42.800]  the weekend and we immediately found out about it through Mike Cernovich we put
[23:42.800 --> 23:47.600]  that up yesterday we talked about it now Google has come back and said well that
[23:47.600 --> 23:53.400]  was a rogue vendor see this is their rogue one defense it was a rogue vendor
[23:53.400 --> 23:57.200]  that did it we really didn't do it and a lot of people also pushed back and say
[23:57.200 --> 24:00.480]  why are you saying that Google is censoring you Google is a private
[24:00.480 --> 24:05.760]  organization they can do whatever they wish you have to understand that what
[24:05.760 --> 24:11.880]  this is is a public-private partnership where the government works very closely
[24:11.880 --> 24:15.560]  with the corporation we see that with the toll roads and every time you see
[24:15.560 --> 24:20.160]  PPP you know you're going to get screwed it's chronic capitalism it's
[24:20.160 --> 24:22.840]  something that's being done under the table and what they're doing right here
[24:22.840 --> 24:27.160]  folks is they're outsourcing censorship let me repeat that they're
[24:27.160 --> 24:31.960]  outsourcing censorship that's what this is all about that's why they're using
[24:31.960 --> 24:37.400]  Google that's why they're using Facebook you see Angela Merkel whispering in the
[24:37.400 --> 24:43.800]  ear of Zuckerberg about how they need his help to deal with the crisis that
[24:43.800 --> 24:47.320]  they have created with immigration oh yeah we'll work out we'll work with you
[24:47.320 --> 24:50.560]  on that we'll work with the Chinese Communist government on that we'll work
[24:50.560 --> 24:54.720]  with anybody as long as they the money keeps flowing and the monopoly keeps
[24:54.720 --> 25:00.120]  going see you have to understand that all this this phony narrative about what
[25:00.120 --> 25:06.520]  was going on with the FCC as I pointed out yesterday it was simply a number one
[25:06.520 --> 25:10.800]  it was a competition between bureaucracies you had the FTC the Trade
[25:10.800 --> 25:15.960]  Commission has been regulating the internet very lightly but then the FCC
[25:15.960 --> 25:19.760]  said we're going to regulate it as if it was a limited frequency spectrum so
[25:19.760 --> 25:23.360]  we're going to do net neutrality we're going to do these other rules we're going
[25:23.360 --> 25:28.840]  to put prohibitions on ISPs when they wanted to put prohibition on ISPs and
[25:28.840 --> 25:34.520]  that was for the benefit of Google and Facebook who are heavily connected to the
[25:34.520 --> 25:38.880]  Obama administration how many times is Eric Schmidt by himself go to the
[25:38.880 --> 25:43.280]  Obama administration it was over 200 times that he went to meet with Obama so
[25:43.280 --> 25:46.160]  what they're doing is they're saying well we're going to allow Facebook and
[25:46.160 --> 25:49.400]  Google to collect your information they're even going to turn it over to
[25:49.400 --> 25:52.920]  employers they're going to turn over your browsing history they're going to turn
[25:52.920 --> 25:56.320]  over your the history of the videos that you watched on YouTube they'll turn
[25:56.320 --> 25:59.800]  that over to the government remember that broke a couple of days ago they'll
[25:59.800 --> 26:02.640]  turn over all that stuff they'll monetize all that stuff and they'll also
[26:02.640 --> 26:05.640]  turn over information to the government so that's what the government wants to
[26:05.640 --> 26:10.160]  have the government wants to know what you think are their narratives working
[26:10.160 --> 26:14.760]  with you do they need to fine-tune it over here will it be more acceptable if
[26:14.760 --> 26:18.880]  they fine-tune the narrative will you believe them then okay it's kind of like
[26:18.880 --> 26:23.080]  get smart you know would you believe and then he puts this thing out and then
[26:23.080 --> 26:27.040]  it's like it's absolutely incredible well would you believe if I said this okay
[26:27.040 --> 26:29.920]  that's what they're playing it's this closed loop game where they throw out a
[26:29.920 --> 26:33.720]  phony narrative and then they measure to see whether or not people are buying
[26:33.720 --> 26:38.400]  it or not that's the kind of intelligence that Facebook and Google can help the
[26:38.400 --> 26:41.520]  government with and then the government helps them by giving them monopoly
[26:41.520 --> 26:44.520]  saying we're not going to let ISPs collect this information we're going to
[26:44.520 --> 26:48.680]  let you and Facebook collect this information so they come out and they
[26:48.680 --> 26:53.960]  say that this is a vendor who did it and before I leave this whole idea of it
[26:53.960 --> 26:57.400]  being private let me say that a lot of these people who are defending Google are
[26:57.400 --> 27:03.080]  the same people who said we need to shut down a small local bakery if they don't
[27:03.080 --> 27:08.000]  bake a cake for a gay wedding because it's against their religion now you have
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.720]  the freedom you can go to any bakery right but Google has a virtual monopoly
[27:12.720 --> 27:16.040]  they operate in the public space the arguments that they made to shut down
[27:16.040 --> 27:19.640]  this bakery saying that they are business operating in the public space so
[27:19.640 --> 27:25.320]  they don't have the right to choose to refuse service to people they're not
[27:25.320 --> 27:28.760]  making that same argument for Google now are they in that it kind of
[27:28.760 --> 27:33.000]  interesting Google gets a pass but the little tiny local bakery gets hammered
[27:33.000 --> 27:37.760]  put out of business for that same type of wedding so don't talk to me about the
[27:37.760 --> 27:41.920]  fact that they're private okay I'm fine with that let's have some boycotts of
[27:41.920 --> 27:47.240]  them that's fine but realize that you're not going to be able to it's much
[27:47.240 --> 27:51.520]  easier to start up a bakery than it is to go into competition with Google or
[27:51.520 --> 27:55.200]  Facebook you realize that of course don't you and you realize how powerful
[27:55.200 --> 27:59.680]  they are in terms of shaping the narrative in terms of shutting down the
[27:59.680 --> 28:03.920]  First Amendment and shutting down specific sites because our government
[28:03.920 --> 28:09.880]  wants to outsource outsource censorship just like they want to outsource their
[28:09.880 --> 28:14.080]  espionage on you so when these people collect the information on you and they
[28:14.080 --> 28:17.840]  turn it over to the government the government just passed a law last year
[28:17.840 --> 28:20.840]  CISA they've been trying to get that for a long time they finally got it through
[28:20.840 --> 28:24.920]  they said you can't sue them if they turn information that they collected
[28:24.920 --> 28:28.840]  about you over to the government because they said well that belongs to them now
[28:28.840 --> 28:34.040]  that's the fiction that they play so they outsource the surveillance they
[28:34.040 --> 28:38.960]  outsource the censorship this is the game that they're playing with this
[28:38.960 --> 28:42.920]  public-private partnership now this is what Google said today in this article
[28:42.920 --> 28:46.640]  they said Google's representative distanced the company from the
[28:46.640 --> 28:51.440]  contractors instructions this is the documents that we exposed yesterday on
[28:51.440 --> 28:56.440]  info wars.com they told Business Insider that it did not instruct quality
[28:56.440 --> 29:01.960]  raters how to grade specific websites but it gives general rules to get unbiased
[29:01.960 --> 29:06.640]  feedback to improve the algorithm all right let's focus on that phrase there
[29:06.640 --> 29:13.280]  grading specific websites understand that it would be bad enough if they were
[29:13.280 --> 29:16.640]  to come out and say we're going to tell you what's true and what isn't we're
[29:16.640 --> 29:21.280]  gonna say this story here is true and that story over there is false I don't
[29:21.280 --> 29:24.760]  need Google you don't need Google to tell you that something is true or false
[29:24.760 --> 29:30.400]  you don't need Snopes either or this phony organization down in in St. Petersburg
[29:30.400 --> 29:33.840]  that they picked up that's not much better than a couple of people with cats
[29:33.840 --> 29:37.680]  on this couch okay it's a very tiny little school they say also journalism
[29:37.680 --> 29:41.520]  school it's got a faculty of like five or six people and they all seminars they
[29:41.520 --> 29:47.600]  have fake people who are who are validating and setting on top of this
[29:47.600 --> 29:51.480]  news and telling you whether it's real or not you don't need that this is
[29:51.480 --> 29:56.640]  simply an effort to manipulate the narrative to manipulate what people have
[29:56.640 --> 30:00.160]  out there in the public but they go beyond that it would be bad enough if
[30:00.160 --> 30:03.400]  they did that story by story but they go beyond that they point out that they're
[30:03.400 --> 30:07.600]  going to down rate specific websites and when you look at that story it's not
[30:07.600 --> 30:10.840]  just the fact that they're focused on info wars but the fact that they say
[30:10.840 --> 30:14.920]  well based on the reputation of a particular site you should always
[30:14.920 --> 30:20.320]  down rate their stuff to the lowest level and because CNN is stellar these
[30:20.320 --> 30:25.040]  people who faked everything from missile attacks than you know you've seen the
[30:25.040 --> 30:31.160]  disappearing nose of the anchor Anderson Cooper I mean come on but they're the
[30:31.160 --> 30:34.920]  highest quality level because they're all in this together they're part of
[30:34.920 --> 30:40.160]  operation mockingbird part do I guess or maybe this is part 13 I don't know how
[30:40.160 --> 30:45.160]  many different revisions we've got of operation mockingbird where the CIA went
[30:45.160 --> 30:47.960]  in and said we're going to take over the media we're going to tell them what to
[30:47.960 --> 30:51.920]  tell the public and they all read off the same government script well CNN
[30:51.920 --> 30:55.080]  Google Facebook they're all reading off the same script but they get the high
[30:55.080 --> 30:58.920]  ratings they are the ones who will determine what your reputation is they
[30:58.920 --> 31:03.960]  are the ones who determine what whether what you say is true or not and that was
[31:03.960 --> 31:06.960]  the most dangerous part about this you know we're going to have in the next
[31:06.960 --> 31:10.840]  hour at least ran ahead is going to be with us and he's spoken a great deal
[31:10.840 --> 31:16.760]  about how you don't disrate something because of the source you don't want to
[31:16.760 --> 31:21.680]  completely shut down a source even CNN can have some truth sometimes even the
[31:21.680 --> 31:26.680]  New York Times yeah as a matter of fact yesterday I covered this story that the
[31:26.680 --> 31:31.720]  New York Times had about ms-13 and the gang violence on Long Island I talked
[31:31.720 --> 31:39.280]  about how that was a personal story because my wife is from that area and I
[31:39.280 --> 31:42.960]  was absolutely amazed that even though they got the facts right and they talked
[31:42.960 --> 31:48.680]  about all the murders of teenagers in that area people who were hacked to death
[31:48.680 --> 31:55.280]  with machetes and then they call these people undocumented immigrants these
[31:55.280 --> 32:00.280]  ms-13 gang members they said 10 of the 13 that were arrested were undocumented
[32:00.280 --> 32:03.120]  immigrants they weren't criminals they weren't gang members they were
[32:03.120 --> 32:07.680]  undocumented immigrants meet your new immigrant neighbors it just happened to
[32:07.680 --> 32:11.360]  be undocumented we're working on that documentation understand that you know
[32:11.360 --> 32:16.280]  today Donald Trump came out blasting them blasting Obama for creating it and
[32:16.280 --> 32:22.120]  it was absolutely right no you know ms-13 was not created by Obama but Obama
[32:22.120 --> 32:27.280]  opened the gates wide open for them open the gates wide open and so when we
[32:27.280 --> 32:31.000]  look at this and we understand that right after the election do you remember
[32:31.000 --> 32:35.640]  there was a California amnesty group that said we want to block the state of
[32:35.640 --> 32:41.960]  California from turning over lists of gang members to immigration because we
[32:41.960 --> 32:47.640]  don't want them deported they might get somebody who is falsely identified as a
[32:47.640 --> 32:51.840]  gang member so we don't want any gang members deported that's the way California
[32:51.840 --> 32:56.640]  reacted to that so today Donald Trump said the weak illegal immigration policies
[32:56.640 --> 33:01.040]  of the Obama administration allowed bad ms-13 gangs to form in cities across the
[33:01.040 --> 33:08.600]  US were removing them quickly and at the same time we had Judge Napolitano say
[33:08.600 --> 33:11.760]  you know it should be newsworthy that the government is enforcing immigration
[33:11.760 --> 33:15.240]  law and he quoted the current Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said
[33:15.240 --> 33:19.680]  understand there's two types of illegal immigrants he said either they
[33:19.680 --> 33:22.560]  committed a crime here and they went to jail or they've committed a crime and
[33:22.560 --> 33:27.280]  they didn't yet go to jail oh that sounds kind of harsh doesn't it
[33:27.280 --> 33:31.960]  understand that what we're talking about here are foreign citizens who are
[33:31.960 --> 33:36.400]  criminally trespassing and usually what they're doing is committing identity
[33:36.400 --> 33:40.680]  fraud many times they steal other people's identities and that's even if
[33:40.680 --> 33:44.720]  they don't quote-unquote commit a crime like hacking somebody to death with a
[33:44.720 --> 33:47.320]  machete and the people who are being hacked to death were Hispanic
[33:47.320 --> 33:51.800]  teenagers who are trying to flee this violence but they couldn't because we
[33:51.800 --> 33:56.240]  don't have a process that vets people coming into this country it's just a
[33:56.240 --> 33:59.640]  free-for-all who can make it across the border well guess what if you can make it
[33:59.640 --> 34:02.960]  across the border as a peaceful citizen you can make it across the border if
[34:02.960 --> 34:06.920]  you're a gang member and so that's the situation we have so Judge Napolitano
[34:06.920 --> 34:11.400]  says well it shouldn't be newsworthy but he goes actually it is because we've
[34:11.400 --> 34:14.720]  got a government that in general is enforcing the law and then we find out
[34:14.720 --> 34:20.480]  story from Breitbart that Breitbart Texas found out that there's 60 linear
[34:20.480 --> 34:26.400]  miles of the border where one of these supervisors is saying we're not going to
[34:26.400 --> 34:30.240]  send any agents to that area we're not going to put anybody there and the
[34:30.240 --> 34:37.160]  supervisor is somebody from the Obama era okay this is a guy who is a holdover
[34:37.160 --> 34:42.440]  from the Obama administration and once the border patrol president then a
[34:42.440 --> 34:46.640]  president of the National Border Patrol Council Brandon Judd found out about
[34:46.640 --> 34:51.680]  this he was appalled he verified this to Breitbart they went on to say one of the
[34:51.680 --> 34:55.760]  Border Patrol agents said criminal cartels are exploiting our weaknesses on
[34:55.760 --> 35:00.400]  a daily basis they're certainly going to exploit such a large area of an open
[35:00.400 --> 35:05.400]  and unpatrolled border so they said this is part of this is corruption perhaps
[35:05.400 --> 35:08.400]  because we've got people who are hanging back not putting anybody there so they
[35:08.400 --> 35:11.280]  can leave it open for the drug cartels to come through but the other part of it
[35:11.280 --> 35:16.600]  is a holdover from the Obama era so that's the two different aspects of that
[35:16.600 --> 35:21.440]  I got off on that tangent but at least ran a hand it's gonna be joining us in
[35:21.440 --> 35:25.280]  the next hour he's somebody who worked at Breitbart he knows Steve Bannon I want
[35:25.280 --> 35:29.240]  to talk to him about that as well but I also want to talk to him about singling
[35:29.240 --> 35:36.280]  out entire sites for censorship that is the real issue here and Google is
[35:36.280 --> 35:39.960]  trying to walk this back saying we didn't single out info wars understand
[35:39.960 --> 35:45.800]  they're gonna single us out one by one that was just a sample of what's to come
[35:45.800 --> 35:49.360]  and what they're doing with setting themselves up as the arbitrary truth
[35:49.360 --> 35:54.000]  downrating and destroying individual sites that is the mechanism that they're
[35:54.000 --> 35:59.920]  setting up it is censorship by outsourcing we'll be right back this is
[35:59.920 --> 36:04.320]  the story of the shaving company called Harry's in an epic battle of David versus
[36:04.320 --> 36:08.920]  Goliath in the early 1980s a child was born two of them actually their names
[36:08.920 --> 36:13.480]  were Jeff and Andy time went by they developed facial hair and one day
[36:13.480 --> 36:18.280]  something happened Andy got ripped off by overpriced razors so they decided to
[36:18.280 --> 36:22.000]  start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all they hired the
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.320]  best designers they bought a 95 year old German blade factory and they started
[36:26.320 --> 36:30.520]  selling high quality razors online with no upcharging direct to customers how
[36:30.520 --> 36:34.240]  did the overpriced razor company respond by threatening to sue their pants off
[36:34.240 --> 36:42.160]  don't worry Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and a relentless dream to get all guys a great shave at a great price try Harry's free

[39:16.840 --> 39:21.000]  I'm David Knight when I get to North Korea here we got the North Korean
[39:21.000 --> 39:27.680]  government they describing this as thermonuclear war that may break out at
[39:27.680 --> 39:32.000]  any moment things are very tight here folks and we need to take a look at how
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.040]  we got to this situation I'm not really sure how we get out of it but we have a
[39:36.040 --> 39:40.480]  long history about how we got here and we have to learn something from that but
[39:40.480 --> 39:44.600]  we're gonna take a look at that what's going on with the US South Korea and
[39:44.600 --> 39:49.440]  Japan are they starting to talk well there's some information that there are
[39:49.440 --> 39:53.440]  some backdoor meetings that are going on let's hope that this can be walked down
[39:53.440 --> 39:58.560]  but meanwhile North Korea keeps up the tough talk they say these are aggressive
[39:58.560 --> 40:03.840]  war drills they say their country is ready to react to any mode of war desired
[40:03.840 --> 40:09.520]  by the US and again firing missiles at other countries say that you're going to
[40:09.520 --> 40:13.800]  fire missiles at the United States making aggressive threats you know that's not a
[40:13.800 --> 40:20.000]  problem but you know putting people out there putting the carrier group out
[40:20.000 --> 40:23.440]  there that is a problem I hope they can walk this thing down but we're gonna talk
[40:23.440 --> 40:28.280]  about all of that as well as the economic aspects of that before we do real
[40:28.280 --> 40:31.720]  quickly I just want to point out that our Easter mega specials will be ending

[41:20.680 --> 41:25.680]  back to the North Korean story now as we see the North Koreans talking about how
[41:25.680 --> 41:30.960]  serious this is hopefully there is some good news but Nick is reporting that the
[41:30.960 --> 41:34.960]  US South Korea and Japan are convening trilateral talks on North Korean threat
[41:34.960 --> 41:37.600]  they say the meetings will bring President Trump's administration together
[41:37.600 --> 41:41.320]  with Asian officials for the first time since Vice President Pence said the
[41:41.320 --> 41:46.160]  era of strategic patience with North Korea is over the South Korean Ministry
[41:46.160 --> 41:50.640]  of Defense announced these meetings yesterday so hopefully the this is
[41:50.640 --> 41:54.120]  going to move things now they also point out that from Beijing's perspective
[41:54.120 --> 41:58.080]  even though nuclear chaos was not unleashed over the weekend the Korean
[41:58.080 --> 42:01.160]  peninsula remains highly sensitive saying the same thing that the North
[42:01.160 --> 42:05.800]  Koreans are and a high risk to regional and possible global security that was a
[42:05.800 --> 42:11.000]  Chinese foreign minister he said any provocative action could pour oil on the
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.560]  fire well how did we get here you know there's a great editorial by Pat Buchanan
[42:16.560 --> 42:21.800]  who talks about all of this and we understand that you know this is
[42:21.800 --> 42:26.560]  something that's been going on for 64 years and it fundamentally goes back to
[42:26.560 --> 42:31.800]  how we got involved in all these domino wars and the in the Middle East okay
[42:31.800 --> 42:37.240]  and not the Middle East rather in the Southeast Asia we fought this one to a
[42:37.240 --> 42:42.000]  draw in South Korea South North and South Korea North and South Vietnam we
[42:42.000 --> 42:48.760]  lost that one what was the consequence in Vietnam well we were told that we had
[42:48.760 --> 42:53.280]  to defeat that because of Chinese Communist hegemony and yet when we lost
[42:53.280 --> 42:59.600]  in Vietnam what we wound up with was a country that is far more free market and
[42:59.600 --> 43:06.440]  actually an enemy of China never forget the documentary the fog of war where
[43:06.440 --> 43:12.760]  former Defense Secretary McNamara was doing an on-screen confession and he
[43:12.760 --> 43:15.680]  said years later he said he met with them and he admitted that the Gulf of
[43:15.680 --> 43:21.480]  Tonkin was a false flag to create that war and he said the North Koreans slammed
[43:21.480 --> 43:25.160]  his fist on the table said what were you thinking we have fought the Chinese for
[43:25.160 --> 43:30.080]  a thousand years and he said we were fighting them at the time why did you go
[43:30.080 --> 43:35.000]  to war with us we have to understand where these wars are coming from we have
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.200]  made ourselves a policeman of the world and now they expect us to keep doing it
[43:39.200 --> 43:43.040]  say with us will be right back
[43:43.040 --> 43:47.840]  visit GCNLive.com today

[44:56.280 --> 45:19.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[45:19.600 --> 45:28.480]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones welcome back to
[45:28.480 --> 45:32.200]  the Alex Jones show we have a lot of people radio stations who carry news
[45:32.200 --> 45:35.520]  at the top of the hour so I want to get back to what's going on in North Korea
[45:35.520 --> 45:39.880]  but I want to wait for the stations all the stations to rejoin us before we get
[45:39.880 --> 45:44.360]  back to that I want to talk about our relationship to our government the
[45:44.360 --> 45:47.880]  coercion the force that we see from our government so many times there's a
[45:47.880 --> 45:52.480]  couple of articles here that I think epitomize that first of all now there's
[45:52.480 --> 45:56.960]  one out of the sac be the Sacramento be talking about how UC Davis student
[45:56.960 --> 46:01.840]  leaders have now voted to make the American flag optional at meetings
[46:01.840 --> 46:08.240]  instead of mandatory okay it says they don't like the American flag but when I
[46:08.240 --> 46:13.080]  look at this I think about how many things are mandatory for us how about if
[46:13.080 --> 46:18.560]  we got choice with health insurance how about that these same people who say
[46:18.560 --> 46:20.960]  well we're gonna have a choice about whether or not we display the American
[46:20.960 --> 46:26.600]  flag at meetings you can bet these UC Davis students who don't like the
[46:26.600 --> 46:31.080]  American flag love health insurance mandates they don't want to give you a
[46:31.080 --> 46:33.120]  choice about your health insurance they don't want to give you a choice about
[46:33.120 --> 46:36.120]  what level you want they don't want to give you a choice about whether you're
[46:36.120 --> 46:39.280]  gonna have it or not they're gonna ram that down your throat but give me a
[46:39.280 --> 46:43.480]  choice I don't like that American flag okay so they understand freedom of
[46:43.480 --> 46:48.400]  choice in some respects but they don't respect it overall and that's what we
[46:48.400 --> 46:53.440]  see time and time again but I want to look at this article that my wife sent
[46:53.440 --> 46:57.040]  me actually she said look at this this is absolutely outrageous and it is it's
[46:57.040 --> 47:02.840]  from the Freethought Project and this is a NASA SWAT team did you know that NASA
[47:02.840 --> 47:07.880]  has a SWAT team yeah they do the Department of Education has a SWAT
[47:07.880 --> 47:14.120]  team they've swatted people for not paying their student loans a drug a husband
[47:14.120 --> 47:20.120]  and his kids out in the wee hours of the morning face down on the lawn because
[47:20.120 --> 47:26.360]  the mother who had left the family no longer was paying her student loan so
[47:26.360 --> 47:30.040]  they sent the Department of Education SWAT team about a year before that even
[47:30.040 --> 47:36.240]  the Washington Post said we just saw this RFP for a bunch of SWAT equipment for
[47:36.240 --> 47:38.920]  the Department of Education what's that about why would the Department of
[47:38.920 --> 47:42.160]  Education need that well because they're gonna play rough with anybody that
[47:42.160 --> 47:48.080]  doesn't pay their student loans now we see NASA with its SWAT team and they're
[47:48.080 --> 47:53.840]  going after 75 year old grandmother why because they think she's got a little
[47:53.840 --> 48:00.440]  tiny piece of a moon rock that she wanted to sell okay the situation was of
[48:00.440 --> 48:05.080]  this lady her name is Joanne Davis she's 75 she hit hard financial times she
[48:05.080 --> 48:08.560]  found herself raising grandchildren after her daughter's death her son's illness
[48:08.560 --> 48:12.520]  her husband was gone so being the resourceful grandmother she is she began
[48:12.520 --> 48:18.080]  thinking of ways that she could earn some cash and her husband had worked as an
[48:18.080 --> 48:24.440]  Apollo 11 engineer he saved a paperweight that had moon material and a
[48:24.440 --> 48:28.920]  little bit of a heat shield he'd worked at the space program at the time so he
[48:28.920 --> 48:33.800]  had that as a little tiny souvenir so she's like well I'll sell that I'll put
[48:33.800 --> 48:39.280]  that out for a you know I don't know if it was eBay wherever she put it but NASA
[48:39.280 --> 48:45.640]  got wind of it and they sent out SWAT team to get back their stuff and it'd
[48:45.640 --> 48:48.280]  be one thing if they just went out and got it but it wasn't enough for them
[48:48.280 --> 48:52.000]  just to take this back from this grandmother they had to humiliate her
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.600]  they had to use excessive force they organized a sting operation involving
[48:56.600 --> 49:01.520]  six armed officers they forcibly seized this loose site paperweight that had a
[49:01.520 --> 49:06.560]  tiny moon rock the size of a rice grain and they took it from this grandmother
[49:06.560 --> 49:15.520]  okay and not only that but then they held her there and took her as she stood
[49:15.520 --> 49:20.360]  in the part of the parking lot of a Denny's restaurant and pants that were
[49:20.360 --> 49:23.840]  soaked in urine they refused to allow her to use the bathroom she had a
[49:23.840 --> 49:29.600]  defecate in her pants she was soaked in your and they kept her there bullying
[49:29.600 --> 49:34.720]  her they did it in a way that humiliated her and I think that's a key thing that
[49:34.720 --> 49:39.680]  we need to understand it's not enough for a government to do to enforce laws
[49:39.680 --> 49:43.720]  they have to humiliate us and if you want to know what's going on with these
[49:43.720 --> 49:48.120]  United Airlines thing it starts with the government humiliating people with a
[49:48.120 --> 49:52.240]  TSA telling the airport of the airlines you don't have to take more than a
[49:52.240 --> 49:55.240]  certain amount of money and then we'll do it for you we'll just throw these
[49:55.240 --> 50:00.280]  people off the plane that's the brutality we have to fight against according to
[50:00.280 --> 50:06.040]  the mainstream media president Donald Trump was mean to kids on Easter Sunday
[50:06.040 --> 50:11.360]  that's right dozens of news outlets ran with a misleading video that was spread
[50:11.360 --> 50:15.960]  by Politico yesterday claiming that president Trump signed a kids make
[50:15.960 --> 50:21.000]  America great again at and then threw it away from the kid into the crowd the
[50:21.000 --> 50:25.240]  video quickly went viral racking up nearly 10,000 retweets and getting
[50:25.240 --> 50:30.320]  picked up by other news outlets the Washington Post reported Trump using a
[50:30.320 --> 50:34.680]  thick sharpie put his signature on the bill of the cap then looked up and
[50:34.680 --> 50:40.360]  lobbed it into the crowd nowhere near the hand that had given it to him Buzz
[50:40.360 --> 50:44.440]  Feet even claimed that the poor kid never got his hat back but in reality other
[50:44.440 --> 50:49.800]  camera angles clearly show the president and the kid were just having fun and the
[50:49.800 --> 50:55.200]  boy indeed caught his hat signed by the president of the United States you can

[53:25.960 --> 53:30.760]  Lee Stranahan formerly with Breitbart of course he knew Andrew Breitbart he was

[53:35.200 --> 53:40.040]  talk about the attacks on the press he is somebody who's very experienced
[53:40.040 --> 53:44.960]  reporter he has spoken out about the idea that we would shut down entire sites
[53:44.960 --> 53:48.160]  it's bad enough as I pointed out that they would focus on a particular story
[53:48.160 --> 53:52.400]  and label that as false but then to focus on an entire site and shut that
[53:52.400 --> 53:55.760]  down as Google is trying to push this back and saying this is just a rogue
[53:55.760 --> 54:02.360]  contractor well okay it still showed what your business model is what your
[54:02.360 --> 54:07.840]  strategy is and as I pointed out they are outsourcing censorship this is a
[54:07.840 --> 54:13.400]  public-private partnership a government monopoly they get special favors and
[54:13.400 --> 54:17.960]  help from the government and they're working with the government to outsource
[54:17.960 --> 54:22.120]  this censorship I want to get back to South Korea then we're gonna go to what's
[54:22.120 --> 54:26.760]  happening with taxes today some updates on taxes as well as the election that is
[54:26.760 --> 54:33.960]  happening in Georgia as I was saying in the last last section before we went to
[54:33.960 --> 54:38.600]  the top of the hour break we have some hopeful news US South Korea and Japan
[54:38.600 --> 54:42.200]  are hopefully going to be convening trilateral talks on North Korea this is
[54:42.200 --> 54:46.440]  announcement made by the South Korean Ministry of Defense meanwhile North
[54:46.440 --> 54:50.000]  Korea is still warning that thermonuclear war may break out any moment the
[54:50.000 --> 54:56.480]  Chinese spokesperson is saying that this is maybe pouring oil on the fire so
[54:56.480 --> 55:00.320]  we'll just have to see what is going on with that but there's also an economic
[55:00.320 --> 55:04.240]  aspect of this and of course this is a reversal that Donald Trump has done
[55:04.240 --> 55:07.400]  saying that there's no currency manipulation going on by China
[55:07.400 --> 55:10.640]  understand currency manipulation is just one of the things that China has done
[55:10.640 --> 55:18.640]  to attack America's economy we have the Chamber of Commerce and Pap you can and
[55:18.640 --> 55:22.800]  pointing this out to people who are two groups a group and a person who are not
[55:22.800 --> 55:27.000]  usually on the same side of this of this issue the Chamber of Commerce says
[55:27.000 --> 55:34.520]  that Trump needs to use every arrow in his quiver against the unfair advantages
[55:34.520 --> 55:39.880]  that China has and what are these arrows that are in their quiver what is the
[55:39.880 --> 55:44.360]  China price that allows them to produce things at 30 to 50% cheaper than we can
[55:44.360 --> 55:49.520]  here in America well they have obviously lower labor prices they have low
[55:49.520 --> 55:55.720]  wages they have no safety for their employees they protect their own markets
[55:55.720 --> 56:00.440]  very vigorously here you have the Chinese President Xi coming out and say
[56:00.440 --> 56:04.680]  we got to have open free trade just like Henry Kissinger told me he taught us all
[56:04.680 --> 56:09.520]  of this how to do this right we have to have free trade and yet they are the
[56:09.520 --> 56:14.920]  ones who are the most rigorous about protectionism the same people that are
[56:14.920 --> 56:18.760]  protecting that are preaching that we have to open our markets we have to open
[56:18.760 --> 56:23.600]  our gates to their goods they're going to protect their internal markets they
[56:23.600 --> 56:28.880]  also pirate copyrights as a key part of the China price and of course there's no
[56:28.880 --> 56:33.840]  restriction on environmental regulations but we have restrictions that are put on
[56:33.840 --> 56:39.880]  us with the Paris climate treaty we're going to have far more stringent controls
[56:39.880 --> 56:45.040]  put on our industry and that's going to happen at a much earlier date before
[56:45.040 --> 56:48.840]  they have even minor restrictions put on their industry one of the things that
[56:48.840 --> 56:54.120]  happened last week remember they buy a lot of coal from North Korea see the
[56:54.120 --> 56:58.600]  Chinese can still buy massive amounts of coal Obama didn't have a problem with
[56:58.600 --> 57:04.240]  that but but I thought it was global warming and no no no no they're only
[57:04.240 --> 57:10.360]  concerned about it if America and Europe are warming the globe it's not a
[57:10.360 --> 57:15.240]  problem when China does it or India does it they're given a special pass on that
[57:15.240 --> 57:21.240]  that evidence of that was the fact that China had as trying to get to North
[57:21.240 --> 57:25.240]  Korea to get a little bit more rational they said we're going to stop taking your
[57:25.240 --> 57:29.400]  coal shipments and then last week as a gesture to Trump when he said oh you're
[57:29.400 --> 57:34.520]  not currency manipulators anymore right right when he said you're not currency
[57:34.520 --> 57:37.880]  manipulators anymore they said all right we're going to just send those that
[57:37.880 --> 57:42.080]  that fleet of ships carrying coal we're going to send them back to North Korea
[57:42.080 --> 57:44.440]  we're done we're not going to not going to take that they're still going to burn
[57:44.440 --> 57:48.840]  coal they just won't buy it from North Korea so we look at a couple of these
[57:48.840 --> 57:53.520]  different things of the subsidies of their own industries low late labor
[57:53.520 --> 58:00.200]  prices the currency manipulation we're going to have our Federal Reserve
[58:00.200 --> 58:03.920]  manipulate our currency that's the strategy they're going to take they're
[58:03.920 --> 58:06.720]  not going to say that China is manipulating their currency they're
[58:06.720 --> 58:11.000]  going to give them a pass on that and then Trump wants the Federal Reserve to
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.840]  weaken the dollar they're really good at that they're really good at weakening
[58:15.840 --> 58:20.320]  the dollar you know the Federal Reserve was created 104 years ago same time as
[58:20.320 --> 58:25.480]  the income tax because that's when they changed our tax structure prior to that
[58:25.480 --> 58:31.520]  it was heavily skewed toward taxes at the border and not having internal taxes
[58:31.520 --> 58:35.600]  as a matter of fact Jefferson was proud of the fact when he gave a second
[58:35.600 --> 58:40.440]  inaugural address he said we have eliminated all internal taxations by
[58:40.440 --> 58:45.600]  eliminating unnecessary offices so you go back to a constitutionally sized
[58:45.600 --> 58:50.960]  government you can run a constitutionally sized government off of taxes at the
[58:50.960 --> 58:56.000]  border and Jefferson said what farmer what labor or what mechanic knows a
[58:56.000 --> 59:01.800]  tax man well in America today all of us know the tax man don't we but they
[59:01.800 --> 59:05.320]  didn't at Jefferson's time how did that change well that changed when we got the
[59:05.320 --> 59:11.560]  Federal Reserve and we got the income tax in 1913 and we've lost over 99% of
[59:11.560 --> 59:16.240]  the purchasing power of the US dollar in that amount of time as well that's the
[59:16.240 --> 59:22.360]  legacy of the income tax the legacy of the Federal Reserve and now Donald
[59:22.360 --> 59:25.680]  Trump who criticized who said maybe we need to audit the Fed he criticized
[59:25.680 --> 59:29.600]  Janet Yellen now he's saying well I think Janet Yellen is pretty good we're
[59:29.600 --> 59:35.040]  gonna use her to weaken our currency because we're going to pretend that the
[59:35.040 --> 59:39.240]  Chinese are not manipulating their currency so the Chamber of Commerce is
[59:39.240 --> 59:43.080]  saying right now basically we're recommending to President Trump everything
[59:43.080 --> 59:46.680]  you have in your quiver please use every arrow possible with the
[59:46.680 --> 59:50.720]  understanding that some of these points of leverage that you're using will be
[59:50.720 --> 59:56.320]  counterproductive to us they say that of course Trump promised to curb US trade
[59:56.320 --> 1:00:01.640]  deficits with China they've reached 347 billion dollars not a problem now not a
[1:00:01.640 --> 1:00:06.440]  problem we will give them a free pass as long as we can engage in military
[1:00:06.440 --> 1:00:13.400]  adventurism abroad now according to the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce
[1:00:13.400 --> 1:00:17.640]  Beijing can offer subsidies of billions of dollars to domestic competitors
[1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:21.320]  that's part of the China price he said I'm sorry to see there is a possibility
[1:00:21.320 --> 1:00:25.760]  we may lose some momentum on helping to level the playing field with China in
[1:00:25.760 --> 1:00:30.360]  our economic relationship due to the situation in North Korea if there is
[1:00:30.360 --> 1:00:33.120]  some kind of a trade-off well you can believe that there is a trade-off Pat
[1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:37.920]  Buchanan pointed it out he said quoted President Trump who said why would I
[1:00:37.920 --> 1:00:41.040]  call China a currency manipulator when they're working with us on the North
[1:00:41.040 --> 1:00:48.000]  Korean problem so he said right there we see that Trump who once seemed to
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:52.120]  understand how America had taken us to the cleaners during and after the Cold
[1:00:52.120 --> 1:00:56.600]  War while allies supported us diplomatically they piled up huge trade
[1:00:56.600 --> 1:01:02.240]  surpluses at our expense and they became virtual free writers off of the US
[1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:07.640]  defense effort and so that's the Patrick Buchanan pointing that out he said
[1:01:07.640 --> 1:01:11.480]  a continuing crisis on the peninsula with Trump and the US relying on
[1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:15.240]  Beijing's help could leave Xi in the catbird seat and now that North Korea
[1:01:15.240 --> 1:01:18.680]  has declared its goal to be building missiles with nuclear warheads that could
[1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:22.520]  hit all US bases in Asia even California the clock is running for the White
[1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:27.600]  House Tillerson and Pence have said that they're running out of patience but the
[1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:31.320]  question is this how did we get to this point how do we get to this it's not
[1:01:31.320 --> 1:01:39.120]  Obama's fault okay I mean it you don't not gonna blame everything on Obama this
[1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:42.640]  is just as much Bush's fault and the Republicans fault this has been going on
[1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:46.920]  for 64 years and many people have said well other people could have done
[1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:49.400]  something about it now Donald Trump is gonna have to do something about it but
[1:01:49.400 --> 1:01:53.240]  how did we get into the Korean War we got into the Korean War because we
[1:01:53.240 --> 1:01:57.360]  decided we needed to be the world's policeman we decided that the first
[1:01:57.360 --> 1:02:01.280]  Americans who put America first the founders of our country didn't know what
[1:02:01.280 --> 1:02:05.800]  they were talking about when they said we don't go abroad seeking monsters to
[1:02:05.800 --> 1:02:10.640]  destroy and a good example of this is the Turkey election that's happening we
[1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:14.680]  get a civil war going on in Turkey and it's spilling over on to our shores the
[1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:20.640]  competition between Erdogan and Fatala Gulen is spilling into Europe as well
[1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:25.960]  this competition shows us something in Turkey there's not always a good guy and
[1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:31.480]  a bad guy sometimes there's just two really bad guys both Erdogan and
[1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:36.920]  Fatala Gulen are not secularists they want to preside over a caliphate a
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:42.600]  global caliphate if they will and so as we see their influence spread throughout
[1:02:42.600 --> 1:02:47.520]  Europe and throughout the United States and as we've seen in other places where
[1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:53.280]  we go into do regime change it always backfires even if we win a war we don't
[1:02:53.280 --> 1:02:58.280]  win the peace this whole thing about acting as a world's policeman is doomed
[1:02:58.280 --> 1:03:02.760]  to failure now when they said that we don't go abroad seeking monsters to
[1:03:02.760 --> 1:03:06.320]  destroy they were talking about getting involved in European wars we saw what
[1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:10.000]  happened with World War one that was an unnecessary war for us to get involved
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:15.440]  in what would they have said about the Middle East situation I mean even Ronald
[1:03:15.440 --> 1:03:20.720]  Reagan after the bombing in the Bay route said this I'm gonna get my troops
[1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:26.280]  out of here and he got his troops out of there but we continue to go in even
[1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:31.760]  though we see these regime changes like we had in Libya create a much worse
[1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:36.560]  problem as Pat Buchanan said why 64 years after the Korean War a quarter
[1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:39.760]  century after the Cold War are we still obliged to go to war to defend South
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:45.440]  Korea from a north with one half of the South Korean population and with three
[1:03:45.440 --> 1:03:49.440]  percent of its gross domestic product well I'll tell you why I'll tell you why
[1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:54.200]  Pat it's because we have put ourselves out there as protectors so it's now no
[1:03:54.200 --> 1:03:58.920]  longer an issue between North and South Korea they're coming after us we're the
[1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:02.960]  target now because we have said we're going to shut down all the monsters
[1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:07.720]  everywhere we know exactly what we're doing no we don't you know why should
[1:04:07.720 --> 1:04:11.080]  their nuclear missiles be America's primary responsibility why don't the
[1:04:11.080 --> 1:04:15.520]  South Koreans do something about it why do we have to be the world's policemen
[1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:20.720]  it is not going to work and now we have a situation where instead of following
[1:04:20.720 --> 1:04:25.360]  an America first policy instead of listening to the first Americans the
[1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:29.320]  founders of our country we have a situation where we got people like
[1:04:29.320 --> 1:04:35.200]  John McCain calling Rand Paul a Russian agent because he merely says that we
[1:04:35.200 --> 1:04:39.000]  don't we ought to have a debate before we set up another tripwire with a tiny
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:42.760]  country in Europe before we set up another possibility where we would have
[1:04:42.760 --> 1:04:47.400]  to go to war to defend them can't we see where this is all leading can't we see
[1:04:47.400 --> 1:04:52.240]  that this is a failed policy that's been 64 years in the making can't we put
[1:04:52.240 --> 1:04:57.000]  America first for once perhaps not stay with us be right back we're gonna have

[1:10:44.560 --> 1:10:49.000]  talking about censorship but I want to go to the tax issue right now we have
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:54.920]  Maxine Waters who chimed in on this let's hear what Maxine Waters has to
[1:10:54.920 --> 1:10:57.440]  say about taxes.
[1:10:57.440 --> 1:11:01.960]  Americans all over this country many are struggling to pay their taxes
[1:11:01.960 --> 1:11:07.000]  middle-income people working people and many have to pay taxes that they can't
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:12.480]  afford and here we are they are struggling to pay their taxes and this
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:16.560]  president basically laughing at us because remember doing the campaign he
[1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:20.760]  said I pay no taxes and I believe that and many people believe that.
[1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:25.680]  See that's the politics of envy she doesn't want you to pay attention to
[1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:29.280]  the taxes that you're struggling to pay now she wants to see Donald Trump's
[1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:32.560]  tax returns we want to know that Donald Trump is paying a lot of taxes does that
[1:11:32.560 --> 1:11:36.120]  make you would that make you feel any better to know that Donald Trump paid
[1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:42.360]  50% 75% 90% of his income in taxes when they're taking a bite out of your page
[1:11:42.360 --> 1:11:48.200]  check. See I don't really care about Donald Trump's tax returns I want Donald
[1:11:48.200 --> 1:11:53.000]  Trump's tax reforms that he campaigned on and that's the question are we going
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:57.880]  to see that? Mnuchin is saying that tax reform may be delayed because of the
[1:11:57.880 --> 1:12:02.080]  health care setback and of course this is US Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin
[1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:06.640]  he told the Financial Times at the Target to get tax reform through Congress
[1:12:06.640 --> 1:12:12.400]  on President Trump's desk before August was quote highly aggressive to not
[1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:15.800]  realistic at this point he says it's probably fair to say that it's been
[1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:19.600]  delayed a bit because of health care he also told the Financial Times that he
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:22.480]  agreed with Trump's view that the dollars strength in the short term was
[1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:26.840]  hurting exports so we can count on the Federal Reserve to weaken the dollar for
[1:12:26.840 --> 1:12:31.240]  us and maybe you're not going to get that health care repeal and because of
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:35.440]  the billions of dollars of taxes and health care that you're paying we're
[1:12:35.440 --> 1:12:38.400]  still going to have to keep your income taxes there see that's one of the
[1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:43.600]  reasons why we're having the increase in military action around the world to
[1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:48.520]  hide that but let's take a look at what's going on with the key numbers as the
[1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:52.840]  Hill points out they say key numbers on tax filing day they say 152 million
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:57.400]  individuals will be filing tax returns then IRS Commissioner John Koskinan
[1:12:57.400 --> 1:13:00.960]  said earlier this month this appears to be a the smoothest filing season the
[1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:06.280]  agency has had since he took office and he's still there and lowest learner is
[1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:10.800]  not being prosecuted see they lost their records didn't they when they were
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:17.400]  persecuting different organizations for their political views with holding
[1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:22.880]  their tax deductible access and of course for a an organization that they
[1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:25.080]  were friendly to it happened in just a couple of days some of these
[1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:30.160]  organizations that they would not give the 501c benefit to still haven't gotten
[1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:33.720]  it years later but you know I think it's interesting we see that they're now
[1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:37.600]  moving forward we got the ACLJ moving forward to try to get some of those
[1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:42.640]  records from the IRS but we got a story here on MarketWatch Americans get an F
[1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:46.840]  on the income tax quiz I think this is on the dread report and of course it's
[1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:52.720]  been like I said before 104 years think about the fact that in 1913 the standard
[1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:56.720]  deduction if you adjust it to today's dollars because remember the Federal
[1:13:56.720 --> 1:14:01.200]  Reserve has decimated the purchasing power of your dollar so that's not
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:05.240]  enough I mean decimated will only be one-tenth they've taken 99% of your
[1:14:05.240 --> 1:14:08.880]  purchasing power if you had the same standard deduction that you did back
[1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:13.880]  then that would be worth $98,000 today so you'd have to pay have to earn have a
[1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:19.560]  taxable income of more than $98,000 before you pay any taxes today that is
[1:14:19.560 --> 1:14:24.760]  only 12 and a half thousand dollars there's only 400 pages in 1913 the
[1:14:24.760 --> 1:14:31.760]  tax code today it's 75,000 you know the average Bible is only about 1200 and yet
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:36.880]  the IRS code is 75,000 Charles Murray said a law that is sufficiently
[1:14:36.880 --> 1:14:40.480]  complex is the same as having no law at all even the IRS doesn't know but they
[1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:44.800]  can use that against you as if it was lawless because it is so complex stay
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:47.600]  with us to be right back
[1:14:47.600 --> 1:14:54.800]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[1:14:54.800 --> 1:14:57.280]  network
[1:14:58.880 --> 1:15:03.360]  on Sunday Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones broke the news that Google contractors
[1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:06.960]  are being directed to write info or articles to push them even further down
[1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:10.840]  and search engine results and liberals came out of the woodwork to say we were
[1:15:10.840 --> 1:15:15.480]  lying well now we have business insider Google says rogue vendor violated
[1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:19.520]  guidelines by instructing contractors to rate info wars as untrustworthy site
[1:15:19.520 --> 1:15:23.200]  Google said that the vendor had mistakenly told staffers working for the
[1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:27.040]  search engine that info wars should be ranked as a low-quality site oh yeah we
[1:15:27.040 --> 1:15:30.480]  believe you Google we believe you Google reps are attempting to distance
[1:15:30.480 --> 1:15:33.480]  themselves from the contractors instructions by saying it does not
[1:15:33.480 --> 1:15:37.920]  instruct quality raters on how to grade specific websites let's read what the
[1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:42.040]  contractors said in their bonus example while CNN isn't a perfect news outlet it
[1:15:42.040 --> 1:15:45.400]  is a popular news source that covers stories with depth to compare the info
[1:15:45.400 --> 1:15:49.160]  wars article is brief and only mentioned statements from sources not typical of

[1:18:17.800 --> 1:18:21.120]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're gonna be talking
[1:18:21.120 --> 1:18:25.560]  to Lee Stranahan Lee Stranahan is formerly with Breitbart he knew
[1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:29.800]  Andrew Breitbart he also knows Steve Bannon he is now the editor of the
[1:18:29.800 --> 1:18:35.760]  populace.us he's a co-host on Fault Lines on Sputnik and he has a citizen
[1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:39.920]  journalism school you find that at citizenjournalismschool.com and I've
[1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:46.640]  seen Lee talk about journalism issues his periscopes that he has on Twitter you
[1:18:46.640 --> 1:18:51.920]  can follow him there at at Stranahan talking about the lazy thinking that is
[1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:55.320]  present when you say I'm just gonna discount this because of the source I'm
[1:18:55.320 --> 1:18:58.960]  not gonna pay any attention to the content here but now we're seeing this
[1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:04.720]  weaponized we're now seeing government censorship being outsourced to Google and
[1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:09.440]  these these articles that we said in the last couple of days the fact that they
[1:19:09.440 --> 1:19:14.760]  would use info wars as a poster child and say we're going to downrate the same
[1:19:14.760 --> 1:19:20.200]  story for info wars we're gonna upgrade it for CNN because we like CNN and we
[1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:24.120]  don't like info wars because info wars has bad reputation why because we tell
[1:19:24.120 --> 1:19:26.960]  you so they're not gonna talk about the stories they're gonna talk about the
[1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:30.240]  sites they're not even it's bad enough if they were gonna set themselves up as
[1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:34.080]  arbiters of individual articles but no they're going to say we're gonna take
[1:19:34.080 --> 1:19:39.760]  down entire sites so I want to go to Lee and I want to talk to him about that as
[1:19:39.760 --> 1:19:43.320]  well as we'll get his take on what's going on in the White House with Steve
[1:19:43.320 --> 1:19:47.880]  Bannon but let's talk about the outsourcing of censorship first and
[1:19:47.880 --> 1:19:53.800]  the demonizing of individual sources Lee. Yeah David I really appreciate you
[1:19:53.800 --> 1:19:57.880]  having me on you know I'm a big fan of yours and thanks so much well look I mean
[1:19:57.880 --> 1:20:03.320]  here's what's disturbing so I don't like the term fake news okay I prefer the
[1:20:03.320 --> 1:20:08.920]  term narrative driven news and here's why okay first off every news source in
[1:20:08.920 --> 1:20:14.160]  the world occasionally gets facts wrong does that make sense yeah and that's
[1:20:14.160 --> 1:20:19.360]  fine and you retract and that that's fine that's normal right and there are
[1:20:19.360 --> 1:20:24.720]  there is such a thing as fake news but the bigger problem I think is what I
[1:20:24.720 --> 1:20:28.200]  call narrative driven news which is this let's take a simple issue I'm gonna
[1:20:28.200 --> 1:20:32.600]  give just an example let's say immigration okay now let's say you've got
[1:20:32.600 --> 1:20:38.760]  two stories and they're both completely true one story is about a woman who came
[1:20:38.760 --> 1:20:44.120]  here illegally and she's got three kids she you know is worked for 20 years but
[1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:48.280]  she's here illegally and she's getting deported the second story is about a
[1:20:48.280 --> 1:20:52.960]  woman whose child was killed by an illegal alien who'd been deported three
[1:20:52.960 --> 1:20:56.960]  times okay now assume both of those stories are completely true because
[1:20:56.960 --> 1:21:02.120]  those things both happen does that make sense right which story is CNN gonna
[1:21:02.120 --> 1:21:08.360]  cover right yeah the deportation story of the victim yeah yeah and which stories
[1:21:08.360 --> 1:21:13.040]  Breitbart gonna cover which stories it you see what I'm saying right so so my
[1:21:13.040 --> 1:21:18.160]  point here is that what they don't like about sites like info wars is that
[1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:23.800]  you guys cover stories that are outside their narrative you're outside their
[1:21:23.800 --> 1:21:28.360]  normal lane and when we talk about the mainstream media I like to differentiate
[1:21:28.360 --> 1:21:33.840]  that because really what I define the mainstream media as is that group of
[1:21:33.840 --> 1:21:38.760]  media that all covered literally let me get a simple example right so as you
[1:21:38.760 --> 1:21:42.560]  mentioned I'm on Sputnik now right I have a Monday through Friday radio show
[1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:49.000]  in Sputnik that means I'm on a Russian propaganda network right now who decided
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:53.480]  I'm not saying that it's invalid to talk about Russia but who decided that the
[1:21:53.480 --> 1:21:58.920]  media would spend 99% of the time talking about Russia and how much do you
[1:21:58.920 --> 1:22:03.760]  hear the mainstream media talk about Saudi Arabia for instance okay I would
[1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:10.360]  argue that Saudi Arabia because they've helped promote Islamist terrorism
[1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:15.680]  through a group called the Muslim World League okay is a bigger story than
[1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:20.160]  Russia in terms of the actual threat and by the way of course Saudi Arabia
[1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:24.040]  contributed big to the Clinton Foundation also big contributors to John
[1:22:24.040 --> 1:22:27.280]  McCain yeah none of this is conjecture it's all accurate and by the way the
[1:22:27.280 --> 1:22:32.520]  Bushes remember remember the Michael Moore film showed showing George Bush
[1:22:32.520 --> 1:22:37.160]  holding hands with the Saudi Prince there remember yes so what I'm saying is
[1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:42.040]  is that they to me they're both you can talk about Russia okay fine talk about
[1:22:42.040 --> 1:22:47.800]  Russian but where's the reporting of Saudi Arabia for example in the mainstream
[1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:52.320]  media there are thanks for showing that by the way appreciate getting the picture
[1:22:52.320 --> 1:22:55.880]  up they're quick they're really quick yeah I want to go back to what you were
[1:22:55.880 --> 1:22:59.960]  saying too about the narrative driven media yeah because what I think is is
[1:22:59.960 --> 1:23:03.040]  really clear at you point at give a couple examples and say well this is a
[1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:07.360]  story you know we're showing somebody who is an immigrant and and they have
[1:23:07.360 --> 1:23:09.960]  family ties and they're being thrown out here somebody that's being thrown out
[1:23:09.960 --> 1:23:13.120]  because they were violent criminal right bars gonna cover that story CNN's gonna
[1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:17.360]  cover the first story right part of what I think is going on here too is the fact
[1:23:17.360 --> 1:23:21.840]  that CNN wants to say we're not narrative driven we're simply objective
[1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:26.240]  and that's what Google is doing for them and that's what the scam that Google is
[1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:30.080]  doing to all of us saying we're going to just put these articles up here based
[1:23:30.080 --> 1:23:34.440]  on what people are looking for and that's not the case Google is going out
[1:23:34.440 --> 1:23:40.360]  there and using political terms to up rate certain sites and certain stories
[1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:44.720]  and to down rate others based on a political agenda and so to me the issue
[1:23:44.720 --> 1:23:48.520]  is are people going to be honest with you about what their biases everybody's
[1:23:48.520 --> 1:23:53.120]  got a bias and always in the past we would see the same stories put out by
[1:23:53.120 --> 1:23:56.920]  ABC CBS NBC they would all choose to report the same stories and they would
[1:23:56.920 --> 1:24:00.360]  have the same angle now we have people who are coming out with a different
[1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:05.520]  narrative that we report the facts and we analyze the facts CNN reports the facts
[1:24:05.520 --> 1:24:09.360]  they analyze the facts but they tell you that their facts are the only facts that
[1:24:09.360 --> 1:24:13.240]  that they don't have an opinion and you have to understand that people exercise
[1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:16.720]  their opinion just in your example as to which story they're going to even report
[1:24:16.720 --> 1:24:20.600]  they could be totally factual but that shows you that they have a bias right
[1:24:20.600 --> 1:24:24.960]  there that is the that is the private that so let's talk about the choices you
[1:24:24.960 --> 1:24:29.240]  make as a journalist okay the first choice you make is whether to cover a
[1:24:29.240 --> 1:24:33.800]  story or not what do I cover today do I talk about Saudi Arabia or Russia do I
[1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:38.240]  talk about this murder or that murder does that make sense that story number
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:42.360]  one that's choice number one you make as a journalist every journalist every
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:48.680]  editor choice number two is the headline okay you can get bias right in the
[1:24:48.680 --> 1:24:55.480]  headline okay choice number three is where you choose to place facts in the story so
[1:24:55.480 --> 1:25:02.000]  you can put a fact lower down in the story and de-emphasize it or you can put
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:08.320]  it up top I every morning David I listen to National Public Radio Fox News and
[1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:13.280]  the BBC I listen to all three of them and the reason why is I try to get a
[1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:19.120]  balanced media diet then I also check I check info wars I check bright part but
[1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:24.200]  I checked slate I checked the Huffington Post and here's why I don't trust any of
[1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:28.560]  y'all I also do it for entertainment value I get a lot of entertainment out
[1:25:28.560 --> 1:25:32.880]  of looking at slate and Huffington Post are always good for my standpoint they
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:37.240]  are but on some stories I got to say here's the other thing I do as a
[1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:44.880]  journalist if I see somebody reporting one thing I look for the opposite let's
[1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:49.240]  take an example right this chemical attack that we're being told is by
[1:25:49.240 --> 1:25:56.560]  Bashar al-Assad okay now I think most people just want to know the truth was
[1:25:56.560 --> 1:26:01.360]  that was it Bashar al-Assad or not but the media the mainstream media is a
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:06.160]  hundred percent in it was Bashar al-Assad now anybody who's done a little
[1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:10.320]  bit of independent research on this just a little bit can start to go well
[1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:14.600]  there seem to be some legitimate questions we know the 2013 attack in
[1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:19.720]  Gota is very questionable actually it's it's better it's better right and so
[1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:26.040]  what's happened is the mainstream media likes to declare sites like info wars
[1:26:26.040 --> 1:26:29.640]  and Breitbart verboten you're not allowed and Sputnik too was
[1:26:29.640 --> 1:26:37.000]  remote listen to him and Alex Jones is nuts but Keith Oberman is passionate
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  right yeah exactly right and so and so what I'm saying is um Alex didn't invent
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:49.200]  being animated does that make sound like I don't know us to put it but he's not
[1:26:49.200 --> 1:26:53.880]  the first guy Chris Wallace is I mean Chris Matthews can be pretty animated
[1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:58.320]  oh yeah yeah he gets that throw-up and down his leg so that's exactly right
[1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:02.840]  that's exactly right and and so what I'm saying is what they want to do is they
[1:27:02.840 --> 1:27:07.360]  is they want to put people in a box and and and Milo at Breitbart was not the
[1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:10.800]  first guy to be purple who's more provocative Bill Maher Milo I don't
[1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:15.520]  know you know what I mean right people people there's different things I think
[1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:21.080]  the key is and this is what's making the mainstream media nuts every time I talk
[1:27:21.080 --> 1:27:26.800]  to people in the new media you or people from Breitbart or whoever and I talk
[1:27:26.800 --> 1:27:32.000]  about people can make up their own minds and people can figure it out I can you
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:36.120]  can I can David and all of the audience can't I can look at a New York Times
[1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:41.320]  story and I know what their bias is and I can filter that in I can look at an
[1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:45.360]  info war story and I know what it's where it comes from and I can filter that
[1:27:45.360 --> 1:27:49.800]  out and I can make up my own damn mind that's what's scary to them they're
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:54.720]  frightened to death that we can make up our own minds and and the wake-up call
[1:27:54.720 --> 1:27:58.000]  for them was Donald Trump being elected because whatever you thought about
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:02.800]  Donald Trump he wasn't supposed to win right he was supposed to lose and that's
[1:28:02.800 --> 1:28:07.720]  when they realized the genies out of the bottle and they can no longer control
[1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:17.920]  us the way that it's almost like there's an info war going on almost like that
[1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:23.200]  right and it's almost as if raised it just occurred to me you know they talk
[1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:26.360]  about the election being hacked what they're upset about is that for the
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:29.680]  first time they didn't control the entire narrative you're talking about how
[1:28:29.680 --> 1:28:31.920]  you look at different sources and I think back in the day when there were
[1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:36.560]  magazines that I turned to for information before the internet I used to
[1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:41.000]  have subscriptions to a lot of different magazines I had time I had Newsweek I had
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:46.280]  the nation I had national review I gave up on time in Newsweek because I didn't
[1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:49.480]  I didn't like it they were dishonest they were they said oh we're totally
[1:28:49.480 --> 1:28:54.120]  objective and it was it was pretty bland and disintersting I chose the the
[1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:57.000]  people who had a passionate point of view they would give you the facts and
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:00.440]  then they would argue from a point of view and they were honest about that the
[1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:03.560]  nation's coming at you from the left and national reviews coming at you from
[1:29:03.560 --> 1:29:06.720]  the right but they're honest about where they're coming from what I can't
[1:29:06.720 --> 1:29:12.360]  tolerate is this idea that somehow CNN doesn't have an agenda CNN doesn't have
[1:29:12.360 --> 1:29:15.560]  a bias with the stories that they pick or the angles that they pick on it which
[1:29:15.560 --> 1:29:18.000]  is what you talked about from the very beginning that's the thing I think is
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:23.720]  very very disturbing but I think it's also interesting how YouTube is and
[1:29:23.720 --> 1:29:29.040]  Google are moving against people also financially you know putting up boycotts
[1:29:29.040 --> 1:29:33.040]  saying well our advertisers are twisting our arms on this we just had this story
[1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:36.880]  from the New York Times that was on a dredge report yesterday how YouTube's
[1:29:36.880 --> 1:29:41.080]  shifting algorithms hurt independent media and they've got a guy 21 years old
[1:29:41.080 --> 1:29:46.640]  he's got 350,000 subscribers and all of a sudden his YouTube revenue went down to
[1:29:46.640 --> 1:29:53.400]  six cents in one day basically forcing him out of business why he didn't do
[1:29:53.400 --> 1:29:57.560]  anything profane he didn't do anything that was violent everything that he did
[1:29:57.560 --> 1:30:02.560]  on his channel conformed to broadcast standards but YouTube labeled him as
[1:30:02.560 --> 1:30:07.680]  being controversial so now we've taken you know another step away from well it's
[1:30:07.680 --> 1:30:10.560]  true or it's false or it's fake or whatever and they're going to be the
[1:30:10.560 --> 1:30:13.480]  arbiters of that now they're going to be the arbiters of what is
[1:30:13.480 --> 1:30:18.520]  controversial and they do it in the name of their advertisers how's that and I
[1:30:18.520 --> 1:30:24.840]  think it's a massively dumb commercial YouTube is creating right now a market
[1:30:24.840 --> 1:30:30.040]  opportunity for someone to come along I don't know if they've heard of this but
[1:30:30.040 --> 1:30:36.040]  apparently controversy is popular they should look into Howard Stern and Madonna
[1:30:36.040 --> 1:30:42.440]  going by this I'm dating but I'm dating myself right yeah but as long as I've
[1:30:42.440 --> 1:30:49.400]  been alive controversy has been popular and the fact is again they're
[1:30:49.400 --> 1:30:54.080]  creating you know God bless capitalism YouTube is creating a market opportunity
[1:30:54.080 --> 1:30:58.640]  for someone to come in and take all their money because the fact is
[1:30:58.640 --> 1:31:02.960]  advertisers at the end of the day want eyeballs and they don't want people who
[1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:12.600]  are legitimately hateful I'll put it like that right not fake hateful but
[1:31:12.600 --> 1:31:19.400]  legitimately hateful right that being said well I say that they don't want
[1:31:19.400 --> 1:31:24.920]  people who are legitimately hateful but then I don't know advertisers seem to
[1:31:24.920 --> 1:31:30.320]  still be on Saturday night live so maybe I'm missing something okay let's take it
[1:31:30.320 --> 1:31:33.400]  from there because talk about Saturday night live and as we look at these
[1:31:33.400 --> 1:31:36.760]  different narratives that they put out let's switch over now to a Bannon
[1:31:36.760 --> 1:31:42.200]  because he was he was singled out and they focused on him for a week and then
[1:31:42.200 --> 1:31:45.560]  they culminate that was a mainstream media's narrative every oh he's awful
[1:31:45.560 --> 1:31:50.200]  but he's really smart and he's Trump's brain trying to drive a wedge and they
[1:31:50.200 --> 1:31:53.120]  did it very successfully between him and Donald Trump at the end of the week
[1:31:53.120 --> 1:31:57.600]  Saturday night live does a skit with Bannon again trying to portray him as
[1:31:57.600 --> 1:32:02.560]  the evil genius behind Donald Trump and it seemed to be successful on Monday
[1:32:02.560 --> 1:32:08.600]  morning an hour after you had Morning Joe replay the Saturday night life skit
[1:32:08.600 --> 1:32:14.120]  pouring scorn on Trump and making fun of him and using Bannon to do that he
[1:32:14.120 --> 1:32:17.640]  tweeted out on my own boss and that sort of thing and now it seems to be moving
[1:32:17.640 --> 1:32:21.560]  in that direction it's a great example of how they single out an individual and
[1:32:21.560 --> 1:32:27.040]  destroy them but tell us what you think is happening within the White House
[1:32:27.040 --> 1:32:31.200]  Wars because we've seen a lot of a lot of press about what's going on between
[1:32:31.200 --> 1:32:35.920]  Kushner and Ivanka and Rex Tillerson bringing in Gary Cohen and the Goldman
[1:32:35.920 --> 1:32:40.400]  Sacks people and then Steve Bannon on the other side as they now want to say
[1:32:40.400 --> 1:32:43.600]  well he's out and they're trying to push him out in every way that they can and
[1:32:43.600 --> 1:32:47.960]  it seems like from the tweets that we got from Donald Trump that their wedge
[1:32:47.960 --> 1:32:53.680]  is seeming to work well yeah that it has and I've been reporting in this for a
[1:32:53.680 --> 1:32:58.040]  couple of weeks now specifically talking about Dina Powell who very few people
[1:32:58.040 --> 1:33:00.760]  have written about before I started talking to the periscope a couple weeks
[1:33:00.760 --> 1:33:05.600]  ago I wrote about Gary Cohen about a month and a half ago at Breitbart when I
[1:33:05.600 --> 1:33:11.680]  was there I'm a big advocate of Steve's but more importantly and I like Steve
[1:33:11.680 --> 1:33:15.760]  personally and he hired me but when I worked for Breitbart that being said
[1:33:15.760 --> 1:33:20.600]  this is not about Steve Bannon or about one person this is about the ideology
[1:33:20.600 --> 1:33:26.680]  that Donald Trump was elected on exactly this is about ideas this is a not not
[1:33:26.680 --> 1:33:29.960]  about Bannon being pushed out because someone doesn't like him this is about
[1:33:29.960 --> 1:33:35.040]  the ideas of populist nationalism which I think represents a legitimate third way
[1:33:35.040 --> 1:33:40.200]  in American politics so it's freaking everybody out okay now and let me say
[1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:44.840]  this let me say this Lee because I think the real issue here is as Donald Trump
[1:33:44.840 --> 1:33:48.400]  pointed out look he was on these issues before he met Bannon and so forth it
[1:33:48.400 --> 1:33:52.640]  isn't that Bannon came in and Donald Trump was in this position on the issues
[1:33:52.640 --> 1:33:56.080]  and Bannon completely turned him around to something else Bannon was helping him
[1:33:56.080 --> 1:34:00.160]  move forward with his agenda the people who are there now are the ones who are
[1:34:00.160 --> 1:34:04.040]  taking over Trump and pushing him in a different direction than he campaigned
[1:34:04.040 --> 1:34:07.560]  and that he won on that's the reality they're the ones who are his brain who
[1:34:07.560 --> 1:34:12.160]  are taking him over well I I have a piece up at the populist US right now
[1:34:12.160 --> 1:34:17.320]  it's that Ivanka piece that's the cover story right now and I'm doing something
[1:34:17.320 --> 1:34:21.120]  kind of different journalistically at the populist which is we listening but
[1:34:21.120 --> 1:34:26.920]  that story with with Ivanka up there at the top this is a big deal because let
[1:34:26.920 --> 1:34:30.760]  me partied with Trump haters prior to the inauguration that's the
[1:34:30.760 --> 1:34:36.560]  she did and I it's completely vetted every it's just a very factual layout of
[1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:41.000]  the story it's not a big narrative it's a very factual layout with everybody
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:47.160]  linked who was at this party she had a private dinner party that was hosted at
[1:34:47.160 --> 1:34:50.520]  the wife of Rupert Murdoch's house the person who put it together was Deena
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:57.160]  Powell for people to give Ivanka Trump advice one of the people there was the
[1:34:57.160 --> 1:35:02.480]  editor of Time magazine now let's go over this it's a woman Maggie Gray she's
[1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:10.120]  the editor of Time magazine Time magazine did a cover story on Steve Bannon
[1:35:10.120 --> 1:35:17.200]  that cover was part of what drove the wedge now Maggie Gray and now when you
[1:35:17.200 --> 1:35:23.440]  look at the list of people who is who was at this party they are all with with
[1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:27.520]  one exception what couldn't find any political information about everybody
[1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:32.960]  else is literally a Hillary supporter Tory Burch and Trump haters Maggie Gray
[1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:38.680]  from Time is very adamant she does not like Trump okay so if the argument is
[1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:41.880]  well we were trying to make the press like us that didn't work but I'm
[1:35:41.880 --> 1:35:45.320]  convinced hang on Lee we got to take a quick break we're gonna be right back

[1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:22.120]  this New York Times story talk about this as they try to blend everything down
[1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:28.080]  into a non-controversial media format that is a very important thing for you
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:31.600]  to support us and we really do appreciate you standing with us and
[1:41:31.600 --> 1:41:36.520]  standing behind us we need that support let's go back to Lee and Lee you were
[1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:39.800]  talking about what was going on you said you got a story that's up at the
[1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:45.840]  populist US which is talking about how Ivanka Trump partied with an
[1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:48.760]  auguration before the inauguration with a bunch of never-trumpers and how
[1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:52.920]  these people work their way inside I said is we're looking at the election you
[1:41:52.920 --> 1:41:57.200]  know we have a situation where if you have a landslide election election for
[1:41:57.200 --> 1:42:01.280]  somebody like Donald Trump I believed that they would step aside and then try
[1:42:01.280 --> 1:42:06.040]  to take over the White House after the fact and as we see these advisors that
[1:42:06.040 --> 1:42:09.360]  are being put into the White House that appears to be what's going on it's not
[1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:14.020]  Steve Bannon who is manipulating Trump it is these new advisors like Gary
[1:42:14.020 --> 1:42:19.520]  Cohen who are working against the agenda that Trump had that Bannon helped him to
[1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:23.520]  win on and that as Steve Bannon pointed out if they deliver on that agenda we
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:27.880]  will change the US for the better for a generation but if we don't it's gonna
[1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:34.120]  blow back in a very very bad way for freedom and for nationalism well and I
[1:42:34.120 --> 1:42:37.400]  also want to just correct something I said last time I was talking about the
[1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:42.000]  editor of time the editor of time is Nancy Gibbs forgive me I said another
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:46.480]  name the editor of time is Nancy Gibbs I just did that day because I wanted to
[1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:51.520]  show people an example of how people can make a mistake in journalism that was
[1:42:51.520 --> 1:42:56.960]  the only reason he was just a simple test but anyway nobody is perfect we all
[1:42:56.960 --> 1:42:59.880]  understand that as you point out it doesn't you know fake or not making
[1:42:59.880 --> 1:43:03.280]  mistakes nobody is perfect absolutely Nancy Gibbs is the editor of time look
[1:43:03.280 --> 1:43:08.560]  Steve Bannon said this if you saw him at CPAC with Ryan's previous he was asked
[1:43:08.560 --> 1:43:13.440]  a question he was asked do you think the media is gonna get nicer to Donald
[1:43:13.440 --> 1:43:17.920]  Trump and Steve said I'm paraphrasing but Steve basically said if you think the
[1:43:17.920 --> 1:43:23.760]  establishment is gonna give up their power and money you're crazy that's not
[1:43:23.760 --> 1:43:28.480]  gonna happen that's right it's an ongoing war we're we got a short break here
[1:43:28.480 --> 1:43:31.880]  okay and we're gonna come right back after the break stay with us we're
[1:43:31.880 --> 1:43:36.080]  talking to Lee strand-of-hand we'll be right back

[1:44:21.800 --> 1:44:25.200]  parts of the animal you use the meat for sustenance the fat for cooking but you
[1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:30.240]  use the bones for strength for the outside structure full of minerals and
[1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:34.000]  kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body this is the
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:38.640]  engine of the life essence I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were
[1:44:38.640 --> 1:44:42.240]  but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we
[1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:45.440]  were and this is a big part of it I know you're gonna want to check out caveman
[1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:50.520]  ultimate paleo formula for yourself and for worse life.com today
[1:44:50.520 --> 1:44:56.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:45:01.720 --> 1:45:10.560]  we are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the GCN radio
[1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:13.320]  network
[1:45:13.320 --> 1:45:20.880]  welcome back we're talking to Lee Stranahan you can find him on Twitter at
[1:45:20.880 --> 1:45:27.080]  Stranahan and as we're going to the break Lee was saying that Steve Bannon
[1:45:27.080 --> 1:45:30.920]  said of course they're gonna continue to fight and we saw them focus on fight him
[1:45:30.920 --> 1:45:35.160]  first quite frankly as the New York Times article pointed out nothing made
[1:45:35.160 --> 1:45:41.320]  Carl Rose stomach not like the nickname they gave him bushes brain they know how
[1:45:41.320 --> 1:45:46.120]  to drive a wedge between people and they have really focused on Bannon to drive
[1:45:46.120 --> 1:45:50.000]  that wedge against him so they can change the agenda so they can change the
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:54.880]  ideology of the Trump administration that he won on that he campaigned on with
[1:45:54.880 --> 1:45:57.760]  Steve now they're coming on with completely different agenda that's the
[1:45:57.760 --> 1:46:04.120]  thing that really concerns me Lee well it's the it is exactly the establishment
[1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:11.040]  globalist internationalist agenda that Donald Trump ran against that's what so
[1:46:11.040 --> 1:46:14.640]  disturbing about it let's just talk facts for a second here and you've done a
[1:46:14.640 --> 1:46:17.640]  great job of pointing some of this stuff out David and I really appreciate it
[1:46:17.640 --> 1:46:22.040]  because this is a story the media has did not want to touch for a while nobody
[1:46:22.040 --> 1:46:25.720]  was talking about Dean appell and you were one of the first I appreciate Dean
[1:46:25.720 --> 1:46:28.440]  Powell Gary Cohn let's talk about who they are they're both Goldman Sachs
[1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:35.360]  people right yes they're both connected to Gary Gary Cohn's a registered
[1:46:35.360 --> 1:46:41.280]  Democrat Dean appell is a Republican who worked in the Bush administration whose
[1:46:41.280 --> 1:46:47.360]  ex-husband was a president at Tanao Tanao is the company Doug Bands company
[1:46:47.360 --> 1:46:53.360]  that's connected to the Clinton Foundation and who that Huma Abedin whose
[1:46:53.360 --> 1:46:58.520]  Hillary Clinton's top assistant worked for by the way who's Huma Abedin friends
[1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:02.760]  with I wrote about this at Breitbart last year Ivanka Trump yes well says
[1:47:02.760 --> 1:47:10.240]  Ivanka Trump friends with Chelsea Clinton now does does any of this mean is
[1:47:10.240 --> 1:47:14.280]  this just guilt by association is what does this mean here's what it means
[1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:20.080]  these are people who are marinating in the swamp okay yeah these are people who
[1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:26.600]  I mean Dean appell and let's call her Dina Habib Powell nobody everybody is
[1:47:26.600 --> 1:47:31.400]  dropping the middle name because it points out her Egyptian origins but you
[1:47:31.400 --> 1:47:36.560]  know she was a she was brought in and and last summer we had the Washington
[1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:40.840]  post talking about Ivanka Trump and they said she sounds like she's supporting
[1:47:40.840 --> 1:47:44.880]  Hillary Clinton because on all these women's issues yes sounds exactly like
[1:47:44.880 --> 1:47:48.440]  Hillary Clinton well who was advising her on the women's issues it was Dina
[1:47:48.440 --> 1:47:52.000]  Habib Powell was advising her on the women's issues and now she's on the
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:56.360]  National Security Council as they pushed General Flynn out that's and push
[1:47:56.360 --> 1:48:01.480]  Steve Bannon out yes as they brought up Steve Bannon and right before we dropped
[1:48:01.480 --> 1:48:08.240]  missiles on Syria for something that was not proven yes I'm sorry that the the
[1:48:08.240 --> 1:48:13.160]  origin of that attack the people who reported it are pro-rebel all the media
[1:48:13.160 --> 1:48:17.320]  came from pro-rebel groups anybody who's paid any attention to Syria and I went
[1:48:17.320 --> 1:48:21.920]  over to Lebanon 2013 myself to do the investigation anybody who's paid any
[1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:26.440]  attention knows that these people lie and that that were the bad guys in this
[1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:31.880]  is it the Democrats like Barack Obama yes is it Republicans like John McCain
[1:48:31.880 --> 1:48:39.160]  yes right and so and so when you have people like I refer to John McCain and
[1:48:39.160 --> 1:48:44.040]  Lindsey Graham is the ambiguously Republican duo when you have people
[1:48:44.040 --> 1:48:50.440]  sorry for them when you have people like John McCain I'm not saying anything
[1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:57.440]  David but we have people like John McCain and Lindsey Graham suddenly coming out
[1:48:57.440 --> 1:49:01.880]  and praising Trump they get a little nervous about that I got to say or
[1:49:01.880 --> 1:49:06.720]  Elliott Abrams who comes out and says now he's finally president and then the
[1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:09.960]  next thing you see in the press from Elliott Abrams is the first thing
[1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:13.600]  Trump Trump's got to do is get rid of Bannon and for for easy target they've
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:17.400]  been trying to look and I write about this on the popular I by the way for
[1:49:17.400 --> 1:49:21.840]  anybody trying to find I got a point out it's you got to put in the THE populist
[1:49:21.840 --> 1:49:27.800]  it's not populist it's VHE populist right yeah so if you if you go to the
[1:49:27.800 --> 1:49:33.840]  populist Ivan another piece up there right I go through the timeline of how
[1:49:33.840 --> 1:49:38.280]  these people came into power I go I go I'm doing something a little different
[1:49:38.280 --> 1:49:43.080]  I'm not doing stories exactly and that's very important people need to
[1:49:43.080 --> 1:49:46.200]  understand I was concerned about the direction this administration was headed
[1:49:46.200 --> 1:49:49.720]  when I started seeing the people who were being brought in it has an effect
[1:49:49.720 --> 1:49:53.520]  this isn't just inside politics folks this isn't just gossip or Game of Thrones
[1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:57.120]  it has real consequences stay with us gonna be right back with least ran a
[1:49:57.120 --> 1:50:04.280]  hand according to the mainstream media President Donald Trump was mean to kids
[1:50:04.280 --> 1:50:09.720]  on Easter Sunday that's right dozens of news outlets ran with a misleading
[1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:14.480]  video that was spread by Politico yesterday claiming that President Trump
[1:50:14.480 --> 1:50:19.320]  signed a kids make America great again at and then threw it away from the kid
[1:50:19.320 --> 1:50:24.480]  into the crowd the video quickly went viral racking up nearly 10,000 retweets
[1:50:24.480 --> 1:50:29.120]  and getting picked up by other news outlets the Washington Post reported
[1:50:29.120 --> 1:50:33.880]  Trump using a thick sharpie put his signature on the bill of the cap then
[1:50:33.880 --> 1:50:39.200]  looked up and lobbed it into the crowd nowhere near the hand that had given it
[1:50:39.200 --> 1:50:43.600]  to him BuzzFeed even claimed that the poor kid never got his hat back but in
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:48.440]  reality other camera angles clearly show the president and the kid were just
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:53.560]  having fun and the boy indeed caught his hat signed by the president of the
[1:50:53.560 --> 1:50:58.840]  United States you can see the videos for yourself right now at info wars.com

[1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:48.000]  before the break about how this is not just a court intrigue this is not just
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:52.360]  political gossip this is not a game of thrones it has real consequences when
[1:55:52.360 --> 1:55:55.360]  these people are brought in we see that Flynn was immediately removed from the
[1:55:55.360 --> 1:55:58.960]  National Security Council as soon as Bannon was removed as you point out as
[1:55:58.960 --> 1:56:02.560]  many of us have pointed out we had these attacks the next day who were they
[1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:07.720]  replaced by McMasters and by Dina Habib Powell a Goldman Sachs person so we're
[1:56:07.720 --> 1:56:12.520]  seeing a change in the agenda that Donald Trump ran on and that's going to
[1:56:12.520 --> 1:56:16.480]  happen when you've got advisors that are not with you advisors who did not
[1:56:16.480 --> 1:56:21.040]  campaign on the same agenda but who were actually hardcore Democrats all their
[1:56:21.040 --> 1:56:25.200]  lives all always supporting Hillary Clinton and I want people to understand
[1:56:25.200 --> 1:56:30.600]  this is not 4d chess this is not keep your enemies you know friends close keep
[1:56:30.600 --> 1:56:34.320]  your enemies closer that's right let me explain what's happening here this is
[1:56:34.320 --> 1:56:38.400]  from ins people inside the White House it's not from Steve Bannon I did not
[1:56:38.400 --> 1:56:42.120]  hear this from Steve Bannon what will happen and this has been going on for a
[1:56:42.120 --> 1:56:45.440]  couple of months now is that they'll have policy meetings in the White House
[1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:50.160]  and Jared and Ivanka would sit there quietly and observe the policy meetings
[1:56:50.160 --> 1:56:58.440]  okay then when the policy people leave they stay and then they talk to Trump
[1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:02.680]  follow me yeah this is what's been happening and this is directly from
[1:57:02.680 --> 1:57:08.560]  sources I have inside the White House okay now and of course Kushner brought
[1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:12.840]  in the architect of Obamacare they brought him in multiple times
[1:57:12.840 --> 1:57:17.240]  Rami manuals brother Zika manual the architect of Obamacare Gary Cohen has
[1:57:17.240 --> 1:57:20.440]  brought in the guy who is the architect of TPP and they're trying to push back
[1:57:20.440 --> 1:57:25.400]  against NAFTA so they're coming at it from a traditional Democrat perspective
[1:57:25.400 --> 1:57:28.320]  saying we're not going to repeal Obamacare and we're not really going to do
[1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:32.200]  anything when after Trump got TPP repealed one of the first things he did
[1:57:32.200 --> 1:57:35.440]  but what's going to happen at this point after these people come in that's the
[1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:39.200]  key thing and we see the Washington Post saying now they're moving to a centrist
[1:57:39.200 --> 1:57:44.200]  position oh that's all good they don't have an ideology and moderate yeah that's
[1:57:44.200 --> 1:57:47.440]  right that's right the same thing we were talking about before that that you
[1:57:47.440 --> 1:57:52.480]  have these other like CNN they pretend they don't have a perspective they don't
[1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:55.760]  have a narrative that they're selling and now they're saying these advisors
[1:57:55.760 --> 1:57:59.680]  they're they're moderate their centrist they don't have an agenda it's only the
[1:57:59.680 --> 1:58:02.620]  people that were with Trump when he got elected they're the ones with the
[1:58:02.620 --> 1:58:06.960]  agenda well and let's leave policy aside for a second David because you and I
[1:58:06.960 --> 1:58:11.680]  would agree I think that these are bad policies but to some extent that's an
[1:58:11.680 --> 1:58:15.320]  opinion in other words you can have different views on policy right but
[1:58:15.320 --> 1:58:20.480]  let's talk about the politics of this for a second this is an absolute disaster
[1:58:20.480 --> 1:58:24.840]  these people are trying to kneecap the Trump administration because the fact is
[1:58:24.840 --> 1:58:29.860]  if Donald Trump nobody who voted for Trump supported him because he was
[1:58:29.860 --> 1:58:34.080]  moderate you follow me nobody that's right and what's gonna happen is they're
[1:58:34.080 --> 1:58:39.360]  gonna gut his support and then they have so damaged Trump do you think there's
[1:58:39.360 --> 1:58:45.000]  any liberals we're gonna go well I don't know he did hire a guy from TPP I
[1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:49.240]  think he's coming around I'm not no no no he's not gonna pick up anybody from
[1:58:49.240 --> 1:58:53.520]  the other side so so what they know is they know Trump's at about a 40% approval
[1:58:53.520 --> 1:58:59.400]  rating if you lose half of that you're down to about a 10%
[1:58:59.400 --> 1:59:05.520]  because if you lose half of the 40% who support him you follow me yeah 50% of
[1:59:05.520 --> 1:59:10.520]  the 40% is 20% of that you're down to about a 10% 20% approval rating which
[1:59:10.520 --> 1:59:14.720]  is exactly where they want him the establishment wants to take Donald
[1:59:14.720 --> 1:59:18.880]  Trump down and salt the earth under him which is why they're going after Steve
[1:59:18.880 --> 1:59:23.120]  Bannon and it's again it's not about Steve personally it's about the agenda
[1:59:23.120 --> 1:59:29.040]  this was the first candidate who actually took on issues took on the media
[1:59:29.040 --> 1:59:34.080]  took on the establishment in a way that showed some Hutzpah and Cajones if I
[1:59:34.080 --> 1:59:40.320]  can mix my different languages but yeah but he was able to do that now they
[1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:44.960]  have to destroy him and they got to him through his family so it's not it's not
[1:59:44.960 --> 1:59:51.080]  Game of Thrones but it's Shakespearean kind of right they're they're using his
[1:59:51.080 --> 1:59:55.880]  family to get to him to look Trump's got an ego in the same way about you don't
[1:59:55.880 --> 2:00:02.360]  wake up one morning and decide you know what the country really needs me me and
[2:00:02.360 --> 2:00:05.840]  not have some ego right everybody wants a president every one of them's got some
[2:00:05.840 --> 2:00:10.880]  ego that's right and what we see now they're saying now the discussion is no
[2:00:10.880 --> 2:00:16.560]  longer nationalism versus globalism but it's combat versus collaboration we want
[2:00:16.560 --> 2:00:20.360]  you to be a nice guy as you're pointing out trump didn't win because he was a
[2:00:20.360 --> 2:00:24.000]  collaborator okay and we don't want to see him be a collaborator and we don't
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:28.360]  want to see them use this game that the Democrats will always use they'll always
[2:00:28.360 --> 2:00:31.400]  say well you know they'll they'll fight like mad when they're in power but when
[2:00:31.400 --> 2:00:35.400]  the Republicans get well you need to work with us we all need to agree on a
[2:00:35.400 --> 2:00:38.560]  consensus here and that's the same thing they're doing now because they're a
[2:00:38.560 --> 2:00:40.720]  bunch of Democrats the same thing they're doing now in the White House are
[2:00:40.720 --> 2:00:45.200]  saying we need to collaborate on this no more this combat you're either with us
[2:00:45.200 --> 2:00:49.920]  or you're against us and we're gonna shut this thing down as we move to the
[2:00:49.920 --> 2:00:53.960]  center as we moderate the message well and here's the other thing they've managed
[2:00:53.960 --> 2:00:57.520]  to do and and there this is an I know we're almost done but this is really
[2:00:57.520 --> 2:01:03.560]  important the big person is not Bannon who they've managed to separate Trump
[2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:09.400]  from do you know who they managed to separate Trump from you yes the people
[2:01:09.400 --> 2:01:14.400]  yes the people they've managed to separate Trump from the crowds that were
[2:01:14.400 --> 2:01:19.200]  giving him feedback every day do you think if Trump came out and said hey
[2:01:19.200 --> 2:01:24.440]  everybody what do you think of the idea we're gonna be more moderate crickets
[2:01:24.440 --> 2:01:29.800]  right that's right that's right the Trump crowds that's what they managed to
[2:01:29.800 --> 2:01:33.360]  do and so we can't let that happen if you're a Trump supporter be a Trump
[2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:36.960]  supporter and hold them accountable Trump Trump support we didn't elect a king
[2:01:36.960 --> 2:01:40.480]  that would be Don King and that's a totally different hairstyle well you
[2:01:40.480 --> 2:01:43.240]  know that's very important because when you're talking about this we have people
[2:01:43.240 --> 2:01:48.080]  pushing on the ship of state and if we set there and say he's just playing 40
[2:01:48.080 --> 2:01:51.840]  chests we need to set back and we need to not put any pressure on him well guess
[2:01:51.840 --> 2:01:55.760]  what he's getting plenty of pressure from the Democrats he's getting plenty of
[2:01:55.760 --> 2:02:00.240]  pressure from Jared Kushner who pushing him in one direction and if you don't
[2:02:00.240 --> 2:02:04.760]  push back if you don't say wait a minute you promised us on these issues we
[2:02:04.760 --> 2:02:09.280]  want you to deliver on these issues that we elected you on if you the Trump
[2:02:09.280 --> 2:02:14.040]  voter don't push back he's going to say well there's no resistance over here and
[2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:16.640]  I'm getting a lot of resistance over here it's gonna be very easy for them to
[2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:21.320]  move him in that that direction when you voted for Trump if you voted for Trump
[2:02:21.320 --> 2:02:25.000]  you did not abdicate your responsibilities as a citizen that's right to
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  be to be informed and to hold him accountable particularly when he's
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:34.080]  going against what he ran on and this idea that some people have and it's a
[2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:39.520]  small it's a small percentage David but it's it's a large enough where it
[2:02:39.520 --> 2:02:45.120]  bothers me we should be better than Obama supporters who blindly went along
[2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:49.640]  with Obamacare even after he switched in the primaries from being against the
[2:02:49.640 --> 2:02:54.040]  individual mandate suddenly he's for it right yes yes and I've seen this too
[2:02:54.040 --> 2:02:58.440]  often when I was at the DNC convention in Philadelphia and we're talking to them
[2:02:58.440 --> 2:03:02.680]  about look at this corruption in your party look at the exposed emails where
[2:03:02.680 --> 2:03:05.320]  they're they're shutting this down unfairly against Bernie Sanders don't
[2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:08.360]  you anything so oh it's not about that it's about those bad Russians I don't
[2:03:08.360 --> 2:03:11.520]  want to see anything I don't want to hear anything and and that's what I'm
[2:03:11.520 --> 2:03:15.400]  seeing from a lot of Trump supporters and I've pointed this out I said look we're
[2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:20.080]  about ideology we're not about idolatry we're not following the man blindly
[2:03:20.080 --> 2:03:24.960]  because of who he is we're trying to help him be Trump we're not trying to and
[2:03:24.960 --> 2:03:27.920]  and that's the whole thing about banning we're trying to help him be Trump we're
[2:03:27.920 --> 2:03:31.040]  not trying to change him into something that he never was which is what these
[2:03:31.040 --> 2:03:35.920]  people like Gary Cohen are trying to do in the administration now Donald Trump is
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:40.440]  this is the deal it's real straightforward if you're Ivanka Trump and
[2:03:40.440 --> 2:03:44.640]  you're Jared Kushner and you move in New York social circles yes Donald Trump
[2:03:44.640 --> 2:03:48.800]  being related to you is embarrassing every single day yes does that make
[2:03:48.800 --> 2:03:51.360]  does that make sense I mean that's one of the reasons why they pushed back
[2:03:51.360 --> 2:03:56.520]  against the Paris Climate Treaty they had great movements from Trump's pick at
[2:03:56.520 --> 2:04:00.520]  EPA Pruitt and Trump signed this executive order but they would not put in
[2:04:00.520 --> 2:04:04.280]  a pushback against the Endangerment Clause or the Paris Climate Treaty why
[2:04:04.280 --> 2:04:08.320]  because that would embarrass them with their social circle with Justin Trudeau
[2:04:08.320 --> 2:04:13.000]  and others that they value so highly you know Ivanka Trump is literally
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  Leonardo DiCaprio Google it Ivanka Trump Leonardo DiCaprio went to Trump Tower
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:25.400]  get gave her a DVD to give to Trump look Ivanka Trump fine do go do your
[2:04:25.400 --> 2:04:29.400]  business go everyone liked Ivanka Trump when she was helping run the hotels and
[2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:33.640]  shitter fashion business and that's nobody thought Ivanka Trump and Jared
[2:04:33.640 --> 2:04:38.960]  Kushner would be in the Oval Office every day and because they are they are
[2:04:38.960 --> 2:04:44.440]  fair game for criticism this is not Barron Trump this is not the Obama kids
[2:04:44.440 --> 2:04:49.160]  even push their adults and it's going to destroy them as well because the
[2:04:49.160 --> 2:04:52.520]  Democrats are not going to embrace them if they lose their base it's really
[2:04:52.520 --> 2:04:56.360]  gonna destroy Jared and Ivanka as well thank you so much least ran a hand you

[2:09:20.600 --> 2:09:24.320]  Knight we just talked to at least ran and I'm gonna give you a couple more
[2:09:24.320 --> 2:09:29.040]  headlines here about what's going on with the with Facebook as well as with
[2:09:29.040 --> 2:09:33.560]  Google and other journalism issues very interesting interview with Lee
[2:09:33.560 --> 2:09:40.280]  because we have to understand that what is going on in the White House has real
[2:09:40.280 --> 2:09:45.800]  consequences not only for Jared and Ivanka it's not gonna work out well for
[2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:49.760]  them they're not going to find that the Democrats are gonna ever embrace them
[2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:54.720]  but they can very easily alienate the Trump voters as well so as they push
[2:09:54.720 --> 2:10:00.840]  Trump away from the agenda on which he won it's not a good thing even for the
[2:10:00.840 --> 2:10:03.760]  Trump family I understand that Donald Trump needs people around him that he
[2:10:03.760 --> 2:10:07.280]  believes that he can trust but they're bringing in people who are going to be
[2:10:07.280 --> 2:10:12.600]  presenting him information briefs dossiers that are going to push him in
[2:10:12.600 --> 2:10:16.880]  a particular direction and that's what we were talking about with the
[2:10:16.880 --> 2:10:21.720]  mainstream media when they come in and say look you can trust CNN but you can't
[2:10:21.720 --> 2:10:27.480]  trust info wars oh why would that be well because CNN is establishment
[2:10:27.480 --> 2:10:31.520]  they're they're moderate their centrist info wars is not and that's the same
[2:10:31.520 --> 2:10:35.160]  type of skewing that is going on the White House with the advisors who are
[2:10:35.160 --> 2:10:40.160]  around him that's the key when you pick people to advise you when you pick your
[2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:45.440]  news sources you can pretty much skew people by the information that you feed
[2:10:45.440 --> 2:10:49.640]  them and the stuff that you keep away from them and again today we had Google
[2:10:49.640 --> 2:10:53.920]  coming back and saying you know that singling out of info wars was just a
[2:10:53.920 --> 2:10:58.280]  rogue vendor who was doing it well the fact remains that Google is not only
[2:10:58.280 --> 2:11:04.280]  going to tell you who is fake and who is true they're going to put those labels
[2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:07.200]  on individual stories that would be bad enough as I said but they're going to do
[2:11:07.200 --> 2:11:13.400]  it into entire news sites and that is indefensible quite frankly they're being
[2:11:13.400 --> 2:11:16.800]  used by the government and a private public partnership to outsource
[2:11:16.800 --> 2:11:23.240]  censorship. I want to go to the election news that's coming up as well but before
[2:11:23.240 --> 2:11:27.800]  we do I just want to remind you that the sale that we have had at infowarstore.com
[2:11:27.800 --> 2:11:32.360]  the Easter mega specials that we had that will be ending tonight and these

[2:11:55.760 --> 2:12:02.080]  easy to to take a large variety and diversity of vitamins and minerals so
[2:12:02.080 --> 2:12:05.520]  you don't have to take a lot of pills that's what I like about drinking my
[2:12:05.520 --> 2:12:09.800]  supplements or putting it under my tongue so I don't have to get a B12 shot I
[2:12:09.800 --> 2:12:13.640]  can just put secret 12 under my tongue you can get all that for 25% off that's
[2:12:13.640 --> 2:12:18.280]  going to be ending today and also brain force is now 30% off that will also be
[2:12:18.280 --> 2:12:23.800]  ending today as part of our Easter mega specials we've got an election that is
[2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:28.800]  going to be happening today it's all in progress right now in Georgia and we're
[2:12:28.800 --> 2:12:32.400]  gonna talk about that on the other side of the break these stories that we've
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:36.080]  got about Facebook there's a couple of these like they keep talking about how
[2:12:36.080 --> 2:12:39.760]  they're going to take down fake news and they're doing this in France there's
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:45.440]  scrambling to take down accounts that are pro Le Pen before this election and
[2:12:45.440 --> 2:12:49.800]  this is coming up in just six days so they're removing accounts that they
[2:12:49.800 --> 2:12:55.080]  think are favorable to Marine Le Pen because they don't like her politically
[2:12:55.080 --> 2:12:58.000]  that's the way they're using the censorship that is all ideologically
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:03.120]  based they have algorithms that will do it they have moderators who will do it
[2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:08.080]  and put a course at the same time we've got the Facebook moderators who are
[2:13:08.080 --> 2:13:13.640]  maybe facing criminal charges in the UK because they did not take down violent
[2:13:13.640 --> 2:13:18.000]  and pedophile videos when they were told about it and so now the UK
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:23.360]  government says if you hire moderators to do this people report this content to
[2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:27.920]  you celebrating the terrorist attacks in Egypt against Christians or showing a
[2:13:27.920 --> 2:13:32.680]  violent pedophile attack somebody reports that to you and you it's Facebook
[2:13:32.680 --> 2:13:36.280]  with your moderators you don't take that down you now own that and we're going to
[2:13:36.280 --> 2:13:40.080]  look at criminal charges against you so we see that type of thing that got
[2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:45.000]  virtually no coverage we talked about it here after a drudge picked up on that
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:48.400]  but all you've heard about is the Facebook killer and of course he
[2:13:48.400 --> 2:13:51.120]  committed suicide today everybody's going to be talking about that nobody's
[2:13:51.120 --> 2:13:55.360]  going to talk about the fact that Facebook did not take down terrorist and
[2:13:55.360 --> 2:14:00.440]  pedophile videos in the UK but they aren't taking down pro Le Pen accounts
[2:14:00.440 --> 2:14:05.080]  and they have also and this is also coming out of the UK after they looked
[2:14:05.080 --> 2:14:08.320]  at this situation where they refused to take down that objectionable content
[2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:13.680]  another investigation the UK found paid for hoaxes about high-profile public
[2:14:13.680 --> 2:14:19.400]  figures next to the user's news feeds duping them to click to alleged scam
[2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:23.280]  websites they say the revelation came days after a Times investigation
[2:14:23.280 --> 2:14:27.960]  exposed terrorist and child pornography content on Facebook they say in the
[2:14:27.960 --> 2:14:32.280]  latest incidents users have reported hoaxes concerning Lord sugar I don't
[2:14:32.280 --> 2:14:35.760]  know trigger is Stephen Hawking and the Queen that take them to websites
[2:14:35.760 --> 2:14:41.480]  mimicking news sites such as the Sun so again you have more information about
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:44.880]  Facebook that people don't want to pay attention to they only want to look at
[2:14:44.880 --> 2:14:47.600]  the Facebook killer when we come back we're going to talk about the election
[2:14:47.600 --> 2:14:53.680]  stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[2:14:53.680 --> 2:14:57.160]  GCN radio network
[2:14:57.160 --> 2:15:03.280]  on Sunday Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones broke the news that Google contractors
[2:15:03.280 --> 2:15:06.840]  are being directed to write info wars articles to push them even further down
[2:15:06.840 --> 2:15:10.760]  and search engine results and liberals came out of the woodwork to say we were
[2:15:10.760 --> 2:15:15.400]  lying well now we have business insider Google says rogue vendor violated
[2:15:15.400 --> 2:15:19.400]  guidelines by instructing contractors to rate info wars as untrustworthy site
[2:15:19.400 --> 2:15:23.080]  Google said that the vendor had mistakenly told staffers working for the
[2:15:23.080 --> 2:15:26.560]  search engine that info wars should be ranked as a low-quality site oh yeah
[2:15:26.560 --> 2:15:30.360]  we believe you Google we believe you Google reps are attempting to distance
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:33.320]  themselves from the contractors instructions by saying it does not
[2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:37.720]  instruct quality rangers on how to grade specific websites let's read what
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:41.400]  the contractor said in their bonus example while CNN isn't a perfect news
[2:15:41.400 --> 2:15:44.960]  outlet it is a popular news source that covers stories with depth to compare the
[2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:48.200]  info wars article is brief and only mentioned statements from sources not
[2:15:48.200 --> 2:15:52.000]  typical of course they're talking about the recent Syrian chemical attack that
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:56.160]  we're saying is a false flag and is now being proven in spades Robb you're

[2:17:59.520 --> 2:18:22.440]  we now take you live to the central Texas Command Center in the heart of the
[2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:28.840]  resistance it's Alex Jones welcome out to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight
[2:18:28.840 --> 2:18:34.080]  and today is a special election in Georgia this is a replacement for Tom
[2:18:34.080 --> 2:18:38.200]  Price who was brought into the Trump administration as the director of health
[2:18:38.200 --> 2:18:42.520]  and human services and it's kind of interesting because this has been a race
[2:18:42.520 --> 2:18:48.680]  that has attracted a lot of outside money even outside volunteers as one of
[2:18:48.680 --> 2:18:52.640]  the Hollywood people coming in Alyssa Milano a Hollywood actress came in she
[2:18:52.640 --> 2:18:56.960]  said it's the seat heard around the world everybody is watching all the
[2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:01.280]  recent special elections have taken on a certain symbolism of resistance this is
[2:19:01.280 --> 2:19:06.560]  an opportunity the left the Democrats think they have of pushing back against
[2:19:06.560 --> 2:19:12.120]  Trump and so they're all in they put in eight point three million dollars into
[2:19:12.120 --> 2:19:16.560]  this race in just three months and three million dollars has been put in to
[2:19:16.560 --> 2:19:20.800]  answer this by the GOP mostly to point out how much outside money is coming in
[2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:26.600]  from the Democrats so that's the the tenor of most of the GOP money and this
[2:19:26.600 --> 2:19:31.080]  is also interesting because there's so many different candidates in there 17
[2:19:31.080 --> 2:19:35.200]  18 different candidates I think 11 Republicans six Democrats in this one
[2:19:35.200 --> 2:19:39.600]  race and the deal is it's going to go to a runoff for the top two vote-getters
[2:19:39.600 --> 2:19:45.160]  unless one of the candidates gets beyond 50% so they've really focused on this
[2:19:45.160 --> 2:19:50.280]  one Democrat so there's a lot of outside money a lot of people have pulled up
[2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:55.800]  stakes and moved to this district in Georgia to help to knock on doors and
[2:19:55.800 --> 2:19:59.960]  call people up on the phone a lot of volunteers from New York and other
[2:19:59.960 --> 2:20:03.160]  places so it's outside money outside volunteers and you know the most
[2:20:03.160 --> 2:20:07.760]  interesting thing that broke today is maybe it's even an outside candidate now
[2:20:07.760 --> 2:20:10.560]  I'm not talking about somebody who's outside of the establishment no he's
[2:20:10.560 --> 2:20:15.680]  very firmly within the establishment but he's actually outside the district
[2:20:15.680 --> 2:20:19.920]  here's this report from CNN earlier today
[2:20:19.920 --> 2:20:23.400]  urge folks to make their voices heard and consider sending some fresh
[2:20:23.400 --> 2:20:27.840]  leadership to Washington Mr. Ross up is it true that you cannot vote for
[2:20:27.840 --> 2:20:33.200]  yourself he can't vote for himself well I grew up in this district I grew up in
[2:20:33.200 --> 2:20:36.400]  this community no one knew there was going to be an election coming I've
[2:20:36.400 --> 2:20:39.920]  been living with Alicia my girlfriend at 12 years down by Emory University where
[2:20:39.920 --> 2:20:43.640]  she's a full-time medical student and as soon as she concludes her medical
[2:20:43.640 --> 2:20:46.760]  training I'll be 10 minutes back up the street into the district where I grew up
[2:20:46.760 --> 2:20:50.880]  but I want to support her in her career and do right by her so when are you
[2:20:50.880 --> 2:20:57.240]  going to marry her well I don't want to give anything away but I think I could
[2:20:57.240 --> 2:21:00.280]  reasonably say that's more of a personal question I'll give you a call when I
[2:21:00.280 --> 2:21:08.520]  have something to announce please do perhaps say an election yeah your point
[2:21:08.520 --> 2:21:12.400]  is that you don't live in your the district in which you're running so you
[2:21:12.400 --> 2:21:18.240]  will not be able to vote for yourself well I grew up in this district I grew
[2:21:18.240 --> 2:21:21.880]  up in this community it's my home my family is still there I'm a mile and a
[2:21:21.880 --> 2:21:26.320]  half down the street to support Alicia while she finishes medical school it's
[2:21:26.320 --> 2:21:29.280]  something I've been very transparent about in fact I'm proud to be supporting
[2:21:29.280 --> 2:21:33.360]  her career and as soon as she finishes her medical training I'll be 10 minutes
[2:21:33.360 --> 2:21:37.120]  back up the road into the district where I grew up all right John Ossoff we will be
[2:21:37.120 --> 2:21:41.720]  watching very closely what happens all about supporting his girlfriend I
[2:21:41.720 --> 2:21:47.280]  guess the question is who's supporting who it's just a job it seems to me like
[2:21:47.280 --> 2:21:50.040]  if he's supporting his girlfriend she would be moving 10 minutes down the road
[2:21:50.040 --> 2:21:53.880]  to live with him in the congressional district that he's running for but it's
[2:21:53.880 --> 2:21:57.000]  also kind of strange isn't it because we have the Democrats who are always
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:00.880]  saying that even illegal immigrants ought to have the vote I mean people who
[2:22:00.880 --> 2:22:04.160]  aren't citizens of the US so you know why should that be a problem for
[2:22:04.160 --> 2:22:08.320]  Democrats that he doesn't live in his district yeah he's the true outsider
[2:22:08.320 --> 2:22:13.280]  candidate and so we got Hollywood moving there in large numbers as Karen
[2:22:13.280 --> 2:22:18.120]  Handel who is the leading GOP candidate she says Hollywood is all in on electing
[2:22:18.120 --> 2:22:21.200]  this guy she said the Democrats have liberal media and Hollywood celebrities
[2:22:21.200 --> 2:22:24.320]  to sing their praises we have something better you they're trying to get the vote
[2:22:24.320 --> 2:22:28.200]  out in this particular situation but also I think it's kind of interesting as
[2:22:28.200 --> 2:22:33.040]  Hollywood moves in on this one of the attacks coming up to this guy and you
[2:22:33.040 --> 2:22:38.440]  saw how he looks kind of kind of geeky they went back to his college days and
[2:22:38.440 --> 2:22:43.960]  they found a video of him dressed up like Han Solo from Star Wars doing a
[2:22:43.960 --> 2:22:47.560]  spoof film and they're playing that and so there they have in this New Yorker
[2:22:47.560 --> 2:22:53.200]  magazine they say he's trying to vanquish 17 candidates at once and he's
[2:22:53.200 --> 2:22:57.520]  playing lightsabers on the campaign trail they can't get any geekier than
[2:22:57.520 --> 2:23:00.840]  that you know I think he needs to go back maybe he's too young to remember
[2:23:00.840 --> 2:23:08.840]  Dukakis remember when Dukakis put on that stupid helmet and rode around in
[2:23:08.840 --> 2:23:13.840]  the in the tank when he was running against George HW Bush it was all over
[2:23:13.840 --> 2:23:18.400]  for him and maybe he ought to rethink the idea of going down the street playing
[2:23:18.400 --> 2:23:23.320]  lightsabers with people that doesn't really help his gravitas too much they
[2:23:23.320 --> 2:23:29.320]  point out that he is they don't think that he's gonna get past the 50% line
[2:23:29.320 --> 2:23:34.560]  he's gonna be running against a Republican her name is Handel they say
[2:23:34.560 --> 2:23:40.480]  that they put her support at between 17 and 21% and this is in a field where
[2:23:40.480 --> 2:23:46.280]  they've got yeah there is the Han Solo picture of him this is in a field of
[2:23:46.280 --> 2:23:50.840]  some point out 17 or 18 candidates it's also interesting because this has been
[2:23:50.840 --> 2:23:57.080]  a Republican district since 1979 this is Newt Gingrich's former district now I
[2:23:57.080 --> 2:24:01.120]  got a little bit close for Trump Trump only one by one point Mitt Romney four
[2:24:01.120 --> 2:24:05.840]  years prior had won that district by 23 points and again they're trying to make
[2:24:05.840 --> 2:24:11.760]  this a referendum this is the Democrats believe their chance to strike back
[2:24:11.760 --> 2:24:15.320]  against Donald Trump I don't think they're going to do it if they don't get
[2:24:15.320 --> 2:24:19.800]  past the 50% on this initial election the woman who will probably be in the
[2:24:19.800 --> 2:24:25.520]  runoff with him is the author of a book it's called Plan Bully Hood and it was
[2:24:25.520 --> 2:24:30.160]  about her time at breast cancer charity Susan G. Coman for the cure and the
[2:24:30.160 --> 2:24:34.520]  organization's relationship to Planned Parenthood she's talking about reducing
[2:24:34.520 --> 2:24:39.600]  corporate taxes and repealing Obamacare. Ossoff is taking the position that he
[2:24:39.600 --> 2:24:44.360]  would just improve Obamacare maybe he could work with Trump on that because
[2:24:44.360 --> 2:24:49.080]  we're seeing that Trump and Paul Ryan and these other people they seem to be
[2:24:49.080 --> 2:24:53.240]  taking Obamacare repeal off the table and I tell you what if you take that
[2:24:53.240 --> 2:24:57.680]  position we're done we're really done you go back and look at the income tax I
[2:24:57.680 --> 2:25:00.480]  talked about that earlier you know hundred thousand dollars standard
[2:25:00.480 --> 2:25:04.400]  deduction when it first started in today's dollars and now we're down to
[2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:08.720]  twelve thousand whenever they start out these programs are very very small but
[2:25:08.720 --> 2:25:14.280]  we saw with Obamacare it immediately immediately skyrocketed insurance rates
[2:25:14.280 --> 2:25:19.360]  and if they allow this thing to put roots down into our system it's going to
[2:25:19.360 --> 2:25:22.360]  become something like social security as a matter of fact I think a lot of the
[2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:26.320]  Republicans already see it as a third rail that they can't touch and one of
[2:25:26.320 --> 2:25:31.600]  the reasons they see that is because the Democrats have very craftily set the
[2:25:31.600 --> 2:25:38.000]  metric as a number of people insured not the cost so we look at the number of
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:41.760]  people insured and Donald Trump has kind of stepped in this as well when he
[2:25:41.760 --> 2:25:45.680]  started out he said we're going to have everybody with great insurance you can
[2:25:45.680 --> 2:25:52.400]  either have affordable health care or you can have universal health care and
[2:25:52.400 --> 2:25:55.360]  I'm quite frankly I would say if you have universal health care it's going to go
[2:25:55.360 --> 2:25:58.760]  the way of Venezuela you're not even going to have health care most people
[2:25:58.760 --> 2:26:01.920]  aren't going to have it the few people in Washington yeah they'll have health
[2:26:01.920 --> 2:26:05.120]  care they'll always have a Cadillac health care system but if you go for
[2:26:05.120 --> 2:26:09.960]  universal health care you are falling into the trap of socialism if you allow
[2:26:09.960 --> 2:26:14.320]  them to define this thing as the number of people who have coverage we've lost
[2:26:14.320 --> 2:26:18.040]  they've defined the terms of debate and the terms of debate then will be how
[2:26:18.040 --> 2:26:21.040]  many people have coverage not whether or not it's affordable remember it was
[2:26:21.040 --> 2:26:25.280]  going to be the Affordable Health Care Act Paul Ryan changed that he called it
[2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:29.400]  the American Health Care Act they know it's not going to be affordable not if
[2:26:29.400 --> 2:26:34.000]  you have mandates if you have mandates you're not going to have markets you
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:40.040]  need to have choice and competition not coercion that's why it has to be
[2:26:40.040 --> 2:26:44.160]  repealed if you leave the framework there and you do what this Democrat
[2:26:44.160 --> 2:26:51.400]  wants to do he wants to help to improve it we put some lipstick on it or as John
[2:26:51.400 --> 2:26:54.560]  Cleese likes to put it instead of lipstick on a pig I like it better he
[2:26:54.560 --> 2:27:01.200]  says mascara on quasi-modo I think that's a better image actually or a to
[2:27:01.200 --> 2:27:05.400]  pay on the elephant man that was another one from Cleese that's really what
[2:27:05.400 --> 2:27:09.880]  we're talking about here now we need to get rid of it you can't allow that
[2:27:09.880 --> 2:27:15.600]  infrastructure to be there and phase two of the plan that Paul Ryan pulled on
[2:27:15.600 --> 2:27:19.560]  Trump was to say that we're going to use Tom Price the guy that they're now
[2:27:19.560 --> 2:27:22.920]  replacing here in this Georgia district they're going to use the health and
[2:27:22.920 --> 2:27:29.120]  human services czar to dictate changes that are going to make it more palatable
[2:27:29.120 --> 2:27:33.600]  so we shouldn't have a health czar who is dictating stuff to us we want to have
[2:27:33.600 --> 2:27:36.280]  affordable health care we're going to have to have a market we're going to have
[2:27:36.280 --> 2:27:40.160]  to have choice we're going to have to have information and competition that was
[2:27:40.160 --> 2:27:46.200]  the plan that Donald Trump ran on do what you ran on fulfill your promises
[2:27:46.200 --> 2:27:51.880]  that's what the people want that is a winning proposition people have voted
[2:27:51.880 --> 2:27:56.240]  time and again for Republicans to repeal Obamacare as a matter of fact the
[2:27:56.240 --> 2:28:01.920]  front running Republican is running on a platform now of repealing Obamacare
[2:28:01.920 --> 2:28:06.360]  you understand that's a winning proposition that's what Republican voters want
[2:28:06.360 --> 2:28:10.480]  that's what the people want do what the people want do what we sent you
[2:28:10.480 --> 2:28:15.400]  there for Paul Ryan is not going to do that Paul Ryan has always been part of
[2:28:15.400 --> 2:28:20.560]  the establishment that was going to shut that thing down and so it's going to be
[2:28:20.560 --> 2:28:24.200]  interesting to see how this how this works out there's also some other
[2:28:24.200 --> 2:28:28.240]  election news we have Theresa May as I pointed out earlier in the program she
[2:28:28.240 --> 2:28:31.680]  has on the spur of the moment decided that she's going to call an election in
[2:28:31.680 --> 2:28:36.040]  June let's play that clip where she explains why she's calling a general
[2:28:36.040 --> 2:28:41.960]  election at this moment of enormous national significance there should be
[2:28:41.960 --> 2:28:49.160]  unity here in Westminster but instead there is division the country is coming
[2:28:49.160 --> 2:28:55.320]  together but Westminster is not if we do not hold a general election now their
[2:28:55.320 --> 2:29:00.560]  political game playing will continue and the negotiations with the European
[2:29:00.560 --> 2:29:04.800]  Union will reach their most difficult stage in the run-up to the next
[2:29:04.800 --> 2:29:10.800]  scheduled election so I have a simple challenge to the opposition parties you
[2:29:10.800 --> 2:29:14.600]  have criticised the government's vision for Brexit you have challenged our
[2:29:14.600 --> 2:29:18.800]  objectives you have threatened to block the legislation we put before
[2:29:18.800 --> 2:29:24.880]  Parliament this is your moment to show you mean it to show you are not opposing
[2:29:24.880 --> 2:29:29.280]  the government for the sake of it to show that you do not treat politics as
[2:29:29.280 --> 2:29:34.400]  a game those kind of interesting the headline on the drudge report was May
[2:29:34.400 --> 2:29:39.720]  and June Prime Minister May is calling the elections in June this is really
[2:29:39.720 --> 2:29:44.880]  Brexit Part 2 this is really a referendum on moving forward with Brexit with
[2:29:44.880 --> 2:29:49.920]  giving her a consensus to move forward with that and as a CNN points out the
[2:29:49.920 --> 2:29:53.160]  European Union brushed off her announcement said that it would not
[2:29:53.160 --> 2:29:57.280]  affect their negotiations on Britain's departure but they say that May's
[2:29:57.280 --> 2:30:02.320]  decision means that Europe's three most powerful nations France Germany and
[2:30:02.320 --> 2:30:06.920]  Britain will be convulsed by internal election campaigns as the clock ticks
[2:30:06.920 --> 2:30:11.640]  on the two-year deadline to complete Brexit negotiations as we're running up
[2:30:11.640 --> 2:30:15.280]  to this we see with the French elections coming up in just a week not only as
[2:30:15.280 --> 2:30:21.000]  Facebook scrambling to take down pro-lipin accounts but we also see some
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:25.000]  terrorists were caught planning a violent imminent attack in Marseille
[2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:29.280]  this is a French Interior Minister pointed this out he said two radicalized
[2:30:29.280 --> 2:30:36.320]  men born in 1987 and 1993 of French nationality intended to commit in the
[2:30:36.320 --> 2:30:40.560]  very short term by that I mean in the coming days an attack on French soil and
[2:30:40.560 --> 2:30:45.760]  I talked about this yesterday on the nightly news this study that came out of
[2:30:45.760 --> 2:30:51.720]  Vienna Austria where a Turkish born Austrian professor did a study looking
[2:30:51.720 --> 2:30:56.480]  at 10,000 children aged two to six who attended Muslim preschools and he talked
[2:30:56.480 --> 2:31:01.840]  about how this radicalized them how it made tended them towards extremism but
[2:31:01.840 --> 2:31:07.320]  also how it shut them off from the society in which they live and I've said
[2:31:07.320 --> 2:31:11.000]  this many times I said the second generation is going to be far more
[2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:14.880]  dangerous in terms of a percentage of those who are radicalized than the first
[2:31:14.880 --> 2:31:19.000]  generation is they don't know where they came from they don't know the problems
[2:31:19.000 --> 2:31:24.120]  in that society but they do know that they have been living in this ghetto of
[2:31:24.120 --> 2:31:28.000]  their parents own making quite frankly because they don't want to participate in
[2:31:28.000 --> 2:31:31.360]  that society they want to wall themselves off they want to remain separate
[2:31:31.360 --> 2:31:35.320]  and as they do that and they see that they're not prospering the second
[2:31:35.320 --> 2:31:39.000]  generation like we see in this situation in France they get very resentful very
[2:31:39.000 --> 2:31:43.480]  angry about that that's why you see so many second generation immigrants doing
[2:31:43.480 --> 2:31:47.320]  this type of thing now we also had the election in Turkey that is now being
[2:31:47.320 --> 2:31:52.080]  disputed over 2.5 million Turkish votes are possibly manipulated say
[2:31:52.080 --> 2:31:55.320]  international observers the interesting thing I think about the
[2:31:55.320 --> 2:31:59.760]  Turkey election is that Erdogan doesn't really care about the EU he doesn't
[2:31:59.760 --> 2:32:04.880]  really care about NATO you know he's calling the EU Nazis why because when
[2:32:04.880 --> 2:32:08.520]  he went there to campaign as the New York Times points out they called it the
[2:32:08.520 --> 2:32:14.240]  diaspora the Turkish diaspora what you're looking at is the takeover of
[2:32:14.240 --> 2:32:21.480]  Europe by Muslims turning it into Arabia and that's why he was there
[2:32:21.480 --> 2:32:24.080]  campaigning because there were so many Turks there I guess they get to vote in
[2:32:24.080 --> 2:32:26.920]  the Turkish election plus they get to vote in the European elections that's
[2:32:26.920 --> 2:32:30.520]  that's great you get to vote and multiple elections there but he doesn't
[2:32:30.520 --> 2:32:34.400]  really care about the EU he's calling them Nazis because they said no we're
[2:32:34.400 --> 2:32:37.840]  not going to let you campaign here he was going interestingly enough you talk
[2:32:37.840 --> 2:32:42.640]  about hypocrisy the guy would wanted to send his ministers to the European Union
[2:32:42.640 --> 2:32:47.480]  to campaign for dictatorial powers that's what this referendum was about and
[2:32:47.480 --> 2:32:53.000]  then he has the audacity to call the Europeans Nazis I mean he's campaigning
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:57.160]  for Nazi powers and he calls them Nazis but he's also not interested in NATO
[2:32:57.160 --> 2:33:03.840]  why because he understands that NATO is an anachronism Donald Trump understood
[2:33:03.840 --> 2:33:09.040]  that until he got this crop of advisors and but clearly he understands that it's
[2:33:09.040 --> 2:33:13.040]  anachronism he doesn't really care if they let him into the European Union so
[2:33:13.040 --> 2:33:17.280]  he's throwing a lot of insults at them because he's going to take over Europe
[2:33:17.280 --> 2:33:23.040]  with the Muslim group as I pointed out this is a good example as we look at
[2:33:23.040 --> 2:33:26.720]  the Turkish influence we look at Fatala Ghulain here in this country and the
[2:33:26.720 --> 2:33:30.960]  charter schools he gets a half a billion dollars worth of taxpayer funds for
[2:33:30.960 --> 2:33:33.920]  charter schools and they're not explicitly religious here like they are
[2:33:33.920 --> 2:33:38.280]  in other countries but he's got about a thousand schools worldwide and he's the
[2:33:38.280 --> 2:33:42.880]  opponent of Erdogan in Turkey the civil war that's going on there it's a good
[2:33:42.880 --> 2:33:47.280]  example of why we should not get involved in these foreign entanglements
[2:33:47.280 --> 2:33:53.240]  because as we see in Turkey there isn't a good guy we've got Erdogan and we got
[2:33:53.240 --> 2:33:58.280]  Glenn and they're both fighting over who's gonna run a Muslim caliphate okay
[2:33:58.280 --> 2:34:04.880]  Ataturk had created a secular Islamic state there but he wants Erdogan is
[2:34:04.880 --> 2:34:10.000]  moving it towards an Islamic state and of course Fatala Ghulain is a Noam he
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:15.200]  wants to move it in a in that direction as well and so you know we had an Ataturk
[2:34:15.200 --> 2:34:19.400]  who was there he was kind of like Assad who defended Christians and religious
[2:34:19.400 --> 2:34:22.880]  freedom but we can't have that we've got to have regime change we should be
[2:34:22.880 --> 2:34:26.200]  careful about that Turkey is a good example of that and it's a country that
[2:34:26.200 --> 2:34:31.440]  we're not at war with and as a matter of fact we have there's a lot of control
[2:34:31.440 --> 2:34:35.240]  and connections of Turks coming into this country I'm we're just talking to
[2:34:35.240 --> 2:34:39.560]  least red hand he spent a good deal of time in Twin Falls Idaho looking at the
[2:34:39.560 --> 2:34:44.040]  Chirbani yogurt situation there and the aftermath of some crimes that were done
[2:34:44.040 --> 2:34:48.360]  by immigrants who were brought in by various food companies there and as he
[2:34:48.360 --> 2:34:54.000]  was doing that report he found that the guy who owns Chirbani yogurt a guy who
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:59.480]  got $700,000 from small business loans they were talking about crony capitalism
[2:34:59.480 --> 2:35:05.000]  here what do you do he used that rather he got $800,000 he used 700,000 of it to
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:11.000]  lobby people like Chuck Schumer and he's now sets on the New York Fed and when
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:17.200]  Lee called and said is he a Turkish citizen still they said no comment so
[2:35:17.200 --> 2:35:21.680]  looks like we got a Turkish citizen sitting on the New York Fed board the
[2:35:21.680 --> 2:35:27.000]  most important policy Fed board that we have now today we had Donald Trump
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:32.240]  signing a buy American high higher American executive order part of this
[2:35:32.240 --> 2:35:37.560]  is to target the H1B visa program and we have about 85,000 foreign workers who
[2:35:37.560 --> 2:35:42.160]  come in the US each year this is the visa program that sometimes brings in
[2:35:42.160 --> 2:35:45.840]  technical people that we can't get abroad but quite often the people who
[2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:49.840]  come in with each H1B visa programs are the people who are brought in by Disney
[2:35:49.840 --> 2:35:54.720]  to replace the American workers so he's putting a stop to that he's putting in a
[2:35:54.720 --> 2:36:00.080]  buy American executive order for agencies to buy domestically stay with
[2:36:00.080 --> 2:36:03.760]  us it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil
[2:36:03.760 --> 2:36:07.960]  water if your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an

[2:40:22.080 --> 2:40:25.480]  us today when they look at the news oh no no no we're not focusing on info wars
[2:40:25.480 --> 2:40:29.280]  per se now we're just going to tell you which sites are trustworthy which ones
[2:40:29.280 --> 2:40:32.920]  have a good reputation which ones don't you can trust CNN but you can't trust
[2:40:32.920 --> 2:40:37.640]  Breitbart or info wars or daily caller or world net daily you know you we're
[2:40:37.640 --> 2:40:41.840]  going to shut those guys down as a site we're not even going to be the arbiters
[2:40:41.840 --> 2:40:45.760]  of truth of individual news stories we're going to shut down the entire site I
[2:40:45.760 --> 2:40:49.640]  was talking just before we went to the break about Trump's executive order to
[2:40:49.640 --> 2:40:53.440]  buy American hire American it will require agencies to consider whether
[2:40:53.440 --> 2:40:57.480]  foreign governments are using unfair trade practices when considering the
[2:40:57.480 --> 2:41:03.920]  lowest responsible bidder well I think that's good but when we look at let's
[2:41:03.920 --> 2:41:07.200]  take a look at the export import bank for example last week we reported that on
[2:41:07.200 --> 2:41:14.080]  in just 24 hours Trump did a complete reversal on five core campaign issues
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:18.440]  things like China's a currency manipulator NATO is now good Janet
[2:41:18.440 --> 2:41:22.360]  Yellen is now good we want the Federal Reserve to weaken our currency rather
[2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:25.480]  than telling China they need to stop manipulating their currency that type of
[2:41:25.480 --> 2:41:29.520]  thing but one of the things that he went to was the export import bank do you
[2:41:29.520 --> 2:41:33.360]  know what that is we haven't really talked about that a lot some of the
[2:41:33.360 --> 2:41:36.040]  senators have talked about this some campaigned on it as part of the
[2:41:36.040 --> 2:41:40.800]  presidential campaign Boeing and General Electric are very very happy that
[2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:44.600]  Donald Trump wants to revive the export bank what happened was back in 2015
[2:41:44.600 --> 2:41:48.120]  there's a great article from Reason magazine at the time they really spelled
[2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:53.520]  it out very simply they said for the first time in 81 years crony capitalist
[2:41:53.520 --> 2:41:57.800]  export import bank loses its authorization what happened was they had two
[2:41:57.800 --> 2:42:02.640]  members on the board get off and the Senate refused to replace them which
[2:42:02.640 --> 2:42:06.800]  basically kept that from operating why would you want to do that well this is
[2:42:06.800 --> 2:42:13.760]  something that goes back to FDR's new deal okay and it is nothing but crony
[2:42:13.760 --> 2:42:19.480]  capitalism here's an example they talk about how Boeing and these are Boeing
[2:42:19.480 --> 2:42:24.280]  thinks it's a great deal that Trump's gonna bring this back Boeing is a
[2:42:24.280 --> 2:42:29.680]  recipient of 40% of what the export import bank has done so 40% of what they
[2:42:29.680 --> 2:42:35.760]  do helps Boeing it's supposed to help small business right not in your life
[2:42:35.760 --> 2:42:41.240]  it is the big business business that's what they're in the business of 60% of
[2:42:41.240 --> 2:42:46.080]  the banks financing aids go to just 10 giant corporations like Caterpillar
[2:42:46.080 --> 2:42:52.120]  Bechtel GE that I pointed out that pays no taxes Jeffrey Malt who was one of
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:42:57.080]  Obama's favorite CEOs they are the ones who benefiting from this and on the
[2:42:57.080 --> 2:43:03.000]  other side so they they extend low and low interest loans subsidized by you the
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:07.320]  taxpayer remember this on April 15 you the taxpayer are putting up a hundred
[2:43:07.320 --> 2:43:11.400]  and forty billion dollars to help these giant corporations do business abroad
[2:43:11.400 --> 2:43:16.680]  who is getting that money well as people like the Mexican government's oil and
[2:43:16.680 --> 2:43:24.120]  gas giant Pemex or the United Arab Emirates airline air Emirates so we're
[2:43:24.120 --> 2:43:29.120]  subsidizing not only foreign corporations but foreign state owned
[2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:34.320]  corporations how is that something that we want to do and when we come back I'm
[2:43:34.320 --> 2:43:37.200]  gonna tell you about the two people that he wants to point to this board you

[2:45:27.840 --> 2:45:33.160]  actually not gonna be joining but he's going to be hosting the fourth hour Owen
[2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:37.960]  Shore will be coming on air in the next segment hosting the fourth hour I was
[2:45:37.960 --> 2:45:41.440]  talking about the export import bank and this is one of the things that Donald
[2:45:41.440 --> 2:45:44.920]  Trump reversed himself on last week he said it was corporate feather bedding
[2:45:44.920 --> 2:45:49.400]  it was crony capitalism when he was running for president but then last week
[2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:54.640]  as the CNBC pointed out he offered an olive branch to Democrats and the
[2:45:54.640 --> 2:45:58.640]  Democrats that are now in his cabinet people like Gary Cohen when he pledged
[2:45:58.640 --> 2:46:02.880]  to support the controversial export import bank last week and they're
[2:46:02.880 --> 2:46:05.560]  looking at this and they're unhappy with the two picks that he had understand
[2:46:05.560 --> 2:46:12.840]  this is an 81-year-old a new deal crony capitalist institution benefiting many
[2:46:12.840 --> 2:46:18.720]  cases foreign owned state owned corporations foreign governments owned
[2:46:18.720 --> 2:46:22.800]  these corporations and we're extending them subsidized loans at the expensive
[2:46:22.800 --> 2:46:28.440]  view the taxpayer for the benefit of 10 giant corporations that's what this is
[2:46:28.440 --> 2:46:32.960]  about folks and it stopped in 2015 because they had two vacancies so they
[2:46:32.960 --> 2:46:35.840]  didn't have a quorum they couldn't do anything now he's going to appoint a
[2:46:35.840 --> 2:46:39.280]  couple of people so one of the people that he's talking about appointing as a
[2:46:39.280 --> 2:46:44.640]  guy who had always opposed it Scott Garrett he was part of the Freedom
[2:46:44.640 --> 2:46:48.520]  Caucus and so CNBC says well we're not happy about this this is another
[2:46:48.520 --> 2:46:53.400]  individual who's getting put on a put into an agency that he thinks shouldn't
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:57.160]  exist well I wish that were the case instead what he says was I think we
[2:46:57.160 --> 2:47:01.760]  can fix it I think we can make it work see that's the bohrmere flaw you remember
[2:47:01.760 --> 2:47:05.160]  Lord of the Rings member bohrmere he says I can take that ring and I can do
[2:47:05.160 --> 2:47:10.360]  something really good with it no you can't it will take you over and we've
[2:47:10.360 --> 2:47:14.520]  seen from the beginning of the federal income tax how this monster has gone you
[2:47:14.520 --> 2:47:18.440]  can see it in every agency the EPA is a good example of it but the other person
[2:47:18.440 --> 2:47:23.240]  that he put in CNBC thought was a great guy Spencer Bacchus they called him a
[2:47:23.240 --> 2:47:26.600]  moderate remember when they liked the person they called them a moderate or
[2:47:26.600 --> 2:47:31.640]  a centrist well let's talk about this guy Spencer Bacchus Breitbart pointed out
[2:47:31.640 --> 2:47:35.600]  where this guy was coming from they said Bacchus is a Republican he holds the
[2:47:35.600 --> 2:47:39.120]  unenviable distinction of being the only politician that Andrew Breitbart called
[2:47:39.120 --> 2:47:43.760]  upon to resign when Andrew Breitbart was alive what did he do well he was
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:49.040]  chairman of the House Financial Services Committee during the 2008 financial
[2:47:49.040 --> 2:47:56.000]  crisis and he was the epitome of insider trading this is a guy I remember in
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:48:02.480]  September 18th 2008 we talked about this many times Hank Paulson calls in the
[2:48:02.480 --> 2:48:07.560]  and the chair of the Fed Ben Bernanke they go to Capitol Hill they call in
[2:48:07.560 --> 2:48:12.240]  all these senior congressmen people like Spencer Bacchus who is the House
[2:48:12.240 --> 2:48:16.000]  Financial Services Committee chair during that time they tell them everything is
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:21.480]  going to collapse unless you do what we tell you to do as a matter of fact in
[2:48:21.480 --> 2:48:25.080]  this situation they said it was a secretive meeting what they did was they
[2:48:25.080 --> 2:48:28.160]  made all the congressmen put their phones away in the corner because they
[2:48:28.160 --> 2:48:31.760]  didn't want anybody recording the conversation or texting anybody about it
[2:48:31.760 --> 2:48:35.360]  according to Paulson and his memoirs he painted an apocalyptic vision of what
[2:48:35.360 --> 2:48:39.240]  was coming down the pike he said look the stock market could lose half of its
[2:48:39.240 --> 2:48:43.880]  valuation we could have a massive failure of banks etc that was on
[2:48:43.880 --> 2:48:49.600]  September 18th the morning of September 19th Spencer Bacchus knew what was
[2:48:49.600 --> 2:48:55.120]  coming and he went to the stock market he took out $50,000 worth of what would
[2:48:55.120 --> 2:49:00.520]  typically be a very risky move he shorted the market most of the time when
[2:49:00.520 --> 2:49:04.840]  you do that type of thing most of the option players lose money but he took
[2:49:04.840 --> 2:49:11.560]  out $50,000 unassured deal because he had insider information and so he made a
[2:49:11.560 --> 2:49:16.720]  fortune out of this this is the guy that Donald Trump's administration and I'm
[2:49:16.720 --> 2:49:20.600]  not necessarily blaming it on Trump but the buck does stop with him maybe Gary
[2:49:20.600 --> 2:49:25.520]  Cohen putting this guy forward I don't know Jared Kushner this crook this
[2:49:25.520 --> 2:49:28.600]  crook who should have stepped down he should have been in jail but of course
[2:49:28.600 --> 2:49:33.120]  remember Nancy Pelosi and all that lot said oh no insider trading that's legal
[2:49:33.120 --> 2:49:37.440]  for Congress to do as long as people are looking they pass the stock act so
[2:49:37.440 --> 2:49:40.920]  we're gonna stop it you notice that we're doing insider trading you got
[2:49:40.920 --> 2:49:44.280]  pretty upset about it so we're gonna stop it a few months later when nobody
[2:49:44.280 --> 2:49:48.240]  was looking they undid it and now one of the worst examples of this is being
[2:49:48.240 --> 2:49:53.440]  appointed to this crony capitalist export import bank what's going on here I
[2:49:53.440 --> 2:49:57.520]  don't know stay with us oh a shorter is gonna be hosting the fourth hour he'll
[2:49:57.520 --> 2:50:03.000]  be right back according to the mainstream media President Donald Trump was
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:08.760]  mean to kids on Easter Sunday that's right dozens of news outlets ran with a
[2:50:08.760 --> 2:50:13.440]  misleading video that was spread by Politico yesterday claiming that
[2:50:13.440 --> 2:50:18.080]  President Trump signed a kids make America great again at and then threw it
[2:50:18.080 --> 2:50:22.800]  away from the kid into the crowd the video quickly went viral racking up
[2:50:22.800 --> 2:50:27.480]  nearly 10,000 retweets and getting picked up by other news outlets the
[2:50:27.480 --> 2:50:32.560]  Washington Post reported Trump using a thick sharpie put his signature on the
[2:50:32.560 --> 2:50:37.600]  bill of the cap then looked up and lopped it into the crowd nowhere near the
[2:50:37.600 --> 2:50:41.760]  hand that had given it to him and BuzzFeed even claimed that the poor kid
[2:50:41.760 --> 2:50:46.760]  never got his hat back but in reality other camera angles clearly show the
[2:50:46.760 --> 2:50:51.080]  president and the kid were just having fun and the boy indeed caught his hat
[2:50:51.080 --> 2:50:55.880]  signed by the president of the United States you can see the videos for

[2:53:27.080 --> 2:53:31.880]  sitting it feels like more people are nervous about World War three than ever
[2:53:31.880 --> 2:53:37.880]  before even when Barack Obama was in office now you can throw blame around
[2:53:37.880 --> 2:53:41.240]  and say who's guilty of what or this that your other thing but it doesn't really
[2:53:41.240 --> 2:53:45.680]  matter does it if we go to World War three no I don't think that's good for
[2:53:45.680 --> 2:53:52.280]  anyone and I'd like to know what you out there think about this because part of
[2:53:52.280 --> 2:53:57.680]  me wants to start to be more critical of President Trump and then another part of
[2:53:57.680 --> 2:54:01.680]  me says that's what the mainstream media wants that's what the Democrats want
[2:54:01.680 --> 2:54:05.880]  that's what the globalist want and we know that they're all three working in
[2:54:05.880 --> 2:54:09.920]  collusion to try to bring down President Trump and try to stop our movement so
[2:54:09.920 --> 2:54:15.440]  it's a real it's a real it's some real thin ice that we're on right now as far
[2:54:15.440 --> 2:54:20.080]  as whether we should be supporting Trump gung-ho or whether we need to be
[2:54:20.080 --> 2:54:23.680]  looking at Trump and saying it's not looking good the directions he's going
[2:54:23.680 --> 2:54:28.400]  in or is there a line there between both that I guess would be the most real
[2:54:28.400 --> 2:54:33.640]  thing that so I want to I want to hear what you out there think 1-800-259-9231
[2:54:33.640 --> 2:54:43.080]  is this the most you've ever been worried about World War three do you think
[2:54:43.080 --> 2:54:46.480]  it's a distraction from something else entirely are we missing the boat on
[2:54:46.480 --> 2:54:50.920]  something else entirely we know how they love to do that to try to distract us
[2:54:50.920 --> 2:54:55.600]  but some of the developments today I'm sure you've heard the US has deployed
[2:54:55.600 --> 2:55:01.720]  two more aircraft carriers towards the Korean Peninsula and then at the same
[2:55:01.720 --> 2:55:06.160]  time the same story was breaking US military considers shooting down North
[2:55:06.160 --> 2:55:10.680]  Korea missile tests okay so you've got more aircraft carriers moving in that
[2:55:10.680 --> 2:55:14.520]  direction you've got stories breaking about how the US is considering
[2:55:14.520 --> 2:55:17.840]  shooting down North Korea missiles North Korea saying they're going to test
[2:55:17.840 --> 2:55:23.760]  missiles every week now the US is drawing a line with North Korea it appears
[2:55:23.760 --> 2:55:28.160]  and they're not joking around so I mean these are serious developments and all
[2:55:28.160 --> 2:55:32.720]  signs point to something serious about to happen I mean they don't just send all
[2:55:32.720 --> 2:55:36.840]  these naval vessels and do all this saber-rattling if they don't plan on
[2:55:36.840 --> 2:55:42.960]  doing anything at all and maybe China has balked that's what a lot of people are
[2:55:42.960 --> 2:55:47.600]  saying that China has kind of balked and they've blinked first but North Korea
[2:55:47.600 --> 2:55:52.800]  has not and I would assume now I don't know if Donald Trump talks to anybody
[2:55:52.800 --> 2:56:01.880]  from Kim Jong-un's center of power I would imagine that somebody from China
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:06.600]  is talking to those people and that's why they had to turn that coal shipment
[2:56:06.600 --> 2:56:10.080]  around but these are serious developments and Trump has obviously
[2:56:10.080 --> 2:56:16.760]  pivoted on his China rigging their currency rhetoric perhaps that was part
[2:56:16.760 --> 2:56:23.120]  of his quote-unquote 5d 6 triple d chess that he plays in order to win in Korea
[2:56:23.120 --> 2:56:28.120]  but even with North Korea now my grandfather fought in the Korean War I
[2:56:28.120 --> 2:56:33.120]  personally think that Trump is going for victory in North Korea to win major
[2:56:33.120 --> 2:56:40.560]  popularity points and just cruise towards victory in 2020 but I'd like to
[2:56:40.560 --> 2:56:45.760]  know what people out there think now Roger Stone will be joining us at 2 30
[2:56:45.760 --> 2:56:51.320]  233 to be exact in the show today I'm sure he's got some breaking
[2:56:51.320 --> 2:56:54.640]  developments because he's actually going to be in studio with me so we'll be
[2:56:54.640 --> 2:56:59.160]  hearing from Roger Stone shortly but I'd like to hear from people out in the
[2:56:59.160 --> 2:57:02.840]  audience today what do you think right now about World War three what do you
[2:57:02.840 --> 2:57:08.880]  think right now about Trump and do we continue to support him no matter what
[2:57:08.880 --> 2:57:13.080]  because the media the Democrats in the globalist working collusion want us
[2:57:13.080 --> 2:57:17.400]  divided more than anything or do we have to call it as we see it and in some
[2:57:17.400 --> 2:57:20.480]  instances support Trump and if we see an instance which we don't want to support
[2:57:20.480 --> 2:57:24.760]  Trump call him out on it I don't know it's a very difficult path that we walk
[2:57:24.760 --> 2:57:29.160]  down right now so let's go to some of our audience let's start with Uncle Sam
[2:57:29.160 --> 2:57:35.720]  in Louisiana who wants to talk about Trump's turnaround go ahead Uncle Sam
[2:57:35.720 --> 2:57:43.000]  yes good day I do street interviews in the streets in New Orleans okay dress up
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:47.160]  in an uncle Sam outfit and for the past week I've been asking people about Syria
[2:57:47.160 --> 2:57:50.960]  you know I think I've actually seen you before sorry for interrupting go ahead
[2:57:50.960 --> 2:57:57.280]  no I've been on the show you get Daniels did a profile okay okay yeah you guys
[2:57:57.280 --> 2:58:00.960]  have actually been from some of the interviews because I talked I've talked
[2:58:00.960 --> 2:58:04.800]  to colonels and car girls out there in the streets and some of the things I
[2:58:04.800 --> 2:58:09.840]  heard recently I just spoke to a man who followed around he was the first
[2:58:09.840 --> 2:58:14.960]  communicate for president Clinton he heard every conversation for three years
[2:58:14.960 --> 2:58:19.360]  the things he told me I can't really so let's get into what you think about
[2:58:19.360 --> 2:58:25.320]  Trump though yeah this is what the I mean my analogy is this it's sort of like
[2:58:25.320 --> 2:58:29.080]  you have a wife that's beautiful she keeps a house good she takes care of the
[2:58:29.080 --> 2:58:35.520]  kids pays the bills is a great cook but she's sleeping with your worst enemy hmm
[2:58:35.520 --> 2:58:42.160]  what do you do yeah I mean it's it's it we're looking at this he's he's
[2:58:42.160 --> 2:58:47.760]  obviously but I mean he was serious just got me twisted but you know it I know
[2:58:47.760 --> 2:58:51.240]  it all the info was no with the people listening know it but you know just to
[2:58:51.240 --> 2:58:53.960]  add something to that it's like he's sleeping with the enemy while they're
[2:58:53.960 --> 2:58:58.960]  both stabbing each other in the back constantly and this is the weirdest thing
[2:58:58.960 --> 2:59:06.000]  I mean I don't know go ahead yeah but I don't mean I know the people that I've
[2:59:06.000 --> 2:59:10.640]  been speaking to on the streets they're puzzled I mean no one can put a real
[2:59:10.640 --> 2:59:15.960]  finger on this it's it's so fluid it's like all the pieces are falling apart in
[2:59:15.960 --> 2:59:19.600]  every different direction you can't you can't keep track of any of it and you
[2:59:19.600 --> 2:59:24.040]  know what I think that the biggest problem that we all have and I'm speaking
[2:59:24.040 --> 2:59:28.560]  for myself I suppose but it just feels like right now you know my biggest thing
[2:59:28.560 --> 2:59:32.000]  was drain the swamp right drain the swamp get in there like a wrecking ball and
[2:59:32.000 --> 2:59:38.360]  he's been great for domestic policy but drain the swamp hmm I'm not sure if I'm
[2:59:38.360 --> 2:59:44.400]  buying that yeah I mean we got you wanted a wrecking ball we got a bowling
[2:59:44.400 --> 2:59:48.400]  ball yeah I think that that's another good analogy alright uncle Sam thank you
[2:59:48.400 --> 2:59:52.800]  so much for the call let's move on to Russell who is in Texas also wants to
[2:59:52.800 --> 2:59:58.040]  talk Trump go ahead Russell hey it's a real honor to speak with you I'd listen
[2:59:58.040 --> 3:00:04.880]  all day every day so thank you there I just wanted to say that Trump when he
[3:00:04.880 --> 3:00:10.240]  was running now he's a good man got a good heart you know he he did he's not a
[3:00:10.240 --> 3:00:15.600]  politician he didn't get into is now he wanted money well he is now but that
[3:00:15.600 --> 3:00:20.360]  wasn't his motivation he just loves our country so with that being said once he
[3:00:20.360 --> 3:00:25.920]  got in he now sees the dynamics like the world stage how the powers work
[3:00:25.920 --> 3:00:30.560]  together you know he can't just do things on his own I understand with the
[3:00:30.560 --> 3:00:36.600]  world government but he has to play the game as it is now he has a good heart
[3:00:36.600 --> 3:00:41.000]  and he's gonna do what's best for us but some avenues have to be gone through a
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:46.040]  certain way see I hear what you're saying and I hear this a lot and there's
[3:00:46.040 --> 3:00:50.640]  certainly some potentiality in what you're talking about it's just I have a
[3:00:50.640 --> 3:00:56.720]  problem I don't want to be like the Obama supporters that just looked like
[3:00:56.720 --> 3:01:01.280]  the biggest dumbasses for eight years I guess is how I'm putting it I don't
[3:01:01.280 --> 3:01:04.360]  want to be the person that just continues to fall hook line and sinker for
[3:01:04.360 --> 3:01:07.840]  whatever Trump says because I believe in some overarching agenda that I think we
[3:01:07.840 --> 3:01:12.960]  agree on I'm just not seeing that right now that's just how I feel and a lot of
[3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:16.360]  people feel the same way other people think this is divide that people are
[3:01:16.360 --> 3:01:20.120]  trying to divide us right now and I don't know there's a lot of things that
[3:01:20.120 --> 3:01:22.120]  Trump's doing that's good there's a lot of things that Trump and his
[3:01:22.120 --> 3:01:27.000]  administration that have done that are not good what do you think Russell the
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:31.640]  way that conservatives and libertarians think they think on a whole
[3:01:31.640 --> 3:01:36.880]  another level than liberals do the liberals are watching TV getting their
[3:01:36.880 --> 3:01:43.040]  news believing headlines and topics we actually listen to the facts listen to
[3:01:43.040 --> 3:01:47.560]  the sources and Trump's no different than that so all I'm saying is yes he's a
[3:01:47.560 --> 3:01:52.760]  regular person he can make mistakes but he doesn't have an agenda to sell us out
[3:01:52.760 --> 3:01:59.040]  he already had he took a lot of trouble and heat and and you know that turn his
[3:01:59.040 --> 3:02:06.280]  life upside down to well I will say this I will say this if the United States
[3:02:06.280 --> 3:02:10.680]  ends up in more Middle Eastern intervention because of an oil pipeline
[3:02:10.680 --> 3:02:17.000]  that to me is selling the American people out absolutely 110% because you
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:20.900]  know why because you know what happens then we then go into the Middle East we
[3:02:20.900 --> 3:02:23.840]  intervene in the Middle East we bomb the Middle East into oblivion and then
[3:02:23.840 --> 3:02:27.200]  those people end up hating us and then you have ISIS with the help of our own
[3:02:27.200 --> 3:02:31.400]  government in proxy wars as well so it's a very vicious circle that we were
[3:02:31.400 --> 3:02:35.320]  hoping Trump would put a stop to we would hope Trump would get in there and
[3:02:35.320 --> 3:02:40.360]  stop those gears up and whether it be because he's getting bad intel whether
[3:02:40.360 --> 3:02:44.720]  it be because he has no choice maybe he's blackmailed I don't know but the
[3:02:44.720 --> 3:02:48.640]  gears just keep on rolling and he was the candidate that said he didn't want to
[3:02:48.640 --> 3:02:51.880]  get into World War three now here we are basically playing World War chicken
[3:02:51.880 --> 3:02:57.560]  with with North Korea and China and the Middle East you said that earlier that
[3:02:57.560 --> 3:03:01.440]  he might not have a choice I mean if you were to be in the White House yourself
[3:03:01.440 --> 3:03:06.360]  common sense is going to rule most of what you do not corruption because you're
[3:03:06.360 --> 3:03:11.040]  paid off but he's having to face off real threats and he might have
[3:03:11.040 --> 3:03:15.240]  information saying look these guys are just going to pop a shot off at us or
[3:03:15.240 --> 3:03:20.160]  whatever you know he's he's got to defend us he's got to do what he's got to do I
[3:03:20.160 --> 3:03:25.080]  hope it doesn't happen and I'm sure if he has to say in it it ain't going to
[3:03:25.080 --> 3:03:30.000]  happen I would not think that it's because he just wants to be tough or
[3:03:30.000 --> 3:03:33.880]  or what's that we have to ask thank you for the call Russell we have to ask what
[3:03:33.880 --> 3:03:37.160]  is the big deal with North Korea now why all the saber rattling with North Korea
[3:03:37.160 --> 3:03:42.360]  what is driving this is it Trump going for victory in North Korea or is it the
[3:03:42.360 --> 3:03:47.000]  globalist stirring up this distraction or stirring up Trump to force
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:51.600]  intervention to force World War three to divide Trump's base I don't know what's
[3:03:51.600 --> 3:03:54.920]  going on again you just have to ask why I don't know I'm not gonna get I'm not
[3:03:54.920 --> 3:03:59.440]  gonna find this out they're not gonna tell us let's go to Fred in Wisconsin who
[3:03:59.440 --> 3:04:02.880]  wants to talk about World War three go ahead Fred you've got 60 seconds make it
[3:04:02.880 --> 3:04:08.040]  quick hey I think the problem here is that South Korea is trying to install
[3:04:08.040 --> 3:04:12.240]  the fad system which is a major radar which is going to piss off both Russia
[3:04:12.240 --> 3:04:18.600]  and and China and now back in May of 2014 we had the Donald Cook attacked with an
[3:04:18.600 --> 3:04:23.840]  EMP weapon which completely disabled it 27 soldiers you know resigned I think the
[3:04:23.840 --> 3:04:28.400]  major person to watch are the major country to watch for is Russia I think
[3:04:28.400 --> 3:04:33.000]  North Korea and Syria is all just a big distraction I'll put it to you this way I'll put it to you
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:37.240]  this way I'll put it to you this way I think that Russia is the biggest story
[3:04:37.240 --> 3:04:39.440]  or the biggest everywhere because I don't think Russia is gonna take the
[3:04:39.440 --> 3:04:43.400]  United States BS anymore I think Russia will finally stand up to United States
[3:04:43.400 --> 3:04:47.120]  government forcing oil wars on the rest of the world that's I don't know that
[3:04:47.120 --> 3:04:59.840]  could be the case will be right back on the other side Alex Jones 4th hour what

[3:07:02.160 --> 3:07:06.640]  of David versus Goliath in the early 1980s a child was born two of them
[3:07:06.640 --> 3:07:11.320]  actually their names were Jeff and Andy time went by they developed facial hair
[3:07:11.320 --> 3:07:16.320]  and one day something happened Andy got ripped off buying overpriced razors so
[3:07:16.320 --> 3:07:19.720]  they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all
[3:07:19.720 --> 3:07:24.080]  they hired the best designers they bought a 95 year old German blade factory
[3:07:24.080 --> 3:07:28.040]  and they started selling high quality razors online with no upcharging direct
[3:07:28.040 --> 3:07:32.320]  to customers how did the overpriced razor company respond by threatening to sue

[3:09:22.800 --> 3:09:26.120]  about I hope you guys didn't play that on purpose because that's how you feel
[3:09:26.120 --> 3:09:31.320]  about Trump I just got handed this story from Fox news dot com North Korean
[3:09:31.320 --> 3:09:37.520]  commandos ready to kidnap Americans says defector it goes on and says that Kim
[3:09:37.520 --> 3:09:41.280]  Jong-un has admitted to kidnapping Japanese people on and on about how bad
[3:09:41.280 --> 3:09:46.240]  Kim Jong-un is so I guess I'm supposed to buy this then and agree to World War
[3:09:46.240 --> 3:09:49.920]  three then I guess that that's how that's going to work that seems to be the
[3:09:49.920 --> 3:09:56.480]  trend look folks Kim Jong-un is obviously a crazy dictator and if we're gonna
[3:09:56.480 --> 3:10:00.920]  virtue signal and play police of the world you would think that North Korea
[3:10:00.920 --> 3:10:04.440]  would have been the main focal point well you know there's no really political
[3:10:04.440 --> 3:10:08.520]  leverage to be gained there there's no economic leverage there's no oil so we've
[3:10:08.520 --> 3:10:12.160]  just kind of remained disinterested now Trump is all the sudden in office and
[3:10:12.160 --> 3:10:15.000]  now all the sudden we want to do something about North Korea of course the
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:18.840]  North Korea South Korea and the United States being involved in those wars
[3:10:18.840 --> 3:10:25.080]  never really ended did it so what is really driving this what is truly driving
[3:10:25.080 --> 3:10:31.800]  this I mean I guess the United States essentially trying to bully Kim Jong-un
[3:10:31.800 --> 3:10:36.120]  out of power I guess that's what they're trying to do and then maybe make a deal
[3:10:36.120 --> 3:10:40.440]  with China so that they can get them to cooperate I don't know I don't want
[3:10:40.440 --> 3:10:45.520]  World War 3 I certainly don't want Kim Jong-un remaining a dictator in Korea
[3:10:45.520 --> 3:10:49.800]  anymore and North Korea anymore but yeah so there's the story North Korea has
[3:10:49.800 --> 3:10:54.560]  been kidnapping people for literally decades for various reasons okay yeah
[3:10:54.560 --> 3:11:00.320]  and what about our government that does the same crap I'm sorry it's just it's
[3:11:00.320 --> 3:11:03.680]  just it's just so hard to sit here and cover all this when I know my government
[3:11:03.680 --> 3:11:06.360]  has been one of the most corrupt governments in the world for my entire
[3:11:06.360 --> 3:11:11.600]  life and just because Trump gets in doesn't mean I'm supposed to forget about it
[3:11:11.600 --> 3:11:17.400]  please actually drain the swamp Trump excuse me let's go to Burger in California
[3:11:17.400 --> 3:11:20.520]  who wants to talk about World War 3 Trump said he didn't want to get us there
[3:11:20.520 --> 3:11:25.360]  go ahead Burger all right Shroya this is it man y'all doing a good job at it for
[3:11:25.360 --> 3:11:29.480]  wars but this is the whole plan man we have been invaded by the British Empire
[3:11:29.480 --> 3:11:34.600]  and what they are doing is they want the military stress so thin and they want
[3:11:34.600 --> 3:11:38.440]  to die in this war this is what's going to happen you've got three aircraft
[3:11:38.440 --> 3:11:42.800]  carriers over there in the sea right now if that happens it's gonna be
[3:11:42.800 --> 3:11:47.760]  devastating we got troops trapped over there in Middle East okay this is what
[3:11:47.760 --> 3:11:52.440]  it is it's a white man war this is what happens it's the invasion of the British
[3:11:52.440 --> 3:11:56.080]  Empire plain and simple if you look at what a country was created it's gonna
[3:11:56.080 --> 3:12:01.000]  take plain and simple we are facing these same things with the TSA the false
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:06.640]  flag is not a living everything this is what it is we have been invaded all right
[3:12:06.640 --> 3:12:09.880]  thank you for the call burger yeah I don't I haven't heard that theory before
[3:12:09.880 --> 3:12:15.000]  that's certainly a new one let's go to Michael in New Jersey also let's talk
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:20.280]  about war go ahead Michael Syria for just a second because I want to be with
[3:12:20.280 --> 3:12:26.480]  you on Korea what if you've got a president or you you've now you now
[3:12:26.480 --> 3:12:31.680]  know that sarin is a blister agent but I don't know that you might have known
[3:12:31.680 --> 3:12:37.880]  that six months ago or a year ago or maybe you do but why do we expect that a
[3:12:37.880 --> 3:12:43.160]  businessman from New York City would know that sarin's a blister agent so
[3:12:43.160 --> 3:12:48.320]  you're only I knew it the people you hire okay so you knew it but does that
[3:12:48.320 --> 3:12:53.360]  mean that Donald Trump knew it he only knows if he hires generals and see I
[3:12:53.360 --> 3:12:56.640]  know here's the deal just to clear the air on this with the whole Syria thing I
[3:12:56.640 --> 3:13:00.040]  don't think I think Trump knew it of course he knew it his generals knew it
[3:13:00.040 --> 3:13:04.800]  they lied about it for an agenda whether that agenda was to remove Assad from
[3:13:04.800 --> 3:13:09.280]  power or whether to test missiles before they go to war in North Korea I don't
[3:13:09.280 --> 3:13:13.200]  know that's the debate now go on to you said you had another point go ahead
[3:13:13.200 --> 3:13:19.480]  ria the Korean issue we live under martial law at some level I would think
[3:13:19.480 --> 3:13:26.680]  that IU info wars and others would be thrilled to figure out the resolution so
[3:13:26.680 --> 3:13:31.320]  we can stop flying the elitrim flags in every public building and every school
[3:13:31.320 --> 3:13:36.320]  in America doesn't matter how many times I sit down with my congressman low
[3:13:36.320 --> 3:13:43.680]  beyond though who's on the house armed services committee and the the committee
[3:13:43.680 --> 3:13:48.520]  that oversees the NSA I can talk till I'm blue in the face I call them two times
[3:13:48.520 --> 3:13:55.000]  a day and helm disaster on these issues the fact remains that we had a
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:14:01.520]  cessation of hostilities we didn't find a peace treaty and end the Korean War now
[3:14:01.520 --> 3:14:08.320]  we have two presidents prior who sat there and did not a damn thing while
[3:14:08.320 --> 3:14:14.240]  one of the most dangerous nations in the world develops nuclear weapons so well
[3:14:14.240 --> 3:14:17.960]  most dangerous to who you know I mean that that statement is very relative is
[3:14:17.960 --> 3:14:22.520]  North Korea the most dangerous nation to you know is North Korea the most
[3:14:22.520 --> 3:14:28.120]  dangerous nation to me no so is North Korea the most dangerous nation to South
[3:14:28.120 --> 3:14:34.040]  Korea and North Korea and Japan yes okay so maybe we should start prioritizing
[3:14:34.040 --> 3:14:38.160]  these wars we get involved to and and let's just maybe get an honest admission
[3:14:38.160 --> 3:14:41.640]  as to what our agenda is with our foreign policy that'd be nice Roger Stone
[3:14:41.640 --> 3:14:48.800]  joining us on the other side don't go anywhere fourth hour Alex Jones show we're
[3:14:48.800 --> 3:14:59.640]  on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network on
[3:14:59.640 --> 3:15:03.440]  Sunday Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones broke the news that Google contractors are
[3:15:03.440 --> 3:15:07.080]  being directed to rate info wars articles to push them even further down and
[3:15:07.080 --> 3:15:10.960]  search engine results and liberals came out of the woodwork to say we were lying
[3:15:10.960 --> 3:15:15.800]  well now we have business insider Google says rogue vendor violated guidelines
[3:15:15.800 --> 3:15:20.080]  by instructing contractors to rate info wars as untrustworthy site Google said
[3:15:20.080 --> 3:15:23.600]  that the vendor had mistakenly told staffers working for the search engine
[3:15:23.600 --> 3:15:27.320]  that info wars should be ranked as a low-quality site oh yeah we believe you
[3:15:27.320 --> 3:15:30.920]  Google we believe you Google reps are attempting to distance themselves from
[3:15:30.920 --> 3:15:35.080]  the contractors instructions by saying it does not instruct quality raters on
[3:15:35.080 --> 3:15:38.800]  how to grade specific websites let's read what the contractors said in their

[3:20:12.640 --> 3:20:18.400]  baton to David Knight right here in the central Texas Command Center. Welcome
[3:20:18.400 --> 3:20:23.360]  back to the Alex Jones show Owen shroyer now joined in studio by Roger Stone in
[3:20:23.360 --> 3:20:27.360]  honor to be joined by Roger and you've got a piece that's about to be it actually
[3:20:27.360 --> 3:20:31.120]  might be up on info wars.com right now breaking down the latest on Mike Pompeo
[3:20:31.120 --> 3:20:35.680]  he's for WikiLeaks he's anti WikiLeaks he's spinning himself in a circle Roger
[3:20:35.680 --> 3:20:43.560]  this is a deeply disappointing to me on because the central intelligence agency
[3:20:43.560 --> 3:20:49.960]  and the wanted 17 agencies we keep hearing about have systematically leaked
[3:20:49.960 --> 3:20:54.480]  in an attempt to destabilize the president deligently first delegitimize
[3:20:54.480 --> 3:21:00.720]  his election and then destabilize him and it's clear that the place needs
[3:21:00.720 --> 3:21:07.520]  reform they need to wipe out the whole second and third levels who are continue
[3:21:07.520 --> 3:21:15.400]  to be Obama appointees instead Mike Pompeo seems to be buying the BS narrative
[3:21:15.400 --> 3:21:21.360]  of the careerists the neocons at the Central Intelligence Agency and he
[3:21:21.360 --> 3:21:28.640]  blurted out last Friday that WikiLeaks is a Russian asset so it all to be
[3:21:28.640 --> 3:21:32.680]  completely reasonable I would give Mr. Pompeo reasonable amount of time say
[3:21:32.680 --> 3:21:38.960]  five days to either produce proof of this outrageous claim or resign because
[3:21:38.960 --> 3:21:42.280]  that's not consistent with Donald Trump's view Donald Trump said and I
[3:21:42.280 --> 3:21:50.880]  quote I love WikiLeaks there's no evidence whatsoever of of Julie Nassange
[3:21:50.880 --> 3:21:56.400]  being an asset for the Russian state the intelligence services keep repeating
[3:21:56.400 --> 3:22:01.920]  this because they need it to be true if it's not true well then ultimately and
[3:22:01.920 --> 3:22:07.000]  there is no Russian collusion we're going to learn that the president was
[3:22:07.000 --> 3:22:10.680]  under surveillance or his aides were under surveillance and he was caught up
[3:22:10.680 --> 3:22:16.040]  by it at a minimum for strictly political reasons that's Watergate
[3:22:16.040 --> 3:22:21.080]  times 10 that's spying on the Republican nominee for president
[3:22:21.080 --> 3:22:26.720]  Mr. Pompeo should know better it's clear to me that the agency is going to run
[3:22:26.720 --> 3:22:31.360]  him he cannot run the agency I frankly thank you ought to resign you know and
[3:22:31.360 --> 3:22:36.680]  it's stories like this that remind me about how there's a divide tactic being
[3:22:36.680 --> 3:22:41.040]  worked by the deep state by the media the Democrats the globalist all working
[3:22:41.040 --> 3:22:46.920]  in collusion to try to divide Trump's base and defeat him in 2020 I think that
[3:22:46.920 --> 3:22:51.440]  that's part of this agenda and it's almost amazing you know you say that
[3:22:51.440 --> 3:22:55.760]  Pompeo needs to produce the evidence that he claims that WikiLeaks is a
[3:22:55.760 --> 3:23:00.880]  Russian asset he would have that ability so he should be able to within five days
[3:23:00.880 --> 3:23:05.360]  actually prove that statement true if not I would assume it's false and what
[3:23:05.360 --> 3:23:08.880]  would you think about this it appears to me in that at this point in time that
[3:23:08.880 --> 3:23:13.480]  the drain the swamp it's time for that to become more than just rhetoric he
[3:23:13.480 --> 3:23:18.320]  needs to really drain the swamp immediately well I guess I would I
[3:23:18.320 --> 3:23:23.160]  would make two points one look at the actual quote from the FBI director Mr.
[3:23:23.160 --> 3:23:27.440]  Comey in front of the House Intelligence Committee when he's asked have you been
[3:23:27.440 --> 3:23:32.680]  able to answer term ascertains with certainty that WikiLeaks is a Russian
[3:23:32.680 --> 3:23:38.920]  operation he says well it is our assessment that they've used some kind
[3:23:38.920 --> 3:23:44.120]  of cutout when when that when anybody from an intelligence agency says
[3:23:44.120 --> 3:23:49.360]  assessment that's the buzzword that means they don't know crap that they don't
[3:23:49.360 --> 3:23:53.960]  know anything it's a projection of what they want you to believe some kind of
[3:23:53.960 --> 3:23:57.880]  cutout why don't you tell us who the cutout is you can't because you don't
[3:23:57.880 --> 3:24:05.560]  know because there is no cutout Assange is a freedom fighter he's to me he's a
[3:24:05.560 --> 3:24:11.360]  hero I understand those on the left to say well he's he's broken the law well
[3:24:11.360 --> 3:24:15.520]  they loved him you know eight years ago yeah well he has broken the law on the
[3:24:15.520 --> 3:24:20.120]  other hand the law breaking that he is exposing is so much bigger and more
[3:24:20.120 --> 3:24:24.720]  serious Dr. Martin Luther King broke the law too because he was fighting for a
[3:24:24.720 --> 3:24:32.560]  larger goal these laws specifically are put in place to keep the people ignorant
[3:24:32.560 --> 3:24:40.080]  to to to stop the exposure of the kind of internal corruption and and in some
[3:24:40.080 --> 3:24:45.480]  cases treason that has been perpetrated by both the Obama and the Clinton
[3:24:45.480 --> 3:24:51.200]  administration and to me Assange is a hero he is not working for the Russians
[3:24:51.200 --> 3:24:56.320]  he is working for no nation state but he's against the deep state well and
[3:24:56.320 --> 3:25:00.400]  let's be perfectly clear the emails exposed by WikiLeaks have never been
[3:25:00.400 --> 3:25:04.600]  denied as being real so the emails are real the Democrats admit that they're
[3:25:04.600 --> 3:25:09.560]  real so why aren't we discussing the content of the emails ever why are we
[3:25:09.560 --> 3:25:13.200]  constantly obsessing over claiming it's Russia without any proof what do you
[3:25:13.200 --> 3:25:17.560]  think Mike Pompeo's next move is Roger Stone his pieces on info wars.com right
[3:25:17.560 --> 3:25:25.680]  now my guess is that he is going to resist the president needs to order him
[3:25:25.680 --> 3:25:29.560]  to produce this in my opinion and I'm going to express that when I have the
[3:25:29.560 --> 3:25:36.400]  opportunity the real question is where does the whole Russian meme go because
[3:25:36.400 --> 3:25:40.440]  it should have died when we're now looking at a new Cold War and perhaps
[3:25:40.440 --> 3:25:44.400]  perhaps World War three with Russia but didn't die there did it no it's
[3:25:44.400 --> 3:25:49.960]  interesting the the incursion into Syria should have put the end to this it
[3:25:49.960 --> 3:25:54.320]  took it should have taken the wind out of the sails of the whole argument how
[3:25:54.320 --> 3:26:00.320]  can Donald Trump be in bed with Putin when he's kicking him in the ass in
[3:26:00.320 --> 3:26:06.220]  Syria but as I said the reason I think the intelligence agencies and the
[3:26:06.220 --> 3:26:10.040]  military industrial complex so desperately need to find some Russian
[3:26:10.040 --> 3:26:17.640]  link is if they fail to do so they will be naked when the examination of Susan
[3:26:17.640 --> 3:26:24.440]  Rice and Valerie Jarrett and their use of intelligence data comes into focus and
[3:26:24.440 --> 3:26:29.760]  that's jail time in other words if you look at Watergate as the only other
[3:26:29.760 --> 3:26:35.960]  previous national scandal we have had regarding you know surveillance and so
[3:26:35.960 --> 3:26:40.880]  on while the Senate Watergate Committee hearings destabilize Nixon while the
[3:26:40.880 --> 3:26:45.800]  House hearings on impeachment really signaled the end was the Watergate
[3:26:45.800 --> 3:26:51.400]  special prosecutor who really sent people to jail Jeff Sessions needs to
[3:26:51.400 --> 3:26:55.440]  get more aggressive or the president needs to order him to do so it's time to
[3:26:55.440 --> 3:27:01.880]  impanel a grand jury it's time for the grand jury to question Susan Rice
[3:27:01.880 --> 3:27:07.760]  Valerie Jarrett but what I want to know Owen is what did the president know and
[3:27:07.760 --> 3:27:12.200]  when did he know it there is the real question for the grand jury well and
[3:27:12.200 --> 3:27:18.280]  here's the reason why I think Obama is on a deserted island is because of that
[3:27:18.280 --> 3:27:23.080]  right there I really think no extradition I really believe that he is
[3:27:23.080 --> 3:27:27.840]  avoiding extradition because here's the thing I think that there's a major
[3:27:27.840 --> 3:27:31.520]  precedent that can be set here there's a major example that can be set here with
[3:27:31.520 --> 3:27:35.280]  people like Susan Rice people like Valerie Jarrett who knows maybe even
[3:27:35.280 --> 3:27:38.160]  Barack Obama I mean you know let's not forget Trump called out his birth
[3:27:38.160 --> 3:27:41.480]  certificate yes he read he retracted on that but I think he was kind of forced
[3:27:41.480 --> 3:27:45.040]  to they could set an example let's get these people in front of a jury and
[3:27:45.040 --> 3:27:49.720]  either force them to commit perjury or force them to admit what they did that's
[3:27:49.720 --> 3:27:53.880]  what this country needs right now the focus needs to be back on our swamp not
[3:27:53.880 --> 3:27:57.280]  a swamp in North Korea you want to take some calls Roger yeah that's a great
[3:27:57.280 --> 3:28:01.520]  idea let's do it let's first go to James who is in South Carolina wants to
[3:28:01.520 --> 3:28:05.880]  talk about Trump in Korea go ahead James
[3:28:05.880 --> 3:28:14.280]  hi the evolution of if you might call it evolution of the problem with North
[3:28:14.280 --> 3:28:21.800]  Korea stems from the department they have a terrible economy and I don't
[3:28:21.800 --> 3:28:27.080]  believe they will ever get rid of the nuclear power or their race for nuclear
[3:28:27.080 --> 3:28:32.840]  missiles because they don't want to well okay so then the threat that America's
[3:28:32.840 --> 3:28:37.400]  interest is shutting down North Korea's nuclear capabilities getting in there
[3:28:37.400 --> 3:28:41.200]  disrupting Kim Jong-un from becoming nuclear capable or putting a warhead at
[3:28:41.200 --> 3:28:45.040]  the end of a missile I don't buy the economic thing because please let's
[3:28:45.040 --> 3:28:48.680]  look around the world there are plenty of countries that are in economic poverty
[3:28:48.680 --> 3:28:53.480]  other than North Korea thank you for the call James Roger you know I'm a
[3:28:53.480 --> 3:28:58.120]  non-interventionist I think Donald Trump is a non-interventionist there are
[3:28:58.120 --> 3:29:02.720]  times however when American power must be projected there were there are times
[3:29:02.720 --> 3:29:08.200]  when international foes really do pose a fundamental danger to the United
[3:29:08.200 --> 3:29:15.320]  States North Korea is such a place very clearly based on what recently happened
[3:29:15.320 --> 3:29:20.560]  in Syria what has recently happened in Afghanistan no longer do we have an
[3:29:20.560 --> 3:29:24.960]  American president who will draw a line in the sand and then sit back helplessly
[3:29:24.960 --> 3:29:32.520]  while our adversaries cross it and this is not the Obama administration anymore
[3:29:32.520 --> 3:29:39.280]  and the coddling of the North Korean dictator is over Donald Trump will do
[3:29:39.280 --> 3:29:44.320]  what is necessary to ensure that he doesn't have deliverable nuclear weapons
[3:29:44.320 --> 3:29:51.000]  thank God for that sadly there are still places where we do need to project
[3:29:51.000 --> 3:29:55.480]  American power to protect our self-interest North Korea to me is one of
[3:29:55.480 --> 3:30:00.360]  them let's go to another caller let's go to Jason who's calling in from Germany
[3:30:00.360 --> 3:30:05.720]  go ahead Jason hey it's a pleasure to be on with you Owen and mr. Stone the
[3:30:05.720 --> 3:30:10.560]  truly a pleasure for the first time to be able to talk to you sir thank you gosh I
[3:30:10.560 --> 3:30:13.880]  wish I could rap with you guys about these things for all night and
[3:30:13.880 --> 3:30:19.440]  practically Roger you were on Bill Marshall recently you guys talked about
[3:30:19.440 --> 3:30:24.680]  the 420 thing you know about cannabis legalization and the rights issues and
[3:30:24.680 --> 3:30:29.920]  whatnot there's a really good article I'll forget the online magazine it's
[3:30:29.920 --> 3:30:35.000]  called cannabis or marijuana legislation where federalism goes to die
[3:30:35.000 --> 3:30:39.960]  basically outlines you know how nobody who claims that they're in for states
[3:30:39.960 --> 3:30:44.000]  rights can honestly admit that by maintaining you know the status quo
[3:30:44.000 --> 3:30:49.760]  schedule federal schedule of drugs that they use for cannabis can can maintain
[3:30:49.760 --> 3:30:53.240]  that and say that they're for states rights that's that's one one point I
[3:30:53.240 --> 3:30:58.400]  wanted to drop real quick but um as far as delivering on domestic issues which
[3:30:58.400 --> 3:31:02.000]  Alex loves to bring up and I don't want to hit on Alex I love Alex I love you
[3:31:02.000 --> 3:31:07.680]  show up everybody works there but here's the thing they the elite know that
[3:31:07.680 --> 3:31:12.440]  there's many ways you can skin a cat and I feel like Trump could conceivably
[3:31:12.440 --> 3:31:16.600]  deliver on all the domestic issues he wanted all the ones that he promised and
[3:31:16.600 --> 3:31:23.200]  it wouldn't hurt the bottom line of the people behind the curtain as it were
[3:31:23.200 --> 3:31:26.400]  that are really pulling the strings around the world it wouldn't hurt them
[3:31:26.400 --> 3:31:30.800]  at all for Trump to deliver on all those domestic issues and they could still
[3:31:30.800 --> 3:31:34.800]  kind of weasel their way into the affairs of Americans such a way that they
[3:31:34.800 --> 3:31:38.560]  still get the end product that they really want anyway or still or still
[3:31:38.560 --> 3:31:43.000]  persuade Trump into using United States foreign policy to get their agenda
[3:31:43.000 --> 3:31:46.920]  across the globe I hear what you're saying Roger I don't think anybody thought
[3:31:46.920 --> 3:31:52.320]  this was going to be easy we're trying to undo 30 years of bad decisions that
[3:31:52.320 --> 3:31:57.920]  were in many cases purposely made and there is an entrenched opposition in
[3:31:57.920 --> 3:32:03.840]  Washington in the Democratic Party in the media that is barely recognizes the
[3:32:03.840 --> 3:32:10.360]  president's election so you're right except for to say that if he enacts his
[3:32:10.360 --> 3:32:16.240]  domestic agenda he will strengthen his governing coalition and therefore he
[3:32:16.240 --> 3:32:20.520]  would have greater strength to take on the international globalists and the
[3:32:20.520 --> 3:32:28.320]  two-party duopoly in Washington and he is at base a fighter he's also
[3:32:28.320 --> 3:32:33.440]  realistic he's absolutely right I wouldn't engage the Chinese on trade or
[3:32:33.440 --> 3:32:37.720]  currency manipulation at the exact moment that we need their assistance to
[3:32:37.720 --> 3:32:42.160]  disarm the North Koreans you got to have priorities if we are incinerate
[3:32:42.160 --> 3:32:46.840]  incinerated by thermonuclear weapon it won't matter what our trade policies
[3:32:46.840 --> 3:32:53.600]  have been so the president understands priorities don't underestimate him that's
[3:32:53.600 --> 3:32:59.040]  all I can say he's going to get his domestic agenda done we've already
[3:32:59.040 --> 3:33:04.720]  seated the first of what I think could be for conservative Supreme Court
[3:33:04.720 --> 3:33:11.960]  justices you can make no more fundamental change in the country than
[3:33:11.960 --> 3:33:17.160]  that yes there is a there's a difficult struggle ahead well and I think if you
[3:33:17.160 --> 3:33:21.240]  look at it from the standpoint as he's building a campaign up for 2020 it's
[3:33:21.240 --> 3:33:26.000]  working very well building up domestic policy is going to help and even though a
[3:33:26.000 --> 3:33:29.720]  lot of the Info Wars fans or Info Wars base may be divided on Trump right now
[3:33:29.720 --> 3:33:35.160]  in his foreign policy the Fox News base out there those type of people the drive
[3:33:35.160 --> 3:33:38.720]  by media viewers they love everything he's doing and I think that he's really
[3:33:38.720 --> 3:33:42.920]  building a nice case for 2020 right now and he's trying to win that I think let's
[3:33:42.920 --> 3:33:47.880]  take one more call let's go to Greg in Oregon go ahead Greg you're on air with
[3:33:47.880 --> 3:33:54.440]  Roger Stone hi oh and hi Roger it was a pleasure to be on with you guys go ahead
[3:33:54.440 --> 3:34:02.360]  Greg thank you yeah I hope that Trump let somebody else take care of North
[3:34:02.360 --> 3:34:08.520]  Korea and back off of that we don't need any more wars let China deal with them
[3:34:08.520 --> 3:34:15.440]  and cool them off I agree I think we need to get out all these wars our
[3:34:15.440 --> 3:34:20.320]  country is in serious bad trouble and Trump needs to drain the swamp in the
[3:34:20.320 --> 3:34:25.080]  White House I believe he's already been compromised and they're taking over and
[3:34:25.080 --> 3:34:30.480]  forcing him to do things he's led his general run the military right now and
[3:34:30.480 --> 3:34:36.280]  he doesn't have any say in it I I believe these are even compromised every
[3:34:36.280 --> 3:34:43.000]  sense that CIA put that picture of the grand baby in the bedroom set that
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:47.800]  picture out he has changed he starts flip flopping and everything else and you
[3:34:47.800 --> 3:34:53.040]  know I voted for him and everything else so and I hope not but it sure looks
[3:34:53.040 --> 3:35:00.760]  like it is going that direction well I think the caller Greg you're half
[3:35:00.760 --> 3:35:08.600]  right there's definitely is an effort to to you know to make him a puppet but I
[3:35:08.600 --> 3:35:15.600]  don't think they understand the man perfect example we made the limited
[3:35:15.600 --> 3:35:21.680]  strike into Syria the generals now come in for the kill we need 150,000 boots on
[3:35:21.680 --> 3:35:26.960]  the ground immediately we need to ramp up these attacks Trump just based on his
[3:35:26.960 --> 3:35:32.240]  own instinct with no one on the White House staff sadly not even our friend
[3:35:32.240 --> 3:35:39.080]  Steve Bannon urging him not to go into Syria Trump moves immediately and comes
[3:35:39.080 --> 3:35:42.440]  to the right place no we're not having expanded war this is not going to be the
[3:35:42.440 --> 3:35:47.960]  next Vietnam the next Iraq so my trust is in Donald Trump yeah there they are
[3:35:47.960 --> 3:35:53.520]  trying to undercut him they're trying to to flip him they will not succeed final

[3:42:29.280 --> 3:42:33.320]  tolerant left you know I mean you don't everybody has a right to free speech
