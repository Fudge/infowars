[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he

[00:20.760 --> 00:28.240]  this is a Friday edition of this worldwide transmission against tyranny that I assure

[00:35.520 --> 00:47.280]  15th day of January 2010 we're obviously going to break down the unbelievable crisis that is
[00:47.280 --> 00:54.280]  unfolding in Haiti and illustrate the fact that government cannot and will not protect you
[00:54.280 --> 01:00.360]  whether it's Katrina in the United States with the hurricane or whether it is the massive earthquake
[01:00.360 --> 01:07.640]  that devastated the major cities of Haiti killing at least a hundred thousand people collapsing into
[01:07.640 --> 01:15.640]  absolute anarchy machete machete wielding thugs running around robbing tens of thousands of people
[01:15.640 --> 01:23.560]  at the US military bases waving their passports wildly trying to get out of the country this
[01:23.560 --> 01:29.680]  is what collapse looks like and our country is very close to similar problems though it's
[01:29.680 --> 01:35.880]  happening on a more incremental slide we're going to get into all the big developments with open
[01:35.880 --> 01:42.280]  discussion of the United States defaulting on its global debt or fully devaluing the dollar at
[01:42.280 --> 01:52.560]  least 50 percent we have Bob Chapman joining us for his once a week Friday visit in the third hour
[01:52.560 --> 01:59.560]  on the economy and other news issues and Deborah Medina she was in the Republican debate last
[01:59.560 --> 02:04.400]  night and I read a lot of newspaper articles and headlines this morning and also tuned into news
[02:04.400 --> 02:16.080]  radio 590 k lb j and w o a i and w b a p and spot check what they were talking about every
[02:16.080 --> 02:23.800]  caller and I only listened for about 30 minutes to each radio station every caller was calling in
[02:23.800 --> 02:30.360]  saying they liked Deborah Medina I listened probably for a little bit more to the Todd and
[02:30.360 --> 02:35.760]  Don show on news radio 590 this morning before I went to work and driving into work it comes on
[02:35.760 --> 02:43.800]  right before us and they were taking call after call after call saying they don't like the two
[02:43.800 --> 02:49.800]  establishment whores Rick Perry and Kay Bailey Hutchinson both of them are elitist both of
[02:49.800 --> 02:56.440]  them are slick talkers and but they said but I don't want to vote for a loser oh I can't vote for
[02:56.440 --> 03:04.080]  the alternative candidate even though I like her so that mind control is still in play but
[03:04.080 --> 03:09.240]  beginning to erode she'll be joining us coming up in the next hour will play clips of the amazing
[03:09.240 --> 03:14.240]  debate no matter where you live in the country this is important because Texas obviously the
[03:14.240 --> 03:18.840]  second largest geographic state the second most populated state after California the fastest
[03:18.840 --> 03:26.640]  growing state as people evacuate New York Florida Michigan California Oregon Washington other
[03:26.640 --> 03:35.760]  globalized literal corporate communist states that are being looted so Texas is online to become
[03:35.760 --> 03:41.960]  the most popular state in the union within the next decade and we see the shape of things to
[03:41.960 --> 03:47.880]  come if other people would just run for governor who are part of the Ron Paul movement you will
[03:47.880 --> 03:53.760]  at least cause massive education of the public within the debates and then set the stage in the
[03:53.760 --> 03:59.920]  next elections coming up in the year to follow and the year after that there's always state and
[03:59.920 --> 04:06.760]  federal elections going on to show people the power of running for office whether it's mayor or
[04:06.760 --> 04:11.680]  city council or county commissioner or governor or agriculture commissioner it doesn't matter
[04:11.680 --> 04:18.160]  transportation commissioner you run you get to get in the big debates you get to talk to the
[04:18.160 --> 04:23.440]  crowds you get to educate them and show them the alternative to the new world order and this goes
[04:23.440 --> 04:30.920]  for Democratic positions and Republican positions this goes for people running in both parties the
[04:30.920 --> 04:35.560]  most successful thing you can do is not just start third parties it's infiltrate the Republican and
[04:35.560 --> 04:41.120]  Democratic parties and she is really exploding in the polls and whether she wins the election or
[04:41.120 --> 04:47.600]  not she wins in the info war resistance is victory so that's coming up and then the biggest story
[04:47.600 --> 04:54.880]  of the day the most important issue that I haven't even covered yet we'll break that down on the

[08:54.640 --> 09:02.800]  with this lady months ago hands down in newspapers across the state and all over talk radio that i
[09:02.800 --> 09:12.480]  monitored this morning every single caller was talking about deborah medina that shows the hunger
[09:13.200 --> 09:19.440]  by the american people to resist the new world order and to throw out the false left right
[09:19.440 --> 09:24.400]  paradigm and get back to true liberty she was up there in the governor's race in the republican
[09:24.400 --> 09:29.840]  debate there's talk of trying to restrict her from future debates now because she's been so successful
[09:29.840 --> 09:35.120]  curtain memo has an article up on that at info wars dot com in fact guys print that for me it'll be
[09:35.120 --> 09:38.960]  in the news and focus archive it's already moved to that area so much news is posted there
[09:41.520 --> 09:48.880]  every caller i sat there with my mouth hanging open listening to w o a i out of san antonio the
[09:48.880 --> 09:54.640]  number one talker there news radio 590 k lbj the number one talker in austin w v a p the number
[09:54.640 --> 09:59.440]  one talker out of dalis i didn't have time to monitor the others while i was busy researching
[09:59.440 --> 10:06.560]  and reading news this morning i had a feeling after watching that debate uh that it was going
[10:06.560 --> 10:13.920]  to resonate with the people and it did i've never seen anything like this grow this fast and again
[10:13.920 --> 10:20.080]  whether you live in michigan or new york or california it shows the hunger of the people
[10:20.080 --> 10:29.440]  for the true tea party movement not the glenn beck uh tea party oid republican party takeover the
[10:29.440 --> 10:35.360]  attempted takeover of it but the real ron paul revolution this lady just a year ago is a registered
[10:35.360 --> 10:42.400]  nurse they're speaking at ron paul events at in the fed events one of my listeners now look at
[10:42.400 --> 10:52.800]  her today even if she doesn't win the republican nomination to go up against the democrats this
[10:52.800 --> 10:59.760]  is republican state if she wins that hands down she'll win and be the new governor she wins by
[10:59.760 --> 11:07.600]  injecting real issues just like ron paul did in 2008 where we went from less than 10 of americans
[11:07.600 --> 11:11.760]  in major polls knowing the private federal reserve was private and knowing that it was the source of
[11:11.760 --> 11:19.920]  most of our economic problems and the tyranny to over 90 percent now in major polls want to
[11:19.920 --> 11:28.000]  audit and abolish the fed two months ago it was 75 percent in gallup now major polls it's over 90
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.120]  percent have identified the real government the real enemy the illegitimate criminals
[11:35.360 --> 11:41.600]  decades of patriots trying to expose the federal reserve trying to wake people up all of your work
[11:41.600 --> 11:48.160]  now really starting to bear fruit and this is only the beginning only the beginning because even
[11:48.160 --> 11:52.880]  if medina doesn't win the media and the co entail probe will say see it was all a defeat you shouldn't
[11:52.880 --> 11:57.920]  have canvassed you shouldn't have knocked on doors you shouldn't have given money see nothing happened
[11:58.560 --> 12:03.920]  no something happened and she could still win in fact she's really getting momentum i'm saying
[12:03.920 --> 12:09.600]  she wins either way we win either way because now there's governor races coming up next year
[12:09.600 --> 12:14.080]  year there's governor races coming up the year after that there's congressional elections coming
[12:14.080 --> 12:24.960]  up every two years coming up this year so that people see the viability of average doctors and
[12:24.960 --> 12:33.520]  nurses and ranchers and farmers and school teachers and lawyers and businessmen and women
[12:33.520 --> 12:41.360]  running for political office you win when you carry the message of truth to the debates whether
[12:41.360 --> 12:48.800]  it be in a small town or a big city or televised on every major news station and on every major
[12:48.800 --> 12:57.040]  radio news station the debate last night where she annihilated them in a calm focused way
[12:57.040 --> 13:08.560]  day i watched uh maria rene borales of k u v n tv bumbling in her ignorant fashion
[13:09.280 --> 13:17.680]  in a sniveling fashion asked debor medina last night from the debates and then you say someone
[13:17.680 --> 13:22.400]  should be able to have a gun without a license this person doesn't know that you can have a
[13:22.400 --> 13:27.440]  gun without a license that the concealed carry creates the illusion you've got to have a license
[13:27.440 --> 13:31.760]  to own a gun that's why i think it's so dangerous and that's why debor medina wants open second
[13:31.760 --> 13:38.880]  amendment vermont style concealed carry arizona style nevada style concealed carry that makes
[13:38.880 --> 13:47.920]  crime rates plunge over 20 within two years of it being implemented just basic concealed carry
[13:47.920 --> 13:53.280]  gets an average 26 drop those are official numbers out of florida and other states that
[13:53.280 --> 14:02.720]  have done it on average 20 plus percent you do a complete just flat out no license you can carry
[14:02.720 --> 14:08.240]  your guns see you can carry a rifle or shotgun loaded in your car they passed laws specifically
[14:08.240 --> 14:13.200]  against handguns which is a violation of the second amendment in my state and should be overturned
[14:13.200 --> 14:20.080]  so this woman ignorantly and remember the general public gets their news from sitcoms and dramas
[14:20.080 --> 14:25.680]  based in new york and chicago all the cop shows where they every episode oh look we busted somebody
[14:25.680 --> 14:30.080]  with a gun in their car they're going to jail oh look this guy had a gun in his apartment he's
[14:30.080 --> 14:36.560]  going to jail yeah new york city there's only a few cities like dc and new york and chicago
[14:36.560 --> 14:43.120]  where this is the case where you have almost complete gunbands and we've even started the process
[14:43.120 --> 14:49.040]  of defeating that in dc with the case last year saying no there is a second amendment right
[14:51.120 --> 14:56.560]  and so it shows the unbelievable ignorance and medina just cuts her off she's coming up
[14:56.560 --> 15:00.480]  next hour i'm getting into our top story in a moment i'm going to detail what's happening
[15:00.480 --> 15:06.240]  at hady as well the economy google censorship in china they went along with the censorship helped
[15:06.240 --> 15:09.840]  them design their censorship system and then the chinese double crossed them
[15:11.760 --> 15:15.840]  and so google says they're going to remove censorship there google's being consulted
[15:15.840 --> 15:22.560]  along with ibm and others with the new internet security cyber security czar to openly quote
[15:22.560 --> 15:27.440]  shut down freedom of speech in the us australia has already implemented quote their own government
[15:27.440 --> 15:34.400]  statement chinese style net censorship it's happening the top white house regulatory czar
[15:34.400 --> 15:41.840]  who interprets all the federal laws cast sunstein has said they do want to quote ban free speech
[15:41.840 --> 15:49.680]  i mean he openly states it and i've researched this guy even more that's our top story today
[15:49.680 --> 15:56.400]  coming up at the start of the next segment but again ladies and gentlemen these people are
[15:56.400 --> 16:01.920]  radical they're unconstitutional they're unamerican they try to tell us we're radical it isn't working
[16:01.920 --> 16:06.880]  anymore they are the revolutionaries trying to overthrow our bill of rights and constitution
[16:06.880 --> 16:13.840]  and our way of life they are the traders not us and cast sunstein is set to become the next supreme
[16:13.840 --> 16:21.680]  court justice in the next year when ruth bader ginsberg steps down he is an open stated communist
[16:21.680 --> 16:28.800]  they say they're communist every czar he's got is on record praising marx and engels and linen
[16:28.800 --> 16:34.960]  and stalin and even mal these people are unspeakable then they write white papers for the government
[16:34.960 --> 16:40.160]  saying ban communist conspiracy theories that communist are taking over when they themselves
[16:40.160 --> 16:46.560]  are communist saying ban our free speech but this isn't what your grandpa thought communist were
[16:47.280 --> 16:55.280]  communist are a revolutionary weapons system poured out and deployed by central banks to rob
[16:55.280 --> 17:01.760]  middle classes and transfer the money to the international banks beginning back to deba
[17:01.760 --> 17:08.560]  medina here she is being questioned by the moron reporter for k u v in who doesn't even understand
[17:08.560 --> 17:14.480]  the state laws and here's deba medina's counter and this is why the state's on fire this is what
[17:14.480 --> 17:20.000]  texas really wants here it is you have indicated that you oppose laws that limit the right to bear
[17:20.000 --> 17:25.360]  arms in fact you have stated that you carry a gun in your car and that you don't have a concealed
[17:25.360 --> 17:29.440]  handgun license although we know that in texas you don't need one to carry a gun in your car
[17:29.440 --> 17:36.560]  given how you feel is there any type of restriction or limit as to who can carry a weapon what type
[17:36.560 --> 17:44.960]  of weapon and where do you feel there should be any i think again rena here is a classic example
[17:44.960 --> 17:53.440]  between someone who understands a constitutional republic understands the u.s constitution and
[17:53.440 --> 18:01.280]  the answers that both the senator and the governor will give we've had too many tragedies to count
[18:01.280 --> 18:06.400]  in recent memory in america we've had columbine we've had virginia tech we've had nine eleven
[18:06.400 --> 18:14.400]  we've had fort hood every time we have that sort of tragedy the big government answer is to dearm
[18:14.400 --> 18:21.680]  the people and yet our founders understood the importance of gun ownership as a essential
[18:21.680 --> 18:27.840]  element of freedom private property ownership and gun ownership the two things essential to a
[18:27.840 --> 18:34.960]  free society if we want to talk about safety security and freedom in texas we ought to be
[18:34.960 --> 18:41.440]  eliminating gun registration we'd recognize that gun registration has been used throughout history
[18:41.440 --> 18:48.800]  for one thing only and that is gun confiscation so yes i have a strong advocate of the right to
[18:48.800 --> 18:55.040]  keep and bear arms but where would you draw the line or the limit you've said that the private
[18:55.040 --> 19:02.880]  sector should be as or better armed than the government to avoid tyranny correct correct so
[19:02.880 --> 19:08.320]  where do you draw the limit there's no limit you the people the tenth amendment says those powers
[19:08.320 --> 19:13.840]  not delegated to the united states government are reserved to the people in the state so it is up to
[19:13.840 --> 19:19.360]  the texas legislature and to the people of this state to set limits on gun ownership you gotta
[19:19.360 --> 19:25.920]  the feds have no jurisdiction pbrain we've made every other law abiding citizen in the state subject
[19:25.920 --> 19:31.280]  to onerous regulations and prohibited them from being able to protect themselves and their family
[19:31.280 --> 19:39.760]  we cannot deny man the right to life liberty and property we must restore true gun ownership in
[19:39.760 --> 19:44.000]  texas do you observe the concealed weapon law in the state do you take your do you take your
[19:44.000 --> 19:49.200]  handgun into grocery stores i do not i i observe the law i do not take my handgun into grocery
[19:49.200 --> 19:55.440]  stores okay thank you just all right ladies and gentlemen and it went on from there she's joining
[19:55.440 --> 20:00.560]  us coming up in the next hour a big exclusive interview right after the debates last night
[20:00.560 --> 20:04.800]  you have a mortgage and a load of other debt wouldn't it be great if it all just went away
[20:04.800 --> 20:09.280]  no more mortgage can change your life we paid off all of our bills all your debt including your
[20:09.280 --> 20:14.400]  mortgage in as little as nine years with no more mortgage we will have saved over three hundred and

[24:10.560 --> 24:17.760]  the news i've got is so
[24:19.680 --> 24:21.200]  abominably important
[24:24.560 --> 24:30.160]  that i'm going to cover it starting in the next segment i want everyone to prepare themselves
[24:30.160 --> 24:35.440]  for this i don't want to just put this information out with all the other globalist crimes
[24:35.440 --> 24:44.960]  and let it join the stream of tyranny i want to specifically focus in on something that reveals
[24:44.960 --> 24:53.360]  everything and every day it just hits me harder and stronger as i gain greater understanding just
[24:53.360 --> 25:00.640]  how real this is and that it was worse than even i ever thought last night i was sitting
[25:00.640 --> 25:09.200]  there in an easy chair kind of meditating focusing thinking and it was just so intense i was shaken to
[25:09.200 --> 25:16.880]  my knees it was late at night my family was asleep i actually got down on my knees and just prayed
[25:16.880 --> 25:24.720]  to god almighty to open people's eyes even further because if it's taken me 16 17 years 14 years on
[25:24.720 --> 25:31.600]  air to get to this level of understanding if i could only show people what i know and it's all
[25:31.600 --> 25:37.680]  public it's all available but if i have trouble even grasping just how bad these people are and
[25:37.680 --> 25:43.920]  really let it burn into me they're not misguided liberals they're not misguided conservatives
[25:43.920 --> 25:52.240]  these people are psychopathic hyper dominant despots who want to squat on our society and
[25:52.240 --> 26:00.240]  have their way with us it's just so incredible it is so amazing and it's coming up in the next segment
[26:02.400 --> 26:06.880]  on the subject of government i don't have to tell you that haydie was already
[26:09.840 --> 26:17.760]  the armpit of the world as bad as north korea in many respects far worse than mexico who's in the
[26:17.760 --> 26:29.360]  top five of cess pits on the planet it makes nigeria or rwanda or sumalia look like a paradise
[26:31.920 --> 26:37.440]  haydie is a hell pit and they have a religion of hell
[26:41.600 --> 26:45.760]  and there are a lot of good people there but they've always had a corrupt government they've
[26:45.760 --> 26:53.360]  always had a system of enslavement and they are descending into one of the worst examples in
[26:53.360 --> 27:00.560]  history ever of a total collapse of a society and it gives you a window a bird's eye view
[27:00.560 --> 27:06.800]  into just how transitory and weak and little humanity is compared to the wider universe and
[27:06.800 --> 27:13.200]  god's creation that earthquake hits there's at least a hundred thousand people dead the their
[27:13.200 --> 27:20.640]  capital building completely collapsed there's the power of the big manicured white castle
[27:20.640 --> 27:26.800]  white palace collapsed in on itself it's it's three domes fully collapsed in to the bottom of
[27:26.800 --> 27:36.800]  the structure government cannot will not protect you it doesn't want to protect you it wants to
[27:36.800 --> 27:46.240]  make you dependent and loot you and rob you and the minute they take over the society and disarm the
[27:46.240 --> 27:52.000]  public the country begins winding down into full collapse it doesn't matter if it's rome it doesn't
[27:52.000 --> 27:57.040]  matter if it's north korea it doesn't matter if it's mexico look at mexico has been collapsed for a
[27:57.040 --> 28:02.160]  year but nothing like haydie but it's officially collapsed into just bedlam and starvation and
[28:02.160 --> 28:09.600]  tyranny they have little manicured areas where the tourists come a dozen or so little cities that are
[28:09.600 --> 28:15.920]  still seeing an increased crime and corruption but the rest of the nation is collapsed but nothing
[28:15.920 --> 28:23.360]  like haydie food security collapses in haydie as machete wielding gangs fight in the streets
[28:23.360 --> 28:32.080]  gangs armed with machetes loot porta prints central business district resembles hell on earth
[28:32.080 --> 28:38.400]  this is cbs news central business district resembles hell on earth as bodies pile up and
[28:38.400 --> 28:45.840]  armed men battle over food supplies why do i have gold and silver and armaments why do i
[28:45.840 --> 28:54.160]  know how to use them why do i have food because that's the job of any man to protect his family and
[28:54.160 --> 29:02.240]  i know that if this was 1950 i may not need a huge food supply or guns but i sure need them now
[29:02.240 --> 29:08.800]  because the banks do plan on collapsing this society and then reorganizing they want a
[29:08.800 --> 29:15.120]  soviet style collapse and out of chaos they will bring their new world order as david rockerfeller
[29:15.120 --> 29:20.160]  has written as henry kissinger has written now if we expose these criminals and fight them
[29:20.160 --> 29:24.320]  in every front they may not be able to carry out the collapse but right now they're on schedule to
[29:24.320 --> 29:31.840]  do it as all of our expert economist and historian guest have said we're already collapsing the media
[29:31.840 --> 29:35.680]  keeps telling you everything's fine but i was talking to my neighbors they're finally waking up

[32:34.400 --> 32:40.000]  we will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner we will deeply regret
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.880]  that we didn't get enough food putting off emergency food preparations will be the most
[32:44.880 --> 32:54.560]  dangerous decision that some of us will ever make call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com

[34:44.000 --> 34:50.400]  all they want us to do is keep on killing one another
[34:50.400 --> 35:12.480]  feel this morning here's the key listen carefully they don't want us to unite
[35:12.480 --> 35:18.480]  they don't want to see us live together goldman sacks wants more wars
[35:20.400 --> 35:30.080]  all they want us to do is keep on killing one another top racket you tell them bob marley did
[35:30.080 --> 35:44.160]  you mean what you said are you scared co until pro getting us to fight with each other and that
[35:44.160 --> 35:51.120]  is coming up in a moment but first
[35:51.120 --> 36:00.320]  next haydie completely collapsing nothing the government can do nothing the u.s. government
[36:00.320 --> 36:07.200]  can do absolute hell unfolding the big charities are on the news getting tens of millions of
[36:07.200 --> 36:12.960]  dollars of donations the big charities caught over and over again giving almost nothing to the
[36:12.960 --> 36:17.760]  people in the nation oh they'll show up with inoculations for them in a few months that sterilize
[36:17.760 --> 36:23.680]  them that'll be about it so we're trying to analyze and research now who are the real
[36:24.480 --> 36:29.120]  charities in country and the real charities were so small they've all collapsed and evacuated
[36:30.240 --> 36:36.160]  so what do you do for haydie the issue is ladies and gentlemen basically all you can do is take
[36:36.160 --> 36:42.160]  care of yourself and take care of your neighbors and be prepared before things like this happen
[36:42.160 --> 36:53.280]  but because of a culture of systemic corruption haydie is particularly susceptible to complete
[36:54.640 --> 37:05.360]  absolute road warrior collapse and that has now officially happened gangs armed with machetes
[37:05.360 --> 37:10.720]  loot port-a-prince central business district resembles hell on earth as bodies pile up and
[37:10.720 --> 37:17.040]  arm men battle over food supplies the earthquake aftermath has brought out the best and worst of
[37:17.040 --> 37:21.760]  people in haydie much like the days after hurricane Katrina looting has become a problem very quickly
[37:22.320 --> 37:27.440]  the looting appears to be isolated to port-a-prince old commercial center it's an area that under
[37:27.440 --> 37:32.160]  normal circumstances will be filled with many shops markets and few homes but on wednesday
[37:32.160 --> 37:38.000]  it was completely different scene and again that's an area that has been evacuated there aren't people
[37:38.000 --> 37:43.360]  armed in there to protect their homes because it's a business district so it's being looted again
[37:44.240 --> 37:49.920]  many Haitians have crude firearms or knives or machetes they can protect their homes
[37:50.960 --> 37:56.800]  but it's the government and business district that can't the article goes on to say it looks
[37:56.800 --> 38:02.800]  like a war zone some of the buildings were on fire smoke was everywhere and there were bodies in the
[38:02.800 --> 38:12.320]  streets many just quake victims lying there where they were killed by the magnitude 7.0 blast hit
[38:13.600 --> 38:19.040]  what made the situation that much more tense was sightings of gangs of young men with machetes
[38:19.040 --> 38:23.840]  on wednesday they were seen getting into stores and taking over the supplies they could carry
[38:24.480 --> 38:28.560]  and now by friday it's much worse the armed men were seen marching up and down the streets with
[38:28.560 --> 38:36.960]  machetes raised and the competition among gangs turned quite fierce fights of gangs were seen
[38:36.960 --> 38:42.400]  on the streets machetes were flailing as it was impossible to predict what would happen next
[38:43.280 --> 38:47.280]  there was no sign of police or any kind of law and order
[38:48.880 --> 38:53.120]  Haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere food is often scarce now with this
[38:53.120 --> 39:00.080]  tragedy despite the fact that there's some western aid desperate people are doing whatever they can
[39:01.120 --> 39:04.800]  whatever they have to do to eat people were seen going through the stores
[39:05.440 --> 39:11.200]  and rubble and taking anything they could find with them for their trip back now every major
[39:11.200 --> 39:14.560]  pentagon study that's been done and many other private studies that have been done
[39:14.560 --> 39:21.600]  show within five days most people will begin looting within 10 most people will over 90%
[39:21.600 --> 39:29.840]  will kill for food and within 15 days universally cannibalism sets in now this is done as a
[39:29.840 --> 39:36.320]  laboratory test we know FEMA cut the police transmission cables and cell phone towers
[39:36.880 --> 39:43.200]  as the storm blew in we know they blocked the red cross we know they blocked the national
[39:43.200 --> 39:47.680]  guard we know they blocked local police and agencies out of texas we know they blocked
[39:47.680 --> 39:53.200]  walmart and most importantly the coast guard from bringing any aid the tens of thousands
[39:53.200 --> 40:01.520]  could have walked out from the super dome over the major high rise highways the upper decks
[40:02.160 --> 40:06.000]  but police were ordered to stand there with machine guns and later somewhere and died and
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.400]  went to prison for following orders which was wrong on both ends following the orders and
[40:10.400 --> 40:16.480]  then going to prison for it without those above them getting in trouble gunning down scores of
[40:16.480 --> 40:21.040]  people that tried to get out they said you'll stay in the super dome four days later food and
[40:21.040 --> 40:25.840]  water got in the police wouldn't go in and protect people they sat there at the cordon and let
[40:25.840 --> 40:30.800]  everything fall apart so FEMA could then say oh see we screwed up we need unlimited power and
[40:30.800 --> 40:35.920]  unlimited funding just like the banker bailout oh we screwed up give us unlimited money and power
[40:36.560 --> 40:38.480]  let us steal anything we want make it legal
[40:38.480 --> 40:50.080]  again this is the methodology that is used so government cannot and will not ever protect you
[40:53.360 --> 40:57.280]  now before i get into the giant bombshell revelation
[40:59.920 --> 41:04.240]  i want to set the stage with what's happening all over the world and i already knew this
[41:04.240 --> 41:09.840]  intellectually i'd already seen thousands of proofs of this i'd already read government manuals
[41:09.840 --> 41:15.120]  and documents and red department of education documents i'd already looked at un documents
[41:15.120 --> 41:19.520]  i'd seen what the un had done and scores of countries around the world over and over again
[41:19.520 --> 41:26.800]  and it's horrible 60 plus year history and then the last three years i've studied something called
[41:26.800 --> 41:36.560]  common purpose in scotland ireland and england the government pours billions of dollars a year
[41:36.560 --> 41:42.480]  into it it is the only major community group allowed to operate it's really a government front
[41:42.480 --> 41:49.920]  and that's come out all the major police chiefs all the new mayors almost all of anyone getting
[41:49.920 --> 41:55.600]  elected to any position in local government is common purpose if you try to stop start a small
[41:55.600 --> 42:01.040]  charity or a soup kitchen or an educational organization you get shut down unless you're
[42:01.040 --> 42:07.840]  common purpose and it's the same thing with big city community organizing funded by the
[42:07.840 --> 42:14.560]  ford rockefeller annenberg foundations that obama has worked for this is how they take
[42:14.560 --> 42:20.560]  over societies the local level where citizens can never get together citizens can never organize
[42:20.560 --> 42:26.720]  they can never get a good mayor elected they can never get funding for good candidates if you try in
[42:27.760 --> 42:34.640]  texas where i live or any other major city to do basic things to create basic organizations
[42:35.840 --> 42:41.280]  that are not extreme according to government's own definitions in any way you still get infiltrated
[42:41.280 --> 42:46.000]  you still get set up you still get brought down now so many people are standing up now
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.160]  they're having trouble shutting everybody down see when you all just get out there and do something
[42:50.160 --> 42:55.840]  even if it seems small putting flyers up on walls starting a land rights or second amendment group
[42:56.560 --> 43:01.200]  start a group investigating government corruption your area start a group that's cop watching
[43:03.040 --> 43:09.600]  it all annihilates them see they've trained the public to only watch tv only go to the ball games
[43:09.600 --> 43:13.440]  only go to the movies don't even talk to your neighbors just watch the glowing television at
[43:13.440 --> 43:17.760]  night that it's not your place to be involved that it's stupid to be involved that it's boring
[43:17.760 --> 43:22.960]  to be involved now as people try to go to citizen's communication and speak cities all over the
[43:22.960 --> 43:27.440]  country are banning or restricting citizen's communication because now people want to use it
[43:28.000 --> 43:33.200]  they don't even want you to be able to speak you've got to sue them and people are doing that
[43:33.840 --> 43:39.200]  in 2004 when they had the free speech zones and ban free speech thousands of lawsuits were
[43:39.200 --> 43:43.840]  lost in new york city now they've been forced to back off same thing in austin same thing in
[43:43.840 --> 43:52.640]  dallas same thing all over the country people stood up when they have the christmas tree displays
[43:52.640 --> 43:58.080]  no one protested those down on the lake down on the river in austin they call it a lake it's
[43:58.880 --> 44:06.400]  call it on a river ladybird lake they had big free speech signs up when my parents took my
[44:06.400 --> 44:14.160]  children to the trail of lights and to see the big christmas tree see they need to be sued for that
[44:14.160 --> 44:20.240]  you must fight them on every level resist them does it mean you'll win every suit no does it mean
[44:20.240 --> 44:31.920]  you'll win every time you run for office no but they can't stop everybody and they're scared
[44:31.920 --> 44:39.280]  and they don't want anybody being involved in any community activity we have over 2000 pages
[44:39.280 --> 44:47.040]  of 1971 congressionally declassified coantel pro fbi programs they were infiltrating mainline
[44:47.040 --> 44:52.080]  churches that tried to set up soup kitchens and shutting them down in detroit and la and san francisco
[44:52.640 --> 44:59.200]  and dallas texas they don't want anyone having community they want to break up the family
[44:59.200 --> 45:04.240]  money passed so high a taxes and regulations it shuts down all middle class where there's only
[45:04.240 --> 45:12.000]  mega corporations and the government that you work for they are threatened by common decency
[45:12.000 --> 45:17.040]  they've even taken over a good organization like meals on wheels where they're now tap them to spy
[45:17.040 --> 45:21.520]  on old people to send in elder care the equivalent of cps for old people
[45:24.400 --> 45:28.240]  and the soup kitchen people meals on wheels they mean well at the grassroots they don't
[45:28.240 --> 45:32.560]  understand that after they call elder care on them they come and grab the property and ship
[45:32.560 --> 45:40.160]  the old person off to a euthanasia center that's how diabolical this is they are taking over or
[45:40.160 --> 45:45.120]  have taken over anything of substance and if they can't take it over they shut it down
[45:48.000 --> 45:53.920]  i have seen this first hand and it's on record and the good news is people are waking up they
[45:53.920 --> 46:00.880]  want you living in a modern prison grid and the white house regulatory czar the person
[46:01.440 --> 46:08.400]  that interprets all of the laws remember john u one of the white house lawyers he did this similarly
[46:08.400 --> 46:14.640]  but in a less powerful position saying well we interpret the constitution as we can torture
[46:14.640 --> 46:19.920]  innocent people including crushing children's genitalia in front of their parents and he was
[46:19.920 --> 46:24.880]  asked in a cfr meeting do you agree with this you really wrote this he said yes the president is the
[46:24.880 --> 46:32.400]  law he is god basically now we have someone in a far more powerful position cast sunstein
[46:33.200 --> 46:37.760]  president obama's appointee to head the office of information regulatory affairs he's already in
[46:37.760 --> 46:52.320]  that position i've now had time to research him more and notice he says ban or arrest anyone that
[46:52.320 --> 46:58.880]  talks about 911 truth and we now learn he's one of the people a mentor of obama who actually got
[46:58.880 --> 47:04.560]  van jones kicked out as bad as van jones was admitting he was a communist van jones at least
[47:04.560 --> 47:08.800]  was a real community organizer at a certain level and did believe 911 was an inside job
[47:08.800 --> 47:16.960]  he had to be gotten rid of no cast sunstein he says if you criticize the government in any way
[47:18.080 --> 47:24.880]  you should be arrested we have the quotes he says if you say sunlight is good for you
[47:24.880 --> 47:29.920]  you should be arrested we have the quotes he uses the most broad thing he can that sounds
[47:29.920 --> 47:35.600]  ridiculous to set the psychological precedent that he makes the rules if he says the earth is
[47:35.600 --> 47:41.440]  flat it's flat it doesn't matter if thousands and thousands of studies by the most prestigious
[47:41.440 --> 47:49.200]  scientists and doctors and research facilities conclusively show that moderate sunlight is the
[47:49.200 --> 47:58.960]  engine of health to produce vitamin d in your body to create enzymes in the body that your eyes
[47:58.960 --> 48:03.440]  need to pick up a lot of sunlight or you get depressed i mean we're mint we're daytime creatures
[48:04.560 --> 48:11.280]  white people ice age man is white skin so we absorb the limited sunlight if you're on the
[48:11.280 --> 48:17.040]  equator your skin is black because you get too much of it if you're towards the north you get
[48:17.040 --> 48:24.480]  lighter and lighter because you need it we are designed light plants to get sun yeah you stick
[48:24.480 --> 48:31.040]  the wrong kind of plant out in pure sunlight it'll die that's a white person we're meant to be a little
[48:31.040 --> 48:38.320]  bit in the shade you take a black person out of sun for a few years they're going to get sickly
[48:38.320 --> 48:45.840]  and they're going to end up dying this is well known it's an absolute fact he says it's a conspiracy
[48:45.840 --> 48:52.320]  theory and is it a benchmark says ban that get rid of free speech at a bare minimum tax anything the
[48:52.320 --> 48:56.880]  government doesn't agree with and he's over the cyber security position he's over every federal
[48:56.880 --> 49:03.280]  agency interpreting laws and ladies and gentlemen we have now discovered video clips of him saying
[49:03.280 --> 49:10.560]  we will ban the second amendment there is no right to keep their arms and we have now confirmed
[49:10.560 --> 49:17.040]  that obama is going to tap him in the next year to replace ruth vader ginsberg he was the number
[49:17.040 --> 49:25.440]  two tap over sonia sota mayor last year and that he is in line and that he will be approved
[49:25.440 --> 49:30.480]  they'll probably try it this year they're talking about ruth vader ginsberg stepping down and a man

[54:25.280 --> 54:31.520]  he says there is no right to keep mere arms and that don't be surprised in the next three years

[54:49.040 --> 54:53.520]  that headline's not even strong enough i'm not criticizing it's just that we we we get accused
[54:53.520 --> 55:00.880]  of sensationalizing this is sensational we don't make it sensational enough he says he's a communist
[55:00.880 --> 55:05.920]  he says he wants to ban all hunting ban all second amendment he says you have no right he says
[55:05.920 --> 55:10.800]  he's going to ban free speech he's about to be a supreme court justice i mean that's pull your
[55:10.800 --> 55:19.280]  hair out crazy here he is on guns well in terms of judicial developments it is striking a noteworthy
[55:19.280 --> 55:26.560]  that well over two centuries since the founding the no the supreme court has never suggested
[55:26.560 --> 55:33.600]  that the second amendment protects an individual right to have guns not once it would be amazing
[55:33.600 --> 55:42.240]  though given that fact though uh though don't be surprised if the first time it happens is in the
[55:42.240 --> 55:47.840]  next three or four years the next three or four years and we'll play the full clip in context
[55:47.840 --> 55:51.840]  where he says there's no right historically he says it's all made up now notice he comes out of
[55:51.840 --> 55:59.040]  chicago law school in harvard up in chicago chicago university five years ago one of their professors
[55:59.040 --> 56:04.400]  got caught writing a fake history book saying the founders were against the second amendment
[56:04.400 --> 56:10.160]  and that only 10 of the public owned guns and that the revolution had nothing to do with the
[56:10.160 --> 56:17.360]  second amendment the british came at leccington and concord to take the rifles to take the muskets
[56:17.360 --> 56:24.480]  to take the powder to take the shot the ball i mean it's it's like saying george washington
[56:24.480 --> 56:28.960]  had nothing to do with the revolutionary war it's like saying moses had nothing to do with
[56:28.960 --> 56:34.960]  mount sinai it's like saying daffy duck has nothing to do with warner brothers or mickey
[56:34.960 --> 56:42.160]  mouse with disney or that trees aren't green that the sky isn't blue this guy just thinks he
[56:42.160 --> 56:47.840]  can sit up there with his twit fake intellectual voice and tell you there's no second amendment
[56:47.840 --> 56:56.000]  and he says that he wants to ban the second amendment it's unbelievable it's outrageous
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.960]  these people are revolutionaries they are anti-constitutionalists to the max
[57:06.960 --> 57:12.640]  they are mortal enemies of our constitution or republic we have to get angry we have to get
[57:12.640 --> 57:18.320]  focused we need him to be kicked out of the white house we need him to step down as the czar
[57:18.320 --> 57:23.200]  over all federal implementation of regulations and interpretation of law and we sure need to

[57:30.560 --> 57:34.400]  collapsing going to the hospital they're talking about her stepping down this year they'll probably
[57:34.400 --> 57:39.840]  do it this year while they still have the house and senate so they can ram her through ram him
[57:39.840 --> 57:45.600]  through when she leaves so they can get him appointed get him approved you understand how

[58:03.600 --> 58:08.800]  obama's new proposal to tax banks that'll be selectively done where they only tax their competition
[58:10.240 --> 58:15.680]  just like he did exemptions and executive orders last year where the executive paid a select bank
[58:15.680 --> 58:25.680]  stayed in it's all criminal looting these people are hardcore radicals if they could and they've

[1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:26.160]  who were asking the question she's with us for the next 30 minutes we're going to get her in
[1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:32.400]  studio in the next week or so when she's here in austin texas uh but by running she wins either way
[1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:38.320]  by injecting real issues just like ron paul at the national level in 2008 as we want to play some

[1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:55.920]  likes to act like he's a conservative so does k belly hutchinson but they've all been for the
[1:02:55.920 --> 1:03:02.320]  nafta highways hutchinson claims she isn't now uh she's a member of the builder bar group perry's
[1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:08.000]  been an attendee uh it didn't matter how many times the legislature voted to say no to toll roads
[1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:15.440]  he would always try to block it i mean you are the only choice for texas well i i think we talked
[1:03:15.440 --> 1:03:22.080]  about transportation and it really boils down to a disregard for private property ownership in texas
[1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:29.360]  uh transportation texas transportation institute text dot are holding texas drivers hostage to
[1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:37.520]  their agenda to um further that uh super quarter through our state and it's time that we have somebody
[1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:43.600]  who who will really stand up and lay the you know transparency put transparency out there audit
[1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:49.520]  text dot have accountability set the the bar for excellence in state service and clearly i think
[1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:54.000]  people saw last night neither kay or rick are going to do that debor why do you think you're
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:00.400]  getting so much positive press right now there have been a few hit pieces uh in the media saying
[1:04:00.400 --> 1:04:05.200]  oh she's against the new world order does it the media understand it's popular to be against the
[1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:10.960]  new world order now you know i'm not sure we had a great opportunity last night to talk with the
[1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:17.440]  press afterwards kay and rick um ran from that um you know kind of reinforcing the notion that they
[1:04:17.440 --> 1:04:23.840]  want to talk at texas but not listen to or engage with texas but i think my campaign staff was a
[1:04:23.840 --> 1:04:27.840]  little surprised that and our team a little surprised that we didn't get more questions than
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:34.720]  we did i think people were um pretty shocked by the the strength of the debate and the amount
[1:04:35.760 --> 1:04:40.400]  clearly i would like to talk a lot more about the issues than what we were able to but it was
[1:04:40.400 --> 1:04:45.120]  it was more substance than i think people were expecting and because all we got was bickering
[1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:50.640]  that's what i heard the callers saying on mainline talk radio was you were substance you were
[1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:55.680]  constitutional all they did was fight with each other and that's why you won the debate most people

[1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:18.160]  gcn radio network deborah medina is our guest ladies and gentlemen she's been in the first
[1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:23.680]  big republican debate hands down one in many newspapers are saying that the grass roots
[1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:29.440]  that i've been monitoring is conclusively saying that they want to know more about deborah medina
[1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:35.520]  but the first big issue we have an article at info wars dot com uh governor candidate deborah
[1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:42.160]  medina excluded from televised debate the next key debate coming up january 29th right before the
[1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:48.160]  key primary right before voters really make their decision and with your incredible showing
[1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:52.160]  last night your poll numbers going up even higher uh they need to put you in there but
[1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:56.880]  i've read that billow the big globalist corporation that owns a lot of the tv stations the dallas
[1:08:56.880 --> 1:09:01.600]  morning news they're saying not only do you have to have 15 percent you've got to be able
[1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:07.200]  in the past to have held a comparable political position so you should have been a u.s senator
[1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:12.640]  or a texas governor or lieutenant governor to be able to be on the same stage by that yardstick
[1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:18.320]  only super high powered politicians can be in debates i mean they're really as they see the
[1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:24.080]  revolution of awakening back to the constitution happening they are bringing out a new standard
[1:09:24.080 --> 1:09:28.560]  that no one can get over you can't just be a mayor you can't be a state representative
[1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:33.680]  and be in a debate now for governor you have to have been a former governor or u.s senator
[1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:39.680]  this is clearly discriminatory people need to boycott billow if they don't change this dump
[1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:44.320]  the dallas morning news they need to look at their past policies because they're doing a
[1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:48.960]  quasi public thing they're acting like it's a public debate but but but but really they're
[1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:54.720]  skewing it or people need to boycott this debate and call for other real debates deborah medina
[1:09:54.720 --> 1:10:00.720]  running for governor here in texas give us your breakdown on this well i think you know we've
[1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:07.600]  talked about this political royal class in america and this is more evidence that at least
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:13.920]  the political establishment and those that support them seem to have you know have an agenda to
[1:10:13.920 --> 1:10:19.680]  further that i hope that we'll use the free market to put pressure on billow or i know that
[1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:24.640]  their supporters out there talking with their advertisers and and and clearly making it known
[1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:29.280]  to them that they want this debate to happen in texas they want all three candidates to be heard
[1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:35.120]  from and we need another opportunity to uh to see all three of us on stage and allow the voter to
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:40.320]  make a choice in the next election so people can help us out by calling billow and letting them
[1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:44.880]  know about that but also by calling their advertisers and their support you know they're
[1:10:44.880 --> 1:10:50.640]  their customer base and letting them know and then help us out by visiting medina for texas.com
[1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:55.600]  and driving dollars our way so that we can buy the media and get out there that uh get the message
[1:10:55.600 --> 1:11:02.400]  out between now and march 2nd well deborah i mean looking at this it's so outrageous to read the
[1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:10.720]  policy the new policy of billow that you have to have 15 in the polls and on top of it uh
[1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:18.000]  uh you have to and and before it was 15 in the polls in the final debate between republicans
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:22.640]  and democrats and third parties and that was at the national level and they only brought that policy
[1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:27.760]  in the last eight years more restrictive than what was there previously but to now in a primary
[1:11:27.760 --> 1:11:35.600]  debate say not only do you have to have 15 you've got to hold comparable uh public status so you
[1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:40.480]  would have had to be a governor from another state or a u.s senator to be able to be on that stage
[1:11:40.480 --> 1:11:47.920]  that is an impossible hurdle that on its face is fraud i mean this is they must be scared to death
[1:11:47.920 --> 1:11:53.680]  of the grassroots and now they might just come right out and ban third parties or ban candidates
[1:11:53.680 --> 1:11:57.040]  from higher office if you weren't already in higher office i mean how will people
[1:11:57.040 --> 1:12:02.000]  get into higher office if you have to first be in the highest level of executive office i mean
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:07.280]  this isn't this is outrageous well and it's just totally ignoring even the candidacy you know
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:11.760]  the rest of the media all over texas and certainly the grassroots is abuzz with what happened in that
[1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:17.840]  debate last night and yet when you read the dallas morning news and their and their report of the
[1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:22.800]  debate that they kind of leave deborah medina house almost as though i wasn't on stage it's like
[1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:29.280]  were you even at the same debate the rest of texas was watching because uh to read their reports
[1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:35.040]  they they don't they don't address the deborah medina factor at all um and and i guess clearly
[1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:40.560]  that's where the establishment would like to see they don't want people rising up they want us
[1:12:40.560 --> 1:12:46.960]  to be worker bees serving that political class but not um out here producing on our own and being
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:54.560]  independent and enjoying the liberty that our founders you know put into that constitution i
[1:12:54.560 --> 1:12:59.760]  mean they they they set this nation up so that we can enjoy that freedom and prosperity that
[1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:06.560]  that's god given life liberty property that's not yours to give it was given to us by the creator
[1:13:06.560 --> 1:13:13.200]  it's yours to protect and preserve and the constitution gives us the way gives us the blueprint
[1:13:13.200 --> 1:13:17.760]  by which to do that and yet we've got just exactly what our founders knew we were going to have this
[1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:24.720]  abuse um by a tyrannical power political power well and we really are creating a royal class in
[1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:31.520]  america well perry's one talking point was that you and k bailey hutchinson hate texas and are
[1:13:31.520 --> 1:13:37.360]  saying texas is bad when you're trying to save what texas is it's perry that masquerades is a
[1:13:37.360 --> 1:13:42.560]  conservative and and k bailey hutchinson is even worse if that's possible uh from washington
[1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:49.360]  and they have brought in conservatively a 400 million dollar looting deal to grab 8 000 miles of
[1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:53.760]  existing roads and put toll roads on them they're both involved up to their eyeballs in it though
[1:13:53.760 --> 1:13:59.600]  they now try to deny that it's on record they are they are uh texas has passed all these new
[1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:04.720]  districts for taxing all every few months a new bureaucrat shows up and tells me about some new
[1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:10.800]  tax that my little office has to pay uh we are turning into california or new york or illinois
[1:14:11.440 --> 1:14:16.240]  or something texas does have people flooding to it because it's not as bad as other states but not
[1:14:16.240 --> 1:14:23.040]  for long i mean you're trying to save texas is a haven of low taxes and low regulation and we know
[1:14:23.040 --> 1:14:30.240]  what k bailey and uh you know mr hairspray pretty hair uh you know twinkle toes perry is gonna do
[1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:36.080]  and for him to try to spin it that that that that you're bad mouthing texas it's just more
[1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:42.160]  fraud from this guy the sales taxes keep going up uh the other the property taxes keep going up
[1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:47.920]  even as as housing prices go down uh can you speak to what you would do as governor to the tax system
[1:14:47.920 --> 1:14:53.600]  well we've got to eliminate property tax and eliminate we didn't have it before and built
[1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:58.640]  this country eliminated it's a it's a tax on your property it's rent you don't really own
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:02.320]  your property the founder said if you have a property tax we've got to eliminate property
[1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:06.800]  tax we've got to recognize that we do need some essential government services there are some
[1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:10.960]  things that cities and counties and the state government need to do and clearly they need
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:16.960]  funds for that but the best way to raise that money the the taxing method that causes the
[1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:22.400]  least drag on a free and prosperous economy is a sales tax we need to broaden the base
[1:15:22.400 --> 1:15:28.320]  of our sales tax uh raise the probably raise the rate of tax unless we decide to also tax
[1:15:28.320 --> 1:15:32.720]  property at the time of the sale in which case we can actually lower the rate but that's the
[1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:37.920]  thing that's going to generate the most uh economic activity spread the weight of the
[1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:45.200]  government burden i guess over over all citizens not unfairly stacking on property owners um
[1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:49.040]  we've got to do that but i think that the governor you know he'd like to paint this
[1:15:49.040 --> 1:15:53.760]  really rosy picture i guess as a registered nurse my job wasn't to look at how healthy i
[1:15:53.760 --> 1:15:58.880]  would like for you to be but to deal with the the reality of what's your clinical conditions
[1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:03.920]  and signs are and the reality of the economic condition here in tuxas isn't near as rosy
[1:16:03.920 --> 1:16:08.880]  as he'd like to paint it i certainly am not about tearing tuxas down i'm about being a
[1:16:08.880 --> 1:16:14.560]  you know a realist and looking at objectively where we are figuring out what's hindering us
[1:16:14.560 --> 1:16:18.480]  and getting us on the path to that freedom and prosperity that we ought to be enjoying
[1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:25.200]  harry was selling jobs in the product in the public sector and boasting about employment numbers
[1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:31.840]  going up that's that is a boldface lie you are creating more of a burden on the private sector
[1:16:31.840 --> 1:16:39.520]  we've added 156 000 jobs in the public sector in the last four years he's boasting about adding
[1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:45.600]  142 000 to the texas economy in the last four years but all of those have been in the public
[1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:52.480]  sector we've lost 14 000 jobs in the private sector that's not job growth absolutely so for
[1:16:52.480 --> 1:16:58.320]  those that don't understand texas is becoming like massachusetts or new york and perry saying and his
[1:16:58.320 --> 1:17:05.280]  double speak that's a great thing deborah medina is saying no go back the way texas was make texas
[1:17:05.280 --> 1:17:11.520]  great again they're trying to raise the texas gas tax they're trying to do everything right now
[1:17:12.080 --> 1:17:17.440]  we have got to block this i mean the economy is imploding in this state not as bad as other
[1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:23.600]  states because we haven't had the blight of big government as much as other states that's why people
[1:17:23.600 --> 1:17:29.440]  are running to texas right now running away from big government deborah i want to play a clip of you
[1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:34.960]  alex let me jump in not as bad as other states because they overtaxed us a few years ago
[1:17:34.960 --> 1:17:40.560]  remember he built up that rainy day fund at 20 billion dollars because he was overtaxing texas
[1:17:41.280 --> 1:17:45.920]  anybody that's got sitting on that kind of profit can weather a storm that's why texas is
[1:17:45.920 --> 1:17:50.640]  weathering the storm because the the governor and the legislature allowed those taxes to be
[1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:57.040]  over collected in prior years absolutely and most of them have their hands in the till now i want
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:02.720]  to play a clip of you confronting perry during the debate again you were always bringing up issues
[1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:07.120]  they were bringing up lots of feel good propaganda and having a cat fight between
[1:18:07.120 --> 1:18:14.160]  themselves the two ninnies here it is you were a democrat before you were a republican having
[1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:22.720]  worked for al gore as his campaign manager you've broken promises on education securing our border
[1:18:22.720 --> 1:18:29.040]  and property tax reform you failed to listen to texas on issues like the trans texas quarter
[1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:35.040]  what evidence can you give we texas that you'll keep your word this time around
[1:18:36.320 --> 1:18:42.560]  miss marina i made the same decision that ronald reagan made back in his life that the republican
[1:18:42.560 --> 1:18:48.480]  party was the party that i want to be associated with and i'm glad i did and i'm glad he did
[1:18:48.480 --> 1:18:54.000]  and i'm glad to be a part of the party that ronald reagan came to from the standpoint of
[1:18:54.720 --> 1:18:58.800]  putting our promises in place i promised that i would do everything that i could to make this
[1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:03.680]  state a place where people were proud to live and i think we've done that when you look at what we
[1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:08.080]  have created in the state over the last eight years when you look at walking into a budget
[1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:16.720]  deficit of ten billion dollars in 2003 cutting that budget reducing the taxes the tort reform that
[1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:21.040]  we passed i will tell you that doctors all across this state are really proud of what we've been
[1:19:21.040 --> 1:19:25.600]  able to do people are proud of to live in texas and live in a state that where they can keep more
[1:19:25.600 --> 1:19:32.080]  what they work for and i respond very briefly you know you talk about the great economic state
[1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:37.760]  that we're in but the reality is texas own consolidated annual financial reports shows
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:44.240]  under your leadership our debts tripled and per capita taxation has gone up 49 percent
[1:19:45.600 --> 1:19:52.080]  that's painting a rosy picture that doesn't exist texas are suffering because texas is
[1:19:52.080 --> 1:19:56.480]  marching right down the same path that california did if we don't change our course
[1:19:57.120 --> 1:20:03.040]  thank you find ourselves there it's been unbelievably good again she had actual government
[1:20:03.040 --> 1:20:08.320]  numbers something that these politicians never give the public she was giving you the real
[1:20:08.320 --> 1:20:13.200]  numbers incredible deborah medina that's why you need to be the next governor i think you and i read
[1:20:13.200 --> 1:20:18.560]  the texas consolidated annual financial report i'm not sure either kayer rick have ever looked at
[1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:25.200]  that you can't be an executive and not know what the financial condition of your organization is
[1:20:25.200 --> 1:20:31.840]  texas deserve an accurate honest annual financial report from our ceo that's the governor and he's
[1:20:31.840 --> 1:20:36.560]  failed to do that time and time again and he got upset when you brought that up because no one
[1:20:36.560 --> 1:20:40.480]  ten years ago when i first started exposing this with walter burrian made a film about it
[1:20:40.480 --> 1:20:46.640]  no one knew about these that's the real set of books not the budget the budget is the fake thing
[1:20:46.640 --> 1:20:52.880]  they push and then boy you broke a big taboo he got upset when you mentioned that little secret name
[1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:57.680]  well i'm gonna keep doing that in fact i carry it with me most everywhere i go and if they
[1:20:57.680 --> 1:21:03.840]  don't let me have some notes on stage last night i had in my hand um it is dog-eared and and being
[1:21:03.840 --> 1:21:08.320]  used up i'm waiting for the for the newest one to come out uh so that we can kind of look at
[1:21:08.320 --> 1:21:15.040]  where we are but certainly we've seen the assets of texas dwindle uh they have not been well managed
[1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:19.600]  and um we're going to keep reporting that to people i think we all know it intuitively we
[1:21:19.600 --> 1:21:25.120]  know something's not right here things are not economically as healthy as the governor um
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:31.120]  paints you know the picture that he paints we also ought to be pushing texas i've been pushing
[1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:36.480]  texas to call a special session and nullify health care but we also ought to be pushing the state
[1:21:36.480 --> 1:21:42.400]  government to cut spending right now we've we've seen tremendous declines in the sales tax revenues
[1:21:42.400 --> 1:21:46.640]  to the the amount of money that they predicted they would have to spend is not going to come in
[1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:52.560]  we already know we're how we're going to be facing a huge hole in 2011 economically and and that
[1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:57.200]  hole is going to be bigger because that revenue is not coming in everybody is hurting and when
[1:21:57.200 --> 1:22:02.240]  when we have to tighten our belts in the private sector the government needs to to be even ahead
[1:22:02.240 --> 1:22:08.160]  of that curve and be ranch ratcheting down uh and getting as lean and mean as they can be and we've
[1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:12.880]  just not seen that kind of responsiveness uh in the public sector here in texas we've got to push
[1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:17.280]  for that deborah shifting gears in the time we have left when we get you in studio for a full
[1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:23.840]  hour in the near future you're gracious enough to spend that time with us if if you could become
[1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:29.840]  governor and it it will then be a beacon to other states texas leads the nation california
[1:22:30.720 --> 1:22:37.440]  leads the nation and collapse texas leads the nation in revival uh historically financially as
[1:22:37.440 --> 1:22:43.760]  texas goes the rest the nation goes that's been said for over 60 years that if you can win in texas
[1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:50.320]  then in other gubernatorial races coming up other in the fetters true patriots true libertarians
[1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:56.480]  true constitutionalists will have even bigger shots that's why this race is so important
[1:22:56.480 --> 1:23:01.840]  to the rest of the country now because it's a bellwether and just briefly if you became governor
[1:23:01.840 --> 1:23:05.600]  you're saying and and other attorney generals are already saying this in other states
[1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:12.320]  is block the government takeover of health care block the nafta takeover uh really secure our
[1:23:12.320 --> 1:23:17.680]  border i mean governors have such incredible constitutional power briefly what will you do
[1:23:18.240 --> 1:23:24.960]  through texas on the national stage to block the the globalist takeover uh if you become governor
[1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:31.200]  well really gonna um start starting now talking to people about legislators about getting us the
[1:23:31.200 --> 1:23:35.680]  legislation we need to secure private property ownership but at the federal level boy we've
[1:23:35.680 --> 1:23:40.720]  got to stop health care not one not one bit of that new nationalization of federal health care
[1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:45.840]  ought to be coming into texas i think we're going to see cap and trade come at us through the epa
[1:23:45.840 --> 1:23:50.160]  i don't know that they're actually going to get the bill through uh the congress but the epa is
[1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:56.480]  going to try to implement that anyway it kills industry it kills all industry in texas we have
[1:23:56.480 --> 1:24:01.360]  got to get the attorney general fighting on the behalf of texas against the epa the governor ought
[1:24:01.360 --> 1:24:08.240]  to be interposing against the epa we have a texas at the tceq here in texas it's not maybe doing
[1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:12.800]  what it should and all that it should it's kind of been the puppet of the epa we need to relook
[1:24:12.800 --> 1:24:19.040]  at the role of that agency and say you know texas is going to take a critical look at where and if
[1:24:19.040 --> 1:24:22.560]  we need to be regulating industry and everywhere else we're going to get out we're not going to
[1:24:22.560 --> 1:24:29.360]  allow the epa to to set the tune that we dance to here push them out of that and let energy ag
[1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:34.560]  and other industry here in texas produce like it needs to that's going to that's going to send a
[1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:40.080]  real message all over the country and kind of restore to america that manufacturing base that
[1:24:40.080 --> 1:24:47.760]  we once had and allow people to get back to that healthy prosperous economy well you're an intelligent
[1:24:47.760 --> 1:24:53.440]  lady you're a constitutionalist people are really resonating with your message and i just want to
[1:24:53.440 --> 1:24:59.440]  say again regardless if you win or not we all win because you've now injected real issues
[1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:04.480]  and we're now growing the grassroots across the country just like with what happened with ron paul
[1:25:05.200 --> 1:25:10.640]  it is essential though that people support you they put your yard signs up that they call local
[1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:17.120]  radio that they call below and say put you in the next debate that they donate on your website
[1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:23.360]  or sign up at your facebook or get your email and text message alerts it is essential and and it's
[1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:29.360]  just the political will of getting involved will lead us to victory we know the path of standing
[1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:35.920]  up for freedom will win if people just keep going keep a coming and never back off and never stop
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:41.840]  in the last three four minutes we've got left deborah medina other issues other points you'd
[1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:46.320]  like to make to this worldwide audience well i think i've got a i've got to pick up with where
[1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:51.760]  you're going you're absolutely right alex this is pedal to the metal the only poll that counts
[1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:58.160]  is march the second that is texas independence day the dominos are falling our way if you ever
[1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:04.960]  thought that there was a time when your vote counted it is now you've got to get out you've
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:12.720]  got to do all you can to raise the identity of this campaign to help people know that there is
[1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:17.600]  someone carrying the voice of the people i am just that vessel carrying that message
[1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:22.880]  i'm honored to do it for texas i'm going to fight really hard but we have got to have your help
[1:26:22.880 --> 1:26:28.560]  we can win this race don't let up don't back off this is a sprint to the finish we're going to
[1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:35.200]  push really hard through till seven oh one p.m on march second and not let up a second before then
[1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:41.840]  medina for texas dot com help us that way get out knock on doors let your neighbors know ask
[1:26:41.840 --> 1:26:48.000]  them to vote and then make sure that they go vote so many people say oh yeah i'm all about that
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:54.320]  and then they get busy and they don't vote early voting starts in february uh very important that
[1:26:54.320 --> 1:27:00.720]  we turn out and vote at the polls uh don't be discouraged by any negative media reports that
[1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:06.400]  you might see i think we we kind of took everybody by surprise last night i expect in the next 48 to
[1:27:06.400 --> 1:27:11.600]  72 hours they'll get their their act together and they'll start putting the negative spin on this
[1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:16.720]  and trying to you know kind of trying to marginalize the campaign and and again say we're not going to
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:20.480]  have an impact on this race boy we're going to have an impact and we saw that last night there
[1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:25.280]  was a period and i know you know we've got a lot of problems with google but there was a period last
[1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:29.920]  night that we were the number one search on google and for several hours we were the number three
[1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:35.840]  search on google it went through not just texas but the country like a firestorm we can win this
[1:27:35.840 --> 1:27:42.720]  but it means all of us have got to dig in till march 2nd and work hard the people know we're
[1:27:42.720 --> 1:27:48.560]  being looted and being robbed 30 plus states are moving to declare sovereignty the media spins that
[1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:53.360]  and says it's a session no the states created the federal government they're saying no the federal
[1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:58.320]  government's controlled by offshore banks that's now public guidance on the verge of being indicted
[1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:08.800]  we now have this individual at the winehouse harvard professor cast sunstein is now the head
[1:28:08.800 --> 1:28:14.640]  of federal regulation saying that he wants to ban free speech and the second amendment i mean he's
[1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:22.240]  actually saying it on video on television and that he's the next guy set to be the next supreme
[1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:26.560]  court justice i mean this country is in deep trouble these people aren't playing games you know
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:31.120]  it's what caused the battle at the alamo we're you know they're they're essentially declaring
[1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:36.400]  the constitution null and void we've got a rule of law here we're just going to ignore it we ignore
[1:28:36.400 --> 1:28:41.120]  it we ignore it we ignore it that's when travis drill on in the sand and said you know we're not
[1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:46.880]  ignoring this you're not going to toss out the constitution and and name yourself dictator that's
[1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:54.080]  what's happening here people see it we will either fight today at the ballot box or our children will
[1:28:54.080 --> 1:28:59.440]  will shed blood to regain the freedoms that we've lost i think we know that i think all of texas
[1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:04.880]  knows that now's the time to dig in five and again let's go you're just saying when everybody
[1:29:04.880 --> 1:29:10.320]  already knows finally you're saying and i hear all these people calling into talk radio saying
[1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:14.720]  i want medina these other people are fakes i'm hearing democrats say i want medina not some
[1:29:14.720 --> 1:29:20.800]  establishment democrat who's an obama noid people know the two big parties are a fraud they know that

[1:32:53.920 --> 1:33:09.840]  dot com again that number one eight hundred four zero nine five six three three
[1:33:12.720 --> 1:33:21.920]  ladies and gentlemen it is friday the 15th day of january 2010 i am now going to cover
[1:33:21.920 --> 1:33:29.440]  one of the most important issues we have ever discussed on this radio broadcast
[1:33:35.760 --> 1:33:42.000]  when i say that over 90 percent of the time when i cover an issue it turns out it's worse
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  than i thought it's worse than we have said previously and that is certainly the case
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:55.360]  with barack obama and his zars as bad as bush was new world order stage terror attacks fake wars
[1:33:55.360 --> 1:34:03.120]  fake wmds patriot act obama has continued and expanded all of it and now the village voice
[1:34:03.120 --> 1:34:09.120]  and raw story and all the big liberal publications are admitting he's a monster but he's a monster
[1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:16.400]  because that's his job four times the wall street money that john mccain got not that john mccain
[1:34:16.400 --> 1:34:22.160]  would have been good obama was the heir apparent he was the corporate choice the globalist choice
[1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:30.960]  mccain would have been just as bad but obama was vetted he was chosen he engages in so many
[1:34:30.960 --> 1:34:35.920]  frauds that we cover in the obama deception that we cover in my other film from last year fall the
[1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:42.240]  republic i mean he lied about not hiring lobbyist all he hired was lobbyist he lied about saying
[1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:45.760]  he wouldn't do signing statements that are unconstitutional where he just writes the laws
[1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:50.000]  however he wants after congress passes him he swore he wouldn't do that he swore he'd have
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:54.640]  the most open government he swore he'd end the war in iraq immediately then it was 16 months
[1:34:54.640 --> 1:34:59.440]  and 20 months at five years he's increasing all these other wars he's expanding torture secret
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:06.480]  arrest he does little things like go i'm fighting against these bailouts of the banks when his
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:12.160]  people all passed him his people were in the private sector and and government running it with bush
[1:35:12.160 --> 1:35:17.680]  they hand the baton off to him then he says i've signed an executive order uh stopping executive
[1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:24.480]  pay and uh stopping bonuses to aig goldman sacks jp morgan city bank and others and then if you
[1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:30.800]  read the executive order it said they can have unlimited and the regulators from goldman sacks
[1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:36.880]  that run the government regulation at the sec they get to shut down bonuses to small banks
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:42.400]  and credit unions and they get to come in with regulators and take over banks like wahoo that
[1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:48.720]  were healthy they have a license to steal other banks insurance companies to take over whatever
[1:35:48.720 --> 1:35:56.160]  they want and his new tax on banks i've read his proposal it's a selective tax that his regulators
[1:35:56.160 --> 1:36:02.800]  all jp morgan and goldman sacks former employees that's all they are they pass bailout money and
[1:36:02.800 --> 1:36:08.480]  give it to themselves under bush they continue it under obama and give it to themselves i mean
[1:36:08.480 --> 1:36:16.080]  it's just unbelievable magnitude of fraud and yeah you thought bush was bad tripling the size of
[1:36:16.080 --> 1:36:21.760]  government in eight years in less than one year in office he hasn't even been in office a year
[1:36:22.480 --> 1:36:28.400]  eight months in is when we pass the rubicon more money we're now 11 and a half months in
[1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:35.200]  again within eight months of being in office he had spent more money than all presidents
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:43.120]  from george w bush to george washington before him and that's an official number 12 trillion
[1:36:43.680 --> 1:36:51.200]  dollars with interest on top of it that's not even calculated without interest more than
[1:36:51.200 --> 1:36:55.520]  all presidents before him combined and he said he was going to balance the budget and cut spending
[1:36:55.520 --> 1:37:00.960]  and he's still saying i'm cutting spending and balancing the budget that's like hacking someone's
[1:37:00.960 --> 1:37:04.800]  arms and legs off with a hatchet and telling him you're going to help him not bleed to death
[1:37:06.400 --> 1:37:09.520]  now he's hacked the arms and legs off he just chopped the head off and
[1:37:09.520 --> 1:37:15.600]  blood's the final blood spraying out and he's saying i'm helping you i mean it is just unbelievable
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:27.440]  the level of brazen hootspa or whatever arrogance a plum in your face uh hubris imperial insane
[1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:34.160]  megalomania but remember he's just a frontman a harvard lawyer reading off a teleprompter
[1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:41.600]  it's the banks and the offshore corporations that are doing this now i didn't drop the ball but
[1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:47.920]  i just want to point out for new listeners if you think we're exaggerating it's almost always
[1:37:49.040 --> 1:37:49.920]  worse than i think
[1:37:53.280 --> 1:37:59.360]  every czar i look at because i've only looked at a few in depth last night i started randomly
[1:37:59.360 --> 1:38:04.560]  looking at all his other czars every one of them has declared themselves in books they've written
[1:38:04.560 --> 1:38:13.520]  or white papers in recent times that they are marxist linonist Maoist i mean that folks Mao killed
[1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:23.120]  60 plus million people i i mean they openly say they're communist every stinkin one of them
[1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:31.760]  every one of them his diversity czar uh his office of information regulatory affairs czar
[1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:36.160]  his community organizing czars i spent hour after hour last night i couldn't believe it was
[1:38:36.160 --> 1:38:40.080]  worse than i even thought every one of them saying there's no second amendment they will
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:44.640]  completely take your guns every one of them saying they want to ban free speech clip after
[1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:49.680]  clip of them saying we want to do what hugo chavez has done and ban all media we don't agree with

[1:43:00.240 --> 1:43:05.520]  it is one thing to read his harvard and his chicago law school papers written a year and a half ago
[1:43:05.520 --> 1:43:14.640]  calling for this this guy now interprets and runs all executive enforcement of law member john you
[1:43:15.760 --> 1:43:20.080]  one of the white house lawyers saying we can bury someone alive pull their fingernails out
[1:43:20.080 --> 1:43:23.600]  or crush a child's genitals in front of their parents he wrote that in a white house memo
[1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:29.680]  and then the council on farm relations was even freaked out by one of the members professor castle

[1:43:59.840 --> 1:44:04.480]  most popular people they tap of someone who worked there out of law school he worked for third good
[1:44:04.480 --> 1:44:12.400]  marshal this is the man that they tapped at first and then they picked sonia sotomayor but he's next

[1:44:19.520 --> 1:44:24.000]  ram him through the house and senate they will get him approved in the senate that's where they do
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:31.760]  that and we will be stuck with a man who is engaged in criminal high treason as a citizen
[1:44:31.760 --> 1:44:36.480]  you can say there's no right to keep their arms and we need to ban them but you can't be in a
[1:44:36.480 --> 1:44:40.880]  government position and call for that that is treason and you can't be in a government position
[1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:46.000]  and call for arresting people for their free speech and you can't be a private citizen
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:51.040]  and say we need to infiltrate peaceful groups and try to get them to commit act of violence
[1:44:51.040 --> 1:44:55.040]  so we can break up their political movements and he says all that
[1:44:56.880 --> 1:45:06.160]  in his harvard paper written by university chicago law school and harvard university law school
[1:45:06.160 --> 1:45:13.360]  look at it read it don't watch the stinking playoffs this sunday if you care about your future
[1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:15.360]  you better make time to read this

[1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:32.000]  record to go in and loot and rob the middle class the same banks funded the russians in the early
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:36.640]  1990s to set up six oligarchs to rob the country we know who these people are
[1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:44.320]  they're george soros rockefeller roth child funded on record they openly want to ban your free
[1:45:44.320 --> 1:45:51.280]  speech read it he says if you criticize the government in any way and differ from anything
[1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:58.560]  that is government policy you are to be arrested or at the bare minimum newspapers that publish
[1:45:58.560 --> 1:46:02.960]  things seek for little people they want to arrest us for big newspapers and publications he says a
[1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:09.520]  special discriminatory tax against you we have all the quotes boiled down in paul watson's article
[1:46:09.520 --> 1:46:18.400]  from yesterday obama informations are outlined outlined plan for government to infiltrate
[1:46:18.400 --> 1:46:24.080]  conspiracy groups sunstein called for co entail pro style effort to silence truth using army of
[1:46:24.080 --> 1:46:30.720]  hired provocateurs here's another one obama informations are calls for banning free speech
[1:46:30.720 --> 1:46:35.840]  now we've actually read the document and our articles are the most damning but you can go
[1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:40.960]  to the village voice to raw story to all these big liberal publications they have headlines like
[1:46:40.960 --> 1:46:48.000]  got fascism and they point out how illegal this is now look i have read the thousands of pages
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:56.800]  over the years of the co entail pro documents and if you don't know what co entail pro is
[1:46:56.800 --> 1:47:01.120]  you need to just google the term and go to encyclopedia britannica it's where the fbi
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:06.160]  and federal government took over state police namely and infiltrated mainline extreme you
[1:47:06.160 --> 1:47:11.520]  name it churches any community groups any soup kitchens anybody that tried to create local
[1:47:11.520 --> 1:47:18.000]  community the feds don't want that they want collapse of society for dependence and they have the same
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:25.040]  system under common purpose in england and cast sunstein says we're doing this he says we'll go
[1:47:25.040 --> 1:47:29.920]  on the web we'll pose as conspiracy theorist that's anybody that questions any official government
[1:47:29.920 --> 1:47:36.480]  dogma because people don't trust the government anymore or even the government's experts so we
[1:47:36.480 --> 1:47:41.360]  need to secretly hire experts to go on tv he mentions like popular mechanics which is run
[1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:47.280]  by churdoff's nephew that's right former head of homeland security making all this money off
[1:47:47.280 --> 1:47:55.280]  the naked body scanners and he goes on to say that we will go in there and call for violence
[1:47:55.280 --> 1:48:00.400]  to run off and break up the groups because these people are pacifist and we know pacifism is the
[1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:04.400]  most effective against us is what he said and he said that we'll try to get others to do things
[1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:09.120]  illegal so we can arrest them now that's illegal that's more than entrapment that's provocaturing
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:16.400]  and it's illegal can you imagine someone set to be the next supreme court justice who openly
[1:48:17.120 --> 1:48:23.200]  says on television that he wants to restrict the second amendment there's no right to keep
[1:48:23.200 --> 1:48:28.080]  bare arms and that soon the courts will rule in the next three years to overthrow the second
[1:48:28.080 --> 1:48:29.920]  amendment i played that clip earlier
[1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:41.760]  can you imagine someone that says there's no right to free speech can you imagine
[1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:49.840]  that's who the government that's who wall street wants and why do they get rid of van
[1:48:49.840 --> 1:48:54.800]  jones he was bad on a lot of fronts but he was against government sponsored terror and signed
[1:48:54.800 --> 1:49:02.080]  a petition for 911 truth this guy says arrest someone if they talk about 911 truth he says that
[1:49:02.080 --> 1:49:11.920]  should be illegal he's an establishment person that's why you're not going to hear much from
[1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:17.200]  fox news about getting rid of him we need to push this story out into the open make it a big issue
[1:49:17.200 --> 1:49:23.120]  but hell they're keeping white house science are john p holder who wrote the 1100 page book eco
[1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:27.680]  science calling for poisoning the water supply to sterilize the public and who calls for a quote

[1:54:27.200 --> 1:54:33.680]  yeah we're wise to you you fool me with your kisses now when everybody to listen to me very
[1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:40.160]  very carefully because i'm going to lay out the enemy's battle plan why do you think in europe
[1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:47.840]  and the united states masses of poor immigrants have been brought in and paid to be brought in
[1:54:47.840 --> 1:54:53.360]  in many cases by the government why do you think in minnesota they brought in more than a million
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:59.120]  people in just the last decade in minnesota alone the government pays to fly them there
[1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:05.760]  because then the government gets them on welfare keeps them as basically kept political slaves
[1:55:05.760 --> 1:55:11.520]  who will then vote for gun control vote for open borders vote for restrictions in free speech
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:16.400]  for tiny little payoffs and they tell them oh you're gonna get free health care then they raise
[1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:21.360]  everybody's taxes cut everybody's health care they even rip off the slaves the slaves don't
[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:25.920]  know that though they come from countries of enslavement they don't know any better
[1:55:26.960 --> 1:55:31.840]  they didn't have george washington to set things up that's why the system demonizes
[1:55:31.840 --> 1:55:35.840]  this country because it's been the best it's not perfect but heads above everything else
[1:55:36.480 --> 1:55:42.400]  heads and shoulders mountains above many so they're bringing them in here and when you
[1:55:42.400 --> 1:55:46.640]  read what these people write they go very soon we're going to be basically half foreigner
[1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:50.000]  and there's nothing the middle class can do we're going to take over and arrest them
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:57.360]  they actually do want folks think about it every one of these zars says we are going to ban your
[1:55:57.360 --> 1:56:02.320]  guns they introduce the bills where the attorney general can ban any and all guns he wants to
[1:56:02.320 --> 1:56:07.680]  himself they have you're on a no fly you're on a no buy all of this stuff then they say we don't
[1:56:07.680 --> 1:56:11.760]  know why people are saying we want your guns we don't know why there's record purchases of guns
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:16.960]  because people actually went and read the bills but see cast sunsteen in his conspiracy theory
[1:56:16.960 --> 1:56:22.800]  papers and reports says if people think there's a move to get their guns it's a conspiracy but
[1:56:22.800 --> 1:56:28.720]  i do want to ban them see it's a mental game he plays where he's god you're the child and he

[2:09:16.480 --> 2:09:23.360]  calls for coantel pro coantel pro is illegal it's illegal to go start groups and lead them to violence
[2:09:23.360 --> 2:09:29.600]  to blame it on conservatives or libertarians or peace groups it's illegal it was found to be legal
[2:09:29.600 --> 2:09:36.640]  in congress and in the courts in the 1970s and 80s i've got it all right here coantel pro
[2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:42.800]  according to the fbi records 85 percent of coantel pro resources were expended on infiltrating

[2:09:50.240 --> 2:09:54.080]  it included the fbi putting out stories about martin leuther king which were proven to be
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:10:00.080]  lies about him whoremongering they attack groups by saying oh the leaders making too much money
[2:10:00.080 --> 2:10:04.400]  or they attack groups that are effective by saying the leaders are racist or they attack
[2:10:04.400 --> 2:10:08.480]  groups by turning people inside their organizations against each other or getting people hired into
[2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:14.320]  the organizations to commit crimes or they create other alternative media groups and then have them
[2:10:14.320 --> 2:10:21.200]  attack and he talks about how to do that how they go out and how they masquerade as us
[2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:26.880]  to then demonize the patriot movement anybody that's against government corruption and and
[2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:33.120]  even more importantly he says we will ban conspiracy theories and that means any criticism of
[2:10:33.120 --> 2:10:38.800]  government he defines conspiracy theories like global warming not being real or thinking the
[2:10:38.800 --> 2:10:43.920]  banks are corrupt or questioning the official story of 9 11 which farmer the head of the 9 11
[2:10:43.920 --> 2:10:50.720]  commission lawyers says is a cover up and six of the 10 members say that they get to define reality
[2:10:50.720 --> 2:11:00.160]  they get to say 2 plus 2 equals 50 not 2 plus 2 equals 4 he says it will be an outlawed conspiracy
[2:11:00.160 --> 2:11:04.080]  theory you've got to read this for yourself folks this is published by harvard and chicago law school
[2:11:04.080 --> 2:11:10.480]  written by him he says it is an outrageous conspiracy theory to say that sunlight is good
[2:11:10.480 --> 2:11:17.280]  for you this will be banned when every major study shows you need at least some sunlight i mean but
[2:11:17.280 --> 2:11:22.000]  even if it wasn't true it's your right to say it and he says we'll put a tax on talk radio on the
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:26.480]  internet and people we don't like to begin with and then outright ban them i mean ladies and gentlemen
[2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:32.640]  we've written five articles on it sunstein attacks second amendment info wars dot com with links to
[2:11:32.640 --> 2:11:38.160]  videos and his own writings obama informations are calls for banning free speech obama informations
[2:11:38.160 --> 2:11:43.440]  are outlined planned for government infiltrate conspiracy groups and the most of all the important
[2:11:43.440 --> 2:11:50.400]  things one of the most important is he says these people are incredibly effective conspiracy groups
[2:11:50.400 --> 2:11:55.280]  people that say the government's corrupt these these people that say there's a world government
[2:11:55.280 --> 2:12:00.240]  are very effective and they're undermining our takeover so we need to arrest them we need to
[2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:06.000]  infiltrate them but he admits that we are powerful and that the truth is powerful and that they're
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:09.920]  in deep trouble and then i went and looked and i already looked at a bunch of them every czar
[2:12:09.920 --> 2:12:16.480]  saying malsey tongue is good every czar saying we need to ban free speech like chavez has done
[2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:23.200]  his diversity czar had said that i mean these people are outrageous that's why the white house
[2:12:23.200 --> 2:12:28.960]  got rid of van jones not because of all the heat on him saying he was a communist but because he said
[2:12:28.960 --> 2:12:34.960]  911 might be an inside job he had some soul to tell the truth they didn't get rid of the white
[2:12:34.960 --> 2:12:39.440]  house science czar who called for forced sterilization of the public through the water supply
[2:12:39.440 --> 2:12:46.240]  and a planetary dictatorship to carry it out eco science mainstream news associated press fox news
[2:12:46.240 --> 2:12:53.280]  news no they got rid of jones because he was at some level a real activist even if i disagree
[2:12:53.280 --> 2:12:59.040]  with his politics for the rest of the hour bob Chapman normally joins us army intelligence
[2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:03.760]  fought the communist with the biggest private silver and gold broker ever lived south africa
[2:13:03.760 --> 2:13:11.680]  france germany all over the world expert on the economy i get him on about that but he
[2:13:11.680 --> 2:13:17.200]  also is an expert on these people and fighting for 45 years bob i had read articles months ago
[2:13:17.200 --> 2:13:21.600]  about sunstein in the in mainstream news saying oh he does want to restrict the internet is that
[2:13:21.600 --> 2:13:26.640]  fair like it's mainstream and okay i hadn't actually read or watched the videos of him
[2:13:26.640 --> 2:13:31.760]  and watching it and then when i put the name czar in i found a bunch of other clips you know i'd
[2:13:31.760 --> 2:13:37.520]  put in obama czar calls for banning guns and i'd find six seven eight others are saying it i mean
[2:13:37.520 --> 2:13:42.800]  this is worse than i thought bob Chapman these people are arrogantly and openly out in the
[2:13:42.800 --> 2:13:48.480]  open saying if you say anything we disagree with we are going to arrest you and we are going to
[2:13:48.480 --> 2:13:55.520]  take your guns i mean it's incredible bob you're right and uh they finally have totally come into
[2:13:55.520 --> 2:14:03.200]  the open and so evidently over the next year or so or perhaps two uh they're going to attempt to
[2:14:03.200 --> 2:14:10.640]  get people's guns and i think how they're going to do it is by joining and with the u n and uh
[2:14:10.640 --> 2:14:16.960]  using the u n excuse to go and collect everybody's the treaty yeah that's associated press obama
[2:14:16.960 --> 2:14:21.680]  says he's going to sign the treaty and even if the senate doesn't ratify it the the u n treaty
[2:14:21.680 --> 2:14:28.960]  says no private ownership of guns i mean it's really happening well you know this infiltration
[2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:39.280]  business um it's been going on for years uh i ran into it starting in 1965 and i actually had a friend
[2:14:39.280 --> 2:14:49.680]  of mine who was working in a in a store and he was also a uh a uh a person who was an expert in
[2:14:49.680 --> 2:14:58.720]  weapons and uh he was a person who fixed them as well and uh he got a visit one day from the
[2:14:58.720 --> 2:15:09.520]  fbi and the um batf and they said that if he didn't cooperate with them uh they were going to put
[2:15:09.520 --> 2:15:17.840]  him in jail and trying to put me in jail and because i was outspoken and so they have been doing this
[2:15:17.840 --> 2:15:23.680]  sort of thing for years and years they've been infiltrating groups for years it's not only the
[2:15:23.680 --> 2:15:30.720]  federal government but the federal government like with the fbi would go to local police departments
[2:15:31.280 --> 2:15:38.400]  and recruit them yeah mainly state police well yeah with state police but they went into the local
[2:15:38.400 --> 2:15:45.120]  level and i've discussed this with either the los angeles for a long time with the la pd because
[2:15:45.120 --> 2:15:51.440]  i used to shoot with a lot of those people and uh also uh with someone who was second in command
[2:15:51.440 --> 2:15:57.600]  there who went to take over the beveley hills police department who was an extra neighbor of mine
[2:15:57.600 --> 2:16:04.960]  eventually and so uh he told me exactly what they were doing and so it's really nothing new it's just
[2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:09.760]  that they've been doing it illegally for years and now these people have come out and said the game's
[2:16:09.760 --> 2:16:14.640]  over for you uh you can't speak about the government against the government or question the government
[2:16:14.640 --> 2:16:21.280]  anymore and we're going to come and get your guns and so i think people have got to decide uh
[2:16:21.280 --> 2:16:27.280]  and make plans for what they're going to do and the these eventualities well that's the nail on the
[2:16:27.280 --> 2:16:33.920]  head is that it came out in congress people went to jail coantel pro is illegal and then you have
[2:16:33.920 --> 2:16:41.600]  the white house head of information and regulatory affairs who implements all this executive bureaucracy
[2:16:41.600 --> 2:16:48.480]  he decides what they can do and he's saying we're doing this he's openly calling for committing
[2:16:48.480 --> 2:16:53.360]  crimes that's the difference why would they arrogantly come out in the open is this a
[2:16:53.360 --> 2:16:58.160]  public threat or a way to legitimize it with all their minions who go is this really legal
[2:16:59.600 --> 2:17:05.440]  well i think it's a threat uh this is a threat especially when you have that many people saying
[2:17:05.440 --> 2:17:11.200]  relatively the same thing they're saying we're going to come and get you uh this is the male
[2:17:11.200 --> 2:17:20.240]  mentality and uh you know i what do you say to that i mean how many groups are there in the
[2:17:20.240 --> 2:17:28.960]  united states who get together and and our militia or shoot or whatever and uh you know there's not
[2:17:28.960 --> 2:17:37.200]  that many people who do that you know i it could be a smoke screen as well to make the people who
[2:17:37.200 --> 2:17:44.080]  would vote for them to keep them in office they're appealing to people who don't want people to have
[2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:52.080]  guns you also have to consider to maybe the blatancy that you're seeing right now is a follow-up to
[2:17:52.080 --> 2:17:58.720]  the plunge in approval of the president which is running somewhere between 35 and 40 depending
[2:17:58.720 --> 2:18:05.200]  upon which subject that you choose well what about how he goes on bob to say and i'm going to find
[2:18:05.200 --> 2:18:09.200]  the quote here in a moment i read it several times yesterday he says these people are very effective
[2:18:09.200 --> 2:18:15.200]  they're taking over they threaten us and he doesn't just say gun owners he says anyone criticizing
[2:18:15.200 --> 2:18:21.200]  government including if you say sunlight is good for you that will be illegal i mean that is cuckoo
[2:18:21.200 --> 2:18:27.200]  i mean he's saying i am god you cannot have any alternative opinion of what we say or you're
[2:18:27.200 --> 2:18:35.200]  arrested well he's talking about you and i and people like us and uh quite frankly alex we've
[2:18:35.200 --> 2:18:41.200]  talked about the success that we've had and we've got the conspiracy running all over the place trying
[2:18:41.200 --> 2:18:47.200]  to find out what to do next because we've got them on the run and that probably prompted some of these
[2:18:47.200 --> 2:18:53.200]  recent statements as well we've been very very effective and uh what will they try to do we
[2:18:53.200 --> 2:18:59.200]  don't know yet but i don't i don't know that the people are going to sit still for it
[2:18:59.200 --> 2:19:05.200]  well bob there's something psychological going on here because i see it over and over again he says
[2:19:05.200 --> 2:19:09.200]  there's no such thing as a global government if you say that you'll be arrested when it's all over
[2:19:09.200 --> 2:19:15.200]  the news they're establishing world government so he knows it's all going on he's pushing it but he's
[2:19:15.200 --> 2:19:21.200]  just saying look you don't see anything like the mafia says or you're going to sleep with the fishes
[2:19:21.200 --> 2:19:28.000]  he's saying you do what we say and he picked something like the conspiracy theory that sunlight's
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:36.480]  good for you to just make it asininely broad mm-hmm that's right so they can do anything they want
[2:19:37.840 --> 2:19:43.360]  but i think there i mean i think there is some megalomania mental illness here though i mean to
[2:19:43.360 --> 2:19:48.640]  have them openly praising mal openly praising arresting us i mean i mean these guys really
[2:19:48.640 --> 2:19:53.120]  must think they're invincible but then he goes on to admit they're in trouble i guess it's like
[2:19:53.120 --> 2:19:58.560]  cockroaches when you poison your house and before they die they all start fornicating we'll be right

[2:23:58.560 --> 2:24:08.560]  and body extract today it's clear that the establishment wanted to use the backlash against
[2:24:08.560 --> 2:24:13.280]  bush who was only carrying out the globalist policy to bring in their new puppet to build him
[2:24:13.280 --> 2:24:19.600]  up as a messianic leader obama he has now fallen faster than any president ever in the approval
[2:24:19.600 --> 2:24:25.040]  rating mainstream news says about 40 a lot of the other poll show 35 as bob Chapman mentioned
[2:24:25.040 --> 2:24:29.840]  so they really wanted to come in with a type of red terror with the banks using their communists
[2:24:29.840 --> 2:24:35.600]  as they always do to loot and rob everybody during the crisis they created but now clearly
[2:24:35.600 --> 2:24:40.000]  they're freaked out clearly on every front they may not even pass their health care now
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:45.120]  that's in deep trouble the democrats are in a huge exodus they know it's political suicide but the
[2:24:45.120 --> 2:24:50.960]  banks are demanding this new tax the liberals have found out it's all a robbery there we are
[2:24:50.960 --> 2:24:55.600]  routing them right now so yeah they are blustering saying okay we're going to take your guns we're
[2:24:55.600 --> 2:24:59.760]  going to arrest you but this is what he was saying in white papers for the white house
[2:25:00.800 --> 2:25:04.960]  i don't even know if it was meant for public but it's in mainstream news that that they're all
[2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:12.400]  saying this i see the biggest problem bob as they brought in all these illegal aliens as their
[2:25:12.400 --> 2:25:17.360]  clients in europe in the u.s to pull the lever to vote for this and so they think they're going to
[2:25:17.360 --> 2:25:24.880]  win still long term what do we do educate the populations they brought in no i don't think
[2:25:24.880 --> 2:25:33.600]  that's possible um most of them are are people who have don't have beyond sixth grade educations
[2:25:34.480 --> 2:25:41.600]  and i i don't think that's easily doable um i i think when they would get into a difficult
[2:25:41.600 --> 2:25:48.800]  economic situation uh that you might be able to appeal to them just on a common sense basis
[2:25:49.840 --> 2:25:56.640]  but that's that's a hard thing to do we got to keep on trying to get at the mainstream american
[2:25:58.080 --> 2:26:03.680]  who see things going on and doesn't have an explanation and we've got the explanation
[2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:11.280]  for him which is reasonable and truthful and you know they're stalling for time um the longer they
[2:26:11.280 --> 2:26:17.520]  stall the better it is for us because it gives us the opportunity to try to accomplish what we've
[2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:25.760]  been accomplishing i think you know i hate to hear what he had to say but i'm glad to hear
[2:26:25.760 --> 2:26:29.040]  we're pushing them right to the edge they are running around in circles
[2:26:29.040 --> 2:26:36.560]  but again they now admit mainstream news i printed several articles today that he's the guy tapped
[2:26:36.560 --> 2:26:41.360]  that's why they moved him into the white house uh to be the next supreme court justice when
[2:26:41.360 --> 2:26:46.800]  ginsburg leaves i mean how could you have someone for supreme court who openly says
[2:26:46.800 --> 2:26:53.520]  ban free speech he actually says let me read quotes government might ban conspiracy theories
[2:26:54.480 --> 2:26:58.960]  that's a quote government might impose some kind of tax financial or otherwise on those
[2:26:58.960 --> 2:27:04.080]  who disseminate such theories then he lists them as global warming is a deliberate fraud
[2:27:04.080 --> 2:27:10.160]  illegal uh as saying there's a plan to get our guns while he separately gives speeches saying
[2:27:10.160 --> 2:27:18.480]  they are going to ban him desperate people do desperate things it's a counterattack
[2:27:19.680 --> 2:27:24.480]  and it's not going to work unless they try to implement them and then they'll have to deal with
[2:27:24.480 --> 2:27:30.720]  the public uh the longer it takes them to implement them the better is for us to get we get because
[2:27:30.720 --> 2:27:36.720]  we get more time to educate people bob even has been an educational process bob you've been fighting
[2:27:36.720 --> 2:27:43.760]  this for 45 years i've been fighting it for 16 years 14 plus on air but just as a red-blooded
[2:27:43.760 --> 2:27:48.560]  human who wants freedom when i see people openly praising mal and saying they're gonna take my
[2:27:48.560 --> 2:27:55.040]  guns and saying we're gonna ban my free speech i mean i literally have been in a super aggressive
[2:27:55.040 --> 2:27:59.840]  mood the last day and a half hopping around the office barely controlling myself punching holes
[2:27:59.840 --> 2:28:05.120]  in walls i'm not even really angry i'm just in absolute war mode where i i mean you know what
[2:28:05.120 --> 2:28:10.800]  i'm talking about i mean i know a threat of a bunch of dirty scum openly calling for criminal
[2:28:10.800 --> 2:28:16.320]  co-intel pro to infiltrate my office and set me up and send me to prison i mean this little piece
[2:28:16.320 --> 2:28:23.360]  of crap needs to be arrested not in the white house running all federal laws well you're right
[2:28:23.360 --> 2:28:30.160]  and in but how do we bring that about i just can't look at his picture i just can't look at me
[2:28:31.600 --> 2:28:37.200]  we can we can try to get the right people in congress maybe they'll stop it it's their only
[2:28:37.200 --> 2:28:41.600]  legal avenue i mean they don't care whether they break the law they make the law they don't care
[2:28:41.600 --> 2:28:46.240]  about the constitution they do what they feel like doing and that's you know what you've said
[2:28:46.800 --> 2:28:53.200]  throughout the program is a perfect example of that and so we're gonna have to try to work
[2:28:53.200 --> 2:28:58.400]  through the system which we are and have been and if it doesn't work well then we'll have to use
[2:28:58.400 --> 2:29:06.160]  something else what is the bully psychology of flaunting that they're in charge and they're
[2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:11.840]  gonna take our rights and openly throwing it out and announcing it and then always denying it
[2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:20.160]  separately what what is the point of that well me it's psychopathic is what it is because they
[2:29:20.160 --> 2:29:29.360]  just don't care i just landed the free home of the brave with a bunch of people saying they're
[2:29:29.360 --> 2:29:34.480]  communists who work for offshore banks robbing everything saying we're bad because we want
[2:29:34.480 --> 2:29:40.720]  free speech in the second amendment open and he's going to be our next supreme court justice
[2:29:40.720 --> 2:29:45.840]  probably unless we stop him bob let's uh continue want to play some video clips audio clips of him
[2:29:45.840 --> 2:29:48.640]  and then get into some other issues with bob shaman i'm alex jones

[2:33:18.240 --> 2:33:24.480]  is still coming here but chris mathews has chickened out i mean even with a taped interview i didn't
[2:33:24.480 --> 2:33:28.640]  approach them i don't care about being on this show i already took it over for an hour in denver

[2:33:37.520 --> 2:33:45.840]  broadcasting live and just take it over like i did herald over the vera again um then they
[2:33:45.840 --> 2:33:49.920]  tried to bait and switch and say oh well now he's gonna come to houston will you come to houston i
[2:33:49.920 --> 2:33:56.880]  said no we want to come here that's fine and then oh they called just now and said they're not going
[2:33:56.880 --> 2:34:01.760]  to be able to come but is it all right if they come and then i'm sure that'll be canceled too
[2:34:01.760 --> 2:34:06.960]  which is great i don't want to be around them uh but it just shows how the establishment doesn't
[2:34:06.960 --> 2:34:11.360]  know how to deal with me because they know no matter how they mischaracterize this how they
[2:34:11.360 --> 2:34:17.280]  take us out of context how they spend us no matter what they do i like it pieces because people then
[2:34:17.280 --> 2:34:21.120]  actually come and find out what we're doing and how we document everything speaking of documenting

[2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:23.040]  to really wake people up so i hope people will order shadow government today
[2:35:23.600 --> 2:35:27.360]  and and it's got a little bit of a christian perspective in it so it's really good for

[2:37:04.640 --> 2:37:11.280]  two five three three one three nine okay going back to bob chatman bob i've been ranting over obama's
[2:37:11.280 --> 2:37:17.440]  favorite for supreme court justice sunstein openly says band guns openly says band free speech
[2:37:18.080 --> 2:37:20.800]  how arrogant are they saying he's the guy they're gonna tap
[2:37:20.800 --> 2:37:29.280]  up uh... when when ruth vader ginsberg leaves again i mean they think i guess it's that mainstream
[2:37:29.280 --> 2:37:34.400]  that they know their tyrants they know the congress or tyrants and that and that they
[2:37:34.400 --> 2:37:37.280]  think they can get him through despite this what does that say about him
[2:37:39.600 --> 2:37:44.720]  it says that they think that although they want us to think they're in total control and that we
[2:37:44.720 --> 2:37:51.520]  can't do anything about it and uh... i get news of them they're not in total control and we can
[2:37:51.520 --> 2:37:59.040]  do something about it and besides the minute we stop trying to keep our freedom we may as well
[2:37:59.040 --> 2:38:06.640]  just go and join them and live on our knees as slaves and so i i i believe that this is a move
[2:38:07.600 --> 2:38:12.800]  uh... out of desperation as well uh... to come out and say these sort of things and come out and
[2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:19.920]  say that uh... they want this man to be on the supreme court and but you know they're being forced
[2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:26.000]  to do that i mean we've met him at the pass and they're fighting and we're winning this is the
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:30.880]  first time ever i mean they've had everything to themselves for years and years and years
[2:38:32.720 --> 2:38:38.240]  and so i i think we gotta keep on doing what we're doing i mean it's no wonder they're upset
[2:38:38.240 --> 2:38:43.280]  i mean the things that you just said about uh... the product that you have out there to
[2:38:43.840 --> 2:38:49.200]  tell people you know what's going on and how to understand it and what the facts are
[2:38:50.080 --> 2:38:56.800]  that's killing them i mean what you've done is enormous well it's what we've all done
[2:38:56.800 --> 2:39:00.400]  it's helped who's involved too but they haven't had the impact that you have
[2:39:00.400 --> 2:39:08.800]  well when obama deceptions been seen more than thirty million times for free online
[2:39:08.800 --> 2:39:13.440]  four million for fall the republic and all my films everything it just continues
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:19.600]  we are literally reaching hundreds of millions of people every four or five months or so
[2:39:19.600 --> 2:39:24.320]  in one way or another in media and the hundreds of interviews i do the thousands you do bob
[2:39:24.320 --> 2:39:27.840]  and there's hundreds of us that are prominent that know what we're talking about
[2:39:27.840 --> 2:39:31.840]  that don't get caught up in the coantel pro who don't get caught up in the infighting
[2:39:31.840 --> 2:39:35.520]  briefly dealing with coantel pro for those that don't know that's this infighting mechanism
[2:39:36.080 --> 2:39:40.880]  tell people how you can spot coantel pro obviously all these fake patriot sites that
[2:39:40.880 --> 2:39:46.480]  all they do is attack other people it's come out there coantel pro howl howl turner the top
[2:39:46.480 --> 2:39:52.480]  nazi coantel pro now it comes out he's fb i agent federal court uh... oklahoma city coantel pro
[2:39:52.480 --> 2:39:59.120]  i mean they've got to cast us as the bad guys somehow and he says in these reports he wrote
[2:39:59.120 --> 2:40:04.640]  sunscene says we have to attack them as conspiracy theorists because no one believes us anymore
[2:40:04.640 --> 2:40:09.520]  so it's kind of schizophrenic he says oh we're all powerful but man these people are hurting us
[2:40:09.520 --> 2:40:13.920]  we've got to pose as them to somehow try to get everybody fighting with each other
[2:40:14.480 --> 2:40:18.000]  just like they did in the sixties to groups in the seventies and eighties to conservatives
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:22.880]  but this isn't working anymore namely because too many people are standing up and speaking out
[2:40:22.880 --> 2:40:28.880]  they don't have the personnel to get it done bob Chapman you're absolutely right and uh... with
[2:40:28.880 --> 2:40:35.840]  this uh... coantel program uh... you you can usually spot these people pretty pretty easily
[2:40:35.840 --> 2:40:42.080]  because you know they won't be around for very long and they'll be telling you i don't you think we
[2:40:42.080 --> 2:40:48.640]  should go over there and attack the police barracks and shoot everybody in there i mean this is the
[2:40:48.640 --> 2:40:53.760]  kind of things that they come up with and you have to be awful dumb to get sucked in on them
[2:40:53.760 --> 2:40:59.440]  they'll try anyway but those people are already out there the government already has them out there
[2:40:59.440 --> 2:41:06.080]  they've had them out there for years i mean i one time i i came back into the country and they
[2:41:06.080 --> 2:41:12.480]  were waiting at the airport for me you know they don't you know they don't give up either but they
[2:41:12.480 --> 2:41:18.960]  don't have the personnel to reach the people like we do nobody well let me put it this way
[2:41:18.960 --> 2:41:26.080]  there's a lot of people who do not believe anything that they hear on the regular a m f m radio or
[2:41:26.640 --> 2:41:32.720]  on television and those numbers are growing and they're all gravitating to what we're talking about
[2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:38.560]  i mean i get more letters people say gee it's so nice to have somebody tell the truth but that's
[2:41:38.560 --> 2:41:42.960]  what he says he says they're not just trying to set us up he says they want to do that go into
[2:41:42.960 --> 2:41:48.160]  peaceful groups and run off everybody by talking about violence and then imprison those you can
[2:41:48.160 --> 2:41:55.680]  which is calling for crimes he says that they poses us to mix in this info and to get us all
[2:41:55.680 --> 2:42:00.640]  fighting with each other so he he he's saying the government's which we have articles here
[2:42:00.640 --> 2:42:05.520]  were sent common midset the military's doing it it was going on under bush it isn't just the liberal
[2:42:05.520 --> 2:42:11.600]  variant which isn't even liberal i mean these are just criminals uh but i mean he he's openly
[2:42:11.600 --> 2:42:16.560]  announcing that they're committing crimes i just i guess he wants to just set the precedent
[2:42:16.560 --> 2:42:23.680]  and just act like it's normal to do this well you know what what they have done and i've noted this
[2:42:23.680 --> 2:42:31.280]  quite distinctly over the last 10 years up until that time the people who were listening to me and
[2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:35.840]  what i had to say about the different subjects that i discussed they were pretty conservative
[2:42:35.840 --> 2:42:44.480]  people and at the last 10 years half of my subscribership is conservative the other half
[2:42:44.480 --> 2:42:53.120]  arex liberals marxist leninus i mean people that have all come into the middle together and this
[2:42:53.120 --> 2:43:00.960]  has to be just sending them up a tree because they don't know what to do about it so that's
[2:43:00.960 --> 2:43:06.800]  that's my next issue is that reading the village voice raw story literally scores the last three
[2:43:06.800 --> 2:43:11.360]  or four days on this guy it was the liberals the real liberals and i don't agree with their
[2:43:11.360 --> 2:43:16.000]  ideology given to them by the banks but the next step is for them to wake up to collectivism being
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:22.000]  a fraud and they're starting to do that every comment every comment on raw story which is huge
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:26.480]  on the article said he's a fascist just as bad as bush they all work for the banks
[2:43:26.480 --> 2:43:30.880]  it's global government it's a new world order my god alex jones is right i mean literally
[2:43:30.880 --> 2:43:36.160]  they're in there saying that uh alternate all these sites even though they're run by soros a
[2:43:36.160 --> 2:43:43.120]  lot of them their own people are bolting from the reservation going oh my god it's all true new world
[2:43:43.120 --> 2:43:49.200]  order i i mean i think it's it's sabotaging themselves i want this scumbag to continue
[2:43:49.200 --> 2:43:56.560]  saying what he's saying well he's certainly waking people up people who are on the edge people who
[2:43:56.560 --> 2:44:01.840]  said gee i don't have time for this my wife and i are working two jobs each and we can hardly get
[2:44:01.840 --> 2:44:07.600]  to see the kids you know we rush into the house make dinner eat and go to sleep and all of a
[2:44:07.600 --> 2:44:13.840]  sudden i said gee these people are coming out and they're saying if if if uh i disagree with
[2:44:13.840 --> 2:44:19.600]  anything they have to say they're going to put me away uh that's not right i mean that they've
[2:44:19.600 --> 2:44:27.120]  gone too far and so this is opening the minds of people even further and again desperate people
[2:44:27.120 --> 2:44:34.560]  do desperate things and that's what they've done but bob isn't it isn't it also that they've misjudged
[2:44:34.560 --> 2:44:39.440]  a lot of the public i mean part of the public are a bunch of calories 25 percent or so and so
[2:44:39.440 --> 2:44:42.960]  by saying you're not allowed to question the government you're not allowed to question global
[2:44:42.960 --> 2:44:47.760]  warming or we will arrest you i saw that five years ago in the british news last year they
[2:44:47.760 --> 2:44:53.360]  called for arresting lord montan for treason uh and and and said execute him the liberals now
[2:44:53.360 --> 2:44:57.600]  want to kill people you know they're only against the death penalty when it's for themselves but
[2:44:57.600 --> 2:45:03.360]  they want to kill us now they're saying it here and i think they're making the calculation
[2:45:03.360 --> 2:45:08.480]  that they are the mommy they are the daddy they will tell you what you're allowed to talk about
[2:45:08.480 --> 2:45:13.360]  and that all the yuppies and everybody will hear them say they're not allowed to question
[2:45:13.360 --> 2:45:19.120]  and so they're taking political correct i mean it's it's like uh chris matthews over and over
[2:45:19.120 --> 2:45:24.640]  again saying if you question government health care you are a racist that's a quote and and no
[2:45:24.640 --> 2:45:30.080]  one was talking about race they just inject it through co until pro to create more divide and
[2:45:30.080 --> 2:45:37.200]  conquer and that blew up in their face so but but they really think they're god they don't think
[2:45:37.200 --> 2:45:42.960]  they certainly do just read the foreign affairs i got a subscriber since 1960
[2:45:43.760 --> 2:45:50.880]  and uh and when i wasn't a subscriber about it off the newsstand and uh it's all there they can't
[2:45:50.880 --> 2:45:58.320]  keep their mouth shut it's as simple as that it's pretty easy to run down their their ego uh and
[2:45:58.320 --> 2:46:07.200]  look at wall street uh loyd blank fine uh the ceo of uh of golem and sacks tells us he's doing god's
[2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:14.560]  work by stealing our money i mean and then we have the tsa guy and we have the tsa guy last
[2:46:14.560 --> 2:46:20.880]  week in la go crazy and start saying i am god i am in charge well it has to be
[2:46:21.840 --> 2:46:27.040]  be expected from people like that i mean look at people go through at the airport i won't even
[2:46:27.040 --> 2:46:33.840]  travel well that's another is that's another issue the naked body scanners are now going
[2:46:33.840 --> 2:46:39.200]  into courthouses nationwide they summon you force you to come and then record your naked body and
[2:46:39.200 --> 2:46:48.080]  put it in a database that's right and it's only the beginning as they damage your dna well remember
[2:46:48.080 --> 2:46:53.520]  the running man in 1984 where swartz snaggers going around and billboards are announcing report
[2:46:53.520 --> 2:46:59.200]  of family member get a double credit cadre kids they now are putting up billboards in new york
[2:46:59.200 --> 2:47:05.120]  and they're saying nationwide rollout jumbo screens with the fbi giving you anti-terror messages
[2:47:05.120 --> 2:47:12.400]  we are literally worse than north korea now well i'll go along with that and i think most
[2:47:12.400 --> 2:47:17.440]  of the people who will listen listening will will as well otherwise they wouldn't be listening to this
[2:47:17.440 --> 2:47:24.080]  program uh it's up to you out there you you've got to absorb all this and you got to tell people
[2:47:24.080 --> 2:47:30.240]  what uh our government's trying to do to us uh we'll get the information out to you other than
[2:47:30.240 --> 2:47:38.560]  just here uh info wars has got what did you say five different pieces on it yes there they go go
[2:47:38.560 --> 2:47:44.240]  to info wars copy them send them out to everybody everybody you know whether you think they're
[2:47:44.240 --> 2:47:50.560]  going to turn you down or not you know you never know until you ask for the order whether you're
[2:47:50.560 --> 2:47:58.000]  going to get it well in this case you never know going to know about people accepting what you've
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:04.080]  got to say you don't know what's going to pull somebody's chain well it's not even accepting
[2:48:04.080 --> 2:48:09.840]  we have the video and audio in fact here is a clip of him saying we're going to ban hunting outright
[2:48:09.840 --> 2:48:14.560]  and the second amendment isn't an individual right and the next three years look for the judicial
[2:48:14.560 --> 2:48:20.880]  system to overturn it here's that clip of the white house head of regulatory affairs uh the
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:26.640]  office of information regulatory affairs here it is our animals that's a bad hunting i suggest
[2:48:26.640 --> 2:48:32.160]  if there isn't a purpose other than sport and fun that should be against the law it's time now sir
[2:48:32.720 --> 2:48:38.560]  with the previous speakers i believe the human interest certainly count in the overall balance
[2:48:38.560 --> 2:48:45.760]  but most of the time the problem is animal interests are not counted at all they have zero
[2:48:45.760 --> 2:48:54.160]  weight in the long run if this is correct our willingness to subject animals to unjustified
[2:48:54.160 --> 2:49:00.400]  suffering will be seen has been from a meal thought as a form of unconscionable barbarity
[2:49:00.400 --> 2:49:08.560]  not the same as but in many ways morally akin to slavery and mass extermination of human beings
[2:49:11.360 --> 2:49:19.840]  my coming view is that the individual right to bear arms reflects the success of an extremely
[2:49:21.040 --> 2:49:29.120]  aggressive and resourceful social movement and has much less to do with good standard legal
[2:49:29.120 --> 2:49:37.680]  arguments than than appears we have seen an unbelievable transformation in the culture
[2:49:37.680 --> 2:49:46.000]  of the second amendment in a short time as late as the early 1990s consider for example that part
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:52.080]  of the law of the district of columbia that requires citizens to keep lawfully owned shotguns
[2:49:52.080 --> 2:49:58.240]  bound at home by a trigger lock suppose that a citizen objects as citizens have been objecting
[2:49:58.240 --> 2:50:04.000]  that the trigger lock interferes with his efforts itself to fence against criminals what on earth
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:11.360]  does that have to do with the second amendment as originally understood my tentative suggestion
[2:50:11.360 --> 2:50:19.360]  is that the individual right to have guns as it's being conceptualized now is best taken as a
[2:50:19.360 --> 2:50:25.760]  contemporary creation and a reflection of current fears not a reading of civic centered
[2:50:25.760 --> 2:50:31.360]  founding debates modern gun owners who were invoking the second amendment on the basis of
[2:50:31.360 --> 2:50:37.040]  a principle they favor are perfectionists not so different from older people who tried
[2:50:38.240 --> 2:50:43.840]  unsuccessfully i'm pleased to say to get the equal protection clause read to strike down
[2:50:43.840 --> 2:50:52.000]  mandatory retirement laws well in terms of judicial developments it is striking and

[2:54:28.240 --> 2:54:33.600]  want to reduce the world population and they've got so many yuppies and mainline people thinking
[2:54:33.600 --> 2:54:38.400]  they're part of the system and part of the power structure you're not and police and military are

[2:54:54.960 --> 2:54:59.040]  you can't got something else to do that's fine because i want to get into bankster gate you were
[2:54:59.040 --> 2:55:03.840]  talking about it last week with us it's now big news timmy geitner in the crimes he's committed

[2:55:09.280 --> 2:55:17.680]  further bob can you stay with us absolutely okay anything else on the obama's favorite for supreme
[2:55:17.680 --> 2:55:23.040]  court justice sunstein wants to ban guns and free speech i'm going to finish that clip
[2:55:23.040 --> 2:55:31.360]  just the gun part i forgot to play that anything else on this guy not really just go ahead guys
[2:55:31.360 --> 2:55:36.400]  do you have that gun part queued up again the very last part just play the 32nd clip just the
[2:55:36.400 --> 2:55:41.040]  isolated clip of him where he specifically says after he says the second amendment you heard the
[2:55:41.040 --> 2:55:45.280]  part of the clip you know isn't really for individuals and it's a new idea that's that same
[2:55:45.280 --> 2:55:49.760]  party line they got caught publishing that fake book that was a lie five years ago and they and
[2:55:49.760 --> 2:55:55.120]  they they the professor lost his tenure also from chicago that said it we exposed that fraud
[2:55:55.680 --> 2:56:01.520]  professor lot did um then he goes on to say look for it to be overturned in the next three years
[2:56:01.520 --> 2:56:08.720]  here he is in terms of judicial developments it is striking and noteworthy that well over
[2:56:08.720 --> 2:56:15.840]  two centuries since the founding the no supreme court has never suggested that the second amendment
[2:56:15.840 --> 2:56:24.000]  protects an individual right to have guns not once it would be amazing though given that fact
[2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:31.920]  though uh though don't be surprised if the first time it happens is in the next three or four years
[2:56:35.040 --> 2:56:40.160]  so this guy is saying you have no right to keep bare arms
[2:56:42.080 --> 2:56:47.520]  bob there weren't rulings against the second amendment until 1933 and that's when they first
[2:56:47.520 --> 2:56:52.720]  restricted it it's been a universally understood right no laws over just like no laws respecting
[2:56:52.720 --> 2:56:56.400]  an establishment of religion or prohibiting the first exercise thereof the federal government
[2:56:56.400 --> 2:57:00.320]  has no jurisdiction either through the states that's one of the few things that the constitution
[2:57:00.320 --> 2:57:04.320]  says the states don't have even and out of the tenth amendment it's reserved to them
[2:57:04.880 --> 2:57:09.920]  and now look the the church is under 501c3 or completely government run i mean this guy
[2:57:09.920 --> 2:57:12.320]  as a constitutional lawyer he knows he's a liar
[2:57:12.320 --> 2:57:21.600]  you know one of the things that i catch in his speaking about all this
[2:57:22.480 --> 2:57:31.920]  he doesn't come on to me as being particularly intelligent and he seems very tentative about
[2:57:31.920 --> 2:57:39.120]  what he's saying and uh that would bear out what you're saying in the fact that he knows that he's
[2:57:39.120 --> 2:57:47.760]  lying well he's a nally too i mean why are these guys always a bunch of nellies oh well it's not
[2:57:47.760 --> 2:57:52.000]  i mean the point is they're all i mean i just we're ruled by a bunch of nellies when are men

[3:00:15.440 --> 3:00:21.360]  how that dovetails with google helping build the architecture of censorship bob Chapman is our
[3:00:21.360 --> 3:00:30.160]  guest we're going to open the phones up as well coming up in the next segment 1-800-259-9231
[3:00:30.160 --> 3:00:37.440]  and we will get you up and on the air today going back to bob Chapman
[3:00:39.200 --> 3:00:43.600]  bob shifting gears into the economy you are one of our leading experts you have one of the most
[3:00:43.600 --> 3:00:50.560]  accurate forecast the international forecaster.com year after year you've been right i want to get
[3:00:50.560 --> 3:00:55.200]  into the government health care i mean i've looked at both health health and senate house and senate
[3:00:55.200 --> 3:00:59.120]  versions they're both horrible the of course conference version is secret they've been doing
[3:00:59.120 --> 3:01:05.360]  that behind closed doors obama breaking his promise on that we've got all this happening and
[3:01:06.880 --> 3:01:11.040]  this is really enraged the left that they found out they're not getting to rob the rich people
[3:01:11.040 --> 3:01:19.680]  know the rich people wrote this as a big scam bob Chapman well i think it is first of all the
[3:01:19.680 --> 3:01:26.480]  control factor uh having national health care socialized health care controls the person
[3:01:27.680 --> 3:01:35.760]  it controls the modalities which you be treated with and whether you'll be allowed to live so
[3:01:35.760 --> 3:01:42.080]  government has control over your life and if they deem that your life should be eliminated
[3:01:42.080 --> 3:01:50.080]  they can do that the second point i think which is very very strong as well is that there are
[3:01:50.080 --> 3:01:57.440]  50 million people who don't have any insurance presently and it would be mandatory for them
[3:01:57.440 --> 3:02:03.360]  to have that and that's the insurance companies they're making all these noises and grumbling
[3:02:04.320 --> 3:02:10.880]  over some other points but they want this thing because they want those 50 million participants
[3:02:10.880 --> 3:02:20.560]  and so that's a very very strong reason why this health care thing is a live or die for the
[3:02:20.560 --> 3:02:26.320]  administration but it's also going to prove to be extremely profitable for insurance companies
[3:02:26.320 --> 3:02:31.360]  and it's fascism because you've got corporations going to the government and making it the law
[3:02:31.360 --> 3:02:37.760]  you've got to buy their services that's right and it cuts medicare and medicaid to the actual general
[3:02:37.760 --> 3:02:44.160]  public never mind the fact that there's going to be many many health professionals are going to say
[3:02:44.160 --> 3:02:50.880]  no i'm not going to do this especially people in the 50s and 60s and 70 who are working and
[3:02:50.880 --> 3:02:56.080]  practicing and this has been a big wake-up call you've got 18 attorney generals saying they're
[3:02:56.080 --> 3:03:01.440]  going to sue because it's selectively certain states don't have to do it uh labor unions don't
[3:03:01.440 --> 3:03:07.440]  get there nice health plans uh tax like everybody else does i mean this is completely discriminatory
[3:03:08.640 --> 3:03:13.520]  it is and uh now the thing is how long will it take us to get it through the courts because
[3:03:13.520 --> 3:03:18.080]  they do control the courts and then what kind of a decision we're going to get the same one we're
[3:03:18.080 --> 3:03:27.360]  going to get uh from the sunsteen uh you know the control that they're trying to put over us
[3:03:27.360 --> 3:03:34.720]  could could happen and if it happens it's just going to pour a poor push push people further to
[3:03:34.720 --> 3:03:40.880]  the edge because the economy is not responding and can't responding because it's so thoroughly
[3:03:40.880 --> 3:03:47.520]  corrupt i mean you see these people being uh and we'll call it interrogated by congress
[3:03:48.320 --> 3:03:55.680]  they're arrogant they don't care i mean we've got companies out there uh like uh there's three
[3:03:55.680 --> 3:04:05.680]  major companies uh in the brokerage business and uh they've made um uh 200 billion dollars
[3:04:06.320 --> 3:04:14.960]  which they're going to pay out uh to their employees the top ones of course and the that
[3:04:14.960 --> 3:04:23.200]  was done in part with taxpayer financing and then there are 80 billion dollars in tax deductions
[3:04:23.200 --> 3:04:32.080]  20 billion of that goes to just three firms and that is goldman sacks jp morgan chase and morgan
[3:04:32.080 --> 3:04:41.600]  stanley the three biggest in the country and and and nobody talks about all of the offshore
[3:04:41.600 --> 3:04:47.520]  businesses that they have where they don't pay any taxes at all i mean this is true looting
[3:04:47.520 --> 3:04:55.200]  of the entire american public let's talk about bangster gate talk about google and systematic
[3:04:55.200 --> 3:05:00.800]  censorship worldwide your phone calls and a lot more and what's happening with gold with bob chippen
[3:05:00.800 --> 3:05:05.440]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator

[3:05:21.040 --> 3:05:26.080]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[3:05:26.080 --> 3:05:31.200]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[3:05:31.200 --> 3:05:35.360]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[3:05:35.360 --> 3:05:40.080]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[3:05:40.080 --> 3:05:44.480]  insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[3:08:21.040 --> 3:08:26.000]  to go to taylor john joe julio jonathan and others that are patiently holding but i wanted to hit
[3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:32.320]  this i mentioned it earlier in the week but now we've had time for it to flesh out for it to
[3:08:32.320 --> 3:08:41.760]  kind of unfold google yahoo microsoft publicly and openly in the last 15 years designed well google's
[3:08:41.760 --> 3:08:46.800]  been around only 10 but the other before that designed the censorship systems now being used in
[3:08:46.800 --> 3:08:53.680]  australia in china in libya and other places they sell the packages to the government and they run it
[3:08:55.920 --> 3:08:59.440]  and i would tell people this and they'd say oh that's a conspiracy theory well i mean here's
[3:08:59.440 --> 3:09:06.400]  london guardian google to end censorship in china oh end it over cyber attacks decision from world's
[3:09:06.400 --> 3:09:12.400]  leading search engine comes amid a clampdown on internet in china over the last year and then it
[3:09:12.400 --> 3:09:18.240]  goes into how the chinese government hacked google to find out if they were truly censoring everything
[3:09:18.240 --> 3:09:25.760]  in their agreement then we have another headline here afp french news agency us demands china expands
[3:09:25.760 --> 3:09:32.880]  cyber attacks explain cyber attacks in face to face talks when we have the white house
[3:09:34.240 --> 3:09:40.240]  cyber securities are last february resigned saying the nsa is taking over all free speech
[3:09:40.240 --> 3:09:46.480]  with a plan to censor that was in the washington post and the article said well maybe it's good
[3:09:46.480 --> 3:09:52.480]  that they're censoring australia for the last year has announced chinese style net censorship
[3:09:52.480 --> 3:09:58.240]  that's their statement the government's calling it that now i want to give bob chatman's take on
[3:09:58.240 --> 3:10:02.400]  this but the point is this grid is already here they're already trying to implement it piecemeal
[3:10:02.400 --> 3:10:09.200]  they're building giant nsa bases one down at sandtonio's completed major newspapers go and try to
[3:10:09.200 --> 3:10:13.120]  shoot video the front gate and the police come and threaten to arrest them in america
[3:10:14.640 --> 3:10:21.120]  but i wanted to i saw a comment in the article on info wars dot com obama's favorite for supreme
[3:10:21.120 --> 3:10:27.360]  court justice sunstein wants to ban guns free speech i saw a link to i gt dot org and i was
[3:10:27.360 --> 3:10:30.880]  already aware of this i'm not just going off a comment it just reminded me of it so i thought
[3:10:30.880 --> 3:10:36.320]  i'd read to you what the commenter pasted in here from an article google is the supplier of the core
[3:10:36.320 --> 3:10:43.360]  search technology in telepedia a highly secure fact resume on this guys a highly secure online
[3:10:44.080 --> 3:10:49.600]  system where 37 000 us spies and related personnel what sun seems talking about for going tell pro
[3:10:49.600 --> 3:10:56.080]  so share information and collaborate on their devious errands like my fbi file they will give
[3:10:56.080 --> 3:11:02.160]  it to me but we've confirmed it's on in telepedia which of course most of its lies we've always
[3:11:02.160 --> 3:11:05.680]  known with others they just make crap up so the government reads about you it's a bunch of lies
[3:11:06.240 --> 3:11:10.880]  that's where their co-intel pro starts that they they eat their own droppings they they believe
[3:11:10.880 --> 3:11:16.160]  their own propaganda agencies such as the so-called national security agency have also
[3:11:16.160 --> 3:11:20.960]  purchased servers using google supplied search technology which processes information gathered
[3:11:20.960 --> 3:11:25.600]  by us spies operating all over the world in addition google is linked to the us spy military
[3:11:25.600 --> 3:11:30.080]  systems through its google earth software venture the technology behind the software which originally
[3:11:30.080 --> 3:11:36.480]  developed by keyhole ink a company funded by q-tel there's links to that a venture capital firm which
[3:11:36.480 --> 3:11:42.640]  is uh turned openly funded and operated on behalf of the cia the visible technology can automatically
[3:11:42.640 --> 3:11:47.760]  examine more than a million discussions and posts on blogs online forums and flicker simultaneously
[3:11:47.760 --> 3:11:54.000]  youtube twitter amazon and so forth it goes on the technology also scores each online item
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:12:00.480]  assigning a positive or negative of mixed or neutral status kind of like in uh v for vendetta
[3:12:00.480 --> 3:12:04.160]  when they're driving by listening to conversations and they're going the negative mention of the
[3:12:04.160 --> 3:12:10.320]  government's up at record levels they actually do that based on parameters in terms set by the
[3:12:10.320 --> 3:12:15.040]  technology operators information boiled down can be more effectively scanned and read by human
[3:12:15.040 --> 3:12:23.040]  operators so they're data mining that and it goes more into q-tel now the the issue here is that on
[3:12:23.040 --> 3:12:30.960]  record they're building more than 20 giant nsa bases publicly and that's only 30 the news reports
[3:12:30.960 --> 3:12:35.760]  of spying most of its private which is another payoff to the homeland security people and they
[3:12:35.760 --> 3:12:39.600]  go into private sector and private sector goes into government and then they give themselves
[3:12:39.600 --> 3:12:44.800]  contracts for in four years when they get out and make the money and just mass robbing they admit
[3:12:44.800 --> 3:12:50.880]  google is in there at nasa and at cia we first broke this with a high-level cia officer mr steele
[3:12:50.880 --> 3:12:56.480]  a few years four years ago i'm gonna get bob's take on this this is so important and they're
[3:12:56.480 --> 3:13:01.680]  openly building the hubs now under federal law and the cyber security act to make all
[3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:07.120]  it systems and internet providers go through their hubs to where they can censor the web
[3:13:07.120 --> 3:13:13.680]  they are putting the chinese grid in now in front of everyone and then all these white house
[3:13:13.680 --> 3:13:20.160]  officials like sunsteen are saying we will censor the web and are developing the systems to do it
[3:13:20.160 --> 3:13:26.560]  this is a declaration of war against the first amendment bob Chapman well it certainly is and
[3:13:26.560 --> 3:13:35.120]  it's quite frankly it's overwhelming uh and you know you talk about your file i worked for nsa
[3:13:35.120 --> 3:13:42.240]  indirectly and so uh they don't have to look very far but uh what they're doing is is really
[3:13:42.240 --> 3:13:50.000]  overwhelming it is war against the people because there's no reason for them to do that except to
[3:13:50.560 --> 3:13:56.240]  control people and say look we we're listening to your conversations and reading your emails
[3:13:56.800 --> 3:14:02.560]  and what you're saying is in violation of what mr sunstein says because you don't like a lot of
[3:14:02.560 --> 3:14:10.880]  things the government does so we've decided to come and send you through a uh internment camp
[3:14:10.880 --> 3:14:16.800]  will where you will be reeducated because this is with the chinese and the north koreans and the
[3:14:16.800 --> 3:14:27.520]  vietnamese did uh to their citizens and so uh it it's ominous very very ominous and it just reminded
[3:14:27.520 --> 3:14:32.720]  me a bunch of white house officials in the last year have said we will reeducate americans
[3:14:32.720 --> 3:14:38.480]  they're actually talking about that now openly yeah they they're going through the whole thing
[3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:47.120]  and uh all all we can do under the circumstances is continue to tell people the truth and educate them
[3:14:47.840 --> 3:14:55.760]  and uh hope that they catch on and we get major demonstrations going 20 million people
[3:14:55.760 --> 3:15:02.240]  visiting washington uh filling every street in the city up demanding that they stop doing what
[3:15:02.240 --> 3:15:13.440]  they're doing uh there is no other legal way for us to do it they have to start shutting the
[3:15:13.440 --> 3:15:20.160]  web down incrementally because we're kicking their butt but the act of doing this will only make our
[3:15:20.160 --> 3:15:27.040]  information more valuable bob that's right we'll have an underground believe me there are all kinds
[3:15:27.040 --> 3:15:32.400]  of ways to get information out well on this show we've told people the whole story and what's
[3:15:32.400 --> 3:15:37.280]  happening and what's going to happen and it comes true many people need to archive all the shows
[3:15:37.280 --> 3:15:43.200]  off prison planet dot tv all the films show that undoubtedly if we don't stop them in the next few
[3:15:43.200 --> 3:15:50.000]  it's going to get worse but believe me when we're under super hard core tyranny spreading this info
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:56.000]  people will listen even more that's a little trick about tyranny once it's really in place everyone
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:16:06.800]  wakes up and then what happens next is that there's acts against tyranny and that's what
[3:16:06.800 --> 3:16:13.120]  homeland security's for and they're going to list all resistance to that as as terrorism well and
[3:16:13.120 --> 3:16:18.320]  that that probably would be considered by them that at that time because what it'll what it'll
[3:16:18.320 --> 3:16:27.040]  involve is aggressive activities and they certainly can't be anything but insurgent activities people
[3:16:27.040 --> 3:16:33.680]  defending their rights their liberty their constitution and their land against people
[3:16:33.680 --> 3:16:39.520]  who are trying to take all of that away from them and so it would be all out interscene
[3:16:41.920 --> 3:16:47.040]  inter-american warfare that's why they like to move incrementally that's why they like to move
[3:16:47.040 --> 3:16:51.760]  slow but now they can't move slow anymore and i just let me tell you the cops have got a rough
[3:16:51.760 --> 3:16:56.000]  job when they try to carry all this out let's go to taylor in washington taylor you're on the air
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:17:06.320]  go ahead um elix hey you're on the air what can i do for you um just had a brief story about uh
[3:17:06.960 --> 3:17:15.120]  about the gun law thing um this summer i was working with this guy he's from mexico and well
[3:17:15.120 --> 3:17:23.680]  well and his dad on the avocado farm down in mexico nothing special basically he had to go back down
[3:17:23.680 --> 3:17:29.120]  to mexico to rescue his dad from the mexican cartel and he had to pay him off 20 grand just
[3:17:29.120 --> 3:17:37.040]  so that he could see his dad again that's what happens when societies collapse but cps grabs
[3:17:37.040 --> 3:17:42.240]  your kids makes you pay 20 grand to get them back but go ahead well that's also what happens when
[3:17:42.240 --> 3:17:47.840]  you don't have any guns when you don't have a right to defend yourself you know the police are no good
[3:17:47.840 --> 3:17:52.240]  because they pretty much have to join the criminals and yeah no that's what then that's how
[3:17:52.240 --> 3:17:57.840]  societies collapse like hey to your mexico bob chairman and he comments uh he's absolutely
[3:17:57.840 --> 3:18:06.160]  correct and it becomes one and uh i i know that law enforcement doesn't want to go that way

[3:24:55.680 --> 3:24:59.040]  i guess dentists percentage according to john as coantel pro then because he's saying what i'm
[3:24:59.040 --> 3:25:04.640]  saying here we are day after day exposing the nazis in every major case of being coantel pro
[3:25:04.640 --> 3:25:10.160]  they run both sides the control paradigm everything i'm about is shattering that paradigm and john
[3:25:10.160 --> 3:25:15.840]  calls in and cannot get out of it because he's religiously committed to it and he will never
[3:25:15.840 --> 3:25:22.080]  no matter if he listens for a thousand years ever understand it isn't that right john well you know
[3:25:22.080 --> 3:25:27.440]  if anybody is committed to dogma i think it's uh your mentor the john birch society who was
[3:25:27.440 --> 3:25:33.280]  been intimately involved with coantel pro through the 50s 60s and 70s using your kinds of slander
[3:25:33.280 --> 3:25:38.640]  this fire hose of sewer water smearing people uh i've been exposed you know what john stop right
[3:25:38.640 --> 3:25:44.960]  there stop put put him on hold i was sent little snippets of george washington's letter saying on
[3:25:44.960 --> 3:25:49.760]  the contrary sir no one is more satisfied of the fact that the illuminati is operating in the us
[3:25:49.760 --> 3:25:55.200]  than i people said look he's satisfied with the illuminati he means i'm satisfied it's operating
[3:25:55.200 --> 3:25:59.920]  the next paragraph said it is the most despicable horrible group of jackabins and criminals out of
[3:25:59.920 --> 3:26:04.960]  france i've been fighting him in my entire last administration and i fight them now that i've left
[3:26:06.240 --> 3:26:12.320]  and i hear this about the john birch society it's all made up it's made up crud the government
[3:26:12.320 --> 3:26:19.280]  tried to infiltrate them and demonize them it's made up it's made up you have no proof john anything
[3:26:19.280 --> 3:26:26.800]  else john yes i just i look up those connections between the nazi ci network brought in the fbi
[3:26:26.800 --> 3:26:31.120]  and the colin telpo operations collaborating with those groups and the and john birch society
[3:26:31.120 --> 3:26:36.560]  during those decades they were the most uh... a scabrous elements girlish elements working for
[3:26:36.560 --> 3:26:42.880]  the ci the fbi and discrediting people calling them communist of making up stuff uh trying to
[3:26:42.880 --> 3:26:47.840]  provoke things they did it through the private intelligence group of western goals association
[3:26:47.840 --> 3:26:53.600]  which was alive in the in the in the in germany with the the galen nazi organization so if this
[3:26:53.600 --> 3:26:59.520]  is your inspiration and your source of truth about communism and socialism you know i exposed
[3:26:59.520 --> 3:27:04.960]  obama long before you did you know i exposed this uh long before i did like i like i don't even know
[3:27:04.960 --> 3:27:09.440]  your last name john and nothing about you i appreciate your call i appreciate your delusional
[3:27:09.440 --> 3:27:17.200]  call i know you know i know you live in ohio or you say you do what i know you you call once a
[3:27:17.200 --> 3:27:22.400]  month anytime i talk about about communist my inspiration is the bill of rights declaration
[3:27:22.400 --> 3:27:27.520]  of independence constitution and i have found in john birch books and videos i've watched it's all
[3:27:27.520 --> 3:27:34.080]  extremely accurate i mean it's a fact that big banks fund the communist it's a fact they're funding
[3:27:34.080 --> 3:27:38.800]  all these people that say they're communist in the obama administration you're co until pro
[3:27:39.440 --> 3:27:42.480]  with what you're doing i don't believe you're consciously doing it but i mean
[3:27:43.280 --> 3:27:48.640]  this is how this divide and conquer works i spent the last few weeks but really the last two days
[3:27:48.640 --> 3:27:54.480]  intensely about how howl turner and the nazis are fbi and how he's an fbi agent with the proof in
[3:27:54.480 --> 3:28:03.440]  federal court i spend all this time exposing how all of this is going on and then you call in and
[3:28:03.440 --> 3:28:09.920]  accuse me i'm here fighting against the government takeover of health care i'm fighting against new
[3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:18.960]  wars i'm fighting against corrupt rick parry and kabeli hutchinson i'm good i know communism's bad
[3:28:18.960 --> 3:28:22.800]  you always call in on the other calls and plug communist websites and stuff and tell me how great
[3:28:22.800 --> 3:28:27.840]  they are give me a break man just because i don't like communism doesn't mean i'm bad
[3:28:29.920 --> 3:28:36.560]  i mean sick the russians declassified all their files on mccarty and how he was absolutely right
[3:28:36.560 --> 3:28:43.600]  and they were worried about him because mccarty found out the army was funding russia joe stallin
[3:28:43.600 --> 3:28:49.440]  was our ally they they helped keep him in power they gave him all the weapons they gave him nukes
[3:28:50.640 --> 3:28:57.280]  they fried some patsy's and i've tried to you know what john every time he calls i explain the
[3:28:57.280 --> 3:29:04.800]  basics to me doesn't understand it john it's a synthesis of the two sides the big banks needed
[3:29:04.800 --> 3:29:10.800]  to have an artificial clash of civilizations just like they fund radical muslims so they
[3:29:10.800 --> 3:29:15.520]  didn't have a pretext to go into those countries that's the more modern system with communism and
[3:29:15.520 --> 3:29:20.720]  it's been declassified the west the british of the us and others and big banks on record
[3:29:21.440 --> 3:29:25.680]  the people that took over russia came out of brooklyn they shipped them over there
[3:29:26.240 --> 3:29:32.720]  1917 1918 i'll finish up with this when we come back because it's an important issue
[3:29:32.720 --> 3:29:38.480]  as we try to shatter the left right paradigm the left right paradigm is communism on one
[3:29:38.480 --> 3:29:42.880]  end and fascism on the other and when you really look at fascism and communism they're basically
[3:29:42.880 --> 3:29:49.280]  the same thing a boot stomping on the human face forever i mean it's just disgusting john or call

[3:31:38.880 --> 3:31:43.360]  they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today
[3:31:43.360 --> 3:31:50.160]  seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic

[3:32:04.800 --> 3:32:09.680]  with good intentions certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until
[3:32:09.680 --> 3:32:14.720]  there was none left at any price we would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations
[3:32:14.720 --> 3:32:19.920]  could care for those unable to care for themselves we would intend not to be standing in the breadline
[3:32:19.920 --> 3:32:25.200]  with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue if the
[3:32:25.200 --> 3:32:31.280]  experience of the katrina disaster is evidence that breadline may have no bread just like the good
[3:32:31.280 --> 3:32:36.720]  intentions on the road to that unheavenly place the good intentions alone to get a supply of food
[3:32:36.720 --> 3:32:42.080]  will not feed us only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless

[3:32:55.840 --> 3:33:09.280]  the ruling elite have written literally thousands of white papers
[3:33:10.800 --> 3:33:15.600]  professor carol quickly wrote a close to thousand page book called tragedy and hope
[3:33:16.160 --> 3:33:21.520]  through a state department's secret grant it was later republished to the public
[3:33:21.520 --> 3:33:27.920]  bill clinton's mentor had a political science georgetown he explains that british imperial
[3:33:27.920 --> 3:33:34.880]  roundtable groups corporate private government management teams were dispatched around the
[3:33:34.880 --> 3:33:41.440]  globe by the turn of the last century over a hundred years ago to take down their imperial
[3:33:41.440 --> 3:33:47.280]  flags and run up the local flag but to control it from behind the scenes and to do that they
[3:33:47.280 --> 3:33:53.040]  wanted to infiltrate takeover or they couldn't destroy all alternative groups that didn't
[3:33:53.040 --> 3:33:58.400]  want to be under their domination and it's not the british empire that rules the planet it's
[3:33:58.400 --> 3:34:04.480]  that management system run by a consortium of private banks and corporations england the united
[3:34:04.480 --> 3:34:12.640]  states israel countries in europe being the chief holders of it now it's on record that
[3:34:12.640 --> 3:34:18.720]  stalin was our ally in world war two it's on record that patent was killed because he didn't
[3:34:18.720 --> 3:34:25.680]  want to go along with it it's on record that they wanted to use anti-communist movement in the
[3:34:25.680 --> 3:34:31.280]  country to restrict free speech get control of hollywood and create a synthesis by having
[3:34:31.280 --> 3:34:36.480]  communists call for communism then the government could just call for higher taxes and not sound
[3:34:36.480 --> 3:34:43.280]  as anti-american they moved everything over towards the collectivist angle which the fascist
[3:34:43.280 --> 3:34:48.800]  and the communist always want the tyrants always want to deal with a strong man with a thug with
[3:34:48.800 --> 3:34:54.240]  an oligarchy that's what carol quickly explains he says it's a good thing and he's for it and it's
[3:34:54.240 --> 3:35:00.240]  publication after publication after publication of these guys explaining how they do it and you
[3:35:00.240 --> 3:35:06.480]  just don't get it of course the fbi and others infiltrated any group they could that's what
[3:35:06.480 --> 3:35:16.720]  we're talking about that's what i'm exposing here and of course mccarthy was very useful for them
[3:35:16.720 --> 3:35:24.400]  he meant well while he was just going after leftist and people but as soon as he found out the army
[3:35:24.400 --> 3:35:30.000]  and state department are basically running russia as soon as he found out about that he was shut
[3:35:30.000 --> 3:35:36.640]  down instantly now i go back to the fact that collectivism never works and isn't a good thing but
[3:35:37.200 --> 3:35:44.240]  looking at the false bipolar world by funding soviet expansion worldwide the soviets got to
[3:35:44.240 --> 3:35:49.360]  suppress their people because they were fighting an outside threat a stage crises the united states
[3:35:49.360 --> 3:35:54.400]  got to suppress its people grow a giant military industrial complex financed by the same central
[3:35:54.400 --> 3:36:00.400]  banks the Rothschilds going back 300 years to italy and germany and france and britain
[3:36:00.400 --> 3:36:07.280]  financing both sides this is part of mainline history and so they get to build up huge centralized
[3:36:07.280 --> 3:36:12.880]  governments of different flavors in the u.s in europe in russia in asia they get to play
[3:36:12.880 --> 3:36:17.840]  countries off against each other divide countries give half of germany to the russians half to the
[3:36:17.840 --> 3:36:24.320]  allies you know have these little wars ford and gm owned factories were making the trucks that were
[3:36:24.320 --> 3:36:31.920]  shipped to northern vietnam i mean this is the reality this is how they control the paradigm
[3:36:31.920 --> 3:36:40.160]  and dominate society and any group that rises up and is legitimate and threatens the power of the
[3:36:40.160 --> 3:36:47.440]  elite and their system and the existing political order is infiltrated and taken over in fact let
[3:36:47.440 --> 3:36:54.000]  me read from co entel pro here let me close shot of this document co entel pro co entel pro in an
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:36:58.880]  acronym for counterintelligence program was a series of covert and often illegal now the white
[3:36:58.880 --> 3:37:04.400]  house is openly calls for it illegal projects conducted by the united states federal investigation
[3:37:04.400 --> 3:37:09.120]  fbi aimed at investigating and disrupting the sending political organizations within the united
[3:37:09.120 --> 3:37:14.240]  states the fbi is covered operations from its inception however formal co entel pro operations
[3:37:14.240 --> 3:37:19.840]  took place between 1956 and 1971 the fbi stated motivation at the time was protecting this is a
[3:37:19.840 --> 3:37:25.200]  quote they have links to the documents national security that means the bankers security what's
[3:37:25.200 --> 3:37:28.880]  north com therefore to make sure the robberies complete to make sure they can rob us and get away
[3:37:28.880 --> 3:37:33.680]  with it protecting national security preventing violence and maintaining the existing social
[3:37:33.680 --> 3:37:39.200]  and political order and that meant nixon having a plan to bomb the dnc remember that that's even on
[3:37:39.200 --> 3:37:46.000]  nightline and i mean it's declassified and to blame it on his political enemies which was the
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:52.640]  left at the time according to fbi records 85 percent of co entel pro resources were expended
[3:37:52.640 --> 3:37:58.320]  on infiltrating disrupting marginalizing and or subverting groups suspected of being subversive
[3:37:58.320 --> 3:38:02.960]  such as communists and socials organizations the women's rights movement militant black nationalist
[3:38:02.960 --> 3:38:08.800]  groups and nonviolent civil rights movement yeah the black panthers at first were let's have soup
[3:38:08.800 --> 3:38:14.160]  kitchens let's get our people off drugs then the feds messed with them and made them get radical
[3:38:14.160 --> 3:38:23.200]  which is what their plan was it's co entel pro to have militia people a guy owns a bass boat he's
[3:38:23.200 --> 3:38:28.640]  now the admiral literally i've seen that show up at city councils and threaten people to then demonize
[3:38:28.640 --> 3:38:33.520]  real militias to demonize the militia in the constitution they don't want you in suits and
[3:38:33.520 --> 3:38:38.480]  ties getting the state to pass it to defend the border they want you to look like cooks
[3:38:41.840 --> 3:38:45.440]  nonviolent civil rights movement including individuals such as martin luther king jr and
[3:38:45.440 --> 3:38:49.440]  others associated with the southern christian leadership conference the national association
[3:38:49.440 --> 3:38:56.240]  for the advancement of colored people itself funded by big foundations the congress of racial
[3:38:56.240 --> 3:39:00.800]  equality the american indian movement and other civil rights groups a broad range of organizations
[3:39:00.800 --> 3:39:06.160]  labeled new left including students for democratic society the national lawyers guild the weathermen
[3:39:06.720 --> 3:39:10.320]  almost all groups protesting the vietnam war and even individual student demonstrations
[3:39:10.320 --> 3:39:15.360]  with no group affiliation yeah that's what it was really aimed at and national groups such as those
[3:39:15.360 --> 3:39:23.920]  seeking independence for port eureka the other 15 percent was expended on to marginalize and
[3:39:23.920 --> 3:39:31.280]  subvert white hate groups including the kukas clan national states and national states rights
[3:39:31.280 --> 3:39:38.400]  parties yeah i've studied co until pro most of it has been against conservatives and libertarians
[3:39:38.400 --> 3:39:44.400]  but they would always fashion lies the left groups most of it was all stage like patty hirst
[3:39:44.400 --> 3:39:49.600]  be classified last year that that was all staged with her in those terrorists she was not captured
[3:39:49.600 --> 3:39:55.360]  by him she wasn't having stock home syndrome serving him so i want to go to your calls it's just
[3:39:56.960 --> 3:40:01.040]  they had to divide the world between the soviet empire and the us british empire
[3:40:01.680 --> 3:40:05.920]  so that they could all carry out crimes and take over countries and have an excuse
[3:40:05.920 --> 3:40:11.520]  to be in those latin america and asian nations and the average fbi agent the average kgb agent
[3:40:11.520 --> 3:40:16.720]  didn't even know what they were part of this is why the bankers rule they're smart they're slick
[3:40:16.720 --> 3:40:25.440]  they know what they're doing how do you cut them off the right wing never complains about
[3:40:25.440 --> 3:40:30.160]  corporate welfare the right wing mainline republicans never complain when there's tens of
[3:40:30.160 --> 3:40:36.720]  trillions for the banks or tens of trillions for wars over the decades they're mad about the
[3:40:36.720 --> 3:40:41.840]  welfare lady on welfare the left is mad at corporate welfare but not when they get in power
[3:40:41.840 --> 3:40:47.760]  like obama the biggest defense budget in history breaking his record last year of the biggest
[3:40:47.760 --> 3:40:53.360]  in history so it's it's it's left-wing rhetoric to control their fake left-wing methodology
[3:40:53.360 --> 3:40:58.640]  with the general public as the false revolution they push the revolution into that they know
[3:40:58.640 --> 3:41:03.760]  is organic so they can control it and yes they do infiltrate and try to infiltrate right wing
[3:41:03.760 --> 3:41:10.960]  groups radicalize them control them create fake groups yes that's going on yes but does that
[3:41:10.960 --> 3:41:16.080]  not mean that some of the ideas of the left aren't legitimate like let's not sterilize indian women
[3:41:16.720 --> 3:41:21.360]  or many of the ideas of the mainline right aren't real like let's have lower taxes
[3:41:22.480 --> 3:41:30.400]  bigger government is the tool for the corporate looting but the average leftist who is
[3:41:32.800 --> 3:41:38.400]  angry at george washington uh because he owned slaves and that was the practice worldwide and
[3:41:38.400 --> 3:41:43.200]  then he freed his slaves by the way and wrote against it but it was the slaves were like
[3:41:43.200 --> 3:41:48.320]  please don't shoot me back to africa it depended where they were it was case by case and they were
[3:41:48.320 --> 3:41:52.240]  and most of them when they would be freed said i don't want to leave when you see stuff like
[3:41:52.240 --> 3:41:57.200]  roots and shows like that that is the extreme examples it was a horrible institution but it
[3:41:57.200 --> 3:42:01.440]  still goes on through government debt and control today what do you think the third world's under
[3:42:01.440 --> 3:42:07.840]  through the imf and world bank they're in a form of slavery so instead of obsessing on the time that
[3:42:07.840 --> 3:42:13.440]  george washington lived in 230 plus years ago which the media does why don't they talk about
[3:42:13.440 --> 3:42:21.520]  how the un and ecoscience all talks about how they want to kill off the third world brown people
[3:42:22.800 --> 3:42:30.160]  see when you get up to elite leftist level like cast sunstein president obama is appointed to
[3:42:30.160 --> 3:42:42.000]  head the office of information and regulatory affairs
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:46.080]  again when you get up to the level of this individual right here on screen for prison
[3:42:46.080 --> 3:42:53.120]  planet dot tv viewers he calls it liberal to ban free speech of criticism of the government he
[3:42:53.120 --> 3:42:58.560]  calls it liberal to take your guns true classical liberalism is have all the guns you want have all
[3:42:58.560 --> 3:43:04.000]  the private property you want you be free just don't slave anybody else it's all a fraud you guys
[3:43:04.000 --> 3:43:08.960]  are like computers that have been fed false information or you can't even communicate

[3:47:43.360 --> 3:47:47.680]  or a conspiracy theorist or something like that when you know you're right when you know you're on
[3:47:47.680 --> 3:47:51.920]  the right side of history and you have the truth on your side there's nothing that can stop you

[3:48:08.240 --> 3:48:15.920]  and they have direct links uh to the biological the journal of biological sciences I look that
[3:48:15.920 --> 3:48:20.880]  up one of the most prestigious in the world but I've literally seen hundreds of confirmed studies
[3:48:20.880 --> 3:48:31.920]  on this group of corn alone it is mon 863 and nk 603 that grows a live pesticide in the corn
[3:48:31.920 --> 3:48:37.840]  so bugs won't eat it well what do you think poison does like liquor it eats your liver
[3:48:37.840 --> 3:48:43.200]  well that's the same thing with this Monsanto GMO corn linked to organ failure study reveals
[3:48:43.200 --> 3:48:46.720]  and a study released by the international journal of biological sciences analyzing
[3:48:46.720 --> 3:48:51.680]  effects of genetically modified foods on mammalian life that's us mammals researchers found that
[3:48:51.680 --> 3:48:56.880]  agricultural giant Monsanto's GM corn is linked to organ damage in rats it's also the stuff killing
[3:48:56.880 --> 3:49:01.840]  the honeybees because they'll still eat the pollen according to the study which was summarized by
[3:49:01.840 --> 3:49:07.920]  and it goes through that three varieties of Monsanto GM corn mon 863 insecticide producing
[3:49:07.920 --> 3:49:14.560]  mon 810 and round up her to herbicide absorbing nk 603 see these plants will live in poison
[3:49:14.560 --> 3:49:19.760]  because they absorb it but then the poison's in it everything else is killed we approve the
[3:49:19.760 --> 3:49:26.080]  consumption by us european and several other national food safety authorities and it just goes
[3:49:26.080 --> 3:49:30.640]  into the effects this is from the study we're mostly concentrated in the kidney liver function
[3:49:30.640 --> 3:49:37.440]  the two major diet detoxification organs and then it goes into how it hit other areas of the body
[3:49:37.440 --> 3:49:47.200]  though jeez man folks i mean i could i could google right now fluoridation of water bone
[3:49:47.200 --> 3:49:52.640]  cancer and literally thousands of studies over 40 years that it's giving people cancer they
[3:49:52.640 --> 3:50:02.000]  absolutely know red alert red alert red alert red alert red alert red alert red alert red alert
[3:50:02.000 --> 3:50:07.600]  red alert red alert you read about the Rockefellers and the heads of Monsanto they have their own
