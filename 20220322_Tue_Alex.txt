[00:00.000 --> 00:25.680]  The progressive trans-cancel culture is gradually eliminating the biologically natural female
[00:25.680 --> 00:26.680]  sex.
[00:26.680 --> 00:29.680]  I have undoubtedly been under the spotlight over the past few months.
[00:29.680 --> 00:32.880]  How have you been dealing with that and reasoning with everything?
[00:32.880 --> 00:35.800]  I try to ignore it as much as I can.
[00:35.800 --> 00:41.560]  I try to focus on my swimming, what I need to do to get ready for my races and just
[00:41.560 --> 00:43.120]  try to block out everything else.
[00:43.120 --> 00:48.760]  Aside from us now having to accept any naturally born female that comes in second or possibly
[00:48.760 --> 00:55.480]  third place as the actual winner in women's sports, USA Today awarded transgender assistant
[00:55.480 --> 01:00.600]  human health and services secretary Dr. Rachel Levine, woman of the year.
[01:00.600 --> 01:07.000]  My definition of courage would be to be true to yourself and to be true to who you are
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.960]  and then to pay that forward to work towards the common good.
[01:11.960 --> 01:18.080]  2022 is becoming the year when transgenders fully inserted themselves into the status
[01:18.080 --> 01:22.200]  quo to achieve the Saul Alinsky judo move on equality.
[01:22.200 --> 01:26.080]  former state health secretary Dr. Rachel Levine making history again.
[01:26.080 --> 01:32.200]  She is now the first female and openly transgender four star officer with the U.S. Public Health
[01:32.200 --> 01:33.920]  Service Commissioned Corps.
[01:33.920 --> 01:39.040]  May this appointment today be the first of many more to come as we create a diverse and
[01:39.040 --> 01:42.320]  more inclusive future.
[01:42.320 --> 01:43.960]  Diversity makes us stronger.
[01:43.960 --> 01:48.600]  Each person has a different perspective and different strengths that they bring to make
[01:48.600 --> 01:51.280]  the whole community stronger.
[01:51.280 --> 01:57.200]  The time is now for our country to continue to move the bar forward for diversity and
[01:57.200 --> 02:02.600]  I am proud to wear this uniform and answer that call regardless of the fact that Levine
[02:02.600 --> 02:07.840]  didn't even deserve it after evacuating Levine's mother from a nursing home facility while
[02:07.840 --> 02:13.880]  supporting the decision to allow COVID positive patients to return back to those facilities
[02:13.880 --> 02:19.500]  a decision that caused a massive outbreak and death to normalize the path to male and
[02:19.500 --> 02:21.400]  trans domination.
[02:21.400 --> 02:27.060]  Last year Miss Nevada became the first transgender to compete for the Miss USA pageant while
[02:27.060 --> 02:31.960]  Jeopardy welcomed its first trans contestant into the tournament of champions.
[02:31.960 --> 02:37.860]  Of course drag queen story hour has further eroded the moral compass foisted upon our
[02:37.860 --> 02:43.520]  children and also paving the way where the Marxist radicals behind the BLM movement who
[02:43.520 --> 02:46.360]  were openly calling for the end to the family.
[02:46.360 --> 02:52.120]  A movement supported by a corporatocracy infiltrated by Marxist slogans and symbolism
[02:52.120 --> 02:58.440]  the Marxist are daily using the techniques of Saul Alinsky to press ever forward to obliterate
[02:58.440 --> 02:59.960]  the American dream.
[02:59.960 --> 03:05.280]  His name is Saul Alinsky and there are still many to whom the name is meaningless but to
[03:05.280 --> 03:11.480]  millions now he is looked on as a savior and these are the so-called have nots that culturally
[03:11.480 --> 03:17.600]  deprived the abject poor they love him and they ask him in to organize their weakness
[03:17.600 --> 03:23.320]  into a strength and power that has become a frightening threat to the establishment.
[03:23.320 --> 03:29.560]  I suppose given a choice I think I would pick hell the reason I picked hell is because
[03:29.560 --> 03:31.800]  that's where all the have nots are.
[03:31.800 --> 03:37.640]  He is disarmingly mild when you meet him but there is an implacable ferocity about him
[03:37.640 --> 03:44.280]  which is directed at many forces he considers to be at the root of human suffering and misery.
[03:44.280 --> 03:45.280]  I'm all for it.
[03:45.280 --> 03:50.120]  I think our Air Force and our Army should after they finish in Vietnam should come back and
[03:50.120 --> 03:53.440]  bomb the hell out of Mississippi you know.
[03:53.440 --> 03:54.440]  What would it be?
[03:54.440 --> 03:59.080]  Send in Mississippi instead of north of Mississippi so we can all get freedom and equality down
[03:59.080 --> 04:00.080]  there too.
[04:00.080 --> 04:09.320]  Amazon supports the protest, city bank CEO, people with the most accumulated capital in
[04:09.320 --> 04:11.920]  America are also on the side of this protest.
[04:11.920 --> 04:12.920]  Why?
[04:12.920 --> 04:17.080]  Because in my view they use identity politics and racial politics they want to split the
[04:17.080 --> 04:18.920]  country along those lines.
[04:18.920 --> 04:26.200]  In particular utilizing Alinsky's major tactic to maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition
[04:26.200 --> 04:33.320]  by using the constructive alternative i.e. transgenderism as the price for a successful
[04:33.320 --> 04:34.320]  attack.
[04:34.320 --> 04:37.520]  This isn't and hasn't been about equality.
[04:37.520 --> 04:42.400]  When the corporations have auctioned off the natural rights and achievements of women
[04:42.400 --> 04:48.000]  in order to support the agenda of the Marxist political establishment we are clearly at
[04:48.000 --> 05:00.640]  war from within with a foreign enemy John Bown reporting.
[05:00.640 --> 05:02.480]  Ladies and gentlemen I need your help.
[05:02.480 --> 05:05.920]  I need your help keeping Info Wars on the air and strong.
[05:05.920 --> 05:09.920]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[05:09.920 --> 05:11.120]  I was born for this.
[05:11.120 --> 05:15.560]  You were born for this and people are really waking up right now but we had to build our
[05:15.560 --> 05:20.600]  own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of millions
[05:20.600 --> 05:21.600]  of dollars.
[05:21.600 --> 05:25.960]  And now with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day we're a platform
[05:25.960 --> 05:31.880]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[05:31.880 --> 05:32.880]  of charge.
[05:32.880 --> 05:37.640]  And because it's become so successful it's a catch-22.
[05:37.640 --> 05:42.160]  Info Wars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[05:42.160 --> 05:48.520]  movement worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter hundreds
[05:48.520 --> 05:50.280]  and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[05:50.280 --> 05:54.560]  So the biggest sale in Info Wars history is going right now the mega emergency blowout
[05:54.560 --> 06:10.960]  sale up to 75% off getting incredible products and keep Info Wars as strong as ever.
[06:10.960 --> 06:18.720]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com front-line report if you are receiving this transmission
[06:18.720 --> 06:28.720]  you are the resistance.
[06:28.720 --> 06:40.840]  It's Tuesday March 22nd 2022 3222022 why the date for the old boys?
[06:40.840 --> 06:48.600]  Over at Skull and Bones and the Bohemian Grove and their satanic death cult hell bent on
[06:48.600 --> 06:55.080]  establishing their new world order destroying the Christian era and the Renaissance and
[06:55.080 --> 07:02.360]  establishing in its place an absolute scientific dictatorship over humanity.
[07:02.360 --> 07:11.160]  Now many a politician and leader going back to World War II has talked of a new world
[07:11.160 --> 07:20.280]  order and H.G. Wells more than 100 years ago wrote the bestselling book titled a new world
[07:20.280 --> 07:28.920]  order and it came out in the Nuremberg trials of the Nazis in World War II at the end of
[07:28.920 --> 07:38.560]  World War II that the head of German propaganda Joseph Goebbels wanted to kill H.G. Wells
[07:38.560 --> 07:43.400]  because of his book the new world order.
[07:43.400 --> 07:49.240]  That book was a different world view of a world government than what the Nazis wanted
[07:49.240 --> 07:57.960]  and they knew that H.G. Wells the nonfiction also fiction writer was the brain trust of
[07:57.960 --> 08:03.640]  the Anglo-American establishment that's the name of the British U.S. global government
[08:03.640 --> 08:10.640]  combine and the Nazis had their own new world order and Adolf Alois Hitler you may have
[08:10.640 --> 08:17.840]  heard of him had an order out to kill H.G. Wells this is main line history so when you
[08:17.840 --> 08:24.200]  hear about the new world order you might pop your ears up a little bit and open your eyes
[08:24.200 --> 08:27.040]  up and focus.
[08:27.040 --> 08:31.800]  So the politicians will say oh well a new world order just means a reshuffling of the
[08:31.800 --> 08:36.880]  power structure and it can certainly mean that but we're putting together a compilation
[08:36.880 --> 08:41.080]  that there's hundreds of these that I'll be hearing later in the day of prime ministers
[08:41.080 --> 08:50.960]  and presidents and world leaders defining their new world order as world government
[08:50.960 --> 08:58.200]  like authoritarian world government and Klaus Schwab has come out saying we have the video
[08:58.200 --> 09:05.120]  China is the model of world government so it's not just a world government it's a worldwide
[09:05.120 --> 09:12.880]  authoritarian government with forced abortion infanticide giant death camps you will own
[09:12.880 --> 09:18.040]  nothing you will have nothing and you will be happy or you'll go to a camp and Biden
[09:18.040 --> 09:26.640]  is out there saying America will lead the new world order Klaus Schwab says no China will
[09:26.640 --> 09:33.760]  lead the new world order but it's like Gollum and some other minion of evil fighting over
[09:33.760 --> 09:40.520]  the ring of Mordor because the goals and the agenda and where it's taking you is the same
[09:40.520 --> 09:46.880]  place a worldwide scientific dictatorship that's now out in the open so I was very tired
[09:46.880 --> 09:51.480]  yesterday and I was going to bed early about nine o'clock and my phone started blowing
[09:51.480 --> 09:55.640]  up by a lot of well-known talk show hosts and folks calling me and texting me saying did
[09:55.640 --> 10:00.400]  you see Biden did you see Biden did you see Biden call for a new world order and I said
[10:00.400 --> 10:04.720]  no I'm gonna see it now so I got up got a glass of water got in front of the big screen
[10:04.720 --> 10:10.840]  computer that's better for in the phones and I pulled it up and sure as hell there it was
[10:10.840 --> 10:15.680]  now simultaneously we have the New York Times the Washington Post CNN I have articles here
[10:15.680 --> 10:22.080]  today specifically saying I talk about a new world order and that it's hateful and bad
[10:22.080 --> 10:26.360]  and that it doesn't exist and that I should be taken off the air their latest article
[10:26.360 --> 10:32.840]  was America has a free speech problem in the New York Times on Friday because they don't
[10:32.840 --> 10:38.120]  want us discussing the future of the world and what I played yesterday Klaus Schwab says
[10:38.120 --> 10:43.320]  we've as decide the future of the humans we will plan it we will carry it out and we
[10:43.320 --> 10:51.120]  will execute it agenda 2030 which means forced depopulation within eight years of 90% I don't
[10:51.120 --> 10:56.000]  know if they're gonna reach that goal that's their goal I want to be here in eight years
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.280]  with the media misrepresenting saying Jones said we have an 80% world depopulation by
[11:01.280 --> 11:10.480]  2030 he didn't happen it's only 20% or whatever I'm trying to stop that I don't want that
[11:10.480 --> 11:15.280]  prediction to come true we're on a train the conductor tells us where it's going I hope
[11:15.280 --> 11:22.320]  to stop that destination and I have a stack of articles along those lines here today more
[11:22.320 --> 11:27.640]  news article saying murder your dog and cat the environment we have the United Nations
[11:27.640 --> 11:37.840]  coming out and saying we're gonna have the greatest famine that the world has ever seen
[11:37.840 --> 11:47.160]  we have so much ladies and gentlemen coming up today on these fronts but you can see them
[11:47.160 --> 11:52.320]  implementing the collapse of the world very very quickly we also have an economist and
[11:52.320 --> 11:57.080]  researcher and stock picker who's been at the tip of the spear exposing the depopulation
[11:57.080 --> 12:02.760]  agenda watching the markets and I have Mr. Dow joining us in the third hour to talk about
[12:02.760 --> 12:09.320]  Daily Mail articles and others released by the government the UK hospitals bribed to
[12:09.320 --> 12:16.800]  put patients on path to death to kill people cash incentives for in a hs trust that meets
[12:16.800 --> 12:24.000]  targets on Liverpool care pathway that's why they ordered massive amounts of a euthanasia
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.880]  drug given in lethal injection in the US to be given to hundreds of thousands of old people
[12:28.880 --> 12:35.760]  they killed if you give somebody a shot of it that has pneumonia they always die in just
[12:35.760 --> 12:40.320]  a few hours and they just admit yeah we mass murdered them it's for the earth got to kill
[12:40.320 --> 12:46.320]  your dog got to kill your cat got to sterilize your son got to kill the old people there's
[12:46.320 --> 12:52.120]  not enough resources you will own nothing you will have nothing starting to figure out
[12:52.120 --> 12:57.400]  where we're going folks here is the puppet biden on his trip to Europe announcing the
[12:57.400 --> 13:04.000]  new world order you know we are an inflection point I believe in the world economy not just
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.800]  the world economy in the world occurs every three or four generations as one of them as
[13:09.800 --> 13:16.040]  the one of the top military people said to me in a secure meeting the other day 60 60
[13:16.040 --> 13:24.000]  million people died between 1900 and 1946 and since then we established a liberal world
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.560]  order and that hadn't happened in a long while a lot of people dying but nowhere near the
[13:28.560 --> 13:33.280]  chaos and now is the time when things are shifting we're gonna they're gonna be a new
[13:33.280 --> 13:37.880]  world order out there and we've got to lead it we've got to unite the rest of the free
[13:37.880 --> 13:44.840]  world and doing it so anyway new world orders code for wars collapse civilization on crises
[13:44.840 --> 13:52.640]  we'll get to that next segment the actual quotes but here I am in 2003 from access to
[13:52.640 --> 13:59.080]  TV studios laying out what the new world order really means hello I'm Alex Jones and I'm
[13:59.080 --> 14:04.360]  a syndicated radio and television host based in Austin Texas and for many years I've been
[14:04.360 --> 14:10.240]  exposing the criminal activities of the global elite also known as the new world order I
[14:10.240 --> 14:14.280]  remember five years ago being on the radio and reading UN documents on the air that were
[14:14.280 --> 14:19.920]  public and having callers call in and say there is no new world order the news said so they
[14:19.920 --> 14:25.040]  said dangerous people talk about it and I'd say excuse me there's a world bank there's
[14:25.040 --> 14:32.880]  a world court you don't have juries you can't face your accusers this is run by a group
[14:32.880 --> 14:40.520]  of elite families they're the shareholders of XYZ bank well people don't call my syndicated
[14:40.520 --> 14:45.200]  show anymore and disagree with that fact because now in the news they admit yet yes there's
[14:45.200 --> 14:51.000]  a world government yes there's a new world order so let's look at the new world order
[14:51.000 --> 14:57.520]  and what it has in store for you and your family and I assure you my friends it is nothing
[14:57.520 --> 15:06.240]  less than total enslavement we'll look at the type of cashless society control grid they're
[15:06.240 --> 15:12.160]  putting in the destruction of the bill of rights and constitution in America the disarmament
[15:12.160 --> 15:19.960]  of the people the end of national sovereignty the militarization of police and yes the concentration
[15:19.960 --> 15:28.160]  camps that are a fact not rumor but fact the documentation begins the rumors end right
[15:28.160 --> 15:36.400]  here on this show today well there you go and now you can see 19 years later you are
[15:36.400 --> 15:42.640]  here do you want to be in eight years in a cave have you survived starving to death going
[15:42.640 --> 15:47.680]  man Alex was right the hunter killer drones the robots it's all coming the bio weapons
[15:47.680 --> 15:51.960]  they will kill you and your family unless we have a global awakening and say no and bring
[15:51.960 --> 16:06.760]  clauslaw bill gates and the new world order to justice so they ride back stay with us
[16:06.760 --> 16:22.840]  by the control churches in the universities why is this the case because we innately
[16:22.840 --> 16:39.000]  fallen or sinful state so the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring
[16:39.000 --> 16:57.400]  to justice so that's why the globalist bombardous toxins and chemicals to block us getting the
[16:57.400 --> 17:03.560]  normal vitamins and minerals trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able

[18:51.980 --> 19:20.980]  Check out the new line. It's amazing.
[19:21.980 --> 19:25.980]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[19:25.980 --> 19:28.980]  With practically half the population wanting to lock
[19:28.980 --> 19:30.980]  the unvaccinated up in camps,
[19:30.980 --> 19:33.980]  the traders know they can shut us down by force.
[19:33.980 --> 19:36.980]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[19:36.980 --> 19:38.980]  So be it.
[19:38.980 --> 19:40.980]  Make them silence us by force.
[19:40.980 --> 19:43.980]  This is the final battle of the information war.

[19:47.980 --> 19:49.980]  Before everything changes.

[19:52.980 --> 20:20.980]  Victory or death, go now to InfoWarsStore.com.
[20:22.980 --> 20:38.980]  It's a free bird, yeah.
[20:38.980 --> 20:42.980]  Murder your dog. Murder your cats for the earth.
[20:42.980 --> 20:44.980]  It's for Klaus Schwab.
[20:44.980 --> 20:46.980]  It's for Michael Bloomberg.
[20:46.980 --> 20:48.980]  Well, they live like kings.
[20:48.980 --> 20:50.980]  When they say kill your dog,
[20:50.980 --> 20:52.980]  they really kill yourself, kill your child.
[20:52.980 --> 20:55.980]  And I've got articles where they're openly saying that as well.
[20:55.980 --> 20:58.980]  Not a good group of people to be leading us.
[20:58.980 --> 21:01.980]  These Embred insane so-called elites.
[21:01.980 --> 21:03.980]  All right, so here's the headlines.
[21:03.980 --> 21:05.980]  The UN is warning that we are headed
[21:05.980 --> 21:09.980]  into the worst global food crisis since World War II.
[21:09.980 --> 21:12.980]  And they go deeper and say it's going to be worse than that
[21:12.980 --> 21:14.980]  with hundreds of millions set to die.
[21:14.980 --> 21:17.980]  Already 40-plus million died under global lockdowns
[21:17.980 --> 21:20.980]  on top of who normally starves to death each year.
[21:20.980 --> 21:22.980]  15 million on average.
[21:22.980 --> 21:27.980]  Instead, we saw those numbers well above 30-plus million a year
[21:27.980 --> 21:30.980]  for the last two years, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:30.980 --> 21:34.980]  So over 45 extra million people on top of the 30 million
[21:34.980 --> 21:36.980]  that would be starving to death.
[21:36.980 --> 21:38.980]  You can do the math yourself.
[21:38.980 --> 21:41.980]  And now they're talking about hundreds of millions dead,
[21:41.980 --> 21:44.980]  but it'll be back to the newspaper.
[21:44.980 --> 21:48.980]  And then you'll just, you'll just, you know,
[21:48.980 --> 21:52.980]  give the UN a little money so they can fly around on private jets
[21:52.980 --> 21:54.980]  and give zero of the aid to the people,
[21:54.980 --> 21:58.980]  except for a few photo ops they might stage.
[21:58.980 --> 22:00.980]  So that's the New World Order.
[22:00.980 --> 22:03.980]  What does Biden mean when he announces the New World Order?
[22:03.980 --> 22:07.980]  Well, you've got China saying they lead the New World Order.
[22:07.980 --> 22:11.980]  You've got Putin saying he's starting a New World Order.
[22:11.980 --> 22:14.980]  And you've got Biden saying he's got a New World Order.
[22:14.980 --> 22:16.980]  And those are the three power blocks.
[22:16.980 --> 22:20.980]  The Chai Coms, the Anglo-American Establishment, and the Ruskies.
[22:20.980 --> 22:23.980]  And you've got Christ syndrome that's all over the world
[22:23.980 --> 22:25.980]  of all groups and peoples.
[22:25.980 --> 22:27.980]  The real plan through Christ to unify the world
[22:27.980 --> 22:30.980]  and not kill each other, whether you believe in Christ or not,
[22:30.980 --> 22:35.980]  it's what mainline mass psychologists who study mass psychology
[22:35.980 --> 22:37.980]  will tell you can actually save the earth.
[22:37.980 --> 22:39.980]  And then you've got Islam,
[22:39.980 --> 22:41.980]  that all the permutations show
[22:41.980 --> 22:44.980]  the way it's being carried out, destroy the planet.
[22:44.980 --> 22:48.980]  Then you've got transhumanism that's already decided to kill most of the people
[22:48.980 --> 22:50.980]  and then have humans become a new species.
[22:50.980 --> 22:54.980]  And then you have the Chai Coms that want their own China-centric,
[22:54.980 --> 22:57.980]  race-based fascism they call communism.
[22:57.980 --> 23:00.980]  And you've got the Russians that just want to be left alone
[23:00.980 --> 23:03.980]  and have their new order.
[23:03.980 --> 23:05.980]  And that's where we are.
[23:05.980 --> 23:10.980]  But China is competing for the transhumanist system as well,
[23:10.980 --> 23:13.980]  but they're not following the neoliberal model
[23:13.980 --> 23:17.980]  of feminizing boys, sterilizing boys and girls
[23:17.980 --> 23:21.980]  and destroying basic human civilization.
[23:21.980 --> 23:24.980]  The Chai Coms and the Russians have broken
[23:24.980 --> 23:26.980]  with that arm of the transhumanist system
[23:26.980 --> 23:28.980]  that seeks to fully end humanity,
[23:28.980 --> 23:32.980]  and they just believe they're going to merge and augment with the technology.
[23:32.980 --> 23:36.980]  So that's the real debate going on around the table.
[23:36.980 --> 23:38.980]  If you were at a table with billionaires
[23:38.980 --> 23:41.980]  and at the table with Bilderberg group members,
[23:41.980 --> 23:43.980]  and if you were having an adult discussion,
[23:43.980 --> 23:45.980]  that's what you'd be talking about.
[23:45.980 --> 23:48.980]  Those are the type of discussions I've had with all sorts of groups.
[23:48.980 --> 23:51.980]  Intelligence heads, Bilderberg group members,
[23:51.980 --> 23:56.980]  people worth $50 billion, science division heads,
[23:56.980 --> 23:59.980]  heads of harp, heads of major programs.
[23:59.980 --> 24:01.980]  I'm not trying to brag here, folks.
[24:01.980 --> 24:03.980]  I've been doing this 28 years,
[24:03.980 --> 24:06.980]  and I really study this all day,
[24:06.980 --> 24:08.980]  so I get to be at the table,
[24:08.980 --> 24:11.980]  even though most of the globalists don't like me.
[24:11.980 --> 24:13.980]  And I sit here trying to explain to everybody
[24:13.980 --> 24:15.980]  that you're going to see everything I've told you come true,
[24:15.980 --> 24:18.980]  because I'm not just up here talking about this.
[24:18.980 --> 24:21.980]  I think it's wrong to poison and dump everybody down
[24:21.980 --> 24:23.980]  and kill the majority of the public.
[24:23.980 --> 24:25.980]  Though I see the public lazy and stupid
[24:25.980 --> 24:27.980]  and falling apart and degenerating,
[24:27.980 --> 24:31.980]  the elites that want to kill everybody are even worse.
[24:31.980 --> 24:34.980]  But if the public won't listen about what's being done to you,
[24:34.980 --> 24:37.980]  you deserve what happens to you.
[24:37.980 --> 24:40.980]  As I said a thousand times, the children don't deserve it,
[24:40.980 --> 24:42.980]  and that's why I'm doing this.
[24:42.980 --> 24:45.980]  I could join the New World Order just like that
[24:45.980 --> 24:48.980]  and be immune from the laws, immune from the system,
[24:48.980 --> 24:52.980]  and protect myself for a short period of time
[24:52.980 --> 24:55.980]  from what's coming and lie to myself and say,
[24:55.980 --> 24:59.980]  I could go along with the great culling and this operation,
[24:59.980 --> 25:01.980]  and then my family will be safe.
[25:01.980 --> 25:04.980]  You really think you'll be safe joining with this?
[25:04.980 --> 25:06.980]  The few thousand of you that are actually in it,
[25:06.980 --> 25:08.980]  and the millions that serve it,
[25:08.980 --> 25:14.980]  that think they're going to get a ticket to Valhalla, to Elysium?
[25:14.980 --> 25:17.980]  No. It's a fraud. It's a lie.
[25:17.980 --> 25:21.980]  The life extension is a lie. All of it's a fraud.
[25:21.980 --> 25:24.980]  We are in a countdown to destroying the planet.
[25:24.980 --> 25:28.980]  There is a short compilation of just a few world leaders
[25:28.980 --> 25:30.980]  talking about the New World Order and world government
[25:30.980 --> 25:32.980]  and what it means. Here it is.
[25:32.980 --> 25:35.980]  You know, we are at an inflection point, I believe,
[25:35.980 --> 25:39.980]  in the world economy, not just the world economy in the world.
[25:39.980 --> 25:42.980]  It occurs every three or four generations.
[25:42.980 --> 25:46.980]  As one of the top military people said to me
[25:46.980 --> 25:48.980]  in a secure meeting the other day,
[25:48.980 --> 25:53.980]  60 million people died between 1900 and 1946,
[25:53.980 --> 25:57.980]  and since then we've established a liberal world order
[25:57.980 --> 25:59.980]  and that hadn't happened in a long while.
[25:59.980 --> 26:02.980]  A lot of people died, but nowhere near the chaos.
[26:02.980 --> 26:05.980]  And now is the time when things are shifting.
[26:05.980 --> 26:07.980]  There's going to be a new world order out there,
[26:07.980 --> 26:09.980]  and we've got to lead it.
[26:09.980 --> 26:12.980]  We've got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.
[26:12.980 --> 26:21.980]  The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a new world order.
[26:21.980 --> 26:25.980]  We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves
[26:25.980 --> 26:29.980]  and for future generations a new world order,
[26:29.980 --> 26:33.980]  a world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle,
[26:33.980 --> 26:36.980]  governs the conduct of nations.
[26:36.980 --> 26:40.980]  When we are successful, and we will be,
[26:40.980 --> 26:43.980]  we have a real chance at this new world order,
[26:43.980 --> 26:46.980]  an order in which a credible United Nations
[26:46.980 --> 26:48.980]  can use its peacekeeping role
[26:48.980 --> 26:53.980]  to fulfill the promise and vision of the UN's founders.
[26:53.980 --> 26:56.980]  There's a need for a new world order,
[26:56.980 --> 27:03.980]  but it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[27:03.980 --> 27:07.980]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[27:07.980 --> 27:10.980]  A new world is emerging.
[27:10.980 --> 27:14.980]  It is a new world order with significantly different
[27:14.980 --> 27:17.980]  and radically new challenges.
[27:17.980 --> 27:23.980]  I think its task will be to develop an overall strategy for America
[27:23.980 --> 27:27.980]  in this period when really a new world order can be created.
[27:27.980 --> 27:30.980]  It's a great opportunity and it's a crisis.
[27:30.980 --> 27:33.980]  I think the new world order is emerging.
[27:33.980 --> 27:36.980]  Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective,
[27:36.980 --> 27:40.980]  a new world order can emerge.
[27:40.980 --> 27:44.980]  2009 is also the first year of global governance
[27:44.980 --> 27:48.980]  with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis.
[27:48.980 --> 27:51.980]  The climate conference in Copenhagen
[27:51.980 --> 27:55.980]  is another step towards the global management of our planet.
[27:55.980 --> 27:58.980]  Are you optimistic a global system can happen
[27:58.980 --> 28:00.980]  from what we've heard so far?
[28:00.980 --> 28:04.980]  It could happen, and in fact it's in the work.
[28:04.980 --> 28:07.980]  And they use that plan to create crises,
[28:07.980 --> 28:09.980]  to consolidate control, to bankrupt you,
[28:09.980 --> 28:15.980]  to make you poor in steps until you can be starved to death and killed.
[28:15.980 --> 28:17.980]  You will own nothing, you will have nothing.
[28:17.980 --> 28:21.980]  You will like it because you will be dead.
[28:21.980 --> 28:27.980]  The UN is warning of the greatest food shortages and crisis in the world.
[28:27.980 --> 28:30.980]  The World Economic Forum that helped launch the worldwide shutdown
[28:30.980 --> 28:32.980]  that I've been warning you about.
[28:32.980 --> 28:36.980]  Now, after it throws you into shark infested waters,
[28:36.980 --> 28:39.980]  gives you a razor blade to slit your wrist,
[28:39.980 --> 28:42.980]  WEF issues ominous warning.
[28:42.980 --> 28:46.980]  Overcoming food crisis recommends more sustainable diets.
[28:46.980 --> 28:48.980]  I've wait for it.
[28:48.980 --> 28:51.980]  Fly larva.
[28:51.980 --> 28:54.980]  Fly larva.
[28:54.980 --> 29:07.980]  Fly larva.
[29:25.980 --> 29:27.980]  In full wars, it's paradoxical.
[29:27.980 --> 29:29.980]  It's more popular than ever.
[29:29.980 --> 29:32.980]  It's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[29:32.980 --> 29:35.980]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure
[29:35.980 --> 29:37.980]  and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else,
[29:37.980 --> 29:39.980]  we are running out of money.
[29:39.980 --> 29:42.980]  So listen, up to 75% off at infoworkstore.com
[29:42.980 --> 29:45.980]  on things like amazing patriot t-shirts
[29:45.980 --> 29:48.980]  that help spread the word and fund the operation.
[29:48.980 --> 29:51.980]  On supplements, on books, on films, everything.
[29:51.980 --> 29:54.980]  That's 25 to 75% off right now.
[29:54.980 --> 29:57.980]  The biggest sell in our history at infoworkstore.com.
[29:57.980 --> 30:26.980]  Take it for your support.
[30:27.980 --> 30:29.980]  And that's what the globalists have done.
[30:29.980 --> 30:31.980]  They have stunned us.
[30:31.980 --> 30:34.980]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings.
[30:34.980 --> 30:36.980]  And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave a speech
[30:36.980 --> 30:38.980]  called The Great Newt Narrative,
[30:38.980 --> 30:40.980]  where he brags how the public is lost.
[30:40.980 --> 30:43.980]  How the culture in the media has been driven
[30:43.980 --> 30:45.980]  to make sure the people are all alone
[30:45.980 --> 30:48.980]  so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[30:48.980 --> 30:50.980]  That's what the great reason is.
[30:50.980 --> 30:52.980]  They need darkness to thrive.
[30:52.980 --> 30:55.980]  The light lives at infowork.com.
[30:55.980 --> 30:58.980]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago
[30:58.980 --> 31:00.980]  were very public about their plans.
[31:00.980 --> 31:02.980]  They financed major universities.
[31:02.980 --> 31:06.980]  They ran full-page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda
[31:06.980 --> 31:09.980]  at the New York Times, other major newspapers.
[31:09.980 --> 31:12.980]  That the family, as we know it, is a bad thing
[31:12.980 --> 31:14.980]  and must be ended.
[31:14.980 --> 31:16.980]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household
[31:16.980 --> 31:19.980]  and teaching women that cooking dinner
[31:19.980 --> 31:21.980]  and taking care of their sons and daughters
[31:21.980 --> 31:23.980]  and husbands is a bad thing.
[31:23.980 --> 31:25.980]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner
[31:25.980 --> 31:27.980]  for my daughter, my four-national daughter.
[31:27.980 --> 31:29.980]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times,
[31:29.980 --> 31:31.980]  but I like to make it as well. I love to make breakfast.
[31:31.980 --> 31:33.980]  And literally, it's the funnest thing on earth
[31:33.980 --> 31:36.980]  to make food for your family and be nurturative
[31:36.980 --> 31:40.980]  and then all sit down together and have that communal event.
[31:40.980 --> 31:43.980]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding,
[31:43.980 --> 31:46.980]  is our normal biological actions are coming together.
[31:46.980 --> 31:48.980]  They really are.
[31:48.980 --> 31:51.980]  Sick, evil, scientific culture.
[31:51.980 --> 31:54.980]  They want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats.
[31:54.980 --> 32:23.980]  We cannot let this continue.
[32:24.980 --> 32:26.980]  We have a lot of people who are trying to get
[32:26.980 --> 32:29.980]  into these facilities for their safety.
[32:29.980 --> 32:31.980]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[32:31.980 --> 32:33.980]  And one big thing you can do to fight back
[32:33.980 --> 32:35.980]  is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[32:35.980 --> 32:37.980]  many of which are made here in America
[32:37.980 --> 32:39.980]  and are very compliant, meaning U.S.
[32:39.980 --> 32:42.980]  government military grade at infowarstore.com.

[32:44.980 --> 32:47.980]  ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.
[32:47.980 --> 32:50.980]  Again, we have big backpacks. We have special dry bags.

[32:58.980 --> 33:27.980]  at infowarstore.com.
[33:28.980 --> 33:40.980]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen,
[33:40.980 --> 33:42.980]  to the Alex Jones Show,
[33:42.980 --> 33:46.980]  a place that exists only because of your prayers
[33:46.980 --> 33:49.980]  and your word of mouth and your financial support.
[33:49.980 --> 33:53.980]  And boy, isn't it a blessing that we're still here on air
[33:53.980 --> 33:55.980]  despite all the deplatforming of the banking,
[33:55.980 --> 33:58.980]  the Democratic Party rig courts and lawsuits,
[33:58.980 --> 34:05.980]  the dirty tricks, the crimes, really,
[34:05.980 --> 34:08.980]  that have been committed against us.
[34:08.980 --> 34:12.980]  It's all been worth it, and we've been vindicated,
[34:12.980 --> 34:14.980]  and all of you that have supported the broadcast
[34:14.980 --> 34:18.980]  have been vindicated as well.
[34:18.980 --> 34:30.980]  I want to walk through the stacks I've got here in front of me.
[34:30.980 --> 34:34.980]  Before next segment, when I actually go through these articles,
[34:34.980 --> 34:36.980]  but you've got to understand the propaganda
[34:36.980 --> 34:40.980]  that goes into each piece of this.
[34:40.980 --> 34:42.980]  Here's the Jerusalem Post,
[34:42.980 --> 34:48.980]  and I literally have seen over 100 articles with similar headlines
[34:48.980 --> 34:49.980]  in the last 24 hours.
[34:49.980 --> 34:50.980]  I know you've seen it.
[34:50.980 --> 34:53.980]  I probably saw 200 without even trying to find them.
[34:53.980 --> 34:57.980]  It's all, the order goes out and the directives put forward,
[34:57.980 --> 35:01.980]  just like the CIA came out in the 70s and the 50s and 60s,
[35:01.980 --> 35:04.980]  went out and paid massive amounts of money
[35:04.980 --> 35:06.980]  for ugly architecture and ugly art
[35:06.980 --> 35:10.980]  and really dystopic things,
[35:10.980 --> 35:14.980]  so that people would start getting used to living in an ugly environment
[35:14.980 --> 35:17.980]  and would not reject things that were going to hurt them.
[35:17.980 --> 35:20.980]  The selling of evil, basically.
[35:20.980 --> 35:22.980]  And so imagine if I said,
[35:22.980 --> 35:24.980]  you will own nothing and have nothing and like it.
[35:24.980 --> 35:27.980]  You'd say, well, you're not going to rob my future,
[35:27.980 --> 35:29.980]  but if I do it because I've guilted you
[35:29.980 --> 35:31.980]  and trained you to submit to me,
[35:31.980 --> 35:34.980]  and by increment you've done what I've said
[35:34.980 --> 35:36.980]  and you don't want to admit you've been lied to,
[35:36.980 --> 35:39.980]  well, under Stockholm syndrome, under learned helplessness,
[35:39.980 --> 35:42.980]  you'd probably do it.
[35:42.980 --> 35:44.980]  But see, they've been telling you for a decade,
[35:44.980 --> 35:47.980]  things are going to collapse, you're going to have to eat bugs
[35:47.980 --> 35:51.980]  and drink sewage water, that's Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab,
[35:51.980 --> 35:54.980]  and who died and made them God?
[35:54.980 --> 35:56.980]  Well, there are a bunch of depopulationist evil people,
[35:56.980 --> 35:58.980]  but imagine if they came out and said,
[35:58.980 --> 36:00.980]  we're going to make you eat maggots.
[36:00.980 --> 36:04.980]  We're going to ban beef, chicken, fish, everything for the earth.
[36:04.980 --> 36:06.980]  And by the way, none of it's bad for the earth.
[36:06.980 --> 36:08.980]  You know we're fish, that's about it.
[36:08.980 --> 36:10.980]  It's part of the carbon cycle.
[36:10.980 --> 36:15.980]  Imagine if they said, we're going to make you eat maggots.
[36:15.980 --> 36:19.980]  You'd say, I'm not going to eat maggots,
[36:19.980 --> 36:22.980]  but here's the Jerusalem Post,
[36:22.980 --> 36:27.980]  pumpkin seeds and fly larva, the meat of the future.
[36:27.980 --> 36:31.980]  Well, you know what a fly's larva is, right?
[36:31.980 --> 36:34.980]  It's a maggot.
[36:34.980 --> 36:36.980]  Now that's a fact, just like atrazine,
[36:36.980 --> 36:39.980]  just a little bit of it in the water,
[36:39.980 --> 36:44.980]  will flip in the glands and the brain of a male frog,
[36:44.980 --> 36:47.980]  him to be homosexual, not heterosexual,
[36:47.980 --> 36:51.980]  and then the species will die.
[36:51.980 --> 36:54.980]  That's a fact too, like maggots or fly larva.
[36:54.980 --> 36:56.980]  But they have articles everywhere saying,
[36:56.980 --> 36:58.980]  I'm a liar, the frogs are fine,
[36:58.980 --> 37:00.980]  and you're fine too, though you're not.
[37:00.980 --> 37:04.980]  Sperm counts are down 96% on average in the west.
[37:04.980 --> 37:08.980]  Every form of cancer is up multi-thousand percentage points.
[37:08.980 --> 37:10.980]  We're being murdered, we're all being killed,
[37:10.980 --> 37:12.980]  and they don't damn well what they're doing.
[37:12.980 --> 37:19.980]  So pumpkin seeds and fly larva, the meat of the future.
[37:19.980 --> 37:25.980]  And it goes on from there, how they preprogram it,
[37:25.980 --> 37:31.980]  how they prepare you, how they get you ready.
[37:31.980 --> 37:34.980]  And that's just the beginning, kill your dog,
[37:34.980 --> 37:38.980]  kill your cat, don't have children, kill yourself.
[37:38.980 --> 37:41.980]  Euthanasia, they get a bunch of demoralized,
[37:41.980 --> 37:44.980]  scared rat-like people, and they'll do anything.
[37:44.980 --> 37:46.980]  Let me tell you, when I go to a liberal area of Austin
[37:46.980 --> 37:49.980]  or LA or San Francisco or Seattle or New York,
[37:49.980 --> 37:52.980]  I don't drive by and look at the ghostly-looking people,
[37:52.980 --> 37:55.980]  the ghoulish eyes, how unalive they are,
[37:55.980 --> 37:57.980]  how stupid they are, how weak they are,
[37:57.980 --> 38:00.980]  how scared they are, and feel powerful myself.
[38:00.980 --> 38:04.980]  It makes me feel weak to see my fellow humans in that condition.
[38:04.980 --> 38:07.980]  But for the globalists, when they see the homeless shelters
[38:07.980 --> 38:09.980]  and the needles and the trendies
[38:09.980 --> 38:13.980]  offering their children up to pedophile storytime,
[38:13.980 --> 38:16.980]  they feel powerful, they've broken your life force
[38:16.980 --> 38:17.980]  and broken your will.
[38:17.980 --> 38:19.980]  But by just opening up to God and saying,
[38:19.980 --> 38:22.980]  save me, help me, take me to the infinite,
[38:22.980 --> 38:25.980]  I want to be good and strong, I believe in goodness,
[38:25.980 --> 38:27.980]  you will begin to elevate your spirit,
[38:27.980 --> 38:30.980]  literally electrochemically it will manifest,
[38:30.980 --> 38:33.980]  into a higher vibration.
[38:33.980 --> 38:38.980]  That's not new age, that's not that science, folks.
[38:38.980 --> 38:41.980]  And all the chemicals and all the rest of it
[38:41.980 --> 38:44.980]  aren't going to get you to that place,
[38:44.980 --> 38:46.980]  only a true relationship with God.
[38:46.980 --> 38:51.980]  So by debasing yourself and thinking it's trendy to eat bugs
[38:51.980 --> 38:55.980]  and all the rest of it, you're not saving the earth.
[38:55.980 --> 38:58.980]  You're letting the globalists train you to be a slave
[38:58.980 --> 39:00.980]  as they prepare to cut off the resources,
[39:00.980 --> 39:02.980]  make you fight over the resources,
[39:02.980 --> 39:06.980]  and then phase you out and get rid of you.
[39:06.980 --> 39:07.980]  And you know, Joe will tell you,
[39:07.980 --> 39:09.980]  he didn't know what he was doing back on the fear factor,
[39:09.980 --> 39:11.980]  Joe Rogan, that was all conditioning too,
[39:11.980 --> 39:14.980]  to get people to dehumanize themselves.
[39:14.980 --> 39:22.980]  This is a long-term, anti-human alien agenda.
[39:22.980 --> 39:26.980]  And by alien, all of this is alien to the normal way of life.
[39:26.980 --> 39:29.980]  All of this is anti-human, anti-life on this planet.
[39:29.980 --> 39:31.980]  The globalists don't want to just get rid of humans,
[39:31.980 --> 39:33.980]  they want the whole thing taken over.
[39:33.980 --> 39:39.980]  A silicon-based system, this is an alien takeover.
[39:39.980 --> 39:41.980]  Ray Kurzweil says, I don't believe in God,
[39:41.980 --> 39:43.980]  I'm going to become God.
[39:43.980 --> 39:45.980]  I don't believe in God yet.
[39:45.980 --> 39:47.980]  And they say, we're creating alien life forms.
[39:47.980 --> 39:52.980]  COVID-19 is a manufactured, in a lab, totally synthetic,
[39:52.980 --> 39:56.980]  replicating nanotech that poisons your cardiovascular system.
[39:56.980 --> 40:00.980]  Patented, prepared, rolled out,
[40:00.980 --> 40:02.980]  and then they give you a vaccine
[40:02.980 --> 40:05.980]  that actually implants you with it further.
[40:05.980 --> 40:08.980]  All on record.
[40:08.980 --> 40:10.980]  We're going to come back and get to all of this
[40:10.980 --> 40:11.980]  and hit so much today.
[40:11.980 --> 40:13.980]  Savannah Hernandez is joining us.
[40:13.980 --> 40:14.980]  She's got a huge story.
[40:14.980 --> 40:15.980]  They've got a Tucker Carlson.
[40:15.980 --> 40:18.980]  He got censored off the web, one of those swimmers
[40:18.980 --> 40:20.980]  that spoke out she didn't like competing
[40:20.980 --> 40:23.980]  against a man two-foot taller than her.
[40:23.980 --> 40:26.980]  He has a sports enhancement thing called testicles,
[40:26.980 --> 40:28.980]  testosterone pumps.
[40:28.980 --> 40:32.980]  To inject testosterone, he can have those wavos.
[40:32.980 --> 40:35.980]  She got kicked off Twitter, banned for daring to speak up.
[40:35.980 --> 40:37.980]  Savannah Hernandez interviewed her, we got the banned interview.
[40:37.980 --> 40:39.980]  She's going to be popping in bottom of the next hour.
[40:39.980 --> 40:43.980]  And then we have the financial researcher
[40:43.980 --> 40:47.980]  and stock picker and guy way ahead of his time, Edward Dowd,
[40:47.980 --> 40:50.980]  joining us to respond to this incredible report out of the UK.
[40:50.980 --> 40:52.980]  Mainstream news, government admits it.
[40:52.980 --> 40:54.980]  Yeah, we euthanized old people.
[40:54.980 --> 40:55.980]  Yeah, we said don't give them care.
[40:55.980 --> 40:56.980]  There's too many people.
[40:56.980 --> 40:58.980]  We got to save money.
[40:58.980 --> 40:59.980]  You'll have nothing.
[40:59.980 --> 41:00.980]  You'll own nothing.
[41:00.980 --> 41:01.980]  You'll eat maggots.
[41:01.980 --> 41:02.980]  You'll drink sewage water.
[41:02.980 --> 41:04.980]  Kill your pets.
[41:04.980 --> 41:08.980]  These aren't the good guys.
[41:08.980 --> 41:11.980]  But they know that we manifest what we believe in,
[41:11.980 --> 41:12.980]  so they tell us you own nothing.
[41:12.980 --> 41:13.980]  You have nothing.
[41:13.980 --> 41:14.980]  You're a failure.
[41:14.980 --> 41:15.980]  You're ugly.
[41:15.980 --> 41:16.980]  You're going to eat bugs and you get used to that.
[41:16.980 --> 41:18.980]  Your mind starts becoming comfortable with it
[41:18.980 --> 41:20.980]  instead of I will not eat your bugs.
[41:20.980 --> 41:21.980]  And I will have children.
[41:21.980 --> 41:22.980]  And we will colonize space.
[41:22.980 --> 41:24.980]  And we will transcend your new world order.
[41:24.980 --> 41:25.980]  And God is real.
[41:25.980 --> 41:26.980]  And you are not God.
[41:26.980 --> 41:28.980]  And we are not under your control.
[41:28.980 --> 41:30.980]  We're under God's control.
[41:30.980 --> 41:33.980]  And we choose liberty and justice and freedom.
[41:33.980 --> 41:34.980]  Incredible.
[41:34.980 --> 41:35.980]  We're going to go to break.
[41:35.980 --> 41:37.980]  I want to encourage listeners to understand that
[41:37.980 --> 41:40.980]  the heat of the battle for info wars is here.
[41:40.980 --> 41:41.980]  Plus we have great products.
[41:41.980 --> 41:43.980]  If you were ever going to buy a book, a film,
[41:43.980 --> 41:46.980]  a t-shirt, now the time we're selling out of t-shirts
[41:46.980 --> 41:50.980]  even at below cost, some of them, at 75% off.
[41:50.980 --> 41:52.980]  Because we've got to get all the funds in.
[41:52.980 --> 41:54.980]  We can right now with some undridges we have.
[41:54.980 --> 41:57.980]  So 25 to 75% off on things like vasobites
[41:57.980 --> 41:58.980]  that are back at stock.
[41:58.980 --> 41:59.980]  So good for your heart.
[41:59.980 --> 42:02.980]  Things like what's been sold out for eight months
[42:02.980 --> 42:04.980]  because of supply chain breakdowns.
[42:04.980 --> 42:06.980]  The double magnesium fizzy drink.
[42:06.980 --> 42:07.980]  So good for your whole body.
[42:07.980 --> 42:08.980]  All electrochemical activities.
[42:08.980 --> 42:10.980]  Your immune system, you name it.
[42:10.980 --> 42:11.980]  It's so important.
[42:11.980 --> 42:12.980]  Tastes so delicious.
[42:12.980 --> 42:13.980]  It's discounted.
[42:13.980 --> 42:16.980]  We also have bio truce selenium from the mustard seed.
[42:16.980 --> 42:19.980]  The best you're going to find out through an incredibly low price.
[42:19.980 --> 42:21.980]  Synthetic stuff costs even more than what we're selling it for.
[42:21.980 --> 42:24.980]  It is back in stock after being sold out for almost a year
[42:24.980 --> 42:26.980]  because of supply chain breakdowns.
[42:26.980 --> 42:29.980]  It's 40% off.
[42:29.980 --> 42:35.980]  Infowarstore.com or triple eight, two five, three, three one, three nine.
[42:35.980 --> 42:39.980]  Triple eight, two five, three, three one, three nine.
[42:39.980 --> 42:42.980]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, we have the new product in stock as well.
[42:42.980 --> 42:43.980]  We're so proud of it.
[42:43.980 --> 42:46.980]  Immune support from Info Wars with all the key herbs and compounds
[42:46.980 --> 42:48.980]  known to supercharge your immune system.
[42:48.980 --> 42:50.980]  Take your immune system to the next level
[42:50.980 --> 42:52.980]  and protect yourself as much as you can
[42:52.980 --> 43:18.980]  with immune support from InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsstore.com.
[43:23.980 --> 43:25.980]  So the chemicals that we ingest
[43:25.980 --> 43:28.980]  and all the things that we try to bring into our bodies
[43:28.980 --> 43:30.980]  to change who we are
[43:30.980 --> 43:31.980]  are only lowering us.
[43:31.980 --> 43:33.980]  They're only making us more depressed.
[43:33.980 --> 43:35.980]  In the end, they're only making us less fulfilled.
[43:35.980 --> 43:37.980]  It is only by going within
[43:37.980 --> 43:39.980]  and really making that connection to God
[43:39.980 --> 43:41.980]  that we can truly empower ourselves.
[43:41.980 --> 43:44.980]  That's why the globalist, bombardist, and toxins and chemicals
[43:44.980 --> 43:47.980]  to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals
[43:47.980 --> 43:50.980]  and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy
[43:50.980 --> 43:54.980]  and to be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[43:54.980 --> 44:22.980]  That's where the incredible products come in at InfoWarsstore.com.
[44:25.980 --> 44:29.980]  This is nothing more than a top-down
[44:29.980 --> 44:32.980]  vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[44:32.980 --> 44:34.980]  Because they couldn't take our guns
[44:34.980 --> 44:35.980]  and because we wouldn't bow.
[44:35.980 --> 44:38.980]  Because the left, which is the ideology
[44:38.980 --> 44:40.980]  of this world government system, couldn't win.
[44:40.980 --> 44:43.980]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[44:43.980 --> 44:45.980]  Now we know, two years ago,
[44:45.980 --> 44:47.980]  we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[44:47.980 --> 44:48.980]  It's that simple.
[44:48.980 --> 44:51.980]  They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns.
[44:51.980 --> 44:54.980]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19
[44:54.980 --> 44:55.980]  and you know the rest of history.
[44:55.980 --> 44:57.980]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[44:57.980 --> 45:00.980]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce
[45:00.980 --> 45:02.980]  the first ever Kava Kava Roots supplement
[45:02.980 --> 45:06.980]  that is now available at InfoWarsstore.com.
[45:06.980 --> 45:08.980]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs
[45:08.980 --> 45:10.980]  in the natural health world today,
[45:10.980 --> 45:12.980]  though it has been used for hundreds of years
[45:12.980 --> 45:16.980]  in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[45:16.980 --> 45:18.980]  According to ancient Samoan legend,
[45:18.980 --> 45:22.980]  Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[45:22.980 --> 45:24.980]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler
[45:24.980 --> 45:26.980]  and creator of the universe.
[45:26.980 --> 45:28.980]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea
[45:28.980 --> 45:31.980]  during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies
[45:31.980 --> 45:32.980]  to loosen up a little.
[45:32.980 --> 45:34.980]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world
[45:34.980 --> 45:37.980]  by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[45:37.980 --> 45:40.980]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals
[45:40.980 --> 45:43.980]  contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava,
[45:43.980 --> 45:46.980]  but other herbs including, but not limited to,
[45:46.980 --> 45:50.980]  German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Balarian Root.
[45:50.980 --> 45:53.980]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly,
[45:53.980 --> 45:58.980]  so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsstore.com.
[45:58.980 --> 46:02.980]  If I had to describe with just one word,
[46:02.980 --> 46:06.980]  the brainwashing, the mind control,
[46:06.980 --> 46:11.980]  the asleep prince that the general public is in,
[46:11.980 --> 46:15.980]  the best word would actually be the people are lost.
[46:15.980 --> 46:17.980]  Just like you're lost to sleep,
[46:17.980 --> 46:19.980]  or lost in a bad nightmare,
[46:19.980 --> 46:21.980]  or you're in a car, or you get knocked out
[46:21.980 --> 46:23.980]  and you've lost your bearings
[46:23.980 --> 46:28.980]  because you are totally dizzy and confused.
[46:28.980 --> 46:29.980]  You have a concussion.
[46:29.980 --> 46:31.980]  And that's what the globalists have done.
[46:31.980 --> 46:33.980]  They have stunned us.
[46:33.980 --> 46:36.980]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings.
[46:36.980 --> 46:38.980]  And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave a speech
[46:38.980 --> 46:40.980]  called The Great New Narrative,
[46:40.980 --> 46:42.980]  where he brags how the public is lost.
[46:42.980 --> 46:45.980]  How the culture and the media has been driven
[46:45.980 --> 46:47.980]  to make sure that people are all alone
[46:47.980 --> 46:50.980]  so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[46:50.980 --> 46:52.980]  That's what the Great Reset is.
[46:52.980 --> 46:53.980]  They need darkness to thrive.
[46:53.980 --> 47:14.980]  The Light Lives at nfowars.com.
[47:14.980 --> 47:16.980]  Everybody tuned into the Alex Jones show right now
[47:16.980 --> 47:21.980]  on this Tuesday, March 22nd, 22 transmission.
[47:21.980 --> 47:24.980]  I want to ask you a question.
[47:24.980 --> 47:27.980]  Will you eat fly larvae as the Jerusalem Post is saying
[47:27.980 --> 47:29.980]  to save the earth?
[47:29.980 --> 47:31.980]  Why is that being introduced to you
[47:31.980 --> 47:33.980]  as what you're supposed to eat?
[47:33.980 --> 47:35.980]  Why is Bill Gates telling you to drink sewage water?
[47:35.980 --> 47:37.980]  Why are they having drag queen,
[47:37.980 --> 47:40.980]  convicted pedophile story time all over the world?
[47:40.980 --> 47:42.980]  Why are they telling you
[47:42.980 --> 47:44.980]  that hundreds of millions are starved to death
[47:44.980 --> 47:45.980]  and that's good,
[47:45.980 --> 47:47.980]  but that they also want you to take a vaccine
[47:47.980 --> 47:48.980]  because they don't want you to die,
[47:48.980 --> 47:52.980]  but the very groups pushing it say there's too many people.
[47:52.980 --> 47:54.980]  Look at this headline here out of the week.
[47:54.980 --> 47:57.980]  Coronavirus and the case for one world government.
[47:57.980 --> 47:59.980]  But then if you talk about one world government
[47:59.980 --> 48:01.980]  and who runs it and how it's authoritarian
[48:01.980 --> 48:03.980]  and designed to carry out depopulation,
[48:03.980 --> 48:07.980]  that Prince Charles called a new global war
[48:07.980 --> 48:09.980]  for depopulation just a few months ago,
[48:09.980 --> 48:11.980]  then you get attacked by the Southern Poverty Law Center
[48:11.980 --> 48:13.980]  and the ADL and the big banks
[48:13.980 --> 48:17.980]  and told it doesn't exist and you should just go away.
[48:17.980 --> 48:20.980]  This is the fight of our lives.
[48:20.980 --> 48:24.980]  This is the enemy of our generation that we face.
[48:24.980 --> 48:26.980]  And their new world order is a place
[48:26.980 --> 48:28.980]  that we don't even exist in.
[48:28.980 --> 48:31.980]  And on the process of being destroyed and killed,
[48:31.980 --> 48:33.980]  we're going to go through hell and our children are.
[48:33.980 --> 48:35.980]  Are we really going to lie down and take this?
[48:35.980 --> 48:38.980]  Are we really going to see hundreds of articles
[48:38.980 --> 48:43.980]  in Bloomberg and in Reuters and in the New York Times
[48:43.980 --> 48:47.980]  and in local magazines for kids in public schools
[48:47.980 --> 48:50.980]  for elementary kids, save the earth, eat maggots.
[48:50.980 --> 48:51.980]  Save the earth, drink sewage.
[48:51.980 --> 48:54.980]  Save the earth, euthanize your dog or cat.
[48:54.980 --> 48:57.980]  Don't take care of them.
[48:57.980 --> 48:58.980]  This is dystopia.
[48:58.980 --> 49:01.980]  They're attacking you with poison, with garbage,
[49:01.980 --> 49:05.980]  with lies, with big pharma, with poison shots.
[49:05.980 --> 49:07.980]  Or maybe I've just been wrong.
[49:07.980 --> 49:12.980]  Maybe I should submit and maybe we should all go out today
[49:12.980 --> 49:14.980]  with hatchets and kill our dogs in the backyards
[49:14.980 --> 49:16.980]  and our cats.
[49:16.980 --> 49:18.980]  Because it's to save the earth, right?
[49:18.980 --> 49:20.980]  We're supposed to give up everything we've got
[49:20.980 --> 49:21.980]  because we're bad.
[49:21.980 --> 49:23.980]  We're guilty because we have dogs and cats.
[49:23.980 --> 49:24.980]  We're guilty because we have children.
[49:24.980 --> 49:25.980]  We're evil.
[49:25.980 --> 49:27.980]  But none of that's even true.
[49:27.980 --> 49:29.980]  It's all a greedy group of monsters
[49:29.980 --> 49:31.980]  that want you to learn to hate yourself
[49:31.980 --> 49:33.980]  so you roll over into the ditch of history
[49:33.980 --> 49:35.980]  so they can steal the future.
[49:35.980 --> 49:37.980]  They're projecting their globalist hatred
[49:37.980 --> 49:40.980]  of themselves onto you and I.
[49:40.980 --> 49:42.980]  All the beautiful, nice things they have
[49:42.980 --> 49:44.980]  and the science they have came from the commoners,
[49:44.980 --> 49:45.980]  came from the people.
[49:45.980 --> 49:46.980]  We built all this.
[49:46.980 --> 49:48.980]  And now they've got their robots coming online
[49:48.980 --> 49:50.980]  and they say they don't need us anymore
[49:50.980 --> 49:51.980]  and we're supposed to just hate ourselves
[49:51.980 --> 49:53.980]  and go commit collective suicide.
[49:53.980 --> 49:54.980]  Well, guess what?
[49:54.980 --> 49:55.980]  It's not going to happen.
[49:55.980 --> 49:57.980]  Or maybe it should happen.
[49:57.980 --> 49:58.980]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[49:58.980 --> 50:00.980]  Maybe I am the bad guy, like the media says.
[50:00.980 --> 50:02.980]  Maybe because I don't want to kill my new puppy
[50:02.980 --> 50:03.980]  on the bad guy.
[50:03.980 --> 50:05.980]  Maybe I should kill the puppy.
[50:05.980 --> 50:08.980]  I want to apologize to the United Nations.
[50:08.980 --> 50:10.980]  I want to apologize to Klaus Schwab
[50:10.980 --> 50:11.980]  and the World Economic Forum.
[50:11.980 --> 50:14.980]  I want to apologize to Bloomberg,
[50:14.980 --> 50:16.980]  the owner, the billionaire owner of Bloomberg
[50:16.980 --> 50:19.980]  and the publication and the BBC
[50:19.980 --> 50:21.980]  and all the other groups that came out yesterday
[50:21.980 --> 50:24.980]  and said we should kill our dogs and cats
[50:24.980 --> 50:26.980]  to save the earth and to cut our carbon footprint
[50:26.980 --> 50:28.980]  and to stop Vladimir Putin.
[50:28.980 --> 50:29.980]  They actually said that.
[50:29.980 --> 50:31.980]  And I came out against that and was wrong.
[50:31.980 --> 50:33.980]  Just like I was wrong about lockdowns.
[50:33.980 --> 50:35.980]  I was wrong about the inoculations.
[50:35.980 --> 50:37.980]  I was wrong about everything.
[50:37.980 --> 50:39.980]  I want my body to belong to you guys.
[50:39.980 --> 50:42.980]  And so, we had a French Bulldog for 12 years
[50:42.980 --> 50:43.980]  named Captain.
[50:43.980 --> 50:44.980]  He died.
[50:44.980 --> 50:46.980]  A lot of you were big fans of him.
[50:46.980 --> 50:48.980]  He died a few years ago, very sad.
[50:48.980 --> 50:50.980]  We waited a few years since we were so sad about the new dog.
[50:50.980 --> 50:53.980]  We finally got a new dog named Fonzie.
[50:53.980 --> 50:55.980]  And he's about 20 weeks old.
[50:55.980 --> 50:58.980]  And he's a French Bulldog, Spaniel mix.
[50:58.980 --> 51:01.980]  And for the earth, I'm willing to sacrifice him.
[51:01.980 --> 51:04.980]  And so we're taking him to be euthanized today.
[51:04.980 --> 51:07.980]  And so I want to encourage everybody out there
[51:07.980 --> 51:09.980]  to be a good liberal for the earth.
[51:09.980 --> 51:10.980]  All carbon is bad.
[51:10.980 --> 51:12.980]  And they eat meat and that's bad.
[51:12.980 --> 51:15.980]  And also don't have children.
[51:15.980 --> 51:16.980]  Children is bad for the environment.
[51:16.980 --> 51:17.980]  That's all over the news.
[51:17.980 --> 51:19.980]  So abort your children.
[51:19.980 --> 51:20.980]  They're trying to pass laws.
[51:20.980 --> 51:23.980]  We try to agree with it to kill kids up to 26 weeks after they're born.
[51:23.980 --> 51:24.980]  That's good.
[51:24.980 --> 51:26.980]  So should I just strangle him right now?
[51:26.980 --> 51:28.980]  I mean, I mean, is that...
[51:28.980 --> 51:31.980]  I really don't want to do this, but it's not a cult.
[51:31.980 --> 51:32.980]  The left's not a cult.
[51:32.980 --> 51:34.980]  We should stay locked in our houses.
[51:34.980 --> 51:36.980]  We should let them put experimental shots in us.
[51:36.980 --> 51:38.980]  We should let them have drag queen story time with convicted pedophiles.
[51:38.980 --> 51:40.980]  We should sexualize our children.
[51:40.980 --> 51:42.980]  Bill Maher is wrong.
[51:42.980 --> 51:44.980]  And we should kill our animals.
[51:44.980 --> 51:46.980]  So he was going to have a life.
[51:46.980 --> 51:48.980]  He was going to give us a lot of love.
[51:48.980 --> 51:51.980]  We've been with dogs for at least 26,000 years.
[51:51.980 --> 51:53.980]  The archeologists have proven.
[51:53.980 --> 51:56.980]  But I really don't want to kill him.
[51:56.980 --> 51:57.980]  But man, it's for the earth.
[51:57.980 --> 51:59.980]  He's going to die if I don't...
[51:59.980 --> 52:02.980]  I don't want the government to tell me to kill my dog and cat.
[52:02.980 --> 52:06.980]  Carbon is so bad that the plants breathe carbon dioxide.
[52:06.980 --> 52:07.980]  He's...
[52:07.980 --> 52:08.980]  He's...
[52:08.980 --> 52:09.980]  He's bad.
[52:09.980 --> 52:11.980]  I mean, he's putting out carbon dioxide.
[52:11.980 --> 52:13.980]  There's tree breathes.
[52:13.980 --> 52:18.980]  Fonzie, I'm going to have to kill you for the earth, okay?
[52:18.980 --> 52:19.980]  How should we do it?
[52:19.980 --> 52:21.980]  Shoot him out of a cannon?
[52:21.980 --> 52:22.980]  Sling shot.
[52:22.980 --> 52:23.980]  Sling shot?
[52:23.980 --> 52:25.980]  You know what?
[52:25.980 --> 52:28.980]  I'm selfish.
[52:28.980 --> 52:33.980]  Let's get rid of the nuclear reactors and the GMO and the GMO vaccines first.
[52:33.980 --> 52:37.980]  And let's do some real studies about how carbon is part of the life cycle on earth.
[52:37.980 --> 52:40.980]  Sunshine, water, oxygen, carbon dioxide.
[52:40.980 --> 52:43.980]  And let's study the Rothschilds and the big banks that are set to track and trace
[52:43.980 --> 52:46.980]  and surveil everything we do with carbon taxes, social credit score.
[52:46.980 --> 52:50.980]  And let's not kill our dogs for this evil fricking cult.
[52:50.980 --> 52:52.980]  No, I'm not going to kill my dog.
[52:52.980 --> 52:53.980]  I got a better idea.
[52:53.980 --> 52:55.980]  There's too many people, too many creatures on the earth, which there isn't.
[52:55.980 --> 53:00.980]  How about Bill Gates and how about Klaus Schwab and how about the Pope that's calling for all this?
[53:00.980 --> 53:04.980]  How about you guys then get off the planet, however you want?
[53:04.980 --> 53:06.980]  Infowars.com tomorrow is news today.
[53:06.980 --> 53:10.980]  They're trying to silence us and silence you so they can gaslight everybody.
[53:10.980 --> 53:16.980]  And so this cult can demand everything of us, our dogs, our cats, our children, our future, our very lives.
[53:16.980 --> 53:18.980]  We're never going to surrender at Infowars.
[53:18.980 --> 53:23.980]  We need your support, so please spread everything we do to the four winds because knowledge is power.
[53:23.980 --> 53:27.980]  If you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[53:34.980 --> 53:44.980]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[53:44.980 --> 53:46.980]  And when it comes in from...
[53:46.980 --> 53:54.980]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[53:54.980 --> 53:55.980]  That's the globalist.
[53:55.980 --> 53:56.980]  That's what they're up to.
[54:02.980 --> 54:11.980]  You know, it just really makes me speechless to see all this going on and to see all this happening.
[54:11.980 --> 54:16.980]  I want to air that ad that was at the end of that video.
[54:16.980 --> 54:18.980]  Can you guys cue that back up?
[54:18.980 --> 54:20.980]  I want to play the end of the video.
[54:20.980 --> 54:26.980]  I want to do that because in my little OCD world, it's okay to like play an ad after a video,
[54:26.980 --> 54:31.980]  but then I don't want to cut it during the video and I'm going to be happy if I can just have that.
[54:31.980 --> 54:32.980]  Because here's the deal.
[54:32.980 --> 54:33.980]  I'm already mad at the globalist.
[54:33.980 --> 54:34.980]  I want to kill our dogs and stuff.
[54:34.980 --> 54:37.980]  And then it's things like that just send me off the edge.
[54:37.980 --> 54:38.980]  Here it is.
[54:38.980 --> 54:44.980]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying
[54:44.980 --> 54:49.980]  and empowering and fulfilling, it's going to be hard to attain.
[54:49.980 --> 54:52.980]  And when it comes to information, boy, is that true today.
[54:52.980 --> 54:59.980]  We see the entire global corrupt, anti-human depopulation, great reset combine,
[54:59.980 --> 55:05.980]  trying to collapse our society, to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision,
[55:05.980 --> 55:11.980]  suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists
[55:11.980 --> 55:16.980]  and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria,
[55:16.980 --> 55:21.980]  their world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[55:21.980 --> 55:23.980]  And none of it can succeed.
[55:23.980 --> 55:28.980]  None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[55:28.980 --> 55:32.980]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[55:32.980 --> 55:36.980]  And that's why it's hard to share in Full Wars links and band up video links.
[55:36.980 --> 55:39.980]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[55:40.980 --> 55:45.980]  All right, so there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:45.980 --> 55:51.980]  So we just commonly illustrated how insane it is.
[55:51.980 --> 55:55.980]  I mean, if you don't imagine I would never do this, if I strangled that puppy on TV
[55:55.980 --> 56:00.980]  and I said, Klaus Schwab, you're right, so that you can have more food and more resources,
[56:00.980 --> 56:03.980]  even though the dog doesn't need to die for him to have more resources.
[56:03.980 --> 56:05.980]  It's a non-zero sum game.
[56:05.980 --> 56:10.980]  I'm going to kill this dog and just strangle it on TV or maybe give it a lethal injection.
[56:10.980 --> 56:12.980]  So it's all scientific and official.
[56:12.980 --> 56:15.980]  The internet would freak out and go completely insane.
[56:15.980 --> 56:17.980]  There'd be calls for me to be arrested.
[56:17.980 --> 56:19.980]  People would want me to put me in jail.
[56:19.980 --> 56:24.980]  But then when Bloomberg and they call for euthanizing your pets in the articles to save the earth,
[56:24.980 --> 56:29.980]  they call for that, it's liberal.
[56:29.980 --> 56:33.980]  You see, we've been trained to hate ourselves and hate fellow humans
[56:33.980 --> 56:36.980]  and not care what euthanized old people or mentally retarded people.
[56:36.980 --> 56:41.980]  Just don't say the word retarded, but you can kill them.
[56:41.980 --> 56:46.980]  But we do still care about dogs and cats.
[56:46.980 --> 56:49.980]  And I've got two cats.
[56:49.980 --> 56:53.980]  I don't like a lot of cat breeds, but I definitely like ragdolls
[56:53.980 --> 56:56.980]  and experiencing my friends that have them and how great they are.
[56:56.980 --> 57:01.980]  They go good in pairs. We've got two ragdoll cats and the puppy.
[57:01.980 --> 57:05.980]  And it's not hurting them.
[57:05.980 --> 57:10.980]  It's not hurting the earth that they eat food and then put that carbon,
[57:10.980 --> 57:15.980]  that fertilizer back in the water that then goes out to the Gulf of Mexico,
[57:15.980 --> 57:19.980]  down the Colorado River, and then the shrimp and all of them feed on it
[57:19.980 --> 57:22.980]  and then the fish feed on the shrimp and you know the cycle.
[57:22.980 --> 57:32.980]  The Gulf of Mexico is full of life because there's so much food for the fish
[57:32.980 --> 57:34.980]  coming out of our cities.
[57:34.980 --> 57:38.980]  What's bad is the global is deliberately putting chemicals into the food and water
[57:38.980 --> 57:41.980]  to poison us by design on record.
[57:41.980 --> 57:43.980]  There's a way to stop this.
[57:43.980 --> 57:53.980]  We can do it together. Stay with us.
[58:13.980 --> 58:17.980]  It's a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups
[58:17.980 --> 58:20.980]  to be able to post their content free of charge.
[58:20.980 --> 58:25.980]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[58:25.980 --> 58:28.980]  Info wars and banned-out video have become a mothership
[58:28.980 --> 58:31.980]  promoting the pro-human-liberty movement worldwide.
[58:31.980 --> 58:36.980]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter,
[58:36.980 --> 58:38.980]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[58:38.980 --> 58:41.980]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now,
[58:41.980 --> 58:44.980]  the mega-emergency blowout sale up to 75% off,
[58:44.980 --> 58:48.980]  getting credible products and keeping info wars as strong as ever.
[58:48.980 --> 58:52.980]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days
[58:52.980 --> 58:56.980]  with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[58:56.980 --> 59:00.980]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of,
[59:00.980 --> 59:05.980]  our new sleep support formula down and out is just the thing.
[59:05.980 --> 59:09.980]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed
[59:09.980 --> 59:12.980]  to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[59:12.980 --> 59:15.980]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product knockout,
[59:15.980 --> 59:19.980]  with down and out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside
[59:19.980 --> 59:22.980]  are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[59:22.980 --> 59:27.980]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[59:27.980 --> 59:31.980]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower,
[59:31.980 --> 59:35.980]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees
[59:35.980 --> 59:38.980]  who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[59:38.980 --> 59:42.980]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep
[59:42.980 --> 59:44.980]  because you will be down and out.
[59:44.980 --> 1:00:12.980]  Tell it out now at infowarstore.com.
[1:00:12.980 --> 1:00:15.980]  Here's what's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:00:15.980 --> 1:00:19.980]  Savannah Hernandez will be joining us at the bottom of the hour
[1:00:19.980 --> 1:00:21.980]  to break down some really huge news.
[1:00:21.980 --> 1:00:27.980]  One of the swimmers that filed a complaint that she didn't like a man,
[1:00:27.980 --> 1:00:31.980]  literally a foot plus taller than other women,
[1:00:31.980 --> 1:00:36.980]  being able to take over and win.
[1:00:36.980 --> 1:00:39.980]  Well, she's been suspended off Twitter and Savannah got an interview
[1:00:39.980 --> 1:00:42.980]  before that even happened whether that guy got suspended
[1:00:42.980 --> 1:00:44.980]  or speaking out got her suspended.
[1:00:44.980 --> 1:00:45.980]  What a world, man.
[1:00:45.980 --> 1:00:50.980]  Not only do men go into women's sports when they failed,
[1:00:50.980 --> 1:00:55.980]  but now if you criticize it, you get banned.
[1:00:55.980 --> 1:00:58.980]  And the globalists literally hide behind black people
[1:00:58.980 --> 1:01:02.980]  and they hide behind minorities and they hide behind women.
[1:01:02.980 --> 1:01:05.980]  We've got all these videos coming up at the bottom of the hour
[1:01:05.980 --> 1:01:10.980]  big men with wigs on trying to get in girls' showers
[1:01:10.980 --> 1:01:16.980]  at high school events and things.
[1:01:16.980 --> 1:01:20.980]  So it's always push the envelope.
[1:01:20.980 --> 1:01:24.980]  Always push the envelope and get into college showers, all that.
[1:01:24.980 --> 1:01:29.980]  I mean, big old six foot two men, big old wigs on,
[1:01:29.980 --> 1:01:34.980]  big old fat dudes, I'm coming into those women, I'm a woman.
[1:01:34.980 --> 1:01:36.980]  You don't have a uterus, you don't have babies, you're crazy.
[1:01:36.980 --> 1:01:39.980]  Don't you say that, I take speech.
[1:01:39.980 --> 1:01:44.980]  It's ma'am, let me in that bathroom.
[1:01:44.980 --> 1:01:45.980]  You know, I'm the type of guy,
[1:01:45.980 --> 1:01:47.980]  even when there's guys in a big bathroom, I kind of like,
[1:01:47.980 --> 1:01:49.980]  well, I'll just wait till I get home.
[1:01:49.980 --> 1:01:52.980]  I don't like, you know, I mean, but no, no, no,
[1:01:52.980 --> 1:01:56.980]  not the left perverts, man, they won in those bathrooms.
[1:01:56.980 --> 1:02:02.980]  I never got over it in football or even, you know, at the gym.
[1:02:02.980 --> 1:02:06.980]  You know, dudes would go in the steam rooms at the spa,
[1:02:06.980 --> 1:02:09.980]  at the gym and just there, Johnson's hanging out.
[1:02:09.980 --> 1:02:12.980]  And I got a towel on her, I'm wearing, you know, swim trunks.
[1:02:12.980 --> 1:02:16.980]  I mean, it's just, you know, unless they're my wife,
[1:02:16.980 --> 1:02:18.980]  I don't want to be looking at it, you know what I mean?
[1:02:18.980 --> 1:02:19.980]  It's just weird.
[1:02:19.980 --> 1:02:21.980]  And maybe I should get over that,
[1:02:21.980 --> 1:02:24.980]  but the point is I can't imagine being a woman
[1:02:24.980 --> 1:02:26.980]  with a dude a foot and a half tall than me
[1:02:26.980 --> 1:02:29.980]  with a big old pecker like this dude's got.
[1:02:29.980 --> 1:02:31.980]  I mean, he's got a big old schlong.
[1:02:31.980 --> 1:02:32.980]  You can see it in his pants.
[1:02:32.980 --> 1:02:34.980]  He's walking around adjusting it and everything,
[1:02:34.980 --> 1:02:35.980]  you know, man spreading.
[1:02:35.980 --> 1:02:38.980]  And it's just a joke.
[1:02:38.980 --> 1:02:40.980]  It's an absolute joke.
[1:02:40.980 --> 1:02:43.980]  Some six foot four dude with a horse cock.
[1:02:43.980 --> 1:02:44.980]  I'm sorry.
[1:02:44.980 --> 1:02:46.980]  You know, and like, you know, here's the deal.
[1:02:46.980 --> 1:02:47.980]  This is a family show.
[1:02:47.980 --> 1:02:53.980]  They're coming after our children.
[1:02:53.980 --> 1:02:55.980]  They're coming after our children.
[1:02:55.980 --> 1:02:58.980]  And it's all a scientific death cult
[1:02:58.980 --> 1:03:00.980]  that wants to brainwash us into submission.
[1:03:00.980 --> 1:03:03.980]  It's not that I hate men that feel like they're women
[1:03:03.980 --> 1:03:05.980]  or men that want to live as a woman.
[1:03:05.980 --> 1:03:07.980]  I don't hate anybody that didn't hurt other people,
[1:03:07.980 --> 1:03:10.980]  but this whole thing is a raping of our psyche,
[1:03:10.980 --> 1:03:12.980]  raping us cutting off the food,
[1:03:12.980 --> 1:03:15.980]  raping us with power prices and energy prices,
[1:03:15.980 --> 1:03:17.980]  raping us with the deadly shots,
[1:03:17.980 --> 1:03:19.980]  raping us with the transgenderism
[1:03:19.980 --> 1:03:23.980]  and conducting brainwashing of our children
[1:03:23.980 --> 1:03:27.980]  under peer pressure to rope them into this.
[1:03:27.980 --> 1:03:30.980]  So the state can form a relationship with the children
[1:03:30.980 --> 1:03:32.980]  and claim, oh, parents' rights are nixed out.
[1:03:32.980 --> 1:03:35.980]  Your five-year-old son thinks he's a girl.
[1:03:35.980 --> 1:03:38.980]  And then they get celebrated by the school
[1:03:38.980 --> 1:03:40.980]  and by the clique.
[1:03:40.980 --> 1:03:46.980]  And at age seven, the balls are cut off.
[1:03:46.980 --> 1:03:51.980]  So it's what it's all about.
[1:03:51.980 --> 1:03:53.980]  And the media is like, oh, Liz Thompson,
[1:03:53.980 --> 1:03:58.980]  isn't she bold and brave and stunning and amazing?
[1:03:58.980 --> 1:04:00.980]  Aren't all these biological men
[1:04:00.980 --> 1:04:02.980]  winning all the women's sports?
[1:04:02.980 --> 1:04:04.980]  Isn't it great?
[1:04:04.980 --> 1:04:06.980]  You don't see women going up into men's sports
[1:04:06.980 --> 1:04:08.980]  because they can't and have way more bone,
[1:04:08.980 --> 1:04:11.980]  way more blood, way more everything.
[1:04:11.980 --> 1:04:13.980]  And even men that have had their testicles removed
[1:04:13.980 --> 1:04:15.980]  have a giant advantage.
[1:04:15.980 --> 1:04:17.980]  But at so many of these sports,
[1:04:17.980 --> 1:04:19.980]  they don't do a medical exam, nothing.
[1:04:19.980 --> 1:04:24.980]  Again, Lance Armstrong used a stosterone
[1:04:24.980 --> 1:04:27.980]  and blood doping, extra blood that he kept
[1:04:27.980 --> 1:04:29.980]  and then grew more blood and took his own blood.
[1:04:29.980 --> 1:04:31.980]  They were all basically doing it.
[1:04:31.980 --> 1:04:32.980]  I'm not defending what he did.
[1:04:32.980 --> 1:04:37.980]  But the point is, is Lance Armstrong's a villain
[1:04:37.980 --> 1:04:40.980]  because he enhanced himself.
[1:04:40.980 --> 1:04:44.980]  Lance Armstrong's a villain.
[1:04:44.980 --> 1:04:46.980]  But these dudes enhance themselves
[1:04:46.980 --> 1:04:48.980]  with sports-enhancing testicles,
[1:04:48.980 --> 1:04:50.980]  and they get to win and we're told it's normal.
[1:04:50.980 --> 1:04:52.980]  It is satanic.
[1:04:52.980 --> 1:04:53.980]  We'll be right back with the big news.
[1:04:53.980 --> 1:05:19.980]  We'll be right back with the big news.
[1:05:19.980 --> 1:05:26.980]  We'll be right back with the big news.
[1:05:49.980 --> 1:05:51.980]  We'll be right back with the big news.
[1:05:51.980 --> 1:06:20.980]  We'll be right back with the big news.
[1:06:22.980 --> 1:06:26.980]  Well, Senator Ron Johnson has been a true champion of truth
[1:06:26.980 --> 1:06:28.980]  dealing with the COVID vaccine and all the deaths
[1:06:28.980 --> 1:06:31.980]  and the cover-ups, and he pointed out what Fauci's done
[1:06:31.980 --> 1:06:33.980]  and the fact that he's a miserable failure.
[1:06:33.980 --> 1:06:34.980]  But he's not really a failure.
[1:06:34.980 --> 1:06:36.980]  He carried out the depopulation operation
[1:06:36.980 --> 1:06:38.980]  as he's always done, and he created the virus
[1:06:38.980 --> 1:06:40.980]  and released it on us.
[1:06:40.980 --> 1:06:43.980]  And then Dr. Peter McCulloch knocks out of the park
[1:06:43.980 --> 1:06:45.980]  explaining this was all deliberate
[1:06:45.980 --> 1:06:46.980]  and part of a larger plan.
[1:06:46.980 --> 1:06:48.980]  Here they are back to back.
[1:06:48.980 --> 1:06:52.980]  Well past time when he should have retired.
[1:06:52.980 --> 1:06:57.980]  I don't see how anybody can take a look at our response to COVID.
[1:06:57.980 --> 1:07:01.980]  965,000 Americans dead, over 6 million people worldwide.
[1:07:01.980 --> 1:07:04.980]  The human toll, the economic devastation
[1:07:04.980 --> 1:07:07.980]  from these widespread shutdowns that I advise against.
[1:07:07.980 --> 1:07:09.980]  What we've done to our children.
[1:07:09.980 --> 1:07:11.980]  I want that to sink in.
[1:07:11.980 --> 1:07:14.980]  What we have done to our children over the last few years,
[1:07:14.980 --> 1:07:16.980]  I don't know what people's opinions are
[1:07:16.980 --> 1:07:18.980]  in terms of mass effectiveness.
[1:07:18.980 --> 1:07:20.980]  But I'll tell you, one group of people,
[1:07:20.980 --> 1:07:22.980]  mass would never work on children.
[1:07:22.980 --> 1:07:24.980]  If you've seen children wear masks,
[1:07:24.980 --> 1:07:26.980]  and yet we've forced our children to wear masks
[1:07:26.980 --> 1:07:29.980]  for over two years, a delayed speech,
[1:07:29.980 --> 1:07:32.980]  obviously lost learning, couldn't see their teacher's face,
[1:07:32.980 --> 1:07:34.980]  the smiles on their classmates.
[1:07:34.980 --> 1:07:36.980]  What we have done to our children,
[1:07:36.980 --> 1:07:39.980]  put them in a state of fear, is a travesty.
[1:07:39.980 --> 1:07:43.980]  Anthony Fauci led this miserable failure of response.
[1:07:43.980 --> 1:07:45.980]  He should be held accountable.
[1:07:45.980 --> 1:07:47.980]  I've written 35 oversight letters.
[1:07:47.980 --> 1:07:49.980]  I haven't gotten squat in terms of response.
[1:07:49.980 --> 1:07:51.980]  I'm writing at 36 right now.
[1:07:51.980 --> 1:07:54.980]  I fully intend to hold these federal health agencies
[1:07:54.980 --> 1:07:57.980]  and people like Anthony Fauci accountable.
[1:07:57.980 --> 1:08:00.980]  This is review. Well, why not Lipitor and Zocor?
[1:08:00.980 --> 1:08:04.980]  What I'm telling you is it was always about COVID.
[1:08:04.980 --> 1:08:06.980]  There's something special about COVID.
[1:08:06.980 --> 1:08:09.980]  There was a plan about COVID.
[1:08:09.980 --> 1:08:11.980]  The plan was very clear.
[1:08:11.980 --> 1:08:14.980]  Wear masks, stay in lockdown, be in fear,
[1:08:14.980 --> 1:08:18.980]  have as much fear, suffering, hospitalization and death,
[1:08:18.980 --> 1:08:20.980]  and wait for the vaccine.
[1:08:20.980 --> 1:08:22.980]  And when it comes, you better take it.
[1:08:22.980 --> 1:08:25.980]  It's a needle in every arm, even down to six months old,
[1:08:25.980 --> 1:08:27.980]  and it's not just once. You better take it again,
[1:08:27.980 --> 1:08:29.980]  and you better take it every six months.
[1:08:29.980 --> 1:08:31.980]  And no questions asked.
[1:08:31.980 --> 1:08:34.980]  That is the plan, and it is a special plan for COVID,
[1:08:34.980 --> 1:08:37.980]  and everybody should be asking the questions why.
[1:08:37.980 --> 1:08:39.980]  I wouldn't believe you in 2020.
[1:08:39.980 --> 1:08:43.980]  The mainstream media is the chief champion for them.
[1:08:43.980 --> 1:08:46.980]  I mean, just on Sunday morning.
[1:08:46.980 --> 1:08:47.980]  We know what it does.
[1:08:47.980 --> 1:08:49.980]  It erases your immune system in those that live
[1:08:49.980 --> 1:08:54.980]  and begin slowly growing synthetic prion crystals
[1:08:54.980 --> 1:09:00.980]  very similar to what causes spongiform encephalopathy.
[1:09:00.980 --> 1:09:03.980]  Coming up next hour,
[1:09:03.980 --> 1:09:06.980]  UK government releases documents.
[1:09:06.980 --> 1:09:11.980]  Major universities confirm hospitals bribed to put patients
[1:09:11.980 --> 1:09:15.980]  on pathway to death and deny care and to give them chemicals
[1:09:15.980 --> 1:09:18.980]  to make them stop breathing and then blame it on COVID.
[1:09:18.980 --> 1:09:22.980]  Same thing was done here in the United States of America.
[1:09:22.980 --> 1:09:25.980]  Mainstream news, all over the British news,
[1:09:25.980 --> 1:09:28.980]  London Telegraph, Daily Mail, you name it.
[1:09:28.980 --> 1:09:30.980]  Look at this headline from the physical paper.
[1:09:30.980 --> 1:09:34.980]  Hospitals bribed to put patients on pathway to death.
[1:09:34.980 --> 1:09:36.980]  But those are death panels, remember?
[1:09:36.980 --> 1:09:38.980]  You're not supposed to talk about those,
[1:09:38.980 --> 1:09:43.980]  quote, said Bill Gates, who's a champion of those.
[1:09:43.980 --> 1:09:47.980]  And now Sajid Javed, the head of the Health Service in the UK,
[1:09:47.980 --> 1:09:51.980]  says, you need your fifth shot now.
[1:09:51.980 --> 1:09:57.980]  Israel's already coming up on its sixth shot now.
[1:09:57.980 --> 1:09:59.980]  Have you figured out yet, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:09:59.980 --> 1:10:02.980]  the globalists are self-appointed predators
[1:10:02.980 --> 1:10:04.980]  who believe they're saving the Earth from us
[1:10:04.980 --> 1:10:07.980]  and they're going to call us?
[1:10:07.980 --> 1:10:09.980]  First, they're going to teach us how to be very, very poor
[1:10:09.980 --> 1:10:13.980]  and dumbed down and isolated and disarmed.
[1:10:13.980 --> 1:10:18.980]  You understand that this is deathly real.
[1:10:18.980 --> 1:10:20.980]  This is all out in the open.
[1:10:20.980 --> 1:10:22.980]  The New World Order is out in the open.
[1:10:22.980 --> 1:10:29.980]  We're going to have a special live InfoWars broadcast tonight
[1:10:29.980 --> 1:10:33.980]  from at least seven to nine, commercial free to take phone calls,
[1:10:33.980 --> 1:10:36.980]  on the Great Reset, on the New World Order,
[1:10:36.980 --> 1:10:39.980]  and what you think we should do is call us to stop this.
[1:10:39.980 --> 1:10:43.980]  It'll be infowars.com streams.
[1:10:43.980 --> 1:10:46.980]  They'll be on Bandai Video and stations are welcome to pick it up.
[1:10:46.980 --> 1:10:49.980]  If they would like to, we've been doing the Saturday shows
[1:10:49.980 --> 1:10:52.980]  that are commercial free, two to three hours, almost every Saturday.
[1:10:52.980 --> 1:10:55.980]  Of course, a Sunday show for a very long time for two hours.
[1:10:55.980 --> 1:10:57.980]  Four to six, we've expanded it four to eight,
[1:10:57.980 --> 1:11:00.980]  because every day we're on air is very, very precious,
[1:11:00.980 --> 1:11:04.980]  and we're on a lot of radio stations, so we're in a radio format,
[1:11:04.980 --> 1:11:07.980]  14 minutes of ads an hour, that's the standard.
[1:11:07.980 --> 1:11:10.980]  People really like the commercial free podcast styles,
[1:11:10.980 --> 1:11:14.980]  and so I am doing everything I can to eat healthy and to exercise
[1:11:14.980 --> 1:11:18.980]  and to compartmentalize everything and still spend time with family,
[1:11:18.980 --> 1:11:23.980]  but to work a bare minimum of 15 hours a day.
[1:11:23.980 --> 1:11:25.980]  You've got my commitment to do that seven days a week,
[1:11:25.980 --> 1:11:28.980]  and that's what I've been doing.
[1:11:28.980 --> 1:11:31.980]  A lot of the issues are, though,
[1:11:31.980 --> 1:11:36.980]  I study so much for hours and hours and hours a day,
[1:11:36.980 --> 1:11:39.980]  and then when I get here, I've already read it and looked at it all,
[1:11:39.980 --> 1:11:41.980]  and it's exhausting.
[1:11:41.980 --> 1:11:45.980]  It is scary, but I'll tell you what's worse,
[1:11:45.980 --> 1:11:49.980]  not knowing this, or knowing it and doing nothing.
[1:11:49.980 --> 1:11:54.980]  I mean, we are in a countdown to design global collapse
[1:11:54.980 --> 1:11:58.980]  and forced depopulation.
[1:11:58.980 --> 1:12:02.980]  And this is deathly serious,
[1:12:02.980 --> 1:12:08.980]  and you're going to see the political, economic, cultural, spiritual,
[1:12:08.980 --> 1:12:14.980]  electromagnetic nature of the universe
[1:12:14.980 --> 1:12:18.980]  change so much so fast on an incremental path,
[1:12:18.980 --> 1:12:21.980]  but it accelerates logarithmically,
[1:12:21.980 --> 1:12:24.980]  but you're not going to be able to recognize the world in two years.
[1:12:24.980 --> 1:12:26.980]  I told you two years ago, I said,
[1:12:26.980 --> 1:12:29.980]  you'll look out at the end of the first round of this power grab
[1:12:29.980 --> 1:12:31.980]  that I predicted would last about two years.
[1:12:31.980 --> 1:12:35.980]  It was in their own documents.
[1:12:35.980 --> 1:12:40.980]  With the wars and the cyber attacks they're going to stage,
[1:12:40.980 --> 1:12:43.980]  that the globalists are going to blame on Russia and others,
[1:12:43.980 --> 1:12:46.980]  that you're going to look back on that as a cakewalk.
[1:12:46.980 --> 1:12:49.980]  And with what's coming in the next year,
[1:12:49.980 --> 1:12:54.980]  you're going to look back on that in five years as a cakewalk.
[1:12:54.980 --> 1:12:58.980]  Prince Charles four months ago got up in front of world leaders
[1:12:58.980 --> 1:13:00.980]  at the big carbon tax summit and said,
[1:13:00.980 --> 1:13:04.980]  we need more money than in all the world to prosecute this war
[1:13:04.980 --> 1:13:08.980]  against anything hurting the climate that produces carbon.
[1:13:08.980 --> 1:13:10.980]  He was declaring carbon is the enemy.
[1:13:10.980 --> 1:13:12.980]  Trees are carbon.
[1:13:12.980 --> 1:13:13.980]  Insects are carbon.
[1:13:13.980 --> 1:13:14.980]  Humans are carbon.
[1:13:14.980 --> 1:13:15.980]  Your baby is carbon.
[1:13:15.980 --> 1:13:16.980]  A cat is carbon.
[1:13:16.980 --> 1:13:19.980]  A dog is carbon.
[1:13:19.980 --> 1:13:23.980]  What you put in your car is carbon.
[1:13:23.980 --> 1:13:26.980]  Electricity through electric car is generated by carbon.
[1:13:26.980 --> 1:13:31.980]  We are carbon based life forms and we have a group of globalists
[1:13:31.980 --> 1:13:40.980]  telling us that they are going to transcend us
[1:13:40.980 --> 1:13:44.980]  and transcend being carbon based.
[1:13:44.980 --> 1:13:47.980]  Now I don't know if they made deals with aliens or what,
[1:13:47.980 --> 1:13:50.980]  but it's alien what they're doing.
[1:13:50.980 --> 1:13:53.980]  And we know the earth again was carbon starved millions of years ago
[1:13:53.980 --> 1:13:55.980]  and plants grew three, four times faster.
[1:13:55.980 --> 1:13:56.980]  Animals got much bigger.
[1:13:56.980 --> 1:13:57.980]  Animals live longer.
[1:13:57.980 --> 1:13:58.980]  They know this.
[1:13:58.980 --> 1:14:01.980]  Both reptiles, mammals, you name it.
[1:14:01.980 --> 1:14:05.980]  And we are in a carbon starved state and actually have only in the last
[1:14:05.980 --> 1:14:12.980]  150 years or so drawn a lot of that carbon back up out of the ground
[1:14:12.980 --> 1:14:18.980]  and terraformed it to be warmer and better for plants.
[1:14:18.980 --> 1:14:21.980]  Like it was all set up for us to go to the next level.
[1:14:21.980 --> 1:14:22.980]  All prepared here.
[1:14:22.980 --> 1:14:26.980]  The planet, perfect distance from the sun for the perfect weather.
[1:14:26.980 --> 1:14:30.980]  The moon, perfect placement, perfect size to control the tides
[1:14:30.980 --> 1:14:36.980]  and shield us from solar storms and magnetic waves on and on
[1:14:36.980 --> 1:14:45.980]  and on all of it perfectly set up for us like stones across a creek
[1:14:45.980 --> 1:14:47.980]  that we can hop across.
[1:14:47.980 --> 1:14:53.980]  We're going to find on Mars what we need and the obelisk that is there,
[1:14:53.980 --> 1:14:55.980]  the real one on its moon.
[1:14:55.980 --> 1:14:59.980]  And we're going to find, we're going to find what we need on Venus
[1:14:59.980 --> 1:15:01.980]  and its satellites.
[1:15:01.980 --> 1:15:08.980]  And we're going to find, oh, so much on Jupiter and its 50 plus moons
[1:15:08.980 --> 1:15:15.980]  and then the Kuiper belt and beyond everything waiting for us.
[1:15:15.980 --> 1:15:18.980]  But God knows you can't just give somebody everything.
[1:15:18.980 --> 1:15:19.980]  You've got to give them free will.
[1:15:19.980 --> 1:15:20.980]  See how they test out.
[1:15:20.980 --> 1:15:21.980]  See if the egg hatches.
[1:15:21.980 --> 1:15:24.980]  See if we go to the next level from larval phase to the next.
[1:15:24.980 --> 1:15:27.980]  And then we've got to work the riddle out.
[1:15:27.980 --> 1:15:29.980]  It's a fortune hunt.
[1:15:29.980 --> 1:15:31.980]  It's like Easter egg hunting.
[1:15:31.980 --> 1:15:34.980]  We've got to go out and find it and do it.
[1:15:34.980 --> 1:15:38.980]  But there are people running things that tell us we're ugly and bad
[1:15:38.980 --> 1:15:41.980]  and evil and need to roll over to die and hand it all to them.
[1:15:41.980 --> 1:15:43.980]  And oh, mammals aren't good.
[1:15:43.980 --> 1:15:45.980]  You're not a good species.
[1:15:45.980 --> 1:15:47.980]  We're going to make you become silicon.
[1:15:47.980 --> 1:15:51.980]  Those either lucky enough to live doesn't sound too human to me.
[1:15:51.980 --> 1:16:17.980]  Doesn't sound like the good guys.
[1:16:17.980 --> 1:16:45.980]  It is.
[1:16:45.980 --> 1:16:48.340]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[1:16:48.340 --> 1:16:51.500]  So the biggest sale in InfoWars history is going right now.
[1:16:51.500 --> 1:16:54.660]  The mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off,
[1:16:54.660 --> 1:16:58.020]  getting credible products and keep InfoWars as strong as ever.
[1:16:59.940 --> 1:17:01.660]  Taking advantage of one of nature's
[1:17:01.660 --> 1:17:03.940]  most nutrient dense ingredients,
[1:17:03.940 --> 1:17:07.460]  VasoBeat will be your new favorite InfoWars life formula.
[1:17:09.740 --> 1:17:11.900]  Using only water and beetroot,
[1:17:11.900 --> 1:17:14.740]  VasoBeat is the most concentrated liquid extract
[1:17:14.740 --> 1:17:16.060]  to feed on the market.
[1:17:18.620 --> 1:17:20.620]  With concentrated beet extract,
[1:17:20.620 --> 1:17:23.420]  you can get the high levels of betaine, nitrates,
[1:17:23.420 --> 1:17:27.100]  and antioxidants you want to help support a healthy liver,
[1:17:27.100 --> 1:17:29.900]  athletic performance, blood vessels, and more.
[1:17:33.700 --> 1:17:35.700]  Don't overlook the power of beetroot.
[1:17:35.700 --> 1:17:38.500]  Get your naturally occurring potassium, folate,
[1:17:38.500 --> 1:17:47.140]  vitamin C, iron, selenium, zinc, vitamin K, and more.
[1:17:47.140 --> 1:17:49.980]  With one of nature's greatest treasures in VasoBeat
[1:17:49.980 --> 1:17:51.580]  from InfoWars life today.
[1:17:58.580 --> 1:18:01.300]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago
[1:18:01.300 --> 1:18:02.780]  were very public about their plans.
[1:18:02.780 --> 1:18:04.220]  They financed major universities.
[1:18:04.220 --> 1:18:08.100]  They ran full page stories and advertisements
[1:18:08.100 --> 1:18:10.060]  pushing their propaganda of the New York Times,
[1:18:10.060 --> 1:18:11.660]  other major newspapers.
[1:18:11.660 --> 1:18:14.660]  That the family, as we know it, is a bad thing
[1:18:14.660 --> 1:18:15.980]  and must be ended.
[1:18:15.980 --> 1:18:18.140]  And the first step in that is getting women
[1:18:18.140 --> 1:18:20.460]  out of the household and teaching women
[1:18:20.460 --> 1:18:23.260]  that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons
[1:18:23.260 --> 1:18:25.580]  and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[1:18:25.580 --> 1:18:28.100]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner
[1:18:28.100 --> 1:18:29.980]  for my daughter, my four national daughter,
[1:18:29.980 --> 1:18:31.740]  and my wife makes dinner a lot of times.
[1:18:31.740 --> 1:18:32.700]  But I like to make it as well.
[1:18:32.700 --> 1:18:34.100]  I love to make breakfast.
[1:18:34.100 --> 1:18:36.340]  And literally, it's the funnest thing on earth
[1:18:36.340 --> 1:18:37.980]  to make food for your family.
[1:18:37.980 --> 1:18:41.140]  And be nurturative and then all sit down together
[1:18:41.140 --> 1:18:43.060]  and have the communal event.
[1:18:43.060 --> 1:18:46.500]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding
[1:18:46.500 --> 1:18:49.420]  is our normal biological actions are coming together.
[1:18:49.420 --> 1:18:53.300]  They really are a sick, evil, scientific cult of filth
[1:18:53.300 --> 1:18:56.060]  that will domesticate us and turn us into lab rats.
[1:18:56.060 --> 1:18:58.300]  We cannot let this continue.
[1:18:58.300 --> 1:19:01.220]  The first 10 amendments to our country's constitution
[1:19:01.220 --> 1:19:03.580]  were adopted in 1791.
[1:19:03.580 --> 1:19:05.300]  The first of these broadly protects
[1:19:05.300 --> 1:19:08.420]  the rights of free speech and free press.
[1:19:08.420 --> 1:19:11.460]  Free speech means the free and public expression
[1:19:11.460 --> 1:19:14.820]  of opinions without censorship, interference,
[1:19:14.820 --> 1:19:17.340]  and restraint by the government.
[1:19:17.340 --> 1:19:20.940]  231 years later, free speech across America
[1:19:20.940 --> 1:19:24.020]  is under chronic and insidious attack.
[1:19:24.020 --> 1:19:26.380]  GCN is under attack.
[1:19:26.380 --> 1:19:28.140]  Your freedom is currently under siege
[1:19:28.140 --> 1:19:31.180]  from those who do not want you to know the truth.
[1:19:31.180 --> 1:19:34.300]  I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you
[1:19:34.300 --> 1:19:37.220]  to rise up and help us defend our right
[1:19:37.220 --> 1:19:39.420]  to continue telling you the truth.
[1:19:39.420 --> 1:19:40.860]  Would you like to join us?
[1:19:40.860 --> 1:19:45.860]  If so, please consider visiting savegcn.com.
[1:19:45.940 --> 1:19:49.140]  Savegcn.com.
[1:19:49.140 --> 1:19:53.580]  You may click follow, share, give, and pray.
[1:19:53.580 --> 1:19:55.740]  You may select all of those choices.
[1:19:55.740 --> 1:19:57.220]  I'm Vincent Finnelli.
[1:19:57.220 --> 1:20:02.180]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:20:02.180 --> 1:20:28.180]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:32.180 --> 1:20:53.780]  So now the White House is coming on and telling us
[1:20:53.780 --> 1:20:57.580]  the next thing we told you a month ago they would do.
[1:20:57.580 --> 1:21:00.540]  Russia is going to cyber attack the US.
[1:21:00.540 --> 1:21:03.180]  And so any cyber attack carried out by the Davos group
[1:21:03.180 --> 1:21:08.580]  or the globalists of the CIA or Ukraine, anybody,
[1:21:08.580 --> 1:21:10.300]  it'll be routed through Russian computers.
[1:21:10.300 --> 1:21:12.500]  Anybody can do that and frame somebody.
[1:21:12.500 --> 1:21:13.980]  Well, then now that's an act of war
[1:21:13.980 --> 1:21:17.740]  and we've got to have NATO start attacking the Russians.
[1:21:17.740 --> 1:21:25.340]  So here's White House expert on Russia putting this BS out.
[1:21:25.340 --> 1:21:28.820]  Urging private sector partners to take immediate action
[1:21:28.820 --> 1:21:33.500]  to shore up their defenses against potential cyber attacks.
[1:21:33.500 --> 1:21:36.340]  We've previously warned about the potential for Russia
[1:21:36.340 --> 1:21:39.460]  to conduct cyber attacks against the United States,
[1:21:39.460 --> 1:21:44.180]  including as a response to the unprecedented economic costs
[1:21:44.180 --> 1:21:46.940]  that the US and allies and partners impose
[1:21:46.940 --> 1:21:51.020]  in response to Russia's further invasion of Ukraine.
[1:21:51.020 --> 1:21:54.180]  Today, we are reiterating those warnings.
[1:21:54.180 --> 1:21:57.820]  And we're doing so based on evolving threat intelligence
[1:21:57.820 --> 1:22:00.620]  that the Russian government is exploring options
[1:22:00.620 --> 1:22:03.860]  for potential cyber attacks on critical infrastructure
[1:22:03.860 --> 1:22:07.060]  in the United States.
[1:22:07.060 --> 1:22:11.980]  You know, Nigel Farage came out many, many times
[1:22:11.980 --> 1:22:14.700]  when the West helped overthrow the Ukrainian government
[1:22:14.700 --> 1:22:18.060]  and George Soros bragged about it eight years ago
[1:22:18.060 --> 1:22:20.780]  and said it's going to lead to war with Russia.
[1:22:20.780 --> 1:22:25.500]  And then literally, I have here in the stack dozens of articles
[1:22:25.500 --> 1:22:29.620]  that we've reprinted from the New York Times, the Washington Post,
[1:22:29.620 --> 1:22:33.140]  Time Magazine, Newsweek, TV shows on the History Channel,
[1:22:33.140 --> 1:22:37.540]  Discovery Channel, about the main political party
[1:22:37.540 --> 1:22:41.260]  that helped overthrow the Russians being Nazis in Ukraine.
[1:22:41.260 --> 1:22:44.940]  And now you say that, they go, oh, no, Zelensky's Jewish
[1:22:44.940 --> 1:22:48.540]  when he wears an iron cross on his shirt.
[1:22:48.540 --> 1:22:51.140]  And I'm not saying iron crosses are always Nazi.
[1:22:51.140 --> 1:22:53.340]  They predate the Nazis, but the Nazis also used them.
[1:22:53.340 --> 1:22:55.500]  It's just a German medal for valor.
[1:22:55.500 --> 1:22:59.220]  But that is one of the symbols of one of the Nazi battalions
[1:22:59.220 --> 1:23:02.060]  there, the specific one he's wearing.
[1:23:02.060 --> 1:23:05.020]  So this is a Psyop, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:23:05.020 --> 1:23:06.620]  Here's Nigel Farage when he was still
[1:23:06.620 --> 1:23:09.700]  in the European Union Parliament seven years ago.
[1:23:09.700 --> 1:23:12.540]  A provocation of Vladimir Putin.
[1:23:12.540 --> 1:23:15.220]  This EU empire ever seeking to expand
[1:23:15.220 --> 1:23:19.580]  stated its territorial claim on the Ukraine some years ago.
[1:23:19.580 --> 1:23:22.380]  Just to make that worse, of course, some NATO members
[1:23:22.380 --> 1:23:26.340]  said they too would like the Ukraine to join NATO.
[1:23:26.340 --> 1:23:30.220]  We directly encouraged the uprising in the Ukraine
[1:23:30.220 --> 1:23:34.420]  that led to the toppling of the President Yanukovych.
[1:23:34.420 --> 1:23:38.620]  And that led, of course, in turn, to Vladimir Putin reacting.
[1:23:38.620 --> 1:23:42.100]  And the moral of the story is if you poke the Russian bear
[1:23:42.100 --> 1:23:46.020]  with a stick, don't be surprised when he reacts.
[1:23:46.020 --> 1:23:49.740]  Now, just to continue with that, today we
[1:23:49.740 --> 1:23:52.780]  are rushing through an association agreement
[1:23:52.780 --> 1:23:55.060]  at undue speed with the Ukraine.
[1:23:55.060 --> 1:23:58.860]  And as we speak, there are NATO soldiers engaged
[1:23:58.860 --> 1:24:01.260]  in military exercises in the Ukraine.
[1:24:01.260 --> 1:24:04.140]  Have we taken leave of our senses?
[1:24:04.140 --> 1:24:07.140]  Do we actually want to have a war with Putin?
[1:24:07.140 --> 1:24:09.060]  Because if we do, we're certainly
[1:24:09.060 --> 1:24:11.140]  going about it the right way.
[1:24:11.140 --> 1:24:13.780]  Perhaps we ought to recognize that the West now
[1:24:13.780 --> 1:24:17.860]  faces the biggest threat and crisis to our way of life
[1:24:17.860 --> 1:24:21.180]  that we have seen for over 70 years.
[1:24:21.180 --> 1:24:24.700]  The recent beheadings of the British and American hostages
[1:24:24.700 --> 1:24:26.860]  graphically illustrates the problem.
[1:24:26.860 --> 1:24:28.500]  And, of course, we have our own citizens
[1:24:28.500 --> 1:24:31.660]  from our own countries engaged in that struggle, too.
[1:24:31.660 --> 1:24:35.740]  In the war against Islamic extremism, Vladimir Putin,
[1:24:35.740 --> 1:24:38.100]  whatever we may think of him as a human being,
[1:24:38.100 --> 1:24:40.620]  is actually on our side.
[1:24:40.620 --> 1:24:42.540]  I suggest we grow up.
[1:24:42.540 --> 1:24:45.100]  I suggest we recognize the real threat
[1:24:45.100 --> 1:24:48.620]  facing all of our countries, communities, and societies.
[1:24:48.620 --> 1:24:51.460]  We stop playing war games in the Ukraine.
[1:24:51.460 --> 1:24:55.460]  And we start to prepare a plan to help countries like Syria,
[1:24:55.460 --> 1:24:58.780]  like Iraq, like Kenya, like, indeed, Nigeria,
[1:24:58.780 --> 1:25:01.220]  to try and help them to deal with the real threat that
[1:25:01.220 --> 1:25:01.980]  faces us.
[1:25:01.980 --> 1:25:04.220]  Let's not go on provoking Putin,
[1:25:04.220 --> 1:25:06.740]  whether we like him or not.
[1:25:06.740 --> 1:25:08.900]  Well, that's a real leader right there, tomorrow's news,
[1:25:08.900 --> 1:25:09.660]  to say.
[1:25:09.660 --> 1:25:11.580]  And, of course, let's not forget Biden last night
[1:25:11.580 --> 1:25:12.900]  announced a new world order.
[1:25:12.900 --> 1:25:15.580]  Global governance is what they're talking about.
[1:25:15.580 --> 1:25:18.660]  Run by them will come out of this Russia conflict.
[1:25:18.660 --> 1:25:22.460]  And America is leading the new world order.
[1:25:22.460 --> 1:25:26.380]  An inflection point, I believe, in the world economy,
[1:25:26.380 --> 1:25:28.140]  not just the world economy in the world.
[1:25:28.140 --> 1:25:31.620]  It occurs every three or four generations.
[1:25:31.620 --> 1:25:35.380]  As one of the top military people said to me
[1:25:35.380 --> 1:25:38.340]  in a secure meeting the other day,
[1:25:38.340 --> 1:25:43.460]  60 million people died between 1900 and 1946.
[1:25:43.460 --> 1:25:47.140]  And since then, we've established a liberal world order.
[1:25:47.140 --> 1:25:49.420]  And that hadn't happened in a long while.
[1:25:49.420 --> 1:25:52.540]  A lot of people died, but nowhere near the chaos.
[1:25:52.540 --> 1:25:54.900]  And now is the time when things are shifting.
[1:25:54.900 --> 1:25:57.620]  We're going to be a new world order out there.
[1:25:57.620 --> 1:25:58.940]  And we've got to lead it.
[1:25:58.940 --> 1:26:01.780]  We've got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.
[1:26:01.780 --> 1:26:02.660]  So anyway.
[1:26:02.660 --> 1:26:04.020]  And what is this new world order?
[1:26:04.020 --> 1:26:06.500]  You eat bugs, you drink sewage, you own nothing,
[1:26:06.500 --> 1:26:08.060]  you have nothing, you can't travel.
[1:26:08.060 --> 1:26:09.380]  If you're allowed to live,
[1:26:09.380 --> 1:26:11.460]  you live in a 200 square foot coffin apartment.
[1:26:11.460 --> 1:26:13.700]  I mean, that's all what they're announcing
[1:26:13.700 --> 1:26:14.580]  here in the headlines.
[1:26:14.580 --> 1:26:16.020]  And I told you, they're going to use coronavirus
[1:26:16.020 --> 1:26:17.740]  for their global ID and control.
[1:26:17.740 --> 1:26:19.620]  And then they're going to use the war
[1:26:19.620 --> 1:26:22.020]  and the sanctions and all of that
[1:26:22.020 --> 1:26:23.380]  for an electronic tracking system.
[1:26:23.380 --> 1:26:24.980]  And now they're on the news.
[1:26:24.980 --> 1:26:26.060]  Klaus Schwab is admitting,
[1:26:26.060 --> 1:26:29.180]  we will use this war to bring in the new world ID.
[1:26:29.180 --> 1:26:30.740]  It is upon us now.
[1:26:30.740 --> 1:26:32.460]  We are the lighthouse of the future.
[1:26:32.460 --> 1:26:34.020]  China is the model.
[1:26:34.020 --> 1:26:37.820]  Coronavirus and the case for one world government, the weak.
[1:26:38.860 --> 1:26:42.100]  Financial Times of London and now for world government.
[1:26:44.500 --> 1:26:47.620]  The UN's warning worst food crisis in history from the war.
[1:26:47.620 --> 1:26:49.340]  You mean the great reset.
[1:26:49.340 --> 1:26:53.900]  WFWF warns, ominous warning over coming food crisis
[1:26:53.900 --> 1:26:56.860]  recommends more sustainable diets.
[1:26:58.340 --> 1:27:01.180]  Ukraine war threats to cause a global food crisis.
[1:27:01.180 --> 1:27:02.340]  No, they caused it.
[1:27:02.340 --> 1:27:05.100]  Now they're going to pose as the damn saviors
[1:27:05.100 --> 1:27:06.380]  while they did it.
[1:27:06.380 --> 1:27:08.660]  And they bring in their climate lockdowns.
[1:27:10.220 --> 1:27:11.340]  Food rationing.
[1:27:13.300 --> 1:27:15.340]  World needs the equivalent of pandemic lockdowns
[1:27:15.340 --> 1:27:17.020]  every two years to meet Paris.
[1:27:17.020 --> 1:27:18.860]  Carbon emissions, Forbes.
[1:27:20.220 --> 1:27:22.180]  Lockdown, size, emission cuts.
[1:27:22.180 --> 1:27:25.780]  It's every two years to combat climate change.
[1:27:25.780 --> 1:27:27.820]  Then it'll be every month of lockdown.
[1:27:27.820 --> 1:27:30.420]  Eco watch, equivalent of COVID emissions
[1:27:30.420 --> 1:27:33.220]  drop every two years.
[1:27:34.100 --> 1:27:37.300]  Singapore to benefit from carbon credit training platform
[1:27:37.300 --> 1:27:39.860]  on and on and on.
[1:27:42.420 --> 1:27:44.580]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:27:44.580 --> 1:27:45.660]  that they're just doing this
[1:27:45.660 --> 1:27:47.740]  and then here's the new article all over the news.
[1:27:47.740 --> 1:27:50.140]  Jerusalem Post had this version.
[1:27:50.140 --> 1:27:53.220]  Pumpkin seeds and maggots, the meat of the future.
[1:27:54.500 --> 1:27:55.700]  Here it is right here.
[1:27:55.700 --> 1:27:59.620]  Pumpkin seeds and fly larva, what a nice name.
[1:27:59.620 --> 1:28:01.460]  The meat of the future.
[1:28:01.460 --> 1:28:04.740]  Maggots, the new beef, the new white meat.
[1:28:06.660 --> 1:28:09.980]  Murder your dog and cat, MSM officially calls
[1:28:09.980 --> 1:28:12.980]  for extermination of your pets to save the earth.
[1:28:12.980 --> 1:28:14.820]  They got to get you ready for the collapse
[1:28:14.820 --> 1:28:16.580]  and that they're the good guys
[1:28:16.580 --> 1:28:20.380]  that told you it was coming to save the world,
[1:28:20.380 --> 1:28:23.020]  kill your dog and cat and eat bugs,
[1:28:23.020 --> 1:28:28.020]  says the Jeffrey Epstein alumnus owner of the Atlantic.
[1:28:28.020 --> 1:28:31.940]  The lady that owns it tells you pedophilia is not bad
[1:28:31.940 --> 1:28:33.500]  but it also doesn't exist
[1:28:33.500 --> 1:28:35.140]  and she's a favorite out at Epstein,
[1:28:35.140 --> 1:28:37.460]  Pito Island, Steve Jobs' wife.
[1:28:39.700 --> 1:28:43.700]  Savannah Hernandez takes us into the Pito rabbit hole.
[1:28:43.700 --> 1:28:45.260]  That's what all this transgenderism is about,
[1:28:45.260 --> 1:28:47.580]  targeting children, sexualization of children
[1:28:47.580 --> 1:28:51.580]  and so much more on the other side, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:28:51.580 --> 1:28:53.740]  And one of our biggest problems is so-called
[1:28:53.740 --> 1:28:56.420]  conservative leaders that go along.
[1:28:56.420 --> 1:28:58.860]  Our world is so full of hype.
[1:28:58.860 --> 1:29:02.060]  We are force-fed, dehumanizing propaganda
[1:29:02.060 --> 1:29:03.300]  by the corporate media,
[1:29:03.300 --> 1:29:06.100]  by the controlled churches and the universities.
[1:29:06.100 --> 1:29:07.940]  And why is this the case?
[1:29:07.940 --> 1:29:10.340]  Because we innately, by God,
[1:29:10.340 --> 1:29:12.540]  have been given the keys to our own minds,
[1:29:12.540 --> 1:29:14.340]  our own psyches, our own souls.
[1:29:14.340 --> 1:29:17.340]  And by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves
[1:29:17.340 --> 1:29:21.540]  and transcend the quote, fallen or sinful state.
[1:29:21.540 --> 1:29:23.820]  So the chemicals that we ingest
[1:29:23.820 --> 1:29:25.660]  and all the things that we try to do
[1:29:25.660 --> 1:29:27.900]  and all the things that we try to bring into our bodies
[1:29:27.900 --> 1:29:31.460]  to change who we are, are only lowering us.
[1:29:31.460 --> 1:29:33.140]  They're only making us more depressed.
[1:29:33.140 --> 1:29:35.540]  From the end, they're only making us less filled.
[1:29:35.540 --> 1:29:37.660]  It is only by going within
[1:29:37.660 --> 1:29:38.900]  and really making that connection to God
[1:29:38.900 --> 1:29:41.180]  that we can truly empower ourselves.
[1:29:41.180 --> 1:29:42.860]  That's why the globalist, bombardist,
[1:29:42.860 --> 1:29:45.100]  and toxins and chemicals to block us
[1:29:45.100 --> 1:29:47.180]  getting the normal vitamins and minerals
[1:29:47.180 --> 1:29:49.860]  and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy
[1:29:49.860 --> 1:29:52.460]  and to be able to basically reach out
[1:29:52.460 --> 1:29:53.860]  beyond the third dimension.
[1:29:53.860 --> 1:29:55.540]  And that's where the incredible products come in
[1:29:55.540 --> 1:29:56.820]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:29:57.900 --> 1:30:01.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com
[1:30:01.100 --> 1:30:03.660]  is offering the biggest sales
[1:30:03.660 --> 1:30:06.900]  in its over 20 year history.
[1:30:06.900 --> 1:30:09.820]  And that is because the economy is breaking down
[1:30:09.820 --> 1:30:13.340]  inflation is exploding, the supply chains have broken down
[1:30:13.340 --> 1:30:16.380]  and info wars is having serious trouble
[1:30:16.380 --> 1:30:18.500]  making its payroll and paying for operations.
[1:30:18.500 --> 1:30:21.420]  And I do not want to implode or downsize
[1:30:21.420 --> 1:30:23.820]  in the face of the globalist making their main move.
[1:30:23.820 --> 1:30:25.580]  In full wars, it's paradoxical.
[1:30:25.580 --> 1:30:27.020]  It's more popular than ever.
[1:30:27.020 --> 1:30:28.620]  It is reaching more people than ever
[1:30:28.620 --> 1:30:29.900]  despite the censorship.
[1:30:29.900 --> 1:30:31.980]  But because of cost increasing
[1:30:31.980 --> 1:30:33.260]  and having to run our own infrastructure
[1:30:33.260 --> 1:30:35.180]  and paying for our own bandwidth, everything else,
[1:30:35.180 --> 1:30:37.380]  we are running out of money.

[1:30:46.700 --> 1:30:49.420]  On supplements, on books, on films,

[1:30:55.820 --> 1:30:57.500]  Thank you for your support.
[1:30:57.500 --> 1:31:00.460]  It has been noted by many a historian
[1:31:00.460 --> 1:31:03.980]  the first casualty of war is the truth.
[1:31:03.980 --> 1:31:08.660]  Then the next big casualty isn't even the people that die.
[1:31:08.660 --> 1:31:10.780]  No, that invariably follows.
[1:31:10.780 --> 1:31:14.620]  But first there is the crackdown on populations,
[1:31:14.620 --> 1:31:19.060]  basic liberty and speech and massive censorship.
[1:31:19.060 --> 1:31:22.260]  And now across the world from the United States to Europe
[1:31:22.260 --> 1:31:24.820]  legislation is being introduced
[1:31:24.820 --> 1:31:29.820]  that if you amplify any quote pro-Russian information
[1:31:31.420 --> 1:31:34.660]  you can be censored, you can be arrested,
[1:31:34.660 --> 1:31:36.020]  you can be imprisoned.
[1:31:36.020 --> 1:31:38.860]  And of course now Canada is under this legislation
[1:31:38.860 --> 1:31:41.500]  that if you have a thought crime
[1:31:41.500 --> 1:31:44.620]  and they think you may have the intent to engage
[1:31:44.620 --> 1:31:46.500]  in hate speech online
[1:31:46.500 --> 1:31:48.780]  that you will be censored and arrested.
[1:31:48.780 --> 1:31:50.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism
[1:31:50.900 --> 1:31:53.340]  is being carried out by the globalists around the world
[1:31:53.340 --> 1:31:54.660]  against humanity.
[1:31:54.660 --> 1:31:57.380]  That makes infowarstore.com more important than ever.

[1:33:16.200 --> 1:33:27.080]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:33:31.880 --> 1:33:41.640]  well if you're a championship female swimmer or weightlifter or sprinter
[1:33:41.640 --> 1:33:49.960]  it doesn't matter a man who can't win in men's sports can just say he's a woman
[1:33:51.960 --> 1:33:57.240]  and he can then come and he can win the gold medal and then if you file a complaint
[1:33:57.960 --> 1:34:05.880]  and say he has sports enhancing tessels well then you get banned on twitter and your videos
[1:34:05.880 --> 1:34:10.840]  get taken down savannah hernandez is here to give us the backside of the story it was on
[1:34:10.840 --> 1:34:16.840]  tucker carlson's show and then i guess that upset them that her clip with this young lady this swimmer
[1:34:16.840 --> 1:34:21.640]  was there this lady filed a complaint she got a lot of heat and so savannah's got the banned
[1:34:21.640 --> 1:34:27.320]  clip here as well so savannah you're the expert on the ground there doing great work over there for
[1:34:28.040 --> 1:34:35.560]  trumps truth social out there on the street tell us the story and the details here because
[1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:41.880]  as if this transgender men taking over women's spaces adult men and in children girl showers
[1:34:41.880 --> 1:34:47.320]  as if all this isn't insane enough now the women aren't allowed to complain by the big tech bullies
[1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:53.480]  so they're caught in a big pincer attack tell us about it yeah alex so first off when i went and
[1:34:53.480 --> 1:34:58.440]  covered the ncda championship this was the first time that i've ever watched a women's swimming
[1:34:58.440 --> 1:35:04.120]  competition and watching leah thomas compete was absolutely insane he took off like a rocket none
[1:35:04.120 --> 1:35:10.440]  of the other females even stood a chance all of the parents in attendance behind me visibly upset
[1:35:10.440 --> 1:35:15.400]  people were not happy that leah thomas was swimming at all and of course i heard from
[1:35:15.400 --> 1:35:20.360]  parents too that the ncda athletes were told that they were not allowed to mention leah thomas
[1:35:20.360 --> 1:35:25.160]  his name to the media they weren't even allowed to mention his name in the locker room so it took
[1:35:25.160 --> 1:35:30.040]  a lot for me to find an athlete that was willing to speak out against him i finally found one her
[1:35:30.040 --> 1:35:35.720]  name was rose pouch and the reason why she spoke to me is because her teammate broke down in tears
[1:35:35.720 --> 1:35:41.880]  because she was at number 17 now 16 people can make it to the finals she was 17th she was a
[1:35:41.880 --> 1:35:47.560]  fifth year senior so this was her last ncda her teammate broke down in tears and so rose decided
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:53.640]  to share her story with me now the clip immediately went viral tucker carlson played it on his show
[1:35:53.640 --> 1:35:58.360]  and what ended up happening was andy know was sending me so many twitter accounts that were
[1:35:58.360 --> 1:36:02.840]  antifa twitter accounts saying oh this is savannah hernandez this is a van evasion account she needs
[1:36:02.840 --> 1:36:07.800]  to be deleted because she's drumming up hate against leah thomas so this was a targeted attack
[1:36:07.800 --> 1:36:13.720]  to take down my footage exposing leah thomas for the man that he is taking away from female sports
[1:36:13.720 --> 1:36:19.240]  and i also exposed the lgbtq community that was across the street looking like absolute fools
[1:36:19.240 --> 1:36:24.760]  saying that women can get pe- yeah that women have penises that men can get periods it's so
[1:36:24.760 --> 1:36:29.960]  confusing that i can barely even keep up with it so i exposed the lgbtq community we exposed
[1:36:29.960 --> 1:36:35.080]  leah thomas we made national news and what happened twitter of course deleted and censored all of the
[1:36:35.080 --> 1:36:39.880]  footage because they are in charge of the narrative they are allowed to dictate our reality and that's
[1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:45.400]  exactly what they did by deleting this footage that's right so here is the censored footage not
[1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:52.520]  only did they disqualify this woman who would have been qualified if it wasn't for this man
[1:36:52.520 --> 1:36:56.280]  now they have banned her and blocked her and abandoned the video here it is
[1:36:56.280 --> 1:37:00.360]  you're a virgini tech swimmer what did you think about leah thomas competing today as a swimmer
[1:37:00.360 --> 1:37:05.080]  in this competition um what are you feeling what are other athletes feeling it's a common
[1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:10.280]  conception that we are all very disappointed and frustrated with someone who is has capabilities
[1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:15.400]  more than us women have to be able to compete at this level and take opportunities away from other
[1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:19.480]  women like i have a teammate who did not make finals today because she was just bumped out of
[1:37:19.480 --> 1:37:25.000]  finals and it's heartbreaking to see someone who went through puberty as a male and has the body of
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:30.680]  a male be able to absolutely blow away the competition and you go into it with a mindset
[1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:36.280]  that you are you don't have a chance if that makes sense like it's hard to compete against someone
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:42.360]  with the aerobic capacity the muscle development the body of a man it's hard it's hard to think
[1:37:42.360 --> 1:37:49.720]  about it like that and staying positive i bet for other swimmers who are in that uh he is probably
[1:37:49.720 --> 1:37:54.440]  overwhelming i i'm not sure i can't speak for them but it's disappointing to see and frustrating
[1:37:54.440 --> 1:37:59.880]  definitely and you said that one of your teammates was crying today because she didn't make the finals
[1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:07.160]  uh you said that she was 17th and there were 16 spots so leah thomas took one of those spots
[1:38:07.160 --> 1:38:12.040]  talked to us about what your teammate was going through and that experience she was very emotional
[1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:17.240]  and it's hard to see because it's her last ncda's and um she really loves that race and it was just
[1:38:17.240 --> 1:38:21.000]  heartbreaking to see that she put all her effort into it today and went the best time that she's
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:26.360]  went in a morning session before and still not make it back yeah it's hard to see someone who
[1:38:26.360 --> 1:38:33.800]  works every day every night still not be able to compete against someone like that now what this is
[1:38:33.800 --> 1:38:38.600]  is behavioral psychologists at the tabascon institute admit they're doing this that it will
[1:38:38.600 --> 1:38:43.000]  accept men being women and women being men and and pedophiles having access to our children
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:50.760]  in the schools will accept anything they want to suspend logic in common sense and so not only
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:56.600]  the absurdity of this but also the teachers and the professors and the parents and the swimmers
[1:38:56.600 --> 1:39:03.000]  told keep your mouth shut go along with this or you'll get in trouble where's the first amendment
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:07.880]  so this is all a teaching tool for everybody that you're going to believe the absurd and you're not
[1:39:07.880 --> 1:39:15.080]  going to criticize it or you'll be punished in the real world and in cyberspace this is the big
[1:39:15.080 --> 1:39:20.520]  corporate rollout plan and more and more scientists savannah and others are pointing out that this is
[1:39:20.520 --> 1:39:25.480]  the targeting of children to sexualize them where they tell five and even three and four-year-olds
[1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:30.360]  you're really a boy when you're a girl or you're really a girl when you're a boy and then the state
[1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:37.000]  says oh your child wants to be a girl or boy a different sex and forms a government relationship
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:43.720]  up with your child outside of parental rights to screw your kid up so the pedophiles are running
[1:39:43.720 --> 1:39:48.440]  this movement to sexualize children and it's come out now and a lot of idiots are signed onto it
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:53.320]  thinking it's the new thing you know the new liberal thing to support when what it is is the
[1:39:53.320 --> 1:39:59.400]  destruction of our species exactly alex and again too what i want to reiterate is i'm not mad about
[1:39:59.400 --> 1:40:03.880]  my twitter account being silenced or censored i'm mad about the fact that it took a lot of courage
[1:40:03.880 --> 1:40:09.080]  for this ncda athlete to even speak out against the atomis because she was feeling pressure from
[1:40:09.080 --> 1:40:15.080]  not only the ncda but coaches teammates from the entire organization so on top of her just you
[1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:20.200]  know needing to be strong enough to actually get this message out and push back against the entire
[1:40:20.200 --> 1:40:25.800]  society that was trying to silence her then big tech still comes in doubles down deletes the message
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:31.240]  rewrites national news rewrites history and it's absolutely disgusting to see so like you said alex
[1:40:31.240 --> 1:40:36.680]  this is a target of our children and we see how these swimmers are being treated we see how anyone
[1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:41.080]  in the modern day is being treated if they say something as simple as men can't get periods and
[1:40:41.080 --> 1:40:45.160]  men can't get pregnant you get mobbed in the street for saying that you get told that you're the crazy
[1:40:45.160 --> 1:40:49.640]  one you get told that you are big at your racist pick a name in the book you were that now if you
[1:40:49.640 --> 1:40:56.360]  think in that you know actual biological science is a thing so it's absolutely insane to see what
[1:40:56.360 --> 1:41:01.160]  is going on in the modern day and it's disgusting to me that we had grown adults who were standing
[1:41:01.160 --> 1:41:07.160]  up for leo thomas and clapping and happy that this biological male came in and annihilated
[1:41:07.160 --> 1:41:14.040]  these women at their own competition well they've had mma fighters that are males kill females
[1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:18.440]  men are not supposed to be fighting women men are supposed to be fighting men that's how it's
[1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:24.360]  designed that's what's programmed into us for a reason now when we come back i've got a clip
[1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:30.040]  but you were there seeing this of big biological men dressed up in their clown outfits their wigs
[1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:35.720]  wigs trying to get into the women's bathrooms where women and children were uh this is this is
[1:41:35.720 --> 1:41:43.800]  just this clown show is going to the next level what else did you witness honestly the saddest
[1:41:43.800 --> 1:41:50.040]  thing for me to witness alex was these athletes and their parents if anything really upset that
[1:41:50.040 --> 1:41:56.040]  leo thomas was swimming upset that this gigantic hulking man again i saw leo thomas with my own
[1:41:56.040 --> 1:42:02.120]  two eyes next to the female competitors he's a big man he's humongous okay the all yeah put some
[1:42:02.120 --> 1:42:06.280]  photos of him up here and look look they said took a curl some photoshop this i went and found the
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:12.440]  actual getty photo he's not even tucking his shlong here i mean he's got a you know pretty big
[1:42:12.440 --> 1:42:18.280]  package there this is a joke exactly alex and all of the lgbtq people who were promoting leo i asked
[1:42:18.280 --> 1:42:24.040]  them hey have you seen leo thomas stand next to his competitors stand next to actual females and
[1:42:24.040 --> 1:42:28.600]  can you see a biological difference you know what their answer was alex they said well i haven't
[1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:35.000]  actually seen leo thomas stand next to a female so the people who are advocating for this man
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:39.080]  don't even know what they're talking about don't even know what he looks like in comparison to an
[1:42:39.080 --> 1:42:43.000]  actual biological female well you know what the answer is i want to talk about the answer when we
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:49.320]  come back but i think the family's the alumni everybody needs to just walk off and let these

[1:46:34.760 --> 1:46:41.640]  their world's gonna end in 2030 carbon tax global warming bull all of it and none of it can succeed
[1:46:41.640 --> 1:46:47.800]  none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit that's why
[1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:52.440]  truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence and that's why it's hard
[1:46:52.440 --> 1:46:56.920]  to share in full wars links and band up video links that's why we've got to share them now more than
[1:46:56.920 --> 1:47:05.320]  ever leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:47:15.320 --> 1:47:22.760]  welcome to my show this is footage for tv viewers radio listeners of the ncaa women's
[1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:27.160]  championship that was won by a man that stand on end us was just dead and now if you try to
[1:47:27.160 --> 1:47:32.840]  criticize it put a video out you get banned on cyberspace and the college is saying how dare
[1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:39.560]  anyone question this as we enter north korean type territory here is a clip of kelly j keen
[1:47:40.760 --> 1:47:46.200]  tried to block a frankenstein looking man with a wig on from entering i guess the women's locker
[1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:57.000]  rooms here it is
[1:47:59.640 --> 1:48:05.800]  and the other women i am with are very comfortable with me right well fortunately i'm not your
[1:48:05.800 --> 1:48:16.760]  daughter and my daughter is also not your daughter and she would feel she would feel very uncomfortable
[1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:28.360]  i would like to call if you're not i'm asking you of the mother do not use female spaces
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:38.040]  and i'm very uncomfortable as a mother i am very you're not you'll never birthed your children
[1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:44.280]  right not a mother dog i'm just a job of mine which is i was asking you she's like our girls we're
[1:48:44.280 --> 1:48:48.840]  going in your bathroom and when they're recruiting in the public schools brainwashing mainly autistic
[1:48:48.840 --> 1:48:53.400]  and mentally retarded children in my view we know it's true this is just pedophile grooming of
[1:48:53.400 --> 1:48:58.760]  children uh the sexualization of children bill mars said it he said disayness is right there
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:02.840]  should be a law that you don't teach five-year-olds there another sex you shouldn't be talking to
[1:49:02.840 --> 1:49:09.320]  kids about sex unless you're trying to basically groom them savannah and andez you got to go
[1:49:09.320 --> 1:49:13.000]  to their interview here about five minutes where else do you see all this going now
[1:49:14.600 --> 1:49:19.560]  honestly alex like you talked about we really need to start to be a part of the solution
[1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:25.320]  if women truly do not want men in their spaces playing in their sports they need to stand up
[1:49:25.320 --> 1:49:29.960]  against this they need to have their voices heard and they need to stop participating in events that
[1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:35.080]  men are competing in because that's the only way that we push back against this the only way for us
[1:49:35.080 --> 1:49:41.160]  to actually put this to an end and put this to a stop is to stop participating in this clown world
[1:49:41.160 --> 1:49:46.280]  nonsense you guys really did coin the term clown world and if you look around what's going on right
[1:49:46.280 --> 1:49:51.400]  now that's exactly what we're living through so it really was heartbreaking to see these biological
[1:49:51.400 --> 1:49:56.760]  males coming in and trying to not only erase women's sports but erase women as a whole try
[1:49:56.760 --> 1:50:01.560]  to say that men can have periods men can give birth and men understand what it means and what
[1:50:01.560 --> 1:50:06.680]  it feels like to be a woman they absolutely have no idea and it's disgusting that you know women
[1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:12.280]  are being completely erased so the real biological women like you said alex need to stand up against
[1:50:12.280 --> 1:50:17.480]  this and stop participating in this mental illness because that's exactly what it is
[1:50:17.480 --> 1:50:22.280]  and again alex thank you for being at the forefront of exposing this and being one of the first
[1:50:22.280 --> 1:50:28.360]  people to actually you know point this out and call it out for what it is mental illness insanity
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:33.720]  and just clown world antics and with a scientific agenda behind it speak more about because i saw
[1:50:33.720 --> 1:50:39.000]  the news but you were there at this event you were saying obviously the vast majority of people
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:45.240]  were totally incensed i saw the video where all the women and people ran up to celebrate really
[1:50:45.240 --> 1:50:49.800]  first place and second place this guy shouldn't even have been there but second place and third
[1:50:49.800 --> 1:50:54.520]  place they actually were gradually the women that actually got first second and third totally
[1:50:54.520 --> 1:51:01.000]  ignoring this crepezoid can you speak to that and then what type of mental patient is a six foot four
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:06.280]  dude who was 400th and something in the men's league now trying to be number one in the women's
[1:51:06.280 --> 1:51:12.680]  league i mean what's wrong with him he has no shame what is his problem so first off alex i'll
[1:51:12.680 --> 1:51:17.960]  speak to lia thomas as a whole so a very interesting thing that i noticed at this competition is as
[1:51:17.960 --> 1:51:22.520]  each swimmer was called out there was such loud cheers from the crowds from the coaches from the
[1:51:22.520 --> 1:51:27.560]  team members the athletes but then when lia thomas's name was called crowd goes silent there was
[1:51:27.560 --> 1:51:32.600]  some polite clapping but crowd was pretty much silent when lia thomas his name was called when
[1:51:32.600 --> 1:51:37.640]  lia thomas took this first place and i actually watched this moment okay you guys just put up
[1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:42.440]  that picture of lia thomas on that first place podium and then these three girls the true first
[1:51:42.440 --> 1:51:47.960]  second and third place winners grouped together i watched this moment with my own two eyes and i
[1:51:47.960 --> 1:51:52.920]  you know just i was happy that these girls at least did this that they at least stood up together
[1:51:52.920 --> 1:51:57.000]  first second and third and said you know what lia thomas we are not allowing you to take this away
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:02.520]  from us and the crowd was not clapping they were not cheering when lia thomas was named number one
[1:52:02.520 --> 1:52:08.520]  again polite clapping if any but the masses knew that this was wrong and to lia thomas swimming
[1:52:08.520 --> 1:52:13.720]  with these females again alex normally with the competitors when they come out you have to look
[1:52:13.720 --> 1:52:18.680]  at the board to figure out you know who's who kind of figure out which lane which person is in when
[1:52:18.680 --> 1:52:23.240]  lia thomas walked out i didn't need to look at the board for a name i knew it was lia thomas
[1:52:23.240 --> 1:52:28.360]  because it was a big six foot tall man with broad shoulders that was about double the size
[1:52:28.360 --> 1:52:32.920]  of every other female they're competing and again it's just it's straight up mental illness
[1:52:32.920 --> 1:52:37.560]  with a bulge in his pants with a bulge in his pants and the left again newspapers accused
[1:52:37.560 --> 1:52:43.160]  carlson of adding the the the the the generals know i went and looked at the original photos he had a
[1:52:43.160 --> 1:52:48.920]  frickin weenie bulging yeah it's disturbing alex it's so disturbing to see i'm glad we're calling
[1:52:48.920 --> 1:52:53.880]  it out but um until the masses decide to stand up and wake up and push back just like with the face
[1:52:53.880 --> 1:52:58.920]  mask this will continue to go on until we put an end to it i tell you i mean i've got four daughters
[1:52:58.920 --> 1:53:03.560]  and they've competed in sports and i and i and you see it now at all over the place and in a whole
[1:53:03.560 --> 1:53:08.440]  bunch of collegiate sports and high school sports now it's men that are winning at all and it just
[1:53:08.440 --> 1:53:13.720]  is is a farce but it shows how much of this garbage we have put up with savannah anandas
[1:53:13.720 --> 1:53:19.240]  how do people find all the great work you're doing over there at trump's truth social yeah you guys
[1:53:19.240 --> 1:53:24.680]  can follow me on truth social at sas says you can follow my website sasasofficial.com for all
[1:53:24.680 --> 1:53:29.560]  of this band footage alex i was even talking to uh do behind the scenes about starting a band
[1:53:29.560 --> 1:53:34.440]  off video channel since none of my content and live on these platforms so hey maybe you'll see
[1:53:34.440 --> 1:53:38.600]  my footage here on band off video here in a bit but uh go follow me on all of those platforms
[1:53:38.600 --> 1:53:42.520]  continue to get the word out because again this isn't about me being silenced it's about these
[1:53:42.520 --> 1:53:47.560]  american women who were trying to have their voice heard being silenced and also to alex last
[1:53:47.560 --> 1:53:52.280]  thing i'll add i interviewed another former ncda athlete who ran against june eastwood who was a
[1:53:52.280 --> 1:53:58.520]  transgender track and field star uh she heard june's coach saying on the sidelines hey slow down
[1:53:58.520 --> 1:54:02.520]  because june was in first place because june was a biological man so that's what our girls are up
[1:54:02.520 --> 1:54:07.240]  against so they're even telling them slow down like like like when a boxer throws a fight they don't
[1:54:07.240 --> 1:54:11.880]  want him to throw it all the way just hey make it look hard you know give them a show because it'd
[1:54:11.880 --> 1:54:16.280]  be like putting mike tyson in the ring you know with a high school boxer i mean he would destroy
[1:54:16.280 --> 1:54:21.720]  them he'd be like who's going to go watch that look folks the there is an evil globalist force
[1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:26.760]  behind all this the taba stock institute behavioral psychology there is a larger dehumanization to
[1:54:26.760 --> 1:54:32.040]  begin to accept cyborgs and human animal clones uh that they're already rolling out and that's what
[1:54:32.040 --> 1:54:36.920]  this transgender idiocy is just getting us to accept it up front savannah nandes thank you so much
[1:54:36.920 --> 1:54:47.640]  thank you so much alex okay listen ladies and gentlemen it is in mainstream news that the

[1:57:47.560 --> 1:57:54.680]  our world is so full of hype we're force-fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media
[1:57:54.680 --> 1:58:00.920]  by the controlled churches and the universities why is this the case because we innately by god
[1:58:01.720 --> 1:58:04.920]  have been given the keys for our own minds our own psyche's our own souls
[1:58:04.920 --> 1:58:12.280]  and by connecting to god we can empower ourselves and trend sin the quote fallen or sinful stick
[1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:19.240]  so the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to change who we
[1:58:19.240 --> 1:58:23.720]  are are only lowering us they're only making us more depressed from the end they're only making
[1:58:23.720 --> 1:58:29.240]  us less fulfilled it is only by going within and really making that connection to god that we can
[1:58:29.240 --> 1:58:34.600]  truly empower ourselves that's why the globals bombard us and toxins and chemicals to block
[1:58:34.600 --> 1:58:39.560]  us getting the normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy
[1:58:39.560 --> 1:58:44.280]  and to be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension and that's where the incredible
[1:58:44.280 --> 1:58:53.880]  products come in at infowarstore.com if i had to describe with just one word the brainwashing
[1:58:53.880 --> 1:59:03.080]  the mind control the asleep prince that the general public is in the best word would actually be
[1:59:03.080 --> 1:59:09.480]  the people are lost just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in
[1:59:09.480 --> 1:59:18.200]  horror you get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused
[1:59:18.200 --> 1:59:23.640]  you have a concussion and that's what the globalists have done they have stunned us they have put us
[1:59:23.640 --> 1:59:28.120]  into a position of not knowing our bearings and then claus Schwab recently came out and gave
[1:59:28.120 --> 1:59:33.240]  speech he called the great new narrative where he brags how the public is lost how the culture in
[1:59:33.240 --> 1:59:38.840]  the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity over
[1:59:38.840 --> 1:59:44.360]  the edge of a cliff that's what the great reason is they need darkness to thrive the light lives
[1:59:44.360 --> 2:00:06.200]  at info wars dot com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:00:06.200 --> 2:00:25.080]  we're six minutes out from our special guest at some of the biggest coven news ever that's
[2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:30.120]  coming up at first i wanted to get into this whole cashless society system with black rock and the
[2:00:30.120 --> 2:00:36.760]  globalist on record trying to make us poor so control our lives and announcing the biggest
[2:00:36.760 --> 2:00:42.040]  food shows in modern history hundreds of millions set starved to death and die we've got all these
[2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:48.360]  articles telling us that we need to eat bugs and like it eat maggots now is what the newspapers are
[2:00:48.360 --> 2:00:53.880]  running that's getting you ready for the dystopia behavioral psychology because they know most people
[2:00:53.880 --> 2:00:58.920]  are in a trance and are just receiving this knowledge instead of being conscious and so they
[2:00:58.920 --> 2:01:06.680]  can't navigate it it's our job to hey get out of your trance this is serious business and so as
[2:01:06.680 --> 2:01:11.160]  these evil plans roll out the credibility of those of us that have been exposing it will go to all
[2:01:11.160 --> 2:01:17.720]  time highs people will listen to us and we can stop this before they carry out their 90% population
[2:01:17.720 --> 2:01:22.760]  by the year 2030 people saying how's that going to happen well you mean i mean they told us how
[2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:28.520]  they were going to do it and you can now see that they intend to do that while posing as the saviors
[2:01:28.520 --> 2:01:33.960]  from the crises they have created and exacerbated so here's a couple clips the sec of security
[2:01:33.960 --> 2:01:39.320]  exchange commission is expected to notice climate disclosure rules which is the beginning of the
[2:01:39.320 --> 2:01:46.280]  whole un world bank imf carbon scores and the rest of it and surveillance system to shut down
[2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:52.520]  all their competition and that ties in to a tick tocker and you can look this up explains master
[2:01:52.520 --> 2:01:58.760]  card in the un joining forces for social credit systems we'll play both these back to back as
[2:01:58.760 --> 2:02:03.640]  you've heard today the commission is considering proposing rules to enhance standardized climate
[2:02:03.640 --> 2:02:09.800]  disclosure these proposals would require public companies to provide in their registration statements
[2:02:09.800 --> 2:02:16.200]  and annual reports certain information on risks that climate poses to short medium and long-term
[2:02:16.200 --> 2:02:23.320]  financial performance and on steps the company plans to take to mitigate this risk such as an
[2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:29.480]  internal carbon price if there is one scenario analysis if the company does it transition plans
[2:02:29.480 --> 2:02:35.960]  if the company has them or targets if the company has set them public companies would also disclose
[2:02:35.960 --> 2:02:42.280]  governance around climate issues besides the disclosures on risk and on the company's response
[2:02:42.280 --> 2:02:47.800]  the proposed rules would require disclosure on current financial impacts and on financial expenditures
[2:02:47.800 --> 2:02:53.720]  due to climate related events and transition activities finally the rule would require
[2:02:53.720 --> 2:02:59.320]  disclosure about the carbon footprint through scopes one and two ghg emissions and scope three
[2:02:59.800 --> 2:03:05.560]  if scope three emissions are material or used as part of a climate related target or goal don't
[2:03:05.560 --> 2:03:11.240]  say you weren't warned master card and the united nations are joining forces to monitor the carbon
[2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:17.480]  effect of your credit card purchases and then you'll hit your carbon max and it'll stop working
[2:03:17.480 --> 2:03:23.800]  hey of course it's voluntary for now the new credit card is called doconomy and on the back of the
[2:03:23.800 --> 2:03:29.480]  card it's going to say i am taking responsibility for every transaction i make to help protect the
[2:03:29.480 --> 2:03:35.400]  planet this is a social credit score and it's a proof of concept the doconomy co2 credit card
[2:03:35.400 --> 2:03:43.000]  website claims it is the largest initiative ever taken by a bank in educating its users on the
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  impact of consumption they say themselves they want to set a global standard for carbon calculations
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:53.480]  that's the key once they have their numbers in place then they can give every single purchase
[2:03:53.480 --> 2:03:59.400]  you make a score and punish you directly this is what china does and of course this will only be
[2:03:59.400 --> 2:04:04.520]  enforced on you and me and any businesses that don't go along with their scheme and banks are
[2:04:04.520 --> 2:04:10.200]  going to enforce it that's right and it's all being announced that's why trudeau last year was
[2:04:10.200 --> 2:04:15.480]  saying we're going to follow all the ewin directives he was giving all those acronyms out and if you
[2:04:15.480 --> 2:04:21.240]  look the esg's and the rest of it up that is the global governance system designed to starve everybody
[2:04:21.240 --> 2:04:26.840]  to death but of course these institutions they are all completely exempt you know our next guest
[2:04:26.840 --> 2:04:33.560]  is a really smart economics researcher and stock picker will probably get his take on some of these
[2:04:33.560 --> 2:04:38.440]  announcements about the mass starvation all the rest of it that are coming up but first we're
[2:04:38.440 --> 2:04:43.400]  going to get into the big issue they're just calmly out in the news admitting yeah the government
[2:04:43.400 --> 2:04:48.360]  paid us to kill people with covid and you know put them on drugs that made them not breathe big deal
[2:04:48.360 --> 2:04:54.120]  we got to kill some people i mean we'll save money that's right hiding it all in plain view what a dystopia
[2:04:54.120 --> 2:05:03.720]  ladies and gentlemen i need your help i need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong
[2:05:03.720 --> 2:05:09.400]  i need your help making sure that our mission continues on i was born for this you were born
[2:05:09.400 --> 2:05:14.840]  for this and people are really waking up right now but we had to build our own infrastructure
[2:05:14.840 --> 2:05:19.800]  because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars and now
[2:05:19.800 --> 2:05:25.000]  with bandot video getting close to 10 million views a day we're a platform for thousands
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:31.480]  of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge and because
[2:05:31.480 --> 2:05:38.520]  it's become so successful it's a catch 22 info wars and bandot video have become a mothership
[2:05:38.520 --> 2:05:44.520]  promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions
[2:05:44.520 --> 2:05:49.560]  of dollars a quarter hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month so the biggest sale in
[2:05:49.560 --> 2:05:54.280]  info wars history is going right now the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75 percent off
[2:05:54.280 --> 2:06:15.880]  getting credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever if you are receiving this
[2:06:15.880 --> 2:06:24.760]  transmission you are the resistance live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[2:06:28.520 --> 2:06:34.360]  so if you go back two years ago when they would pay the same thing in europe sending in the u k
[2:06:34.360 --> 2:06:37.000]  sending in australia same thing in canada the u s
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:47.080]  $52,000 in change some countries a little more some a little less if you innovated somebody
[2:06:47.080 --> 2:06:50.280]  you got 30 something thousand we're saying it's a covid patient you got 13 something
[2:06:50.280 --> 2:06:56.200]  thousand for innovating them and you got 10,000 more if they died so now we're talking 60 plus
[2:06:56.200 --> 2:07:01.560]  thousand dollar bounty to murder somebody and even us today fact check that a year and a half ago and
[2:07:01.560 --> 2:07:08.120]  said yeah it's true there's a 53,000 dollar bounty they weren't counting the 10,000 if you die or
[2:07:08.920 --> 2:07:15.400]  52,700 dollars or whatever it came out to and so the number crunchers started getting involved
[2:07:15.400 --> 2:07:20.760]  and there's been a lot of economists a lot of people basically say the same thing uh because
[2:07:20.760 --> 2:07:25.080]  you look at the numbers and now you've got german insurance companies and multinational and us
[2:07:25.080 --> 2:07:33.000]  one saying man we got a massive increase in death of 18 to uh 64 the working age and headlines about
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:37.720]  a 40 increase and all the rest of it the biggest death numbers ever recorded in modern history
[2:07:37.720 --> 2:07:44.680]  that's the last hundred plus years so edward dowd is a x wall street professional worked at hsbc
[2:07:44.680 --> 2:07:51.160]  donelson lufkin and others black rock but the key is almost two years ago he came out and started
[2:07:51.160 --> 2:07:55.320]  seeing these trends and predicting what was happening his tweets are very famous he's worked
[2:07:55.320 --> 2:08:00.280]  all over wall street these sell side and buy side expert in fixed income and equities capital
[2:08:00.280 --> 2:08:04.920]  markets he's currently trying to start a hedge fund and it goes on from there and he is edward
[2:08:04.920 --> 2:08:13.320]  dowd you'll find him on twitter at d o w d e d ward and on getter as well at edward dowd and so
[2:08:13.320 --> 2:08:19.160]  edward a lot has happened since he were last on with us i've seen you going viral in the war room
[2:08:19.160 --> 2:08:22.520]  and all these other great shows we just really appreciate the hard work and sticking your
[2:08:22.520 --> 2:08:26.360]  neck out there uh that you're doing but i guess we all realize we're going to lose it all if we
[2:08:26.360 --> 2:08:30.040]  don't stick our necks out but i want to show this daily mail article this is also another
[2:08:30.040 --> 2:08:34.680]  british newspapers and i went and spent a few hours on it the last few days and been trying to get
[2:08:34.680 --> 2:08:39.080]  you on i appreciate you coming on because you can add more expertise to this but they're publicly
[2:08:39.080 --> 2:08:46.280]  announcing the nih what we already knew but now admitted paid to have them give people
[2:08:46.280 --> 2:08:51.320]  uh the assisted suicide drugs that they bought a bunch of right before the pandemic record levels
[2:08:51.320 --> 2:08:55.000]  and we know the same thing here give them more fiend don't give them treatment watch them die
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:09:00.360]  but to read this here's the headline hospitals bribed to put patients on pathway to death
[2:09:00.360 --> 2:09:06.040]  cash and centers by the national health service trust that meet targets on liber pool care pathway
[2:09:06.040 --> 2:09:11.240]  this is the tip of the iceberg obviously but this is beyond nirenberg type level crimes
[2:09:11.240 --> 2:09:17.720]  admitted right here and it's only the tip of the iceberg holy to leto i mean i don't i don't know
[2:09:17.720 --> 2:09:22.360]  what you say what you do but this totally vindicates the numbers you've been putting out and many
[2:09:22.360 --> 2:09:26.120]  others have been putting out and as we learn more it just gets more horrible by the minute and then
[2:09:26.120 --> 2:09:31.960]  now they're they're admitting it like it's no big deal what do you make of this shocking vindication
[2:09:31.960 --> 2:09:37.960]  of yourself and others well you know i haven't read the article but it seems like you know believe
[2:09:37.960 --> 2:09:44.920]  them when they say what they did so they just said it let's let's believe them um in the us let's go
[2:09:44.920 --> 2:09:50.440]  back to the us you were talking about the incentives they put in place uh early on in the pandemic
[2:09:50.440 --> 2:09:55.720]  for hospitals and payments you know it's come out over the course of the last two years whistleblowers
[2:09:55.720 --> 2:10:01.320]  have come out there's one in hawaii i forget his name but he you know was in an assisted care
[2:10:01.320 --> 2:10:08.040]  living facility and uh he was told to change billing codes for people that um died not of
[2:10:08.040 --> 2:10:16.600]  covid to covid so they could get the money so we put incentives in place that reward uh hospitals
[2:10:16.600 --> 2:10:22.760]  for putting people on intubators for putting uh people and identifying them as covid and then
[2:10:22.760 --> 2:10:29.720]  uh getting an award for death you know that that that's that's gonna happen they're gonna you know
[2:10:29.720 --> 2:10:36.040]  they're gonna you know people are gonna take the incentive and run with it so the other thing i want
[2:10:36.040 --> 2:10:44.840]  to point out is the data after the last two years we've had 1.1 million deaths in the us uh excess
[2:10:44.840 --> 2:10:53.560]  deaths from the pandemic the first year was uh 500 000 approximately in the second year was 500
[2:10:53.560 --> 2:11:02.200]  000 approximately in the first year um they killed uh well uh a lot of debt a lot of people died
[2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:07.080]  because of early prevention and intubation and the wrong treatment so the first kill shot
[2:11:08.680 --> 2:11:16.200]  from government policies was mostly old people in year one in year two the deaths that have been
[2:11:16.200 --> 2:11:23.800]  occurring uh have had a mixed shift uh to the younger people so we took care of the old people
[2:11:23.800 --> 2:11:28.360]  now with the vaccines we're seeing a shift to younger people so this is this is and you know
[2:11:28.360 --> 2:11:34.200]  i use the word democide uh i you know you could say there was a democide in year one with the
[2:11:34.200 --> 2:11:38.600]  the prevention of early treatment and the incentives they gave year two the democides
[2:11:38.600 --> 2:11:46.840]  occurring with the vaccine so um you know it's democide and for those that don't know what democide
[2:11:46.840 --> 2:11:51.640]  is uh that is also a university term developed about 30 years ago at the university of hawaii
[2:11:51.640 --> 2:11:55.640]  then picked up by the chicago business school and that's when the government kills its people
[2:11:57.320 --> 2:12:05.000]  correct looking at this and seeing this i i've i've i've been following your work a lot more
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:09.880]  has come out just the last few weeks since you were last on with us from from other data points
[2:12:09.880 --> 2:12:18.440]  can you walk the listeners through that sure so we came out a couple weeks ago and we put up what
[2:12:18.440 --> 2:12:23.160]  we called the money chart uh this is a different chart but the money chart we put up a while ago
[2:12:23.160 --> 2:12:29.960]  was all-cause mortality for millennials i got a lot of play we saw spike into the fall so what
[2:12:29.960 --> 2:12:36.280]  we're doing now uh is breaking it down by state just to prove our point again that something
[2:12:36.280 --> 2:12:43.720]  happened in the fall so we're slicing the data a little different way and uh chart one uh is uh
[2:12:43.720 --> 2:12:50.600]  the lowest vaccinated states lowest vaccinated states and you can see when people in the lowest
[2:12:50.600 --> 2:12:57.560]  vaccinated states in the country were forced this is the millennial age group it's a percent over
[2:12:57.560 --> 2:13:03.800]  the 2019 average so it's not actual raw numbers but it's percent increase in excess deaths in that
[2:13:03.800 --> 2:13:09.400]  chart you see that spike you see the acceleration into the fall that three month time frame when
[2:13:09.400 --> 2:13:16.760]  the mandates hit chart two shows the highly vaccinated states um they still had a terrible
[2:13:16.760 --> 2:13:24.200]  spike uh but not quite as pronounced as the spike from the unvaccinated states so i i dropped these
[2:13:24.200 --> 2:13:30.040]  on twitter and getter last night and i did that because i wanted people to come in and argue and
[2:13:30.040 --> 2:13:37.800]  say well of course that makes sense uh it was delta because the unvaccinated states got hit
[2:13:37.800 --> 2:13:46.440]  with delta okay well that's not true because then i dropped later this morning charts three and four
[2:13:46.440 --> 2:13:52.840]  and chart three shows that the clear spike uh so what you're seeing in this chart is the lowest
[2:13:52.840 --> 2:13:59.000]  state lowest vaccinated states in the red and then the pink is the uh vaccinated the highly
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  vaccinated states you can see the spike up into the vaccination and then a subsequent decline so
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:09.720]  it wasn't covered it was just a one-time temporal event when everybody went to get their jabs to
[2:14:09.720 --> 2:14:16.520]  keep their job and then the smoking gun chart is chart four uh in the lowest vac states you can see
[2:14:16.520 --> 2:14:25.320]  that uh the um the rate of excess death in the 25 the 44 was you know um six or seven times higher
[2:14:25.320 --> 2:14:32.360]  than the uh older people um so it wasn't covered because it you know delta didn't decide to kill
[2:14:32.360 --> 2:14:40.440]  with the uh that age group specifically so again we just slicing the data a different way um and
[2:14:40.440 --> 2:14:46.520]  it proves our point so we have we have we have the uh millennial cohort we dropped a couple weeks ago
[2:14:46.520 --> 2:14:50.920]  and now we're breaking it out by state and you can see you can see the whole pre-planned nature
[2:14:50.920 --> 2:14:57.640]  of this like dr uh mercola has been saying and and mccullough that opens i mean this is clearly
[2:14:57.640 --> 2:15:07.640]  a whole pre-programmed operation so it's either stupidity or plan but in the first year of the
[2:15:07.640 --> 2:15:14.360]  pandemic uh we prevented early treatment and we put people on in debaters and uh lots of people
[2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:21.560]  died there's been estimates that 400 000 people didn't need to die in year one if there was early
[2:15:21.560 --> 2:15:28.920]  prevention and uh if you didn't innovate people so that's that's year one year two it's been a
[2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:35.320]  mixed shift to the young folks who you know weren't at risk from covid anyways so we've had 1.1 million
[2:15:35.320 --> 2:15:41.480]  people uh die excessively in the united states over the last few years so if you don't think
[2:15:41.480 --> 2:15:45.960]  we're at war with someone you know i don't know what to tell you yeah that's what twice what we
[2:15:45.960 --> 2:15:49.240]  lost in world war two and we come back i want to ask you what the numbers show and what they're
[2:15:49.240 --> 2:15:53.080]  trending towards what we should expect in the future from the best data you've got please tell
[2:15:53.080 --> 2:16:00.520]  you what this will be right back the eugenicist over a hundred years ago were very public about
[2:16:00.520 --> 2:16:06.520]  their plans they financed major universities they ran full page stories and advertisements
[2:16:06.520 --> 2:16:11.320]  pushing their propaganda of the new york times other major newspapers that the family as we
[2:16:11.320 --> 2:16:16.920]  know it is a bad thing and must be ended and the first step in that is getting women out of the
[2:16:16.920 --> 2:16:22.280]  household and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and
[2:16:22.280 --> 2:16:27.560]  husbands is a bad thing and i was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter my
[2:16:27.560 --> 2:16:31.320]  four natural daughter my wife makes dinner a lot of times but i like to make it as well i love to
[2:16:31.320 --> 2:16:36.760]  make breakfast and literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be
[2:16:36.760 --> 2:16:42.920]  nutritious and then all sit down together and have that communal event and that's what the system
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:16:49.160]  is attacking and bombarding is our normal biological actions are coming together they really are sick
[2:16:49.720 --> 2:16:55.560]  evil scientific cult of filth and want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats we cannot let this
[2:16:55.560 --> 2:17:03.960]  continue get our great a bag of it here i mean this is from people say why is it from Chiapas
[2:17:03.960 --> 2:17:09.480]  mexico the communist well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[2:17:09.480 --> 2:17:14.200]  above organic in the volcanic soil better than watermelon coffee and yeah we buy it from the
[2:17:14.200 --> 2:17:17.800]  little farmers that you know the media calls communists but really they're just a commune
[2:17:17.800 --> 2:17:21.880]  and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the
[2:17:21.880 --> 2:17:25.480]  mexican government take over so i actually buy this from the mexican rebels and i've been buying it for
[2:17:25.480 --> 2:17:29.560]  what 14 years and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[2:17:29.560 --> 2:17:33.560]  for about 50 percent more per pound and i just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna
[2:17:33.560 --> 2:17:39.320]  find anywhere it's wake up america patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally um in fact i'm
[2:17:39.320 --> 2:17:46.680]  gonna tell you a little story um we had like that okay do you want to believe it anyway so it's
[2:17:46.680 --> 2:17:51.800]  infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't find us you don't want to see
[2:17:51.800 --> 2:18:03.400]  that's fine the globalist social engineers always intended to push their covid biomedical tyranny
[2:18:03.960 --> 2:18:10.840]  lockdowns until the populations rebelled they would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[2:18:10.840 --> 2:18:17.320]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives but because of so
[2:18:17.320 --> 2:18:22.600]  many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers
[2:18:23.320 --> 2:18:30.040]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government
[2:18:30.040 --> 2:18:35.960]  corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever the problem is some
[2:18:35.960 --> 2:18:41.320]  globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover like canada where they've now
[2:18:41.320 --> 2:18:47.240]  declared a civil emergency and martial law in ontario and other areas of the world are following
[2:18:47.240 --> 2:18:52.600]  suit like australia so pray for these folks big time this is a very serious situation and stay
[2:18:52.600 --> 2:18:57.880]  tuned into info wars dot com because truth is absolutely paramount micah california thanks
[2:18:57.880 --> 2:19:02.840]  for calling i think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research now if
[2:19:02.840 --> 2:19:08.360]  you read the actual you know 2014 legislation the u.s. government gain of function deliberative
[2:19:08.360 --> 2:19:14.040]  process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influenza
[2:19:14.040 --> 2:19:19.640]  mers and stars viruses there's nothing about stars like viruses and if the research funding pause
[2:19:19.640 --> 2:19:24.120]  it's not a stop it's not a prohibition it's when you come to a four-way intersection there's the
[2:19:24.120 --> 2:19:29.240]  stops on you stop you look both ways and then you proceed and so it's also it doesn't pause all
[2:19:29.240 --> 2:19:34.680]  gain of function just selected gain of function but they'll argue that this is actually characterization
[2:19:34.680 --> 2:19:39.480]  and qualification research so you know rand and others you know maybe fouchy was right they don't
[2:19:39.480 --> 2:19:42.920]  quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function you know that's why he didn't
[2:19:42.920 --> 2:19:47.320]  perjure himself that's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic
[2:19:47.320 --> 2:19:52.520]  live forms that mimic what the viruses do but in the main definition it's still a gain of function
[2:19:52.520 --> 2:19:56.440]  they're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people thank you mike we love you
[2:19:56.440 --> 2:20:05.240]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:20:27.400 --> 2:20:29.240]  that's far away
[2:20:31.240 --> 2:20:38.040]  how are we supposed to get there with the way they were living today
[2:20:39.480 --> 2:20:52.600]  you talk lots about god freedom comes from the car but that's not what this bitch wants
[2:20:52.600 --> 2:21:00.040]  not what i want at all i want and now we know the biggest fan of the world history being caused
[2:21:00.040 --> 2:21:05.320]  by the lockdowns the last two years they're still ongoing in some african lat american countries
[2:21:05.320 --> 2:21:10.440]  under imf rolebank control are leading to mass starvation we know bill gates and others have
[2:21:10.440 --> 2:21:16.200]  said they want to be populated so we know it's by design but ever doubt is a really smart guy he's
[2:21:16.200 --> 2:21:22.120]  been laying all this out as a researcher and as economists and as a wall street uh professional
[2:21:22.120 --> 2:21:26.440]  and stock picker and i could ask a lot of questions here you heard me before the break get into what
[2:21:26.440 --> 2:21:31.480]  do you think's coming next and this whole program but i'd like you to give your presentation in this
[2:21:31.480 --> 2:21:38.440]  segment the next of where you want to go and what you want to say to the listeners um yeah
[2:21:38.440 --> 2:21:44.440]  absolutely thanks for the opportunity um you know let's just set the stage in the frame uh for
[2:21:44.440 --> 2:21:51.160]  what's going on uh you know early on we had front line doctors who noticed that something was horribly
[2:21:51.160 --> 2:21:58.200]  wrong when they tried to come forward with a treatment from cheap over-the-counter pharmaceuticals
[2:21:58.200 --> 2:22:03.640]  are already available uh and use them for off-label purposes to fight this virus which have been
[2:22:03.640 --> 2:22:10.120]  proven to work and and and not cause someone to die and actually bring them to health so the
[2:22:10.120 --> 2:22:15.160]  frontline doctors are the real heroes here they were the brave ones they were maligned censored
[2:22:15.160 --> 2:22:22.440]  smeared and deplatformed okay so i'm just building off their early work unfortunately you know my
[2:22:23.320 --> 2:22:28.920]  15 minutes of fame is because the bodies are piling up it's two years later and you can't
[2:22:28.920 --> 2:22:33.880]  hide them anymore and it's in publicly available databases now the the numbers i just showed you
[2:22:33.880 --> 2:22:41.160]  are cdc numbers now what's really disturbing to my partner and i my insurance expert who's helped
[2:22:41.160 --> 2:22:45.400]  me develop these charts or he did most of the work and on the public face of them and we we
[2:22:45.400 --> 2:22:54.120]  both analyze them together but we were talking to each other and we said why is it that two x
[2:22:54.120 --> 2:22:59.800]  wall street guys one lives on the base of a dormant volcano in the middle of the pacific ocean and
[2:22:59.800 --> 2:23:06.120]  another guy that lives in uh on the east coast have to be the ones that bring this data forward
[2:23:06.120 --> 2:23:13.160]  i mean it's really we were just stunned at how ridiculous it is that no one in the in the government
[2:23:13.160 --> 2:23:20.840]  or regulatory agency or in congress has figured this out it's it's it's right there people are
[2:23:20.840 --> 2:23:24.840]  dying at an alarming rate the good doctors have tried to get their message out but they've been
[2:23:24.840 --> 2:23:31.800]  censored and here are two x wall street you know self-admitted geeks having to do this and i just i
[2:23:31.800 --> 2:23:36.920]  just think that's the state of where we are alex i mean it's frightening that you know i mean i'm
[2:23:36.920 --> 2:23:43.320]  glad i'm here i asked to be of service but when i take my ego out of it you know why isn't someone
[2:23:43.320 --> 2:23:51.160]  in his authority come forward well what's incredible is you know going back to may of two years ago
[2:23:51.160 --> 2:23:58.440]  there you are saying this appears to be a controlled collapse a way to depopulate a way to not pay for
[2:23:58.440 --> 2:24:03.960]  all the baby boomers that are retiring now there it is he says i have an idea for a dystopian movie
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:09.320]  the background begins in 2020 this is almost two years ago a virus that mimics the flu sweeps
[2:24:09.320 --> 2:24:13.960]  across the globe some believe it's a man made by a weapon to provide cover for a global economic
[2:24:13.960 --> 2:24:21.800]  collapse from an unsustainable debt load and rising wealth inequity the majority and then
[2:24:21.800 --> 2:24:26.920]  you go through your next weeks and lay out what indeed was starting to happen and now what's happened
[2:24:26.920 --> 2:24:35.800]  yeah no it's uh you know i didn't want to believe what i wrote um you know i'm not people say i'm
[2:24:35.800 --> 2:24:43.160]  an oracle and uh from the future i mean i just i'm just an analyst and i wrote that i thought
[2:24:43.160 --> 2:24:49.160]  that might happen and i was horrified as it started to unfold and i you know i'm just horrified of
[2:24:49.160 --> 2:24:56.760]  what's going on i can't believe we're here um but you know i have opinions of what's coming um you
[2:24:56.760 --> 2:25:03.400]  know we're seeing uh signals in the financial markets that indicate um economic collapse on the
[2:25:03.400 --> 2:25:12.840]  horizon or at least a recession if not a some some kind of small depression um in the third quarter
[2:25:12.840 --> 2:25:18.920]  we're looking at a minimum of a recession commodity prices are through the roof because of the um
[2:25:19.960 --> 2:25:28.360]  the uh overt actions by the biden administration to limit domestic production of oil uh now we
[2:25:28.360 --> 2:25:33.240]  have the war in ukraine where grain prices are soaring because ukraine is the breadbasket of
[2:25:33.240 --> 2:25:43.000]  europe and uh you know i i'm i'm of the opinion we're going to see food shortages soon if not
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:49.160]  already appearing all over um there's all sorts of anecdotes from farmers and uh people who are
[2:25:49.160 --> 2:25:54.520]  in that business seeing fertilizer prices going through the roof so they're coming um
[2:25:55.480 --> 2:26:01.320]  and uh if i was to write another movie today uh what do i think might happen if i was writing the
[2:26:01.320 --> 2:26:08.600]  script well uh we got the ukraine war so this potential threat of nuclear war uh there is a
[2:26:09.400 --> 2:26:16.600]  self uh announced by claus Schwab cyber virus pandemic coming which they uh trained for
[2:26:17.160 --> 2:26:25.800]  with a bunch of nations uh in the fall of last year and we also have um a virus mutant virus in
[2:26:25.800 --> 2:26:30.840]  china that faiji's warning us about so you know it could be any one of those three or all three at
[2:26:30.840 --> 2:26:36.760]  the same time if i was writing a movie script that you know alex that's right and i think they're
[2:26:36.760 --> 2:26:41.560]  going to do all three at once and they've told us the collapse is coming get ready you know i can
[2:26:41.560 --> 2:26:46.360]  tell you i've talked to some of the you know top people out there face to face people that go to
[2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:52.120]  bill berg things like that recently and and they agreed that uh there's a pretty serious
[2:26:52.120 --> 2:26:56.360]  deterioration going on and they were asking me you know do you think we should all evacuate the
[2:26:56.360 --> 2:27:00.200]  southern hemisphere is a threat of nuclear war and we were all basically estimating it's about
[2:27:00.200 --> 2:27:04.920]  a 10 percent chance is what we were thinking um but there's no doubt we've entered a very very
[2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:11.000]  dystopian situation and if some of the more well-known billionaires out there are really concerned
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:18.680]  we should all be really really concerned i agree i mean um there's still a large majority of the
[2:27:18.680 --> 2:27:25.960]  population that is trying to live in a normalcy bias thinking that you know things aren't what they
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:31.080]  may seem to be to them they're trying to pretend that we're going back to normal but i will tell
[2:27:31.080 --> 2:27:37.320]  you uh the awakening is is going fast i was contacted by someone locally on my way who wanted
[2:27:37.320 --> 2:27:42.520]  me to join their church because they're preparing for what's coming and they came to this conclusion
[2:27:42.520 --> 2:27:50.920]  independently of me you know that even been listening to me so people are um uh becoming
[2:27:50.920 --> 2:27:59.640]  aware of the uh the situation and the unraveling of uh global regimes you know today i saw a tweet
[2:27:59.640 --> 2:28:06.280]  from uh cernovich that he retweeted someone talking about the fbis now no longer reporting
[2:28:06.280 --> 2:28:12.760]  crime statistics you know that's that's real-time evidence of decay of the rule of law oh yeah i
[2:28:12.760 --> 2:28:18.840]  saw that a few days ago didn't believe it when's the fbi website and they now admit it right so
[2:28:18.840 --> 2:28:25.240]  we're having real-time real-world evidence of a collapse that's that's an that in my mind is the
[2:28:25.240 --> 2:28:31.560]  federal government collapsing uh when you start to hide crime statistics i mean that that's
[2:28:32.600 --> 2:28:36.920]  what they do is get out of dad and report it that's right mr dad stay there you're absolutely
[2:28:36.920 --> 2:28:41.160]  right we'll talk about how we survive this what you think we can do to protect ourselves
[2:28:41.160 --> 2:28:46.360]  shut off the police shut off crime reporting shut off the power plant shut off the pipelines

[2:31:06.200 --> 2:31:14.120]  asleep prince that the general public is in the best word would actually be the people are lost
[2:31:14.920 --> 2:31:20.360]  just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare you're in a horror you get knocked out
[2:31:20.360 --> 2:31:28.680]  and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused you have a concussion
[2:31:29.400 --> 2:31:34.360]  and that's what the globalists have done they have stunned us they have put us into a position
[2:31:34.360 --> 2:31:38.600]  of not knowing our bearings and then claus Schwab recently came out and gave speech he called the
[2:31:38.600 --> 2:31:44.600]  great new narrative where he brags how the public is lost how the culture in the media has been
[2:31:44.600 --> 2:31:49.000]  driven to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a
[2:31:49.000 --> 2:31:55.800]  cliff that's what the great reset is they need darkness to thrive the light lives at nfo wars.com
[2:31:57.000 --> 2:32:02.920]  a riotous mob whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the
[2:32:02.920 --> 2:32:09.320]  assault on our democracy insurrection we will follow the facts wherever they lead domestic
[2:32:09.320 --> 2:32:16.120]  terrorists the days of independent media are numbered the government has made it illegal to
[2:32:16.120 --> 2:32:22.280]  oppose them they are now deep banking us behind the scenes they want to bankrupt us and make us go
[2:32:22.280 --> 2:32:29.320]  away quietly with practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps the
[2:32:29.320 --> 2:32:35.080]  traders know they can shut us down by force but that would accelerate the awakening exponentially
[2:32:35.640 --> 2:32:43.160]  so be it make them silence us by force this is the final battle of the information war give now
[2:32:43.160 --> 2:32:51.640]  by products donate before everything changes we need you to carry us through to the end victory
[2:32:51.640 --> 2:33:03.320]  or death go now to infowarstore.com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's
[2:33:03.320 --> 2:33:26.280]  alex jones on twitter at dowward on getter at edward dowdy the alex jones show because there
[2:33:26.280 --> 2:33:33.400]  is a war on for your mind you know i play uh suspenseful scary music here because this is
[2:33:33.400 --> 2:33:38.280]  suspenseful scary stuff and playing air raid sirens for three years at the start of the show
[2:33:38.280 --> 2:33:42.840]  because i told you war and all this was coming the globalists don't even really hide much of this
[2:33:42.840 --> 2:33:49.320]  they are lining it all up they all get ready i knew back in uh october that there'd be a major
[2:33:49.320 --> 2:33:57.240]  stock market uh correction in late february that's why i don't own stocks and things i would obsess
[2:33:57.240 --> 2:34:01.480]  over it all day and i get a lot of insider stuff and they would obviously put me in prison i mean
[2:34:01.480 --> 2:34:05.560]  i'm not gonna give examples of this but i get a lot of them and so that's why i don't own any
[2:34:05.560 --> 2:34:10.760]  stocks or bonds or any of that because it's like i know all this inside stuff and not be tempted
[2:34:11.560 --> 2:34:15.320]  and and you caught up and i'm not saying people are bad to do that congress is bad knowing all
[2:34:15.320 --> 2:34:19.640]  the inside stuff about bills and legislation and you know that's completely criminal but
[2:34:20.920 --> 2:34:24.920]  i mean these are real people i'm talking to these are real people i don't mean people worth
[2:34:24.920 --> 2:34:29.080]  two billion dollars and they're ten billion dollars i mean you know the big people and they're
[2:34:29.080 --> 2:34:36.920]  even freaked out and they're not trying to meet with me or talk to me so that they can buy me off
[2:34:36.920 --> 2:34:41.640]  they're actually asking what they should do and that doesn't make me get a big ego that actually
[2:34:41.640 --> 2:34:47.400]  makes me have nightmares that actually makes me get really scared for my family because here's the
[2:34:47.400 --> 2:34:51.480]  here's the paradox and i want to ask ever doubt his his viewers he's a smart guy i respect his view
[2:34:52.680 --> 2:34:58.040]  a lot of globalists want chaos and the population and wars and collapse because they're really in
[2:34:58.040 --> 2:35:01.880]  an environmentalist cult believe we're killing the planet but a lot of the other ones that have
[2:35:01.880 --> 2:35:06.840]  gone along with it just to not get picked off by the top dogs even some people you think of as top
[2:35:06.840 --> 2:35:12.120]  dogs they're asking how do you collapse everything and then own everything but there's nothing to
[2:35:12.120 --> 2:35:18.120]  buy with it so obviously going down the road of global even controlled collapse it doesn't
[2:35:18.120 --> 2:35:24.280]  stay controlled indian pakistan go to war china goes into taiwan russia goes into ukraine i mean
[2:35:24.280 --> 2:35:28.920]  we could we could predict all this it's not like we're rocket scientists holy hell humans act the
[2:35:28.920 --> 2:35:35.160]  same over and over again now we've just got godlike weapons so ever you're talking about economic
[2:35:35.160 --> 2:35:39.320]  collapse here we're already in it for first world it's really rough the third world they're dying
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:43.560]  lay out more of this go over the angles of this and then is there a way to stop it is there a way
[2:35:43.560 --> 2:35:49.080]  to get the political elite who aren't completely corrupt to get control of their compatriots that
[2:35:49.080 --> 2:35:55.320]  are out of control with this megalomania or how do you think we get out of this or is it too late
[2:35:57.400 --> 2:36:04.280]  i like to be an optimist um there's things in motion that are beyond our control obviously
[2:36:04.280 --> 2:36:13.000]  but my goal has been to stop this fox vaccination program dead in its tracks bring the people responsible
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:19.880]  for the malfeasance and fraud to justice and uh if we can do that the house of cards falls apart
[2:36:19.880 --> 2:36:24.360]  because no you know they're not going to be able to roll out digital id passport that's right so the
[2:36:24.360 --> 2:36:30.120]  medical tyranny is the lynchpin please continue yeah so so that's why i'm focusing on what i what
[2:36:30.120 --> 2:36:36.680]  i can prove and when i what i'm what we're proving is the deaths are undeniable at this point um the
[2:36:36.680 --> 2:36:42.920]  vaccination as a prime cause of the excess deaths in the smoking gun of the millennial cohort is
[2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:50.040]  there so you know my plea is for the mainstream media to stop this blockade of this information
[2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:55.640]  to get it to other people so that this discussion can begin you know my goal has been to get this into
[2:36:55.640 --> 2:37:00.280]  the uh you know the national consciousness i don't have to be the leader of it i just want the
[2:37:00.280 --> 2:37:05.480]  discussion to go on and let the experts take over and battle from there and the litigation begin
[2:37:05.480 --> 2:37:11.480]  and the stock prices of Pfizer and Moderna to collapse so i just want to be a catalyst i don't
[2:37:11.480 --> 2:37:17.000]  need to be the guy because you know quite frankly you know i'm just a dude i'm just a dude on an
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:22.040]  island in the middle of pacific and uh i'm just giving this information for free i'm doing this
[2:37:22.040 --> 2:37:27.560]  for free with my partner and uh you know this this should be raising questions all over the
[2:37:27.560 --> 2:37:34.440]  insurance industry all over the wall street should be all over this um and if we can get to a critical
[2:37:34.440 --> 2:37:39.160]  mass you know then i think we can avoid i mean there'll be still be an economic collapse but
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:47.800]  we'll be at least stopping this this this tragedy that's going on with the vaccines
[2:37:47.800 --> 2:37:52.600]  and you know alex there's the acute deaths right you know that's that's what we're shown here in
[2:37:52.600 --> 2:37:59.080]  the cdcl cause mortality excess deaths you know we haven't even begun to talk about the injured
[2:37:59.080 --> 2:38:05.880]  and the um the amount of life that's been decreased for someone you know so you know we may have cut
[2:38:05.880 --> 2:38:11.240]  10 years off the the average person's life who's been vaccinated due to this the implications of
[2:38:11.240 --> 2:38:17.800]  that are staggering um you know we're working on behind the scenes a number that's gonna you
[2:38:17.800 --> 2:38:22.200]  know blow people's minds if we can actually get some proof around it of the number of vaccine
[2:38:22.200 --> 2:38:27.000]  injured who are going to be disabled and can't go to war and it's not it's not an insignificant
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:33.320]  number um and that itself is designed to collapse society and then make us accept euthanasia
[2:38:33.320 --> 2:38:36.920]  and things to quote you know take the load off i mean i can really see the subduction here
[2:38:36.920 --> 2:38:41.320]  and i totally agree with you it's getting media and more doctors and scientists and financial
[2:38:41.320 --> 2:38:46.840]  experts and academics and clergy and and auto mechanics and everybody to speak up and say no
[2:38:46.840 --> 2:38:50.760]  and expose what's happening and we've already gotten a lot of the way there look how they're
[2:38:50.760 --> 2:38:58.520]  pulling back their whole covid power grab right now no i agree i mean look i believe that um myself
[2:38:58.520 --> 2:39:06.680]  and others have um had an impact in that under the surface the the people who are you know
[2:39:06.680 --> 2:39:13.480]  involved in this are getting nervous i mean fauci's uh floated his retirement rachel walenski
[2:39:14.120 --> 2:39:19.320]  is starting to you know and by the way physical fear is easy to see he was always very arrogant
[2:39:19.320 --> 2:39:26.200]  he looks like he's scared to death that's a good thing isn't it oh absolutely absolutely um it's
[2:39:26.200 --> 2:39:32.440]  something it's something we should be proud of um but i want to see these vaccination programs halted
[2:39:32.440 --> 2:39:38.200]  stop i mean they're still going on we're still jobbing people we're still mandating college
[2:39:38.200 --> 2:39:43.880]  students get these things we're still mandating first responders hospital workers some corporations
[2:39:43.880 --> 2:39:51.640]  are still demanding boosters this this this needs to stop um but you know rachel walenski
[2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:57.160]  she came out this weekend uh saying that you know she got her information from or two weekends ago
[2:39:57.160 --> 2:40:03.640]  since you got her information from cn cnn i mean are you kidding me and then now she's claiming
[2:40:03.640 --> 2:40:07.880]  you know they changed the data and removed some covid deaths and they're saying oh it was a coding
[2:40:07.880 --> 2:40:15.960]  logic program era and uh and let's go over that the cdc head now is denying any guilt or culpability
[2:40:15.960 --> 2:40:21.560]  saying she got her news from cnn now before cnn said you're not allowed to question the cdc
[2:40:21.560 --> 2:40:26.280]  so now the snake's eating itself saying oh i got it from cnn i mean that i mean for folks that don't
[2:40:26.280 --> 2:40:34.680]  know at a regulatory level this is complete collapse oh absolutely absolutely i don't mean
[2:40:34.680 --> 2:40:41.960]  interrupt go back to her sorry no no i agree 100 alex i mean it's it's it's circular logic cnn says
[2:40:41.960 --> 2:40:48.200]  cdc is the authority and uh cdc head says cnn's the authority i mean what kind of kabuki theater
[2:40:48.200 --> 2:40:54.280]  is this um but you know good to go back to what she did recently Naomi wolf pointed out that uh
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:41:02.120]  you know she um you know claimed that the uh deaths that they dropped out of the covid counting
[2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:09.160]  numbers uh was due to a coding logic error and i am we wolf pointed out that you know she runs
[2:41:09.160 --> 2:41:13.880]  the company she said you know you provide the programmers with the logic itself so that makes
[2:41:13.880 --> 2:41:19.480]  no sense again she's not even a good liar uh this uh this rachel wilminsky you're really
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:25.160]  going to predicting what comes next with their hysterical collapse and then running around
[2:41:25.160 --> 2:41:29.400]  like chickens with their heads cut off what do you expect to happen next with them well this is
[2:41:29.400 --> 2:41:36.200]  this is so bad uh and you know we're working behind the scenes to get the insurance companies
[2:41:36.200 --> 2:41:41.160]  on board and aware of what's going on i suspect some of them are that you know you gotta understand
[2:41:41.160 --> 2:41:46.600]  something about the insurance uh industry it's a slow moving industry um and they all got the jabs
[2:41:46.600 --> 2:41:51.880]  uh because they thought you know they bought into this as well they were fooled and defrauded
[2:41:52.520 --> 2:41:56.360]  so there's gonna you know we're trying to work as fast as we can behind the scenes but
[2:41:57.160 --> 2:42:01.880]  it's gonna take you know some time to change some minds but all we need is a couple brave
[2:42:02.440 --> 2:42:07.800]  CEOs and some insurance companies to go hey wait a minute uh we're the bag holders on this uh
[2:42:07.800 --> 2:42:12.680]  this catastrophe known as the vaccine and you know once they once they wake up to the fact
[2:42:12.680 --> 2:42:19.160]  that there's gonna be excess death for years to come and injuries and disabilities uh i don't
[2:42:19.160 --> 2:42:22.920]  think they're gonna put up with it for too much well that's right and they want to be seen as getting
[2:42:22.920 --> 2:42:26.120]  ahead of this when this all comes out i could tell you people that have talked to a lot of people
[2:42:26.120 --> 2:42:30.440]  who talked to trump he was believing this he meant well he got lied to he wanted to open the economy
[2:42:30.440 --> 2:42:35.000]  now he's served misconstituents notice he didn't open his mouth for about a month about the vaccine
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:39.160]  so trump now it's starting to get it so that's another piece of good news ever down final segment
[2:42:39.160 --> 2:42:44.520]  straight ahead incredible work he's doing everybody should follow him on twitter and on getter and
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:48.600]  we just need more people liking to bring the numbers together and get them out of the public
[2:42:48.600 --> 2:42:52.200]  he's been totally vindicated by all of it we'll be right back in full wars dot com
[2:42:56.840 --> 2:43:03.960]  our world is so full of hype we're force-fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media
[2:43:03.960 --> 2:43:09.560]  by the controlled churches and the universities and why is this the case because we innately
[2:43:09.560 --> 2:43:15.240]  by god have been given the keys for our own minds our own psyches our own souls and by
[2:43:15.240 --> 2:43:21.480]  connecting to god we can empower ourselves and trend sin the quote fallen or sinful state
[2:43:22.360 --> 2:43:27.240]  so the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to
[2:43:27.240 --> 2:43:32.520]  to change who we are are only lowering us they're only making us more depressed and the end they're
[2:43:32.520 --> 2:43:37.800]  only making us less filled it is only by going within and really making that connection to god
[2:43:37.800 --> 2:43:43.320]  that we can truly empower ourselves that's why the globe was bombardous and toxins and chemicals
[2:43:43.320 --> 2:43:47.960]  to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be
[2:43:47.960 --> 2:43:53.160]  healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension and that's where the

[2:45:47.400 --> 2:45:51.240]  ways that we could all be involved that we could all be effective so that's what i'm calling about
[2:45:51.240 --> 2:45:56.680]  god bless you chris in Atlanta i really really appreciate you calling us today thank you so much
[2:45:56.680 --> 2:46:01.720]  the eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans they financed major
[2:46:01.720 --> 2:46:07.400]  universities they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda of
[2:46:07.400 --> 2:46:12.120]  the new york times other major newspapers that the family as we know it is a bad thing
[2:46:12.760 --> 2:46:18.600]  and must be ended and the first step in that is getting women out of the household teaching women
[2:46:18.600 --> 2:46:23.640]  that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing
[2:46:23.640 --> 2:46:28.600]  and i was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter my four national daughter my wife
[2:46:28.600 --> 2:46:33.000]  makes dinner a lot of times but i like to make it as well i love to make breakfast and literally
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:38.920]  it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nutritious and then all sit down
[2:46:38.920 --> 2:46:44.600]  together and have the communal event and that's what the system is attacking and bombarding
[2:46:44.600 --> 2:46:50.600]  is our normal biological actions are coming together they really are sick evil scientific
[2:46:50.600 --> 2:46:55.800]  cult of filth and will domesticate us and turn us into lab rats that we cannot let this continue
[2:46:55.800 --> 2:47:12.280]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:25.000]  again just as edward dowd was just saying from the old show show thanks for joining us
[2:47:25.640 --> 2:47:29.480]  that this isn't about him it's not about me it's about survival that's what we need that the attitude
[2:47:29.480 --> 2:47:33.720]  we need is this not about personalities it's not about liberal conservative black white old young
[2:47:33.720 --> 2:47:39.320]  christian muslim any of that this is about corporate tyranny megabanks that have Ponzi schemes
[2:47:39.320 --> 2:47:43.000]  that have been going for decades that are coming to an end they don't have a way to pump the bubble
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:50.840]  up anymore and they want a global crisis to smoke screen a new monetary system and they want to get
[2:47:50.840 --> 2:47:55.080]  rid of a lot of old people and bill gates has said that he wants death panels to kill old people he
[2:47:55.080 --> 2:47:59.320]  says that's a solution it's ridiculous you build a more complex society you take care of the old
[2:47:59.320 --> 2:48:03.880]  folks it's a non-zero some game uh that's that's what real economics is but they have this twisted
[2:48:03.880 --> 2:48:08.680]  kinsy in view and so as the god has been successful in the economy as a wall street professional and
[2:48:08.680 --> 2:48:14.280]  a stock picker from black rock hsbc you name it edward doubt what is wrong with this globalist
[2:48:14.280 --> 2:48:20.200]  black rock end of days end of game uh end of bubble mode where just because they're about
[2:48:20.200 --> 2:48:25.320]  to implode instead of being honest if you go to prison like bernie made off now they just want to
[2:48:25.320 --> 2:48:29.960]  start nuclear war or they want to they want to cut off the resources i mean because i see them
[2:48:29.960 --> 2:48:34.040]  bragging claus swabb that this is how they're going to reset this is how they're going to get
[2:48:34.040 --> 2:48:40.040]  out of what they've done and i just don't see it working because many people from tucker carlson
[2:48:40.040 --> 2:48:45.480]  to joe rogan to you to steve bannon to roger stone to alex jones to a million others and a
[2:48:45.480 --> 2:48:50.200]  billion other people taking action have exposed them so they're trying to commit the rest of this
[2:48:50.200 --> 2:48:55.480]  crime in the bright lights of publicity they're not going to get away with it i mean anybody
[2:48:55.480 --> 2:49:00.840]  knows that now so we've got to give them a path like giving putin a path to leave ukraine or to
[2:49:00.840 --> 2:49:06.280]  declare victory and go how do how do we give them a path to extricate themselves because if they
[2:49:06.280 --> 2:49:10.600]  want to be like napoleon and want to go live on an island with a hundred of their troops i would say
[2:49:10.600 --> 2:49:16.200]  hey keep some of your stolen money to stop killing us because i know if we corner them and keep pushing
[2:49:16.200 --> 2:49:19.880]  they're going to pull more dirty tricks but instead they just seem to have a care in the world at
[2:49:19.880 --> 2:49:23.960]  least the controllers their minions do like falchi and seem to be steaming forward
[2:49:23.960 --> 2:49:35.480]  you know that someone who is involved in this fraud needs to come forward and needs to start
[2:49:35.480 --> 2:49:44.200]  naming names because like you said the chaos that's going to ensue is going to be uncontrollable
[2:49:44.920 --> 2:49:52.280]  right and when the rule of law breaks down and you're you know you think your your security
[2:49:52.280 --> 2:49:57.400]  guards are going to be there and your staff is going to be there when they're worried about
[2:49:57.400 --> 2:50:05.320]  their own families well you might want to check on that secondly you know you know i'm not what
[2:50:05.320 --> 2:50:11.400]  i'm about to say i haven't thought i'm not involved in i'm not going to be a part of but i can see
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:17.080]  as time rolls on and the truth comes out to more and more people i can see the people
[2:50:17.080 --> 2:50:22.440]  who bought into this the heaviest the covidians and the people promoting the jab that weren't part
[2:50:22.440 --> 2:50:30.920]  of the inner circle of this fraud will be angry and they might you know have star chambers where
[2:50:31.960 --> 2:50:36.360]  you know hit squads come after some of these people so it's not us that they have to worry
[2:50:36.360 --> 2:50:42.600]  about it's the ones that they actually deceive to wake up who are mad as hell and the chaos will
[2:50:42.600 --> 2:50:47.800]  be uncontrollable and i'm not going to be involved in any of that i'm not planning that i'm not not
[2:50:47.800 --> 2:50:55.080]  my thing but as a predictor of the future you can't control what other people do and there will
[2:50:55.080 --> 2:51:01.240]  be people that probably want to do that so come forward now so you can be protected and go through
[2:51:01.240 --> 2:51:07.160]  the justice system edward dow that is perfectly said that's exactly where i am there's no military
[2:51:07.160 --> 2:51:11.880]  solution in this because it's cultural it's economic in the solution is being aware of the
[2:51:11.880 --> 2:51:16.680]  scam and not supporting it so i i mean i saw articles everywhere i haven't responded to today
[2:51:17.400 --> 2:51:23.320]  saying alex jones secret service says alex jones tried to go kidnap pence secret service didn't
[2:51:23.320 --> 2:51:28.680]  say that it's not true it's totally made up but the system's so desperate now they're giving
[2:51:28.680 --> 2:51:34.200]  orders to major publications to do stuff that i'd easily want a defamation suit it take a million
[2:51:34.200 --> 2:51:39.800]  bucks to do it take years to get it done but they are so desperate now that instead of backing off
[2:51:39.800 --> 2:51:46.040]  of lies they're escalating and they're trying to frame me as a violent revolutionary leader
[2:51:46.040 --> 2:51:51.720]  they're saying with 231 days out homeland security they believe that a patriot movement will launch
[2:51:51.720 --> 2:51:57.400]  terror attacks well that's their excuse to suspend to suspend the election and so i can see what's
[2:51:57.400 --> 2:52:01.320]  happening that's why i'm not getting involved in the military i'm not going to shoot or kill
[2:52:01.320 --> 2:52:06.200]  anybody i don't have any plans i'm not commanding troops in the field i'm not a military person
[2:52:06.200 --> 2:52:11.400]  and i don't say that as a coward i'm not going to go perform a brain surgery when somebody's been
[2:52:11.400 --> 2:52:14.920]  in a car wreck because i don't know the first thing about it plus i don't believe the military
[2:52:14.920 --> 2:52:20.280]  solution is the answer it's a spiritual cultural economic solution but definitely you're a
[2:52:20.280 --> 2:52:26.200]  trans forecaster you can see them setting the table for a civil war in this country which i will
[2:52:26.200 --> 2:52:33.720]  not participate in i agree i'm with you and you know i'm just i'm just looking into the future
[2:52:33.720 --> 2:52:39.960]  if there is the chaos we predict um again it won't be it won't be people who are aware of what's
[2:52:39.960 --> 2:52:45.400]  going on we're going to be unvaccinated uh taking care of our families and you know just trying to
[2:52:45.400 --> 2:52:51.240]  get by you know i don't have any grand plan to do anything but the people who um are going to have
[2:52:51.240 --> 2:52:56.760]  mental breakdowns and snap those are the ones they have to worry about and uh i'd like to add
[2:52:56.760 --> 2:53:03.160]  an addition to my movie script about what might happen um i think we're going to win i think
[2:53:03.160 --> 2:53:07.960]  these people will be brought to justice that have committed these crimes but you know
[2:53:09.720 --> 2:53:16.760]  what if that let's let's pretend that's the plan they they think they're the ones
[2:53:17.480 --> 2:53:22.120]  they're going to inherit the keys to the the global kingdom but what if there's people behind them
[2:53:22.760 --> 2:53:29.720]  who have propped them up as these clownish uh evil puppets i mean claus Schwab is a bond
[2:53:29.720 --> 2:53:37.320]  villain uh you know these these people are almost clownishly evil what if um in my movie script um
[2:53:37.320 --> 2:53:43.160]  in the midst of the chaos we think we win and we get these people in the justice but then some very
[2:53:43.160 --> 2:53:49.320]  handsome guys and gals come out of somewhere else with a solution and a new a new way to get our
[2:53:49.320 --> 2:53:54.120]  way out of this chaos and economic collapse and they told us it's eat bugs and drink sewage and
[2:53:54.120 --> 2:53:59.640]  live in communes they've they've i mean i went to the un eight months ago to cover some stuff in
[2:53:59.640 --> 2:54:04.440]  new york and they had giant signs up saying soon you'll own nothing and live in communes and it
[2:54:04.440 --> 2:54:09.400]  showed like bomb shelters in israel and i was like what the what do you think this telling us you'll
[2:54:09.400 --> 2:54:13.880]  eat bugs you'll have nothing you'll love the great reset if i was going to sell something i mean i'd
[2:54:13.880 --> 2:54:18.520]  sell something good or if i was evil i'd lie about it why are they like you'll have nothing and it's
[2:54:18.520 --> 2:54:25.080]  going to be ill eat bugs and drink sewage what the hell well it's it's alex it's so absurd
[2:54:25.800 --> 2:54:32.120]  that when someone more reasonable and good-looking like a damien thorn from the omen comes forth with
[2:54:32.120 --> 2:54:37.960]  a better reasonable sounding solution well you know that's the one we have to worry about the one
[2:54:37.960 --> 2:54:43.880]  that sounds reasonable from very very um convincing people i get it's not giving us they're telling us
[2:54:43.880 --> 2:54:48.920]  they're the villains so the savior can enter from the other side of the stage that's correct i'm just
[2:54:48.920 --> 2:54:54.040]  saying that's that's a potential movie no no no no no you are i should have been saying that's it
[2:54:54.040 --> 2:54:59.000]  that's the final piece they're setting us up for the savior who'll be oh my god so who do you think
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:05.800]  that might be or how do you see that happening i i have no idea but uh let's say my movie script
[2:55:05.800 --> 2:55:12.280]  plays out and there's chaos and we bring these people to justice i'll be looking for the um
[2:55:12.280 --> 2:55:16.600]  very reasonable men and women who have a solution already on hand
[2:55:18.520 --> 2:55:22.920]  wow all right you always impress edward and and there's so many great people like you
[2:55:23.480 --> 2:55:27.240]  that aren't the shadows you're just buying your own business uh that are starting to come forward
[2:55:27.240 --> 2:55:32.280]  i think that's going to be the solution is the professionals in every walk of life that say enough
[2:55:32.280 --> 2:55:39.720]  is enough i agree and i need more people from wall street and uh the professional class to
[2:55:39.720 --> 2:55:44.600]  join me i mean you're silent because you're scared about your job well i got news for you if this
[2:55:45.480 --> 2:55:51.320]  the global um collapse comes you know your job's not gonna i mean it's not gonna be there i agree
[2:55:51.320 --> 2:55:56.200]  we can't stop the crash we get the landing gear down and maybe not kill ourselves how long do you
[2:55:56.200 --> 2:56:01.480]  have do you think until things are going to be really really really bad if more people don't
[2:56:01.480 --> 2:56:07.480]  come forward and blow the whistle how long do these folks have do you think um well you know
[2:56:07.480 --> 2:56:12.120]  timing's always a problem in these situations especially when you're trying to make money or
[2:56:12.120 --> 2:56:17.880]  trade so that's why i'm not giving investment advice as to the timing of this but it seems to me
[2:56:17.880 --> 2:56:24.440]  if i look at the federal reserve and what they just did uh on wednesday they raised 25 basis
[2:56:24.440 --> 2:56:30.120]  points okay uh they were supposed to raise 50 or people wanted them to raise 50 to help fight
[2:56:30.120 --> 2:56:36.760]  inflation i've seen an analysis that shows that the fed rate hike cycle is basically over before
[2:56:36.760 --> 2:56:42.440]  began because the system is at the end days and the lever there's so much leverage in the system
[2:56:42.440 --> 2:56:49.640]  it can't handle even tiny upticks and interest rates so the timing is a lot closer than i would
[2:56:49.640 --> 2:56:56.120]  have thought so i'll say anywhere between the next six to 24 months i totally agree i've talked to a
[2:56:56.120 --> 2:57:01.720]  spectrum of very important smart folks and they said six months to a year and a half maximum
[2:57:01.720 --> 2:57:08.120]  until there's no turning it back correct that's my belief and uh i hope i'm wrong i mean this is a
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:13.000]  call i'd like to be absolutely dead wrong on because it's not going to be i mean no one's
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:18.040]  going to be able to hide yeah who wants this all right edward dowd thank you so much very impressive

[3:00:17.400 --> 3:00:22.280]  just like i did in this segment yesterday it's very very important and i want you to know
[3:00:22.280 --> 3:00:27.240]  just in a few minutes here some of the history so you can understand what we're up against
[3:00:27.240 --> 3:00:37.320]  i've been syndicated by gcn for 25 years and i've been in the time slot we're in for 23 years
[3:00:37.320 --> 3:00:41.560]  the rush limbaugh slot they wanted me to go up against limbaugh i didn't want to but
[3:00:41.560 --> 3:00:46.040]  ted said you got the job i'll pay the money i'll put you on all these stations if you do it and
[3:00:46.040 --> 3:00:52.920]  we exploded from day one and over the years talk radio's gotten in trouble and collapsed and
[3:00:52.920 --> 3:00:58.520]  gotten small with the audiences has per capita but still together it's huge we have 300 plus
[3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:05.400]  affiliates we reach millions of people a day through them and ted owns a few other companies
[3:01:05.400 --> 3:01:11.880]  and he went from gcn being very very popular and very very profitable to still being extremely
[3:01:12.520 --> 3:01:19.400]  popular with 750 plus affiliates and over 60 shows they syndicate gardening shows
[3:01:19.400 --> 3:01:25.320]  liberal shows conservative shows and he's just been putting his own money in the last three years
[3:01:25.320 --> 3:01:34.360]  into it and and and and breaking even but the democrat party anti-gun group we never say their
[3:01:34.360 --> 3:01:39.320]  name because they live off us we don't live off them they sued him over the years he spent something
[3:01:39.320 --> 3:01:43.400]  like a half million dollars fighting him in the last four years and finally they came to him a few
[3:01:43.400 --> 3:01:49.320]  months ago and they said just give us that network take alex jones off the air and we'll forgive you
[3:01:49.320 --> 3:01:54.760]  but if you don't we're going to destroy you and they and they sent his insurance company a threat of
[3:01:54.760 --> 3:02:02.280]  500 million dollars this is just ridiculous and preposterous if you know for our free speech if
[3:02:02.280 --> 3:02:06.840]  he didn't turn things over they want me off the air which is ridiculous because we're already
[3:02:06.840 --> 3:02:11.480]  syndicated ourselves years ago but ted's still there and we got over 80 affiliates with him
[3:02:12.200 --> 3:02:15.800]  and so i told ted i said what do you need to go through the trial of these people coming up this
[3:02:15.800 --> 3:02:20.200]  summer and he said well they tell me about 300 000 dollars if you'll just get me half of that
[3:02:20.200 --> 3:02:23.720]  because ted's you know getting a super rich guy he's blown through a lot of his money over the
[3:02:23.720 --> 3:02:29.560]  years keeping us on air he said i will i will i will not basically just close this place uh
[3:02:29.560 --> 3:02:36.440]  he said that's what they're saying and so we put out the address it gives him go of save gcn.com
[3:02:37.720 --> 3:02:44.360]  and listeners raised about 25 000 dollars and that's that's great i appreciate that but
[3:02:45.320 --> 3:02:52.040]  we need to raise him over 100 000 dollars and he'll match the money to fight these people over the
[3:02:52.040 --> 3:02:56.760]  next year or so and not just give in to what they want and again the world will be a whole
[3:02:56.760 --> 3:03:01.480]  another place in a year we need to stay on air now we're not worried about the money our networks
[3:03:01.480 --> 3:03:09.160]  any of this we're just simply trying to fight hard until the end with this whole with this whole
[3:03:09.160 --> 3:03:15.960]  situation and so um it all goes to keep us on the air and to stand up for ted that stood up for
[3:03:15.960 --> 3:03:25.240]  freedom show long and and to fight this legal battle save gcn.com save gcn.com and uh you know
[3:03:25.240 --> 3:03:30.200]  they need to raise 80 000 dollars at least or i told him i said i'll pay for it i don't have that
[3:03:30.200 --> 3:03:34.920]  extra money right now but i'll i'll get it one way or another i sold my house i've been putting
[3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:39.480]  all the money into keep this place going the last three months that's fine but i mean we're down to
[3:03:39.480 --> 3:03:45.160]  the wire just like you see in the news with war and covid and all of it this is the beginning of
[3:03:45.720 --> 3:03:50.520]  very serious times so we need to stay on air and god's working through you to keep us on air

[3:04:09.560 --> 3:04:14.840]  they're literally trying to shut down the radio network we're on one way or another to get us
[3:04:14.840 --> 3:04:20.440]  and that'd be like you know cutting our left hand off it wouldn't feel good we could keep fighting
[3:04:20.440 --> 3:04:25.160]  but it's definitely them just hacking through burning through getting the bank accounts taking
[3:04:25.160 --> 3:04:30.200]  the sponsors suing us de-platforming us just attack attack attack and that's fine because
[3:04:30.200 --> 3:04:33.720]  they're going down the new owners going down everybody's aware of who they are what they're
[3:04:33.720 --> 3:04:42.040]  up to but we need to stay in attack formation to the end and not stop so go to gcn save gcn.com

[3:06:18.760 --> 3:06:26.600]  x head of respiratory research at fizer mike yedden and researchers including kreg part of
[3:06:26.600 --> 3:06:35.080]  cooper have sourced veyors data on vaccine death and injury in the u.s a database of over 700 000
[3:06:35.080 --> 3:06:42.840]  adverse reactions caused by the medirna fizer and jansen vaccines these vaccines have been deployed
[3:06:42.840 --> 3:06:49.640]  in different batches officially referred to as lots this has allowed yedden's team to back engineer
[3:06:49.640 --> 3:06:56.600]  big pharma's cov 19 vaccine deployment agenda in the u.s all their information is published at
[3:06:56.600 --> 3:07:04.920]  how bad is my batch dot com and how bad dot info and what we learn is quite telling about 0.5
[3:07:04.920 --> 3:07:11.800]  percent of all the different batches are highly toxic resulting in hospitalization disability and
[3:07:11.800 --> 3:07:18.680]  death within days or weeks of injection other batches cause minimal adverse reactions and most
[3:07:18.680 --> 3:07:25.080]  appear to be harmless placebo's when plotting on a timeline we can see that these three companies
[3:07:25.080 --> 3:07:30.760]  have been working together to quietly monitor the lethal effectiveness of specific deadly batches
[3:07:31.800 --> 3:07:37.640]  while one company is deploying a lethal batch the other two deploy harmless ones creating the
[3:07:37.640 --> 3:07:44.280]  scientific environment to perform dose range finding or the maximum tolerated dose for each
[3:07:44.280 --> 3:07:51.160]  specific batch the timeline shows that each lethal batch deployment is preceded and followed
[3:07:51.160 --> 3:07:57.240]  by a quiet period allowing them time to establish their baseline before the next deadly batch is
[3:07:57.240 --> 3:08:04.520]  deployed private leaked documents from the cdc show a list of expiry dates and only certain
[3:08:04.520 --> 3:08:10.440]  lots are included the very same lots found to be highly toxic in part of cooper's database
[3:08:11.160 --> 3:08:17.480]  which makes sense there would be no reason to list expiration dates for saline placebo only the
[3:08:17.480 --> 3:08:23.960]  deadly ones this mode of deployment allows governments the ability to direct deadly batches
[3:08:23.960 --> 3:08:31.560]  into specific populations such as red states analysis of the number of dying per 100,000
[3:08:31.560 --> 3:08:37.160]  vaccinated in 50 states shows us that the overwhelming majority of vaccine deaths are
[3:08:37.160 --> 3:08:44.120]  happening in red states some red states are experiencing 11 times more vaccine deaths than
[3:08:44.120 --> 3:08:49.880]  other states on average red states are experiencing twice the amount of vaccine death and injuries
[3:08:49.880 --> 3:08:55.320]  than blue states after ruling out other possibilities part of cooper concluded that
[3:08:55.320 --> 3:09:00.440]  this can only be due to the fact that red states received at least twice as much of the lethal
[3:09:00.440 --> 3:09:07.960]  batches than blue states did among several other crimes they are tipping the scales of the democratic

[3:10:01.800 --> 3:10:09.800]  weather's much improved and nice blue skies outside the day so alex decided to ask me if i
[3:10:09.800 --> 3:10:14.360]  wanted to be a guest host so i said sure why not so we'll discuss some of the things some of the
[3:10:14.360 --> 3:10:24.840]  topics that are important so i wanted to go to this uh meme here guys can you show this overhead
[3:10:24.840 --> 3:10:29.880]  i have a series of memes that i printed out to kind of help guide me through this so you know
[3:10:29.880 --> 3:10:37.080]  this first one i wanted to talk about is actually a quote from 1984 from george orwell book and
[3:10:37.080 --> 3:10:42.520]  it's an important quote sort of relevant to today the party told you to reject the evidence of your
[3:10:42.520 --> 3:10:50.840]  eyes and ears it was their final most essential command now does that sound familiar when you
[3:10:50.840 --> 3:11:02.120]  look at this settled science genetically x y is male x x x is female anything else is a genetic
[3:11:02.120 --> 3:11:09.080]  abnormality no human can ever change their sex this is settled science okay the the pc
[3:11:09.080 --> 3:11:17.320]  kami covid cult they follow fake fauci science okay they want you to believe men can get pregnant
[3:11:17.320 --> 3:11:24.760]  people can change their sex uh they want you also to believe that poison is a vaccine okay poison is
[3:11:24.760 --> 3:11:31.960]  not a vaccine m r and a gene therapy is poison and uh it's killing people all over the globe
[3:11:31.960 --> 3:11:38.040]  as alex just discussed with mr doubt the evidence is in it's overwhelming there's just a mountain
[3:11:38.040 --> 3:11:43.080]  amount of evidence certainly if anyone were to look at open varies dot com you can see the data
[3:11:43.080 --> 3:11:51.320]  there for yourself so what we've witnessed here over the past two years is a bioterror war on the
[3:11:51.320 --> 3:11:57.000]  public of the world the entire world this is a great conspiracy uh planned by the world economic
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:12:03.720]  forum uh leaders like uh nazi claus schwa bill gates have held george sorras marks this mark
[3:12:03.720 --> 3:12:12.120]  kuckerberg uh on and on those people their agenda is an evil anti god atheist agenda
[3:12:12.120 --> 3:12:16.360]  they're a transhumanist they believe in editing the human genome because they think they're
[3:12:16.360 --> 3:12:23.800]  smarter than god and the new you know i have bad news for them they're wrong um so they want to try
[3:12:23.800 --> 3:12:28.840]  to force this gene editing poison onto the masses and they've already done so and five billion people
[3:12:28.840 --> 3:12:34.520]  have already taken this poison so we're we're left in this weird predicament of now that
[3:12:34.520 --> 3:12:39.880]  all the lies have been exposed by the doctors pretty effectively in 2021 a lot of you know
[3:12:39.880 --> 3:12:46.840]  early on a lot of us in 2020 spoke up but even as recently as you know uh 2021 going into 2022
[3:12:46.840 --> 3:12:55.000]  all the various doctors like dr mccullough and dr malone joe rogan show uh etc we've all spoken out
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:13:01.480]  and let the public know so the the the great lie has been exposed so now of course they have to
[3:13:01.480 --> 3:13:09.160]  switch the narrative to ukraine and then they try to prop up uh zalinsky as some sort of hero
[3:13:09.160 --> 3:13:15.560]  and he claims he's you know promoting democracy in ukraine which is kind of ironic he is he's a
[3:13:15.560 --> 3:13:20.840]  totalitarian he's banned all these political parties he's working with the world economic forum
[3:13:20.840 --> 3:13:25.400]  uh so he is our enemy basically so all these people are claiming that we should be back
[3:13:25.400 --> 3:13:31.160]  ukraine and try to get in the war with russia or trying to promote world war people need to realize
[3:13:31.160 --> 3:13:37.480]  that is part of the great reset plan their whole plan is to instigate world war they want a nuclear
[3:13:37.480 --> 3:13:43.080]  war because they want to kill as many people as they can uh and we can prove that if you look at
[3:13:43.080 --> 3:13:49.640]  the georgia guide stones image i printed out if anybody knows about the georgia guide stones i'm
[3:13:49.640 --> 3:13:57.160]  sure a lot of the listeners do um the georgia guide stones their target population goal is
[3:13:57.160 --> 3:14:03.960]  here it is they won't have they won't half a billion people uh as their target population now
[3:14:03.960 --> 3:14:09.880]  i read another book uh that said their population goal was one billion so the what their goal is
[3:14:09.880 --> 3:14:14.120]  is debatable what they're in population goal is debatable but what's not debatable is that they
[3:14:14.120 --> 3:14:18.920]  intend on killing a whole lot of people to get there and so if there's somewhere between seven
[3:14:18.920 --> 3:14:23.480]  eight billion people right now and they want to get to even if it's just one billion that means
[3:14:23.480 --> 3:14:30.360]  they plan on murdering six or seven billion people um and so they've already given out five billion
[3:14:30.360 --> 3:14:39.880]  doses of this uh c19 fake vaccine gene editing poison so um the first thing the most important
[3:14:39.880 --> 3:14:45.080]  thing and it's what i try to focus on every time i talk uh with the media is the idea that we need
[3:14:45.080 --> 3:14:51.000]  to ban the poison because everything keeps getting worse we keep descending into into chaos until the
[3:14:51.000 --> 3:14:56.920]  poison is banned um nothing will get better we keep giving out poison to the public pretending
[3:14:56.920 --> 3:15:02.280]  it's a safe and effective vaccine well it's any it's easy to predict that all that's going to happen
[3:15:02.280 --> 3:15:06.440]  is more and more people are going to die the evidence is overwhelming now there's so much
[3:15:06.440 --> 3:15:13.240]  evidence of all the excess mortality excess overall deaths um that the the case is closed the
[3:15:13.240 --> 3:15:19.000]  science is settled the COVID-19 vaccines are not real vaccines at all they are gene editing poison
[3:15:19.000 --> 3:15:23.400]  and and i'm going to keep repeating the same talking point over and over again because there's
[3:15:23.400 --> 3:15:28.680]  so many victims out there and i hear from them every day they come to our to myfreedoctor.com
[3:15:28.680 --> 3:15:32.520]  and uh they won't help with their symptoms that they're having that that they developed after their
[3:15:33.080 --> 3:15:39.320]  dose of poison so we try to do the best we can to to deliver the treatment to them uh and so
[3:15:39.320 --> 3:15:43.960]  we will continue to do that at myfreedoctor.com and i would encourage everybody whether you're
[3:15:43.960 --> 3:15:47.880]  vaccinated or any of your healthcare needs to go to myfreedoctor.com and we'll try to do our best

[3:17:07.560 --> 3:17:13.000]  for this and people are really waking up right now but we had to build our own infrastructure
[3:17:13.000 --> 3:17:17.960]  because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars and now
[3:17:17.960 --> 3:17:23.160]  with bandot video getting close to 10 million views a day we're a platform for thousands
[3:17:23.160 --> 3:17:29.640]  of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge and because
[3:17:29.640 --> 3:17:36.680]  it's become so successful it's a catch 22 info wars and bandot video have become a mothership
[3:17:36.680 --> 3:17:42.840]  promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of
[3:17:42.840 --> 3:17:47.560]  dollars a quarter hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month so the biggest sale
[3:17:47.560 --> 3:17:52.760]  in info wars history is going right now the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75 off getting

[3:18:49.320 --> 3:19:03.480]  our world is so full of hype we are force-fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media
[3:19:03.480 --> 3:19:09.640]  by the controlled churches and the universities why is this the case because we innately by god
[3:19:10.520 --> 3:19:15.720]  have been given the keys for our own minds our own psyches our own souls and by connecting to god we
[3:19:15.720 --> 3:19:23.000]  can empower ourselves and transcend the quote fallen or sinful state so the chemicals that we
[3:19:23.000 --> 3:19:29.640]  ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to change who we are are only lowering
[3:19:29.640 --> 3:19:34.280]  us they're only making us more depressed from the end they're only making us less fulfilled it is
[3:19:34.280 --> 3:19:39.640]  only by going within and really making that connection to god that we can truly empower ourselves
[3:19:39.640 --> 3:19:44.360]  that's why the globalist bombardous toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal
[3:19:44.360 --> 3:19:49.640]  vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to
[3:19:49.640 --> 3:19:53.960]  basically reach out beyond the third dimension and that's what the incredible products come in
[3:19:53.960 --> 3:20:03.400]  at m4store.com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:20:03.400 --> 3:20:14.360]  all right all right welcome back to the show a great day to be alive
[3:20:15.240 --> 3:20:21.480]  here at the war studio i'm dr ben marvel guest host today for the fourth hour i wanted to read
[3:20:21.480 --> 3:20:29.480]  a little something i wrote here relative with respect to judge jackson who's a supreme court
[3:20:29.480 --> 3:20:34.680]  nominee being grilled by congress this week i'm sorry miss jackson but i am for real so here is
[3:20:34.680 --> 3:20:40.360]  the 800 pound gorilla question nobody in congress has the balls to ask it's alleged that the hunter
[3:20:40.360 --> 3:20:45.800]  biden laptop from hell showed hunter biden raping his niece who was a miner at the time
[3:20:47.320 --> 3:20:53.800]  you've had a history of being soft on pedophilia and child porn so if this is true about hunter biden
[3:20:53.800 --> 3:21:00.440]  raping his niece would you set her biden free or send him to prison i wish somebody in congress
[3:21:00.440 --> 3:21:04.600]  would ask her that question because it's an important question that needs to be asked
[3:21:05.960 --> 3:21:12.040]  okay so i'm gonna go to this meme here i wrote up and this i'm gonna talk about the
[3:21:12.040 --> 3:21:17.320]  covid-19 vaccine again if you want to be a genetically modified organism that's fine you
[3:21:17.320 --> 3:21:22.440]  can be a genetically modified organism if you want but if you think forcing other people to
[3:21:22.440 --> 3:21:28.760]  become a genetically modified organism is a good idea then you're just evil what part of
[3:21:28.760 --> 3:21:33.800]  covid-19 vaccines turn you into a genetically modified organism don't you get and here's the
[3:21:33.800 --> 3:21:43.240]  proof very executive mRNA g mRNA shots are gene therapy marketed as vaccines to gain public trust
[3:21:43.240 --> 3:21:48.920]  we probably would have had a 95 refusal rate for these shots two years ago but the pandemic
[3:21:48.920 --> 3:21:54.360]  and marketing of the injections as vaccines has made them popular with the public said stefan
[3:21:54.360 --> 3:22:00.840]  olrich okay so they lied they renamed it they do with the the new speak 1984 george warrell
[3:22:00.840 --> 3:22:06.440]  new speak they constantly redefine words so they redefine gene therapy they redefine it as a vaccine
[3:22:07.480 --> 3:22:14.440]  and people believe the lie okay fizer ceo albert borla somebody who should be in prison
[3:22:14.440 --> 3:22:19.960]  had an hour long interview recently with frederick kemp of the ellenic council council in which he
[3:22:19.960 --> 3:22:26.920]  calls mRNA shots gene editing which is an omission that mRNA jabs are not vaccines borla also claims
[3:22:26.920 --> 3:22:34.280]  that scientists can repair the mistakes in dna or in other words they can play god all right so
[3:22:34.920 --> 3:22:42.200]  here is uh what was supposed to happen with the covid-19 vaccines versus what actually happened
[3:22:42.200 --> 3:22:47.800]  one plus one equals two the covid-19 vaccine plus time equals more covid-19 what was supposed to
[3:22:47.800 --> 3:22:52.680]  happen as you vaccinated more as more people were vaccinated you were supposed to see less
[3:22:52.680 --> 3:22:57.320]  covid but what we are actually seeing is more vaccination way more covid this is occurring
[3:22:57.320 --> 3:23:04.440]  in every country in the world okay so it's clear proof the covid-19 vaccines are dangerous
[3:23:05.240 --> 3:23:11.640]  poison we need to ban them as soon as possible here's how crazy the pc economy covid cult is
[3:23:11.640 --> 3:23:18.600]  how they're mass global mass psychosis the mass formation psychosis how badly it affects them
[3:23:18.600 --> 3:23:24.360]  even web and d if you had an allergic reaction to the first dose of the fizer or modern vaccines
[3:23:25.080 --> 3:23:29.080]  it's safe to get the second dose so they're claiming if you're allergic something it's okay for you
[3:23:29.080 --> 3:23:35.080]  to take it again that's complete insanity as a physician in medicine when you're allergic to
[3:23:35.080 --> 3:23:39.720]  something you never take it again you don't take it you listed as an allergy because you know you're
[3:23:39.720 --> 3:23:44.120]  allergic to it so you never take it again so the fact that they're lying telling people to
[3:23:44.120 --> 3:23:51.960]  continue taking something that they're allergic to should tell you all you need to know okay now
[3:23:51.960 --> 3:24:00.920]  back in november let me in march 18th of 2020 i was the first american physician to advocate for
[3:24:00.920 --> 3:24:05.080]  zither max hydroxychloroquine and over the counter zinc and i said at that time we haven't
[3:24:05.080 --> 3:24:10.920]  stopped flu pandemics in 100 years we won't stop covid 19 but we can stop this idiotic exercise
[3:24:10.920 --> 3:24:17.080]  and futility right so as the timeline went on back in november when they were about to release
[3:24:17.080 --> 3:24:21.560]  the covid vaccines i had done plenty of research on it read up on it that's all i do every day is
[3:24:21.560 --> 3:24:27.960]  read about these things um november 18th 2020 i let everybody know during medical school and
[3:24:27.960 --> 3:24:32.760]  residency training we were told never take a new drug until it has been out for five years let the
[3:24:32.760 --> 3:24:36.440]  public be the guinea pig guinea pigs do you really want to be the guinea pig for a rushed
[3:24:36.440 --> 3:24:43.000]  into production vaccine for a disease with a 99.99 survival rate coveted vaccine hell no my body my
[3:24:43.000 --> 3:24:49.800]  choice so i told all of our patients this do not take the poison it's not going to be safe boy am i
[3:24:49.800 --> 3:24:55.160]  glad i did that because now i'm actually able to be honest about it because the doctors who who
[3:24:55.160 --> 3:24:58.680]  recommended it for the patients they're now stuck in the legal trap they can't tell the truth
[3:24:58.680 --> 3:25:06.200]  um i also wanted to inform people if you're unfortunate enough that you wind up in a
[3:25:06.200 --> 3:25:10.760]  health hospital like these hospitals that are bribed to put patients on the pathway to death
[3:25:10.760 --> 3:25:17.640]  this is true this is fact this is easily verified fact hospitals are bribed and incentivized to
[3:25:17.640 --> 3:25:24.600]  maximize the death of the covid patients so what i tell people if you're unlucky enough to wind up
[3:25:24.600 --> 3:25:30.520]  in a health hospital how do you survive well you avoid avoiding euthanasia protocols 101 anyone who
[3:25:30.520 --> 3:25:35.560]  has the misfortune of winding up hospitalized with covid should do two things the first day you're
[3:25:35.560 --> 3:25:40.360]  there one you sign a do not intubate order that's a legal order where they cannot intubate you
[3:25:40.920 --> 3:25:46.280]  two you sign an order stating that you do not uh the order needs to state do not give me rim
[3:25:46.280 --> 3:25:51.480]  desivir under any circumstances write these exact words sign it in front of witnesses and get a video
[3:25:51.480 --> 3:25:57.480]  of it if you can because we've seen cases i've heard of multiple cases of people were left isolated
[3:25:57.480 --> 3:26:03.080]  alone they they had written that they were dnr on the chart and when the family came back the
[3:26:03.080 --> 3:26:08.280]  patient had been intubated against their will so that does happen and that's one way that they
[3:26:08.280 --> 3:26:13.880]  maximize the death so what you have to think about is you know political correctness is the greatest
[3:26:13.880 --> 3:26:18.600]  brainwashing communist propaganda tool of all time it's the most successful propaganda in human
[3:26:18.600 --> 3:26:25.880]  history and if you realize everything the pc comic covid cult favors is to maximize death
[3:26:25.880 --> 3:26:32.040]  this is why they want 10 year olds to transition to the opposite sex and takes sex hormones because
[3:26:32.040 --> 3:26:40.520]  it makes them sterile now this is why they favor all the homosexual the alphabet lgbq agenda is
[3:26:40.520 --> 3:26:47.800]  all about reducing population so they favor assisted suicide at the end of life they favor
[3:26:47.800 --> 3:26:54.680]  abortion they favor sterilizing children and certainly convincing people to sterilize themselves
[3:26:54.680 --> 3:27:00.920]  what's better than that now i read an ironic story recently about the louisville health department
[3:27:00.920 --> 3:27:08.440]  leader and she was the head of spearheading the covid-19 vaccine vaccination of the public
[3:27:08.440 --> 3:27:19.160]  lo and behold justice was served as she died after taking the covid vaccine now and this is the
[3:27:19.160 --> 3:27:27.320]  scary number this is as of march 21st 2022 we have five billion forty two million six hundred eleven
[3:27:27.320 --> 3:27:35.000]  thousand six hundred and thirty eight people who have taken the poison already so over half the
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:40.440]  planet has taken poison we're witnessing the greatest mass poisoning in human history
[3:27:40.440 --> 3:27:45.080]  and it means the people who haven't taken the poison you're now a new minority you're the
[3:27:45.080 --> 3:27:51.560]  unvaccinated uh some people call them the pure blood some people say i'm organic i'm organic i
[3:27:51.560 --> 3:27:56.200]  i'm not a genetically modified modified organism i'm not a mutant like the people who took the
[3:27:56.200 --> 3:28:05.720]  poison um some other news daniel horowitz some disturbing news uh he reports more vaccine deaths
[3:28:05.720 --> 3:28:12.360]  in the military than covid deaths the cure is worse than the disease we have to ban the poison
[3:28:12.360 --> 3:28:18.360]  how how much evidence does it take how many hundreds of thousands or millions of people
[3:28:18.360 --> 3:28:26.440]  have to die before we can get poisoned man this is just a great mystery question we need the answer to
[3:28:26.440 --> 3:28:32.360]  another chart here from the uk i can just go on and on and on about this all day long uh covid
[3:28:32.360 --> 3:28:36.760]  deaths it is dose dependent the more doses of the poison you take the worst you're going to do
[3:28:37.640 --> 3:28:41.800]  68 percent of deaths were people who had three doses 18 percent of deaths where people had two
[3:28:41.800 --> 3:28:46.280]  doses and only two percent of deaths had one and then the unvaccinated so 90 percent of deaths in
[3:28:46.280 --> 3:28:51.720]  the uk or in the vaccinated is the point of that all more proof that it's poison
[3:28:56.360 --> 3:29:01.400]  the eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans they financed major
[3:29:01.400 --> 3:29:07.160]  universities they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda of
[3:29:07.160 --> 3:29:13.000]  new york times other major newspapers that the family as we know it is a bad thing it must be
[3:29:13.000 --> 3:29:18.920]  ended and the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that
[3:29:18.920 --> 3:29:23.720]  cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing and i was
[3:29:23.720 --> 3:29:28.440]  just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter my four national daughter my wife makes
[3:29:28.440 --> 3:29:32.840]  dinner a lot of times but i like to make it as well i love to make breakfast and literally it's
[3:29:32.840 --> 3:29:38.520]  the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nutritious and then all sit down
[3:29:38.520 --> 3:29:44.280]  together and have the communal event and that's what the system is attacking and bombarding
[3:29:44.280 --> 3:29:50.280]  is our normal biological actions are coming together they really are sick evil scientific
[3:29:50.280 --> 3:29:55.480]  cult of filth and domesticate us and turn us into lab rats we cannot let this continue
[3:29:56.440 --> 3:30:01.880]  ladies and gentlemen i need your help i need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong
[3:30:01.880 --> 3:30:07.480]  i need your help making sure that our mission continues on i was born for this you were born
[3:30:07.480 --> 3:30:13.000]  for this and people are really waking up right now but we had to build our own infrastructure
[3:30:13.000 --> 3:30:17.960]  because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars and now
[3:30:17.960 --> 3:30:23.160]  with bandot video getting close to 10 million views a day we're a platform for thousands
[3:30:23.160 --> 3:30:29.640]  of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge and because
[3:30:29.640 --> 3:30:36.680]  it becomes so successful it's a catch 22 info wars and bandot video have become a mother ship
[3:30:36.680 --> 3:30:42.680]  promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions
[3:30:42.680 --> 3:30:47.320]  of dollars a quarter hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month so the biggest
[3:30:47.320 --> 3:30:52.760]  sale in info wars history is going right now the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75 off getting
[3:30:52.760 --> 3:30:58.200]  credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever the first ten amendments to our country's
[3:30:58.200 --> 3:31:05.000]  constitution were adopted in 1791 the first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech
[3:31:05.000 --> 3:31:11.880]  and free press free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship
[3:31:11.880 --> 3:31:19.240]  interference and restraint by the government 231 years later free speech across america is under
[3:31:19.240 --> 3:31:26.520]  chronic and insidious attack gcn is under attack your freedom is currently under siege from those
[3:31:26.520 --> 3:31:33.000]  who do not want you to know the truth i'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up and

[3:32:57.640 --> 3:33:03.640]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:33:03.640 --> 3:33:23.640]  all right welcome back to the show that i'm ben marvel today i'm guest host in the show i'm going to say you know fear has no place here in the land of the free and the home of the brave do not live in fear
[3:33:23.640 --> 3:33:41.640]  that's what the evil doers at the world economic forum want they want you to live in fear and hide in a hole and hide in your house and lock down and wear your mask and all that don't live in fear i really would recommend that instead turn to god and pray because that really helps with the fear
[3:33:41.640 --> 3:33:57.640]  anyway i want to go back to the subject of the poison the kovat night the fake kovat 19 fake vaccines they're not vaccines you know some people say free speech is dead so i intend to exercise my free speech today
[3:33:57.640 --> 3:34:11.640]  silence is complicity everybody's heard that phrase over and over cowardly doctors who will not admit poison is poison you're complicit with mass murder you need to speak out i know you're afraid you're going to get sued because you've been recommended
[3:34:11.640 --> 3:34:27.640]  for your patients but grow a pair of balls and speak up because what's going to happen everybody's going to die and then you're going to feel bad and have a lot of regret about it and we're going to see the suicide rate of physicians of all these falsely doctors is going to go through the roof soon because they know what's going on
[3:34:27.640 --> 3:34:41.640]  for example here at morris sussex family practice in new jersey student athletes sports physicals are done primarily to make sure you are not at high risk for sudden cardiac death on the playing field
[3:34:41.640 --> 3:34:51.640]  covid vaccines affect your wrist yeah boy do they ever they kill you they cause myocarditis myocarditis is never normal in children ever
[3:34:51.640 --> 3:34:59.640]  in response to worldwide experience in vaccine adverse event monitoring we're adopting a more precautionary sports physical sign off policy
[3:34:59.640 --> 3:35:09.640]  if you receive doses of any covid vaccine we will not be able to clear you to compete in sports without performing lab work and possibly an echocardiogram to rule out potential heart damage
[3:35:09.640 --> 3:35:22.640]  actually you probably should order back at the mori of the heart is is better at finding heart damage from from the code vaccines but it's interesting that's probably what happened to raffle not the doll the tennis player had to have
[3:35:22.640 --> 3:35:30.640]  in chest pain and shortness of breath and stuff and he was playing the other day of course he took the poison so no surprise he's going to have bad outcome for that
[3:35:30.640 --> 3:35:43.640]  what are we seeing here 80% increase in all calls mortality in the age group 25 to 44 happens to just coincide with when the poison started being given to everybody
[3:35:43.640 --> 3:35:55.640]  so the evidence is just overwhelming poison is poison no human should take poison pregnant women shouldn't take poison old people shouldn't take poison kids shouldn't take poison nobody should take poison
[3:35:55.640 --> 3:36:00.640]  because the more shots of poison you take the sooner you die
[3:36:00.640 --> 3:36:15.640]  here's a little fyi some people don't know the hacks super shedders are the real super spreaders because when you take the poison it makes your body produce the spike protein all over and you shed it everywhere you go
[3:36:15.640 --> 3:36:29.640]  and we've had cases of pregnant women hanging out with people who were recently vaccinated and low and behold they had miscarriages and the only risk factor was that they hung out with somebody who was vaccinated
[3:36:29.640 --> 3:36:37.640]  another fyi just in case you didn't know gain a function research is also called biological weapon development
[3:36:37.640 --> 3:36:48.640]  this is proof that Dr. Death Fauci is a mass murderer and he needs to be arrested and held accountable as soon as possible in Nuremberg 2.0 I'm going to keep saying that until it happens
[3:36:48.640 --> 3:37:01.640]  you know so I would also like to remind everybody what I do I'm a doctor we deliver free doctor visits to America at myfreedoctor.com
[3:37:01.640 --> 3:37:13.640]  of course the main thing we treat is COVID related we treat patients with acute COVID we treat people who've been exposed to COVID we treat people if they're worried they might get COVID
[3:37:13.640 --> 3:37:22.640]  and if they want meds on hand just in case they do get COVID that's actually the best route we treat patients with long COVID as well as people with vaccine injuries
[3:37:22.640 --> 3:37:33.640]  but now we have enough doctors on board we can actually we've been able to start treating non-COVID related problems like say you have a rash or urinary tract infection or
[3:37:33.640 --> 3:37:46.640]  yeast infection, athlete's foot, headache, ear infection, strep throat, things like that anything that's appropriate for telemedicine we can also treat now at myfreedoctor.com
[3:37:46.640 --> 3:37:57.640]  all of our we all of our doctors we deliver medical advice and prescriptions for free you do when you get to the pharmacy you do have to pay for the medicine we can't pay for it for you but
[3:37:57.640 --> 3:38:06.640]  I wish we could it would be great if we could do that but just some people think oh that means the medicines are going to be free well we send the prescriptions for free we give you advice for free
[3:38:06.640 --> 3:38:16.640]  most of the medications we prescribe are generic and should be relatively low cost although there have been shenanigans going on with ivermectin with price gouging on that
[3:38:16.640 --> 3:38:29.640]  so we do provide the prescriptions and the medical advice for free and at the very end we ask for a donation and if people can donate great it's basically a pay it forward system
[3:38:29.640 --> 3:38:40.640]  as many people as we can we're basically trying to build a parallel system this has nothing to do with the corrupt fake Fauci system that tries to give everybody poison and refuses early treatment to the patients
[3:38:40.640 --> 3:38:53.640]  so that's what we're doing and we're building this concept adding more doctors to the team if you're a doctor if you're a doctor that's interested in working with us please send me your email
[3:38:53.640 --> 3:39:02.640]  your CV in your national practitioner data bank report email it to benmarblemd at myfreedoctor.com and we'll see if we can get you added to the prescribers team
[3:39:02.640 --> 3:39:12.640]  because that's how we go from treating around a thousand patients we're doing around a thousand patients a day now ideally I think we should be doing a hundred thousand patients a day
[3:39:12.640 --> 3:39:21.640]  and the way we do that is by adding more doctors and more patient support staff our patient support staff generally we hire people that are tech savvy
[3:39:21.640 --> 3:39:31.640]  that are good with have good communication skills and good computer skills and if you're not in favor of giving people poison and you're in favor of giving early treatment
[3:39:31.640 --> 3:39:42.640]  and you want to see about a patient support staff job then send an email to admin at myfreedoctor.com and we can see if we can get you added to the team
[3:39:42.640 --> 3:39:54.640]  so that's sort of what we do and how we grow this is by adding more employees so I would encourage everybody to go to myfreedoctor.com and we'll do our best we can't help you
[3:39:54.640 --> 3:40:03.640]  if it's something that we can't handle or treat then we can give you advice and refer you to the appropriate you know if you need a heart transplant we can't do that via telemedicine
[3:40:03.640 --> 3:40:13.640]  but we can give you referral to the doctors that we actually trust and get you headed in the right direction that you need to be headed to get whatever it is
[3:40:13.640 --> 3:40:22.640]  whatever health problem you have to get it taken care of in a reasonable time frame so that's the big problem because there's this great lack of trust now in healthcare
[3:40:22.640 --> 3:40:34.640]  Dr. Dath Fauci has destroyed American healthcare single-handedly he has destroyed everything the general public does not trust the CDC or the FDA or the NIH because they shouldn't
[3:40:34.640 --> 3:40:46.640]  they're all a bunch of liars they're lying about everything this is a big pandemic scandemic whatever you want to call it great reset it's an orchestrated conspiracy to destroy America
[3:40:46.640 --> 3:41:00.640]  bring in usher in their one world government their global tracking system of all humans now if that doesn't sound like the Bible in times prophecy I don't know what does because it's pretty scary and that is what they're doing
[3:41:00.640 --> 3:41:11.640]  they've announced their Vax pass in Ukraine just recently I mean Ukraine's in the middle of a war and they're worried about vaccine passes how crazy is that that's just proof of the level of insanity these people
[3:41:11.640 --> 3:41:21.640]  they're all insane if you think political correctness is good you're insane basically political correctness is evil political correctness is just like Nazism basically
[3:41:21.640 --> 3:41:30.640]  so you know after World War two 1946 it was illegal to be a Nazi so what we need is some politicians to step up we need to ban political correctness in America
[3:41:30.640 --> 3:41:41.640]  it has no place it's the exact opposite of free speech it's it's exact it's against the first amendment free speech is the first amendment political correctness is don't say that because you might hurt somebody's feelings
[3:41:41.640 --> 3:41:56.640]  well what we found out you know PC just seem to be good manners 20 years ago that's what everybody thought well now we all know political correctness literally can get you killed and is actively killing people and that their plan is to actually kill as many people as they can
[3:41:56.640 --> 3:42:09.640]  so you know we try to have hope and want to you know we know we're going to win this war in the end because we are at war it's biological war and of course there's the the bombs in Ukraine and all that
[3:42:09.640 --> 3:42:19.640]  which is the literal war but we will win in the end we have to win in the end we have no option losing is not an option because if we lose that just means we all want to dead
[3:42:19.640 --> 3:42:35.640]  so we have to fight back against part of fighting back is knowing who you're fighting against so what the whole trade has been about has been about distracting us and convincing us that you know Russia's the enemy or Putin's enemy
[3:42:35.640 --> 3:42:48.640]  when in reality World Economic Forum and all their puppets are the enemy included which one of the puppets is Zelensky he's a World Economic Forum puppet and many others in the World Economic Forum
[3:42:48.640 --> 3:42:54.640]  so I would encourage Vladimir Putin specifically if he wants to actually be on
[3:43:19.640 --> 3:43:35.640]  in the face of the globalist making their main move in full wars it's paradoxical is more popular than ever it was reaching more people than ever despite the censorship but because of cost increasing having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own band with everything else we are running out of money
[3:43:35.640 --> 3:44:04.640]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart deep in my soul I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet I've had a lot of loss
[3:44:04.640 --> 3:44:23.640]  like everybody else has and it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for and now we're just throwing it all away
[3:44:23.640 --> 3:44:47.640]  and I see the general public in a medically induced scientifically induced behavioral psychologically controlled 20 and I know we're being fed into this globalist beacons and it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life again
[3:44:47.640 --> 3:44:55.640]  it's just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it
[3:44:55.640 --> 3:45:17.640]  Ladies and gentlemen I need your help I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong I need your help making sure that our mission continues on I was born for this you were born for this and people are really waking up right now but we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars and now with band
[3:45:17.640 --> 3:45:32.640]  video getting close to 10 million views a day we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge and because it's become so successful it's a catch 22
[3:45:32.640 --> 3:45:54.640]  info wars and band video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month so the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off getting incredible products and keep info wars as strong as ever
[3:45:54.640 --> 3:46:16.640]  it has been noted by many a historian the first casualty of war is the truth then the next big casualty isn't even the people that die no that invariably follows but first there is the crackdown on populations basic liberty and speech and massive censorship
[3:46:16.640 --> 3:46:45.640]  and now across the world from the united states to europe legislation is being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro-russian information you can be censored you can be arrested you can be a prisoner and of course now Canada is in a dislegislation that if you have a fought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online that you will be censored and arrested
[3:46:45.640 --> 3:46:57.640]  ladies and gentlemen the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes info wars dot com more important than ever
[3:46:57.640 --> 3:47:10.640]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:47:10.640 --> 3:47:16.640]  welcome back to the show i'm dr ben marvel guest host today
[3:47:16.640 --> 3:47:28.640]  i happen to live in florida i live in a city called santa rosa beach florida i love florida it's a great state freedom there is not like most other states we have a great governor
[3:47:28.640 --> 3:47:46.640]  ron de santa probably the best governor in america i would say but i would like to appeal to governor de santa i have an idea what was my idea i actually read substack i was reading some info on steve kersh's substack today and i thought you know this is a good idea so i figured i would repeat it
[3:47:46.640 --> 3:48:01.640]  why can't we have autopsies in everybody who dies within two months of covid vaccine vaccination or within two months of taking the fake covid vaccine the reason thus far you know dr death out she said we don't want autopsies
[3:48:01.640 --> 3:48:22.640]  and that's why we want them because autopsies are how we prove you know we've already had many autopsies around the world that have clearly proven that the fake covid 19 vaccines are poisoned but florida governor ron de santa he could make an executive order as the governor to order autopsies on anybody who dies within two months after receiving these fake vaccines
[3:48:22.640 --> 3:48:44.640]  and that would probably pretty quickly put an end to this insanity of giving people poison in mass so please governor de santa consider this idea what's it going to harm doing autopsies on dead people how's that going to harm anything they're already dead so why can't we do a little digging and investigate and find out what killed them
[3:48:44.640 --> 3:48:55.640]  wink wink it's the fake vaccine poison is the answer that we know that's what's causing it and of course you know we have all these mandates all around the country i was asked to mention this
[3:48:55.640 --> 3:49:13.640]  if you're trying to get if you have a college student that's trying to get out of college mandates go to nocollegemandates.com nocollegemandates.com that's a good website that's working to help students get out of having to get the vaccine so that they can attend college
[3:49:13.640 --> 3:49:30.640]  certainly that is something we do i don't really advertise it a whole lot but we do do exemptions now i will say anything we deliver advice and prescriptions for free but the one thing we don't do is if it requires paperwork we do charge a fee so for like exemptions
[3:49:30.640 --> 3:49:43.640]  any kind of return to work paperwork stuff like that we generally will charge a fee for that because it it you know we have to pay pay to do it so we have to pass that cost on but we do do the prescriptions and the advice for free
[3:49:43.640 --> 3:49:55.640]  so i wanted just people to be aware that we do offer a mask and vaccine exemptions for people who need those i thought i would also talk a little bit about some of the
[3:49:55.640 --> 3:50:02.640]  outpatient early treatment protocols you know that we're going to pass 200,000 free doctor visits later this month
[3:50:02.640 --> 3:50:12.640]  that we've delivered all 50 states in america we we primarily prescribed the McCulloch protocol which is a combination of
[3:50:12.640 --> 3:50:19.640]  you know Dr. Peter McCulloch was the one who spearheaded this early on so i wanted to give him credit where it was due and
[3:50:19.640 --> 3:50:26.640]  make sure we named the protocol after him but a lot of doctors were involved in putting this protocol together we it was first published in late
[3:50:26.640 --> 3:50:37.640]  2020 the early treatment protocol of course it includes ivermectin the media has vilified that is horse medicine well they're a bunch of liars ivermectin is
[3:50:37.640 --> 3:50:48.640]  has won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 2015 is being one of the top 10 most important medicines ever invented we know it's safe it's been around for many many decades
[3:50:48.640 --> 3:51:00.640]  it's very safe and it's actually effective unlike the fake vaccines another medicine we use hydroxychloroquine also vilified president trump had mentioned
[3:51:00.640 --> 3:51:11.640]  hydroxychloroquine back in early 2020 of course the media and Dr. Death Fauci and the covid cult they had to destroy that narrative and why because big
[3:51:11.640 --> 3:51:20.640]  pharma they're on big pharma's back pocket Dr. Death Fauci is big pharma's best sells person that all the medical alphabet organizations AMA,
[3:51:20.640 --> 3:51:30.640]  FDA, CDC they're all in the back pocket of big pharma and the billionaires and they do not look out for the best interests of the people so they had to
[3:51:30.640 --> 3:51:43.640]  vilify these good safe drugs hydroxychloroquine for example has been around for 60 something years it's so safe pregnant women can take it so basically these two drugs ivermectin hydroxychloroquine are
[3:51:43.640 --> 3:51:52.640]  literally safer than Tylenol so for them to vilify them and claim they cause all these bad health problems just a great big lie and people who don't understand medicine don't know that
[3:51:52.640 --> 3:52:04.640]  but these drugs are excellent drugs they're generic they've been around for a long time and they do help the other drugs we use of course prednisone it's a
[3:52:04.640 --> 3:52:16.640]  steroid you know when you think of how you treat covid there's basically three problems with a covid-19 infection and this is where some people will claim that they've never isolated the virus covid-19 doesn't really exist
[3:52:16.640 --> 3:52:27.640]  well you're just wrong that's not true covid-19 is real but it's man-made it was man-made by Dr. Death Fauci and the crew at the Wuhan lab they put it together it's a real
[3:52:27.640 --> 3:52:41.640]  virus that exists it has been isolated so stop with the nonsense it does exist but we've used these drugs to help treat it so prednisone back to what I was saying you treat viral load you
[3:52:41.640 --> 3:52:52.640]  want to give medicines to help reduce viral load too you want covid causes inflammation so you want to use anti-inflammatories and then the probably the biggest problem is covid causes clots it causes clotting
[3:52:52.640 --> 3:53:04.640]  all throughout your body micro clotting and so we use anti clotting drugs for that so one of the other drugs probably you know I already mentioned ivermectin hydroxychloroquine we use prednisone
[3:53:04.640 --> 3:53:15.640]  prednisone's a safe oral steroid low cost been around forever everybody knows it's a decent drug it helps with the inflammation it's an anti-inflammatories
[3:53:15.640 --> 3:53:25.640]  teres or anti-inflammatories we also use inhaled buidesonide now this is where I would put out an appeal to the pharmaceutical industry of course they think they couldn't make money off of this
[3:53:25.640 --> 3:53:40.640]  there is no meter dose inhaler for buidesonide when we prescribe it we have to prescribe the nebulizer version only if somebody like maybe mark cuban and his new pharmaceutical company costs rx drugs i can't recall the name of it
[3:53:40.640 --> 3:53:53.640]  but miss mark cuban's new drug company they're trying to get cost down if they could force one of the manufacturers to make a meter dose inhaler of buidesonide you could probably make it for 10-20 bucks or sell it for that
[3:53:53.640 --> 3:54:08.640]  we would prescribe them all day long but instead since it's not available because big pharma thought oh we can't make enough money off that because it's generic they quit making it so what they do is you have to get it via the nebulizer which is a lot more expensive for the patient
[3:54:08.640 --> 3:54:28.640]  we want to minimize our cost for our patients other drugs we use phenofibrate as shown to help as well as flu voxamine also helps and another drug deutasteride montelocast is another one and these all help now those are the prescription drugs
[3:54:28.640 --> 3:54:47.640]  these are the counter drugs that have shown to be of some benefit of course vitamin c vitamin d zinc is probably the most important of those over the counters some people recommend of course quercetin or ECG is another one
[3:54:47.640 --> 3:55:05.640]  there's a lot of different over the counters that help with acute covid there's some that help with spike injury spike protein injury from the from taking the fake vaccine so since I mentioned that we have a video why don't we show go ahead and go to the video of the vaccine injuries
[3:55:05.640 --> 3:55:18.640]  and taking advantage of this what we said very early in the morning that there are almost no people so even though they don't have a turn they are going to be able to be attended quickly
[3:55:18.640 --> 3:55:21.640]  Carlos any of us will come back in a little while
[3:55:21.640 --> 3:55:25.640]  close the door, close the door, close the door, close the door, close the door, close the door
[3:55:25.640 --> 3:55:53.640]  music
[3:55:53.640 --> 3:55:59.640]  the military police was called in the rural area of Ribeirão vermelho you know why
[3:55:59.640 --> 3:56:24.640]  I don't mean to brag I don't care but I want you to know double that booster flu shot and I'm gonna be honest I have the shingle shot to never got covid clearly Jesus loves me the most seriously so nice so nice
[3:56:24.640 --> 3:56:53.640]  I don't care if you're Donald Trump I don't care if you're Bill Gates I don't care who you are you come at children with experimental Nuremberg code violating vaccines that you broke the law to Ram through you are terrorist in
[3:56:53.640 --> 3:57:01.640]  league with Joseph Mengele 2.0
[3:57:01.640 --> 3:57:05.640]  we have a player down on the court will try to get more information
[3:57:05.640 --> 3:57:10.640]  Johnson taken out on a stretcher and rushed to local Tallahassee Memorial Hospital
[3:57:10.640 --> 3:57:16.640]  leading cardiologist says cluster of collapses and footballers likely to be just a coincidence all right
[3:57:16.640 --> 3:57:27.640]  well the non fake Fauci science is settled so I think greenest people covid vaccines are poison
[3:57:27.640 --> 3:57:46.640]  stop taking poison we need to ban the poison I will not rest until the poison is banned we have to ban the poison ban the poison ban the poison everybody needs to stand up and demand that we ban the poison as soon as possible
[3:57:46.640 --> 3:58:03.640]  if I had to describe with just one word the brainwashing the mind control the asleep France but the general public is in the best word would actually be the people are lost
[3:58:03.640 --> 3:58:20.640]  just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in a car or you get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused you have a concussion and that's what the globalists have done they have stunned us
[3:58:20.640 --> 3:58:38.640]  they have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings and then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave him speech he called the great new narrative where he brags how the public is lost how the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff
[3:58:38.640 --> 3:58:58.640]  that's what the great reason is they need darkness to thrive the light lives at nfo wars dot com I am a worldly person meaning I like going to ball games I like going to concerts I like going to play golf I like going out to dinner I like the metropolitan life I like everything that comes with this
[3:58:58.640 --> 3:59:10.640]  but see I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of democrat run cities get the hell out of major metropolitan areas because unless we change course soon it's all crashing down
[3:59:10.640 --> 3:59:19.640]  is it time to just move out to the woods just trying to go get a piece of property in the woods just get off grid just get the emergency food supplies just live off the land that's the survival instinct
[3:59:19.640 --> 3:59:30.640]  but see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says no no no no stay in the city the survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere there ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask
[3:59:30.640 --> 3:59:43.640]  that's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well but you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies and so we have the best ones at nfowarstore.com
