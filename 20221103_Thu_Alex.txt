[00:00.000 --> 00:25.900]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:25.900 --> 00:32.040]  This lady, Vija Gade, I'm saying that right there, quote, Chief Counsel, she tells Super
[00:32.040 --> 00:36.080]  Whopper allies that I got kicked off for beating up a kid.
[00:36.080 --> 00:38.160]  So what was it that made you ban him?
[00:38.160 --> 00:42.800]  So there were three separate incidents that came to our attention after the fact that
[00:42.800 --> 00:46.000]  were reported to us by different users.
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.720]  There was a video that was uploaded that showed a child being violently thrown to the ground
[00:50.720 --> 00:51.720]  and crying.
[00:51.720 --> 00:52.720]  So that was the first one.
[00:52.720 --> 00:56.300]  And the question is, what was the video context of the kid being thrown to the ground?
[00:56.300 --> 00:57.300]  Was it newsworthy?
[00:57.300 --> 01:01.040]  We obviously didn't think so, and depicting violence against a child is not something
[01:01.040 --> 01:02.880]  that we would allow on the platform.
[01:02.880 --> 01:04.520]  Even if it's news content?
[01:04.520 --> 01:10.760]  If it was, there are certain types of situations where if you were reporting on war zone and
[01:10.760 --> 01:14.200]  things that might be happening, we would put an interstitial on that type of content that's
[01:14.200 --> 01:18.000]  graphic or violent, but we didn't feel that that was the context here.
[01:18.000 --> 01:21.720]  So there's a video that's been going around that was going around a few, four or five
[01:21.720 --> 01:25.720]  weeks ago, the one where the girls were yelling at that big giant guy, and the guy punched
[01:25.720 --> 01:28.080]  that girl in the face, and she was like 11 years old.
[01:28.080 --> 01:30.400]  I saw that multiple times on Twitter.
[01:30.400 --> 01:35.040]  That was one of the most violent things I've ever seen, this giant man punched this 11-year-old
[01:35.040 --> 01:37.120]  girl in the face.
[01:37.120 --> 01:39.240]  And that was, was that removed from Twitter?
[01:39.240 --> 01:40.240]  I don't know.
[01:40.240 --> 01:43.880]  Also, that I'm doing all these other horrible things, that I was mean to Oliver Darcy, even
[01:43.880 --> 01:46.160]  though he's a public figure and it's in public.
[01:46.160 --> 01:51.800]  So the third strike that we looked at was a verbal altercation that Alex got into with
[01:51.800 --> 01:52.800]  a journalist.
[01:52.800 --> 01:57.680]  And in that altercation, which was uploaded to Twitter, there were a number of statements
[01:57.680 --> 02:01.040]  using eyes of the rat, even more evil-looking person.
[02:01.040 --> 02:02.040]  He's just scum.
[02:02.040 --> 02:06.280]  You're a virus to America and freedom, smelling like a possum that climbed out of the rear
[02:06.280 --> 02:08.080]  and of a dead cow.
[02:08.080 --> 02:11.880]  You look like a possum that got caught doing some really, really nasty stuff, in my view.
[02:11.880 --> 02:13.880]  So it was a bunch of...
[02:13.880 --> 02:14.880]  That's enough?
[02:14.880 --> 02:15.880]  Really?
[02:15.880 --> 02:16.880]  It was a pattern in practice.
[02:16.880 --> 02:17.880]  I understand.
[02:17.880 --> 02:20.720]  But it was a verbal altercation that was posted on our platform.
[02:20.720 --> 02:25.440]  So we took the totality of this, having been warned that we have rules against the abuse
[02:25.440 --> 02:27.320]  and harassment of individuals.
[02:27.320 --> 02:32.120]  We saw this pattern in practice, one strike, two strikes, three strikes, and we made a decision.
[02:32.120 --> 02:36.920]  Here are the Twitter executives being fired.
[02:36.920 --> 02:38.960]  They don't look too happy now.
[02:38.960 --> 02:43.560]  Among the three top executives who were reportedly fired is Vijaya Gatti, who oversaw Twitter's
[02:43.560 --> 02:45.840]  policy on misinformation.
[02:45.840 --> 02:48.360]  Musk has been outspoken against censorship.
[02:48.360 --> 02:54.160]  A lot of people are saying, Jones, when are you going to challenge Elon Musk and demand
[02:54.160 --> 02:55.640]  that you be reinstated to Twitter?
[02:55.640 --> 02:57.760]  The wheels are coming off the new world order.
[02:57.760 --> 03:01.040]  I don't know if Elon Musk is the guy we want to piss off.
[03:01.040 --> 03:02.480]  Are you scared of Elon Musk or...?
[03:02.480 --> 03:03.800]  I'm not scared of him, no.
[03:03.800 --> 03:05.200]  You sound like you're scared of him.
[03:05.200 --> 03:06.200]  I'm not scared of him.
[03:06.200 --> 03:07.200]  I like him.
[03:07.200 --> 03:09.160]  But the thing is, this is not a technological problem.
[03:09.160 --> 03:12.800]  I mean, if you have a technological problem, yes, you need the tech genius.
[03:12.800 --> 03:18.840]  No, I'm talking about taking over Twitter, for instance, that this is a problem of politics,
[03:18.840 --> 03:21.560]  of sociology, of human psychology.
[03:21.560 --> 03:25.080]  I'm not sure that he's necessarily the best one to address it.
[03:25.080 --> 03:29.000]  I mean, his view of Twitter, he often says that it's like the town square, that we need
[03:29.000 --> 03:30.920]  to protect the free speech there.
[03:30.920 --> 03:32.880]  But Twitter is not the town square.
[03:32.880 --> 03:39.640]  I mean, Tristan Harris recently said that Twitter is actually the town's gladiator arena.
[03:39.640 --> 03:48.000]  The world population is waking up at record levels, and the globalists are completely
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.600]  and totally, absolutely desperate right now.
[03:51.600 --> 03:55.600]  But despite the robust protections of the First Amendment, the federal government is
[03:55.600 --> 04:00.360]  making every effort to pressure social media companies into punishing speech.
[04:00.360 --> 04:04.320]  Now, according to the Intercept, Facebook maintains a special portal for law enforcement
[04:04.320 --> 04:07.760]  to make requests that content be removed from the platform.
[04:07.760 --> 04:09.960]  Indeed, the portal exists here.
[04:09.960 --> 04:14.560]  We were able to find it, and requires law enforcement credentials to access it.
[04:14.560 --> 04:18.640]  According to the Intercept, the FBI's Laura Demlo breached a cybersecurity agency on the
[04:18.640 --> 04:24.320]  spread of misinformation, warning that, quote, we need a media infrastructure that is held
[04:24.320 --> 04:25.320]  accountable.
[04:25.320 --> 04:29.920]  Excuse me, another DHS report obtained by the Intercept explained that its coming priorities
[04:29.920 --> 04:34.880]  are preventing, quote, inaccurate information on a wide range of topics, including, quote,
[04:34.880 --> 04:39.960]  the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, racial justice,
[04:39.960 --> 04:44.760]  U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the nature of U.S. support to Ukraine.
[04:44.760 --> 04:49.840]  God gave us all this technology to use and to build our future, but it serves us, not
[04:49.840 --> 04:50.840]  them.
[04:50.840 --> 05:01.440]  That's a prime rule in my rules, or I think the future should be run.
[05:01.440 --> 05:06.680]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[05:06.680 --> 05:08.080]  you.
[05:08.080 --> 05:11.760]  And the globalist's number one mission is to silence info wars, because they rightly
[05:11.760 --> 05:17.080]  see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[05:17.080 --> 05:21.320]  the world, for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[05:21.320 --> 05:27.360]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links from infowars.com

[05:43.800 --> 05:47.800]  I am in your hands, and I'm asking of your support now, who have my commitment to never
[05:47.800 --> 05:51.160]  give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.

[06:24.600 --> 06:29.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you thought that speech five weeks ago was Biden with a red
[06:29.680 --> 06:34.120]  background on the Marines, deterring war on their political opposition, saying we want
[06:34.120 --> 06:38.320]  to arrest all of us as bad, last night was even worse.
[06:38.320 --> 06:49.720]  His Hail Mary to say, hey, I'm the most properly elected person ever, my election was the cleanest
[06:49.720 --> 06:56.280]  election that we've basically ever seen, but oh, in these key battleground states, the
[06:56.280 --> 07:00.280]  same ones they stole last time, we're not going to know for a few days who really won,
[07:00.280 --> 07:03.040]  and we'll explain how that scam works.
[07:03.040 --> 07:07.840]  I mean, it went on and on, and that, you know, Democrats don't handle things by violence
[07:07.840 --> 07:12.480]  or burning things down, that's the Republicans.
[07:12.480 --> 07:15.680]  Everything he said was upside down world.
[07:15.680 --> 07:24.680]  And now, the Pelosi's don't want the footage from their surveillance cameras that the Congressional
[07:24.680 --> 07:30.600]  Capitol Police, they've expanded offices around the country, turns out they've got HD video
[07:30.600 --> 07:35.040]  of all this, but they don't want the footage released, ladies and gentlemen, they just don't
[07:35.040 --> 07:40.320]  want to talk about two men in their underwear with hammers in a bedroom, it just gets crazier
[07:40.320 --> 07:41.320]  and crazier.
[07:41.320 --> 07:46.080]  We're going to open the phones up throughout the broadcast today, all three hours, we're
[07:46.080 --> 07:53.840]  going to be taking your phone calls on all these issues, so let's go ahead now and plow
[07:53.840 --> 08:00.400]  directly into the outrageous speech last night, Biden sends a stark warning about political
[08:00.400 --> 08:06.640]  violence ahead of midterms, we can't take democracy for granted any longer.
[08:06.640 --> 08:11.920]  This is the Democratic Party that said that Russians got Trump elected by fraud and had
[08:11.920 --> 08:18.400]  fake impeachments and fake dossiers and we now know the FBI and DHS interfaced with big
[08:18.400 --> 08:22.880]  tech and corporate media censoring stories and censoring the American people and having
[08:22.880 --> 08:28.120]  meetings with major banks about taking bank accounts away from anybody that criticizes
[08:28.120 --> 08:33.280]  the Afghan withdrawal or forced inoculations or open borders by the list grows all the
[08:33.280 --> 08:43.400]  time, don't question transgenderism, spying on us, government illegally working with corporations
[08:43.400 --> 08:47.360]  and think tanks all in their own documents saying we can't let the public know about
[08:47.360 --> 08:52.840]  this, it's illegal, that's why we work through the ADL and the Southern Primary Law Center
[08:52.840 --> 09:00.080]  and Kyrie Irving just paid a $500,000 fee fine to the ADL and announced he will quote
[09:00.080 --> 09:06.200]  be reeducated by the head of the ADL, you know that's what the gun grabbers, Democratic
[09:06.200 --> 09:10.960]  Party groups that sued me in these kangaroo courts told me in mediation, they said we
[09:10.960 --> 09:17.760]  want you to come out against the Second Amendment, we'll drop all this, oh I can be sitting
[09:17.760 --> 09:25.760]  in your lap and then you'll be nice to me, you oily, gross lawyers, I am happier and
[09:25.760 --> 09:34.600]  more alive than I've ever been being under savage attack by the scum of the earth, you
[09:34.600 --> 09:42.760]  can put a gun to my head you filth and I wouldn't back down one inch and I'll never back down
[09:42.760 --> 09:48.960]  as long as God keeps me alive and God works through our listeners to support us ladies
[09:48.960 --> 09:54.480]  and gentlemen, all Kyrie Irving did was put a link up talking about how a bunch of Africans
[09:54.480 --> 10:00.720]  in North Africa are related to Jews, that's in the Old Testament, Ethiopia was founded
[10:00.720 --> 10:09.360]  by black Jews and then it talks about how many of the Jews that lived in Portugal and
[10:09.360 --> 10:20.440]  Spain, not Ashkenazi but Sephardic, actual Jews, brown skinned Jews, friends that are
[10:20.440 --> 10:30.600]  Sephardic Jews, great people, Rousseau was a Sephardic Jew but the whole point is that
[10:30.600 --> 10:38.560]  it's on record that many of the slave ships were indeed owned by rich European Jews, they
[10:38.560 --> 10:44.760]  were owned by a lot of the folks too but it's just ridiculous, look own the fact that most
[10:44.760 --> 10:49.520]  white people that are European had some ancestor that had slaves, I'm sure I had some ancestor
[10:49.520 --> 10:55.160]  back 300, 400 years ago that probably worked on a slave ship, I mean they had the press
[10:55.160 --> 11:01.960]  gangs in England and France where they would go to country boys' houses, teenagers' houses,
[11:01.960 --> 11:06.240]  in the country and literally conk you on the head, put a bag over your head so you didn't
[11:06.240 --> 11:10.360]  know where you went to get home because most of the farm boys never left their house or
[11:10.360 --> 11:16.640]  their farm and then take you to the coast 500, 300 miles away and load you on an impressment
[11:16.640 --> 11:22.480]  ship, I'll guarantee you I bet I had ancestors that were pressed on the British ships that
[11:22.480 --> 11:27.800]  were loading up black slaves, I don't know that but I bet money and if somebody wrote
[11:27.800 --> 11:34.800]  a book about England or Spain or Portugal, because Spain and Portugal were the real
[11:34.800 --> 11:40.600]  slaving countries that were the first to do it on the European angle on the Gold Coast
[11:40.600 --> 11:44.440]  of Africa, they weren't the first to have slaves, the Arabs kind of started the black
[11:44.440 --> 11:48.480]  slave market but the point is the whites sure got involved, I mean if somebody said hey
[11:48.480 --> 11:54.000]  we traced back your lineage 20 generations back and you had a great great great great
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.800]  great great great great great grandfather that was a captain of a slave ship, I wouldn't
[11:58.800 --> 12:06.000]  go I'm banning you, I want you to pay me $500,000, you're going to be taken off the air, you
[12:06.000 --> 12:14.440]  are a criminal and you hate all Jews, what? The vice president of the Confederacy was
[12:14.440 --> 12:24.360]  Jewish in the civil war, does that mean all Jews supported slavery then or today? No,
[12:24.360 --> 12:34.120]  but the bar for criticizing anything that the left is doing is just over the top and
[12:34.120 --> 12:41.240]  I didn't mean to go off on a jag about that, it's just anybody that studies history knows
[12:41.240 --> 12:53.360]  that Jewish publications brag how they basically ran the Confederacy, I mean it's a fact that
[12:53.360 --> 12:58.040]  though one of the largest contingents in the southern government of Jefferson Davis was
[12:58.040 --> 13:04.200]  Jewish, I mean that's in the Washington Post, does that mean Jews are bad? No it doesn't,
[13:04.200 --> 13:10.720]  Budzy Siegel was a Jewish gangster that killed people, does that mean Jews are bad? No, I
[13:10.720 --> 13:15.200]  mean you got the Gambino crime family out, killing people, does that mean Italians are
[13:15.200 --> 13:21.600]  all gangster murderers? It's an insane benchmark but it's the same thing, you support freedom,
[13:21.600 --> 13:24.520]  you're a terrorist and the ADL you question an election they're going to say you're a
[13:24.520 --> 13:28.520]  Nazi and then now the government's going to come after you and the government's spying
[13:28.520 --> 13:35.360]  on you and it's ridiculous, it's absolutely preposterous and I'm going to go to break here
[13:35.360 --> 13:42.360]  about three minutes and oh my gosh Wikipedia better gets shut down if Kyrie Irving had
[13:42.360 --> 13:51.520]  to pay $500,000 the ADL for putting the link out a documentary of black folks documenting
[13:51.520 --> 13:59.440]  Jews involved in the slave trade, well then put it up there, I want Wikipedia taken down,
[13:59.440 --> 14:06.080]  the Jewish Confederates, what is Wikipedia doing promoting a bestselling book about the
[14:06.080 --> 14:15.560]  Jewish Confederates? See this is this is idiocy ladies and gentlemen, this is absolute total
[14:15.560 --> 14:25.200]  and complete moronic idiocy. If Kyrie Irving put out an Instagram talking about Britain
[14:25.200 --> 14:31.120]  and the slave trade and I've got British ancestors, do I get mad at Kyrie Irving? No, it's history
[14:31.120 --> 14:36.120]  I'm interested in that, it's important to understand that. I've sat up here and talked
[14:36.120 --> 14:39.520]  about how blacks were enslaving blacks and selling them the slave trade, does that mean
[14:39.520 --> 14:46.640]  all black people are bad? So it's just absolutely insane ladies and gentlemen and the wheels
[14:46.640 --> 14:51.040]  are coming off, we're going to go to break, the new sale is here and we need the funds
[14:51.040 --> 14:57.600]  to stay on here plus these are great products. Black Friday comes early every year and we

[15:06.720 --> 15:10.560]  had to take a few things off sale like X3 is about to sell out and some other things

[15:15.520 --> 15:21.760]  off with promo code 1776 it's 60 so the sale actually in a way got better except that once

[15:25.560 --> 15:29.040]  we're going to pull a couple things off the sale list right now all the supplements are
[15:29.040 --> 15:37.240]  50% off, additional 10% off with 1776 at checkout and that is Black Friday comes early, oh oh

[16:00.920 --> 16:07.280]  honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy. I am blessed to know that
[16:07.280 --> 16:15.240]  our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[16:15.240 --> 16:19.640]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's came over and

[20:00.600 --> 20:27.400]  Well Joe Biden really showed his hand last night while I'm the most legitimate elected
[20:27.400 --> 20:32.800]  person in US history don't question elections. The Republicans are going to try to steal
[20:32.800 --> 20:38.360]  it don't question elections but they're trying to steal it and in these key battleground
[20:38.360 --> 20:43.680]  states where we stole it last time well it's going to take a few days to decide who the
[20:43.680 --> 20:49.800]  winners are because they rattle all the dead people that they have ballots filled out for
[20:49.800 --> 20:53.920]  folks that moved out of the state they have computer programs that Facebook and others
[20:53.920 --> 20:58.640]  paid $300 million to give them databases of they just sit there and fill them in and have
[20:58.640 --> 21:04.720]  their mules go deliver them right there to the drop boxes ladies and gentlemen that's
[21:04.720 --> 21:09.760]  how they operate so let's go ahead and go to Biden we know that more and more ballots
[21:09.760 --> 21:14.400]  are cast by early voting or by mail in America that means in some cases we don't know the
[21:14.400 --> 21:18.480]  winner of the election for a few days then they go on to list the states which are the
[21:18.480 --> 21:25.640]  key battleground states we know that more and more ballots are cast in early voting
[21:25.640 --> 21:32.440]  or by mail in America we know that many states don't start counting those ballots so after
[21:32.440 --> 21:37.720]  the polls close on November 8th that means in some cases we won't know the winner of
[21:37.720 --> 21:44.480]  the election for a few days until after few days after the election takes time to count
[21:44.480 --> 21:51.440]  all legitimate ballots in a legal and orderly manner it's always been important for citizens
[21:51.440 --> 21:57.000]  in democracy to be informed and engaged now it's important for citizens to be patient
[21:57.000 --> 22:04.920]  as well that's how it's supposed to work so back when we only had paper ballots until
[22:04.920 --> 22:09.160]  the 80s they had the precincts count them up everybody looked and made sure it was accurate
[22:09.160 --> 22:13.640]  and it was pretty hard to steal they'd still have a few people vote repeatedly the democrats
[22:13.640 --> 22:17.880]  are famous for running scams it's their bag it's it's their bailiwick it's it's their
[22:17.880 --> 22:23.560]  wheelhouse it's their arena it's their mo it's their signature it's what they do okay
[22:23.560 --> 22:28.960]  like ducks quack and have feathers well and you know wolves got long hair and like to eat
[22:28.960 --> 22:33.160]  sheep and pedophiles like to rape children democrats like to steal elections they've been
[22:33.160 --> 22:37.480]  doing it forever I think they own the country they launch a civil war it's who they are
[22:37.480 --> 22:45.840]  we're scum and what the leadership of these people so then we have Biden saying that the
[22:45.840 --> 22:54.040]  great irony of 2020 election is just the most attacked election in our history and yet it
[22:54.040 --> 23:00.840]  was no election our history that can be more certain of its results so he's saying his
[23:00.840 --> 23:07.240]  election was absolutely without question but but but again now with all the computers
[23:07.240 --> 23:11.720]  they just can't tell you when somebody won though because they got to bring in the inputs
[23:11.720 --> 23:19.440]  that are the fake ballots here it is party the great irony about the two twenty election
[23:19.440 --> 23:24.960]  is that it's the most attacked election in our history and yet and yet there's no election
[23:24.960 --> 23:31.720]  in our history that we can be more certain of its results every legal challenge that
[23:31.720 --> 23:38.280]  could have been brought was brought no the Senate could add a 10-day investigation the
[23:38.280 --> 23:44.440]  courts would not look at the evidence and that's all on record so let's go ahead now
[23:44.440 --> 23:49.400]  and go to Biden accuses extreme manga Republicans are trying to suppress the right of voters
[23:49.400 --> 23:54.360]  so there's no such thing as election fraud but Republicans are all doing it here it is
[23:54.360 --> 24:02.600]  trying to succeed where they failed in 2020 to suppress the right of voters and subvert
[24:02.600 --> 24:09.760]  the electoral system itself that means denying your right to vote and deciding whether your
[24:09.760 --> 24:16.600]  vote even counts instead of waiting until the election is over they're starting well
[24:16.600 --> 24:24.920]  before it they're starting now they've emboldened violence and intimidation of voters and election
[24:24.920 --> 24:31.840]  officials it's estimated that there are more than 300 election deniers on the ballot all
[24:31.840 --> 24:41.200]  across America this year so you talk about trying to suppress the vote alias Hillary
[24:41.200 --> 24:45.240]  Clinton's Democrat Party lawyer has tried to block more than 30 people being able to
[24:45.240 --> 24:52.800]  run for office like MTG and others because she did question the 2020 election so we're
[24:52.800 --> 24:57.960]  not trying to take your vote we're just trying to not even let you vote for incumbents or
[24:57.960 --> 25:02.760]  people you're supporting if they question the election and they're trying to disqualify
[25:02.760 --> 25:06.760]  Trump for running again so they're trying to disqualify our popular candidates but they're
[25:06.760 --> 25:12.480]  not election meddling at all in no way then he spent a lot of time about Nancy Pelosi
[25:12.480 --> 25:16.760]  who doesn't want the surveillance footage that it turns out Homeland Security and the
[25:16.760 --> 25:22.000]  Department of the Capitol Police that's now nationwide they don't want that footage released
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.560]  they say it's a conspiracy theory we're not releasing why there were two naked men or
[25:25.560 --> 25:30.800]  men in underwear with hammers in a bedroom that Paul Pelosi said he knew him was a friend
[25:30.800 --> 25:38.880]  named David so here's a Biden on the Paul Pelosi attack he woke him up he wanted to tie him
[25:38.880 --> 25:48.520]  up the Salem ended up using a hammer to smash Paul's skull thankfully by the grace of God
[25:48.520 --> 25:57.440]  Paul survived all this happened after the assault and it just I thought it's hard to
[25:57.440 --> 26:05.120]  even say it's hard to even say after the Salem entered the home asking where's Nancy where's
[26:05.120 --> 26:10.600]  Nancy those are the very same words used by the mob when they stormed the United States
[26:10.600 --> 26:18.840]  Capitol on January the 6th release the footage all this is so scripted you'd have to be a
[26:18.840 --> 26:26.880]  moron not to see that I mean I'd give it a 95% chance that they had that guy drugged
[26:26.880 --> 26:30.640]  up didn't even know who he was turns out he's part of a hallucinogenic cult he's all connected
[26:30.640 --> 26:37.200]  to pedophilia his girlfriend's in prison for pedophile behavior and he's all over the place
[26:37.200 --> 26:42.040]  with the Democrats turns out that state senator in California that tries to legalize pedophilia
[26:42.040 --> 26:46.880]  and everything says oh he knows he knows who the attacker is doing for a long time today
[26:46.880 --> 26:54.640]  get this leftist wacko space cadet loony with pedo credentials all over the place literally
[26:54.640 --> 27:00.560]  showing up and and then no we're not releasing the footage here's Biden says we don't settle
[27:00.560 --> 27:06.000]  our differences with a riot we settle them peacefully at the ballot box oh with billions
[27:06.000 --> 27:12.720]  in damage and hundreds of dead dozens of shot police and citizens mostly peaceful protest
[27:12.720 --> 27:16.840]  I mean everything they say it and Scalise shot and trying to kill the baseball team the
[27:16.840 --> 27:24.000]  Republican baseball team here it is we don't settle our differences America with a riot
[27:24.000 --> 27:31.960]  a mob or a bullet or a hammer we settle them peacefully at the battle at the battle box
[27:31.960 --> 27:37.880]  ballot box I love how Obama's been doing this to everywhere he gets heckled by his own supporters
[27:37.880 --> 27:43.040]  from being a warmonger he says hey wait a minute you get your speech you'll get to talk later
[27:43.040 --> 27:47.680]  have your own rally yeah build your own internet build your own banking is that he platform
[27:47.680 --> 27:52.840]  us but they tell their people to go out and take over events but when we go and bring
[27:52.840 --> 28:02.800]  up points oh we're trying to deny democracy by having our voices heard and they do it over
[28:02.800 --> 28:08.160]  and over again and then they've got DHS illegally surveilling and spying to manipulate elections
[28:08.160 --> 28:12.280]  in their own words or any Americans didn't like the way the Afghan withdrawal was done
[28:12.280 --> 28:16.160]  or Americans don't like open borders or Americans that don't like lockdowns or Americans don't
[28:16.160 --> 28:20.120]  like force injections or Americans don't like censorship or Americans don't like Biden's
[28:20.120 --> 28:25.680]  health health you'll think it's a lie those are the big list we've got in this DHS data
[28:25.680 --> 28:30.360]  dump where they're trying to block you and intimidate you and manipulate elections and
[28:30.360 --> 28:33.480]  then he's got the nerve to sit up there and tell you he'd never do that while they're
[28:33.480 --> 28:40.200]  trying to disqualify the candidates he mentioned cool they can't run I mean they questioned

[33:36.640 --> 33:42.240]  president will continue to call attention to the threat to democratic integrity and to
[33:42.240 --> 33:48.960]  public safety posed by those who deny the documented truth about election result and
[33:48.960 --> 33:55.040]  those who seek to undermine public faith in our system of government unfortunately we
[33:55.040 --> 34:01.920]  have seen mega mega republican officials who don't believe in the rule of law they refuse
[34:01.920 --> 34:08.240]  to accept the results of free and fair elections and they fan the flames of political violence
[34:08.240 --> 34:14.800]  through what they praise and what they refuse to condemn it remains important for the president
[34:14.800 --> 34:27.040]  to state strongly and unequivocally that violence has no place in our democracy everything they're
[34:27.040 --> 34:32.240]  saying is an inversion of what they're actually doing welcome back to alex jones show all right

[34:39.480 --> 34:44.400]  five days out from the midterms we're going to be here next tuesday right through to probably
[34:44.400 --> 34:48.120]  two in the morning but they admit they're gonna try to steal the battleground states so we're
[34:48.120 --> 34:54.560]  going to be here uh tuesday wednesday thursday friday right through with what's happening
[34:54.560 --> 35:00.320]  i got to tell you all this talk about violence and imminent republican violence and republicans
[35:00.320 --> 35:06.760]  are going to pull something big that signals major false flag or provocateur operations
[35:06.760 --> 35:09.960]  which is a big staple that governments use all over the place they try to demonize me
[35:09.960 --> 35:14.000]  for popularizing the term false flag but now the state department has pressed conferences
[35:14.000 --> 35:21.440]  about russia they claim the staging false flags so it's beyond legitimate it's extremely
[35:21.440 --> 35:28.400]  essential to look at two benefits and ask the question kibono as the ancient romans
[35:28.400 --> 35:34.480]  did and ask who stands to gain blown up the north stream pipeline who stands again in
[35:34.480 --> 35:40.960]  a mass shooting that's almost always connected to dhs with some drugged up or focateur so
[35:40.960 --> 35:44.080]  that's what we're discussing here today and i want to give the toll free number out in
[35:44.080 --> 35:51.560]  a moment again for first time callers on the midterms on the spy networks that they now
[35:51.560 --> 35:56.640]  admit the government's running through big tech and the big banks and the adl illegally
[35:56.640 --> 36:03.760]  surveilling and censoring and debanking you i mean this is so dangerous and so evil i
[36:03.760 --> 36:07.920]  want to get your take on all of that i want to get your breakdown on the situation in
[36:07.920 --> 36:13.280]  ukraine there is a lot of huge subjects that we're going to be covering today more on carbon
[36:13.280 --> 36:18.720]  taxes spreading around the world and tips to big cows not just in the netherlands or the
[36:18.720 --> 36:26.880]  uk or canada but now in australia it's all coming up but again here's biden clip 8 says
[36:26.880 --> 36:34.080]  extreme manga republicans are trying to succeed where they failed in 2020 and instead of waiting
[36:34.080 --> 36:39.840]  until the election's over they're starting well before it they're starting now what
[36:42.640 --> 36:48.880]  meanwhile we have them dead to rights suppressing trying to overturn trumps election 2016
[36:48.880 --> 36:54.000]  stealing at 2020 suppressing the hunter biden laptop that's just one fbi operation they now
[36:54.000 --> 37:05.520]  admit it's everything the fbi of the dhs in their lifetime censoring the american people
[37:05.520 --> 37:11.200]  again if your neighbors censored you in some way it'd be it'd be a huge deal but when the
[37:11.200 --> 37:15.920]  government does it illegally and they admit it's illegal what do we do about this i'm
[37:15.920 --> 37:22.400]  going to turn the phone system on now and we're going to take your calls here the first round
[37:22.400 --> 37:28.080]  it'll be first time callers then after that after we've gone through about 15 calls or first timers
[37:28.080 --> 37:40.640]  blow up the phones up for everybody 877-789-2539 877-789-2539 and look to me that speech was
[37:41.520 --> 37:45.680]  i know you know i'm illegitimate i can't get a crowd of 50 people front gets crowds of 100
[37:45.680 --> 37:51.120]  thousand or more don't question it we're about to steal it again it's going to take days and days
[37:51.120 --> 37:55.760]  to count these ballots and battleground states just get used to it uh and the republicans are
[37:55.760 --> 38:00.480]  trying to steal it but if they say we stole it that doesn't exist as terrorists and we need to come
[38:00.480 --> 38:06.960]  together but half the american people are our enemy so it was divide and conquer and then on top
[38:06.960 --> 38:14.560]  of it saying let's all come together absolutely disgusting here's biden yet now extreme migrant
[38:14.560 --> 38:21.040]  republicans aim to question not only the legitimacy of past elections but elections being held
[38:21.040 --> 38:28.560]  now and into the future the extreme maga element of republican party which is a minority that party
[38:28.560 --> 38:36.240]  as i said earlier but it's this driving force is trying to succeed where they failed in 2020
[38:37.360 --> 38:45.440]  to suppress the right of voters and subvert the electoral system itself that means denying your
[38:45.440 --> 38:53.360]  right to vote and deciding whether your vote even counts instead of waiting until an election is over
[38:54.400 --> 38:58.080]  they're starting well before it they're starting now
[39:00.560 --> 39:04.800]  now hollywood the democratic party has been pumping out that white people are inherently
[39:04.800 --> 39:09.200]  evil white people commit the most crimes now that's true and that white people are the problem
[39:09.200 --> 39:13.520]  you see it everywhere you don't need to play club seven you know that's what they talk about like
[39:13.520 --> 39:21.440]  parents on methamphetamine but nitty comes out and talks about we need unity and not to see each
[39:21.440 --> 39:26.960]  other or the political lines we see to come together so we just demonize his opposition
[39:26.960 --> 39:32.800]  but now we need to come together all of it again is gaslighting all of it is Stockholm syndrome
[39:32.800 --> 39:41.280]  learned helplessness and it's not working but think about what he's really saying here you're
[39:41.280 --> 39:48.640]  not supposed to question what we're about to do in five days the play worked before two years ago
[39:48.640 --> 39:57.920]  they're about to run the same play yet again so when he says we need to start looking at each other
[39:57.920 --> 40:04.560]  again seeing ourselves as we the people not see each other as entrenched enemies but
[40:05.600 --> 40:10.480]  who's been bullying who's been censoring who's been attacking who's sick the IRS on hundreds of
[40:10.480 --> 40:16.880]  thousands of conservatives that was under Obama and it's all just intensify and they have the nerve
[40:18.240 --> 40:23.440]  to now have the Atlantic monthly come out and say let's all just have an amnesty for what we do
[40:23.440 --> 40:30.960]  with lockdowns and shots we're sorry while they still push for shots are most vulnerable our children
[40:32.320 --> 40:38.080]  there's biden about starting to look at each other again remember that democracy is a covenant
[40:38.080 --> 40:45.760]  and we need to start looking out for each other again seeing ourselves as we the people
[40:46.720 --> 40:54.400]  not as entrenched enemies this is a choice we can make we must vote knowing what's at stake and
[40:54.400 --> 41:01.360]  not just the policy of the moment but institutions that have held us together as we saw it a more
[41:01.360 --> 41:09.440]  perfect union are also at stake and then he goes on to say oh crimes really bad well wait I thought
[41:09.440 --> 41:14.320]  you had the FBI put out fake crown statistics saying it dropped enjoy bayhar and all of them say
[41:14.320 --> 41:23.440]  that crimes weigh down and inflation's weigh down and santa claus is real here's biden there's a lot
[41:23.440 --> 41:29.040]  at stake in these midterms our economy our safety our streets our personal freedoms but there's
[41:29.040 --> 41:34.000]  something else at stake democracy itself when everything they're doing is classical tyranny
[41:35.280 --> 41:40.880]  I know there's a lot at stake in these midterm elections from our economy the safety of our
[41:40.880 --> 41:46.640]  streets to our personal freedoms the future of health care social security medicare it's all important
[41:48.320 --> 41:53.280]  but we'll have our differences we'll have our difference of opinion and that's what it's supposed
[41:53.280 --> 42:02.560]  to be but there's something else at stake democracy itself I'm not the only one who sees it recent
[42:02.560 --> 42:11.120]  polls have shown that overwhelming majority now let's play one more big lie when we come back
[42:12.400 --> 42:18.080]  biden braggs is sort of his surrogates that he gave the biggest social security increase
[42:18.080 --> 42:27.280]  to social security recipients of their money in history but it's automatic in the law he had
[42:27.280 --> 42:32.480]  nothing to do with it because we have record inflation yes you did give people with your
[42:32.480 --> 42:37.680]  inflation you gave us the biggest increase and they estimate it's only half of what you actually
[42:37.680 --> 42:42.240]  need for the increase in cost of living anybody out there trying to buy stuff knows that so
[42:42.240 --> 42:49.200]  just everything is a load of fraudulent garbage out of this filthy demonic pedophile

[46:58.080 --> 47:06.880]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[47:17.920 --> 47:25.520]  it is mind control to tell you that inflation didn't exist a year and a half ago then say it's low
[47:25.520 --> 47:30.720]  then say it's good now say it's bad but don't worry biden gave social security recipients the
[47:30.720 --> 47:36.160]  biggest increase ever when it's already pre-programmed in the law since the 1990s that is the cost of
[47:36.160 --> 47:40.400]  living goes up it's added but they manipulate it it's only about half of what it should be
[47:41.120 --> 47:45.600]  i don't need to tell people on social security that your social security won't buy you dog food
[47:46.160 --> 47:51.120]  or won't buy you fuel and that the little increase they had that is the biggest in history
[47:51.120 --> 47:56.880]  is not anywhere near what you need to live and that's the basis of a universal basic income
[47:56.880 --> 48:02.240]  that's what it is is feudalism it's how the romans controlled Rome for the general poor masses
[48:02.240 --> 48:06.240]  was to keep them in a subsistence goal not enough to live but enough to control them
[48:07.680 --> 48:15.760]  here is the press secretary of you call it that the gaslighting puppet clown and she doesn't know
[48:15.760 --> 48:21.440]  how to answer the embarrassing tweet the white house put out yesterday that oh son biden gave you
[48:21.440 --> 48:26.400]  the biggest increase ever you're doing really good yeah because he gave us the biggest inflation ever
[48:26.400 --> 48:32.320]  here it is talked about the increase in social security benefits in 2023 uh worked through
[48:32.320 --> 48:36.720]  president biden's leadership there was a contextual note i'm not sure if the offered
[48:36.720 --> 48:41.600]  technology is from the platform that was added to that was it removed because of the addition of
[48:41.600 --> 48:46.960]  the note it was removed because of the concern about the abrasive message so it was i looked
[48:46.960 --> 48:52.320]  the tweet was not complete usually when we put out a tweet we posted with context and it did not
[48:52.320 --> 48:57.920]  have that context so in the past we've pointed out that for the first time in our in over a decade
[48:57.920 --> 49:04.560]  seniors medicare premiums will will decrease even as their social security checks increase that's a
[49:04.560 --> 49:09.280]  little bit of context that was not included this means that seniors will have a chance to get ahead
[49:09.280 --> 49:15.120]  of inflation due to the rare combination of rising benefits and falling premiums and and let's not
[49:15.120 --> 49:19.760]  forget as as you've been hearing me say for the past few minutes about maga republicans in congress
[49:19.760 --> 49:29.200]  and their continued threat uh to threaten social security and medicare so the republicans are
[49:29.200 --> 49:35.680]  threatening your savings and i i mean i'll say republican establishment's gone along with all
[49:35.680 --> 49:40.160]  of this and they do get a lot of the blame let's not let's not be deceptive about that but when
[49:40.160 --> 49:48.560]  biden said earlier that the maga republicans are a minority but a dangerous minority to their agenda
[49:49.600 --> 49:54.400]  that part was true not the minority part where the majority but we are dangerous their agenda
[49:54.400 --> 49:59.680]  and we are driving the republican party because you go to any republican event or any rally or
[49:59.680 --> 50:06.720]  look at any statistic or number 80 percent of republicans are now populist anti-new world
[50:06.720 --> 50:11.200]  order folks and the globalists give info wars in our audience the credit that we helped wake people
[50:11.200 --> 50:17.360]  up they call radicalization trump then energized it and took it to the next level whether you
[50:17.360 --> 50:26.320]  like trump or not he did a great job at energizing it and now we've almost taken the republican party
[50:26.320 --> 50:34.720]  over and the power structure is in abject total complete panic about it so we're not the minority
[50:35.680 --> 50:40.960]  we're the diverse majority of republican voters upwards of 80 percent even in studies
[50:42.000 --> 50:48.160]  are identifying with trump identifying with alex jones that's why they panic in media
[50:48.160 --> 50:52.880]  matters and see an end ago why the main line republicans are defending jones now and they're
[50:52.880 --> 50:59.120]  echoing his talking points yeah exactly because they're not my talking points i'm on your criminal
[50:59.120 --> 51:06.640]  asses and i read your white papers and i study you felt claus swab and bill gates and king charles
[51:06.640 --> 51:14.560]  and all you people and i bet on humanity and i believe in humanity you bet against us and you
[51:14.560 --> 51:20.560]  watch i may not make it to see the victory but you're going down and you can feel it in your dirty

[1:00:18.800 --> 1:00:44.720]  information war it's alex jones
[1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:54.160]  this summer clloe coal spoke out against california's passing of sp 107 testifying that both her
[1:00:54.160 --> 1:01:01.120]  and her parents were manipulated and bullied by the state to undergo destructive life changing
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:08.480]  surgeries and while florida bans puberty blockers and so-called sexual reassignment surgeries for
[1:01:08.480 --> 1:01:15.520]  minors california governor gavin newson signs a bill allowing children from any state in the
[1:01:15.520 --> 1:01:23.600]  country to go to california for transgender medical procedures without parental consent california is
[1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:30.640]  being hailed by the death cult as a transgender surgery sanctuary state now providing chemical
[1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:37.280]  and surgical castrations for all of america's children according to this new law california
[1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:43.760]  can take emergency jurisdiction over any child from anywhere if there's a disagreement between
[1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:52.240]  the parent and the state of california over how to treat a child's gender distress sp 107 states
[1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:58.800]  that taking a child away from the child's parents is justifiable if it is done to pursue gender
[1:01:58.800 --> 1:02:06.400]  transition procedures in california and allows for the state to wage child custody claims against
[1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:14.240]  out-of-state parents sp 107 forbids healthcare providers from providing medical information
[1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:21.920]  related to gender identity procedures to a child's parent even if sought under a subpoena after
[1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:29.360]  permanently mutilating her own adopted child kathy molig has been working full time for california
[1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:37.120]  nonprofit trans family support services where she reaches out to hundreds of children all across
[1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:44.880]  the country luring them to california to castrate themselves she often does so without the parents
[1:02:44.880 --> 1:02:52.800]  knowledge i work with a lot of youth um before they tell their families and and helping them
[1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:58.960]  in shaping what that looks like her work focuses on conservative communities where parents may not
[1:02:58.960 --> 1:03:04.240]  approve of having their children castrated we have kids coming from all over the country for our
[1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:11.440]  virtual groups we also opened a chapter in huntsville alabama because the people in red states
[1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:18.320]  really need as much support as they can get from us allies in particular in states like california
[1:03:18.320 --> 1:03:24.640]  and oregon and washington for whatever reason people are allowing this incredibly evil attack
[1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:32.320]  against their own children and recently laura logan interviewed a un insider who explained to her
[1:03:32.320 --> 1:03:40.240]  why children are the biggest target i get it but i don't get it the children you just you got to i
[1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:47.040]  still have i have such a problem with this you got to explain this one to me and he said um well
[1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:52.400]  first of all you're looking at it the wrong way i said what do you mean and he said well they don't
[1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:57.600]  define children the way you do they don't define the world the way you do the choices that you face
[1:03:57.600 --> 1:04:03.280]  are not their choices right they have a good they look at it completely differently and uh
[1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:10.720]  and i said well okay so how do they look at it and he said for them everything is defined by their
[1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:20.640]  one fundamental all-consuming purpose i said which is what he said to defeat god for them the younger
[1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:30.960]  you are the closer you are to god the more pain they can inflict on god so the more you can make
[1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:38.880]  a baby or a small child suffer the greater your victory over god and that is the only consideration
[1:04:38.880 --> 1:04:47.360]  for them reporting for info wars this is greg reese your phone calls are 60 seconds away
[1:04:47.360 --> 1:04:52.640]  they're literally luring children kidnapping and cutting their genitals off can't get more
[1:04:52.640 --> 1:04:55.680]  evil than that these people are satan
[1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:04.560]  don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you
[1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:10.320]  and the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars because they rightly see us as one of
[1:05:10.320 --> 1:05:16.480]  the main beacons of resistance alerting the people not as of america but the world for the threat
[1:05:16.480 --> 1:05:21.360]  of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny that's why it's so essential today

[1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:38.960]  every day above grounds a good day by destruction if that's what god chooses is not a defeat it is
[1:06:38.960 --> 1:06:46.080]  a victory the children they're under unprecedented attack by poisoned shots
[1:06:46.080 --> 1:06:53.840]  that's transgender mutilation and the rest of it are begging for god to save them but god works
[1:06:53.840 --> 1:07:00.880]  through us and if we don't heed that call we'll be damn doing eternity cut off from a living god

[1:07:11.600 --> 1:07:17.600]  great points and topics you want to hit and cover here today let's go to joseph in australia where
[1:07:17.600 --> 1:07:22.400]  they are one of the main epicenters of covered lockdown tyranny he wants to speak to that joseph
[1:07:22.400 --> 1:07:27.840]  thanks for calling from the land down under oh hey alex uh first of all i have to say you're
[1:07:27.840 --> 1:07:33.200]  doing the lord's work and thank you so much for it and as well you are completely right with
[1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:38.720]  covid at the moment that just started putting on the news that there's going to be a wave somehow
[1:07:38.720 --> 1:07:43.920]  that predicting waves of weeks and months before they're talking about putting back in restrictions
[1:07:43.920 --> 1:07:48.400]  as well as i have heard the australian health break to the agency is to you registering dr
[1:07:48.400 --> 1:07:52.720]  and for those doing that in canada and europe's doing it and the democrats are planning it here
[1:07:52.720 --> 1:07:58.160]  absolutely they're planning a comeback with the same assault two more points as well two points
[1:07:58.160 --> 1:08:02.800]  on corrupt with the corruption for example in south australia here in adelaide um
[1:08:02.800 --> 1:08:08.960]  judges are involved in shipping in drugs um and i think it's even deepened down i think it's
[1:08:08.960 --> 1:08:14.080]  involved in spy entries as well and it's also why you see there's a rising youth crime across
[1:08:14.080 --> 1:08:20.960]  australia and these young people also are threatened with the with violence um and some
[1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:26.640]  to escape that in their own lives and as well up in ap y lands in south australia where the
[1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:35.120]  british um military tested nukes uh back in the 60s i can't remember exactly uh it's primarily
[1:08:35.120 --> 1:08:41.200]  just indians an indigence population um and i talk to indigenous people up there and they tell me
[1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:46.560]  about all these things they see in all these experiments things flying in the air and they
[1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:53.680]  believe it's god but it it's clearly technology that is not of this planet and we have no business
[1:08:53.680 --> 1:09:02.160]  touching it very interesting uh but but what is the backlash in australia from what i've seen
[1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:08.320]  the people are getting really angry and awake um so for example with my neighbors and the older
[1:09:08.320 --> 1:09:13.440]  people know exactly what's up they knew from the start something was wrong but pretty much every
[1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:20.240]  young person is completely brainwashed which is just sad to see um there have been protests in
[1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:25.120]  that way it's quite a small city so they haven't they haven't been too big um but they're pretty
[1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:32.080]  much just dismissed by the media um as loonies and crazies like of course they would but now you've
[1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:36.160]  been fully vindicated the shots don't work and make you sick god bless you joseph appreciate the
[1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:42.400]  call we're taking calls in order they're received tim and fema region nine tim go ahead hi elix is
[1:09:42.400 --> 1:09:47.840]  tim long-time listener first-time caller did it happen here i wanted to mention you know i i looked
[1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:54.480]  up the for a so-called plosie attacker just did a quick search online and you know the guy is 42
[1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:59.200]  years old it looks like he's a pretty hefty guy and i just think it's kind of laughable that they
[1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:05.920]  would put this story out that a feeble 82-year-old alcoholic could spend somebody like that off
[1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:10.640]  that would be able to stop him at all well the police say in the police report they came in
[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:15.440]  and both men were in their underwear with hammers beating each other with hammers and that that's
[1:10:15.440 --> 1:10:21.200]  on record yeah it's it's just laughable that they think that we're that global that we'll notice
[1:10:21.200 --> 1:10:28.000]  now as cernovich says asking for evidence is the new conspiracy theory washington post released the
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:34.240]  video is mostly a way to extend the conspiracy theory with the paul polosi attack police body
[1:10:34.240 --> 1:10:38.960]  camera footage of attack on paul polosi could be released at the trial of gop
[1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:47.280]  so it goes on at the trial as gop demands the footage so they do not want that information
[1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:52.880]  out for some reason i doubt they'll ever release the body cam footage because that would show the
[1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:59.840]  size difference and age difference and just how impractical that whole situation is well it's
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:04.960]  just like before the midterms we've seen all the censorship and right before the last general
[1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:10.480]  election they suppressed the hunter biden laptop it's the same story over and over and over again
[1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:15.920]  i appreciate you calling let's go ahead and go to jim in north carolina jim go ahead yeah alice
[1:11:15.920 --> 1:11:20.800]  would buy in speech last night i mean why would you you know technically follow up the philadelphia
[1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:27.040]  speech you know which was so badly received with this speech last night and sprinkle in some hey
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:32.960]  it's uh it's going to take us some time to count the votes okay unless you knew you were going to
[1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:39.280]  have a steal in place he was prepping everybody not to question the steal and saying that he was
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:43.920]  elected you know totally fair and square the cleanest election ever and then demonizing his
[1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:47.680]  opposition then saying that they're going to try to steal the next election that's what he said
[1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:54.000]  nothing about how the country is going nothing about how to change how badly things are going
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:12:00.880]  not one word about that no everything is paul polosi in his underwear with a dude with a hammer
[1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:05.440]  yeah and see i don't believe one reason i don't believe that and i'm you know is because like with
[1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:12.400]  the uh where's nancy where's nancy that just that just seems like you know there's no way that would
[1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:18.000]  happen again like that and then they directly tied to january six that was the whole point if
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:22.960]  ever wrote up uh that uh script i hear you what do you think's going to happen the next five days
[1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:27.840]  yeah well i mean i don't have the faith that it's not going to something's not going to happen like
[1:12:27.840 --> 1:12:34.800]  i said but last night their attitude they they doubled down everything they against even even
[1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:39.520]  their own party will say i want to take a different road they don't do that they go down the same road
[1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:44.960]  they don't change at all and then when there's a big mass shooting or bombing they can say see we
[1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:50.640]  told you so i mean that's what i thought watching it last night this morning i thought he is signaling
[1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:55.600]  massive false flag yeah i mean that's that's that's exactly my tape because he didn't mention anything
[1:12:55.600 --> 1:13:00.800]  why even be on there i was surprised the networks didn't run it last night because if they did
[1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:06.480]  you know the republicans should get an ad on the networks so i'm i guess that's why that's been
[1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:10.960]  run i agree have you seen the videos of his hands with all the needle marks they've got him hooked up
[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:16.560]  to drugs every day appreciate your call brother great points all right up next is erin in wisconsin
[1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:23.120]  erin welcome hey jones i just wanted to make a quick point and share battle roar with you if i could
[1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:28.160]  so you can make a commercial out of it but uh look with all these narratives that they craft
[1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:33.200]  it's not people like you and people like me who want to build narratives we want straight forward
[1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:38.000]  i want to obliterate you with my ideas and my speech and embarrass you so you go away and your
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:44.080]  ideas are wiped off the stage okay no violence none of that we don't need that and just so you
[1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:55.600]  really know how i feel yeah that's right let's go so what do you think they're gonna pull what do
[1:13:55.600 --> 1:14:00.240]  you think they're gonna pull what do you think of the speech last night i mean it's it's like you
[1:14:00.240 --> 1:14:05.440]  said earlier if you can't see these narratives getting constructed i mean we're we're now we're
[1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:09.680]  getting out ahead of the election and we're gonna cheat before it even happened it's it's obvious
[1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:14.480]  these people are back into a corner they've got no choice i mean that makes them dangerous so they
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:20.720]  deserve that respect i live you know i vote in milwaukee and this is one of the places uh you
[1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:26.720]  know that that was really highly contested in 2020 and you can't put anything past them they're
[1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:31.760]  dangerous they're in a corner they're all going to prison or worse that's the point is they have
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:41.600]  nothing to lose great point all right jared in michigan go ahead welcome hey uh so the liberal
[1:14:41.600 --> 1:14:46.640]  democrats they just you know how they they tell us what they're gonna do and they keep you know like
[1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:51.120]  they're stealing the elections all this stuff is so we go and vote but they're still telling us
[1:14:51.120 --> 1:14:55.360]  they're gonna steal it and do all this crap and they just do it in front of us but there's nothing
[1:14:55.360 --> 1:14:59.680]  we can really do or you know what i mean like what happens when we vote and they just steal it again
[1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:05.680]  you know i get that a lot on the street and just everybody asked me well there's election fraud
[1:15:05.680 --> 1:15:11.360]  why vote because they have to use the names of dead people and they have to use the names people
[1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:15.600]  that have moved out of state so they have a limited pool that they've got that's why they're
[1:15:15.600 --> 1:15:22.480]  picking certain states are going to try to steal in key battlegrounds and so a massive tsunami here's
[1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:28.720]  a dumb way a simple way of saying it there's 350 million americans and let's say 300 million
[1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:36.480]  or voting age or 270 million whatever it is if they all voted republican they they couldn't
[1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:42.240]  statistically say republicans lost because it isn't possible so it's it's it's it's a smaller
[1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:46.720]  margin than that but that's basically what's happening jared love you all right i'm taking

[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:50.160]  let's go ahead and talk to derrick in montana derrick thanks for holding her on the air
[1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:59.360]  oh what an honor uh last night's speech i thought was uh just a call to action prepare the ballots
[1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:08.160]  and prepare the propaganda and take as much time as you need yeah that was it he was the talking
[1:21:08.160 --> 1:21:12.320]  point is we're going to steal the election and when they challenge it they're criminals but
[1:21:12.320 --> 1:21:16.880]  they're going to steal the election and uh we're going to take all the time we need to steal the
[1:21:16.880 --> 1:21:20.960]  election it was the exact same thing we saw two years ago people say well why are they running
[1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:28.480]  the same play because it worked that's right and and now we can't question before during her after
[1:21:29.200 --> 1:21:38.000]  or you're a terrorist so what do you think we should do derrick well i i think you got to use
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:43.840]  the virginia model and just make sure that uh as many people as possible are in there watching
[1:21:43.840 --> 1:21:52.480]  the process itself and uh you know if they steal it they're just gonna uh show their show their cards
[1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:57.680]  even more than they did last time well you know that's really the thing is
[1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:04.960]  callers constantly calling we've already had two today saying why are you promoting an election
[1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:09.520]  of their fraud well why are the globalists in there trying to steal it so bad that's where
[1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:14.000]  the fight is obviously there's fraud we've got to watch it we've got to expose it they call
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:19.680]  election meddling when we expose election fraud and when we stop it so the battle is over our
[1:22:19.680 --> 1:22:24.560]  electoral process and we know it's been taken over and so we can't just say oh we'll screw this it's a
[1:22:24.560 --> 1:22:31.120]  fraud we've got to engage and and and a bunch of states to pass laws against the fraud we're
[1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:34.880]  actually starting to climb out of this and it doesn't mean there's ever going to be some perfect
[1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:43.360]  place we're going it's a process yeah and and like myself i think more people will just
[1:22:43.360 --> 1:22:48.800]  awaken to it even if it is a slow process like i've i've only been listening to you for a year now
[1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:55.280]  maybe a year and a half and uh i think more and more people are just becoming awake to what
[1:22:55.280 --> 1:23:01.280]  what's really going on thanks for the call great points derrick don and florida don go ahead
[1:23:01.280 --> 1:23:11.840]  yes alex long time listener first time caller thank you i believe i'm a clear critical thinker
[1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:18.480]  i have a phd so i just don't follow anybody for any reason and i believe that we will win the
[1:23:18.480 --> 1:23:23.200]  election but we have to be vigilant because they are going to try to steal it as we saw today on
[1:23:23.200 --> 1:23:31.680]  info wars news that a judge in arizona is stopping the mule watchers which is ridiculous that we
[1:23:31.680 --> 1:23:39.920]  need the mule watches out there and i have bought x3 in the past i have not used it yet i'm saving
[1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:48.080]  it in case of a nuclear war and i've bought the info wars crew t-shirt and info wars mask before
[1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:54.160]  thank you i'm not vaccinated even though masks don't really work and you are my hero and jesus is
[1:23:54.800 --> 1:24:00.560]  too as my dad used to be my hero but god bless you i hope jesus and your dad are way above me

[1:24:05.920 --> 1:24:12.480]  polynomial cyst that hasn't healed and i needed my hip replaced three years before that and um
[1:24:12.480 --> 1:24:17.760]  if i could have a prayer from all the listeners out there to help me because my general surgeon

[1:27:29.120 --> 1:27:33.600]  big red wave coming and i really have good feelings about the elections even though they're
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:37.680]  going to try and steal it i don't think they're going to get away with it everybody's watching them
[1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:44.800]  and they just well anyway i can't wait to see what they do now you're certainly right that we
[1:27:44.800 --> 1:27:49.120]  forced the corruption out in the open and now we're going to make them steal it in front of us again
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:52.880]  and that's just going to cause an even bigger awakening so people say well this is going to
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:57.760]  steal it again that'll just make people more mad that's what i'm saying i think the deep staters
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:02.160]  are going to let the republicans win the house maybe even gets a few seats in the senate but
[1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:07.840]  they're going to mitigate this massive realignment that just happened and so that because they know
[1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:13.120]  stealing two in a row is too much that they're going to have a partial theft yes
[1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:21.600]  but i just everybody is so fed up that i i just can't i could see everybody just hitting the streets

[1:33:46.480 --> 1:33:53.760]  now the next caller
[1:33:54.960 --> 1:33:58.720]  because we only asked your name where you're calling from if you want to give us a topic it's fine
[1:33:58.720 --> 1:34:03.120]  he said midterms democrats will let republicans win blame game and that's something i've been
[1:34:03.120 --> 1:34:07.760]  thinking there's a huge red wave they have trouble stopping it but the more powerful groups behind
[1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:14.000]  all this are like well we'll just blame republicans for all the inflation and the war and the border
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:18.960]  collapsing once republicans get control of congress
[1:34:22.560 --> 1:34:25.360]  that is definitely what they would do in the past i don't know
[1:34:27.360 --> 1:34:31.600]  with this we're beachhead we've got a populism in the republican party if they're gonna let
[1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:37.440]  that happen because they're so scared but that's certainly a very astute historical discussion
[1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:44.080]  to have john your take on it hey alex um i'd like to you to um i have uh something i'd
[1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:49.120]  like to donate to your legal fund and i'd like to uh put you to put me on hold after a call
[1:34:49.120 --> 1:34:53.600]  because i have actually a picasso in war hall that i'd like to donate to your legal fund
[1:34:54.640 --> 1:35:00.720]  so that's pretty amazing a picasso war war any war hall well make sure we call this fellow back
[1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:06.080]  and talk to him as we need the funds that would be beautiful brother uh yeah what i was calling
[1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:10.640]  about alex is uh you know i really think the democrats are going to let the republicans
[1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:15.680]  win both the house and senate in these midterms and the reason why is because of what you know
[1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:20.480]  i hear on your show not only on your show other people are picking up about the diesel fuel shortages
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:27.040]  about the coming food shortages and you know our country's a mess so you really think biden and
[1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:31.680]  the democrats want to blame no they're going probably you know let the republicans win the
[1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:37.040]  midterm so they can blame the republicans and that's exactly what i think's going to happen so
[1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:40.480]  and you know they already said well the republicans plan on stealing the election
[1:35:40.480 --> 1:35:45.120]  the republicans you know plan on doing this and that yeah so this is joe byer's perfect chance
[1:35:45.120 --> 1:35:50.320]  to blame their republicans and then what's going to happen their street soldiers and we know who
[1:35:50.320 --> 1:35:55.920]  they are they're going to be out there looting around and just burn the cities down all across
[1:35:55.920 --> 1:36:01.520]  america again and they're and they're what's what time's going to blame the republicans and this is
[1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:07.520]  unfortunate but i think this is going to happen i mean i think that's definitely the cards how
[1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:13.600]  do we counter that you can't really counter that i think the republicans need to speak out now
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:17.680]  about you know where this country's really going i mean this i mean the seriousness even
[1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:24.640]  our currency crashing into bricks the uh brazil russia india china south at south africa already
[1:36:24.640 --> 1:36:30.080]  plan on starting a new currency no nobody's even that's not even being reported on on our
[1:36:30.080 --> 1:36:35.360]  mainstream media and i really think this information needs to get out there i know you had gray gray
[1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:40.160]  manorino on uh last week talking ill insurer about this yeah things are really critical
[1:36:40.160 --> 1:36:43.920]  and i don't think the democrats want to be blamed for this so they're going to have the republicans
[1:36:43.920 --> 1:36:52.400]  to blame so i'm just well for those that don't know there is a global political financial takeover
[1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:59.120]  happening and it's a lot bigger than america or brazil or or or france or germany or the u k or
[1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:06.480]  russia or even china or india or african nations this is their big takeover there's a worldwide
[1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:11.440]  destabilization happening there's an excellent article from live site news dot com on that post
[1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:16.640]  it info wars dot com globalists have engineered a financial collapse to pave the way for a new
[1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:22.320]  economic world order and they're all saying that so you're absolutely right there's a lot of big
[1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:29.760]  stuff going on i just uh wish you the best alex i mean i i feel like i'm talking to one of two
[1:37:29.760 --> 1:37:34.800]  angels that's in revelations in the book of revelations in the end that get persecuted i believe
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:40.320]  you might be one of the angels at the end of the end times well i'm an angel we're in a lot of
[1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:43.920]  trouble i just somebody that want to roll over to tyranny brother that's i'm just like you i just
[1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:47.920]  happened to get a talk show and i really appreciate what you don't hold and yeah that's a great idea
[1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:52.560]  with listeners anything folks want to donate we should create like a donate at info wars dot com
[1:37:53.120 --> 1:37:58.160]  where you could send us emails of what you want to donate and you've got my pledge if you donate
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:06.320]  a truck or sell it give us the proceeds or you donate a a painting a hundred percent will go to
[1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:12.000]  fund this operation now quite frankly i i agree to a deal i'll just be honest with listeners
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:18.240]  where i'm currently getting paid forty thousand dollars a month to work here and i could live off
[1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:24.000]  that i don't need a bunch of i got a truck and i got a car and a nice decent house with a little
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:32.080]  pool in the back and i just i'm a suburban guy but i that's the the the bankruptcy court said
[1:38:32.080 --> 1:38:38.720]  i've got to pay 40 of the legal bills well we had over 60 democrat funded lawsuits we've knocked
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:45.120]  them down to two to two that aren't tried yet you just saw the sandy hook show trials they say
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:49.520]  they'll be overturned on appeal that cost hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars each appeal
[1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:53.200]  they got one more sandy hook show trial that'll cost three or four thousand dollars
[1:38:53.760 --> 1:38:58.160]  and you just add it all together it's millions of dollars that i don't have i don't have up now
[1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:05.120]  in the accounting a couple days ago and uh i'm right at about a million dollars in the bank and
[1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:09.920]  people that's a lot of money well yeah if you're a regular person i have to have that as emergency
[1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:14.640]  funds for things and so i'm going to be out of that money very very soon and the way they've
[1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:20.480]  positioned it the bankruptcy uh 40 thousand dollars a month is not paying the bills uh and so
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:24.800]  in my legal bills personally are over a hundred thousand dollars a month and i'm not bitching
[1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:28.880]  i'm not a victim i'm not complaining i always trust in god that people are going to come through
[1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:35.440]  but when we got that big bitcoin donation i hadn't had proper accounting done and it turned out that
[1:39:35.440 --> 1:39:44.240]  we were insolvent six million dollars in the hole in the last year and literally the amount of money
[1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:50.480]  whoever it was i don't know who they are was literally the amount of money we needed to pay
[1:39:50.480 --> 1:39:54.640]  off the past debts we had like multi-million dollar bandwidth bills that were like six months
[1:39:54.640 --> 1:40:00.560]  old i hadn't really been told about thank god the big groups didn't leave us with that and
[1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:07.120]  then we had two million dollars extra that we used about product that you're now buying
[1:40:07.120 --> 1:40:11.120]  that has a markup in it but they were just telling me during the break they said hey boss
[1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:17.200]  we can't do 60 off on all these that we're losing money on two of the products and i said raise the
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:21.840]  price they said well that looks like he raises the lower we just gotta not say it i said okay well
[1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:26.240]  after the sale then if it's costing us more to buy something i'm going to have to increase the 10
[1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:30.880]  percent you know everybody gets the inflation so that's the thing we're dealing with and i don't
[1:40:30.880 --> 1:40:34.800]  want to spend all my time on the business end i'm not complaining but i spend half my time now or
[1:40:34.800 --> 1:40:39.360]  more not on air jacking with the money to fund this place it would be a great blessing and i could
[1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:43.840]  do more on air and and and fight the globalist more and do more interviews if we had the money
[1:40:43.840 --> 1:40:49.040]  but i'm not complaining i don't even know how insolvent we were a year ago the money came in
[1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:54.640]  god will provide again or it's time and god's plan for me to downsize or not be on air and i don't
[1:40:54.640 --> 1:40:59.520]  want to quit i'll never quit but if god i'll keep fighting as hard as i can and then if god decides
[1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:05.040]  that i'm not supposed to have the support working through you if you decide god working through you
[1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:10.480]  that means you if you decided to take me out of the game maybe that's what's supposed to happen
[1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:14.000]  maybe i'm gonna have a heart attack in two years if i don't stop maybe god's like hey you've you've
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:21.040]  got enough buddy and so i'm really at peace about all this and i don't want to stop fighting and i
[1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:27.360]  but i i i mean i can tell you that we need you to go to info warshore.com and and get alex's war

[1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:45.840]  yeah i just want to say i have never found an issue that that woke people up quicker than this
[1:47:45.840 --> 1:47:52.960]  covid mandate vaccine issue and i don't know why we're going into the midterms why every candidate
[1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:58.560]  who is running for senator congress democratic it's called big pharma money but but the ones
[1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:03.440]  that are the best that are exposing it absolutely the republicans should be driving this issue
[1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:10.000]  yeah i have never seen so many people wake up to the new world order agenda than what they saw
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:14.960]  happened during covid and all these mandates getting pushed and why are the democrats don't
[1:48:14.960 --> 1:48:19.200]  have to spend it now when we're one week away from the election everybody just forgot about
[1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:25.600]  covid the entire last six months hey from your mouth to god's ears and that's what i've been
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:31.280]  saying to trump and everybody else is get against this shot it's the unifying issue democrats hate
[1:48:31.280 --> 1:48:36.560]  it too almost all of them what the hell they're now targeting our children let's go after this
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:43.200]  that's why the mouth of the new world order atlantic monthly is like let's forget it you know
[1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:47.840]  give us and the steve we're sorry what we did while they're still mandating it for kids they're not
[1:48:47.840 --> 1:48:55.680]  stopping everything they do they do is in bad faith they push this on the american people and expose
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:49:01.680]  them and now they have to own it and the big media is covering for them and everybody's forgot
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:06.720]  about the covid vaccine mandate everybody's forgot about the shutdown everybody's forgot about what
[1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:12.080]  these democrats really are and i really think that there is no other issue that's exposed the new
[1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:17.520]  world order like what they don't agree everything you said is the key to everything again i've met
[1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:20.800]  with globalists and people said why'd you meet with globalists because i met with them was off
[1:49:20.800 --> 1:49:26.320]  record many times and i've also run into them they always tell me the public has no memory kid
[1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:31.920]  you're gonna lose they bet everything on this not any memory well i got a memory and our our
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:37.920]  audience has a memory and i think the public has a memory too and look they are even the politicians
[1:49:37.920 --> 1:49:43.360]  aren't making the deadly shots an issue the public is saying it's the lockdowns and what happened in
[1:49:43.360 --> 1:49:49.280]  crime and open borders and inflation so regardless they're losing which again
[1:49:51.200 --> 1:49:55.360]  joshua makes them dangerous i'm worried about a false flag the next five days what do you think
[1:49:56.080 --> 1:50:01.280]  well i'm i'm aware of it i think that the threat is real i think they definitely want to gin up a
[1:50:01.280 --> 1:50:06.000]  lot of violence they want to say how dangerous republicans are americans republicans love this
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:13.440]  country republicans want a live order republicans don't run this country republicans built it
[1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:18.240]  republicans do all the damn work we all know it and and they're they're black and they're white
[1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:21.760]  and they're hispanic and they're old and they're young and they're asian and they're everywhere
[1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:26.560]  and everybody knows real business people real hardworking people are republicans we're not
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:31.040]  perfect but it's the best party we've got this country and we're taking the republican party

[1:50:59.040 --> 1:51:03.600]  for you to talk about i think it's really important so you know listen to everyone needs to listen to
[1:51:03.600 --> 1:51:09.440]  this show they need to watch 2000 meals they need to understand the dynamic between bannon and alex
[1:51:09.440 --> 1:51:14.000]  when they talk you have a micro and a macro strategy there it's a perfect balance but
[1:51:15.600 --> 1:51:21.440]  and this kind of ties into the last caller who was really spot on um and this goes to the show
[1:51:21.440 --> 1:51:29.520]  do you remember back in around 2010 the documentary you guys did with alan watt called understanding

[1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:26.160]  that we put out for free and uh yeah absolutely it's it's a it's a very very uh important talk
[1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:31.360]  and uh again you'll see him in a bunch of different positions different different places
[1:53:31.360 --> 1:53:37.280]  as we interviewed him over uh actually two trips to canada two trips to canada uh he
[1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:42.160]  really really smart guy and it's a real loss on having him uh let's talk to a rick in arizona
[1:53:42.160 --> 1:53:51.840]  rick around the air welcome hey alec you the man i got this clown world idea here uh you guys are
[1:53:51.840 --> 1:53:58.960]  in texas and louisiana texas louisiana they have all the refining capacity right for uh diesel and
[1:53:58.960 --> 1:54:06.880]  distillates um now this hysterical nonsense that's going on about us running out of diesel
[1:54:06.880 --> 1:54:13.840]  yeah if diesel production has stopped then i guess we're in deep doo doo but as far as i know uh
[1:54:13.840 --> 1:54:19.520]  production has not stopped for diesel so no it hasn't so so explain what's causing the bottleneck
[1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:27.600]  uh i think petroleum companies want to make a windfall process profit out of fear and panic
[1:54:27.600 --> 1:54:33.280]  well i mean i i mean i agree that the main driver's inflation but when biden occasionally tells the
[1:54:33.280 --> 1:54:37.760]  truth he says i'm gonna go after the oil companies they're definitely globalists and they're definitely
[1:54:37.760 --> 1:54:43.120]  part of the whole problem well yeah they they intend to stop well i mean look at the regulations
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:48.800]  they've shut down half our refineries in the us well you know i think the state should take
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:54.640]  control here so you got uh refineries in texas refineries in louisiana tell the federal government
[1:54:54.640 --> 1:55:00.080]  to take a hike i totally agree texas can do it well let me expand on that because i have family
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:04.240]  you know that owns cattle and we've been in the cattle industry for 200 plus years here in texas
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:10.800]  when you are about 200 years when you pull back from that the average beef producer makes record
[1:55:10.800 --> 1:55:17.040]  low money and basically breaks even like we do but since they shut down 90 plus percent of the meat
[1:55:17.040 --> 1:55:21.680]  packing companies there's only four big companies really about to be three that's where they all
[1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:26.720]  the price gouging goes on so it's the same way we have plenty of oil plenty of gas plenty of coal
[1:55:26.720 --> 1:55:32.000]  but they've just shut down the refining and and and production and use of it and so that's where
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:37.440]  the problem is beef should be incredibly cheap and you'd still have good profits for the producers
[1:55:37.440 --> 1:55:41.920]  but the producers get almost nothing and the meat packers they get all the money and i don't mean
[1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:45.360]  the meat packer working in a meat packing facility the companies that own that
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:54.800]  talking to your phone again has been stopped you believe that the production of diesel has
[1:55:54.800 --> 1:56:00.560]  been stopped then and they're not making any new diesel at all no when we say if you do the
[1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:07.920]  numbers it planes out to they will not you have any new supplies and it'll be behind schedule
[1:56:07.920 --> 1:56:14.480]  and major shortages starting in like 12 days that's crazy and it's been done because
[1:56:14.480 --> 1:56:19.280]  biden shut down one of the biggest diesel refineries he curtailed it with regulators and a bunch of
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:25.280]  others they've shut down a bunch of delivery systems there's there there are supply problems
[1:56:25.280 --> 1:56:29.440]  i mean i talk to oil company folks that work at every level of it i've most of my a lot of my
[1:56:29.440 --> 1:56:34.720]  family works at every level from roughnecks to plant managers to you know delivery companies you
[1:56:34.720 --> 1:56:40.480]  name it and they have been scavenging under the last three years under the lockdowns and control
[1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:47.760]  for oil well and gas equipment and parts to plants and so a lot of the parts aren't made here
[1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:53.760]  and so they can't get the parts and the plants are breaking down does that make sense yeah it kind
[1:56:53.760 --> 1:57:00.640]  of makes me want to scream like my screaming goat here hey rick i appreciate your call brother yeah
[1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:08.960]  thank you look it's a supply chain breakdown and a lot of this is people don't realize that a lot
[1:57:08.960 --> 1:57:13.440]  of companies have their set prices and so they kind of keep those there for their customers
[1:57:13.440 --> 1:57:17.600]  because you have less money and there's inflation so you want to keep prices the same this morning
[1:57:17.600 --> 1:57:24.080]  i had a meeting and they go hey you can't offer 60 off we lose five percent on that i'm like oh
[1:57:25.360 --> 1:57:30.880]  okay well we should raise prices well then people don't like that well but you're you're caught in
[1:57:30.880 --> 1:57:35.520]  that well just lower we didn't say this but other people just lower quality we haven't done that
[1:57:35.520 --> 1:57:42.480]  but i mean this is the position we're in we're running out of everything we are in deep trouble
[1:57:42.480 --> 1:57:50.800]  i don't seem to be negative but so we can get ready it's our best seller we first came out
[1:57:50.800 --> 1:57:56.240]  with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller but as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and

[1:59:13.600 --> 1:59:18.000]  and i warned the public as a modern paul revere but i couldn't have done it without your support
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:22.080]  and now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet not just america
[1:59:22.080 --> 1:59:26.640]  we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda that's why it's more important
[1:59:26.640 --> 1:59:31.520]  than ever to realize how successful info wars has been because of your past support so i salute
[1:59:31.520 --> 1:59:35.840]  you and i thank you and i ask you now the critical juncture of the battle three double your efforts

[1:59:46.320 --> 2:00:02.240]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:00:02.240 --> 2:00:16.560]  info wars tomorrow's news today
[2:00:22.880 --> 2:00:30.720]  this lady veja gade i'm saying that right they're quote chief counsel she tells super wopper lies
[2:00:30.720 --> 2:00:36.080]  that i got kicked off for beating up a kid so what was it ban them so there were three separate
[2:00:36.080 --> 2:00:41.040]  incidents that came to our attention after the fact uh that were reported to us by by different
[2:00:41.040 --> 2:00:46.560]  users uh there was an event was uploaded that showed a child's being violently thrown to the
[2:00:46.560 --> 2:00:50.640]  ground and crying so that was the first one so then i guess the question is what was the video
[2:00:50.640 --> 2:00:55.120]  context of the kid being thrown to the ground was it newsworthy we obviously didn't think so and
[2:00:55.120 --> 2:00:58.880]  depicting violence against a child is not something that we would allow on the platform
[2:00:58.880 --> 2:01:03.760]  even if it's news content um if it was uh there are certain types of situations where if you were
[2:01:03.760 --> 2:01:09.520]  reporting on um you know war zone and things that might be happening we would put a interstitial on
[2:01:09.520 --> 2:01:14.000]  that type of content that's graphic or violent but we didn't feel that that was the context here
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:18.480]  well there's a video that's been going around that was going around a few before five weeks ago
[2:01:18.480 --> 2:01:22.480]  the one where the the girls were yelling at that big giant guy and the guy punched that girl in the
[2:01:22.480 --> 2:01:27.200]  face and she was like 11 years old i saw that multiple times on twitter that was one of the
[2:01:27.200 --> 2:01:32.160]  most violent things i've ever seen it's a giant man punched this 11 year old girl in the face
[2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:37.520]  and that was was that removed from twitter i don't know also that i'm doing all these other
[2:01:37.520 --> 2:01:41.920]  horrible things that i was mean to oliver darcy uh even though he's a public figure and it's in
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:47.840]  public so the third strike um that week we looked at was a verbal altercation that alex got into
[2:01:47.840 --> 2:01:52.960]  with a journalist and in that altercation there were which was uploaded to twitter um there were
[2:01:52.960 --> 2:01:58.400]  a number of statements using eyes of the rat even more evil looking in person he's just scum
[2:01:58.400 --> 2:02:03.040]  you're a virus to america and freedom smelling like a possum that climbed out of the rear end of a
[2:02:03.040 --> 2:02:08.320]  dead cow you look like a possum that got caught doing some really really nasty stuff in my view
[2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:13.680]  so it was a bunch of that's enough really that's hilarious pattern in practice but it was a verbal
[2:02:13.680 --> 2:02:20.000]  altercation that was posted on our box so so so we took the totality of this having been warned
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:24.960]  that we have rules against abuse and harassment of individuals we saw this pattern in practice
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:30.160]  one strike two strike three strikes and we made a decision here are the twitter executives
[2:02:31.200 --> 2:02:37.680]  being fired they don't look too happy now among the three top executives who were reportedly fired
[2:02:37.680 --> 2:02:43.840]  is vijaya gatti who oversaw twitter's policy on misinformation musk has been outspoken against
[2:02:43.840 --> 2:02:50.400]  censorship and a lot of people are saying jones when are you going to challenge elon musk and demand
[2:02:50.400 --> 2:02:55.520]  that you be reinstated to twitter the wheels are coming off the new world order i don't know if elon
[2:02:55.520 --> 2:03:00.400]  musk is the guy we want to piss off are you scared of elon musk or i'm not scared of him no you're
[2:03:00.400 --> 2:03:04.800]  something you're scared of him i'm not scared of him i like the thing is this is not a technological
[2:03:04.800 --> 2:03:10.320]  problem i mean if you have a technological problem what is global warming no i'm talking about
[2:03:10.320 --> 2:03:15.840]  taking over twitter for instance oh okay that this is a problem of politics of sociology
[2:03:16.480 --> 2:03:21.520]  of human psychology i'm not sure that he's necessarily the best one to to address it i mean
[2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:26.400]  his view of twitter he often says it's like the town square that we need to protect the free speech
[2:03:26.400 --> 2:03:33.440]  there but twitter is not the town square i mean tristan harris recently said that twitter is actually
[2:03:33.440 --> 2:03:42.880]  the town's glee view to arena the world population is waking up at record levels and the globalists
[2:03:42.880 --> 2:03:50.000]  are completely and totally absolutely desperate right now but despite the robust protections of
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:54.560]  the first amendment the federal government is making every effort to pressure social media
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:03:59.280]  companies into punishing speech now according to the intercept facebook maintains a special
[2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:04.560]  portal for law enforcement to make requests that content be removed from the platform indeed the
[2:04:04.560 --> 2:04:09.280]  portal exists here they were we were able to find it and requires law enforcement credentials
[2:04:09.280 --> 2:04:14.640]  to access it according to the intercept the fbis laura demlo briefed a cyber security agency
[2:04:14.640 --> 2:04:20.720]  on the spread of misinformation warning that quote we need a media infrastructure that is held
[2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:25.760]  accountable excuse me another dhs report obtained by the intercept explained that its coming
[2:04:25.760 --> 2:04:30.800]  priorities are preventing quote inaccurate information on a wide range of topics including
[2:04:30.800 --> 2:04:36.160]  quote the origins of the coven 19 pandemic the efficacy of coven 19 vaccines racial justice
[2:04:36.160 --> 2:04:41.760]  us withdrawal from afghanistan and the nature of us support to ukraine god gave us all this
[2:04:41.760 --> 2:04:48.000]  technology to use and to build our future but it serves us not them that's a prime rule
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:55.600]  in my rules for how that the future should be run you're an end us
[2:04:58.160 --> 2:05:03.840]  don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you
[2:05:04.800 --> 2:05:09.280]  and the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars because they rightly see us
[2:05:09.280 --> 2:05:14.960]  as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people not as of america but the world for
[2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:20.640]  the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny that's why it's so essential today

[2:07:38.160 --> 2:07:44.400]  midterms five days out that insane speech last night total inversion in my view oh these certain
[2:07:44.400 --> 2:07:48.560]  battlegrounds we won't know who won again and the republicans are going to steal it but if they say
[2:07:48.560 --> 2:07:53.360]  we stole up their terrorist what did you make of that speech last night what's your gut tell you

[2:08:12.480 --> 2:08:17.040]  is before we get into the barack obama clip well we'll do that one first but i'll say this is
[2:08:17.040 --> 2:08:22.240]  it's interesting how right now they're already setting the stage they're already setting the
[2:08:22.240 --> 2:08:26.480]  narrative twitter is coming out with their propaganda right when you open twitter you
[2:08:26.480 --> 2:08:30.320]  may have not seen this on twitter yet or people that are on twitter but i saw it on mine and i
[2:08:30.320 --> 2:08:35.600]  put it on my own twitter right at the top of the page twitter right there saying hey just letting
[2:08:35.600 --> 2:08:41.200]  you know uh come election day it's gonna take a few days to count all the ballots they don't even
[2:08:41.200 --> 2:08:46.560]  say the legal votes right it's gonna take a few days to count all the votes not the legal votes
[2:08:46.560 --> 2:08:52.000]  it's gonna take a few so they're already preparing people joe biden is giving speeches saying the
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:58.560]  same thing preparing the public that it's going to take a few days to count the votes during this
[2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:04.400]  midterm election i mean here we have foreign countries that conduct their elections in one day
[2:09:04.400 --> 2:09:09.200]  and here am i here are we in the united here literally think about it like this alex here are
[2:09:09.200 --> 2:09:16.400]  we in 2022 we are probably as advanced as we've ever been as a country the united states of america
[2:09:16.400 --> 2:09:23.520]  a superpower for now and we cannot conduct an election fairly and securely in a single day
[2:09:24.240 --> 2:09:30.160]  and what you're saying is completely key and central and paramount biden said last night
[2:09:30.160 --> 2:09:35.200]  it's the way we've always done it it always takes days or longer to know who won no that didn't
[2:09:35.200 --> 2:09:40.320]  happen till now back when we had paper ballots the local precinct counts in the 60s and 70s and 80s
[2:09:40.320 --> 2:09:45.040]  everybody combines it we had pretty free elections then now there's these machines and mail-in ballots
[2:09:45.040 --> 2:09:51.040]  now we don't know this is ridiculously obvious since you mentioned it here's biden last night
[2:09:51.040 --> 2:09:56.640]  in his latest declaration of war against america we know that more and more ballots are cast in
[2:09:56.640 --> 2:10:03.680]  early voting or by mail in america we know that many states don't start counting those ballots
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:09.440]  after the polls close on number eight that means in some cases we won't know the winner of the
[2:10:09.440 --> 2:10:16.800]  election for a few days until after few days after the election takes time to count all legitimate
[2:10:16.800 --> 2:10:24.000]  ballots no legal and orderly manner it's always been important for citizens of democracy to be
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:30.880]  informed and engaged now it's important for citizens to be patient as well yep be patient while they
[2:10:30.880 --> 2:10:36.080]  have their roundholds to work dead voters and people out of state and so they can target and use
[2:10:36.080 --> 2:10:41.040]  the pools of fake votes they've got they are running the exact same blueprint of two years ago
[2:10:41.040 --> 2:10:45.840]  how do we stop this or what do you think's about to unfold during and us alex i'll say this is
[2:10:46.400 --> 2:10:51.440]  i mean in the perspective of propaganda right number one the elites they view themselves
[2:10:51.440 --> 2:10:56.880]  as higher more intellectual gods of the universe so these people come out and they say what they're
[2:10:56.880 --> 2:11:02.000]  going to do before they do it preemptively because number one for the sake of propaganda
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:07.120]  because they need to put out this narrative one week ahead of time and at the same time
[2:11:07.760 --> 2:11:14.000]  they're literally jailing the true to vote leaders that were behind the 2000 mules movie
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:19.680]  that exposed their geo tracking what was going on during 2020 oh how convenient they're shutting
[2:11:19.680 --> 2:11:25.280]  them down they're censoring all kinds of people on social media while at the same time simultaneously
[2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:30.880]  simultaneously they're preparing the narrative for people to accept the fact that this upcoming
[2:11:30.880 --> 2:11:37.200]  midterm is going to take days possibly weeks to come to a conclusion why because they need to set
[2:11:37.200 --> 2:11:42.000]  the propaganda they need to set the stage first because there are millions of people in this
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  country not the viewers but these moron woke hard idiots that believe these elites and whatever
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:53.040]  they say is gospel number one that's why they do it number two they do it alex because they know
[2:11:53.040 --> 2:12:00.160]  they can because they view themselves more powerful more greater as a god as if their word is literally
[2:12:00.160 --> 2:12:06.400]  gospel and is the end of all things whatever they say goes in the future i'll say this as well when
[2:12:06.400 --> 2:12:12.080]  i was at uh barack obama's rally last night in phoenix before i told him one thing that i heard
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:18.080]  continually and consistently throughout all the democrat candidates they're making mail-in voting
[2:12:18.080 --> 2:12:23.120]  some kind of trendy thing it's it's kind of cringe but at the same time because their base is so
[2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:27.280]  stupid and low IQ and doesn't think anything through they just believe whatever they say
[2:12:27.280 --> 2:12:31.920]  they've made mail-in voting like some kind of new technological trendy thing
[2:12:31.920 --> 2:12:35.680]  that everyone should just be a part of in doing it it's really weird how they've done that and
[2:12:35.680 --> 2:12:39.760]  let's explain how that and what's what biden said last night that we've always done this no we haven't
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:44.080]  sure absentee that's on record who you are no these are huge pools of votes they can grab and
[2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:50.880]  manipulate they know exactly what they're doing exactly they play on people's laziness they play
[2:12:50.880 --> 2:12:57.760]  on people's uh low IQ because they're naive they don't think these things through and like i said
[2:12:57.760 --> 2:13:04.240]  these people know exactly what they're doing joe biden the democrats all of these people in unison
[2:13:04.240 --> 2:13:08.960]  barack obama all of these leftists that you see that are coming out and saying what they're gonna
[2:13:08.960 --> 2:13:14.480]  do preemptively they're very organized and they know exactly what they're gonna do before they do
[2:13:14.480 --> 2:13:19.840]  it because they know that they can but right now i think listen at the same time why do you think
[2:13:19.840 --> 2:13:24.000]  alex not i know you know the answer to this but why do you think that they're trying to demonize
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:27.440]  that's gonna be the next thing i'm gonna call that out right now it's already starting to happen
[2:13:27.440 --> 2:13:33.920]  the next thing that will be extremely demonized and declared as domestic terrorism okay is going to
[2:13:33.920 --> 2:13:42.080]  be uh mail mailbox uh vote a voter box watching okay ballot box oh yeah multiple states are already
[2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:47.440]  supreme courts are saying you can't have cameras at the at the at the mailboxes exactly that's
[2:13:47.440 --> 2:13:51.920]  going to be the next domestic terrorist they're going to come out and start saying people are
[2:13:51.920 --> 2:13:57.440]  being said we're trying to intimidate people by documenting the fraud exactly again they're
[2:13:57.440 --> 2:14:02.320]  setting the narrative because it's going to become a mainstream narrative right now they say they say
[2:14:02.320 --> 2:14:06.960]  things here and there they kind of test it out they try it on the public they get all the stupid
[2:14:06.960 --> 2:14:12.640]  people and the mindless lemmings to believe this stuff and i'm telling you it will be full force
[2:14:12.640 --> 2:14:17.600]  that this will become a thing you know anybody that actually videotapes the fraud will be jailed
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:24.800]  jailed indicted canceled targeted by the fbi targeted by the three-letter agencies
[2:14:25.440 --> 2:14:31.440]  declared a domestic terrorist this is what they'll say to a threat to democracy right being an
[2:14:31.440 --> 2:14:35.440]  individual that care and it doesn't matter whether you're on the right or the left this is what the
[2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:40.960]  left doesn't understand if you care about your voter process and you show up watching a ballot
[2:14:40.960 --> 2:14:45.680]  box throughout the night they'll come after you and accuse you of being a domestic terrorist
[2:14:45.680 --> 2:14:50.960]  and a threat to democracy this is what the left doesn't get it's not about left or right it's about
[2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:56.320]  the regime at the top that wants to control all of us because these globalists and satanists are
[2:14:56.320 --> 2:15:02.400]  real and they want to control elections because they want to control the people we have no democracy
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:07.680]  they're always talking about democracy alex democracy democracy democracy okay well what about

[2:20:03.440 --> 2:20:20.080]  on the heels of oh biden's speech five weeks ago his hit larry and darth vader's speech
[2:20:20.080 --> 2:20:27.440]  or red background to turn war on his political enemies he now gave another speech last night
[2:20:27.440 --> 2:20:30.720]  and said the republicans are trying to steal the election but they're horrible criminals
[2:20:30.720 --> 2:20:36.640]  and they say we try to steal it that doesn't exist total oxymoron oxymoronic gaslighting
[2:20:38.400 --> 2:20:42.000]  and it was all about they're about to be violent they're about to attack they're about to do all
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:47.040]  this with no evidence in the whole weird Pelosi case gut level looking at this drew her nanda as
[2:20:47.040 --> 2:20:51.760]  the investigative journalist what do you think they're getting ready to pull because for me that
[2:20:51.760 --> 2:20:56.720]  was a big tell of where they're going he said don't question what we're about to do with the
[2:20:56.720 --> 2:21:02.240]  election what do you think they're about to pull or or or are they out of bullets what i mean
[2:21:02.240 --> 2:21:08.720]  what is going to happen i think it's a continual uh controlled demolition from within of our
[2:21:08.720 --> 2:21:15.760]  society and the number one thing that takes down a society uh democracy or a constitutional
[2:21:15.760 --> 2:21:22.880]  republic or any functioning uh you know group of people on planet earth is a voting process
[2:21:22.880 --> 2:21:28.080]  when you take that away that is the voice of the people and when you begin to sabotage that
[2:21:28.080 --> 2:21:34.320]  that is taking away the voice of the people so these people know that they're far far advanced
[2:21:34.320 --> 2:21:38.800]  enough to understand that this is how it works in foreign countries that are communist that are
[2:21:38.800 --> 2:21:44.400]  globalist that are socialist they know that the only way to truly take away power from the people
[2:21:44.960 --> 2:21:52.000]  is to take away their vote and also to take away their voice that's why censorship and election
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:58.880]  meddling and fraud and tampering go hand in hand for a totalitarian regime because those two things
[2:21:59.440 --> 2:22:05.920]  need to be functioning simultaneously in order to have a healthy society or a healthy group of
[2:22:05.920 --> 2:22:11.680]  people here on planet earth these globalists these people they know this because they're all energized
[2:22:11.680 --> 2:22:19.920]  by satan and lucifer what i mean by that is lucifer satan has been around longer than us for a very
[2:22:19.920 --> 2:22:26.720]  long time has studied human behavior for thousands of years has studied how to manipulate the human
[2:22:26.720 --> 2:22:33.040]  mind has studied how to manipulate human emotion has studied how to manipulate societies to do his
[2:22:33.040 --> 2:22:39.040]  bidding to get into the palm of his hand and to get human beings possessed to do what he wants
[2:22:39.040 --> 2:22:45.600]  so this is why we see the same reoccurring agenda this anti christ globalist agenda that suppresses
[2:22:45.600 --> 2:22:49.840]  the people that's totalitarian whether it's communist whether it's fascist whether it's
[2:22:49.840 --> 2:22:54.720]  socialist whether it's globalist it's the same thing same spirit that has been going on for
[2:22:54.720 --> 2:23:00.800]  thousands of years and they're successful because people do not learn from history and they do not
[2:23:00.800 --> 2:23:05.120]  learn from the mistakes of the past and they don't speak up and they're not willing to make
[2:23:05.120 --> 2:23:10.720]  sacrifices that are necessary to protect those god-given rights what's happening right now is
[2:23:10.720 --> 2:23:17.120]  i'll say this okay people want a solution you got to continue to move forward speak out for what is
[2:23:17.120 --> 2:23:22.960]  right get canceled as much as you possibly can get censored as much as you possibly can show up to
[2:23:22.960 --> 2:23:28.640]  a political event be peaceful let these people just look psychotic and go after you so that the world
[2:23:28.640 --> 2:23:36.000]  can see because when persecution comes alex when persecution comes it has a effect and one of those
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:43.440]  effects is the watchers and the viewers that see that happening to an individual they wake up they
[2:23:43.440 --> 2:23:49.440]  wake up to the reality that something nefarious and evil is taking place the more that that continues
[2:23:49.440 --> 2:23:54.800]  to happen in this country the more that more people are going to wake up that's one way that's one
[2:23:54.800 --> 2:24:01.600]  way to wake up the public that may still be able to wake up right now here in 2022 but i think right
[2:24:01.600 --> 2:24:06.880]  now what we need to continue to do is we need to humiliate these people we need to put a flashlight
[2:24:06.880 --> 2:24:12.880]  on these people and again i go back to what i said on the last segment rhinos people that are not
[2:24:12.880 --> 2:24:19.520]  willing to expose who these people are and go on the offense legislatively okay because we have some
[2:24:19.520 --> 2:24:24.560]  genuine cases there are democrats and right wingers right now that are rhinos that should be in jail
[2:24:24.560 --> 2:24:31.440]  alex you know this you know this we have genuine evidence on hunter biden joe biden the biden
[2:24:31.440 --> 2:24:37.120]  crime family we have genuine evidence that the fbi should be going after that the cia knows what's
[2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:42.160]  going on and the right wingers are not doing anything these so-called legislators these
[2:24:42.160 --> 2:24:48.560]  this is what i'm saying i'm proposing after 2022 if we do have a majority in the senate or the congress
[2:24:48.560 --> 2:24:55.440]  by god's grace and by some miracle i need to see we need to see conservatives and republicans that
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:25:02.480]  claim to be america first going on the offense and going after people genuinely legislatively
[2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:08.720]  that deserve to be prosecuted and indicted they're going after you they're going after steve bannon
[2:25:08.720 --> 2:25:12.800]  they're going after all of their political opponents i'm not saying we should do the same
[2:25:12.800 --> 2:25:19.040]  over lies i'm saying that we should do the same over genuine cases that should be prosecuted
[2:25:19.040 --> 2:25:22.720]  that is why the deep state is powerful because that is hard to debunk but i think right now
[2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:27.200]  we have an opportunity if by god's grace we get some legislators that can change this stuff
[2:25:27.200 --> 2:25:30.880]  but they need to start acting immediately and go on the offense because that's what the people want
[2:25:31.520 --> 2:25:36.240]  absolutely brother absolutely i want to take some calls that we all over the map but i know
[2:25:36.240 --> 2:25:40.960]  you're well versed guys smart guys you give your take as well when i do but we got four minutes or
[2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:48.320]  so to break the globalists are losing the hearts and minds all over the world not just here but
[2:25:48.320 --> 2:25:53.520]  there was already an election fraud when we look at lula and balsam arrow it's the same story again
[2:25:54.240 --> 2:25:58.320]  if it wasn't fraud i'd say man they're dumb in brazil but they're not only in one capital
[2:25:58.320 --> 2:26:00.880]  district that they suddenly have all this magic vote that defeated him
[2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:08.240]  how do you see a power structure striking back when there's such an awakening happening
[2:26:10.320 --> 2:26:14.640]  well i think what they're going to do is they have to double down right i mean you take a
[2:26:14.640 --> 2:26:20.800]  look at history what do they do what do the fascists do what do the communists do they double down
[2:26:20.800 --> 2:26:26.720]  they triple down they quadruple down because what is this all about alex you and i both know
[2:26:27.440 --> 2:26:34.320]  that the core issue for these people is not democracy it's not freedom it's not inclusivity
[2:26:34.320 --> 2:26:41.920]  it's not it's not diversity it's not wanting people to be able to participate in our constitutional
[2:26:41.920 --> 2:26:48.640]  republic or electoral process that's not what these people want they want one thing power and
[2:26:48.640 --> 2:26:57.840]  control over your mind your life your existence your bank account your family your future your all
[2:26:57.840 --> 2:27:06.880]  and all these people this is why they're anti christ they want to be god the devil wants to be god
[2:27:06.880 --> 2:27:13.680]  and worshiped as god and that is who these people are that is why they think they can dictate your
[2:27:13.680 --> 2:27:19.440]  speech they can dictate your bank account they can dictate your vote that is why they believe
[2:27:19.440 --> 2:27:27.280]  they can dictate your mind because they believe that they are superior and god like enough to do
[2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:33.120]  so and that they are the ones that know better than you that can think better than you that could
[2:27:33.120 --> 2:27:38.480]  literally function better than you when it comes to every aspect of your life so what i expect from
[2:27:38.480 --> 2:27:46.160]  these people alex is for them to double triple and quadruple down because this is about power this is
[2:27:46.160 --> 2:27:51.840]  about control and they will not let that go they will not let that go without a political fight
[2:27:51.840 --> 2:27:57.760]  they will not let that go they will give their dying breath to hold on to this because these people
[2:27:57.760 --> 2:28:04.320]  hate you they want to control you and they don't want to let you go they're psychopaths in power
[2:28:04.320 --> 2:28:09.280]  and this is exactly why we're seeing what we're seeing so i predict that these people yes they are
[2:28:09.280 --> 2:28:14.400]  losing but they will double down because they don't want to let you go they're psychotics alex you
[2:28:14.400 --> 2:28:18.240]  know this we're gonna break and come right back with calls i'm gonna ask you about the huge intercept
[2:28:18.240 --> 2:28:23.920]  article that broke over the weekend which they're not denying it's it's all real worse than we thought
[2:28:23.920 --> 2:28:28.960]  homeland security with the adl southern probably lost another leftist group including chase bank
[2:28:29.600 --> 2:28:33.600]  surveilling and watching people with big tech and censoring them and the government admits the
[2:28:33.600 --> 2:28:39.520]  documents it's illegal and they're using private groups to do it i'm at two by the way steal the
[2:28:39.520 --> 2:28:44.640]  election from trump and now the midterms i mean election meddling criminal activity right there

[2:33:58.640 --> 2:34:02.880]  colorado authorities investigating suspicious substance found in mail-in ballots officials
[2:34:02.880 --> 2:34:08.080]  say it appears to be an attempt to disrupt the election process authorities in colorado investigating
[2:34:08.080 --> 2:34:13.840]  any suspicious powder substance found in a mail-in ballot to the adams county elections office and
[2:34:13.840 --> 2:34:18.880]  what they say has meant unit paramedics and firefighters and other law enforcement agencies
[2:34:18.880 --> 2:34:23.280]  were called to the county offices after the ballot was received wednesday the initial
[2:34:23.280 --> 2:34:26.960]  testing of the substance was negative for explosives biological agents and narcotics
[2:34:26.960 --> 2:34:31.520]  adams county clerk said so we're gonna have lots of that and then give you another example of fake
[2:34:31.520 --> 2:34:40.240]  news in live time i said at the start of the show a few hours ago that the democratic party
[2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:45.360]  that ran their show trial hoaxes against me told us in mediation we just want you to come up against
[2:34:45.360 --> 2:34:50.960]  the second amendment and i said hell no and i said you guys you do democratic party could

[2:34:54.320 --> 2:34:58.480]  you name it or i'm not going to be pro-abortion you can't give me a change of mind they run the
[2:34:58.480 --> 2:35:05.120]  headline alex jones sandy hook families and say that then the quote could put a gun to my head
[2:35:05.120 --> 2:35:11.360]  and i wouldn't back down one inch that's how deceptive these people are folks using these
[2:35:11.360 --> 2:35:18.080]  families to go up the first and second amendment let's go to phone calls right now we'll talk to
[2:35:18.080 --> 2:35:23.520]  chris at a moment the first david in florida an army vet was talking about the midterms the sanis

[2:35:37.920 --> 2:35:44.320]  exerting upon our country so god bless you sir i just wanted to say that i'm a proud florida
[2:35:44.320 --> 2:35:50.640]  nata florida love disantis um by the way i have the water filter air filter i've got pretty much
[2:35:50.640 --> 2:35:55.680]  everything in for worse stuff thank you ultimate curl oil is like on another level if you take
[2:35:55.680 --> 2:35:59.760]  that before bedtime about an hour before bedtime it's like you take an intergalactic trip and
[2:35:59.760 --> 2:36:06.160]  never leave the farm it's great stuff i just wanted to say this is a just topic that people
[2:36:06.160 --> 2:36:11.360]  don't really talk about discuss of course i think to see this is going to take it and rightfully
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:17.440]  say the fantastic governor uh and i'm a big time trump supporter i sat six feet from the president
[2:36:17.440 --> 2:36:22.240]  when he came to the tamper rally here but i just want to say this is a subject that nobody talks
[2:36:22.240 --> 2:36:27.920]  about this is what happened to me as a disabled veteran uh in a patriot a conservative patriot i
[2:36:27.920 --> 2:36:33.040]  speak out a lot i've been banned off facebook i've been banned from everywhere um finally got facebook
[2:36:33.040 --> 2:36:37.920]  back but you know how that is they watch everything i do or say i put anything on about info or you
[2:36:37.920 --> 2:36:41.600]  know they automatically kick me off but i still do it anyway make another account do it again
[2:36:41.600 --> 2:36:46.640]  but what you do is you just link to other people promoting it yeah roger that sir yeah but the thing
[2:36:46.640 --> 2:36:53.280]  is they uh the left the leftover operators from obama derail the trump organization and now the
[2:36:53.280 --> 2:36:58.400]  leftover communist laws are derailing the sanctis efforts for a free florida here the florida
[2:36:58.400 --> 2:37:04.400]  department of revenue and child support enforcement are completely out of control they suspend your
[2:37:04.400 --> 2:37:09.680]  driver's license business licenses fishing and hunting licenses making it nearly impossible
[2:37:09.680 --> 2:37:15.600]  for a non-custodial parent to make a living here to support yourself and your children uh no one
[2:37:15.600 --> 2:37:21.920]  wants to talk about this and i think something that the de santis ron if you're listening uh i think
[2:37:21.920 --> 2:37:26.240]  it's something that he needs to look into or do something about because i think that would bring
[2:37:26.240 --> 2:37:31.200]  a lot of people under his tent that wouldn't normally be there because dude this is it's not
[2:37:31.200 --> 2:37:37.840]  the sanctis's fault this is some leftover archaic communist laws that they've had in place 31 states
[2:37:37.840 --> 2:37:42.880]  in the united states make it illegal to take away a man's driver's license because it negates your
[2:37:42.880 --> 2:37:46.560]  ability to make a living i mean especially when you live in a rural community that's right even
[2:37:46.560 --> 2:37:51.040]  the old days when you got released from prison uh in the west in places they give you your gun and
[2:37:51.040 --> 2:37:57.680]  horseback so or or horses have had to eat your horse that's how they fed the prisoners and absolutely
[2:37:57.680 --> 2:38:02.800]  the the the systems they've set up with the attorney generals to the states where child
[2:38:02.800 --> 2:38:08.720]  support is draconian extrajudicial and has no due process it should absolutely be uh be fixed there's
[2:38:08.720 --> 2:38:14.400]  a lot of work to do thanks for the call you want to comment on that drunandus yeah real quick alex
[2:38:14.400 --> 2:38:19.280]  i just think it's clear again it goes back to these people targeting your livelihood if they
[2:38:19.280 --> 2:38:24.560]  could grab you by the balls there if they could shut down your ability to live uh they will control
[2:38:24.560 --> 2:38:28.880]  you if they could control your bank account they could control uh the food you put on your table
[2:38:28.880 --> 2:38:32.720]  if they could control the water that you drink if they could control every aspect of your life
[2:38:32.720 --> 2:38:38.480]  financially they will have that over you that is why paypal is coming out and is going to start
[2:38:38.480 --> 2:38:43.280]  finding everybody first they backed off now they've gone back to it they're going to find you $2,500
[2:38:43.280 --> 2:38:47.680]  if uh we have a political disagreement with you and again it's always the same thing we determine
[2:38:47.680 --> 2:38:52.320]  what that really means so it's across the board this is why they're pushing for a centralized system
[2:38:52.320 --> 2:38:56.560]  because it would be easier to just control everyone at the push of a button that's why
[2:38:56.560 --> 2:39:01.680]  they want arbitrary extrajudicial power chris and pencil van here on the air with drunandus
[2:39:01.680 --> 2:39:07.680]  next segment his latest confrontations go ahead hey how you doing good brother hey i'm big fan
[2:39:07.680 --> 2:39:13.680]  i've been listening to you every day for like 12 years drew love your work i think that earlier
[2:39:13.680 --> 2:39:18.960]  when you were talking about the mail-in voting and the the deaths and the people that move i think
[2:39:18.960 --> 2:39:25.280]  we might be working in the wrong place like i think they want us to look there if it were me
[2:39:25.280 --> 2:39:31.120]  it takes a few days to count the mail-in ballots because they're probably sending in ballots for
[2:39:31.120 --> 2:39:37.680]  the voters who never actually voted so there could be like 10 to 15 percent of people who never
[2:39:37.680 --> 2:39:42.560]  actually physically voted and they're not even aware that a mail-in ballot went in oh no that's
[2:39:42.560 --> 2:39:46.880]  exactly how it works they just hold them and then fill them out for the number they need no that's
[2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:52.080]  exactly what that's the same formula right so we got to find a way to stop them we got to find a
[2:39:52.080 --> 2:39:57.040]  way to have a check some balances and no like oh this person didn't vote but he's got a mail-in
[2:39:57.040 --> 2:40:04.880]  ballot like and by the way people say oh where's the proof in pennsylvania they had a post delivery
[2:40:04.880 --> 2:40:09.760]  driver that thought it was suspicious across state lines they put like 20 something boxes and he
[2:40:09.760 --> 2:40:16.400]  looked in them they were all marked for biden he calls the fbi they threatened to arrest him i mean
[2:40:16.400 --> 2:40:23.840]  so we've caught them doing it we know what they're doing so moving forward if two things if they were
[2:40:23.840 --> 2:40:28.880]  to allow the right to win i don't think that's gonna happen i think the ball is rolling i if they were
[2:40:28.880 --> 2:40:35.680]  to allow the right win i'd be highly worried about uh like dark horses on the right and i think the
[2:40:35.680 --> 2:40:40.880]  real quick and anti-plosive thing to me is kind of worrisome because if they do take this election
[2:40:40.880 --> 2:40:46.720]  and they do steal it and they start removing the politicians that were involved they're gonna
[2:40:46.720 --> 2:40:53.280]  blame it on us you follow me i mean brother they're gonna pull every dirty trick they've got the good
[2:40:53.280 --> 2:40:57.920]  news is almost no one buys what they say now so that really disempowers them but that only makes
[2:40:57.920 --> 2:41:02.400]  them again intensify because it's not it's like a heroin addict takes more and more and more to get
[2:41:02.400 --> 2:41:07.520]  high will they kill the whole bolly politic in the process thanks for the call chris kubernetes
[2:41:08.880 --> 2:41:13.200]  i totally agree like i said i think they're gonna double down triple down quadruple down
[2:41:13.200 --> 2:41:19.280]  they'll use every avenue possible uh to hold power and violate our freedoms so i totally agree with
[2:41:19.280 --> 2:41:22.800]  that there's all kinds of avenues we got to deal with the machines we got to deal with
[2:41:22.800 --> 2:41:28.080]  trucks nefarious league on crossing state lines just dropping off ballots there's so much that
[2:41:28.080 --> 2:41:32.800]  needs to take place and that's why i've been saying some serious legislation needs to be done
[2:41:32.800 --> 2:41:37.600]  at the federal level at the local level as well and if by some miracle we make it through this
[2:41:37.600 --> 2:41:43.200]  election and we make it like i said a lot a lot of electoral process legislation needs to take
[2:41:43.200 --> 2:41:47.520]  place to fix this stuff our elections are a mess right now alex well absolutely and like i don't
[2:41:47.520 --> 2:41:54.480]  want to be alarmist here but we're in a crazy world uh that speech last night said false flag
[2:41:54.480 --> 2:41:58.880]  flag and they're in deep trouble they'll do anything and as you mentioned and as i mentioned
[2:41:59.440 --> 2:42:03.760]  that famous truck that came across you're obviously not in a truck full of ballots all
[2:42:03.760 --> 2:42:08.560]  filled out for biden another state that's a fraud that's the holy grail but it just gets shut down
[2:42:10.080 --> 2:42:15.680]  well here's been the number one thing when it came to this 2020 election the number one red
[2:42:15.680 --> 2:42:21.920]  flag yes all the stuff that came out in all of these states all of it that was being exposed
[2:42:21.920 --> 2:42:27.280]  all of the videos all of the hearings all of that the number one thing that stuck out to the me the
[2:42:27.280 --> 2:42:34.000]  most was how aggressively the left attempted to silence it and shut it down that alone let me
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:38.720]  know that there's something nefarious going on because if there wasn't then why can't i look
[2:42:38.720 --> 2:42:41.840]  into it i think that tells you everything you need to know about that's right i want to show
[2:42:41.840 --> 2:42:46.720]  your latest confrontation last night with obama the one last week with super viral aoc and more
[2:42:46.720 --> 2:42:52.640]  if we final call drew her nanda's then jason bermas always does a great job he's got a big
[2:42:52.640 --> 2:43:00.320]  presentation for you next hour don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions

[2:48:24.080 --> 2:48:28.320]  shows real hunger for folks who go out and confront them and democrats have been confronting the
[2:48:28.320 --> 2:48:32.560]  warmongering democrats those have been going viral as well they're really fearful of this
[2:48:32.560 --> 2:48:37.520]  every time obama gets confronted he goes hey you got your free speech really you censor us online
[2:48:37.520 --> 2:48:42.640]  you spy on us with homeland security you work with big tech no you've been silent and says
[2:48:42.640 --> 2:48:48.000]  there's nothing more american than confronting that little globalist the term free speech is
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:52.480]  an illusion with these people and we all know that let's run that obama clip i want to rip
[2:48:52.480 --> 2:48:58.160]  into this guy real quick yeah rolly obama clip it's very good for folks at the very top but
[2:48:58.160 --> 2:49:04.240]  not always so good for ordinary people like you obama why do you communities where too many
[2:49:04.240 --> 2:49:15.360]  kids are you going to start are you going to start you know you you have to be polite and
[2:49:15.360 --> 2:49:22.800]  civil when people are talking then other people are talking and then you you get a chance to talk
[2:49:22.800 --> 2:49:46.720]  katey hox discriminates against black people katey hox discriminates against black people
[2:49:46.720 --> 2:49:53.760]  katey hox discriminates against black people katey hox discriminates and more people do this
[2:49:53.760 --> 2:50:00.160]  it's game over for them just like we did six years ago with hillary and urhan and as is the
[2:50:00.160 --> 2:50:06.960]  chain reaction here we go here we go we can't talk about katey hox we can't talk about katey hox
[2:50:06.960 --> 2:50:11.920]  you want to be taken we can't talk about katey hox hey how's the building but if you put your
[2:50:11.920 --> 2:50:16.800]  hands the trumpets hands on somebody oh my god it's actually there's urhan and as like i said
[2:50:16.800 --> 2:50:21.120]  alex i learned from the best man i'm not the one that you know first started doing that i grew up
[2:50:21.120 --> 2:50:25.440]  watching info wars and alex jones we're just continuing the legacy that's why we need you and
[2:50:25.440 --> 2:50:30.960]  that's why they want to shut you down because uh you influence people to engage and go on offense
[2:50:30.960 --> 2:50:35.040]  that's what these people hate as long as you're always on defense you're okay because if they're
[2:50:35.040 --> 2:50:39.760]  always on offense they know they could beat you because they control the levers of power but obama
[2:50:39.760 --> 2:50:48.800]  obama is a disgrace okay i know for a a ton of reasons but i'll pick this one obama is a disgrace
[2:50:48.800 --> 2:50:55.840]  to minorities across the entire globe he's the token black guy of the democrat party because he
[2:50:55.840 --> 2:51:01.520]  thinks in his superiority that he's the first black president of the united states of america some
[2:51:01.520 --> 2:51:07.760]  kind of superstar no you were installed there barry because you're on the plantation of the
[2:51:07.760 --> 2:51:12.560]  democrat party and you wouldn't be there if it weren't for them and they control everything you
[2:51:12.560 --> 2:51:18.000]  say and everything you do you are their puppet because the democrats have always controlled black
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:24.160]  people up until this very day drew why do you say that do you really believe that look what he's doing
[2:51:24.720 --> 2:51:32.800]  he's campaigning as a black man for a convicted twice convicted racist katie hobs that had to pay
[2:51:32.800 --> 2:51:38.160]  out millions of dollars this by state-funded taxpayer money because she discriminated against a
[2:51:38.160 --> 2:51:44.960]  black woman and that we all in arizona have to pay for it and there's barack obama on that damn
[2:51:44.960 --> 2:51:51.360]  stage campaigning for the white woman that discriminates against black people and he doesn't
[2:51:51.360 --> 2:51:56.560]  say a damn thing about it and notice he's only got a few thousand people they claim he's so popular
[2:51:56.560 --> 2:52:04.000]  from scott crowds 50 times bigger absolutely but the point is alex even barack obama is on the
[2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:10.800]  democrat plantation campaigning for the white racists in their party how do i know because
[2:52:10.800 --> 2:52:16.800]  he's up there and he doesn't acknowledge it and doesn't tell any of those black people in that room
[2:52:16.800 --> 2:52:24.160]  the truth of who katie hobs is why because he's a puppet and he is literally their token black guy
[2:52:24.160 --> 2:52:30.880]  and he's controlled by them obama is a disgrace and more black people need to wake up to the reality
[2:52:30.880 --> 2:52:37.200]  that even he the former president of the united states with black skin color is controlled by
[2:52:37.200 --> 2:52:42.320]  these racist democrats and he's not willing to tell them the truth well there's no doubt about
[2:52:42.320 --> 2:52:46.640]  that let's shift gears into your it shows how desperate they are rolling them out though
[2:52:46.640 --> 2:52:51.360]  tell us about the aoc clip the one super viral it's the same thing do we have that do you guys
[2:52:51.360 --> 2:52:56.880]  want to air that real good we do let me tell us where it was set the sub force is on twitter i was
[2:52:56.880 --> 2:53:02.880]  in california she was speaking at a university uh with a bunch of leftist morons and trying to
[2:53:02.880 --> 2:53:10.400]  virtue signal and just lie to the people here's the club what about the migrants what about the
[2:53:10.400 --> 2:53:27.200]  migrants aoc what about the little kids being raped at the southern border what about the migrants aoc
[2:53:27.200 --> 2:53:38.640]  what about the open border denounced joe biden denounced the human struggle in chief bring out
[2:53:38.640 --> 2:53:44.640]  the they'll keep them right at the southern border aoc and see
[2:53:56.080 --> 2:54:03.760]  the blood is on your hands aoc the blood is on your hands aoc the blood is on your hands aoc
[2:54:03.760 --> 2:54:09.120]  there's your phone along now i mean drew this is an important clip and i think it went super viral
[2:54:09.120 --> 2:54:12.880]  because people want to do more of this they should go out do it themselves but that's not one of your
[2:54:12.880 --> 2:54:20.160]  most powerful clips why do you think you got 50 million views i think because right now aoc is
[2:54:20.160 --> 2:54:25.680]  a race grifter and we know that just like a bunch of other democrats but but in particularly okay in
[2:54:25.680 --> 2:54:31.680]  the latino community you have someone like aoc that's coming out claiming to care so much crying at
[2:54:31.680 --> 2:54:36.880]  the southern border staging a photo op and a video op pretending to care about migrants that are
[2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:42.800]  locked in gauges where the hell is she now where are you why are you not down at the southern border
[2:54:42.800 --> 2:54:48.000]  acknowledging the crimes against humanity that you and i have both exposed alex and we got demonized
[2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:54.000]  for doing because we're exposing the the literal human slavery and human trafficking of latinos
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:59.520]  at the southern border that's being facilitated by democrats she's not down there because she
[2:54:59.520 --> 2:55:04.400]  doesn't give a damn she's not down there staging a photo op because it's not politically acceptable
[2:55:04.400 --> 2:55:11.360]  because it doesn't make trump look bad these people do not give a damn about latinos black people
[2:55:11.360 --> 2:55:18.400]  white people humans in general they hate everybody they only use you and view you as a political pawn
[2:55:18.400 --> 2:55:24.880]  that is why so many people view clips like that and they love watching these people get roasted
[2:55:24.880 --> 2:55:31.280]  and obliterated and write for their hypocrisy you're right let's play a clip of the pathetic
[2:55:31.280 --> 2:55:37.360]  actress ann hathaway saying abortion can be another word for mercy killing babies is good
[2:55:37.360 --> 2:55:43.360]  and merciful to them this is how much they hate life here it is this is not a moral conversation
[2:55:43.360 --> 2:55:49.280]  about abortion right this is a practical conversation about women's rights and by the way human rights
[2:55:49.280 --> 2:55:55.120]  because women's rights are human rights and the freedom that we all need to be able to to choose
[2:55:55.120 --> 2:56:03.040]  and build our lives and have access to excellent health care imagine one other thing and just
[2:56:03.040 --> 2:56:07.920]  without going to too many details my own personal experience with abortion and i don't think we talk
[2:56:07.920 --> 2:56:13.840]  about this enough abortion can be another word for mercy we don't know we don't know it's not a
[2:56:13.840 --> 2:56:18.480]  world in which we know that no two pregnancies are alike and it follows that no two lives are like
[2:56:18.480 --> 2:56:25.440]  that follows that no two conceptions are alike so how can we have a law how can we have a point
[2:56:25.440 --> 2:56:30.880]  of view on this that says we must treat everything the same and where i'm the most selfish when you
[2:56:30.880 --> 2:56:40.000]  allow for choice greedy evil people we've ever seen it's totally sick drew human rights for women
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:45.440]  and abortion if you don't even give them the chance to even be born and have a shot at life
[2:56:45.440 --> 2:56:53.520]  all these woke women do is repeat the Margaret Sanger eugenicist literal depot depopulation
[2:56:53.520 --> 2:57:01.360]  okay agenda narrative that if a baby is not gonna be able to be financially successful in life then
[2:57:01.360 --> 2:57:06.320]  you just gotta kill it you just gotta end its life just decided your whole life they've just
[2:57:06.320 --> 2:57:12.080]  given you a death sentence for nothing because they believe that they are god that is viewers
[2:57:12.080 --> 2:57:15.440]  and listeners don't let the globalists give our children a death sentence don't let them give free
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:19.840]  speech death sentence don't let them give america a death sentence support and share the articles

[3:00:25.920 --> 3:00:32.720]  in the last five minutes the other key pieces of intel i just think america needs to understand
[3:00:33.440 --> 3:00:39.360]  we are in a very very dark hour in american history where our freedoms are being attacked
[3:00:39.360 --> 3:00:47.280]  with speech with the elections the second event our children and their innocence we're murdering
[3:00:47.280 --> 3:00:53.280]  babies millions of people in this country they not only advocate for it they celebrate it they
[3:00:53.280 --> 3:00:57.840]  praise it they worship mohawk they worship bathroom it that is literally what the trans
[3:00:59.040 --> 3:01:04.960]  movement is that is going after children right now satan is working overtime and people need
[3:01:04.960 --> 3:01:10.400]  to understand that this is not just political issues especially even the church and pastors if
[3:01:10.400 --> 3:01:14.480]  if you're around people right now that are just kind of like wanting to sit on the sidelines and say
[3:01:14.480 --> 3:01:18.400]  oh you know i just think i don't want to get political i don't want to get involved with that
[3:01:18.400 --> 3:01:23.520]  well well these people expect you to be like that because they know that that's where they need you
[3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:28.640]  to be so you're ineffective and you're a sitting duck and you don't become a problem that is what
[3:01:28.640 --> 3:01:34.800]  these regimes want they don't want problems and problems to these people are people that come
[3:01:34.800 --> 3:01:40.480]  out speak out and they expose certain things that is why they go after everyone in the movement
[3:01:41.120 --> 3:01:47.600]  that is why they go after everyone in america anyone on the globe that is simply effective
[3:01:47.600 --> 3:01:54.320]  and that causes problems and breaches the matrix and who these people are like alex jones info wars
[3:01:54.320 --> 3:01:59.760]  the the list goes on right now in 2022 that is why they want to shut down info wars that is why
[3:01:59.760 --> 3:02:04.320]  they want to shut down alex jones because they know here we are with upcoming elections and how
[3:02:04.320 --> 3:02:10.800]  effective this network has been they need to shut it down and they need to shut down anyone else
[3:02:10.800 --> 3:02:15.360]  that has an effective voice this is why they will continue to shadow ban this is why they will
[3:02:15.360 --> 3:02:21.040]  continue to propagate and demonize slander and attempts to cancel anyone that comes out and
[3:02:21.040 --> 3:02:26.480]  speaks out against this regime because they need to control every single one of you right now do
[3:02:26.480 --> 3:02:32.720]  not be afraid do not be scared do not lose hope do not lose energy do not lose strength and i'm
[3:02:32.720 --> 3:02:37.920]  speaking to you too as well alex i look up to you man a lot of people do i know it gets hard i know
[3:02:37.920 --> 3:02:43.280]  you're losing a lot of uh you know uh strength to move forward but if god is for us who could be
[3:02:43.280 --> 3:02:49.280]  against us right now more than ever this is where we push forward this is where we get louder this
[3:02:49.280 --> 3:02:55.840]  is where we get stronger and this is where we get more unified as a people because we will not go
[3:02:55.840 --> 3:03:02.400]  down without letting these people know that they cannot take away our spirit they cannot take away
[3:03:02.400 --> 3:03:09.120]  our freedom even if they kill us i'm not calling for violence they cannot take away our spirit
[3:03:09.120 --> 3:03:14.000]  and our freedom and that is what they want alex and they will never take that away no matter
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:18.720]  how much money you get sued for no matter how many times they cancel us no matter how many
[3:03:18.720 --> 3:03:25.520]  times they censor us they will never take that away and that is the one thing that they wish they
[3:03:25.520 --> 3:03:31.920]  could let me let me expand on that why frankly people see them put out numbers like 2.75 trillion
[3:03:31.920 --> 3:03:37.120]  and a billion to intimidate spaces feel like we've lost i'm getting more support on the ground
[3:03:37.120 --> 3:03:41.520]  and more people saying that we were right than ever uh when it comes to finances we're barely on the
[3:03:41.520 --> 3:03:45.440]  edge of being able to operate that's what the listeners support us at info or short.com but
[3:03:46.160 --> 3:03:50.960]  i'm i'm actually the happiest i've ever been uh i'm a little burned out a little tired i'm really
[3:03:50.960 --> 3:03:55.680]  tired of focusing on the globalist but i know i have to do it uh to stop them but it's really
[3:03:55.680 --> 3:04:01.760]  paradoxical or it's newtonian physics the worse it gets the better it gets as as as as people
[3:04:01.760 --> 3:04:05.920]  really wake up but i appreciate your spirit and and what you're doing what you see and just in
[3:04:05.920 --> 3:04:09.680]  closing in 30 seconds what are you seeing on the ground in america is there an awakening or what's
[3:04:09.680 --> 3:04:15.280]  happening i think we're gonna see both i think the more that the pressure comes down more people
[3:04:15.280 --> 3:04:19.760]  wake up to the reality that these people are coming after their children their bank accounts and their
[3:04:19.760 --> 3:04:26.000]  entire livelihood their freedoms you can only do one thing but wake up yeah you could join the regime
[3:04:26.000 --> 3:04:30.800]  but we see how history turns out they end up turning on you so at some point a lot of people
[3:04:30.800 --> 3:04:33.920]  are going to continue to wake up and that's the hope that i have in the prayer that i have every
[3:04:33.920 --> 3:04:38.160]  single day drew age live dot com amazing job to her nana's look forward to speaking to you
[3:04:38.160 --> 3:04:42.880]  please join us during tuesday's live coverage we're gonna go till past midnight of the election

[3:06:10.720 --> 3:06:19.280]  and what i really wanted to do here was delve a lot deeper into this whole collusion with big tech
[3:06:19.840 --> 3:06:24.480]  and the biden administration and show that this isn't just the biden administration this has been
[3:06:24.480 --> 3:06:32.560]  something that's been running for 20 plus years that we know about that's aside from programs like
[3:06:32.560 --> 3:06:39.600]  the cia's mockingbird within the media but big tech companies and that's really what social media is
[3:06:39.600 --> 3:06:47.600]  now it's emerging of these big tech communication companies and the media all right so you have
[3:06:47.600 --> 3:06:54.400]  mockingbird but as we're going to show you in a second in a film produced by alex jones and
[3:06:54.400 --> 3:07:03.920]  info wars dot com and put out over a decade ago that norris insight systems with the nsa were what
[3:07:04.960 --> 3:07:12.800]  entwined into all digital communications all phone calls and directly bringing them there
[3:07:12.800 --> 3:07:19.040]  for keyword searches now this is pre 9 11 this is pre homeland security this is pre patriot act
[3:07:19.040 --> 3:07:25.760]  all right so when people bring up alex alex jones i want people to understand the gravity of that
[3:07:26.480 --> 3:07:35.040]  it was alex jones who was out there saying that the nsa and the government was spying
[3:07:35.040 --> 3:07:42.400]  on the american people pre 9 11 way pre snowden way pre snowden and snowden's revelations
[3:07:42.400 --> 3:07:51.360]  jones really didn't go as far back as this so first clip here guys is going to be from invisible
[3:07:51.360 --> 3:07:59.920]  empire a new world order defined but the other aspects of this article truth cops by the intercept
[3:07:59.920 --> 3:08:04.400]  that we're going to get into is how did we go from what i'm going to show you with norris insight
[3:08:04.400 --> 3:08:14.800]  systems into homeland security into fusion centers and into now signature reduction that works hand
[3:08:14.800 --> 3:08:20.160]  in hand with big tech we're going to take you the whole way we're going to show you some of these
[3:08:20.160 --> 3:08:27.040]  reports via these fusion centers that are over a decade old and how in 2008 when they were talking
[3:08:27.040 --> 3:08:35.440]  about fusion centers domestic terrorism comes up once by 2021 okay they have entire pamphlets
[3:08:36.080 --> 3:08:40.720]  that are half the size of this report i think the original report something like 72 pages
[3:08:41.280 --> 3:08:48.640]  this thing is like 32 pages comes up almost 200 times domestic terror domestic terror
[3:08:48.640 --> 3:08:57.680]  you're bad the evil is within and as they bring out this narrative on a large scale
[3:08:57.680 --> 3:09:04.160]  they have to have further and further surveillance of the people to literally induce a world of
[3:09:04.160 --> 3:09:10.960]  pre crime and thought crime so let's go to this clip right here this is invisible empire a new
[3:09:10.960 --> 3:09:17.680]  world order to find and even a phony environmental movement so it should come as no surprise that
[3:09:17.680 --> 3:09:22.560]  they have been tracking tracing and databaseing our lives for years many people are aware that
[3:09:22.560 --> 3:09:27.360]  the bush administration engaged in warrantless wiretaps on american citizens what they don't
[3:09:27.360 --> 3:09:32.240]  understand is that has come out in court that all the major telecommunications companies
[3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:36.880]  have been secretly storing every piece of data received from our phones and our computers and
[3:09:36.880 --> 3:09:40.960]  handing them over to the national security agency you heard about the government secretly
[3:09:40.960 --> 3:09:46.000]  listening in on phone conversations without a warrant but there is evidence that your email
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:51.760]  is also being tapped the government has been intercepting most emails as part of its terrorist
[3:09:51.760 --> 3:09:56.960]  surveillance program that program has been criticized as illegal because it's missing
[3:09:56.960 --> 3:10:03.200]  an important ingredient search warrants several years ago kline says he came to suspect that
[3:10:03.200 --> 3:10:10.080]  atn t had installed secret computer gear designed to spy on internet traffic at the request of the
[3:10:10.080 --> 3:10:15.440]  national security agency this is just a small part of the picture as atn t was not the only
[3:10:15.440 --> 3:10:20.720]  company involved in emails were not the only issue the nsa was installing norris insight
[3:10:20.720 --> 3:10:25.440]  systems which are capable of monitoring billions of bits of internet traffic per second it was
[3:10:25.440 --> 3:10:30.640]  also able to monitor any calls traffic through its system all websites visited all instant messaging
[3:10:30.640 --> 3:10:38.000]  and separate types of transaction records the secret room at atn t contains gear which enables
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:43.840]  the government to look at every individual message on the internet and analyze exactly what people
[3:10:43.840 --> 3:10:50.720]  are doing here's another document it mentions a company called norris norris makes computer
[3:10:50.720 --> 3:10:56.800]  software that can swallow and analyze 10 gigabytes of information every second that means it could
[3:10:56.800 --> 3:11:02.640]  go through all the information in all the books in the library of congress in a little over 15
[3:11:02.640 --> 3:11:09.840]  minutes i want to say this right now think about how much further technology is not only from this
[3:11:09.840 --> 3:11:16.480]  report that was years old by the time that i put this film out in 2010 but where it is now that's
[3:11:16.480 --> 3:11:22.400]  the blink of an eye 15 minutes probably 15 milliseconds at this point the documents client
[3:11:22.400 --> 3:11:27.040]  and others were able to produce were then censored by the nsa bankston isn't allowed to talk about
[3:11:27.040 --> 3:11:32.800]  the documents in detail the government has since had them sealed but he says what is in there
[3:11:32.800 --> 3:11:38.480]  boggles the mind we are talking about a substantial portion of all the communications traffic in the
[3:11:38.480 --> 3:11:43.920]  united states the policies have been shielded by the obama administration and continue to this day
[3:11:44.480 --> 3:11:49.120]  attorney general holder has publicly stated lawsuits be thrown out of court and after several
[3:11:49.120 --> 3:11:54.080]  attempts client and other cases were thrown out as well once again citing the national security
[3:11:54.080 --> 3:11:59.600]  of what used to be a constitutional republic not a massive corrupt slave state lipp now
[3:12:00.560 --> 3:12:05.520]  mark does does a good job here of talking about living in the new world order i want to skip ahead
[3:12:05.520 --> 3:12:14.640]  a little bit to this subsection where we get to the myack report okay and they were talking about
[3:12:14.640 --> 3:12:19.520]  what people that believe in the constitution then people that were ron paul supporters then they
[3:12:19.520 --> 3:12:25.520]  were going to films like zeitgeist and america freedom to fascism those were the potential
[3:12:25.520 --> 3:12:31.680]  terrorists laying those seeds down over a decade ago from the palm land security is targeting
[3:12:31.680 --> 3:12:37.360]  citizens who discussed the new world order people with a christian identity or sovereign citizens
[3:12:37.360 --> 3:12:41.840]  who argue that the government has gotten away from the intent of the constitution and our strong
[3:12:41.840 --> 3:12:48.240]  states rights advocates people who are anti-immigration stating extremists will argue that immigrants
[3:12:48.240 --> 3:12:53.120]  are taking the jobs of us citizens during times of high unemployment and without paying taxes
[3:12:53.680 --> 3:12:58.160]  people will oppose the federal reserve banking system people who display constitutional party
[3:12:58.160 --> 3:13:03.840]  or libertarian material people who support ron paul and those who have bumper stickers containing
[3:13:03.840 --> 3:13:12.080]  anti-government rhetoric so again the establishment is allowed to talk about what a new world order
[3:13:12.720 --> 3:13:18.080]  they were going after christians again laying that groundwork as they're putting these fusion
[3:13:18.080 --> 3:13:24.480]  centers all over the country there's more fusion centers than there are states in this
[3:13:24.480 --> 3:13:32.320]  constitutional republic so this stuff is not new it is not new whatsoever and i want to show
[3:13:33.120 --> 3:13:39.920]  some of these documents right here so as i said before state and major urban area fusion centers
[3:13:39.920 --> 3:13:47.040]  it's back in 2008 72 page document domestic terrorism just in there once right but the
[3:13:47.040 --> 3:13:55.520]  way that they define terrorism after 9 11 via the patriot act bringing in their little uber mention
[3:13:55.520 --> 3:14:02.160]  driven dutchland security right it's those social Darwinists at the top the transhumanists at the
[3:14:02.160 --> 3:14:09.280]  top the people that think they're better than you both socially and genetically right it's whatever
[3:14:09.280 --> 3:14:15.360]  they say and you go against that narrative right it could be a politically motivated individual
[3:14:15.360 --> 3:14:23.840]  well that's the terrorist and we see it more and more and more national counterintelligence
[3:14:23.840 --> 3:14:32.400]  strategy 2020 to 2022 so he goes across administrations you get down to page eight here and uh so
[3:14:32.400 --> 3:14:38.080]  important because it shows you that again we are all the terrorists anybody that would stand up
[3:14:38.080 --> 3:14:45.520]  up to the establishment narrative that's it that that's that's who the bad people are everybody
[3:14:45.520 --> 3:14:50.720]  take a look let's see we got to get down one more here it is right here so it tells you about the
[3:14:50.720 --> 3:14:56.560]  number of actors targeting the united states is growing oh is it there are other state adversaries
[3:14:56.560 --> 3:15:02.640]  such as kuba iran and north korea non-state actors such as hezbollah isis and al-qaeda those
[3:15:02.640 --> 3:15:10.000]  ones were getting old right as well as transnational criminal organizations and ideologically motivated
[3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:18.880]  entities such as hacktivists leak divas and public disclosure organizations they pose the
[3:15:18.880 --> 3:15:23.920]  significance threats that's why they went after wiki leaks that's why they create false narratives
[3:15:23.920 --> 3:15:31.920]  like russia russia russia because when you put out real information you expose the big boys out
[3:15:31.920 --> 3:15:36.880]  there well they got a new word for that it's mal information we're going to get into mal
[3:15:36.880 --> 3:15:43.920]  information and so much more on the flip side of this ad but guys let's be real they're coming

[3:20:12.480 --> 3:20:18.640]  and we are back it's the fourth hour of the alex jones show before i show you
[3:20:18.640 --> 3:20:27.440]  you that white supremacy and anti-government rhetoric was already on the table for dutchland
[3:20:27.440 --> 3:20:34.320]  aka homeland security from the get go and that it's been empowered i think it's really important
[3:20:34.320 --> 3:20:42.240]  to understand that now the thought police the narrative controllers okay the people that are
[3:20:42.240 --> 3:20:50.000]  help running the quote unquote post truth world that's what we're living in folks the post truth
[3:20:50.000 --> 3:20:55.680]  world before we do that and get into that documentation i think that it is important
[3:20:55.680 --> 3:21:02.000]  to define what mal information is because when i started seeing mal information especially in
[3:21:02.000 --> 3:21:10.880]  social media via youtube and others i knew that we were in trouble because they admit that all's
[3:21:10.880 --> 3:21:19.200]  mal information is is factual information they don't like you sharing and mal information factual
[3:21:19.200 --> 3:21:24.480]  information shared typically out of context so in other words they put that in there to try to
[3:21:24.480 --> 3:21:31.760]  save their mind out of context and it's typical so not always out of context with harmful intent
[3:21:31.760 --> 3:21:37.280]  that allegedly threatens us interest so not the government not the constitution and bill
[3:21:37.280 --> 3:21:45.680]  or rights not the people us interests now here's my demonetization on youtube it's been about three
[3:21:45.680 --> 3:21:50.960]  years now this is why i'm demonetized guys this is the one line we have harmful content there's
[3:21:50.960 --> 3:21:59.600]  that word again content that focuses on controversial issues and that is harmful to viewers now in my
[3:21:59.600 --> 3:22:05.200]  mind i should be able to sue these people into the ground because i've never tried to hurt anybody
[3:22:05.200 --> 3:22:14.480]  i'm i'm pauli peacenick right i'm gary let's get along that's who i am i'm teddy let's talk it out
[3:22:15.200 --> 3:22:24.240]  all right i think that my greatest tool and our greatest tool as not only americans but as a human
[3:22:24.240 --> 3:22:30.640]  species is the ability to speak freely and disagree with one another and have different ideas
[3:22:30.640 --> 3:22:37.840]  and debate one another wow that's numero uno that's how everything is built out of
[3:22:38.560 --> 3:22:45.840]  um discussion and ideas everything especially everything positive right the more light that's
[3:22:45.840 --> 3:22:52.800]  out there the more you empower humanity as a whole but now malinformation is you sharing info
[3:22:53.680 --> 3:22:59.520]  that you think is good info and it might be factual but it goes against those us interests
[3:22:59.520 --> 3:23:05.200]  that are ever redefining and to show you guys again this white supremacy narrative
[3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:11.120]  is nothing new i want to read the first couple of paragraphs out here and again narrative control
[3:23:11.120 --> 3:23:18.800]  in general is nothing new so this is uh out of the missouri fusion center this is the myac report
[3:23:18.800 --> 3:23:24.320]  and again very important that people check these documents out in full because they're just so eye
[3:23:24.320 --> 3:23:31.360]  opening the militia movement began in the 1980s and reached its peak in 1996 this is 2009 document
[3:23:31.360 --> 3:23:37.360]  several social economic and political factors contributed to the surge in militia participation
[3:23:37.360 --> 3:23:44.000]  in the 90s the primary motivator for the movement was the farm crisis of the 1980s which caused the
[3:23:44.000 --> 3:23:50.720]  destruction of three quarters of a million small to medium-sized family farms overall 11 million
[3:23:50.720 --> 3:23:56.000]  americans lost their job during this time period so they're trying to equate people that joined
[3:23:56.000 --> 3:24:02.640]  a militia it's people that lost their jobs not true and they're also trying to equate it to
[3:24:03.520 --> 3:24:09.920]  basically industrialization and overseas trade coming in and less and less of that farm agro
[3:24:09.920 --> 3:24:15.280]  lifestyle right that's also not true what was actually happening is people were visually seeing
[3:24:15.280 --> 3:24:21.840]  that the united nations and globalism was gaining power and that even people like
[3:24:21.840 --> 3:24:26.560]  george bush in the early 90s who were supposed to be christian conservatives were promoting a
[3:24:26.560 --> 3:24:32.640]  new world order all right a new world order but here's the first sentence it gives it away
[3:24:33.600 --> 3:24:39.040]  academics oh those academics again those authoritative sources those blue check marks of
[3:24:39.040 --> 3:24:47.200]  yesteryear contend that female and minority empowerment in the 1970s and 1960s caused a blow
[3:24:47.200 --> 3:24:52.320]  to a white male sense of empowerment this combined with the sense of defeat from the
[3:24:52.320 --> 3:24:58.160]  vietnam war increased levels of immigration and unemployment spawned a paramilitary culture
[3:24:58.160 --> 3:25:06.480]  it's the bad white man they're already framing it for races you get it this caught on the 1980s
[3:25:06.480 --> 3:25:12.240]  with injects such as tom clancy's novels soldier of fortune magazine and movies such as rambo
[3:25:12.240 --> 3:25:18.240]  that glorified combat too much toxic masculinity now it was really going on there was that was
[3:25:18.240 --> 3:25:25.600]  the military in the defense department working with hollyweird to project narratives on those
[3:25:25.600 --> 3:25:33.040]  military agendas so they use this as a tool again and again in different aspects 2009
[3:25:33.040 --> 3:25:40.400]  all the way up to the point that you end up getting this in 2021 all right this is now
[3:25:41.040 --> 3:25:45.760]  a little over a year old almost a year and a half old national strategy for countering
[3:25:45.760 --> 3:25:52.000]  domestic terrorism and it's got all the buzzphrases on the side this is a project that should unite
[3:25:52.000 --> 3:25:57.840]  all americans right when when the poopy pants zombie j puppet is up there last night barely
[3:25:57.840 --> 3:26:04.400]  being able to speak again can barely speak and we gotta expect that this guy is not only run
[3:26:04.400 --> 3:26:09.360]  in the country but he's a unifier right it's only unification when you go with their narrative
[3:26:09.920 --> 3:26:18.160]  together we must affirm that domestic terrorism has no place in our society no shizzle really oh
[3:26:18.160 --> 3:26:25.280]  really domestic terror has no place in our no kidding and they want to label everything terrorism why
[3:26:25.280 --> 3:26:30.800]  because then you have no due process you're not a citizen of this country you don't have a bill
[3:26:30.800 --> 3:26:37.040]  of rights in fact you're less of a human being anyway in these people's eyes that's what the social
[3:26:37.040 --> 3:26:46.000]  Darwinism aspect of this is and before he was just a zombie poopy pants puppet right he was joey b
[3:26:46.000 --> 3:26:53.200]  gangster puppet so i often not talk about this this idea of a new world order right you're not
[3:26:53.200 --> 3:26:57.200]  supposed to in the myac report you're a bigot you're a racist we're going to expand we're
[3:26:57.200 --> 3:27:01.600]  going to talk about the expansion of that into signature reduction on the flip side of the
[3:27:01.600 --> 3:27:08.240]  next break but how i learned to love the new world order and op-ed by joe biden in the wall
[3:27:08.240 --> 3:27:15.120]  street journal in 1992 now this is just after and around the same time that george h w bush
[3:27:15.120 --> 3:27:22.080]  see right and left both both the same thing guys both the same thing all right have that same idea
[3:27:22.080 --> 3:27:29.120]  of why don't we breathe a life into the un charter why don't we build a new world order where's our
[3:27:29.120 --> 3:27:36.000]  place going to be in that it's all right here okay so this spans administrations this spans
[3:27:36.960 --> 3:27:42.000]  even presidencies you want to talk about cabals or the deep state it's the continuity of government
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:49.040]  within the executive branch that utilizes that military industrial complex and then you have
[3:27:49.040 --> 3:27:55.120]  the transnational corporations then working with that military industrial complex for these narratives
[3:27:56.240 --> 3:28:04.000]  that basically use lobbies to bring this agenda to guys like biden within the government and then
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:11.360]  that's parroted by people in the media like madow or dan rather back in the day dan rather is one
[3:28:11.360 --> 3:28:18.960]  of the worst on twitter i mean he is absolutely terrible so when we get back all right we're
[3:28:18.960 --> 3:28:23.040]  going to bring it into signature reduction because it's not just collusion with big tech
[3:28:23.040 --> 3:28:31.840]  for malinformation we're talking about false personas online and beyond with no accountability
[3:28:31.840 --> 3:28:37.840]  whatsoever well if you want to be accountable if you want free speech if you want to stand up

[3:33:22.560 --> 3:33:28.320]  information please consider checking that out and what i don't think most people understand
[3:33:28.320 --> 3:33:36.480]  is that these big tech operations that we're seeing have been co-opted if not just created
[3:33:36.480 --> 3:33:42.720]  outright if not just nurtured outright by the military industrial complex and they get those
[3:33:42.720 --> 3:33:49.120]  contracts sometimes out in front but then they have those backdoor deals when you look at this
[3:33:49.120 --> 3:33:55.040]  future strategic warfare document from 2001 in nasa what they refer to these things are
[3:33:55.040 --> 3:34:03.200]  trojan horse civilian systems at the bottom their trojan horse civilian systems you notice
[3:34:03.840 --> 3:34:10.720]  it's inexpensive for them to do what wage information internet and psychological warfare
[3:34:10.720 --> 3:34:19.520]  on the enemy got news for you the enemy is us all right the enemy is us and i want to just go i
[3:34:19.520 --> 3:34:24.320]  read this so many times but this whole article really needs to be read exclusive inside the
[3:34:24.320 --> 3:34:31.840]  military secret undercover army just the first paragraph the largest undercover force the world
[3:34:31.840 --> 3:34:42.480]  has ever known is the one created by the pentagon over the past decade again no oversight whatsoever
[3:34:42.480 --> 3:34:47.760]  many working under masked identities and in low profile all part of a broad program called
[3:34:47.760 --> 3:34:53.200]  signature reduction not even official name that's an art form that they decided to go with
[3:34:53.200 --> 3:34:58.880]  in some of these documents now these are through foi as far as i know the authors never share them
[3:34:58.880 --> 3:35:05.200]  with anybody either the force more than 10 times the size of the clandestine elements of the cia
[3:35:05.200 --> 3:35:11.920]  carries out domestic all right domestic and foreign assignments both in military uniforms
[3:35:11.920 --> 3:35:20.480]  and under civilian cover in real life and online all right think about that this is the biggest
[3:35:20.480 --> 3:35:26.320]  undercover force ever it's in our country this isn't supposed to be nazi germany
[3:35:27.280 --> 3:35:34.240]  this isn't again this isn't the cia this isn't the nsa this is something different so again
[3:35:34.240 --> 3:35:38.800]  they are in real life and online so beyond just bots they actually create real identities for
[3:35:38.800 --> 3:35:43.840]  some of these people they have a backdoor access into so many of these digital infrastructure
[3:35:43.840 --> 3:35:50.400]  networks that can give us ids right sometimes they're hiding in private businesses and consultancies
[3:35:50.400 --> 3:35:57.600]  some of them household name companies those trojan horse civilian systems and well why are they doing
[3:35:57.600 --> 3:36:04.480]  this well it's because this is a very very real agenda of command and control trying to bring
[3:36:04.480 --> 3:36:12.960]  you into a virtual age of enslavement while having the peasant class the serfs under a social credit
[3:36:13.680 --> 3:36:20.000]  credit score carbon based system well again you're encouraged to be on vr you're encouraged
[3:36:20.000 --> 3:36:27.120]  to have the brain ship right to be transhuman and they try to use biological technology
[3:36:27.840 --> 3:36:34.400]  as a technological fountain of youth for them to live forever all right and that's why this
[3:36:34.400 --> 3:36:40.720]  transgender agenda is so big because it's not about transgender it's about transhuman and you
[3:36:40.720 --> 3:36:46.960]  no longer associating with nature your biology the idea of a god all right that's what this is
[3:36:46.960 --> 3:36:55.680]  really about and because of that i want to play my presentation my from transgender to transhuman
[3:36:55.680 --> 3:37:01.680]  presentation over at the reawaken america tour a couple weeks ago clay clark doing a great job
[3:37:01.680 --> 3:37:06.560]  over there and actually has one uh tomorrow over in branson missouri i'm not going to be there
[3:37:06.560 --> 3:37:12.960]  but so many other great speakers are so let's just get to this from transgender to transhuman
[3:37:12.960 --> 3:37:18.800]  in past presentations here i've talked about elon musk being a front for the military industrial
[3:37:18.800 --> 3:37:24.640]  complex and the transhumanist agenda i've talked about the spiritual aspect of this and although
[3:37:24.640 --> 3:37:32.480]  i'm going to talk about those briefly what i want to discuss with you is how the transgender movement
[3:37:32.480 --> 3:37:40.080]  is really about transhumanism and to show you that i want you to take a look at this book
[3:37:40.080 --> 3:37:47.440]  and this is a real book by the most powerful transgender person on the planet it was written
[3:37:47.440 --> 3:37:57.440]  in 2011 and it is from transgender to transhuman and in the very beginning they discuss billions
[3:37:57.440 --> 3:38:05.680]  of sexes they say that your biological sex is in fact an accident and labeling somebody a boy or
[3:38:05.680 --> 3:38:14.080]  a girl at birth will be viewed as being labeled white or black in south african apartheid this
[3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:21.920]  is written by a person named martin rothblatt martin rothblatt also wrote the books in the late
[3:38:21.920 --> 3:38:31.280]  90s unzipped genes where they advocate for no longer having natural childbirth and instead
[3:38:31.280 --> 3:38:39.680]  having to license your children to be genetically created wrote a book in 2015 virtually human
[3:38:39.680 --> 3:38:45.600]  the promise and peril of digital immortality and the symbol that you see in the middle is
[3:38:45.600 --> 3:38:54.160]  actually the symbol for this person's religion that they started called terra sim it cannot be
[3:38:54.160 --> 3:39:04.160]  overstated this is supposedly the most well-paid woman ceo in the world this is the person that
[3:39:04.160 --> 3:39:11.440]  started serious xm radio this is the person behind united therapeutics and martin is in the middle
[3:39:12.160 --> 3:39:23.040]  with wife bena who has been replicated as an android robot in this religion now also the ceo
[3:39:23.040 --> 3:39:29.760]  of united therapeutics because transhumanism is really two different things they want us
[3:39:30.320 --> 3:39:37.520]  to merge with the machines and use this technology to enslave humanity while the wealthy utilize
[3:39:37.520 --> 3:39:43.680]  this technology to try to biologically stay alive forever now the next clip is going to be the longest
[3:39:43.680 --> 3:39:49.760]  one it's about three minutes long but i want you to meet martin rothblatt at a conference called
[3:39:49.760 --> 3:39:56.480]  transformers put on by jeff bezos the washington post and the good people at lockheed martin
[3:39:58.880 --> 3:40:05.040]  is also the recipient of this year's billy gene king leadership initiative award which is devoted
[3:40:05.040 --> 3:40:10.800]  to lbgt issues and puts her in an interesting issue because she has a company or part of a company
[3:40:10.800 --> 3:40:15.840]  is based in north carolina which as you know right now she might get arrested for going to the bathroom
[3:40:15.840 --> 3:40:22.000]  um if the governor had anything to do about it uh ladies and gentlemen martin rothblatt
[3:40:22.000 --> 3:40:26.480]  martin one of the basic concepts that you're interested in it's not just improving life but
[3:40:26.480 --> 3:40:32.960]  it's actually immortality they're all gonna live forever and martin i might mention has founded a
[3:40:32.960 --> 3:40:42.560]  religion as one does uh known as as terrorism it's uh based on transhumanism and you have the idea
[3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:46.640]  that we're not just going to live a long time but we're all going to live forever tell us your
[3:40:46.640 --> 3:40:52.400]  concept of immortality and how that actually would work thanks nily it's a it's a great pleasure to
[3:40:52.400 --> 3:40:59.360]  be here um the idea is is one that has been percolating up from lots of people in the
[3:40:59.360 --> 3:41:06.880]  information technology industry for a while um perhaps uh ray Kurzweil who um is a um prolific
[3:41:06.880 --> 3:41:14.640]  inventor is is best known for the idea that as our abilities in the information processing
[3:41:14.640 --> 3:41:22.960]  industry uh computer software storage of more and more of our thoughts and our d our ideas
[3:41:22.960 --> 3:41:28.080]  outside of our body let's just stop it right there because we've got about 90 seconds left in this
[3:41:28.080 --> 3:41:33.600]  segment what's being discussed right here at this point is again not just the track trace
[3:41:33.600 --> 3:41:39.840]  database society the metadata the social media monitoring that type of control they're talking
[3:41:39.840 --> 3:41:48.000]  internet of bodies our thoughts our feelings our biology ray Kurzweil gets mentioned here
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:52.400]  and we go into it hopefully we're going to be able to finish the whole thing on the flip side
[3:41:52.400 --> 3:42:00.080]  of this i want to remind people that we need to have open discussions i just said right there
[3:42:00.080 --> 3:42:05.920]  elon musk is a front for the military industrial complex i'm not a fan i'm not a fan haven't seen
[3:42:05.920 --> 3:42:11.440]  a huge change in twitter and even if i did i'd still be questioning why he wants to put brain
[3:42:11.440 --> 3:42:18.080]  chips in people with darpa driven technology why he has a military industrial complex contracts
[3:42:18.080 --> 3:42:24.160]  with space x via starlink and the ride along program for darpa's blackjack and starlink's
[3:42:24.160 --> 3:42:30.640]  highest concentration is in ukraine and it's hooking into death showers from above
[3:42:31.200 --> 3:42:36.960]  via sidewinder and ghost drones we get to talk about that here on info wars dot com
[3:42:36.960 --> 3:42:43.600]  that's why info wars is so important because we have to have narratives that go beyond left
[3:42:43.600 --> 3:42:49.760]  right liberal conservative yeah i'd love to see a red wave too but is a red wave gonna save us
[3:42:49.760 --> 3:42:56.000]  even if we have legitimate uh elections probably not info wars store dot com support alex jill
[3:42:56.640 --> 3:43:01.680]  it's our best seller we first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller
[3:43:02.240 --> 3:43:07.680]  but as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced what made him feel and how healthy
[3:43:07.680 --> 3:43:12.480]  it made him it has become our number one overall best seller and it's been sold out for a while
[3:43:12.480 --> 3:43:17.920]  but it's finally back at stock vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system
[3:43:17.920 --> 3:43:23.520]  but it helps every cellular function of the body it has all the minerals all the key amino acids
[3:43:23.520 --> 3:43:29.280]  all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy essential means without these
[3:43:29.280 --> 3:43:34.240]  things you die and so much the food is debased there's so many chemicals in the environment
[3:43:34.240 --> 3:43:39.040]  it is critical to bolster our body defenses with a product like this now there are other
[3:43:39.040 --> 3:43:44.000]  great vitamin mineral products out there but this is amongst the very best and it's a low price
[3:43:44.000 --> 3:43:48.400]  and it funds the info war so the only way you lose is not taking action today getting vitamin
[3:43:48.400 --> 3:43:54.080]  mineral fusion finally back in stock at info wars store dot com for 50 off vitamin mineral fusion
[3:43:54.080 --> 3:44:01.920]  back in stock info wars store dot com i have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist

[3:44:08.400 --> 3:44:15.040]  we are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war but i don't deserve
[3:44:15.040 --> 3:44:21.360]  the credit yes i've persevered but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason
[3:44:21.360 --> 3:44:26.640]  we've had this success we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new

[3:45:07.680 --> 3:45:13.200]  as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people not as of america but the world
[3:45:13.200 --> 3:45:18.240]  through the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tearing that's why it's so essential

[3:46:57.680 --> 3:47:03.680]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:47:03.680 --> 3:47:16.480]  final segment of the alex jones show let's not waste any time let's jump right back into it from
[3:47:16.480 --> 3:47:25.840]  transgender to transhuman becomes easier more automatic less expensive that ultimately we're
[3:47:25.840 --> 3:47:33.440]  gonna have sort of digital doppelgangers of ourselves that are stored in the cloud and
[3:47:33.440 --> 3:47:41.840]  are able to present themselves to any manner of devices and that as thousands and thousands of
[3:47:41.840 --> 3:47:48.640]  software coders and hackers and people in the maker movement work to make the software that
[3:47:48.640 --> 3:47:55.120]  runs these digital doppelgangers ever more lifelike ever more human like they'll come sort of a
[3:47:55.120 --> 3:48:01.360]  tipping point when people begin to claim that these digital doppelgangers have achieved what we call
[3:48:01.360 --> 3:48:08.640]  consciousness an ability to have a sense of themselves hopes fears and feelings and at that
[3:48:08.640 --> 3:48:14.640]  point i think the activity will move to the legal arena as to whether or not these digital
[3:48:14.640 --> 3:48:21.920]  doppelgangers really are conscious really do have an independent legal identity and kind of the
[3:48:21.920 --> 3:48:28.800]  trend of progressive thinking is once there's a scientific consensus and in this case it would
[3:48:28.800 --> 3:48:34.160]  be the science of psychology that being the science of the mind that these are digital
[3:48:34.880 --> 3:48:42.320]  doppelgangers are in fact cyber conscious then they'll begin to acquire the sorts of rights and
[3:48:42.320 --> 3:48:49.760]  protections that so as you can see after there's a scientific consensus because we all should
[3:48:49.760 --> 3:48:55.920]  trust the science they will be conscious they will have rights and at that same conference you
[3:48:55.920 --> 3:49:03.520]  have this individual here who's already gone through transhuman surgery and immediately they talk about
[3:49:03.520 --> 3:49:09.520]  the transgender movement and how these type of surgeries were done in the 50s and 60s underground
[3:49:09.520 --> 3:49:16.480]  just like the transhuman experiments are being done now that humans don't have so we are in a
[3:49:16.480 --> 3:49:21.840]  sage in history that we can actually design what species we want to be i consider myself a trans
[3:49:21.840 --> 3:49:26.960]  species because i'm adding senses and organs that other species have and you can add many many more
[3:49:26.960 --> 3:49:31.280]  senses that other species have and organs that other species have and we'll start seeing this in
[3:49:31.280 --> 3:49:35.920]  the 20s because it's now growing it's happening underground there's already many surgeons that
[3:49:35.920 --> 3:49:40.960]  are willing to do the surgery anonymously in the same way that in the 50s and 60s transgender
[3:49:40.960 --> 3:49:45.440]  operations were being done a bit underground now cyborg surgeries are being done a bit underground
[3:49:45.440 --> 3:49:51.120]  but in the end bioethical committees will also accept the the cyborg surgeries should be allowed
[3:49:51.120 --> 3:49:55.200]  for everyone that wants to extend the perception of reality at least with the level of other
[3:49:55.200 --> 3:50:02.000]  speech and that's where we see this going now it's being promoted by the world health organization
[3:50:02.000 --> 3:50:08.720]  and the un that are now telling you there is a multitude of genders this is not just to sexualize
[3:50:08.720 --> 3:50:17.840]  your children this is to end the idea of god and nature and actual biology okay and the person
[3:50:17.840 --> 3:50:23.760]  best known for this is ray Kurzweil which martin Rothblatt is a disciple of behind me you'll see
[3:50:23.760 --> 3:50:29.840]  the books the age of spiritual machines which will show Kurzweil talking about the singularity is near
[3:50:29.840 --> 3:50:36.960]  and then the cover story can google defeat death well ray Kurzweil has been trying for over a decade
[3:50:36.960 --> 3:50:45.360]  with google with their immortality division calico and guess what ray Kurzweil also has a female
[3:50:45.360 --> 3:50:56.080]  alter ego who is Ramona well this is a project that started a number of years ago she's a
[3:50:56.880 --> 3:51:03.200]  female she's my female alter ego and will have virtual bodies in these virtual reality environments
[3:51:03.200 --> 3:51:07.360]  particularly when it's through the nervous system when we have nanobots in our brains
[3:51:07.360 --> 3:51:10.800]  they can shut down the signals coming from our real senses replacing what the signals that your
[3:51:10.800 --> 3:51:15.200]  brain would be receiving if you were in the virtual environment then it'll feel like you're
[3:51:15.200 --> 3:51:19.600]  in that virtual environment your body doesn't have to be the same body that you have in real
[3:51:19.600 --> 3:51:24.880]  reality a couple could become each other for example and so it's i wanted to demonstrate
[3:51:24.880 --> 3:51:30.880]  how you could do that well virtual reality you can be who you want to be and you can be where
[3:51:30.880 --> 3:51:39.040]  you want to be and with whom you want to be in virtual reality you can be someone else you don't
[3:51:39.040 --> 3:51:44.960]  have to be the same boring person all the time i mean you all have these personalities inside
[3:51:44.960 --> 3:51:52.160]  you that don't quite fit with your bodies in real reality so basically most people just like kill
[3:51:52.160 --> 3:51:58.240]  them all off some people don't actually keep any of their personalities which reminds me some of
[3:51:58.240 --> 3:52:05.120]  my old boyfriends but that's another story mr. Kurzweil so this is actually a serious project
[3:52:05.120 --> 3:52:11.440]  so it is a serious project and he is hoping and this is back in 2006 that Ramona will be the first
[3:52:11.440 --> 3:52:16.400]  to pass the Turing test and that's the test where you can no longer tell whether you're dealing with
[3:52:16.400 --> 3:52:23.440]  an AI robot or an actual human being here Kurzweil discusses the age of spiritual machines all the
[3:52:23.440 --> 3:52:30.640]  way back in 1999 where he admits that these things may not be conscious but these entities that we
[3:52:30.640 --> 3:52:37.120]  create will convince us that they are conscious and they will get rights themselves so we're not
[3:52:37.120 --> 3:52:43.760]  going to throw our mind file away just because the hardware crashes or as we go to the next very
[3:52:43.760 --> 3:52:51.440]  personal computer to embody our our bodies in our brains we'll copy them and we'll retain that that
[3:52:51.440 --> 3:52:59.680]  information there's a little flying the ointment from my perspective which is just because there's
[3:52:59.680 --> 3:53:05.680]  this entity that thinks it's very credible because he has a he has that memory that snapshot of all
[3:53:05.680 --> 3:53:11.680]  the memories and knowledge that that i've accumulated over the last several decades that have been on
[3:53:11.680 --> 3:53:17.840]  this planet i'm still the outbreak as well which is me is still here in my carbon cell based brain
[3:53:18.720 --> 3:53:25.360]  and so my consciousness hasn't really been transferred over to this new entity in fact you
[3:53:25.360 --> 3:53:29.280]  could have scared my brain while i was sleeping and go and create this copy i wouldn't even necessarily
[3:53:29.280 --> 3:53:34.320]  know about it so i'll just probably end up jealous of this guy because he'll share my ambitions and
[3:53:34.320 --> 3:53:40.160]  dreams but he'll be in a much better position than i am to fulfill them so basically he's saying yes
[3:53:40.160 --> 3:53:47.040]  they're going to copy consciousness but it's not really going to be alive doesn't matter because
[3:53:47.040 --> 3:53:51.920]  they want to get rid of carbon based life another thing Kurzweil talks about we're going to skip over
[3:53:51.920 --> 3:53:57.520]  a couple of these because of time they are them and right here this is the other aspect of trans
[3:53:57.520 --> 3:54:04.800]  humanism so instead of merging with machines using biology xeno transplantation to live forever and
[3:54:04.800 --> 3:54:11.920]  this is jared kushner discussing this friend and and then finally i think that from uh you know the
[3:54:11.920 --> 3:54:15.600]  last year the one thing i've tried to put a priority on since i left the white house was
[3:54:15.600 --> 3:54:20.400]  you know getting some exercise in i think that there's a a good probability that my generation
[3:54:20.400 --> 3:54:25.360]  is hopefully with the advances in science either you know the first generation to live forever or
[3:54:25.360 --> 3:54:30.000]  the last generation that's going to die and so we need to keep ourselves in pretty good shape
[3:54:31.760 --> 3:54:40.240]  so while that occurs they are now grooming us all to go into the metaverse this virtual universe
[3:54:40.240 --> 3:54:45.840]  pumped by the world economic forum and they will continue to pump this because they want
[3:54:45.840 --> 3:54:53.680]  societal value and governance in this virtual world to disassociate you from your biological
[3:54:53.680 --> 3:55:00.720]  reality what you're looking at here is a future strategic warfare document from nasa
[3:55:01.440 --> 3:55:09.200]  where they predict that the bio nano era will begin in 2020 again the shots bio nano technology
[3:55:09.200 --> 3:55:17.760]  began injecting people in 2020 and that they are going to genomically design and repair the human
[3:55:17.760 --> 3:55:23.680]  species the man who wrote this was the chief scientist of nasa then has been around for decades
[3:55:23.680 --> 3:55:31.360]  and is still the chief scientist at nasa let's hear what he has to say humans are now becoming cyborgs
[3:55:32.240 --> 3:55:39.440]  we have cochlear implants to hear artificial retinas to say artificial hearts to live
[3:55:39.440 --> 3:55:45.840]  artificial limbs to move artificial organs to functions and branches there's a couple hundred
[3:55:45.840 --> 3:55:50.000]  thousand people wandering around with brain shifts now the effects can generate effective
[3:55:50.000 --> 3:55:56.160]  brains and increasingly to fix memory and other things darkness working on brain shifts
[3:55:56.160 --> 3:56:03.120]  for super soldiers and people are now working thanks to musk and other people funding direct
[3:56:03.120 --> 3:56:10.640]  machine brain communications the the it's not us versus them us versus the machines
[3:56:10.640 --> 3:56:19.040]  we're merging and this is the human evolution of the humans there is no more natural evolution
[3:56:19.040 --> 3:56:26.800]  of anything people are convinced that the human evolution of everything is 10 million times faster
[3:56:26.800 --> 3:56:33.920]  than any natural evolution and so this is just part of the human evolution and at the end of the day
[3:56:33.920 --> 3:56:40.720]  what do we end up with we end up with human contaminated machines i don't know about you
[3:56:40.720 --> 3:56:46.800]  folks but that's not where i want to see humanity headed this all ends up with with
[3:56:46.800 --> 3:56:53.280]  uploading into the machines and instead of us versus them humans versus the machines we become
[3:56:54.480 --> 3:57:01.200]  there or they become us and we went up with human contaminated machines folks i'm going to fight
[3:57:01.200 --> 3:57:07.120]  against us becoming human contaminated machines i'm going to fight for humanity against this
[3:57:07.120 --> 3:57:14.000]  predator class that literally wants to bring in this transhumanist nightmare and one of the guys
