[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.800 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:33.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33.440 --> 00:41.400]  Another extremely informative and vitally documented radio transmission lined up for
[00:41.400 --> 00:43.720]  you today.
[00:43.720 --> 00:51.200]  We are now into day number three of the World Government Establishing Forum in Copenhagen
[00:51.200 --> 00:57.800]  under the guise of climate change, global warming, the drowning polar bears, a planetary
[00:57.800 --> 01:04.040]  government established by the private central banks of the IMF and World Bank.
[01:04.040 --> 01:08.920]  And that is finally all over the mainstream media that, oh, the Third World's upset.
[01:08.920 --> 01:13.320]  They thought the UN was going to run it and that the General Assembly was going to raise
[01:13.320 --> 01:15.800]  the taxes on the rich west.
[01:15.800 --> 01:23.200]  Oh, there's going to be taxes raised on the not so rich west that's being sucked dry by
[01:23.200 --> 01:28.600]  the bankers, but the taxes will be double per capita on the Third World.
[01:28.600 --> 01:36.560]  This now officially in the treaty discussions, the draft treaty plan, and the IMF and World
[01:36.560 --> 01:42.080]  Bank and other private organizations will run the new global government.
[01:42.080 --> 01:48.920]  They will control all travel, air travel taxes on all financial activities, a flat tax starting
[01:48.920 --> 01:56.640]  at 2%, just like the income tax started at 2%, over the entire GDP, a total tax that
[01:56.640 --> 02:01.880]  all governments will have to pay to the IMF and World Bank.
[02:01.880 --> 02:09.760]  So the GDP of the U.S. is $13 trillion a year.
[02:09.760 --> 02:19.680]  Why you will pay 2% of that to the UN and every other country on the planet.
[02:19.680 --> 02:25.040]  But again, not even to the UN, it's the front company, it's the front government, it's the
[02:25.040 --> 02:34.120]  administrator, ultra massive news and information on this front, new smoking guns coming out,
[02:34.120 --> 02:41.600]  over weather services of governments and universities caught fraudulently fixing the data in line
[02:41.600 --> 02:45.440]  with the IPCC and the United Nations.
[02:45.440 --> 02:49.760]  I'm going to cover it all in the next segment.
[02:49.760 --> 02:59.640]  And yes, we are also going to open the phones up as well today.
[02:59.640 --> 03:10.480]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[03:10.480 --> 03:16.720]  You're welcome to talk about any news item, any issue, any story you wish to discuss.
[03:16.720 --> 03:21.160]  Here is some of the climate gates slash world government takeover news.
[03:21.160 --> 03:27.640]  Monkton, secretive Copenhagen treaty creates Larsonist global government tax.
[03:27.640 --> 03:30.680]  That's theprisonplanet.com headline.
[03:30.680 --> 03:32.280]  Here they are easing an end.
[03:32.280 --> 03:37.040]  Frequent flyers could face higher taxes, says government climate advisor.
[03:37.040 --> 03:41.800]  Oh, it'll just be the frequent flyers at first, sure it will.
[03:41.800 --> 03:47.400]  Only certain areas of your cities will have license plate reading cameras that give you
[03:47.400 --> 03:51.640]  tickets and also tax you by the mile.
[03:51.640 --> 03:55.600]  Meanwhile, it's going in worldwide on every major road and the official government plans
[03:55.600 --> 04:02.960]  are all roads, all roads will be taxed.
[04:02.960 --> 04:08.200]  Administration warns of command and control regulation over emissions, including, as you
[04:08.200 --> 04:17.040]  know, three days ago announcing that they are listing carbon dioxide as a deadly poison.
[04:17.040 --> 04:22.560]  Continuing Copenhagen climate summit says past decade warmest on record, the United
[04:22.560 --> 04:28.160]  Nations is saying that went on when all of the true records show that it has been cooling
[04:28.160 --> 04:31.120]  for nine of the 10 years.
[04:31.120 --> 04:35.360]  There was a warming trend, it's cooling and they fixed the data and they use the fixed
[04:35.360 --> 04:38.760]  data, the cooked data to make that pronouncement.
[04:38.760 --> 04:43.920]  Also the guru of science, Science R. Holdren called for doubling of CO2 emissions in the
[04:43.920 --> 04:46.760]  70s to stop an ice age.
[04:46.760 --> 04:53.200]  Well, we'll break it all down, ladies and gentlemen, new smoking guns on climate gate
[04:53.200 --> 04:55.280]  are out as well.
[04:55.280 --> 04:56.760]  Stay with us.
[04:56.760 --> 05:03.640]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[05:03.640 --> 05:08.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[05:08.000 --> 05:09.000]  do you want?
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  My answer would be all I can get.
[05:11.000 --> 05:16.000]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[05:16.000 --> 05:17.240]  How much do you want?
[05:17.240 --> 05:18.320]  When do you want it?
[05:18.320 --> 05:20.280]  Now or after the battle starts?
[05:20.280 --> 05:21.400]  When will you need it?
[05:21.400 --> 05:23.520]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[05:23.520 --> 05:24.880]  Will there be any food?
[05:24.880 --> 05:26.320]  Will it make your children sick?
[05:26.320 --> 05:30.480]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[05:30.480 --> 05:31.640]  and be immunized?
[05:31.640 --> 05:35.400]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[05:35.400 --> 05:39.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[05:39.000 --> 05:40.240]  How much will you need?
[05:40.240 --> 05:41.240]  We don't know.
[05:41.240 --> 05:42.240]  How much do you want?
[05:42.240 --> 05:43.240]  All you can get.
[05:43.240 --> 05:44.240]  I'm Alex Jones.
[05:44.240 --> 05:47.280]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[07:54.520 --> 07:57.040]  That's tpr20info.com.
[07:57.040 --> 08:14.160]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:14.160 --> 08:22.600]  It is Wednesday, December 9th, 2009, can't believe it's about to be 2010, climatologist
[08:22.600 --> 08:27.400]  who was demonized and politically crucified.
[08:27.400 --> 08:33.720]  Tim Ball will be joining us coming up in the middle of the third hour today.
[08:33.720 --> 08:42.640]  We also have a reporter joining us from Copenhagen via a video Skype link into the radio slash
[08:42.640 --> 08:43.640]  TV show.
[08:43.640 --> 08:47.200]  That will be a somalcasting at prisenplanet.tv.
[08:47.200 --> 08:51.280]  We'll tell you about that as well a little bit later and throughout the week and next
[08:51.280 --> 08:57.560]  week we'll have reporters from Copenhagen including Lord Mockden joining us again coming
[08:57.560 --> 08:58.560]  up next week.
[08:58.560 --> 09:07.480]  They have us a very powerful report and broke a lot of key news here yesterday with us.
[09:07.480 --> 09:13.360]  There is also a two-part video that I shot last night breaking down the latest climate
[09:13.360 --> 09:20.920]  gate but more importantly breaking down the leaked treaty, the addendum to the official
[09:20.920 --> 09:21.920]  treaty.
[09:21.920 --> 09:28.400]  The official treaty has 2% taxes on the entire GDP of the planet over each nation, a global
[09:28.400 --> 09:35.600]  authority over transportation and air travel with taxes to be levied, taxes on all fossil
[09:35.600 --> 09:39.880]  fuels controlled by the IMF and World Bank.
[09:39.880 --> 09:44.400]  It supersedes and strips the United Nations of its global government power.
[09:44.400 --> 09:46.240]  That was always the plan.
[09:46.240 --> 09:51.240]  It is simply a front or holding company, a debating society.
[09:51.240 --> 09:57.040]  In the General Assembly only the Security Council holds power which Obama heads up of
[09:57.040 --> 10:04.000]  course first U.S. President to co-chair that and it hit me this morning that even if Obama
[10:04.000 --> 10:10.680]  gives away his half million dollar Nobel Peace Prize that it is a gift.
[10:10.680 --> 10:15.400]  It is an award by a foreign corporation, by a foreign group.
[10:15.400 --> 10:22.440]  Just open payoffs to the President as he travels over there to sign on to this treaty.
[10:22.440 --> 10:29.920]  But we cannot let this huge devastating news to the New World Order just come and go.
[10:29.920 --> 10:33.240]  The London Guardians reporting on it, the Associated Press is reporting on it but they
[10:33.240 --> 10:40.200]  report on it in a very dry fashion as if they were giving us the latest prices of crude
[10:40.200 --> 10:45.440]  oil or something or the price of tea in India.
[10:45.440 --> 10:50.680]  They just calmly announce, oh, we have the leaked version of the final treaty called
[10:50.680 --> 10:56.240]  the Danish text between the Danes, the Brits and the United States with what they're actually
[10:56.240 --> 11:03.840]  planning, Copenhagen climate summit in disarray after Danish text leak, London Guardian developing
[11:03.840 --> 11:10.480]  countries react furiously to leaked draft agreements that would hand more power to rich nations,
[11:10.480 --> 11:14.760]  sideline the UN's negotiating role and abandon the Kyoto protocol.
[11:14.760 --> 11:20.520]  Now it doesn't give more power to rich nations, it allows the IMF and World Bank controlled
[11:20.520 --> 11:24.520]  by a private banking consortium to have all the power and control.
[11:24.520 --> 11:28.880]  But it's always sold in a divide and conquer system, they tell the third world, oh, come
[11:28.880 --> 11:34.520]  sign on to the global government treaty and you will get to loot the first world.
[11:34.520 --> 11:39.120]  You will be given all this tax money when it's run by the same IMF and World Bank that
[11:39.120 --> 11:45.600]  have by design, it's been declassified in the 2002 leaked IMF World Bank documents that
[11:45.600 --> 11:51.240]  they implode economies by design, John Perkins, Economic Hitman talks about that as well.
[11:51.240 --> 11:53.960]  It's just part of the public record.
[11:53.960 --> 11:59.080]  So again, they're playing the two sides, developed and developing first world, third
[11:59.080 --> 12:04.640]  world off against each other and even in the headline it's deceptive for what the text
[12:04.640 --> 12:05.640]  actually shows.
[12:05.640 --> 12:10.600]  But then in the article they're later honest about it, it says the UN Copenhagen climate
[12:10.600 --> 12:15.520]  talks are in disarray today after developing countries reacted furiously to leaked documents.
[12:15.520 --> 12:20.880]  The UN Copenhagen climate treaty are in disarray today after developing countries reacted furiously
[12:20.880 --> 12:26.320]  to leaked documents that show world leaders will next week be asked to sign an agreement
[12:26.320 --> 12:31.080]  that hands more power to rich countries and sidelines the UN's role in all future climate
[12:31.080 --> 12:34.320]  change negotiations and taxation.
[12:34.320 --> 12:38.200]  The document is also being interpreted by developing countries as setting unequal limits,
[12:38.200 --> 12:43.320]  well you don't interpret it, it says that, on the per capita carbon emissions for developed
[12:43.320 --> 12:49.320]  and developing countries in 2000 and it goes on, meaning that people in rich countries
[12:49.320 --> 12:53.080]  will be permitted to emit nearly twice as much under the proposal.
[12:53.080 --> 12:57.500]  So see, it's a greater tax per capita on the third world because the eugenicists that
[12:57.500 --> 13:02.040]  set this up have stated they want to freeze development in the third world and reduce
[13:02.040 --> 13:04.000]  development in the West.
[13:04.000 --> 13:05.760]  So everyone is going to be robbed.
[13:05.760 --> 13:11.760]  The people of the planet are together in being abused and being brought into serfdom and
[13:11.760 --> 13:20.520]  tyranny and slavery, literal chattel property of this global private government.
[13:20.520 --> 13:25.120]  But of course this article attempts to make it all a divide and conquer strategy making
[13:25.120 --> 13:32.440]  the fight between the industrialized and the developing nations.
[13:32.440 --> 13:37.000]  Individuals known as the circle of commitment understood to include U.K., U.S. and Denmark
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.640]  had only been shown to a handful of countries since it was finalized this week.
[13:41.640 --> 13:45.920]  The agreement leaked to the Guardian is a departure from the Kyoto Protocol principle
[13:45.920 --> 13:52.280]  that rich nations which have emitted the bulk of CO2 should take on the firm and binding
[13:52.280 --> 13:59.960]  commitments to reduce greenhouse gases while poorer nations will not be compelled to act
[13:59.960 --> 14:05.160]  the draft hands effective control of the climate change finance to the World Bank and would
[14:05.160 --> 14:10.880]  abandon the Kyoto Protocol, the only legally binding treaty that the world has on emission
[14:10.880 --> 14:16.120]  restrictions and would make any money to help poor countries adapt to climate change dependent
[14:16.120 --> 14:19.600]  on them taking a range of actions.
[14:19.600 --> 14:23.720]  So it's the same thing you see in the 2002 IMF World Bank documents.
[14:23.720 --> 14:28.140]  They come in with over 100 point plan where countries have to agree to give their water
[14:28.140 --> 14:33.560]  supply to a private corporation, to give their roads to a private corporation.
[14:33.560 --> 14:38.800]  These private corporations owned and controlled by the private banking companies that operate
[14:38.800 --> 14:46.160]  under the holding company of the IMF World Bank, Bank of England of Private Federal Reserve.
[14:46.160 --> 14:47.320]  And so that's all this is.
[14:47.320 --> 14:54.100]  This is the world under a new debt system but where private banks take third world tax
[14:54.100 --> 14:59.960]  money on all carbon, first world tax money on all carbon, give it to the private banks,
[14:59.960 --> 15:05.840]  they then loan it out because it would just be fiat currency if it wasn't paid by taxpayers.
[15:05.840 --> 15:09.960]  It's that labor that gives it value, that chattel labor.
[15:09.960 --> 15:15.980]  So it's a world slave index and then they will pay the nations of the earth and all
[15:15.980 --> 15:26.680]  travelers and all money transfers, stock fees, all financial transactions the way this reads
[15:26.680 --> 15:29.440]  will have a tax on it as well.
[15:29.440 --> 15:34.400]  And then that will be fed through the private IMF World Bank, XM International Bank of Settlements
[15:34.400 --> 15:40.040]  Consortium and then they will loan it out at compounding loan sharking rates of upwards
[15:40.040 --> 15:46.120]  in some cases higher than 30% to the third world nations and the first world nations.
[15:46.120 --> 15:49.680]  Just like with the tarp money, they give trillions of dollars to private banks, they then loan
[15:49.680 --> 15:53.400]  it back to the federal and state governments and this was duplicated everywhere.
[15:53.400 --> 15:59.640]  This is private banks taking over the world.
[15:59.640 --> 16:03.320]  It continues, I mean I'm reading from the Guardian, the draft hands effective control
[16:03.320 --> 16:08.200]  of climate change finance, that's the taxes, to the World Bank would abandon the Kyoto
[16:08.200 --> 16:15.120]  Protocol, the only legally binding treaty that the world has on emission reductions
[16:15.120 --> 16:21.240]  and would make any money to help poorer countries adapt to a climate change development dependent
[16:21.240 --> 16:25.740]  on them taking a range of actions, see they have to go under complete global government
[16:25.740 --> 16:30.400]  control under the purse strings manipulation.
[16:30.400 --> 16:34.640]  The document was described last night by one senior diplomat, it's very dangerous document
[16:34.640 --> 16:39.680]  for developing countries, it is a fundamental reworking of the UN's balance of obligations,
[16:39.680 --> 16:44.520]  it is to be superimposed without discussion on the talks.
[16:44.520 --> 16:49.080]  See it's all dictatorial, a confidential analysis of the text by developed countries
[16:49.080 --> 16:52.560]  also seen by the Guardian, they have a link to the document, we have the document here
[16:52.560 --> 16:57.960]  in my hands, shows deep unease over details of the text and particularly it is understood
[16:57.960 --> 17:02.560]  to force developing countries to agree to specific emission cuts and measures that
[17:02.560 --> 17:06.840]  were not part of the original UN agreement, they have to make double the cuts we do.
[17:06.840 --> 17:10.360]  Divide poor countries further by creating a new category of developed countries called
[17:10.360 --> 17:14.680]  the most vulnerable, so it can be selectively enforced to further vertically integrate and
[17:14.680 --> 17:18.720]  consolidate those nations and shut off their food and water supplies as State Department
[17:18.720 --> 17:23.760]  Miranda 200 written by Henry Kissinger in 1973 states the global plan.
[17:23.760 --> 17:28.920]  So this is a plan he developed and deployed and then it was written into a textbook format
[17:28.920 --> 17:33.120]  by John P. Holdren that is now being implemented fully.
[17:33.120 --> 17:38.000]  Weaken the UN's role in handling climate finance, that means taxes, not allow poor countries
[17:38.000 --> 17:43.720]  to emit more than 1.44 tons of carbon per person, and of course that will track everyone,
[17:43.720 --> 17:49.040]  which allows rich countries to emit 2.67 tons or close to double.
[17:49.040 --> 17:53.000]  Developing countries that have seen the text are understood to be furious that it is being
[17:53.000 --> 17:56.960]  promoted by rich countries without their knowledge and without discussion in the negotiations.
[17:56.960 --> 18:01.520]  Yes, see when you sign on to the Copenhagen agreement, you waive all your rights as a
[18:01.520 --> 18:07.120]  nation and the United Nations slash IMF World Bank can make all the decisions.
[18:07.120 --> 18:11.600]  It's a sharecropper contract where you just sign over and say I'm your slave, I'm your
[18:11.600 --> 18:13.880]  indentured servant.
[18:13.880 --> 18:15.320]  It is being done in secret.
[18:15.320 --> 18:19.280]  This is London Guardian, not Alex Jones, not Lord Monkton, that's a quote.
[18:19.280 --> 18:23.000]  Clearly the intention is to get Barack Obama and the leaders of the rich countries to
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  muscle it through when they arrive next week.
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.560]  It effectively is the end of the UN process, said one diplomat, who asked to remain nameless.
[18:30.560 --> 18:33.720]  See this is the true birth of the private global government.
[18:33.720 --> 18:37.040]  What does my film follow the Republic Detail?
[18:37.040 --> 18:41.600]  This exact process, how the private banks will become the open world government that
[18:41.600 --> 18:43.640]  you will pay your taxes to.
[18:43.640 --> 18:47.160]  And no one else, even in the patriot movement, knows how to read these documents or cover
[18:47.160 --> 18:48.160]  this.
[18:48.160 --> 18:52.080]  I have all these banking experts on, I have all these individuals on, and I'm not tooting
[18:52.080 --> 18:53.960]  my horn, but we understand it.
[18:53.960 --> 18:59.840]  I understand their program because I actually read the large body of work by these people.
[18:59.840 --> 19:02.200]  I understand their governing structure.
[19:02.200 --> 19:04.760]  So fall of the Republic came out a month and a half ago.
[19:04.760 --> 19:08.600]  This came out yesterday, and you watch fall of the Republic.
[19:08.600 --> 19:13.480]  In fact, as soon as Rob gets here, ask him to print the script for fall of the Republic.
[19:13.480 --> 19:17.440]  I want to read to you what I wrote for the voiceover.
[19:17.440 --> 19:23.960]  Exactly what this article says, exactly what the document says, word for word, how this
[19:23.960 --> 19:27.760]  transfer was going to happen.
[19:27.760 --> 19:33.240]  And we've seen globalists for years say, at the final moment, they're going to make
[19:33.240 --> 19:39.040]  the UN even more toothless than it already was, and transfer full power to a private
[19:39.040 --> 19:40.920]  global dictatorship.
[19:40.920 --> 19:45.160]  All being done in secret, and it's all happening right now.
[19:45.160 --> 19:50.680]  Meanwhile, psychology today is writing articles about me saying I'm insane, I believe, in
[19:50.680 --> 19:53.640]  a private global corporate government.
[19:53.640 --> 19:57.600]  And you can play these people clips of world leaders saying it on television, and they'll
[19:57.600 --> 19:58.720]  just say you're insane.
[19:58.720 --> 20:00.400]  I didn't just see that.
[20:00.400 --> 20:05.320]  If you have more than $25,000 in debt and are facing foreclosure, we can stop the foreclosure
[20:05.320 --> 20:09.880]  in one day and get you out of debt in 90 days without making a single payment.
[20:09.880 --> 20:13.400]  Did you know that debt settlement is illegal in at least seven states, and that if you
[20:13.400 --> 20:17.520]  hire an attorney to help you get out of debt, you'll pay seven to ten times more than legally
[20:17.520 --> 20:18.520]  necessary?
[20:18.520 --> 20:19.720]  The system is rigged.
[20:19.720 --> 20:23.320]  These guys get kickbacks from your creditors while charging you up front to get into nothing
[20:23.320 --> 20:25.000]  more than just another payment plan.
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.880]  Look, this isn't brain surgery, you just need the right information and the right help and
[20:28.880 --> 20:30.480]  answers to your questions.
[20:30.480 --> 20:34.920]  No clients of zero debt in 90 days have had to negotiate with creditors or go to court.

[21:12.440 --> 21:13.440]  StartPage.com.
[21:13.440 --> 21:15.480]  The new name for Xquik, the world's most private search engine.

[21:22.320 --> 21:24.760]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the Internet.

[21:56.480 --> 22:03.880]  Originally, we, the people, have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency
[22:03.880 --> 22:09.160]  to ensure purity, content, weights, and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use
[22:09.160 --> 22:10.280]  for commerce.
[22:10.280 --> 22:15.200]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the Fiat continental system, wisdom being
[22:15.200 --> 22:16.640]  lost with time.
[22:16.640 --> 22:20.680]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private
[22:20.680 --> 22:25.940]  business, creating the largest Fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[22:25.940 --> 22:29.880]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our
[22:29.880 --> 22:34.240]  elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original
[22:34.240 --> 22:35.240]  value.
[22:35.240 --> 22:39.680]  Now, foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[22:39.680 --> 22:41.320]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[22:41.320 --> 22:44.360]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[22:44.360 --> 22:50.880]  Call me today at 800-686-2237, I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing
[22:50.880 --> 22:51.880]  the book.
[22:51.880 --> 23:00.720]  Call today at 800-686-2237, again that's 800-686-2237.
[23:00.720 --> 23:04.360]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water
[23:04.360 --> 23:05.360]  filtration.
[23:05.360 --> 23:09.640]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers,

[23:22.480 --> 23:27.040]  cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and removes harmful chemicals such as herbicides

[23:55.560 --> 24:25.320]  My friends, I want everyone to just sit back and let it sink in that open world government
[24:25.320 --> 24:31.440]  is being established by the very same central banks that engineered the financial collapse
[24:31.440 --> 24:36.960]  of last year and this year and who have all registered record profits.
[24:36.960 --> 24:42.800]  They want to use government to force you off your farms, your ranches, to shut down industry
[24:42.800 --> 24:46.480]  so you become bankrupt, so they fully control you.
[24:46.480 --> 24:51.280]  We are literally becoming slaves right now.
[24:51.280 --> 24:55.760]  Now in the West, we're just going to become poverty stricken slaves.
[24:55.760 --> 25:00.920]  The people have already died by the hundreds of thousands due to world food prices doubling
[25:00.920 --> 25:06.520]  in the last three years because of environmental policies and ethanol that was encouraged by
[25:06.520 --> 25:08.880]  governments around the world to be produced.
[25:08.880 --> 25:18.480]  One third of the grain fields, the corn fields, the wheat fields were converted to this and
[25:18.480 --> 25:21.280]  so now the third world is starving to death.
[25:21.280 --> 25:23.320]  Millions and millions starve to death a year.
[25:23.320 --> 25:29.760]  That is the cold blooded plan and if the establishment can get you to starve to death, they'll do
[25:29.760 --> 25:31.520]  it too.
[25:31.520 --> 25:33.480]  They want you bankrupt.
[25:33.480 --> 25:36.720]  They control the banks that issue the currency and credit.
[25:36.720 --> 25:40.200]  These yuppies always write me or email me or ask me on the street, well don't the big
[25:40.200 --> 25:43.960]  banks want to make money, don't they want consumer slaves.
[25:43.960 --> 25:48.800]  They wanted to get you dependent as consumer slaves or get you in the justice system or
[25:48.800 --> 25:57.320]  get you in the psychiatric system or get you into the military.
[25:57.320 --> 26:06.600]  They want you under their control and their number one tool is economic bondage, bankrupting
[26:06.600 --> 26:11.200]  the economy so you've got to work for the government and then of course the government
[26:11.200 --> 26:18.400]  takes most of the tax money and pays it into the corporate welfare coffers because we call
[26:18.400 --> 26:23.080]  it government but most of it is administered now by private corporations, intelligence,
[26:23.080 --> 26:29.560]  spying, the military, policing, everything is being converted to private hands and only
[26:29.560 --> 26:33.480]  select corporations get the government contracts.
[26:33.480 --> 26:38.440]  Under this carbon tax system they take western money, third world money, they go into the
[26:38.440 --> 26:45.920]  third world and they say we'll give you this aid at interest if you do everything we tell
[26:45.920 --> 26:47.080]  you to do.
[26:47.080 --> 26:50.920]  And what does State Department of Random 200 say?
[26:50.920 --> 26:55.800]  By Henry Kissinger we will use war, we will use famine to reduce population and we will
[26:55.800 --> 27:03.080]  use IMF and World Bank loans and tell India and Brazil and Nigeria and 15 countries he
[27:03.080 --> 27:09.240]  listed that they have to cut their population by half if they want this money but they haven't
[27:09.240 --> 27:14.560]  been able to force that so now they want their world government in place.
[27:14.560 --> 27:20.320]  The United Nations from Peru to India pays local governments to literally grab women
[27:20.320 --> 27:26.680]  off the street to grab men off the street and sterilize them or they have them sign forms.
[27:26.680 --> 27:33.320]  You come in, you're homeless, they say I will give you $1,000 and a factory job if you let
[27:33.320 --> 27:44.200]  us tie your tubes, if you let us sterilize you.
[27:44.200 --> 27:50.880]  This is on record and that's the system that's going to happen in the United States.
[27:50.880 --> 27:55.760]  This is the system and I want to warn all the people making $100,000, $200,000 a year,
[27:55.760 --> 28:00.320]  $300,000, even a million dollars a year who think they're members of the establishment.
[28:00.320 --> 28:04.960]  I want to tell you something.
[28:04.960 --> 28:08.800]  You think the received common knowledge is yeah there are too many people, there are
[28:08.800 --> 28:12.820]  too many lazy slobs out there, get rid of them.
[28:12.820 --> 28:14.880]  You are the number one target.
[28:14.880 --> 28:21.120]  You are set to lose your standard of living as well so you better get that through your
[28:21.120 --> 28:25.840]  brain and understand you need to stop playing make believe in your own mind that you're
[28:25.840 --> 28:27.480]  part of the establishment.
[28:27.480 --> 28:31.320]  Just because they taught you about eugenics at college and taught you about the people
[28:31.320 --> 28:42.280]  bomb and taught you that all of this was cute and funny doesn't mean that you are exempt.
[28:42.280 --> 28:45.360]  They're putting fluoride and hundreds of other chemicals in your water.
[28:45.360 --> 28:48.880]  They're putting cancer viruses and mercury in your vaccines.
[28:48.880 --> 28:52.840]  They're spraying you with barium salts and aluminum dioxide with a weather modification
[28:52.840 --> 28:56.520]  program that has the side effect or perhaps it is the main effect.
[28:56.520 --> 29:00.160]  The White House, John Holdren says oh well it's for weather control to save you from
[29:00.160 --> 29:01.160]  global warming.
[29:01.160 --> 29:05.160]  And the scientists look at it and say this will actually cause global heating.
[29:05.160 --> 29:09.880]  The evidence shows the government of the world is actually aware that we are set.
[29:09.880 --> 29:13.520]  They're not sure about it because even with their high tech systems, not their fraudulent
[29:13.520 --> 29:17.280]  computer programs they put out publicly but with their real research, they know we're
[29:17.280 --> 29:23.400]  set to go into a real cooling trend in the next hundred years and it appears they are
[29:23.400 --> 29:27.400]  trying to heat the earth right now.
[29:27.400 --> 29:31.200]  So see they're never really going to cut carbon dioxide, they're just going to tax you.
[29:31.200 --> 29:34.560]  So I guess that's actually a good thing.
[29:34.560 --> 29:35.560]  It's so amazing.
[29:35.560 --> 29:42.040]  In fact internal reports by Holdren are now out where he said we need to double CO2 to
[29:42.040 --> 29:43.040]  stop an ice age.
[29:43.040 --> 29:50.920]  And that has more science behind it than the quackery of global warming over there I thought.
[29:50.920 --> 29:54.680]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:54.680 --> 30:00.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.120 --> 30:04.760]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[30:04.760 --> 30:05.760]  you to eat.
[30:05.760 --> 30:09.280]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[30:09.280 --> 30:10.280]  sick?
[30:10.280 --> 30:12.240]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[30:12.240 --> 30:13.920]  You don't have to cooperate.
[30:13.920 --> 30:15.240]  There is a solution.
[30:15.240 --> 30:18.800]  Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[30:18.800 --> 30:23.600]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[31:00.040 --> 31:04.680]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[31:04.680 --> 31:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[31:09.000 --> 31:13.680]  Number two, our new energies are once to control how much power your electric company allows
[31:13.680 --> 31:14.680]  you to have.
[31:14.680 --> 31:20.360]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[31:20.360 --> 31:24.680]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[31:24.680 --> 31:28.680]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[31:28.680 --> 31:32.160]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[31:32.160 --> 31:35.880]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[31:35.880 --> 31:40.600]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[31:40.600 --> 31:44.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science,
[31:44.440 --> 31:45.800]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[31:45.800 --> 31:50.040]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[31:59.480 --> 32:03.080]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[32:03.080 --> 32:07.800]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[32:07.800 --> 32:08.800]  do you want?
[32:08.800 --> 32:10.800]  My answer would be all I can get.
[32:10.800 --> 32:15.840]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[32:15.840 --> 32:17.080]  How much do you want?
[32:17.080 --> 32:18.080]  When do you want it?
[32:18.080 --> 32:20.080]  Now or after the battle starts.
[32:20.080 --> 32:21.240]  When will you need it?
[32:21.240 --> 32:23.320]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[32:23.320 --> 32:24.680]  Will there be any food?
[32:24.680 --> 32:26.160]  Will it make your children sick?
[32:26.160 --> 32:30.280]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[32:30.280 --> 32:31.440]  and be immunized?
[32:31.440 --> 32:35.240]  Will you wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply?
[32:35.240 --> 32:38.840]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[32:38.840 --> 32:40.080]  How much will you need?
[32:40.080 --> 32:41.080]  We don't know.
[32:41.080 --> 32:42.080]  How much do you want?
[32:42.080 --> 32:43.080]  All you can get.
[32:43.080 --> 32:44.080]  I'm Alex Jones.
[32:44.080 --> 32:47.320]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[32:47.320 --> 32:54.560]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[32:54.560 --> 33:19.000]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[33:19.000 --> 33:27.720]  Patrick Henningson, a journalist, television reporter, will be joining us from Copenhagen
[33:27.720 --> 33:31.160]  in the last 30 minutes of this radio broadcast today.
[33:31.160 --> 33:35.640]  Climatologist Tim Ball will be joining us to talk about the global government establishment
[33:35.640 --> 33:38.000]  that is taking place right now.
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.480]  We have Ron Paul scheduled for Friday and a bunch of other huge guests that I'm just
[33:42.480 --> 33:48.080]  going to not announce until tomorrow, Friday, and Sunday and Monday.
[33:48.080 --> 33:50.920]  We are all over this establishment of world government, obviously.
[33:50.920 --> 33:55.640]  This is everything we've warned of happening precisely as we said it would happen because
[33:55.640 --> 33:58.360]  we were reading the globalist-owned documents.
[33:58.360 --> 34:05.120]  That is what is so frustrating about this is that I have mainstream reporter after mainstream
[34:05.120 --> 34:11.200]  reporter for magazines and newspapers come to this office and I sit there playing for
[34:11.200 --> 34:19.280]  them clips of Al Gore and Von Rompy and Gordon Brown and countless others calling for world
[34:19.280 --> 34:25.240]  government, the establishment of world government, and most of these reporters, I say to them,
[34:25.240 --> 34:29.160]  did you not just see him call for world government and say that the Copenhagen Treaty is the
[34:29.160 --> 34:32.200]  heart of this system?
[34:32.200 --> 34:33.560]  And they will not talk.
[34:33.560 --> 34:34.560]  They will not respond.
[34:34.560 --> 34:36.480]  They'll just smile at you.
[34:36.480 --> 34:43.880]  And then they write articles, many of them, saying that I'm insane and none of this exists
[34:43.880 --> 34:46.000]  like psychology today.
[34:46.000 --> 34:47.000]  And it's a mind game.
[34:47.000 --> 34:48.000]  It's a joke.
[34:48.000 --> 34:49.440]  They're telling all the yuppies.
[34:49.440 --> 34:51.320]  It's not kosher.
[34:51.320 --> 34:54.080]  It's not acceptable to talk about world government.
[34:54.080 --> 35:00.560]  For decades, they created the psychological compulsion, the psychological imprint, the
[35:00.560 --> 35:07.640]  psychological stain, the psychological brand burned into your brain that world government
[35:07.640 --> 35:08.960]  doesn't exist.
[35:08.960 --> 35:11.280]  The Federal Reserve is not private.
[35:11.280 --> 35:13.680]  The banks can do no wrong.
[35:13.680 --> 35:16.080]  Global corporate takeovers don't exist.
[35:16.080 --> 35:23.280]  And then now it's openly happening and even in major newspapers, while simultaneously,
[35:23.280 --> 35:25.120]  it's like George Monbie out of the Guardian.
[35:25.120 --> 35:28.000]  He'll write articles calling us cooks that we believe in world government.
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  Meanwhile, he writes books titled The New World Order.
[35:31.000 --> 35:36.240]  He signs petitions calling for global governance.
[35:36.240 --> 35:40.680]  It's total disdain for the public.
[35:40.680 --> 35:46.040]  They think you're so stupid and so weak-minded that they say it's not cool.
[35:46.040 --> 35:47.320]  It's not trendy.
[35:47.320 --> 35:50.520]  It's not stylish to believe in world government.
[35:50.520 --> 35:55.360]  Now, we're establishing world government, but it doesn't exist.
[35:55.360 --> 35:57.240]  I mean, that's mind control.
[35:57.240 --> 36:00.400]  And the public says world government does not exist.
[36:00.400 --> 36:01.680]  There is no carbon tax.
[36:01.680 --> 36:07.600]  Remember when I had David the Rothschild heir to the Rothschild fortune on, who's pushing
[36:07.600 --> 36:13.000]  all this agenda with Al Gore and all over television?
[36:13.000 --> 36:14.840]  And I said, there's a carbon tax plan.
[36:14.840 --> 36:15.840]  This was three years ago.
[36:15.840 --> 36:17.480]  And he says, no, there's not, there's no tax.
[36:17.480 --> 36:22.520]  And I said, well, here's a clip of Al Gore saying it in Congress, here's all the public
[36:22.520 --> 36:23.680]  plans for global tax.
[36:23.680 --> 36:29.360]  And he said, it doesn't exist, ha, ha, ha, you look at this, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[36:29.360 --> 36:33.280]  And I said, well, why are the ice caps on Mars melting?
[36:33.280 --> 36:36.560]  They've since started expanding again, just like our ice caps have.
[36:36.560 --> 36:40.280]  It's a natural cycle predominantly based on the sun, according to most of the top climatologists
[36:40.280 --> 36:41.280]  we talked to.
[36:41.280 --> 36:46.840]  I mean, all the climatologists say it's not man-made CO2 doing it, but they can debate
[36:46.840 --> 36:52.920]  well the sun's part of it, but also particles from space when we go through storms of more
[36:52.920 --> 36:58.480]  particles in space, they come to the atmosphere and form nuclei for clouds and, you know,
[36:58.480 --> 37:01.960]  but the point is, it's the sun and particles from space.
[37:01.960 --> 37:08.800]  And the earth just has unknown amounts in the trillions.
[37:08.800 --> 37:15.680]  And they just guess at that with readings of particles, micro meteors coming into the
[37:15.680 --> 37:19.360]  atmosphere every day, but that's another issue.
[37:19.360 --> 37:21.400]  I'm going to your calls here.
[37:21.400 --> 37:32.280]  The point I'm trying to make is that world government is here.
[37:32.280 --> 37:35.800]  And it's a nasty world government.
[37:35.800 --> 37:41.880]  And it's openly calling for a global tax on every nation of 2% off the top of GDP, taxes
[37:41.880 --> 37:47.400]  on all fuel, all transportation on top of that, just 700 plus new bureaucracies in the
[37:47.400 --> 37:51.200]  treaty, all run by the private IMF and World Bank.
[37:51.200 --> 37:53.800]  This is staggering.
[37:53.800 --> 37:59.880]  It is just earth shaking to see them actually announced in the Guardian and to post the
[37:59.880 --> 38:06.400]  secret treaty where private banks are secretly setting this up and ordering the third world
[38:06.400 --> 38:16.760]  who are completely in debt to these people through fraud that they must sign onto it.
[38:16.760 --> 38:24.160]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls, Igor, in Virginia, you're first up, welcome.
[38:24.160 --> 38:27.640]  I am just absolutely blown away.
[38:27.640 --> 38:31.120]  It's one thing to read hundreds of government documents and to know they were setting this
[38:31.120 --> 38:32.120]  up.
[38:32.120 --> 38:39.200]  It's another thing to see world government completely unelected, authoritative and tyrannical
[38:39.200 --> 38:44.000]  with the stated aim of shutting off our resources and literally starving the third world to
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.880]  death, openly announcing their crime against humanity.
[38:47.880 --> 38:53.080]  And the average yuppies watching football and stumbling around drunk, laughing at us
[38:53.080 --> 38:54.080]  right now.
[38:54.080 --> 39:01.600]  They have no idea the economic blitzkrieg, the economic siege, exactly what the UN did
[39:01.600 --> 39:04.880]  to Iraq and Serbia and other nations through sanctions.
[39:04.880 --> 39:12.080]  We are going under total economic sanctions and taxes to a group of criminal, outrageous
[39:12.080 --> 39:17.480]  bankers and if we would just stand up, recognize them as criminal, say no to this system, we
[39:17.480 --> 39:18.800]  could stop it.
[39:18.800 --> 39:22.840]  But instead there's all these petty servants of the system that get off on the power trip
[39:22.840 --> 39:28.000]  of serving it even though the system is destroying their future and their children's future.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.720]  That's right, I agree.
[39:30.720 --> 39:35.000]  I want to tell you and you wonderful listeners what happens in our classrooms here in Richmond,
[39:35.000 --> 39:39.640]  Virginia, where I'm from, I got a J. Sarge of Reynolds Community College and my English
[39:39.640 --> 39:45.440]  teacher Ms. Bourne assigned a project on a postmodernism period from 1960s to the present
[39:45.440 --> 39:49.840]  where we were supposed to discuss major historical and social cultural events that have impacted
[39:49.840 --> 39:50.840]  our lives.
[39:50.840 --> 39:57.280]  So I presented a 60 slide presentation covering the creation of Federal Reserve, a takeover
[39:57.280 --> 40:03.040]  of monetary policy by international bankers, I've mentioned quotes from Wilson, FDR, and
[40:03.040 --> 40:07.800]  Refort, I explained the tools they use such as problem reaction solution, false left
[40:07.800 --> 40:12.240]  right paradigm, who runs the corporate media, I've exposed globalist organizations such
[40:12.240 --> 40:17.640]  as Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, CFR, I've covered the New World Order.
[40:17.640 --> 40:21.200]  Like you said, open announcement of global governance and I explained how it links with
[40:21.200 --> 40:25.400]  the recent Copenhagen Climate Change Summit, it even covered Climate Gate.
[40:25.400 --> 40:30.680]  And all of this I used their own quotes from Bank High Moon, Rockefeller, Kissinger, Rompy,
[40:30.680 --> 40:32.480]  John P. Holdren, you name it.
[40:32.480 --> 40:38.040]  Well, not surprisingly, after all that work, I get an email telling me I got an F and she
[40:38.040 --> 40:41.760]  called it a conspiracy theory and it had no relevance to any historical events.
[40:41.760 --> 40:46.000]  So this is just a small example of what happens when you speak out the truth.
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.720]  Absolutely, it's all publicly being announced.
[40:49.720 --> 40:54.320]  Why don't you bring her the London Guardian and the text of the World Government Treaty
[40:54.320 --> 40:56.040]  where it states all of this.
[40:56.040 --> 41:03.080]  I mean, maybe take her video clips of Bank High Moon, Al Gore, Herman von Rompy, the
[41:03.080 --> 41:08.080]  head of the EU, but she will look at you and then tell you that's not real.
[41:08.080 --> 41:13.760]  Well, sir, I was actually, I had videos that I was going to present, but she didn't allow
[41:13.760 --> 41:15.520]  me to even show in one video.
[41:15.520 --> 41:20.320]  I was going to show Rompy and Al Gore calling for global governance and you know, all that
[41:20.320 --> 41:23.920]  stuff and she didn't want to let me have any of it.
[41:23.920 --> 41:27.360]  I should just totally censor it.
[41:27.360 --> 41:34.440]  Well, sir, that's par for the course all over the country and this has even happened with
[41:34.440 --> 41:41.560]  folks I know, Traykin Cade, who used to work here, his girlfriend and I went down to the
[41:41.560 --> 41:42.560]  school and checked it out.
[41:42.560 --> 41:44.200]  It was true.
[41:44.200 --> 41:51.920]  Was it St. Edward's, a great writer and she wanted to write articles about the New World
[41:51.920 --> 41:57.040]  Order with their quotes and she was told by not the school editor, but by the head of
[41:57.040 --> 42:00.920]  the journalism department that it didn't exist and she basically wasn't allowed to and we
[42:00.920 --> 42:03.100]  talked about that on air at the time.
[42:03.100 --> 42:08.480]  But yes, they teach them on the campuses that there's basically no free speech.
[42:08.480 --> 42:14.400]  Now there are still pockets of free speech going on, but this is a great call because
[42:14.400 --> 42:16.320]  it illustrates what I was just talking about.
[42:16.320 --> 42:19.680]  I mean, they're openly establishing global government.
[42:19.680 --> 42:24.120]  The corporate structure says it's a world government they are to run.
[42:24.120 --> 42:26.960]  They say it is meant to starve the third world.
[42:26.960 --> 42:32.760]  It's now in the treaty that the third world has to make double the cuts, which will kill
[42:32.760 --> 42:33.920]  people in mass.
[42:33.920 --> 42:35.880]  There's no doubt about that.
[42:35.880 --> 42:40.520]  And there's already 15 million a year starving to death that will double it to 30 million.
[42:40.520 --> 42:46.680]  It's in the State Department memorandum 200 and these fake liberal yuppies just don't want
[42:46.680 --> 42:51.160]  to believe that their precious world government is a bad thing.
[42:51.160 --> 42:55.920]  And so you're too young to be told that it's really real that you just don't understand
[42:55.920 --> 42:57.040]  why it's needed.
[42:57.040 --> 42:58.960]  And so you're just going to be told it doesn't exist.
[42:58.960 --> 43:00.920]  I appreciate your call, Igor.
[43:00.920 --> 43:06.120]  Now if you decide it's good and you decide you support global government and start writing
[43:06.120 --> 43:10.120]  papers, I did this in college.
[43:10.120 --> 43:16.360]  I was writing a pro second amendment pro liberty, pro freedom papers and being given F's.
[43:16.360 --> 43:22.640]  So in two separate classes, one of them was psychology, I wrote this disgusting pro tyranny
[43:22.640 --> 43:27.320]  piece and was given an A plus and was invited to have coffee with the professor.
[43:27.320 --> 43:30.600]  I mean, these are indoctrination centers.
[43:30.600 --> 43:33.800]  He came over and said, you suddenly had an awakening and our understanding things.
[43:33.800 --> 43:36.440]  I did it as a test and that's when I quit college.
[43:36.440 --> 43:42.120]  So I was about to get enrolled at UT and I played along and I said, yes, I have found
[43:42.120 --> 43:43.120]  out.
[43:43.120 --> 43:44.120]  I do understand.
[43:44.120 --> 43:48.080]  Oh, but his arm around me and said, this is very interesting.
[43:48.080 --> 43:49.320]  This is wonderful.
[43:49.320 --> 43:55.560]  And on purpose, I had spelling errors and mistakes in the paper that was pro tyranny.
[43:55.560 --> 43:56.720]  Didn't matter.
[43:56.720 --> 43:58.560]  That's how America and the world works.
[43:58.560 --> 44:00.080]  That's how this planet operates.
[44:00.080 --> 44:01.440]  It's all fraud.
[44:01.440 --> 44:02.440]  Thank you, Igor.
[44:02.440 --> 44:03.960]  Phyllis in Pennsylvania.
[44:03.960 --> 44:04.960]  You're on the air.
[44:04.960 --> 44:05.960]  Go ahead.
[44:05.960 --> 44:06.960]  Hi, Alex.
[44:06.960 --> 44:11.360]  I have a little incident today where I called my congressman's office.
[44:11.360 --> 44:17.480]  That would be Senator Bob Casey and during my conversation when I was trying to express
[44:17.480 --> 44:25.400]  my dislike for the cap and trade bill and the idea that I didn't think it was something
[44:25.400 --> 44:30.040]  that I wanted them to vote for and I tried to say how it was a horrible bill and how
[44:30.040 --> 44:33.880]  it was going to actually add to taxes.
[44:33.880 --> 44:44.320]  And I also expressed my disdain about the EPA saying that CO2 was a toxic gas and should
[44:44.320 --> 44:46.600]  be regulated.
[44:46.600 --> 44:52.680]  The gentleman decided that he was going to argue with me and felt that all of my information
[44:52.680 --> 44:55.400]  that I was providing for him was absolutely incorrect.
[44:55.400 --> 44:56.400]  Oh, yeah.
[44:56.400 --> 45:00.480]  You could call the Texas legislature two years ago and tell them you didn't want the trans
[45:00.480 --> 45:05.040]  Texas corridor, part of the NAFTA superhighway system, that they built and put billboards
[45:05.040 --> 45:09.360]  up for and they would tell you it didn't exist.
[45:09.360 --> 45:14.800]  CNN says none of this exists, that Ron Paul is insane.
[45:14.800 --> 45:16.760]  And so, of course, that's standard procedure.
[45:16.760 --> 45:20.280]  They just tell you, no, there is no carbon tax.
[45:20.280 --> 45:21.280]  Let me guess.
[45:21.280 --> 45:22.280]  Did he tell you that?
[45:22.280 --> 45:23.280]  Well, there's no tax, sir.
[45:23.280 --> 45:24.280]  There's no.
[45:24.280 --> 45:27.280]  Or did he say, oh, no, carbon dioxide is very deadly.
[45:27.280 --> 45:32.960]  Both of the above, I try to tell him that actually that the car that the cap and trade
[45:32.960 --> 45:38.280]  was actually being instituted in it actually was something that was happening in California
[45:38.280 --> 45:41.040]  and in Texas and he said, oh, no, that's not true.
[45:41.040 --> 45:42.040]  That's not true.
[45:42.040 --> 45:45.800]  I said, well, you know, oh, no, they're not putting emissions taxes on everybody.
[45:45.800 --> 45:48.640]  They're not banning big TVs and taxing the rest.
[45:48.640 --> 45:49.640]  They're not.
[45:49.640 --> 45:51.360]  I mean, it's all happening.
[45:51.360 --> 45:55.600]  I mean, multiple states have passed laws on every cow.
[45:55.600 --> 45:59.720]  They've got to pay between $100 and $200 for their methane flatulence.
[45:59.720 --> 46:01.280]  I mean, it's all happening.
[46:01.280 --> 46:02.280]  What are they talking about?
[46:02.280 --> 46:07.360]  Well, what he insisted on, I mean, he continued and he actually got upset with me because
[46:07.360 --> 46:12.000]  I called him young man and he told me that I was insulting him and that actually if I
[46:12.000 --> 46:16.240]  didn't stop doing that, that he was going to hang up on me and I said, excuse me, young
[46:16.240 --> 46:19.160]  man is definitely not something that should be insulting to you.
[46:19.160 --> 46:23.760]  Look, the issue is you just let that person know that you're going to go to all the senators,
[46:23.760 --> 46:28.140]  public events and that you're going to bring up real issues and hand out literature.
[46:28.140 --> 46:31.720]  And when everybody loses more of their jobs, you're going to let the constituents know
[46:31.720 --> 46:34.920]  that they put more nails in the coffin of our industry.
[46:34.920 --> 46:39.760]  You just let that creature know you're not that, hey, buddy, you're not sandbagging me.
[46:39.760 --> 46:41.760]  You're propaganda and working on me.
[46:41.760 --> 46:43.880]  And then you tell him, I want your superior.
[46:43.880 --> 46:44.880]  Okay.
[46:44.880 --> 46:51.360]  You don't want to talk to some snot-nosed little petty staffer, you know, who's been
[46:51.360 --> 46:55.040]  put in there by their family to be part of the parasite system.
[46:55.040 --> 46:56.040]  What else happened?
[46:56.040 --> 47:01.280]  Well, I mean, and then eventually I actually told him that I didn't really want to be bothered
[47:01.280 --> 47:03.120]  with any more of his bull crap.
[47:03.120 --> 47:04.640]  I'm going to let you go.
[47:04.640 --> 47:06.440]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[47:06.440 --> 47:07.440]  Okay.
[47:07.440 --> 47:09.280]  Let's talk to Chris in Georgia.
[47:09.280 --> 47:11.280]  Chris, you're on the air.
[47:11.280 --> 47:12.280]  Welcome.
[47:12.280 --> 47:13.280]  Hi, Alex.
[47:13.280 --> 47:16.040]  You know, you're fantastic.
[47:16.040 --> 47:24.240]  I don't agree with all you say, especially some of your purist, anti-socialist philosophies,
[47:24.240 --> 47:26.040]  but the main thing is...
[47:26.040 --> 47:27.040]  Hold on a minute.
[47:27.040 --> 47:28.040]  Hold on, Chris.
[47:28.040 --> 47:29.040]  I'll let you talk.
[47:29.040 --> 47:30.040]  Don't you understand, Chris?
[47:30.040 --> 47:34.000]  They suckered the whole third world to go sign on to this treaty thinking they were
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.080]  going to get a bunch of free money from the West.
[47:37.080 --> 47:41.640]  Socialism never turns out to be what they say because big banks and money power always
[47:41.640 --> 47:46.080]  promote it because they just want control of the purse for social engineering and to
[47:46.080 --> 47:47.440]  give it to themselves.
[47:47.440 --> 47:48.840]  And that's what's happening again.
[47:48.840 --> 47:50.240]  Do you understand?
[47:50.240 --> 47:51.240]  Yes.
[47:51.240 --> 47:52.240]  Yes.
[47:52.240 --> 47:53.840]  And that wasn't the thing I really called about.
[47:53.840 --> 48:00.120]  You know, music is very powerful and I love your music, but the best messages in music
[48:00.120 --> 48:02.760]  come in these Irish rebel songs.
[48:02.760 --> 48:07.080]  Let's get a few Irish rebel songs on there because they have all kinds of really good
[48:07.080 --> 48:09.080]  statements about tyranny dealing with the British...
[48:09.080 --> 48:14.160]  There are a million good songs that I don't even have time to listen to or play as bumper
[48:14.160 --> 48:22.360]  music, but email show tips, some songs, some MP3s that you think are important.
[48:22.360 --> 48:25.760]  We do play that Christopher Irish Rebel Song Revolution.
[48:25.760 --> 48:35.040]  The question I have for you is, the Lord Compton, what does he think of the Queen?
[48:35.040 --> 48:39.800]  Well, certainly I'm sure that he likes being a peer of the crown and he's an old lying
[48:39.800 --> 48:47.000]  conservative Brit and we're busy fighting the Copenhagen establishment of world government
[48:47.000 --> 48:52.360]  and so I'm an ally with him because he's an eloquent speaker against it.
[48:52.360 --> 48:55.480]  And so obviously I'm not going to get him up here on the radio and start asking him
[48:55.480 --> 48:58.720]  about the groom of the stool, but I appreciate your call.
[48:58.720 --> 49:01.240]  Anything else, Chris?
[49:01.240 --> 49:09.960]  I like the way you answered that because it shows that you are able to focus on where
[49:09.960 --> 49:16.520]  you can ally with people that you may not agree with radically on other subjects.
[49:16.520 --> 49:17.960]  I appreciate your call.
[49:17.960 --> 49:26.560]  Look, Moncton is a Scott and they've been brought into the whole parentage system and
[49:26.560 --> 49:27.560]  I've read his writings.
[49:27.560 --> 49:36.120]  He's pro 1776, he's profounding father, he loves Thomas Jefferson, he doesn't like King
[49:36.120 --> 49:37.920]  George III.
[49:37.920 --> 49:45.360]  Did you know that the parliament only voted for war against the colonies in 1776 by a
[49:45.360 --> 49:46.360]  few votes?
[49:46.360 --> 49:51.240]  In fact, they couldn't pass it a month before and King George III had to do a rare appearance
[49:51.240 --> 49:56.560]  in parliament to demand and shame them into going to war.
[49:56.560 --> 50:00.280]  That was the main reason the war ended in seven years.
[50:00.280 --> 50:03.360]  The British government probably could have kept the war going and may have even won in
[50:03.360 --> 50:06.760]  the end, but that we had so many allies in England.
[50:06.760 --> 50:11.800]  I mean, remember the British repeatedly arrested the royalty and chopped their heads off.
[50:11.800 --> 50:16.840]  And that's where we got our Bill of Rights and Constitution was out of Magna Carta and
[50:16.840 --> 50:19.680]  then later the parliament act.
[50:19.680 --> 50:22.720]  The first hard won battles were made in England.
[50:22.720 --> 50:28.040]  It isn't like that England was this totally separate thing.
[50:28.040 --> 50:32.360]  The Greeks influenced the founders, the Swiss influenced the founders, the Dutch influenced
[50:32.360 --> 50:40.280]  the founders, but most importantly, British common law hard won by the commoners allied
[50:40.280 --> 50:41.800]  with the lords.
[50:41.800 --> 50:47.400]  It was the lords that ended the hegemony of the king and queen.
[50:47.400 --> 50:48.600]  You understand that?
[50:48.600 --> 50:51.560]  It was the lords that brought freedom to England.
[50:51.560 --> 50:54.560]  So it's a very sophisticated issue, sir.
[50:54.560 --> 51:00.680]  But yes, I don't like the German queen, Saxe-Coburg-Gotham.
[51:00.680 --> 51:03.160]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[51:03.160 --> 51:04.960]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[51:04.960 --> 51:06.800]  No more mortgage can change your life.
[51:06.800 --> 51:08.240]  We paid off all of our bills.
[51:08.240 --> 51:11.080]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years?
[51:11.080 --> 51:16.760]  With no more mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[51:16.760 --> 51:18.320]  Even have more money left over each month?
[51:18.320 --> 51:22.080]  That lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[51:22.080 --> 51:23.080]  No more mortgage.
[51:23.080 --> 51:24.720]  Where have they been all of our life?
[51:24.720 --> 51:27.240]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[51:27.240 --> 51:31.000]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.320]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.
[51:33.320 --> 51:38.320]  This is unlike anything you have ever seen before, and it will absolutely not harm your
[51:38.320 --> 51:39.320]  credit.
[51:39.320 --> 51:40.320]  Call for your free CD.
[51:40.320 --> 51:44.040]  Learn how you can eliminate all your debt, including your mortgage, much sooner than
[51:44.040 --> 51:45.320]  you ever dreamed possible.
[51:45.320 --> 51:47.400]  The more debt you have, the more we can help.
[51:47.400 --> 51:51.520]  Call for your free CD now, 800-578-6279.
[51:51.520 --> 51:52.520]  This works.
[51:52.520 --> 51:53.520]  Call the number.
[51:53.520 --> 52:02.280]  Call now for your free CD, 800-578-6279, 800-578-6279.
[52:02.280 --> 52:06.040]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[52:06.040 --> 52:09.200]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[52:09.200 --> 52:13.520]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[52:13.520 --> 52:14.520]  at home.
[52:14.520 --> 52:19.160]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[52:19.160 --> 52:20.160]  calling the shots.
[52:20.160 --> 52:25.520]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[52:25.520 --> 52:30.960]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[52:30.960 --> 52:35.680]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[52:35.680 --> 52:38.040]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[52:38.040 --> 52:42.200]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[52:42.200 --> 52:47.600]  Today it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[52:47.600 --> 52:49.400]  a fall of the Republic.
[52:49.400 --> 52:53.880]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[52:53.880 --> 53:00.880]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[53:00.880 --> 53:05.080]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better
[53:05.080 --> 53:08.640]  than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood
[53:08.640 --> 53:11.760]  sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[53:11.760 --> 53:15.440]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of
[53:15.440 --> 53:16.440]  them.
[53:16.440 --> 53:18.000]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.320]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of
[53:22.320 --> 53:23.720]  Heart and Body Extract.
[53:23.720 --> 53:28.080]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary
[53:28.080 --> 53:33.720]  vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[53:33.720 --> 53:38.200]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol,
[53:38.200 --> 53:43.520]  clean and unclog the arteries, it can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[53:43.520 --> 53:48.240]  So the body is an amazing thing, it simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal
[53:48.240 --> 53:49.240]  itself.
[53:49.240 --> 53:51.200]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[54:09.080 --> 54:38.200]  By the way, later in the broadcast for today, I'm going to premiere a 21-minute piece we
[54:38.200 --> 54:44.840]  did that's being posted in the next hour at prisonplanet.tv for prisonplanet.tv members.
[54:44.840 --> 54:50.560]  My interview with Dave Mustaine of Megadeth and it's superimposed with a little private
[54:50.560 --> 54:54.240]  concert he gave us for two hours before he went out and played live, just some short
[54:54.240 --> 54:55.760]  snippets of that.
[54:55.760 --> 54:57.800]  That is coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[54:57.800 --> 55:03.240]  I'm continuing with your phone calls and we'll continue in the third and fourth hour
[55:03.240 --> 55:09.000]  with guests and calls on the open public establishment of world government.
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.400]  And I could not have made Fall of the Republic at a more timely time.
[55:12.400 --> 55:15.920]  The United States is going into chattel bondage and slavery.
[55:15.920 --> 55:22.080]  This is the equivalent of 1776, the Declaration of Independence, July 4th in reverse.
[55:22.080 --> 55:26.720]  This is a private corporate takeover of the United States.
[55:26.720 --> 55:30.080]  Everyone needs to order the DVD, Fall of the Republic.
[55:30.080 --> 55:35.400]  You can get a free t-shirt, a bunch of different choices up there for a limited time when you
[55:35.400 --> 55:36.520]  get the DVD.
[55:36.520 --> 55:37.920]  Give it as a Christmas gift.
[55:37.920 --> 55:40.080]  Give folks a prisonplanet.tv membership.
[55:40.080 --> 55:44.240]  Just create a username and passcode and give someone an e-card that says you have a membership
[55:44.240 --> 55:49.840]  to thousands of videos, live TV shows, my book, Paul Watson's book, prisonplanet.tv.
[55:49.840 --> 55:54.880]  You can burn Fall of the Republic, in game, terror storm, the Obama deception, on DivEx,
[55:54.880 --> 56:01.040]  to regular CDs that play in most DVD players and give it to people.
[56:01.040 --> 56:04.520]  Get Fall of the Republic today so we can save the Republic.
[56:04.520 --> 56:10.840]  We've got to get the word out to the people about what's happening right now.
[56:10.840 --> 56:13.680]  The world government is taking over right now.
[56:13.680 --> 56:18.280]  They'll sign these treaties and then incrementally put the taxes and regulation in place.
[56:18.280 --> 56:20.200]  A lot of it's already in place.
[56:20.200 --> 56:24.040]  This is happening now, ladies and gentlemen.
[56:24.040 --> 56:28.520]  No more time to play games and the general public is finally ready to wake up.
[56:28.520 --> 56:31.000]  They've heard World Government announced on CNN.
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.280]  They've heard World Government announced on Fox.
[56:33.280 --> 56:35.240]  They've seen it in the front of their newspaper.
[56:35.240 --> 56:36.280]  New World Order.
[56:36.280 --> 56:38.920]  World Government is here to save the earth.
[56:38.920 --> 56:40.400]  Then you read the fine print.
[56:40.400 --> 56:42.440]  It's a tax to private banks.
[56:42.440 --> 56:43.680]  This is happening now.
[56:43.680 --> 56:46.640]  We detail it with stunning clarity.
[56:46.640 --> 56:50.440]  Everything that's now happening in Fall of the Republic.
[56:50.440 --> 56:52.040]  We cover the Copenhagen Summit.
[56:52.040 --> 56:55.680]  We cover it all because this was their plan.
[56:55.680 --> 56:59.840]  You can give people this film and say, look, this was released months ago and it's everything
[56:59.840 --> 57:01.120]  that's happening now.
[57:01.120 --> 57:06.880]  People really listen and wake up to things that were done before it happened.
[57:06.880 --> 57:08.080]  People like that.
[57:08.080 --> 57:10.640]  It verifies the information for them.
[57:10.640 --> 57:12.200]  This film is evergreen.
[57:12.200 --> 57:17.000]  You can watch this film in a thousand years and it will be pertinent to the real history
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.240]  of what happened.
[57:18.240 --> 57:21.840]  Like Jesse Ventura said yesterday, he's proud of his television show because it will be
[57:21.840 --> 57:27.040]  a testament to a lot of key things in history of what really happened.

[57:51.520 --> 57:54.160]  The mega-death interview I did.
[57:54.160 --> 57:55.160]  It's very important.
[57:55.160 --> 57:57.520]  This is the second biggest heavy metal band in the world.
[57:57.520 --> 58:01.280]  Of course, Dave Mustaine was part of Metallica, the biggest group.
[58:01.280 --> 58:04.080]  And he has tens of millions of fans around the world.
[58:04.080 --> 58:07.280]  And his new album is named Endgame off of my film.
[58:07.280 --> 58:10.400]  He said that here on air a month ago when he was with us a month and a half ago.
[58:10.400 --> 58:15.280]  And we went and interviewed him about the New World Order, about the banking system,
[58:15.280 --> 58:16.280]  so much more.
[58:16.280 --> 58:23.840]  We're going to premiere this at 12.30 live today streaming for prisonplanet.tv members.
[58:23.840 --> 58:28.120]  And then right after that it's going up at prisonplanet.tv.

[58:50.320 --> 58:55.000]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[58:55.000 --> 58:56.000]  you to eat.
[58:56.000 --> 58:59.760]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[58:59.760 --> 59:00.760]  sick?
[59:00.760 --> 59:02.480]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[59:02.480 --> 59:04.120]  You don't have to cooperate.
[59:04.120 --> 59:05.320]  There is a solution.
[59:05.320 --> 59:09.000]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing

[59:26.600 --> 59:27.600]  manager.
[59:27.600 --> 59:32.120]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your

[59:53.280 --> 1:00:05.160]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.160 --> 1:00:09.960]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:09.960 --> 1:00:10.960]  You want answers?
[1:00:10.960 --> 1:00:13.160]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:13.160 --> 1:00:29.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:35.120]  We are now into hour number two, if you've just joined us.
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:40.560]  We have the secret text, the latest version of the Copenhagen World Government Treaty.
[1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:44.960]  It states the third world has to make right at double the cuts the first world.
[1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:48.440]  I always told you it was a fraud to shut them down.
[1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:53.200]  The first world will have massive taxes as well, paid to the IMF and World Bank.
[1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:56.280]  The UN is effectively being abolished.
[1:00:56.280 --> 1:01:00.720]  It was always just a front to get the third world maneuvered into place.
[1:01:00.720 --> 1:01:05.560]  A propaganda arm will be used as a regulatory governing body, but it is having the final
[1:01:05.560 --> 1:01:11.600]  vestiges of its power completely publicly stripped to the private world banking structure.
[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:18.280]  This is off the charts, huge, double, triple, quadruple confirming everything to the letter
[1:01:18.280 --> 1:01:21.960]  that we told you was going to happen.
[1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:23.280]  How about them apples?
[1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:26.560]  Let's talk to Richard N. Mass, Richard, you're on the air.
[1:01:26.560 --> 1:01:27.560]  Welcome.
[1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:30.920]  Well, thanks for the great show and the good breaking information.
[1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:35.280]  I want to let you know that it's been cold out here for a whole year out here on the
[1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:36.280]  East Coast for a month.
[1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:42.640]  He's man-made clouds, like, and a whole winter, since the summer has been actually colder.
[1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:43.640]  I tried.
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:47.360]  It makes it, well, generally, the climatologists say the chemtrailing makes it warmer in the
[1:01:47.360 --> 1:01:52.800]  summer, colder in the winter, but there's also other weather effects going on.
[1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:55.360]  But the earth is also going into a natural cooling cycle.
[1:01:55.360 --> 1:02:00.080]  It's been locked into clouds all summer.
[1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:05.040]  What I called out was the show you had yesterday about these plate readers out here on the
[1:02:05.040 --> 1:02:06.040]  East Coast.
[1:02:06.040 --> 1:02:07.360]  They've set it up completely.
[1:02:07.360 --> 1:02:11.200]  They're cracking down on our freedom of movement.
[1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:15.600]  Everywhere you go nationwide, not just worldwide, all industrialized countries have license plate
[1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:19.440]  reading cameras cracking everywhere you go, and they're publicly announcing under the
[1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:25.920]  carbon tax, the first big tax will be a federal, state, and local buy-the-mile tax now being
[1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:26.920]  announced.
[1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:30.320]  They have it completely set up in Rhode Island and Massachusetts already.
[1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:35.640]  They have cameras on every state line, on every bridge.
[1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:43.160]  They get you $12 to just drive into the state capital, round trip, and $8 over the bridges,
[1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:46.000]  and then they want you to buy this easy pass, which I won't buy.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  I don't want to pay cash.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:51.200]  Yeah, they want the transponder because then they can track you anywhere, not just when
[1:02:51.200 --> 1:02:53.200]  you go through license plate scanners.
[1:02:53.200 --> 1:02:57.400]  And your tax money paid for it all, and it all goes right to the central banks.
[1:02:57.400 --> 1:03:00.960]  As they cut, as they cut all the, and they tell the cops, oh, you got to write more tickets
[1:03:00.960 --> 1:03:08.360]  or we're going to go bankrupt, we have a state shortfall going right now.
[1:03:08.360 --> 1:03:13.520]  And it's all lies, and the police are just out there squeezing people.
[1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:17.680]  In Rhode Island, they even have these, on every exit, they have these monitors.
[1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:19.680]  I think it's run by solar.
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:24.320]  I think they're tracking everyone going on and off every exit.
[1:03:24.320 --> 1:03:33.080]  Well, sir, I'm sorry that we're living in this control grid, but I appreciate your call.
[1:03:33.080 --> 1:03:35.400]  Anything else, Richard?
[1:03:35.400 --> 1:03:38.400]  If you like Megadeth, please listen to the levelers.
[1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:41.640]  All right, thank you.
[1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:42.760]  Thank you so much, Richard.
[1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:48.600]  You know, I like Megadeth because when I was 14 years old, I listened to it.
[1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:54.160]  And the lyrics weren't devil worship this, devil worship that, and Dave Mustaine's always
[1:03:54.160 --> 1:04:02.600]  made the point that he was never a devil worshiper, though he did devil, you know, into magic
[1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:03.600]  and things.
[1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:04.600]  That's the gateway to it.
[1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:08.720]  He now recognizes that, but his lyrics were always anti-New World Order.
[1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:13.160]  And now he really understands what's going on, and that's why this is important, because
[1:04:13.160 --> 1:04:18.240]  he reaches conservatively 50 million people worldwide.
[1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:23.560]  I mean, Heavy Metal is one of the most popular genres out there to tell people that.
[1:04:23.560 --> 1:04:29.400]  And Megadeth is the officially the second biggest heavy metal band of all time.
[1:04:29.400 --> 1:04:36.440]  And his new album's named after Endgame, named after my film, my seminal documentary.
[1:04:36.440 --> 1:04:40.400]  And so that's why we went up and did this interview with Dave Mustaine, so we can reach
[1:04:40.400 --> 1:04:46.200]  out to all of his fans and educate them about the New World Order.
[1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:56.000]  So that is what is coming up today in T-minus 27 minutes at 33 after we're going to play
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:00.320]  this interview, this video interview live, Audio for Radio.
[1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:04.280]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Akola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[1:05:04.280 --> 1:05:07.160]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[1:06:00.080 --> 1:06:04.720]  This is Alex Jones with 5 Good Reasons You Should Consider Buying a Solar Power Generator.
[1:06:04.720 --> 1:06:05.720]  Number 1.
[1:06:05.720 --> 1:06:09.040]  New Climate Legislation Could Easily Double or Triple Your Electric Bill.
[1:06:09.040 --> 1:06:10.040]  Number 2.
[1:06:10.040 --> 1:06:13.920]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to
[1:06:13.920 --> 1:06:14.920]  have.
[1:06:14.920 --> 1:06:15.920]  It's true.
[1:06:15.920 --> 1:06:20.400]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:06:20.400 --> 1:06:21.400]  Number 3.
[1:06:21.400 --> 1:06:24.720]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:06:24.720 --> 1:06:28.740]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:06:28.740 --> 1:06:29.740]  Number 4.
[1:06:29.740 --> 1:06:32.200]  This weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:06:32.200 --> 1:06:35.760]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:06:35.760 --> 1:06:36.760]  Number 5.
[1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:40.600]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:06:40.600 --> 1:06:44.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:06:44.440 --> 1:06:45.840]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[51:36.460 --> 1:08:24.280]  going to go through some of the unbelievably important developments going
[1:08:24.280 --> 1:08:29.200]  on at Copenhagen with the public establishment of world government.
[1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:34.560]  Also more whistleblowers coming out from universities about scientific fraud going on.
[1:08:34.560 --> 1:08:40.040]  Universities worldwide, it emerged last Monday when the Associated Press and Fox News of
[1:08:40.040 --> 1:08:45.960]  all places reported it colluding with universities to fix the data, not just climate gate the
[1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:49.120]  original emails.
[1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:53.840]  So that is coming up and right now let's go back to your phone calls and we're going
[1:08:53.840 --> 1:08:59.160]  to have the premiere of the Megadeth interview at prismplanet.tv and of course audio for
[1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:03.960]  the radio listeners coming up at the bottom of this hour at 33 after.
[1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:09.800]  Right now, let's go to, who's up first here, John?
[1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:11.320]  Ron and Marilyn, you're on the air.
[1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:12.320]  Thanks for holding.
[1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:13.320]  Hi, Alex.
[1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:17.120]  Thanks for having me on your show.
[1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:21.920]  I really appreciate what you're doing and stuff on, but I had two points that I wanted
[1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:22.920]  to make.
[1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:23.920]  Okay, go ahead.
[1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:24.920]  Hello?
[1:09:24.920 --> 1:09:25.920]  Okay.
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:26.920]  Yeah, sure.
[1:09:26.920 --> 1:09:27.920]  You're on air.
[1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:28.920]  Go ahead.
[1:09:28.920 --> 1:09:29.920]  Okay.
[1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:33.440]  One, since you guys are talking about music, I just had a suggestion maybe that you guys
[1:09:33.440 --> 1:09:38.400]  should get Immortal Technique on for an interview because he's really big on the anti-New World
[1:09:38.400 --> 1:09:39.400]  Order thing as well.
[1:09:39.400 --> 1:09:45.360]  Yeah, I've interviewed Immortal Technique, he's a great artist and he actually gives
[1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:51.040]  a speech that is in Truth Rising, my 9-11 truth film, but that's a good idea.
[1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:53.040]  Anything else on your mind, Ron?
[1:09:53.040 --> 1:09:56.960]  I think he had another point that I wanted to get across.
[1:09:56.960 --> 1:10:02.520]  I recently flew to California through BWI and I heard you guys talking about the full
[1:10:02.520 --> 1:10:05.840]  body scanners and I didn't really know what they were really all about, so I actually
[1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:10.600]  got there and it looked like a big machine straight up to the fly, and so when I walked
[1:10:10.600 --> 1:10:15.120]  up there, the lady told me to step inside of it and I was like, and I wasn't going to
[1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:21.760]  do it, so I stepped inside and she told me that it was not required to go in there and
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:26.760]  that I could refuse it if I wanted to, and so knowing what they were all about, I refused
[1:10:26.760 --> 1:10:31.680]  it and then she told me to step aside in that little glass room and call the security guard
[1:10:31.680 --> 1:10:32.680]  over.
[1:10:32.680 --> 1:10:40.300]  Yes, everyone must refuse it because we've read official federal studies that the systems
[1:10:40.300 --> 1:10:43.520]  are cancer-causing, do bombard the DNA.
[1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:50.120]  They also record a 360 image of your naked body and they can get a biometric reading
[1:10:50.120 --> 1:10:53.400]  off of that to be able to track and trace you.
[1:10:53.400 --> 1:10:59.680]  This is all on record, 214 airports have installed them, are in the process of installing
[1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:00.680]  them.
[1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:02.040]  Thank you so much, Ron.
[1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:05.800]  Let's talk to Josh in California.
[1:11:05.800 --> 1:11:06.800]  Josh, you're on the air.
[1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:07.800]  Hey, what's going on, man?
[1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:11.520]  I want to tell you that I actually just started listening to you the last couple of weeks
[1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:14.800]  and I found you by watching Endgame, which I thought was absolutely brilliant.
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:18.560]  I think it's really ironic because the more stuff I've been reading on your site, especially
[1:11:18.560 --> 1:11:23.400]  when it comes to Copenhagen and the EPA, and I'm finding it so funny that now the EPA is
[1:11:23.400 --> 1:11:29.200]  coming out with trying to push this wall or the sanctions that if Congress won't pass
[1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:33.920]  a carbon tax and they're going to implement it, and I find it funny even going back to
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:37.880]  the water, the water discussion of why the EPA hasn't investigated that our water sources
[1:11:37.880 --> 1:11:41.480]  are just so contaminated with different chemicals, anything from arsenide.
[1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:42.480]  That's right.
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:45.760]  The EPA is ruled it's okay to have cyanide in the water.
[1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:51.920]  That's an article up on infowars.com, but carbon dioxide that we exhale that plants
[1:11:51.920 --> 1:11:58.080]  live off of, respirate from, is a deadly poison and you have an unelective bureaucracy who
[1:11:58.080 --> 1:12:02.760]  has declared that polar bears are endangered when they're not even threatening, their numbers
[1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:09.280]  are at all time records, they're exploding in numbers, and they say we don't care we're
[1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:15.640]  saying they're endangered, and they're saying we don't care what Congress says we're going
[1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:20.160]  to tax you, and so this is the rogue government.
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:25.000]  This is a government that does whatever it wants, whenever it wants, just like the private
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:29.440]  Federal Reserve says to Congress, we won't tell you we're $2 trillion of the money went.
[1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:31.720]  We're not going to tell you what we did with the bailout money.
[1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:33.960]  They do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:38.400]  It is a group of criminals, when are we going to wake up and say it's over?
[1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:42.120]  We're not going to fight over phony left and right issues, we're not going to be distracted
[1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:49.720]  by the puppet Obama or the puppet Republican they're out there pushing.
[1:12:49.720 --> 1:12:51.680]  We are not going to be part of this.
[1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:55.600]  We know what's really happening, a global corporate government.
[1:12:55.600 --> 1:12:56.600]  Anything else, Josh?
[1:12:56.600 --> 1:12:57.600]  Yeah, definitely.
[1:12:57.600 --> 1:13:00.840]  I want to tell you one last thing, is that my girlfriend has a paper that she's writing
[1:13:00.840 --> 1:13:05.480]  on 1984, and she was asking me all these questions about it, and I'm a little hesitant to talk
[1:13:05.480 --> 1:13:09.120]  about it, because the minute you start talking about this stuff, people think you're crazy,
[1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:14.040]  which is so funny, but I made her watch Endgame, and we talked after she watched it, she was
[1:13:14.040 --> 1:13:17.280]  absolutely blown away, because the first thing she said to me was, for the first time
[1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:22.080]  I got a non-biased account of truth, and she said I'm just fascinated at what's going on,
[1:13:22.080 --> 1:13:26.320]  so we started writing her paper, and I looked at her, and which is funny, because that gentleman
[1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:29.800]  had just called in and said he got failing grade, and I said her, don't be surprised
[1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:34.000]  if you get a failing grade on this paper, because what you're putting in here is the
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  truth.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.720]  Good job, my friend, good to hear from you, Josh.
[1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:40.880]  Let's talk to John in Wyoming, John, you're on the air.
[1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:45.680]  Yeah, Alex, I wanted to thank you too for being on George Norrie's program last night,
[1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:48.360]  but guess what happened, two important things.
[1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:52.480]  Just as George announced that you were going to be on the show, and for people to start
[1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:57.800]  calling in, all the telephones for the Bresnan communication system in Northern Wyoming went
[1:13:57.800 --> 1:13:58.800]  off.
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:03.960]  Well, I doubt, I mean, it was probably the snowstorm, I doubt they cut the telephones
[1:14:03.960 --> 1:14:06.320]  off so people couldn't call coast to coast.
[1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:12.240]  We only had a less than half an inch of snow up here in Sheridan, so it isn't the snow,
[1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:18.840]  because they came back up right after you went off the air, and secondly, I submitted
[1:14:18.840 --> 1:14:24.080]  a wonderful publication well-documented to the local paper here, the Sheridan Press,
[1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:30.640]  a week ago, pointing out how this global warming business is a fraud, an absolute fraud.
[1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:36.520]  I've detailed all-time record highs, all-time record lows, and how since January 1st of
[1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:42.760]  1985, while eight states have said or tied all-time record highs, 14 have said or tied
[1:14:42.760 --> 1:14:43.760]  all-time record lows.
[1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:49.000]  That's right, there's millions of different climate systems, over 1,000 in England alone,
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:52.560]  little subclimates, and you're always going to be having extreme weather in one place or
[1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:53.560]  the other.
[1:14:53.560 --> 1:14:59.280]  Yeah, and they refuse to publish it, and I can't get them to tell me why they won't
[1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:02.120]  publish this thing, it's all clearly documented.
[1:15:02.120 --> 1:15:06.520]  Well, even if they won't publish articles and documents, keep flooding newspapers and
[1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:12.800]  TV stations with emails and articles and physically mail it to them, physically fax it to them,
[1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:17.120]  because they'll be knee-deep in the truth, and a lot of people will wake up in the process.
[1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:18.440]  I appreciate your call, John.
[1:15:18.440 --> 1:15:20.520]  Tony in Florida, you're on the air.
[1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:23.560]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[1:15:23.560 --> 1:15:28.160]  I called you a while ago, I don't know if you remember me, I was a Brighthouse employee,
[1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:31.960]  and I heard that what was going on, and we were actually told to listen in on the phone
[1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:36.280]  calls and different things like that.
[1:15:36.280 --> 1:15:39.080]  Refresh my memory, told to listen into what phone calls.
[1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:44.440]  I was a Brighthouse Networks, Operation Bright Eyes, and you told me to start asking the
[1:15:44.440 --> 1:15:48.080]  technicians questions because they're kind of working to go into people's houses and
[1:15:48.080 --> 1:15:49.680]  spy on them and things like that.
[1:15:49.680 --> 1:15:54.560]  Oh, you're talking about, yeah, that's been in the Florida newspapers and in the other
[1:15:54.560 --> 1:16:01.920]  papers that cable companies are telling their cable technicians to spy on people for guns
[1:16:01.920 --> 1:16:07.440]  drugs, child abuse, whatever, and yes, I do remember that now.
[1:16:07.440 --> 1:16:08.440]  So what happened?
[1:16:08.440 --> 1:16:13.200]  Well, I had called your show about it as an employee, and I had told you about some things
[1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:17.440]  that I had heard management telling us to listen in on people's phone conversations,
[1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:21.600]  if we heard children crying in the background and stuff like that, ask questions.
[1:16:21.600 --> 1:16:25.320]  Well, you told me to start asking questions around work, so I started talking to some
[1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:28.720]  of the technicians and asking them what they're really doing and stuff like that.
[1:16:28.720 --> 1:16:34.040]  And I honestly didn't get a lot of good answers from it, but two weeks later, Alex, I got
[1:16:34.040 --> 1:16:36.960]  bored into my manager's office for no reason.
[1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:40.920]  Supervisors didn't even know it and was fired from the company.
[1:16:40.920 --> 1:16:46.080]  Well, of course, but no, I mean, for no, I mean, I'm a good employee, I was a good employee
[1:16:46.080 --> 1:16:51.000]  for them, but I mean, it definitely reaffirmed my belief in what's going on because, I mean,
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:55.600]  I was just asking some cool questions, I have a good employee record, and my supervisor,
[1:16:55.600 --> 1:17:00.200]  when we walked out there, his jaw was dropped, he goes, I had no idea you were being fired.
[1:17:00.200 --> 1:17:03.680]  I'm supposed to be told about these things because they're supposed to be, you know,
[1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:06.320]  he goes, he just sent me in there because he thought they wanted to talk.
[1:17:06.320 --> 1:17:10.080]  I walk in there, she said, we're going to terminate our contract with you.
[1:17:10.080 --> 1:17:13.240]  Did they say why they fired you?
[1:17:13.240 --> 1:17:17.680]  They said it's because there was one phone call that they heard me on where the person
[1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:22.000]  wanted to cancel their services, and they said I didn't try hard enough to retain the
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  services.
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:27.560]  Well, let's expand on this, I did pull up the article, or Jaren did, cable TV workers
[1:17:27.560 --> 1:17:31.400]  trained to spy on citizens, and it's a prisonplanet.com article.
[1:17:31.400 --> 1:17:36.640]  We have links to the mainstream news articles, but sir, this is at least 30 years old.
[1:17:36.640 --> 1:17:43.840]  Now it's just all of them, even small companies, and many, many of the foolish cable company
[1:17:43.840 --> 1:17:49.440]  workers and telephone people and carpet cleaners and others, they're not even told that the
[1:17:49.440 --> 1:17:55.920]  companies, even though this has been in USA today, are getting huge amounts of money.
[1:17:55.920 --> 1:18:02.960]  They're getting part of the fines or fees or rewards for what's happening.
[1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:08.760]  Now a lot of small companies, it's come out, small plumbing companies, carpet cleaning
[1:18:08.760 --> 1:18:12.160]  companies, construction companies.
[1:18:12.160 --> 1:18:16.120]  There have been news reports when it comes out, they try to keep it under wraps, where
[1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:24.800]  companies are making more money off of spying on people and getting bounty, getting booty
[1:18:24.800 --> 1:18:29.400]  for the police state, then they even make cleaning carpets or doing construction.
[1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:38.200]  And so yes, I mean, I saw reports on 60 minutes, it had to be 15 years ago of a famous case
[1:18:38.200 --> 1:18:44.920]  where this guy flew to Houston with cash, and he'd done it every year, he's got a discount
[1:18:44.920 --> 1:18:48.000]  if he did, but he put it on his tax forms and everything, he reported it on himself,
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  he had no freedom.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:55.040]  Yes, we hadn't done anything wrong to buy trees that he used in his landscaping business
[1:18:55.040 --> 1:18:58.600]  that were then shipped by 18 Wheeler across the state.
[1:18:58.600 --> 1:19:06.040]  And because he pulled out a bank bag that had $10,000 in it, they seized it, they took
[1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:08.120]  it and they said, you're just not allowed to have cash.
[1:19:08.120 --> 1:19:14.000]  And then they reported that $500 of that went to the lady behind the counter.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:18.360]  And then it was reported in that 60 minutes piece that that woman alone made more money
[1:19:18.360 --> 1:19:24.960]  that year off of stealing people's money under asset forage or seizure, no drugs, nothing
[1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:25.960]  illegal.
[1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:28.720]  Then she made as a ticket clerk.
[1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:36.960]  So this is the system, my friend, we are living in a total police state, just an absolute
[1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:38.640]  worse than East Germany.
[1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:40.600]  They just haven't shut down all the talk radio.
[1:19:40.600 --> 1:19:44.240]  See, we have the police state in place, the surveillance grid in place.
[1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:46.920]  They just haven't started all the mass arrest of political dissidents.
[1:19:46.920 --> 1:19:51.760]  You know, they set people up and stuff, but they're trying to build up their police force,
[1:19:51.760 --> 1:19:54.760]  their spy force to really start putting everybody in prison.
[1:19:54.760 --> 1:20:07.480]  But yes, we have a completely lawless, murdering criminal government ally with corporations.
[1:20:07.480 --> 1:20:15.400]  Still spraying chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and
[1:20:15.400 --> 1:20:19.080]  chemical fibers all falling from the sky.

[1:22:45.720 --> 1:22:48.520]  That's 888-292-2709.

[1:22:53.120 --> 1:23:01.080]  Half Dollar.
[1:23:01.080 --> 1:23:06.280]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters, thinking of calling a debt relief
[1:23:06.280 --> 1:23:07.280]  company?
[1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:08.280]  Don't.
[1:23:08.280 --> 1:23:11.200]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[1:23:11.200 --> 1:23:12.200]  Why pay?

[1:23:27.600 --> 1:23:28.600]  Here's Herb K.
[1:23:28.600 --> 1:23:32.720]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need
[1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:34.840]  to do it yourself for free.
[1:23:34.840 --> 1:23:36.080]  Herb K was right.

[1:23:39.280 --> 1:23:40.720]  What have you got to lose?
[1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:44.360]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt and have more money.
[1:23:44.360 --> 1:23:47.600]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free.
[1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:52.800]  Now call 888-352-7726.
[1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:59.800]  888-352-7726.
[1:23:59.800 --> 1:24:06.880]  888-352-7726.
[1:24:06.880 --> 1:24:11.160]  The National Security Council through FEMA and Homeland Security is set up an official
[1:24:11.160 --> 1:24:12.680]  dictator ship.
[1:24:12.680 --> 1:24:16.600]  Obama is now acting as an official dictator.
[1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:19.400]  This is Fox News, it's also in Reuters.
[1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:25.000]  Administration warns of command and control regulation over emissions.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:28.840]  The Obama Administration is warning Congress that if it doesn't move to regulate greenhouse
[1:24:28.840 --> 1:24:35.040]  gases, the Environmental Protection Agency, this is a quote, will take a quote, command
[1:24:35.040 --> 1:24:39.840]  and control role over the process in a way that could hurt businesses.
[1:24:39.840 --> 1:24:43.000]  The Obama Administration is warning Congress that if it doesn't move to regulate greenhouse
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:47.080]  gases, the Environmental Protection Agency will take a command and control role over
[1:24:47.080 --> 1:24:49.440]  the process in a way that could hurt business.
[1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:52.360]  Now why didn't Congress stand up against the out of control executive?
[1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:55.960]  Why won't the Third World do that, hearing they're going to have their energy cut by
[1:24:55.960 --> 1:24:59.080]  half because they're bought and paid for?
[1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:02.800]  The warning from top White House economic official who spoke Tuesday on condition of
[1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:07.960]  anonymity came on the eve of the EPA Administration's Lisa Jackson's address to the International
[1:25:07.960 --> 1:25:11.560]  Conference on Climate Change in Copenhagen, Denmark.
[1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:15.920]  Jackson, however, tried to strike a tone of cooperation in her address Wednesday, explaining
[1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:21.040]  that the EPA's new powers, new powers under the treaty, they haven't even signed yet.
[1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:25.800]  To regulate greenhouse gases will be used to complement legislation pending in Congress,
[1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:26.800]  not replace it.
[1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:30.640]  It's kind of like they haven't passed the healthcare government takeover bill yet, but
[1:25:30.640 --> 1:25:33.920]  they're already instructing state agencies to prepare for withholding from everyone's
[1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:35.920]  check.
[1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:41.040]  This is not an either or moment, it's a both and moment, she said.
[1:25:41.040 --> 1:25:43.920]  But while administration officials have long said they prefer Congress to take action on
[1:25:43.920 --> 1:25:48.600]  climate change, the economic official who spoke on reporters Tuesday night made clear
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:53.040]  that the EPA would not wait and is prepared to act on its own and quote, it won't be
[1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:54.040]  pretty.
[1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:58.160]  If you don't pass legislation, the EPA is going to have to regulate in this area, the
[1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:00.480]  official said.
[1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:04.800]  And it's not going to be able to regulate on a market-based way, so it's going to have
[1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:09.640]  to regulate in a command and control way, which will probably generate even more uncertainty.
[1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:14.400]  Yeah, they're telling the bigger corporations that aren't perfectly in line and smaller
[1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:16.840]  energy companies that are lobbying against it.
[1:26:16.840 --> 1:26:21.240]  Look, we're just going to do this and not let you make money on derivatives.
[1:26:21.240 --> 1:26:27.960]  Look, ExxonMobil, DutchrollShell, BP, Amaco, all these other big outfits, they're behind
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:28.960]  this.
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:30.680]  You better get in line.
[1:26:30.680 --> 1:26:35.000]  There's plenty of money that we're going to rob from the public for you if you join
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  in.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:39.760]  If you don't, you get nothing.
[1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:40.760]  Join us or die.
[1:26:40.760 --> 1:26:44.000]  It's like Darth Vader to Luke Skywalker.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:51.720]  I mean, it is in your face, gauntlet, in your face, and we have the unbelievably powerful
[1:26:51.720 --> 1:26:56.320]  Copenhagen Treaty Addendum, where it states the third world has to make right at double
[1:26:56.320 --> 1:26:57.480]  the cuts the first world.
[1:26:57.480 --> 1:26:58.720]  See, they sold the third world.
[1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:01.560]  Oh, you don't have to make any cuts.
[1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:07.960]  Only America and Europe and England and Japan, now they're going, oh, actually you've got
[1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:13.920]  to make double the cuts and you've got to get IMF and World Bank loans from us now.
[1:27:13.920 --> 1:27:17.960]  This is total dictatorship.
[1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:23.120]  The EPA, a federal agency telling Congress sit down and shut up because under Presidential
[1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:28.880]  Decision Directive 51, signed by Bush, continued by Obama, it states the President and the
[1:27:28.880 --> 1:27:31.520]  Security Council runs everything.
[1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:36.720]  For any economic reason, for any military reason, for any terror reason, it says we
[1:27:36.720 --> 1:27:42.960]  are in command and Congress can't even see the full text of PDD 51, Presidential Decision
[1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:44.280]  Directive 51.
[1:27:44.280 --> 1:27:49.120]  You can only see the cover sheet that says we are a dictatorship.
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:55.280]  This is a private, corporate, illegal, illegitimate takeover.
[1:27:55.280 --> 1:27:57.760]  But the police are just like the general public.
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:27:59.800]  The FPR are just like the general public.
[1:27:59.800 --> 1:28:01.720]  They don't know the three branches of government.
[1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:05.040]  All they know is their paycheck comes in and they go to the topless bar.
[1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:08.440]  All they know is their paycheck comes in and they go to the golf course.
[1:28:08.440 --> 1:28:12.920]  All they know is they do what they're told, they've got some petty power and they work
[1:28:12.920 --> 1:28:16.600]  for basically Kinley, Madoff types that are in control of this.
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:20.880]  And this is how tyranny works, unlimited.
[1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:26.720]  Once they drop the hammer in every case in history, they just steal everybody blind until
[1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:28.880]  everybody starts starving to death.
[1:28:28.880 --> 1:28:31.880]  And in the case of the globalists, they want you to starve to death.
[1:28:31.880 --> 1:28:34.960]  In the case of the globalists, they want you to die.
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:36.600]  You heard Lord Monkton break down the numbers.
[1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:42.280]  There's all the scientific studies that just the ethanol production for environmental reasons
[1:28:42.280 --> 1:28:45.640]  with crops has doubled world food prices.
[1:28:45.640 --> 1:28:50.400]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:53.040]  This is a complete takeover.
[1:28:53.040 --> 1:28:54.560]  I'm going to say it again.
[1:28:54.560 --> 1:29:00.000]  This is a complete economic slash paramilitary because the minute you don't pay these taxes,
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  the minute you try to get around them because you don't have the money to pay it, they are
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:04.520]  going to come arrest you.
[1:29:04.520 --> 1:29:09.280]  And if you resist, they're going to spray machine gun fire into your body and do high
[1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:12.880]  fives afterwards because they like to hunt.
[1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:17.800]  They've taken men's regular hunting instinct and their regular warfare instinct and they've
[1:29:17.800 --> 1:29:23.760]  turned the predatory nature of men loose on their own species and their own people.
[1:29:23.760 --> 1:29:25.480]  This is it.
[1:29:25.480 --> 1:29:26.480]  Spies everywhere.
[1:29:26.480 --> 1:29:32.120]  They're setting up domestic CIA forces to set people up, provocateurs, criminals.
[1:29:32.120 --> 1:29:38.600]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is the most hardcore criminal takeover you can imagine.
[1:29:38.600 --> 1:29:42.320]  They plan it to be as hot as Stalin, Mao or Hitler.
[1:29:42.320 --> 1:29:44.360]  You understand this is real.
[1:29:44.360 --> 1:29:47.840]  This is only the beginning of the absolute total tyranny.
[1:29:47.840 --> 1:29:51.440]  The day must stay an explosive interview on the other side.
[1:29:51.440 --> 1:29:55.160]  Where on the march, the empire's on the run.
[1:29:55.160 --> 1:30:02.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:02.080 --> 1:30:05.800]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[1:30:05.800 --> 1:30:08.960]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[1:30:08.960 --> 1:30:13.320]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[1:30:13.320 --> 1:30:14.320]  at home.
[1:30:14.320 --> 1:30:19.440]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress and they really are calling the
[1:30:19.440 --> 1:30:20.440]  shots.
[1:30:20.440 --> 1:30:25.200]  It's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:28.560]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[1:30:28.560 --> 1:30:34.400]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[1:30:34.400 --> 1:30:35.400]  world government.
[1:30:35.400 --> 1:30:37.840]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[1:30:37.840 --> 1:30:41.960]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[1:30:41.960 --> 1:30:47.320]  Today, it seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[1:30:47.320 --> 1:30:49.160]  a fall of the Republic.

[1:31:00.920 --> 1:31:03.560]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:31:03.560 --> 1:31:08.320]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[1:31:08.320 --> 1:31:09.320]  do you want?
[1:31:09.320 --> 1:31:11.320]  My answer would be all I can get.
[1:31:11.320 --> 1:31:16.320]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[1:31:16.320 --> 1:31:17.560]  How much do you want?
[1:31:17.560 --> 1:31:18.560]  When do you want it?
[1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:20.640]  Now or after the battle starts?
[1:31:20.640 --> 1:31:21.760]  When will you need it?
[1:31:21.760 --> 1:31:23.880]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:31:23.880 --> 1:31:25.240]  Will there be any food?
[1:31:25.240 --> 1:31:26.680]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:31:26.680 --> 1:31:30.840]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:31:30.840 --> 1:31:32.000]  and be immunized?
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:35.760]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:31:35.760 --> 1:31:39.360]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:31:39.360 --> 1:31:40.600]  How much will you need?
[1:31:40.600 --> 1:31:41.600]  We don't know.
[1:31:41.600 --> 1:31:42.600]  How much do you want?
[1:31:42.600 --> 1:31:43.600]  All you can get.
[1:31:43.600 --> 1:31:44.600]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:31:44.600 --> 1:31:52.280]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day, call 1-800-409-5633 or check it
[1:31:52.280 --> 1:32:00.000]  out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com, again that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:03.920]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[1:32:03.920 --> 1:32:06.840]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[1:32:06.840 --> 1:32:08.920]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[1:33:15.440 --> 1:33:20.520]  We have a reporter joining us in the last 30 minutes of the show today from Copenhagen
[1:33:20.520 --> 1:33:23.680]  to give us their take from a British perspective.
[1:33:23.680 --> 1:33:26.800]  We have climatologist Tim Ball joining us in an hour.
[1:33:26.800 --> 1:33:29.160]  We'll have open phones next hour.
[1:33:29.160 --> 1:33:33.560]  I have several clips of other world leaders calling for global government that are new
[1:33:33.560 --> 1:33:35.760]  that we're going to be playing.
[1:33:35.760 --> 1:33:36.760]  That's coming up.
[1:33:36.760 --> 1:33:40.880]  We also have a clip of Call of Duty, the best selling video game ever.
[1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:46.160]  It's made like $500 million in the first two weeks it's been out, where it shows Russians
[1:33:46.160 --> 1:33:51.720]  carrying out a false flag attack to start World War III just killing civilians.
[1:33:51.720 --> 1:33:56.840]  And people playing the game simulate being black ops staging false flags.
[1:33:56.840 --> 1:34:01.760]  This is how everyone's just being bathed in evil and being desensitized to commit
[1:34:01.760 --> 1:34:04.520]  acts of murder.
[1:34:04.520 --> 1:34:07.720]  We are a society being mind controlled.
[1:34:07.720 --> 1:34:11.840]  And again, here is the exclusive interview I did last week in Dallas, Texas with Dave
[1:34:11.840 --> 1:34:16.520]  Mustaine, invited us up to Dallas.
[1:34:16.520 --> 1:34:20.880]  The founder of Megadeth, of course formerly with Metallica, is best selling album out
[1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:22.800]  right now in-game.

[1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:48.960]  We'll go to break and come back with the rest of it after break.
[1:34:48.960 --> 1:35:16.960]  And here it is, Dave Mustaine of Megadeth.
[1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:42.960]  We're here with Megadeth, Dave Mustaine, there he is.
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:36:00.360]  Dave, it's been great interviewing you on the radio, but to be with you in person is
[1:36:00.360 --> 1:36:01.360]  even better.
[1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:02.360]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:03.360]  Thanks for doing the interview.
[1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:06.200]  Yeah, I'm really happy to be talking to you.
[1:36:06.200 --> 1:36:07.200]  How's the tour going?
[1:36:07.200 --> 1:36:08.400]  The tour has been going really great.
[1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:13.880]  Machine has a great band, play them on my station, and Suicide Silence is a new band
[1:36:13.880 --> 1:36:16.640]  that a lot of people are finding a lot of interest in.
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:22.360]  And the guy's in the opening band, Arcadium, very interesting band too.
[1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:23.360]  I like the front man.
[1:36:23.360 --> 1:36:27.120]  He's very, very, very timid backstage when he gets out on stage.
[1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:30.920]  He really, besides the fact he looks like he weighs about 80 pounds, he really has got
[1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:33.640]  a great persona and I was surprised.
[1:36:33.640 --> 1:36:38.640]  So I think that band's going to have some good things if he eats a couple of cheeseburgers,
[1:36:38.640 --> 1:36:39.640]  you know.
[1:36:39.640 --> 1:37:06.640]  And I think that's going to be a great thing if he eats a couple of cheeseburgers.
[1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:34.640]  Yeah, I think that's going to be a great thing.
[1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:44.920]  In-game, it's getting just incredible reviews everywhere.
[1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:48.480]  I was in a coffee shop today and just opened up a Dallas Observer and there were two just
[1:37:48.480 --> 1:37:53.400]  raving reviews saying it's one of your best albums ever and a really avant-garde.
[1:37:53.400 --> 1:37:56.080]  What is the message of in-game?
[1:37:56.080 --> 1:38:00.760]  Well a lot of people thought that that was signifying the end of my career because I've
[1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:07.760]  got issues with my skeleton manners and stuff like that, with head banging and stuff.
[1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:12.040]  With the way that the music business is right now with the record companies finally getting
[1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:18.600]  what they deserve, it's interesting because the music industry is falling as quickly as
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:23.960]  we're talking about, you know, that watching, again it's corporate greed in America because
[1:38:23.960 --> 1:38:28.360]  it's all the big conglomerate record companies and, you know, like for example EMI is owned
[1:38:28.360 --> 1:38:31.080]  by Thorne from what I know and they make the warheads.
[1:38:31.080 --> 1:38:35.400]  So, you know, there's a lot of weirdness with who owns the record labels and stuff like
[1:38:35.400 --> 1:38:36.400]  that.
[1:38:36.400 --> 1:38:37.400]  I love EMI but I had no idea.
[1:38:37.400 --> 1:38:40.960]  I talked to Jellaby Offer from the Dead Kennedys and I asked him to do a side project with
[1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:43.240]  me and he goes, no wait man, you're on EMI.
[1:38:43.240 --> 1:38:44.240]  Those guys make bombs.
[1:38:44.240 --> 1:38:45.880]  And I was like, what?
[1:38:45.880 --> 1:38:46.880]  So I had no idea.
[1:38:46.880 --> 1:38:50.720]  And of course he told me that Oldsmobile made machine guns for the Nazis too and stuff
[1:38:50.720 --> 1:38:55.160]  like that which totally tricked me out but I had no idea.
[1:38:55.160 --> 1:38:58.600]  Well pretty much everything in one way or another is a subsidiary of the military industrial
[1:38:58.600 --> 1:38:59.600]  complex.
[1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:01.600]  It's been like that since the days of Eisenhower.
[1:39:01.600 --> 1:39:07.240]  So as long as the message is getting out, I think that's actually to the anger of the
[1:39:07.240 --> 1:39:08.240]  establishment.
[1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:11.840]  Well I had a guy from the UN actually call me up, well not call me up but he said something
[1:39:11.840 --> 1:39:15.560]  about United Abominations and this shows how pea-brain this guy was.
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:20.200]  At the very end after he tried to discredit me he says besides I'm a Metallica fan anyways
[1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:24.600]  and I thought, what a twat, you know, because I mean, you know, I am part Metallica.
[1:39:24.600 --> 1:39:25.760]  So what are you saying?
[1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:29.160]  That's like going up to somebody who's mulatto and saying they don't have white or black
[1:39:29.160 --> 1:39:30.160]  in them.
[1:39:30.160 --> 1:39:31.920]  You know, I am part Metallica.
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:36.240]  So for him to say that it just shows you why most of the people up there don't know what
[1:39:36.240 --> 1:39:40.120]  they're doing because you have people that are representing stuff saying childish things
[1:39:40.120 --> 1:39:41.120]  like that.
[1:39:41.120 --> 1:39:42.120]  That's sandbox mentality.
[1:39:42.120 --> 1:39:58.840]  So whatever that is, that's what they're doing.
[1:39:58.840 --> 1:40:06.480]  You know?
[1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:10.800]  That's what Americans do.
[1:40:10.800 --> 1:40:17.800]  When you talk about in-game, you talk about these greedy corrupt megacorporations from your own research, what do you believe their in-game is?
[1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:25.800]  Well, I believe it's the same thing you and I both believe. Me as a Christian, I believe that it's one world government, one world currency.
[1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:33.800]  And, you know, it's part of my belief. I said so in Holy Wars, you know, it's part of the master plan. It's what I believe.
[1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:41.800]  I ascribed to that when I became a Christian. I know that there's going to be a cataclysmic ramping up of all of these things that we're seeing right now,
[1:40:42.800 --> 1:40:46.800]  and it gets worse and it gets worse and it gets worse, and we're watching our country disintegrate right now, and it's scary.
[1:40:47.800 --> 1:40:51.800]  You know, when I start thinking that I'm going to be moving with Sean Drover back up to Canada, that's scary, you know.
[1:40:52.800 --> 1:40:58.800]  And that's what in-game is all about. It's about educating our fans and showing them a little bit about what's going on within the previous administration.
[1:40:58.800 --> 1:41:07.800]  And, you know, just things haven't changed at all, and it's just more of this whole people being run by the people who have the money.
[1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:22.800]  I've heard something that when we had the dollars performed, it had red ink on it.
[1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:25.800]  Tell me that story. I'd heard that that was Kennedy was supposed to...
[1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:30.800]  No, that's true. He was going to get rid of the Federal Reserve, and he made the money with red ink, and that's part of my...
[1:41:31.800 --> 1:41:40.800]  You can go into any coin shop, Dave, and say, I want a Lincoln Greenback issued by Kennedy, and you'll probably have to pay $20, $30 for it because it's a collector,
[1:41:41.800 --> 1:41:46.800]  and they'll go under the counter and they'll pull it out, and it has a red seal, but more importantly, and it was only fives.
[1:41:46.800 --> 1:41:56.800]  He only issued the first $4 billion, and when you read on the top of it, it says, United States note, nowhere does it say Federal Reserve,
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:42:03.800]  so it was pre-1913 when the private banks took over, and he signed the executive order to fully phase out,
[1:42:04.800 --> 1:42:09.800]  because he didn't want to do it overnight because that would cause some problems, to fully phase out the private banks that had taken over the issuance of currency and credit,
[1:42:09.800 --> 1:42:16.800]  and from talking to all the top real researchers on JFK, it wasn't making the decision to pull it out of Vietnam.
[1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:20.800]  That was part of it. It wasn't the decision to stop trying to have war with the Soviets.
[1:42:21.800 --> 1:42:28.800]  It wasn't the decision to not continue to pay up pigs. The main reason they killed him was what you just said, because he was going to take the power away from the money changers.
[1:42:29.800 --> 1:42:30.800]  That's what I heard.
[1:42:31.800 --> 1:42:33.800]  In fact, I'll mail you a Lincoln Greenback.
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:38.800]  I'll take it.
[1:42:43.800 --> 1:42:44.800]  That's when you got Lincoln killed.
[1:42:45.800 --> 1:42:53.800]  The Rothschilds and others came to him and said, we'll loan you money at 30% interest to fight the war, which they were financing in the south of the British to destabilize the country.
[1:42:54.800 --> 1:42:59.800]  This is all in mainline history, but not popularly taught, and he said, no way. I'll just start issuing our own money again.
[1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:08.800]  As soon as the war ended, they killed him over that again. That's why it's called the Lincoln Greenback, because that was the last time since Andrew Jackson didn't money been issued.
[1:43:09.800 --> 1:43:14.800]  So he didn't have to go get a law passed. Kennedy could say, well, as president, I can reissue any currency that's already been out there.
[1:43:15.800 --> 1:43:17.800]  That got him killed, but I don't want to sit here and give a history lesson.
[1:43:17.800 --> 1:43:29.800]  No, that's good, because it'll probably end up in a song. You heard it here first.
[1:43:30.800 --> 1:43:37.800]  This is the pick of the week by the Dallas Observer for all the concerts going on in Dallas, and it's Justin's pick of the week.
[1:43:37.800 --> 1:43:54.800]  And he says, Megadeth, who recently put out their masterwork with In Game, a relentless assault on corruption, FDIC, military occupations, and the mind-scramble of today's world gone insane, with Dave Mustaine's articulate and spiteful delivery and blistering guitar work.
[1:43:55.800 --> 1:44:02.800]  You may need to be spiteful on the other, and it just goes on from there. Is that an accurate snapshot of the album?
[1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:13.800]  I don't agree with the spiteful part, but yeah, I think so. It's certainly about the topics, but I think any 10-year-old can read the lyrics and say that's what this is all about.
[1:44:14.800 --> 1:44:19.800]  It's much more deeper than that. Each one of those songs, it is about those things, but it's so much more deeper.
[1:44:20.800 --> 1:44:25.800]  It's not like me just sitting on the fence and casting aspersions. It's really getting into the game and saying, this is what it feels like to take a hit.
[1:44:25.800 --> 1:44:40.800]  I know from first hand with being involved in the money business, when I went to school to be a stockbroker, there's things that I learned about money that they just don't teach people, and they want to keep people stupid.
[1:44:40.800 --> 1:44:56.800]  I had that song, The Right to Go Insane, and those lyrics are actually toned down, because I went naming people's names and all kinds of stuff like that in the first version of it.
[1:44:56.800 --> 1:45:11.800]  That demo tape, if it ever gets circulated, it'll probably make a lot of people pissed.
[1:45:27.800 --> 1:45:37.800]  We figure the songs out while we're here. When we do something like this, we get the song in pieces. This is the rhythm track.
[1:45:41.800 --> 1:45:47.800]  I have to learn it again, because the last time I played it was in the studio, and then get the solos.
[1:45:47.800 --> 1:45:55.800]  That's what the solo sounds like, soloed out.
[1:45:56.800 --> 1:45:57.800]  Another solo.
[1:45:57.800 --> 1:46:11.800]  Dave's solo. No Chris solo there. Here's another one.
[1:46:11.800 --> 1:46:28.800]  You just keep going back and forth over it until you figure it out. And then the whole thing sounds like this.
[1:46:28.800 --> 1:46:43.800]  I feel right now we're sitting on the quintessential lineup, and I think that my songwriting hasn't even been tapped yet, because of what just happened with our new guitar player, Chris, coming in.
[1:46:44.800 --> 1:46:52.800]  Chris is a genius, and he's an unrealized talent, and it's real easy, because if you go over and you scratch him, he kind of bleeds music, and so that was really cool for me.
[1:46:52.800 --> 1:47:06.800]  We had a ballad on the record called the hardest part of letting go. I wrote about me and my wife Pam. She hates the song, consequently, because the second half is about Edgar Allen Poe, you know, the Casco Montiato, where he takes a fortune auto down into the cellars, and he bricks him into the wall.
[1:47:07.800 --> 1:47:12.800]  He's a mirroring into the wall, and I put that in the lyric, and my wife thinks I want to brick her into a wall somewhere, so she didn't like the song.
[1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:21.800]  But, you know, we wrote that, and Chris actually contributed on that, and it went from being a good song to being something that was really a masterpiece.
[1:47:22.800 --> 1:47:31.800]  I don't say that because I was involved in it, and I say it because the song really is that way. I used to listen to it, and I would get really emotional because of what it meant for me with finding my soulmate.
[1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:49.800]  And this thing is she said she didn't like it. I couldn't stand hearing it anymore, so I got over that, and I like listening to it again, but you know, to know that we have this potential as a guitar team, and that we can get into some really mind-blowing stuff, because when Chris came in, you know, a lot of this stuff was already written.
[1:47:49.800 --> 1:48:01.800]  We haven't had a chance to really explore what all his talents are yet.
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:42.800]  Can you tell us just about the cover?
[1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:59.800]  Yeah. Well, obviously, those are the FEMA coffins that everybody's talking about, being in the Midwest, and I haven't seen it myself, but, you know, I've seen pictures, and, you know, we had this symbology that was like the Hebrews being marched through the Red Sea,
[1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:14.800]  and all the people that are in the Homeland Security jumpsuits with the barcode on their head, you know, it doesn't say in the Bible if the barcode is going to be going this way or if it's going to be going this way, so I figured, you know, you would do something kind of like some cool imagery stuff, you know.
[1:49:15.800 --> 1:49:16.800]  No way the satellites can see it from on top.
[1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:33.800]  Maybe, yeah, perhaps, but I thought about that. How can we make this kind of look cool? We'll make it look like a Mohawk, but then when you zoom in on it, it's actually their barcode, and we put around the surrounding parts of it because, you know, I was really, when I got saved, I really wanted to know what I was doing,
[1:49:34.800 --> 1:49:40.800]  and I didn't want to just blindly say, okay, I'm a Christian, what do I do, okay, 10%, okay, good, see you later, you know, whatever.
[1:49:40.800 --> 1:49:52.800]  So I actually really read a lot of the Bible and stuff, and one of the things that I noticed was in the story back with the Egyptians and stuff, that out of all the plagues that happened, one of them was with the flies,
[1:49:53.800 --> 1:50:07.800]  and the flies got on everybody except for the Hebrews, and it was just really insane to see that the chosen people had been left out of this really vile plague that had happened, and it was just one thing that just kind of went around the outside of the picture.
[1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:18.800]  So in the top of it, there's kind of like a Stargate kind of sunburst there where people are going off to this light that they're being led off, like come to the light, and what is the Poltergeist movie about?
[1:50:19.800 --> 1:50:25.800]  Alright, we're going to come back and finish up with the interview. It'll take two segments to finish it, and we've got even more footage.
[1:50:26.800 --> 1:50:33.800]  We hung out with Dave for like four hours. I showed up, said hi, wanted to do the interview, wanted to get out of his hair, and he's like, no, hang out, stay, we're going to rehearse.
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:44.800]  And so they sat there and played for two hours, and then said, hey, stay, film the concert, and I was like, yeah, I want to stay, but I got to drive back to Austin, so we got back at 3am from Dallas.
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:54.800]  But to see Dave Mustaine really growing, really waking up in the New World Order, he's going to be a powerful force in waking people up. We're very excited. We'll be right back.
[1:50:54.800 --> 1:50:57.800]  That's it. Hold your ride back.

[1:53:57.400 --> 1:54:06.560]  Greetings and health and wellness from Excalibur Dehydrator.
[1:54:06.560 --> 1:54:11.800]  Okay, we are simulcasting the radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv, premiering this exclusive
[1:54:11.800 --> 1:54:16.200]  interview with Dave Mustaine in Dallas, Texas of Megadeth. And we'll finish up with the
[1:54:16.200 --> 1:54:20.160]  interview in this segment and the next. Then I'm going to get into other world leaders
[1:54:20.160 --> 1:54:25.640]  calling for global governance, demonizing those of us that expose this giant fraud by
[1:54:25.640 --> 1:54:30.280]  the IMF and World Bank where they're making the gases that animals and plants breathe
[1:54:30.280 --> 1:54:35.480]  toxic waste so they can tax to control our lives. That's coming up then climatologist
[1:54:35.480 --> 1:54:41.880]  Tim Ball. And we also have a reporter joining us from Copenhagen, Denmark, as world government
[1:54:41.880 --> 1:54:46.320]  is being established. But back to Dave Mustaine.
[1:54:46.320 --> 1:54:50.040]  In the top of it, there's kind of like a Stargate kind of sunburst there where people
[1:54:50.040 --> 1:54:54.280]  are going off to this light that they're being led off like, come to the light and what's
[1:54:54.280 --> 1:54:57.360]  the polar guys moving around? It's really a bug zapper.
[1:54:57.360 --> 1:55:00.280]  With the rest of the record, you know, when you look inside of it, there's a lot of other
[1:55:00.280 --> 1:55:05.080]  stuff in there like the symbol. We've got the one person who's covered in flies, which
[1:55:05.080 --> 1:55:08.040]  you know, kids kind of gravitate towards that kind of artwork. They like stuff that's
[1:55:08.040 --> 1:55:12.040]  like that, you know, graphic stuff. And we've got other pictures of Vic actually pulling
[1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:15.840]  the hood off of this person and showing that, you know, he's actually a victim. And you
[1:55:15.840 --> 1:55:23.320]  know, he's either Vic is saving him or not, you know, and I look at it like this. He's
[1:55:23.320 --> 1:55:27.640]  kind of like saying, what are you doing under there? Let's get out of this situation. You
[1:55:27.640 --> 1:55:34.920]  know, I consider myself to be alone as far as, you know, in our genre with people who
[1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:39.240]  really are willing to go out and stand on a limb and say, you know what, you can hate
[1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:42.200]  me if you want, but at the end of the day, I'm going to do what's right. Because doing
[1:55:42.200 --> 1:55:47.440]  what's right isn't popular. It's not. And that's why people, you know, they like to
[1:55:47.440 --> 1:55:51.960]  take punch shots at me. But at the end of the day, you know, I do a lot of stuff that
[1:55:51.960 --> 1:55:55.440]  I know I'm not going to have any conscious. I'm not going to have any problems with myself
[1:55:55.440 --> 1:55:58.200]  when I go to sleep at night, you know, because I see people do stuff and they compromise
[1:55:58.200 --> 1:56:01.480]  themselves and they sing songs and they think that they're not going to affect them. You
[1:56:01.480 --> 1:56:05.400]  know, you say that stuff and it comes out of your mouth and you portray that stuff to
[1:56:05.400 --> 1:56:08.440]  other young minds and they hear that stuff, they believe that, you know, I don't want
[1:56:08.440 --> 1:56:11.200]  to be responsible for making anybody stumble. I want to make sure that they become better
[1:56:11.200 --> 1:56:34.800]  people.
[1:56:34.800 --> 1:56:36.800]  I'll be dead.
[1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:38.800]  You guys see fingers, come on, you're back.
[1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:02.800]  In the final equation
[1:57:02.800 --> 1:57:05.800]  you've spoken about a transformation
[1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:06.800]  or awakening.
[1:57:06.800 --> 1:57:08.800]  Can you tell us, was that overnight
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:09.800]  or was that a process
[1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:11.800]  or was that just going back to something
[1:57:11.800 --> 1:57:12.800]  you were at your core?
[1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:14.800]  I mean, can you speak about
[1:57:14.800 --> 1:57:17.800]  the changes in your life?
[1:57:17.800 --> 1:57:19.800]  Yeah, it was pretty simple.
[1:57:19.800 --> 1:57:20.800]  I've always believed in God.
[1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:22.800]  That's why the first line of peace sells
[1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:23.800]  but who's buying says what do you mean?
[1:57:23.800 --> 1:57:24.800]  I don't believe in God.
[1:57:24.800 --> 1:57:25.800]  I talk to him every day.
[1:57:25.800 --> 1:57:27.800]  When I was a kid I was baptized as a Luther
[1:57:27.800 --> 1:57:29.800]  and I was four and my mom had become
[1:57:29.800 --> 1:57:31.800]  a Jehovah's Witness when I was seven
[1:57:31.800 --> 1:57:32.800]  which totally ruined my life.
[1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:34.800]  And then by the time I turned 15
[1:57:34.800 --> 1:57:36.800]  I was so full of bitterness and
[1:57:36.800 --> 1:57:38.800]  just hatred for organized religion
[1:57:38.800 --> 1:57:40.800]  that I got into black magic
[1:57:40.800 --> 1:57:42.800]  and went down the route of the occult.
[1:57:42.800 --> 1:57:44.800]  And although I didn't pursue being a Satanist
[1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:47.800]  I was very much agnostic
[1:57:47.800 --> 1:57:49.800]  and probably more atheist than I was
[1:57:49.800 --> 1:57:51.800]  anything because I just didn't want
[1:57:51.800 --> 1:57:53.800]  to believe anymore because I was
[1:57:53.800 --> 1:57:54.800]  so spiritually abused.
[1:57:54.800 --> 1:57:56.800]  So when the time came when my arm
[1:57:56.800 --> 1:57:58.800]  had gotten destroyed in 2002
[1:57:58.800 --> 1:58:00.800]  I had that terrible nerve damage
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:02.800]  to this hand and oddly it was this one
[1:58:02.800 --> 1:58:04.800]  and anything else would have happened
[1:58:04.800 --> 1:58:05.800]  to my body.
[1:58:05.800 --> 1:58:06.800]  I could have had a leg cut off
[1:58:06.800 --> 1:58:07.800]  and I still would have kept playing
[1:58:07.800 --> 1:58:09.800]  but my money maker here stopped working.
[1:58:09.800 --> 1:58:11.800]  I had to go okay what am I doing wrong
[1:58:11.800 --> 1:58:13.800]  here because there was a lot of stuff
[1:58:13.800 --> 1:58:14.800]  that was going on.
[1:58:14.800 --> 1:58:16.800]  And I was on a hill and I saw a cross
[1:58:16.800 --> 1:58:18.800]  and I looked at it and I just went
[1:58:18.800 --> 1:58:19.800]  what have I got to lose?
[1:58:19.800 --> 1:58:20.800]  I've tried everything else.
[1:58:20.800 --> 1:58:21.800]  What have I got to lose?
[1:58:21.800 --> 1:58:23.800]  Six simple words and I became a Christian
[1:58:23.800 --> 1:58:25.800]  and I see the people that people
[1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:28.800]  don't like that are the hypocristians.
[1:58:28.800 --> 1:58:29.800]  You know what I mean?
[1:58:29.800 --> 1:58:30.800]  Yeah I made that up.
[1:58:30.800 --> 1:58:34.800]  So I look at that and I'm
[1:58:34.800 --> 1:58:37.800]  not attracted to that and I see
[1:58:37.800 --> 1:59:06.800]  people that gravitate towards you.
[1:59:08.800 --> 1:59:10.800]  I see people that're not even
[1:59:10.800 --> 1:59:17.800]  expensive.
[1:59:17.800 --> 1:59:19.800]  I use TBR 20 for arthritis in my hand
[1:59:19.800 --> 1:59:20.800]  and it works great.
[1:59:20.800 --> 1:59:22.800]  It relieves the pain fast and fights
[1:59:22.800 --> 1:59:24.800]  the inflammation to keep the pain
[1:59:24.800 --> 1:59:25.800]  away longer.
[1:59:25.800 --> 1:59:27.800]  On TBR 20 info.com you can read

[1:59:29.800 --> 1:59:31.800]  arthritis, fibromyalgia, sports

[1:59:38.440 --> 2:00:05.540]  Waging War on Corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:05.540 --> 2:00:30.980]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to play the conclusion of the live Dave Mustaine
[2:00:30.980 --> 2:00:37.080]  interview I did in Dallas last week, the in-person interview, then we're going to come back and
[2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:41.880]  get into the establishment of world government and the open announcement of planetary government
[2:00:41.880 --> 2:00:47.680]  and the nature of this world government is now completely uncloked out in the open, your
[2:00:47.680 --> 2:00:53.320]  phone calls and a lot more coming up and climatologist Tim Ball.
[2:00:53.320 --> 2:00:57.980]  But this is Dave Mustaine talking about his awakening to the New World Order, his awakening
[2:00:57.980 --> 2:01:02.880]  becoming a Christian and very, very powerful stuff.
[2:01:02.880 --> 2:01:06.880]  Obviously we've been playing it in chunks because of the radio commercials and ads,
[2:01:06.880 --> 2:01:14.480]  but at PrismPlanet.tv right now it's been posted the unedited, continued piece in one
[2:01:14.480 --> 2:01:18.600]  one continuum, one piece at PrismPlanet.tv.
[2:01:18.600 --> 2:01:21.380]  Here is the conclusion of Dave Mustaine.
[2:01:21.380 --> 2:01:26.360]  I see the people that people don't like that are the hypocristians, you know what I mean?
[2:01:26.360 --> 2:01:27.360]  That's a good term.
[2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:35.920]  So I look at that and I'm not attracted to that and I see people that gravitate towards
[2:01:35.920 --> 2:01:41.360]  me, towards my family, they want to be with us because they say certain hard luck stories
[2:01:41.360 --> 2:01:42.360]  and we'll feel sorry for them.
[2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:47.480]  I'll feel sorry for you, but you ain't getting it, unless it's real, they're not getting
[2:01:47.480 --> 2:02:04.080]  in.
[2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:09.900]  Made Us Radio is a non-stop AV metal 24 hours a day, seven days a week and except for the
[2:02:09.900 --> 2:02:13.360]  Halloween show we put on and the Christmas music we're going to be adding towards around
[2:02:13.360 --> 2:02:14.860]  Christmas time.
[2:02:14.860 --> 2:02:19.440]  It's just standard heavy metal classics that I like, a couple of zingers weird stuff like
[2:02:19.440 --> 2:02:24.480]  BB King and Muddy Waters and some old stuff like that, like Stevie Rave on and some of
[2:02:24.480 --> 2:02:29.120]  the blues that inspired me and then some of the older stuff that I liked as a kid growing
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:34.720]  up, Elton John, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles and stuff like that, but you'll also see bands
[2:02:34.720 --> 2:02:38.360]  like Gore there and that's not one of my favorite bands, I don't like them at all, but they're
[2:02:38.360 --> 2:02:42.200]  the guys in the band too, they're bands that the other guys have picked that they like
[2:02:42.200 --> 2:02:45.560]  and it's a Megadeth station, it's not a Dave Mustaine station, although I did a lot of
[2:02:45.560 --> 2:02:50.320]  the work in the beginning, we're all participating now and I think you can tell because the playlist
[2:02:50.320 --> 2:02:54.160]  is so eclectic, you can listen to that all day long and you'll discover all kinds of great
[2:02:54.160 --> 2:02:55.160]  new music.
[2:02:55.160 --> 2:03:08.840]  Anything else you'd like to add to the audience out there?
[2:03:08.840 --> 2:03:11.320]  I love you, you can believe it all.
[2:03:11.320 --> 2:03:14.200]  Dave Mustaine, thank you so much for talking to us.
[2:03:14.200 --> 2:03:15.200]  You're welcome Alex.
[2:03:15.200 --> 2:03:16.200]  Appreciate it.
[2:03:16.200 --> 2:03:17.200]  Thanks buddy.
[2:03:17.200 --> 2:03:18.200]  You bet.
[2:03:18.200 --> 2:03:46.160]  Alright ladies and gentlemen and the crew did a great job, Rob Dew, Rob Jacobson, myself,
[2:03:46.160 --> 2:03:51.000]  the three of us went up there and the video looks great, I mean that was off a DVD we
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:56.240]  burned and the machine was of course breaking up a little bit there at the end and pausing,
[2:03:56.240 --> 2:04:01.320]  but for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers you can really see it in the highest quality and just see
[2:04:01.320 --> 2:04:05.800]  what a great job our crew did and how great Megadeth was and our interview with Dave.
[2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:09.320]  We've got a little bit more of the interview, we'll probably post that in the next few weeks
[2:04:09.320 --> 2:04:15.640]  but that was a little compilation of the evening we put together for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers
[2:04:15.640 --> 2:04:17.400]  and the radio audience.
[2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:24.600]  At the same time, it's a little bit lighter fare in the middle of the Copenhagen world
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:29.240]  government takeover but I was thinking during the break it's hard for me to keep this level
[2:04:29.240 --> 2:04:30.800]  of intensity up.
[2:04:30.800 --> 2:04:35.400]  I'm upset, I'm focused, I want to defeat the New World Order, it's so incredible what's
[2:04:35.400 --> 2:04:41.440]  happening but how do we get the public to awake when even those of us that know what's
[2:04:41.440 --> 2:04:46.000]  happening at a certain subconscious level have just accepted it.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:51.040]  We have to consciously say we do not accept these criminals running our society.
[2:04:51.040 --> 2:04:54.240]  Want to thank Dave Mustaine for having us up to Dallas, it was a great time.
[2:04:54.240 --> 2:05:01.400]  Thank you Dave, we'll be right back with a lot more, stay with us.
[2:05:01.400 --> 2:05:06.040]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[2:05:06.040 --> 2:05:07.040]  you to eat.
[2:05:07.040 --> 2:05:10.560]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[2:05:10.560 --> 2:05:13.500]  sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[2:05:13.500 --> 2:05:16.560]  You don't have to cooperate, there is a solution.

[2:06:04.840 --> 2:06:05.840]  generator.
[2:06:05.840 --> 2:06:10.280]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:06:10.280 --> 2:06:14.600]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:06:14.600 --> 2:06:15.880]  allows you to have.
[2:06:15.880 --> 2:06:21.600]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:06:21.600 --> 2:06:25.960]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[2:06:25.960 --> 2:06:29.920]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:06:29.920 --> 2:06:33.440]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:06:33.440 --> 2:06:37.160]  Over a year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[2:06:37.160 --> 2:06:41.880]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:06:41.880 --> 2:06:45.680]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:06:45.680 --> 2:06:47.080]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[2:07:01.760 --> 2:07:04.800]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:07:04.800 --> 2:07:09.160]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[2:07:09.160 --> 2:07:10.160]  do you want?
[2:07:10.160 --> 2:07:12.160]  My answer would be all I can get.
[2:07:12.160 --> 2:07:17.200]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[2:07:17.200 --> 2:07:18.400]  How much do you want?
[2:07:18.400 --> 2:07:19.400]  When do you want it?
[2:07:19.400 --> 2:07:21.440]  Now or after the battle starts.
[2:07:21.440 --> 2:07:22.560]  When will you need it?
[2:07:22.560 --> 2:07:24.680]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:07:24.680 --> 2:07:26.040]  Will there be any food?
[2:07:26.040 --> 2:07:27.480]  Will it make your children sick?
[2:07:27.480 --> 2:07:31.600]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[2:07:31.600 --> 2:07:32.780]  and be immunized?
[2:07:32.780 --> 2:07:36.560]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:07:36.560 --> 2:07:40.160]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:07:40.160 --> 2:07:41.400]  How much will you need?
[2:07:41.400 --> 2:07:42.400]  We don't know.
[2:07:42.400 --> 2:07:43.400]  How much do you want?
[2:07:43.400 --> 2:07:44.400]  All you can get.
[2:07:44.400 --> 2:07:45.400]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:07:45.400 --> 2:07:48.640]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[2:07:48.640 --> 2:07:56.120]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:07:56.120 --> 2:08:03.120]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:08:27.120 --> 2:08:33.000]  Articles written by Ban Ki-moon, head of the UN, saying global government is being established
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:37.160]  in 2009 at Copenhagen, total control over the planet.
[2:08:37.160 --> 2:08:41.080]  But a few weeks ago, just a few days before, Climate Gate broke.
[2:08:41.080 --> 2:08:46.080]  The emails proving that the top UN scientists were fudging the numbers, covering up that
[2:08:46.080 --> 2:08:49.320]  the temperature has been getting colder for the last nine years.
[2:08:49.320 --> 2:08:51.660]  They know full well carbon dioxide isn't bad.
[2:08:51.660 --> 2:08:55.400]  They know full well that humans put off almost none of the carbon dioxide with all of our
[2:08:55.400 --> 2:08:56.400]  industry.
[2:08:56.400 --> 2:08:57.400]  The numbers are there.
[2:08:57.400 --> 2:09:00.560]  It's like one-two-thousandth of the total carbon dioxide increase they think is from
[2:09:00.560 --> 2:09:02.120]  humans or even less.
[2:09:02.120 --> 2:09:04.960]  That's an inflated number.
[2:09:04.960 --> 2:09:13.160]  And Kevin Rudd, the prime minister of Australia, has been attacking Lord Christopher Monkton.
[2:09:13.160 --> 2:09:16.200]  He's been attacking the climate change denialist.
[2:09:16.200 --> 2:09:20.160]  We played an IBM TV ad yesterday where they said, if you're not for the climate change
[2:09:20.160 --> 2:09:23.920]  tax, you don't want your grandchildren to basically live.
[2:09:23.920 --> 2:09:28.240]  You don't care about their future.
[2:09:28.240 --> 2:09:35.440]  And so we now have today administration warns of command and control regulation over emissions.
[2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:41.320]  The White House is publicly telling Congress, when Congress is really the boss of the president,
[2:09:41.320 --> 2:09:46.840]  they make the laws and he executes, that if you don't put taxes on carbon dioxide and
[2:09:46.840 --> 2:09:53.320]  on air travel and cars and everything else, we are going to, quote, take command and control
[2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:54.840]  and it won't be pretty.
[2:09:54.840 --> 2:10:01.640]  Those are quotes, quotes by the administration at Copenhagen into a closed-door meeting with
[2:10:01.640 --> 2:10:02.640]  the press.
[2:10:02.640 --> 2:10:06.120]  Fox News reports this was a secret meeting they had with them and it was on condition
[2:10:06.120 --> 2:10:07.440]  and anonymity.
[2:10:07.440 --> 2:10:12.480]  So they're now issuing this public threat, the EPA on Monday in line with Copenhagen
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:16.640]  announced carbon dioxide that humans exhale five and a half pounds of a day on average
[2:10:16.640 --> 2:10:22.200]  as a toxic waste, it's completely asinine, but allows them to tax and control everything.
[2:10:22.200 --> 2:10:26.240]  It's also confirmed that the full secret text of the treaty has been released that third
[2:10:26.240 --> 2:10:29.680]  world countries will have double the cuts or right at double the cuts, a little bit
[2:10:29.680 --> 2:10:34.040]  less than double the cuts of the West and that the IMF and World Bank will run the new
[2:10:34.040 --> 2:10:35.240]  planetary government.
[2:10:35.240 --> 2:10:36.520]  The human will have no power.
[2:10:36.520 --> 2:10:37.960]  That was always the plan.
[2:10:37.960 --> 2:10:44.400]  The United States set up the UN in 45 as a debating society to manipulate and to have one clearing
[2:10:44.400 --> 2:10:48.360]  house to pay off third world dictators and leaders.
[2:10:48.360 --> 2:10:52.920]  It states that the tax money from Westerners will be given to banks to then be loaned to
[2:10:52.920 --> 2:10:56.280]  the third world under environmental stipulations.
[2:10:56.280 --> 2:10:59.600]  So this is just an expansion of the IMF World Bank raping.
[2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:01.200]  So we're going to go over all of that.
[2:11:01.200 --> 2:11:05.240]  This is huge and take some of your phone calls, but I wanted to have Jason Bermasen for a
[2:11:05.240 --> 2:11:09.160]  few minutes because he's collating for his incredible film.
[2:11:09.160 --> 2:11:15.400]  I mean, it really is a new level in his work and rivaling ours and Mike Whitesides back
[2:11:15.400 --> 2:11:22.120]  there, the graphics guy who's working slavishly to do a great job with Invisible Empire that's
[2:11:22.120 --> 2:11:27.400]  coming out in mid-February of next year, just hundreds of clips of world leaders calling
[2:11:27.400 --> 2:11:31.520]  for world government and new world order and stuff I'd never seen a George Bush senior
[2:11:31.520 --> 2:11:32.800]  calling for global government.
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:38.360]  I mean, this is some powerful stuff, but in his research, Bermas got us this clip.
[2:11:38.360 --> 2:11:39.760]  Jason, there's two clips.
[2:11:39.760 --> 2:11:41.000]  Tell us the clips we're about to see.
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:42.880]  Yeah, they just run congruently.
[2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:48.080]  There was a speech November 6th, Kevin Rudd, the Prime Minister of Australia got up to
[2:11:48.080 --> 2:11:54.240]  promote all these emission standards and new taxes under global governance.
[2:11:54.240 --> 2:11:59.360]  And basically what he says here is that there's a third argument from those who say that carbon
[2:11:59.360 --> 2:12:01.040]  pollution is wrong.
[2:12:01.040 --> 2:12:04.040]  And he brings up Christopher Monk and he says, we are fear mongers.
[2:12:04.040 --> 2:12:08.840]  This is not a UN power grab and we're all world government conspiracy theorists.
[2:12:08.840 --> 2:12:11.680]  But then he never says this isn't about world government.
[2:12:11.680 --> 2:12:15.480]  He brings up the point that we're not doing anything, Alex.
[2:12:15.480 --> 2:12:17.520]  We don't have a solution for this.
[2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:18.520]  We are bad.
[2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:24.480]  And then, of course, they try to establish the climate change denial movement and associate
[2:12:24.480 --> 2:12:26.280]  us with Holocaust denial.
[2:12:26.280 --> 2:12:28.120]  So right here is the treaty.
[2:12:28.120 --> 2:12:30.800]  They call for world government over and over again.
[2:12:30.800 --> 2:12:34.400]  We have all the world leaders saying it's the birth of world government run by a private
[2:12:34.400 --> 2:12:35.420]  banking group.
[2:12:35.420 --> 2:12:40.160]  So here he is kind of going with the old propaganda of, well, you're a bunch of conspiracy
[2:12:40.160 --> 2:12:43.320]  theorists when we're only reading what he actually says.
[2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:47.520]  This shows Kevin Rudd's disdain for the Australian people.
[2:12:47.520 --> 2:12:49.080]  This shows that he thinks they're a bunch of idiots.
[2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:53.520]  But a week later, climate documents broke and now is he eating crow?
[2:12:53.520 --> 2:12:55.000]  His parliament is on the verge of collapse.
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:56.600]  There's been all these resignations.
[2:12:56.600 --> 2:13:02.880]  The anti-carbon tax crowd has now gotten the second place in their parliamentary system.
[2:13:02.880 --> 2:13:04.920]  So they're in a lot of trouble.
[2:13:04.920 --> 2:13:07.960]  And last week they failed to pass their carbon tax.
[2:13:07.960 --> 2:13:12.200]  But Rudd is saying, I don't care, I'm going to use the Australian version of the EPA to
[2:13:12.200 --> 2:13:13.200]  do it anyways.
[2:13:13.200 --> 2:13:19.100]  So the prime ministers and presidents are now openly acting as dictators under orders
[2:13:19.100 --> 2:13:20.600]  of the world government.
[2:13:20.600 --> 2:13:21.600]  Absolutely.
[2:13:21.600 --> 2:13:25.360]  The ETS, the emissions trading standard, failed there last week.
[2:13:25.360 --> 2:13:28.720]  And that was a huge victory yet again for the truth.
[2:13:28.720 --> 2:13:33.920]  We are trying to bring people to realize that this document that sits right next to you
[2:13:33.920 --> 2:13:36.880]  mentions global government over two dozen times.
[2:13:36.880 --> 2:13:39.480]  It is their third pillar.
[2:13:39.480 --> 2:13:42.240]  Taxation is mentioned over a dozen times, Alex.
[2:13:42.240 --> 2:13:43.240]  We know what this is about.
[2:13:43.240 --> 2:13:47.040]  Well, we now know it's a 2% tax on all GDP off the top.
[2:13:47.040 --> 2:13:53.480]  It is a 2% tax on all currency transfers and a stock brokering.
[2:13:53.480 --> 2:13:58.940]  It is a giant, ramped up 20% tax on all fossil fuels.
[2:13:58.940 --> 2:14:02.160]  It is road taxes with license plate reading cameras.
[2:14:02.160 --> 2:14:04.360]  It's 700 new U.N. bureaucracies.
[2:14:04.360 --> 2:14:09.760]  I mean, this is a total takeover and it's paid to the IMF and World Bank and the London
[2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:12.720]  Guardian reports where the money goes will be secret.
[2:14:12.720 --> 2:14:17.080]  We've already seen this with the trillions given to the private folder reserve and they
[2:14:17.080 --> 2:14:19.640]  tell Congress we're not going to tell you where the money went.
[2:14:19.640 --> 2:14:22.000]  Even though they told Congress it was to unfreeze the mortgages.
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:26.360]  I mean, this is like Madoff who actually came up with a lot of this and Ken Lay, you know,
[2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:28.960]  they're now both in prison or dead.
[2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:29.960]  It's the same crew.
[2:14:29.960 --> 2:14:34.240]  Might as well just say, we're God, slit your wrist and put the blood directly in our mouths.
[2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:37.320]  I mean, this is just them openly saying we rule the planet.
[2:14:37.320 --> 2:14:38.320]  We are the con artists.
[2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:39.320]  We are the criminals.
[2:14:39.320 --> 2:14:44.560]  And let's not forget the false left cover of, oh, the oil industries are backing all
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:47.240]  this research that disproves climate change.
[2:14:47.240 --> 2:14:52.440]  Alex, we have the articles where the head of Exxon, the head of Shell Oil are calling
[2:14:52.440 --> 2:14:53.640]  for a carbon tax.
[2:14:53.640 --> 2:14:54.640]  And if you go to the smallest...
[2:14:54.640 --> 2:14:55.640]  The head of BP.
[2:14:55.640 --> 2:14:56.640]  Absolutely.
[2:14:56.640 --> 2:15:01.600]  And now we have the internal emails from 2000 where the climate center was taking orders
[2:15:01.600 --> 2:15:05.240]  from the oil companies and saying it's only part of their agenda to take over.
[2:15:05.240 --> 2:15:06.240]  The oil companies...
[2:15:06.240 --> 2:15:11.880]  It's just like the insurance companies openly wrote the health care bill that now makes
[2:15:11.880 --> 2:15:13.600]  you go get insurance with them.
[2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:17.480]  And then they're cutting Medicare and Medicaid, the case for killing granny.
[2:15:17.480 --> 2:15:19.400]  Let's play this first clip.
[2:15:19.400 --> 2:15:22.280]  This is a two and a half minute clip with the prime minister of Australia.
[2:15:22.280 --> 2:15:23.280]  Here it is.
[2:15:23.280 --> 2:15:28.720]  To help meet the expected overall increase in the cost of living flowing from the scheme.
[2:15:28.720 --> 2:15:33.320]  A third argument from those who quibble about the design of the carbon pollution reduction
[2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:38.360]  scheme is that the international design aspects of the scheme are flawed.
[2:15:38.360 --> 2:15:44.200]  Lord Christopher Moncton, a former advisor to Margaret Thatcher, was quoted this week
[2:15:44.200 --> 2:15:47.840]  in the Australian press by Janet Albrookson.
[2:15:47.840 --> 2:15:52.760]  Lord Moncton describes the potential Copenhagen agreement as a plan to set up transnational
[2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:57.200]  government on a scale the world has never seen before.
[2:15:57.200 --> 2:16:00.680]  Under the world government conspiracy theorists.
[2:16:00.680 --> 2:16:05.120]  Lord Moncton also publicly warned Americans that, and I quote him, in the next few weeks
[2:16:05.120 --> 2:16:09.000]  unless you stop it, your president will sign your freedom, your democracy and your prosperity
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:12.240]  away forever.
[2:16:12.240 --> 2:16:18.320]  Janet Albrookson, in her understated, neoconservative way, refers to the potential Copenhagen agreement
[2:16:18.320 --> 2:16:21.980]  as a UN power grab.
[2:16:21.980 --> 2:16:28.280]  This gaggle of world government conspiracy theorists are so far out there on the far
[2:16:28.280 --> 2:16:33.680]  right that they rub up next to the global anarchists on the far left.
[2:16:33.680 --> 2:16:38.360]  Those who argue that any multi-electrical action is by definition evil.
[2:16:38.360 --> 2:16:43.240]  Those who argue that climate change does not represent a global market failure.
[2:16:43.240 --> 2:16:48.240]  Those who argue that somehow the market will magically solve the problem in a way in which
[2:16:48.240 --> 2:16:51.520]  it hasn't solved the problem so far.
[2:16:51.520 --> 2:16:56.520]  And that uncoordinated national actions will somehow fix the problem without answering
[2:16:56.520 --> 2:17:03.120]  the basic logical question of how can we deal with an existential threat, an existential
[2:17:03.120 --> 2:17:08.840]  challenge for the whole planet in the long term, one which lies beyond the capacity of
[2:17:08.840 --> 2:17:12.800]  any individual national action to address.
[2:17:12.800 --> 2:17:19.160]  The climate change deniers now form the comfortable bedfellows of the global conspiracy theorists.
[2:17:19.160 --> 2:17:25.880]  In total, ball-faced denial of global, scientific, economic, and environmental reality.
[2:17:25.880 --> 2:17:30.080]  These arguments, thinly vowed attempts to create a new climate change global conspiracy
[2:17:30.080 --> 2:17:33.440]  theory, are now being used in Australia.
[2:17:33.440 --> 2:17:41.280]  Like the arguments from climate change deniers, these arguments have zero basis in the evidence.
[2:17:41.280 --> 2:17:45.760]  So that's clip number one, but we have Herman von Rompe and everybody else saying this is
[2:17:45.760 --> 2:17:53.360]  global government, and then he's calling us conspiracy theorists for saying it.
[2:17:53.360 --> 2:17:59.000]  Without answering the basic logical question of how can we deal with the existential challenge
[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:04.600]  for the whole planet which lies beyond the capacity of any individual national action
[2:18:04.600 --> 2:18:05.600]  to address.
[2:18:05.600 --> 2:18:10.640]  Right there, he acknowledges, yes, we are setting up a world government, but we're global government
[2:18:10.640 --> 2:18:15.520]  conspiracy theorists, Alex, and we're in bed with climate change denial now.
[2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:16.520]  It's all semantics.
[2:18:16.520 --> 2:18:17.880]  It's all world word games.
[2:18:17.880 --> 2:18:20.960]  The guy admits it to you as he denounces it.
[2:18:20.960 --> 2:18:23.320]  That's their game.
[2:18:23.320 --> 2:18:32.000]  Let's play von Rompe, here it is 2009 is also the first year of global governance with the
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:36.360]  establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis.
[2:18:36.360 --> 2:18:42.240]  The climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our
[2:18:42.240 --> 2:18:45.120]  planet.
[2:18:45.120 --> 2:18:48.320]  Our mission, our presidency is one of hope.
[2:18:48.320 --> 2:18:52.520]  Now we could play Al Gore saying it too, we could read out of the treaty, we have the
[2:18:52.520 --> 2:18:56.400]  London Guardian saying it's world government, but that it's a good thing, and we have them
[2:18:56.400 --> 2:18:59.600]  saying the IMF and World Bank will be the world government.
[2:18:59.600 --> 2:19:03.560]  I mean, we've always said the bankers are going to set up world government for themselves.
[2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:04.880]  Why did we know that?
[2:19:04.880 --> 2:19:09.000]  Because David Rockefeller wrote books about it and gave speech after speech saying it.
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:12.960]  But see, they have such disdain for the public, and I guess it works.
[2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:16.520]  They say global government doesn't exist, we're just setting up global governance.
[2:19:16.520 --> 2:19:18.480]  Yeah, it's a word game.
[2:19:18.480 --> 2:19:22.680]  And when you say global governance, people like George Monbiot, jump out and say this
[2:19:22.680 --> 2:19:27.040]  is the best thing ever, we'll get 25 other academics to sign on to it.
[2:19:27.040 --> 2:19:29.360]  Hey, I'll write a book called the New World Order.
[2:19:29.360 --> 2:19:34.120]  But then when you expose what the New World Order really is, what global government really
[2:19:34.120 --> 2:19:39.840]  means, it means a carbon tax, it means a tattletale society, it means the implementation of their
[2:19:39.840 --> 2:19:42.200]  cashless society control grid.
[2:19:42.200 --> 2:19:47.000]  In the Netherlands, they have passed the law where all cars will have GPS systems and be
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  taxed.
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:49.640]  Oh, they're saying that's happening here.
[2:19:49.640 --> 2:19:52.800]  Jason, I'm going to play this final clip when we come back and take some calls.
[2:19:52.800 --> 2:19:53.800]  Thanks for the great report.
[2:19:53.800 --> 2:20:01.360]  We'll see you Sunday, 6 to 9 p.m. right after my Sunday show, great job.

[2:20:08.680 --> 2:20:09.840]  in the process.

[2:20:58.200 --> 2:21:01.200]  Freeze-dry guy, the best you can buy.
[2:21:01.200 --> 2:21:05.400]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate,
[2:21:05.400 --> 2:21:08.880]  and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here Is What You Do.
[2:21:08.880 --> 2:21:14.800]  You can buy it at HereIsWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for 6 bucks or the book for 10 bucks
[2:21:14.800 --> 2:21:17.960]  and we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[2:21:17.960 --> 2:21:22.920]  Here Is What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh
[2:21:22.920 --> 2:21:24.240]  economic times.
[2:21:24.240 --> 2:21:28.320]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[2:21:28.320 --> 2:21:32.360]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how
[2:21:32.360 --> 2:21:33.880]  to protect your wealth as well.
[2:21:33.880 --> 2:21:37.680]  You know the government isn't looking out for you, you need to look out for yourself.
[2:21:37.680 --> 2:21:40.240]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[2:21:40.240 --> 2:21:44.080]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your
[2:21:44.080 --> 2:21:45.080]  loved ones.
[2:21:45.080 --> 2:21:48.560]  Go to HereIsWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[2:21:48.560 --> 2:21:51.880]  Again, it is HereIsWhatYouDo.net.
[2:21:51.880 --> 2:21:53.680]  That's HereIsWhatYouDo.net.
[2:21:53.680 --> 2:22:00.760]  One last time, it's HereIsWhatYouDo.net.
[2:22:00.760 --> 2:22:04.960]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[2:22:04.960 --> 2:22:07.400]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[2:22:07.400 --> 2:22:12.520]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many
[2:22:12.520 --> 2:22:15.540]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[2:22:15.540 --> 2:22:19.840]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing
[2:22:19.840 --> 2:22:23.760]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[2:22:23.760 --> 2:22:27.520]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[2:22:27.520 --> 2:22:28.880]  from Jekyll Island.
[2:22:28.880 --> 2:22:32.920]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[2:22:32.920 --> 2:22:33.920]  power.
[2:22:33.920 --> 2:22:37.800]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[2:22:37.800 --> 2:22:39.360]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[2:22:39.360 --> 2:22:44.080]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[2:23:00.640 --> 2:23:03.920]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[2:23:03.920 --> 2:23:07.840]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[2:23:07.840 --> 2:23:11.560]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[2:23:11.560 --> 2:23:16.880]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water.
[2:23:16.880 --> 2:23:20.640]  Remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride and contaminants from municipal water.

[2:23:24.960 --> 2:23:26.760]  rainwater collection systems.

[2:23:59.760 --> 2:24:09.160]  All right, here's another clip of the Australian prime minister who was just defeated.
[2:24:09.160 --> 2:24:13.520]  His plan for carbon tax was shot down in the Australian parliament.
[2:24:13.520 --> 2:24:16.560]  So he said, but Obama said, he said, I'll just do it anyways.
[2:24:16.560 --> 2:24:22.440]  Schwarzenegger a month ago couldn't get the legislature before it closed to put taxes
[2:24:22.440 --> 2:24:26.400]  on television sets, taxes on emissions, taxes on cars.
[2:24:26.400 --> 2:24:29.320]  He just said, I'm just going to order the bureaucracy to do it.
[2:24:29.320 --> 2:24:30.480]  They have to be impeached.
[2:24:30.480 --> 2:24:32.000]  They have to be removed.
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:36.320]  These are dictators, tyrannous.
[2:24:36.320 --> 2:24:38.320]  These people are frauds.
[2:24:38.320 --> 2:24:43.280]  It's an international grid, a system of governance, a system of oppression.
[2:24:43.280 --> 2:24:47.080]  Here's the second clip of prime minister Kevin Rudd.
[2:24:47.080 --> 2:24:54.760]  Where is their equivalent evidence basis to treasury modeling published by the government
[2:24:54.760 --> 2:24:58.840]  on the cost impacts of households from the carbon pollution reduction scheme and on the
[2:24:58.840 --> 2:25:02.760]  adequacy of the compensation arrangements put in place by the Commonwealth government
[2:25:02.760 --> 2:25:05.200]  in the government's white paper?
[2:25:05.200 --> 2:25:08.760]  The answer to both these questions is there is no evidence.
[2:25:08.760 --> 2:25:12.080]  None has been provided, none from any official source.
[2:25:12.080 --> 2:25:13.080]  Total line.
[2:25:13.080 --> 2:25:18.600]  The evidence basis offered by the new League of World Government Conspiracy Theorists,
[2:25:18.600 --> 2:25:24.520]  that climate change can be effectively dealt with by market means or by uncoordinated national
[2:25:24.520 --> 2:25:25.520]  means.
[2:25:25.520 --> 2:25:31.920]  Again, no body of evidence, no official evidentiary document has been produced anywhere to substantiate
[2:25:31.920 --> 2:25:32.920]  that position.
[2:25:32.920 --> 2:25:33.920]  Total lies.
[2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:39.640]  The truth is that the do nothing climate change skeptics offer no alternative official
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:45.680]  body of evidence from any credible government anywhere in the world.
[2:25:45.680 --> 2:25:47.600]  Absolutely none.
[2:25:47.600 --> 2:25:55.640]  The truth is they offer zero credible evidence, instead they offer maximum fear.
[2:25:55.640 --> 2:25:59.480]  The universal conservative stock in trade.
[2:25:59.480 --> 2:26:04.560]  And by doing so, these do nothing climate change skeptics are prepared to destroy our
[2:26:04.560 --> 2:26:05.560]  children's future.
[2:26:05.560 --> 2:26:10.480]  Third group of climate change deniers are those who pretend to accept the science but
[2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:14.360]  then urge delay because they don't want their country to be the first to act.
[2:26:14.360 --> 2:26:19.880]  In Australia, there was once a political consensus resisting this parochial view.
[2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:25.680]  The Shergoll report commissioned by John Howard and written by the head of Mr Howard's department,
[2:26:25.680 --> 2:26:30.240]  Shergoll himself, recommended that Australia should not wait for the rest of the world
[2:26:30.240 --> 2:26:31.240]  to act.
[2:26:31.240 --> 2:26:36.520]  This is what Mr Howard's report said on this prior to the last election, and I quote it,
[2:26:36.520 --> 2:26:41.760]  waiting until a truly global response emerges before imposing an emissions cap will place
[2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:48.800]  costs on Australia by increasing business uncertainty and delaying or losing investment,
[2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:52.720]  unquote, thus spake the Howard government.
[2:26:52.720 --> 2:26:56.560]  The current leader of the opposition also stated that a domestic emissions trading scheme
[2:26:56.560 --> 2:27:00.000]  would help in international negotiations too, and I quote,
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:05.440]  our first-hand experience in implementing an emissions trading scheme would be of considerable
[2:27:05.440 --> 2:27:09.760]  assistance in our international discussions and negotiations aimed at achieving an effective
[2:27:09.760 --> 2:27:10.760]  global agreement.
[2:27:10.760 --> 2:27:11.760]  That's a no.
[2:27:11.760 --> 2:27:12.760]  That's a no.
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:13.760]  That's a lie last year.
[2:27:13.760 --> 2:27:17.760]  Now, did you notice, he's saying your conspiracy theorist, if you say this is a global government,
[2:27:17.760 --> 2:27:23.400]  when the UN, Al Gore, the head of the EU all say it's a global government and it's in
[2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:29.080]  the treaty, he then says there's no scientific evidence that carbon dioxide isn't hurting
[2:27:29.080 --> 2:27:35.600]  us, when there's 31,000 plus scientists in the U.S. alone saying it's all fraud, and
[2:27:35.600 --> 2:27:41.040]  the UN's got 600 real climatologists that it turns out are on their payroll to engage
[2:27:41.040 --> 2:27:42.560]  in fraud.
[2:27:42.560 --> 2:27:47.080]  He then says those of us against this global government takeover and carbon tax are fear
[2:27:47.080 --> 2:27:51.880]  mongers, he goes on to say, and we don't care about our children's future being destroyed,
[2:27:51.880 --> 2:27:52.880]  fear mongering.
[2:27:52.880 --> 2:27:56.640]  They're the ones saying polar bears can't swim or die when their numbers are exploding
[2:27:56.640 --> 2:28:00.480]  and penguins are drowning and that all the cities are going to be underwater on the coast
[2:28:00.480 --> 2:28:06.920]  and San Francisco 900 feet above sea level, 938 feet is going to be underwater, just
[2:28:06.920 --> 2:28:11.560]  all made up, all completely made up.
[2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:17.440]  They are the ones fear mongering everywhere saying we've got to give power to this international
[2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:18.960]  institution, the UN.
[2:28:18.960 --> 2:28:22.640]  But it turns out it's not the UN that's going to have it, it's the IMF and World Bank and
[2:28:22.640 --> 2:28:30.240]  that is confirmed, London Guardian, Associated Press, Reuters, Copenhagen Climate Summit
[2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:32.960]  in disarray after Danish text leak.
[2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:36.960]  Developing countries react furiously to leak draft agreement that would hand more power
[2:28:36.960 --> 2:28:37.960]  to rich nations.
[2:28:37.960 --> 2:28:44.640]  No, IMF, World Bank sideline the UN's negotiating role and abandon the Kyoto protocol.
[2:28:44.640 --> 2:28:48.280]  And it says that the document is being interpreted by developing countries as setting unequal
[2:28:48.280 --> 2:28:52.160]  limits on per capita carbon emissions for developed countries, meaning that people in
[2:28:52.160 --> 2:28:56.680]  rich countries will be permitted to emit nearly twice as much under the proposals.
[2:28:56.680 --> 2:29:03.160]  And it goes on in the text of the new agreement saying that this will essentially, this was
[2:29:03.160 --> 2:29:08.720]  done in secret, this will end the United Nations as we know it, this is a secret of
[2:29:08.720 --> 2:29:10.840]  organization taking over.
[2:29:10.840 --> 2:29:16.960]  It says that the private banks will set standards for the third world to get the tax money stolen
[2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:23.560]  from the West via carbon taxes to give private banks and private corporations built around
[2:29:23.560 --> 2:29:28.280]  those banks total hegemonic control over the entire planet.
[2:29:28.280 --> 2:29:31.640]  I mean it is, it is unbelievable.
[2:29:31.640 --> 2:29:38.320]  And then we have the full text of the treaty right here, we have the full text of the addendum
[2:29:38.320 --> 2:29:51.640]  right here, they're all up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com, stay with us.
[2:29:51.640 --> 2:30:00.800]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:30:00.800 --> 2:30:05.440]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[2:30:05.440 --> 2:30:06.440]  you to eat.
[2:30:06.440 --> 2:30:09.960]  If you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[2:30:09.960 --> 2:30:15.880]  sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs, you don't have to cooperate, there is a solution.
[2:30:15.880 --> 2:30:19.440]  Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[2:30:19.440 --> 2:30:24.280]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[2:30:24.280 --> 2:30:29.400]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the
[2:30:29.400 --> 2:30:31.680]  energy you need and will keep you well.

[2:31:00.760 --> 2:31:04.720]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[2:31:04.720 --> 2:31:07.600]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[2:31:07.600 --> 2:31:09.680]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[2:32:00.560 --> 2:32:05.200]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:32:05.200 --> 2:32:09.520]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:32:09.520 --> 2:32:13.880]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:32:13.880 --> 2:32:14.880]  allows you to have.
[2:32:14.880 --> 2:32:20.880]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:32:20.880 --> 2:32:25.200]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:32:25.200 --> 2:32:29.200]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:32:29.200 --> 2:32:32.680]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:32:32.680 --> 2:32:36.400]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[2:32:36.400 --> 2:32:41.120]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:32:41.120 --> 2:32:44.920]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:32:44.920 --> 2:32:46.320]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[2:32:46.320 --> 2:32:52.160]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:32:52.160 --> 2:33:18.160]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[2:33:23.120 --> 2:33:27.600]  Okay, we're going to be going to your phone calls here, and I know we have callers that
[2:33:27.600 --> 2:33:29.400]  have been holding from a long time ago.
[2:33:29.400 --> 2:33:33.200]  I would hope you'd have a question for Tim Ball, but he can comment on the whole new
[2:33:33.200 --> 2:33:38.800]  allotter system in his research of climate change and the UN, like everybody else that's
[2:33:38.800 --> 2:33:40.680]  researched what's happening in our world.
[2:33:40.680 --> 2:33:43.200]  He's quite knowledgeable on multiple fronts.
[2:33:43.200 --> 2:33:47.560]  I want to go through with him, not just the fraud, but the global government that's being
[2:33:47.560 --> 2:33:48.560]  established.
[2:33:48.560 --> 2:33:53.920]  I haven't even gotten into the other big developments with this world government treaty being rammed
[2:33:53.920 --> 2:33:54.920]  through.
[2:33:54.920 --> 2:33:59.560]  Obama's saying, and Kevin Rudd of Australia's saying, we don't care if our parliaments in
[2:33:59.560 --> 2:34:04.400]  Congress won't pass this, we're going to do it outside the legislative process.
[2:34:04.400 --> 2:34:10.720]  This is tyranny, and I am calling for the impeachment of Barack H. Obama for making this announcement
[2:34:10.720 --> 2:34:11.720]  and threatening Congress.
[2:34:11.720 --> 2:34:16.920]  I am officially, and I had not called for this because the guy's a puppet, but he has
[2:34:16.920 --> 2:34:19.920]  to be made an example of that you can't engage in crime.
[2:34:19.920 --> 2:34:23.120]  Schwarzenegger needs to be recalled.
[2:34:23.120 --> 2:34:25.400]  I don't care if he's going to be out of office soon.
[2:34:25.400 --> 2:34:31.200]  His legislature wouldn't pass all these new carbon taxes and taxes on television sets
[2:34:31.200 --> 2:34:35.160]  and on travel, so he just did it and ordered his agency to do it.
[2:34:35.160 --> 2:34:39.800]  You must bring these criminals to justice by at least politically kicking them out,
[2:34:39.800 --> 2:34:43.720]  running them out of town on a rail, or they will set the precedent for this.
[2:34:43.720 --> 2:34:46.120]  This is outrageous.
[2:34:46.120 --> 2:34:50.720]  So that's coming up in a moment, and we'll get Timothy F. Ball, a climatologist, take
[2:34:50.720 --> 2:34:51.720]  on this.
[2:34:51.720 --> 2:34:55.600]  He's one of the people that's been persecuted by these people, and he's a top climatologist
[2:34:55.600 --> 2:34:58.720]  who can break all this down with us in the last 30 minutes.
[2:34:58.720 --> 2:35:03.240]  We have a reporter joining us from Copenhagen with reports on that, but I can yell and
[2:35:03.240 --> 2:35:04.240]  scream.
[2:35:04.240 --> 2:35:05.720]  I can pull my hair out on air.
[2:35:05.720 --> 2:35:11.160]  There's no way for me to impart to you how ultra-incredibly important this is.
[2:35:11.160 --> 2:35:16.400]  When the UN says the greatest meeting in modern government history, it's the truth.
[2:35:16.400 --> 2:35:21.840]  When YouTube runs ads for the climate tax saying the future of our world is being decided,
[2:35:21.840 --> 2:35:22.840]  it is.
[2:35:22.840 --> 2:35:29.440]  This is huge what is happening right now, so that is coming up.
[2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:32.640]  Before I go any further, though, I want to thank the sponsors that made today's radio
[2:35:32.640 --> 2:35:34.880]  show Possible.
[2:35:34.880 --> 2:35:36.800]  Then I have a key call to action coming up.
[2:35:36.800 --> 2:35:40.520]  Let me do the call to action right now.
[2:35:40.520 --> 2:35:53.520]  This video on screen, Alex Jones' secret Copenhagen documents leaked part one and two.
[2:35:53.520 --> 2:35:58.240]  This is as big or bigger than Climate Gate and the thousands of emails and documents
[2:35:58.240 --> 2:36:02.760]  where the top scientists for the UN are all colluding in fraud to hide the decline in temperatures
[2:36:02.760 --> 2:36:06.680]  and to persecute scientists and to work with the government to block forward a request
[2:36:06.680 --> 2:36:10.320]  of information.
[2:36:10.320 --> 2:36:16.240]  There's Copenhagen addendum to the treaty by the U.S., England and Denmark to have the
[2:36:16.240 --> 2:36:20.440]  IMF and World Bank take over the whole process, which they were always planning.
[2:36:20.440 --> 2:36:25.600]  The UN was created by these jokers to have the IMF and World Bank be the world authority
[2:36:25.600 --> 2:36:30.220]  is so huge, is complete and total piracy.
[2:36:30.220 --> 2:36:33.440]  This video is on the Alex Jones channel at YouTube.
[2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:39.800]  This video is posted in all the latest stories on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com on Copenhagen.
[2:36:39.800 --> 2:36:47.200]  Again, Alex Jones' secret Copenhagen documents leaked one of two.
[2:36:47.200 --> 2:36:52.760]  This is bombshell and I'm not going to pop champagne on air like I did two and a half
[2:36:52.760 --> 2:36:55.040]  weeks ago when Climate Gate came out.
[2:36:55.040 --> 2:37:00.920]  This is as big or bigger because it shows the whole architecture of world government
[2:37:00.920 --> 2:37:02.720]  in this addendum to the treaty.
[2:37:02.720 --> 2:37:08.960]  The treaty admits world government, global taxes, 2% taxes on all GDP globally, a global
[2:37:08.960 --> 2:37:14.560]  transportation authority taxing all transportation starting with aircraft, taxes on all fuel.
[2:37:14.560 --> 2:37:19.120]  It's many times worse than we even thought it would be from previous documents.
[2:37:19.120 --> 2:37:25.560]  This is bonafide private criminal corporate banking dictatorship even getting rid of
[2:37:25.560 --> 2:37:26.960]  the front of the UN.
[2:37:26.960 --> 2:37:29.400]  The Guardian says this is the end of the UN.
[2:37:29.400 --> 2:37:30.400]  It is.
[2:37:30.400 --> 2:37:31.400]  This is a giant setup.
[2:37:31.400 --> 2:37:35.200]  They get the third world there, got them all paid off, they're going to vote.
[2:37:35.200 --> 2:37:36.280]  The U.S. signs on.
[2:37:36.280 --> 2:37:40.200]  They're not allowed to get out unless there's a unanimous vote to get out.
[2:37:40.200 --> 2:37:41.680]  We never got rid of NAFTA and GATT.
[2:37:41.680 --> 2:37:43.600]  This is a thousand times bigger than NAFTA and GATT.
[2:37:43.600 --> 2:37:45.920]  We're going to go to Tim Ball in a moment for an hour.
[2:37:45.920 --> 2:37:48.960]  I just want everybody to understand.
[2:37:48.960 --> 2:37:54.080]  This is maker to break at time and we need this particular video so other writers and
[2:37:54.080 --> 2:37:59.840]  researchers pick up on it, read what's in the Guardian, read the document, the draft
[2:37:59.840 --> 2:38:06.640]  271109, adoption of the Copenhagen agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention
[2:38:06.640 --> 2:38:08.960]  on Climate Change, the conference of parties.
[2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:11.640]  This is the real treaty, confirmed.
[2:38:11.640 --> 2:38:17.960]  This is the real treaty, okay, the overarching fine print that goes with the main treaty
[2:38:17.960 --> 2:38:23.160]  that is the worst thing we'd ever seen up until this.
[2:38:23.160 --> 2:38:29.600]  We have to get this seed video out to everyone so people can understand the full document
[2:38:29.600 --> 2:38:34.240]  so they can go look up the areas and we show the documents and articles to prove it.
[2:38:34.240 --> 2:38:36.520]  This video is so important.
[2:38:36.520 --> 2:38:40.760]  I'm begging everyone to get this out to your entire email list and everyone you know.
[2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:41.760]  All right.
[2:38:41.760 --> 2:38:46.920]  That said, let me thank the sponsors and onto our guest.
[2:38:46.920 --> 2:38:48.480]  EatFoodsDirect.com.
[2:38:48.480 --> 2:38:50.960]  You never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[2:38:50.960 --> 2:38:53.800]  We don't have to remind you that you need food to survive.
[2:38:53.800 --> 2:38:58.360]  Our greatest sponsor out there, EatFoods Direct, is the long continually operating storeable
[2:38:58.360 --> 2:39:00.280]  foods company in the country.
[2:39:00.280 --> 2:39:03.000]  They also happen to be true patriots and have supported the freedom movement for years and
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:07.440]  years with the looming global shutdowns of food and energy.
[2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:08.600]  You need to be self-sufficient.
[2:39:08.600 --> 2:39:10.520]  The globalists don't want you to be self-sufficient.
[2:39:10.520 --> 2:39:14.720]  They have super high quality, non-hybrid, non-GMO, a whole bunch of different great food lines.
[2:39:14.720 --> 2:39:22.680]  The best price is out there, 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633 or EatFoodsDirect.com.
[2:39:22.680 --> 2:39:30.040]  Again, that's EatFoodsDirect.com, and I'll thank more sponsors later here.
[2:39:30.040 --> 2:39:38.160]  Now going to Professor Dr. Tim Boll, Timothy F. Boll, heads the Natural Resources Stewardship
[2:39:38.160 --> 2:39:42.320]  Project, is on the Scientific Advisory Board of Friends of Science and Organization Skeptical
[2:39:42.320 --> 2:39:44.120]  of Human Cause Global Warming.
[2:39:44.120 --> 2:39:47.840]  He has a BA degree from the University of Winnipeg, an MA degree from the University
[2:39:47.840 --> 2:39:53.640]  of Manitoba, and in 1970 in geography and a PhD degree in geography from the University
[2:39:53.640 --> 2:39:55.200]  of London, England.
[2:39:55.200 --> 2:40:00.360]  In 1983, writing a thesis analyzing historical weather records from Canada's North Ball taught
[2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:03.240]  geography at the University of Winnipeg.
[2:40:03.240 --> 2:40:06.600]  Ball was featured in the great global warming swindle, a documentary film produced by Martin
[2:40:06.600 --> 2:40:07.680]  Durkin.
[2:40:07.680 --> 2:40:14.080]  This was the first aired in March 2007, and he's been persecuted for his views, of course,
[2:40:14.080 --> 2:40:16.600]  and targeted and called a climate denier.
[2:40:16.600 --> 2:40:18.880]  And we're honored to have him.
[2:40:18.880 --> 2:40:20.480]  Mr. Boll, good to have you here, Doctor.
[2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:25.120]  Well, thank you, Alex, and thanks for the opportunity, and all that you've set up to
[2:40:25.120 --> 2:40:28.480]  now is right on the money.
[2:40:28.480 --> 2:40:33.640]  And of course, as we talked about earlier, this is the second phase.
[2:40:33.640 --> 2:40:41.560]  The first phase was strong using the IPCC and the UN, and the Climate Research Unit people
[2:40:41.560 --> 2:40:46.120]  that whose files have been hacked were controlling the IPCC.
[2:40:46.120 --> 2:40:50.680]  They controlled the key chapters, so that controlled the science part of it.
[2:40:50.680 --> 2:40:57.160]  And then, starting with the club of, or sorry, with the Rio conference in 1992, where Kyoto
[2:40:57.160 --> 2:41:03.520]  was first broached, that has led, and that was COP 1, by the way, that has led now to
[2:41:03.520 --> 2:41:10.480]  COP 15, where finally they're putting into place the whole political takeover that Strong
[2:41:10.480 --> 2:41:12.760]  and These People planned.
[2:41:12.760 --> 2:41:19.720]  What's the combination of using that false science to achieve this political goal?
[2:41:19.720 --> 2:41:22.800]  Absolutely.
[2:41:22.800 --> 2:41:31.200]  And again, the magnitude of open world government being announced for everybody, and the open
[2:41:31.200 --> 2:41:36.560]  announcement that they are going to basically just get rid of the UN, that's what the Guardian
[2:41:36.560 --> 2:41:39.960]  says, and have open government run by private banks.
[2:41:39.960 --> 2:41:48.200]  Well, and of course, when you look back at, say, what was being planned, and just prior
[2:41:48.200 --> 2:41:54.000]  to going to Copenhagen, Obama's on record of saying, you know, this is our opportunity
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  to get one world government, and the UN is the vehicle to do it.
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:04.040]  And so they'll use the UN, and then once they've got what they want, they'll push the UN aside.
[2:42:04.040 --> 2:42:05.400]  This is the standard pattern.
[2:42:05.400 --> 2:42:11.160]  I was interested in your comments about Schwarzenegger, of course, what Californians need to know
[2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:17.520]  is they've already had a taste of false energy policies, because Enron, who were going to
[2:42:17.520 --> 2:42:24.320]  control the whole carbon market, were advising California on our major cause of their economic
[2:42:24.320 --> 2:42:25.320]  problems.
[2:42:25.320 --> 2:42:31.440]  And by the way, Schwarzenegger, it came out, was involved with Enron in meetings and profiting.
[2:42:31.440 --> 2:42:36.720]  Then he ran against Gray Davis, blaming Davis, Davis for all his faults, was blocking Enron
[2:42:36.720 --> 2:42:37.720]  and Enron.
[2:42:37.720 --> 2:42:43.160]  For those that don't know, he later became Secretary of the Army, but Secretary White
[2:42:43.160 --> 2:42:44.920]  was the Enron executive.
[2:42:44.920 --> 2:42:50.520]  They had fake computer programs that they would bring the legislature in and show them
[2:42:50.520 --> 2:42:54.200]  in congressmen and say, here's why you're paying triple for power.
[2:42:54.200 --> 2:42:55.760]  This is what we bought it for.
[2:42:55.760 --> 2:42:57.440]  It was a fake system.
[2:42:57.440 --> 2:43:03.920]  I mean, these guys are just complete frauds, and Schwarzenegger is saying San Francisco
[2:43:03.920 --> 2:43:08.920]  will be under water, despite the fact that it's 938 feet at its highest point.
[2:43:08.920 --> 2:43:12.200]  Its median sea level is over 600 feet.
[2:43:12.200 --> 2:43:17.160]  The UN claims it'll only rise a foot to a foot and a half, and that's bogus numbers.
[2:43:17.160 --> 2:43:20.240]  Holdren says 13 feet, but Schwarzenegger says 900.
[2:43:20.240 --> 2:43:29.480]  Well, and of course, Holdren, the signs are, there are emails in those hacked files.
[2:43:29.480 --> 2:43:34.080]  He was involved in this when he was at Harvard, and there's an interesting little story with
[2:43:34.080 --> 2:43:35.080]  that.
[2:43:35.080 --> 2:43:41.400]  But in 1998, the carbon credits idea of course got grabbed by Gore, and there was a meeting
[2:43:41.400 --> 2:43:47.600]  in the White House in 1998 with Bill Clinton, Gore, Lord Brown, a British petroleum who
[2:43:47.600 --> 2:43:53.360]  has been very big in this in Europe, and Ken Lay of Enron, and there they set out this strategy
[2:43:53.360 --> 2:44:00.920]  of how they were going to use the carbon credits to set up this whole control of energy worldwide.
[2:44:00.920 --> 2:44:07.160]  So yeah, there's several little fingers to this, but they've all been working around
[2:44:07.160 --> 2:44:11.920]  the IPCC as their science, and then the UN as their vehicle.
[2:44:11.920 --> 2:44:14.480]  And of course, that's precisely what Strong said.
[2:44:14.480 --> 2:44:21.000]  And he was asked by Elaine Dewar, a wonderful journalist who started out, by the way, Alex,
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:26.960]  to write a book in praise of Canadian environmentalists, and as she did her research, she found out
[2:44:26.960 --> 2:44:32.040]  they were more corrupt than the people that they were abusing, and so she ended up writing
[2:44:32.040 --> 2:44:36.800]  a book called Cloak of Green that says, look, here's what these people are doing behind
[2:44:36.800 --> 2:44:43.880]  the scenes, and Mars Strong very clearly identified in that, and when he said that he was going
[2:44:43.880 --> 2:44:48.320]  to shut down the industrialized nations, she said, well, why didn't you run for office?
[2:44:48.320 --> 2:44:53.200]  Probably the only honest thing he ever said was, you can't do anything as a politician,
[2:44:53.200 --> 2:44:56.160]  and he said, I'm going to go to the UN where I can get all the money I want and not be
[2:44:56.160 --> 2:44:57.160]  accountable to anybody.
[2:44:57.160 --> 2:45:02.600]  And now he's been caught stealing in the Oil for Food program involved with the...
[2:45:02.600 --> 2:45:03.600]  Exactly.
[2:45:03.600 --> 2:45:07.040]  But that's one of the reasons that it's believed that he's hiding out in China because the
[2:45:07.040 --> 2:45:13.760]  US government want to take him to court over that as well as Kofi Annan and their two sons.
[2:45:13.760 --> 2:45:20.200]  So, yeah, Strong has achieved his goal, and of course, it goes back to the Club of Rome,
[2:45:20.200 --> 2:45:27.320]  you know, this whole idea of one world government, and of course, the Club of Rome came out with
[2:45:27.320 --> 2:45:33.600]  the limits to growth, grossly simplistic ideas that, oh, we were going to run out of this
[2:45:33.600 --> 2:45:37.400]  and we were going to run out of that, all of their predictions have been wrong, yet
[2:45:37.400 --> 2:45:40.080]  they continue to have such influence.
[2:45:40.080 --> 2:45:45.600]  Yeah, for those that don't know, in the early 60s and then in 68 again, they put out, and
[2:45:45.600 --> 2:45:48.920]  we've actually gone to the library and gotten these, they're in my film Endgame, the Club
[2:45:48.920 --> 2:45:53.720]  of Rome reports, and it's said that by the 80s we were going to flood, there was going
[2:45:53.720 --> 2:45:59.720]  to be an ice age, then they said by 2000 we were going to flood, Holdren said we had
[2:45:59.720 --> 2:46:05.440]  to double our CO2 to heat the earth in 77 or we would all die in an ice age, that's
[2:46:05.440 --> 2:46:06.840]  in the news today.
[2:46:06.840 --> 2:46:11.920]  And these guys, they're not wrong, they're just coming up with new frauds as flimflam
[2:46:11.920 --> 2:46:13.920]  men to con people.
[2:46:13.920 --> 2:46:19.920]  Well, that's exactly right, and if you look at the strategy, it's the Sololinsky strategy
[2:46:19.920 --> 2:46:24.960]  that if you want to establish a new government, you've got to show that the current one is
[2:46:24.960 --> 2:46:30.040]  corrupt and get rid of it, and of course, one of the ways you do that is you find one
[2:46:30.040 --> 2:46:36.600]  fault or error, and you simply magnify that and say, look, the whole thing is corrupt
[2:46:36.600 --> 2:46:42.160]  because this one part of it is corrupt, what Madoff did of course was completely unacceptable
[2:46:42.160 --> 2:46:47.000]  and certainly the largest fraud simply because the size of the economies have grown.
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:53.720]  But to say from that, as they did, that the whole market and Wall Street and the banking
[2:46:53.720 --> 2:46:59.280]  and everything else is corrupt and therefore we have to take over, this is a Sololinsky
[2:46:59.280 --> 2:47:00.280]  strategy.
[2:47:00.280 --> 2:47:04.200]  And let me stop you doctor, you're absolutely right, who is saying we've got to get rid
[2:47:04.200 --> 2:47:09.480]  of capitalism, it's the same big banks that actually engineered the crisis, and their
[2:47:09.480 --> 2:47:12.560]  new system is just them having more power.
[2:47:12.560 --> 2:47:17.600]  Yep, exactly, and here's a quote, I mentioned the limits to growth, which of course turned
[2:47:17.600 --> 2:47:22.760]  out to be completely wrong, and Julian Simon, an economist at the time challenged them,
[2:47:22.760 --> 2:47:26.640]  Paul Ehrlich, and he said, look, you name any minerals you want, any time period you
[2:47:26.640 --> 2:47:29.800]  want, and I'll bet you by the end of it, there'll be more minerals available and there'll
[2:47:29.800 --> 2:47:32.600]  be lower price.
[2:47:32.600 --> 2:47:39.480]  Ehrlich then got John Holdren to go and pick out the minerals and to set the time, and
[2:47:39.480 --> 2:47:42.800]  of course turned out that Julian Simon won his bet.
[2:47:42.800 --> 2:47:49.800]  But they then published in 1974 a book titled Mankind at the Turning Point, because already
[2:47:49.800 --> 2:47:55.400]  there were questions being asked about the cooling thing, and Stephen Schneider at NCAR
[2:47:55.400 --> 2:48:03.320]  was starting to switch ships because the global cooling ship was sinking, so they were starting
[2:48:03.320 --> 2:48:08.960]  to shift, and here's the quote from Mankind at the Turning Point, 1974, it would seem
[2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:17.080]  that humans need a common motivation, either a real one or else one invented for the purpose.
[2:48:17.080 --> 2:48:22.200]  In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the
[2:48:22.200 --> 2:48:27.560]  threat of global warming, water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill, and
[2:48:27.560 --> 2:48:32.480]  there it is, and that's why, now of course the pollution, people started to deal with
[2:48:32.480 --> 2:48:37.560]  that, because we all recognized that the environment's an issue, and by the way, one of the...
[2:48:37.560 --> 2:48:43.040]  Yeah, they take something, hold on, you're right, they take things that sound reasonable,
[2:48:43.040 --> 2:48:47.280]  and they candy coat their agenda with that when it has nothing to do with it, and all
[2:48:47.280 --> 2:48:52.000]  about humanity and helping the third world, but when you read the real treaty, it's going
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:57.960]  to double energy prices for the third world, resulting in mass death, I mean, that's a
[2:48:57.960 --> 2:48:58.960]  fact.
[2:48:58.960 --> 2:49:04.680]  Well, as H. L. Menken said 60 years or more ago, he said that the urge to save humanity
[2:49:04.680 --> 2:49:11.000]  is always, always a false front for the urge to rule, and so he pinned it right there,
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:17.800]  but of course he's cast aside as a horrible cynic and so on, but he was looking at the
[2:49:17.800 --> 2:49:24.120]  reality of it, so as I say, out of that Club of Rome quote, we've dealt with the pollution,
[2:49:24.120 --> 2:49:33.320]  they said famine, well, 1976, they had a conference in Egypt on famine and food, and of course
[2:49:33.320 --> 2:49:39.160]  turned out to be absolute nonsense, because by the year 2000, the problem was there was
[2:49:39.160 --> 2:49:44.920]  too much food, they were paying American farmers not to grow stuff, and so all of what they've
[2:49:44.920 --> 2:49:50.560]  touched on has turned out to be a bust, and now because of ethanol, a third of the U.S.
[2:49:50.560 --> 2:49:54.080]  production and other production around the world, we have a doubling in food prices and
[2:49:54.080 --> 2:49:59.560]  millions have conservatively starved to death, they couldn't be happier because whether it's
[2:49:59.560 --> 2:50:06.080]  Kissinger or Erlich or Holdren or Prince Philip or Ted Turner or Jacques Cousteau, all they
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:12.200]  or Dr. Eric Pianca or Peter Singer, all they talk about is setting up a planetary regime,
[2:50:12.200 --> 2:50:17.680]  Gore Vidal, 1969 Playboy Magazine interview about how we need a global government to kill
[2:50:17.680 --> 2:50:18.680]  these people.
[2:50:18.680 --> 2:50:24.480]  Yep, yep, and of course one of the, I published an article on the CRU and its history, the
[2:50:24.480 --> 2:50:29.320]  climatic research unit at East Anglia where the files were hacked, and one of the people
[2:50:29.320 --> 2:50:34.280]  that sort of remained under the radar, Bill Jones, the director, has been asked to step
[2:50:34.280 --> 2:50:38.600]  aside, and they were already doing the cover-up because the person that they've hired to do
[2:50:38.600 --> 2:50:47.040]  the investigation has a terrible record himself, and is in public saying that the global warming
[2:50:47.040 --> 2:50:53.120]  duty of humans is proven beyond doubt, and he's going to investigate this, but what the
[2:50:53.120 --> 2:50:54.120]  guy-
[2:50:54.120 --> 2:50:55.120]  Stay there, gotta break, Doc.
[2:50:55.120 --> 2:50:58.720]  That's like having Henry Kissinger as the first head of the Independent 9-11 Commission.
[2:50:58.720 --> 2:51:01.240]  Stay there, we've got plenty of time to break it all down.
[2:51:01.240 --> 2:51:03.120]  This is an emergency alert.
[2:51:03.120 --> 2:51:06.480]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[2:51:06.480 --> 2:51:12.800]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert urging you to go to fluscam.com
[2:51:12.800 --> 2:51:18.080]  and learn the secrets behind the current flu, who's behind it, the labs it came from, and
[2:51:18.080 --> 2:51:20.240]  the vaccine poisons.
[2:51:20.240 --> 2:51:25.120]  Learn why Barack Obama's science are recommends vaccinations to sterilize people to reduce
[2:51:25.120 --> 2:51:33.040]  populations, and why oxy-silver is making vaccinations and toxic antibiotics unnecessary.
[2:51:33.040 --> 2:51:38.200]  Oxy-silver is far safer than cloidal silvers. It works so well saving lives and money, protecting
[2:51:38.200 --> 2:51:43.560]  you and your family, it has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.

[2:52:05.040 --> 2:52:09.240]  century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:52:09.240 --> 2:52:13.920]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[2:52:13.920 --> 2:52:14.920]  at home.
[2:52:14.920 --> 2:52:20.080]  I've turned an innocent influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[2:52:20.080 --> 2:52:21.080]  shots.
[2:52:21.080 --> 2:52:26.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:31.400]  The fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[2:52:31.400 --> 2:52:36.000]  held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:40.440]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[2:52:40.440 --> 2:52:42.360]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[2:52:42.360 --> 2:52:48.480]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[2:52:48.480 --> 2:52:49.480]  of the Republic.

[2:54:33.920 --> 2:54:43.640]  was always just a debating society, now in Australia, in England, in the United States,
[2:54:43.640 --> 2:54:45.880]  they're announcing command and control.
[2:54:45.880 --> 2:54:50.200]  If the Congress and the parliaments don't capitulate fully to this treaty and paying
[2:54:50.200 --> 2:54:57.160]  direct taxes to private banks, IMF World Bank, then the executives will do it under emergency
[2:54:57.160 --> 2:54:58.160]  rule.
[2:54:58.160 --> 2:55:04.040]  Dr. Tim Ball, persecuted top climatologist, has been exposing them from day one.
[2:55:04.040 --> 2:55:10.360]  What is it like to actually see tyranny, classical Julius Caesar, Adolf Hitler level tyranny
[2:55:10.360 --> 2:55:13.280]  like this, and these guys are only getting started?
[2:55:13.280 --> 2:55:15.200]  What is it like A and B?
[2:55:15.200 --> 2:55:16.840]  Why are they so bold?
[2:55:16.840 --> 2:55:19.720]  Why are they making their move out in the open?
[2:55:19.720 --> 2:55:26.920]  Well, first of all, Alex, people said, oh, you should be vindicated now that the information
[2:55:26.920 --> 2:55:28.320]  is out showing you were right.
[2:55:28.320 --> 2:55:30.520]  No, it's a terribly sad day.
[2:55:30.520 --> 2:55:38.480]  But worse than that, I'm frightened because this is a, well, if you look at what's going
[2:55:38.480 --> 2:55:46.080]  on at Copenhagen, it's paralleling to the Nazi festivals that Hitler organized.
[2:55:46.080 --> 2:55:51.080]  I mean, that opening video that they showed of the child, I mean, you could almost say
[2:55:51.080 --> 2:55:56.200]  that's child abuse, and of course, they've exploited the school system and used the children.
[2:55:56.200 --> 2:56:01.200]  For those that don't know, it shows children and animals a bunch of different videos dying.
[2:56:01.200 --> 2:56:02.200]  Yeah.
[2:56:02.200 --> 2:56:05.560]  Yeah, it's absolutely, absolutely shameless.
[2:56:05.560 --> 2:56:09.600]  And then, on top of that, of course, the World Meteorological Organization comes out
[2:56:09.600 --> 2:56:15.280]  and says, oh, you know, 2000 to 2009 is going to be the warmest decade on record.
[2:56:15.280 --> 2:56:20.480]  Well, first of all, the decade isn't over yet, and they're saying this, but they do
[2:56:20.480 --> 2:56:21.480]  that every year.
[2:56:21.480 --> 2:56:24.880]  They come out in November and say, oh, this is going to be the year when he's still got
[2:56:24.880 --> 2:56:33.280]  December to go, but of course, of course, it's the warmest decade on record because
[2:56:33.280 --> 2:56:36.920]  while they've been keeping records, global temperatures have been increasing.
[2:56:36.920 --> 2:56:40.800]  But it isn't due to the CO2, it's due to the sun.
[2:56:40.800 --> 2:56:47.200]  And of course, what they also don't point out is that in the decade from 2000 to 2009,
[2:56:47.200 --> 2:56:48.720]  the temperatures have plateaued.
[2:56:48.720 --> 2:56:52.080]  So it's almost like you've reached the top of the mountain, and the top of the mountain
[2:56:52.080 --> 2:56:55.840]  is flat, and the global temperatures are now going down.
[2:56:55.840 --> 2:56:59.760]  But those sorts of things, they know that the public don't know about.
[2:56:59.760 --> 2:57:05.120]  And if anybody like me gets up and says anything, they were very, very quickly and easily marginalized.
[2:57:05.120 --> 2:57:11.360]  So what I've seen is the vehicle that they've used, the climate, the method they've used
[2:57:11.360 --> 2:57:19.520]  through the UN, and I see just basically a fascist takeover of the world, and it's very,
[2:57:19.520 --> 2:57:21.240]  very disturbing.
[2:57:21.240 --> 2:57:27.920]  And but of course, also, Alex, I see within it, you know, Obama is saying that Bush has
[2:57:27.920 --> 2:57:29.800]  made the world hate America.
[2:57:29.800 --> 2:57:34.880]  Well, maybe you could argue that some in the Middle East, the Muslim world, a little bit
[2:57:34.880 --> 2:57:35.880]  more.
[2:57:35.880 --> 2:57:38.080]  But there was an anti-Americanism all along anyway.
[2:57:38.080 --> 2:57:39.320]  I know that as a Canadian.
[2:57:39.320 --> 2:57:40.920]  I hear it up here.
[2:57:40.920 --> 2:57:44.200]  And I know because of the family in England that I hear it there.
[2:57:44.200 --> 2:57:49.480]  And of course, one of the things that people don't like about America is, you're successful.
[2:57:49.480 --> 2:57:53.880]  And not only that, but yes, you've done some things wrong, but you're the first people
[2:57:53.880 --> 2:57:54.880]  to admit your errors.
[2:57:54.880 --> 2:58:00.720]  And that's how they sold the third world to other countries in the world.
[2:58:00.720 --> 2:58:04.960]  And as I say to some of the Canadians that go on about it, I said, if you think you don't
[2:58:04.960 --> 2:58:11.080]  like the Americans as a superpower, wait till the Chinese takeover and ask the Tibetans
[2:58:11.080 --> 2:58:12.400]  how they feel about that.
[2:58:12.400 --> 2:58:13.560]  So let me throw this in.
[2:58:13.560 --> 2:58:14.560]  We're going to break back in one minute.
[2:58:14.560 --> 2:58:17.880]  I want you to finish your thought, but that's how they sold the third world and getting
[2:58:17.880 --> 2:58:23.200]  behind Kyoto and now Copenhagen was, oh, you're going to get those evil Americans.
[2:58:23.200 --> 2:58:24.760]  We're going to get their tax money.
[2:58:24.760 --> 2:58:28.800]  Now they get the treaty and it says, oh, you got to make double the cuts and it's all going
[2:58:28.800 --> 2:58:31.960]  to be paid to a private bank and it's going to be secret.
[2:58:31.960 --> 2:58:35.360]  And then we're going to have the IMF come back and loan the money to you.
[2:58:35.360 --> 2:58:37.640]  It's just a total, they're screwing everybody.
[2:58:37.640 --> 2:58:43.160]  Dr. Ball, stay there.
[2:58:43.160 --> 2:58:45.640]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:45.640 --> 2:59:12.320]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:59:12.320 --> 2:59:42.160]  We'll see you in the next video.
[3:00:12.320 --> 3:00:17.180]  You know, we should play this Copenhagen Denmark UN video with little girl dies because climate
[3:00:17.180 --> 3:00:20.560]  change is blown away by water and wind and killed.
[3:00:20.560 --> 3:00:22.720]  They're showing school children this.
[3:00:22.720 --> 3:00:27.840]  They show them videos, cartoons were humans or demons cutting the heads off of bunny rabbits
[3:00:27.840 --> 3:00:29.440]  with blood spewing.
[3:00:29.440 --> 3:00:31.000]  We played that yesterday.
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:35.920]  ABC News reported the kids are taught that they need to commit suicide by age 11.
[3:00:35.920 --> 3:00:37.280]  That's the ABC headline.
[3:00:37.280 --> 3:00:39.600]  Children taught when to die age 11.
[3:00:39.600 --> 3:00:46.640]  This is so monstrous, so evil, so off the charts by these eugenicists who want to wreck society
[3:00:46.640 --> 3:00:47.640]  and control it.
[3:00:47.640 --> 3:00:50.480]  The only way they can control society is to wreck it.
[3:00:50.480 --> 3:00:51.920]  Dr. Tim Ball is our guest.
[3:00:51.920 --> 3:00:53.880]  We're going to take calls coming up the next segment.
[3:00:53.880 --> 3:00:58.680]  Alex, Jeremy, Lynn, Ron and others that are holding, but this is a short segment.
[3:00:58.680 --> 3:01:01.240]  We have the good news is we know how bad it is.
[3:01:01.240 --> 3:01:03.720]  The good news is we know these people are criminal frauds.
[3:01:03.720 --> 3:01:06.360]  The good news is some people are starting to wake up.
[3:01:06.360 --> 3:01:11.120]  The bad news is the enemy knows that and is moving no longer incremental but throwing
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:12.120]  everything at us.
[3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:15.080]  They've certainly kicked it in high gear.
[3:01:15.080 --> 3:01:18.000]  Is that overall a positive thing, Dr. Ball?
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:20.520]  You've been fighting these guys for 20 years.
[3:01:20.520 --> 3:01:21.680]  Any words of encouragement?
[3:01:21.680 --> 3:01:24.080]  I mean, is Climategate a victory?
[3:01:24.080 --> 3:01:25.080]  Where is this going?
[3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:26.080]  Okay.
[3:01:26.080 --> 3:01:31.600]  A problem's only a problem if you're not aware of it, and the fact that the problem's
[3:01:31.600 --> 3:01:36.000]  now been identified means you're halfway there to resolving it.
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:45.040]  And one of the things, of course, that they've been doing besides this machinations of UN
[3:01:45.040 --> 3:01:51.360]  and all the rest of it, but they've been in running the legal processes within different
[3:01:51.360 --> 3:01:52.360]  countries.
[3:01:52.360 --> 3:01:57.080]  So, for example, they got the Supreme Court to rule that CO2 is a toxic substance which
[3:01:57.080 --> 3:02:02.320]  allowed the EPA and Lisa Jackson, who's a chemical engineer and should know better CO2
[3:02:02.320 --> 3:02:04.240]  is not a toxic substance.
[3:02:04.240 --> 3:02:10.120]  And it allowed them then to come in with this draconian legislation to shut down industries
[3:02:10.120 --> 3:02:12.400]  whenever they choose.
[3:02:12.400 --> 3:02:19.280]  And so, that sort of thing, and what's going on here, Alex, is that they knew they had
[3:02:19.280 --> 3:02:22.240]  to operate very quickly.
[3:02:22.240 --> 3:02:26.640]  It's a very poor analogy, but it's a bit like when you take that Band-Aid off, you're better
[3:02:26.640 --> 3:02:30.680]  just to rip her off quick and suffer the pain.
[3:02:30.680 --> 3:02:35.080]  And so, and by the way, they learned this from Jimmy Carter, because Carter talked about
[3:02:35.080 --> 3:02:36.080]  this in his book.
[3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:39.920]  He said, if you don't make changes very, very quickly, you're effectively accepting
[3:02:39.920 --> 3:02:41.640]  the status quo.
[3:02:41.640 --> 3:02:46.120]  And so, of course, Obama's gone in there and ignored everything.
[3:02:46.120 --> 3:02:53.520]  He's ignored, he got himself elected under false pretenses as a sort of center-left Democrat.
[3:02:53.520 --> 3:02:59.080]  Underneath, of course, he was extreme left all the way along.
[3:02:59.080 --> 3:03:01.360]  Now he's had to expose that.
[3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:05.600]  And of course, in doing that, you show your hand.
[3:03:05.600 --> 3:03:08.880]  And of course, that is the good side of it.
[3:03:08.880 --> 3:03:14.240]  And so, as I said, the fact we've defined the problem and people can now move to deal
[3:03:14.240 --> 3:03:18.880]  with it, one of the things that the public could react to, and by the way, what we're
[3:03:18.880 --> 3:03:28.240]  seeing, Alex, is that the Internet is taking democracy and not just in a political sense,
[3:03:28.240 --> 3:03:32.680]  but in the sense of power is control of information.
[3:03:32.680 --> 3:03:37.320]  In the old days, the kings, the queens, and you got rid of them rightfully so, because
[3:03:37.320 --> 3:03:39.960]  they were controlling the information and the power.
[3:03:39.960 --> 3:03:45.240]  And now you've got the situation where Congress, your own elected people are doing it, but
[3:03:45.240 --> 3:03:52.720]  through the Internet, that is making information available to the folks, as they would say.
[3:03:52.720 --> 3:03:55.640]  And it is democratizing information.
[3:03:55.640 --> 3:04:01.800]  And so, there are a million and more eyes watching everything that goes on.
[3:04:01.800 --> 3:04:04.400]  And therefore, you really can't get away with anything.
[3:04:04.400 --> 3:04:10.920]  And it's not in the sense of spying, but it's in the sense of basic openness, which of course
[3:04:10.920 --> 3:04:13.800]  is what the founding fathers in the U.S. had in mind.
[3:04:13.800 --> 3:04:19.200]  And the people have gotten their healthy mistrust of government and power back that
[3:04:19.200 --> 3:04:22.120]  Thomas Jefferson talked about being so essential.
[3:04:22.120 --> 3:04:29.440]  And so, now the layers of lies are being peeled back, and a lot of the denial is ending.
[3:04:29.440 --> 3:04:34.280]  The end of childhood for our society is coming, and people are growing up.
[3:04:34.280 --> 3:04:37.080]  Oh, I would agree.
[3:04:37.080 --> 3:04:41.360]  But the second layer of this, of course, is that you've got the politicians doing what
[3:04:41.360 --> 3:04:42.360]  they're doing.
[3:04:42.360 --> 3:04:45.080]  But, as I just mentioned, Lisa Jackson.
[3:04:45.080 --> 3:04:46.080]  The bureaucrats.
[3:04:46.080 --> 3:04:47.580]  Yeah, the bureaucrats.
[3:04:47.580 --> 3:04:49.080]  The enemy is within.
[3:04:49.080 --> 3:04:50.080]  Stay there.
[3:04:50.080 --> 3:04:51.080]  Stay there.
[3:04:51.080 --> 3:04:52.080]  That's right.
[3:04:52.080 --> 3:04:57.400]  Those states in the U.S. are implementing Kyoto taxes right now, and they haven't even
[3:04:57.400 --> 3:04:58.400]  ratified it.
[3:04:58.400 --> 3:04:59.400]  They're just doing it.
[3:04:59.400 --> 3:05:00.960]  These people are lawless scum.
[3:05:00.960 --> 3:05:01.960]  Stay with us.
[3:05:01.960 --> 3:05:06.320]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:05:06.320 --> 3:05:09.440]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:05:09.440 --> 3:05:13.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[3:05:13.800 --> 3:05:14.800]  at home.
[3:05:14.800 --> 3:05:19.440]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[3:05:19.440 --> 3:05:20.440]  calling the shots.
[3:05:20.440 --> 3:05:25.720]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:05:25.720 --> 3:05:31.240]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[3:05:31.240 --> 3:05:35.920]  held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:05:35.920 --> 3:05:38.360]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:05:38.360 --> 3:05:42.320]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:05:42.320 --> 3:05:48.320]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[3:05:48.320 --> 3:05:49.320]  of the Republic.
[3:05:49.320 --> 3:05:55.760]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com, or watch it online right
[3:05:55.760 --> 3:05:59.320]  now at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[3:05:59.320 --> 3:06:04.400]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:06:04.400 --> 3:06:08.760]  If you're going into a battle, and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[3:06:08.760 --> 3:06:09.760]  do you want?
[3:06:09.760 --> 3:06:11.760]  My answer would be all I can get.
[3:06:11.760 --> 3:06:16.800]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[3:06:16.800 --> 3:06:18.040]  How much do you want?
[3:06:18.040 --> 3:06:19.040]  When do you want it?
[3:06:19.040 --> 3:06:21.040]  Now, or after the battle starts?
[3:06:21.040 --> 3:06:22.160]  When will you need it?
[3:06:22.160 --> 3:06:24.280]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:06:24.280 --> 3:06:25.640]  Will there be any food?
[3:06:25.640 --> 3:06:27.080]  Will it make your children sick?
[3:06:27.080 --> 3:06:31.240]  If there's a quarantine, and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[3:06:31.240 --> 3:06:32.400]  and be immunized?
[3:06:32.400 --> 3:06:36.160]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:06:36.160 --> 3:06:39.760]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:06:39.760 --> 3:06:41.000]  How much will you need?
[3:06:41.000 --> 3:06:42.000]  We don't know.
[3:06:42.000 --> 3:06:43.000]  How much do you want?
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:44.000]  All you can get.
[3:06:44.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:48.240]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[3:06:48.240 --> 3:06:55.520]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:06:55.520 --> 3:07:00.400]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[3:07:00.400 --> 3:07:04.360]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[3:07:04.360 --> 3:07:07.240]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[3:07:07.240 --> 3:07:08.640]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[3:07:08.640 --> 3:07:09.640]  It's very real.
[3:07:09.640 --> 3:07:13.520]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[3:07:13.520 --> 3:07:17.040]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Acola Blue, you'll know what's

[3:08:06.200 --> 3:08:10.960]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[3:08:10.960 --> 3:08:11.960]  You want answers?
[3:08:11.960 --> 3:08:14.080]  Well, so does he.
[3:08:14.080 --> 3:08:23.160]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:08:23.160 --> 3:08:28.920]  Climatologists, Dr. Tim Ball is our guest.
[3:08:28.920 --> 3:08:32.840]  We've got a reporter for the last 20, 30 minutes of the show joining us from Copenhagen, Denmark.
[3:08:32.840 --> 3:08:36.560]  He's done a lot of exclusive interviews with Lord Moncton and others.
[3:08:36.560 --> 3:08:41.240]  We're going to get his take on that from Denmark.
[3:08:41.240 --> 3:08:43.440]  We were pretty much covering this 24-7.
[3:08:43.440 --> 3:08:47.000]  The takeover of healthcare is part of the government power grab, and we're going to
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:52.560]  be taking your phone calls coming up here in just a few minutes, 1-800-259-9231.
[3:08:52.560 --> 3:08:58.460]  You were getting into the bureaucracy, evidenced by state governments, regional governments.
[3:08:58.460 --> 3:09:01.360]  These internationalists always get regional governments in place because they control
[3:09:01.360 --> 3:09:05.920]  them through international SPP meetings, North American Union meetings.
[3:09:05.920 --> 3:09:10.120]  They are already implementing this, and you're right, that's our big problem.
[3:09:10.120 --> 3:09:18.240]  Think of the arrogance of the EPA saying, Congress, if you don't let us list all these
[3:09:18.240 --> 3:09:20.880]  gases, we'll just do it without you.
[3:09:20.880 --> 3:09:25.080]  Congress should immediately start impeachment proceedings against Barack Obama.
[3:09:25.080 --> 3:09:33.160]  Well, and of course, the founding fathers had an awareness of this in that, as you know,
[3:09:33.160 --> 3:09:39.800]  the U.S., unlike other countries in the world, several of your bureaucratic positions are
[3:09:39.800 --> 3:09:42.440]  elected officials.
[3:09:42.440 --> 3:09:48.400]  That was a degree of accountability that other countries' bureaucracies don't have.
[3:09:48.400 --> 3:09:53.240]  For example, in Canada, we don't even get to vote for the prime minister, let alone
[3:09:53.240 --> 3:10:00.240]  to vote for who's going to be the person in charge of the police departments or whatever
[3:10:00.240 --> 3:10:03.000]  else, the sheriffs and so on.
[3:10:03.000 --> 3:10:05.480]  The founding fathers were aware of this.
[3:10:05.480 --> 3:10:08.920]  What they couldn't understand, or couldn't know, I should say, they understood an awful
[3:10:08.920 --> 3:10:16.840]  lot, but what they couldn't know was the extent of growth of government, but also this idea
[3:10:16.840 --> 3:10:22.800]  of environmentalism, because one of the things I've discovered, Alex, is that we now have
[3:10:22.800 --> 3:10:29.120]  all of those graduates of environmental studies programs with no scientific background whatsoever,
[3:10:29.120 --> 3:10:31.520]  just all feel good, touchy-feely.
[3:10:31.520 --> 3:10:36.040]  They're now running a lot of these bureaucracies, and they're using those bureaucracies to
[3:10:36.040 --> 3:10:39.920]  introduce their own personal biases and political issues.
[3:10:39.920 --> 3:10:44.560]  And these are, I've met them, they are control freak persecutors, they are the new guilds
[3:10:44.560 --> 3:10:50.680]  to inspect our homes, our farms, our ranches, our factories, to literally rule our lives.
[3:10:50.680 --> 3:10:57.200]  These are all, I've met them, eugenicists who hate humanity and are burning with a dark
[3:10:57.200 --> 3:10:58.880]  light of control freakism.
[3:10:58.880 --> 3:11:03.400]  Well, I tell you, give me an example in Canada here, on the west coast of Canada here, of
[3:11:03.400 --> 3:11:08.400]  course, we have some of the greatest salmon runs in the world, and what the Department
[3:11:08.400 --> 3:11:14.080]  of Fisheries started doing was that they would give a forecast in the spring of the size
[3:11:14.080 --> 3:11:20.840]  of the run was going to be, and what I discovered they were doing was deliberately creating
[3:11:20.840 --> 3:11:25.720]  very, very low numbers, so for example, one year they said, oh, the run of chum salmon
[3:11:25.720 --> 3:11:29.960]  would be two million, but when that's a very, very low number, therefore we're going to
[3:11:29.960 --> 3:11:36.320]  have been any fishing, commercial, sport, anything this year, well then the run would
[3:11:36.320 --> 3:11:39.480]  come in and then they quietly announced it was over six million.
[3:11:39.480 --> 3:11:43.200]  Well, if you were out that much in your job, you'd be fired instantly.
[3:11:43.200 --> 3:11:49.240]  And let me expand, how many times has the Environmental Protection Agency in mainstream
[3:11:49.240 --> 3:11:56.600]  news been caught taking species, say mountain lions in one case, that aren't in an area
[3:11:56.600 --> 3:12:03.840]  of the country, moving them there, saying it's a new subspecies, or moving birds that
[3:12:03.840 --> 3:12:08.360]  aren't endangered to an area, or fish, they've been caught putting them in ponds, and going,
[3:12:08.360 --> 3:12:14.480]  oh, we discovered a new fish in this area, they, fraud is their name, fraud is their
[3:12:14.480 --> 3:12:18.760]  game, and I want you to comment on this as a scientist, it's coming out that NOAA, NASA,
[3:12:18.760 --> 3:12:23.400]  it's coming out the Australian, the New Zealand, the German, the British Weather Services,
[3:12:23.400 --> 3:12:28.880]  are all faking numbers, last week it came out, the UN was behind the scenes, coordinating
[3:12:28.880 --> 3:12:35.000]  all this, this is a group of fraudster control freaks, I mean, this is a criminal group.
[3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:40.720]  Well, and of course it's why Morris Strong made sure that the majority of the people
[3:12:40.720 --> 3:12:48.200]  at the IPCC were bureaucrats, they were the people that make up the 2,500 and very, very
[3:12:48.200 --> 3:12:53.480]  few scientists, and then the control, as I said, of the critical chapters in the IPCC
[3:12:53.480 --> 3:13:01.760]  reports was by the people at CRU, and so this falsification of the official record, and one
[3:13:01.760 --> 3:13:05.160]  of the people doing it in the US, and he's been caught two or three times, that it was
[3:13:05.160 --> 3:13:10.520]  James Hansen at NASA, and every time that anybody dares to say anything, you immediately
[3:13:10.520 --> 3:13:11.520]  screams political interference.
[3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:15.960]  That's right, that's right, man with the hockey stick, all these guys have been caught
[3:13:15.960 --> 3:13:22.480]  over and over and over, but even if somebody's not a scientist, they say they teach children,
[3:13:22.480 --> 3:13:26.960]  and I've seen it on the news, that the penguins are all dying and drowned, they're the best
[3:13:26.960 --> 3:13:30.480]  swimming bird there is, they teach everybody, literally the best swimming bird there is
[3:13:30.480 --> 3:13:34.720]  is a different species of penguin, you know, the first best is one type, second best swimmer
[3:13:34.720 --> 3:13:40.800]  is another penguin, I think I was reading the nine most rated best swimming birds are
[3:13:40.800 --> 3:13:44.840]  all penguins, they say the polar bears are all dying, their numbers are exploding, they
[3:13:44.840 --> 3:13:50.200]  say they can't swim, these people are just total fraudsters, and they know they're in
[3:13:50.200 --> 3:13:51.200]  fraud.
[3:13:51.200 --> 3:13:55.320]  Well, one of the things with the polar bears, and I do search and rescue in the Arctic for
[3:13:55.320 --> 3:14:00.360]  five years, and I've seen polar bears a hundred miles offshore, they're superb swimmers,
[3:14:00.360 --> 3:14:06.520]  Alex, because the long fur is hollow to allow the sunlight to hit it and go in and heat
[3:14:06.520 --> 3:14:07.520]  their bodies.
[3:14:07.520 --> 3:14:08.520]  It's incredible.
[3:14:08.520 --> 3:14:13.080]  And therefore with that hollow fur, I want your viewer or your people to watch next time
[3:14:13.080 --> 3:14:16.840]  you see a video, you'll see that fur floating up all around the polar bear.
[3:14:16.840 --> 3:14:19.400]  That keeps them afloat, they just paddle away.
[3:14:19.400 --> 3:14:24.240]  And then there's stories about polar bears eating their young, well, the male polar bear,
[3:14:24.240 --> 3:14:27.240]  that's a common practice amongst the male polar bear is to eat.
[3:14:27.240 --> 3:14:32.920]  So does the grizzly, so does the lion, so does the tiger, so does the wolf, they go
[3:14:32.920 --> 3:14:36.880]  and kill the males, so they won't be threatened for supremacy.
[3:14:36.880 --> 3:14:42.400]  Exactly, and yet these stories come out in completely distorted ways, but of course,
[3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:47.400]  this is the game, it's the emotional game, it's the game, the emotional game of extinction.
[3:14:47.400 --> 3:14:52.600]  And notice that they always use what I call anthropomorphic animals, they've got to have
[3:14:52.600 --> 3:14:57.960]  the big round eyes, they've got to look cuddly, like the panda and the little polar bears
[3:14:57.960 --> 3:15:03.720]  and the seals and so on, and by the way, they killed some of these animals with kindness.
[3:15:03.720 --> 3:15:08.680]  I was flying, when I was flying on the east coast of Canada back in the 60s, we had to
[3:15:08.680 --> 3:15:15.560]  patrol the seal hunt, because these guys were battling with each other over the seals.
[3:15:15.560 --> 3:15:22.200]  I watched Greenpeace go in and spray the little white seals with green paint to make the fur
[3:15:22.200 --> 3:15:26.240]  unattractive and unusable for the seal hunters.
[3:15:26.240 --> 3:15:30.760]  But what they didn't realize was that, of course, the killer whales were coming up underneath,
[3:15:30.760 --> 3:15:35.000]  could spot the seal now, because it was nicely marked for them, and I've actually watched
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:39.040]  it from the air where they'd come up and bump the seal up into the air and then catch it
[3:15:39.040 --> 3:15:41.000]  in their mouths and it came down.
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:47.640]  It also attracted the seagulls, which would sit on the baby seal now, identified for them,
[3:15:47.640 --> 3:15:51.880]  because they're white for camouflage, and peck their eyes out and kill them that way.
[3:15:51.880 --> 3:15:57.000]  So these people are, I mean, they're just so outrageous that they're doing far, far
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:15:58.000]  more.
[3:15:58.000 --> 3:16:01.720]  And of course, Greenpeace is their own founder admits, they get some cult members that really
[3:16:01.720 --> 3:16:05.440]  believe in all this, but that's all just PR stunts when they're out there.
[3:16:05.440 --> 3:16:06.720]  They don't care if those seals die.
[3:16:06.720 --> 3:16:07.720]  They love it.
[3:16:07.720 --> 3:16:11.400]  Well, Patrick Moore, of course, the co-founder of Greenpeace, and I've been on platforms with
[3:16:11.400 --> 3:16:16.520]  him and he told me, he said that, you know, within five years, the Marxists had moved
[3:16:16.520 --> 3:16:18.520]  over and taken over the operation.
[3:16:18.520 --> 3:16:20.960]  It's quite blunt about that.
[3:16:20.960 --> 3:16:23.240]  And he said, so I just quit.
[3:16:23.240 --> 3:16:24.240]  I got away with it.
[3:16:24.240 --> 3:16:26.240]  But again, the Marxists worked for the bankers.
[3:16:26.240 --> 3:16:30.840]  They turned them loose as a scourge to take over the government, just like the UN just
[3:16:30.840 --> 3:16:31.840]  said.
[3:16:31.840 --> 3:16:34.080]  Oh no, the private banks are taking over the UN.
[3:16:34.080 --> 3:16:36.920]  Well, in fact, let's talk to somebody who disagrees with us.
[3:16:36.920 --> 3:16:38.560]  Let's talk to John in Ohio.
[3:16:38.560 --> 3:16:40.080]  John, go ahead.
[3:16:40.080 --> 3:16:41.080]  Yes.
[3:16:41.080 --> 3:16:48.720]  I consider myself a non-member of any organization and an unaffiliated person who has red marks
[3:16:48.720 --> 3:16:52.000]  and angles and linen.
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:58.560]  And I can't believe that you would, I agree totally with exactly what you're saying about
[3:16:58.560 --> 3:17:01.760]  the phoniness of a man-made global warming.
[3:17:01.760 --> 3:17:02.760]  I agree.
[3:17:02.760 --> 3:17:07.600]  But at the same time, the kinds of people that I, that reveal themselves as neocons,
[3:17:07.600 --> 3:17:13.560]  unfortunately, Lord Mockin says incredibly important things, but then calls it communist,
[3:17:13.560 --> 3:17:14.560]  calls it communism.
[3:17:14.560 --> 3:17:19.880]  This is a, this is a kind of a way of discrediting all the good things he's saying by putting
[3:17:19.880 --> 3:17:23.880]  it into the nutty fifties, uh, Birchite, McCarthyist-
[3:17:23.880 --> 3:17:24.880]  Hey, listen buddy.
[3:17:24.880 --> 3:17:25.880]  Hey, hey, hey.
[3:17:25.880 --> 3:17:26.880]  Stop just a minute, John.
[3:17:26.880 --> 3:17:31.720]  I can't play these games with you, uh, almost all of Obama's administration wrote books
[3:17:31.720 --> 3:17:34.760]  calling themselves communist or socialist.
[3:17:34.760 --> 3:17:37.420]  Now you, you just don't get it.
[3:17:37.420 --> 3:17:41.960]  You don't understand that the big banks have always funded collectivist to fool the people
[3:17:41.960 --> 3:17:45.360]  just like they fool the third world at the UN and to think and they're going to get to
[3:17:45.360 --> 3:17:46.360]  loot America.
[3:17:46.360 --> 3:17:48.960]  And then at the last minute they bait and switch them.
[3:17:48.960 --> 3:17:51.800]  You build any command and control architecture.
[3:17:51.800 --> 3:17:57.080]  That's going to be used by the most powerful to extract wealth and power.
[3:17:57.080 --> 3:17:58.080]  Okay.
[3:17:58.080 --> 3:18:00.260]  So we've been right about everything.
[3:18:00.260 --> 3:18:02.240]  We understand the political paradigm.
[3:18:02.240 --> 3:18:04.440]  I go past the left-right paradigm.
[3:18:04.440 --> 3:18:09.200]  Sure I'll have a Lord Mockin on or something who's fighting it from a conservative perspective.
[3:18:09.200 --> 3:18:10.200]  More power to him.
[3:18:10.200 --> 3:18:14.360]  You know, this is not like a church or something where you've got to say the rights perfectly
[3:18:14.360 --> 3:18:18.880]  right here on air or you're not part of the church of Alex Jones, John, uh, comments to
[3:18:18.880 --> 3:18:21.040]  what John is saying, uh, Dr. Boll.
[3:18:21.040 --> 3:18:22.040]  Yeah.
[3:18:22.040 --> 3:18:23.040]  Well, I'd like to comment in that.
[3:18:23.040 --> 3:18:24.040]  Um, yes.
[3:18:24.040 --> 3:18:28.680]  If you take the pure theory of Marxism and Engels and so on, and I've read all of that
[3:18:28.680 --> 3:18:33.440]  as well, John, um, yeah, there, there's some, some logic in it.
[3:18:33.440 --> 3:18:38.280]  The illogic is of course in that, uh, you have total government control and therefore,
[3:18:38.280 --> 3:18:45.400]  uh, individualism is stamped out and from a, uh, uh, a, um, evolutionary point of view,
[3:18:45.400 --> 3:18:50.400]  it's that individualism that has, that, uh, advances society and that's certainly true
[3:18:50.400 --> 3:18:51.400]  in the West.
[3:18:51.400 --> 3:18:52.400]  Yeah.
[3:18:52.400 --> 3:18:53.400]  The state never withers away.
[3:18:53.400 --> 3:18:54.400]  It only gets bigger.
[3:18:54.400 --> 3:18:55.400]  Yeah.
[3:18:55.400 --> 3:18:56.400]  Okay.
[3:18:56.400 --> 3:18:59.920]  Now, but the other problem is that it isn't necessarily whether it's a communist or, or
[3:18:59.920 --> 3:19:01.920]  conservative issue.
[3:19:01.920 --> 3:19:09.160]  We are also suffering Alex from, um, the, the, uh, fallout from the second world war because
[3:19:09.160 --> 3:19:11.960]  I lived in England through the second world war.
[3:19:11.960 --> 3:19:17.440]  And what happened in the war in England and also in the US was that for the sake of defending
[3:19:17.440 --> 3:19:23.360]  the nation, everybody agreed to surrender their individual rights to the government.
[3:19:23.360 --> 3:19:24.360]  Okay.
[3:19:24.360 --> 3:19:28.480]  And in England, it even got to the point where you got ration books for, you know, what,
[3:19:28.480 --> 3:19:31.800]  how many shirts you could buy and jackets you could buy everything.
[3:19:31.800 --> 3:19:32.800]  Okay.
[3:19:32.800 --> 3:19:36.240]  And, and rationing didn't come off and I know this up until 1952.
[3:19:36.240 --> 3:19:39.120]  And that set a precedent for tyrannies.
[3:19:39.120 --> 3:19:42.360]  They always use a terror threat or an environmental threat.
[3:19:42.360 --> 3:19:43.360]  Okay.
[3:19:43.360 --> 3:19:48.480]  So now Alex, what we're into is this debate about, well, what should be run by government?
[3:19:48.480 --> 3:19:51.080]  What should be run by free enterprise?
[3:19:51.080 --> 3:19:56.640]  And we are so confused now because we've had, uh, since the war, 70 years of government
[3:19:56.640 --> 3:20:03.320]  doing more and more and more that we've got a break, got a break electricity goes out.
[3:20:03.320 --> 3:20:07.320]  How will you boil water, cook dinner, light your home or get news reports?
[3:20:07.320 --> 3:20:11.360]  Most families are not prepared for even the shortest power outage due to hurricanes, tornadoes,
[3:20:11.360 --> 3:20:15.400]  ice storms and so on, but you can prepare your family for emergencies and not spend
[3:20:15.400 --> 3:20:18.120]  a lot doing it with the amazing products from Carol Stove.

[3:21:03.080 --> 3:21:06.800]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:21:06.800 --> 3:21:09.960]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:21:09.960 --> 3:21:14.320]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[3:21:14.320 --> 3:21:15.320]  at home.
[3:21:15.320 --> 3:21:19.960]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[3:21:19.960 --> 3:21:20.960]  calling the shots.
[3:21:20.960 --> 3:21:26.280]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:21:26.280 --> 3:21:31.840]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel,
[3:21:31.840 --> 3:21:36.320]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:21:36.320 --> 3:21:38.840]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:21:38.840 --> 3:21:42.760]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:21:42.760 --> 3:21:48.840]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[3:21:48.840 --> 3:21:49.840]  of the Republic.

[3:22:07.360 --> 3:22:14.320]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for 11.8544, 5.9272 for a half ounce or 296.36
[3:22:14.320 --> 3:22:15.320]  for the quarter ounce.
[3:22:15.320 --> 3:22:20.520]  That's 11.8544, 5.9272 or 296.36.
[3:22:20.520 --> 3:22:26.920]  On June 4, 1963, executive order 11,110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal
[3:22:26.920 --> 3:22:31.040]  Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[3:22:31.040 --> 3:22:34.200]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[3:22:34.200 --> 3:22:37.560]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[3:22:37.560 --> 3:22:40.560]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[3:22:40.560 --> 3:22:46.480]  Midas has the Kennedy v. Fed document, call 800-686-2237.
[3:22:46.480 --> 3:22:48.680]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[3:22:48.680 --> 3:22:51.480]  Call 800-686-2237.
[3:22:51.480 --> 3:22:57.640]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[3:22:57.640 --> 3:23:00.080]  That's 800-686-2237.
[3:23:00.080 --> 3:23:06.680]  Hello, at ofthefield.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[3:23:06.680 --> 3:23:11.560]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on ofthefield.com.
[3:23:11.560 --> 3:23:16.360]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[3:23:16.360 --> 3:23:20.800]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf, which left me wondering if I even needed
[3:23:20.800 --> 3:23:21.800]  another book.
[3:23:21.800 --> 3:23:22.920]  Boy was I wrong.
[3:23:22.920 --> 3:23:26.040]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[3:23:26.040 --> 3:23:29.960]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[3:23:29.960 --> 3:23:33.080]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[3:23:33.080 --> 3:23:34.080]  Wow!
[3:23:34.080 --> 3:23:35.080]  I watched the DVD last night.
[3:23:35.080 --> 3:23:36.480]  I was awestruck.
[3:23:36.480 --> 3:23:38.160]  What wonderful work you have done.
[3:23:38.160 --> 3:23:40.880]  This information can bless many people.
[3:23:40.880 --> 3:23:41.880]  Thank you again.
[3:23:41.880 --> 3:23:42.880]  Thanks again.
[3:23:42.880 --> 3:23:45.840]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[3:23:45.840 --> 3:23:46.840]  Thank you.
[3:23:46.840 --> 3:23:49.880]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[3:23:49.880 --> 3:23:53.320]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[3:23:53.320 --> 3:23:59.800]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in
[3:23:59.800 --> 3:24:01.560]  the secret.
[3:24:01.560 --> 3:24:08.800]  We won't have time to play it today, but tomorrow I will.
[3:24:08.800 --> 3:24:14.680]  It's up on infowars.com, John Lennon explaining that population control was all a big myth
[3:24:14.680 --> 3:24:17.160]  to enslave people and control them.
[3:24:17.160 --> 3:24:18.480]  That was shortly before they killed him.
[3:24:18.480 --> 3:24:20.520]  He really started waking up.
[3:24:20.520 --> 3:24:24.720]  All you left us out there needed to just wake up and get with the program.
[3:24:24.720 --> 3:24:28.280]  All you fake right-wingers that love war, you need to wake up and get with the program.
[3:24:28.280 --> 3:24:29.280]  You're all being controlled.
[3:24:29.280 --> 3:24:31.480]  Tim Ball, I want to jam in some final calls.
[3:24:31.480 --> 3:24:34.000]  Our time has gone by really quick with you.
[3:24:34.000 --> 3:24:35.840]  You've done so much great work.
[3:24:35.840 --> 3:24:39.880]  You write for Canadian Free Press and other publications.
[3:24:39.880 --> 3:24:42.360]  You're in the great global warming swindle.
[3:24:42.360 --> 3:24:45.280]  What are some other places people can check out your work?
[3:24:45.280 --> 3:24:47.720]  Obviously, my film, Fall of the Republic.
[3:24:47.720 --> 3:24:48.720]  Go ahead.
[3:24:48.720 --> 3:24:49.720]  Yeah, Fall of the Republic.
[3:24:49.720 --> 3:24:55.320]  And for which I'm very grateful for that time we took friendsofscience.org, all one word.
[3:24:55.320 --> 3:24:57.360]  You mentioned the NRSP at the beginning.
[3:24:57.360 --> 3:25:00.640]  Unfortunately, Alex, because of funding, we had to shut that down.
[3:25:00.640 --> 3:25:03.120]  We couldn't even keep the webpage open.
[3:25:03.120 --> 3:25:04.120]  So that's gone.
[3:25:04.120 --> 3:25:09.720]  But Canada Free Press, friendsofscience.org, excellent sources for my work.
[3:25:09.720 --> 3:25:13.920]  And meanwhile, the media keeps saying the oil companies are funding you and others.
[3:25:13.920 --> 3:25:17.680]  When they're not funding you, the big oil companies are all for the global tax.
[3:25:17.680 --> 3:25:18.680]  Well, exactly.
[3:25:18.680 --> 3:25:24.920]  And it's one of the things that's annoying about all of this is the hypocrisy of a lot
[3:25:24.920 --> 3:25:25.920]  of these industries.
[3:25:25.920 --> 3:25:31.960]  And of course, it's another part of the game that you create with tax money, business opportunities,
[3:25:31.960 --> 3:25:34.080]  so people then ignore the facts.
[3:25:34.080 --> 3:25:37.800]  And I was at a farm meeting the other day in Alberta, and this guy is selling carbon
[3:25:37.800 --> 3:25:38.800]  credits.
[3:25:38.800 --> 3:25:42.240]  And one of the farmers said, but hang on a minute, Dr. Ball tells us there's no need
[3:25:42.240 --> 3:25:43.240]  for this.
[3:25:43.240 --> 3:25:46.800]  He said, I don't care about the science, there's a business opportunity here.
[3:25:46.800 --> 3:25:51.320]  And so they've created that to such a scale that trying to close it down is going to be
[3:25:51.320 --> 3:25:52.320]  a problem.
[3:25:52.320 --> 3:25:57.440]  Well, that's another key you just made is that Al Gore and others advertise, hey, there's
[3:25:57.440 --> 3:26:01.240]  a lot of money to be made based on taxing people, though.
[3:26:01.240 --> 3:26:03.080]  But that's why they called it cap and trade.
[3:26:03.080 --> 3:26:07.040]  You see, cap is putting the cap over that evil pollution that's coming out of those
[3:26:07.040 --> 3:26:08.760]  nasty industries.
[3:26:08.760 --> 3:26:12.720]  And oh, by the way, we can create trade and therefore there's benefits out of this.
[3:26:12.720 --> 3:26:16.040]  This is all part of the PR game.
[3:26:16.040 --> 3:26:17.040]  Well said.
[3:26:17.040 --> 3:26:21.640]  Alex in Georgia, you're on the air with our guest, Dr. Tim Ball.
[3:26:21.640 --> 3:26:26.000]  Mr. Jones, it is an honor to be speaking with you.
[3:26:26.000 --> 3:26:28.400]  Couple things that I would like to point out.
[3:26:28.400 --> 3:26:36.440]  One thing is if you go to Facebook on the page, arrest Al Gore already, which is a continuation
[3:26:36.440 --> 3:26:43.480]  of one that got taken off by another individual, but I put all this information up there.
[3:26:43.480 --> 3:26:49.200]  But on there, there is a link, and it's published by the Australian Academy of Science.
[3:26:49.200 --> 3:26:55.680]  The IPCC research data referenced on there actually states, quote, unquote, a warmer
[3:26:55.680 --> 3:27:00.320]  world will have a higher sea level because as the land and lower atmosphere of the world
[3:27:00.320 --> 3:27:03.240]  warm, heat is transferred into the ocean.
[3:27:03.240 --> 3:27:05.800]  When materials are heated, they expand.
[3:27:05.800 --> 3:27:11.840]  So the heat that is transferred causes seawater to expand, which then results in a rise in
[3:27:11.840 --> 3:27:12.840]  sea level.
[3:27:12.840 --> 3:27:19.240]  And the thing here is that water, if you wanted to conduct an experiment, go with water.
[3:27:19.240 --> 3:27:21.120]  Water expands when it gets cold.
[3:27:21.120 --> 3:27:22.680]  Everybody knows that.
[3:27:22.680 --> 3:27:23.680]  This is asinine.
[3:27:23.680 --> 3:27:25.520]  Dr. Ball is a scientist.
[3:27:25.520 --> 3:27:26.520]  You want to comment on that?
[3:27:26.520 --> 3:27:31.400]  Well, yeah, just very quickly and in a much broader sense, when I ask people over the
[3:27:31.400 --> 3:27:35.040]  years, okay, what's wrong with global warming, in fact, there's a lot of positive things
[3:27:35.040 --> 3:27:36.040]  to warming.
[3:27:36.040 --> 3:27:42.640]  A country like Canada, we'd use less energy, we'd have more farming and more reliable farming.
[3:27:42.640 --> 3:27:46.480]  But none of that's ever talked about, was all the negative things, and so you ask people
[3:27:46.480 --> 3:27:50.080]  and they think for a while and they finally say, well, the sea level is going to rise.
[3:27:50.080 --> 3:27:55.880]  That's why Gore made it such a big part of his inconvenient truth, all that computer-animated
[3:27:55.880 --> 3:27:56.880]  sea level rising.
[3:27:56.880 --> 3:28:04.360]  And of course, Gore, even the IPCC disagreed with Gore over the numbers he was giving,
[3:28:04.360 --> 3:28:06.920]  but that's why that's become such a focus.
[3:28:06.920 --> 3:28:12.440]  And of course, the other thing that the caller mentioned was the academies of science.
[3:28:12.440 --> 3:28:18.520]  They are certain people within those academies that have been coerced into using the Academy
[3:28:18.520 --> 3:28:24.680]  of Sciences to give legitimacy to this, but when people have pushed back, like in Russia,
[3:28:24.680 --> 3:28:30.760]  for example, the head of the Academy of Sciences there said, I'm not going to use this agency
[3:28:30.760 --> 3:28:33.840]  for propaganda, and they refuse to participate.
[3:28:33.840 --> 3:28:35.960]  So this is all part of the game that's going on.
[3:28:35.960 --> 3:28:39.840]  And that's the good news is more people are blowing the whistle, more scientists are
[3:28:39.840 --> 3:28:40.840]  coming out.
[3:28:40.840 --> 3:28:45.800]  I mean, we're learning that it's rare when these government-run universities and research
[3:28:45.800 --> 3:28:48.360]  facilities aren't engaged in fraud.
[3:28:48.360 --> 3:28:51.760]  I mean, they have really hired a gaggle of criminals.
[3:28:51.760 --> 3:28:53.800]  There's hundreds of thousands of scientists.
[3:28:53.800 --> 3:28:58.560]  They've hired a couple thousand that are on their payroll to run around lying.
[3:28:58.560 --> 3:29:04.960]  Well, Alex, I saw that coming in the university, the funding issue in university.
[3:29:04.960 --> 3:29:09.520]  The first place I noticed it was in our university, in fact, in Canada generally, you couldn't
[3:29:09.520 --> 3:29:13.720]  get a sabbatical unless you could prove you had funding to do something while you're
[3:29:13.720 --> 3:29:14.720]  on sabbatical.
[3:29:14.720 --> 3:29:19.080]  And then the universities, as the cutbacks came, even big universities like Harvard
[3:29:19.080 --> 3:29:23.560]  and the land-grant universities saw the cutbacks, they suddenly realized they could shave 30
[3:29:23.560 --> 3:29:29.600]  to 35% off the top of any funding, and they argued quite reasonably, oh, well, we're giving
[3:29:29.600 --> 3:29:34.520]  you office-based heat and light and no rest, but what it did was it made the funding become
[3:29:34.520 --> 3:29:37.640]  critical in your value to the university.
[3:29:37.640 --> 3:29:41.760]  And so where it was published or perished, it became get funding or perished.
[3:29:41.760 --> 3:29:43.280]  And of course, that drove it.
[3:29:43.280 --> 3:29:46.520]  And I also sat on committees where people were filling out forms.
[3:29:46.520 --> 3:29:48.880]  So that's how they took control of all the universities.
[3:29:48.880 --> 3:29:51.840]  Dr. Ball, thank you so much.
[3:29:51.840 --> 3:29:55.880]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.880 --> 3:29:59.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[3:31:01.000 --> 3:31:05.680]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want

[3:32:00.960 --> 3:32:05.640]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[3:32:05.640 --> 3:32:09.960]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:32:09.960 --> 3:32:14.280]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:32:14.280 --> 3:32:15.600]  allows you to have.
[3:32:15.600 --> 3:32:21.300]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:32:21.300 --> 3:32:25.640]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[3:32:25.640 --> 3:32:29.640]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[3:32:29.640 --> 3:32:33.120]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[3:32:33.120 --> 3:32:36.840]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[3:32:36.840 --> 3:32:41.560]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:32:41.560 --> 3:32:45.360]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:32:45.360 --> 3:32:46.740]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[3:32:46.740 --> 3:32:51.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[3:32:59.600 --> 3:33:15.640]  In just a minute, we're going to journalist, Patrick Henningson, who has been incredibly
[3:33:15.640 --> 3:33:22.280]  helpful to us with contacting a bunch of Nobel Prize-winning scientists and researchers
[3:33:22.280 --> 3:33:28.440]  that are at the Copenhagen Global Government Conference that we're going to have on in
[3:33:28.440 --> 3:33:34.520]  the next few days and through next week as this incredibly important event continues.
[3:33:34.520 --> 3:33:39.040]  We're going to be talking to him via video Skype for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and, of

[3:35:19.480 --> 3:35:20.480]  Okay.
[3:35:20.480 --> 3:35:31.840]  Going to Patrick Henningson, he was born in 1970, degree at Cal Poly, San Luis Obisco
[3:35:31.840 --> 3:35:38.000]  based in London since 93, current work, independent writer, actor, stage film and film director,
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:42.000]  former events, communications and PR consultant for U.K. companies, a lot of work in the U.S.

[3:35:47.240 --> 3:35:54.240]  Amazon rainforest, organizing music festival U.K. 2006, that's certainly worthwhile, attended
[3:35:54.240 --> 3:35:59.920]  and covered major climate skeptics conference in New York City 2009, sports, he's a former
[3:35:59.920 --> 3:36:05.440]  U.S. junior Olympic swimmer and U.S. swimming masters national finalist medal.
[3:36:05.440 --> 3:36:08.360]  And joining us via video Skype, you know, I like to point out this isn't about left
[3:36:08.360 --> 3:36:13.800]  or right, and the globalist hijacked the environmental movement and distract from all the serious
[3:36:13.800 --> 3:36:15.240]  things that are going on.
[3:36:15.240 --> 3:36:18.720]  And that's why you're going to find people from all different stripes, all different
[3:36:18.720 --> 3:36:22.880]  colors, all different religions, exposing the carbon fraud.
[3:36:22.880 --> 3:36:26.840]  And again, the devastating news that I want to, I want to, I want to get his view of the
[3:36:26.840 --> 3:36:31.080]  propaganda on the streets in Copenhagen, the people he's interviewed will get other reports
[3:36:31.080 --> 3:36:33.360]  from him and began the days to come.
[3:36:33.360 --> 3:36:40.440]  But in this short interview, the incredible news of the secret treaty, the addendum in
[3:36:40.440 --> 3:36:45.440]  the London Guardian that basically ends the UN power gives the IMF and World Bank total
[3:36:45.440 --> 3:36:49.240]  power, double the carbon taxes on the third world.
[3:36:49.240 --> 3:36:51.600]  They were suckered into getting behind this.
[3:36:51.600 --> 3:36:55.440]  Now they learn it's really about destroying their development by the eugenicist.
[3:36:55.440 --> 3:37:00.480]  So this is so diabolical and just off the charts important.
[3:37:00.480 --> 3:37:03.920]  So Patrick, good to have you here with us today from Copenhagen.
[3:37:03.920 --> 3:37:07.800]  It's good to be with you, Alex.
[3:37:07.800 --> 3:37:11.080]  You've got the floor, give us your report on the propaganda, what you're seeing, who
[3:37:11.080 --> 3:37:15.520]  you've interviewed, what it's like to see all this information coming out, the whole
[3:37:15.520 --> 3:37:19.400]  conference in deep trouble, not just from climate gate, but now the third world finding
[3:37:19.400 --> 3:37:21.520]  out it is a eugenics operation.
[3:37:21.520 --> 3:37:26.520]  Well, the first thing I'll just say is you notice it straight away when we've gotten
[3:37:26.520 --> 3:37:32.200]  to town plastered all over Copenhagen and billboards and public places are the words
[3:37:32.200 --> 3:37:39.000]  hope in Copenhagen and in America you've seen that word hope a lot in the last 18 months
[3:37:39.000 --> 3:37:45.600]  while it's all over here in Copenhagen and I think that ironically sums up the desperation
[3:37:45.600 --> 3:37:51.920]  that they're trying to pass this treaty and there's one scandal after another coming
[3:37:51.920 --> 3:37:57.800]  out in the last couple weeks and it seems to be the Danish text leak that you probably
[3:37:57.800 --> 3:38:04.240]  read about is being talked about and I believe as well as others that this might very well
[3:38:04.240 --> 3:38:11.040]  be one of the final nails in the coffin of this treaty that they're trying to sign.
[3:38:11.040 --> 3:38:18.320]  Absolutely, so the press reports are accurate that people are freaking out when they learn
[3:38:18.320 --> 3:38:23.080]  this is really an IMF World Bank taxation grab?
[3:38:23.080 --> 3:38:28.960]  It's only reinforcing what a lot of people already suspected and if you've been following
[3:38:28.960 --> 3:38:36.000]  this issue and you've been watching what the financial institutions have been doing and
[3:38:36.000 --> 3:38:42.200]  banks like JP Morgan have actually purchased carbon offset companies like one in Oxford
[3:38:42.200 --> 3:38:48.640]  I think it's called Carbon Fund is wholly owned by JP Morgan so the investment banks
[3:38:48.640 --> 3:38:54.520]  and Goldman Sachs, etc, they position themselves to ride this carbon bubble as far as it goes
[3:38:54.520 --> 3:39:00.680]  until it pops and guess who's going to pick up the tab when it pops and I think we've
[3:39:00.680 --> 3:39:05.920]  learned from all the other bubbles that's going to be us, that's the plan all along
[3:39:05.920 --> 3:39:10.520]  and I think it's really good that this did come out because it's kind of exposing what's
[3:39:10.520 --> 3:39:16.880]  the driving force behind this green movement, it's not activists, it's not environmentalists,
[3:39:16.880 --> 3:39:23.200]  it's big money, it's people like George Soros, it's people like Al Gore and the political
[3:39:23.200 --> 3:39:30.160]  apparatus that sort of is used by the financial institutions is a tool.
[3:39:30.160 --> 3:39:37.560]  But really the force behind it is about centralization of control, power, rationing energy, charging
[3:39:37.560 --> 3:39:41.960]  more for it, these are all the things that are going to come out of a Copenhagen treaty.
[3:39:41.960 --> 3:39:49.080]  The best thing that can happen with this conference is that nothing happens.
[3:39:49.080 --> 3:39:52.640]  Well those are really great points, I mean give us the feel, I mean it's one thing to
[3:39:52.640 --> 3:39:56.800]  see the billboards with a little girl saying please don't let me drown and big billboards
[3:39:56.800 --> 3:40:03.560]  of Polar Bear saying please don't let me drown, I can't swim and just ridiculous, the billboards
[3:40:03.560 --> 3:40:11.720]  of Penguin saying help us, I mean just asinine two-year-old level propaganda that's designed
[3:40:11.720 --> 3:40:18.360]  for a snail or an amoeba and then the different people you've been interviewing, Lord Monkton,
[3:40:18.360 --> 3:40:24.920]  what's happening there and where you think this whole attempt at establishing a global
[3:40:24.920 --> 3:40:28.320]  corporate dictatorship is going?
[3:40:28.320 --> 3:40:33.880]  Well we went down to the UN's compound which is really what it is, it's a giant compound
[3:40:33.880 --> 3:40:40.240]  just outside of the city and the first thing we noticed is it's basically a cross between
[3:40:40.240 --> 3:40:48.200]  a gigantic green trade fair and if you've ever been to an evangelist conference, if
[3:40:48.200 --> 3:40:55.240]  you put those two things together that's pretty much what COP15 is at the official UN site.
[3:40:55.240 --> 3:40:59.120]  So you know there's plenty of mainstream media that are going to cover what's going on there
[3:40:59.120 --> 3:41:04.880]  and for us there was no need to be down there because every other 5,000 other journalists
[3:41:04.880 --> 3:41:06.880]  are covering the same thing.
[3:41:06.880 --> 3:41:14.960]  So we went to the meeting organized by Common Sense or Climate Sense sorry and Lord Christopher
[3:41:14.960 --> 3:41:20.320]  Monkton is one of the chairs of that as is CFACT, an organization you're probably familiar
[3:41:20.320 --> 3:41:25.520]  with, you've had Mark Moreno on your show in the past, he's a great advocate, great
[3:41:25.520 --> 3:41:32.000]  speaker about this issue and it's you know there's just a fantastic lineup of speakers
[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:41.120]  there from Dr. Nils Axel Morener, a C-level expert, we interviewed him today, we interviewed
[3:41:41.120 --> 3:41:46.400]  Ian Pleimer who wrote the best-selling book Heaven and Earth, he's from Australia, very
[3:41:46.400 --> 3:41:52.360]  animated, very articulate, fantastic but none of these guys will be allowed a platform over
[3:41:52.360 --> 3:41:59.800]  at the summit for the UN and so we at this meeting have invited anybody to come and listen
[3:41:59.800 --> 3:42:06.480]  and observe but over there, invitations from the people that we have are not extended,
[3:42:06.480 --> 3:42:13.040]  so it's kind of a lopsided discussion.
[3:42:13.040 --> 3:42:18.160]  And Copenhagen is also the official UN event as you know but for those that may not, any
[3:42:18.160 --> 3:42:22.920]  even mainstream media that's been critical of them are refused, you have to agree with
[3:42:22.920 --> 3:42:28.600]  them to be able to attend to give people an idea of just how authoritarian and dictatorial
[3:42:28.600 --> 3:42:30.760]  these ghouls are.
[3:42:30.760 --> 3:42:38.720]  Sure, the UN declared Copenhagen as a UN territory during these two weeks here, how
[3:42:38.720 --> 3:42:43.280]  much, how official that is or unofficial is you know you can debate but you've got half
[3:42:43.280 --> 3:42:50.840]  of Denmark's police force currently in the city, there's a group called Climate Camp
[3:42:50.840 --> 3:42:55.080]  who's put up on their website publicly that their next Wednesday they're planning to storm
[3:42:55.080 --> 3:43:02.560]  the UN compound and occupy it and you know forcibly remove anybody that's in their way
[3:43:02.560 --> 3:43:07.200]  because they want to talk about real solutions to climate change and I find the whole thing
[3:43:07.200 --> 3:43:12.800]  completely comical because everybody inside that conference and all these people who are
[3:43:12.800 --> 3:43:18.800]  going to storm it all still subscribe to man-made global warming theory.
[3:43:18.800 --> 3:43:25.120]  Well I mean to explain how this works, the foundations on record bring in the radicals
[3:43:25.120 --> 3:43:30.960]  to tear stuff up so they can then attack any other protesters and set the precedent to
[3:43:30.960 --> 3:43:35.400]  shut down free speech and free assembly globally and they've caught them all over the world
[3:43:35.400 --> 3:43:42.280]  police staging this or hiring these foundation thugs, A, B by them acting like fools that
[3:43:42.280 --> 3:43:47.320]  will make the people pushing for the carbon taxes look more reasonable so it creates
[3:43:47.320 --> 3:43:51.800]  a false extreme. Do you want the communists that want total control or just the loving
[3:43:51.800 --> 3:43:54.800]  banks that will reasonably tax you?
[3:43:54.800 --> 3:44:00.080]  Sure they're loving to frame this in a left versus right issue you know on the left you
[3:44:00.080 --> 3:44:07.240]  have activists and hippies and anarchists and on the right you have big oil and big
[3:44:07.240 --> 3:44:12.640]  business who are apparently funding skeptics and really this isn't a left right issue at
[3:44:12.640 --> 3:44:17.440]  all and when you go and you meet some of these people, scientists, economists that we've
[3:44:17.440 --> 3:44:21.400]  talked to, they've got no partisan interest whatsoever. They're not getting a penny from
[3:44:21.400 --> 3:44:25.640]  big oil. Every single one of the people and speakers at this conference have come there
[3:44:25.640 --> 3:44:31.080]  on their own dime. They've paid for their own travel at their own expense. If it was
[3:44:31.080 --> 3:44:36.120]  funded by big oil this would be in the Marriott downtown of the SAS Radisson. Instead we're
[3:44:36.120 --> 3:44:41.960]  in some back conference small little room in Christiana which is right outside the hippie
[3:44:41.960 --> 3:44:42.960]  district.
[3:44:42.960 --> 3:44:48.160]  Meanwhile all the big oil company executives are there in Copenhagen calling for stronger
[3:44:48.160 --> 3:44:52.600]  global taxes because they're owned by the big banks that are going to run this.
[3:44:52.600 --> 3:44:59.040]  Sure. I mean it's a giant slush fund is what it is and that's evidenced by the Danish text
[3:44:59.040 --> 3:45:04.440]  leak. The World Bank is going to be handling the slush so you know and the other thing
[3:45:04.440 --> 3:45:11.400]  is the sort of desperate political moves by people in the U.S. who are desperate to ram
[3:45:11.400 --> 3:45:17.920]  through cap and trade legislation in 2010. And the reason part of this Danish text leak
[3:45:17.920 --> 3:45:23.280]  is very revealing because there's only two things that have kept hard line opponents
[3:45:23.280 --> 3:45:28.480]  of Kyoto from supporting Kyoto. One is they don't like the fact that the rich countries
[3:45:28.480 --> 3:45:34.160]  have to shoulder the burden for emissions. Check that box. The next box is they don't
[3:45:34.160 --> 3:45:38.720]  like the fact that the U.N. is handling the money. So in these Danish text leak there's
[3:45:38.720 --> 3:45:43.480]  two things. The World Bank can handle the money and they're going to stick it to the
[3:45:43.480 --> 3:45:50.040]  developing world to cap their emissions. So they thought they could by appeasing these
[3:45:50.040 --> 3:45:55.840]  two problems with right wing opponents of Kyoto they could ram through cap and trade.
[3:45:55.840 --> 3:45:59.920]  But it's obviously backfired in their face. It's invading all sorts of areas. They're
[3:45:59.920 --> 3:46:05.080]  going to see opposition from places where they haven't anticipated it. And it goes to
[3:46:05.080 --> 3:46:10.240]  show that a lot of these political elites are not very bright. They're very clever but
[3:46:10.240 --> 3:46:14.560]  they're not very bright. Well what's happening is people are leaking
[3:46:14.560 --> 3:46:19.200]  this in the age of the Internet and it's confirmed to be accurate. The London Guardian was leaked
[3:46:19.200 --> 3:46:24.440]  the information. And the third world knows it's the IMF and World Bank and reading it
[3:46:24.440 --> 3:46:29.120]  it's actually both of them. But mainly the World Bank as you said they know those are
[3:46:29.120 --> 3:46:34.720]  the groups even worse than the U.N. with loan sharking rates feeding on their countries.
[3:46:34.720 --> 3:46:39.360]  So that's why the third world the news was showing the delegates crying going we came
[3:46:39.360 --> 3:46:43.360]  here thinking we were finally going to get money for our starving people and also some
[3:46:43.360 --> 3:46:47.800]  money for ourselves. A lot of them are corrupt like government is period. And now they're
[3:46:47.800 --> 3:46:52.240]  finding out it's a total bait and switch. But we already knew that and follow the Republic
[3:46:52.240 --> 3:46:56.760]  folks as we were reading their documents. This is private corporate dictatorship.
[3:46:56.760 --> 3:47:01.680]  I cannot say that enough taxing the very air we breathe.
[3:47:01.680 --> 3:47:08.720]  You know Alex the politically elite have become so detached from reality with through
[3:47:08.720 --> 3:47:15.080]  this climate change mythology. They've ghettoized themselves in a way and they have no idea
[3:47:15.080 --> 3:47:19.160]  what the majority of the people feel about it. And the majority of the people if you
[3:47:19.160 --> 3:47:24.200]  pull them they see right through it. But you know they're so isolated in their sort of
[3:47:24.200 --> 3:47:27.840]  mythology of global warming climate change. That's right.
[3:47:27.840 --> 3:47:34.240]  Go ahead. It's you know the emperor's new clothes how how fitting Mark Craig Rucker
[3:47:34.240 --> 3:47:39.080]  from C Factor pointed this out today. So how fitting we're in the city of Hans Christian
[3:47:39.080 --> 3:47:44.200]  Anderson and the emperor has no clothes and it's the global warming emperor who has no
[3:47:44.200 --> 3:47:49.520]  clothes and no one can you know the people in that in the summit cannot see it.
[3:47:49.520 --> 3:47:53.720]  That's right. He wrote the little mermaid. He wrote all those great children's stories
[3:47:53.720 --> 3:48:00.640]  and he did write the emperor's new clothes. Yeah. Yeah. You know if there's a there's
[3:48:00.640 --> 3:48:05.560]  a Christmas tree downtown Alex the center of town it's being lit. The Christmas tree
[3:48:05.560 --> 3:48:11.400]  lights are being powered by people on bicycles. OK. Petal powered Christmas tree. If this
[3:48:11.400 --> 3:48:15.200]  treaty goes through you you and your staff are probably going to have to run your studio
[3:48:15.200 --> 3:48:20.920]  on bicycles. Unless unless the globalists give us a special
[3:48:20.920 --> 3:48:26.960]  little shit saying that we're allowed to have electricity. See it's not just taxes. According
[3:48:26.960 --> 3:48:31.640]  to this treaty unelected corporate boards are allowed to decide who can even have a
[3:48:31.640 --> 3:48:37.040]  new technology. It's actually a dark age system. They advertise that oh it's going to fund
[3:48:37.040 --> 3:48:42.320]  new technologies. No no no no no. They decide who can get funding for technologies thus
[3:48:42.320 --> 3:48:47.560]  controlling it. And are people there on the ground realizing this is an attempt to re
[3:48:47.560 --> 3:48:54.120]  institute feudalism. Well yeah this is really it's it's it's a reverse it's a reverse play
[3:48:54.120 --> 3:49:00.040]  of colonialism. So it's it's come they've come now to colonize the middle class of the
[3:49:00.040 --> 3:49:05.120]  developed world. They're done with the developing world. It's it's been colonized and it's held
[3:49:05.120 --> 3:49:10.200]  in place and this treaty would keep it that way. Now the next thing is you know the middle
[3:49:10.200 --> 3:49:16.560]  class is like a giant cow and every reparation in this treaty is another hand milking that
[3:49:16.560 --> 3:49:23.320]  cow. You know the ability to revoke intellectual property rights a two percent tax on every
[3:49:23.320 --> 3:49:28.580]  financial transaction etc. The list goes on and on and on and on. A global authority
[3:49:28.580 --> 3:49:33.640]  over all air traffic and taxes setting up a global government police force and tracking
[3:49:33.640 --> 3:49:41.440]  system taxes on all the fuels taxes on. I mean it's 700 plus new bureaucracies. Sure
[3:49:41.440 --> 3:49:47.200]  that we're all going to pay for at the end of the day as if we don't have enough bureaucracies
[3:49:47.200 --> 3:49:51.560]  to contend with it as if we don't get enough letters through the post as if we don't have
[3:49:51.560 --> 3:49:57.560]  enough fines that we have to look out for paying and so forth. So this is like Marie Antoinette
[3:49:57.560 --> 3:50:01.480]  saying let them eat cake. Everybody's starving to death and they said they want bread they
[3:50:01.480 --> 3:50:06.080]  want bread and she said let I mean it's reported she said that let them eat cake and everybody
[3:50:06.080 --> 3:50:12.240]  finally goes crazy. I mean the bankers are up there literally eating the real economy.
[3:50:12.240 --> 3:50:18.280]  Yeah I mean it's kind of surreal. I mean if you look if you've been studying this issue
[3:50:18.280 --> 3:50:23.680]  and you've been looking at the junk science that sort of underpins the climate change
[3:50:23.680 --> 3:50:30.400]  alarmist movement it's almost surreal to look at the size of this event and the amount
[3:50:30.400 --> 3:50:37.520]  of money that's been spent 140 private jets and 2,000 limousines or whatever the UN's
[3:50:37.520 --> 3:50:44.000]  laid on and it's all pinned down by something that's not happening. CO2 is not heating up
[3:50:44.000 --> 3:50:49.840]  the atmosphere. And the hookers there are so worshipful of the fraud and the hype they're
[3:50:49.840 --> 3:50:56.000]  offering free sex to their globalist banker bosses. So it's a huge orgy as well that's
[3:50:56.000 --> 3:51:01.840]  in the news just this total Sodom and Gomorrah.
[3:51:26.640 --> 3:51:32.560]  of open pollinated seeds. It's an indestructible waterproof seed bank that can even be buried
[3:51:32.560 --> 3:51:37.080]  if we face a real meltdown. And here's the best part. All the seeds in the survival
[3:51:37.080 --> 3:51:42.080]  seed bank go through strict germination testing so you can be confident you're not buying
[3:51:42.080 --> 3:51:47.880]  old seeds. Give a survival seed bank this Christmas by going to survivalseedbank.com.
[3:51:47.880 --> 3:51:55.200]  That's survivalseedbank.com or you can call 877-327-0365 to give the gift that produces
[3:51:55.200 --> 3:51:59.200]  an ongoing supply of life-sustaining food.
[3:52:02.560 --> 3:52:07.680]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[3:52:07.680 --> 3:52:13.200]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[3:52:13.200 --> 3:52:18.000]  from underneath the Americans at home. We have turned an endless influence on our president
[3:52:18.000 --> 3:52:23.920]  in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[3:52:23.920 --> 3:52:29.520]  as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[3:52:29.520 --> 3:52:35.920]  The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[3:52:35.920 --> 3:52:40.240]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches
[3:52:40.240 --> 3:52:44.880]  and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care
[3:52:44.880 --> 3:52:51.440]  and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic. Yet your copy of Fall of
[3:52:51.440 --> 3:52:58.400]  the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at

[3:54:08.160 --> 3:54:12.800]  The battle is joined. The fraud is the greatest in history.
[3:54:12.800 --> 3:54:19.520]  Think of the master plan telling everybody the earth is dying. Listing carbon dioxide is the
[3:54:19.520 --> 3:54:24.000]  problem. Ignoring all the real environmental problems. Coming in with a global corporate
[3:54:24.000 --> 3:54:28.800]  structure that is completely secret and unaccountable. That is in the treaty.
[3:54:30.560 --> 3:54:35.920]  And joining us from Copenhagen is independent journalist shooting great video. Patrick
[3:54:35.920 --> 3:54:42.000]  Henningson. Patrick give people some of the names we've been linking to some of the videos you've shot
[3:54:42.000 --> 3:54:46.320]  with Christopher Monkton, Lord Monkton and others. You've been posting them on YouTube.
[3:54:46.320 --> 3:54:51.280]  They look great. You're doing a great job. And then tell us why you were drawn as somebody who's
[3:54:51.280 --> 3:54:56.000]  been an environmental activist or real environmental activist to go to this event and get in the fight
[3:54:56.000 --> 3:55:04.080]  against these people. Well, I'll tell you how the story started, Alex. In 2006, I've always been
[3:55:04.080 --> 3:55:10.400]  in kind of an environmentally concerned person since I lived in California in the 80s and 90s.
[3:55:11.200 --> 3:55:16.560]  They tried to drill. They tried to build a pipeline from Lake Tahoe down to Los Angeles to pump,
[3:55:16.560 --> 3:55:22.160]  you know, so everyone in LA could have a green lawn. And a lot of towns along the way were
[3:55:22.160 --> 3:55:27.920]  expected to buy into this. And my town was one of them, which was San Luis Obispo. So that's how
[3:55:27.920 --> 3:55:32.960]  that was my introduction into environmental activists and try to stop this crazy insane
[3:55:32.960 --> 3:55:39.520]  pipeline that they wanted to charge everybody access to on the way down to LA. So anyway,
[3:55:39.520 --> 3:55:44.720]  fast forward a few years in London, I decided to do an event for Save the Amazon Rainforest.
[3:55:45.280 --> 3:55:52.320]  We were legally able to buy up a patch of rainforest in the Amazon base in the size of
[3:55:52.320 --> 3:55:59.600]  SOHO in central London by staging concerts all over. But anyway, I went to some meetings and
[3:55:59.600 --> 3:56:04.800]  the whole carbon credit thing was coming out at that time. And it was very invoke corporately to
[3:56:04.800 --> 3:56:10.800]  be involved in carbon neutral things. So I inquired to see, well, if we save this much, preserve
[3:56:10.800 --> 3:56:16.320]  this much virgin rainforest, how much carbon credits can our corporate sponsors get? And to
[3:56:16.320 --> 3:56:22.560]  my surprise, the answer was nothing. The whole idea of preservation wasn't on the ticket at all.
[3:56:23.520 --> 3:56:28.480]  So that's when a red flag went up in my head. And I had seen Al Gore's film and I was impressed by
[3:56:28.480 --> 3:56:36.000]  it. I don't like him personally. I've always found him as not such a savory character, but I like
[3:56:36.000 --> 3:56:42.160]  the film. And so anyway, after this experience with the carbon credits, I started noticing all
[3:56:42.160 --> 3:56:49.280]  these city bankers who were showing up at these conferences and things all very green and very
[3:56:49.280 --> 3:56:53.920]  green oriented. I thought it was quite strange because when you meet when you met real environmental
[3:56:53.920 --> 3:56:59.040]  activists, you won't find them running around in the financial district usually and wearing
[3:56:59.040 --> 3:57:04.480]  thousand pound suits. And so as bad as this system would be, I mean, you got in at the ground level
[3:57:04.480 --> 3:57:08.880]  saying, let's save rainforest and native people. And they said, buddy, this ain't about that.
[3:57:10.320 --> 3:57:16.000]  Basically, yeah, in a nutshell. So and I kept trying, I kept digging. And the further I digged,
[3:57:16.000 --> 3:57:20.640]  you know, the further I went down this rabbit hole, the more interesting it got. And that's
[3:57:20.640 --> 3:57:24.960]  uh, well, in closing, in closing, and we'll have you back up again for reporting this week or
[3:57:24.960 --> 3:57:28.080]  next week. And I'm not sure how long you're going to be in Copenhagen, but we're indebted to you
[3:57:28.080 --> 3:57:33.200]  for the great help you've given us. Now have you researched the eugenics and found out that they
[3:57:33.200 --> 3:57:37.360]  want to shut off the food to the third world because that's in the new treaty that they're
[3:57:37.360 --> 3:57:42.000]  going to have to pay double what we pay. I mean, you talk about mass murder. I mean, this isn't
[3:57:42.000 --> 3:57:46.160]  just a money-making scam. These are some bloodthirsty people. I mean, have you discovered that information?
[3:57:46.160 --> 3:57:53.680]  Well, I think you can draw these conclusions. I mean, I've seen through your material and through
[3:57:53.680 --> 3:57:58.160]  end game and fall the republic, et cetera. I think it's quite evident, but you know,
[3:57:58.160 --> 3:58:05.920]  to cut the U.S. emissions 85% by 2050, the last time the U.S. had that level of emissions was 1900.
[3:58:05.920 --> 3:58:12.800]  And the population of 1900 of the U.S. was about 90 million. So are they planning to get rid of
[3:58:12.800 --> 3:58:18.080]  four-fifths of the U.S. population to meet their emissions targets by 2050? This is a question
[3:58:18.080 --> 3:58:21.840]  everyone should ask themselves. Well, look at the head of the environment in England. He said
[3:58:21.840 --> 3:58:26.240]  they've got to go from 60 million to 30 million people in England. Same statement on Australia.
[3:58:26.240 --> 3:58:30.960]  This is eugenics, population reduction. We'll cover it more tomorrow. Retransmission starts
[3:58:30.960 --> 3:58:36.320]  now with all the key info. Great job, sir. We'll talk to you again very soon. And we'll
[3:58:36.320 --> 3:58:44.000]  listen to the websites that you want to give out. God bless you all. Great job, crew. Thank you for
[3:58:44.000 --> 3:58:53.440]  listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some
[3:58:53.440 --> 3:58:58.240]  important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[3:58:58.240 --> 3:59:03.520]  how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom
[3:59:03.520 --> 3:59:08.720]  and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you
[3:59:08.720 --> 3:59:13.680]  want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper
[3:59:13.680 --> 3:59:18.640]  identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine
[3:59:18.640 --> 3:59:23.440]  and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out
[3:59:23.440 --> 3:59:29.120]  all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom
[3:59:29.120 --> 3:59:34.400]  and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm
[3:59:34.400 --> 3:59:42.640]  Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
