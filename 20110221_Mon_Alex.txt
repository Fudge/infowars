[00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.302]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.302 --> 00:00:08.083]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:09.823]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.823 --> 00:00:11.424]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:12.965]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.965 --> 00:00:17.147]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.147 --> 00:00:21.229]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:41.389]  Well, in the last 24 hours or so, it looks like Muammar Gaddafi has fled Tripoli.
[00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:44.131]  Libya falling in the dark of night.
[00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:49.096]  The parliament building for his puppet parliament has been set alight.
[00:00:49.096 --> 00:00:52.439]  Foreign news services are reporting.
[00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:56.923]  And the rebellions are spreading over many different areas of North Africa and the Middle East.
[00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:05.504]  There have also been a lot of protests and people being snatched off the streets in Communist China.
[00:01:05.504 --> 00:01:10.310]  And what's happened during this economic turmoil and tumult?
[00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.453]  Oil jumps to two-year high.
[00:01:13.453 --> 00:01:15.776]  Gold reaches $1,400 on Middle East stocks decline.
[00:01:19.332 --> 00:01:25.074]  Gold is at $1,407.30 right now.
[00:01:25.074 --> 00:01:29.175]  Silver is surging as well.
[00:01:29.175 --> 00:01:34.097]  We'll give you some of those silver numbers coming up.
[00:01:34.097 --> 00:01:37.138]  In fact, I had my silver numbers here.
[00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:39.639]  What is it, 35 bucks right now?
[00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:40.579]  That's not in my stack.
[00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.920]  Here, let me just check it right now.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.360]  Boom!
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.961]  We'll check the silver, how much?
[00:01:48.353 --> 00:01:49.081]  34 and change.
[00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.530]  Yep, 34 and change right now.
[00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.213]  So we're going to continue to track that as it unfolds.
[00:01:59.213 --> 00:02:06.396]  And why not just open the phones up for a free-for-all for people that want to discuss these huge events that are taking place.
[00:02:06.396 --> 00:02:07.917]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:09.558]  800-259-9231 on any issue you wish to discuss.
[00:02:09.558 --> 00:02:11.799]  But I do want to get your view on what's happening in North Africa.
[00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:22.084]  And the Middle East.
[00:02:22.084 --> 00:02:26.425]  When we come back from break, I'll plow through some of this, but here's some of the headlines.
[00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:33.968]  On the run, Muammar Gaddafi flees Tripoli as protesters set the Libyan Parliament building alight.
[00:02:33.968 --> 00:02:37.469]  Protesters that took over tanks.
[00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:48.193]  You see, even if you have a disarmed population, with hatchets and clubs, they can get any weapons system they want, if you're motivated.
[00:02:49.744 --> 00:02:56.686]  Unless you've been drugged by lithium and Prozac and fluoride in the water, then you can't.
[00:02:56.686 --> 00:03:08.249]  And that's why the globalists want control of these countries, to get rid of the old dictators and put in a modern system, bring them rock and roll abortions and vaccines so they can learn to die as well.
[00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:14.410]  A Libyan tribe threatens to cut oil exports soon, and you see oil exploding because of that.
[00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.551]  There's talk about the Iranians, of course,
[00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:24.554]  Having some conflict with the Israelis in the Suez Canal there.
[00:03:24.554 --> 00:03:27.115]  That's also boosting the prices.
[00:03:27.115 --> 00:03:33.437]  EU oil companies prepare Libyan evacuations, the Associated Press is reporting.
[00:03:33.437 --> 00:03:34.938]  So that's just some of what's happening.
[00:03:34.938 --> 00:03:36.999]  We have Paul Watson's detailed report on this.
[00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:41.400]  Globalists seek to hijack Middle East revolution to topple Iran.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.602]  Very well written article that I'm going to be reading over when we come back from break.
[00:03:45.402 --> 00:04:04.771]  And an article that is stunning in its breadth and analysis that I totally agree with, and it's up on InfoWars.com right now, Libya Conquered in the Dark.
[00:04:04.771 --> 00:04:12.635]  And this great author that writes for us, we're gonna be covering Tony's report as well when we come back.
[00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:23.479]  Here's a Zero Hedge article, commodities explode as BP prepares to evacuate staff from burning Libya.
[00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:24.740]  Oh, man.
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.260]  In fact, last night, guys,
[00:04:27.847 --> 00:04:32.849]  Jaron doesn't feel well, so he came in and got the show going and left, and he was the one that was ready with it.
[00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:37.651]  It's the one Kurt had up on the front page of InfoWars last night, where Qaddafi's in his military outfit.
[00:04:37.651 --> 00:04:41.593]  His gold military outfit looks like a demonic peacock.
[00:04:41.593 --> 00:04:48.916]  I want to, just for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, but we'll also repost it on InfoWars.com, I want people to go look at this photo of this guy.
[00:04:48.916 --> 00:04:54.899]  This is the perfect archetypal image of corrupt, bloated, parasitical government.
[00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:55.759]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:56.640]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.325 --> 00:05:04.167]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:08.450]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.533]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:19.076]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:05:19.076 --> 00:05:22.378]  Not worried about them moving south.
[00:05:22.378 --> 00:05:26.120]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:34.396]  I'm looking for America.
[00:05:34.396 --> 00:05:36.038]  Wear American and be proud.
[00:05:36.038 --> 00:05:38.821]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:43.267]  Land I left free in the home of the brave.
[00:05:43.267 --> 00:05:47.412]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:05:54.838 --> 00:06:00.402]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:03.984]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:06:03.984 --> 00:06:05.285]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:06:05.285 --> 00:06:09.687]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:06:09.687 --> 00:06:15.631]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:06:15.631 --> 00:06:17.772]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:06:17.772 --> 00:06:20.454]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:06:20.794 --> 00:06:27.296]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:06:27.296 --> 00:06:29.516]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:06:29.516 --> 00:06:34.837]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:06:34.837 --> 00:06:40.138]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:06:40.138 --> 00:06:45.500]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.800]  This will freeze the cost of your
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.201]  We're good.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.141]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:09.063]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:09.063 --> 00:07:11.305]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:17.168]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:07:17.168 --> 00:07:23.412]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:23.832 --> 00:07:29.777]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:29.777 --> 00:07:33.981]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:38.285]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:38.285 --> 00:07:44.230]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.793]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:47.793 --> 00:07:49.774]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:49.774 --> 00:07:50.195]  It's here.
[00:07:50.835 --> 00:08:01.439]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:07.001]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:23.148]  Whoa!
[00:08:23.148 --> 00:08:23.628]  What a Monday!
[00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:24.268]  So much is happening.
[00:08:24.268 --> 00:08:25.329]  Gold is exploding past $1,407.
[00:08:25.329 --> 00:08:27.969]  Silver up at $34 plus an ounce.
[00:08:27.969 --> 00:08:29.730]  Gold is only continuing to climb along with silver.
[00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:30.790]  Oil is exploding in prices.
[00:08:45.014 --> 00:08:54.139]  The underlying situation is dollar devaluation, so all commodities have been going up steadily, but now you supercharge it with Libya.
[00:08:54.139 --> 00:09:08.228]  It looks like Muammar Gaddafi will probably be ousted, unless this is Western hype, but it doesn't look like it is, because many areas of Tripoli, including the Parliament building, are on fire.
[00:09:08.228 --> 00:09:12.010]  And we have an incredible article by Tony Cartolucci up at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:15.554]  I don't know.
[00:09:37.715 --> 00:09:44.099]  The prime example of government largesse and dictatorship on parade.
[00:09:44.099 --> 00:09:55.065]  So you've got to be happy about what's happening at a certain level, but the globalists are on record there positioning themselves to try to control the outcome of these revolutions.
[00:09:55.065 --> 00:10:01.209]  And some people, as I get emails and see comments, can't seem to understand what I'm saying, even though this is
[00:10:03.382 --> 00:10:06.171]  Not complex, but they're engaged in one-dimensional thinking.
[00:10:06.171 --> 00:10:09.783]  It's either, is it good that dictators are being overthrown, or is it bad?
[00:10:10.589 --> 00:10:12.711]  Not in a game of chess.
[00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:25.224]  Yes, these are bad dictators Muammar Gaddafi and of course Hosni Mubarak and others that are being toppled the last few weeks or on the verge of being toppled.
[00:10:25.224 --> 00:10:32.891]  Yes, that's a good thing at one level and the people have a beef and it's good to see humanity striking back against corruption and tyrants.
[00:10:33.672 --> 00:10:36.795]  But the question is, what's going to come out of that?
[00:10:36.795 --> 00:10:43.763]  And then we find out George Soros, the Pentagon, the State Department are all running around bragging and saying that they're behind it.
[00:10:43.763 --> 00:10:46.626]  Now then, you can't just believe them on the face of that.
[00:10:46.626 --> 00:10:48.428]  You've got to then go research it, and it's true.
[00:10:48.428 --> 00:10:49.689]  They're all over the thing.
[00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:56.956]  They sent ElBaradee in there a week before all the stuff started a month ago in Egypt.
[00:10:56.956 --> 00:10:58.638]  They're on record trying to push that.
[00:10:58.638 --> 00:11:00.560]  Now, we don't know what the outcome will be.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:12.251]  It certainly might be better for the people, and I hope so, but burning buildings, infrastructure being destroyed in countries where folks are already very poor, their oil flow slowing or even being shut off.
[00:11:13.152 --> 00:11:13.593]  I don't know.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.501]  On the face of it, if you look at the brakes, it's going to be bad.
[00:11:30.501 --> 00:11:43.466]  And if you look at Egypt, they've just put in the next row of military leaders in the junta, who were just a little bit more pro-Western, in that they've promised that they're going to get behind attacks on Iran.
[00:11:44.366 --> 00:11:54.073]  But then you've also got the Muslim Brotherhood and others orbiting around, saying that they want to take over, and you've got Iran in the vacuum trying to come in.
[00:11:54.073 --> 00:11:57.655]  So it's just a complete order out of chaos, bedlam.
[00:11:57.655 --> 00:12:02.438]  And if the globalists can get their minions in that'll get behind a war with Iran, that's good for them.
[00:12:02.438 --> 00:12:13.726]  Or if Muslim extremists, as they call them, get into control, that's good too, because then they can just expand wars against all of them and pump trillions of dollars of weapons systems into the area.
[00:12:14.806 --> 00:12:22.769]  So, any way you slice it, there's a narrow window that with all these countries in turmoil, maybe something good's gonna happen.
[00:12:22.769 --> 00:12:25.010]  A blind hog does find acorns.
[00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.951]  Broken clocks are right twice a day.
[00:12:28.951 --> 00:12:35.653]  I mean, I could take the battery out of my watch and lay it here on the counter, and in 12 hours, it will be 11-12 again.
[00:12:40.564 --> 00:12:42.666]  Does that mean my watch was working?
[00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:53.614]  If I took the battery out of it and laid it here on the table and sometimes, just randomly, as it came back around, I guess not randomly, that it would be correct?
[00:12:53.614 --> 00:12:56.176]  So, we're here looking at what's happening.
[00:12:56.176 --> 00:13:01.880]  I mean, I'm sorry, I read the books written by Zbigniew Brzezinski, like the Grand Chess Board and the others.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.543]  I read and listen to what Henry Kissinger is saying.
[00:13:04.543 --> 00:13:08.786]  I've watched them for many years getting ready for what you see in the Middle East.
[00:13:08.786 --> 00:13:09.947]  We watched them two years ago.
[00:13:10.367 --> 00:13:10.607]  I think?
[00:13:24.266 --> 00:13:38.413]  Poor, malnourished, starving, oil prices going up, heating oil prices going up, grain prices going up, everything going up, with people making just a few bucks a day, it's a big problem.
[00:13:38.413 --> 00:13:46.917]  But the globalists put the economic atmosphere, the economic dominoes in place, and now they've just decided to knock them over at the time of their choosing.
[00:13:46.917 --> 00:13:49.898]  And now I'm hearing the media blaming, oh, the fragile U.S.
[00:13:49.898 --> 00:13:51.319]  recovery, it could be
[00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:59.384]  Overturned because of what's happening in the Middle East, when we've had guests and insiders on and economists.
[00:13:59.384 --> 00:14:18.076]  I mean, look, by the way, I want to get on the horn today, and let's go ahead and call Lindsey Williams, guys, and see if he can come on today or tomorrow, because he's hitting about 95% of the balls out of the park.
[00:14:19.705 --> 00:14:33.318]  I mean, his sources, one of them, now we know the name, I knew the name years ago, Ken Frum, former head of operations for Atlantic Richfield, the other guy's even more high-powered, former CEO of an even bigger oil company, but I'm not at liberty to say that name.
[00:14:33.318 --> 00:14:39.304]  I mean, you know, these old guys, they're globalist, but it doesn't mean they're 100% right, what they're getting from their inside sources.
[00:14:42.148 --> 00:14:52.960]  But, I mean, back in October, Lindsey said, watch the Middle East, it's going to be in turmoil, but that's going to be the distraction for China and Russia.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.822]  Watch them.
[00:14:54.822 --> 00:14:58.986]  And right now, I mean, Lindsey's knocking it out of the park.
[00:14:58.986 --> 00:15:02.991]  It was Lindsey, who six months before oiled,
[00:15:05.011 --> 00:15:10.313]  Well, back in 2008, six months, I mean, oil was at like $55 a barrel when he came on the show.
[00:15:10.313 --> 00:15:13.714]  And he said, it's going to go up to $150 within six months.
[00:15:13.714 --> 00:15:15.055]  Went up to $150.
[00:15:15.055 --> 00:15:16.836]  People laughed at him at the time.
[00:15:16.836 --> 00:15:18.156]  Nobody was predicting that.
[00:15:18.156 --> 00:15:19.697]  Nobody was saying that.
[00:15:19.697 --> 00:15:22.318]  Well, he got it from Ken Frum, who just died of cancer around Christmas.
[00:15:24.025 --> 00:15:29.849]  He's still got the other sources, well, who is alive and well, basically telling him the same stuff.
[00:15:29.849 --> 00:15:39.515]  And then Lindsey comes on when it's at $149 a barrel, Brent Crude, and says, now it's going to go down to close to $40.
[00:15:39.515 --> 00:15:41.216]  And it's going to start in two months.
[00:15:41.216 --> 00:15:45.639]  Two months later, starts plunging, goes down to below $40 for a while.
[00:15:47.042 --> 00:15:50.503]  Then he comes on and says, for two years, enjoy yourselves.
[00:15:50.503 --> 00:15:52.664]  Oil's gonna stay pretty much the same.
[00:15:52.664 --> 00:15:56.845]  But then, two years from now... That was two years ago, exactly.
[00:15:56.845 --> 00:15:58.446]  It's blowing me away.
[00:15:58.446 --> 00:15:59.446]  Uh, Ken Frum.
[00:15:59.446 --> 00:16:02.247]  I mean, what do you expect the former head of Atlantic Richfield?
[00:16:02.247 --> 00:16:05.308]  You think the guy's playing Tedley Winks on the weekend?
[00:16:05.308 --> 00:16:07.108]  No, he's playing golf with the Globalist.
[00:16:07.108 --> 00:16:08.469]  He is a Globalist.
[00:16:08.469 --> 00:16:10.930]  Now a deceased one.
[00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.991]  God rest his soul.
[00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:14.791]  But, uh...
[00:16:17.981 --> 00:16:30.607]  The bottom line here is, then he tells Williams, enjoy yourself for two years, because after that, it's going to go to 150 to 200 within six months to a year.
[00:16:30.607 --> 00:16:38.431]  And here we are, let me see, October, November, December, January, here we are, four months and change.
[00:16:39.943 --> 00:16:51.446]  Four months and a few days after Williams dropped all this here, dropped these bombs, and oil is surging up to 100.
[00:16:51.446 --> 00:16:52.826]  So what is going to happen?
[00:16:52.826 --> 00:16:58.888]  We're going to continue to sit here and track it.
[00:16:58.888 --> 00:17:04.349]  But obviously this is all extremely important and it's very momentous.
[00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:08.961]  In fact, here are the reports.
[00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:10.682]  Oil jumps to two-year high.
[00:17:10.682 --> 00:17:14.344]  Gold reaches $1,407.
[00:17:14.344 --> 00:17:17.785]  On midday, stocks decline.
[00:17:17.785 --> 00:17:18.526]  This article says $1,400.
[00:17:18.526 --> 00:17:20.447]  It's gone up seven bucks since then.
[00:17:20.447 --> 00:17:21.748]  In fact, pull it up again.
[00:17:21.748 --> 00:17:24.569]  Let's see how much it's gone up in the last 15 minutes.
[00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:33.974]  Oil rose to two-year high, and gold rallied for a six-day, surpassing 1,400 an ounce as tension in the Middle East escalated.
[00:17:33.974 --> 00:17:34.635]  Stocks fell.
[00:17:35.822 --> 00:17:39.523]  on the leading energy companies with operations in Libya lower.
[00:17:39.523 --> 00:17:43.564]  Brent crude gained as much as 2.5% trading.
[00:17:43.564 --> 00:17:46.904]  In New York, gold climbed 0.9% and silver added 2.5%.
[00:17:46.904 --> 00:17:50.025]  That is a massive move in silver.
[00:17:50.025 --> 00:17:54.966]  I wish we could get Max Keiser on today too, but he's jumping on an airplane to go to the Middle East.
[00:17:54.966 --> 00:17:57.367]  He's gonna be reporting live for us from there.
[00:17:57.367 --> 00:17:59.487]  What a wild man.
[00:17:59.487 --> 00:18:03.548]  The STOXX Europe 600 Index declined.
[00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:14.658]  And going over the oil prices, again, we'll continue to break that down as it unfolds.
[00:18:14.658 --> 00:18:17.280]  But it's at 93.49.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.664]  But the futures in oil are showing it well above $100.
[00:18:22.664 --> 00:18:23.865]  So a big move there.
[00:18:23.865 --> 00:18:29.829]  And we're going to see if Ken Frum from The Grave is correct and calls it again with precision.
[00:18:32.674 --> 00:18:41.022]  And we'll see if the other former oil company CEO, who we can't name, can do that.
[00:18:41.022 --> 00:18:43.585]  It's gone up a dollar plus in the last 15 minutes.
[00:18:43.585 --> 00:18:44.946]  It's now at $1,408.
[00:18:44.946 --> 00:18:45.087]  Oh, man.
[00:18:59.913 --> 00:19:03.397]  Uh, do I want Lindsey Williams for an hour or 30 minutes?
[00:19:03.397 --> 00:19:06.521]  Uh, let's, uh, get Lindsey Williams on in the third hour.
[00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:08.383]  Full hour.
[00:19:08.383 --> 00:19:09.344]  If he can do it.
[00:19:09.344 --> 00:19:11.847]  And that's central, obviously, we gotta remind him.
[00:19:11.847 --> 00:19:15.191]  Uh, alright, we'll have Lindsey Williams on the last hour today.
[00:19:15.191 --> 00:19:15.892]  Mark Faubourg.
[00:19:16.829 --> 00:19:20.892]  Of course, the top political analyst, couldn't be a better time to have him on.
[00:19:20.892 --> 00:19:26.677]  We set this up last week, but couldn't be a better time to have him on with all of these shenanigans going on.
[00:19:26.677 --> 00:19:36.364]  Mark Faber of the Gloom, Boom, Doom Report will be joining us coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[00:19:36.364 --> 00:19:40.508]  And then Lindsey Williams will be popping in with us today.
[00:19:40.508 --> 00:19:44.431]  We'll need to tell Kurt to add that to InfoWars.com, get that up on the
[00:19:45.486 --> 00:19:52.839]  Get that up on the system, so everybody can check out that information as well.
[00:19:52.839 --> 00:19:55.924]  Alright, my friends, we are locked and loaded.
[00:19:55.924 --> 00:19:58.128]  Stay with us, the transmission will continue.
[00:20:00.543 --> 00:20:02.865]  The collapse of the dollar is imminent.
[00:20:02.865 --> 00:20:07.028]  You can protect your wealth by buying gold, silver, and strong foreign currencies.
[00:20:07.028 --> 00:20:13.753]  But what if the government confiscates your precious metals, implements exchange controls, or nationalizes your retirement?
[00:20:13.753 --> 00:20:15.034]  You need a backup plan.
[00:20:15.034 --> 00:20:19.037]  That's why you must move your wealth into an offshore asset protection structure.

[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.581]  CollapseProof.com.
[00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:53.704]  Asset protection in financially unsafe times.
[00:21:00.271 --> 00:21:01.452]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:21:01.452 --> 00:21:08.416]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:21:08.416 --> 00:21:10.998]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:21:10.998 --> 00:21:16.401]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:19.343]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:21:19.343 --> 00:21:21.404]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:21:21.644 --> 00:21:27.950]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:31.333]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:21:31.333 --> 00:21:37.159]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:21:37.159 --> 00:21:38.801]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:21:38.801 --> 00:21:40.122]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:21:40.122 --> 00:21:42.805]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:21:42.805 --> 00:21:44.226]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:21:44.326 --> 00:21:44.846]  We're good to go.
[00:21:59.778 --> 00:22:01.879]  I'm Roger Rao at Midas Resources.
[00:22:01.879 --> 00:22:08.944]  If you are going through a financial rollercoaster because of your investment in stocks, bonds, and other paper assets, perhaps you're ready for a change.
[00:22:08.944 --> 00:22:12.146]  You have an opportunity to change your financial security.
[00:22:12.146 --> 00:22:16.029]  Get the stability and peace of mind you deserve by investing in precious metals.
[00:22:16.229 --> 00:22:20.992]  Gold and silver have been a form of wealth protection for over 5,000 years all over the world.
[00:22:20.992 --> 00:22:27.216]  If you have seen your hard-earned money lose value because of inflation, sliding dollar, etc., it's time you stop the bleeding.
[00:22:27.216 --> 00:22:28.918]  The answer to your problems is simple.
[00:22:28.918 --> 00:22:32.580]  Gold and silver will protect your assets and your purchasing power.
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.162]  Physical possession of precious metals, IRA rollover, etc.
[00:22:36.162 --> 00:22:37.623]  Call me, Roger Rao, at 1-800
[00:22:38.744 --> 00:22:41.527]  Call 1-800-686-2237 Extension 178.
[00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:46.591]  Take action today when we are still accepting paper dollars for gold and silver.
[00:22:46.591 --> 00:22:47.852]  Ready for a change?

[00:22:50.154 --> 00:22:51.415]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237 Extension 178.
[00:22:59.668 --> 00:23:09.173]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[00:23:09.173 --> 00:23:10.493]  My name is Crystal.
[00:23:10.493 --> 00:23:13.415]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[00:23:13.415 --> 00:23:17.397]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[00:23:17.397 --> 00:23:21.359]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[00:23:21.539 --> 00:23:22.360]  What did Crystal do?
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.325]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[00:23:26.325 --> 00:23:32.732]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[00:23:32.732 --> 00:23:36.296]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:09.659]  Okay, we are live with huge breaking news.
[00:24:09.659 --> 00:24:16.142]  I misunderstood my producer through the glass when he said that we had Lindsey in the third hour today.
[00:24:16.142 --> 00:24:22.766]  He was giving me thumbs up, but then Lindsey explained to him that he has a family engagement that he must attend.
[00:24:22.766 --> 00:24:26.508]  He will be breaking what he says is the biggest news ever.
[00:24:27.108 --> 00:24:34.793]  And quite frankly, he's completely stunned when I'm talking to him on the phone, talking to the other living big oil company executive who I know.
[00:24:34.793 --> 00:24:36.314]  I know the name.
[00:24:36.314 --> 00:24:41.357]  It's already been separately confirmed, just like Ken Frum was confirmed separately a decade ago by...
[00:24:42.578 --> 00:24:46.621]  By, of course, Dr. Stan Monteith, not just myself.
[00:24:46.621 --> 00:24:52.025]  But talking to Lindsey, we're talking a little bit in this segment, a little bit in the next, because this segment's so short.
[00:24:52.025 --> 00:25:02.392]  Tomorrow, because he just, it's Providence that I just called him, because he just got this information two days ago, but I have to be briefed by him tonight before he'll even do this.
[00:25:02.392 --> 00:25:04.974]  He wants to know if I want to go on air with this.
[00:25:04.974 --> 00:25:07.816]  He's never asked me something like that before.
[00:25:07.816 --> 00:25:10.798]  And am I correct to say, Lindsey, you sound a little bit shaken up right now.
[00:25:11.906 --> 00:25:20.431]  I am shaken up, Alex, because there's something that is happening right now that is so big, that is so startling, it's going to infect the entire world.
[00:25:20.431 --> 00:25:22.212]  You think the Middle East?
[00:25:22.212 --> 00:25:24.373]  It definitely has something to do with the Middle East.
[00:25:24.373 --> 00:25:26.034]  It has to do with oil production.
[00:25:26.034 --> 00:25:27.575]  It has to do with oil prices.
[00:25:27.575 --> 00:25:29.195]  It has to do with the dollar.
[00:25:29.195 --> 00:25:35.399]  And I was just given this information the other day, and it goes along with what Mr. Kimprom told me before he died.
[00:25:36.079 --> 00:25:38.442]  And Alex, this is so startling.
[00:25:38.442 --> 00:25:44.287]  You'll be breaking something that the entire world is going to watch take place over the next few months' time.
[00:25:44.287 --> 00:25:50.233]  Absolutely, and this former major oil company CEO, not Ken Fromm who just died, but you know,
[00:25:51.644 --> 00:25:56.808]  It's hidden in plain view, folks, in his Energy Non-Crisis, but we're not gonna say the names here on air.
[00:25:56.808 --> 00:26:04.194]  But this is confirmed to us, and just as you said in October, you said within six months oil's gonna explode, go up to 150.
[00:26:04.194 --> 00:26:05.715]  It's already moving there.
[00:26:05.715 --> 00:26:13.321]  You said watch the Middle East, there's gonna be turmoil, but that's only the prelude to then China and the dollar.
[00:26:13.321 --> 00:26:19.546]  And you said two years ago from your sources that oil will stay the same until two years from now, and then all bedlam
[00:26:20.626 --> 00:26:26.788]  All Hades is going to break loose, like a bat out of Hades, and now it's happening.
[00:26:26.788 --> 00:26:35.512]  In 1976, when the, uh, the Gar Island discovery was made at Brutal Bay, I guess you hear the breaking in my voice.
[00:26:35.512 --> 00:26:39.293]  I just, you know, I'm so spottled over what I've got here.
[00:26:39.293 --> 00:26:49.037]  And when that took place, I asked Mr. Prom at the time, I said, Ken, why don't you open up this field and give America all the oil it needs, so without risk?
[00:26:50.058 --> 00:26:52.900]  Beholden to other countries in the world.
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:27:02.226]  He said, Chaplain, we are not going to open up the Eagle Island Field and the Arctic Wildlife Refuge until we can get the price of oil where we want it.
[00:27:02.226 --> 00:27:04.528]  That was nearly 40 years ago.
[00:27:04.528 --> 00:27:07.871]  You are seeing it happen right before your eyes right now.
[00:27:07.871 --> 00:27:10.553]  This crisis in the Middle East was created.
[00:27:10.553 --> 00:27:12.814]  It was created by the elitist of the world.
[00:27:12.814 --> 00:27:14.956]  I told you right here on your show
[00:27:15.618 --> 00:27:17.259]  Four to five months ahead of time.
[00:27:17.259 --> 00:27:21.621]  About three to four months ahead of time that they were going to bring about a crisis in the Middle East.
[00:27:21.621 --> 00:27:25.783]  I did not realize how monstrosity... Yeah, to be precise, it was mid-October.
[00:27:25.783 --> 00:27:26.983]  It's four and a half months.
[00:27:26.983 --> 00:27:27.884]  Yeah.
[00:27:27.884 --> 00:27:31.205]  Yeah, it took place exactly as Mr. Fromm had told me.
[00:27:31.205 --> 00:27:39.109]  And now, of course, they are going to continue to foment that thing in the Middle East until it takes the price of crude oil to $200 or more.
[00:27:39.109 --> 00:27:39.849]  Please, hear this.
[00:27:39.849 --> 00:27:40.269]  $200 or more.
[00:27:44.151 --> 00:27:49.753]  Last week in my area, oil went up 3 to 5 cents per day.
[00:27:49.753 --> 00:27:55.415]  You're going to see it go up so high that the American people are going to be in a horrible condition.
[00:27:55.415 --> 00:27:57.055]  And remember what they said about gold.
[00:27:57.055 --> 00:27:59.136]  They said it's all you can depend on.
[00:27:59.136 --> 00:28:00.736]  It surged past $1,408 today.
[00:28:00.736 --> 00:28:01.737]  Silver surging almost to $35 right now.
[00:28:06.613 --> 00:28:07.954]  Every bit of this is planned.
[00:28:07.954 --> 00:28:13.718]  What happened in the Middle East was planned for the purpose of taking the oil prices to where they want them to go.
[00:28:13.718 --> 00:28:17.460]  But, Alex, this thing goes so much deeper than that.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.741]  Here's what they're going to do.
[00:28:18.741 --> 00:28:21.783]  Number one, it affects the Middle East.
[00:28:21.783 --> 00:28:23.804]  You have not seen anything yet.
[00:28:23.804 --> 00:28:28.808]  Egypt was just a beginning of what's going to take place in the Middle East.
[00:28:28.808 --> 00:28:29.548]  The first domino.
[00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:31.430]  We're good to go.
[00:28:48.668 --> 00:28:55.311]  Same thing in East Texas.
[00:28:55.311 --> 00:28:56.932]  Same thing in East Texas.
[00:28:56.932 --> 00:28:57.833]  Stay there.
[00:28:57.833 --> 00:28:59.093]  Can you do five more minutes with us?
[00:28:59.093 --> 00:29:00.074]  Because this is a short segment.
[00:29:00.074 --> 00:29:04.256]  I want you to be able to lay this out as best you can as a prelude towards tomorrow, Lindsey.
[00:29:06.365 --> 00:29:24.830]  Okay, because I just wanted to throw out at you here, again, I have family who are roughnecks and engineers and petroleum engineers, people who work in oil, and that's what I've been hearing is that for the last three years, they drill new oil wells that are big, they don't even pump them.
[00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:26.231]  They hit giant gas wells.
[00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:34.273]  They just shut them off or let them trickle, and that's what they're hearing is it's ahead of a giant surge, so I'm even getting that on the ground.
[00:29:34.273 --> 00:29:34.713]  Stay there.
[00:29:35.313 --> 00:29:35.693]  Stay there.
[00:29:35.693 --> 00:29:40.895]  Lindsey Williams, I want you to be able to concisely roll through the prelude to what's coming up tomorrow.
[00:29:40.895 --> 00:29:42.335]  We'll be back in just three minutes.
[00:29:42.335 --> 00:29:46.356]  We'll spend another five with Lindsey Williams and I'm getting in to what's happening in the economy.
[00:29:46.356 --> 00:29:50.757]  But everything he's talked about is now unfolding.
[00:29:50.757 --> 00:29:52.158]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.158 --> 00:29:54.678]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.678 --> 00:29:57.359]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.623 --> 00:30:02.284]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:02.284 --> 00:30:05.647]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[00:30:05.647 --> 00:30:10.871]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[00:30:10.871 --> 00:30:14.314]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[00:30:14.314 --> 00:30:16.636]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:30:17.276 --> 00:30:20.820]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.941]  Take my word for it.
[00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:24.603]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:30:24.603 --> 00:30:31.130]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:32.631]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:30:36.315 --> 00:30:37.676]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?

[00:30:55.386 --> 00:30:55.846]  Thank you!
[00:31:00.216 --> 00:31:04.759]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.759 --> 00:31:05.680]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.103]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:09.103 --> 00:31:09.963]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.963 --> 00:31:14.847]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.847 --> 00:31:15.607]  It's true.
[00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:20.471]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.471 --> 00:31:21.292]  Number 3.
[00:31:21.292 --> 00:31:24.874]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.874 --> 00:31:28.577]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.777 --> 00:31:29.577]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.577 --> 00:31:32.338]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.338 --> 00:31:36.019]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:36.019 --> 00:31:36.800]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.961]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.961 --> 00:31:46.003]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:46.003 --> 00:31:50.184]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:50.184 --> 00:31:51.964]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:51.964 --> 00:31:56.566]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:32:00.308 --> 00:32:03.890]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:05.010]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:09.572]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:32:09.572 --> 00:32:15.515]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:32:15.515 --> 00:32:17.657]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:32:17.657 --> 00:32:20.338]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:32:20.698 --> 00:32:27.204]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:32:27.204 --> 00:32:29.405]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:32:29.405 --> 00:32:34.750]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:40.034]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:32:40.034 --> 00:32:45.419]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:32:45.419 --> 00:32:46.880]  This will freeze the cost of your food
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:47.321]  We're good.
[00:33:09.708 --> 00:33:28.622]  There is no doubt that the people have a reason to rebel, but it's also on record that Western powers triggered this, and Lindsey Williams, four months ago in October, laid out everything that's now happening today.
[00:33:28.622 --> 00:33:29.543]  And he is shaken.
[00:33:30.683 --> 00:33:36.544]  Give us as much as you can ahead of our meeting tonight so I can be clear on this, what we're going to cover tomorrow.
[00:33:36.544 --> 00:33:38.865]  But the break interrupted you.
[00:33:38.865 --> 00:33:55.488]  And again, this is information no one's gotten, new information that adds on to all the arrests, confirming it, from this former oil company CEO, even more powerful than Ken Fromm, your number two Mr. X. Lindsey, for five minutes, then we'll let you get back to your family event.
[00:33:55.488 --> 00:33:56.588]  I know they're there.
[00:33:56.588 --> 00:33:58.989]  Let's go over what he told you.
[00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:03.211]  And a prelude to what's coming up tomorrow.
[00:34:03.211 --> 00:34:28.387]  Alex, you will be breaking information on something so catastrophic tomorrow that every person listening to your broadcast will know why things are taking place in the Middle East as they are today, why the dollar will collapse by the end of 2012 as Mr. Trump told me before he passed away, why they will be opening up certain oil fields in America because the price goes up to $200 a barrel
[00:34:29.748 --> 00:34:35.292]  Why the price of the gas pump is going up to four to five dollars a gallon by the end of this year?
[00:34:35.292 --> 00:34:41.677]  You will have answers to every one of these things as to what's going to happen to the economy of the United States of America.
[00:34:41.677 --> 00:34:49.883]  And basically, in a nutshell, it started four to five months ago when they told me that they were going to have a conflict in the Middle East.
[00:34:49.883 --> 00:34:51.664]  That conflict is going to spread.
[00:34:51.664 --> 00:34:53.926]  It is only starting right now.
[00:34:54.466 --> 00:35:03.668]  At that point the price of crude oil will go to $200 a barrel where I told you two years ago that they said at a certain point it would start to go up to that point.
[00:35:03.668 --> 00:35:07.829]  I did not know at the time why they were going to take it there.
[00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:12.590]  I do now because of the other informant that gave me this information only a few days ago.
[00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:15.071]  I have it sitting right here in front of me.
[00:35:15.071 --> 00:35:18.972]  And what will happen basically is things will get so corrupt in the Middle East
[00:35:19.592 --> 00:35:27.153]  They will begin to open up certain oil fields in the United States of America, in particular the Bakken oil field, the Gull Island field.
[00:35:27.153 --> 00:35:36.075]  You must read in my book, Energy Non-Crisis, which is not even in print anymore, but if any of you have it, please read the chapter of Gull Island and blow your mind as well.
[00:35:36.075 --> 00:35:38.636]  They'll open up the Arctic Wildlife Refuge.
[00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:45.957]  They will have to begin to produce from our own soil, but they're not going to let you have the gasoline at a reasonable price at the gas pump.
[00:35:46.417 --> 00:35:57.741]  You will be paying five and six dollars a gallon there, that the oil companies will become filthy rich because of what they're doing, and every bit of this was a plan that was planned behind closed doors.
[00:35:57.741 --> 00:36:00.162]  I only knew part of it years ago.
[00:36:00.162 --> 00:36:02.323]  Little by little, I put the pieces together.
[00:36:02.323 --> 00:36:07.225]  Now, every bit of it is evident, and you can understand everything that they're doing.
[00:36:07.225 --> 00:36:12.047]  You see how this all began in the Middle East with Egypt just a few weeks ago.
[00:36:13.911 --> 00:36:14.772]  Incredible.
[00:36:14.772 --> 00:36:19.415]  And what time do you want me to call you tonight after the family event?
[00:36:19.415 --> 00:36:20.276]  Your time mountain.
[00:36:20.276 --> 00:36:21.216]  What time do you want me to call?
[00:36:21.216 --> 00:36:26.100]  Because you said we need to have a meeting before you can break this information.
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:31.043]  I need to brief you on this, Alex, so that you'll understand the ramifications of it, the background of it.
[00:36:31.043 --> 00:36:33.985]  And any time is fine with me.
[00:36:33.985 --> 00:36:36.707]  OK, but obviously after the show, because you couldn't do the third hour today.
[00:36:38.837 --> 00:36:43.181]  Yeah, we're talking about later on this afternoon, probably after 6 or 7 o'clock my time.
[00:36:43.181 --> 00:36:43.621]  Sounds great.
[00:36:57.276 --> 00:37:05.939]  Okay, well, Lindsey, we appreciate you breaking this here, and I guess it is providence that I just said, look, everything Lindsey's saying's happening.
[00:37:05.939 --> 00:37:11.121]  Better call him, and boom, I guess you were telling my producer that you were getting ready to try to call us.
[00:37:12.423 --> 00:37:17.207]  Well, no, I was just sitting back here stunned because of what I've just printed out this morning.
[00:37:17.207 --> 00:37:28.238]  Because normally you call us... Put all the pieces together over the past 40 years, put these pieces together, you understand everything they're doing right now, how the economy in America is going to be affected.
[00:37:28.858 --> 00:37:31.139]  Why the gas prices are going up.
[00:37:31.139 --> 00:37:33.059]  What's going to happen to the dollar?
[00:37:33.059 --> 00:37:38.680]  You'll know every bit of this because it's all a part of a big picture.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.781]  And when you see the whole picture, you can understand it.
[00:37:40.781 --> 00:37:48.723]  Without it, all you see is just a few things taking place in Libya or in Egypt or in Saudi Arabia.
[00:37:48.723 --> 00:37:53.204]  But then when you put all of the pieces together, you sit back and utter horror.
[00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:54.564]  That's what you'll lead us to doing.
[00:37:54.564 --> 00:37:56.845]  And Alex, somehow they've got to be stopped.
[00:37:57.952 --> 00:38:01.175]  So you're going to reveal the grand chessboard tomorrow.
[00:38:01.175 --> 00:38:03.217]  We know the globalists set up these dictators.
[00:38:03.217 --> 00:38:10.443]  Now they're getting ready to topple them, to enter this chaos, so they can then bring the solution, which is order.
[00:38:10.443 --> 00:38:12.805]  And people look at this in a one-dimensional way.
[00:38:12.805 --> 00:38:16.849]  Oh good, they're overthrowing dictators, but there's a larger ramification.
[00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:18.871]  And I know I'll learn more tonight.
[00:38:19.091 --> 00:38:23.193]  Well, I'm putting things together that, little pieces of it started back 40 years ago.
[00:38:44.998 --> 00:39:01.050]  When Mr. Prom told me those things, and now of course the whole picture is here, and the average person does not realize what's happening in the Middle East and how every bit of it was planned behind closed doors, and it relates to the dollar, it relates to gas prices, it relates to grocery prices.
[00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:06.094]  Every bit of this fits together in a big picture now, Alex, that for the first time we can see it.
[00:39:08.573 --> 00:39:09.274]  Incredible.
[00:39:09.274 --> 00:39:11.456]  All right, Lindsey, I'll call you at seven o'clock.
[00:39:11.456 --> 00:39:16.961]  Your time is sharp, and we'll call you at one o'clock tomorrow in the third hour to have you on.
[00:39:16.961 --> 00:39:18.542]  We'll probably go into overdrive as well.
[00:39:18.542 --> 00:39:21.905]  Thank you for breaking this information here, and you've certainly been proven.
[00:39:21.905 --> 00:39:23.466]  Plus, I know your sources.
[00:39:23.466 --> 00:39:25.548]  I know it's all real, but some people are doubters.
[00:39:25.548 --> 00:39:29.652]  How many times do your sources have to be right until people understand what's happening?
[00:39:30.953 --> 00:39:37.736]  Well, they were right back in 1980 when the price of crude oil went from $32 a barrel to $10.
[00:39:37.736 --> 00:39:41.258]  And I told it ahead of time, you weren't even existing back in those days.
[00:39:41.258 --> 00:39:44.219]  And then when it went from $147 a barrel to $32 a barrel, $33 a barrel,
[00:39:48.821 --> 00:39:56.345]  But then when the Middle East broke out, exactly as I've been told, uh, before Mr. Fromm died, and every bit of this.
[00:39:56.345 --> 00:40:07.051]  Now, of course, folks, I'm pleading with you to listen to what Alex is saying and listen to this material so that you'll know everything that you're going to have to face between now and the end of 2012.
[00:40:07.051 --> 00:40:08.432]  And by the way,
[00:40:08.952 --> 00:40:10.815]  I don't have anything new on this.
[00:40:10.815 --> 00:40:12.939]  I have not produced anything on it.
[00:40:12.939 --> 00:40:15.643]  I'm not here to try to sell a product tomorrow.
[00:40:15.643 --> 00:40:23.114]  I think that the American people have got to know what's going on so that they will understand the total picture of what the elite are doing right now, Alex.
[00:40:23.885 --> 00:40:24.825]  Well, absolutely.
[00:40:24.825 --> 00:40:36.589]  In fact, your book was out of print for years, and then the great folks at the Prophecy Club reached out to you, and so you're trying to get the message out through that, and people can get the whole breakdown on DVD and CD at prophecyclub.com.
[00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:45.931]  I think it's good, you know, that you're getting the information out in a vehicle to people, and obviously you couldn't sit there at home sending out tens of thousands of free DVDs and CDs.
[00:40:45.931 --> 00:40:48.472]  I'm glad you're doing it, but I mean, all of that, you know,
[00:40:49.508 --> 00:41:05.173]  Regardless, the point is, I wish tomorrow you had a new CD or something with this new information, but hopefully by next week or so you can get with the folks at Prophecy Club and help you produce that, because this is so incredibly important.
[00:41:05.173 --> 00:41:11.635]  But they'll hear it here first, and I'm very, very excited that you're gonna be breaking this down for people.
[00:41:12.635 --> 00:41:13.156]  I don't know.
[00:41:29.977 --> 00:41:41.040]  Three decades ago, Energy Non-Crisis, who is a former CEO of a big three oil company, he's telling you the exact same thing and now more.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.281]  Why do they tell you this?
[00:41:43.281 --> 00:41:55.185]  And why, you know, when Fromm called you a few years ago to threaten you to stop talking about how much oil was here in the U.S., he didn't want that discussed, but he did want other things discussed.
[00:41:55.185 --> 00:41:55.985]  Why are they doing this?
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.648]  The elitists have a code of ethics.
[00:41:59.648 --> 00:42:02.278]  They are not the same code that you and I have, Alex.
[00:42:02.975 --> 00:42:05.757]  You and I are Bible believers.
[00:42:05.757 --> 00:42:07.258]  We believe in Jesus Christ.
[00:42:07.258 --> 00:42:09.280]  We believe in honest indecency.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.062]  These people, in their code of ethics, do have one facet to it.
[00:42:13.062 --> 00:42:17.386]  That is, they must tell the world what they're going to do before they do it.
[00:42:17.386 --> 00:42:31.176]  Now, some of the things that I'll be giving on tomorrow, not necessarily things that they're trying to give out right now, but even though I think definitely my present informant sent me this information just
[00:42:32.016 --> 00:42:46.603]  Uh, hours ago, and this is what I'll be giving on the air tomorrow, but I have to put the total picture together way back years ago, when, uh, I'll tell the story tomorrow of how Mr. Ken Brom is actually fired from Atlanta Richfield one time.
[00:42:46.603 --> 00:42:50.925]  Nobody's ever heard this before, except for one or two broadcasts anywhere in the world.
[00:42:50.925 --> 00:42:53.046]  And it's in my book, Energy Non-Crisis.
[00:42:53.046 --> 00:42:57.348]  Then he wrote the chapter, If Bill Island Doesn't Blow Your Mind, This Will.
[00:42:57.348 --> 00:42:59.789]  This thing that's happening right now in the Middle East,
[00:43:00.459 --> 00:43:05.301]  It goes all the way back to pieces that were put together way back then.
[00:43:05.301 --> 00:43:11.864]  Well I read your book, I mean, I read your book 15 years ago, you know, after it had already been out for over a decade.
[00:43:11.864 --> 00:43:12.604]  When was it published?
[00:43:13.672 --> 00:43:16.094]  It was published, I think, in 1980.
[00:43:16.094 --> 00:43:30.806]  Okay, so I read it 15 years after it had been published, and you talked about the oil barons, how they were going to set the Arabs up, how they were getting them to invest in dollars, and how later they were planning to basically shut them down and then develop the fields.
[00:43:30.806 --> 00:43:42.435]  So really, and now we see it happening, but what you're saying is now they're getting ready to engage it, and then the ramifications of that globally, with rebellion spreading worldwide, am I guessing correctly where this is going?
[00:43:43.123 --> 00:43:44.163]  You're guessing correctly.
[00:43:44.163 --> 00:43:46.444]  You're seeing something take place right now.
[00:43:46.444 --> 00:43:49.785]  It's been in the planning stages for probably 40 years.
[00:43:49.785 --> 00:43:52.646]  And you're seeing the full film on it right before your eyes.
[00:43:52.646 --> 00:44:01.308]  But how it's going to affect the average American is the part that you must know so that you can help protect yourself in light of what's taking place.
[00:44:01.488 --> 00:44:08.412]  Well, we know Homeland Security's been gearing up the whole time to suppress the American people while baiting and switching that it was for Muslim extremists.
[00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:13.895]  Their own internal documents that law enforcement has sent us over and over again from different angles show that.
[00:44:13.895 --> 00:44:15.476]  And so they have prepared this.
[00:44:15.476 --> 00:44:19.919]  And I was just in closing, I was listening to local news radio.
[00:44:20.879 --> 00:44:21.099]  This is
[00:44:37.528 --> 00:44:42.232]  For desalinization plants in the Gulf of Mexico and for all these other systems.
[00:44:42.232 --> 00:44:51.039]  And when you actually study the power grid or FCC electronics regulations or everything, it's in 25 and 50 year plans.
[00:44:51.039 --> 00:44:52.741]  Brzezinski writes about this.
[00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:56.924]  And then people look at us and laugh at us and say they're not working in 50 year plans.
[00:44:56.924 --> 00:45:00.307]  They have this lie that Wall Street's only on a quarterly basis.
[00:45:00.307 --> 00:45:04.631]  They keep the public thinking quarter by quarter, you know, every three months.
[00:45:05.451 --> 00:45:22.860]  But no, the globalists, the British Empire model, not that the British run it, but again we've adopted that, the globalists have, is in 25 and 50 year increments, and it's hidden all over the place that this is their strategic plan, and that's why it's so hard to beat, because they are following a blueprint.
[00:45:24.389 --> 00:45:40.018]  When this information was given to me just hours ago, the individual who sent it to me, who is, you know who he is Alex, and Mr. Dr. Stan Monteith, talked to him personally before he no longer was willing to be talked to.
[00:45:40.018 --> 00:45:47.462]  He said right across the top of the piece of paper, in big letters, he said, you better sit down.
[00:45:47.462 --> 00:45:51.985]  And this is a man who knows the whole total plan of what's taking place.
[00:45:53.027 --> 00:45:58.488]  This affects every facet of our lives because of what they're doing.
[00:45:58.488 --> 00:46:04.530]  And what it's going to do to America, you need to know about right now so that you'll know how to make plans.
[00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:07.011]  Wow, Lindsey, I hear a completely different tone.
[00:46:07.011 --> 00:46:13.192]  I mean, you've always had one of concern, but now I hear cold focus.
[00:46:13.192 --> 00:46:20.434]  I mean, like you've been braced by almost like I hear resignation in your voice.
[00:46:21.598 --> 00:46:23.479]  Well, Alex, I don't know how to say this.
[00:46:23.479 --> 00:46:26.361]  You know, I was brought up in a Christian home.
[00:46:26.361 --> 00:46:28.062]  And I was a minister of the gospel.
[00:46:28.062 --> 00:46:31.084]  I've been a minister of the gospel for 50 years.
[00:46:31.084 --> 00:46:35.907]  And I've always been taught that the right thing to do was honesty.
[00:46:35.907 --> 00:46:41.891]  And whatever I see taking place, what's taking place right now, I can't help but be stirred and moved.
[00:46:41.891 --> 00:46:45.814]  Because this plan is so catastrophic.
[00:46:45.814 --> 00:46:50.237]  It deals with everything from hundreds of people being killed in the Middle East.
[00:46:51.821 --> 00:46:53.962]  Life means nothing to them.
[00:46:53.962 --> 00:47:02.065]  There are hundreds of people, maybe thousands of people that are going to die in the Middle East in order to bring about the plan that the elitists want to be brought about.
[00:47:02.065 --> 00:47:05.606]  Secondly, it's going to be the destruction of the American dollar.
[00:47:05.606 --> 00:47:13.489]  Because can you imagine what will happen whenever the trucker, big tractor-trailer rig operator, was here in my home the other day?
[00:47:13.889 --> 00:47:15.290]  And the globalists are going
[00:47:42.165 --> 00:47:55.868]  Why should crude oil go to $200 a barrel only for the sole purpose of them being able to bring on oil fields that they have known were there for years and they finally are going to produce them because they can get filthy rich off of it.
[00:47:57.492 --> 00:47:57.772]  Yes.
[00:48:13.857 --> 00:48:37.545]  Telling the poor, loot them by voting for socialism, then they'll take the middle class's money, the final engine of independence, and give some of it as chicken feed to the poor, the rest to the offshore globalists, pressure from above and below, and we're going to see the New World Order try to orchestrate a revolution in this country, but a revolution to destroy the republic, a false revolution.
[00:48:37.545 --> 00:48:38.585]  Is that what he was telling you?
[00:48:39.724 --> 00:48:43.126]  Basically in a nutshell, Alex, that's exactly right.
[00:48:43.126 --> 00:48:57.916]  And everything that your listening audience has heard you say, folks, please believe what Alex Jones is saying because you will see that this fits perfectly into the plan that I will try to tell you about on tomorrow here on this program.
[00:48:58.596 --> 00:48:58.856]  Incredible.
[00:48:58.856 --> 00:49:00.698]  Lindsey, I'm going to let you go.
[00:49:00.698 --> 00:49:01.579]  I appreciate the time.
[00:49:01.579 --> 00:49:02.579]  Get back to your family.
[00:49:02.579 --> 00:49:04.461]  I'll call you at 7 Mountain Central.
[00:49:19.873 --> 00:49:21.374]  Again, I'm no rocket scientist.
[00:49:21.374 --> 00:49:26.297]  We've seen the globalists do this in third world countries hundreds of times.
[00:49:26.297 --> 00:49:31.920]  There's over 170 third world nations for folks that don't know, and sometimes they do it every year in the countries.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.161]  It's a cycle.
[00:49:33.161 --> 00:49:46.288]  And so of course I know what they're going to do without even talking to Mr. L or the deceased Mr. X, because we know what their program is, but now they're going for the whole world at once.
[00:49:46.288 --> 00:49:47.709]  Is that basically what you're saying, Lindsey?
[00:49:48.447 --> 00:49:52.620]  Yes, Alex, and I would urge every listener to your program today.
[00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:53.021]  Please!
[00:49:53.996 --> 00:49:56.017]  Call every relative you know.
[00:49:56.017 --> 00:49:58.778]  Get every person that you can possibly think of.
[00:49:58.778 --> 00:50:00.538]  Anybody that you've ever known.
[00:50:00.538 --> 00:50:03.339]  And get them to listen to Alex Jones Show on tomorrow.
[00:50:03.339 --> 00:50:05.520]  America has got to know this.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:16.563]  And if Alex can use this program, InfoWars, to be able to warn the American people now, maybe there's something we can do about this before it's too late.
[00:50:16.563 --> 00:50:18.244]  So call every person.
[00:50:18.244 --> 00:50:19.804]  Knock on every door.
[00:50:19.804 --> 00:50:21.825]  Send an email to every person you can.
[00:50:22.325 --> 00:50:27.608]  Get them to listen to the Alex Jones Show on tomorrow so they'll know what's going to happen.
[00:50:27.608 --> 00:50:28.789]  Alright, God bless you.
[00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:34.652]  We will talk to you coming up in about 25 hours from now, tomorrow.
[00:50:34.652 --> 00:50:35.672]  Here live, Lindsey.
[00:50:35.672 --> 00:50:36.293]  God bless you.
[00:50:36.293 --> 00:50:39.194]  I'll talk to you tonight.
[00:50:39.194 --> 00:50:40.615]  I'll say bye to you during the break, Lindsey.
[00:50:40.615 --> 00:50:40.935]  Stay there.
[00:50:40.935 --> 00:50:42.016]  One more moment.
[00:50:42.016 --> 00:50:44.377]  Military aircraft fire at Libyan crowds.
[00:50:44.377 --> 00:50:47.078]  Al Jazeera, Reuters is reporting.
[00:50:47.078 --> 00:50:49.180]  It is absolute bad luck reportedly there.
[00:50:50.831 --> 00:50:54.746]  Pray for all those women and children, ladies and gentlemen, that they be protected.
[00:50:54.746 --> 00:50:55.428]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:55.428 --> 00:50:55.850]  Stay with us.
[00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:56.994]  I don't even know what to say at this point.
[00:51:01.164 --> 00:51:05.827]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:51:59.189 --> 00:52:01.710]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:08.672]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:52:08.672 --> 00:52:11.253]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:52:11.253 --> 00:52:16.655]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:52:16.655 --> 00:52:19.596]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:52:19.596 --> 00:52:21.677]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:52:21.917 --> 00:52:28.200]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:31.601]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:52:31.601 --> 00:52:37.424]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:52:37.424 --> 00:52:39.065]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:52:39.065 --> 00:52:40.385]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:52:40.385 --> 00:52:43.066]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:52:43.066 --> 00:52:44.487]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:52:44.747 --> 00:52:47.291]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:52:47.291 --> 00:52:51.858]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:52:51.858 --> 00:52:54.462]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:52:54.462 --> 00:52:58.228]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:52:58.228 --> 00:52:59.230]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:53:02.281 --> 00:53:03.501]  This is not a drill.
[00:53:03.501 --> 00:53:06.022]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:53:06.022 --> 00:53:07.923]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:53:07.923 --> 00:53:15.125]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:19.526]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:53:19.526 --> 00:53:29.809]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:53:30.029 --> 00:53:31.670]  Under any circumstance.
[00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:38.893]  These and other closely guarded gun cashing secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:53:38.893 --> 00:53:39.674]  But listen up.
[00:53:39.674 --> 00:53:45.817]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:53:45.817 --> 00:53:47.678]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[00:53:47.678 --> 00:53:49.839]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[00:53:49.839 --> 00:53:50.319]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:53:50.319 --> 00:53:52.220]  Before they come for your guns.
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:52.820]  Hideyourguns.com.
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:53.400]  Right now.
[00:54:08.507 --> 00:54:12.908]  Didn't take any chances.
[00:54:12.908 --> 00:54:26.771]  I was a prisoner of doubt.
[00:54:26.771 --> 00:54:33.173]  You gotta know that it's exciting what's happening and frightening.
[00:54:39.139 --> 00:54:46.950]  If we can get the word out about the globalist plan, as people then see it unfold, we probably can't stop what's happening.
[00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:53.960]  But as Ron Paul and others have said who understand history, we can strategically get the info out so that they, in the next phase,
[00:54:54.861 --> 00:54:59.763]  Can be defeated because people will know who the globalists are and that they engineered this.
[00:54:59.763 --> 00:55:07.145]  And then they won't be able to use the bedlam and the breakdown of society as a way to roll in their complete world government.
[00:55:07.145 --> 00:55:13.648]  But because they control the currency and the energy, they've got two of the main strategic choke points covered.
[00:55:13.648 --> 00:55:16.129]  But we have info war.
[00:55:16.129 --> 00:55:17.809]  And you think people are waking up now?
[00:55:17.809 --> 00:55:20.010]  You wait till we go into full depression.
[00:55:21.204 --> 00:55:25.769]  Oh, people are really going to be listening and everything we've said for years is going to be gold.
[00:55:25.769 --> 00:55:27.251]  It's going to be evergreen.
[00:55:27.251 --> 00:55:32.858]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up and then we're going to open the phones up in the next hour and get into all that's happening in the Middle East and worldwide.
[00:55:32.858 --> 00:55:36.963]  Ted, we told folks people look at a gold and silver graph on a month-to-month basis.
[00:55:37.463 --> 00:55:41.525]  And they go, my gosh, gold went down $50, silver went down $2.
[00:55:41.525 --> 00:55:42.865]  It's not a good deal.
[00:55:42.865 --> 00:55:44.566]  What's Alex telling us?
[00:55:44.566 --> 00:55:46.286]  Look at the 11-year graph.
[00:55:46.286 --> 00:55:48.247]  It's going straight up, both of them.
[00:55:48.247 --> 00:55:50.428]  This is what happens when they devalue currencies.
[00:55:50.428 --> 00:55:52.369]  It's a law of economics.
[00:55:53.476 --> 00:56:12.840]  Alex, I can tell you this right now, every time gold and silver backs off like this and the people get scared, it's like, you know, I wish they had the experience... You rush in and start buying it up greedily, because you understand, and then you sell it for lower prices once it goes up, and that's how you're starting to dominate the market with good old free market economics, Ted.
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:14.041]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:56:14.041 --> 00:56:26.809]  I can tell you right now, if you see gold and silver going down, and you know that the problems that we have that are driving gold and silver prices haven't been solved yet, by all means, when silver's down, when gold is down, buy all you can.
[00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:28.030]  Because, you know what?
[00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:31.653]  The next crisis is right around the corner, and now we're looking at it right now.
[00:56:31.653 --> 00:56:35.135]  I mean, Libya is firing on their own people!
[00:56:35.135 --> 00:56:42.120]  Could you imagine being in their army, and your brothers and sisters could be standing in that crowd, and your orders are to fire on them?
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.242]  Could you imagine being in opposition?
[00:57:01.301 --> 00:57:01.882]  I think so.
[00:57:17.284 --> 00:57:20.286]  Well, you know what, I'm holding on to this one, but it won't be very long.
[00:57:20.286 --> 00:57:25.450]  I can tell you right now, if you want liberty, get Alex's videos, because that's what's driving the force.
[00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:31.495]  People are standing up, they're passing these videos out, and they're realizing who the real... Yeah, you got a deal.
[00:57:31.495 --> 00:57:34.558]  $97 for three silver dollars, three of my most powerful films and free shipping.
[00:57:34.558 --> 00:57:36.899]  It's a $70 plus discount.
[00:57:36.899 --> 00:57:38.581]  Actually, more now that silver's gone up even more.
[00:57:38.581 --> 00:57:38.641]  800-686-2237.
[00:57:38.641 --> 00:57:38.741]  800-686-2237.
[00:57:38.741 --> 00:57:40.482]  What smoking deals do you have on gold right now?
[00:57:46.827 --> 00:57:48.729]  Alex Franks at $3.08.
[00:57:48.729 --> 00:57:50.530]  British Sovereigns at $3.86.
[00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:55.174]  I mean, currently, right now, you can pick up $20 Liberties at $17.24.
[00:57:55.174 --> 00:57:57.276]  They used to be double gold price.
[00:57:57.276 --> 00:57:59.277]  I mean, go with the U.S.
[00:57:59.277 --> 00:58:00.438]  Eagle or the Bars.
[00:58:00.438 --> 00:58:01.739]  I mean, I don't care.
[00:58:01.739 --> 00:58:04.202]  But right now, the economy is imploding.
[00:58:04.202 --> 00:58:06.624]  We have more problems than you can speak of.
[00:58:06.624 --> 00:58:10.026]  The dollar is not going to hold value during a time like this.
[00:58:10.026 --> 00:58:13.869]  And that video silver piece, I can tell you, silver ran up 4% today.
[00:58:13.869 --> 00:58:14.490]  It went over
[00:58:15.791 --> 00:58:17.232]  It went over $34 today.
[00:58:17.232 --> 00:58:21.975]  I mean, my goodness, what more do you need at $97?
[00:58:21.975 --> 00:58:26.899]  You can't beat that!
[00:58:26.899 --> 00:58:27.119]  800-686-2237.
[00:58:27.119 --> 00:58:29.180]  800-686-2237.
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:32.022]  A perfect way to get into gold and silver today.
[00:58:32.022 --> 00:58:37.866]  We got Mark Fauber coming up, a top geopolitical financial analyst and a lot more.
[00:58:37.866 --> 00:58:37.906]  800-686-2237.
[00:58:44.332 --> 00:58:50.677]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.677 --> 00:58:51.818]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:58:51.818 --> 00:58:58.764]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:58:58.764 --> 00:59:01.326]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:59:01.326 --> 00:59:06.710]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:09.752]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:59:09.752 --> 00:59:11.814]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:59:12.054 --> 00:59:18.299]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:59:18.299 --> 00:59:21.681]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:59:21.681 --> 00:59:27.465]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:59:27.465 --> 00:59:29.106]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:59:29.106 --> 00:59:30.407]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:59:30.407 --> 00:59:33.089]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:59:33.089 --> 00:59:37.312]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:59:37.312 --> 00:59:39.334]  You can find the video at www.
[00:59:40.094 --> 00:59:41.896]  End of America 3.com.
[00:59:41.896 --> 00:59:44.500]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:48.364]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:59:48.364 --> 00:59:53.611]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:59:53.611 --> 00:59:55.994]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.994 --> 00:59:58.777]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.322 --> 01:00:06.622]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.622 --> 01:00:08.383]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.383 --> 01:00:10.143]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.143 --> 01:00:11.743]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.743 --> 01:00:13.284]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.284 --> 01:00:17.484]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.484 --> 01:00:21.665]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.665 --> 01:00:27.866]  Cry havoc and let loose the dogs of revolution and war.
[01:00:27.866 --> 01:00:30.527]  Hundreds protest in Iraq, TV station torched.
[01:00:31.718 --> 01:00:33.540]  People are like, why would the globalists want this?
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:36.122]  Why would they want Libya overthrowing Egypt?
[01:00:36.122 --> 01:00:46.011]  Because they're planning to jack up world energy prices and fully implode the economy and bankrupt the general population and drive them into the arms of the government.
[01:00:46.011 --> 01:00:50.055]  I'm going to come back in the next segment and kind of recap all these new developments.
[01:00:50.055 --> 01:00:51.657]  They're coming in quick.
[01:00:51.657 --> 01:00:53.078]  This has all been forecast.
[01:00:53.078 --> 01:00:55.621]  Again, they're real rebellions by oppressed people.
[01:00:56.533 --> 01:00:58.194]  But the globalists can just sit back.
[01:00:58.194 --> 01:01:14.427]  They know sociological factors that are involved in the prospectus written by the IMF and World Bank, known as the IMF riot, that this stuff will burn itself out within six months, and then everything's basically in shambles, and then they can come in and really take control of those countries even more.
[01:01:14.427 --> 01:01:22.814]  And during the interim, when oil gets disrupted and pipelines getting blown up in Egypt and shut down in Libya,
[01:01:24.361 --> 01:01:32.568]  And Iran sending warships, that's confirmed, through the Suez Canal, and Israel threatening to blow them to kingdom come.
[01:01:32.568 --> 01:01:33.669]  Whoa!
[01:01:33.669 --> 01:01:34.169]  Whoa!
[01:01:34.169 --> 01:01:36.371]  I mean, this is getting crazy!
[01:01:36.371 --> 01:01:37.792]  And I've read Brzezinski's books.
[01:01:37.792 --> 01:01:40.194]  I've read the Trilateral Commission reports that are public.
[01:01:40.194 --> 01:01:43.977]  I interview the experts.
[01:01:43.977 --> 01:01:45.779]  This is it.
[01:01:45.779 --> 01:01:49.122]  And this is all just a rollout prelude to confrontation with China.
[01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:52.651]  That's what William Sorce and others are saying.
[01:01:52.651 --> 01:02:03.697]  The globalists have conned the Chinese, conned the Arabs, conned us, and they're just playing us all off against each other as they sit like a conductor with a symphony of destruction.
[01:02:03.697 --> 01:02:06.619]  We ought to queue up a symphony of destruction.
[01:02:06.619 --> 01:02:08.440]  I know we have it in there.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.521]  Or John Harmon, you've got it up there in Minnesota.
[01:02:10.521 --> 01:02:13.062]  If you can find a symphony of destruction, let's come in with that.
[01:02:16.257 --> 01:02:18.698]  Ted, just finishing up with you, then I'm gonna come back and get into all this.
[01:02:18.698 --> 01:02:24.919]  People can notice I'm kind of calm today because it's like watching your house burn.
[01:02:24.919 --> 01:02:32.121]  It's horrible, it's terrible, but it's also kind of exciting in a sick way.
[01:02:32.121 --> 01:02:39.763]  What do they call it from World War II where the pilots would be strafing a train or an armored column and they would get target
[01:02:42.423 --> 01:02:45.130]  Psychosis and basically fly right into it.
[01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:48.880]  I mean, I'm just sitting here watching this thing start to burn and I know where it's going and
[01:02:50.718 --> 01:02:51.639]  I can feel it, Ted.
[01:02:51.639 --> 01:02:53.120]  I mean, you can feel the start.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.622]  This is the world government trying to rise up, man.
[01:02:55.622 --> 01:02:56.362]  I tell you what.
[01:02:56.362 --> 01:02:57.763]  It sure is.
[01:02:57.763 --> 01:03:03.447]  And I just hope that people recognize that and fight like holy, you know what, to stop it.
[01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:10.633]  And you know, this is going to destroy, it's just going to literally eat up and destroy the value of the currency.
[01:03:10.633 --> 01:03:19.139]  And unfortunately, anybody that saved their money or worked or has a pension or anything that has to do with the United States dollar, God help them.
[01:03:19.699 --> 01:03:20.900]  Because, you know what?
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:26.722]  People, you know, especially the retirees and the people that are working are going to be working like... But Ted, you know what else is scary?
[01:03:26.722 --> 01:03:33.424]  Do you know how prominent this is going to make Ron Paul and myself and others, that's why they positioned Beck, that we've been right about all this?
[01:03:33.424 --> 01:03:38.786]  I do not want the power that we are about to get because we have told everybody.
[01:03:38.786 --> 01:03:44.949]  I mean, I don't just feel the evil rising, I feel the 1776 rising, and I'm like, I do not want this power.
[01:03:46.029 --> 01:03:48.551]  I mean, I understand we're entering danger here, Ted.
[01:03:48.551 --> 01:03:52.615]  We have positioned ourselves as the main opposition.
[01:03:52.615 --> 01:03:53.615]  It sure has.
[01:03:53.615 --> 01:03:53.956]  What?
[01:03:53.956 --> 01:03:55.677]  I mean, what?
[01:03:55.677 --> 01:03:56.998]  Alex Jones?
[01:03:56.998 --> 01:03:58.219]  I never imagined this.
[01:03:58.219 --> 01:03:58.719]  What, me?
[01:04:01.152 --> 01:04:02.453]  Crazy, I mean it really is.
[01:04:02.453 --> 01:04:04.635]  It's amazing what's happened here, but you know what?
[01:04:04.635 --> 01:04:21.028]  It's funny when you have, when you have liberty burning in your belly and you know what the truth is, and you end up spending your life creating videos that actually move people the right direction so they can recognize what's going on, and all of a sudden now we're in the position where all this is coming down, well guess what?
[01:04:21.028 --> 01:04:24.791]  The people are going to look to you for answers, and the people that are trying to pull the
[01:04:25.231 --> 01:04:31.916]  Strings and the Puppet Masters, they're looking at Alex Jones, and they're going, oh man, we gotta get this guy, you know?
[01:04:31.916 --> 01:04:36.340]  And I just, all I can say is that, you know what?
[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:44.326]  We're doing the right thing, and that's why it's so popular, and it's gonna get more popular, and that's why I think it's so important that people take advantage.
[01:04:44.326 --> 01:04:46.908]  I mean, look, if you want liberty, get Alex's videos.
[01:04:47.188 --> 01:04:49.192]  Well, look at how the truth sets you free.
[01:04:49.192 --> 01:04:54.561]  If people would have listened to us 10 years ago and bought gold at $300 an ounce, look where they'd be.
[01:04:54.561 --> 01:04:56.404]  800-686-2237.
[01:04:56.404 --> 01:04:58.187]  I believe you ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:04:58.187 --> 01:04:59.449]  Don't.
[01:04:59.449 --> 01:05:00.170]  This is opportunity.
[01:05:01.892 --> 01:05:02.452]  I'll take that.
[01:05:02.452 --> 01:05:06.413]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:06.413 --> 01:05:15.274]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:15.274 --> 01:05:19.915]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:19.915 --> 01:05:30.717]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:31.357 --> 01:05:40.860]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:46.302]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:46.302 --> 01:05:53.785]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:53.785 --> 01:05:56.546]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:01.698 --> 01:06:05.722]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.722 --> 01:06:08.965]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:13.749]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:13.749 --> 01:06:20.155]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:20.155 --> 01:06:22.398]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:22.918 --> 01:06:23.218]  Tim Geithner?
[01:06:23.218 --> 01:06:23.478]  Bernanke?
[01:06:23.478 --> 01:06:24.099]  They're arsonists!
[01:06:24.099 --> 01:06:24.859]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:24.859 --> 01:06:26.540]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.826 --> 01:06:49.108]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:49.108 --> 01:06:58.211]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:07:00.151 --> 01:07:04.713]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.713 --> 01:07:05.614]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.614 --> 01:07:09.056]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:09.056 --> 01:07:09.896]  Number 2.
[01:07:09.896 --> 01:07:14.799]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.799 --> 01:07:15.539]  It's true.
[01:07:15.539 --> 01:07:20.422]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.422 --> 01:07:21.242]  Number 3.
[01:07:21.242 --> 01:07:24.824]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.824 --> 01:07:28.526]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.726 --> 01:07:29.526]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.526 --> 01:07:32.287]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.287 --> 01:07:35.968]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.968 --> 01:07:36.748]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.748 --> 01:07:40.889]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.889 --> 01:07:45.951]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.951 --> 01:07:50.132]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:51.913]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.913 --> 01:07:56.514]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:07:56.834 --> 01:08:21.518]  877-327-0365 You take a mortal man And put him in control Watch them become a god Watch him become a god
[01:08:40.993 --> 01:08:42.394]  Just like the Pied Piper.
[01:08:42.394 --> 01:08:46.496]  Just like the Pied Piper.
[01:08:46.496 --> 01:08:49.878]  Land rats through the streets.
[01:08:49.878 --> 01:08:52.459]  Dance like a marionette.
[01:08:52.459 --> 01:09:01.084]  Swaying to the symphony of destruction.
[01:09:01.084 --> 01:09:03.125]  Acting like a robot.
[01:09:03.125 --> 01:09:07.808]  It's metal brain corrodes.
[01:09:07.808 --> 01:09:09.989]  It's metal brain corrodes.
[01:09:17.874 --> 01:09:24.537]  Before the head explodes!
[01:09:24.537 --> 01:09:38.704]  We are seeing a globalist-launched worldwide destabilization campaign planned for close to five decades as the rats are being turned loose.
[01:09:38.704 --> 01:09:42.106]  So the population will beg the Pied Piper
[01:09:44.301 --> 01:10:02.414]  And the point I was making back during the last break about the Liberty Movement, all of you that have warned your friends and family and been laughed at, the people that laughed at Ron Paul three years ago, the people that pilloried this broadcast and attacked us from every level, when I talk about don't give me this power, it
[01:10:03.490 --> 01:10:11.954]  It is daunting to know that we are one of the leading salvos, one of the leading spears fighting the globalists that are aware of their program.
[01:10:11.954 --> 01:10:13.434]  We know the attack profile.
[01:10:13.434 --> 01:10:21.358]  We've been proven right so many times that all of us who know the score have incredible responsibilities.
[01:10:21.358 --> 01:10:21.798]  I do.
[01:10:21.798 --> 01:10:22.718]  You do.
[01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:24.119]  The Genesis Network.
[01:10:24.119 --> 01:10:25.239]  Everyone does.
[01:10:25.239 --> 01:10:27.340]  Other talk show hosts listening right now.
[01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:28.881]  This is so real.
[01:10:28.881 --> 01:10:31.842]  This is so big what's happening in the world right now.
[01:10:34.293 --> 01:10:46.909]  And they have begun the dominoes to fall for global destabilization to create a crisis so horrible that the public will beg for world government.
[01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:50.834]  And I do not like the fact that I'm so prominent.
[01:10:50.834 --> 01:10:52.857]  I can feel the danger increasing.
[01:10:54.244 --> 01:10:54.644]  But it's
[01:11:13.513 --> 01:11:23.350]  That God, lead God and direct us and that we repent for the things we've done, the decadence, the globalists have sold us corruption to make us weak, to make us rotten inside.
[01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:26.235]  None of us are perfect, but we need to get our hearts right with God.
[01:11:27.401 --> 01:11:44.187]  We need to all of us get our hearts right with God because the crises that we're already in, the crises that are expanding and getting worse by the day are going to be used to try to usher in planetary despotism, planetary enslavement.
[01:11:44.187 --> 01:11:51.469]  And I want people listening to realize the incredible historical crossroads that we all stand at the fulcrum of.
[01:11:54.895 --> 01:11:58.217]  What we do now will echo throughout human civilization.
[01:11:58.217 --> 01:12:00.699]  Don't be a spectator, be involved.
[01:12:00.699 --> 01:12:03.180]  People aren't gonna laugh at you now when you warn them.
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:10.865]  Many people who have been laughed at in the past, just average folks out there tell me their friends, their family are listening now and that is so positive.
[01:12:10.865 --> 01:12:17.189]  I am risking my life, my name, my treasure, everything because corruption must be faced.
[01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:20.471]  It must be dealt with or it will grow like a cancer out of control.
[01:12:22.688 --> 01:12:27.350]  Let's put that photo of Muammar Gaddafi up on screen if we can find it again for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:34.933]  If not, just search the term Muammar Gaddafi in military uniform in his ridiculous gold clown suit.
[01:12:34.933 --> 01:12:40.476]  And so, if you look at this in a one-dimensional view, it's like, oh great, a thug's being thrown out.
[01:12:41.633 --> 01:12:48.435]  But when you understand, oh, oh, good, Ozymandias Mubarak's been thrown out, but then you see the very same military people behind him step in, there will be no freedom.
[01:12:48.435 --> 01:13:03.519]  This is purely to drive up oil prices, to try to put people the media can call more extreme into power, and to try to have the buffer zone of the Middle East basically turn into a lake of carnage.
[01:13:06.331 --> 01:13:10.313]  Let me cover the news and I'm going to your phone calls.
[01:13:10.313 --> 01:13:12.654]  Hundreds protest in Iraq.
[01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:16.676]  TV station torched the side of the Toronto sun.
[01:13:16.676 --> 01:13:28.882]  Hundreds of protesters inspired by unrest around the Arab world took to the streets of the northern Iraqi city on Sunday and at least 48 people were injured.
[01:13:29.935 --> 01:13:42.406]  A police official said security forces fired in the air when demonstrators chanted against corruption, tried to approach the headquarters of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, where clashes on Thursday killed two people and wounded dozens.
[01:13:42.406 --> 01:13:43.727]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:13:43.727 --> 01:13:47.210]  TV stations have been torched.
[01:13:47.210 --> 01:13:48.891]  Dealing with the situation in Libya.
[01:13:52.381 --> 01:14:00.347]  It is being reported that military aircraft fire at Libyan crowds and Al Jazeera is reporting, Reuters is also reporting that.
[01:14:00.347 --> 01:14:03.150]  And, you know, these are armed people.
[01:14:03.150 --> 01:14:07.553]  They've gotten arms either by taking them from security forces or they've been pre-armed.
[01:14:07.553 --> 01:14:08.794]  They've taken tanks.
[01:14:08.794 --> 01:14:11.776]  They were trying to take over a military base when this happened.
[01:14:11.776 --> 01:14:14.258]  If you can believe any of this, that does make them a military target.
[01:14:16.656 --> 01:14:22.361]  And if you don't think our military's been trained to be trying to take over a military base to kill you, Dettard and Hammer, you got another thing coming.
[01:14:22.361 --> 01:14:31.630]  They're openly training the military, it's even in the Army Times going back two and a half years ago, and since then many times, that they are, quote, preparing our military to, quote, pull triggers on the American people.
[01:14:31.630 --> 01:14:40.158]  In fact, I read from an Army report that was put out last year, Army Strategic Shock Report, says troops may be needed to quell U.S.
[01:14:40.158 --> 01:14:40.939]  civil unrest.
[01:14:41.519 --> 01:14:50.206]  Purposeful domestic resistance would require military to rapidly determine the parameters defining the legitimate use of military force inside the United States.
[01:14:50.206 --> 01:14:53.930]  We reported that in December 16, 2008.
[01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:56.372]  See, they've all geared up for this!
[01:14:56.372 --> 01:14:56.552]  I mean...
[01:14:57.912 --> 01:15:01.974]  Folks, I was a mainline kind of libertarian-style Ron Paul guy.
[01:15:01.974 --> 01:15:05.595]  I didn't get into Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones and stuff like that.
[01:15:05.595 --> 01:15:08.556]  I was just a mainline libertarian.
[01:15:08.556 --> 01:15:16.280]  And I got on talk radio and TV 95, Radio 96, and people would send me documents, articles.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:21.542]  I'd see an article about the police chief being dealt a force trying to pay him off in the San Antonio Express News.
[01:15:21.542 --> 01:15:22.862]  I'd call the chief up.
[01:15:22.862 --> 01:15:25.444]  Hey, I've got a local radio show and a TV show in Austin.
[01:15:25.444 --> 01:15:26.104]  I'd come interview you.
[01:15:27.347 --> 01:15:28.888]  Alex Jones interviews Ale Philippis.
[01:15:28.888 --> 01:15:29.908]  It's in my film, Police Take 2000.
[01:15:29.908 --> 01:15:36.890]  Show up at his office, have an hour-long meeting, and he's just dealt the force trying to buy off the town on a secret takeover operation.
[01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:45.033]  Then I interviewed Thomas Sanchez, emergency manager, Vietnam veteran, former Army intelligence, so he knows what he was seeing.
[01:15:45.033 --> 01:15:47.674]  He was approached, he came on my radio show.
[01:15:47.674 --> 01:15:55.337]  He was approached in Kingsville, down in South Texas, basically for a martial law takeover drill.
[01:15:57.301 --> 01:15:59.062]  And I'd go on air and talk about it.
[01:15:59.062 --> 01:16:07.646]  I mean, they've been preparing for at least 15 years at a breakneck speed for the total collapse of the U.S.
[01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:11.968]  And in all the training, it's stock market crash, dollar devaluation.
[01:16:11.968 --> 01:16:16.330]  And then the very banks that run America on record have done all of this.
[01:16:16.330 --> 01:16:19.392]  I mean, again, that's what's so frustrating for me.
[01:16:19.392 --> 01:16:20.352]  This is 100%.
[01:16:20.352 --> 01:16:22.613]  This is 100%.
[01:16:22.613 --> 01:16:24.254]  This is not my opinion.
[01:16:24.254 --> 01:16:25.795]  We told you all this was coming.
[01:16:27.695 --> 01:16:27.915]  I don't
[01:16:44.161 --> 01:17:01.355]  It's just confirmation and it's, I use the analogy of being 11, 12 years old and getting off the school bus and three or four, it happened a bunch of times, you know, 14, 15, 16, 17 year olds get around you and beat you up and punch you in the nose.
[01:17:01.355 --> 01:17:10.442]  And, uh, you know, you try to fight back a little, but then it made me strong, you know, after it happened dozens of times.
[01:17:10.442 --> 01:17:10.522]  Um,
[01:17:11.971 --> 01:17:22.037]  To the point by the time I was about 13, well now when the 17 year old came up, I just learned to savagely attack him and start punching him in the nose and doing whatever I can and headbutting him and just turning it loose.
[01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:30.502]  You know, it's almost like you're scared when the bully's walking up, but once they go ahead and swing, once you felt them hit you, it's like, boom, it's on.
[01:17:30.502 --> 01:17:32.184]  I'm not scared anymore.
[01:17:32.184 --> 01:17:34.065]  I'm going to open a can of you know what on you.
[01:17:35.376 --> 01:17:39.418]  And that which does not kill us only makes us stronger, as Nietzsche said.
[01:17:39.418 --> 01:17:44.240]  I don't agree with a lot of what Nietzsche said, but I certainly agree with that, the German philosopher.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:57.586]  But I... Oh, it's so many emotions right now, because this is just another complete, total verification of everything we've said.
[01:17:57.586 --> 01:18:01.908]  And we know the globalists planned all this, and we know what it leads to next.
[01:18:07.765 --> 01:18:09.606]  It's amazing.
[01:18:09.606 --> 01:18:12.768]  I mean, they plan to shut the economy off here.
[01:18:12.768 --> 01:18:18.612]  They plan to have cascading demonstrations and riots in the next few years.
[01:18:18.612 --> 01:18:25.916]  But, again, just acclimating us to having TSA on every street corner, telescreens in Walmart, telling us to spy on each other.
[01:18:25.916 --> 01:18:27.997]  I mean, it's 1984.
[01:18:27.997 --> 01:18:31.059]  But, at least we've got radio networks.
[01:18:31.059 --> 01:18:33.521]  At least we've got the web for now, though they're all over the news.
[01:18:33.521 --> 01:18:35.122]  Internet kill switch gets makeover.
[01:18:36.405 --> 01:18:39.187]  CNET News.
[01:18:39.187 --> 01:18:42.409]  They're not setting up an internet kill switch, which by the way is already in place.
[01:18:42.409 --> 01:18:45.792]  They're just now announcing it and they want legal backing through Congress on it.
[01:18:45.792 --> 01:18:49.234]  They're not doing all this because they're going to play games.
[01:18:49.234 --> 01:18:54.618]  And there probably is coming a time, if we don't put out the full effort and resist them, because this is a fight.
[01:18:54.618 --> 01:19:03.545]  This is an ongoing brawl right now between unorganized free humanity who's got the truth, a powerful weapon, and the lying globalists who have all the resources.
[01:19:05.034 --> 01:19:07.756]  And so history's happening right now.
[01:19:07.756 --> 01:19:12.139]  And this is it.
[01:19:12.139 --> 01:19:16.962]  And I don't know what to say to you.
[01:19:16.962 --> 01:19:19.263]  I mean, it's all there.
[01:19:19.263 --> 01:19:21.104]  It's all on record.
[01:19:21.104 --> 01:19:23.065]  And it's all hiding in plain view.
[01:19:23.065 --> 01:19:27.548]  And what we do now is going to count forever.
[01:19:29.687 --> 01:19:39.613]  Globalists talk about societies being frozen, and then they will unfreeze things with revolution, either cultural or physical or a mix, to try to re-engineer quick change for them.
[01:19:39.613 --> 01:19:53.001]  But during this liquid phase, we can wrest control of the levers of power at every level and block these people, because the globalists are very strong in their rampant drive
[01:19:54.022 --> 01:19:56.727]  But they also are very weak during that period.
[01:19:56.727 --> 01:19:57.749]  It's a paradox.
[01:19:57.749 --> 01:19:58.991]  Your call straight ahead.
[01:19:58.991 --> 01:20:00.473]  Mark Bobber coming up.
[01:20:01.252 --> 01:20:03.253]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[01:20:03.253 --> 01:20:04.534]  No kidding!
[01:20:04.534 --> 01:20:08.917]  When you buy Tadler Reusable Canning Lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.
[01:20:08.917 --> 01:20:11.679]  Safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[01:20:11.679 --> 01:20:15.141]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways containing BPA.
[01:20:15.141 --> 01:20:20.165]  But Tadler Reusable Canning Lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning.
[01:20:20.165 --> 01:20:27.069]  Tadler Lids are made with a USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, safe for direct food contact, and contain no BPA.
[01:20:27.069 --> 01:20:30.952]  Tadler Lids are dishwasher safe, usable with standard pressure or water bath canning,
[01:20:31.092 --> 01:20:33.213]  Eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion.
[01:20:33.213 --> 01:20:34.553]  Fit standard mason jars.
[01:20:34.553 --> 01:20:37.935]  Are indefinitely reusable and are proudly made in the USA.

[01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:43.777]  That's ReusableCanningLids.com for Tadler Reusable Canning Lids.
[01:20:43.777 --> 01:20:44.798]  The original since 1976.
[01:21:01.954 --> 01:21:05.999]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:05.999 --> 01:21:09.242]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:09.242 --> 01:21:14.047]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:14.047 --> 01:21:20.434]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:20.434 --> 01:21:22.677]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:21:23.177 --> 01:21:23.497]  Tim Geithner?
[01:21:23.497 --> 01:21:23.758]  Bernanke?
[01:21:23.758 --> 01:21:24.318]  They're arsonists!
[01:21:24.318 --> 01:21:25.339]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:25.339 --> 01:21:27.461]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:42.096 --> 01:21:44.219]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:44.219 --> 01:21:49.385]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:49.385 --> 01:21:58.575]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:00.197 --> 01:22:03.160]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:07.305]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[01:22:07.305 --> 01:22:09.587]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:22:09.587 --> 01:22:14.752]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:22:14.752 --> 01:22:16.574]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:22:16.574 --> 01:22:18.116]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:22:18.116 --> 01:22:19.598]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:22:19.598 --> 01:22:22.661]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:22:22.941 --> 01:22:28.324]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:22:28.324 --> 01:22:37.670]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[01:22:37.670 --> 01:22:39.991]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:46.317]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[01:22:46.317 --> 01:22:50.101]  Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.101 --> 01:22:52.264]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free.
[01:22:52.264 --> 01:22:52.404]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.648 --> 01:23:03.729]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:08.231]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:23:08.231 --> 01:23:14.392]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:23:14.392 --> 01:23:16.813]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:23:16.813 --> 01:23:22.755]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.

[01:24:09.321 --> 01:24:13.882]  Okay, I keep saying I'm going to go to your calls, but breaking news, London Telegraph, we don't know if this is true.
[01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:16.863]  They do this to destroy confidence to make sure he falls.
[01:24:16.863 --> 01:24:18.604]  But it probably is, who knows.
[01:24:18.604 --> 01:24:23.305]  Libya, Colonel Qaddafi flees to Venezuela as cities fall to protesters.
[01:24:23.305 --> 01:24:27.267]  It's admitted the cities are falling.
[01:24:27.267 --> 01:24:33.789]  And White House and diplomatic sources say this is not from news media, this is from quote, credible inside sources.
[01:24:33.789 --> 01:24:36.169]  Let's go to some of your phone calls right now.
[01:24:36.169 --> 01:24:38.070]  Ray in Indiana, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:24:39.769 --> 01:24:43.552]  Thank you Alex, it's a pleasure and honor to speak to you.
[01:24:43.552 --> 01:24:53.998]  The question I had for you sir was regarding, I know you've been talking about that China is obviously buying a lot of gold and I was just curious as to
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:06.303]  What is your take on, they're going to hoard all this gold, does that mean that they could potentially dump it on the market and do something with other economies if they were to devalue gold?
[01:25:06.303 --> 01:25:12.345]  Well there's ratios, and I went over this actually last week, breaking down the numbers.
[01:25:12.345 --> 01:25:15.005]  Gold demand is now way above production.
[01:25:15.005 --> 01:25:16.846]  The Chinese are now one of the biggest holders
[01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:20.488]  But also, the government is the biggest producer now.
[01:25:20.488 --> 01:25:24.651]  They've bought mines and developed mines all over the world.
[01:25:24.651 --> 01:25:28.573]  And so, there's not enough gold for them.
[01:25:28.573 --> 01:25:31.835]  They could dump it and drive it down for a period.
[01:25:31.835 --> 01:25:36.659]  But the underpinning issue is not just dollar devaluation.
[01:25:36.659 --> 01:25:39.701]  Every other major currency, including the Chinese currency,
[01:25:41.039 --> 01:25:46.324]  I appreciate that sir and I hope you have a good day and keep up the good work.
[01:26:08.186 --> 01:26:09.947]  Guys, just write me a note so I don't forget.
[01:26:09.947 --> 01:26:13.109]  Survivors come up in a minute and I'll be able to remember that.
[01:26:13.109 --> 01:26:13.790]  It's a good question.
[01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:15.651]  Let's go ahead and talk to Patrick in Kansas.
[01:26:15.651 --> 01:26:18.093]  Patrick, you're on the air.
[01:26:18.093 --> 01:26:18.813]  Hey Alex.
[01:26:18.813 --> 01:26:20.674]  Hey buddy.
[01:26:20.674 --> 01:26:27.018]  I mean, I guess after hearing what you said about the oil today, this question kind of comes to be insignificant.
[01:26:27.018 --> 01:26:33.943]  But as far as the Middle East and how these riots are starting, it's mainly the students, right?
[01:26:33.943 --> 01:26:36.344]  So you've got unemployed students that are there.
[01:26:37.586 --> 01:26:38.846]  And, you know, that's who they assemble.
[01:26:38.846 --> 01:26:43.567]  Well, here in the United States, our students are going through the student loan debt crisis.
[01:26:43.567 --> 01:26:55.849]  And I was kind of saying, how is that going to play into the riots that will soon happen here in America, where you've got all the young entrepreneurs, all the educated people that have no whatsoever... Well, no, I mean, that's a no-brainer.
[01:26:55.849 --> 01:27:00.210]  That's what all of our economic experts and historians are saying.
[01:27:00.210 --> 01:27:06.411]  What you've already seen in multiple states in the last year, riots at campuses over increased tuition.
[01:27:07.071 --> 01:27:14.815]  I mean, education just gets more and more expensive, and then most people who get a degree end up working at the grocery store.
[01:27:14.815 --> 01:27:16.295]  And so, absolutely.
[01:27:16.295 --> 01:27:22.678]  I mean, look, globalism was about destroying economies and consolidating power in the globalist hands.
[01:27:22.678 --> 01:27:24.299]  I quote, post-industrial world.
[01:27:24.299 --> 01:27:32.543]  That's the stated goal of the charlatans like Al Gore and John P. Holdren and David Rockefeller and all these scumbags.
[01:27:33.223 --> 01:27:37.066]  And so it's about positioning you so you're not independent.
[01:27:37.066 --> 01:27:39.808]  And so yeah, no, it's just gonna get more insane from here on out.
[01:27:39.808 --> 01:27:43.951]  I mean, the fight's been going on, but now it's on.
[01:27:43.951 --> 01:27:47.293]  I mean, you know, we are deep into this right now.
[01:27:47.293 --> 01:27:51.116]  I mean, this is a death struggle versus liberty and tyranny.
[01:27:51.116 --> 01:27:59.382]  I mean, it is tectonic, it is colossal, it is unparalleled, the period we're entering.
[01:27:59.382 --> 01:28:01.324]  It's got war written all over it,
[01:28:03.701 --> 01:28:05.005]  It's just insane.
[01:28:05.005 --> 01:28:09.998]  I mean, just the entire geopolitical hologram is going into flames.
[01:28:11.454 --> 01:28:24.342]  Unless you get a homeland security job, now the biggest growth sector, prisons and homeland security, and so you'll have millions more people every year going on government payroll, kind of the TSA model of 15 bucks an hour, with petty power trips.
[01:28:40.192 --> 01:28:43.673]  Uh, sucking off whoever else has got money who isn't a globalist.
[01:28:43.673 --> 01:28:44.633]  Can you imagine?
[01:28:44.633 --> 01:28:48.654]  I mean, we know what happens in civilization during a period like this.
[01:28:48.654 --> 01:28:52.294]  We understand exactly how this is, how they're going to play it.
[01:28:52.294 --> 01:28:53.414]  We know their moves.
[01:28:53.414 --> 01:28:58.095]  It's like we're playing a chess champion whose moves are well known.
[01:28:58.095 --> 01:29:01.816]  And we're there, but the rest of the public doesn't even know we're playing chess.
[01:29:01.816 --> 01:29:07.157]  And I'm up here going, here's history, here's the template, here's their own admissions, here's their own battle plans.
[01:29:07.157 --> 01:29:08.317]  Something this big
[01:29:09.730 --> 01:29:10.772]  A lot of it is secret.
[01:29:25.879 --> 01:29:29.221]  So exactly when certain things are going to trip, we don't know.
[01:29:29.221 --> 01:29:30.762]  But we know the general move.
[01:29:30.762 --> 01:29:32.623]  It's like we're following a roadmap here.
[01:29:32.623 --> 01:29:33.563]  We've got their blueprint.
[01:29:33.563 --> 01:29:34.324]  We've got it out here.
[01:29:34.324 --> 01:29:36.745]  We know how they're going to build it and what they're going to do.
[01:29:36.745 --> 01:29:39.106]  I mean, do we know when a truck's going to pull up and put the plumbing in?
[01:29:39.106 --> 01:29:39.947]  No.
[01:29:39.947 --> 01:29:41.128]  But we can get a good idea.
[01:29:41.128 --> 01:29:43.149]  Well, now it's time to put the plumbing in.
[01:29:43.149 --> 01:29:44.609]  You know, now they put the drywall in.
[01:29:44.609 --> 01:29:46.631]  You know, now they're putting the carpet in.
[01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:47.711]  They're putting the fixtures in.
[01:29:47.711 --> 01:29:50.093]  I mean, we just we're just watching it fall like dominoes.
[01:29:51.069 --> 01:29:55.019]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.019 --> 01:29:57.685]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.871 --> 01:30:02.031]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:30:02.031 --> 01:30:08.954]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:08.954 --> 01:30:11.515]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:11.515 --> 01:30:16.877]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:16.877 --> 01:30:19.938]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:19.938 --> 01:30:21.999]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:30:22.239 --> 01:30:28.504]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:28.504 --> 01:30:31.867]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:31.867 --> 01:30:37.672]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:37.672 --> 01:30:39.293]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:39.293 --> 01:30:40.594]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:40.594 --> 01:30:43.276]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.276 --> 01:30:47.500]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:49.221]  You can find the video at www.
[01:30:50.602 --> 01:31:04.447]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:31:04.447 --> 01:31:05.567]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:31:05.567 --> 01:31:10.129]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:31:10.129 --> 01:31:16.071]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:31:16.071 --> 01:31:18.032]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:31:18.592 --> 01:31:22.173]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[01:31:22.173 --> 01:31:23.934]  This will freeze the cost of your food while
[01:31:47.824 --> 01:31:49.146]  Well, you can still afford it.
[01:31:49.146 --> 01:31:52.151]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:52.151 --> 01:31:53.153]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:32:04.358 --> 01:32:05.619]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:05.619 --> 01:32:09.543]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:09.543 --> 01:32:11.785]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.785 --> 01:32:17.650]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:17.650 --> 01:32:23.896]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.316 --> 01:32:30.261]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:30.261 --> 01:32:34.464]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.464 --> 01:32:38.768]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:38.768 --> 01:32:44.713]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:44.713 --> 01:32:48.276]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:48.276 --> 01:32:50.237]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.237 --> 01:32:50.678]  It's here.
[01:32:51.318 --> 01:33:03.923]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv I was a highway man Along the coach roads I did ride
[01:33:20.733 --> 01:33:30.881]  Well, there couldn't be a better time to have the editor and publisher of the Gloom, Boom, Doom report, gloomboomdoom.com, economist Mark Fauber.
[01:33:30.881 --> 01:33:41.249]  I can't go over his illustrious bio in the time we have, the next 25 minutes, but he of course graduated at 24 with a PhD in economics, magna cum laude.
[01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:48.335]  And he joins us from Thailand today, a real expert on world markets, especially what's happening in Asia.
[01:33:48.335 --> 01:33:57.443]  And I've got so much to discuss with him on oil, gold, what's going to happen with the Chinese, could they dump a bunch of gold on the market, where he sees everything going.
[01:33:57.443 --> 01:34:01.187]  We have to say his forecasting is among some of the most accurate in the world.
[01:34:01.187 --> 01:34:04.029]  Again, gloomboomdoom.com.
[01:34:04.029 --> 01:34:05.451]  Mr. Faber, good to have you here with us.
[01:34:07.679 --> 01:34:09.840]  Okay, well, you've got the floor from Thailand.
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:13.042]  What in the world is going on right now on this planet?
[01:34:13.042 --> 01:34:16.104]  What do you see happening?
[01:34:16.104 --> 01:34:22.547]  Well, basically, we have to go back to the 1970s to fully understand what happened.
[01:34:22.547 --> 01:34:26.790]  In the 1970s, they printed money in the U.S.
[01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:30.592]  and commodity prices went ballistic.
[01:34:30.592 --> 01:34:34.774]  And they overshot on the upside because of the money printing.
[01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:51.465]  And after 1980, they then declined because as they went up too much, supplies came into the market, so all commodities went down until 1998.
[01:34:51.465 --> 01:35:02.089]  During the decline in commodity prices, no new mining was undertaken, no exploration took place, no new
[01:35:03.024 --> 01:35:12.267]  Oil fields were looked for because as prices went down, there was no economic reason to look for new oil.
[01:35:12.267 --> 01:35:30.694]  But then, after 1998, commodity prices started to rise, and because of the combination of the opening of China, the incremental demand from China and also increasingly India and other emerging economies,
[01:35:31.638 --> 01:35:38.322]  Commodity prices started to go up, and because of the money printing in the U.S.
[01:35:38.322 --> 01:35:46.927]  by this rather despicable character, Mr. Bernanke, they went ballistic.
[01:35:46.927 --> 01:36:00.875]  And so we have very high inflation in most countries, and in many countries this high inflation in food prices, energy prices, has had an impact on
[01:36:01.474 --> 01:36:04.575]  The wallet of the typical household.
[01:36:04.575 --> 01:36:30.927]  Because whereas in the U.S., we say a per capita income of $40,000, food is not a huge component in people's income in emerging economies, where, say, the per capita income in Vietnam, India, is only $1,000 per year, food and energy makes maybe 50% of people's income.
[01:36:34.139 --> 01:36:38.821]  And of course, you're now, I guess, alluding to what we see happening in North Africa.
[01:36:38.821 --> 01:36:43.182]  Libya, now it looks like, is basically falling to the rebellion.
[01:36:43.182 --> 01:36:48.284]  Reportedly, Muammar Gaddafi has fled to Venezuela.
[01:36:48.284 --> 01:36:53.706]  What is driving these revolutions that we're seeing popping up around the world?
[01:36:53.706 --> 01:37:00.109]  And if it is overall dollar devaluation and commodity increases, how much worse is it going to get?
[01:37:00.109 --> 01:37:03.150]  I mean, how bad is the inflation going to get?
[01:37:04.847 --> 01:37:22.212]  Well, the really big question is whether this unrest we have in Tunisia, Libya, Bahrain, Egypt, will spread to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
[01:37:22.212 --> 01:37:30.335]  If they do, it will be very difficult for the US to take sides, because on the one hand,
[01:37:31.696 --> 01:37:32.356]  The U.S.
[01:37:32.356 --> 01:37:37.599]  has supported the vicious regime of Mr. Mubarak.
[01:37:37.599 --> 01:37:42.481]  They have supported the royal family of Saudi Arabia.
[01:37:42.481 --> 01:37:55.007]  They never asked Saudi Arabia to have reform and democracy, whereas they embargo countries like Myanmar.
[01:37:55.007 --> 01:37:57.308]  So where will they stand?
[01:37:57.308 --> 01:37:58.289]  What can they do?
[01:37:59.301 --> 01:38:03.582]  And the CIA is completely useless.
[01:38:03.582 --> 01:38:10.483]  They had no idea that the unrest would start.
[01:38:10.483 --> 01:38:15.404]  They had no ground information that something was going on.
[01:38:15.404 --> 01:38:24.385]  And so the U.S., and particularly this incapable president that the U.S.
[01:38:24.385 --> 01:38:27.466]  has, has no way to react properly.
[01:38:29.997 --> 01:38:31.958]  Well, I would say the following.
[01:38:31.958 --> 01:38:33.398]  I have a large subscriber base.
[01:38:59.742 --> 01:39:14.134]  I asked all my subscribers to please send me an email if they have the feeling that their cost of living were going up by less than 5% per annum.
[01:39:14.134 --> 01:39:17.157]  I didn't receive a single email.
[01:39:17.157 --> 01:39:27.926]  And so I think that the inflation or the cost of living increases in the US and elsewhere is much higher than what the government is publishing.
[01:39:29.005 --> 01:39:45.048]  And I think this is having a negative impact on consumption, because obviously, the cost of necessity, insurance, taxes, food, energy, is going up very rapidly.
[01:39:45.048 --> 01:39:57.471]  And my answer to all this is, the worse the economic conditions will become, the worse the geopolitical conditions will become, the more Mr. Bernanke
[01:39:58.274 --> 01:40:02.535]  And his fellow Fed Governors will print money.
[01:40:02.535 --> 01:40:05.416]  And so I'm not ultra bearish on equity.
[01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:11.977]  I think they will now correct, because the market is way overboard.
[01:40:11.977 --> 01:40:16.238]  And so we can easily have a correction of 10-15%.
[01:40:16.238 --> 01:40:20.939]  But I think as soon as the market drops, say, 15-20%, QE3 will come into play.
[01:40:25.316 --> 01:40:29.980]  And all that is favorable for silver and gold.
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:36.146]  Now the question is, is gold and silver expensive or is it cheap?
[01:40:36.146 --> 01:40:42.472]  Say, in 1999, you could buy an ounce of gold for $252.
[01:40:42.472 --> 01:40:43.072]  Now it's $1,400.
[01:40:43.072 --> 01:40:45.535]  Is it cheap or expensive?
[01:40:49.881 --> 01:40:56.606]  Well, in a money printing environment, it's very difficult to decide what is expensive and what is cheap.
[01:40:56.606 --> 01:41:07.554]  Because the function of money to be a unit of account and a store of value is being lost through the money printing.
[01:41:07.554 --> 01:41:16.541]  And so my view would be, yeah, relative to 99, the price of gold is expensive at $1,400.
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:22.362]  But relative to the money printing, maybe not.
[01:41:22.362 --> 01:41:30.486]  And so my advice to all your listeners is to gradually accumulate gold.
[01:41:30.486 --> 01:41:36.829]  Don't trade it, don't buy it on margin, just gradually accumulate it.
[01:41:36.829 --> 01:41:37.589]  Not to own any gold,
[01:41:48.627 --> 01:41:50.688]  Is to trust the U.S.
[01:41:50.688 --> 01:41:57.689]  government, to trust that they will ever balance the budget again.
[01:41:57.689 --> 01:42:12.654]  I don't think they will ever balance the budget again, and I think the budget deficit will range between $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion for the next five years.
[01:42:12.654 --> 01:42:14.154]  I don't think they'll come down.
[01:42:15.749 --> 01:42:18.691]  And basically, I think the U.S.
[01:42:18.691 --> 01:42:21.333]  government is bankrupt.
[01:42:21.333 --> 01:42:21.993]  Sure.
[01:42:21.993 --> 01:42:26.596]  But before they go, they will not default on the debt.
[01:42:26.596 --> 01:42:29.237]  They will just print money.
[01:42:29.237 --> 01:42:33.780]  And not to own gold and silver is to trust Mr. Bernanke.
[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:40.104]  Now go and look at his speeches, and then you tell me whether you rather trust
[01:42:40.859 --> 01:42:42.440]  Gold or Mr. Bernanke?
[01:42:58.228 --> 01:43:06.596]  Dr. Faubourg, looking at this, you've been completely right in your long-term breakdowns of what's happened.
[01:43:06.596 --> 01:43:21.070]  The mainstream media moguls in financial news continue to put out disinformation because they have a vested interest in not giving their listeners and viewers the real truth so they can position themselves while continuing to milk and sucker the public.
[01:43:21.610 --> 01:43:39.173]  But do we just see a gradual dollar devaluation causing ongoing commodity increases, or is there a danger of some type of hyper event, or a group of stairs that we basically bounce down to the bottom?
[01:43:39.173 --> 01:43:47.114]  And knowing the policies of the Western world versus what you would do to fix it, I want to ask you that in a moment, what's the end game?
[01:43:47.114 --> 01:43:47.994]  I mean, what's the time frame?
[01:43:47.994 --> 01:43:49.915]  Two, three, four, five, ten years?
[01:43:49.915 --> 01:43:50.855]  What do we look like?
[01:43:51.235 --> 01:43:59.501]  Yes, but Japan didn't have high inflation, and because prices came down, actually, real income went up.
[01:43:59.501 --> 01:44:03.403]  So Japan is not all that badly off.
[01:44:20.342 --> 01:44:26.844]  Well, however, what happened is that government debt went ballistic.
[01:44:26.844 --> 01:44:44.531]  And I think that now Japan will have more inflation through food prices and energy prices, and that this will be bad for the yen and also for Japanese government bonds.
[01:44:44.531 --> 01:44:50.053]  And that will then drive money out of cash bonds into equity.
[01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:55.152]  I'm actually quite positive about the Japanese stock market.
[01:44:55.152 --> 01:45:00.334]  But in the case of the US, I think they will inflate.
[01:45:00.334 --> 01:45:03.095]  And they will print money.
[01:45:03.095 --> 01:45:11.239]  And the question whether we will have hyperinflation... I think we will have high inflation rates.
[01:45:11.239 --> 01:45:14.660]  Much higher than is generally perceived.
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:16.841]  But maybe not tomorrow.
[01:45:16.841 --> 01:45:19.403]  Maybe only in 3 or 4 years or 5 years or so.
[01:45:20.973 --> 01:45:23.796]  But I think it will happen.
[01:45:23.796 --> 01:45:31.263]  Well, concerning the dollar, the question is, against what will it go down?
[01:45:31.263 --> 01:45:34.726]  The other paper currencies are not much better.
[01:45:34.726 --> 01:45:38.290]  The euro is not much better than the US dollar.
[01:45:38.290 --> 01:45:41.913]  It's maybe slightly better, but not much better.
[01:45:41.913 --> 01:45:44.536]  And so the only true currencies
[01:45:50.484 --> 01:45:53.424]  Doctor, let me throw this in at you then.
[01:45:53.424 --> 01:45:59.486]  Obviously, the Chinese realize that, and that's why they are now the biggest gold producer, are they not?
[01:45:59.486 --> 01:46:11.850]  I mean, clearly, they see where this is going, and if you have all these currencies, including the SDRs and the QE2 and the coming QE3, if they're all just basically another layered fiat derivative
[01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:26.112]  Yes, provided it's not taken away from you.
[01:46:26.112 --> 01:46:29.313]  And I'd like to add that the U.S.
[01:46:29.313 --> 01:46:31.773]  has been printing money.
[01:46:31.773 --> 01:46:34.834]  But the others have done exactly the same.
[01:46:34.834 --> 01:46:37.014]  It's global.
[01:46:37.014 --> 01:46:41.475]  And so I think all the currencies will lose value against gold and silver.
[01:46:42.506 --> 01:46:44.166]  But there are other avenues.
[01:46:44.166 --> 01:46:51.129]  Say, throughout history, gold has frequently been taken away, expropriated.
[01:46:51.129 --> 01:46:52.229]  Even in the U.S.
[01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.989]  in 1933.
[01:46:52.989 --> 01:46:57.330]  They didn't expropriate it.
[01:46:57.330 --> 01:46:59.831]  They paid $25 an ounce.
[01:46:59.831 --> 01:47:03.972]  But then, after collecting all the gold from U.S.
[01:47:03.972 --> 01:47:09.894]  citizens, including going to the safe deposit boxes with sheriffs to take it out,
[01:47:10.635 --> 01:47:14.198]  They revalued it to $35.
[01:47:14.198 --> 01:47:16.260]  So I think today the U.S.
[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:18.622]  government may take it away one day.
[01:47:18.622 --> 01:47:24.267]  They'll pay the price and after they'll revalue it five times or whatever it is.
[01:47:24.267 --> 01:47:29.411]  But I think another avenue is to own farmland.
[01:47:29.411 --> 01:47:32.394]  And I think that real estate prices in the U.S.
[01:47:32.394 --> 01:47:33.815]  have come down.
[01:47:33.815 --> 01:47:35.716]  OK, they may go down another 10 percent.
[01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:49.128]  But relatively, to other countries and internationally, and after having declined, if you can find a house you like, I think it's not a bad time to buy a house in the U.S.
[01:47:49.128 --> 01:47:54.051]  It may not go up in value, but it may preserve its value.
[01:47:54.051 --> 01:48:01.436]  Also, art and stamps are another avenue to protect your wealth.
[01:48:01.436 --> 01:48:02.617]  Now, did you say art, sir?
[01:48:04.104 --> 01:48:04.364]  Yes.
[01:48:04.364 --> 01:48:06.506]  Well, I know quite a few extremely well-to-do people
[01:48:34.147 --> 01:48:42.996]  Who have second thoughts about life in big cities and the security in big cities.
[01:48:42.996 --> 01:48:50.663]  If they, the unrest in the Middle East would also spread to develop conflict.
[01:48:50.663 --> 01:48:57.289]  And also, they also know that we might have problems with
[01:49:00.322 --> 01:49:01.763]  Well, that's what I was about to say.
[01:49:23.553 --> 01:49:23.914]  I don't think so.
[01:49:36.043 --> 01:49:41.945]  But I mean, you know, just running into well-known people off record told me four years ago that the U.S.
[01:49:41.945 --> 01:49:47.527]  and the entire world economy was going to collapse via the derivatives and that they were basically fleeing.
[01:49:47.527 --> 01:49:49.147]  I mean, I even know about John Wayne.
[01:49:49.147 --> 01:49:51.968]  Part of his family just ran off to Central America.
[01:49:51.968 --> 01:49:55.969]  I mean, so many people are evacuating.
[01:49:55.969 --> 01:50:00.371]  Some of the richest people in Israel, it's been in the news, are evacuating Israel.
[01:50:00.371 --> 01:50:03.952]  I mean, what do the elite know that the general public hasn't been let in on, Doctor?
[01:50:06.533 --> 01:50:09.214]  Well, there's another element.
[01:50:09.214 --> 01:50:25.841]  Because of the advent of computers, the fax machines, and in the last 20 years, the internet, if I'm a hedge fund manager, if I'm a well-to-do person, I can run my business from anywhere.
[01:50:25.841 --> 01:50:34.144]  I sit here in the north of Thailand, I have Bloomberg, I have computer access, I have everything.
[01:50:34.144 --> 01:50:34.364]  So,
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:37.044]  I don't need to be in a big city.
[01:50:37.044 --> 01:50:45.722]  I can choose the lifestyle to be in a small city and have a larger space or to be in the countryside.
[01:50:49.113 --> 01:50:50.213]  Well, first of all, if you look at
[01:51:18.911 --> 01:51:32.138]  The international reserve at the hands of central banks and the wealth accumulation over the last 20 years among well-to-do people.
[01:51:32.138 --> 01:51:40.942]  The international reserves have grown from $1 trillion to now $9.5 trillion.
[01:51:40.942 --> 01:51:44.824]  The Chinese, they have $2.5 trillion.
[01:51:44.824 --> 01:51:45.864]  The Asians have 70%
[01:51:47.947 --> 01:51:50.488]  Of the nine and a half trillion.
[01:51:50.488 --> 01:51:58.692]  The Asians, they have 2% of these reserves invested in gold.
[01:51:58.692 --> 01:52:00.232]  Very little.
[01:52:00.232 --> 01:52:09.256]  The Indian, the Reserve Bank of India bought, a year ago, 200 tons at roughly $1,040.
[01:52:09.256 --> 01:52:10.037]  Now it's $1,400.
[01:52:10.037 --> 01:52:10.437]  The Chinese,
[01:52:18.303 --> 01:52:25.506]  It's kind of a loss of faith for them to go into the open market and buy and announce that they're buying gold.
[01:52:25.506 --> 01:52:38.470]  But what they produce, they keep and they have given incentives and created programs in China whereby individuals can now buy gold.
[01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:39.611]  So they're bullish on gold?
[01:52:41.866 --> 01:52:44.247]  Yeah, I mean for sure they're not bullish on the U.S.
[01:52:44.247 --> 01:52:48.349]  dollar and they're not bullish on Mr. Obama and they were never bullish on Mr. Bush.
[01:52:48.349 --> 01:52:48.989]  Well, I think that
[01:53:12.634 --> 01:53:24.558]  Investors gradually realize that, say, if you're an investor for the next 10 years, what you don't want to own is, say, a 30-year U.S.
[01:53:24.558 --> 01:53:26.039]  government bond.
[01:53:26.039 --> 01:53:28.600]  You don't want to own a 10-year U.S.
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:33.482]  government bond at a yield of 3.6%.
[01:53:33.482 --> 01:53:36.743]  So what else is there?
[01:53:36.743 --> 01:53:40.785]  You can buy stock, you can buy precious metal, you can buy commodities.
[01:53:42.486 --> 01:53:55.809]  The commodities, the industrial ones and the agricultural ones and the softs, are very volatile and usually the supply response is relatively short.
[01:53:55.809 --> 01:54:00.950]  In other words, there's a shortage of wheat and soybeans, corn.
[01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:04.751]  Within one year, you can plant more.
[01:54:04.751 --> 01:54:07.732]  But in the case of precious metals, you can't do that.
[01:54:08.792 --> 01:54:09.993]  The same for oil.
[01:54:09.993 --> 01:54:13.554]  The supply response is very slow.
[01:54:13.554 --> 01:54:21.258]  And so, the Chinese, if they could, they would buy all the American oil companies.
[01:54:21.258 --> 01:54:28.301]  Chevron, ExxonMobil, Marathon Oil, whatever it is, and BHP and Rio Tinto.
[01:54:28.301 --> 01:54:35.685]  But politically, these countries, I mean the US, Australia, Canada, will not allow the Chinese to do that.
[01:54:36.621 --> 01:54:38.342]  So what else do they want to do?
[01:54:38.342 --> 01:54:49.625]  They go and buy concessions in Venezuela, in Latin America, in general, and in Africa, Central Asia, and so forth and so on, and develop their own resource.
[01:54:49.625 --> 01:54:50.345]  That is correct.
[01:55:06.321 --> 01:55:07.461]  The U.S.
[01:55:07.461 --> 01:55:11.462]  could produce much more, but the problem in the U.S.
[01:55:11.462 --> 01:55:33.068]  is that exploration, like, generally speaking, capital spending, which means education, R&D, infrastructure, plants and equipment, was neglected because the government's economic policies
[01:55:40.721 --> 01:55:41.221]  Yes sir.
[01:55:41.221 --> 01:55:42.362]  We're almost out of time.
[01:55:42.362 --> 01:55:44.924]  The last three minutes we have with you.
[01:55:44.924 --> 01:55:46.486]  Are we in a global depression?
[01:55:46.486 --> 01:55:47.507]  Are we entering one?
[01:55:47.507 --> 01:55:50.569]  Or are we going to enter one?
[01:55:50.569 --> 01:55:59.136]  And just overall summing up the state of the world economy and... You mentioned earlier on the word end game.
[01:56:01.912 --> 01:56:08.436]  We are in the endgame, but we are currently in a crack-up boom.
[01:56:08.436 --> 01:56:15.800]  A crack-up boom is when you postpone a recession through money printing and credit growth.
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:23.445]  The credit growth is not strong in the private sector, but it's much worse if it's in the government sector.
[01:56:23.445 --> 01:56:28.008]  And the government is the most unproductive factor in economic life.
[01:56:29.307 --> 01:56:33.650]  And so this crack-up boom will end very badly.
[01:56:33.650 --> 01:56:44.338]  But before it ends badly, we'll have money printing, very high inflation, and when everything fails, the U.S.
[01:56:44.338 --> 01:56:45.859]  will go to war.
[01:56:45.859 --> 01:56:50.663]  They are already at war, but they'll increase it.
[01:56:50.663 --> 01:56:51.363]  Absolutely.
[01:56:51.363 --> 01:56:55.306]  And you're saying two to four years is the main vector zone?
[01:56:58.905 --> 01:57:12.272]  Well in my view, by printing money you can postpone the evil, the end of the endgame for say 7 to 10 years.
[01:57:12.272 --> 01:57:14.733]  In Latin America they did it between 1980 and 1989.
[01:57:17.645 --> 01:57:24.586]  But now the hangover is so much bigger, and it looks like everything is starting to accelerate so much faster.
[01:57:24.586 --> 01:57:26.487]  And you say we have dumb presidents.
[01:57:26.487 --> 01:57:29.527]  Well, it's just they're just looting the country.
[01:57:29.527 --> 01:57:32.248]  They are deluding the country.
[01:57:32.248 --> 01:57:34.428]  They're lying.
[01:57:34.428 --> 01:57:37.749]  And the fact is simply this.
[01:57:37.749 --> 01:57:45.130]  For the typical household, and I'm not speaking here of the Goldman Sachs partners and Wall Street.
[01:57:46.357 --> 01:57:57.442]  Yes.
[01:57:57.442 --> 01:58:04.885]  And that's why they put a police state grid in preemptively.
[01:58:04.885 --> 01:58:06.705]  It's extremely premeditated.
[01:58:06.705 --> 01:58:10.107]  Well, Mr. Fomber, the website's gloomboomdoom.com.
[01:58:10.107 --> 01:58:11.287]  We haven't had you on in about a year.
[01:58:11.287 --> 01:58:12.588]  I know you're very busy.
[01:58:12.588 --> 01:58:14.709]  I want to thank you for joining us.
[01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:15.369]  It's my pleasure.
[01:58:16.232 --> 01:58:19.995]  Thank you so much, sir, and I look forward to speaking to you in the near future again.
[01:58:19.995 --> 01:58:20.976]  Gloom, boom, doom.
[01:58:20.976 --> 01:58:23.338]  So do I. Thank you so much.
[01:58:23.338 --> 01:58:25.840]  We'll talk to you again soon, sir.
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:27.921]  Amazing information.
[01:58:27.921 --> 01:58:29.002]  Oh, boy, I tell you.
[01:58:29.002 --> 01:58:30.883]  And that guy is super high-powered.
[01:58:30.883 --> 01:58:33.586]  His predictions are spot-on.
[01:58:33.586 --> 01:58:35.527]  And we're not being negative here.
[01:58:35.527 --> 01:58:38.770]  It's best to know the truth and make preparations for it, isn't it?
[01:58:38.770 --> 01:58:43.673]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.902 --> 01:58:54.743]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:58:54.743 --> 01:58:59.024]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:58:59.024 --> 01:59:03.825]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:59:03.825 --> 01:59:09.667]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:59:09.667 --> 01:59:12.928]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:59:12.928 --> 01:59:16.669]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:59:19.461 --> 01:59:24.983]  I'm looking for America.
[01:59:24.983 --> 01:59:26.603]  We're American and be proud.
[01:59:26.603 --> 01:59:28.724]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:59:28.724 --> 01:59:33.826]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[01:59:33.826 --> 01:59:37.807]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:59:45.399 --> 01:59:53.884]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:59:53.884 --> 01:59:56.266]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.266 --> 01:59:59.068]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.663 --> 02:00:10.510]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:12.092]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.092 --> 02:00:13.634]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.634 --> 02:00:17.820]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:21.885]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.216 --> 02:00:26.879]  Okay, I know the phone's up an hour ago and it only took a few of them.
[02:00:26.879 --> 02:00:37.728]  I'm going to take calls throughout the rest of this hour and smatter the transmission with key news, intel information, latest developments out of Libya, a reported Qaddafi's flood to Venezuela, aircraft strafing people in major cities.
[02:00:40.973 --> 02:00:49.885]  Libya, we've got riots going on in different places in Iraq, TV stations being burned, gold continuing to surge, silver continuing to surge.
[02:00:49.885 --> 02:00:52.549]  This is a moving fluid situation.
[02:00:52.549 --> 02:00:55.272]  Just a few minutes to bring Ted Anderson, the owner of the Genesis Network.
[02:00:55.913 --> 02:00:59.357]  And he financed the founding of it 13, 14 years ago, now 15.
[02:00:59.357 --> 02:01:03.001]  Man, time flies with Midas Resources.
[02:01:03.001 --> 02:01:07.246]  Ted, what's gold and silver last time you looked at it a few minutes ago?
[02:01:07.246 --> 02:01:10.971]  I mean, we just heard what Mark Faber said, just echoing everything we've talked about.
[02:01:11.687 --> 02:01:13.008]  Well, he's exactly right.
[02:01:13.008 --> 02:01:24.439]  I mean, silver hit $34.05 today, gold over $1,400, actually all the way up to $1,409.60, well over $17.50 increase just today alone.
[02:01:24.439 --> 02:01:26.921]  Silver's up over 4% today.
[02:01:26.921 --> 02:01:29.423]  I mean, that's just unheard of, Alex.
[02:01:29.423 --> 02:01:31.365]  It's like on a rocket ship to the moon, man.
[02:01:31.365 --> 02:01:33.087]  This stuff is going crazy.
[02:01:33.087 --> 02:01:36.210]  And it just pleases me to all end
[02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:48.702]  Last Friday, people just rang our phones off the hook because three silver dollars and three a year videos for $97 has become such a fabulous buy that they're just taking advantage of it.
[02:01:48.702 --> 02:01:51.605]  I hope to God they pass those videos out.
[02:01:52.145 --> 02:02:00.027]  Now with silver over $34 an ounce and you're still picking up three silver dollars and having three of Alex's videos for $97.
[02:02:00.027 --> 02:02:02.928]  I mean, some of the people are smart.
[02:02:02.928 --> 02:02:08.509]  They're taking advantage of some of these other things that we have and getting a position in gold and silver.
[02:02:08.509 --> 02:02:13.751]  But if nothing else, I mean, my goodness, get your credit card out and buy this video set.
[02:02:15.151 --> 02:02:15.811]  Two things.
[02:02:15.811 --> 02:02:25.134]  I mean, this country's going down the chute real fast, and one of the ways that you can arm yourself with information is getting these videos.
[02:02:25.134 --> 02:02:26.635]  Well, Ted, there's not a better deal out there.
[02:02:26.635 --> 02:02:30.156]  Three silver dollars for $97 with a $60 value.
[02:02:30.156 --> 02:02:35.158]  Three of my most powerful films, Endgame, Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, and Free Shipping.
[02:02:35.158 --> 02:02:38.079]  That's a $70-plus value on top of it.
[02:02:38.079 --> 02:02:40.760]  Now with silver going up, you know, $35 or whatever.
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:41.460]  What did silver go to?
[02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:43.120]  Silver was at $34.05 today at its peak.
[02:03:01.747 --> 02:03:02.047]  Fobber
[02:03:18.524 --> 02:03:22.047]  I mean, what are you, you know, just keep the dollars and let them rape you there?
[02:03:22.047 --> 02:03:24.669]  At least they've got to physically try to get it from you.
[02:03:24.669 --> 02:03:27.011]  Also, silver has never been confiscated.
[02:03:27.011 --> 02:03:29.473]  That's why I've been heavy in silver as well.
[02:03:29.473 --> 02:03:30.174]  But I'm sorry.
[02:03:30.174 --> 02:03:35.238]  You know, the silver and gold I've bought over the years, it's not a lot of it, but it's an emergency backup.
[02:03:35.238 --> 02:03:36.800]  I'm not giving it up to these crooks.
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:40.763]  And that's the type of thing, if they try this again, we're just not going to go along with it.
[02:03:40.763 --> 02:03:44.927]  So that's my answer to people that say, oh, you know, I'll just let them devalue my dollar.
[02:03:44.927 --> 02:03:45.968]  I mean, you got to do something.
[02:03:46.548 --> 02:04:11.305]  Alex and I can tell you people should just stay away from the kind of gold that you have to give up your social security number for whether if it's buying or selling it doesn't matter just say hey do I ever have to get a 1090 foot 9 or do I have to give up my social security number on this type of gold and if that is the truth and get away from that kind of gold there's plenty of options in the bullion and also the very low low low low premium type gold coins and you know you don't have to.
[02:04:11.305 --> 02:04:16.368]  That's right they're just semi numismatic but still their collector so they don't go into the confiscation rule correct?
[02:04:16.628 --> 02:04:26.154]  Yeah, and just stay away from anything that's real high premium at this point, because I can tell you right now, it makes no sense to set up a coin collection, not with the economy that we have right now.
[02:04:26.154 --> 02:04:29.676]  Stay with stuff that is private, portable, and away from government stuff.
[02:04:29.676 --> 02:04:33.799]  Yeah, I mean, we hear about other people with, you know, 30-40% markups because they're selling
[02:04:34.179 --> 02:04:34.379]  Thank you.
[02:05:00.819 --> 02:05:05.381]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.381 --> 02:05:06.301]  Number 1.
[02:05:06.301 --> 02:05:09.722]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.722 --> 02:05:10.582]  Number 2.
[02:05:10.582 --> 02:05:15.464]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.464 --> 02:05:16.204]  It's true.
[02:05:16.204 --> 02:05:21.086]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.086 --> 02:05:21.906]  Number 3.
[02:05:21.906 --> 02:05:25.488]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.488 --> 02:05:29.189]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.409 --> 02:05:30.189]  Number 4.
[02:05:30.189 --> 02:05:32.950]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:36.632]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.632 --> 02:05:37.432]  Number 5.
[02:05:37.432 --> 02:05:41.574]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.574 --> 02:05:46.616]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:07:01.630 --> 02:07:05.654]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:05.654 --> 02:07:08.897]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:08.897 --> 02:07:13.681]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:07:13.681 --> 02:07:20.087]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:20.087 --> 02:07:22.330]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:07:22.850 --> 02:07:23.170]  Tim Geithner?
[02:07:23.170 --> 02:07:23.671]  Bernanke?
[02:07:23.671 --> 02:07:24.351]  They're arsonists!
[02:07:24.351 --> 02:07:25.632]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:25.632 --> 02:07:27.873]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:41.761 --> 02:07:43.882]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:07:43.882 --> 02:07:49.044]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:07:49.044 --> 02:07:58.147]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:08:12.270 --> 02:08:13.811]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.811 --> 02:08:18.012]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.012 --> 02:08:22.074]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.528 --> 02:08:26.392]  You have founded the front lines of the info war.
[02:08:26.392 --> 02:08:29.417]  I'm Alex Jones here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:08:29.417 --> 02:08:30.578]  to 2 p.m.
[02:08:30.578 --> 02:08:38.990]  We have the bombshell huge biggest revelations ever from Lindsey Williams on the geopolitical stratagem from his inside source joining us
[02:08:39.531 --> 02:08:45.254]  Tomorrow in T-minus 23 hours, 50 minutes from now, he will be joining us.
[02:08:45.254 --> 02:08:46.274]  He was on in the first hour.
[02:08:46.274 --> 02:08:51.256]  If anybody wants to get the podcast later today with a prelude, he pretty much told you a lot of it then.
[02:08:51.256 --> 02:08:52.197]  He's pretty shooken up.
[02:08:52.197 --> 02:08:53.757]  This stuff's real, folks.
[02:08:53.757 --> 02:08:57.739]  And his latest, not predictions, inside info's all coming true.
[02:08:57.739 --> 02:08:58.920]  So that's coming up.
[02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:01.981]  Look, I wanna go to Nathan, Tim, Joe, Ron, Scott, and others.
[02:09:01.981 --> 02:09:03.422]  The toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[02:09:09.485 --> 02:09:20.072]  9231 and I do have a lot of news I want to get to I'm gonna recap that towards the end of the show though because I've been ranting and interviewing guests I want to hear from you but
[02:09:21.514 --> 02:09:27.578]  I'm always trying to take calls and then have them done quickly and for me not to babble for an hour when you ask a question.
[02:09:27.578 --> 02:09:29.619]  It's not really babble, but you know what I mean.
[02:09:29.619 --> 02:09:31.480]  So I'm going to try to keep these down a minute and a half.
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:34.302]  I'm sure we'll fail, but we're trying.
[02:09:34.302 --> 02:09:37.684]  Venezuela denies Libyan leader Qaddafi en route.
[02:09:37.684 --> 02:09:45.108]  Yeah, because they probably don't want F-16s to blow it out of the sky in an accidental air crash or maybe hit him with an energy beam and he'll have a stroke on board.
[02:09:45.108 --> 02:09:46.609]  Oh, they've got those in the C-130s and the DC-10s.
[02:09:49.571 --> 02:09:55.976]  Venezuela denies Libya's Gaddafi en route, but the British Foreign Secretary William Hague
[02:09:56.989 --> 02:10:03.314]  I said earlier today that their word from inside Libya is he has taken off for Venezuela.
[02:10:03.314 --> 02:10:04.315]  But who knows?
[02:10:04.315 --> 02:10:10.440]  The London Telegraph a few hours ago reported Libyan Colonel Qaddafi flees to Venezuela as cities fall to protesters.
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:13.662]  Their parliament has been burning all day.
[02:10:13.662 --> 02:10:15.164]  TV stations getting torched.
[02:10:15.164 --> 02:10:18.386]  Riots in Iraq, in the north and the central areas.
[02:10:18.386 --> 02:10:19.407]  Gold surging.
[02:10:19.407 --> 02:10:20.648]  Their commodities exploding.
[02:10:20.648 --> 02:10:21.429]  Oil exploding.
[02:10:22.149 --> 02:10:22.690]  I don't think so.
[02:10:37.452 --> 02:10:38.213]  Okay?
[02:10:38.213 --> 02:10:42.416]  It doesn't mean that we are for Qaddafi or that we're for Hazi Mubarak.
[02:10:42.416 --> 02:10:43.597]  We don't like them.
[02:10:43.597 --> 02:10:46.199]  The point is the globalists want chaos.
[02:10:46.199 --> 02:10:49.682]  And this is what Williams told you four months ago in October.
[02:10:49.682 --> 02:10:50.683]  Now it's happening.
[02:10:50.683 --> 02:10:52.404]  This is what all the evidence shows.
[02:10:52.404 --> 02:10:55.827]  George Soros is all over this and he's a bad guy, folks.
[02:10:55.827 --> 02:11:00.170]  So think ahead a couple more moves and then think ahead a few more.
[02:11:00.170 --> 02:11:06.696]  Or just read the books written by Kissinger and the Council on Foreign Relations reports and where they brag about all of it.
[02:11:07.447 --> 02:11:12.111]  And sure, they may lose control of these, but they still get the chaos they want.
[02:11:12.111 --> 02:11:17.055]  But they're shaking up the bag to move us into this next crisis phase.
[02:11:17.055 --> 02:11:18.696]  Okay, let's go to Nathan in Oklahoma.
[02:11:18.696 --> 02:11:19.537]  Nathan, you're on the air.
[02:11:19.537 --> 02:11:22.199]  All right, hey Alex, can you hear me all right?
[02:11:22.199 --> 02:11:23.500]  Worldwide transmission, over.
[02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:25.621]  All right.
[02:11:25.621 --> 02:11:30.545]  Almighty, Almighty, this is PBR Street Gang, over.
[02:11:30.545 --> 02:11:31.166]  You're on the air.
[02:11:31.166 --> 02:11:33.187]  Can you hear me?
[02:11:33.187 --> 02:11:33.648]  Yes, I can.
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:40.582]  Alright, well thanks for taking my call, and one of the things I think that your callers can't say enough, you know, is that thank you for doing what you do.
[02:11:40.582 --> 02:11:46.583]  You know, I thought I was born into one of the most boring periods of human history, but come to find out, it's one of the most pristine moments of your life.
[02:11:46.583 --> 02:12:01.167]  Now the whole system, while they want us obsessed with Justin Bieber, or whatever his name is, and Lady Boo-Boo, and all this other idiocy, that's all so people are... I hear adults talking about Justin Bieber and see kids copying his moronic haircut.
[02:12:01.667 --> 02:12:03.456]  I mean, that doesn't matter.
[02:12:03.456 --> 02:12:05.668]  This is one of the most important times ever.
[02:12:06.670 --> 02:12:09.232]  They got giant cyclotrons they're firing up.
[02:12:09.232 --> 02:12:11.674]  The Pentagon admits they're developing antimatter weapons.
[02:12:11.674 --> 02:12:15.537]  They're doing cross-species genetic planting and release of insects.
[02:12:15.537 --> 02:12:18.660]  They're releasing mosquitoes that forcibly vaccinate you.
[02:12:18.660 --> 02:12:21.943]  They're rolling out brain-altering vaccines.
[02:12:21.943 --> 02:12:22.883]  Total insanity.
[02:12:22.883 --> 02:12:34.233]  2011, government surveillance blimps, artificial surveillance dragonflies and hummingbirds and training the military to mow citizens down and giant federalization.
[02:12:34.873 --> 02:12:36.754]  You're good, and you're right.
[02:12:36.754 --> 02:12:43.316]  We're in the largest awakening of the planet Earth has ever seen so far, which is a good thing, but I'll get to what I've got to say.
[02:13:02.270 --> 02:13:08.154]  You covered that the globalists want to put chips in our brains, you know, on your last broadcast.
[02:13:08.154 --> 02:13:16.940]  Well, I have some, the most powerful information that I think would be good, and it's uprising and awakening of ours, that we've yet to put to use.
[02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:18.861]  Tell us, tell us the info.
[02:13:18.861 --> 02:13:24.825]  Alright, it's our brain, and the first, I have two studies to tell you about.
[02:13:24.825 --> 02:13:25.746]  The first one is
[02:13:28.766 --> 02:13:32.769]  There's a book called Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain by Sharon Begley.
[02:13:32.769 --> 02:13:50.580]  Now, in 2001, Richard Davidson, who is a scientist that studies neuroplasticity, tested his lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he asked the Dalai Lama and another monk to come and be hooked up to an electron cephalogram, also known as an EEG machine, which measures and records the electrical activity of your brain.
[02:13:50.580 --> 02:13:53.902]  Now, at first, he had the moment not to think of anything, and then he had him think of compassion.
[02:13:54.292 --> 02:13:57.773]  When you did this, the scales went off the charts with the amount of brain activity that was going on.
[02:13:57.773 --> 02:13:58.394]  Sure, no, no.
[02:13:58.394 --> 02:14:00.994]  I mean, that's not the only study.
[02:14:00.994 --> 02:14:07.117]  When the brain is in a loving, empathizing position, it's the highest level brainwaves you can have.
[02:14:07.117 --> 02:14:09.177]  And that's absolutely right.
[02:14:09.177 --> 02:14:09.978]  Send that stuff over.
[02:14:09.978 --> 02:14:12.459]  I gotta jump, because I promised to get to a lot of callers, Nathan.
[02:14:12.459 --> 02:14:13.479]  Tim in Michigan.
[02:14:13.479 --> 02:14:14.259]  Tim, you're on the air.
[02:14:14.259 --> 02:14:16.220]  Go ahead.
[02:14:16.220 --> 02:14:16.680]  Hey, Alex.
[02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:17.901]  Can you hear me?
[02:14:17.901 --> 02:14:19.621]  Strike leader, you are live.
[02:14:19.621 --> 02:14:20.642]  We are V2.
[02:14:20.642 --> 02:14:21.022]  Go ahead.
[02:14:22.810 --> 02:14:23.590]  Okay, Alex.
[02:14:23.590 --> 02:14:26.032]  Hey, how are you doing today, anyway?
[02:14:26.032 --> 02:14:29.934]  Listen, you know, I heard that gentleman say something about the U.S.
[02:14:29.934 --> 02:14:30.695]  printing money.
[02:14:30.695 --> 02:14:38.359]  I just wanted to get your quick answer to this.
[02:14:38.359 --> 02:14:45.384]  I am under the notion that as long as the U.S.
[02:14:45.384 --> 02:14:48.026]  remains, you know, the
[02:14:49.299 --> 02:14:49.679]  Thank you.
[02:15:04.159 --> 02:15:08.183]  Right, that they will no longer be able just to print money.
[02:15:08.183 --> 02:15:18.351]  So what the G20's been doing in the last five years is concerted devaluation of all major currencies to try to hide the inflation, but that's not happening now.
[02:15:18.351 --> 02:15:28.059]  So it's forcing a rush into commodities, which then exacerbates things going up even higher on top of dollar devaluation to purchase vital resources, food, energy.
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:33.162]  And that also drives investors and governments into gold and silver.
[02:15:33.162 --> 02:15:41.546]  So that's why they just try to use a propaganda overlay while the elites hoard gold and silver to tell the public Justin Bieber doesn't like gold.
[02:15:41.546 --> 02:15:43.728]  And they go, well, Justin Bieber doesn't like it.
[02:15:43.728 --> 02:15:45.128]  It's a horrible investment.
[02:15:45.128 --> 02:15:48.590]  It's only gone up 400% in the last 10 years.
[02:15:48.590 --> 02:15:50.431]  Justin Bieber says don't get it.
[02:15:50.431 --> 02:15:52.652]  And they go, Justin Bieber says don't get it.
[02:15:52.652 --> 02:15:54.173]  And so they feel very genius.
[02:15:54.173 --> 02:15:58.195]  And they waddle around and watch their football games and suck their thumbs with pleasure.
[02:15:58.655 --> 02:16:00.416]  But I mean, what's your question?
[02:16:00.416 --> 02:16:02.156]  Why are you doing that?
[02:16:02.156 --> 02:16:03.977]  Just watch Justin Bieber, man.
[02:16:03.977 --> 02:16:04.797]  Come on.
[02:16:22.997 --> 02:16:25.019]  That'll save us, come on.
[02:16:25.019 --> 02:16:26.881]  Lady Gaga, come on man.
[02:16:26.881 --> 02:16:28.923]  Gaga came out with an egg, okay?
[02:16:28.923 --> 02:16:39.132]  I mean, God, that's more important than me trying to be telling people that you can't be proactive.
[02:16:39.132 --> 02:16:41.214]  That there is things you can do.
[02:16:41.214 --> 02:16:44.177]  Oh look, we're getting fluoride taken out all over the world.
[02:16:44.177 --> 02:16:45.338]  We're kicking their hind end.
[02:16:45.338 --> 02:16:47.220]  I appreciate your call, Tim.
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:47.720]  Exactly.
[02:16:48.641 --> 02:17:06.382]  Look, when you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball, the Lady Gaga, the Justin Bieber, uh, you know, who gives you these carbon tax messages, they tell your kids they gotta love Justin Bieber, and then Bieber says, hand in your guns, pass the Cybersecurity Act, and, uh...
[02:17:07.503 --> 02:17:07.924]  Yeah.
[02:17:24.946 --> 02:17:26.927]  He's cooler than Justin Bieber.
[02:17:26.927 --> 02:17:32.008]  He circumnavigated with one ship the entire planet.
[02:17:32.008 --> 02:17:35.889]  He was killed by wild NATOs before they got back to Portugal.
[02:17:35.889 --> 02:17:44.652]  And when they got back, there was only like 11 people alive of the 200-and-something crew, and the entire ship was rotting down to the waterline.
[02:17:44.652 --> 02:17:45.912]  That's destiny.
[02:17:45.912 --> 02:17:47.092]  That's will.
[02:17:47.092 --> 02:17:48.593]  That's striving.
[02:17:48.593 --> 02:17:52.354]  That's being a trailblazer, an explorer, going into space.
[02:17:52.634 --> 02:17:53.415]  Mathematics!
[02:17:53.415 --> 02:17:54.355]  Quantum mechanics!
[02:17:54.355 --> 02:17:55.857]  The secrets of the universe!
[02:17:55.857 --> 02:17:56.817]  It's all there!
[02:17:56.817 --> 02:17:58.919]  Life is fiery with its beauty!
[02:17:58.919 --> 02:18:00.721]  It's incredible detail!
[02:18:00.721 --> 02:18:01.781]  Tuning into it!
[02:18:01.781 --> 02:18:03.423]  They want to shatter your mind!
[02:18:03.423 --> 02:18:07.186]  Talking about Justin Bieber!
[02:18:07.186 --> 02:18:08.427]  It's pure evil!
[02:18:08.427 --> 02:18:13.170]  They're taking your intellect, your soul, and giving you Michael Jordan and Bieber!
[02:18:14.520 --> 02:18:16.601]  UNLOCK YOUR HUMAN POTENTIAL!
[02:18:16.601 --> 02:18:19.023]  DEFEAT THE GLOBALISTS WHO WANT TO SHATTER YOUR MIND!
[02:18:19.023 --> 02:18:21.144]  YOUR DOORWAYS TO PERCEPTION!
[02:18:21.144 --> 02:18:23.906]  I WANT TO SEE YOU TRULY LIVE!
[02:18:23.906 --> 02:18:26.968]  I WANT TO SEE YOU TRULY BE WHO YOU ARE!
[02:18:26.968 --> 02:18:40.276]  I DON'T WANT MY PROGENY WHO'S COMING, MY UNBORN GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN, TO LIVE IN THIS NIGHTMARE SYSTEM THESE CONTROL FREAKS HAVE CREATED!
[02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:55.290]  Where these wicked globalists are so threatened by human potential, they poison the water, the vaccines, the food, to turn us into a bunch of slugs, a bunch of lobotomized sloths so they can control us.
[02:18:55.290 --> 02:18:56.571]  It is a crime.
[02:18:56.571 --> 02:19:05.338]  It is the most jealous, envious, greedy, hateful, sickening thing the New World Order does, and that's why I am so pleased to be committed in the fight against them.
[02:19:05.638 --> 02:19:09.241]  That's why I don't care about my own life except I want to continue to live to fight them.
[02:19:09.241 --> 02:19:11.623]  That's why I don't have fear.
[02:19:11.623 --> 02:19:18.468]  I only have fear of myself and my flesh and not being up to the challenge!
[02:19:18.468 --> 02:19:23.992]  And I ask you to look in the mirror and ask yourselves, what are you doing in this time of great challenge?
[02:19:23.992 --> 02:19:25.573]  What are you doing to unlock minds?
[02:19:26.678 --> 02:19:31.063]  Once you unlock a mind, once you unlock somebody, then they can unlock their soul.
[02:19:31.063 --> 02:19:32.645]  We can't unlock a soul.
[02:19:32.645 --> 02:19:33.967]  Only God can do that.
[02:19:33.967 --> 02:19:35.569]  But we can unlock minds.
[02:19:35.569 --> 02:19:40.134]  And once the mind is unlocked, once the intellect is turned on, then comes the discernment.
[02:19:40.134 --> 02:19:42.136]  Then comes the awakening of the soul.
[02:19:42.136 --> 02:19:45.601]  Then comes true enlightenment and empowerment!
[02:19:46.837 --> 02:19:54.782]  So the globalists make you a bunch of jealous, stunted, weak, backstabbing, gibbering demons.
[02:19:54.782 --> 02:19:57.824]  All of us have the lower elements and the higher.
[02:19:57.824 --> 02:19:59.345]  We must strive for the higher.
[02:19:59.345 --> 02:20:00.126]  Stay with us!
[02:20:01.809 --> 02:20:05.011]  Forget everything you've been told about long-term food storage.
[02:20:05.011 --> 02:20:13.095]  When the collapse happens, you'll need the single most effective way to get high-powered Delta Force nutrients to your family fast.
[02:20:13.095 --> 02:20:16.196]  Like any Special Forces commando, you need a plan.
[02:20:16.196 --> 02:20:18.737]  You need a Black Hawk Down food plan.
[02:20:18.737 --> 02:20:21.859]  Introducing the Survival Sprout Bank from Solutions from Science.
[02:20:22.139 --> 02:20:24.181]  It's your countertop survival garden.
[02:20:24.181 --> 02:20:28.764]  Yes, grow fresh greens right on your countertop in just a few short days.
[02:20:28.764 --> 02:20:35.830]  Sprouts are the green shoots that emerge from newly germinated seeds, and they are powerhouses of living, easily absorbed nutrients.
[02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:39.433]  The Survival Sprout Bank is a complete kit with nothing else to buy.
[02:20:39.433 --> 02:20:43.836]  And with sprouts so easy to grow, even children can grow emergency food.
[02:20:43.836 --> 02:20:45.278]  Call 877-327-0365 or go to survivalsproutbank.com.
[02:20:45.278 --> 02:20:45.498]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:21:01.970 --> 02:21:05.992]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:05.992 --> 02:21:09.235]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:09.235 --> 02:21:14.398]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:14.398 --> 02:21:20.202]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shot.
[02:21:20.402 --> 02:21:25.387]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:35.717 --> 02:21:38.059]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:38.059 --> 02:21:39.640]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:39.640 --> 02:21:42.101]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:42.101 --> 02:21:44.223]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:44.223 --> 02:21:49.367]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:49.367 --> 02:21:58.573]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:00.234 --> 02:22:03.197]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[02:22:03.197 --> 02:22:07.341]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[02:22:07.341 --> 02:22:09.623]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:22:09.623 --> 02:22:14.768]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[02:22:14.768 --> 02:22:16.589]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[02:22:16.589 --> 02:22:18.151]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:22:18.151 --> 02:22:19.632]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[02:22:19.632 --> 02:22:22.675]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:22:22.975 --> 02:22:28.359]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:22:28.359 --> 02:22:37.706]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[02:22:37.706 --> 02:22:40.028]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:46.354]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[02:22:46.354 --> 02:22:50.158]  Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.

[02:22:59.622 --> 02:23:03.063]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[02:23:03.063 --> 02:23:10.884]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[02:23:10.884 --> 02:23:15.445]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[02:23:15.445 --> 02:23:16.885]  It is glutathione.
[02:23:16.885 --> 02:23:20.946]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[02:23:20.946 --> 02:23:24.307]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[02:23:24.947 --> 02:23:30.731]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[02:23:30.731 --> 02:23:37.976]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[02:23:37.976 --> 02:23:42.800]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[02:23:44.401 --> 02:23:46.804]  One World Whey comes in three delicious flavors.
[02:23:46.804 --> 02:23:47.204]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:23:47.204 --> 02:23:47.444]  That's 888-988-3325.

[02:23:48.726 --> 02:23:49.867]  That's One World W-H-E-Y dot com.
[02:24:19.727 --> 02:24:30.334]  He's going the distance!
[02:24:30.334 --> 02:24:33.136]  Speed it up, horse!
[02:24:33.136 --> 02:24:37.018]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Colorado.
[02:24:37.018 --> 02:24:38.159]  You're on the air.
[02:24:38.159 --> 02:24:38.600]  Welcome.
[02:24:46.249 --> 02:24:48.630]  Hi Alex, great to be on your program.
[02:24:48.630 --> 02:24:57.793]  I met you first in Chicago in 2006, and then I was there at the MSNBC protest.
[02:24:57.793 --> 02:24:59.373]  Oh boy, that was crazy!
[02:24:59.373 --> 02:25:01.894]  That was crazy.
[02:25:01.894 --> 02:25:14.678]  What I was doing frantically before I got on the phone with you was go to my closet to find a book called The Mighty Wulitzer, How the CIA Played America, and I'd just like to comment about how the CIA is
[02:25:15.302 --> 02:25:26.624]  They're playing America today, not only on the mainstream media, which is a given, but on alternative outlets like Free Speech TV, Democracy Now, etc.
[02:25:26.624 --> 02:25:28.284]  Yeah, well they're not really independent.
[02:25:28.284 --> 02:25:30.205]  That's all Ford Foundation.
[02:25:30.205 --> 02:25:30.865]  Yeah, that's exact.
[02:25:30.865 --> 02:25:42.407]  Ford Foundation, Soros, and not only are they playing America on those things, those particular programs are leading the charge of regime change in the Arab world.
[02:25:43.403 --> 02:25:51.245]  Yeah, I mean, but meanwhile they demonize the American people, taking the states back in our beautiful form, the model of the world for true liberty.
[02:25:51.245 --> 02:25:52.986]  Oh, that's evil and bad to protest.
[02:25:52.986 --> 02:25:53.926]  It's violent.
[02:25:53.926 --> 02:25:56.707]  It could cause people to, oh, oh, let's not do that.
[02:25:56.707 --> 02:25:58.187]  But then, oh, it's so wonderful.
[02:25:58.187 --> 02:26:01.168]  And then they put more dictators in, in Egypt.
[02:26:01.168 --> 02:26:07.489]  I mean, it's, it's, they're removing dictators that weren't 100% pliant and it's going to jack up energy prices.
[02:26:10.501 --> 02:26:12.523]  I remembered Lindsey Grant.
[02:26:12.523 --> 02:26:13.644]  Who is it?
[02:26:13.644 --> 02:26:14.404]  Is it Lindsey?
[02:26:14.404 --> 02:26:14.965]  Lindsey Williams.
[02:26:14.965 --> 02:26:17.507]  Lindsey Grant.
[02:26:17.507 --> 02:26:18.708]  Who's the guy that you had on?
[02:26:18.708 --> 02:26:19.269]  Lindsey Williams.
[02:26:19.269 --> 02:26:19.869]  Lindsey Williams.
[02:26:19.869 --> 02:26:20.630]  Lindsey Williams.
[02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:21.491]  Yes.
[02:26:21.491 --> 02:26:29.037]  When I first heard you talk about ElBaradei, I thought you were kind of whacked out, you know, until I heard Webster Tarpley.
[02:26:29.037 --> 02:26:34.282]  And then when I remembered the gentleman, Lindsey Williams.
[02:26:35.237 --> 02:26:55.338]  And then what came to me when Mubarak was taken down is the fact that I made the speech about the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center at one of the conferences, and Mubarak had been targeted by the CIA for a few times to make sure he would be a reliable puppet.
[02:26:55.338 --> 02:26:57.521]  Mubarak was the guy that fingered
[02:26:58.467 --> 02:27:03.191]  Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman is a paid CIA agent.
[02:27:03.191 --> 02:27:09.035]  Oh yeah, it was in the Egyptian news, and they hired Ahmad Salam to go build the bomb, and then he said, okay, let's bust them.
[02:27:09.035 --> 02:27:11.017]  And they said, no, we're gonna let it go forward.
[02:27:11.017 --> 02:27:17.722]  He knew they were setting him up, and probably trying to, because he worked for Mubarak, he was an Egyptian CIA agent or intelligence agent.
[02:27:17.722 --> 02:27:27.029]  He thought they were setting him up, so he recorded them, and then he went and gave a press conference, and that's why that all came out at the time that the Feds had basically run the 93 World Trade Center attack.
[02:27:27.892 --> 02:27:32.976]  Mubarak basically fingered the Patsy's and it was a suppressed news story too for a while.
[02:27:32.976 --> 02:27:38.801]  The other thing I'd like to comment on, oh yeah, Eva Destruction I think is the song you're trying to find?
[02:27:38.801 --> 02:27:41.503]  By Barry McGuire?
[02:27:41.503 --> 02:27:44.806]  Yeah, no, I'm familiar with that song, that would be good bumper music.
[02:27:44.806 --> 02:27:47.489]  No, when I was saying Symphony of Destruction,
[02:27:48.477 --> 02:27:48.977]  Okay.
[02:27:48.977 --> 02:27:50.798]  Yeah, that's Megadeth.
[02:27:50.798 --> 02:27:54.138]  By the way, Dave Mustaine, listener of the show, of course, been on.
[02:27:54.138 --> 02:27:57.139]  He named his latest hit album, Endgame, after our film.
[02:27:57.139 --> 02:28:01.500]  Another example of how we're breaking out and having a huge effect across the board.
[02:28:01.500 --> 02:28:02.620]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:03.980]  Let's talk to Ron in Illinois.
[02:28:03.980 --> 02:28:04.800]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:06.561]  Hi, Glenn.
[02:28:06.561 --> 02:28:07.641]  I could hang on long enough.
[02:28:07.641 --> 02:28:08.941]  I've got a question for you.
[02:28:08.941 --> 02:28:11.522]  This has more to do with a sponsor.
[02:28:11.522 --> 02:28:13.322]  I think it's Solutions from Science.
[02:28:13.322 --> 02:28:13.462]  Yes.
[02:28:15.262 --> 02:28:19.405]  The book, Surviving Martial Law, I think was put out by them.
[02:28:19.405 --> 02:28:20.807]  It's been a long time.
[02:28:20.807 --> 02:28:22.368]  I've been trying to call.
[02:28:22.368 --> 02:28:25.391]  There were footnotes at the back of the book, and it made statements.
[02:28:25.391 --> 02:28:29.435]  And I've been trying to back up a statement, and I've not been able to find it at all.
[02:28:29.935 --> 02:28:33.757]  Would I talk to you, or could you direct me to talk to somebody to verify something?
[02:28:33.757 --> 02:28:47.043]  Yeah, I mean, I like solutions from science and the storable seeds they have, and the solar generators, and I know they have a book about how to hide your guns, and I think they may have put out a deal about Marshall Law or maybe another sponsor, but I'll try to answer your question as best I can.
[02:28:47.043 --> 02:28:48.284]  What's the statement at the back of the book?
[02:28:49.119 --> 02:28:57.344]  Okay, the statement at the back of the book is something about an executive order signed by Bush to allow foreign troops on our soil.
[02:28:57.344 --> 02:29:00.105]  Oh yeah, that's... I don't have... Are you kidding?
[02:29:00.105 --> 02:29:02.167]  I mean, they have security arrangements.
[02:29:02.167 --> 02:29:05.589]  It's Toronto News Associated Press.
[02:29:05.589 --> 02:29:07.189]  It's in my film Road to Tyranny.
[02:29:07.189 --> 02:29:14.674]  I actually have the articles blown up where they sign the agreements to use Canadian and Mexican troops here domestically.
[02:29:15.094 --> 02:29:15.334]  I don't
[02:29:32.675 --> 02:29:34.656]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:34.656 --> 02:29:36.397]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.388 --> 02:30:04.972]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:30:04.972 --> 02:30:06.093]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:30:06.093 --> 02:30:10.658]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:30:10.658 --> 02:30:16.605]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:30:16.605 --> 02:30:18.767]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:30:18.767 --> 02:30:21.450]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:30:21.790 --> 02:30:28.273]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[02:30:28.273 --> 02:30:30.494]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:30:30.494 --> 02:30:35.836]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:30:35.836 --> 02:30:41.118]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:30:41.118 --> 02:30:46.481]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:30:46.481 --> 02:30:49.422]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:30:49.662 --> 02:30:54.926]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:30:54.926 --> 02:30:59.989]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:30:59.989 --> 02:31:01.951]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:31:01.951 --> 02:31:08.875]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:08.875 --> 02:31:11.157]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:11.417 --> 02:31:16.800]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:19.841]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:19.841 --> 02:31:22.163]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:22.163 --> 02:31:28.426]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.426 --> 02:31:31.788]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:31.788 --> 02:31:37.571]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:37.571 --> 02:31:39.231]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.231 --> 02:31:40.352]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:40.492 --> 02:31:43.174]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:43.174 --> 02:31:47.398]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:47.398 --> 02:31:52.042]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:31:52.042 --> 02:31:54.625]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[02:31:54.625 --> 02:31:57.628]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:31:57.628 --> 02:31:58.248]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[02:32:00.461 --> 02:32:04.667]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:32:04.667 --> 02:32:11.075]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:32:11.075 --> 02:32:15.401]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much
[02:32:15.421 --> 02:32:15.821]  I think so.
[02:32:36.247 --> 02:32:43.008]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:32:43.008 --> 02:32:46.909]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:32:46.909 --> 02:32:53.271]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:32:53.271 --> 02:32:54.051]  Thank you.
[02:33:07.539 --> 02:33:08.420]  Definite taxes.
[02:33:08.420 --> 02:33:09.740]  No talk about politics or religion.
[02:33:09.740 --> 02:33:13.842]  This is all the equivalent of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line.
[02:33:13.842 --> 02:33:14.923]  Lay down, G.I.
[02:33:14.923 --> 02:33:16.144]  Lay down, G.I.
[02:33:16.144 --> 02:33:18.165]  We saw it all through the 20th century.
[02:33:18.165 --> 02:33:24.708]  And now in the 21st century, it's time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze.
[02:33:24.708 --> 02:33:25.809]  We should not submit.
[02:33:26.069 --> 02:33:27.530]  To dehumanization.
[02:33:27.530 --> 02:33:31.171]  I don't know about you, but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world.
[02:33:31.171 --> 02:33:32.892]  I'm concerned with the structure.
[02:33:32.892 --> 02:33:35.153]  I'm concerned with the systems of control.
[02:33:35.153 --> 02:33:39.594]  Those that control my life, and those that seek to control it even more!
[02:33:39.594 --> 02:33:40.615]  I want freedom!
[02:33:40.615 --> 02:33:42.936]  That's what I want, and that's what they should want!
[02:33:43.516 --> 02:33:51.844]  It's up to each and every one of us to turn with just some of the greed, the hatred, the envy, and yes, the insecurities, because that is the central mode of control.
[02:33:51.844 --> 02:33:59.091]  Make us feel pathetic, small, so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our destiny.
[02:33:59.091 --> 02:34:03.615]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
[02:34:03.615 --> 02:34:06.338]  Start challenging this corporate slave state.
[02:34:06.338 --> 02:34:07.479]  The 21st century is going to be a
[02:34:07.799 --> 02:34:13.104]  It's going to be the age of humankind standing up for something pure and something right!
[02:34:22.973 --> 02:34:27.055]  What a bunch of garbage Liberal, Democrat, Conservative, Republican!
[02:34:27.055 --> 02:34:30.376]  It's all there to control you two sides of the same coin!
[02:34:30.376 --> 02:34:35.879]  Two management teams bidding for control of the CEO job of Slavery Incorporated!
[02:34:35.879 --> 02:34:39.680]  The truth is out there in front of you, but they lay out this buffet of lies!
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:42.702]  I'm sick of it, and I'm not going to take a bite out of it!
[02:34:42.702 --> 02:34:43.282]  Do you got me?
[02:34:47.383 --> 02:34:48.884]  Humankind is too good.
[02:34:48.884 --> 02:34:50.365]  We're not a bunch of underachievers.
[02:34:50.365 --> 02:34:53.046]  We're going to stand up and we're going to be human beings.
[02:34:53.046 --> 02:34:55.406]  We're going to be fighting for the real things.
[02:34:55.406 --> 02:34:56.827]  The things that matter.
[02:34:56.827 --> 02:35:01.769]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[02:35:01.769 --> 02:35:02.349]  Well, that's it.
[02:35:02.349 --> 02:35:03.610]  That's all I got to say.
[02:35:03.610 --> 02:35:04.270]  Continue recording.
[02:35:09.554 --> 02:35:19.823]  We are back live, and that, of course, was the ultimate red pill, a remix of my appearance in the film Waking Life, a Richard Linklater Award-winning film.
[02:35:19.823 --> 02:35:28.891]  I want to go back to your phone calls and more of the news here, but these bad boys, a few weeks ago, we got the V for Victory t-shirts, You Are the Resistance in.
[02:35:28.891 --> 02:35:31.873]  Now we have these bumper stickers, pretty close to cost.
[02:35:31.873 --> 02:35:37.078]  You Are the Resistance, designed by... Phil, did you design this, or did Janae?
[02:35:39.261 --> 02:35:40.361]  Phil did a great job.
[02:35:40.361 --> 02:35:41.502]  He did this.
[02:35:41.502 --> 02:35:44.742]  And I'll give folks an actual camera shot of this.
[02:35:44.742 --> 02:35:55.365]  If you're a radio listener, go to Infowars.com and click on the online video bookstore shopping cart where we got the t-shirts, the Draft Ron Paul t-shirts, the You Are The Resistance.
[02:35:55.365 --> 02:35:59.466]  I'd like to see these up on cars and other places.
[02:35:59.466 --> 02:36:01.427]  And I instructed them a month ago when we
[02:36:02.403 --> 02:36:02.523]  Yes.
[02:36:20.051 --> 02:36:21.574]  Oh, $6.95.
[02:36:21.574 --> 02:36:22.094]  Excuse me.
[02:36:22.094 --> 02:36:23.497]  So they are close to cost.
[02:36:23.497 --> 02:36:24.398]  Good.
[02:36:24.398 --> 02:36:26.882]  Okay, so there's $6.95 for $15.
[02:36:26.882 --> 02:36:30.608]  I'm looking way across the room and can't read it.
[02:36:30.608 --> 02:36:31.570]  So they've got $100 pack for $19.
[02:36:34.628 --> 02:36:37.471]  A hundred pack of these gorgeous bumper stickers for $19.
[02:36:37.471 --> 02:36:40.153]  They got a 50 pack for $8.
[02:36:40.153 --> 02:36:44.737]  They got a 15 pack for $6.95.
[02:36:44.737 --> 02:36:46.578]  And of course, a little bit of profit we make.
[02:36:46.578 --> 02:36:52.183]  I don't think there's much there because I didn't instruct them to make it almost at cost, you know, so we can also cover the shipping and handling.
[02:36:52.183 --> 02:36:55.686]  But can you imagine what a hundred of these bad boys can do around town?
[02:36:56.827 --> 02:36:59.888]  Let's make sure it's legal and lawful, or you post them.
[02:36:59.888 --> 02:37:02.528]  But it's not like we're in a revolution here.
[02:37:02.528 --> 02:37:06.630]  Oh, the government says it's good when people are going after police and burning things.
[02:37:06.630 --> 02:37:08.470]  I think that's bad.
[02:37:08.470 --> 02:37:15.412]  But then our media tells us that it's great when people get violent overseas, when it's a regime they want to topple.
[02:37:15.412 --> 02:37:17.612]  But then they tell you it's evil.
[02:37:17.612 --> 02:37:21.733]  Evil to even have a political bumper sticker on your car, much less post it in public.
[02:37:21.733 --> 02:37:23.214]  Oh, that's so violent and evil.
[02:37:25.751 --> 02:37:36.059]  So again, you are the resistance, InfoWars.com with the big red V available at InfoWars.com by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:37:36.059 --> 02:37:40.803]  Imagine if everybody listening to me in Austin ordered 50 of these or 100 of these and put them up.
[02:37:40.803 --> 02:37:43.725]  Wow, that would be a big saturation effect.
[02:37:43.725 --> 02:37:45.987]  Let's launch Operation V in every city.
[02:37:45.987 --> 02:37:49.990]  Or you're welcome to make your own design of bumper stickers and post them everywhere.
[02:37:49.990 --> 02:37:53.413]  But again, what I'm saying about revolution is this.
[02:37:54.756 --> 02:37:56.477]  I want a revolution of ideas.
[02:37:56.477 --> 02:37:58.458]  I want a renaissance, an awakening.
[02:37:58.458 --> 02:38:05.361]  I want to rediscover the Bill of Rights and Constitution, liberty culture, and take our states back, and then our federal government back, and block the globalists at the pass.
[02:38:06.556 --> 02:38:07.336]  Okay.
[02:38:07.336 --> 02:38:09.117]  And that means you getting involved.
[02:38:09.117 --> 02:38:13.420]  I am not for violent revolution offensively to defend yourself.
[02:38:13.420 --> 02:38:18.162]  And if we go deep into super tyranny, then you got to do what you got to do to protect you and your family.
[02:38:18.162 --> 02:38:28.328]  But it's when you see the George Soros and the State Department involved in all this stuff, you know, it's going to hurt the people in those countries even more as bad as their ridiculous clown like.
[02:38:29.108 --> 02:38:34.190]  Muammar Gaddafi is as bad as Hosni Mubarak, the globalist puppet is.
[02:38:34.190 --> 02:38:35.930]  Why is this now happening?
[02:38:35.930 --> 02:38:37.551]  They want the world in turmoil.
[02:38:37.551 --> 02:38:42.532]  And so we should support the people in Libya and Egypt and reach out to them.
[02:38:42.532 --> 02:38:43.793]  In fact, I thought about shooting videos.
[02:38:44.957 --> 02:38:47.178]  I know we have a lot of listeners who can then translate it into Arabic.
[02:38:47.178 --> 02:38:50.039]  You know, make a version that way.
[02:38:50.039 --> 02:38:52.120]  We don't have the skills or the people to do it.
[02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:53.641]  I guess we could if we dropped everything.
[02:38:53.641 --> 02:38:56.122]  But the point is, maybe I should make a video reaching out.
[02:38:56.122 --> 02:39:03.045]  I thought about this weeks ago to the Arabs and others about, hey, understand you don't want globalists installing something of their own after this.
[02:39:03.045 --> 02:39:03.846]  You want real freedom.
[02:39:03.846 --> 02:39:07.707]  And obviously they know that, but it's good to have that solidarity back and forth.
[02:39:07.707 --> 02:39:10.169]  That's all I'm saying here.
[02:39:10.169 --> 02:39:12.249]  Let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Vermont.
[02:39:12.249 --> 02:39:13.010]  Scott, you're on the air.
[02:39:13.629 --> 02:39:14.289]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:39:14.289 --> 02:39:16.731]  It's been a few years since I talked to you.
[02:39:16.731 --> 02:39:18.492]  Um, a couple things to report from Vermont.
[02:39:18.492 --> 02:39:23.936]  Uh, we have, uh, people think that Vermont is, uh, one of the best on, uh, Second Amendment rights.
[02:39:23.936 --> 02:39:42.388]  And, uh, actually a few years ago, I should have called you, but three years ago after it happened, I heard about it from the, uh, proprietor of the flea market, who said, and told others how, the reason why the sign used to say, uh, no dogs allowed, now it says, uh, no dogs or firearms allowed, is because, uh, the dealer, he doesn't let dealers sell firearms there like he used to anymore.
[02:39:43.109 --> 02:39:47.833]  Because he had half a dozen or almost feds, I think he said from Boston.
[02:39:47.833 --> 02:40:07.490]  I know, they run stings, and they normally bring an ex-con or an illegal alien in, and then they trick somebody to do a private sale, which is like you selling a gun to your neighbor, so they can then threaten the owner of the facility to shut down anybody being able to lease it who allows firearms, and that's the so-called gun show loophole they're trying to shut down everywhere.
[02:40:08.303 --> 02:40:10.344]  It wasn't gun shows exactly, but the flea markets.
[02:40:10.344 --> 02:40:18.926]  As far as I know, I still have the right to sell a firearm in my yard sale if I want to in Vermont, but he was literally strong-armed.
[02:40:18.926 --> 02:40:33.591]  One of the feds squeezed his arm while saying, you're not going to let me... Well, what you do is you go to the flea market with photos of your firearm, you make sure the person has a driver's license for your own safety, and say you don't have a felony, and they say yes, and you go, okay, let's go to the hamburger place down the road and I'll sell it to you there.
[02:40:34.562 --> 02:40:35.283]  It should have happened.
[02:40:35.283 --> 02:40:40.426]  It was a bunch of guys, you know, unorganized militia guys should have stood around and said, hey, you feds, get out of here.
[02:40:40.426 --> 02:40:43.388]  But he buckled in and he can't sell firearms at the flea market anymore.
[02:40:43.388 --> 02:40:51.033]  Well, Scott, we've done our best here in Austin, you know, breaking the same stings going on at the gun show and trying to promote the new location they had to move to.
[02:40:51.033 --> 02:40:57.618]  But this is a strategy all over the nation to shut down the legal private sale of firearms at flea markets and gun shows.
[02:40:57.618 --> 02:41:03.722]  So when I said the gun show loophole, that's what the government calls it when you sell your neighbor a gun or you sell them at a flea market or anywhere.
[02:41:04.471 --> 02:41:08.934]  Yeah, and we have a new CFR member as a state senator in Vermont now.
[02:41:08.934 --> 02:41:12.417]  This guy's a multi-millionaire, as far as I know from his Kurdish oil deals.
[02:41:12.417 --> 02:41:14.559]  You may know who I'm talking about.
[02:41:14.559 --> 02:41:19.803]  His father was a CFR member, and his father resigned in disgust, and this man, Peter Galbraith,
[02:41:20.154 --> 02:41:42.698]  He acknowledged the fact that his father resigned from the CFR and discussed the undue influence of it, and he tried to insult my intelligence by telling me, and he became, he got elected by the way, not that there was much choice between one lefty or another, he's a limousine liberal, I call him, but remember the Council on Foreign Relations, which he tried to tell me, oh it's just a boring talk group.
[02:41:42.958 --> 02:41:43.458]  No, I hear you.
[02:41:43.458 --> 02:41:44.739]  I appreciate the call.
[02:41:44.739 --> 02:41:47.501]  What they do is they get about 5,000 people together.
[02:41:47.501 --> 02:41:49.783]  The leadership are totally globalist.
[02:41:49.783 --> 02:41:52.965]  The publication they put out called Foreign Affairs every month on newsstands.
[02:41:52.965 --> 02:41:55.046]  It's like a book, but it's on magazine stands.
[02:41:55.046 --> 02:41:57.868]  It's a great book, usually about 200 pages long.
[02:41:57.868 --> 02:42:02.231]  It openly calls for the end of this country and the end of our sovereignty, and Rockefeller writes books about it.
[02:42:02.231 --> 02:42:09.676]  Then they get kind of mid-level power people in there to control them, and if they sell out, then they move up the ranks.
[02:42:09.676 --> 02:42:10.777]  Good point, Scott.
[02:42:10.777 --> 02:42:12.378]  Let's talk to Michael in California.
[02:42:13.058 --> 02:42:22.263]  Hey Alex, you know what's going on with the Ron Paul Front today?
[02:42:22.263 --> 02:42:24.405]  Oh, I'm sorry Alex.
[02:42:24.405 --> 02:42:25.665]  I'm sorry.
[02:42:25.665 --> 02:42:29.327]  I just called to ask if you knew what was going on with the Ron Paul Front today.
[02:42:32.679 --> 02:42:35.662]  We have Ron Paul Liberty Pack Money Bomb going on today.
[02:42:35.662 --> 02:42:39.026]  We just exceeded $427,000.
[02:42:39.026 --> 02:42:47.976]  Well we're big supporters of Ron Paul and as the campaign builds up we're going to continue to try to support it so people should check out Campaign for Liberty and get involved in that.
[02:42:47.976 --> 02:42:51.460]  Do you have any comments about what's happening in the world today?
[02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:58.823]  Well, as far as the world in general, the reason my main call was because of Ron Paul.
[02:42:58.823 --> 02:43:01.424]  And we need to energize this info war.
[02:43:01.424 --> 02:43:10.789]  And because of the world events that we have going on around us, Ron Paul is the answer to many of the problems that we have here in our country.
[02:43:10.789 --> 02:43:11.809]  No, he's perfect.
[02:43:11.809 --> 02:43:12.330]  He's perfect.
[02:43:12.330 --> 02:43:17.492]  It would be better if he was a little bit younger, just so the media wouldn't spit it that he's too old, but he's in pretty good health.
[02:43:19.093 --> 02:43:22.674]  Even if he doesn't win running for president, he'll be there to inject real ideas.
[02:43:22.674 --> 02:43:26.856]  I think it's dangerous, though, and Ron Paul said this, to put all our eggs in one basket.
[02:43:26.856 --> 02:43:44.543]  We support Ron Paul, but we also support the Liberty-style movement, you know, the True Tea Party, at the state level, so we can block the feds via the 9th and 10th Amendment, just like the states are saying no to government-run health care, just like the states are saying no to fluoride at many other levels, no to the Patriot Act.
[02:43:45.183 --> 02:43:53.889]  The states are coming in and trying to defend our borders and our sovereignty via the Globalist North American Union plan to flood the country with cheap labor also as a voting bloc.
[02:43:53.889 --> 02:43:55.690]  So absolutely, I appreciate your call.
[02:43:55.690 --> 02:43:57.851]  Very exciting to hear that.
[02:43:57.851 --> 02:44:00.072]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Kansas.
[02:44:00.072 --> 02:44:03.174]  Dave, you're on the air.
[02:44:03.174 --> 02:44:04.835]  Yeah, Alex, I just wanted to update you.
[02:44:04.835 --> 02:44:07.937]  I know you have your Google bombs and all that other stuff.
[02:44:07.937 --> 02:44:12.360]  And one interesting thing I've noticed over the past several weeks, and this is rather disturbing,
[02:44:12.927 --> 02:44:23.293]  I added you to my favorites link on my computer, and every time I go on to the favorites link, it's popping up with the Bing web page.
[02:44:23.293 --> 02:44:24.414]  And I'm like, what the heck?
[02:44:24.414 --> 02:44:25.395]  And I kept on doing it.
[02:44:25.395 --> 02:44:34.340]  I reloaded your, back on the favorites, went to your website, and put, and relinked it, and went back on Bing, so I actually have to go to the alternative
[02:44:34.841 --> 02:44:35.161]  Well thank you.
[02:44:35.161 --> 02:44:36.883]  There is a cocktail of things going on.
[02:44:52.888 --> 02:44:53.089]  I think?
[02:45:09.327 --> 02:45:17.656]  Especially overseas, Google, if you're using Google, or even have them on your computer, they'll put a message up saying, do you want to go to this website?
[02:45:17.656 --> 02:45:19.358]  It could be dangerous.
[02:45:19.358 --> 02:45:22.642]  And they're doing that more and more to innocent websites.
[02:45:22.642 --> 02:45:28.668]  Now this didn't happen to us two weeks ago, a week and a half ago, but it happened to 84,000 other sites, getting the news reported.
[02:45:29.449 --> 02:45:38.213]  Including real estate companies, dog grooming, car dealerships, restaurants, 84,000 websites.
[02:45:38.213 --> 02:45:42.035]  The Feds just seized them, claiming that there was child pornography on them.
[02:45:42.035 --> 02:45:43.835]  It turned out there was no child pornography.
[02:45:43.835 --> 02:45:45.576]  And they put a message up.
[02:45:45.576 --> 02:45:50.498]  The Feds route the DNS to their server, saying this is a child porn website.
[02:45:50.498 --> 02:45:51.679]  And they're just going to keep doing it.
[02:45:52.515 --> 02:45:55.140]  So that's a beta test for the internet kill switch.
[02:45:55.140 --> 02:45:57.004]  I mean, folks, this is all happening.
[02:45:57.004 --> 02:46:00.431]  There could come a day... Look, already four or five years ago...
[02:46:01.431 --> 02:46:10.157]  The Watson Brothers, when they've been in Europe and in England, they'll try to use the government-free broadband that they take taxpayer money for and then give to you.
[02:46:10.157 --> 02:46:21.245]  Why do schools around the country take federal grants, that's money taken from the people, and then quote, give, obviously the news, the schools giving laptops?
[02:46:21.245 --> 02:46:22.986]  The government just gave it to us!
[02:46:22.986 --> 02:46:24.127]  No, they took somebody's wealth,
[02:46:24.707 --> 02:46:24.967]  We're good
[02:46:42.307 --> 02:46:45.730]  In the last decade, where schools are watching you over the laptops.
[02:46:45.730 --> 02:46:49.133]  And even though it's in the news, the general public knows that's 1984's thing.
[02:46:49.133 --> 02:46:50.774]  Oh, that couldn't be true.
[02:46:50.774 --> 02:46:54.217]  That Alex Goss says they're taking baby's blood at birth.
[02:46:54.217 --> 02:46:56.078]  Oh, well, here's the AP admitting it.
[02:46:56.078 --> 02:46:59.901]  That's not real.
[02:46:59.901 --> 02:47:04.925]  Here's the admission that they're using laptops to watch you at home without warrants.
[02:47:04.925 --> 02:47:08.628]  Oh, I don't want to see that Philadelphia News article.
[02:47:09.409 --> 02:47:11.251]  Oh, well, here it is out of the Sacramento Bee.
[02:47:11.251 --> 02:47:14.535]  I don't want to see it.
[02:47:14.535 --> 02:47:15.896]  Okay.
[02:47:15.896 --> 02:47:19.881]  And so they give you free laptops and watch you at home.
[02:47:19.881 --> 02:47:26.748]  They give you free software, and then Google watches you and listens to you, and it's just kind of in the public domain, but people can't believe it.
[02:47:27.512 --> 02:47:32.575]  Because if you're listening now, and you actually go check what I just said and find out it's true, then you'd be freaked out.
[02:47:32.575 --> 02:47:33.955]  You'd have to do something.
[02:47:33.955 --> 02:47:44.621]  But Justin Bieber's on, and basketball's coming up, and all of this is so wonderful that we're going to get to see LeBron James in Miami.
[02:47:44.621 --> 02:47:45.842]  I mean, that's what's important.
[02:47:45.842 --> 02:47:51.405]  Not the government watching us and private corporations and schools watching kids at home without warrants.
[02:47:51.405 --> 02:47:52.265]  That's not real.
[02:47:52.265 --> 02:47:53.646]  Justin Bieber's real.
[02:47:53.646 --> 02:47:55.807]  That Alex Jones guy, you know, he's crazy.
[02:47:59.140 --> 02:48:00.014]  And that's what they do.
[02:48:02.128 --> 02:48:04.490]  That's how they respond to our facts.
[02:48:04.490 --> 02:48:13.756]  And so the Watsons, and we've confirmed this, many ISPs in Europe, you got an ISP, you pay for the service, they don't let you go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:13.756 --> 02:48:15.817]  They're trying to contain the viral growth.
[02:48:15.817 --> 02:48:25.303]  Or they go to a train station, and the government gives them quote free wireless, that means you pay for it through taxes, but now they can control it because it's free.
[02:48:25.303 --> 02:48:30.607]  And oh, can't go to InfoWars.com, because it has objectionable hate material.
[02:48:33.015 --> 02:48:53.828]  So, yes, for a couple weeks, a few years ago, right when Australia was testing international filters, they said they were going to put hundreds of thousands of sites on it, and it turned out it was Australian dentists and outside companies like, outside of Australia and websites like InfoWars.com.
[02:48:53.828 --> 02:48:56.890]  For a week or two, you just couldn't get to it in New Zealand or Australia.
[02:48:58.237 --> 02:48:59.718]  I mean, that's just what they do.
[02:48:59.718 --> 02:49:01.779]  And they wanted to gauge and see the response.
[02:49:01.779 --> 02:49:08.842]  So, yes, the globalists have noticed with psychology.
[02:49:08.842 --> 02:49:09.542]  Here's an example.
[02:49:09.542 --> 02:49:17.546]  I saw an article where a Washington state representative came back into the airport there in Seattle.
[02:49:17.546 --> 02:49:19.367]  In fact, it's in my stack somewhere today.
[02:49:19.367 --> 02:49:20.387]  I meant to get to it.
[02:49:20.387 --> 02:49:23.488]  Guys, will you, I'll never be able to find it in the 10 stacks or so I have here.
[02:49:23.488 --> 02:49:24.169]  Will you research?
[02:49:27.253 --> 02:49:44.725]  Washington state representative doesn't refuse pat-down Just put it on screen so I'm giving the actual headline, but that should pull it up But but but it said that she they made her go in the scanner, and then they said now we're gonna pat you down So she submitted to that and see people keep telling me.
[02:49:44.725 --> 02:49:45.265]  Oh Alex.
[02:49:45.265 --> 02:49:51.550]  You know you just got to do the scanner the the microwave And then you won't have to do the pat-down no
[02:49:53.012 --> 02:49:54.573]  They like to give you a supposed out.
[02:49:54.573 --> 02:49:56.475]  First, it's only some airports have scanners.
[02:49:56.475 --> 02:49:59.777]  Then, do the scanner, you won't have the pat-down.
[02:49:59.777 --> 02:50:03.220]  Now they're saying all airports will have the scanners and they're phasing them in.
[02:50:03.220 --> 02:50:08.024]  And then you will have an additional pat-down after it.
[02:50:08.024 --> 02:50:12.148]  But they give you an out to feel like you're a rat so you can run away.
[02:50:12.148 --> 02:50:14.830]  And so it's always phased in.
[02:50:16.041 --> 02:50:19.744]  So it's just like, oh, this ISP doesn't let you go to Infowars.com.
[02:50:19.744 --> 02:50:22.727]  Or, oh, this wireless system doesn't let you.
[02:50:22.727 --> 02:50:24.268]  Or Google puts up a warning.
[02:50:24.268 --> 02:50:27.211]  Or Google delists Prison Planet from Google News.
[02:50:27.211 --> 02:50:29.513]  Or, see, they're just phasing it in.
[02:50:29.513 --> 02:50:30.434]  Phasing it in.
[02:50:30.434 --> 02:50:31.655]  Phasing it in.
[02:50:31.655 --> 02:50:32.996]  And they found the article.
[02:50:32.996 --> 02:50:33.737]  Throw it back up on screen.
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:38.801]  CISNA objects to airport search demand.
[02:50:38.801 --> 02:50:45.244]  And then they go on to say that she underwent the body scan as she was preparing to leave Seattle, Tacoma.
[02:50:45.244 --> 02:50:57.390]  Of course, she was leaving International Airport Sunday and was then required to undergo the pat-down by Transportation Safety Administration officials who are always caught stealing money and demanding sex from women.
[02:50:57.390 --> 02:50:58.491]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.641 --> 02:51:05.722]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.722 --> 02:51:10.224]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.224 --> 02:51:16.386]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.386 --> 02:51:18.807]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.807 --> 02:51:24.789]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.909 --> 02:51:28.313]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.313 --> 02:51:30.195]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.195 --> 02:51:32.378]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:32.378 --> 02:51:37.263]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.

[02:52:01.047 --> 02:52:03.428]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.428 --> 02:52:05.749]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.749 --> 02:52:08.950]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.950 --> 02:52:14.051]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.051 --> 02:52:18.253]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.573 --> 02:52:20.915]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.915 --> 02:52:23.798]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.798 --> 02:52:26.701]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.701 --> 02:52:34.308]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.645 --> 02:52:40.047]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.047 --> 02:52:42.887]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.887 --> 02:52:46.568]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.568 --> 02:52:47.649]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.649 --> 02:52:48.989]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:48.989 --> 02:52:50.490]  Invisible Empire.

[02:54:13.639 --> 02:54:18.145]  Okay, earlier I was reading the prices off the shopping cart across the room.
[02:54:18.145 --> 02:54:27.017]  And so I was reading them wrong for the V for Victory bumper stickers.
[02:54:27.017 --> 02:54:28.599]  Because I guess it's confusing on there.
[02:54:31.966 --> 02:54:37.897]  Okay, so it's 15 bumper stickers for $6.95, 50 bumper stickers for $14.95, 100 bumper stickers for $25.95.
[02:54:37.897 --> 02:54:38.678]  Okay, there you go.
[02:54:42.941 --> 02:54:46.543]  And that's basically at cost for us, these beautiful color bumper stickers.
[02:54:46.543 --> 02:54:51.686]  It'll last a long time, and we'll certainly get the word out to everybody out there with InfoWars.com on them.
[02:54:51.686 --> 02:54:53.007]  You are the resistance.
[02:54:53.007 --> 02:54:58.010]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:54:58.010 --> 02:55:04.955]  I would love to see this explode and see the bumper stickers all over the place in legal and lawful areas.
[02:55:04.955 --> 02:55:11.579]  Okay, I wanna get a few final calls here, but the point I was getting to before the break is this, and I wanna finish up in summation.
[02:55:12.810 --> 02:55:15.592]  There is a global move to start curtailing the Internet.
[02:55:15.592 --> 02:55:22.458]  And we would read what the Internet 2 Consortium of Governments and Industry were saying a decade ago and warn you about it.
[02:55:22.458 --> 02:55:23.979]  They've stated their plan.
[02:55:23.979 --> 02:55:26.401]  And it's death by a hundred cuts.
[02:55:26.401 --> 02:55:29.484]  It's phased in, death of the web as we know it.
[02:55:29.484 --> 02:55:31.426]  And phasing you into a new, unfree web.
[02:55:32.006 --> 02:55:36.532]  We've written countless articles about Internet2, Trojan Horse for takeover.
[02:55:36.532 --> 02:55:48.787]  You can just search Internet2, Infowars.com and pull up the ad nauseum articles that Kurt Nemo, Aaron Dyke, Steve Watson, Paul Watson and others have written on our sites with links to all their own statements.
[02:55:48.787 --> 02:55:49.567]  This is happening.
[02:55:49.567 --> 02:55:50.969]  They're putting InternetKillSwitch in.
[02:55:51.790 --> 02:55:55.493]  And, you know, we're on AM and FM stations, Global Shortwave Satellite.
[02:55:55.493 --> 02:56:05.081]  We've broken through with such an effect that even as they try to censor things, we'll be one of the last to go because it would be a major canary in the coal mine.
[02:56:05.081 --> 02:56:08.384]  But they are quietly trying to block people from getting to our sites.
[02:56:08.384 --> 02:56:20.674]  So, remember that and please help spread the word about PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com because if they weren't blocking us and curtailing us and putting roadblocks up, we would be reaching exponentially even more people.
[02:56:21.574 --> 02:56:24.236]  So please make Infowars.com your homepage.
[02:56:24.236 --> 02:56:25.977]  Please email it to your friends and family.
[02:56:25.977 --> 02:56:28.298]  Please tell folks about the radio broadcast.
[02:56:28.298 --> 02:56:35.583]  And please tell folks to tune in tomorrow when Lindsey Williams talks about the most important information he says that he's ever covered.
[02:56:35.583 --> 02:56:37.264]  And off-air I got some inkling of it.
[02:56:37.264 --> 02:56:43.768]  It is super powerful information about the globalist plan for worldwide instability.
[02:56:43.768 --> 02:56:46.970]  Now we got loaded phones here and I only have time to take one more.
[02:56:46.970 --> 02:56:47.951]  So who's up next, John?
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:51.461]  Hey Alex, it's Patience from Southern California.
[02:56:51.461 --> 02:56:52.422]  You posted my article on SACWIS.
[02:56:52.422 --> 02:56:56.664]  I wanted to thank you very, very much and to let you know that there's more coming where that came from.
[02:57:20.703 --> 02:57:22.745]  The state automated child welfare?
[02:57:22.745 --> 02:57:36.640]  Oh yeah, it actually says, I read and went to the documents that you linked to, they're actually creating a state license to have children, which two years ago they got beat in court, but California claimed that the state owns your children and tried to ban homeschooling.
[02:57:38.248 --> 02:57:39.289]  Oh, absolutely!
[02:57:39.289 --> 02:57:41.811]  And I mean, it sort of already is banned.
[02:57:41.811 --> 02:57:44.553]  And this is a throughout the United States of America thing.
[02:57:44.553 --> 02:57:46.034]  It's already up and running.
[02:57:46.034 --> 02:57:50.117]  It's just that all states are not interlinked and it's not up so good.
[02:57:50.117 --> 02:57:53.380]  It's just so expensive to run everybody through it.
[02:57:53.380 --> 02:58:01.886]  So now they're running people, but only those they think have children that might be easy to sell or get away for good from the parents.
[02:58:02.042 --> 02:58:03.784]  And there is a market on selling kids.
[02:58:03.784 --> 02:58:09.871]  The Georgia senator we had on was about to expose it in a week and then she got shot in the head a couple times.
[02:58:09.871 --> 02:58:11.733]  But you know what?
[02:58:11.733 --> 02:58:13.535]  Your article was powerful.
[02:58:13.535 --> 02:58:14.656]  I forget the headline.
[02:58:14.656 --> 02:58:16.859]  Give folks the headline so they can Google it and pull it up.
[02:58:18.809 --> 02:58:24.651]  A license to parent your own children, and you can go to Federal Jack and see it, or at Infowars.com and see it.
[02:58:24.651 --> 02:58:28.593]  That's right, and I also saw it on WeAreChange.org, that's where I originally saw it.
[02:58:28.593 --> 02:58:32.814]  Key information, a license to parent your children, Infowars.com.
[02:58:32.814 --> 02:58:34.155]  Okay, thank you so much.
[02:58:34.155 --> 02:58:35.615]  Great way to end the transmission.
[02:58:35.615 --> 02:58:38.496]  Lindsay Williams was on during the first hour, giving you a prelude.
[02:58:38.496 --> 02:58:40.077]  Retransmission starts now, tune into it.

[02:59:07.723 --> 02:59:11.406]  My name is Mario Cifaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
