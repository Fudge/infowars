[07:57.800 --> 08:06.920]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[08:06.920 --> 08:35.440]  what a monday so much is happening gold is exploding past fourteen hundred seven dollars silver up at
[08:35.440 --> 08:42.000]  thirty four plus dollars an ounce gold is only continuing to climb along with silver oil is
[08:42.000 --> 08:49.280]  exploding in prices the underlying situation is dollar devaluation so all commodities have been
[08:49.280 --> 08:55.840]  going up steadily but now you supercharge it with libya it looks like new market doffy will
[08:55.840 --> 09:02.840]  probably be ousted unless this is a western height but it doesn't look like it is because many areas of
[09:02.840 --> 09:09.800]  tripple including the parliament building are on fire and we have an incredible article about
[09:09.800 --> 09:17.960]  tony cartelucci up at info wars dot com title libya conquered in the dark i'm going to be going
[09:17.960 --> 09:25.520]  over also paul joseph watson has another report dealing with the fact that these these rebellions
[09:25.520 --> 09:32.960]  are real these are horrible swollen despots muammar cadafi dressed up in his military general
[09:32.960 --> 09:41.000]  clown suits his golden military outfit the prime example of government largesse and
[09:41.000 --> 09:47.920]  dictatorship on parade so you've got to be happy about what's happening at a certain level but
[09:47.920 --> 09:53.480]  the globalist are on record they're positioning themselves to try to control the outcome of
[09:53.480 --> 10:00.040]  these revolutions and some people as i get emails and see comments can't seem to understand
[10:00.040 --> 10:06.120]  what i'm saying even though this is not complex but they're engaged in one-dimensional thinking
[10:06.120 --> 10:12.600]  it's either is it good that dictators are being overthrown or is it bad not in a game of chess
[10:12.600 --> 10:21.400]  yes these are bad dictators muammar cadafi and of course hazy mubarak and others that are being
[10:21.400 --> 10:26.920]  toppled the last few weeks or on the verge of being toppled yes that's a good thing at one level
[10:26.920 --> 10:32.360]  and the people have a beef and it's good to see humanity striking back against corruption and
[10:32.360 --> 10:38.600]  tyrants but the question is what's going to come out of that and then we find out george soros the
[10:38.600 --> 10:43.640]  pentagon the state department are all running around bragging and saying that they're behind it
[10:43.640 --> 10:48.040]  now then you can't just believe them on the face of that you've got to then go research it and it's
[10:48.040 --> 10:55.400]  true they're all over the thing they sent alberidae in there a week before all the stuff started a
[10:55.400 --> 11:00.360]  month ago in egypt they're on record trying to push that now we don't know what the outcome will be
[11:00.360 --> 11:05.480]  it certainly might be better for the people and i i hope so but burning buildings infrastructure
[11:05.480 --> 11:11.560]  being destroyed in countries where folks are already very poor their oil flows slowing or even being
[11:11.560 --> 11:20.280]  shut off the tourism being basically completely ended in in in countries that were already spiraling
[11:20.280 --> 11:27.400]  downwards because of commodity increases because of dollar devaluation on the face of it if you
[11:27.400 --> 11:33.480]  look at the brakes it's going to be bad and if you look at egypt they've just put in the next row
[11:33.480 --> 11:40.120]  of military leaders in the junta who were just a little bit more pro-western in that they've
[11:40.120 --> 11:46.200]  promised that they're going to get behind attacks on iran but then you've also got the muslim brotherhood
[11:46.200 --> 11:51.880]  and others orbiting around uh saying that they want to take over and they've and you've got iran
[11:51.880 --> 11:57.880]  in the vacuum trying to come in so it's just a complete order out of chaos bedlam and if the
[11:57.880 --> 12:02.440]  globalists can get their minions in that'll get behind a war with iran that's good for them or
[12:02.440 --> 12:08.200]  if muslim extremists as they call them um get into control that's that's good too because then they
[12:08.200 --> 12:12.920]  could just expand wars against all of them and pump trillions of dollars of weapons systems
[12:12.920 --> 12:19.880]  into the area so anyway you slice it there's a narrow window that with all these countries in
[12:19.880 --> 12:25.800]  turmoil maybe something good's going to happen a blind hog does find acres broken clocks are
[12:25.800 --> 12:33.080]  right twice a day i mean i could take the battery out of my watch and lay it here on the counter
[12:33.080 --> 12:43.000]  and in 12 hours it will be 1112 again but does that mean my watch was working if i took the
[12:43.000 --> 12:50.440]  battery out of it and laid it here on the table and sometimes just randomly as it came back around
[12:50.440 --> 12:56.200]  i guess not randomly that it would be correct so we're here looking at what's happening i mean
[12:56.200 --> 13:01.640]  i'm sorry i read the books written by zebigniew brzezinski like the grand chess board and the others
[13:01.640 --> 13:07.400]  i read and listen to what henry kissinger's saying i've watched them for many years getting ready
[13:07.400 --> 13:12.600]  for what you see in the middle east we watched them two years ago try to overthrow iran uh with
[13:12.600 --> 13:20.760]  that green color revolution it's all the same branding it's it's it's staged now by stage the
[13:20.760 --> 13:29.400]  dominos were already set up the people were angry poor malnourished starving oil prices going up
[13:29.400 --> 13:35.880]  heating oil prices going up grain prices going up everything going up with people making just a few
[13:35.880 --> 13:41.160]  bucks a day it's a big problem but the globalists put the economic atmosphere the economic
[13:41.800 --> 13:46.680]  dominos in place and now they've just decided to knock them over at the time of their choosing
[13:46.680 --> 13:53.160]  and now i'm hearing the media blaming oh the fragile u.s recovery it could be overturned because
[13:53.160 --> 13:59.800]  of what's happening in the middle east when we've had guests and insiders on an economist i mean look
[14:00.440 --> 14:06.760]  by the way i want to get on the horn today uh and let's go ahead and call lindsay williams
[14:07.720 --> 14:16.520]  guys uh and see if he can come on today or tomorrow because uh he's um he's hitting about 95
[14:16.520 --> 14:23.240]  percent of the balls out of the park i mean his sources one of them now we know the name
[14:23.240 --> 14:27.560]  mind of the name years ago ken from former head of operations for atlantic richfield the other
[14:27.560 --> 14:32.680]  guys even more high powered former ceo of an even bigger oil company but i'm not at liberty to say
[14:32.680 --> 14:37.000]  that name i mean you know these old guys they're globalist but it doesn't mean they're a hundred
[14:37.000 --> 14:44.600]  percent right what they're getting from their inside sources um but i mean back in october
[14:44.600 --> 14:49.640]  lindsay said watch the middle east it's going to be in turmoil but that's going to be the
[14:49.640 --> 14:57.320]  distraction for china and russia watch them and right now uh i mean lindsay's not going out of
[14:57.320 --> 15:07.320]  the park it was lindsay who's six months before oil well back in 2008 six months i mean oil was
[15:07.320 --> 15:13.480]  it like 55 a barrel when he came on the show and he said it's going to go up to 150 within six months
[15:13.480 --> 15:19.480]  went up to 150 people laughed at him at the time nobody was predicting that nobody was saying that
[15:19.480 --> 15:24.520]  well he got it from ken from who just died of cancer around christmas but he still got the
[15:24.520 --> 15:30.360]  other sources well who is alive and well basically telling him the same stuff uh and then lindsay
[15:30.360 --> 15:38.120]  comes on when it's at 149 dollars a barrel brent crude and says now it's going to go down to close
[15:38.120 --> 15:45.080]  to 40 and it's going to start in two months two months later starts plunging goes down to below 40
[15:45.080 --> 15:51.320]  for a while then he comes on and says for two years enjoy yourselves oil's going to stay pretty
[15:51.320 --> 15:57.480]  much the same but then two years from now that was two years ago exactly it's blowing me away
[15:58.680 --> 16:03.160]  ken from i mean what do you expect the former head of atlantic richfield you think the guys playing
[16:03.160 --> 16:09.000]  tedley winks on the weekend no he's playing golf with the globalist he is a globalist now a deceased
[16:09.000 --> 16:23.480]  one god rest his soul but um the bottom line here is then he tells williams enjoy yourself for two
[16:23.480 --> 16:31.240]  years because after that it's going to go to 150 to 200 within six months to a year and uh here we
[16:31.240 --> 16:40.920]  are let me see october november december january here we are four months and change four months and
[16:40.920 --> 16:48.200]  a few days after williams dropped all this here dropped these bombs and oil is surging up to 100
[16:51.320 --> 16:55.880]  so what is going to happen we're going to continue to sit here and uh track it
[16:55.880 --> 17:08.120]  but obviously this is all extremely important and it's very momentous in fact here are the reports
[17:08.680 --> 17:15.720]  oil jumps to two-year high gold reaches 1400 and seven on midi stocks decline
[17:17.560 --> 17:21.800]  this article says 1400 it's gone up seven bucks since then in fact pull it up again let's see
[17:21.800 --> 17:28.520]  how much it's gone up in the last 15 minutes uh oil rose to two-year high and gold rallied for
[17:28.520 --> 17:36.520]  six days surpassing 1400 an ounce as tension in the middle east escalated stocks fell on the leading
[17:36.520 --> 17:43.720]  energy companies with operations in libya lower brent crude gained as much as 2.5 trading in new
[17:43.720 --> 17:49.800]  york gold climbed 0.9 percent and silver added 2.5 percent that is a massive move in silver
[17:49.800 --> 17:54.280]  i wish we could get max keiser on today too but he's jumping on an airplane to go to the middle
[17:54.280 --> 18:02.920]  east he's me reporting live for us from there what a wild man uh the st o x x uh europe 600 index
[18:02.920 --> 18:12.520]  declined and uh going over uh the oil prices again will continue uh to break that down
[18:12.520 --> 18:20.760]  on uh as it unfolds but it's at 93.49 but the futures in oil are showing it well above 100
[18:20.760 --> 18:27.800]  dollars so a big move there and we're going to see if ken from from the grave is correct
[18:27.800 --> 18:35.880]  and calls it again with precision and we'll see if the other uh former oil company ceo
[18:35.880 --> 18:44.760]  uh that we can't name can do that it's gone up a dollar plus in the last 15 minutes it's now at
[18:44.760 --> 19:04.920]  1408 dollars oh man uh do i want lindsay williams for an hour 30 minutes uh let's uh get lindsay
[19:04.920 --> 19:11.240]  williams on in the third hour full hour if he can do it and that's central obviously we got a

[24:20.760 --> 24:27.560]  engagement that he must attend he will be breaking what he says is the biggest news ever and quite
[24:27.560 --> 24:32.680]  frankly he's completely stunned when i'm talking to him on the phone uh talking to the other living
[24:32.680 --> 24:37.880]  big oil company executive who i know i know the name it's already been separately confirmed
[24:37.880 --> 24:44.360]  just like ken from was confirmed separately a decade ago by um by of course uh dr stanmont
[24:44.360 --> 24:49.560]  tief not just myself uh but uh talking to lindsay we're talking a little bit in this segment a
[24:49.560 --> 24:54.760]  little bit in the next is this segment so short tomorrow because he just it's providence that i
[24:54.760 --> 24:59.960]  just called him because he just got this information two days ago but i have to be briefed by him
[24:59.960 --> 25:05.640]  tonight before he'll even do this he wants to know if i want to go on air with this he's never
[25:05.640 --> 25:09.880]  asked me something like that before and am i correct to say lindsay you sound a little bit
[25:09.880 --> 25:16.040]  shaken up right now i am shaken up alexa because there's something that is happening right now
[25:16.040 --> 25:21.480]  that is so big that is so startling it's going to infect the entire world you think the middle east
[25:22.040 --> 25:26.440]  it definitely has something to do with the middle east it has to do with oil production it has to do
[25:26.440 --> 25:31.880]  with oil prices it has to do with the dollar and i was just given this information the other day
[25:31.880 --> 25:38.280]  and it goes along with what mr ken from told me before he died and alex this is so startling
[25:38.280 --> 25:42.760]  you'll be breaking something that the entire world is going to watch it take place over the next few
[25:42.760 --> 25:49.960]  months time absolutely and the this former major oil company ceo not ken from who just died but you
[25:49.960 --> 25:55.720]  know it's hidden in plain view folks and his energy non-crisis but we're not going to say the names
[25:55.720 --> 26:01.240]  here on air but this is confirmed to us and just as you said in october you said within six months
[26:01.240 --> 26:07.000]  oil's going to explode go up to 150 it's already moving there you said watch the middle east there's
[26:07.000 --> 26:13.880]  going to be turmoil but that's only the prelude to then china and the dollar and and you said two
[26:13.880 --> 26:19.000]  years ago from your sources that oil will stay the same until two years from now and then all
[26:19.000 --> 26:27.880]  bedlam all hades is going to break loose like a bat out of hades and now it's happening in 1976
[26:28.840 --> 26:35.000]  when the uh the garland discovery was made it brutal but i i guess you hear the breaking in my
[26:35.000 --> 26:42.200]  voice i just you know i'm so startled over what i've got here and when that took place i asked
[26:42.200 --> 26:47.400]  mr. prom at the time i said ken why don't you open up this field and give america all the
[26:47.400 --> 26:54.200]  oil it needs so we're not risk uh beholden to other countries in the world he said chaplain
[26:54.200 --> 26:59.960]  we are not going to open up the garland field and the article i like rescue until we can get
[26:59.960 --> 27:06.200]  the price of oil where we want it that was nearly 40 years ago you are seeing it happen right before
[27:06.200 --> 27:12.280]  your eyes right now this crisis in the middle east was created it was created by the elitist of the
[27:12.280 --> 27:18.520]  world i told you right here on your show four to five months ahead of time three to four months
[27:18.520 --> 27:22.760]  ahead of time that they were going to bring about a crisis in the middle east i did not realize
[27:22.760 --> 27:26.840]  how monstrosity yeah to be precise it was mid october it's four and a half months four months
[27:26.840 --> 27:34.040]  yeah yeah it took place exactly as mr. prom had told me and now of course they are going to continue
[27:34.040 --> 27:39.480]  to format that thing in the middle east until it takes the price of crude oil to two hundred dollars
[27:39.480 --> 27:47.240]  or more please hear this two hundred dollars or more last week in my area oil went up three to
[27:47.240 --> 27:53.880]  five cents per day you're going to see it go up so high that the american people are going to be
[27:53.880 --> 27:59.320]  in a horrible condition and remember what they said about gold they said it's all you can depend on
[27:59.320 --> 28:05.400]  its surge past fourteen hundred and eight dollars today silver surging almost to thirty five right
[28:05.400 --> 28:10.280]  now every bit of this is planned what happened in the middle east was planned for the purpose of
[28:10.280 --> 28:16.760]  taking the oil prices to where they want them to go but uh alex this thing goes so much deeper than
[28:16.760 --> 28:23.320]  that here's what they're going to do number one it affects the middle east you have not seen anything
[28:23.320 --> 28:29.560]  yet egypt was just a the beginning up was going to take place in the middle east the first domino
[28:30.680 --> 28:36.120]  is domino effect then secondly they are going to open up the oil fields that they have already

[34:04.920 --> 34:11.000]  information on something so catastrophic tomorrow that every person listening to your broadcast
[34:11.000 --> 34:16.760]  will know why things are taking place in the middle east as they are today why the dollar
[34:16.760 --> 34:23.240]  will collapse by the end of 2012 as mr prom told me before he passed away why they will be opening
[34:23.240 --> 34:30.600]  up certain oil fields in america because the price goes up to 200 a barrel why the price
[34:30.600 --> 34:35.320]  that the gas pump is going up to four to five dollars a gallon by the end of this year you
[34:35.320 --> 34:39.800]  will have answers to every one of these things as to what's going to happen to the economy of the
[34:39.800 --> 34:46.360]  united states of america and basically in a nutshell it started four to five months ago
[34:46.360 --> 34:49.720]  and they told me that they were going to have a conflict in the middle east
[34:49.720 --> 34:55.560]  that conflict is going to spread it is only starting right now at that point the price
[34:55.560 --> 35:01.480]  of crude oil will go to 200 a barrel where i told you two years ago that they said at a certain
[35:01.480 --> 35:06.520]  point here would start to go up to that point i did not know at the time why they were going
[35:06.520 --> 35:11.560]  to take it there i do now because of the other informants that gave me this information only
[35:11.560 --> 35:16.840]  a few days ago i have it sitting right here in front of me and what will happen basically is
[35:16.840 --> 35:21.880]  things will get so corrupt in the middle east that they will begin to open up certain oil fields
[35:21.880 --> 35:27.240]  in the united states of america and particularly the back of oil field the girl island field you
[35:27.240 --> 35:32.600]  must read in my book energy non-crisis which is not even in print anymore if any of you have it
[35:32.600 --> 35:36.760]  please read the chapter of girl island and blow your mind this will they'll open up the
[35:36.760 --> 35:42.520]  audit wildlife refuge they will have to begin to produce from our own soil but they're not going
[35:42.520 --> 35:47.960]  to let you have the gasoline at a reasonable price at the gas pump you will be paying five and six
[35:47.960 --> 35:53.640]  dollars a gallon there but the oil companies will become filthy rich because of what they're doing
[35:53.640 --> 35:59.240]  and every bit of this is a plan that was planned behind closed doors i only knew part of it years
[35:59.240 --> 36:05.800]  ago little by little i put the pieces together now every bit of it is evident and you can understand
[36:05.800 --> 36:10.920]  everything that they're doing ever you see how this all began in the middle east with each of
[36:10.920 --> 36:18.120]  just a few weeks ago incredible and and uh what time do you want me to call you tonight after the
[36:18.120 --> 36:22.360]  family event uh your time mountain what time do you want me to call because you said we need to
[36:22.360 --> 36:27.720]  have a meeting before you can break this information i need to brief you on this alex so
[36:27.720 --> 36:32.600]  that you'll understand the ramifications of it in the background of it and any time is fine with me
[36:33.800 --> 36:37.080]  okay but obviously after the show because you couldn't do the third hour today um
[36:38.600 --> 36:43.720]  yeah we we're talking about later on this afternoon probably after six or seven o'clock my time okay i
[36:43.720 --> 36:48.520]  will call you then it's give you plenty of time no families there how about how about seven o'clock

[36:54.360 --> 37:01.080]  called you this morning sir yes okay um well lindsay we appreciate you breaking this year and
[37:01.080 --> 37:05.800]  i guess it is providence that i had a i just said look everything lindsay saying is happening
[37:05.800 --> 37:10.200]  better call him and boom uh i guess uh you were telling my producer that you were getting ready
[37:10.200 --> 37:16.200]  to try to call us well no i would just sit back here stunned because of what i've just printed
[37:16.200 --> 37:21.000]  out this morning now because normally you call us all the pieces together over the past 40 years
[37:21.000 --> 37:27.000]  put these pieces together you understand everything they're doing right now what how the economy of
[37:27.000 --> 37:32.920]  america is going to be affected why the gas prices are going up what's going to happen to the dollar
[37:32.920 --> 37:39.480]  you know every bit of this because it's all a part of a of a big picture and when you see the whole
[37:39.480 --> 37:44.200]  picture you can understand it without it all you understand all you see is just a few things taking
[37:44.200 --> 37:51.240]  place in libya or in uh egypt or in salti arabia but then when you put all of the pieces together
[37:51.240 --> 37:56.280]  you you sit back in other horror that's what your leaders are doing and alex somehow they've got to
[37:56.280 --> 38:02.280]  be stopped so you're going to reveal the grand chess board tomorrow we know the globalist set up
[38:02.280 --> 38:07.080]  these dictators now they're getting ready to topple them to enter this chaos so they can then bring
[38:07.080 --> 38:13.160]  the solution which is order uh and people look at this in a one-dimensional way oh good they're
[38:13.160 --> 38:18.440]  overthrowing dictators but there's a larger ramification and uh i know i'll learn more
[38:18.440 --> 38:23.880]  tonight and then live tomorrow and i talk to you but uh basically uh you're seeing conflict in the
[38:23.880 --> 38:29.240]  middle east as you said four months ago uh i i i can hardly wait till seven o'clock tonight
[38:29.240 --> 38:34.520]  eight o'clock my time when i call you because uh lindsay i've never heard you sound like this on
[38:34.520 --> 38:39.320]  the phone you're you can you were almost speechless during the break when i was talking to you well
[38:39.320 --> 38:45.320]  i'm putting things together that the little pieces of it started back 40 years ago when mr
[38:45.320 --> 38:50.120]  prom told me those things and now of course the whole picture is here and the average person
[38:50.120 --> 38:54.760]  does not realize what's happening in the middle east and how every bit of it was planned behind
[38:54.760 --> 39:00.360]  closed doors and it relates to the dollar it relates to gas prices it relates grocery prices
[39:00.920 --> 39:06.040]  every bit of this fits together in a big picture now alex but for the first time we can see it
[39:06.040 --> 39:14.120]  incredible all right lindsay i'll call you at seven o'clock uh your time sharp and we'll call you at
[39:14.120 --> 39:18.440]  one o'clock tomorrow in the third hour uh to have you on we'll probably go into overdrive as well
[39:18.440 --> 39:22.840]  thank you for breaking this information here and you've certainly been proven plus i know
[39:22.840 --> 39:27.000]  your sources i know it's all real but some people are doubters how many times do your sources have
[39:27.000 --> 39:33.880]  to be right until people understand what's happening well they were right back in 1980
[39:33.880 --> 39:39.320]  when the price of crude oil went from 32 dollars a barrel to 10 and i told it ahead of time you
[39:39.320 --> 39:46.600]  weren't even existing back in those days and then when it went from 147 dollars a barrel to 32 dollars
[39:46.600 --> 39:52.280]  a barrel 33 dollars a barrel but then when the middle east broke out exactly as i've been told
[39:53.240 --> 39:59.800]  before mr prom died and every bit of this now of course folks i'm pleading with you to listen to
[39:59.800 --> 40:04.840]  what alex is saying and listen to this material so that you'll know everything that you're going
[40:04.840 --> 40:10.920]  to have to face between now the end of 2012 and by the way i don't have anything new on this i have
[40:10.920 --> 40:16.600]  not produced anything on it i'm not here to try to sell a product tomorrow i think that the american
[40:16.600 --> 40:21.640]  people have got to know what's going on so that they will understand the total picture of what the
[40:21.640 --> 40:27.000]  elite are doing right now alex well absolutely in fact your book was out of print for years and
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.240]  then the great folks at the prophecy club reached out to you and so you're trying to get the message
[40:31.240 --> 40:36.520]  out through that and people can get the whole breakdown on dvd and cd at prophecyclub.com i
[40:36.520 --> 40:41.400]  think it's good that you know that you're getting the information out in a vehicle to people and
[40:41.400 --> 40:45.960]  obviously you couldn't sit there at home sending out tens of thousands of free dvds and cds i'm
[40:45.960 --> 40:51.640]  glad you're doing it but i mean all of that you know regardless that you know the point is i wish
[40:51.640 --> 40:56.200]  tomorrow you had a new cd or something with this new information but hopefully by next week or so
[40:56.200 --> 41:02.440]  you can get with uh you know the folks at prophecy club and you know help you produce that because
[41:02.440 --> 41:08.840]  this is so incredibly important but but they'll hear it here first and i'm very very excited
[41:08.840 --> 41:14.760]  that you're going to be breaking this down for people tomorrow lindsay last question i know
[41:14.760 --> 41:19.480]  you've answered this before but for new listeners we're on a lot of new am and fm stations out there
[41:19.480 --> 41:24.120]  why do these top elitist mr from who died last year so we can now reveal his name
[41:24.120 --> 41:28.840]  former head of operations at lannick richfield your other mr x who you again talk about in your
[41:28.840 --> 41:36.920]  book uh came out three decades ago uh the energy crisis uh who is a former ceo of a big three
[41:36.920 --> 41:43.720]  oil company uh he's telling you the exact same thing and now more why do they tell you this and
[41:43.720 --> 41:49.720]  why you know when from called you a few years ago to threaten you to stop talking about how
[41:49.720 --> 41:55.080]  much oil was here in the us he didn't want that discussed but he did want other things discussed
[41:55.080 --> 42:01.320]  why are they doing this the elitist have a code of ethics they're not the same code that you and i
[42:01.320 --> 42:08.040]  have alex you and i are bible believers uh we believe in jesus christ we believe in honest
[42:08.040 --> 42:14.360]  indecency these people in their code of ethics do have one facet to it that is they must tell the
[42:14.360 --> 42:19.640]  world what they're going to do before they do it now some of the things that i'll be giving on tomorrow
[42:19.640 --> 42:26.840]  are not necessarily things that they're trying to give out right now but even though i think
[42:26.840 --> 42:34.200]  definitely my my present informant sent me this information just uh hours ago and this is what
[42:34.200 --> 42:39.320]  i'll be giving on the air tomorrow but i have to put the total picture together way back years ago
[42:39.880 --> 42:45.560]  when uh i'll tell the story tomorrow of how mr kim prom is actually fired from the lannick richfield
[42:45.560 --> 42:51.240]  one time nobody's ever heard this before except one or two broadcast anywhere in the world and it's
[42:51.240 --> 42:56.680]  in my book energy nine crisis then he wrote the chapter if gore island doesn't blow your mind this
[42:56.680 --> 43:03.560]  will this thing that's happening right now in the middle east it goes all the way back to pieces
[43:03.560 --> 43:09.000]  that were put together way back then well i read your book i mean i read your book 15 years ago
[43:09.560 --> 43:14.440]  you know after it already been out for over a decade when was it published it was published i
[43:14.440 --> 43:20.200]  think it's the year 1980 okay so so i read it 15 years after it had been published and you talked
[43:20.200 --> 43:25.320]  about the oil barons how they were going to set the Arabs up how they were getting them to invest
[43:25.320 --> 43:29.960]  in dollars and how later they were planning to basically shut them down and then develop the
[43:29.960 --> 43:35.000]  fields so so really and now we see it happening but but what you're saying is now they're getting
[43:35.000 --> 43:40.520]  ready to engage it and the ramifications of that globally with rebellion spreading worldwide
[43:40.520 --> 43:44.920]  am i guessing correctly where this is going you're guessing correctly you're seeing something
[43:44.920 --> 43:50.440]  take place right now it's been in the planning stages for probably 40 years and you're seeing the
[43:50.440 --> 43:55.560]  fourth film out of it right before your eyes but how it's going to affect the average american
[43:55.560 --> 44:00.920]  is the part that you must know so that you can help protect yourself in light of what's taking
[44:00.920 --> 44:04.840]  place well we know homeland security has been gearing up the whole time to suppress the american
[44:04.840 --> 44:09.320]  people while baiting and switching that it was for muslim extremists their own internal documents
[44:09.320 --> 44:14.360]  that law enforcement has sent us over and over again from different angles show that and so they
[44:14.360 --> 44:19.880]  they have prepared this and i was just in closing i was listening to local news radio
[44:20.760 --> 44:28.840]  this weekend a w o a i out of san antonio and they just had a newscast by the state of texas
[44:28.840 --> 44:35.320]  and the federal government were being interviewed about how they have a 50 year water plan that's
[44:35.320 --> 44:41.160]  always 50 years out uh for desalinization plants in the gulf of mexico and for all these other
[44:41.160 --> 44:48.760]  systems and when you actually study the power grid or or FCC electronics regulations or everything
[44:48.760 --> 44:54.040]  it's in 25 and 50 year plans brazinski writes about this and then people look at us and laugh
[44:54.040 --> 44:58.520]  at us and say they're not working in 50 year plans they have this lie that wall streets
[44:58.520 --> 45:04.040]  only on a quarterly basis they keep the public thinking quarter by quarter you know uh every
[45:04.040 --> 45:09.800]  three months but but no the globalist the british empire model not that the british run it but again
[45:09.800 --> 45:17.000]  we've adopted that the globalist have is in 25 and 50 year increments and it's hidden all over the
[45:17.000 --> 45:22.200]  place that this is their strategic plan and that's why it's so hard to beat because they are following
[45:22.200 --> 45:29.240]  a blueprint when this information was given to me just hours ago the individual who sent it to me
[45:29.240 --> 45:36.840]  who is you know who he is alex and mr uh dot stan monty talked to him personally before he
[45:36.840 --> 45:42.360]  long no longer was willing to be talked to uh he said right across the top of the piece of paper
[45:42.360 --> 45:50.200]  in big letters he said you better sit down uh and and this is this is a man who knows the whole
[45:50.200 --> 45:58.040]  total plan of what's taking place this affects every asset of our lives because of what they're
[45:58.040 --> 46:03.320]  doing and what it's going to do to america you need to know about right now so that you'll know
[46:03.320 --> 46:07.880]  how to make plans wow lindsay i hear a completely different tone i mean you've always had one of
[46:07.880 --> 46:19.000]  concern but now i hear uh cold focus i mean like you've been braced by uh almost uh like i hear
[46:19.000 --> 46:24.760]  resignation in your voice well alex i don't know how to say this you know i was brought up in a
[46:24.760 --> 46:31.960]  christian home and i was a minister of the gospel the minister of gospel for 50 years and i've always
[46:31.960 --> 46:37.960]  been taught that the right thing to do was honesty and whenever i see taking place what's taking
[46:37.960 --> 46:46.120]  place right now i can't help but be stirred and moved because this plan is so catastrophic it deals
[46:46.120 --> 46:51.960]  with everything from uh from hundreds of people being killed in the middle east i mean the life
[46:51.960 --> 46:57.000]  means nothing to them there are hundreds of people maybe thousands of people that are going to die in
[46:57.000 --> 47:02.680]  the middle east in order to bring about the plan that the alias won't be brought about secondly
[47:02.680 --> 47:07.480]  it's going to be the destruction of the american dollar because can you imagine what'll happen
[47:07.480 --> 47:13.720]  whenever the truck a trucker big tractor trailer rig operator was here in my home the other day
[47:13.720 --> 47:19.640]  and he said chaplain he said i get five miles to the gallon on my big rig on diesel fuel
[47:19.640 --> 47:24.680]  diesel fuel i saw it for the first time four dollars a gallon on yesterday when i was driving
[47:24.680 --> 47:29.960]  through town at a local service station here in our area can you imagine what's going to happen to
[47:29.960 --> 47:35.560]  grocery prices this fits in perfectly with what was told to me the grocery store shelves will
[47:35.560 --> 47:40.840]  be full but you won't be able to buy it folks all of this goes together in that total plan and the
[47:40.840 --> 47:47.000]  globalists are going to put oil go to two hundred dollars a barrel only for the sole purpose of
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.680]  them being able to bring all oil fields that they have known was there for years and they finally
[47:52.680 --> 47:57.880]  are going to produce them because they can get built their rich off of it and that's and that's
[47:57.880 --> 48:02.760]  only one layer by bankrupting the people this is the same model the imf and world bank publicly
[48:02.760 --> 48:07.960]  used in the third world that will then cause political rebellion and obama and others will
[48:07.960 --> 48:14.680]  take the giant welfare class point them as a weapon at the middle class telling it telling the poor
[48:14.680 --> 48:20.680]  loot them by voting for socialism then they'll take the middle class's money the final engine of
[48:20.680 --> 48:26.920]  independence and give some of it as chicken feed to the poor the rest of the offshore globalist
[48:26.920 --> 48:32.040]  pressure from above and below and we're going to see the new world order try to orchestrate a
[48:32.040 --> 48:37.720]  revolution in this country but a revolution to destroy the republic a false revolution is that
[48:37.720 --> 48:44.360]  what he was telling you basically in a nutshell alex that's exactly right and everything that
[48:44.360 --> 48:51.160]  your listening audience has heard you say folks please believe what alex jones is saying because
[48:51.160 --> 48:56.840]  you will see that this fits perfectly into the plan that i will try to tell you about on tomorrow

[49:03.400 --> 49:12.200]  feel perfectly in and every bit of it is a total plan of their new world order for america and the
[49:12.200 --> 49:16.200]  world incredible lensing i'm going to let you go i appreciate the time get back to your family i'll
[49:16.200 --> 49:22.680]  call you at seven mountain eight central but again i'm no rocket scientist we've seen the globalist
[49:22.680 --> 49:27.800]  do this in third world countries hundreds of times there's over a hundred and seventy third
[49:27.800 --> 49:31.800]  world nations for folks that don't know and sometimes they do it every year in the countries
[49:31.800 --> 49:38.840]  it's a cycle and so of course i know what they're going to do without even talking to mr l or you
[49:38.840 --> 49:45.240]  of the deceased mr x because we know what their program is but now they're going for the whole
[49:45.240 --> 49:51.080]  world at once is that basically what you're saying lindsay yes alex and i would urge every listener

[54:32.600 --> 54:44.200]  frightening if we can get the word out about the globalist plan as people then see it unfold
[54:44.200 --> 54:49.320]  we probably can't stop what's happening but as ron paul and others have said to understand history
[54:49.320 --> 54:56.040]  we can strategically get the info out so that they in the next phase can be defeated because
[54:56.040 --> 55:00.600]  people will know who the globalist are and that they engineered this and then they won't be able
[55:00.600 --> 55:06.920]  to use the bedlam and the breakdown of society as a way to roll in their complete world government
[55:06.920 --> 55:11.720]  but because they control the currency and the energy they've got two of the main strategic
[55:11.720 --> 55:18.600]  choke points covered but we have info war and you think people are waking up now you wait till we
[55:18.600 --> 55:24.360]  go into full depression oh people are really going to be listening and everything we've said for years
[55:24.360 --> 55:28.760]  is going to be gold it's going to be evergreen i want to bring ted anderson up and then we're
[55:28.760 --> 55:31.560]  going to open the phones up in the next hour and get into all that's happening in the middle east
[55:31.560 --> 55:37.320]  and worldwide dad we told folks people look at a golden silver graph on a month-to-month basis
[55:37.320 --> 55:43.000]  and they go my gosh gold went down 50 bucks silver went down two dollars it's not a good deal what's
[55:43.000 --> 55:49.000]  alex telling us look at the 11-year graph it's going straight up both of them this is what happens
[55:49.000 --> 55:55.960]  when they devalue currencies it's a law of economics alex i can tell you this right now every time
[55:55.960 --> 56:01.640]  gold and silver backs off like this and the people get scared it's like you know i wish they had the
[56:01.640 --> 56:06.760]  you rush in and start buying it up greedily because you understand and then you sell it for lower prices
[56:06.760 --> 56:11.560]  once it goes up and that's how you're starting to dominate the market with good old you know free
[56:11.560 --> 56:16.840]  market economics ted yeah that's right i can tell you right now if you see gold and silver going down
[56:16.840 --> 56:21.240]  and you know that the problems that we have that are driving gold and silver prices haven't been
[56:21.240 --> 56:27.400]  solved yet buy by all means when silver is down when gold is down buy all you can because you know

[57:00.360 --> 57:07.480]  great uh plan you sell it at the old price when it goes up so you you basically save them from
[57:07.480 --> 57:12.280]  their folly briefly tell folks the gold and silver offers you got today that you know these are prices

[1:00:56.360 --> 1:01:01.960]  but the globalist can just sit back they they know sociological factors that are involved
[1:01:02.600 --> 1:01:07.240]  in the prospectus written by the imf and world bank known as the imf riot that this stuff will
[1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:11.240]  burn itself out within six months and then everything's basically in shambles and then
[1:01:11.240 --> 1:01:15.800]  they can come in and really take control of those countries even more and during the interim when oil
[1:01:15.800 --> 1:01:22.760]  oil gets disrupted and pipelines getting blown up in egypt and shut down and in libya

[1:02:29.240 --> 1:02:35.400]  a sick way uh what do they call it from world war two where the pilots would be strafing a train
[1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:45.240]  and or or armored column and they would get target uh psychosis and basically fly right into it i mean
[1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:51.160]  i'm just sitting here watching this thing start to burn and i know where it's going and i can feel
[1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:56.040]  it ted i mean you can feel the start this is the world government trying to rise up man i tell you
[1:02:56.040 --> 1:03:01.880]  what it sure is and i i just hope that people recognize that and fight like holy you know what
[1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:07.880]  i want to stop it and you know it this is going to destroy it's just going to literally eat up
[1:03:07.880 --> 1:03:13.240]  and destroy the value of the currency and unfortunately anybody that saved their money or
[1:03:13.240 --> 1:03:19.560]  worked or has a pension or anything that has to do with the united states dollar god help them
[1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:23.880]  because you know what people you know the especially the retirees and the people that are
[1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:27.720]  working are going to be working but ted you know what's else is scary do you know how prominent
[1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:31.720]  this is going to make ron paul and myself and others that's why they position back that we
[1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:37.480]  have been right about all this i do not want the power that we are about to get because we have
[1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:43.800]  told everybody i mean i don't just feel the evil rising i feel the 1776 rising and i'm like i do
[1:03:43.800 --> 1:03:49.480]  not want this power i mean i understand we're entering danger here ted we have positioned
[1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:58.120]  ourselves as the main opposition and it sure has what i mean what alex jones i never imagined this
[1:03:58.120 --> 1:04:05.000]  would mean crazy i mean it really is it's amazing what's happened here but you know what it's funny
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:09.400]  when you have when you have liberty burning in your belly and you know what the truth is
[1:04:09.400 --> 1:04:13.800]  and you end up spending your life creating videos that actually move people the right
[1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:18.600]  direction so they can recognize what's going on and all of a sudden now we're in the position
[1:04:18.600 --> 1:04:22.920]  where all this is coming down well guess what the people are going to look to you for answers
[1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:27.960]  and the people that are trying to pull the strings and the puppet masters they're looking at alex
[1:04:27.960 --> 1:04:34.040]  jones and they're going oh man we got to get this guy you know and and i just all i can see is that
[1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:39.960]  you know what that's that we're doing the right thing and that's why it's so popular and it's
[1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:44.600]  going to get more popular and that's why i think it's so important that people take advantage i mean
[1:04:44.600 --> 1:04:49.320]  look if you want liberty get alex's videos well look look at how the truth sets you free and people

[1:07:00.040 --> 1:07:04.600]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:07:04.600 --> 1:07:08.920]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:07:08.920 --> 1:07:13.960]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[1:07:13.960 --> 1:07:19.560]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[1:07:19.560 --> 1:07:24.680]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:29.960]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[1:07:29.960 --> 1:07:34.440]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[1:07:34.440 --> 1:07:39.800]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:43.640]  and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[1:07:43.640 --> 1:07:49.960]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:55.880]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com

[1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:07.960]  you take a model man
[1:08:12.680 --> 1:08:18.040]  and put them in control watch them become a god
[1:08:19.560 --> 1:08:21.800]  watch him become a god
[1:08:21.800 --> 1:08:28.440]  watch people's hands a roll
[1:08:31.480 --> 1:08:34.840]  roll roll
[1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:46.280]  just like the pine viper just like the pine viper
[1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:57.160]  let grass grow the trees dance like a marionette swaying to the symphony of destruction
[1:09:01.160 --> 1:09:09.880]  acting like a robot it's metal brain carots it's metal brain carots
[1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:19.720]  you try to take us before the head explodes
[1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:32.120]  we are seeing a globalist launched worldwide destabilization campaign planned for close to
[1:09:32.120 --> 1:09:42.120]  five decades as the rats are being turned loose so the population will beg the pine viper
[1:09:44.120 --> 1:09:48.680]  and the point i was making back during the last break about the liberty movement
[1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:53.320]  all of you that have warned your friends and family have been laughed at the people that
[1:09:53.320 --> 1:09:58.280]  laughed at ron paul three years ago the people that pilloried this broadcast and attacked us from
[1:09:58.280 --> 1:10:05.400]  every level when i talk about don't give me this power it it is daunting to know that we are one
[1:10:05.400 --> 1:10:11.160]  of the leading salvos one of the leading spears fighting the globalists that are aware of their
[1:10:11.160 --> 1:10:17.400]  program we know the attack profile we've been proven right so many times that all of us who
[1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:25.080]  know the score have incredible responsibilities i do you do the genesis network everyone does
[1:10:25.080 --> 1:10:31.400]  other talk show host listing right now this is so real this is so big what's happening in the world
[1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:42.760]  right now and they have begun the dominoes to fall for global destabilization to create a crisis so
[1:10:42.760 --> 1:10:49.800]  horrible that the public will beg for world government and i do not like the fact that i'm
[1:10:49.800 --> 1:10:56.600]  so prominent i can feel the danger increasing but it's a responsibility and i passed the point of
[1:10:56.600 --> 1:11:01.880]  no return a long time ago and so did you because even if you try to serve this system folks it's
[1:11:01.880 --> 1:11:06.040]  going to destroy you so once you realize you don't really have a choice you've got to fight it
[1:11:06.040 --> 1:11:10.920]  with every ounce of energy with every bit of intellect with your heart with your soul with
[1:11:10.920 --> 1:11:17.240]  everything i just pray that god's lead god and direct us and that we repent for the things
[1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:22.280]  we've done the decadence the globalists have sold us corruption to make us weak to make us rotten
[1:11:22.280 --> 1:11:28.360]  inside none of us are perfect but we need to get our hearts right with god we need to all of us get
[1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:33.160]  our hearts right with god because the crises that we're already in the crises that are that are
[1:11:33.160 --> 1:11:40.280]  expanding and and getting worse by the day are going to be used to try to usher in planetary
[1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:47.480]  despotism planetary enslavement and i want people listening to realize the incredible
[1:11:47.480 --> 1:11:51.480]  historical crossroads that we all stand at the fulcrum of
[1:11:54.760 --> 1:12:00.600]  what we do now will echo throughout human civilization don't be a spectator be involved
[1:12:00.600 --> 1:12:04.520]  people aren't going to laugh at you now when you warn them many people who have been laughed at in
[1:12:04.520 --> 1:12:09.080]  the past just average folks out there tell me their friends their family are listening now and that is
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:16.440]  so positive i am risking my life my name my treasure everything because corruption must
[1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:23.400]  be faced it must be dealt with or it will grow like a cancer out of control let's put that photo
[1:12:23.400 --> 1:12:27.640]  of Muammar Gaddafi up on screen if we can find it again for Prison Planet TV viewers if not just
[1:12:27.640 --> 1:12:33.160]  search the term Muammar Gaddafi in military uniform in his ridiculous gold clown suit
[1:12:33.160 --> 1:12:40.520]  and so if you look at this in a one-dimensional view it's like oh great a thugs being thrown out
[1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:45.480]  but when you understand oh good ozzymu bar has been thrown out but then you see the very same
[1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:51.400]  military people behind him step in there will be no freedom this is purely to drive up oil prices
[1:12:51.400 --> 1:12:57.160]  to try to put people the media can call more extreme into power and to try to have
[1:12:57.160 --> 1:13:03.480]  the buffer zone of the middle east basically turned into a lake of carnage
[1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:13.400]  let me cover the news and i'm going to your phone calls hundreds protest in iraq tv station
[1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:19.880]  torched this out of the toronto sun hundreds of protesters inspired by unrest around the
[1:13:19.880 --> 1:13:28.440]  Arab world took to the streets of the northern iraqi city on sunday and at least 48 people were
[1:13:28.440 --> 1:13:33.880]  injured a police official said security forces fired in the air when demonstrators chanted against
[1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:39.560]  corruption tried to approach the headquarters of the Kurdistan democratic party where clashes on
[1:13:39.560 --> 1:13:44.920]  thursday killed two people and wounded dozens and it just goes on from there tv station's been torched
[1:13:44.920 --> 1:13:54.840]  um dealing with the situation in uh libya it is being reported that military aircraft
[1:13:54.840 --> 1:14:01.960]  fire at libyan crowds and al jazeera's reporting royers is also reporting that and you know these
[1:14:01.960 --> 1:14:06.200]  these are armed people they've gotten arms either by taking them from security forces
[1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:10.280]  or they've been pre armed they've taken tanks they were trying to take over a military base
[1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:15.560]  when this happened if you can believe any of this that does make them a military target but uh
[1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:19.560]  and if you don't think our military's been trained to be trying to take over a military base to
[1:14:19.560 --> 1:14:23.800]  kill your daughter in a hammer you got nothing coming they're openly training the military it's
[1:14:23.800 --> 1:14:28.440]  even in the army times going back two and a half years ago and since then many times that they are
[1:14:28.440 --> 1:14:32.920]  quote preparing our military to quote pull triggers on the american people in fact i read from an army
[1:14:32.920 --> 1:14:39.080]  report that was put out last year army strategic shock reports that strips may be needed to quell
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:45.480]  us civil unrest purposeful domestic resistance would require military to rapidly determine
[1:14:46.040 --> 1:14:50.040]  the parameters defining the legitimate use of military force inside the united states
[1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:58.440]  who reported that in december 16 2008 see they've all geared up for this i mean folks i was a
[1:14:58.440 --> 1:15:04.120]  mainline kind of libertarian style ron paul guy i didn't get into bohemian grove and skull and bones
[1:15:04.120 --> 1:15:09.640]  and you know stuff like that i was just you know a mainline libertarian and i got on talk radio and
[1:15:10.280 --> 1:15:17.480]  tv 95 radio 96 and people would send me documents articles uh i'd see an article about the police
[1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:22.120]  chief being dealt the force trying to pay him off and the sandtonia express news i'd call the chief
[1:15:22.120 --> 1:15:27.400]  up hey i'm uh got a local radio show and a tv show and awesome i'd come interview you alex
[1:15:27.400 --> 1:15:31.960]  shone's interviews ally philipus it's in my film police day 2000 show up at his office have an hour
[1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:36.760]  long meeting and he says dealt the force trying to buy off the town in a secret takeover operation
[1:15:36.760 --> 1:15:43.080]  that interviewed uh thomas sanchez emergency manager vietnam veteran former army intelligence
[1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:48.360]  so he knows what he was seeing he was approached he came on my radio show he was approached in
[1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:58.360]  kingsville uh down in south texas basically for martial law takeover drill and i'd go on air and
[1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:06.440]  talk about it i mean they've been preparing for at least 15 years at a breakneck speed for the total
[1:16:06.440 --> 1:16:12.040]  collapse of the us and in all the training it's stock market crash dollar devaluation and then
[1:16:12.040 --> 1:16:18.200]  the very banks that run america on record have done all of this i mean again that's what's so
[1:16:18.200 --> 1:16:24.040]  frustrating for me this is a hundred percent this is a hundred percent this is not my opinion
[1:16:24.040 --> 1:16:31.960]  we told you all this was coming i have been dreading this but now it is at a certain level
[1:16:31.960 --> 1:16:36.920]  i'm almost like well at least you know we were we were right but that's kind of sicky sweet
[1:16:37.560 --> 1:16:41.880]  leaves a bad taste in your mouth but in a way it's vindication but then it's
[1:16:43.960 --> 1:16:50.280]  it's just confirmation and it's i use the analogy of being 11 12 years old and getting off the school
[1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:58.440]  bus and three or four it happened a bunch of times you know 14 15 16 17 year olds get around you
[1:16:59.080 --> 1:17:03.800]  and beat you up and punch you in the nose and uh you know you try to fight back a little
[1:17:04.600 --> 1:17:12.360]  but then it made me strong you know after it happened dozens of times um to the point by
[1:17:12.360 --> 1:17:17.080]  the time i was about 13 well now when the 17 year old came up i just learned to savagely attack him
[1:17:17.080 --> 1:17:20.520]  and start punching him in the nose and doing whatever i can and headbutting him and just
[1:17:20.520 --> 1:17:24.920]  turning it loose you know it's almost like you're scared when the bully's walking up but once they
[1:17:24.920 --> 1:17:31.080]  go ahead and swing once they go once once you felt them hit you it's like boom it's on i'm not scared
[1:17:31.080 --> 1:17:37.880]  anymore i'm going to open a can of you know what on you and that which does not kill us only makes
[1:17:37.880 --> 1:17:42.200]  us stronger as nichy said i don't agree with a lot of what nichy said but i certainly agree with that
[1:17:42.200 --> 1:17:52.760]  uh the german philosopher but i um oh it's it's so many emotions right now because this is just
[1:17:52.760 --> 1:17:59.880]  another complete total verification of everything we've said and we know the globalist planned
[1:17:59.880 --> 1:18:11.640]  all this and we know what it leads to next and it's amazing i mean they plan to shut the economy
[1:18:11.640 --> 1:18:20.440]  off here they plan to have cascading demonstrations and riots in the next few years but again just
[1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:25.240]  acclimating us to having tsa on every street corner telescreens and walmart telling us spy
[1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:31.400]  on each other i mean it's all it's 1984 but at least we've got radio networks at least we've
[1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:35.080]  got the web for now though they're all over the news internet kill switch gets makeover
[1:18:35.080 --> 1:18:42.040]  cnet news they're not setting up an internet kill switch which by the way is already in
[1:18:42.040 --> 1:18:45.640]  place they're just now announcing it and they want legal backing through congress on it
[1:18:45.640 --> 1:18:50.920]  they're not doing all this because they're going to play games and there probably is coming a time
[1:18:50.920 --> 1:18:56.040]  if we don't put out the full effort and resist them because this is a fight this is an ongoing brawl
[1:18:56.040 --> 1:19:01.880]  right now between unorganized free humanity who's got the truth a powerful weapon and the lying
[1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:09.880]  globalist who have all the resources and so history is happening right now and this this is it
[1:19:11.880 --> 1:19:21.480]  and i don't know what to say to you i mean it it's all there it's all on record and it's all
[1:19:21.480 --> 1:19:30.440]  hiding in plain view and what we do now is going to count forever what globalists talk about
[1:19:30.440 --> 1:19:35.480]  societies being frozen and then they will unfreeze things with revolution either cultural or physical
[1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:42.840]  or a mix to try to re-engineer quick change for them but during this liquid phase we can
[1:19:42.840 --> 1:19:49.800]  rest control of the levers of power at every level and block these people because the globalists are
[1:19:49.800 --> 1:19:57.560]  very strong in their rampant drive but they also are very weak during that period it's a paradox

[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:21.320]  to make sure he falls but it probably is who knows libya colonel cadapi fleased to venezuela as
[1:24:21.320 --> 1:24:28.760]  cities fall to protesters to admit that the cities are falling uh and uh white house and diplomatic
[1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:34.040]  sources say this is not from news media this is from quote credible inside sources uh let's go to
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:40.440]  some of your phone calls right now ray in indiana you're on the air welcome uh thank you alec it's
[1:24:40.440 --> 1:24:47.640]  pleasure and honor to speak to you um the question i had for you sir was regarding i know that you've
[1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:55.240]  been talking about that china is obviously buying a lot of gold and i was just curious as to what is
[1:24:55.240 --> 1:25:00.760]  your take on they're gonna hold all this gold does that mean that they could potentially dump it on
[1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:07.400]  the market and do something with other economies if they were to devalue gold well there's ratios
[1:25:07.400 --> 1:25:13.800]  and i went over this actually last week uh you know breaking down the numbers gold demand is now
[1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:19.240]  way above production the chinese are now one of the biggest holders but also the government is
[1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:23.000]  the biggest producer now they've they've bought mines and developed mines all over the world
[1:25:24.360 --> 1:25:30.520]  and so there's not enough gold for them they could dump it and drive it down for a period
[1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:38.120]  but the underpinning issue is not just dollar devaluation every other major currency including
[1:25:38.120 --> 1:25:47.320]  the chinese currency uh is being devalued uh and so uh i think i could ask mark fauber about that
[1:25:47.320 --> 1:25:53.000]  coming up uh about what he sees with the he's a real expert on china their capacity to do that
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:26:00.200]  in fact i'll ask him that first uh when he joins us coming up here great i appreciate that sir and
[1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:03.960]  i hope you have a good day and keep up the good work thank you ray in fact let me write a note
[1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:10.680]  now so i don't i had a pen here guys just write me a note so i don't forget and ask well fauber's
[1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:14.520]  come up in a minute i'll be able to remember that uh it's a good question let's go ahead and talk to
[1:26:14.520 --> 1:26:21.720]  patrick and kansas patrick you're on the year hey alex hey buddy um i mean i guess uh after
[1:26:21.720 --> 1:26:26.200]  hearing what you said about the oil today this question kind of kind of comes to be insignificant
[1:26:26.840 --> 1:26:32.760]  but uh as far as the middle east and uh how how these uh riots are starting is mainly the students
[1:26:32.760 --> 1:26:38.680]  right so you've got unemployed students that are there and uh and you know that's who they assemble
[1:26:38.680 --> 1:26:42.440]  well here in the united states our students are going through the student loan debt crisis
[1:26:43.320 --> 1:26:48.200]  and i was kind of saying how is that going to play into the riots that will soon happen here in
[1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:53.880]  america where you've got all the young entrepreneurs all the educated people that have no whatsoever
[1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:58.920]  well no i mean i mean that's a no brainer that's what all of our economic experts and historians
[1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:05.480]  are saying what you've already seen in multiple states in the last year riots at campuses over
[1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:10.680]  increased tuition i mean education just gets more and more expensive and then most people who get a
[1:27:10.680 --> 1:27:18.360]  degree end up working at the grocery store um and so absolutely i mean look globalism was about
[1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:24.200]  destroying economies and consolidating power in the globalist hands a quote post-industrial world
[1:27:24.200 --> 1:27:31.480]  that's the stated goal of the charlatans like al gore and uh john p holdren and david rockefeller
[1:27:31.480 --> 1:27:37.240]  and all these scumbags and and and so it's about positioning you so you're not independent and so
[1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:41.800]  yeah no it's just going to get more insane from here on out i mean the the fight's been going on
[1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:49.640]  but now it's on i mean you know we we are deep into this right now i mean this is a death struggle
[1:27:49.640 --> 1:27:58.440]  versus liberty and tyranny i mean it is tectonic it is colossal it is unparalleled the the period
[1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:06.200]  we're entering it's got war written all over it it's just insane i mean i mean just the entire
[1:28:06.200 --> 1:28:13.480]  geopolitical hologram is is is going into flames and like what what we talk about is like strategies
[1:28:13.480 --> 1:28:18.920]  that secure yourself well if you're just out of college you're you know professional age
[1:28:18.920 --> 1:28:22.840]  and you haven't had the chance to secure yourself or anything you've got these student loans
[1:28:22.840 --> 1:28:27.000]  you're pretty much screwed in the system unless you get a homeland security job
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:31.960]  now the biggest growth sector prisons and homeland security and so you'll have millions more people
[1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:38.600]  every year going on government payroll uh kind of the tsa model of 15 bucks an hour with petty
[1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:44.760]  power trips uh sucking off whoever else has got money who isn't a globalist can you imagine i mean
[1:28:44.760 --> 1:28:51.000]  we know what happens in civilization during a period like this we understand exactly how this
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:55.240]  is how they're going to play it we know their moves it's like we're playing a chess champion
[1:28:55.800 --> 1:29:00.680]  whose moves are well known and we're there but the rest of the public doesn't even know we're playing
[1:29:00.680 --> 1:29:05.320]  chess and and i'm up here going here's history here's the template here's their own admissions
[1:29:05.320 --> 1:29:11.960]  here's their own battle plans something this big a lot of it's secret when they're going to pull
[1:29:11.960 --> 1:29:18.440]  this or that but the entire moves that they're planning and have already engaged are public and
[1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:27.320]  so they've laid out their blueprints this continuity of agenda everywhere and so exactly when certain
[1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:31.800]  things are going to trip we don't know but we know the general move it's like we're following
[1:29:31.800 --> 1:29:35.320]  a roadmap here we've got their blueprint we've got it out here we know how they're going to
[1:29:35.320 --> 1:29:38.280]  build it and what they're going to do i mean do we know when a truck's going to pull up and put
[1:29:38.280 --> 1:29:43.080]  the plumbing in no but we can get a good idea well now it's time to put the plumbing in you
[1:29:43.080 --> 1:29:46.840]  know now they put the drywall in you know now they're putting the carpet in they're putting
[1:29:46.840 --> 1:29:53.240]  the fixtures in i mean we just we're just watching it fall like dominos we're on the march the empires
[1:29:53.240 --> 1:30:03.560]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network a very wealthy u.s citizen is predicting that in
[1:30:03.560 --> 1:30:09.560]  2011 we will witness the most important day in america in more than 50 years he says it will

[1:33:38.840 --> 1:33:45.720]  with a phd in economics magna cum laude and uh he joins us from thailand today a real expert on
[1:33:45.720 --> 1:33:51.080]  world markets especially what's happening in asia and i've got so much to discuss with him on oil
[1:33:51.080 --> 1:33:55.480]  gold uh what's going to happen with the chinese could they dump a bunch of gold on the market
[1:33:55.480 --> 1:33:59.560]  where he sees everything going uh we have to say his forecasting is among some of the most
[1:33:59.560 --> 1:34:05.400]  accurate in the world again gloom boom doom dot com mr faber good to have you here with us
[1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:11.560]  it's my pleasure okay well you've got the floor from thailand what in the world is going on right
[1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:20.520]  now on this planet what do you see happening well basically we have to go back to the 1970s
[1:34:20.520 --> 1:34:28.360]  to fully understand what happened in the 1970s they printed money in the u.s and commodity prices
[1:34:28.360 --> 1:34:37.480]  went ballistic and they overshot on the upside because of the money printing and after 1980
[1:34:38.360 --> 1:34:46.840]  they then declined because as they went up too much supplies came into the market so all commodities
[1:34:46.840 --> 1:34:57.640]  went down until 1998 during the decline in commodity prices no new mining was undertaken
[1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:07.720]  no exploration took place no new oil fields were looked for because at prices went down
[1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:16.680]  there was no economic reasons to look for new oil but then after 1998 commodity prices
[1:35:16.680 --> 1:35:26.120]  started to rise and because of the combination of the opening of china the incremental demand
[1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:33.400]  from china and also increasingly indian other emerging economies commodity prices started to
[1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:42.920]  go up and because of the money printing in the u.s by this uh rather the pickable character mr
[1:35:42.920 --> 1:35:53.240]  Bernanke they went ballistic and so we have very high inflation in most countries and in many
[1:35:53.240 --> 1:36:02.440]  countries this high inflation in food prices energy prices has had an impact on the wallet
[1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:13.800]  of the typical household because whereas in the u.s we say a per capita income of 40 000 dollars food
[1:36:13.800 --> 1:36:22.840]  is not a huge component in people's income in emerging economies where say the per capita income
[1:36:22.840 --> 1:36:30.040]  in vietnam india is only a thousand dollars per year food and energy makes maybe 50 percent of
[1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:38.200]  people's income and of course you're now uh i guess alluding to what we see happening in north
[1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:44.280]  africa libya now it looks like is basically falling uh to the rebellion reportedly the
[1:36:44.280 --> 1:36:52.120]  Muammar Gaddafi has fled to venezuela um what is driving uh these revolutions that we're seeing
[1:36:52.120 --> 1:36:58.520]  popping up around the world and if it is overall dollar devaluation and commodity increases uh how
[1:36:58.520 --> 1:37:06.600]  much worse is it going to get i mean how bad is the uh inflation going to get well the really big
[1:37:06.600 --> 1:37:19.960]  question is whether these uh unrest we have indonesia, libya, Bahrain, Egypt will spread to the kingdom
[1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:30.200]  of Saudi Arabia if they do it will be very difficult for the U.S. to take sides because on the one hand
[1:37:31.560 --> 1:37:39.800]  the u.s has supported the vicious regime of a mr. Mubarak they have supported the royal family of
[1:37:39.800 --> 1:37:51.160]  Saudi Arabia they never asked Saudi Arabia to have reform and democracy where they embargo
[1:37:51.960 --> 1:38:02.840]  countries like Myanmar so where will they stand what can they do and the cia is completely useless
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:13.560]  they had no idea that these unrest would start they had no ground information that something was
[1:38:13.560 --> 1:38:26.200]  going on and so the u.s and particularly this uh incapable president that the u.s has has no way
[1:38:26.200 --> 1:38:34.120]  to react properly mr. Fawber uh i mean looking at this as an economist and as a forecaster
[1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:40.680]  obviously it's spreading uh the inflation is intensifying how bad in the near term in the
[1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:44.920]  long term do you see the inflation getting i know you don't want to you can't make exact
[1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:49.480]  predictions but what do you see happening in the to the dollar what do you see happening to gold
[1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:57.160]  silver other commodities i mean they're skyrocketing right now well i would say the following i have a
[1:38:57.160 --> 1:39:05.240]  large subscriber base i asked all my subscribers to please send me an email if they have the
[1:39:05.240 --> 1:39:14.360]  feeling that their cost of lending were going up by less than five percent per annum i didn't
[1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:21.960]  receive a single email and so i think that the inflation or the cost of living increases in the
[1:39:21.960 --> 1:39:29.960]  u.s and elsewhere is much higher than what the government is publishing and i think this is
[1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:37.320]  having a negative impact on consumption because obviously the cost of necessity
[1:39:37.320 --> 1:39:47.160]  insurance taxes food energy is going up very rapidly and my answer to all this is
[1:39:48.200 --> 1:39:54.680]  the worst economic conditions will become the worst the geopolitical conditions will become
[1:39:55.320 --> 1:40:03.400]  the more mr. Bernanke and his fellow fed governors will print money and so i'm not
[1:40:03.400 --> 1:40:10.520]  also bearish on equity i think they will now correct because the market is way overboard
[1:40:11.800 --> 1:40:18.760]  and so we can easily have a correction of 10 15 percent but i think as soon as the market drops
[1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:28.760]  say 15 20 percent qe3 will come into play and all that is favorable for silver and gold
[1:40:28.760 --> 1:40:40.600]  now the question is is gold and silver expensive or is it cheap say in 1999 you could buy an ounce
[1:40:40.600 --> 1:40:52.040]  of gold for $252 now it's 1400 is it cheap or expensive well in a money printing environment
[1:40:52.040 --> 1:40:59.240]  it's very difficult to decide what is expensive and what is cheap because the function of money
[1:41:00.840 --> 1:41:08.760]  to be a unit of accounts in the store value is being lost through the money printing and so my view
[1:41:08.760 --> 1:41:19.640]  would be yeah relative to 99 the price of gold is expensive at $1400 but relative to the money
[1:41:19.640 --> 1:41:27.320]  printing may be not and so my advice to all your listeners is to gradually
[1:41:28.840 --> 1:41:37.240]  assimilate gold don't trade it don't buy it on margin just gradually assimilate and not so much
[1:41:37.240 --> 1:41:42.760]  is in it by mom yeah not so much as an investment or just as a hedge against inflation
[1:41:42.760 --> 1:41:54.840]  not to own any gold is to trust the u.s. government to trust that they will ever
[1:41:54.840 --> 1:42:01.080]  balance the budget again i don't think they will ever balance the budget again and i think the
[1:42:01.080 --> 1:42:10.680]  budget deficit will range between one and a half trillion dollars to two trillion dollars for the
[1:42:10.680 --> 1:42:19.960]  next five years i don't think they'll come down and basically i think the u.s. government is bankrupt
[1:42:21.160 --> 1:42:27.960]  sure but before they go if they will not default on the day they will just print money
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:36.520]  and not to own gold and silver is to trust mr panenki now go and look at his species
[1:42:36.520 --> 1:42:44.280]  and then you tell me whether you rather tough gold or mr panenki we're talking to mark farber
[1:42:44.280 --> 1:42:50.520]  the gloom boom doom dot com website editor and publisher of the gloom boom doom report we have
[1:42:50.520 --> 1:42:55.880]  links to it up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com so for a radio host sitting here
[1:42:55.880 --> 1:43:04.120]  in austin texas dr farber looking at this you've been completely right and in your long term you
[1:43:04.120 --> 1:43:11.160]  know breakdowns of what's happened the mainstream media moguls in financial news continue to put
[1:43:11.160 --> 1:43:15.880]  out this information because they have a vested interest in not giving their listeners and viewers
[1:43:15.880 --> 1:43:21.240]  the real truth so they can position themselves while continuing to milk and sucker the public
[1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:27.400]  but but do we just see a gradual dollar devaluation causing you know ongoing commodity increases
[1:43:27.400 --> 1:43:34.920]  or is there a danger of of some type of hyper event some type or a group of stairs that we
[1:43:34.920 --> 1:43:41.880]  basically bounce down you know to the bottom and and knowing knowing the policies of the western
[1:43:41.880 --> 1:43:46.920]  world versus what you would do to fix it i want to ask you that in a moment what's the end game
[1:43:46.920 --> 1:43:51.960]  i mean what's the time frame two three four five ten years what do we look like at the end of this
[1:43:51.960 --> 1:44:03.880]  something like a japan with just an eternal recession yes but japan didn't have high inflation
[1:44:05.240 --> 1:44:19.320]  and because prices came down actually real income went up so japan is not all that badly off
[1:44:19.320 --> 1:44:28.920]  what however however happened is that government said went ballistic and i think that now the
[1:44:28.920 --> 1:44:38.200]  plan will have more inflation through food prices and energy prices and that this will be bad for
[1:44:38.200 --> 1:44:48.280]  the yen and also for japanese government bombs and that will then drive running out of cash from
[1:44:48.280 --> 1:44:56.760]  into equity so i'm actually quite positive about the japanese stock market but in the case of the u.s
[1:44:57.320 --> 1:45:04.920]  i think they will inflate and they will print money and the question whether we will have
[1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:12.760]  hyper inflation i think we will have high inflation rate much higher than it generally
[1:45:12.760 --> 1:45:20.200]  perceived but maybe not tomorrow maybe only in three or four years or five years or so
[1:45:20.760 --> 1:45:28.040]  but i think it will happen we're already starting the dollar the question is against
[1:45:28.040 --> 1:45:36.280]  what will it go down the other paper currencies are not much better the euro is not much better than
[1:45:36.280 --> 1:45:45.320]  the u.s dollar it may be slightly better but not much better and so the only two currencies that
[1:45:45.320 --> 1:45:52.200]  exist today are gold silver platinum and palladium a doctor let me throw this in at you then
[1:45:53.240 --> 1:45:58.680]  obviously the chinese realize that and that's why there are they are now the biggest gold producer
[1:45:58.680 --> 1:46:03.720]  are they not i mean clearly they see where this is going and if you have all these currencies
[1:46:03.720 --> 1:46:10.280]  including the s dr's and the qe2 and the coming qe3 if they're all just basically another layered
[1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:17.880]  fiat derivative mix uh then what you're i mean is the only outcome of this debt black hole
[1:46:17.880 --> 1:46:25.880]  that gold and silver do emerge in the end as yes provided it's not taken away from you
[1:46:25.880 --> 1:46:34.920]  and i'd like to add that the u.s has been printing money but the others have done exactly the same
[1:46:34.920 --> 1:46:41.480]  it's global and so i think all the currencies will lose value against gold and silver
[1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:48.760]  but there are other avenues say throughout history gold has frequently been taken away
[1:46:48.760 --> 1:46:59.000]  expropriated even in the u.s in 1933 they didn't expropriate it they paid 25 dollars announced
[1:46:59.640 --> 1:47:07.560]  but then after collecting all the gold from us citizens including going to the safe deposit
[1:47:07.560 --> 1:47:16.600]  boxes with cherries to take it out they revalued it to 35 dollars so i think today the u.s government
[1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:23.160]  may take it away one day they'll pay the price and after they'll revalue it five times or whatever it is
[1:47:24.120 --> 1:47:31.960]  but i think another avenue is to own farmland and i think that real estate prices in the
[1:47:31.960 --> 1:47:39.720]  u.s have come down okay they may go down another 10 but the relatively to other countries and
[1:47:39.720 --> 1:47:47.080]  internationally and after having declined if you can find the house you like i think it's not a bad
[1:47:47.080 --> 1:47:55.160]  time to buy out in the u.s it may not go up in value but it may preserve its value well sir let's go
[1:47:55.160 --> 1:48:05.320]  art and Sam or another avenue to protect your wealth did you say art sir yes yes i totally
[1:48:05.320 --> 1:48:10.280]  agree with you and of course you also advise and are on the board of directors of many you know
[1:48:10.280 --> 1:48:17.720]  powerhouse companies and clearly whereas housing prices have gone down we do see farmland all over
[1:48:17.720 --> 1:48:22.680]  the world skyrocketing and obviously is that because the elites and those that know what's
[1:48:22.680 --> 1:48:32.760]  going on are rushing into farmland sir well i know quite a few extremely well to the people
[1:48:32.760 --> 1:48:41.800]  who have second thought about life in big cities and the security in big cities
[1:48:42.840 --> 1:48:49.000]  if they the unrest in the middle east would also spread to developed countries
[1:48:50.280 --> 1:48:57.160]  and also they also know that we might have problems with
[1:48:57.160 --> 1:49:07.880]  the modern warfare that would include cyber war or switching of the electricity or
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:13.640]  biological warfare that would touch and terrorism that would touch the big cities
[1:49:14.360 --> 1:49:19.480]  so they want to be paid they buy an island they buy farmland in the middle of nowhere
[1:49:20.120 --> 1:49:25.800]  well that's what i was about to say i know a lot of wealthy people you're truly wealthy that i've
[1:49:25.800 --> 1:49:30.520]  run into here in austin and of course you obviously have run into about a million times more than i have
[1:49:30.520 --> 1:49:36.200]  you know we're running in the highest circles i don't think i'm a social defender but but i mean
[1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:41.080]  you know just running into well-known you know people off record told me four years ago that the
[1:49:41.080 --> 1:49:45.800]  us and the entire world economy was going to collapse via the derivatives and that they were
[1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:51.320]  basically fleeing i mean i even know about john wane part of his family just ran off to central
[1:49:51.320 --> 1:49:57.720]  america i mean so many people are are are evacuating some of the richest people in israel
[1:49:57.720 --> 1:50:02.360]  it's been in the news are evacuating israel i mean what do the elite know that the general
[1:50:02.360 --> 1:50:12.520]  public hasn't been let in on doctor well there's another element because of the advent of computers
[1:50:12.520 --> 1:50:22.600]  the fax machine and in the last 20 years the internet if i'm a head fund manager if i'm a
[1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:28.360]  well-to-do person i can run my business from anywhere i sit here in the north of thailand
[1:50:28.920 --> 1:50:37.480]  i have bloomberg our computer access and everything so i don't need to be in a big city i can choose
[1:50:37.480 --> 1:50:45.640]  a lifestyle to be in a small city and have a larger space or to be in the country side
[1:50:48.920 --> 1:50:54.200]  so that's a big part of the shift i had a caller earlier who uh before you came on who wanted me
[1:50:54.200 --> 1:51:02.760]  to ask you uh about uh gold mining supplies versus demand and could china or some other country or
[1:51:02.760 --> 1:51:09.160]  group dump a bunch of gold on the market and really knock it down far or is from what i've read
[1:51:09.160 --> 1:51:17.160]  china is mining a lot but consuming it and selling it because of demand well first of all if you look
[1:51:17.160 --> 1:51:27.320]  at the international reserve at the hands of central banks and the wealth accumulation over the
[1:51:27.320 --> 1:51:37.720]  last 20 years among well-to-do people the international reserves have grown from one trillion dollars
[1:51:37.720 --> 1:51:45.800]  to now nine and a half trillion dollars the chinese they have two and a half trillion the asians have
[1:51:45.800 --> 1:51:57.080]  70 percent of the nine and a half trillion the asians they have two percent of these reserves
[1:51:57.080 --> 1:52:07.480]  invested in gold very little the indian the reserve bank of india bought yeah a year ago
[1:52:07.480 --> 1:52:15.720]  200 tons at roughly one thousand and forty dollars now it's one thousand four hundred
[1:52:16.440 --> 1:52:22.920]  the chinese it's kind of a loss of faith for them to go into the open market and buy and
[1:52:22.920 --> 1:52:30.200]  announce that they're buying gold but what they produce they keep and they have given
[1:52:30.200 --> 1:52:39.080]  incentive and create programs in china whereby individuals can now buy gold so they're bullish
[1:52:39.080 --> 1:52:45.640]  on gold yeah i mean for sure they're not bullish on the u.s. dollar and they're not bullish on
[1:52:45.640 --> 1:52:50.200]  mr obama and they're not both that they were never bullish on mr bush so in layman's terms
[1:52:50.200 --> 1:52:55.320]  doctor you've got all these countries sitting on trillions of dollars of dirty crud paper not
[1:52:55.320 --> 1:53:03.960]  worth the you know papers it's written on and so and and so the entire magnetic or or or gravitational
[1:53:03.960 --> 1:53:14.120]  pull is only towards metals is that what you're saying well i think that investors gradually
[1:53:14.120 --> 1:53:21.560]  realize that say if you're an investor for the next 10 years what you don't want to own
[1:53:21.560 --> 1:53:29.320]  is say a 30 years u.s. government bond you don't want to own a 10 years u.s. government bond
[1:53:30.040 --> 1:53:39.720]  at the yield of 3.6 percent so what else is there you can buy stock you can buy precious metals you
[1:53:39.720 --> 1:53:48.440]  can buy commodity but commodity the industrial ones and the agricultural ones and the stuff
[1:53:48.440 --> 1:53:56.840]  are very volatile and usually the supply response is relatively short in other words there's a
[1:53:56.840 --> 1:54:05.640]  shortage of wheat and soybeans corn within one year you can plan some more but in the case of
[1:54:05.640 --> 1:54:15.480]  precious metals you can't do that the same for oil the supply response is very slow and so the chinese
[1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:22.920]  is if they could they would buy all the american oil company favor on extra mobile
[1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:32.200]  marathon oil whatever it is and phd and rio dinto but politically these countries i mean the u.s.
[1:54:32.200 --> 1:54:38.920]  australia canada will not allow the chinese to do that so what else do they want to do they go and
[1:54:38.920 --> 1:54:47.160]  buy confessions in venezuela in latin america in general and in africa insulate and support and so
[1:54:47.880 --> 1:54:54.360]  and develop their own resource mr. fauber is it accurate to say that we're buying junk here in
[1:54:54.360 --> 1:54:58.920]  the u.s. with our money they're buying real hard assets is it accurate that they own that they're
[1:54:58.920 --> 1:55:07.000]  now producing over 90 percent of rare earth minerals the chinese that is correct okay the u.s.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:17.320]  who could produce much more but the problem in the u.s. is that exploration like generally speaking
[1:55:17.320 --> 1:55:27.400]  capital spending capital spending which means education r&d infrastructure plans and equipment
[1:55:27.400 --> 1:55:36.360]  was neglected yes because the government economic policy and the federal economic policy the federal
[1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:42.200]  foreign economic policy target consumption and not the investment yes sir we're almost out of time
[1:55:42.200 --> 1:55:47.800]  in the last three minutes we have with you are we in a global depression are we entering one
[1:55:47.800 --> 1:55:55.000]  are or are we going to enter one and just overall summing up the state of the world economy and
[1:55:56.360 --> 1:56:06.200]  you mentioned earlier on the world the word end game we are in the end game but we are currently
[1:56:06.200 --> 1:56:14.120]  in a cracker boom a cracker boom is when you postpone a recession through money printing and
[1:56:14.120 --> 1:56:21.160]  credit growth the credit growth is not strong in the private sector but it's much worse you think
[1:56:21.160 --> 1:56:28.040]  it's in the government sector and the government is the most unproductive factor in economic life
[1:56:28.040 --> 1:56:38.200]  and so this cracker boom will end very badly but before it ends badly we'll have money printing
[1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:46.760]  very high inflation and when everything fails the u.s. will go to war they are already in the
[1:56:46.760 --> 1:56:59.240]  war but they'll increase it absolutely and you're saying two to four years is the main vector zone
[1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:08.200]  well in my view by printing money you can postpone the evil at the end of the end game
[1:57:08.200 --> 1:57:18.120]  for say seven to ten years really American they did it between 1980 and 89 but now it's
[1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:22.360]  but I mean now that the hangover is so much bigger and it looks like everything is starting
[1:57:22.360 --> 1:57:27.080]  to accelerate so much faster and you say we have dumb presidents well it's just they're
[1:57:27.080 --> 1:57:32.840]  just looting the country I mean you know for the special are deluding the country they're lying
[1:57:32.840 --> 1:57:41.640]  yes and the fact is simply this for the typical household and I'm not speaking here of the
[1:57:41.640 --> 1:57:48.920]  Goldman Sachs partner and the Wall Street but for the typical household the median household
[1:57:49.560 --> 1:57:58.520]  the average American the standards of living have come down yes and they will continue to go down
[1:57:58.520 --> 1:58:04.360]  under the president's economic policy and that's why they put a police state grid in preemptively
[1:58:04.360 --> 1:58:10.360]  it's it's extremely premeditated well mr. Fomber the website's gloom boom doom.com we haven't had

[2:00:05.560 --> 2:00:12.840]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[2:00:12.840 --> 2:00:21.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[2:00:23.960 --> 2:00:27.560]  okay I know the phone's up an hour ago and only took a few of them I'm gonna take calls
[2:00:27.560 --> 2:00:32.280]  throughout the rest of this hour and smatter the transmission with key news intel information
[2:00:32.280 --> 2:00:36.680]  latest developments out of Libya a reported Gaddafi's flood of Venezuela and aircraft strafing
[2:00:36.680 --> 2:00:45.720]  people in major cities in Libya we've got riots going on in different places in Iraq TV stations
[2:00:45.720 --> 2:00:51.080]  being burned gold continuing to surge silver continuing to surge I wanted is this is a moving
[2:00:51.080 --> 2:00:55.720]  fluid situation there's a few minutes to bring Ted Anderson the owner of the genesis network
[2:00:55.720 --> 2:01:02.120]  and he financed the founding of it 13 14 years ago now 15 man time flies with mitis resources
[2:01:02.120 --> 2:01:07.320]  uh Ted I uh what's golden silver last time you looked at it a few months a few minutes ago I mean
[2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:12.600]  we just heard what Mark Fawber said just echoing everything we've talked about well he's exactly
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:18.360]  right I mean silver hit 34 dollars and five cents today gold over 1400 actually all the way up to
[2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:26.440]  1409 60 well over 17 dollars and 50 cent increase just today alone silver is up over four percent
[2:01:26.440 --> 2:01:31.400]  today I mean that's just unheard of Alex it's like on a rocket ship to the moon man this
[2:01:31.400 --> 2:01:38.680]  stuff is going crazy and and it just pleases me to all end last Friday people just rang our
[2:01:38.680 --> 2:01:45.320]  phones off the hook because three silver dollars and three of your videos for 97 dollars has become
[2:01:45.320 --> 2:01:50.840]  such a fabulous buy that they're just taking advantage of it I hope to god they pass those
[2:01:50.840 --> 2:01:57.160]  videos out now with silver over 34 dollars an ounce and you're still picking up three silver
[2:01:57.160 --> 2:02:02.840]  dollars and having three of Alex's videos for 97 bucks I mean some of the people are smart
[2:02:02.840 --> 2:02:07.320]  they're taking advantage of some of these other things that we have and getting a position in
[2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:12.920]  gold and silver but if nothing else I mean my goodness get your credit card out and buy this
[2:02:12.920 --> 2:02:19.800]  video set I mean two things I mean this country is going to you know this country is going down
[2:02:19.800 --> 2:02:24.440]  to shoot real fast and one of the ways that you can arm yourself with the information is getting
[2:02:24.440 --> 2:02:29.000]  these videos well tether's on a better deal out there three silver dollars for 97 dollars with
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:34.200]  a 60 dollar value three of my most powerful films in game obama deception fall the republic
[2:02:34.200 --> 2:02:40.120]  and free shipping that's a 70 plus dollar value on top of it now with silver going up into 35 or
[2:02:40.120 --> 2:02:46.440]  whatever what did silver go to silver was at 34 dollars and let's see here 34 dollars and five
[2:02:46.440 --> 2:02:51.160]  cents today at its peak okay so the point is is that you folks who the math you can't beat that deal
[2:02:51.160 --> 2:02:58.680]  800 686 2237 800 686 2237 the reason I called you back in when we got about two minutes
[2:02:58.680 --> 2:03:04.280]  left head and thanks for joining us is bobber was talking about they may try to confiscate
[2:03:04.280 --> 2:03:09.160]  gold again uh and then you know it'll go up five times in value after they confiscate it
[2:03:09.160 --> 2:03:15.800]  you know uh just like they did in 33 and my statement to that is is that so what I mean most
[2:03:15.800 --> 2:03:20.120]  people didn't turn their gold in when that happened and what are you just you know just keep the
[2:03:20.120 --> 2:03:24.520]  dollars and let them rape you there at least they've got to physically try to get it from you
[2:03:24.520 --> 2:03:30.280]  also silver's never been confiscated that's why I've been heavy in silver as well but I'm sorry
[2:03:30.280 --> 2:03:34.040]  you know the silver and gold I've bought over the years it's not a lot of it but it's an emergency
[2:03:34.040 --> 2:03:38.840]  backup I'm not giving it up to these crooks and that's the type of thing if they try this again
[2:03:38.840 --> 2:03:43.320]  we're just not going to go along with it so that's my answer to people that say oh you know I'll just
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:47.880]  let them devalue my dollar I mean you gotta do something with you Alex and I can tell you people
[2:03:47.880 --> 2:03:51.960]  should just stay away from the kind of gold that you have to give up your social security number
[2:03:51.960 --> 2:03:56.440]  for whether if it's buying or selling it doesn't matter just say hey do I ever have to get a 10
[2:03:56.440 --> 2:04:01.160]  90 foot nine or do I have to give up my social security number on this type of gold and if that
[2:04:01.160 --> 2:04:05.880]  is the truth and get away from that kind of gold there's plenty of options in the bullion and also
[2:04:05.880 --> 2:04:11.640]  the the very low low low low premium type gold coins and uh you know you don't that's right they're
[2:04:11.640 --> 2:04:16.520]  just semi-nomismatic but still they're collector so they don't go into the confiscation rule correct
[2:04:16.520 --> 2:04:20.760]  yeah and just stay away from anything that's real high premium at this point because I can tell you
[2:04:20.760 --> 2:04:25.160]  right now it makes no sense to set up a coin collection not with the economy that we have
[2:04:25.160 --> 2:04:30.760]  right now stay with stuff that is private affordable and yeah yeah I mean we hear about
[2:04:30.760 --> 2:04:35.480]  other people with you know 30 40 markups because they're selling numismatics which are fine if you
[2:04:35.480 --> 2:04:40.440]  know what you're doing Ted is got him if you want him at great prices but his main thing is bullion
[2:04:40.440 --> 2:04:45.560]  that has a collector value so it's not under confiscation but it really is basically a
[2:04:45.560 --> 2:04:54.760]  bullion prices give him a call protect yourselves today 800-686-2237-1800-686-2237
[2:04:54.760 --> 2:04:58.600]  Ted Anderson thank you so much for answering those questions we'll be right back with your phone

[2:05:18.760 --> 2:05:24.040]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:05:24.040 --> 2:05:29.240]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[2:05:29.240 --> 2:05:34.440]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[2:05:34.440 --> 2:05:39.400]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful
[2:05:39.400 --> 2:05:43.960]  backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by

[2:09:49.400 --> 2:09:55.880]  venezuela denies libyas qaddafi enroute uh but the british foreign secretary william haig
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:03.160]  said earlier today that their word from inside libyas he has taken off uh for venezuela uh
[2:10:03.160 --> 2:10:08.440]  but who knows the one in telegraph a few hours ago reported libyan colonel qaddafi fleased a venezuela

[2:10:31.720 --> 2:10:36.760]  and many of the people have reasons to be angry the point is why are they being triggered now
[2:10:36.760 --> 2:10:43.400]  okay it doesn't mean that we are for qaddafi or that we're for hazy mubarak we don't like them
[2:10:43.400 --> 2:10:49.560]  the point is the globalists want chaos and this is what williams told you four months ago in october
[2:10:49.560 --> 2:10:54.360]  now it's happening this is what all the evidence shows george soros is all over this and he's a
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:11:00.680]  bad guy folks so think ahead a couple more moves and then think ahead a few more or just read the
[2:11:00.680 --> 2:11:06.200]  books written by kissinger and the this council on farm relations reports and where they brag about
[2:11:06.200 --> 2:11:11.960]  all of it and sure they may lose control of these but they still get the chaos they want
[2:11:11.960 --> 2:11:17.880]  but they're shaking up the bag to move us into this next crisis phase okay let's go to nathan

[2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:08.440]  uh that the globalists want to put chips in our brains you know uh on your last broadcast uh well
[2:13:08.440 --> 2:13:14.600]  i have some uh the most powerful information uh i think would be good and the uprising and
[2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:19.240]  waking of ours that we've yet to put the youth will tell us tell us the info all right well
[2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:25.560]  it's our brain and uh call uh the first i have two studies to tell you about um the first one
[2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:32.280]  is uh the there's a book called train your main train your mind change your brain by sharing
[2:13:32.280 --> 2:13:36.920]  begli now in 2001 richard davison who is a scientist that studies neuroplasticity to
[2:13:36.920 --> 2:13:41.080]  just test it at the lab at the university of wisconsin madison where he has the dolium
[2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:46.920]  and another monk to come and be hooked up to an electron cephalogram also known as an eeg machine
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:51.160]  which uh measures and records the electoral activity of your brain now first you had the
[2:13:51.160 --> 2:13:55.160]  moment i think of anything and then you had to think of compassion when you did this the scales
[2:13:55.160 --> 2:13:58.520]  were not the charts with the amount of brain brain activity that was going on sure no no i mean
[2:13:58.520 --> 2:14:03.960]  that's the that's not the only study when the brain is in a loving empathizing position it's the
[2:14:03.960 --> 2:14:09.960]  highest level brain waves you can have and and uh that's absolutely right send that stuff over i
[2:14:09.960 --> 2:14:14.280]  got a jump was i promise to get to a lot of collars nathan tim and michigan tim you're on the air go
[2:14:14.280 --> 2:14:24.200]  ahead hey alex can you hear me strike leader you are live we are v2 go ahead okay alex hey um how
[2:14:24.200 --> 2:14:30.280]  are you doing today anyway listen you know i heard that gentleman say something about the us printing
[2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:41.720]  money that uh i just wanted to get your uh a quick uh answer to this uh i am under the the uh the
[2:14:41.720 --> 2:14:52.200]  notion that as long as the u.s remains this you know the the standard the standard uh uh
[2:14:52.840 --> 2:14:59.880]  uh of the world they can continue to print money but once that they lose that position
[2:15:00.520 --> 2:15:08.040]  as the uh world reserve currency right that that they will no longer be able just to print money
[2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:13.880]  so what the g20's been doing in the last five years is concerted devaluation of all major
[2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:19.720]  currencies to try to hide the inflation but that's not happening now so it's forcing a rush into
[2:15:19.720 --> 2:15:25.160]  commodities which then exacerbates things going up even higher on top of dollar devaluation to
[2:15:25.160 --> 2:15:32.280]  purchase vital resources food energy and that also drives investors and governments into gold and
[2:15:32.280 --> 2:15:37.960]  silver so uh that's why they just try to use a propaganda overlay while the elites hoard gold
[2:15:37.960 --> 2:15:42.600]  and silver to tell the public justin beaver doesn't like gold and they go well justin beaver
[2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:48.440]  doesn't like it it's a horrible investment it's only gone up 400 percent in the last 10 years
[2:15:48.440 --> 2:15:53.400]  justin beaver says don't get it and they go justin beaver says don't get it and so they feel very
[2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:57.720]  genius and they they waddle around and watch their their football games and suck their thumbs with
[2:15:57.720 --> 2:16:05.800]  pleasure but i mean what's your question okay well um actually you know um i i got the i got the
[2:16:05.800 --> 2:16:17.320]  chance to give to give my first uh uh uh public um speech at a uh at a town at a city town hall
[2:16:17.320 --> 2:16:23.960]  meeting uh why are you doing that just watch justin beaver man come on that'll save us come on
[2:16:23.960 --> 2:16:31.560]  lady gaga come on man gaga came out in an egg okay i mean that's a god that's more important than
[2:16:34.680 --> 2:16:40.920]  we try to be telling people that you can't be proactive you that there is things you can do
[2:16:40.920 --> 2:16:45.160]  oh look we're getting fluoride taken out all over the world we're kicking their hind in
[2:16:45.160 --> 2:16:51.800]  i appreciate your call tim exactly look look when you realize how fake it all is the football

[2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:09.960]  guns pass the cyber security act and uh you know the police state's good and then and then your
[2:17:09.960 --> 2:17:15.800]  children are turned into mindless vassals who who now they they look up at some twit instead of looking
[2:17:15.800 --> 2:17:23.320]  up to thomas jefferson or or looking up to nicola tesla or looking up to to majelin i mean kids
[2:17:23.320 --> 2:17:31.880]  majelin's a lot cooler than justin beaver he circumnavigated with one ship the entire planet
[2:17:31.880 --> 2:17:36.840]  he was killed by wild natives before they got back to portugal and when they got back there
[2:17:36.840 --> 2:17:42.840]  was only like 11 people alive of the 200 and something crew and the entire ship was rotting

[2:19:35.320 --> 2:19:40.600]  and once the mind is unlocked once the intellect is turned on then comes the discernment then comes
[2:19:40.600 --> 2:19:47.400]  the awakening of the soul then comes true enlightenment and empowerment so the globalists

[2:27:11.800 --> 2:27:16.520]  him up and probably trying to because he worked for mubarak he was an egyptian cia agent or
[2:27:16.520 --> 2:27:20.680]  intelligence agent he thought they were setting him up so he recorded them and then he went and
[2:27:20.680 --> 2:27:24.600]  gave a press conference and that's why that all came out at the time that the feds had basically
[2:27:24.600 --> 2:27:30.280]  run the 93 uh world trade center attack mubarak basically fingered the patties and it was a
[2:27:30.280 --> 2:27:34.680]  suppressed a news story too for a while the other thing i'd like to comment on oh yeah
[2:27:35.240 --> 2:27:39.640]  either destruction i think is the uh song you're trying to find by barry maguire
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:45.480]  yeah no i'm i'm familiar with that song that would be good bumper music now when i was saying

[2:33:16.920 --> 2:33:22.040]  the 20th century and now in the 21st century it's time to stand up and realize that we should not
[2:33:22.040 --> 2:33:27.800]  allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze we should not submit to dehumanization i don't know
[2:33:27.800 --> 2:33:32.680]  about you but i'm concerned with what's happening in this world i'm concerned with the structure
[2:33:32.680 --> 2:33:37.960]  i'm concerned with the systems of control those that control my life and those that seek to control
[2:33:37.960 --> 2:33:44.120]  even more i want freedom that's what i want and that's what they should want except each and
[2:33:44.120 --> 2:33:49.880]  every one of us to turn this into some of the three the hatred the envy and yes the insecurities
[2:33:49.880 --> 2:33:56.680]  because that is the central mode of control make us feel small so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty
[2:33:56.680 --> 2:34:03.960]  our liberty our destiny we have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale start
[2:34:03.960 --> 2:34:09.080]  challenging this corporate slave state the 21st century is going to be a new century not the
[2:34:09.080 --> 2:34:15.320]  century of slavery not the century of lies and issues of notion giving us and classism stateism
[2:34:15.320 --> 2:34:20.680]  and all the rest of the modes of control it's going to be the age of humankind standing up for
[2:34:20.680 --> 2:34:26.920]  something pure and something right what a bunch of garbage liberal democratic sermon of republican
[2:34:26.920 --> 2:34:32.680]  it's all there to control you two sides of the same coin two management teams getting for control
[2:34:32.680 --> 2:34:38.440]  the cdo job of slavery incorporated the truth is out there in front of you that they lay out this
[2:34:38.440 --> 2:34:47.240]  buffet of lies i'm sick of it and i'm not going to take a bite out of it do you got me
[2:34:47.240 --> 2:34:51.960]  humankind is too good we're not a bunch of underachievers we're going to stand up and we're
[2:34:51.960 --> 2:34:58.520]  going to be human beings we're not real things the things that matter creativity and the dynamic
[2:34:58.520 --> 2:35:10.280]  human spirit that refuses to submit well that's it that's all i got to say until your court we are
[2:35:10.280 --> 2:35:15.000]  back live and that of course was the ultimate red pill a remix of my appearance in the film
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:21.480]  waking live a richard rink letter richard link letter award-winning film i want to go back to
[2:35:21.480 --> 2:35:26.120]  your phone calls and more of the news here but these bad boys a few weeks ago we got the v for
[2:35:26.120 --> 2:35:31.720]  victory t-shirts you are the resistance in now we have these bumper stickers pretty close to cost
[2:35:31.720 --> 2:35:37.080]  you are the resistance uh designed by um phil did you design this or did you or did you name
[2:35:39.160 --> 2:35:44.840]  phil did a great job he did this and uh i'll give folks a uh actual camera shot of this if you're
[2:35:44.840 --> 2:35:50.280]  a radio listener go to info wars dot com and click on the online video bookstore shopping cart where
[2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:56.360]  we got the t-shirts the uh draff ron paul t-shirts the you are the resistance i'd like to see these
[2:35:56.360 --> 2:36:03.240]  up on cars and other places uh and i instructed them a month ago when we decided to design these
[2:36:03.240 --> 2:36:12.520]  and order these uh to put them pretty close to cost let me check how much they are okay so they're
[2:36:12.520 --> 2:36:23.080]  a dollar a piece when you just get 15 um and uh then they're oh 695 excuse me so they are close to
[2:36:23.080 --> 2:36:30.840]  cost good okay so there's 695 for 15 i'm looking way across the room we can't read it um so they've
[2:36:30.840 --> 2:36:38.040]  got 100 pack for 19 dollars 100 pack of these gorgeous bumper stickers for 19 dollars they
[2:36:38.040 --> 2:36:46.120]  got a 50 pack for eight dollars they got a 15 pack for 695 and of course a little bit of profit
[2:36:46.120 --> 2:36:49.480]  we make i don't think there's much there because i didn't instruct them to make it almost at cost
[2:36:49.480 --> 2:36:54.360]  you know so we can also cover the shipping and handling uh but uh you imagine what 100 of these
[2:36:54.360 --> 2:37:00.360]  bad boys can do around town to make sure it's legal and lawful where you post them um but it's not
[2:37:00.360 --> 2:37:05.720]  like we're in a revolution here oh the government says it's good when people are going after police
[2:37:05.720 --> 2:37:11.800]  and burning things i think that's bad uh but oh but then our media tells us that that that it's
[2:37:11.800 --> 2:37:16.360]  great when people get violent overseas when it's a regime they want to topple but then they tell you
[2:37:16.360 --> 2:37:21.480]  it's evil evil to even have a political bumper sticker on your car much less post it in public
[2:37:21.480 --> 2:37:29.560]  oh that's so violent and evil um so again you are the resistance info wars.com with the big red
[2:37:29.560 --> 2:37:35.800]  v available at info wars.com by calling toll three eight eight eight two five three three one three
[2:37:35.800 --> 2:37:40.040]  nine imagine if everybody listening to me in austin ordered 50 of these or a hundred of these
[2:37:40.040 --> 2:37:45.160]  and put them up wow that would be a big saturation effect let's let's launch operation v in every
[2:37:45.160 --> 2:37:49.000]  city or you're welcome to make your own design of bumper stickers and post them everywhere
[2:37:49.880 --> 2:37:56.760]  but uh again what i'm saying about revolution is this i want a revolution of ideas i want a
[2:37:56.760 --> 2:38:01.240]  renaissance on awakening i want to rediscover the bill of rights and constitution liberty
[2:38:01.240 --> 2:38:04.840]  culture and take our states back and then our federal government back and block the globalist
[2:38:04.840 --> 2:38:11.160]  at the pass okay and that means you getting involved i am not for violent revolution
[2:38:11.160 --> 2:38:16.040]  offensively to defend yourself and if we go deep into super tyranny then you got to do what you
[2:38:16.040 --> 2:38:21.400]  got to do to protect you and your family but it it's when you see the george soros and the state
[2:38:21.400 --> 2:38:25.800]  department involved in all this stuff you know it's going to hurt the people in those countries
[2:38:25.800 --> 2:38:32.600]  even more as bad as their ridiculous clown like muammar qaddafi is as bad as hazing mubarak the
[2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:38.200]  globalist puppet is why is this now happening they want the world in turmoil and so we should
[2:38:38.200 --> 2:38:43.800]  support the people in libya and egypt and reach out to them in fact i thought about shooting videos
[2:38:44.760 --> 2:38:48.680]  no we have a lot of listeners who can then translate it into arabic uh you'll make a version
[2:38:48.680 --> 2:38:53.480]  that way we don't have the skills or the people to do it i guess we could have we dropped everything
[2:38:53.480 --> 2:38:57.160]  but the point is maybe i should make a video reaching out i thought about this weeks ago to the
[2:38:57.160 --> 2:39:02.520]  arabes and others about hey understand you don't want globalist installing something of their own
[2:39:02.520 --> 2:39:06.600]  after this you want real freedom and obviously they know that but it's good to have that solidarity
[2:39:06.600 --> 2:39:12.600]  back and forth that's all i'm saying here uh let's go ahead and talk to scott and vermont scott you're
[2:39:12.600 --> 2:39:17.720]  on the air yeah hi alex it's been a few years since i talked to you um a couple things to report from
[2:39:17.720 --> 2:39:23.720]  vermont uh we have uh people think that vermont is uh one of the best on uh second amendment rights
[2:39:23.720 --> 2:39:27.400]  and uh actually a few years ago i should have called you three years ago after it happened i
[2:39:27.400 --> 2:39:32.760]  heard about it from the uh proprietor of the flea market who said that and told others how
[2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:37.800]  the reason why the sign used to say uh no dogs allowed now it says uh no dogs or firearms allowed
[2:39:37.800 --> 2:39:42.360]  is because uh the deal he doesn't let dealers sell firearms that are like he used to anymore
[2:39:42.360 --> 2:39:48.360]  or because he had uh a half a dozen or almost uh fed i think he said from boss i know they run
[2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:54.200]  stains they normally bring an x con or an illegal alien in and then they trick somebody to do a
[2:39:54.200 --> 2:39:59.240]  private sale which is like you sell in a gun to your neighbor so they can then threaten the uh
[2:39:59.240 --> 2:40:04.520]  owner of the facility uh to shut down anybody being able to lease it who allows firearms and
[2:40:04.520 --> 2:40:08.840]  that's the so-called gun show loophole they're trying to shut down everywhere it wasn't gun
[2:40:08.840 --> 2:40:12.520]  shows exactly but the flea markets and uh you know as far as i know i still have the right to
[2:40:12.520 --> 2:40:18.360]  sell a firearm at that at a in my yard cell if i want to vermont but uh he was literally strong
[2:40:18.360 --> 2:40:22.200]  armed by one of the fed squeezed his arm while saying you know what you do is you go to the flea
[2:40:22.200 --> 2:40:27.240]  market with photos of your firearm you make sure the person has a driver's license for your own
[2:40:27.240 --> 2:40:31.480]  safety and and say you don't have a felony and they say yes and you go okay let's go to the
[2:40:31.480 --> 2:40:34.920]  hamburger place down the road and i'll sell it to you there well it should have happened there was
[2:40:34.920 --> 2:40:39.000]  a bunch of guys you know and you know unorganized militia guys should have stood around and said
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:43.080]  hey you fed to get out of here and but uh he buckled in and so far arms at the flea market
[2:40:43.080 --> 2:40:47.880]  anymore well scott we've done our best here in austin you know breaking the same stings going
[2:40:47.880 --> 2:40:52.360]  on at the gun show and trying to promote the new location they had to move to but this is a strategy
[2:40:52.360 --> 2:40:57.400]  all over the nation to shut down the legal private sale of firearms at flea markets and gun shows
[2:40:57.400 --> 2:41:01.240]  so when i said the gun show loophole that's what the government calls it when you sell your neighbor
[2:41:01.240 --> 2:41:07.640]  a gun or you sell them at a flea market or anywhere yeah and we have a new cfr member as a state
[2:41:07.640 --> 2:41:12.680]  senator in vermont now this guy's a multimillionaire as far as i know from his our kurdish oil deals
[2:41:12.680 --> 2:41:18.040]  i may know who i'm talking about his father was a cfr member and his father resigned and discussed
[2:41:18.040 --> 2:41:22.840]  and this man peter galbraith his uh he acknowledged the fact his father resigned from the cfr and
[2:41:22.840 --> 2:41:27.560]  discussed at the undue influence of it and i'll be he tried to eat until to my intelligence by telling
[2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:34.280]  me uh and he became his son he got elected by the way um not much choice between one lefty or
[2:41:34.280 --> 2:41:40.280]  another he's a million is a limousine liberal i call him but uh remember the council for relations
[2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:44.520]  which he tried to tell me oh it's just a boring talk group now i hear you i appreciate the call
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:49.400]  what they do is they get about 5 000 people together the leadership are totally globalist
[2:41:49.400 --> 2:41:53.240]  the the publication they put out called foreign affairs every month on newsstands it's like a
[2:41:53.240 --> 2:41:58.520]  book but it's on magazine stands it's a great book easy about 200 pages long it openly calls
[2:41:58.520 --> 2:42:01.720]  for the end of this country and the end of our sovereignty and rockefeller writes books about
[2:42:01.720 --> 2:42:07.560]  it then they get kind of mid-level power people in there to control them and if they sell out
[2:42:07.560 --> 2:42:12.840]  then they move up the ranks uh good point scott uh let's talk to michael in california michael you're
[2:42:12.840 --> 2:42:21.480]  on the air hey alex you know what's going on with the ron paul fund today uh don't speak quite as loud
[2:42:21.480 --> 2:42:27.160]  i kind of just uh what you said i'm sorry alex i'm sorry i just uh i just called that ask if
[2:42:27.160 --> 2:42:31.960]  you knew what's going on with the ron paul front today the ron paul front uh no what's going on
[2:42:32.520 --> 2:42:38.280]  we have uh ron paul liberty cock money bomb going on today we just exceeded 427 thousand dollars
[2:42:38.840 --> 2:42:43.960]  well we're big supporters of ron paul and uh as the campaign builds up we're going to continue
[2:42:43.960 --> 2:42:48.120]  to try to support it so people should check out campaign for liberty and get involved in that
[2:42:48.120 --> 2:42:54.120]  do you have any comments about what's happening uh in the world today well as as far as the world
[2:42:54.120 --> 2:43:00.120]  in general i just uh the reason my main call was because of ron paul and we need to energize this
[2:43:00.120 --> 2:43:07.480]  info war and because of the world events that we have going on around us ron paul is the answer to
[2:43:07.480 --> 2:43:12.520]  many of the problems that we have here in our country no he's he's perfect he's perfect uh
[2:43:12.520 --> 2:43:16.360]  it'd be better he's a little bit younger uh just so the media wouldn't spit it that he's too old
[2:43:16.360 --> 2:43:21.320]  but he's in pretty good health and even if he doesn't win running for president he'll be there to
[2:43:21.320 --> 2:43:26.360]  inject real ideas i think it's dangerous though and ron paul said this to put all our eggs in one
[2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:33.320]  basket we support ron paul but we also support the liberty style movement you know the true tea
[2:43:33.320 --> 2:43:37.960]  party at the state level so we can block the feds via the ninth and tenth amendment just like the
[2:43:37.960 --> 2:43:42.520]  states are saying no to government run healthcare just like the states are saying no to fluoride
[2:43:42.520 --> 2:43:46.680]  at many other levels no to the patriot act uh the states are coming in and trying to defend
[2:43:46.680 --> 2:43:51.160]  our borders and our sovereignty via the globalist north american union plan to flood the country with
[2:43:51.160 --> 2:43:56.760]  cheap labor also as a voting bloc uh so absolutely i appreciate your call very exciting to hear that
[2:43:57.720 --> 2:44:00.760]  let's go ahead and talk to david in kansas david you're on the air
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:07.080]  yeah also i've started to update you i know you have your google bombs and all the other stuff
[2:44:07.080 --> 2:44:12.680]  and uh one interesting thing i've noticed over the past several weeks and this is rather disturbing
[2:44:12.680 --> 2:44:18.840]  i added you to my favorite link on my computer and every time i go on to the favorite link
[2:44:18.840 --> 2:44:25.320]  it's popping up with the bean uh web page and i'm like what the heck and i kept on doing this i
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:31.000]  reloaded your back on the favorites went to your website and and put it and relinked it and went
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:36.440]  back on things i actually have to go to the alternative and like open up a second page
[2:44:36.440 --> 2:44:41.000]  to get back to your website just like that put that in there and let your uh your guys know that
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:46.840]  business there's something else going on that is undermining your linkage thanks well thank you uh
[2:44:46.840 --> 2:44:55.400]  there is a cocktail of things going on um with google and being and all these big globalist
[2:44:55.400 --> 2:44:59.720]  platforms who openly go to globalist meetings and call for world government openly overthrow
[2:44:59.720 --> 2:45:05.080]  governments uh you know here they want to suppress us but then they want to overthrow their enemies
[2:45:05.080 --> 2:45:12.600]  uh and you see this more and more where especially overseas the google if you're using google or even
[2:45:12.600 --> 2:45:17.560]  have them you know on your computer they'll put a message up saying do you want to go to this website
[2:45:17.560 --> 2:45:23.000]  it could be dangerous and uh they're doing that more and more to innocent websites now this didn't
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:28.200]  happen to us two weeks ago a week and a half ago but it happened to 84 000 other sites in the news
[2:45:28.200 --> 2:45:37.080]  reported including um real estate companies uh dog grooming car dealerships restaurants 84 000
[2:45:37.080 --> 2:45:41.960]  websites the feds just seized them claiming that there was child pornography on them and
[2:45:41.960 --> 2:45:47.640]  turned out there was no child pornography and they put a message up the the feds route the dns to
[2:45:47.640 --> 2:45:53.320]  their server saying this is a child porn website and they're just going to keep doing it so that's
[2:45:53.320 --> 2:45:58.360]  a beta test for the internet kill switch i mean folks this is all happening there could come a day
[2:45:58.360 --> 2:46:03.800]  look already four or five years ago the watson brothers when they've been in europe and in england
[2:46:03.800 --> 2:46:09.080]  they'll try to use the government free broadband that they take taxpayer money for and then you
[2:46:09.080 --> 2:46:13.800]  give to you know they you know why the schools around the country take federal grants that's
[2:46:13.800 --> 2:46:20.280]  money taken from the people and then quote give i always see the news the school's giving laptops
[2:46:20.280 --> 2:46:25.640]  oh the government just gave it to us no they took somebody's wealth redistributed it and
[2:46:25.640 --> 2:46:30.280]  then they load the computers up with tracking software video audio they're watching the kids at
[2:46:30.280 --> 2:46:39.800]  home uh in um oh what's the capital of california sacramento uh in philadelphia i mean it just goes
[2:46:39.800 --> 2:46:45.880]  on and on in the last decade where schools are watching you over the laptops and even though
[2:46:45.880 --> 2:46:51.240]  it's in the news the general public knows that's 1984's thing all that couldn't be true that alex
[2:46:51.240 --> 2:46:58.280]  god says they're they're taking baby's birth oh well here's the ap of admitting it oh that's not
[2:46:58.280 --> 2:47:03.720]  real uh well here's uh you know uh here's the admission that they're using laptops to watch
[2:47:03.720 --> 2:47:09.160]  you at home without warrants oh i don't want to see that uh you know philadelphia news article i uh
[2:47:09.160 --> 2:47:16.680]  oh well here it is out of the sacramental b i'm bad mom i don't want to see it okay and so they
[2:47:16.680 --> 2:47:22.440]  give you free laptops and watch you at home they give you free software and then google watches you
[2:47:22.440 --> 2:47:27.640]  and listens to you and it's just kind of in the public domain but people can't believe it because
[2:47:27.640 --> 2:47:31.880]  if you're listening now you actually go check what i just said and find out it's true then you'd be
[2:47:31.880 --> 2:47:37.240]  freaked out you'd have to do something but justin beaver's on and then basketball's coming up and
[2:47:37.240 --> 2:47:43.880]  uh you know all of this is so wonderful uh that i mean we're going to get to see lebron james in
[2:47:43.880 --> 2:47:48.360]  miami i mean that's what's important not the government watching us in private corporations
[2:47:48.360 --> 2:47:54.040]  in schools watching kids at home without warrants that's not real justin beaver's real that elix
[2:47:54.040 --> 2:48:03.560]  jones guy you know he's crazy and and that's what they do that's how they respond to our facts
[2:48:03.560 --> 2:48:10.440]  and so the watson's and we've confirmed this many isps in europe just you got an isp you pay for
[2:48:10.440 --> 2:48:14.120]  the service they don't let you go to info wars dot com or prison planet dot com they're trying to
[2:48:14.120 --> 2:48:19.720]  contain the viral growth or they go to a train station and they government gives them quote free
[2:48:20.360 --> 2:48:25.080]  wireless that means you pay for it through taxes but now they can control it because it's free
[2:48:25.080 --> 2:48:30.600]  and oh can't go to info wars dot com because it has objectionable hate material
[2:48:30.600 --> 2:48:40.120]  so yes that uh for a couple weeks a few years ago right when australia was testing uh international
[2:48:40.120 --> 2:48:43.640]  filters uh they said they were going to put hundreds of thousands of sites on it and it
[2:48:43.640 --> 2:48:51.720]  turned out it was australian dentist and outside companies like uh outside of australia and websites
[2:48:51.720 --> 2:48:56.920]  like info wars dot com for a week or two you just couldn't get to it in new zealand or australia
[2:48:56.920 --> 2:49:02.600]  but i mean that's just what they do and they wanted to gauge and see the response so yes
[2:49:04.040 --> 2:49:11.640]  the globalists have noticed with psychology here's an example i saw an article uh where a
[2:49:11.640 --> 2:49:18.120]  washington state representative came back into the airport there in seattle in fact it's in my
[2:49:18.120 --> 2:49:22.440]  stack somewhere today i meant to get to it guys will you i'll never be able to find it in the 10
[2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:30.920]  stacks or so i have here we research uh washington state representative doesn't refuse pat down
[2:49:31.560 --> 2:49:34.920]  i just put it on screen so i'm giving the actual headline but that should pull it up
[2:49:34.920 --> 2:49:40.760]  but but but it said that she they they made her go in the scanner and then they said now we're
[2:49:40.760 --> 2:49:45.560]  going to pat you down so she submitted to that and see people keep telling me oh alex you know you
[2:49:45.560 --> 2:49:53.000]  just got to do the scanner the um the the microwave and then you won't have to do the pat down no they
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:58.520]  like to give you a supposed out first it's only some airports have scanners then do the scanner
[2:49:58.520 --> 2:50:01.880]  you won't have to do pat down now they're saying all airports will have the scanners and they're
[2:50:01.880 --> 2:50:09.480]  phasing them in and then you will have an additional pat down after it but but they give you an out
[2:50:09.480 --> 2:50:16.840]  to feel like you're a rat so you can run away and so it's always phased in so it's just like oh this
[2:50:16.840 --> 2:50:23.080]  isp doesn't let you go to info wars dot com or uh oh this wireless system doesn't let you or google
[2:50:23.080 --> 2:50:29.320]  puts up a warning or google d-list prison planet from google news or see they're just phasing it in
[2:50:29.320 --> 2:50:35.000]  phasing it in phasing it in and and they found the article throw it back up on screen state rep
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:42.280]  sysna objects to airport search demand and then they go on to say that she underwent the body scan
[2:50:42.280 --> 2:50:47.720]  as she was preparing to leave seattle to come okay she was leaving international airport sunday and
[2:50:47.720 --> 2:50:53.960]  was then required to undergo the pat down by transportation safety administration officials
[2:50:53.960 --> 2:50:58.440]  were always caught stealing money and demanding sex from women uh we'll be right back

[2:57:13.720 --> 2:57:18.920]  and to let you know that there's more coming where that came from your article on what on
[2:57:18.920 --> 2:57:25.160]  sackless the state automated child welfare oh yeah where you know it yeah no it actually says i
[2:57:25.160 --> 2:57:30.440]  read went to the documents that you link to they're actually creating a state license to have children
[2:57:30.440 --> 2:57:34.360]  which two years ago they got beaten court but california claimed that the state owns your
[2:57:34.360 --> 2:57:41.640]  children and and tried to ban homeschooling oh absolutely and i mean it's not already is banned
[2:57:41.640 --> 2:57:45.880]  and this is it throughout the united states of america thing it's already up and running
[2:57:45.880 --> 2:57:51.640]  it's just that all states are not interlinked and it's not up so good it's just so expensive
[2:57:51.640 --> 2:57:57.320]  to run everybody through it so now they're they're running people but only those they think have
[2:57:57.320 --> 2:58:02.440]  children that might be easy to sell or or get away for good from the parents and there is a
