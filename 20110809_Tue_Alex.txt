[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.160 --> 00:40.120]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.120 --> 00:46.440]  we are live ladies and gentlemen it of course is Tuesday the ninth day of
[00:46.440 --> 00:54.280]  August 2011 we're gonna be live here for the next three hours we have a guest
[00:54.280 --> 01:02.320]  joining us coming up at the start of the next segment who is a witness to
[01:02.320 --> 01:07.880]  multiple days of the riots and is right now there at the scene of the ongoing
[01:07.880 --> 01:13.720]  bedlam who will be joining us coming up at the start of the next segment then we
[01:13.720 --> 01:22.480]  have Paul Watson and Steve Watson both in England Steve in London joining us the
[01:22.480 --> 01:27.480]  eyewitnesses we've talked to report carjacking racial attacks that's pretty
[01:27.480 --> 01:32.440]  much what's going on here but under political correctness the media is
[01:32.440 --> 01:38.560]  basically refusing to cover that but as part of humiliation whites are made to
[01:38.560 --> 01:44.040]  strip their clothes off and hand them over to the black immigrants and the
[01:44.040 --> 01:48.200]  media occasionally shows it but does not point out what's happening and it's the
[01:48.200 --> 01:54.640]  fact that this type of tribal racial warfare is allowed and authorized really
[01:54.640 --> 02:00.200]  shows what the multiculturalist master plan is at the end of the day is to have
[02:00.200 --> 02:04.120]  certain groups that are quote protected and are allowed to carry out these type
[02:04.120 --> 02:12.600]  of actions and that's exactly what's going on in England also it's confirmed
[02:12.600 --> 02:16.720]  that starting on Sunday we're now into day three of these ongoing riots and
[02:16.720 --> 02:22.520]  spread all over England that the police stood down just like in the Los Angeles
[02:22.520 --> 02:37.400]  riots the police completely stood down and allowed the situation to ignite and
[02:37.400 --> 02:40.520]  you notice the rioters didn't attack government buildings this was not
[02:40.520 --> 02:47.440]  political they attacked Gucci handbag stores and electronic stores desperate
[02:47.440 --> 02:54.120]  for the bling because the giant welfare state checks because of currency
[02:54.120 --> 03:00.000]  devaluation aren't buying people enough swag and so they're rioting can you
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.600]  imagine what is going to happen all over the western world as we go into the
[03:05.600 --> 03:12.120]  controlled demolition of our economies when the upwards of 50 million people on
[03:12.120 --> 03:17.480]  food stamps and welfare here in the US alone still get their welfare checks
[03:17.480 --> 03:22.040]  you're still going to get them in the mail it's just that they're not going to
[03:22.040 --> 03:29.160]  buy what they previously did now in the United States in areas that have the
[03:29.160 --> 03:32.000]  second amendment you're gonna see increased crime but you're not going to
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.360]  see the mass rioting but I'm predicting now and you're already seeing it start
[03:36.360 --> 03:45.320]  that in Chicago in New York City and in the few other cities that are victim
[03:45.320 --> 03:51.120]  disarmament zones I am predicting that as we go deeper into this depression that
[03:51.120 --> 03:54.960]  in the next two years you are going to see those cities burned to the ground
[03:54.960 --> 04:01.400]  you're gonna see mass raping pillage murder and the government just like in
[04:01.400 --> 04:06.240]  Katrina is gonna pull back for a week and let the burning and rioting burn
[04:06.240 --> 04:11.000]  itself out and then is going to reenter the city and go into wealthy areas with
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.200]  citizens that have barricaded themselves in with illegal firearms defending
[04:15.200 --> 04:20.080]  themselves and you were going to have the book thrown at you so savagely that
[04:20.080 --> 04:23.120]  blood is gonna be running out your nose they're gonna beat you upside the head
[04:23.120 --> 04:27.720]  with the book they're gonna throw every charge at you under the sun and make an
[04:27.720 --> 04:33.440]  example of you you don't protect yourself just like the people in Britain you
[04:33.440 --> 04:36.960]  let your wives your husbands be drugged out and their clothes torn off their
[04:36.960 --> 04:46.280]  bodies as a sacrament to the multiculturalism as a religious right and
[04:46.280 --> 04:51.520]  you will flagellate yourselves with cat or nine tails on your back and the
[04:51.520 --> 04:56.080]  globalist will then set up a huge police state to harass law abiding citizens
[04:56.080 --> 04:59.920]  in response to the riots they allowed

[07:33.040 --> 07:38.320]  shelves warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history don't get
[07:38.320 --> 07:43.560]  caught unprepared when the crisis hits this book is only available at rising

[08:01.920 --> 08:19.480]  t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:19.480 --> 08:26.440]  ladies and gentlemen it is being reported that a giant bet was placed a
[08:26.440 --> 08:32.840]  month ago against the US dollar we know who's done that in the past George
[08:32.840 --> 08:38.240]  Soros and the Daily Mail and others are reporting that there are direct links to
[08:38.240 --> 08:44.160]  Soros and it's believed that he led the move to do that now of course S&P is
[08:44.160 --> 08:52.360]  the same criminal organization that knowingly knowingly certified that the
[08:52.360 --> 08:57.960]  triple-a rated derivative totally worthless garbage was pure triple-a gold
[08:57.960 --> 09:02.680]  and that was sold to the US government state governments private individuals
[09:02.680 --> 09:08.200]  pension funds you name it and now we are tied to that 1.5 quadrillion the
[09:08.200 --> 09:15.160]  American people 600 plus trillion supposedly that we owe now I don't
[09:15.160 --> 09:19.120]  usually agree with Michael Moore but he's challenged Obama to arrest the heads
[09:19.120 --> 09:24.960]  of S&P I actually talked about that with Webster Griffin Tarpley economist and
[09:24.960 --> 09:32.360]  historian yesterday because this is economic sabotage if the if the banks
[09:32.360 --> 09:37.440]  are being rated triple-a then S&P can't rate the US government less than triple
[09:37.440 --> 09:41.840]  a it is a fraud on its face the government can create credit out of
[09:41.840 --> 09:49.520]  nothing like Abraham Lincoln or JFK and so S&P is engaged in a financial form
[09:49.520 --> 09:55.200]  of terrorism along with the big banks that pay them to rate their garbage so
[09:55.200 --> 09:59.320]  the very groups that have maneuvered us into this position are now downgrading
[09:59.320 --> 10:03.080]  the United States to bankrupt counties cities and states when we are not
[10:03.080 --> 10:07.640]  bankrupt if we don't sign on to the fraudulent derivatives as Naomi Prince
[10:07.640 --> 10:11.720]  former managing director Goldman Sachs agreed yesterday as Ron Paul has said it
[10:11.720 --> 10:18.880]  if we say no to all of that fraudulent paper that is not our debts we are not
[10:18.880 --> 10:24.280]  in the red we are in the black big time we have incredible engines of
[10:24.280 --> 10:28.400]  prosperity we have still have a good infrastructure we still have great
[10:28.400 --> 10:32.920]  minds the United States has gone from the greatest creditor nation in the last
[10:32.920 --> 10:37.960]  few decades to the greatest debtor nation by fraud will give you the latest on
[10:37.960 --> 10:45.840]  gold turbo charging to 1,780 plus Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and others
[10:45.840 --> 10:50.560]  saying they believe is going to go to 2,500 an ounce in the next three months
[10:50.560 --> 10:57.240]  this is huge news we told you that was coming it's just incredible Fed forced
[10:57.240 --> 11:00.400]  to consider fresh stimulus we told you that was coming with the super Congress
[11:00.400 --> 11:04.320]  this is all been designed we've called it because we've seen them do this in
[11:04.320 --> 11:08.320]  first world old world and third world countries over and over again this is a
[11:08.320 --> 11:13.000]  standard operation we've got their playbook we know what they're going to
[11:13.000 --> 11:20.840]  call okay okay let me stop right there we've got joining us Paul Watson and
[11:20.840 --> 11:26.320]  Steve Watson at the bottom of the hour Steve is in London Paul Watson now just
[11:26.320 --> 11:30.280]  lives just north of London Stuart Rhodes is going to be joining us he's but his
[11:30.280 --> 11:34.400]  group's been called terrorists now but by the police for criticizing the
[11:34.400 --> 11:39.840]  corruption in court site Mark Moreno on Al Gore admitting that their entire
[11:39.840 --> 11:43.960]  global warming hoax is imploding and throwing fits he's going to be joining
[11:43.960 --> 11:50.560]  us the very end of the broadcast today now now joining us from Brixton South
[11:50.560 --> 11:55.840]  London is Patrick Henningson and he's also going to be on RT later today he is
[11:55.840 --> 11:59.520]  an amazing documentary filmmaker he's provided us with amazing footage that
[11:59.520 --> 12:05.080]  we've used covering Copenhagen event he's reported for us from there he's a
[12:05.080 --> 12:10.200]  graduate of Cal Poly SLO in California with over a decades experience of public
[12:10.200 --> 12:15.400]  relations and corporate communications he lives in the UK and he joins us and
[12:15.400 --> 12:21.120]  will also give you his website but he had the courage to spend the last two
[12:21.120 --> 12:25.160]  and a half days in the middle of it and he can confirm and we'll put the map up
[12:25.160 --> 12:31.080]  for prisonplanet.tv viewers of the confirmed fires riots women jumping
[12:31.080 --> 12:36.240]  out of burning buildings carjackings and he witnessed it and yes the photos
[12:36.240 --> 12:40.880]  are confirmed much of this started as racial attacks on white people whites
[12:40.880 --> 12:44.760]  being stripped down naked as a form of humiliation and the politically correct
[12:44.760 --> 12:48.480]  media is now being forced to report on it this is getting more and more insane
[12:48.480 --> 12:54.080]  by the minute this is political correctness gone wild and joining us is
[12:54.080 --> 13:00.000]  Patrick Henningson from South London Brixton the epicenter of the situation
[13:00.000 --> 13:07.680]  that's now spread all over England in the southern part there of the UK will
[13:07.680 --> 13:13.360]  put again put that map back up on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers Patrick
[13:13.360 --> 13:20.000]  Henningson thank you for joining us okay break down why why you went down
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.040]  obviously you're a reporter but I think your courage to go be in the middle of
[13:24.040 --> 13:30.080]  this melee and how it all started and what you witnessed well it wasn't so
[13:30.080 --> 13:36.400]  much I was looking to be in the middle of it but I live in Brixton so it was
[13:36.400 --> 13:43.040]  unavoidable basically but I spent most of Sunday night were barricaded in a pub
[13:43.040 --> 13:49.240]  on Stockwell Road and saw a number of gangs of youths putting things into the
[13:49.240 --> 13:54.080]  road to barricade the road in order to stop vehicles and attempt a series of
[13:54.080 --> 13:59.040]  carjackings pulling people out of their vehicles are trying to successfully in
[13:59.040 --> 14:03.280]  one case and also beating passersby who were trying to get away from the riots
[14:03.280 --> 14:08.040]  in Central Brixton which was on Sunday late Sunday evening early Monday
[14:08.040 --> 14:12.960]  morning okay we didn't have time to talk much beforehand so I I was just
[14:12.960 --> 14:16.200]  imagining as a reporter that you went down to cover it but you were actually
[14:16.200 --> 14:22.200]  barricaded in please continue with any detail you've got of the type of car
[14:22.200 --> 14:26.440]  jacking that you witnessed and we're seeing the photos of whites being
[14:26.440 --> 14:29.960]  stripped down naked in fact if you guys go to the Daily Mail we can show folks
[14:29.960 --> 14:34.680]  that it's linked on Drudge Report and and reportedly it started as racial
[14:34.680 --> 14:40.920]  attacks and now that it's expanded out to both black hoodlums and white hoodlums
[14:40.920 --> 14:44.560]  some of the Western media has tried to spin it that it's Muslims but Paul
[14:44.560 --> 14:49.000]  Watson Steve Watson say they haven't seen Muslims involved yeah well this is a
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.880]  very odd chain of events that started this ball rolling the first one was in
[14:53.880 --> 14:59.000]  Tottenham that was on Saturday evening that was a demonstration a public
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.800]  demonstration against a local resident who had been shot fatally by the local
[15:03.800 --> 15:10.400]  Metropolitan Police allegedly in some sort of a gun sting now that
[15:10.400 --> 15:14.480]  demonstration went a bit wrong and turned into full-scale riots on Saturday
[15:14.480 --> 15:19.480]  night on Sunday Brixton had its annual carnival which is called the Brixton
[15:19.480 --> 15:24.080]  Splash the 30,000 people in attendance now mind you Brixton is a site of the
[15:24.080 --> 15:31.480]  1981 riots which was the UK's equivalent to the Watts Los Angeles riots in the
[15:31.480 --> 15:35.800]  80s and also earlier in the late 60s so it's the Brixton has always been a
[15:35.800 --> 15:41.360]  flashpoint for the social unrest or especially for racial tension as a
[15:41.360 --> 15:46.520]  majority of the area is the Afro-Caribbean and although it's very
[15:46.520 --> 15:52.880]  multicultural and very integrated there is an undercurrent from before of some
[15:52.880 --> 15:59.440]  kind of ethnic unrest between neighbors and so forth well people need to stop
[15:59.440 --> 16:04.840]  being so passive guns or no guns I couldn't control myself if people are
[16:04.840 --> 16:08.080]  out carjacking folks and I was even disarmed I would just put nails through
[16:08.080 --> 16:11.600]  baseball bats and go to town I mean this type of stuff is the police won't
[16:11.600 --> 16:15.000]  protect the people first they take your guns then they won't protect you you
[16:15.000 --> 16:19.280]  guys barricaded yourself in a bar but so you are confirming that these are
[16:19.280 --> 16:25.960]  basically a race-war style attack is how this began well it began as a anti-
[16:25.960 --> 16:34.120]  police demonstration the Brixton the Brixton riots were what I call the new
[16:34.120 --> 16:38.500]  riot which is the retail riot basically these are just young kids between the
[16:38.500 --> 16:44.320]  age of 12 and 20 out in mass using their blackberries to communicate and to move
[16:44.320 --> 16:49.760]  in groups and to hit specific targets at the same time they've called the police
[16:49.760 --> 16:54.760]  on their back deals over and over and over again okay so it's so correct me it's
[16:54.760 --> 16:57.640]  started in that so there's a multifaceted and that's borne out by the
[16:57.640 --> 17:04.160]  news it started as a police demonstration then a racial racially
[17:04.160 --> 17:09.600]  motivated style attack and then it metastasized into and that's what it
[17:09.600 --> 17:15.600]  shows now groups of all colors out just looting trinkets and goodies yeah
[17:15.600 --> 17:21.240]  they basically any criminal opportunists but unfortunately and it probably has
[17:21.240 --> 17:28.640]  less to do with the ethnicity of the culprits and more to do with the economic in the educational
[17:28.640 --> 17:32.680]  disintegration which has taken place in this country under 10 years of Tony
[17:32.680 --> 17:37.480]  Blair's government that's another story but the majority of the Brixton
[17:37.480 --> 17:43.640]  riots 99.9% were Afro-Caribbean of course any police officer that will that
[17:43.640 --> 17:49.200]  will come down in public on a young black man could face another mob on his
[17:49.200 --> 17:53.160]  back and could create then you know another instance of the political
[17:53.160 --> 17:57.400]  correctness gone wrong you have actually hit the nail on that Alex that is one
[17:57.400 --> 18:04.200]  of the reasons why communities and emergency services and police and
[18:04.200 --> 18:08.240]  everyone's got their hands tied everyone except these kids who are absolutely
[18:08.240 --> 18:13.640]  running wild who by the way Alex who are being directed by their higher-ups in
[18:13.640 --> 18:19.080]  gangs who are going out hitting retail stuff to order being told what to get
[18:19.080 --> 18:23.320]  where to get it and this has all been coordinated up the gang chain that's now
[18:23.320 --> 18:26.520]  by the way everything you're saying has been confirmed it's all within just a
[18:26.520 --> 18:32.160]  few hours was for sale on eBay and other places online and they could follow the
[18:32.160 --> 18:36.360]  Twitter as the gang bosses direct them they could instantly follow that back to
[18:36.360 --> 18:41.160]  its geo location on its computer or phone and arrest these people but of
[18:41.160 --> 18:45.960]  course they don't in every case the the 7-7 bombers run by a known member mr.

[18:53.640 --> 18:57.440]  stand down and now the reports are getting from Steve Watson is this is
[18:57.440 --> 19:01.080]  going to be used against the general public Steve Watson years ago taken as
[19:01.080 --> 19:05.160]  you know very beautiful girlfriend out to dinner the police come over and ask
[19:05.160 --> 19:08.560]  you questions look at your ID ask if you're a terrorist but they don't dare
[19:08.560 --> 19:13.080]  mess with the gangbangers so they use the crime as a pretext to then come and
[19:13.080 --> 19:17.160]  dominate the general public and the police are trained to only alert on
[19:17.160 --> 19:22.840]  law-abiding type people is that true yep that's true and there's a few results
[19:22.840 --> 19:27.080]  that are gonna come out of this ballot so tell you I'll make a prediction one in
[19:27.080 --> 19:31.280]  the media in the next week after when this is calmed down if it calms down it's
[19:31.280 --> 19:35.360]  gonna be a divide between those who want more security and more police on the
[19:35.360 --> 19:39.560]  ground and heavier law enforcement capability and those who are pro
[19:39.560 --> 19:44.200]  community and are wanting to actually address the causes of the illness rather
[19:44.200 --> 19:48.160]  than the symptoms Patrick I know you've got to go you've got to get down to the

[24:23.400 --> 24:28.640]  divide and conquer us but all over the country including the mayor of
[24:28.640 --> 24:35.120]  Philadelphia and others are having to come out and you know tell black youth
[24:35.120 --> 24:41.160]  to stop rioting to stop engaging in racial attacks and it is it is we are
[24:41.160 --> 24:45.240]  so politically correct in the West now that that that the people doing this
[24:45.240 --> 24:49.960]  think it's their right to pull over a family jerk people out of the car strip
[24:49.960 --> 24:55.080]  their clothes off and then the media the British media the UK media that will
[24:55.080 --> 25:00.480]  report on this is being demonized by other media okay this is very very
[25:00.480 --> 25:04.680]  serious that's one reason if it's not a provocateur action that the police are
[25:04.680 --> 25:09.320]  standing down they are that afraid ladies and gentlemen and then of course the
[25:09.320 --> 25:13.440]  higher-level social engineers they know what they're doing they'll just use this
[25:13.440 --> 25:18.640]  to take everybody's rights so this is very very dangerous hundreds of riots
[25:18.640 --> 25:24.600]  and lootings and attacks now talking to Patrick Henningson who is a reporter of
[25:24.600 --> 25:30.200]  of long renowned doing a great job reporting for us from Copenhagen at the
[25:30.200 --> 25:35.720]  UN summit an impeccable source Patrick going back because I brought in the
[25:35.720 --> 25:39.960]  break I said what color were the people being drugged out of the cars and you
[25:39.960 --> 25:48.080]  told us please repeat on record exactly what you witnessed yeah but I did
[25:48.080 --> 25:55.560]  witness white male page 30 was this car was stopped street was barricaded with
[25:55.560 --> 26:01.240]  wheelie bins or rubbish bins and he's tempted to pull out of the car and
[26:01.240 --> 26:06.760]  another passers-by came he was beaten by six or seven men and left there in the
[26:06.760 --> 26:12.720]  rain as they as they ran up the street now these could have been anybody but it
[26:12.720 --> 26:17.640]  just happened to be there is a color divide in Brixton and most of the
[26:17.640 --> 26:22.480]  looters and rioters were young black males but it's a bigger problem that as
[26:22.480 --> 26:26.960]  you well know this is a massive problem however it's going to turn into a
[26:26.960 --> 26:30.760]  racial divide is already tension on the streets you can feel it when you're
[26:30.760 --> 26:34.880]  walking down to Brixton half the people are saying in their head who's
[26:34.880 --> 26:38.680]  responsible for this the other half of thinking why are they looking at me like
[26:38.680 --> 26:44.800]  that and that's only going to get worse so I can only say that this is a big
[26:44.800 --> 26:49.400]  warning shot out to the government to David Cameron and to Tony Blair before
[26:49.400 --> 26:53.800]  him who were very very interested in bombing the innocent people of Libya
[26:53.800 --> 26:58.920]  spending their money and their attention plundering Iraq and Afghanistan and
[26:58.920 --> 27:03.200]  they've taken their eye off the ball for about 10 or 12 years maybe maybe 20
[27:03.200 --> 27:09.640]  years well it turns out Tony Blair had a long-term secret immigration plan to
[27:09.640 --> 27:14.600]  actually bring the illegals in as a political constituency but but to be
[27:14.600 --> 27:17.840]  specific unless I misheard you because I want this on record Patrick Ennickson
[27:17.840 --> 27:24.480]  you're saying you did witness barricades black males attempting to pull
[27:24.480 --> 27:28.040]  people out of cars and successfully pulling a white male out and beating
[27:28.040 --> 27:32.680]  them did you witness black males doing that to a white male well I didn't see
[27:32.680 --> 27:36.560]  the color of the guy in the car who I I couldn't see if they had jumped in the
[27:36.560 --> 27:41.320]  car or not but I did see the person who was trying to help them was a white male
[27:41.320 --> 27:46.960]  and he was beaten as a result of his intervention now it was such a it was
[27:46.960 --> 27:50.320]  such a situation that you couldn't even go out in the street to help the person
[27:50.320 --> 27:53.320]  because no no I understand but he was beaten by the white man was beaten by
[27:53.320 --> 28:01.440]  what color people gang of seven or eight Afro Caribbean you know young boys
[28:01.440 --> 28:05.280]  yeah I mean that that's how politically correct we've all gotten myself
[28:05.280 --> 28:08.840]  included that I had to interrogate you to even get you to say it and I'm not
[28:08.840 --> 28:12.600]  and I'm not criticizing you Patrick I understand the fact that we all want to
[28:12.600 --> 28:17.520]  get along but the only way we're gonna stop this is by decrying it and that's
[28:17.520 --> 28:21.880]  why I've protested people like the Ku Klux Klan but the fact that we have
[28:21.880 --> 28:26.280]  black groups more and more thinking it's their right to beat the daylights out
[28:26.280 --> 28:30.760]  of or Rob white people is wrong and at the end of the day it's gonna end up
[28:30.760 --> 28:34.680]  hurting black folks what do you say to that I agree you know and you know the
[28:34.680 --> 28:38.840]  politicians don't need to be telling the black communities to tell their
[28:38.840 --> 28:46.240]  children to not engage in this kind of crime to parents the families of the
[28:46.240 --> 28:49.960]  with of these children in the black community need to take responsibility
[28:49.960 --> 28:54.720]  which they're clearly not at 2 a.m. if your kids out running around whether
[28:54.720 --> 28:59.920]  it's police helicopters overhead obviously you're not doing anything near a
[28:59.920 --> 29:04.600]  job of parenting and maybe that's not their fault maybe it is maybe most of
[29:04.600 --> 29:09.280]  single parents which they are but you have a complete breakdown within the
[29:09.280 --> 29:15.120]  black community of any sort of form of control and that's not everybody
[29:15.120 --> 29:18.600]  obviously but we're talking about a significant amount of young kids in
[29:18.600 --> 29:23.600]  closing in closing absolutely give us your website of Patrick Henningson our

[33:09.040 --> 33:12.400]  Alex Jones show
[33:14.120 --> 33:18.680]  ladies and gentlemen I have been tracking what's happening in the UK since
[33:18.680 --> 33:22.880]  Sunday I've seen the videos on YouTube that are not on the news some of the
[33:22.880 --> 33:26.920]  photos and videos are coming out buildings with white people in them
[33:26.920 --> 33:33.280]  shed on fire white women jumping out of burning buildings to police and
[33:33.280 --> 33:38.120]  firemen whites being drug out of cars being beaten with an inch of their life
[33:38.120 --> 33:43.520]  whites made to strip down naked and you have black immigrants their clothes I
[33:43.520 --> 33:48.480]  mean imagine if white people were going around pulling black people out of
[33:48.480 --> 33:53.040]  cars and beating them up and burning their houses down I mean the average Brit is
[33:53.040 --> 33:58.000]  a politically correct anti-white worshiper of political correctness I
[33:58.000 --> 34:03.520]  mean I know a lot of Brits they are seized by self-loathing and hate they
[34:03.520 --> 34:08.760]  are worshippers of anything non-European and this is what they're now going to
[34:08.760 --> 34:13.880]  get now on the other end I don't like the globalist who are using all of this to
[34:13.880 --> 34:18.200]  get us at each other's throats while engaging in soft kill eugenics against
[34:18.200 --> 34:25.600]  blacks Hispanics Asians whites everybody I know it's programming and I
[34:25.600 --> 34:30.040]  understand that it's it's it's what the social engineers the cultural Marxists
[34:30.040 --> 34:34.960]  that's what they call themselves do is they bring in groups they get them
[34:34.960 --> 34:38.760]  dependent they wait for society to degenerate and then they use these
[34:38.760 --> 34:44.800]  groups as weapons and you better believe ladies and gentlemen you had better
[34:44.800 --> 34:54.320]  believe and you had better know and understand that upwards as half the
[34:54.320 --> 34:57.760]  population of the US survives off a government paycheck whether it's social
[34:57.760 --> 35:02.640]  security that matter of you paid into it the government now controls you upwards
[35:02.640 --> 35:07.360]  50 million they say it's 45.9 million on food stamps there's another four or five
[35:07.360 --> 35:10.840]  million that are on supplemental there's other forms of state it's probably more
[35:10.840 --> 35:15.960]  than 50 million on food stamps that's 50 million people every day in a digital
[35:15.960 --> 35:24.880]  food line a digital soup line this country is degenerating and Madison
[35:24.880 --> 35:32.800]  Avenue MTV culture has sold an idea of gangsterism and crime and the young
[35:32.800 --> 35:37.240]  white kids dressed like gangsters and festoon themselves in the outfits and
[35:37.240 --> 35:41.680]  have their pants hanging down over their hind ends saying I'm a punk I'm a
[35:41.680 --> 35:48.040]  sex slave that's what that means from prison the young males try to dress and
[35:48.040 --> 35:51.920]  act like gangsters as part of their manhood to scare people most of them
[35:51.920 --> 35:57.040]  are completely cowardly jellyfish whites Hispanics blacks you look at the youth
[35:57.040 --> 36:02.320]  you go to any restaurant any store more than half of them look like absolute
[36:02.320 --> 36:09.480]  mentally deranged brain damaged fools and what's going to happen is that more
[36:09.480 --> 36:12.760]  and more this is going to happen in the US and they're going to die because some
[36:12.760 --> 36:16.000]  of us are real men we're not playing games we got our second amendment our
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.520]  ancestors fought for it we're not slaves the Queen of England and we're not
[36:19.520 --> 36:24.560]  going along with it okay and you notice that's why the gangbangers in Chicago
[36:24.560 --> 36:28.360]  New York LA places where they've really restricted the second amendment where
[36:28.360 --> 36:33.680]  the public can't defend themselves or politically correct effeminate men you
[36:33.680 --> 36:39.240]  know are just cowering in fear that it's the type of places where people are
[36:39.240 --> 36:43.840]  fed on indiscriminately I mean let me tell you something I wouldn't need a
[36:43.840 --> 36:47.760]  gun if a group of people are trying to attack me you get five six people
[36:47.760 --> 36:51.640]  attacking you folks that's when Tyrannosaurus Rex comes out that's when a
[36:51.640 --> 36:55.520]  big can of you know what gets opened up and now I'm talking about anybody if
[36:55.520 --> 36:58.960]  you're not in touch with your instincts ladies and gentlemen a little bitty
[36:58.960 --> 37:04.920]  raccoon if it's cornered can beat up Mike Tyson because it's cornered believe
[37:04.920 --> 37:08.400]  me raccoons kill big hunting dogs they'll get them in the water grab their
[37:08.400 --> 37:13.000]  ears push them down any of us could act like a raccoon when cornered and I don't
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.240]  know how you've lost your fight how you've lost your guts how people could
[37:17.240 --> 37:22.680]  sit there and let people beat them up it is pathetic I've watched these videos of
[37:22.680 --> 37:26.560]  these cowardly brits just sit there and pull their clothes off do whatever
[37:26.560 --> 37:29.820]  they're told and I've been there I've been racially attacked growing up in
[37:29.820 --> 37:34.320]  Dallas and let me tell you something I gave as good as I got and bullies don't
[37:34.320 --> 37:39.320]  like it even in the end if they start winning if they get hurt you by the way
[37:39.320 --> 37:43.880]  ladies and gentlemen you don't need a gun to kill somebody all you got to have
[37:43.880 --> 37:49.600]  is the will I'm sorry I just it really freaks me out to watch how domesticated
[37:49.600 --> 37:55.040]  people have got and it really gets my blood out now that said I don't know
[37:55.040 --> 38:00.400]  with Watson on Skype and Ted Anderson on them on the sat line if we can play
[38:00.400 --> 38:06.700]  that clip of a green span are we able to play that we got it okay I'm gonna get
[38:06.700 --> 38:11.440]  back into the riots later in all the details but the fact that the media
[38:11.440 --> 38:16.240]  predominantly some will cover it will not get into the fact that this is
[38:16.240 --> 38:20.800]  racial ladies and gentlemen I get mad when I hear about the Klan lynching
[38:20.800 --> 38:24.080]  some black person pulling them over on the side of the road and doing it I get
[38:24.080 --> 38:27.240]  mad at people being cornered and outnumbered that's why I've spoke out
[38:27.240 --> 38:31.600]  against it but I'm sick of some black people out there that think it's their
[38:31.600 --> 38:35.800]  right to talk about white people like we're not human beings and like we did
[38:35.800 --> 38:40.040]  something to you most white people ancestors were slaves if you knew your
[38:40.040 --> 38:43.200]  stinking history of course it's not just black folks that obviously don't know
[38:43.200 --> 38:47.160]  their history we're taught all this black history stuff to get us at each
[38:47.160 --> 38:50.480]  other's throats and what you're taught in that history is not the full history
[38:50.480 --> 38:58.120]  and I'm sick of it and I'm tired of it and I'm tired of the bankers using this
[38:58.120 --> 39:02.120]  system to get everybody at each other's throats now I'm going to Watson Steve
[39:02.120 --> 39:07.160]  Watson Paul Watson first Paul Watson here in a moment but the economy is a
[39:07.160 --> 39:13.440]  whole nother subject a whole nother subject now here is JP Morgan says gold
[39:13.440 --> 39:22.880]  may jump $2,500 an ounce by year's end and it says JP Morgan said on Monday it
[39:22.880 --> 39:28.720]  expects spot gold prices to climb to $2,500 an ounce or higher okay they
[39:28.720 --> 39:38.560]  expect it to go even higher this is CNBC you understand what I just read to you
[39:38.560 --> 39:43.640]  they they are telling and they're at the top of the pyramid in the control
[39:43.640 --> 39:47.440]  system they're saying that they are saying it's going to go that high or
[39:47.440 --> 39:52.560]  higher that officials will meet today after the unprecedented downgrades the
[39:52.560 --> 39:56.540]  US top credit shook investor confidence and in another article I have
[39:56.540 --> 40:04.480]  dealing with this out of CBC Canada they talk to the JP Morgan analysts they
[40:04.480 --> 40:09.520]  say because of inflation and dollar devaluation they're finally being
[40:09.520 --> 40:13.840]  honest your gas prices aren't really going up your dollar is worse less
[40:13.840 --> 40:17.200]  they're paying the same they were paying five years ago in Switzerland for
[40:17.200 --> 40:21.160]  for gasoline or petrol you're paying higher because your currencies devalued
[40:21.160 --> 40:28.440]  it's our dollars becoming like the peso all right I got to go to the Watson's here
[40:28.440 --> 40:37.520]  gold is top 1,780 is investors seek safe haven Soros reportedly somebody
[40:37.520 --> 40:41.880]  made $10 million off that knowing that S&P was gonna downgrade Michael Moore I
[40:41.880 --> 40:47.360]  hardly ever agree with says show some guts arrest S&P head to Obama S&P is
[40:47.360 --> 40:51.960]  one of the groups at Bank World Obama we're gonna be breaking all that down
[40:51.960 --> 40:55.640]  but right now I wanted to briefly and he'll check in with us later in the
[40:55.640 --> 41:02.040]  in the in the broadcast in this guest-studded program today I want to
[41:02.040 --> 41:07.760]  bring Ted Anderson up to to break down what we're seeing Ted what does it
[41:07.760 --> 41:14.440]  signify to have JP Morgan Chase coming out and saying it that they're saying
[41:14.440 --> 41:21.360]  they believe it will hit 2,500 or higher revising their 1,800 mark that they
[41:21.360 --> 41:23.960]  predicted for the end of the year remember we were cooks to say gold
[41:23.960 --> 41:28.800]  would hit 500 or 800 or 1,000 or 1,500 now once it's broken through the
[41:28.800 --> 41:35.720]  psychological level of 1,700 Ted 2,500 and above what in Hades is going on here
[41:35.720 --> 41:40.480]  well I mean obviously a lot of money being printed and JP Morgan was one of
[41:40.480 --> 41:44.640]  the founders of the Federal Reserve System back in 1913 I think they're in
[41:44.640 --> 41:48.280]  the know what they're doing is they're talking about printing more money more
[41:48.280 --> 41:52.000]  stimulus as a matter of fact and there's a lot of pressure on the Fed right now
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.800]  Alex I've never seen so many headlines about gold when I was just browsing this
[41:56.800 --> 42:00.680]  morning it's terrifying last night I didn't even sleep I was watching the
[42:00.680 --> 42:06.280]  Asian markets gold hitting up there like you said in that 1780 range and now
[42:06.280 --> 42:12.120]  we're sitting here at 1754 60 high in New York I mean I gotta tell you right now
[42:12.120 --> 42:17.880]  it's it's been one amazing roller coaster ride here at Midas Resources and
[42:17.880 --> 42:21.520]  I'm sure that's happening in every gold dealer out in the entire United States
[42:21.520 --> 42:25.160]  I mean it's like the trading floor the phones are ringing people are writing
[42:25.160 --> 42:28.960]  orders I people are racing the treasuries right now because they're
[42:28.960 --> 42:32.680]  driving up the value and driving down the yield because they're afraid that
[42:32.680 --> 42:36.960]  that's one of the few safe havens that they can go to meanwhile Vietnam is
[42:36.960 --> 42:42.240]  looking at picking up for five tons five metric tons of gold that's the first
[42:42.240 --> 42:46.960]  every major University I look at Ted like UT bought half a billion than
[42:46.960 --> 42:51.360]  another billion then reportedly another 500 million that's two billion the last
[42:51.360 --> 42:55.840]  year of gold quietly I mean that's the University of Texas they're all jumping
[42:55.840 --> 43:00.080]  their dollars and getting into gold and again we're the bad guys for being
[43:00.080 --> 43:03.760]  right Ted we totally called this a decade ago when they got rid of glass
[43:03.760 --> 43:07.160]  stiggle we knew we knew the riding on the wall yeah that's right and I and
[43:07.160 --> 43:11.040]  thank thank God that our people that listen to this show are buying gold
[43:11.040 --> 43:16.200]  because they're gonna be doing okay when everybody else has fallen apart and
[43:16.200 --> 43:20.360]  then we'll get that line somebody may come steal it over your dead body yeah
[43:20.360 --> 43:23.600]  there's nothing perfect in this world why even have children if you think the
[43:23.600 --> 43:26.800]  government might try to take them someday the whole point is when things
[43:26.800 --> 43:30.360]  get bad have more children when things get bad fight harder when things get
[43:30.360 --> 43:34.000]  bad get up off your hind ends stop watching dancing with the stars and
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.800]  American Idol and all this crud and get awake to what's going on get a second
[43:38.800 --> 43:42.520]  job start saving money start getting yourself ready buy guns because I'm
[43:42.520 --> 43:46.400]  telling you folks our chances are slim to none that we're not going into a
[43:46.400 --> 43:50.960]  total collapse road warrior situation that these bankers have set up when they
[43:50.960 --> 43:55.040]  had a hurricane three or four years ago hit Houston and flooded out all the way
[43:55.040 --> 43:59.080]  up at our ranch in northeast Texas there were marauding groups predominantly of
[43:59.080 --> 44:02.400]  illegal aliens robbing everybody they could and quite a bit of them got shot
[44:02.400 --> 44:06.080]  that's the only thing that turned it back when when 5 million illegal aliens
[44:06.080 --> 44:09.200]  got flushed out of there and what I'm telling you is ladies and gentlemen as
[44:09.200 --> 44:14.760]  society continues to degenerate they we're in trouble Ted look at the riots
[44:14.760 --> 44:19.240]  and looting and racial attacks starting everywhere this has been the
[44:19.240 --> 44:22.960]  globalist plan what happens when the welfare checks have been devalued
[44:22.960 --> 44:29.720]  through currency devaluation and they don't buy this the things that these
[44:29.720 --> 44:34.120]  people need what's gonna happen well it's gonna be hunting time and what's
[44:34.120 --> 44:37.600]  the most weak pathetic creature in the West pathetic chicken-necked white
[44:37.600 --> 44:41.680]  people we are on the dinner table yeah I know you're right about that and one
[44:41.680 --> 44:45.320]  thing for sure Alex if people keep their money in paper you're gonna have your
[44:45.320 --> 44:49.440]  money stolen from you through inflation and the printing press because right
[44:49.440 --> 44:52.800]  now that's what they're turning to they're looking for the Fed to pour the
[44:52.800 --> 44:56.840]  printing press on and we're looking at the type of situation that why my
[44:56.840 --> 45:01.400]  republic was looking at and also Argentina Brazil Mexico I mean the list
[45:01.400 --> 45:05.440]  goes on and on Ted I'll go back as society to generate people break into
[45:05.440 --> 45:10.040]  gangs look at prisons this is gang mentality this isn't gonna be the
[45:10.040 --> 45:14.440]  depression in the in the 30s when most people were agrarian and self-sufficient
[45:14.440 --> 45:18.280]  and Christian regardless of what color they were Pete we are an immoral
[45:18.280 --> 45:23.920]  decadent gang driven society with 50 years of a prison culture breeding a
[45:23.920 --> 45:28.000]  gang mentality the police are a gang all the other groups are gangs we are
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.960]  gonna descend into hell Ted I'm sorry I'm just telling folks now what I really
[45:31.960 --> 45:37.080]  think we I mean I am dug in with firearms and food I'm ready well don't
[45:37.080 --> 45:40.780]  tread on me that's all I got to say the whole world is looking at it that way
[45:40.780 --> 45:45.160]  Alex you see nations now moving into gold and moving away from the US currency
[45:45.160 --> 45:49.720]  and we lived on their money we borrowed it from China in these places like this
[45:49.720 --> 45:54.440]  and that's what created our prosperity all through the 1980s and now we're
[45:54.440 --> 45:58.280]  paying for it because we're in debt up to our ears and we're turning the Federal
[45:58.280 --> 46:02.280]  Reserve system to print more money to so we can service the interest on the
[46:02.280 --> 46:06.520]  past absolutely Ted this in now police lose control of London streets for
[46:06.520 --> 46:11.600]  third night riots spread across you UK hundreds of them burnings racial attacks
[46:11.600 --> 46:18.560]  mass burning riots rioters rob people on street forced them to strip naked it
[46:18.560 --> 46:23.160]  just goes on and on and on they're talking about martial law that's on
[46:23.160 --> 46:27.320]  prisonplanet.com women jumping out of burning buildings and Ted we ain't
[46:27.320 --> 46:32.960]  seen nothing yet it's even been in mainstream news that the real rich have
[46:32.960 --> 46:37.360]  all been moving to mountain redoubts to the Cook Islands to the middle of
[46:37.360 --> 46:44.400]  nowhere to the upland jungles of Asia the elites have all been pulling out to
[46:44.400 --> 46:49.600]  Wyoming Montana heavily armed building bunkers because they know they've
[46:49.600 --> 46:53.320]  engineered the total collapse they're gonna let us all basically burn out and
[46:53.320 --> 46:58.200]  and then beg for a police state to come in behind it people need to get gold and
[46:58.200 --> 47:03.520]  silver now before it is $2,500 an ounce Ted tell because here's the good news
[47:03.520 --> 47:06.640]  you've been buying the gold when it's lower the gold and silver you've got
[47:06.640 --> 47:10.760]  right now when did you purchase most of that how big of a discount are you
[47:10.760 --> 47:14.800]  passing on to people right now and give folks today's gold and silver offer then
[47:14.800 --> 47:18.360]  we're going to Paul Watson via video Skype and Steve Watson via telephone
[47:18.360 --> 47:25.320]  from the center of airstrip one the UK with their lovely multicultural riots
[47:25.320 --> 47:28.960]  go ahead well okay real quick I mean we just bought it when the gold was sitting
[47:28.960 --> 47:34.200]  in the high 1690s silver was you know sitting there at that 37 38 dollar range
[47:34.200 --> 47:40.160]  presently right now British sovereigns are a 378 Franks are at 381 small pieces
[47:40.160 --> 47:44.440]  of gold are things that you can put into your shoe and walk away with I mean it's
[47:44.440 --> 47:48.240]  so important have little small pieces of gold the other thing you can get into
[47:48.240 --> 47:53.640]  right now is the US Eagle that's a good coin as well they're sitting right now at
[47:53.640 --> 47:58.680]  a price hang on just a second I just want to make sure I'm there it is 1869 78 I
[47:58.680 --> 48:04.160]  really recommend us the bags of survival bags of dimes right now they're at 28
[48:04.160 --> 48:07.960]  hundred and thirty one dollars I mean there's just a an array of different
[48:07.960 --> 48:12.200]  things I think that's having your money in US currency right now is a bad
[48:12.200 --> 48:17.200]  mistake and in anybody's portfolio I mean at least get to the Swiss Frank or
[48:17.200 --> 48:21.240]  something but I would suggest they have golden silver because golden silver has
[48:21.240 --> 48:26.240]  been money for 6,000 years and the banking system cannot mess with it
[48:26.240 --> 48:30.640]  you're gonna have something that will hold value and it's had held value for
[48:30.640 --> 48:34.480]  so many years that you know it's outside of their control absolutely and
[48:34.480 --> 48:38.560]  Ted for folks to get the big discounts and I know you're gonna be going up in
[48:38.560 --> 48:43.840]  in prices here soon on the silver it's still $88 for two silver dollars free
[48:43.840 --> 48:47.680]  shipping a free book and a video you can't get two silver dollars for 88 out
[48:47.680 --> 48:51.880]  there delivered I mean I mean there's no way that deal still going about to go

[49:46.120 --> 49:50.480]  like the second coming of Valhalla and we also have all sorts of racial attacks
[49:50.480 --> 49:53.120]  and rioting breaking out across the United States we're going to be
[49:53.120 --> 49:57.160]  covering joining us from just north of London Paul Joseph Watson his brother
[49:57.160 --> 50:00.760]  from London coming up sorry to get you on late here Paul got stuck with
[50:00.760 --> 50:04.400]  Hennison earlier very interesting intel on him being barricaded in the pub and
[50:04.400 --> 50:08.440]  watching the racial attacks we're going to break here but what's coming up Paul

[54:06.240 --> 54:14.040]  you know jaren somebody tried to rob him in his car a while back and he beat
[54:14.040 --> 54:19.000]  him up and probably has to go to court for the guy for sentencing and one of
[54:19.000 --> 54:24.240]  our crew members wife was in Lubbock and that was an attempted basically racial
[54:24.240 --> 54:28.080]  carjacking I mean we tell you folks everybody's wives especially need to
[54:28.080 --> 54:32.360]  be packing heat you keep your car doors locked and somebody tries to break in
[54:32.360 --> 54:37.840]  you grease them and unfortunately in the UK and there's riots going on
[54:37.840 --> 54:43.400]  everywhere you really don't have a recourse instead of going absolutely
[54:43.400 --> 54:47.520]  eight with a baseball bat or a I guess you can get ahold of a sword or something
[54:47.520 --> 54:52.120]  but people got to learn to defend themselves it's this attitude it's like
[54:52.120 --> 54:54.760]  grizzly bears are coming in now and eating people because folks aren't
[54:54.760 --> 54:58.600]  hunting them anymore polar bears are coming in eating people wolves coyotes
[54:58.600 --> 55:02.120]  are killing folks all the time now because we're domesticated modern
[55:02.120 --> 55:06.440]  ninnies and gangs and criminals are gonna feed on us Steve Watson coming up
[55:06.440 --> 55:10.400]  from London finishing up in this segment Paul you've got big reports up
[55:10.400 --> 55:13.920]  they're openly talking about martial law why didn't they just clamp down on
[55:13.920 --> 55:18.000]  this in the first place because they love to use it to go after everybody go
[55:18.000 --> 55:23.040]  ahead well that's the thing that came out of you know dozens of eyewitness
[55:23.040 --> 55:28.760]  reports on the first couple of nights as well as last night was the fact that on
[55:28.760 --> 55:34.280]  every occasion when these looters went into burn a building or looter you know
[55:34.280 --> 55:40.000]  a JD sports or a Tesco or a Debenhams or even local businesses the police would
[55:40.000 --> 55:44.520]  just stand back and do nothing which of course now has led to this call to put
[55:44.520 --> 55:49.800]  troops on the streets it's led to the call for curfews on BBC news earlier
[55:49.800 --> 55:53.480]  they were showing people getting packed downs implying that that's what's needed
[55:53.480 --> 55:59.520]  so again it's it's pressure from above and pressure from below but anyone who
[55:59.520 --> 56:05.400]  believes that these nihilistic morons scum who are marauding around you know
[56:05.400 --> 56:09.400]  with their jeans halfway down their thighs represent the vanguard of some
[56:09.400 --> 56:14.800]  organic revolutionary movement are completely asinine I mean they're not
[56:14.800 --> 56:20.400]  rioting around Downing Street houses of Parliament Buckingham Palace they're
[56:20.400 --> 56:26.520]  busy filling trolleys full of tennis shoes you know iPods and booze and
[56:26.520 --> 56:31.040]  cigarettes interested in pulling people out of cars and robbing them you need
[56:31.040 --> 56:36.680]  to die you need to die people need guns to defend themselves and the police
[56:36.680 --> 56:41.640]  witness mob attacks beating people they need to put these people down that's
[56:41.640 --> 56:46.760]  the type of message but government has prisons for colleges of corruption they
[56:46.760 --> 56:51.000]  send nonviolent there to learn how to be criminals they want crime to menace the
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.520]  general public your brothers told the story with his girlfriend going out to
[56:54.520 --> 56:59.280]  eat clean-cut college educated the secret police come up and put you in a
[56:59.280 --> 57:04.680]  database and ask if you're a terrorist okay but then the welfare hordes they
[57:04.680 --> 57:08.320]  bring in well those are actually becoming the new police so this is a
[57:08.320 --> 57:11.840]  perfect setup and they're going to use it to throw the book at law abiding
[57:11.840 --> 57:16.000]  citizens and suck off you because the government's criminal the police are
[57:16.000 --> 57:21.200]  criminal and the thug welfare people are criminal Paul Watson well yeah
[57:21.200 --> 57:25.520]  completely it's it's like a bad zombie movie I've called it it's you know rise
[57:25.520 --> 57:30.280]  of the idiots and I mean these people the establishment loves them I mean
[57:30.280 --> 57:34.800]  that's why the multinational corporations the entertainment industry MTV
[57:34.800 --> 57:40.520]  manufactures these rap icons they that these young people are fed on a putrid
[57:40.520 --> 57:47.040]  diet of vapid a moral football stars who live a lifestyle that they could never
[57:47.040 --> 57:51.720]  hope to attain so that's why they're you know going in Tesco's and fill in their
[57:51.720 --> 57:56.560]  boots with 40 inch televisions and it's all due to this poison disease culture
[57:56.560 --> 58:01.000]  that they've been fed by the establishment and it creates this army of
[58:01.000 --> 58:06.280]  marauding scum that causes havoc and chaos the police sit back and do nothing
[58:06.280 --> 58:10.920]  of course the police are all too keen to crack heads and kettle legitimate
[58:10.920 --> 58:16.120]  protesters when there's a G20 in London but when hundreds of marauding scum
[58:16.120 --> 58:20.720]  looting burning down local businesses they were attacking charities they were
[58:20.720 --> 58:25.720]  attacking that at the G20 Paul nothing they beat the guy to death delivering
[58:25.720 --> 58:31.080]  newspapers and then covered it up for fun so it on a Brit you know delivering
[58:31.080 --> 58:37.240]  newspapers he must die but then the marauding scum must be worshipped why
[58:37.240 --> 58:41.760]  don't they recognize them as the new government of England like in Libya

[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:30.520]  Watson join us right now Steve Watson what's your view from the command base
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:36.040]  of Britannic Majesty London what are you witnessing what's your take on this
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:42.280]  well hi Alex I haven't witnessed anything personally yet where I am but
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:49.480]  obviously there's several areas surrounding me where you know I've got
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:55.040]  friends at work in there that said when they went to work this morning all the
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:01.720]  shopfronts were all smashed and looted so this is what's going on around us now
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:06.280]  but the fact is it's got no political point to it whatsoever it's not a
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:11.040]  political uprising but I'm seeing people saying that you know it's the start of
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.320]  a revolution and something needs to be done and it's just not well that's what
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:19.840]  the bankers want they actually want an uncoordinated welfare riot soup
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:24.240]  kitchen riot to then use that as I've said like hundreds of times here Steve
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.800]  that this was coming and it will be used to take all of our liberties and this is
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:32.200]  only the beginning I mean have we not been on target on this subject well yeah
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:36.160]  exactly this is what we've been saying but it's going to be used to beef up the
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.960]  police they obviously we've seen this in with reported on white papers that the
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:46.920]  government's produced saying that they expect this to happen I mean I'm seeing
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:51.760]  now lots of reports that are not even going into why this has happened or what
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:55.480]  needs to be done to sort out the social issues behind it they're just worried
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:59.160]  about what they're going to do about the Olympics because we've got the Olympics
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:04.000]  in London next year so you know oh we're going to need thousands of more police
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.800]  on the streets we're going to need pat-downs everywhere all this kind of
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:13.760]  thing I mean you've got an you've got an underclass of people who are just you
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.840]  know no matter how dumb down they are they've recognized that they've got no
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:21.440]  future under this system you know they're indentured to debt and slavery and
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:25.840]  they're just striking out not because not because they you know they think
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:29.840]  they can turn it around and improve things they just want to smash it to
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:35.360]  pieces it just you know it's the dissolution of society and we've got
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:40.600]  people that are not addressing the causes of it they just their actions are
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:44.200]  just going to make it worse well that's what it's intended to do but you know
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:50.200]  there's a racial core to this Steve and it's time for folks to call it out for
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.960]  what it is so that people don't think that it's some type of liberal sacrament
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:59.200]  to drag a skinny white person out of a car and beat them within an inch of their
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:05.400]  life no there is a racial element to it but that's I mean that's because a lot
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:10.600]  of these deprived areas have been you know flooded with this multicultural
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:14.960]  this multicultural project that the government had on going and it's just
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.720]  not working the communities are breaking down the communities are fighting
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:27.080]  with each other the police have adopted completely heavy-handed and very often
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:32.320]  openly racist tactics towards the people there which means the people hate the
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:39.040]  police the police on the front lines there a lot of them not even based there
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:43.600]  they're just they're just being shipped in there into these deprived areas so
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:49.200]  they have basically no you know they have no care about well the fires of the
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:54.440]  fires and rampaging and the orgy of racial hatred is spreading we're gonna
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:58.640]  come right back Steve Watson joining us from London command base of airstrip one

[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.880]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American

[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:33.520]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:07.720]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:11.960]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:16.240]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:20.600]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:24.640]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:29.240]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:33.320]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:37.080]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar

[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:19.960]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:31.480]  Alex Jones
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:36.720]  okay here's the deal there have been hundreds and hundreds of fires riots
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:44.840]  looting in more than 20 towns and cities in England it it started over the
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:51.240]  police shooting somebody then it became racial but in many towns in England the
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:58.680]  rioters are almost exclusively white so it it's it started as a racial issue now
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:04.680]  it's spread to just thugs gangster culture that knows you know no no bounds
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:10.160]  it's across the board running around burning down shops charities looting
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:14.520]  stealing and I agree with Steve Watson overall this is an economic issue now we
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:21.600]  can put on screen a key article from Monday April 9th 2007 and we also wrote
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.400]  about this at the time London Guardian and in it they link to the big detailed
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:30.000]  government report and there's also a Pentagon report the same year saying
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.560]  basically the same thing I don't know who plagiarized who and the British
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:40.440]  Ministry of Defense or the Pentagon but revolutions flash mobs and brain ships
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:45.720]  a grim vision of the future and in this the British Ministry of Defense
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:51.040]  predicts that in the coming years because of austerity over banking collapse
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:56.400]  that there will be flash mobs rapidly descending criminal gangs go read it for
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:02.240]  yourself and that's in Paul Joseph Watson and Steve Watson and Aaron Dykes and
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:07.520]  Curt Nemos articles that are all up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.600]  com today but the point is people like wow the Pentagon wow the British
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:16.840]  Ministry of Defense they all predicted this of course they predicted it when
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:20.680]  they got rid of Glass-Steagall 12 years ago the Rand Corporation said there's
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:25.960]  going to be a collapse now we're taking over the derivatives and the rich are
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.480]  going to dig in we'll have mercenaries we're going to federalize and militarize
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:34.320]  police it's on so that's why we've been here telling you they're going to
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.000]  devalue global currencies the poor's welfare checks aren't going to go far
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.920]  anymore people are going to feel desperate they're going to sit there
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:47.080]  watching TV shows about the riches yachts and they're bling and you know the
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:51.960]  Hollywood people making a hundred million dollars a year and they're not
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:56.520]  going to want liberty or freedom or a future they're going to want bling or
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:03.400]  treasure loot goodies and as the family just degenerates as all this happens as
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:09.760]  I've been saying last week we are going to align into gangs police gangs black
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:13.880]  gangs white gangs Hispanic gangs that's already what's happened this is what
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:19.440]  happens in a road warrior scenario this is what happens in a dark ages type
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:25.200]  scenario and it's happening now and the globalist have socially engineered this
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:30.840]  by design to to conquer society now when they're done this is just the
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:35.560]  beginning of years and years of riots looting burning every summer is going to
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.280]  be worse than the next the depression deepening the austerity deepening prices
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:47.400]  exploding every form of metal being stolen by by by by bands of looters as
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:53.400]  we're now seeing all over the world racial attacks in Chicago in Milwaukee
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:12:00.960]  Wisconsin in New York in Boston in Miami in Dallas in Los Angeles American
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:05.720]  flags can't be flown at many public schools can't wear an American flag
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:10.200]  shirt makes the illegal aliens too angry they're part of a tribal thing for
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:14.480]  Mexico that's what nationalism is if people don't come to America or England
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:19.240]  and take on the gang of the country that's how we're designed nationalism
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:23.280]  then we're all with each other's throats then the bankers who sit above the whole
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:29.400]  world dividing and conquering us will let this scourge burn out society then
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:35.200]  come in as the saviors offering total control total police state as the answer
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:39.840]  already Ireland's announced that children must take vaccines to get your
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:45.200]  tax breaks for having children or to put your kids in school all over total
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:52.240]  tyranny is coming Paul Watson comments on what Steve was just saying well related
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:56.520]  to what you just covered in there I mean I wrote an article several articles in
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:01.880]  early 2008 again wrote one last year the one I wrote in June last year said and
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:06.200]  this was specifically about the UK crippling austerity cuts would force
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:10.520]  the economically deprived to quote take to the streets with a mindset of nothing
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:14.520]  to lose if the government handouts they have become dependent on are drastically
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:19.240]  reduced and the system knew this was coming I knew they were going to be
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:23.520]  valued folks are saying I'm still getting the same welfare it's not worth as much
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:28.640]  it doesn't buy as much via inflation my grandmother ten years ago on Social
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:33.280]  Security could survive she can't now what's gonna happen with gangbangers who
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:37.440]  aren't will behave like my 87 year old grandmother what's gonna happen with
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.720]  gangbangers who've been brainwashed by a culture of acting tough and a police
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:46.760]  force that leaves them alone they're going to go wild and feed on people who
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:50.920]  aren't criminals what's gonna happen in the UK Paul where nobody's got guns to
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:56.200]  defend themselves well what's gonna happen is an increase of the scenes we've
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.880]  seen over the past few days and they knew it was coming because the same
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:04.280]  thing happened in the 70s when we had the last round of austerity fascism the
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:08.640]  difference between then and now is that we weren't such a rampant consumerist
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:12.360]  society whereas then there was less looting because there were less portable
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:17.340]  portable goods in shops to steal whereas now the youth are bombarded with
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:22.080]  constant advertising about how if you don't have an iPhone you're a loser
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.680]  basically you're not gonna have any friends so they see this opportunity and
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.860]  they go out and fill their boots well you know who turned around the Los
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:33.360]  Angeles riots was the Koreans the police stood down as they always do
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:37.920]  globalist you know the bosses make them do it it was the Koreans finally turn
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:41.040]  the tide I mean let me tell you something you if you tried to loot shops
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:44.200]  here in Austin you might get to two or three of them but you'd run to the wrong
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.080]  shop and every one of you would die if just a few of these thugs got killed
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:52.160]  they would all stop it and I'm telling you none of us are safe for some of
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:57.720]  these people don't start getting what's coming to them well it's not just guns
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:02.560]  though it's generally about broken Britain I mean people don't talk to their
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.880]  neighbors if a group of neighbors got together and said right we're gonna
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:09.840]  just because they're raiding off licenses and family businesses that
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.840]  survive two world wars so why aren't the neighbors getting together and saying
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.720]  right we're gonna protect this building tonight we're gonna protect the street
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:21.640]  it's just not happening because people are actually doing that now
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:25.560]  they on Twitter and things people are trying to form groups I'm gonna just be
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:29.920]  honest this sounds fun I mean I would just love with baseball bats and swords
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:33.480]  to just wait for people I don't need a gun
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:40.520]  to deal with this though because it's just gonna escalate it I mean people in
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:44.160]  the communities are coming out and they're trying to you know do something
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.640]  about this they've seen that trying to be divided the communities are trying to
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:52.520]  be divided the police is standing back and doing nothing I'm not surprised the
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:55.040]  police are standing back and doing nothing to be honest because they're a
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:16:00.720]  part of this as well they've had like 40,000 job cuts in London they've all
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:05.680]  had pay cuts and there's no senior police officers on the front line all
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:09.360]  these police that you're seeing sort of standing back they're doing so because
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.120]  they haven't had any proper training and they're just thinking well why should I
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:16.080]  get involved in that I'm not trying to do that I'm not getting paid to get
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:19.600]  involved in that I don't care about this community because I'm not from this
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:25.360]  community and it's I mean it's on they train them to crack heads at G20 though
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:28.880]  they're very proficient at that oh listen Steve tell the story you and your
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:32.440]  girlfriend I've had it happen to me in England where they just walk over give
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:36.440]  your clean cut and dress nice and boss you around the community police because
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:40.240]  you're seen as a milk cow a slave they're gonna make sure you're properly
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:44.040]  bowing but tell folks what they do to you going out to dinner with your
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:49.240]  girlfriend well they just stop and search to me and that's what they've been
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:55.080]  doing for years now it's those kind of tactics in place the proper community
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:02.800]  policing that have led to all this kind of social breakdown I mean if you know if
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:08.200]  they plowed funds into proper policing instead of training the police that you
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:12.520]  know everyone's strong and they've got to be dealt with just outside of the law
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:19.080]  then this kind of thing might not have broken down as much as it has well I
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:24.200]  know I'm ranting just the images all over the US in fact I forgot to tell the
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:28.080]  story with one of our crew with his wife these guys were trying to carjack her
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:32.000]  she just pulled her gun out and they ran off but the point is is that this is
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.760]  scary and I guess that's why I'm getting all wound up at a subconscious level I
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:39.800]  want to go ahead and have a fight with these criminals because at an instinctive
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:44.440]  level we've got to maintain law and order and look at Katrina the military and
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:47.680]  police wouldn't come help the public then a week later they came in and went to
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:54.560]  high and dry areas to loot rich houses and take their guns Paul Steve well yeah
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:58.920]  I mean but Parliament's gonna meet on Thursday for one day they've been
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:02.920]  recalled for the first time in nearly ten years and they're just gonna pass
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:07.880]  some draconian piece of legislation that impacts legitimate law-abiding
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:11.800]  protesters and people going about their business criminals don't obey those kind
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:17.560]  of laws so it's all design I mean it's as I said it's it's manipulating both the
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:21.600]  underclass and the middle class because it only results in the middle class
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:26.480]  calling for their own enslavement just to keep them safe when as has been
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:30.720]  proven the police and the authorities cannot keep anyone safe and they got no
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.800]  interest in doing so so that's why people need to you know protect themselves
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:40.120]  well you guys need to call for the unthinkable the return of your right to
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:44.640]  keep them bare arms it is time for britch to take control of your government
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:48.320]  and to hand out the weapons and your crime is gonna dissipate overnight
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:52.260]  believe me you know we don't have a lot of home invasions here in Texas compared
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:55.760]  to like New York or Illinois because you come in somebody's house around here
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:03.120]  you die and I'm just telling you I mean it freaks me out to watch people in New
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:08.240]  York Chicago and other areas wherever the people are liberals just absolutely
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:11.880]  being gang raped I mean does it does it not upset you Steve Steve what are you
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.760]  gonna do people come to your house you gonna use a butcher knife they are or
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:19.120]  I guess you'll you'll try to talk to them I don't know what I'm gonna do if they
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:23.440]  come to my house that's the problem I think you know it's gone too far down
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:28.800]  the line for that that's in theory that's a good solution but it's not gonna
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:34.980]  happen I think you know let's talk about the media hype over this as well
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:39.720]  because I think that let's come back and do that listen I want you to get to the
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:44.600]  sporting good stores and start buying baseball bats and what you do is you get
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:49.200]  some nails and you hammer them through all over the nice big trudging and you

[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:12.040]  Colasso answers yes in his two new books America's new slavery for more than
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:17.520]  13 years author Jose Colasso has been trying to prove that the US government
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:22.240]  has the capacity to read a person's thoughts with a revolutionary technology
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:27.560]  known as fmri functional magnetic resonance imaging and there is proof
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:32.800]  that it exists America's new slavery explores this technology and its many
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:37.760]  possible applications in national security who has access to it how is it
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:42.800]  being used does America's salvation rest in this technology these and many
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:47.640]  other questions are answered in America's new slavery the new books by
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:55.320]  Jose Colasso available on bn.com amazon.com and borders.com America's new
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:24:11.240]  slavery all Americans should be concerned
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:17.400]  folks it is a fundamental instinct that I have when I see criminals whether they
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:26.320]  be police North Korean commas ours the Ku Klux Klan black racist whoever they
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:31.640]  are feeding on defenseless people remember Reginald Denny truck driver they
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:35.960]  pull him out and beat his face in with a brick until he basically has no face I
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:40.840]  mean that is horrible and just because Reginald Denny's white doesn't mean he
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:45.960]  deserves that and whether it's groups of white thugs that are doing this black
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:49.920]  thugs whatever they all need to be punished and the British government
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:55.280]  will not punish them because governments let violent offenders go and then they
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:59.840]  keep nonviolent in prison that's the globalist model now talking about how
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:03.720]  the media is spinning this yes they're they're saying we need TSA pat downs
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:08.000]  everywhere as if that will keep anyone safe you can't keep knives away from
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.800]  criminals in a prison the only answer is for the people to have a right to defend
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:16.840]  themselves and Steve you said you're getting intel that folks are banding
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:21.040]  together and defending their shops that's good it's time because as soon as
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:24.160]  that happens and as soon as somebody comes in one of these shops and gets
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:28.320]  their heads clubbed in you're gonna start seeing the criminals have the fear of
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:33.560]  God in them Steve yeah I mean there's some been some announcements on Twitter
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:38.080]  and stuff that people in certain areas heard that they're next you know their
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:43.080]  areas being targeted next so they're trying to organize themselves on Twitter to
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:47.320]  get prepared for it to you know all come outside not stay inside sort of
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:51.880]  cowering which is all the police now what about the cases of famous even famous
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:56.120]  people get assaulted they're being stabbed they fight back and the police go
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:59.360]  ahead and arrest them or the guy who'd been robbed three times and finally got
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:02.960]  an old shotgun and shot one of the guys and then he and the guy that defended
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:08.560]  himself in his house being attacked he went to prison yeah there's loads of
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:13.040]  stories like that I mean I don't know how it's gonna go down if people you know
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.560]  people all come out together you know the law abiding people all come out
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:20.400]  together I don't know how they're gonna what they're gonna do against these
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:23.800]  bugs but basically if there's enough of them then they're gonna outnumber these
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:27.800]  bugs and they're gonna you know do an infinitely better job than the police are
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:32.920]  doing at the moment which is to just sit back and basically secure the area but
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:37.120]  let me ask you this Steve do you think the police are standing down under
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:41.680]  orders so they can crack down and take more liberties or are the police afraid
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:45.960]  of getting in trouble for political correctness I think it's a bit of both
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:52.320]  I think you know I've said there aren't any senior police there so the police
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:58.160]  that are there thinking well you know my seniors don't seem to care about this
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:02.720]  so why should I and also I think they have been ordered to in the wake of the
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:07.560]  media coverage and the hype around the you know the heavy-handed tactics that
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:11.120]  we've seen in London recently they have been ordered to stand back a little bit
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:14.720]  but obviously this is a very different situation these are not legitimate
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.440]  protests yeah but stand back when thugs are doing stuff but then they routinely
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:24.280]  beat peaceful protesters to death or a guy delivering newspapers at G20 yeah
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:28.200]  exactly but I think they're different sets of police I think the police in the
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:32.400]  suburbs of London and not you know they're not the riot police that you see at
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.680]  the G20 cracking head they're not even trained as riot police they're just
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:40.560]  normal police but normally you're just out and about walking you know on the
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:46.160]  beat they're thinking you know it's not my job to go in there and crack heads and
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.320]  I'm not gonna do it but how could you control yourself watching people being
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:53.640]  drug out of cars I'm not a cop and I'm gonna tell you right now and I'm not a
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:57.400]  tough guy either but if I see innocent people being attacked I go into action
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:01.920]  and I don't understand people that don't have an instinct to want to
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:04.760]  stomp criminals into the ground
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:13.360]  and the other thing is that the fires that they're starting because they're starting the fires to destroy the CCTV cameras that are everywhere that are catching them doing the looting
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:17.680]  because they're setting everything on fire and then the fire brigade when the fire
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:22.360]  brigade can finally get in to deal with it they're being attacked as well and the
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:25.800]  police is still standing back and doing nothing yeah they need to arm the firemen
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.960]  right now I mean this is asinine that's like in the LA riots shooting firemen
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:35.440]  I mean I just it is insane and then it only hurts those communities because
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:41.120]  the businesses don't generally come back into the area yeah exactly I mean and
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:45.200]  then you've got people saying well you know these drugs say well it's their fault
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:49.520]  you know they're the businesses they're rich people we don't have any jobs and it
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:55.280]  all goes back to this sort of deep social unrest that's been fermented over these
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:29:00.240]  years by government from both sides and political spectrum in this country well
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:03.440]  Paul brought it up that it's mainly family shops in England for those that
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:06.960]  don't know there's thousands of shops in London that are some of them are 200
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:10.040]  300 years old that have been handed down and some of them aren't going to be
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:14.360]  coming back now and just little family shops we'll continue to cover this
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:18.160]  financial news coming up we've also got Stuart Rhodes joining us because our
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:21.240]  government's busy demonizing conservatives libertarians patriots
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:26.040]  instead of all the roving gangs we've got here Paul Watson any final comments
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:30.440]  yeah that the rebels should now the looters should be recognized as the new
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:34.160]  legitimate government of the United Kingdom David Cameron should step down
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:38.920]  according to the example that they've set in Libya well there that's al-Qaeda
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:42.600]  looters and they are being handed the bank accounts of the Libyan government
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:47.160]  and their property in England and so actually that's probably what should
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:51.600]  happen NATO should now invade England and give the looters control we're on the

[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.200]  attacks now it's groups of white hoodlums running around in smaller cities
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:23.740]  torching and burning and robbing predominantly in London it is
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:29.040]  predominantly a quote minorities but it is it is this politically correct idea
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:34.040]  that it's okay to do this type stuff and we're breaking down more and more into
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:38.840]  tribalism it's very very frightening and it's going to be used to take law
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:45.440]  abiding citizens rights the answer is the general public being armed you go to
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:49.760]  where all these riots are happening it's everywhere the public is disarmed and
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:55.120]  people know that they're domesticated liberal populations who will not even
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:59.180]  physically fight back watching these brits and in these videos they just
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:03.360]  basically get down on their hands and knees allow themselves to be beaten it
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:10.040]  is absolutely pathetic pathetic any red-blooded man does not want to get in

[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:28.280]  and I don't like it and I know that we're going bankrupt and world
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:31.880]  government is coming in like a flood and we've told you there's going to be
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:37.080]  global disorder we read to you the different Pentagon reports back in 2007
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:40.280]  the British Ministry of Defense reports where they said because of derivatives
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:44.120]  they were gonna have to devalue currencies to pay it off and that this
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:49.440]  would cause the underclasses to start going absolutely wild and we've covered
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:56.440]  that and it's only going to get worse it is only going to get more insane now
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:05.360]  here's CBC gold may hit 2,511 JP Morgan and actually reading from MSNBC they
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:11.360]  said it will go to 2,500 or higher by year-end that is their prime projection
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:16.000]  on very high volatility following the downgrade of US debt and they go on
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:22.760]  here in the report to say that this is because of inflation rising inflation
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:29.480]  weakness in the US dollar and it goes on to say that they expect other commodities
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:37.240]  to also explode in prices this is elementary information and finally we're
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:43.480]  starting to see admissions of what's going on now that said I did a special
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:48.480]  report seven o'clock last night and we're gonna have more special reports in
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:53.800]  the coming nights these are info wars comm special reports some will be ten

[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:46.920]  format if I told you the real projections we've got of actually how many
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:50.200]  folks we're reaching I'm sure the government knows but it is a daunting
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:54.600]  incredible number and it's a great responsibility but the point is we've
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:59.960]  got to up our attack on the globalist 110 percent we cannot do it without you

[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.520]  I can't because we are going all in because we understand the globalist
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:04.360]  program we are aware of it now I want to play this clip we're going to Stewart
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:09.440]  Rhodes until five minutes into the next hour maybe a little bit longer founder
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:13.720]  of Oath Keeper's great patriot constitutional lawyer pair trooper
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:21.040]  veteran Ron Paul staffer to break down some incredible developments on the
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:27.640]  super congress court site these riots the stealth gun control by fiat outside of
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:31.720]  law but first I want to play you a clip and I put this in the special report
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:36.320]  last night and I had trouble dealing with it mentally because it's so naked
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:44.160]  it's so open it's so arrogant it's so in your face green-span giggling and they've
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:49.160]  got ghouls be the globalist skull and bones member who just left the Obama
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:54.160]  administration looks at him and can't believe he can't believe that this was
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:58.600]  said on meet the prostitutes meet the prostitutes of the press to the
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:03.480]  globalist green-span says it is impossible for us to default because we
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:09.320]  will just print more money that is a technical default through inflation and
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:17.240]  signals a Weimar Republic Zimbabwe Mexican peso type scenario it is so
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:22.600]  incredible to see something like that said and it lets you know what they're
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:26.800]  planning okay and again they're hyper-inflating to pay off the
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:31.840]  derivatives they created that we don't owe and the fact that they would flaunt
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:34.920]  this now remember just a few months ago Geithner said on the same prostitute show
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:40.360]  on meet the prostitutes meet the press he said that we will not lose our triple
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:47.560]  A rating so they are maneuvering us into total collapse now here is Alan
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:50.440]  Greenspan who got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act who brought us to
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:54.880]  here to where we are now an arch criminal who told their news hour that he is
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:41:00.640]  above the law two years ago telling you that that that it's impossible to
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:04.320]  default because they'll just print money what will that do to your paycheck
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:08.080]  destroy its spending power buying power what will do to fixed income social
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:13.840]  security it will destroy us this is how societies are destroyed let's go ahead
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:20.680]  and play that clip our US Treasury bonds still safe to invest in very much so I
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:28.120]  think there's a this is not an issue of credit rating the United States can pay
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:34.640]  any debt it has because we can always print money to do that so there is zero
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:42.480]  probability of the fall what and Goolsbee the former Obama advisor sitting
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:46.680]  there with him cannot believe it if you're not watching prison planet TV
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:52.200]  curtain him a run article about it yesterday titled what Greenspan says you
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:57.000]  know hyperinflation of currency is on the table I think that was the headline I
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.960]  forget the exact headline the point is you can find that you can watch the full
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:05.920]  newscast and and in the longer clip the host cannot believe that was said I mean
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:11.480]  that was an incredible announcement Stewart Rhodes I want to get your take
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:15.320]  on that he's the founder director of Oathkeepers he served as a US Army
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:18.960]  paratrooper until disabled through a rough terrain parachuting accident during
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:23.040]  a nightjump he is a former firearms instructor and former member representative
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:27.360]  Ron Paul's DC staff Stewart currently writes the monthly enemy at the Gates
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:31.600]  column for SWAT magazine Stewart graduated from Yale Law School in 2004
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:35.360]  where his paper solving the puzzle of enemy combatant status won Yale's
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:40.520]  Miller Prize for best paper on the Bill of Rights he assisted teaching US
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:44.680]  military history at Yale was a Yale research scholar and is writing a book
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:49.320]  on the dangers of applying the laws of war to American people Oathkeepers net is
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:53.240]  of course his greatest accomplishment in my humble opinion Stewart great to have
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:57.840]  you here with us we are everything we foretold knowing history is now
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:02.680]  unfolding and we we have just begun the plunge into tyranny my friend so and
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:07.160]  it's now as you said time for all of us to girt ourselves in defense of
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:11.800]  civilization absolutely I mean this we're heading down the same path as the
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:16.080]  landlord public in Germany in 1920s and I guess I guess these he's technically
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:20.280]  correct he thinks he's keep on printing money to pay pay their debts but that'll
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:25.320]  only go on until the dollar is worthless until just like in Germany you
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:29.080]  have dollars being thrown in the streets and people stealing the bags the
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:32.680]  dollars are in rather than rather than dollars themselves because it'll be
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:36.160]  absolutely worthless and I think you're correct that this has been being done on
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:41.120]  purpose to bring us to our knees and so the the solution for us is to decouple
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:45.480]  from the fiat system and to you know start using gold and silver in our
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:49.680]  states and resorting to our state sovereignty and notification and decoupling
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:54.400]  from the fiat and that's why the feds have now issued public papers in the
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:59.320]  von Notau's case and others saying alternative currencies are terrorism and
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:04.200]  we will be infiltrated and destroyed those are quotes so now doing something
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:08.160]  totally legal we're being told we're terrorist right and that's why you want
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:11.040]  to do it you want to do it like a sort of bees you want to be thousands and
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:15.400]  millions of people doing it themselves and small individual transactions
[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:18.760]  rather than a one guy having a big warehouse full of silver that was his
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:23.000]  big mistake it was very easy to take down so you do it quietly among yourself
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.280]  with barter and with using golden silver in private exchanges they can't
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:31.760]  possibly regulate all that it's impossible okay Stuart let's continue
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:39.000]  there I mean chronicling the ten orders you will never follow saying that you
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.640]  will keep your oath I remember you were here years ago but just a few months ago
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:47.360]  saying get ready for the collapse everybody get ready because you're a
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:52.560]  historian you've won awards at Yale and you know for for being historian if you
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:57.920]  know history you know exactly what road we're on and and now here we are and
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:01.800]  the government is now rolling out that Homeland Security is for the gun owners
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:05.840]  the veterans the libertarians the people that want to end the Fed it's now out
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:10.480]  again today that the Pentagon is surveilling in the Fedders is surveilling
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:15.120]  oathkeepers Ron Paul they know that we know that they're the criminals and
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:19.680]  they're coming after us well sure we're the threat for what they want to do
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:23.040]  next what they want is a collapse where the American people are desperate and
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:27.800]  hungry and won't accept anything and the solution is going to be a worldwide
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:31.640]  version of the Fed and so you know the people who are not going to buy into
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:34.880]  that who are striking at the root and striking at the heart of the beast
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:39.000]  attacking the Federal Reserve decoupling from the system you know
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.920]  separating them and separating themselves from a few others and being
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:45.280]  strong again they don't want you to do that if you do any of those things any
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:49.200]  of things the founding fathers wanted us to do like sort of militia or shares
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:52.880]  posse or use gold and silver if you dare to do those things they're gonna try to
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:56.440]  demonize you this is the fight we're in though we should just realize it embrace
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:46:01.760]  the stuck and and do what they don't want us to do absolutely I mean if
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:06.200]  England had posse's and that's where posse started for folks that don't know
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:10.120]  over a thousand years ago if they had a posse you wouldn't have any of this
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:14.200]  crime going on right now it's the same thing where the looting and rioting is
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:19.000]  starting up here in the U.S. and the media is trying to keep it quiet right
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.880]  you're not going to see that kind of looting and rioting going on in rural
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:25.960]  areas where folks are well armed it just won't happen you're gonna see in the
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:29.600]  cities where they've all been you know you're a side to the turned into
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:37.560]  Europeans incredible what do you make of the super Congress what's your view of
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:43.120]  that monstrosity well I think it's it's basically it's it's our version of the
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:49.440]  enabling act or something similar it's an absolute destruction of Republican
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:53.560]  former government that the Constitution guarantees does and so I think our
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:58.600]  response should be a scorched earth policy of voting on a box is anyone who
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:02.800]  voted for it voting on a box is anyone who didn't sit on it and voting on a
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:06.480]  box is anybody who dares to vote for anything that comes out of it it should
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:10.160]  just be at the third rail they can't touch it's up to us to do that if we
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:13.560]  don't do that then we're showing which we're telling them that won't accept
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:18.040]  anything so it's not Congress if it's the president has a has the power to
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:24.000]  raise is the national debt on his own under this this new law and it differs
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.360]  to him the power to do that and Congress can only say no but of course
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:30.800]  then the president override that with a veto that Congress could only then
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:34.440]  override it but for the two-thirds majority so it doesn't want a thing
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:38.200]  that really bad if it's a cock the president of this Congress instead of
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:42.520]  Congress and it abdicates her responsibilities but it also destroys
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:45.840]  the ability of all the freshmen in there they want the pesky freshmen you
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:49.280]  know tea party people they don't want Rand Paul being able to filibuster they
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:52.800]  don't want Ron Paul the thorn on their side on his committee being able to
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:56.520]  screw with the Fed their way of doing that is to create a whole new Congress
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:48:00.080]  little pet Congress it's telling a parallel to the to the council of
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:05.080]  governors they did you have a select small body it supposedly represents the
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:09.240]  larger body but is full of puppets and then the president can pretend that he's
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:13.400]  gone to Congress it's really a polyporeal for for Obama he can now say oh
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:17.720]  yeah I've consulted the joint committee on reducing the budget and that and
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:22.760]  they've agreed if we could raise the deficit will that raise the the budget
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:30.520]  limit and we couldn't do that now so Congress is totally up that loop and it's
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:34.360]  happening with a whimper not a bang this this is definitely not just a new
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:38.600]  committee the spending bills and will now originate out of this committee
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:43.120]  Reid says it affects all bills we've seen the president launch wars without
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:47.880]  any congressional approval we're seeing the ATF launching new gun
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:52.240]  regulations outside of law the NRA assuming them over that we're seeing a
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:57.840]  mad rush for government to do whatever it wants whenever it wants
[01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:01.480]  even in this decade the Congress has been advocating its responsibility for
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:06.280]  many decades you know the war powers act was that you know farce Congress is
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.960]  supposed to declare war but they've delegated that authority to the
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:12.440]  president and and he just showed what he really thinks of that even the war
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:16.640]  powers act is watered down and unconstitutional as it is because
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:20.280]  Congress not doing their responsibility he's ignored that he pretend like he's
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:24.120]  the president of the world and he went to the World Congress to the UN that's
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:27.680]  his behavior pattern and now it's the same kind of thing it doesn't like those
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:31.080]  pesky freshmen in the Republican Party some of them are actually doing some
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:35.360]  good it doesn't doesn't like grand paul certainly so the answer is well we'll
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:39.280]  just go someplace else for the authority we'll create something new and we'll call
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:43.680]  it you know democracy and then instead of the bills being introduced in the
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:47.160]  house by individual members and having filibuster and and and
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:56.360]  amendments yeah they originated in this this this is a super Congress and then
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:50:00.720]  the house is only allowed to the upper down on it they're neutered they're
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:06.000]  muzzled they're silenced there's no no filibusters no debate no no chance for
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.400]  amendment just up or down because that's why every member of Congress should
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:13.800]  vote no on anything that comes out of that I don't care what it is okay how
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:18.000]  nice it is a wonderful it might be they should vote no because it's just a
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.080]  destruction of their responsibility and they should be like Ron Paul and draw a
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:26.280]  line in the sand on constitutionality first doesn't make a difference how good
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:29.840]  the bill is if it's unconstitutional because it comes up a body that's
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:34.040]  nowhere in our Constitution they must go against it if they vote for it they
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:36.880]  need to go they don't know their oath they don't know the Constitution they're
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:39.960]  violating their oath they need to go that should be the response to the
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:44.680]  American people scorched earth all right let's let's look at a microcosm of

[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:27.680]  we are riders on the storm an engineered global financial collapse out of
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:32.960]  which the social engineers want to create a collectivist eugenics world
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:37.080]  government Stuart Rhodes is our guest the reason I wanted to get Stuart on a few
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:41.960]  days ago we have him now is because I saw your press release at Oathkeepers we
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:48.560]  posted it at info wars.com as well but it was also at oathkeepers.net where the
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:54.240]  the king of courtside the police chief with the council fired the mayor and
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:55:01.960]  most the police has declared you and others as terrorists. Yeah he did he
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:06.120]  referred to us we're holding a rally on August 27th there in the court of the
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:12.000]  court site 10 the 10 stand-up police officers who refused his unlawful orders
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.880]  and blew the whistle on him and he responded to that by saying that some
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:22.520]  of the writers oathkeepers and the Tea Party of Phoenix are he referred to
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:28.480]  us as a domestic terrorist and he called the FBI to report us and this is
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:32.560]  something he's been he's been using in his playbook now for many months trying
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:38.840]  to scare people by raising the specter of the Gifford shooting and making
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:43.280]  allegations that people in town who are liberty freedom fighters are the same
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:48.520]  mindset as the shooter there or the same mindset as someone who would who would
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:52.400]  use violence and so if you stand up for your for your rights and participate in
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:56.200]  local government and clean up good avoid network that's how they're gonna respond
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:56:00.000]  like you said it's a microcosm of what's gonna happen across the country and
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:06.560]  already is. I mean it's incredible that at a city council meeting in front of
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:11.840]  witnesses he would say that now people's First Amendment is a terrorist action.
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:17.160]  Let's hope that's what they do, they demonize, this is the same playbook as the ADL and
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:21.080]  Southern Public Law Center and DHS which Southern Public Law Center you know is now
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:26.400]  part of they're on the advisory panel for DHS is to you know make allegations
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:33.000]  that people who talk that way are just one bore up away from mass shooting or
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:39.160]  using bombs and things like that and now you see Biden and other politicians
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:42.920]  making references the Tea Party movement is being terrorist or white
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:48.360]  terrorists and references to you know making analogies about Haida. This is what
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:51.840]  they're doing is just saying that anybody who holds these viewpoints, anybody
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:56.120]  who's a constitutionalist or close to founding fathers or anybody who dares to
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:57:00.800]  get involved in local politics and want to clean up corruption is potentially
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:05.200]  dangerous. Well that's the new rollout Stuart and I guarantee you I've seen this
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:09.600]  rollout now in the last year intensifying they're intensifying it ahead of
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:14.160]  staging events or provocaturing them to blame on us and that have a big
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:18.640]  national guilt fest. Do you agree that these are frightening storm clouds?
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:22.800]  Absolutely and this is the problem with economic collapse around the corner is that
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:27.040]  you know if we're unprepared they're going to capitalize on the social
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:31.520]  descriptions and the riots and they'll use that excuse for preparing martial law
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:36.640]  and that you know the answer is always with a set-aside normal procedure even
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:40.600]  in this town council they declare it's an emergency and so they have to stop
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:44.440]  having public meetings and total violation of state law the open meetings
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:49.560]  law they started having closed meetings to stymie you know the scrutiny they
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:53.000]  didn't want to have spotlights put on them so they declare a trumped-up
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:58.160]  emergency and they use that excuse to circumvent you know your due process
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:01.160]  rights and your rights are in the Constitution and the same will happen
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:04.560]  after the economic collapse they won't say oh it's our fault we screwed up we
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:09.440]  printed too much money and we're to blame instead just like they blamed
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:14.880]  S&T for the downgrade don't blame the riots on you pesky constitutional
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:19.320]  staff there who are interfering with the National Guard and FEMA and North
[01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:23.800]  com doing their job so you could believe to shut up this arm like in
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:29.360]  Katrina and just get in line and then for the camp. Absolutely Stuart Stuart do
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:35.320]  five more minutes with us and then we are going to get into some of the other
[01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:41.800]  financial news and then Mark Moreno with some good news is joining us.

[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:55.880]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[01:58:55.880 --> 01:59:00.440]  important day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything
[01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:04.880]  about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:08.200]  you take care of your health and your own family. Now this man has made some
[01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:12.480]  outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is he's usually right. You
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:16.400]  see he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's
[01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:20.280]  biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his
[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:24.760]  work a dire prophecy. Recently he created a video which you can watch online for
[01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:28.160]  free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a
[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:32.080]  real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:35.480]  free video online today. He explains everything you need to know including
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:38.800]  simple steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video at

[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:12.880]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:21.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas. Alex
[02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:27.200]  Jones. You know, I've been talking all day about rich need to get out and buy as
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:32.400]  many aluminum baseball bats or wooden baseball bats as they can and Drudge
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:39.120]  report always on target. I bet Drudge is listening. He's smarter than I am in a
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:42.840]  lot of ways. I bet he thought of it himself too but went and checked went and
[02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:49.000]  checked Amazon and sure enough movers and shakers and sports and leisure, little
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:54.560]  collapsible nightsticks are up in sales to the number one sales item in sports
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:01:05.800]  to 7,229 times. So its ranking is up 7,029 times from what it was. Number two is
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:13.520]  a aluminum baseball bat silver 60 centimeters. It's up 5,690 percent.
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:18.200]  Number three, a wooden baseball bat. I agree the aluminum is better not going to
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:23.040]  break but you could put nails in the wooden one. Midwest American ash wooden
[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:29.280]  baseball bat RRP. See folks, you can have a hammer in your car even in places like
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:33.120]  New York where victims are disarmed or a baseball bat. It's you know, you're
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:41.080]  playing baseball, you're driving nails. Bronx 32 inch wooden baseball bat 300 3,734
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:48.680]  percent up and then next is a Raleigh folding work stand and a tent. But I
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:52.840]  tell you Stuart, that is the answer. Can you imagine being the poor brits not
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:57.040]  been able to have a gun while the looters set fire to people's businesses and
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:00.800]  homes and women are jumping out of the tops of buildings? I mean I'm sorry
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:04.200]  setting fires to buildings is a terrorist action and those people need to
[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:08.600]  be shot. I mean isn't that legal and lawful of somebody's setting your house
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:13.800]  on fire that you shoot them? Oh I think so, well if there's a threat to life
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:19.960]  absolutely. You can stop them from bringing you to death, you bet. But I mean
[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:25.580]  look at these poor domesticated people in England at the at the at the mercy of
[02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:30.440]  scum. Well that's the problem with relying on hand tools, you know, you're
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:34.360]  relying on youth and strength too. So if you're some old lady how is she gonna
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:38.160]  use a baseball bat against some young bug? It's gonna be much more difficult. She
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:45.240]  needs a gun. She does and women need guns. Well yeah, that's the whole point of
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:49.120]  firearms is they take out the equation of physical strength. Otherwise it's the
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:52.320]  guy that they can they can hold the heaviest shield and the heaviest broad
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:56.640]  sword. That's because prevail, you know, youth and strength and skill, you know,
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:00.680]  will overcome age. So the old folks, they're pretty good crafty. They're
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:05.640]  ready to start thinking and planning and in full force multipliers. Well who
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:11.480]  do criminals target? They love to target the old or the very young or the very
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:16.960]  weak, you know, smaller, smaller framed females in particular. So, you know, folks
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:20.560]  folks there will do what what they should be doing and they'll start banding
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:26.120]  together and to counteract the thugs. And I think that you'll see, you know, ad
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:34.520]  hot militias being formed in England. And I hope so. Hope they haven't been so so
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:39.320]  gilded. Gilded. There you go. I thought they have been so gilded that they don't
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:42.840]  have, they have no confidence how to do that. Hopefully they'll rediscover. Well
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:47.000]  no, no, it's confirmed and the police don't like it, by the way. I was looking
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:50.720]  it up during the break that the shop owners and communities are banding
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:53.880]  together with the baseball bats and things and the police are telling them
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:57.400]  that's not good. They need to just let themselves be raped and killed in their
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:02.920]  houses and businesses burned down. Yeah, England's where we're going. It's a
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:07.720]  hyper state with you got hyper criminals on one side, the hyper state on the other
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:15.480]  side and in the middle are totally gilded emaciated, you know, either way. It's
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:18.680]  like out of the movie. What was it called the time machine where they're just
[02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:21.680]  going to sit around and let each other drown and let each other be eaten by
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:27.360]  some strange twist of fate. We the Eloi had become the prey and the more locks
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:32.960]  the masters. Exactly. So that's what they want. And so if people want we want
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:37.120]  security are going to turn into a hyper state. They want you to turn into a
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:41.080]  hyper state. The way you think that your only way of being saved from living out
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:45.880]  of 28 days later or a mega man scenario is to have a police state. That's
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:49.800]  their solution to create the problem as you've always said for many years. Tell
[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:54.360]  you what, restate that for everybody. When we come back, they'll let Stuart go,
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:58.760]  get into some more news, and then open the phones up to England, and then get to
[02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:01.400]  our next guest.
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:06.000]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:10.120]  supply. Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming and I think it's
[02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:14.680]  important for my listeners to do three things right away. Number one, study the
[02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:20.520]  past. History really does repeat itself. Number two, learn to spot the dangerous
[02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:26.920]  food shortage trends. Number three, take decisive action. A perfect storm is
[02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:31.960]  brewing or a global food crisis. That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new
[02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:37.240]  book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest
[02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:42.360]  famines in history. Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits. This
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:47.320]  book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com. You'll also get a
[02:05:47.320 --> 02:05:51.920]  free copy of Supermarket Survival, how to cut your grocery bills in half. Again,
[02:05:51.920 --> 02:06:01.120]  that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com. That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:05.880]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This
[02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:11.400]  is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, that
[02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:14.800]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've turned a
[02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:19.440]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:24.720]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:29.240]  attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal
[02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:33.920]  off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:37.960]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're
[02:06:37.960 --> 02:06:41.640]  asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:46.440]  Today, it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington DC, we have
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:52.360]  seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at
[02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:57.400]  infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at
[02:06:57.400 --> 02:07:04.680]  prisonplanet.tv. Hi folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the
[02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:09.120]  Silver Lungs Generator. Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:13.120]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the
[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:16.920]  solution through the lungs. The respiratory system is the first line of
[02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:20.840]  defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator
[02:07:20.840 --> 02:07:25.640]  infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:30.520]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:35.480]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can
[02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:40.120]  now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:44.280]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:50.640]  production fast and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more

[02:07:58.160 --> 02:08:08.360]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:18.720]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. I've had Patrick Henningson, who is a
[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:22.040]  longtime reporter and documentary filmmaker. In fact, he's reported for us
[02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:27.120]  from Copenhagen-Denmark Climate Summit. He was there barricaded in the local pub
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:32.160]  and watched white people being drug out of cars, being beaten up. It's admitted
[02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:37.120]  that many of the riots were racial. There's also gangs of white kids with
[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:42.480]  black kids running around in other smaller cities who are just looting using
[02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:48.240]  it as an excuse for criminal action. But, you know, I've gotten some emails, I've
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:52.800]  seen some comments saying, Alex, this is political. Well, if this is political, this
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:57.200]  is not part of the political group I'm with. I'm sorry, Burning Down Family
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:02.240]  Homes. In fact, we were just showing a photo of that earlier and images of
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:09.120]  women jumping out of their burning homes. Really, the rioters aren't going down to
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:13.840]  parliament. They're not going over to BBC. They're not going over to to Sky
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:19.320]  Television. They're not going to the MI6 because the police would just
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:25.680]  shoot you there. No, they're burning down neighborhoods and little shops. And I
[02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:31.080]  guess that's political to some of you. And you know what? I guess at the end of
[02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:35.680]  the day, that is what we're going to see in this country as the welfare checks
[02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:38.160]  don't buy the goods anymore. You're still going to get your welfare check. You're
[02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:41.480]  still going to get your food stamp card. It's just that the allotment isn't going
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:46.440]  to go up. The cola isn't going to go up. And I'm not saying that your social
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:50.480]  security is welfare folks. The point is, it's an entitlement. It's something the
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:55.520]  government controls. And they're devaluing the dollar as JP Morgan
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:10:00.000]  announced. Gold's going to go to 2,500 by the end of the year or higher. That's MSNBC,
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:08.720]  CBC, because the dollar has been devalued. And other currencies are being
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:14.840]  devalued by the banking cartel. And so was Reginald Denny having, you know, his
[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:18.840]  face clubbed in with a brick because he was white. Was that political? Should I
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:24.480]  have like said, kill him? It's political. Mindlessly running around and burning
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:29.400]  things will empower the establishment to crack down and take everyone's rights.
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:36.800]  The British Ministry of Defense in 2007 said austerity because of the banking
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:42.000]  crisis, this is before it happened, would cause unrest and that they would set up a
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:46.640]  police state in response. The Rand Corporation says it. And you've got so
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:52.400]  many uninformed mental midgets out there who are smart enough to know the
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:56.720]  government's lying to them, but not sophisticated enough to know that we're
[02:10:56.720 --> 02:11:02.160]  a restorationist. We want to restore law and order, a rule of law, a constitution,
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:07.520]  private property, sovereignty, and a compact of men and women together to defend
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:14.160]  individual rights. Not the red terror model that is normally comes right after
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:21.240]  a bunch of poor people running around burning things. Okay? This is what allows
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:27.040]  the system to collapse things. Stir your historian. You are a, you know, top of your
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:33.960]  class lawyer, what Yale, you know, worked for Ron Paul, Army paratrooper. You've
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:39.000]  studied, you won awards for your papers on history. I mean, I'm not a rocket
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:44.160]  science, but I mean, isn't what I'm saying here just common sense history?
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:50.040]  Absolutely. It's the standard pattern. You know, it's caused chaos and they
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:54.320]  capitalize on it. And this is, this is what's been going on now in this country
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:57.160]  for decades. Well, you're not a good revolutionary patriot. You don't like
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:02.880]  burning down family dwellings. What's the problem? Like you said, you wind up with
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:07.440]  the French Revolution, rather than the American Revolution. You wind up with
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:11.600]  the guillotine and destruction of everyone's rights and then ruled by
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:16.040]  bosses. And you wind up with animal farm, you know, some animal equal, but some
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:19.680]  more equal than others. So you're not restoring the republic. You're just,
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:23.760]  you're carrying it down in a different way. And notice we're being singled out by
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:26.880]  the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, White House. I'm on the White House
[02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:35.720]  Enemies list. Total MSNBC, CNN, Nightline Demonization, 24-7, because we're the
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:39.920]  real Americans. We want real rule of law. We want the American system. We want to
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:44.760]  process and we've got the control left saying we're back because we don't want
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:48.720]  an American Arab Spring that Al Gore called for by the environmentalist
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:52.560]  burning things, said that last week. And he's calling for that here with his
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:55.800]  people because we're going to resist that. We're going to resist government
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:13:00.320]  tyranny, military tyranny, police tyranny, because we're for truth and justice,
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:05.200]  because we are with the founding fathers and follow their genius, their idea.
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:10.240]  We're the enemy because we are the hope. You the listeners of this show, we've got
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:15.040]  history. We're informed. We called this coming decades before and they know we've
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:18.600]  got the light of liberty in the gathering darkness and they want to snuff
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:22.440]  that liberty and it's up to you the listeners to spread this radio show and
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:27.440]  the videos and the information info wars.com for the four wins because we've
[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:32.920]  got to stand up now at this critical juncture. Stuart explain that the
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:36.160]  historical juncture we're at and the difference between a gelded disarmed
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:42.280]  public and an independent strong yeoman population. Well just that, that we were
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:46.000]  supposed to be sovereign citizens and sovereign states to take personal
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:51.080]  responsibility for our safety as the militia, as the posthee, as our own
[02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:55.760]  volunteer fire department, not turning it over to experts and not not
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:14:01.520]  gilding ourselves and the government is always offering you the free lunch. Just
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:05.760]  let us professionals handle it. You just go vote but don't have a gun.
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:09.880]  Don't organize for your own defense. Don't take personal responsibility for
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:13.560]  security of your neighborhood and your community. Leave it to North Carolina. Leave it to
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:17.840]  FEMA. We'll take care of you. That's what they want. They want us to become just like
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:20.840]  all the other countries throughout history that have gone down the road of
[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:25.560]  tyranny. And the way to counteract that is to do what they don't want. Form into
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:30.120]  posthee, start a militia in your county, take personal responsibility for your
[02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:35.000]  safety, learn how to shoot, go to an Apple C program, rifle class, which is
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:40.360]  free for $75 for the whole weekend and learn how to shoot and take personal
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:44.280]  responsibility and take it back from the ground up. That's the solution. And I want to
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:48.240]  warn folks about militias. Real, and I want you to continue, real militias are
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:53.080]  great. They're constitutional. But if guys come to you and say be part of
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:57.480]  something secret, let's go surveil the police department. That group's being led
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:02.680]  by a fed trying to set you up to create the illusion of dangerous secret groups.
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:08.040]  Real militias go to the city council and speak out. Real militias go help run
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:12.720]  soup kitchens. Real militias go and educate their police and invite them to
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:16.920]  be part of it or go to the sheriff and offer to assist or run for sheriff. Real
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:21.360]  militias are out in the open or you can, with your cousin, your brother, and one
[02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:26.160]  neighbor, have a military history club that is completely secret. Either go
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:30.640]  completely secret, still be totally lawful, or be completely public. Now I
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:35.080]  know you studied special forces operations, you know, behind enemy lines and
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:39.200]  communist situations, but isn't that the way to go, Stuart? Don't go either way.
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:43.160]  Totally dark, totally secret, or totally political and public, Stuart.
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:47.040]  That's what the founders did. They had the sons of Liberty, which was a secret organization,
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:51.240]  and they had their very public militias, because that's the way you get everybody
[02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:56.200]  in the community to get trained and united and take responsibility for
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:15:58.920]  themselves. That's what the founders intended. They did not want to speak
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:03.920]  agreement and hide. But so, yeah, do one or the other, but don't do the thing in
[02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:07.080]  the middle like you said. It's very, very wise. Well, the minute somebody comes
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:12.320]  even says, let's practice making pipe bombs, that is a fed trying to get you to
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:15.920]  be involved in criminal activity, so other people get scared and don't join
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:21.120]  real militias. All it is is a civil defense, local posse for the imploding
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:25.800]  society, and people are ready for this. They're ready. They're ready. We've got
[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:29.680]  to organize now with our neighbors, so if there's a total collapse and a
[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:34.120]  marauding crew of scum comes down the road, we're ready when you're out of town
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:37.160]  working, your neighbor's watching your wife. When he's out of town, you're
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:41.520]  watching them. We've got to get back to being real people. This is what all our
[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:46.240]  ancestors did in every culture. You either do this or you're overrun slaves.
[02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:50.240]  That's correct. You need community, and I think the first thing you should do is a
[02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:55.560]  neighborhood watch. That will take care of a lot of things all at one time. And
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:59.120]  that means a local neighborhood watch, not one run by the feds, where you're
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:03.560]  watching for people with Ron Paul stickers. That's right. It means, like you
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:06.760]  just said a minute ago, neighbors looking out for each other, and that can turn
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:10.240]  into an ad hoc militia when necessary. And then while you're doing that, you also
[02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:15.760]  work to establish a formal official county militia or county militia. You do
[02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:18.760]  both, but you got to get going. That's why I encourage folks to go to
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:24.000]  operationsleepinggiant.com, our new initiative to wake up veterans and
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:28.440]  focus on preparedness. All right, and closing as I'm ranting here, these are
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:32.320]  incredible times. Everything that's happening, Stuart, is proving that your
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:36.760]  analysis, mine, Ron Paul's, is a hundred percent dead on because we're following
[02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:41.000]  history. We know the globalist roadmap. We know what's coming next. Are you,
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:45.840]  because five years ago, I never got chills. Are you, and when I say chills, I mean
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:49.600]  hair on the back of my neck, my spidey sense has been off the chart the last
[02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:54.480]  six months, and it's getting more and more intense. Can you feel what's coming?
[02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:58.880]  Absolutely. I mean, I'm reading the book when money dies right now about the
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:04.360]  Weimar hyperinflation, and it's eerie and chilling to see the parallels. We're
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:08.360]  doing precisely the same thing that they did, and look where they wound up. They
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:13.360]  wound up with a hyperdictatorship, and so if we're going to avoid that, we need to
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:18.560]  step off the treadmill of the matrix and get back to being what the
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:22.800]  founders intended, which is sovereign people in sovereign communities. We have
[02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:29.360]  to. Well, that's it, Stuart. The system consciously, decades ago, but the real
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:34.880]  markers 12 years ago, made the decision to hyperinflate destroy us and set up the
[02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:37.800]  police state as the answer. They've already got it. Threat fusion centers,
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:43.560]  clergy response teams, emergency centers act all lined up. They are intending to
[02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:47.880]  go forward with this. That's what's so incredible about the magnitude of what we
[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:52.880]  face, but the good news is centralized systems don't work very well, and we, the
[02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:57.480]  Patriots, had decades-long jump on them because we saw what they were doing. We
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:02.280]  got laughs at a long time ago, Stuart, but not now. Well, we're still weak, though.
[02:19:02.280 --> 02:19:06.360]  The problem is, is a centralized system can kill a lot of people before
[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:10.120]  atomic collapses, and that's the danger. So what we have to do is make sure that
[02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:14.200]  we're as strong as possible in our local communities so that we are not
[02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:17.880]  desperate and hungry and starving, and they have less of a justification, then
[02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:22.080]  they get more of the military and police will say no inside with us. That's the
[02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:25.440]  goal. Well, you know we're being listened to at military bases all over the
[02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:29.160]  world right now, so the military is starting to wake up.
[02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:33.560]  Absolutely. I get I get I get messages all the time from active duty soldiers
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:37.160]  letting us know that, hey, they're not gonna join our organization because they
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:40.080]  don't want to be purged out of their unit, but they want to let us know that
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:44.600]  that they and at least half the guys in the unit agree completely, and so they
[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:49.080]  are waking up. But they're so susceptible to human nature, like in Katrina, they
[02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:52.800]  believe it's a real emergency, they're more likely to go along with unconstitutional
[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:56.640]  behavior, unconstitutional orders, and so that's what we have to do.
[02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:01.080]  Absolutely. Stir it, great job, great job, we'll be right back.

[02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:06.680]  GCN self-reliance update. GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for
[02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:10.080]  garden plants, flowers, and herbs. It's called proto-grow and it's so effective
[02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:13.680]  at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like
[02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:17.520]  crazy under practically any soil and light conditions. Now, here's the best part
[02:22:17.520 --> 02:22:20.840]  for our listeners who garden for self-reliance. Proto-grow's unique blend
[02:22:20.840 --> 02:22:24.480]  of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom
[02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:28.080]  set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time. Proto-grow works by
[02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:31.320]  providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic
[02:22:31.320 --> 02:22:34.400]  code for nutritional uptake in plants. Proto-grow's full spectrum plant
[02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:37.280]  fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10
[02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:40.680]  times the nutritional value. And if you want to double or triple the potency of
[02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:44.360]  herbs or wheatgrass, you can. If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with
[02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:48.240]  non-hybrids, it's now easy. GCN listeners who want to grow dirt-sheep superfoods
[02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:53.680]  should visit the Proto-grow website at GrowLikeCrazy.com. That's www.growlikecrazy.com

[02:24:00.360 --> 02:24:11.680]  You heard earlier Patrick Henningson, a reporter from England who was in South
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:20.400]  London in Brixton and witnessed racial attacks. If you have been in England and
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:24.280]  witnessed exactly what type of looting and attacks are going on in arson and
[02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:28.320]  you can get on the line and call us. I would love to hear from you. The toll
[02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:38.200]  free number is 800-259-9231-1800-259-9231 and we will get you up and on the
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:41.160]  air. I know most people can't call the toll free number from England but if you
[02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:47.560]  can call Skype or your country access code we'd love to hear from you. 800-259-9231
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:54.600]  Mark Moreno of Climate Depot is going to be joining us. Reporters reported that
[02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:59.360]  the Aspen Institute event last week, Al Gore was screaming, cussing, blowing up.
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:03.200]  Mark Moreno first reported that. I saw it in a bunch of mainstream newspapers
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:08.800]  including The Hill today, the big paper on Capitol Hill that indeed he did do
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:14.040]  that and he basically consented that their entire global warming takeover
[02:25:14.040 --> 02:25:18.400]  scam is in deep trouble. This is the same guy that told us NAFTA and GATT would
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:22.080]  double our industrial jobs in a decade and actually took more than half of
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:28.560]  those jobs. This is a good deal Larry. I got a good old boy accent. You can trust me.
[02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:32.600]  Look at that guy's eyes. I mean he is just, would you buy a car or an air
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:35.640]  conditioner from that guy? If he knocked on your door trying to sell you
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:40.960]  encyclopedia's what would you do? I mean man bear pig. So it's a real pleasure to
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:45.080]  watch him crash and burn. Now Soros is doing a little better. It's reported that
[02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:50.240]  he's probably the guy that that 800 and something mill and it was 87 mill and
[02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:57.640]  made 10 billion off of the dollar devaluation and if that's true that he
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:02.440]  got inside knowledge on S&P and that he's the one that made that money as the
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:07.680]  Daily Mail and others are pointing to and another reason Soros needs to get
[02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:12.440]  his bacon in the political fire. You know he's the guy that quote broke
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:19.280]  the Bank of England. Here is some of the other news. The rioting underclass
[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:28.440]  product of a diseased culture. Blackberry website hacked as company pledges to
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:35.440]  help cops find Brit rioters. Police to use plastic bullets on rampaging youth
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:40.880]  in Britain. Sony UK warehouse set ablaze as violence from London riots
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:49.880]  escalates. A 634 point stock market crash and eight more reasons why you
[02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:54.480]  should be deeply concerned that the US government has lost its triple A credit
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:27:00.560]  rating and then we have the satire article by Paul Joseph Watson. Cameron to
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:06.360]  step down recognize rioters as legitimate government because the exact
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:10.600]  type of activity Al Qaeda run and funded by the US and British governments was
[02:27:10.600 --> 02:27:16.040]  launched four months ago in Libya and they've been torching killing looting
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:21.880]  racially because it's it's it's Gaddafi's teamed up with African black African
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:29.200]  Libyans and so there's been a bunch of racial attacks on blacks you notice I
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:33.880]  was against that I'm outraged by people racially pulling over black people and
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:37.040]  shooting them and killing them because they're black at a fundamental level it
[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:40.640]  makes me sick just like it makes me sick that whites are being racially attacked
[02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:44.600]  it's disgusting behavior to pull over some completely innocent person and do
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:50.840]  that but hey why not have NATO announced a no-fly zone and have NATO start
[02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:55.480]  bombing all of England blowing up their TV stations and bombing their
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:59.920]  electrical power grid as they're doing in Libya because a group is rebelling and
[02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:06.120]  so you need to make them the official diplomatic of group and give them the
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:11.200]  government and put crowns on their heads and move them into Windsor Palace so
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:16.920]  Cameron to step down recognize rioters as legitimate government UK rebels to be
[02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:21.920]  given own embassy as humanitarian intervention looms given the fine
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:25.840]  example set in Libya it follows that the rebels who expressed their grievances
[02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:30.160]  against the establishment last night by burning and looting half of London and
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:33.960]  other cities around the UK should swiftly be given their own embassy and
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:37.440]  declared the legitimate government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland yes
[02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:42.200]  that would be very nice David Cameron and the Queen need to relinquish power
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:46.680]  immediately now that their authority to rule has been so clearly and
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:53.160]  justifiably undermined the actions of the police to disperse these rebels also
[02:28:53.160 --> 02:28:57.160]  amounts to an international war crime and mandates an immediate humanitarian
[02:28:57.160 --> 02:29:02.600]  intervention from NATO powers if Cameron and the Queen failed to step down and
[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:09.000]  recognize the rebels as the legitimate government US warplanes are on standby to
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:13.640]  enforcing no-fly zone over Great Britain reports are also circulating that NATO
[02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:17.680]  will target the prime minister and his entire family for assassination if he
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:23.000]  refuses to vacate London this is what was done with Gaddafi the rebels who are
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:27.400]  attempting to liberate themselves from the corrupt regime by ransacking JD
[02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:31.760]  sports clothing outlets should be embraced commended and supported by the
[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:35.600]  International Committee a community also they should be praised for burning down
[02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:40.560]  family homes and almost killing people saved by fire departments the bank
[02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:43.880]  accounts of the British government should be seized and handed over to the
[02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:47.920]  rebels immediately of course that was satire but we're illustrating absurdity
[02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:52.840]  by being absurd we'll be right back stay with us we're on the March the
[02:29:52.840 --> 02:30:02.200]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a very wealthy US
[02:30:02.200 --> 02:30:07.000]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in

[02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:08.040]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:12.240]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:32:12.240 --> 02:32:16.240]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:20.120]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:32:20.120 --> 02:32:24.400]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:28.560]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:32.880]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:32:32.880 --> 02:32:36.600]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[02:32:36.600 --> 02:32:40.760]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[02:32:40.760 --> 02:32:43.760]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:47.200]  solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information

[02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:33.000]  well Marco Reino was the senior advisor to the big committee researching
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:37.400]  whether climate change was man-made or not he runs the preeminent site
[02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:41.720]  researching the global crime bosses that want to be able to stop a type of
[02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:47.320]  toilet you have light bulb federal home inspections Obama has announced outside
[02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:52.320]  of law as our supreme ruler just like with the carbon taxes and regulations on
[02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:57.200]  power plants that aren't part of General Electric's insider operation that
[02:33:57.200 --> 02:34:01.960]  fire trucks concrete mixers semis heavy-duty pickups and all trucks in
[02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:06.960]  between well for the first time have to trim fuel consumption they already do
[02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:10.600]  that with the all the catalytic converters and emissions they've always
[02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:15.880]  been cut in emissions for two decades of heat trapping gases so that evil
[02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:19.760]  carbon dioxide under new efficiency standards announced Tuesday by
[02:34:19.760 --> 02:34:24.000]  President Obama the White House said the standards will save businesses
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:28.320]  billions of dollars in fuel cost oh yeah yeah right help reduce oil
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:32.720]  consumption and cut air pollution standards also apply to vehicle models
[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:40.120]  after 2014 or three years away this is just devastating and it's it's it's
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:47.200]  carbon rules but but the good news is despite all their fear mongering and
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:53.880]  Obama saying or his his mouthpiece Al Gore saying polar bears can't swim we've
[02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:58.760]  had some huge victories we're have Mark Moreno here to break that down for us
[02:34:58.760 --> 02:35:04.440]  some big big big victories have taken place in the last two weeks the Hadron
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:10.000]  Collider found and backed previous science that it's space ions that are
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:16.320]  forming most of the heat trapping clouds I am NASA's had to admit that more heat
[02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:21.000]  goes out of the atmosphere than they thought others like NASA have had to
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:27.760]  admit that carbon dioxide follows heat increases not the other way around three
[02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:32.240]  years ago was found in UK courts that Al Gore had flipped the graph and had
[02:35:32.240 --> 02:35:38.880]  carbon dioxide before the heat increases so a lot of things are coming out right
[02:35:38.880 --> 02:35:44.160]  now but the best news that Mark Moreno covered at climate depot calm and today
[02:35:44.160 --> 02:35:48.520]  I noticed it's in the Hill newspaper and other mainline publications confirming
[02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:55.280]  it was that he began a expletive laced tirade that we cannot repeat here and all
[02:35:55.280 --> 02:36:03.000]  but admitted that their system is falling apart and that they are not
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:08.520]  going to be able to get their overt carbon taxes on people so they've invested
[02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:14.120]  billions in getting the public to have to pay them a indulgence for the sin of
[02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:17.800]  breathing because we put off carbon dioxide just like cars do that plants
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:24.120]  then respirate from and live from and so their system is being routed according
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:29.120]  to the view and research of Mark Moreno and others so Mark please give us a
[02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:34.760]  breakdown of the devastating victories against the carbon mafia that the globe
[02:36:34.760 --> 02:36:40.040]  is having well the first thank you for having me on Alex the first victory is
[02:36:40.040 --> 02:36:46.280]  science and data and this is so compelling from A to Z the entire case
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:49.280]  for man-made global warming is collapsing you can start with Antarctica
[02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:54.960]  the Arctic Antarctica is at an air record CI extent the Arctic so many
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:58.080]  new studies have come out on the Arctic that are you ready for this drum roll
[02:36:58.080 --> 02:37:03.520]  please Andrew Revkin the mainstream lefty environmental reporter for the New
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:08.680]  York Times announced yesterday that he no longer believes the Arctic will face a
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:13.000]  death spiral and he actually says quote I'm not worried about the resilience of
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:16.800]  the Arctic and not worried about a tipping point and he rejects the idea of a
[02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:20.920]  death spiral this is a mainstream reporter bailing out on the probably
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:24.960]  the single greatest talking point that the global warmest have had these
[02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:28.880]  frightening and scary loss of the Arctic never mind that the low point of Arctic
[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:34.440]  ice 2007 was due to high-pressure days unusual winds ocean currents and not
[02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:39.360]  man-made to you to never mind that these we started monitoring the ice in 1979 at
[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:43.080]  the end of the global cooling scare so we picked the period where it had the
[02:37:43.080 --> 02:37:46.480]  most ice and then we've had a few you know two decades of warming followed by
[02:37:46.480 --> 02:37:50.520]  either cooling or no warming the high point in temperatures is still 1998 so
[02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:55.040]  from the A to Z polar bears at or near a historic population high the
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:37:59.400]  indigenous people in Canada say they're absolutely thriving even the polar bear
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:03.760]  that killed this kid recently was actually there was they were talking
[02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:08.800]  about how much ice there was in the area so you look at sea level Al Gore showed
[02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:12.640]  you maps of Florida half underwater sea level now not only is it not
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:16.040]  accelerating what some monitors are showing to you like a sea level these
[02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:21.840]  actually dropping since 2004 Mount Kilimanjaro Gour made a huge feature in
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:26.600]  its film now gaining ice and snow on every single issue that they have
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:30.680]  promoted they have not only egg on their face but they are being it is
[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:34.920]  revealing the utter collapse for their case and before you continue let me just
[02:38:34.920 --> 02:38:39.280]  back up what you're saying this is four days ago Arctic tipping point may not be
[02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:48.160]  reached BBC who carry the holy grail of brainwashing and guilting and propaganda
[02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:52.920]  they say right here writing in the Journal of Science the team found
[02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:58.800]  evidence that ice levels were 50% lower in the Arctic 5,000 years ago we've
[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:03.040]  done that for decades from the ice core but they do this this this scam every
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:06.600]  year where they show school kids in the general public on the news a satellite
[02:39:06.600 --> 02:39:12.200]  shot from the North Pole from space in the summer time lapse showing upwards
[02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:16.280]  of a half of the Arctic disappearing it always does that in the summer and then
[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:20.640]  Al Gore says there'll be no ice in one year and he says it every year and so
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:25.720]  again the route is completely they knew this decades ago why is the BBC in New
[02:39:25.720 --> 02:39:30.440]  York Times now admitting that polar bears can swim their numbers are up five
[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:35.560]  fold in 50 years that the Arctic used to be smaller why why is there a complete
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:40.000]  route happening the same reading and I studied this issue in the 90s remember
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:43.160]  the old before station the Amazon rainforest the Amazon's about to
[02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:46.600]  disappear we've all it'll be gone by the year 2000 this was in Disney films
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:49.880]  the National Geographic and kids shows they had children terrified the last
[02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:55.840]  tree was going to be cut turns out in 2009 the New York Times belatedly admitted
[02:39:55.840 --> 02:40:00.280]  that for every acre of rainforest cut 50 may be regenerating it was not such as
[02:40:00.280 --> 02:40:05.760]  a urgent cause after all they quoted a scientist saying they're calling it the
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:10.960]  galloping jungle old eco-scares don't just collapse overnight they have to die
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:14.160]  of slow death and what we're saying when you quote it from the BBC what we're
[02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:18.640]  hearing from Andrew Rebka in the New York Times this is actually an accelerated
[02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:21.520]  death but it doesn't collapse overnight there's way too much money for man-made
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:25.120]  global warming to collapse because the tens of billions of dollars just being
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:29.560]  poured into this climate con aren't going to go away scientists have made
[02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:33.640]  careers out of it foundations universities United Nations the media is
[02:40:33.640 --> 02:40:38.960]  invested our government's invested in it you have I will say this delicately
[02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:43.160]  people like John Holdren who need remedial science education he actually
[02:40:43.160 --> 02:40:47.920]  predicted that if man made to continue we'd have ice-free winters in the Arctic
[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:51.560]  and there's no science to back it up but this is a guy held up as a science are
[02:40:51.560 --> 02:40:57.840]  a man who stood toe-to-toe with Paul Ehrlich in the 70s warning of Pochari
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:03.040]  said there'd be no no ice in the Himalayas with no proof the greatest
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:08.520]  thing we talk about John Holdren John Lennon the ex beetle made a scientific
[02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:13.120]  jump out of people like Paul Ehrlich and John Holdren in 1979 he debated Dick
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:18.000]  Kavan on TV and mocked and ridiculed the overpopulation scare and now we know
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:21.840]  the new population scare is underpopulation and even some of the
[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:25.120]  same people who warned of overpopulation are retracting themselves as
[02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:30.040]  global population is stabilizing so it's just every scare they come up with
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:33.840]  faith well what's most shocking now about global warming Alex we have two
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:37.960]  two recent scientists in Australia have now openly descended one of them
[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:41.040]  professor Salby is gonna have a peer-reviewed studies showing that
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:44.800]  CO2 follows the temperature rise it's actually going to make it in the
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:48.440]  peer-reviewed journal skeptical skeptical scientists have been saying this for
[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:52.800]  years and Salby goes further he's actually claiming that the recent rise in
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:56.640]  CO2 isn't even human-caused it's all natural that humans don't even have that
[02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:01.000]  power to rise CO2 from our human activity in one scientist another one
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  Judith Curry who used to be a warmest is now converted to an almost hundred
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:09.040]  percent skeptic she says the new study could revolutionize man-made global
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:13.840]  warming but you don't even need that study again A to Z look at any claim
[02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:18.840]  Al Gore made the Al Gore is now reduced to looking at Blizzard's record cold
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:23.200]  blood droughts as proof of its theory there's no way to falsify the theory
[02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:27.440]  Al Gore and the man-made global warming movement have morphed into the
[02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:32.200]  predictions of Nostradamus the Mayan calendar it is not science anymore and
[02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:35.680]  there's always going to be extreme weather and every time there is he says
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:41.000]  pay me money and I'll fix everything now the problem is and I want you to get
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:46.680]  into his tirade at the Aspen Institute that you first broke from your sources
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:52.240]  now confirmed just blubbering anger by by the collectivist that want to be able
[02:42:52.240 --> 02:42:56.400]  to run our lives talk about that but then the problem is they don't care
[02:42:56.400 --> 02:43:01.280]  they're going ahead outside of congressional law and implementing all
[02:43:01.280 --> 02:43:06.680]  this garbage California is let me start with yes with that your second point our
[02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:12.880]  washing machines have been decimated by energy star EPA regulations based in
[02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:16.840]  climate affairs and here's what I mean no I bought new ones a few years ago they
[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:20.400]  broken wouldn't work bought more new ones they broke and didn't work and now I'm
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:26.240]  trying to find an old junky one in 1996 1997 consumer reports gave a pass to
[02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:30.200]  100% of the washing machines in terms of the water flow the energy the cleaning
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:35.840]  they all passed fast forward to recent years and now we're finding even high
[02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:41.040]  end washing machines are failing the test why because our government has
[02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:45.920]  stopped washing machines of power and energy they no longer can clean clothes
[02:43:45.920 --> 02:43:49.360]  they're going after a refrigerator next they're actually gonna go after ice
[02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:53.560]  makers they've gone after our shower heads our faucets our toilets they're
[02:43:53.560 --> 02:43:57.360]  going and here's the headline of the day Alex the American SUV is
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:04.080]  regulatory dead as we speak Obama's new regulations of 50 mile an hour plus per
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:09.840]  gallon rules by 2025 completely lay waste to the SUV they're gonna cram
[02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:14.240]  electric cars down that's what which the president of Audi correctly stated you
[02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:18.080]  have to be an idiot only idiots buy these cars what they've only sold like
[02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:23.000]  like a thousand volts or something no one wants their crud people will be
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:27.240]  dying in Minnesota other places in the winter with their cars run out of juice
[02:44:27.240 --> 02:44:30.120]  and they can't refuel when they're stuck on the side of the road under it you
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:34.520]  know 10-foot snowdrift this is life and death issue you have the head of GM
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:39.080]  calling for gas tax increase so they can sell their cars that no one wants to buy
[02:44:39.080 --> 02:44:43.480]  so it's it's they've already succeeded in many ways and then of course we have
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:47.640]  the EPA regulations lying and wait that's gonna regulate what we exhale from
[02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:52.640]  our mouth to you to we inhale oxygen exhale to you to we have those lying and
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:56.720]  wait Obama has wisely decided to wait until after the next presidential
[02:44:56.720 --> 02:45:00.880]  election but we are facing very serious threats and that is gonna be the
[02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:04.600]  regulatory nightmare of the world we're already talking governments around the
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:07.520]  world the Japanese government is telling their people they made it they had to
[02:45:07.520 --> 02:45:11.320]  go to bed an hour early to fight global warming the head of the UN climate
[02:45:11.320 --> 02:45:14.760]  panel Regenda Pichari has said with the Americans can no longer have ice water
[02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:18.600]  in restaurants that that's too but meanwhile all these guys live in
[02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:22.680]  incredible palaces Nat Rothschild you know over there running the the climate
[02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:28.800]  exchange has giant yachts jets private islands lavish parties the Prince
[02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:33.240]  Charles calling to cut everybody's you know tell an old lady something to take
[02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:38.040]  hot baths I mean these people are so incredibly disgusting but speaking of
[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:42.920]  that speaking of John Lennon on national TV talking about overpopulation
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:48.400]  being a fraud here is that clip from the TV show you mentioned Mark Moreno here
[02:45:48.400 --> 02:45:53.960]  it is how does Yoko feel about overpopulation as a woman I believe well
[02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:58.920]  I think the problem is not overpopulation as people believe to be but
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:05.320]  it's more of a balance of things what you know like food some part of the world
[02:46:05.320 --> 02:46:10.600]  is wasted your food and some parts you know nobody has food and that kind of
[02:46:10.600 --> 02:46:14.640]  balance if that is solved I don't think you'd be worried so much about over
[02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:19.280]  population I think it's a bit of a joke the way people have made this
[02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:22.720]  overpopulation thing into a kind of myth I don't really believe it you know I
[02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:26.720]  think whatever happens will balance itself out and work itself out it's
[02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:29.760]  all right for us all living saying oh well there's enough of us so we won't
[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:33.200]  have any more don't let anybody else live I don't believe in that I think we've
[02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:36.840]  got enough food and money to feed everybody and I think the natural balance
[02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:41.160]  even though all people last longer I'm sure there's enough room for us and some
[02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:45.360]  of them can go to the moon anyway you think there's enough if it were yeah I
[02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:48.920]  don't believe overpopulation you know I think that's just a kind of myth but
[02:46:48.920 --> 02:46:52.920]  government has thrown out to keep your mind off Vietnam and Ireland and all the
[02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:58.640]  important subjects oh I think you're wrong about that oh I don't care
[02:46:58.640 --> 02:47:03.960]  and there you have it John Lennon from the grave are making a scientific jump
[02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:07.960]  out of Obama's science advisor John Holdren and Paul Ehrlich by the way Paul
[02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:11.480]  Ehrlich called for forced sterilization agents in our water to reduce
[02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:15.720]  population he was called worse than the Hitler by his contemporaries in 1960s
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:19.400]  in 1970s John Holdren opposed the agricultural
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:24.200]  regal revolution of Norman Borlaug who won a Nobel Prize by bringing golden
[02:47:24.200 --> 02:47:28.600]  rights to Asia and feeding billions of people and creating you know a better
[02:47:28.600 --> 02:47:31.640]  life for people you know why John Holdren opposed it because he didn't want
[02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:36.160]  our earth to support more people it is as Patrick Moore the former founder of
[02:47:36.160 --> 02:47:41.280]  Greenpeace said environmentalism today is the most anti-human agenda and that's
[02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:44.520]  what we're finding in Africa we have people like Governor Jerry Brown in
[02:47:44.520 --> 02:47:48.480]  California who said at UN conferences I interviewed him in 2002 at the Earth
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:52.640]  Conference the developing world can't emulate Western prosperity because the
[02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:56.200]  earth couldn't handle it we need something like 10 or 20 more earths to
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:48:01.200]  handle it here you have white wealthy Westerners telling people of color 1.6
[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:05.440]  billion of them don't have running water electricity living in dire poverty
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:10.200]  their children dying an infant mortality living in huts made of dung being told
[02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:14.440]  by white wealthy Westerners they can't have what we have because the earth can't
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:19.000]  handle it because of fraudulent man-made global warming fears if that is not a
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:24.560]  racist message I don't know of anything else that is we have people at Ugandan
[02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:29.600]  activists in Africa saying that Al Gore uses more electricity in a day than they
[02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:34.320]  use in a year they recognize what's going on here India has said they won't sign
[02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:37.920]  on to emission restrictions when 40% of their residents don't have running
[02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:42.720]  water and electricity this madness has to be stopped the problem is it is now
[02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:47.840]  shifted over to an unelected bureaucracy in the EPA and the UN can do a lot
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:51.480]  even without treaties and the United States can commit us to a lot without
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:56.120]  even having the Senate ratify the good news is the good news is we're starting
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:49:01.600]  to turn the tide and if we continue to realize just how monstrous these people
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:06.880]  are we can defeat them and stop letting them have the fake moral high ground from
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:10.720]  their palaces and you know you're mentioning the death sentence for over
[02:49:10.720 --> 02:49:14.280]  a billion people in the third world Lord Monkton's actuaries and others have
[02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:17.680]  proven that the UN admits it over the next decade if they put any of these in
[02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:23.880]  place they tell the third world at the Copenhagen event two years ago right on
[02:49:23.880 --> 02:49:28.120]  the heels of the climate gate coming out that hey don't worry we're gonna tax the
[02:49:28.120 --> 02:49:32.560]  West and give you money then they got the treaty and it was right at double
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:38.160]  the carbon cuts for them that we would have a total death sentence I mean you
[02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:43.240]  know it's annoying if your gas prices go up and you know you can barely live but
[02:49:43.240 --> 02:49:46.600]  it's one thing if you're in Africa on two dollars a day or less this is a death
[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:51.400]  sentence yeah even innocuous things in UK they were gonna buy local and not have
[02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:56.680]  food imported who did that affect Kenyan farmers in Africa rebelled when the UK
[02:49:56.680 --> 02:50:00.680]  tried to do this because their livelihood were these fruit exports so every
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:05.960]  action has a reaction and what's most repulsive about the man-made global
[02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:09.920]  warming movement is the idea and this is this was mentioned by UK scientists
[02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:14.280]  Philip Scott it's a new form of colonialism it's white wealthy Westerners
[02:50:14.280 --> 02:50:18.960]  going into Africa and South America and telling these governments you can't
[02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:23.400]  develop you can't use your natural resources the way you want to I interviewed
[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:28.320]  a South African activist in a few years ago who said a that the developing
[02:50:28.320 --> 02:50:31.680]  world should tell the developed world ie the Western world the United States to
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:35.280]  go to hell if they're telling them they can't develop their resources unless
[02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:40.240]  Washington and England and France and Germany are willing to bomb their cities
[02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:45.320]  and level them back to swamps wetlands and for us we have no business telling
[02:50:45.320 --> 02:50:49.200]  Brazil that they can develop their force and they've called it in Brazil is
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:55.520]  sitting on a desert of gold because they can't touch their land because of
[02:50:55.520 --> 02:50:59.720]  international treaties Obama has told the the international community you can't
[02:50:59.720 --> 02:51:04.040]  have coal plants in Africa they need nuclear in Africa to bring running
[02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:08.040]  water China can build being stopped but China can build three new ones a week we
[02:51:08.040 --> 02:51:13.240]  get about three a year and mark as you know Al Gore Lord Rothschild Rockefeller's
[02:51:13.240 --> 02:51:18.200]  Oprah Winfrey they're not stupid when they put these global environmental
[02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:22.720]  rules in they admit it they're all selectively enforced the EPA doesn't
[02:51:22.720 --> 02:51:27.520]  let new coal plants open that are clean unless it's general electric what seven
[02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:31.320]  months ago he gave them a waiver the day the new stuff went into effect he gives
[02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:35.560]  his buddies healthcare waivers McDonald's doesn't have to buy it but a mom and
[02:51:35.560 --> 02:51:39.600]  pop does have to buy insurance for their employees and they go out of business so
[02:51:39.600 --> 02:51:46.080]  really it's all just about they say what you can do how you can live your life
[02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:50.060]  and they selectively enforce however they want it's nothing but a green
[02:51:50.060 --> 02:51:55.800]  mafia and it's time to recognize them for the Nazis they are you study the
[02:51:55.800 --> 02:52:01.200]  green movement after Germany fell with Hitler the eugenicist started the green
[02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:04.360]  movement here in the US and England as you know mark and then I've made the
[02:52:04.360 --> 02:52:08.280]  film in game blueprint for global enslavement and they said they said we've
[02:52:08.280 --> 02:52:12.720]  got to now pose as environmentalist and conservationist so we can take control
[02:52:12.720 --> 02:52:17.280]  of society and teach people they're bad so we can have one-child policies and
[02:52:17.280 --> 02:52:23.160]  and that's what they've done and we need to really recognize just how purely
[02:52:23.160 --> 02:52:29.600]  wicked and evil these obese demonic man-bear pigs are your comments on that
[02:52:29.600 --> 02:52:34.360]  yeah well you mentioned Germany and right now the German climate advisor a
[02:52:34.360 --> 02:52:38.880]  man named Schellenhuber is proposing a co2 budget for every man woman and child
[02:52:38.880 --> 02:52:43.320]  on the planet monitored by an international agency this follows the
[02:52:43.320 --> 02:52:47.880]  UK proposal for employees to carry carbon ration cards with a government
[02:52:47.880 --> 02:52:52.920]  monitors your air travel your thermostat your car mileage this is and this is
[02:52:52.920 --> 02:52:57.120]  what George beyond what George Orwell envisioned in his novel 1984 you have
[02:52:57.120 --> 02:53:02.200]  Nancy Pelosi going to China to warn that we need a complete inventory on every
[02:53:02.200 --> 02:53:06.160]  aspect of our lives to fight man-made global warming they're telling us
[02:53:06.160 --> 02:53:10.240]  openly Al Gore talks about the climate bill being key to forwarding global
[02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:16.480]  governance they want they want that monitor every aspect of your life and
[02:53:16.480 --> 02:53:21.400]  that is not hyperbole that is absolute what they're saying their verbatim
[02:53:21.400 --> 02:53:25.280]  message and what's most frightening is you have Republicans infected by this
[02:53:25.280 --> 02:53:29.920]  you have Mayor Bloomberg in New York if you can call him a Republican actually
[02:53:29.920 --> 02:53:33.000]  bragging that he's helping with I think it's the NRDC or one of the
[02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.840]  environmental groups stopping hundreds of coal plants from being built in
[02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:39.400]  America half of our electricity comes from coal and we're going to be big
[02:53:39.400 --> 02:53:42.760]  people dying he went out it's incredible in the winter and you have people like
[02:53:42.760 --> 02:53:47.600]  Chris Christie who's a tea party hero bragging openly first of all that he
[02:53:47.600 --> 02:53:51.160]  agrees with Al Gore on man-made global warming and second of all that he's
[02:53:51.160 --> 02:53:55.080]  stopping all coal plants in New Jersey well that's because it's a big business
[02:53:55.080 --> 02:54:00.040]  for them they know what it's all about Mark Moreno we want to thank you and as
[02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:03.440]  they continue to squeeze the resistance is only going to mount thanks to you and
[02:54:03.440 --> 02:54:07.880]  others our credibility is exploding of their credibility is imploding and and
[02:54:07.880 --> 02:54:13.560]  Al Gore's reduced to a blubbering cussing man bear pig enjoy Al Gore's meltdown
[02:54:13.560 --> 02:54:18.320]  he's earned it he's a utter and complete failure at this point and he knows it
[02:54:18.320 --> 02:54:22.840]  after spending $300 million all right Mark Moreno we'll talk to you soon all
[02:54:22.840 --> 02:54:26.520]  right there he goes from climate depot calm ladies and gentlemen we are going
[02:54:26.520 --> 02:54:31.120]  to beat these green Nazis the genetic engineering all that kind of stuff are
[02:54:31.120 --> 02:54:37.480]  serious threats the toxic waste dumping that's real best feed all a in the
[02:54:37.480 --> 02:54:41.800]  plastics fluoride in the water that's all real stuff I don't want to drink
[02:54:41.800 --> 02:54:46.360]  poison but the people that run the environmental movement a keep you away
[02:54:46.360 --> 02:54:51.800]  from real issues and be it's all about a power grab now shows almost over the
[02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:56.600]  Fed has announced they're going to keep rates low through mid 2013 that probably
[02:54:56.600 --> 02:54:59.720]  means they're getting ready to raise them because they always lie you know
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:03.840]  that we play green spans saying that we can just print money so we won't default
[02:55:03.840 --> 02:55:08.040]  now that's an oxymoron that means they will default by hyperinflation they
[02:55:08.040 --> 02:55:13.000]  just won't officially default the Dow has been up and down all day to down 51
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:21.080]  points right now the Nasdaq's up 16.11 at 10,758 80 that's where the Dow is
[02:55:21.080 --> 02:55:27.600]  but the biggest news is that JP Morgan came out and said due to inflation all
[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:33.000]  major commodities are set to go up and now here's MSNBC JP Morgan or CNBC said
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:38.720]  Monday that expect spot gold prices to climb to $2,500 an ounce or higher by
[02:55:38.720 --> 02:55:45.120]  year-end or very on very high volatility following the downgrade of US debt that
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:51.000]  signifies the insiders know they are going with the hyperinflation model and
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:56.000]  that's what low interest rates also signify Ted Anderson I wanted to give
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:59.720]  people the opportunity here at the end of the broadcast who've waited and waited
[02:55:59.720 --> 02:56:04.360]  and waited oh golds 300 that's too much oh it's a thousand too much it's 1600
[02:56:04.360 --> 02:56:09.360]  too much it's 1700 80 and then went down a little today then back up the point is
[02:56:09.360 --> 02:56:13.400]  you bought gold and silver in the last few months you're running out of it at
[02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:16.880]  the lower prices and then it's going to go up next week but then by then it
[02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:20.480]  should be up even more so that gold will be a good deal people need to take
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:24.200]  advantage of this if people also you know you got 40 something brokers the
[02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:27.920]  phones are lit up if they're busy leave your name and number they'll call you

[03:00:14.440 --> 03:00:20.400]  does it signify to have JP Morgan come out and say gold 2500 by the end of the
[03:00:20.400 --> 03:00:23.880]  year or higher and what does it signify on top of that to have the federal
[03:00:23.880 --> 03:00:29.400]  reserve come out today and say we're not going to raise interest rates from my
[03:00:29.400 --> 03:00:36.320]  research that will only intensify overall inflation correct only way that
[03:00:36.320 --> 03:00:39.360]  they can keep the interest rates down they have no other tricks up their
[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:43.080]  sleeve the only way they can keep interest rates down is by printing money
[03:00:43.080 --> 03:00:47.680]  and pushing it into the system by making loans and mostly buying US
[03:00:47.680 --> 03:00:52.240]  government securities like treasury bonds notes and bills and that's how
[03:00:52.240 --> 03:00:55.400]  they're going to force the interest rates down that means they're printing
[03:00:55.400 --> 03:00:59.520]  money they're going to destroy the value of people's savings in the United
[03:00:59.520 --> 03:01:04.160]  States man I hope people can wake up to that here's another one Bloomberg has
[03:01:04.160 --> 03:01:09.360]  it as a headline right here says Vietnam Central Bank allows gold imports to
[03:01:09.360 --> 03:01:13.440]  stabilize market and I can tell you right now that's telling you who's
[03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:18.160]  controlling that country not the Vietnam government the Vietnam Central Bank
[03:01:18.160 --> 03:01:22.320]  well how many of our boys did we lose during the Vietnam War because we're
[03:01:22.320 --> 03:01:26.280]  fighting it for the central banks we did it for them we're not we're fighting
[03:01:26.280 --> 03:01:30.080]  the wars that we're in right now because of the central banks and I'm tired of it
[03:01:30.080 --> 03:01:35.240]  the United States has a Constitution we should not be turning our control over
[03:01:35.240 --> 03:01:40.360]  a banking cartel yeah we shouldn't be ruled by foreign criminal banks that
[03:01:40.360 --> 03:01:43.840]  have signed us on to all of the debt they created so they could buy up the
[03:01:43.840 --> 03:01:47.120]  planet and leave us sitting with the bill it's like they had a hundred courts
[03:01:47.120 --> 03:01:50.920]  banquet and then delivered the bill to our house and have a SWAT team standing
[03:01:50.920 --> 03:01:55.680]  by of we don't pay it while Lord Rothschild and Al Gore get fatter and
[03:01:55.680 --> 03:01:59.840]  fatter telling us they want to put carbon taxes on us I mean it's just
[03:01:59.840 --> 03:02:06.920]  amazing Ted again you've got a whole list of radio specials mentioned some
[03:02:06.920 --> 03:02:10.240]  more of those for listeners that need to take advantage of it well like I said I
[03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:13.960]  mean we were talking about those survival bags of dimes and man I tell you
[03:02:13.960 --> 03:02:18.200]  people need survival bags of dimes because these dimes are real silver
[03:02:18.200 --> 03:02:24.040]  constitutional silver pre-1964 silver for two thousand eight hundred and thirty
[03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:28.080]  one dollars you're going to get one thousand dimes that you're going to be
[03:02:28.080 --> 03:02:32.280]  able to use as money when everything falls apart and believe me you'll need
[03:02:32.280 --> 03:02:37.160]  small gold too that's why I'm I'm so hot on this Frank coin because it's a fifth
[03:02:37.160 --> 03:02:41.240]  of an ounce of gold and when it comes down to making change I mean for goodness
[03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:46.280]  sakes it's almost two thousand dollars to buy one ounce bullion coins now you
[03:02:46.280 --> 03:02:49.360]  know you're gonna have to buy groceries or something that's why I like small
[03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:53.480]  gold too you know it people should be moving right now I mean we have the
[03:02:53.480 --> 03:02:59.000]  buffalo coins and and the quarter ounce coin that we use to fund the campaign for
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:02.280]  liberty I mean there's just so many different coins that we have but but
[03:03:02.280 --> 03:03:05.760]  what people need to do is they need to get it into their mind this is not a
[03:03:05.760 --> 03:03:10.260]  fire drill this is the real thing the United States dollars losing purchasing
[03:03:10.260 --> 03:03:14.400]  power even if you have only ten thousand dollars in the bank that ten thousand
[03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:18.000]  dollars might only buy you two thousand dollars with the goods in just a couple
[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:23.240]  of years absolutely eight hundred six eight six two three seven you've been
[03:03:23.240 --> 03:03:27.480]  having to go up on prices how long do you have to go up on prices on the gold
[03:03:27.480 --> 03:03:31.720]  and silver you just mentioned Alex I already I'm gonna be holding it till
[03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:36.080]  midnight but I can tell you gold increased fifty dollars just today alone
[03:03:36.080 --> 03:03:41.720]  today so obviously the prices are gonna be going up I can't hold them the
[03:03:41.720 --> 03:03:46.440]  markets just driving that direction and so it's gonna happen you might as well
[03:03:46.440 --> 03:03:50.360]  get your position today because I have to reposition myself and I'm gonna have
[03:03:50.360 --> 03:03:55.160]  to pay the higher prices eight hundred eight hundred six eight six two two
[03:03:55.160 --> 03:03:59.240]  three seven eight hundred six eight six two three seven and closing Michael Moore
[03:03:59.240 --> 03:04:06.060]  to Obama show some guts arrest S&P I agree with him at one level S&P should
[03:04:06.060 --> 03:04:10.960]  be arrested for knowingly being paid by the big banks to certify the derivative
[03:04:10.960 --> 03:04:15.400]  fraud three years ago and before that five years ago and going back over a
[03:04:15.400 --> 03:04:21.640]  decade ago but the same mega banks bought and paid for S&P Moody's and
[03:04:21.640 --> 03:04:27.440]  others many many years ago and so he should love S&P they're financed by the
[03:04:27.440 --> 03:04:32.720]  very same bankers that put Obama in you I mean you just got to love it Ted I
[03:04:32.720 --> 03:04:37.760]  really appreciate you coming on with us I'll be back tomorrow my friends 11 a.m.
