[01:13.360 --> 01:18.320]  hour and then we're going to look at these studies that have come out a new
[01:18.320 --> 01:23.280]  big Harvard study just came out a few days ago that we mentioned yesterday
[01:23.280 --> 01:29.280]  about what fluoride is doing to children's brains massive IQ reduction
[01:30.320 --> 01:35.040]  and then Fritz Springmeyer is going to be in with us coming up in the third hour
[01:35.040 --> 01:41.520]  today in studio and I've met Fritz a few times when he visited Austin more than
[01:41.520 --> 01:44.720]  a decade ago it's the first time about 15 years ago
[01:47.040 --> 01:53.040]  and he is here in Texas visiting his father and so he's going to be in

[02:11.920 --> 02:16.560]  well but things are getting so overwhelming I know a lot of people just
[02:16.560 --> 02:20.800]  punch you out and say I can't handle it anymore because it's getting so crazy
[02:22.240 --> 02:28.640]  and I have reached total information overload at this point but I am going to
[02:28.640 --> 02:36.560]  do my best to go through a lot of this news today not only in this hour but also
[02:37.520 --> 02:40.640]  in the hours that we have guessed on with us
[02:42.160 --> 02:46.160]  that said I want to open the phones up for first time callers
[02:48.480 --> 02:52.640]  to specifically talk about I mean I'd like to get your take on this you can add some other
[02:52.640 --> 02:56.240]  point if you like but I'd like to get your take I'd like to hear what you have to say
[02:56.240 --> 03:03.840]  about the fact that those of us that fight this new world order we've been awake so long
[03:05.600 --> 03:10.080]  I'm talking about most our listeners that we've just gotten comfortable with it even
[03:10.080 --> 03:14.400]  though it's horrific it's horrible we tend to get acclimated to it
[03:16.720 --> 03:20.880]  and what am I getting at all over the country police and military
[03:20.880 --> 03:29.760]  are being told get ready for total collapse in October I could open the phones up right now
[03:29.760 --> 03:33.840]  and have police and military call it and say yes we've been told that it's in the news they're
[03:33.840 --> 03:39.840]  preparing riot gear and for civil unrest and brigades for every major city I mean that's
[03:39.840 --> 03:44.800]  all being announced as well I'm not saying that's going to happen in October or November
[03:44.800 --> 03:51.040]  the point is they're telling police it will happen you've heard them here on the show but
[03:51.040 --> 03:56.880]  you've also seen about 95% of that admitted in the mainstream media I mean most of this
[03:56.880 --> 04:02.480]  is now admitted now and they're saying oh it's a financial collapse more banks are going to go under
[04:02.480 --> 04:09.520]  QE 3 war with Iran war with Syria war with Russia this is one of those times that we're
[04:09.520 --> 04:15.600]  now building up to where all the frantic craziness that we've seen so far
[04:18.240 --> 04:22.960]  has just been the birthing pains or you know you think of big storms hit you because your
[04:22.960 --> 04:26.800]  trees are blowing and stuff and then the actual hurricane hits you you've been in a hurricane
[04:26.800 --> 04:31.680]  I've been in a couple and then trees are breaking and you hear a window blow out and there's water
[04:31.680 --> 04:40.880]  coming into the yeah that's that's kind of the point we're reaching here and I just don't know
[04:40.880 --> 04:46.640]  what the general public's going to do evil this continues forward I mean they have no idea what
[04:46.640 --> 04:51.280]  this country is going to look like when the globalists plan to finally break this country's back

[07:13.280 --> 07:17.760]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our
[07:17.760 --> 07:23.280]  friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it

[07:57.600 --> 08:10.800]  survivalseedbank.com big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[08:10.800 --> 08:29.680]  well so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[08:29.680 --> 08:36.160]  all right i want to make a general announcement here at the start of this hour and then i want
[08:36.160 --> 08:41.280]  to just open the phones up and take your calls and i will intersperse the incredible news we're
[08:41.280 --> 08:46.400]  going to be breaking down and covering throughout the next three hours we've got tyrell ventura
[08:46.400 --> 08:51.680]  joining us to give us the latest on jessie ventura's tv show that's been censored and a lot more
[08:51.680 --> 08:56.000]  he's got some breaking news for us on that front we're going to have fritz springmeyer in studio
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.240]  we're also going to have a doctor on to talk about this new report that guys will you repull that
[09:00.240 --> 09:05.920]  from yesterday uh harvard looked at more than a dozen major recent studies in the us including
[09:05.920 --> 09:10.560]  that sodium fluoride and its derivatives in the water massively is reducing iq
[09:14.160 --> 09:18.800]  and uh that was known in the 20s that's why they put it in the water in the soviet union but we're
[09:18.800 --> 09:28.720]  going to be looking at that and several other big issues now this is the big enchilada that i want
[09:28.720 --> 09:41.680]  to discuss here today the big issue facing us is the fact that the form of government we're living
[09:41.680 --> 09:54.400]  under is well known in think tank white papers government white papers and at phd level schooling
[09:54.400 --> 10:02.080]  and specialty training systems for government the information we cover on this show is an absolute
[10:02.080 --> 10:10.400]  known admitted fact within the actual superclass 6000 globalists serving less than 20 families
[10:10.400 --> 10:15.120]  and that's in their own words the head of the kissinger group who's been on the show roth cob
[10:16.160 --> 10:22.240]  i concur with his analysis from the outside he's on the inside 6000 global super gophers
[10:22.240 --> 10:27.360]  serving less than 20 families who are now mopping up the last few sovereign nations
[10:29.920 --> 10:35.120]  they are eugenicist they believe the family is bad they believe sovereignty is bad
[10:35.120 --> 10:40.400]  they believe anyone basically being able to tie their shoelaces is bad they want you dead
[10:41.200 --> 10:45.360]  but to do that they've got to soft kill you and poison you so you're confused and mentally
[10:45.360 --> 10:53.520]  retarded and addled so that when they start the real mass exterminations no one figures it out
[10:54.160 --> 11:00.160]  and that people go ahead and follow the orders including the security forces that are protecting
[11:00.160 --> 11:06.240]  them during the mass culling process and then of course the globalist you'll notice these
[11:06.240 --> 11:12.240]  facilities those of you that are inside of them will then retreat to an inner redoubt and kill you
[11:12.240 --> 11:16.640]  i know you won't listen now but later down the road if we can't stop them and you get to that
[11:16.640 --> 11:22.880]  point you're in the redoubt and you notice the setup you're going to be be selected because you
[11:22.880 --> 11:27.520]  follow orders in her so i guess actually we won't be able to beat it at that point you'll have to
[11:28.080 --> 11:31.600]  i guess people that would be selected to be minions plus most of it will be robot
[11:32.400 --> 11:36.720]  i mean that's really what they're going to launch the mass extermination is once they've got the
[11:36.720 --> 11:43.920]  robot ground forces in place the skynet force which is a pentagon term before they made a
[11:43.920 --> 11:49.200]  terminator movie in the 80s that's that's that's not the pentagon isn't imitating movies movies
[11:49.200 --> 11:54.720]  are in imitating the pentagon there was a whole fleet of robot space planes in orbit by the late
[11:54.720 --> 12:02.560]  1970s with du shabo rounds in a meteor gun type technology oh that gets the nsa going right there
[12:02.560 --> 12:10.480]  let me tell you but i will continue on with the information imagine power mad elites who were
[12:10.480 --> 12:17.520]  social Darwinist who have this vision of a world without the ugly masses as they see us who want
[12:17.520 --> 12:22.960]  to establish a world government to get control of the finances to implode the economies in
[12:22.960 --> 12:30.640]  increments while posing as the saviors the entire time getting the world population in the position
[12:30.640 --> 12:37.040]  of no sovereign nations to resist no families to resist no culture to resist show the mass
[12:37.040 --> 12:43.680]  murder can begin in earnest because see i've got all this news look at me here i've got i've got
[12:43.680 --> 12:49.360]  probably 300 articles in front of me today it's totally insane each one more crazy than the next
[12:49.360 --> 13:00.880]  but what is the point in covering any of this what is the point in covering any of this if
[13:04.960 --> 13:06.400]  i don't talk about the big picture
[13:09.600 --> 13:15.440]  i mean what is the point let me just read you a few headlines here us follows russia
[13:15.440 --> 13:22.800]  and using drones to spy on protesters trendy alert how the global elite constructed an army
[13:22.800 --> 13:28.960]  of agenda 21 advocates very important the assault on the second amendment precursor to
[13:28.960 --> 13:45.760]  martial law in america there it all is up at info wars dot com and our auxiliary system prison
[13:45.760 --> 13:53.360]  planet dot com as well as prison planet dot tv obama's greenies to cause power blackouts
[13:53.360 --> 14:01.200]  and raid hikes told you about that years ago now it's now it's now it's here dhs prepares
[14:01.200 --> 14:10.160]  face off with america in public yeah they take our money and they are arming to the teeth against us
[14:10.160 --> 14:15.840]  while teaching the police and military that we are absolute trash and filth and all the new
[14:15.840 --> 14:22.320]  promo videos and training manuals has white shooters shooting up minorities and bombing
[14:22.320 --> 14:28.480]  things and they say it's all coming theaters are about to be hit magically they are by the way
[14:28.480 --> 14:35.440]  the suspected aurora shooter james holmes gets 24 murder charges now they won't show video of it
[14:35.440 --> 14:47.280]  but the court sketcher says that he he is completely unable to talk and looks completely confused
[14:47.280 --> 14:52.240]  like he doesn't know where he is yeah and you can't you can't copy this folks they can commit mass
[14:52.240 --> 14:57.200]  shootings and just drug somebody up and roll in their patsy and of course you never hear
[14:57.200 --> 15:03.280]  any discussion of the top pentagon psychiatrist that was over him oh yeah he was assigned to the
[15:04.000 --> 15:10.000]  the former head of the air force psychiatric program in san antonio
[15:10.000 --> 15:16.880]  san antonio is a very special place down there that's one of the places they kill us trips army
[15:17.920 --> 15:25.280]  air force that's where they uh nerve gas them and uh i even had rick rick perry's uh
[15:26.480 --> 15:32.560]  what was he press secretary one time came down to the uh six years ago came down to the end game
[15:33.200 --> 15:36.960]  i recognized the guy i'd seen him on television he said oh yeah he's 10 years ago i was a medic
[15:36.960 --> 15:42.320]  down at fort sam houston yeah we'd bring in trips give shots they'd all die uh special forces i was
[15:42.320 --> 15:51.280]  like oh that's very nice and and he wanted me to know that rick perry was a good guy and liked the
[15:51.280 --> 15:58.880]  show i i didn't know what that message was but um again i mean i just sit here marveling at the
[15:58.880 --> 16:02.480]  new world order have i even given the number out because i noticed the phone lines are loaded
[16:02.480 --> 16:14.800]  whatever i'll give the number out 800-25-99231 800-25-99231 at a certain point everything is
[16:14.800 --> 16:23.200]  just window dressing i mean i've got articles here that are sensational
[16:23.200 --> 16:34.160]  i mean look at this article they're arresting people in england now if they insult someone
[16:34.160 --> 16:40.160]  on twitter there's no free speech but look at this doj suggests criticism of islam
[16:40.160 --> 16:47.360]  could be criminalized and there's a video of this in congressional testimony and yeah this is the plan
[16:47.360 --> 16:57.280]  refuses to rule out sharia style law in the united states and Watson lives now in london
[16:57.280 --> 17:05.840]  his brothers lived there for a long time but uh they actually have sharia law now in in many
[17:05.840 --> 17:10.800]  parts of england i did and the government encourages it and again my point is the government's
[17:10.800 --> 17:16.480]  running al-qaeda in libya and syria and all these places but i'm supposed to give my rights up as
[17:16.480 --> 17:20.640]  al-qaeda is about to attack me but they've already flipped the script and said no no al-qaeda is the
[17:20.640 --> 17:25.680]  good guy it's the patriots they're gonna they're gonna attack everybody and it's and then and
[17:25.680 --> 17:29.920]  then you have these mass shooters who are always under psychiatric care are big democrats
[17:31.200 --> 17:34.160]  and then no one knows where they've been for months and then they
[17:39.520 --> 17:41.040]  supposedly come in a mass shooting
[17:41.040 --> 17:50.000]  but this article is up at info wars dot com right now we're going to be going over it
[17:54.720 --> 18:00.000]  doj suggests criticism of islam could be criminalized but when you look at something
[18:00.000 --> 18:05.120]  like this how do you even break down how political correctness works it's not even political correctness
[18:05.120 --> 18:15.600]  it's tyranny under the name of a nanny state oh look at this i'm a hollywood reporter nielson
[18:15.600 --> 18:24.080]  sued for billions over allegedly manipulating tv ratings really you think so you think so you
[18:24.080 --> 18:31.520]  think they manipulate the ratings folks the entire television system is a paper tiger fraud they have
[18:31.520 --> 18:37.840]  a fraction of the viewers that people think they do i've been all over national television
[18:38.400 --> 18:44.240]  i've been all you basically you name and i've been on it if it's a news program or a talk program
[18:44.240 --> 18:52.480]  or whatever i've been on nightline the view cnn probably 15 times fox news on and on and on
[18:52.480 --> 18:59.120]  you name and i've been on it no response to speak of i mean the view i had a lot of women
[18:59.120 --> 19:03.520]  say they saw me on this that's actually a pretty big show but these other shows no response
[19:03.520 --> 19:10.160]  almost no response you go on some big city market radio show we're gonna actually talk to somebody
[19:10.160 --> 19:14.160]  for 30 minutes and talk to a few hundred thousand you get a big response you see traffic to your
[19:14.160 --> 19:21.440]  website you see books video sold you see stories get out there this is all a big fraud the whole
[19:21.440 --> 19:26.480]  things of facade the whole things are fraud the whole thing's a scam it's a bunch of posers sitting
[19:26.480 --> 19:38.560]  up there trying to dictate to you the nature of reality so there's that i mean does anybody even
[19:38.560 --> 19:42.800]  care that there are literally hundreds i say hundreds really thousands of mainline studies
[19:42.800 --> 19:46.960]  that fluoride eats your brain and that they put it in there to hurt you i mean again we have a
[19:46.960 --> 19:53.600]  government of people that on record kill our troops little kids you name it in secret tests
[19:53.600 --> 20:02.320]  that are public now and that put stuff in the water to brain damages okay are you storing food
[20:02.320 --> 20:07.840]  prepared families are storing food for months and years but only having a fuel stored for days or
[20:07.840 --> 20:14.080]  weeks stretch your fuel storage by harnessing the power of the sun with the sun oven food can be baked
[20:14.080 --> 20:20.000]  boiled or steamed at temperatures of 360 to 400 degrees with the power of the sun you can use

[33:36.720 --> 33:42.240]  rights and liberties during the wartime progress and are continuing their psych warfare attacks
[33:42.240 --> 33:46.480]  on the family and everything decent through the television set that they assault people's
[33:46.480 --> 33:52.480]  psyche with on a daily basis the globalist are losing control even as they expand and

[34:15.440 --> 34:23.840]  subject of well we're busy talking about obama romney labor tori you know whatever the case is in
[34:23.840 --> 34:29.760]  your country while we're busy fighting over this you notice it's global standardization a global
[34:29.760 --> 34:34.960]  corporate monopoly takeover and it's not just like this corporations want to run our lives
[34:35.520 --> 34:41.120]  they want to set up a total planetary system to cut off resources that is the stated goal
[34:41.120 --> 34:49.440]  that is the stated plan they do not like wealth they do not like you doing well poverty is the game
[34:52.640 --> 34:54.240]  now again
[34:57.920 --> 35:02.240]  there's one final point i want to make but i will um i will make it after i go to some of
[35:02.240 --> 35:11.200]  the phone calls here i have asked the listeners you know generally to just i mean i want your take on
[35:12.080 --> 35:19.040]  the magnitude of all this because we don't have any hope of ever defeating the globalist if we can't
[35:19.760 --> 35:27.040]  really pull back and really analyze the full depth and breadth of what we're up against
[35:27.040 --> 35:33.200]  every time i hear mainline neocons go these dumb liberals they're not dumb
[35:36.320 --> 35:42.560]  they are taking point in the change of society to bring us into domestication and enslavement
[35:42.560 --> 35:49.520]  and the republicans play the part of the opposition so that they can control the opposition
[35:51.360 --> 35:54.720]  and anytime we're about to fully flip them we're very close to beating them
[35:54.720 --> 36:01.280]  if people can just wake up to how really bad they are and really get disgusted and really have some good
[36:01.280 --> 36:08.640]  old-fashioned not even hate but just understanding that this is the enemy it's beyond hate i don't
[36:08.640 --> 36:11.520]  even hate the new old order anymore except when i start thinking about all the stuff they do to
[36:11.520 --> 36:16.800]  kids it makes me really angry but it's not even really hate it's just like animal understanding
[36:16.800 --> 36:24.160]  of this enemy's got to be run into the ground it's beyond hatred it's just i'm ready in the info or
[36:24.160 --> 36:30.160]  to do what needs to be done you know what i'm talking about there's not a question there's not it's
[36:30.160 --> 36:42.160]  beyond hate it's survival it's wholesomeness to want to destroy these people to want to crush them
[36:44.320 --> 36:47.120]  it's not enough to run the globalists of the hills ladies and gentlemen
[36:47.120 --> 37:00.320]  they have got to be absolutely identified exposed arrested tried
[37:03.360 --> 37:04.320]  and destroyed
[37:04.320 --> 37:17.600]  them because they want to destroy us look at what look at their fruits they attack everything good
[37:19.360 --> 37:27.200]  they hate with a venomous stench everything wholesome you see something good you like it
[37:27.200 --> 37:34.720]  i see something good i like it our hearts are good but they're also desperately wicked but
[37:34.720 --> 37:40.320]  we choose goodness the globalists have chosen wickedness and they like it they see it and they
[37:40.320 --> 37:51.440]  think it's good we see it and it stinks evil is exciting to them and notice the system this is
[37:51.440 --> 37:58.240]  the most important thing i've probably ever told you please listen the system is always no no no
[37:58.240 --> 38:05.360]  settle down lower the rhetoric lower the rhetoric don't get upset be quiet be reasonable compromise
[38:05.360 --> 38:09.920]  but notice they never compromise notice their rhetoric is in our face they're trying to scare us
[38:09.920 --> 38:14.000]  they're trying to terrorize us they're trying to do extreme things to us they're always trying to
[38:14.000 --> 38:20.240]  push the envelope because they know what they're doing and they are committed you're not going
[38:20.240 --> 38:26.000]  to negotiate with them any of that and so when we when i get up here and describe the fact that
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.120]  they put cancer viruses and over 200 million americans vaccines just with polio alone and
[38:31.120 --> 38:37.440]  i've got videos of the inventors bragging that they gave us cancer and laughing in a pbs television
[38:37.440 --> 38:42.160]  show produced in boston the inventors of it admitting that well they're too many people we
[38:42.160 --> 38:47.040]  yeah yeah yeah we killed people i mean i've played that clip probably 40 times over the years
[38:47.040 --> 38:52.320]  they think you're so dumb they get on the news nationwide and tell you mercury is good for
[38:52.320 --> 38:58.800]  your child's brain they know since the 20s that fluoride causes retardation
[39:00.640 --> 39:05.520]  and adjuvants accelerates all the other chemicals just as the big harvard study just showed
[39:06.240 --> 39:12.000]  that they're calling breakthrough you think they're just hitting you with fluoride
[39:12.000 --> 39:19.920]  they are gauging how to kill us and how to dumb us down we can't get mad at the public unable to
[39:19.920 --> 39:26.560]  wake up and get angry a lot of them are too far gone folks these are walking casualties people
[39:26.560 --> 39:31.280]  always say aren't you worried about getting killed folks there is no future if we don't beat these
[39:31.280 --> 39:36.880]  people no i go get in my bed at night and i go to sleep i'm not worried about myself my wife my
[39:36.880 --> 39:41.760]  kids even though i love my kids more than life itself because they don't have a future if we
[39:41.760 --> 39:48.640]  don't beat these people it's kind of like that okay the ship is in freezing water it's got a time
[39:48.640 --> 39:53.120]  bomb in the bottom it's going to blow the ship's going to break into we're all going to die if i
[39:53.120 --> 39:59.040]  don't get in there and disarm that my kids are up on the deck there's a bunch of globalist zombies
[39:59.040 --> 40:04.320]  up there they're trying to stop us you know what you know what they've got to be thrown to the wind
[40:05.920 --> 40:10.480]  i'm being really honest with you here ladies and gentlemen everything's got to be thrown to the
[40:10.480 --> 40:17.440]  wind because that's the only way you save us you understand that all this plotting and oh what's
[40:17.440 --> 40:21.920]  the neighbor going to think and caring about peer pressure i cannot believe people that are into
[40:21.920 --> 40:27.920]  peer pressure i mean that's so far back for me so so ridiculous when some stupid dumb
[40:27.920 --> 40:34.960]  down zombie laughs at you it's it's it's a medical issue of a poor mentally ill you're
[40:34.960 --> 40:42.400]  artificially induced a mentally defunct person it doesn't pierce me when i get ridiculed or
[40:42.400 --> 40:48.400]  made fun of because this is a victim this is like a homeless person who's got schizophrenia
[40:48.400 --> 40:55.360]  from chemicals standing on the street corner gibbering at people and then pointing at you and
[40:55.360 --> 41:00.240]  laughing at you does that upset you no well it doesn't upset me they're making fun of me it
[41:00.240 --> 41:15.040]  upsets me that they're so mind-fried you understand that so i said i'd go to your calls here's the
[41:15.040 --> 41:22.000]  point i here it is crystallized when we are faced with absolute out of control megalomania
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.800]  craziness which is actually a repeat of every other society always tried to exterminate the
[41:26.800 --> 41:31.040]  group they've been at war with for a long time the globalists want total victory total victory
[41:31.040 --> 41:36.800]  means killing us then they have all the advanced technology life extension all the movies i go out
[41:36.800 --> 41:40.960]  and see now are about this i went and saw spider-man with my wife i thought it was a really good movie
[41:42.480 --> 41:48.320]  compared to batman and had a good message of anti transhuman genetic engineering and the mad
[41:48.320 --> 41:51.440]  scientist who wants to live forever and is injecting himself with it
[41:51.440 --> 41:58.320]  and i know a lot of people in hollywood that they're not all bad a lot of them are actually
[41:58.320 --> 42:04.480]  waking up and that's threatening the power structure but my point is is that this is the
[42:04.480 --> 42:18.800]  real issue the whole destiny of humanity is being decided right now okay and we have to
[42:18.800 --> 42:25.040]  escalate our rhetoric because no amount of rhetoric is enough in the face of this evil
[42:25.040 --> 42:31.440]  this evil is so deep so big so large so complex if you can think about it you go look it up
[42:31.440 --> 42:38.240]  they're doing it and stuff you can't imagine they're doing it inventing new sins inventing new evil
[42:38.240 --> 42:46.160]  inventing playing god wrecking things screwing things up up it might as well be an intergalactic
[42:46.160 --> 42:51.040]  group of invisible aliens that landed here and are trying to destroy our civilization by manipulating
[42:51.040 --> 42:58.320]  people basically you know what the bible says demons whatever but but all of that aside there
[42:58.320 --> 43:03.360]  are people that want to screw everything up there are people who like to dominate innocence there
[43:03.360 --> 43:09.200]  are people that are bad and they're being forged into a battering ram to smash our civilization
[43:09.200 --> 43:14.080]  and i'm not going to sit here and put up with it people that think it's the safe
[43:14.080 --> 43:20.720]  path to go along with this are fools so here's the little secret that everybody knows
[43:20.720 --> 43:25.920]  isn't it funny the secret because it's not being used people ask i was on max kaiser one of his
[43:25.920 --> 43:32.320]  international tv shows was at rt or press tv i was on it this morning and he asked why are you
[43:32.320 --> 43:37.520]  undoubtedly the most successful alternative media heads and shoulders above the rest globally
[43:37.520 --> 43:49.600]  why are you number one and i basically said because i will tell people just how bad it is
[43:54.000 --> 44:01.040]  i mean it's really simple i will talk about what's really important because you can debate stuff
[44:01.040 --> 44:05.040]  all day long i mean i go back to this every 10 minutes now we're gonna if we're gonna do whole
[44:05.040 --> 44:09.680]  shows on this again we've done them before but i'm gonna get a compendium together do a whole
[44:09.680 --> 44:16.720]  special report of government secret experimentation on the populations killing little kids killing
[44:16.720 --> 44:23.680]  women killing children killing trips you know folks they know d use a death sentence to all the
[44:23.680 --> 44:28.320]  troops that use it but they know they're macho and young and they tell them it's going to be fine
[44:28.320 --> 44:35.440]  you know they'll serve their two or three tours and go home and have kidney failure
[44:35.440 --> 44:39.680]  and when you realize that the elite even write books about how we're dumb animals
[44:39.680 --> 44:45.520]  and we deserve what's happening to us i take real offense at that because i've studied the elite
[44:45.520 --> 44:52.400]  and they're not elite there's nothing elite about cheating outside the laws of humanity to be in
[44:52.400 --> 45:00.240]  control and you know my analogy of cancer cancer is not in control it if cancer could have a
[45:00.240 --> 45:04.640]  consciousness it would think that it was really cool and it was racing through the body and nothing
[45:04.640 --> 45:12.000]  could stop it no you're going to kill the body and so my children my wife live within the body
[45:12.000 --> 45:19.680]  politic of terra firma on this planet and see the body is going to die if we don't cut the cancer out
[45:19.680 --> 45:24.880]  so everybody's running trying to save their family individually save their own little corner
[45:24.880 --> 45:30.160]  of the world that isn't going to happen ladies and gentlemen until we address the big cancer
[45:30.720 --> 45:37.360]  it's got to be met it's got to be dealt with it's got to be committed against you have to
[45:37.360 --> 45:42.320]  commit against it and to do that you've got to really see it and let me tell you there's the old
[45:42.320 --> 45:48.000]  saying that the teacher appears when the student is ready ladies and gentlemen i don't have to sit
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.680]  here and tell you all the stuff that's going on it's happening everywhere in your face now
[45:52.240 --> 45:56.640]  world government's out in the open run by the exact group we told you was building it
[45:58.400 --> 46:02.800]  they're militarizing they're announcing martial law troops on the streets they're not calling it
[46:02.800 --> 46:08.240]  martial law but we're going into it and people are sending me comments and emails going well
[46:08.240 --> 46:14.000]  Alex it's the collapse of yeah but they collapsed it to then sell this yes i yes i know it's for
[46:14.000 --> 46:20.560]  the collapse yes i i understand that i understood that 15 years ago i really started waking up 15
[46:20.560 --> 46:26.000]  years ago i thought i knew a lot i didn't know anything and now every month i learned more
[46:26.000 --> 46:32.000]  than i knew in in the decade before let me tell you that's what's wild is that my knowledge of this
[46:32.000 --> 46:39.120]  is now compounding and accelerating to a point where i can't even handle it okay i mean i know
[46:39.120 --> 46:42.880]  what they're gonna do before they do it i know what their battle plans are i know what they're
[46:42.880 --> 46:49.280]  thinking because i have spent so much time following what they do and i've studied what they're into
[46:49.280 --> 46:54.480]  and let me just tell you something these people might as well be demons out of hell i'll tell you
[46:54.480 --> 46:59.040]  right now all you atheists don't believe in heaven and hell even though every ancient culture said
[46:59.040 --> 47:04.560]  there's these really bad things these good things let me tell you something folks it might as well be
[47:04.560 --> 47:11.760]  because it's like creatures out of hell razor have taken over or something that's exactly the
[47:11.760 --> 47:18.720]  kind of stuff they're into all that art is imitating life it's like final fantasy it's like
[47:22.400 --> 47:29.120]  event horizon you're like what is the met what do they want what what is the new order one well
[47:29.120 --> 47:34.640]  they want to murder people i mean what am i supposed to people like well why do they have 35 bodies
[47:34.640 --> 47:40.400]  in this basement because that's which is this crazy person likes it to a psychopath rotten
[47:40.400 --> 47:45.280]  bodies is like pumpkin pie to a normal person we're like oh man that's really horrible not to them
[47:49.600 --> 47:54.240]  you ever been out on a ranch or something and pull up next to a dead cow it's been dead four or five
[47:54.240 --> 48:02.800]  days and a possum comes right out of it's right out of a hole in it this is happy as you could be
[48:02.800 --> 48:09.440]  see that look on its face that's David Rockefeller
[48:11.840 --> 48:16.160]  and you ever seen a possum come out of the hind end of a rotten cow you've seen David Rockefeller's
[48:16.160 --> 48:22.480]  spirit and you're like well i would never want to climb inside a dead cow exactly you're not a new
[48:22.480 --> 48:27.040]  world order person you're not an elitist you just want to be a good decent person and that's why
[48:27.040 --> 48:31.120]  you're wide open to their attacks i'm going to shut up anonymous and we're going to go to uh
[48:31.120 --> 48:38.320]  uh james robert jacob and max anonymous uh you're on the air from texas go ahead thank you for
[48:38.320 --> 48:43.520]  taking my call alex it's an honor to speak with you my friends and family and people i hold dear
[48:43.520 --> 48:48.080]  think of you as a modern day paul revere well sir i'm just trying to survive thank you what's on
[48:48.080 --> 48:53.360]  your mind well i had a two-part question but before i asked that question i wanted to lead
[48:53.360 --> 48:58.480]  up to it for the uh american people who listen to your show they'll understand why i'm so mad
[48:58.480 --> 49:05.360]  and why i have to ask this question uh right now with these global scum are poisoning our air with
[49:05.360 --> 49:10.560]  aluminum oxide they're poisoning our food by monsanto they're fluoride and poisoning our water
[49:10.560 --> 49:15.920]  they're imploding our economy and selling our children's souls to debt for the future our
[49:15.920 --> 49:20.160]  children are being raped and murdered by the likes of the bohemian grove and our ability to
[49:20.160 --> 49:25.280]  protect ourselves is now being taken away and now we face a future under martial law
[49:25.280 --> 49:31.280]  and the likes of agenda 21 so my question to you alex is do the american people through the
[49:31.280 --> 49:37.280]  second amendment does it still enable us to the american people to organize a militia system
[49:37.280 --> 49:44.000]  yes the right to revolt is in the bill of rights constitution and the state constitutions
[49:46.160 --> 49:52.160]  voice you reach so many people i don't understand why you don't call us to arms you are the
[49:52.160 --> 49:58.320]  proverbial head of the well that on me yeah yeah let me just explain something the nsa's got kill
[49:58.320 --> 50:05.360]  switches all throughout the infrastructure the minute i started doing that they would get a kill
[50:05.360 --> 50:12.080]  switch but now that i think about it they wouldn't even do that they probably want that so that they
[50:12.080 --> 50:18.000]  could get the civil war going sir they want to shut the web down and shut people up because they're
[50:18.000 --> 50:25.280]  a tiny globalist minority of crooks manipulating us through false stories everyone before we talk
[50:25.280 --> 50:30.800]  about being called out to start shooting people should be shooting people with info weapons of
[50:30.800 --> 50:38.080]  truth okay the minute we went out and started blasting idiot government people would be the

[54:17.120 --> 54:26.640]  and if i thought violence was the answer i would certainly discuss it but that is not the answer
[54:26.640 --> 54:36.000]  offensive violence is never the answer okay that's just the way it works and the system is a massing
[54:36.000 --> 54:42.880]  force against us they are attacking us more and more and that's waking people up and so it's the
[54:42.880 --> 54:47.280]  old saying you've got to know when to hold them know when to fold them know when to walk away
[54:47.280 --> 54:54.960]  know when to run everybody just buys more guns and digs in and says we're ready to kill somebody
[54:54.960 --> 55:00.320]  that comes take the guns you should be using your first amendment at this county level the
[55:00.320 --> 55:06.240]  city level the legislature you should be doing banner hangs i see people all over awesome my
[55:06.240 --> 55:11.760]  wife sees it every week different people with info wars.com signs with signs saying tune in the
[55:11.760 --> 55:19.040]  local radio stations that's happening all over the country uh dave mustane has been in manila
[55:19.680 --> 55:24.000]  philippines and now china and he says in all those countries people come up and say alex
[55:24.000 --> 55:29.520]  jones info wars.com i was talking to max keiser today before he taped his tv show that they're
[55:29.520 --> 55:36.000]  gonna air friday and he was saying uh yeah you're you're huge over here in europe and and i know that
[55:36.800 --> 55:41.600]  but again it isn't about alex jones is huge let me tell you that's just a danger issue for my physical
[55:41.600 --> 55:47.680]  body and it's a responsibility but but let me just give americans the little message we are
[55:47.680 --> 55:55.040]  absolutely destroying the globalist right now in the info war that's why they want to start a big war
[55:55.040 --> 56:01.840]  get everybody distracted and they want to stage some false flag events so they can grandstand
[56:01.840 --> 56:06.400]  but they did that thing out in aurora and yeah it's stage folks there's no doubt now it's ridiculous
[56:06.400 --> 56:11.760]  how much evidence and poll numbers went up for guns so they're really freaking out right now
[56:11.760 --> 56:18.800]  again people say well what's the call to arms what do you do march on dc they've got alternate
[56:18.800 --> 56:28.480]  governments all over the place then you get something even worse the answer is not having
[56:28.480 --> 56:34.240]  some war offensively if they start trying to confiscate guns 1776 will start and let me just
[56:34.240 --> 56:39.760]  go further here they want that the globalists have gauged the public and i think they've gauged
[56:39.760 --> 56:45.280]  incorrectly and they think these are guys that make 40 to one bets on the stock market the globalists
[56:45.280 --> 56:52.400]  are crazy they think that you are going to just turn them all in and they don't care if two or
[56:52.400 --> 56:56.560]  three percent doesn't turn them in and shoots up police and military that will start the real police
[56:56.560 --> 57:02.480]  state see because they see the cops and the military in the same boat as us see that's what's so
[57:02.480 --> 57:06.960]  stupid people sit there and talk about going out and having a war with the police the military
[57:06.960 --> 57:12.800]  if you read again globalist documents that have been leaked they hate the military the veterans
[57:12.800 --> 57:19.200]  they hate police officers folks they hate anybody that knows how to use a gun anybody that's
[57:19.200 --> 57:24.240]  living the real world they want to make us all a bunch of jellyfish nanny state people they do not like
[57:26.880 --> 57:31.280]  oh my gosh this you know i said i'd get a bunch of calls in this one caller i could talk for two
[57:31.280 --> 57:37.840]  hours with about this issue i constantly see people anonymously saying it's time to start killing
[57:37.840 --> 57:42.720]  and a lot of them are feds you know listening to your voice i this guy probably isn't but if you

[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:37.360]  anybody tries to take you to a FEMA camp for political reasons anybody tries to
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.760]  you know take your family to a reeducation center you don't just have a right you have a duty to
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:49.360]  defend yourself uh but we need to absolutely do everything we can in the information war the
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:55.520]  first amendment that's a lot more than the sword if you'll use it that's why big corrupt governments
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:01.200]  want to go right to violence because they don't want to face us you know i'm not one of these
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:07.600]  pacifist people all the way like gondy or martin wither king or jesus christ our lord and savior
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:16.480]  but i go all the way with that until they're trying to load people on trucks to take them to
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:22.400]  some reeducation dungeon but it's not with pleasure that i talk about things like that
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:28.240]  you know a lot of these people who i hear talk about violence they're talking about what they're
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:33.120]  going to do with their house if you know if the system comes i mean if you ever get to that point
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:37.120]  you don't wait at your house you go out and find people let me just tell you something
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:40.800]  all of you out there talking about what you're going to do why do you always talk about at your
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:45.360]  house folks that's a death trap i mean i don't want to get into resistance here but i mean you
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:50.880]  better learn a little bit about it before you start talking about it and then are you really
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:56.800]  going to be sitting there down some side street and wait till cops are changing shift
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:02.240]  and open up from a disclosed location i mean from a secret location a hidden location
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:06.320]  with a high powered rifle and shoot a bunch of them you really going to do that i mean you're
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:10.240]  really going to do that because everybody that wants a revolution and let's go kill some people
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:15.760]  that's what they talk about and you know what will happen if that starts the police are all
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:21.360]  going to pull back they're all going to pull back to armored keeps and the powers is going to be shut
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:26.880]  off that's the system's plan and then everything's going to start disintegrating and then they're
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:32.880]  going to plan to have everybody roll out after that and bring in military you name it and it is
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:36.880]  not a pretty picture let me tell you the answer the answer is identify the globalists the real
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:41.920]  enemies the crimes they've committed the big bankers openly dealing drugs running the aircraft
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:48.000]  running all the other stuff identify who's doing all this and watch their agenda unfold and just
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:57.840]  sit back and just take it that's going to beat these people and don't worry those of you that
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.360]  want to shooting war the globalists are going to start it way before then they're not going to let
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:09.840]  us win so easily they're not going to let us win so easily we've got to take the punishment in front
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:16.160]  of everybody we've got to let them burn down the alamo burn down waco that's what it's all about
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:20.400]  ladies and gentlemen some of us have got to stand there and let them kill us if they want to
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:26.320]  more i think about it i'd probably just you know i don't i love life so much i'm willing for them
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:31.280]  to kill me i would never commit suicide but i'm not worried about being struck down it's what
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:37.440]  it's all about don't you understand that ladies and gentlemen that's what's all about to be a man
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:43.360]  man it's about being willing to die for women and children that's what civilization is built on
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.400]  not being sent overseas because you think you're fighting for women and children
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:51.040]  but to really hear in your own country all right you got one minute as we go out to break
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:58.720]  the endless talk of violence is not the road to go in my view go ahead uh anonymous oh we just hung
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:06.240]  up i was going to go back to him you know that's another discussion that has to be had
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:12.800]  the globalists want to wall themselves off behind these national security infrastructures
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:18.320]  and then send out their drones and their police and their robots against us and that's the real
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:28.080]  danger but you do not hurt the new world order because in all these stage federal deals they
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:32.000]  go out and create a fake militia to demonize militias it's always they're going to target
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.640]  police the military that way they can go to police the military and say see these guys want to target
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:42.960]  you to create that new new enemy you know rebels versus you know the blue coats we don't let them
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:48.000]  frame the debate we don't let them frame the paradigm we don't let them we don't just jump into
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:55.600]  the uniforms they say we go out with the info which is violent the truth is violently powerful
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:02.800]  and we use it you have weapons in the info war this is alex jones with five good reasons you
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:07.840]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:12.800]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:18.080]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:23.200]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:28.640]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:33.920]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:38.480]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:42.960]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power

[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:17.360]  all right we are going to continue with your phone calls after tyrell ventura leaves us
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:23.840]  with robert james jacob max john and others tyrell ventura has been in quite a few films
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:29.840]  uh on his own right he's produced television shows he's done camera work producing and also
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:36.640]  starring in the third edition of jesse ventura's conspiracy theory with shon stone now you know
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:40.880]  they killed one episode the homeland security episode last year a lot of other stuff happened
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:45.360]  i'm not at liberty to talk about you get told this stuff off record they don't whatever reasons
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:51.120]  they've been sworn to secrecy but it's like something out of a movie uh now i was part of
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:57.520]  shooting and just amazing interviews at rocket bases and just all sorts of craziness really
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:04.240]  powerful new season coming out jesse ventura when he was on a month ago says 50 50 whether it's
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:11.120]  ever gonna air i've talked to some of the folks involved tyrell ventura thinks it will come out
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.320]  but but generally there's a few months after it's done it should have been out in like january or
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:20.400]  february it hasn't come out so we'll ask him about that also the libor scandal but out of the gates
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:25.920]  here uh tyrell i just had a caller on earlier who was saying when do we start using our second
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:31.680]  amendment when do we start you know going after the government and sure the government sold us
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:37.120]  out it's it's legalizing illegal aliens it's uh it's it's it's giving trillions of foreign banks
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:43.760]  it's arming against us with 450 million rounds of ammo and all the rest of it and preparing for
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:51.440]  civil unrest but the issue is that in my experience he who shoots first loses the pen is mattering
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:55.760]  the sword that's why they want to curtail the internet right now that's why they banned that
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.880]  police state episode that i worked on with you that was so powerful that they're afraid of info
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:06.880]  tyrell ventura what do you say to that i agree completely uh you know the the truth will always
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:13.680]  the truth is stronger than violence you know it you can you know like you said firing the first
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:17.840]  shot or being violent in any way towards the guard that's not going to solve the problem
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:22.800]  you know they they you know they will they want us you know they for us people out here who are you
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:27.360]  know searching to get the truth out into the public sphere and get people awake to the to what's
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:31.920]  really going on in the world you know we start shooting up places or blowing up buildings and
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:36.480]  things like that you know that that takes away any credibility to anything that we're doing
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:42.160]  because violence does not solve problems you know violence is an easy out you know that's the easy
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:47.840]  thing to do and you know what it doesn't work you know you know defending yourself is one thing but
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:54.160]  but the outright violence is ludicrous it's it's insane it's stupid it doesn't solve the problem
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:58.880]  you know it does not solve the problem and it doesn't garner sympathy you know you what you
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:02.560]  want is you want people on your side you don't want people scared of you well that's why the
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:07.360]  globalist staged oklahoma city that's why they staged this aurora thing it's got all the telltale
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:13.360]  signs over the top they want to have the moral authority they don't have it they've got a 9%
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:18.320]  approval rating i mean i even saw the cover of time magazine where they said how guns won
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:22.720]  why americans have turned against gun control because we understand that criminals are going
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:28.320]  to have guns regardless we need them to protect ourselves tyrell i want to continue along that
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:35.200]  line looking at the television show give us the latest on that well basically what the television
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:39.360]  shows where we're finishing up the editing process they got you know we got a little
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:44.240]  slowed up earlier this year which caused uh you know caused a delay in the editing and
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:48.560]  the close production of the work that we're doing uh but you know it's it's moving along and then
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:54.560]  you know i think the show will be on uh this year i've received no word that it isn't uh you know
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:59.600]  and then you know the delays are just production delays i you know there's nothing you know scary
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:04.080]  or macavelian going on or anything you know kind of behind the scenes it's not that it's just kind
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:08.640]  of standard things that happen that you don't want to happen in production but they do uh and
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:13.760]  so just got slowed up you know and uh sure i understand you're sure i understand you're
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:18.400]  putting a good face on it but i mean i mean i hope it airs because i'm in it and it's important
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:22.880]  and i mean i want to see all these episodes that i'm not in i want to know great topics this year
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:28.240]  you know we got some really great topics and then things like that it's just you know the magic of
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:32.640]  of the making television or in production is that anything can and will happen and then sometimes
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:38.080]  we do get slowed up and then things of that nature i uh i have a strong feeling it'll be on this year
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:43.520]  you know um at the end of the day you know we're we're still spending money on making the show so
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:46.800]  as long as we're still spending money on making the show the chances that it'll be on the air
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:54.960]  that much higher well i tend to i mean i tend to agree with you because if i mean let's just tell
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:58.320]  folks what happened it's not a secret jesse talked about it your father's talked about it governor
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:05.200]  ventura it was shot and done and they got a new person over the company and they said okay we
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:11.920]  want it all redone and now that's been going on for six months and now sure they wouldn't be doing
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:17.200]  that if they weren't going to release it my concern is what direction have they taken it in now that
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:23.280]  they changed it all the direction that that has been taken in is nothing nothing that radically
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:28.560]  different from what it was before what what what happens in production is is that you know you you
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.960]  you know you have a group of my you know we we get together and say okay here's the shows that
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:37.360]  we're going to do we we go you know with the network and all that and then and then we go through
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:42.000]  jesse and we decide what the shows are we set out to do those shows with our liaison from the
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.880]  network and things like that which is a normal part of any television production um certain
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:51.600]  things happen but you know basically that you know beyond our control people move on take
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:56.640]  different jobs so we got a reassigned another liaison but that person came in very late in the
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:02.480]  game and that person has their views of what you know how to kind of structure the the the
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:06.800]  storylines of the show you know not in the sense of like restructuring the facts of the show or
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:11.840]  anything like that but just you know what interview goes where and what place that kind of thing
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:18.160]  um and so in redoing that because we'd already shot everything uh we had to kind of restructural
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:22.480]  that and when you do that at any time it just takes more time and energy and editing takes a
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:26.880]  long time anybody who's been in production knows this but when you're editing something if you
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:31.200]  have one script and then you know that sequence of events gets changed or altered you got to go
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:36.800]  back in and recod and retool and do all that and you know we have eight shows so it's a lot of a
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:41.680]  lot of work you know and it's a lot of editors working long hours and things like that and
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:47.120]  you know these things happen um you know like i said i in my time with it i've never once felt any
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:53.040]  kind of you know it was never about any kind of censorship or oh these shows are too hot to handle
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:59.360]  or anything like that it was purely just you know restructuring on on on on organizational levels
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:04.160]  and then in production you know just these changes happen and then you're kind of waiting like well
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:07.360]  you know what's going to happen next we need you know when we get the new set of notes in
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.600]  and you know that kind of thing but it's uh you know but it's plugging along and we're finishing
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:16.960]  up and then uh you know hopefully i would i would hope that at some point this fall uh show beyond
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:22.160]  i don't know exact dates no i tend to think you're right sure i tend to think you're right i mean
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:26.480]  obviously if they're just re-editing it and wanted to go in another direction that does take a lot of
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.400]  time show they haven't killed it normally they would just say that's it we're doing nothing
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:35.680]  with it so very exciting uh really they want to if they you know after all this time if they truly
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.360]  wanted this show to be over they could have pulled the plug at any time but i don't think they do
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.200]  either you know i've always gotten the sense that they're happy with the show in general
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:46.960]  and uh you know things like that and then and we're you know and we're happy the shows are going to
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:50.960]  be wild and woolly and then you know we're going to hit some topics i don't think anybody
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:55.920]  ever would predict jessie going into which was a lot of fun this year and then hitting some stuff
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.240]  that uh but you know is a little bit different from previous seasons but uh should be rather
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:06.640]  entertaining yeah like your dad and uh david icke had a big meltdown oh yeah that's that's
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:11.680]  that's going to be a hell of an interesting show you know and um you know it's it's
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:16.400]  interesting seeing jesse uh you know go go up against someone like david icke or even against
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:20.560]  but just it's interesting to see jesse you know in a room with david you know they're both really
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:25.600]  amazing personality well i mean i can say that your dad was open minded about it because i know his
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:30.000]  view on things and i and i you know i've talked to both sides so i know kind of the comedy of
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.360]  errors that happened but uh it's going to be amazing i hope it gets on air uh let's shift
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:42.480]  really good good let's shift gears now uh into some of the other big subjects uh your dad and
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:47.680]  you did that incredible last season interviews with all these wall street people admitting the
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:54.560]  fraud now it's coming out that they're laundering money for drug dealers aircraft uh for al-qaeda
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:03.040]  all of it hss hsbc uh with al-qaeda uh all of this the libor scandal i mean that really
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:08.240]  vindicates everything we've been breaking down to me the libor scandal is is to me the biggest
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:14.560]  crime in modern history uh i think it's i think it affects more people than any assassination
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:19.120]  that we could look into and then possibly even you know maybe not on a casualty level but even
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:24.400]  nine eleven because if you really look at what it means is that libor for people that don't know
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:30.880]  is essentially the the 16 biggest world banks we're talking the financial elite the people
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:34.480]  that we talk about if you want to call them Illuminati whatever you want to call them
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:39.920]  that's where they come from they're the people those 16 world banks control the flow of money
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:44.400]  and essentially what they've been doing for the last we could say 10 maybe 20 years
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:50.160]  is essentially fixing the interest rates for their own purpose meaning that libor is a
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:54.320]  universally agreed upon interest rates these banks would loan money to each other with
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:58.560]  you know like basically hey if they speak to this bank if this world bank came to this other
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:03.120]  world bank and said we're gonna give you a loan this is pretty much what the interest rate would be
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.560]  that interest rate is used for every other subsidiary interest rate
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:13.680]  is if you go back and look at the credit card interest rates your your school loan interest
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:19.600]  rates pretty much any interest rate in the majority of the working world kind of bases
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:24.560]  its interest rates on libor that number and if they've been manipulating that number that means
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:30.000]  that every subsidiary every trickle down interest rate that uses that number to face itself on
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.600]  has been manipulated meaning that if you've been paying into a school loan all these years
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:40.560]  X amount of dollars on interest that interest rate wasn't true which means you've either been
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:44.960]  paying more than you should have been paying or less but regardless you've been paying to a
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:52.320]  fraudulent number that shakes the very foundation of capitalism as we know it to it's very core
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:59.920]  and that is huge and the amazing thing about it is that they had to in a settlement say that they
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:04.720]  manipulated this and show that they did in order to get through this settlement Ms. Barkley's
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:10.160]  settlement that essentially is court documented truth that there is a financial elite and that
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:13.440]  everything that you've been yelling about and I've been yelling about and everything that
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:19.600]  us conspiracy theorists have been talking about is true but there is a ruling class in the world
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:24.320]  that is controlling how the world works how they do that is by controlling the money and that
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:29.440]  trickles into the drug dealing like you were saying al-Qaeda governments they own most of our
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:33.120]  politicians they do all you know they so you're probably going to see a lot of slap on the wrist
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:37.600]  you're probably going to see some you know traders go to jail and oh look at we solved the problem
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:43.840]  but it doesn't solve the problem because the very essence of the system that we live by capitalism
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:51.200]  that the world lives by is rigged and if that system is rigged and you know there's no truth to
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:56.800]  any system at this deal there's no uh stability to any system that we stand on let's let's let's
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:01.440]  pick up where you left off there I couldn't say any better myself Tyrell Ventura the worst drought
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:07.280]  in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78%
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:12.720]  of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:18.080]  and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:22.960]  out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:28.160]  food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:32.640]  price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to get
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:37.200]  your supply I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all known this was

[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.400]  time to save money today and because it's storage for 25 years you're locking in today's prices and

[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:19.440]  when I'm stuck in bulls in prison and time keeps dragging on
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:33.280]  but that's raining keeps rolling all down the side of the tone when I was just a baby my mama told
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:42.480]  me son always be a good boy don't ever play with guns but I shot a man all right we have had Tyrell
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:46.880]  Ventura just popping in with us to give us an update on conspiracy theory the third season I
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:51.600]  hope he's right seems to make sense that if they're spending all this common money still producing
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:54.960]  the show that it's going to be even better and they're going to put it out I hope that's the
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:25:02.000]  case but you were really hitting the bone there and you had me thinking about yeah libor I mean
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:09.200]  it's all rigged everybody who's been hurt by this has been you know made to be a plaintiff
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:15.520]  and they're getting a slap on the wrist and every day there's new outrageous with the big
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:21.360]  megabanks engaged in everything you can imagine and now they're announcing I'm sure you saw the
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:26.320]  clip where they're announcing that megabanks have conquered the world and that world government
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:31.920]  is here but that we're lucky to have the megabanks run our life Tyrell oh no no it's it's you know
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.640]  that's that's the dog and pony show that's but oh no no you need us you need us in order to survive
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:42.400]  well no we don't no we don't we don't we need to restructure the system and from the ground up you
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:47.120]  guys have run the system into the dirt and now we need to restructure it because basically you've
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:52.240]  manipulated and then controlled every aspect of our life you know and and you know people always
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:56.320]  say you know when's world government coming when is the police state coming well it's already here
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.200]  you know you don't need to have chain you know you don't need to have razor wire on the corners
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.960]  of neighborhood of your neighborhood if they're controlling what you can can and can't do with
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:08.880]  your financial stability you know I mean if they're controlling all that then you don't need razor
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:15.120]  wire no very well said when you have a citizenry in constant debt from the moment that they try to
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:19.120]  get any kind of education and then they get out of college and they're completely you know debt
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:23.840]  written and that debt that they're paying interest to if that interest rate is completely fixed
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:28.240]  and they're going to be in debt the rest of their lives and that's an indentured servitude so people
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:32.720]  ask me well when's the police day coming well we're already here you know you did it kind of
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:37.600]  snuck up on us you know we you don't need jack booted bugs on every corner in order to live in
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:42.080]  a police state when you know all you need is control over the money and that's what they have
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:48.480]  and control over travel and checkpoints at key transportation zones and total surveillance and
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:54.960]  the IRS saying you can't leave the country if they say you owe taxes exactly exactly you know it's
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:00.240]  it's a fact you know to me what's also really fascinating about the live board thing is that
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:06.240]  you have the the 16 you know elites at the top of the food chain the top of the pyramid well now
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:11.840]  the under the underlings of them lost money on this too so now they're suing the upper upper
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:16.400]  cost they're they're suing their masters and now the masters are fighting back against them so
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:22.880]  essentially what you have is a very rare moment in time that the globalist elites are fighting each
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:28.800]  other and are all trying to steal it's like the sharks are eating themselves and so it's actually
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:34.400]  a very good time to get knowledge and truth out into the public sphere and to get people awake
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:38.000]  into this kind of thing because while they're busy fighting themselves we might actually be able to
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.640]  make some really good change wow sneak up on them and make the changes we need to make to make this
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:47.680]  world a better place tyrell the angles you take us in really are thought-provoking i'll just do
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:52.240]  this here on air as soon as you ever get good skypoked up i'd like to invite you sometime to
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:59.280]  uh to host the show anytime you'd like man i can i can i'll give it a shot why not

[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:08.800]  no i mean i've thought that off air before but that never made the point on air i'm glad you
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:14.240]  brought that up that that this system is even destroying its underlings and there is a lot
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:20.000]  of infighting within the power structure this thing is not monolithic we can beat it yes yes
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.760]  you know the power structure i mean there's always a turnover there's all i mean that's human nature
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:28.400]  every generation there's a new generation that comes in and takes over well right now you have
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:32.800]  a fight between the younger generation of elites and the older generation of elites the older are
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:36.480]  getting older they're trying to hold on to power the young generation is trying to come up that's
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:41.920]  the perfect opportunity for all of us who've been affected by them to sneak in and make our
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:46.240]  change make a great we've only we've only got one minute violently you don't need to do that
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:50.560]  violently you can beat them mentally you can beat them through art you can beat them through culture
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:55.360]  you can beat them through education demanding the right education i agree we only got about when

[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:58.240]  important question for you i was wondering when you're going to get uh pastor lindsay
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:02.000]  williams back on the show you know he's predicting the end of the dollar by the end of this year
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:07.200]  i was wondering if you got him lined up and how much uh faith that you're putting into his uh
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:13.600]  forward-looking statement i would say in the past about 98 percent of what he got from his sources
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:18.240]  was accurate we confirmed it builder bird now things are changing so much i mean i don't
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:23.760]  i don't think his source has has all the answers even though it's the former ceo of a major oil
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:30.080]  company things are so fluid but uh we we we've had a lot of folks want us to have lindsay on
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:35.600]  and some obviously uh don't uh but we do need to get lindsay williams out of the near future
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:44.960]  okay great i also like to say god bless 97-year-old david uh rockefeller god bless the possum huh

[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:58.800]  lined up to come on the show david rockefeller no no no lindsay i've actually talked to david
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:03.520]  rockefeller before yeah i know you did um that would be great to have him on the show wasn't it
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:09.120]  that was beyond beyond bizarre was beyond bizarre um but uh yeah i don't have time to get into the
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:14.000]  whole story but yes thank you for the call i appreciate those points uh my whole life's been
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:19.360]  bizarre but life is crazy lives and adventures people that say life's boring i don't know what
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:24.720]  planet you're living on uh let's talk to jacob at oklahoma and then james go ahead jacob
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:31.680]  yes sir i'm here in oklahoma um i just want to say one thing uh and including my other comment
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:38.960]  but to the guy the anonymous guy he needs to go read patrick henry's uh speech and realize how long
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.920]  our founding fathers which were ten times the men of these macho you know they've got a few
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:48.000]  guns so they think they're going to take on the government macho guys our founding fathers were
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:56.480]  ten times the men that they are and and me too and they how many years 10 15 years they pleaded
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:03.120]  with words uh to the to the king of england they didn't but people act like they just you know they
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:09.120]  were uh hotheaded and they were just ready to just fly off the handle and start a war and before they
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:14.800]  got violent because they were attacked they stopped paying the taxes they stopped putting up with stuff
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:21.360]  and they started hanging posters everywhere and they started when when when somebody was a bad
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:26.560]  soldier or cop they would take them and tar and feather and which was quite a quite a people died
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:31.120]  quite often when you did that to them because the skin would burn off but the point is is that
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:35.360]  they weren't they didn't just say let's just go attack the police station because we're going to
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:40.640]  have a civil war let's go take over the texas capital while they call in the army on us no
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:47.680]  they would go find the people that did something to somebody they would go find them and again
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:53.680]  again we have all i want is people shooting their mouths off about violence half the time
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:58.160]  are feds other half the time they're really angry and ready to do something if they just put that
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:05.600]  energy into waking other people up we have the moral authority we need to use it and again i have
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:12.480]  found most the military is awake more than the general public uh including officers most the
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:17.840]  police are more awake than the general public let me tell you our problem is going to be the general
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:23.200]  public if things collapse we're going to be asking for troops on the streets and again
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:29.120]  they engineered it that way but we don't just need to if they have troops on the streets go out and
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:35.920]  have a war with them we need to explain hey these troops were put in this position trained over the
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:40.960]  last decade for the banker collapse they've implemented we've got to get the truth out of
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:45.920]  what happened again so the the globalist aren't just going to have troops come take our guns
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:51.360]  they're going to collapse things first all hell's going to break loose when they come into restore
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:56.000]  order like katrina they're going to say you got to turn them in that's how they're going to do it
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.800]  there's not going to be communications in areas when they do this and it will be a death sentence
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:03.760]  for the military it's not going to be like new orleans where there were stills of people that
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:09.440]  got shot trying to take guns and you try that in texas or alabama or tennessee or or vermont
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:15.040]  but i mean i mean it's over i mean it's going to be but again we're not like macho wanting a
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:20.560]  bloodbath here we're wanting to overt this the globalists have this plan we've got to defeat
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:26.400]  them i appreciate your call we've got to outthink them we've got to have situational awareness
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:32.640]  of the real politic not not what we're being force-fed here by the corporate media listen
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:39.040]  they aren't going to go much longer but i mean listen with fixed neilson ratings and i knew they were
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:46.720]  fixed msnbc's top shows have a million listeners we have that many every hour or more conservatively
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:56.080]  concern i mean there it's made up it's it is fake the whole thing is fake one more caller
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:00.080]  because they've been holding so long then i'll get to max and noel and alison wonderland calling
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:06.800]  from ohio uh i thought that's in kansas uh let's go ahead and talk to james in missouri
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:11.680]  james you're on the air go ahead hey alex you're getting me on i'm the first time caller i appreciate
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:17.840]  you working in here uh you know i also comment on the anonymous caller uh you know first of all
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:21.040]  it is kind of sketchy i know without you said by his voice he didn't really sound like he'd be a
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:25.120]  fed or something but anyone who's calling him by anonymous is something to hide so you know whatever
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:31.360]  it is he was hiding i i think it's almost quite obvious but um you know we're not at that point
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:36.480]  yet you know we're not ready for that there's a reason that the first amendment came before the
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:42.000]  second amendment because our founding fathers knew the steps that will be needed to fight against
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.920]  this tyranny we have to exhaust every other step and then we have to have the courage to start
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:54.000]  identifying who the occupiers and collaborators are publicly and that's not a safe job again folks
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:01.840]  identify the globalist call them out call for their arrest there are good judges and and and and uh
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:08.960]  prosecutors and citizens and grand juries it's starting to happen we can arrest all these people
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:14.320]  go ahead oh yeah i mean i completely agree with you and i also just wanted to uh have a short
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:20.640]  little comment on uh what tyrell was talking about you know i i don't believe that our system capitalism
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:25.120]  is the is within itself evil and the source of our problems oh no no no tyrell's a huge
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:30.240]  capitalist and i almost elaborated when he said that he's saying this isn't capitalism this is a
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:35.600]  rigged monopoly system right yeah just because the only thing i was going to point out is because
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:40.400]  these megabankers they don't have one system that they conform to i mean they go through all the
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:44.720]  countries they go through all the systems and exploit every single one that's right they call it a
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:51.680]  synthesis yeah very well said anything else sir uh well you know i still don't know how much time
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:55.920]  you have for me but i do have a couple of stories i feel like would be uh relevant to what we've been
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:01.680]  talking about with the police state and also uh a story about a personal story about my uh
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:08.400]  about my experience through uh being diagnosed with add as i as a young kid going into high school
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:13.040]  and then being put on these add medications uh just a bunch of different types of ones and
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:18.320]  then how i got to college i got off of them and you know it was like it was like i it's like my
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:23.360]  my brain had cleared it was like it was like i could see clearly i mean it was just like it was it
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:31.200]  was it was it was it was like the fog of war had gone and i know why people do drugs not just kids
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:37.200]  they put them on it's because reality is such a high that you almost want to take some alcohol
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:43.440]  or whatever the case is so that it's not so intense you see reality is the ultimate trip
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:49.920]  to use a hippie term like you know lsd trip reality is the ultimate adventure god bless
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:55.520]  you i think you just told your story right there brother all right now joining us is one of my

[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:21.360]  and got a bunch and he's also one of the most successful uh proprietary developers uh of some
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:28.720]  of the most popular uh vitamin and mineral uh tinctures uh out there and i'm just really excited
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:33.920]  to have we also have a big announcement we're going to make at the start of the next hour we're
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:42.400]  not going to do that right now uh with uh dr cori gold again who joins us here today i wanted to
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:51.840]  get him on it first to discuss just the incredible stuff that we see coming out as you know doc it
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:59.920]  came out two weeks ago that merc knowingly was putting out uh vaccines that they knew actually
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:05.440]  had the measles mumps rubella in them uh it's come out the the glaxosmith client knew a bunch of
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:10.560]  their drugs didn't even help people and we're killing them uh now we have monsanto trying to
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:15.760]  get total government liability to approve anything they want and to give them liability protection
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:22.880]  and on the heels of all that major harvard study published in federal government journal
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:29.440]  confirms fluoride lowers IQ in more than a dozen studies that harvard looked at
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:37.120]  they found significant lower IQs in those who lived in the fluoride areas
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:43.280]  the children in high fluoride areas had significantly lower IQs than those who lived
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:48.080]  in low fluoride areas now again they just call it fluoride they put hundreds of chemicals in there
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:52.080]  this was known in the soviet union when they first put it by the way that's mainline history
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:45:01.600]  in the slave camp water then the nazis copied uh Stalin the point is folks this is premeditated
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:06.960]  evil and now they're getting caught on a weekly basis but still they go forward it's like they
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:10.480]  get caught so then they just say well we'll just get liability and by the way in california
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:14.640]  we're going to shoot your kids up with vaccines without parental consent that's where kory gold
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:21.280]  joins us from ksco land there in santa cruz uh doc uh what do you make of all this i mean used to
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:26.880]  you'd have like a piece of news break like this every six months now it's every day or two uh is
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:31.360]  this a good thing or are they just out in the open now what do you make of the fact that it's coming
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:35.680]  out that that you know big pharma makes tens of billions and with one drug a year and then
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:40.960]  pays a hundred million dollar fine uh what do you make of this well you covered a lot of ground
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:45.680]  there alex but you're right i mean it's been known for a long time that if you put things into the
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:52.080]  food supply you can control the public and uh you're right nazi germany they were using things
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:56.880]  like fluoride in the water to control people soviet russia they were using things like fluoride in
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:01.600]  the water to control people and you have to question why we're doing it here there's discussion
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:08.000]  out in the open right now about adding lithium to the public drinking supply because too many people
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:13.040]  in america are depressed and if we add a little lithium to the drinking water we would have happier
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:18.320]  population like you know stettford people so um yeah government is controlling people by
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:23.440]  what they put in the drinking water look at in chicago they're confiscating homemade lunches
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:28.640]  that mothers and fathers make and replacing it with government lunches because government is
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:34.000]  telling you parents don't have rights to control their children's diets government's in charge
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:39.440]  of your diets and to some degree you can't run away from the food supply so if they put gmo's
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:43.840]  in the food supply and fluoride in the water and lithium in the water where do you run where do you
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:52.320]  hide to control your own life and notice this is all happening right as we gain so much momentum
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:59.360]  their answer is oh yeah you don't like it we'll hit you with a hundred times more what we just think
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:05.280]  about this i mean they're now telling people if you collect rainwater that falls on your roof
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:12.480]  in your home it's illegal in some states to collect rainwater that falls on your own roof on your own
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:18.080]  home because the government owns the water that falls on your house oh yeah last year they wanted
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:24.640]  to tax uh two thousand dollars per episode for any hay dust in a barn as if that's toxic but
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:31.440]  then gmo can blow around everywhere in people's faces all of this is supposed you know fine and
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:38.720]  dandy but i was seeing the uh the uh department of the interior and others they're even discussing
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:47.280]  runoff taxes saying that you need to pay taxes just for rain that falls on your yard right there's
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:51.760]  they're looking to find any way that you know water that falls on your yard you should be taxed for
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:57.600]  because it waters your grass or waters your crops because the government owns the rain now i'm waiting
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:02.240]  for the sunshine tax it's like if you go outside and walk around the government they charge you by
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:07.760]  the mile for the sunshine that you collect because somehow now they own the sun and by the way don't
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:13.200]  give them ideas dr go ahead please i'm not even joking uh there well of course kassunstein says
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:18.880]  that the sun is not good for us and that and that we're conspiracy theorists if we say it right the
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:24.000]  sun which we all know we need to be and i mean if you ever go outside you know you feel better on a
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:30.800]  nice warm sunny day it feels good to walk out your body is designed uh to enjoy and use sunlight it
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:37.600]  actually creates vitamins in your body but you know if you read public uh written documents by
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:42.240]  government officials you think the sun was all bad and out there to kill you and it's the government's
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:46.240]  role to prevent you from having sunlight but by the way along that line because we were joking
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:52.880]  about taxing the sun kassunstein actually said if you say the sun is good for you put a tax on
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:58.560]  conspiracy theories he actually said tax saying the sun is good for you so in a way i guess that
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:02.960]  is a tax on the sun i don't know if i have any money left after being taxed i'm not sure what
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:07.600]  they're going to come after me for right now but yeah i believe the sun unless you're sitting out
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:13.200]  there roasting in it the sun is good for you well said my friend i want to come back and
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:18.720]  look at some of the other big attacks on vitamin and mineral companies i know that are happening
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:24.480]  right now and again we have some big i mean big breaking news when we start the next hour and then
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:31.840]  about 20 30 minutes up to that we're going to have a expert on mind control in studio with us
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:37.920]  even larry pratt of gun owners of america is saying that aurora looks like it was staged and now as
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:44.320]  things intensify we are really seeing the system come after our second amendment
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:49.840]  dr gold i know you're a libertarian slash you know patriot talk show host in your own right doc
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:55.280]  what is your view on the open calls restrict the second amendment now you know you have to
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:59.920]  wonder what where you could see it coming right after the shooting that was out in colorado with
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:05.200]  the tragic shooting and we're learning more and more things that make it seem kind of crazy you
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:10.960]  know it's looking more and more suspicious every day to me uh what happened out in colorado but
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:15.600]  you knew five seconds after it happened after your grief went away for the people that were shot
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:20.560]  i was waiting for the all the calls for gun control that followed immediately thereafter it was
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:24.960]  basically a uh you know the lightning struck and then the sonic boom that follows the thunder
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:30.880]  afterwards was more gun control you know as we sell actually give away guns to mexico look what's
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:36.000]  happening in mexico it's illegal to own a gun in mexico and there's more gun deaths in mexico
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.080]  than almost any place in the world so we should follow that model i guess according to the u.s
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:45.360]  government well it's all about enslavement and it's that simple but as time magazine had to admit
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:50.560]  we are winning the fight for the second amendment the system is panicking the public doesn't trust
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:55.520]  him anymore so what does quarry gold expect him to do next we'll come back with dr gold straight

[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:30.640]  i mean this really is about a revolution of taking our lives in our own hands and really
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:35.840]  coming out of this system and that's where health comes in they want us to be elitated
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:42.480]  so they can sell us drugs that they know we're making a sick well today the word in medicine
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:48.480]  is you're living with disease it's maintaining with a disease state it's not about preventing
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:53.520]  disease state it's not about curing disease state it's about living with disease if you
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:57.680]  listen to a lot of these things we have these drugs which will help you function normally or
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:02.800]  close to normally with these with these diseases that you have and what we're all about and what
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:08.160]  your show's a lot about is how do you without how do you not get them and how do if you have them
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:13.440]  how do you have your body work to fix them the best you can and that's where great things
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:17.760]  like water comes in and that's where food supplies come in and that's where vitamins and
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:22.480]  minerals come in and that's where doing things that just make common sense having pure water
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:30.160]  eating clean non-gmo food having vitamins minerals nutrients omega oils it just makes sense but yet
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:35.520]  you hear tv telling you that people talk about drinking clean water and people that want non-gmo
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:40.080]  food and people talk about supplement with vitamins and minerals are crazy people and it's like
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:45.760]  they're turning the world upside down on their head it's like what makes common sense is meant to be
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:53.440]  crazy and when the world buys into common sense being crazy we're in a weird place that's a good
[01:57:53.440 --> 01:58:01.120]  way to put it i'm always trying to describe how these corporate brainwashers sell us on the idea
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:07.360]  that we're the weirdos they really are selling us on an upside down world they're like yeah the

[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:11.120]  public figure he said he wanted to win for his dad the guy said that you let your dad down it's a
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:16.480]  nasty thing to say the police have arrested him because it's illegal to hurt someone's feelings
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:21.040]  in england this is the new thing where they're arresting people and we have the article up at
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:24.960]  info wars dot com people know i don't get off into the whole you know bashing different
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:29.760]  religions and groups i just stay out of it but you know what you've got to have the right
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:35.600]  if you're the chick filet owner to say i think a marriage between a man and a woman you shouldn't
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:40.560]  have rama manual say shut it down you know we're not going to let you operate in chicago i mean that
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:46.560]  is very dangerous okay i yeah go ahead that was like one of the biggest topics on my show is and
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:52.000]  people were really really in favor of what rama manual was saying i'm saying listen to you we
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:57.760]  left england because the government was tyrannical and was dictating to us and here we are having a
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:02.640]  mayor say you don't have a right to own a business because of your political point of view and your
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:08.560]  religious point of view it's it's like insulting to the country they heard of nazi germany because
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:13.120]  that's how the the discrimination started against certain groups was not letting them have businesses
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:18.000]  at first well i mean think about it i mean that that same city would be happy to confiscate your
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:22.560]  weapons would be happy to take your pack lunches away from your children give them government
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:27.280]  lunches and would be happy to tell you if you don't believe with the same way as the mayor believes
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:31.280]  then you're gonna have to go somewhere else to have a job because you won't get a license in
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:37.040]  that state i mean the thought is is that this person's a a conservative who but does not believe
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:42.240]  in same-sex marriage that's just his worldview okay for him but that now bars him from honing
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:46.640]  a restaurant in the city because of his political religious point of view and if you disagree with
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:53.760]  that view that's your right don't go there but listen it gets worse they're now saying in england
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:59.680]  that uh that if you criticize islam you'll be arrested period and now in congressional testimony
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:06.000]  yesterday the video is up at info wars dot com the deputy attorney general will not say that they
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:13.440]  won't arrest americans that criticize islam i it's a very spooky space where you're now worried
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:19.520]  that what you say could get you arrested or get you on some kind of list that gets you in trouble
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:23.600]  simply because you say i don't believe in a law or i don't believe in the way the government's going
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:27.680]  or i'm not happy with the tax law or i think we should have more freedom of speech or i'm not
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:32.000]  pro gay or i am pro gay that could get you in trouble with the government and quite frankly get
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:39.360]  a website shut down simply because your personal point of view is anti what a regulator likes it's
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:43.600]  very scary when the set when the first amendment the second amendment go away we're no longer the
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:48.800]  united states of america and again the model of political correctness that they have in europe
[02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:55.040]  and england now you say to somebody you let your dad down i hope you know that because the guy had
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:59.600]  made it all about winning the gold medal for his dad well i mean you know you let your dad down
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:04.080]  that's a creepy thing to say you know i'd say something like hey your dad's still proud of
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:08.160]  you looking down from heaven you're in the arena great job but if somebody wants to be a troll
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:14.320]  and a creep you get arrested for that that is serious authoritarianism and now they're saying
[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:19.040]  there's paul watson and his brother who right from he lived there and they say if you criticize
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:26.240]  even an islamic radical group you'll be arrested now in england i mean this is just just so bizarre
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:34.320]  car and it is a very very very very scary thing at the ap says the uk police arrest
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:39.360]  man over twitter insult we just showed one saying they're investigating they've now arrested

[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:12.080]  magnitude of the fact we're being poisoned by design well the body is able to heal itself the
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:19.600]  globalists want to make you sick i lost 40 pounds on this and it's not even a weight loss product
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:24.080]  and yes i'm infomercial here only do this like once a month or something but i do it with things i
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:31.040]  really really believe in air and lost 92 pounds and the reason is the food has had the minerals
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:36.560]  taken out of it because of the fertilizers they use the the ground being played out not being
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:41.440]  left fallow it's basic farming rules you know they go back to leviticus and before we're not
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:47.760]  following any of that common sense and so plants take two or three minerals to grow we take
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:54.240]  a whole bunch upwards of 90 and even mainline vitamins and stuff don't have all the 90 vitamins
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:10:00.480]  and minerals and trace elements they'll have like 45 or 50 or 60 when you get the pollen burst
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:04.800]  now pollen burst plus that's the announcement when you get beyond tangy tangerine when you get
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:10.080]  the products at info wars team dot com it's not advertised as weight loss but you won't be as hungry
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:16.240]  you'll have more energy because and again my only problem is i am not accustomed to taking it three
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:21.440]  or four times a day erin's followed it totally and lost 92 pounds we're about to do a whole promotion
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:25.600]  rolling that out and and going over it but if you're a radio listener go look at an erin dyke's

[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:43.120]  team but tell us about the pollen burst plus well it just happened to be a great timing we were
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:46.960]  you'd mentioned to me how much you like pollen burst and we were working on a new formulation
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:51.520]  of pollen burst plot pollen burst that had even more in it than the original pollen burst and
[02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:57.440]  we call pollen burst plus it's called uh the new berry blast and it's actually a formulation that
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:01.920]  you tried actually before i even tried the flavor of it so i know where i sit in the pecking order
[02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:06.400]  of things because you called me up telling me how much you liked it before i got my samples
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:10.800]  and it's a very flavored beverage so it's got everything the original pollen burst had in it
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:16.000]  except we've added new zealand black currant to it so we've just supercharged the antioxidant
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:21.680]  property to it and a lot of people are becoming aware of black currant the superfood now it's
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:27.360]  one of the super berries that's out there loaded in antioxidants it's got a lot of natural vitamin
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:33.840]  c in it it's got uh it's even got e f a's in it's got omega sixes in it uh which is good for making

[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:51.040]  reconnect because that's becoming a bit unintelligible yeah the point is is this is the best energy drink
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:55.760]  out there i won't take energy drinks because give me headaches i love coffee but if i drink three or
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:15:02.240]  four cups if i'm say staying up here till midnight working i get burned out i get mean pollen burst
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:06.720]  and i tried some of their other energy drinks to the longevity puts out and they're they're good
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:12.480]  but not as good as pollen burst and so that's around here that's what i drink we've got the
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:18.080]  other ones rebounds good as well but the point is i really like pollen burst well now i don't drink the
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:25.280]  other flavor it still tastes great i like the berry flavor and you heard it it it's got job

[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:25.840]  dr. gold what's the difference because i love the way coffee tastes okay and i buy you know local
[02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:32.720]  root of my coffee love it's from mexico but uh take starbucks coffee i drink one of those i'm i'm
[02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:36.720]  i'm high as a kite for five hours but then i get really grumpy and have a headache and everybody
[02:16:36.720 --> 02:16:42.640]  i know is the same way uh but so coffee does something to you uh you know root of my i can
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:47.680]  drink four or five cups before i get a headache uh it'd be starbucks one but coffee's great though i
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:51.120]  mean i like coffee it's got some health benefits i've read about me you can tell me if i'm wrong
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:57.360]  but i can drink if i need to two or three pollen bursts over the day stay up till midnight i'm doing
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:17:02.560]  coast to coast a.m i've been up since six a.m the day before bam pollen burst an hour before
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:08.000]  i feel great can go to bed at the end i used to could not drink any amount of coffee to try to stay
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:13.200]  up and alert and quite frankly would turn to beer for whatever reason beer would have a stimulus
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:18.400]  effect for me when when caffeine wouldn't anymore what's different about pollen burst now that i
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:22.800]  don't need to drink beer if i'm on an overnight radio show to stay up i can take a pollen burst
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:28.080]  uh well you see what happens when i get excited about pollen burst i broke skype that's what happened
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:32.800]  that's what happened that's how powerful this new product is and and i i'm by the way i'm very
[02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:36.720]  proud to be working with the info wars with this and supporting the info wars with this product
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:42.080]  and we wanted to make it the best one you asked about you know coffee versus other things that
[02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:47.280]  help you with energy this has some green tea in it it's just a smaller amount we get our energy
[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:53.600]  from a combination of different things things with antioxidants in them like superfoods and ecgcs
[02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:57.760]  and all those other things that put into this product they do contribute to increasing energy
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:02.080]  but through a different mechanism so there is some green tea in it it does have a little
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:07.200]  bit of endogenous caffeine in it but it's not like drinking a starbucks like you said coffee
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:11.840]  and i'm a fan of coffee too but you're right it does have a very different effect on the body
[02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:16.800]  when you drink drink a lot of caffeine and then you your body goes away from the caffeine so
[02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:22.080]  it's a kind of a crashing situation and this doesn't do that this is very smooth very yeah but a lot
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:27.200]  of other energy drinks have that crash this doesn't have the crash and that's not just type folks try
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:32.240]  it out the regular pollen burst the pollen burst plus at info wars team dot com and specifically
[02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:39.680]  on the alcohol issue i know it's classed as a uh depressant but why for myself does it have a
[02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:45.360]  stimulant effect it all depends how much alcohol you have in your body because eventually as your
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:50.800]  body is trying to digest and and eliminate the alcohol your body sees alcohol as a toxin so
[02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:54.800]  when it's going through that elimination phase eventually your body does see it as a depressant
[02:18:54.800 --> 02:19:00.880]  small amounts can excite the body yeah i'm talking about you know like a beer yeah like one beer will
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:05.920]  wake me up uh but but then i don't even really like it and then i can't go to sleep and these
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:10.720]  people always talk about i'm just describing what i've learned keeps me up but i don't need
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:15.760]  coffee and i don't need a beer anymore to stay up now i just have a pollen burst i'm saying it is

[02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:04.160]  yahoo news today i mean the incredible things are happening right now the world
[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:10.000]  is just racing towards tyranny dr. kory gold what do you make of obama using al-qaeda to take
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:16.320]  over libya and now syria i'm not saying qaddafi or or a sodder good guys but compared to al-qaeda
[02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:22.720]  i mean i'm not a supporter of al-qaeda and i know that means i'm not patriotic nowadays to be patriotic
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:28.560]  is you want drones checkpoints no freedom turn your guns in i guess i mean i guess they're
[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:34.480]  telling us the founders you know gun owners libertarians we are the terrorist well al-qaeda was
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:40.160]  great when they were fighting the russians in afghanistan and then al-qaeda was bad when they
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:45.840]  were fighting us in afghanistan now al-qaeda is good again because they're helping they're helping
[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:50.960]  get rid of a sod in syria so i i guess it just depends it's kind of like baseball players it
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:54.960]  all depends which uniform they're wearing that day it's the same guy just what uniform they're
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:59.680]  wearing that day it is crazy when you think about it that we're fighting al-qaeda except
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:05.040]  they're helping us fight in syria because we don't like that guy more um you're right drones are
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:09.360]  flying but people think it's good because it's protecting them the internet's being censored
[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:13.280]  but that's good because people aren't getting their feelings hurt uh the government's putting
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:17.760]  lithium or wants what lithium in the water because you shouldn't have any opinions or be sad ever
[02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:22.560]  because emotions are no good for you you know you start wondering where we're heading with us
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:28.000]  a mere boomberg is telling people yeah abortions are great in new york but you know you can't
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:32.640]  have a breast you can't have formula for your children because the government would prefer
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:38.080]  you do this instead we're really the wacky place but it is kind of crazy when you think about when
[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:44.560]  is al-qaeda our friend and when is it our enemy and is it the same day sometimes and then meanwhile
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:48.960]  they're trying to restrict vitamins and minerals but dr wallach's been leading the charge to stop
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:56.800]  that but then they want to legalize anti psychotics and things like oxy cotton for four-year-olds
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:02.000]  oh you just think about it there are commercials on the air right now it says if your first anti
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:06.640]  depressant isn't working a good enough well enough we've got a second anti-depressant you can put
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:10.960]  on top of that but be very careful of vitamins and minerals those could be dangerous for you
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:16.080]  anybody who listens to this convertible pick up a tube of toothpaste read the warning on the back

[02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:55.680]  government literature in his house oh he robbed a bank with no proof and all this stuff they could
[02:33:55.680 --> 02:34:00.080]  do that to me too they put him in jail and for seven years he just got out as you know about a
[02:34:00.080 --> 02:34:04.400]  year ago he first time he's traveled outside the state he lives in you know he's got to call his
[02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:08.480]  probation officer having to be here just spent a day with his dad he's about to turn around and go
[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:14.560]  home now but he's here today for just about 30 minutes in studio than an hour commercial free
[02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:21.280]  uh you know uninterrupted interview tonight seven o'clock central info works nightly news 15 day

[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:35.600]  lines the illuminati now because i mean 15 years ago i i knew about the fellow reserve of the new
[02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:40.400]  world order i didn't believe they were sacrificing people i mean now they take the head of penn state
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:44.880]  and make him a secret homeland security commander and it turns out they're all a bunch of i mean
[02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:50.960]  just absolute scum uh and for normal people you know we know all our works for dirty rags before
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:55.200]  god i mean i'm aggressive i'm everything else but i don't want to hurt innocent people in fact
[02:34:56.240 --> 02:35:02.160]  the only lust i got is to beat the brains out of bullies and it is a sin because i just like i
[02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:07.440]  cannot help it and i just people that hurt kids i got a normal instinct that i want to
[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:14.400]  to really get angry but i'm i'm using the info war to go after our enemies so everybody knows
[02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:20.640]  who the enemy is but this book blood lines the illuminati is off the charts wild and now 15 years
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:26.000]  after i first read it it's back in print wasn't even in print and we got it back in print uh so
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:30.160]  it's all coming from info wars dot com right now you can find other places but it comes from us
[02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:35.760]  this book is available at info wars dot com info wars shop dot com but that's not why he's here
[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:40.000]  we only got about 25 minutes left i want to give him the floor we're gonna do an in-depth breakdown
[02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:44.560]  in fact he's got it out in the car there's only five in print left i'm thinking about trying to get
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:50.560]  that back in print the illuminati formula to create a totally undetectable mind control slave now i
[02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:54.640]  was asking i go you wrote three or four books on mind control right because i read those years
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:35:59.280]  after i read this and found out he wasn't because i mean this sounded like cuckoo for cocoa puff stuff
[02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:03.440]  when i was ignorant i understand why this stuff sounds crazy but i mean look at all the other
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:09.440]  governments and elites and crazy stuff they did it's actually normal for these elites in history
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:12.960]  because they just get more and more evil they compete with each other for you know who's more
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:17.680]  evil and he's written like four other books in my wrong threats on on mind control and i said which
[02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:24.480]  one is it where you say they use movie trailers to program it and that and and and then you go over
[02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:29.920]  it all and you said no that's the formula that's the formula book so here you are now we've got
[02:36:29.920 --> 02:36:34.080]  footage of this james home's guy with all the department of defense i said watch you'll have
[02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:40.240]  some pentagon as psychiatrists turned out that was the case they roll him out he can't even talk
[02:36:40.240 --> 02:36:46.080]  he was back in court today didn't know who he was couldn't talk i mean he might not even been the
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:50.800]  shooter because you know they've got mind control folks as you've documented and as they've declassified
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:56.960]  now where they do act normal but they could be the new personality and they activate it and then
[02:36:56.960 --> 02:37:01.120]  the person acts normal but doesn't remember this guy could just be some patsy drugged up
[02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:06.480]  electroshock therapy but you're the real expert on this because you learned from the inside when
[02:37:06.480 --> 02:37:12.240]  you burrowed into an illuminati coven but but breakdown watching this james home's shooting
[02:37:12.240 --> 02:37:19.680]  the dark night all the news articles about violent finale on the cover of magazines uh you're gonna
[02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:25.120]  you know killer finale we see uh trailers of gangster shooting everyone to movie theater
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:31.440]  right before it happens multiple shooters reported stand downs uh photo shops of gas mask
[02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:38.800]  the gun control bill only a few weeks out when it happened you see all that and you see the police
[02:37:38.800 --> 02:37:44.240]  chief work for bloomberg the head of intelligence i mean uh a few miles from littleton colorada
[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:50.480]  give us your take on this and then break down a little bit of time we have here as kind of a
[02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:57.120]  hors d'oeuvre or preview of tonight we're doing our uh in studio on the nightly news what you
[02:37:57.120 --> 02:38:03.600]  think of this case and then and then from actual real program people because it's proof that i mean
[02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:09.680]  you totally documented how it operates so much of it declassified now how this really works
[02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:17.200]  yes it does have all the hallmarks of being a false flag and a false flag that they created with
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:25.360]  a mind controlled uh assassin uh you look at his parents that's one of the clues and and then his
[02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:31.600]  grandparents but his father being part of DARPA his father being uh involved with banking and
[02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:40.160]  creating algorithms that and it ties into also uh uh the big banking scandal that's over in England
[02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:47.920]  that uh they fixed the interest rates very low um which has been part of the reason why americans
[02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:53.760]  have been having this financial crisis and that scandal was going to be exposed and his father
[02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:59.200]  was going to testify before congress so we're talking about his father and and grandfather
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:05.600]  being notable people these are the kind of uh families that have same thing with harris and
[02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:12.160]  climb old mm-hmm they they had parents were both in DARPA you can't make this up right and and little
[02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:18.160]  ten itself is uh a a retirement place for cia so we're talking about an area that's
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:27.840]  full of these kind of people and uh and then just uh his the way his eyes looked and and like you
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:33.120]  were saying he didn't the first time he came in he couldn't even speak all of these little things
[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:38.320]  our clues he still can't talk they said today uh but now they won't show video they're just showing
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:45.360]  sketches he just sits there blanking i mean he's obviously shell shocked yes yes and uh
[02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:51.040]  so they're probably doing something to try to get them in line with whatever they want him to say
[02:39:51.040 --> 02:40:00.400]  or do to to uh go along with the script but it definitely to me uh has a lot of clues that would
[02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:08.800]  say this guy was programmed to go in and do this clear back in the 1990s i was warning people that
[02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:14.960]  they were going to go in and do these kind of shootings um no that's what clicked the the
[02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:20.880]  learning were coming to texas it was so wild because fritz you said i'm going from memory here but
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:26.080]  i mean you talked about movie trailers programming mass shootings you talked about mass shootings
[02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:34.720]  in public well i mean it's all in your books which books talks about that um it it may have been uh
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:41.520]  prophecy club speeches you know i i don't know specifically because i i wrote so much stuff
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:50.160]  the by's a serpents book back in 1990 said that they were going to go in and do assassinations
[02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:57.760]  um or mass mass killings so it may have been it may have gone clear back to 1990
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:04.000]  yeah well let's continue now uh with this case of the different types of mind control operatives
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:13.520]  uh what it's very simple for them to do they they already have everything in place
[02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:21.600]  in in the person's mind they have programmed a part of the mind to to do its job and it that part of
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:28.400]  the mind doesn't really have a sense of reality it may may not even um when it goes in and pulls
[02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:33.200]  the trigger may not even think that it's really shooting real bullets it's a hypnotic command
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:41.680]  right it's a hypnotic command and um the part that they use to do that has been created through
[02:41:41.680 --> 02:41:47.040]  trauma it's called trauma-based mind control and that disassociative part has been programmed but
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:52.960]  it has no sense of greater reality it's just doing its job and this is all on record dr
[02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:57.840]  human cameron had government kidnapped thousands of children this is on history channel with
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:04.480]  electroshock torture and drugs can make him do whatever he wanted total program right the cia
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:10.480]  name for it was mk ultra but there it was monarch project and a lot of other names it's
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:16.080]  gone by a lot of names basically it's it's trauma-based mind control there was a charles
[02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:22.400]  bronson movie telephone which shows the end result of this they and i've i've actually watched all of
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:29.200]  this and it actually happened people i was working with to help deprogram them i've i've stood there
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:33.680]  and listened to the little nursery rhyme ditties that they would come over the phone and say to try
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:38.400]  to get these people to do things i've heard it myself i've seen it first hand it's not just a
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:46.480]  movie to me but in in the telephone this charles bronson movie they call up this woman just give
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:51.680]  her a little diddy she goes out and blows up the military base and that's the way it works i've
[02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:57.760]  sat there and watched it well how dumb do they think we are uh jolly and west number two mind
[02:42:57.760 --> 02:43:04.000]  control in congressional hearings and then he becomes the main doctor for mcvey i mean how
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:09.120]  obvious i mean how obvious is this have to get it's obvious it's right there out in front of our
[02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:14.320]  face and yet people are in denial about what's happening happening hey we should grab that off
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:18.560]  netflix or something to play a club it's not on the nightly news charles charles bronson's
[02:43:18.560 --> 02:43:23.520]  telephone that's a good movie too yeah and there's the guy chasing him around trying to stop it from
[02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:29.920]  happening exactly yeah there's there's been a whole series of movies but yeah but and that's
[02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:34.320]  the old trauma based i've been reading well 20 years ago they had remote control cockroaches with
[02:43:34.320 --> 02:43:39.280]  one chip 20 years ago they had robo rat they have them now where you can buy them a real rat of your
[02:43:39.280 --> 02:43:43.600]  government and it goes into like rubble and stuff it has a chip in the brain with a camera on its head
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:48.880]  right so they've now moved on to that i mean they listen my dad was like top of his class dentist
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:54.320]  and darplay in the mid 80s tried to hire him and he said they were hiring a bunch of dallas
[02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:58.160]  dentists and he said yeah we've moved to maryland i can't talk about it it's about three times what
[02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:03.920]  i'm making and he owns some dental offices then they wanted him to go train well the he wasn't
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:08.800]  allowed to say everything and he didn't meet with him much but the department of defense under darpa
[02:44:08.800 --> 02:44:13.440]  tried to hire my dad to quote go underground and i said well what does that mean i remember around
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:18.080]  the kitchen table it was even before my sister came along she's 14 years younger than me he's
[02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:22.320]  like yeah i don't think i want to do that and he but he just said well they want me because i know how
[02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:29.200]  to fuse uh metal and things into bone and he said they won't tell me but it's probably hiding things
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:33.920]  inside spies he said he said it's it's cyber i don't know what cybernetics was when i was like
[02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:39.360]  eight years old he says like cybernetics or cyborgs you know what those are son and i remember
[02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:44.400]  later asking well was it just you know they were trying to hire a bunch of dentists right
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:52.240]  and we had one victim of mind control that came up to oregon uh back in the 90s and
[02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:58.080]  she was trying to get help for her implants that she had she came back to texas to dalis
[02:44:58.080 --> 02:45:03.440]  was in an anechoic chamber managed to get the proof that signals were being sent into her
[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:11.680]  and then managed to extract one of the the little implants that they were using to try to control her
[02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:20.240]  so yeah this and so exactly what you're saying is happening but again it's not like oh my dad got
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:26.320]  visited by them they were trying to hire all the top dentists that were doing implants of course
[02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:30.880]  implants weren't real new then and he was taking all the classes and pioneering doing implants you
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:36.560]  know you know now everybody gets implants but i guess that was one reason right so there there
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:41.760]  are newer techniques probably that go beyond the trauma-based mind control that they're using on
[02:45:41.760 --> 02:45:46.960]  top of it but i've been watching and they're still using the trauma-based mind control that
[02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:53.040]  seems to be like the foundation and then they add these other things um and a lot of it's sexual
[02:45:53.840 --> 02:45:57.840]  tell us about the sand dusky situation all that you've exposed the abuse of children
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:03.840]  john de camp like 10 years ago or more had said on air that the football program at pen state was
[02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:08.720]  doing this and i shut him down because i didn't want to get sued and it turns out that's all true
[02:46:08.720 --> 02:46:14.320]  now they've hired the former head of pen state in a national security function so secret we can't be
[02:46:14.320 --> 02:46:23.520]  told yeah um like they were using boys home to uh get the young boys for the politicians yeah
[02:46:23.520 --> 02:46:30.080]  it was boys town that came out yep right and so there's no end to where they can find these
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:36.320]  children to abuse and um people ask me well how how do they get the children to do this
[02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:45.520]  well it's everywhere the answer is so kids disappear all the time yeah and um like sisco
[02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:50.160]  when we went out in the countryside she was showing me some of the routes that they use to
[02:46:50.160 --> 02:46:56.400]  to move the children and so forth so yeah again it's something that i've i have been able to track
[02:46:56.400 --> 02:47:00.640]  and i know it's happening how many do they mind control versus kills they like to torture kids
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:08.720]  too that's their favorite yeah um what's the ratio of ones that live to those that that um die and
[02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:14.800]  during the programming i don't know it's probably at least a 50-50 ratio it may be worse why did they
[02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:19.200]  come after you because you know back at the time i was just starting to learn eight nine years ago
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:23.920]  when they set you up that wow this stuff's real they really are transylvanian now that's admitted
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:29.840]  he you know he run you know all this crazy stuff is real and i remember talking to you when i first
[02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:33.600]  heard an interview and you saw him when i figured out wow you weren't making this up it was in the
[02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:37.200]  news like they were rating you the saying oh he has anti-government literature they were trying to
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:41.920]  say you had marijuana they were and then suddenly they get you for a bank robbery no criminal record
[02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:46.720]  west point out of the blue now you're a bank robber uh well i mean i guess you just kept them
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:55.200]  wrong toes and my attorney that went into court with me a when i had like my first or second
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:59.840]  meeting with him i took one of those bloodlines books and i was across the desk from him and i
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:04.320]  started to hand it to him because i wanted him to get to know who his client was his eyes got big
[02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:12.080]  and he goes am i in that did you write about me um but he told me that uh they had been trying to
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:18.880]  put me in prison for a long time for what i was doing and and he basically in more or less in
[02:48:18.880 --> 02:48:25.600]  different words he said they're after you because what you've done and let's just be clear no criminal
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:35.440]  record west point uh you know ben ommish all of this stuff no mo for this stuff selling tens of
[02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:40.320]  thousands of books speaking to crowds of two three thousand people i mean just in demand everywhere
[02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:45.680]  and then you go rob a bank and then who did they have but some informants saying that well yeah
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:51.920]  and technically they didn't say i i robbed a bank they were saying that i knew about this bank robbery
[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:58.880]  and they had three witnesses that came in to testified but they were only testifying hearsay
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:09.280]  and actually what what went down in the courtroom was was very nebulous uh a person that was didn't
[02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:15.280]  believe in the government would not have found me guilty because they didn't really present any
[02:49:15.280 --> 02:49:22.720]  evidence and they tried to put joe banister uh you know top top of his class uh cpa treasury agent
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:28.400]  in jail twice just for speaking out and saying hey this money goes to the federal reserve i mean
[02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:33.040]  they try to put him in jail well they did send him to a federal prison off of california for a
[02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:37.440]  while till he won his case yeah no but that's what i mean i mean that they people need to understand
[02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:43.520]  they set people up they've tried to set me up yeah and i was watching out here in the studio
[02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:48.160]  you have a great crew here i want to mention that i've been really impressed with what
[02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:57.440]  your your setup here but i i also was observing that you know you have this normal oh it's like
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:02.640]  there's monkey wrenches thrown into the system that you have to constantly overcome to be able
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:09.680]  to give people the show that you do um and and so people are always asking me why doesn't alex jones
[02:50:09.680 --> 02:50:15.760]  get any opposition well you do get your share of opposition well we just don't spend all day on it
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:24.480]  right um right people only knew right right i used to get a lot more opposition they figured out
[02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:28.640]  i'm not going i mean i'm not backing off and i think i've hit that threshold where we are big
[02:50:28.640 --> 02:50:34.080]  enough now where they're like uh we if they destroy me wrong and i live a pretty boring
[02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:39.200]  lives there's not much to set me up for if they destroy me wrong it'll backfire on them right

[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:45.200]  they're going to drones robots autonomous systems like they're giving guys medals right now that
[02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:50.640]  kill whole villages to kill one person and they'll kill 150 200 people and they they talk about how
[02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:55.840]  well they must be al-qaeda they'll kill anybody they want they're saying they'll kill us and the
[02:54:55.840 --> 02:55:00.960]  globalist dream of a system with robots and drones where we're not even in the equation
[02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:06.480]  so i want the military to know you're being made obsolete fritz spring mire yes that's true
[02:55:06.480 --> 02:55:14.560]  they're also changing the human genome there a number of the guys that the that were created
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:22.480]  by the military to be super superman super soldiers have contacted me uh they're pretty upset about
[02:55:22.480 --> 02:55:30.160]  being uh created there because they know that they're uh strange creatures um they're they're
[02:55:30.160 --> 02:55:35.680]  being given the dna of different animals you know like maybe give yeah let's be clear they're now
[02:55:35.680 --> 02:55:40.560]  admitting that 30 years ago they were creating cross b season had clones right the public's
[02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:45.200]  just now being told about this right oh you're saying you've had contacts with well a number
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:53.520]  yeah yeah before i i got my extended federal vacation a number of these guys had contacted me
[02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:57.680]  and they were they were seriously upset because they felt like they were freaks they felt like
[02:55:57.680 --> 02:56:04.080]  they were being used their bodies had been created to be aquaman for for instance or a super soldier
[02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:11.440]  on land and um you know they knew what they were they knew they were freaks and and so this is what's
[02:56:11.440 --> 02:56:16.160]  been going on there now they have monkeys that are part jellyfish and they have all spiders that
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:21.200]  are half you know you know part go but but but you're saying you were actually i mean i know they've
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:26.000]  i mean i know they had secretive programs well that's why and then of course we we see hollywood
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:31.840]  movies like that bandam movie where where they they're making these like they're half people
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:37.760]  half robots you know so they're they're they're experimenting with a lot of stuff and and we're
[02:56:37.760 --> 02:56:45.280]  seeing some of it come through and that's why they're so arrogant now oh yeah yeah i they there is a
[02:56:45.280 --> 02:56:50.960]  sort of an atmosphere like they don't really care about us we're just like flies on an elephant
[02:56:50.960 --> 02:56:54.640]  or something you know it's it's like like they said that's why more and more of the global
[02:56:54.640 --> 02:56:58.800]  assault even act like we matter no i mean i know one thing they've admittedly got bio weapons that
[02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:04.240]  killed 99 of people and they're talking about releasing them dick shaney wrote in september
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:09.360]  20 in 2000 he said we may need to release a weapon to kill everybody and and only the austin american
[02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:14.320]  states from where we live said well that's not a very good idea i'm not good he said we need to
[02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:19.040]  have the media legitimize the you know to release this race weapon they didn't say well who they want
[02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:23.840]  to kill they just said we're gonna kill a certain couple certain races you know yeah not a big deal
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:28.240]  though for that said yeah that's why you talk about super soldiers uniquely engineered i know
[02:57:28.240 --> 02:57:32.800]  they've looked into that i know there's been i was always told by my sources they kill them at the
[02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:37.280]  embryonic phase like they don't let these little embryos get big but you're saying they actually
[02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:44.240]  brought them to term yes yes or at least these guys were telling you that well they wanted to
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:49.200]  come visit me we never had visits they they could have if they had come visited me i would have seen
[02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:55.280]  him you know face to face what they were talking about well i know mine controls drill and that
[02:57:55.280 --> 02:58:00.480]  sounds really wild yeah i know they've got remote control rats 20 years ago living rats with a
[02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:06.320]  brain chip yeah and you can make him go forward left right sit stand up on his feet with a little
[02:58:06.320 --> 02:58:12.640]  camera on them and that's that's that's right and then the timing of this james holmes shooting
[02:58:13.520 --> 02:58:19.280]  is i i mean it couldn't come at a better time you know because they were trying to get this
[02:58:19.280 --> 02:58:26.240]  legislation through the united nations um to bring united states into uh in line with the rest of
[02:58:26.240 --> 02:58:32.000]  you know i want to not believe you but i mean we just had on screen where uh prince charles is
