[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-up you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GDN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:33.320]  to fix Obamacare Congress will have to stand down and allow Obama to operate
[00:33.320 --> 00:37.260]  outside of the courts outside of law outside of Congress and of course this
[00:37.260 --> 00:40.760]  is the big test now because the Republican leadership you know helped
[00:40.760 --> 00:44.080]  right this with foreign banks so so they they wanted to go through that's
[00:44.080 --> 00:49.000]  their orders and so now Obama will be like hey let me do what I want else not
[00:49.000 --> 00:52.360]  a law and I'll give you the free healthcare and then of course you'll
[00:52.360 --> 00:56.200]  let him be dictator it'll get even worse as I keep telling you from years and
[00:56.200 --> 01:01.240]  months specifically and then it'll just get worse and worse and worse it's
[01:01.240 --> 01:04.600]  like you stuck your arm in something and something bit your finger off you
[01:04.600 --> 01:08.360]  wouldn't stick your arm back in there so you stick your arm in the Obamacare
[01:08.360 --> 01:14.040]  hole and you pull it out and three fingers are been chewed off and you
[01:14.040 --> 01:18.920]  hear a voice going I love you stick your hand back in I'll give you a bag of gold
[01:18.920 --> 01:23.480]  if you stick your hand back in you know come to healthcare.gov oh I love you I
[01:23.480 --> 01:28.560]  love you I love you and you go well it sounds sweet you know it sounds like
[01:28.560 --> 01:37.280]  Harry Lennox who now has gone public to media in Chicago that he actually for
[01:37.280 --> 01:40.600]  years was there and trained Obama and then you watch and listen to Lennox you
[01:40.600 --> 01:45.600]  go back to videos him years ago he's Obama he's the guy he's the American
[01:45.600 --> 01:51.040]  he's the smooth talking guy the Shakespearean actor who trained obozo
[01:51.040 --> 01:55.200]  and I mean I mean we know Obama I shouldn't call him obozo but I like to
[01:55.200 --> 01:58.520]  denigrate their puppets he's actually a viciously successful puppet who
[01:58.520 --> 02:02.720]  savagely stabbed America in the back a thousand times and we're bleeding out
[02:02.720 --> 02:06.400]  right now so he's actually the great destroyer the most successful new
[02:06.400 --> 02:11.280]  order agent ever against the Republic Benedict Arnold rolls in his grave with
[02:11.280 --> 02:17.120]  jealousy flopping end-of-a-end foaming at the mouth with which is absolute
[02:17.120 --> 02:23.320]  repine let's get into some of the obozo care news they're now reporting that the
[02:23.320 --> 02:28.040]  fix could make it worse that's what McClatchy saying of course always going
[02:28.040 --> 02:35.800]  to make it worse that's the plan more navigators exposed in new video with the
[02:35.800 --> 02:40.080]  Veritas project where they're telling them to engage in fraud and cheat
[02:40.080 --> 02:43.680]  everyone and lie on everything and commit felonies and that they work for
[02:43.680 --> 02:46.920]  the Democratic Party and then if they're gonna take over the country and no
[02:46.920 --> 02:49.680]  mainstream media is picking that up because again this is the age of total
[02:49.680 --> 02:54.360]  criminality GOP warns of constitutional crisis but they're controlled at the top
[02:54.360 --> 02:58.840]  so don't expect anything Democratic representative says they haven't seen
[02:58.840 --> 03:04.360]  this much panic since 9-11 and that was a staged event too and the New York
[03:04.360 --> 03:07.960]  Times says there's a crisis in confidence in obozo well doesn't matter
[03:07.960 --> 03:15.000]  he's not facing reelection so he's designed the abomination the ovomet that's
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.880]  the best thing because they're vomiting out their hatred on us with Obama like
[03:19.880 --> 03:26.440]  boiling oil dumped off a castle wall on our heads so we think it's a crisis in
[03:26.440 --> 03:30.320]  confidence and then that will run everyone to the self-propelled Baron
[03:30.320 --> 03:36.120]  Harkinen job of the huts illegitimate son the governor of New Jersey that will
[03:36.120 --> 03:43.200]  run everyone to him and his suspensor belts and then of course he'll come in
[03:43.200 --> 03:48.080]  and double down the savagery and then all the neocon talk show hustle to
[03:48.080 --> 03:51.560]  send him and say you're liberal if you don't like him and that I'm a commie
[03:51.560 --> 03:56.240]  because I don't like Christie and all the rest of it I mean this is how they
[03:56.240 --> 04:01.040]  operate this is how the game works and if America puts up with this again I
[04:01.040 --> 04:04.200]  know there's electronic voting machines and a lot of fraud but it doesn't matter
[04:04.200 --> 04:08.320]  we should be out in the streets by the millions demanding the resignation of
[04:08.320 --> 04:18.440]  the abomination vomitus Maximus ludus Brutus
[04:18.800 --> 04:25.160]  tortoise I mean I'm trying to come up with names in Latin here a little bit of
[04:25.160 --> 04:32.160]  pig Latin here to describe what they're doing to us ladies and gentlemen but I
[04:32.160 --> 04:35.920]  gotta have some gallows humor sometimes I have a really trouble dealing with us
[04:35.920 --> 04:40.000]  just watching the total criminal takeover and them dancing around on the
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.440]  grave of America shutting everything down restaurants I should go to or shut
[04:43.440 --> 04:45.840]  down or half empty movie theaters are empty
[04:45.840 --> 04:49.200]  tony means imploding I live in the best city in the country and I can see the
[04:49.200 --> 04:53.000]  rot setting in everywhere while globalists fly around above me going to

[08:19.240 --> 08:23.200]  Texas alex jones
[08:23.200 --> 08:43.600]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this Friday edition we
[08:43.600 --> 08:47.120]  are now into the second hour we have a guest that we're getting hooked up on
[08:47.120 --> 08:51.920]  skype right now who's an expert on the technotronic technocracy age of the
[08:51.920 --> 08:57.400]  government the governing system that the globalist to actually describe themselves
[08:57.400 --> 09:01.360]  as being adherents of and this is a system they're trying to set up so that's
[09:01.360 --> 09:07.280]  coming up here in a few minutes first off congressman McDermott is saying he
[09:07.280 --> 09:12.760]  hasn't seen this much panic on the floor since 9-11 House Democrat appears
[09:12.760 --> 09:18.480]  congressional panic over Obamacare to worst-care attack in nations history well
[09:18.480 --> 09:24.120]  yeah that manufactured globalist event killed 3,000 people almost tragic and
[09:24.120 --> 09:27.920]  then thousands more from the deadly dust the government lied about but this is
[09:27.920 --> 09:32.760]  going to kill the economy and the engine of prosperity and kill millions
[09:32.760 --> 09:38.440]  through death panels and ration care on record I mean we knew what was in the
[09:38.440 --> 09:44.840]  bill we knew the plan and now get ready get ready to become impoverished because
[09:44.840 --> 09:47.960]  they want you impoverished under cloward and piven to give up on the free market
[09:47.960 --> 09:53.520]  blame capitalism for crony fraud capitalism that they brought in where
[09:53.520 --> 09:58.960]  they socialize our lives but then transfer the wealth to themselves so that
[09:58.960 --> 10:05.280]  is just some of the news also CBS is reporting that they TSA agent officer
[10:05.280 --> 10:10.400]  bled for 33 minutes in LAX shooting airports as opposed the most secure
[10:10.400 --> 10:14.840]  places in the country except for like military bases and then this guy bled
[10:14.840 --> 10:18.960]  for 33 minutes all they got the SWAT team all suited up and ready again it's
[10:18.960 --> 10:22.960]  the culture of just worrying about their safety all day until the point is
[10:22.960 --> 10:27.800]  nobody's safe because a nanny state can do nothing but make you domesticated a
[10:27.800 --> 10:40.760]  nanny state can do nothing except basically turn you into a sheep it's so
[10:40.760 --> 10:45.640]  simple and then we've got the other news up on info wars.com and prison
[10:45.640 --> 10:52.720]  planet.com a reports out Obama is an actor trained by Harry Linux this is a
[10:52.720 --> 10:58.080]  big deal this goes viral that Harry Linux is saying and it's on record they
[10:58.080 --> 11:05.960]  were friends for about 17 years and that they had done work together and they go
[11:05.960 --> 11:10.800]  to each other's houses and now he reportedly says Obama's horrible and is a rat
[11:10.800 --> 11:18.920]  that's another quote a rat and that Obama was trained by him to be
[11:18.920 --> 11:24.280]  presidential and then of course if you watch Harry Linux do an interview it's
[11:24.280 --> 11:31.320]  Obama the same cadence the same voice Obama is copying Linux or Linux is
[11:31.320 --> 11:37.160]  copying Obama it's like the same guy and I believe Linux over over Obama so that
[11:37.160 --> 11:44.240]  article and the source on that is up on info wars.com right now also again the
[11:44.240 --> 11:47.800]  Federal Reserve is planning to accelerate money printing congressman warns of
[11:47.800 --> 11:52.560]  Obama creating secret security force armed security force that's actually in
[11:52.560 --> 11:57.200]  the Obamacare bill and then the media is like he would never do that they've
[11:57.200 --> 12:00.960]  already set it up with mercenaries with top security clearances guarding federal
[12:00.960 --> 12:05.240]  buildings now and then the billions of bullets and all the training and the
[12:05.240 --> 12:10.840]  rest of it I mean this is just simply simply amazing and then some of the
[12:10.840 --> 12:18.600]  other news countdown US its debt ceiling in 84 days and again Obama said
[12:18.600 --> 12:22.440]  raising the debt does not raise the debt only not raising it that's the only
[12:22.440 --> 12:29.760]  thing that is financially irresponsible we have a bigger debt than we have
[12:29.760 --> 12:35.600]  yearly GDP we have a higher debt to savings ratio than Spain and Greece that
[12:35.600 --> 12:39.760]  are both completely bankrupt and their answer is get a steeper into debt why
[12:39.760 --> 12:44.160]  not the globalists want us impoverished and if Rand Paul wants to cut the
[12:44.160 --> 12:50.440]  defense budget he's a traitor and if Ted Cruz wants to cut some of the corporate
[12:50.440 --> 12:56.840]  welfare and entitlement welfare oh he's a horrible person you can't continue to
[12:56.840 --> 13:01.280]  do this and have 101 million people on food assistance and a hundred plus
[13:01.280 --> 13:05.240]  million people on government dole there's more people on the dole now than
[13:05.240 --> 13:09.920]  in the workforce let me say that again what about the people going bankrupt
[13:09.920 --> 13:15.280]  everywhere what about the people losing their houses well the folks that have
[13:15.280 --> 13:19.960]  been not working for five ten years they go I don't care tax the rich it's the
[13:19.960 --> 13:24.320]  ultra-rich lobbying for that against the middle class their historic enemy to
[13:24.320 --> 13:27.240]  bankrupt the country once they've done that you're all gonna have your
[13:27.240 --> 13:33.520]  welfare taken away here's an article China to ease one child policy that's
[13:33.520 --> 13:39.520]  because it's caused such a problem having upwards of what is it 60 70 more
[13:39.520 --> 13:46.480]  million men then they have women and it's causing all sorts of societal
[13:46.480 --> 13:51.960]  problems and India is about to outstrip them in population and they've ended the
[13:51.960 --> 13:57.040]  labor camps that's being reported by Reuters China unveils boldest reforms
[13:57.040 --> 14:01.680]  in decades shows that the new president is in command folks they don't need
[14:01.680 --> 14:06.040]  labor camps anymore because they call them jobs and you go in their suicide
[14:06.040 --> 14:10.440]  nets and they force drug you and forced abortion and you're basically locked up
[14:10.440 --> 14:16.920]  at night and they just don't call it labor camps and don't worry China is
[14:16.920 --> 14:21.560]  now on the UN Human Rights Board deciding what's human rights along with
[14:21.560 --> 14:26.440]  Cuba along with Cuba it's better Saudi Arabia is probably a bigger
[14:26.440 --> 14:31.920]  tyranny than China per capital donning worse as North Korea and I expect them
[14:31.920 --> 14:36.920]  to be made you know the head of the UN operations so that's just some of the
[14:36.920 --> 14:42.400]  news up on info wars dot com up on prison planet dot com EPA blocked cities
[14:42.400 --> 14:49.800]  from installing fire hydrants again the EPA shutting down over 500 power plants
[14:49.800 --> 14:53.640]  Bloomberg reports Philadelphia's 119 fire hydrants that cost about 2,000 each
[14:53.640 --> 14:59.360]  waiting in a warehouse to be installed yet they sit there in dry dock because
[14:59.360 --> 15:03.080]  federal regulators say their fittings might taint drinking water with lead
[15:03.080 --> 15:07.920]  at the last lead smelting plant in the US it's a very important metal for a lot
[15:07.920 --> 15:12.880]  of natural uses it's been shut down so you can't even get bullets but they
[15:12.880 --> 15:18.200]  allow lead in the food from China just no lead in food produced here and I'm
[15:18.200 --> 15:21.840]  talking microscopic amounts you can't have here you can just ship it in at
[15:21.840 --> 15:27.920]  thousands of times that again everything is meant to shut us down shut us down
[15:27.920 --> 15:31.440]  shut America down because remember the globalist they're all above the law
[15:31.440 --> 15:36.560]  they're all exempt this is what their neo feudalism is under a technological
[15:36.560 --> 15:41.640]  tyranny a technocracy and that leads us now to our guest will be with us for the
[15:41.640 --> 15:47.880]  balance of the hour and then the top former secret service agent he was the
[15:47.880 --> 15:52.400]  head of operations when when the president would go overseas Dan Bongino
[15:52.400 --> 15:57.200]  is going to join us a lot of key intel at the start of the next hour and then
[15:57.200 --> 16:01.400]  we'll take phone calls last 30 minutes or so I promise but Patrick Wood I was
[16:01.400 --> 16:05.960]  familiar with his writings and work from news with views comm and other places
[16:05.960 --> 16:13.160]  but I heard him for an hour on Dr. Stan Monteev a few nights ago and I've
[16:13.160 --> 16:19.400]  read the technotronic age I've read the Anglo-American establishment I've read
[16:19.400 --> 16:24.160]  Quigley's books I've read Brzezinski's books I've I read Council on Farm
[16:24.160 --> 16:28.280]  Relations publications and so I knew everything was saying was accurate but
[16:28.280 --> 16:31.640]  he knew stuff I didn't know I went looked it up and it was accurate so I
[16:31.640 --> 16:37.320]  wanted to get him on because he is an editor of a weekly financial analysis
[16:37.320 --> 16:41.840]  service findings and forecast he has studied elite globalization policies
[16:41.840 --> 16:45.240]  what you need to do to understand economics since the late 70s when he
[16:45.240 --> 16:49.880]  partnered with the late Anthony C Sutton who was a listener and been on the show
[16:49.880 --> 16:55.360]  to co-author trilaterals over Washington volumes 1 and 2 he remains a
[16:55.360 --> 16:59.440]  leading expert on the elitist trilateral Commission their policies and
[16:59.440 --> 17:03.080]  achievements in creating their self-proclaimed new international economic
[17:03.080 --> 17:06.400]  order he is also leading expert on historic and modern
[17:06.400 --> 17:12.360]  technocracy which plays a prominent role in current world affairs that says it
[17:12.360 --> 17:18.600]  you know lightly and economists by education a financial analyst and
[17:18.600 --> 17:23.280]  writer by profession and American constitutionalist by choice would holds
[17:23.280 --> 17:27.800]  a biblical worldview he has a deep historical insight in the modern
[17:27.800 --> 17:32.880]  attacks on sovereignty property rights and personal freedom such attacks are
[17:32.880 --> 17:40.520]  the epitome and by the implementation of UN policies such in 21 sustainable
[17:40.520 --> 17:44.360]  development smart growth in an education the widespread adoption of common core
[17:44.360 --> 17:48.440]  two plus two equals five his current research builds on trilateral Commission
[17:48.440 --> 17:54.720]  hegemony involving transhumanism technocracy and more and how these are
[17:54.720 --> 17:58.840]  co-opting economics politics and religion which together represent the
[17:58.840 --> 18:02.960]  major pillars of society yes they're taking over all sciences philosophies
[18:02.960 --> 18:06.520]  and re-engineering them and I appreciate him coming on we're gonna skip this
[18:06.520 --> 18:10.840]  network break because I'm behind such important intelligence so stations
[18:10.840 --> 18:13.680]  shouldn't be skipping this break it's a network break we're going to do this
[18:13.680 --> 18:19.880]  because it's his time is important August forecast comm is his site and he
[18:19.880 --> 18:24.320]  will be here frequently there's so many amazing minds out there that we just you
[18:24.320 --> 18:27.720]  know you just you just tend to forget in our rush and Anthony Sutton of course
[18:27.720 --> 18:32.000]  advised Congress discovered all the documents at the Ford Foundation and
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.960]  others with Patrick Wood it was a top congressional advisor on the plan to
[18:36.960 --> 18:40.800]  convert America to a tyranny how our government funded Stalin Lenin before
[18:40.800 --> 18:45.400]  him Hitler didn't didn't run them or control them built them just like
[18:45.400 --> 18:50.840]  Saddam and al-Qaeda and all of it and understand the scientific tyranny the
[18:50.840 --> 18:55.560]  application of dehumanization we give you probably one of the greatest living
[18:55.560 --> 18:59.240]  experts because I went and looked into him I'd seen his writings I was like I
[18:59.240 --> 19:02.240]  forgot about Patrick Wood why has he never been on the show he might have
[19:02.240 --> 19:05.080]  been on I might have forgot but I don't believe he's ever been with us and it's
[19:05.080 --> 19:08.760]  just so important a treasure trove the reason I'm building this up is you
[19:08.760 --> 19:12.760]  understand this is your world this is how it really runs these are the guys
[19:12.760 --> 19:16.920]  that in Congress got the documents and went to the Canadian archives and got
[19:16.920 --> 19:22.680]  the intel to put out the Intel and to post the documents on their websites I
[19:22.680 --> 19:25.920]  had setting on about 17 years ago and then I got ready to get him on a few
[19:25.920 --> 19:28.960]  years later and he said I'm sorry I'm too ill but I appreciate your work and
[19:28.960 --> 19:31.920]  he died like a week later I couldn't believe he's like on his deathbed was
[19:31.920 --> 19:36.160]  sending me emails back so I just really admire his work as well and we need to
[19:36.160 --> 19:39.600]  remember these men that have fought so hard Mr. Wood I know it's probably
[19:39.600 --> 19:44.520]  annoying having me gush over you but your intel is so vital to the preservation
[19:44.520 --> 19:49.880]  of human dignity well thank you Alex I appreciate the opportunity to get some
[19:49.880 --> 19:54.560]  of this information out I've been trying hard as you know and I always enjoy
[19:54.560 --> 19:59.960]  doing radio and TV interviews whenever I can well let's do this let's say you're
[19:59.960 --> 20:03.840]  talking to a new audience if you had five minutes on national TV which this
[20:03.840 --> 20:07.240]  basically is now three million people right now conservatively watching and
[20:07.240 --> 20:11.480]  listening how would you introduce it to layman because my listeners are very
[20:11.480 --> 20:16.200]  smart very informed but they always want to give stuff to their family and so
[20:16.200 --> 20:20.640]  they want it crystallized give us the basic overview and then get into the
[20:20.640 --> 20:26.200]  nuts and bolts of technocracy well it's really a you know it's a complex and a
[20:26.200 --> 20:32.320]  deep topic but basically the first idea is us the problems we've been having in
[20:32.320 --> 20:37.520]  the last 35 to 40 years especially have been economic in nature rather than
[20:37.520 --> 20:41.840]  political and there's a lot of emphasis in the public like in the tea parties
[20:41.840 --> 20:46.560]  and the conservative movement and even in liberal circles as well that the world
[20:46.560 --> 20:52.640]  revolves around politics that is arguing in Congress and you know fighting
[20:52.640 --> 20:57.280]  with the executive branch and so on and and my studies on the trilateral
[20:57.280 --> 21:03.120]  Commission have pretty much pointed out what I think with great detail that the
[21:03.120 --> 21:07.240]  takeover of America has been economic in nature and that was the nature
[21:07.240 --> 21:11.960]  originally of the trilateral Commission that was formed in 1973 by David
[21:11.960 --> 21:17.120]  Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski they they said frequently that they were
[21:17.120 --> 21:21.440]  going to create a new international economic order that they used that in
[21:21.440 --> 21:27.440]  every one of their early publications we didn't really know at the time exactly
[21:27.440 --> 21:30.640]  what that would look like but we had a pretty good idea for meeting the policies
[21:30.640 --> 21:38.200]  and they have managed over a period of now since 1973 some 35 plus years to
[21:38.200 --> 21:41.640]  create this new international economic order and if we look around this is what
[21:41.640 --> 21:45.880]  we see today Alex this is what's important to realize back then people
[21:45.880 --> 21:51.160]  criticized us for being conspiracy nuts today we have the force of history
[21:51.160 --> 21:56.000]  behind us which after a 25-year period of course becomes history we can now look
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.320]  back at history and see that what we said instead in the 1970s was exactly
[22:00.320 --> 22:04.880]  right this is exactly what they've done we know that the world system today is
[22:04.880 --> 22:11.760]  broken almost beyond repair and we have to put we have to put the finger where
[22:11.760 --> 22:17.080]  the finger belongs and it belongs with these this very small elite group of
[22:17.080 --> 22:20.720]  internationalists that were represented by the members of the
[22:20.720 --> 22:25.400]  Trilateral Commission back in 1973 and ever since I might add and they have
[22:25.400 --> 22:29.440]  influenced our government our executive branch of our government especially
[22:29.440 --> 22:36.520]  they have influenced our government to an extreme that has literally excluded
[22:36.520 --> 22:40.120]  the American people all together we have no control over Congress anymore I
[22:40.120 --> 22:44.880]  say it appears and the executive branch is just going to do what it wants to do
[22:44.880 --> 22:49.920]  so there's been a fundamental change in the political system on our country for
[22:49.920 --> 22:57.480]  sure but the political system was really just useful idiots for this elite
[22:57.480 --> 23:02.880]  group of economy changers if you will they had to use the political system to
[23:02.880 --> 23:09.680]  get what they wanted to do economically over these last years and so we see we
[23:09.680 --> 23:14.760]  see things like the North American Free Trade Agreement, DAFTA, CAFTA we say that
[23:14.760 --> 23:20.720]  we see the Trans-Pacific Partnership being negotiated right now that is
[23:20.720 --> 23:24.360]  hopefully not going to get put through on fast track but the administration is
[23:24.360 --> 23:30.760]  trying to get fast-track authority established again so you know this
[23:30.760 --> 23:40.760]  this hegemony has has continued from 1973 to the day hasn't let up nobody has
[23:40.760 --> 23:46.120]  identified these people behind the scenes nobody has even politicians will
[23:46.120 --> 23:50.560]  not read write about them or speak about them in fact I think you only live
[23:50.560 --> 23:54.640]  in politics or politician living or dead that I know that ever talked about the
[23:54.640 --> 23:59.560]  trial at our commission was Barry Goldwater when he wrote his memoirs
[23:59.560 --> 24:06.400]  with no apology back in 1979 so this group was not talked about these people
[24:06.400 --> 24:12.400]  not talked about we've been writing about them since 1977 really and
[24:12.400 --> 24:16.600]  nothing has changed that you know they're doing the same thing today they did
[24:16.600 --> 24:21.080]  back then I don't know how it's like a summer I do in a very short period of
[24:21.080 --> 24:25.120]  time Alex well you've done a great job in fact I'm going to pull up the Barry
[24:25.120 --> 24:29.520]  Goldwater quote with no apologies where he describes how it's an economic
[24:29.520 --> 24:34.440]  takeover we're designed to fight a Stalin a Hitler a Mal we see a fire an
[24:34.440 --> 24:38.520]  enemy but when it's corporate and regulatory and incremental and it
[24:38.520 --> 24:41.960]  creates a global group of less than a hundred corporations in Rockefeller's
[24:41.960 --> 24:47.120]  own words he was written New York Times articles bragging about it how they
[24:47.120 --> 24:52.200]  want centralized control and how they divide up the world US based companies
[24:52.200 --> 24:57.880]  get the toll roads in Spain Spain gets the toll roads over here it's where they
[24:57.880 --> 25:01.520]  divide up the world amongst themselves and then bring in a
[25:01.520 --> 25:06.920]  technocracy to be able to control the population scientifically where it's
[25:06.920 --> 25:10.880]  impossible to ever get out of it or even know what you're in and you've dumbed
[25:10.880 --> 25:14.960]  down the population so I want to walk down walk through what technocracy and
[25:14.960 --> 25:18.520]  the technotronic age is what they're doing with it because I mean as best I
[25:18.520 --> 25:26.880]  understand it it is the it is the Cecil Rhodes plan of 1900 and the
[25:26.880 --> 25:30.880]  British royalty and their empire that was in trouble they said we'll go
[25:30.880 --> 25:35.560]  corporate take down our flag but use corporate energy to still control these
[25:35.560 --> 25:40.040]  holdings that we once had like India and other places and at the same time
[25:40.040 --> 25:44.560]  we'll export this corporate plan and and and team up with other robber barons in
[25:44.560 --> 25:48.360]  the United States and Europe that's what Bilderberg later became but their
[25:48.360 --> 25:55.080]  philosophy comes out of eugenics and and Malthus and Galton and so it's basically
[25:55.080 --> 26:01.600]  eugenics scientifically deployed through a world government corporate system so
[26:01.600 --> 26:04.680]  it's very hard to fight I want to get your take on that in a moment but we did
[26:04.680 --> 26:09.360]  find the quote from no apologies with Barry Goldwater he says quote the
[26:09.360 --> 26:14.080]  trilateral Commission is an international is international again the
[26:14.080 --> 26:18.680]  trilateral Commission is international and is intended to be the vehicle for
[26:18.680 --> 26:22.400]  multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interest by
[26:22.400 --> 26:26.160]  seizing control of the political government of the United States the
[26:26.160 --> 26:29.720]  trilateral Commission represents a skillful coordinated effort to seize
[26:29.720 --> 26:34.320]  control and consolidate the four centers of power political monetary
[26:34.320 --> 26:39.440]  intellectual and ecclesiastical the churches from no apologies now let me
[26:39.440 --> 26:43.680]  break this down for folks and give you the floor America was pretty much the
[26:43.680 --> 26:48.720]  sole superpower by the end of World War two so the globalists had to create a
[26:48.720 --> 26:54.600]  fake bipolar world by giving weapons to the Soviets to then build them up to let
[26:54.600 --> 26:59.840]  us become a tyranny and then share in a backdoor globalist deal taking over
[26:59.840 --> 27:03.600]  different areas of the world in the name of fighting each other in full
[27:03.600 --> 27:08.640]  spectrum dominance then they ended that farce and then moved on to the new
[27:08.640 --> 27:12.480]  al-Qaeda threat which they actually ran to use that to take our liberty so I'm
[27:12.480 --> 27:17.120]  basically describing the main trait of technocracy is that it's totally amoral
[27:17.120 --> 27:22.760]  except for the eugenics based system that it doesn't even it uses everything as
[27:22.760 --> 27:27.040]  curl quickly said socialism fascism communism as long as it's command and
[27:27.040 --> 27:32.200]  control go ahead sir well the book the book brave new world by all the talks
[27:32.200 --> 27:37.440]  we refer to it in pretty much everywhere people talk about oh it's a
[27:37.440 --> 27:44.520]  brand new world that book was written in 1932 Alex and it was written by all
[27:44.520 --> 27:49.240]  the talks we looking straight into the face of technocracy that was a big
[27:49.240 --> 27:55.120]  movement back then I didn't discover the technocracy movement from the 1930s
[27:55.120 --> 27:59.520]  until a few years ago and when I did it peaked my interest so much I had to
[27:59.520 --> 28:04.560]  investigate and just you know go crazy looking for information to try and find
[28:04.560 --> 28:09.000]  out what they're all about it was a it was a huge movement back in those days
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.640]  had a big popularity a large popularity in Canada and especially in the West
[28:14.640 --> 28:19.400]  although it did pretty well to use as well but these these technocrats
[28:19.400 --> 28:25.600]  specified very carefully what they would do if they could replace capitalism they
[28:25.600 --> 28:29.560]  believed in the Great Depression that capitalism was dead unemployment lines
[28:29.560 --> 28:33.200]  were you know wrapping around blocks soup kitchens were you know focused
[28:33.200 --> 28:37.920]  serving people all day long and they believed that the that they could
[28:37.920 --> 28:42.760]  provide an economic system that would be better than capitalism it didn't get
[28:42.760 --> 28:50.320]  very far it kind of died out as a movement around 1938 to 40 but today it's
[28:50.320 --> 28:54.720]  had a resurgence if you will sure it's been adopted as the globalist management
[28:54.720 --> 28:58.880]  program it has now been adopted by the globalist management program and the
[28:58.880 --> 29:03.400]  reason I say this is important when we follow the money back in the 1930s the
[29:03.400 --> 29:08.120]  Rockefeller Carnegie crowd were dumping buckets of money onto the eugenics
[29:08.120 --> 29:12.720]  movement this is well known well documented they did not dump any money
[29:12.720 --> 29:17.520]  on the technocracy movement back down and so the technocracy movement kind of
[29:17.520 --> 29:22.680]  withered and died after a period of time however when Zbigniew Brzezinski
[29:22.680 --> 29:28.880]  resuscitated those ideas in 1970 with his book called between two ages America's
[29:28.880 --> 29:34.400]  role in the technocratic era that apparently caught Rockefeller's eye
[29:34.400 --> 29:39.160]  that's right Patrick Woods stay there will explain to David Rockefeller is a
[29:39.160 --> 29:44.200]  bigniew Brzezinski and more these two men you can say more than anybody now
[29:44.200 --> 29:51.200]  literally govern our civilization we'll be right back we're on the march the
[29:51.200 --> 30:01.400]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a little over a year
[30:01.400 --> 30:06.000]  ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size
[30:06.000 --> 30:09.960]  meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[30:09.960 --> 30:14.040]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[30:14.040 --> 30:18.320]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all
[30:18.320 --> 30:22.880]  of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[30:22.880 --> 30:27.280]  themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best

[33:45.720 --> 33:50.240]  he's talking about it because I've done the research I know it's true I watch
[33:50.240 --> 33:55.400]  David Rockefeller on c-span 50 something times I read their publications I know
[33:55.400 --> 34:02.320]  out of over 70 globalist organizations set up since the 30s he set up almost
[34:02.320 --> 34:09.040]  all of them or his dad did and he's like the omnibudsman of just all of the
[34:09.040 --> 34:14.240]  merger the whole plan and then he adopted technocracy and that's the
[34:14.240 --> 34:19.760]  cameras that's the systems that's the to apply that to eugenics and and if you
[34:19.760 --> 34:23.760]  wonder why New York Times endorses it while these elites endorse it the the
[34:23.760 --> 34:29.080]  venus project and its founder is part of the technocracy movement this is you
[34:29.080 --> 34:32.880]  live in a giant plastic concentration camp basically with it with a computer
[34:32.880 --> 34:37.840]  programmed by the elite the the megapolis controlling your life I mean I
[34:37.840 --> 34:40.960]  could not think of a more horrible fate we're gonna go back to our guests in a
[34:40.960 --> 34:45.440]  moment here's an example of technocracy okay bureaucracy as a science of
[34:45.440 --> 34:51.200]  control and notice the the elites the central bankers the last few years have
[34:51.200 --> 34:57.040]  been calling themselves and at Davos they go we're technocrats that's a
[34:57.040 --> 35:01.600]  bureaucrat with 1984 spy grids who has a eugenics philosophy but briefly look at
[35:01.600 --> 35:05.680]  this Harvard study confirms Florida reduces children's IQ out of 20 plus
[35:05.680 --> 35:10.840]  studies conducted excuse me 27 studies obviously 24 for some reason 27 studies
[35:10.840 --> 35:17.640]  over 24 22 years scientifically reviewed by Harvard Medical School and their top
[35:17.640 --> 35:23.600]  researchers and the National Research Council this is not some side group they
[35:23.600 --> 35:28.280]  said take fluoride out as a pesticide take it out of the water it is giving us
[35:28.280 --> 35:32.240]  massive cancer and dumbing us down it is you might as well have a chemical
[35:32.240 --> 35:36.640]  weapon it is a chemical weapon the Nazis got it from the Russians to put it in
[35:36.640 --> 35:42.240]  the water that's a Nuremberg trial now it's in the halogen family it's the bad
[35:42.240 --> 35:47.600]  halogen what is the good halogen that blocks it and removes it iodine but
[35:47.600 --> 35:51.480]  iodine if it's not the right type can be toxic that's why we produced the nation
[35:51.480 --> 35:57.760]  iodine the only proprietary type that's in the unbound base with the organic
[35:57.760 --> 36:02.960]  vegetable glycerin from Germany made in America but the corn from Germany only
[36:02.960 --> 36:07.320]  place you can get organic corn to make the glycerin very expensive the point is
[36:07.320 --> 36:11.840]  this is what I take it's incredible and yes I fund my operation with this with
[36:11.840 --> 36:15.520]  good products that's an example of technocracy oh the government before it
[36:15.520 --> 36:18.640]  was like this in the 20s said oh we're having all those retardation and
[36:18.640 --> 36:23.280]  problems put it in the salt oh IQs go up 15% here's that study business insider
[36:23.280 --> 36:29.480]  reports on it you see that's technocracy oh let's take it out and put the bad
[36:29.480 --> 36:33.920]  thing in then everybody will behave themselves well this product is available
[36:33.920 --> 36:40.880]  at infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139 and again this is why the
[36:40.880 --> 36:46.280]  people perish for lack of knowledge something so simple like that and look

[37:16.880 --> 37:20.960]  we've got the former top secret service agent coming on who made national
[37:20.960 --> 37:25.520]  headlines last week with our story from infowars.com on drudgereport.com where
[37:25.520 --> 37:29.240]  he said look it's worse than you know but he wouldn't go further than that I've
[37:29.240 --> 37:33.480]  talked to other secret service that say it's unbelievable we can't tell you I'm
[37:33.480 --> 37:37.280]  gonna see what I could squeeze out of him coming up in the start of the next
[37:37.280 --> 37:41.160]  hour but going back to Patrick Wood publisher he's an economist a renowned
[37:41.160 --> 37:45.140]  expose the trilaterals co-wrote the book trilaterals over Washington with the
[37:45.140 --> 37:49.300]  icon Anthony C Sutton who blew skull and bones wide open with Charlotte
[37:49.300 --> 37:53.000]  Isherby he joins us okay so get into we got up to
[37:53.000 --> 37:56.480]  Brzezinski who he is who David Rockefeller is tell us explain
[37:56.480 --> 38:00.800]  technocracy and then what's happening in our world Americans know not to like
[38:00.800 --> 38:05.800]  communism well explain what technocracy is communism by the elite by another
[38:05.800 --> 38:11.960]  name with them offshore exempt from it Patrick Wood break it down well when I
[38:11.960 --> 38:17.640]  discovered technocracy as a historical study a few years ago it really piqued my
[38:17.640 --> 38:21.760]  interest and I said I had to go and research it in depth and I made some
[38:21.760 --> 38:27.480]  you know several trips to secure original research on technocracy I found
[38:27.480 --> 38:32.200]  out that it had been skipped in the history books primarily because at the
[38:32.200 --> 38:37.560]  time in the 30s Randolph Hearst got so hacked off by being used by these people
[38:37.560 --> 38:43.120]  that he sent a memo out to all of his newspapers around the country and told
[38:43.120 --> 38:47.040]  them basically if you ever mentioned the word technocracy again you are fired
[38:47.040 --> 38:52.080]  and so there was no more articles on technocracy after that time really and
[38:52.080 --> 38:55.600]  so it was a little difficult going back to get his information but after I
[38:55.600 --> 39:01.480]  studied it enough it really occurred to me that I needed to go back and read the
[39:01.480 --> 39:07.040]  Big Knit Brzezinski book again in light of technocracy and what I found out was
[39:07.040 --> 39:11.200]  Alex is that his writings lined up philosophically and you know idea for
[39:11.200 --> 39:17.120]  idea sort of thing with the doctrine and dogma that was presented in the 1930s it
[39:17.120 --> 39:22.000]  was very radical back then in fact one prominent technocrat wrote a book a
[39:22.000 --> 39:27.320]  public book suggesting that president Roosevelt should should declare
[39:27.320 --> 39:32.480]  himself dictator after his election so that he could implement technocracy
[39:32.480 --> 39:38.040]  back then we can be thankful that he didn't take him up on that but life
[39:38.040 --> 39:41.600]  might be different today yeah but when I went back and read
[39:41.600 --> 39:48.480]  Brzezinski again I was shocked to realize that he was basically saying the
[39:48.480 --> 39:53.400]  same thing and here's what's kind of ironic or strange Brzezinski was at
[39:53.400 --> 39:59.600]  Columbia University at the time well in 1932
[39:59.600 --> 40:06.640]  technocracy as a movement was also housed in Columbia University even though
[40:06.640 --> 40:10.800]  the movement got kicked out all of the professors that were part of it stayed
[40:10.800 --> 40:14.960]  on at Columbia most of many of them died there in their positions you know
[40:14.960 --> 40:19.840]  retired and passed and so here's Brzezinski picking up the trail at the
[40:19.840 --> 40:25.360]  same university where it left off basically spouting the same dogma one
[40:25.360 --> 40:29.840]  phrase in particular from his book one quote I'd like to read it just because
[40:29.840 --> 40:35.360]  it will just stand your hair on end that Brzezinski understood this but even
[40:35.360 --> 40:41.360]  back in 6870 and I'll have to be the first to admit Brzezinski was a
[40:41.360 --> 40:46.320]  brilliant man I don't agree with him on anything he really did or said or wrote
[40:46.320 --> 40:51.920]  but you have to give him credit for being a brilliant guy he foresaw the
[40:51.920 --> 40:56.600]  future back then of course they went and manufactured the future after that but
[40:56.600 --> 41:02.280]  here's what he wrote the technotronic era and that technotronic by the way is
[41:02.280 --> 41:08.280]  a knockoff for the word technocratic so he quote again the technotronic era
[41:08.280 --> 41:15.000]  involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society such as society
[41:15.000 --> 41:21.080]  would be dominated by an elite unrestrained by traditional values soon
[41:21.080 --> 41:25.760]  it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every
[41:25.760 --> 41:31.600]  citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most
[41:31.600 --> 41:36.520]  personal information about the citizen these files will be subject to
[41:36.520 --> 41:42.560]  instantaneous retrieval by the authorities closed quote now I remember
[41:42.560 --> 41:47.120]  that book being on the bookshelf when I was a small child and by the time I was
[41:47.120 --> 41:51.880]  10 it was able to read good I tried to read it didn't understand it but I sat
[41:51.880 --> 41:57.120]  around the kitchen table hearing all this from my father growing up and that's
[41:57.120 --> 42:02.600]  the internet that's all of it it was all built and designed to be this grid so
[42:02.600 --> 42:08.480]  they've built a society to control us and that's the nanny state that's the
[42:08.480 --> 42:14.000]  close the green belt for no reason and control people set up checkpoints tell
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.680]  your kids they can't play tag say the state rules your kids this is putting a
[42:18.680 --> 42:22.920]  grid in the name of keeping a safe in that's actually a grid of tyranny and
[42:22.920 --> 42:28.920]  control well the it's interesting that the the the documents from the early
[42:28.920 --> 42:34.280]  1930s specified what needed to take place in order for technocracy to survive
[42:34.280 --> 42:40.920]  or to be a you know in implanted one of the things because technocracy was
[42:40.920 --> 42:46.360]  energy-based what one of the main tenets of their philosophy was that the price
[42:46.360 --> 42:50.840]  based economic system was going to be discarded that was capitalism of course
[42:50.840 --> 42:55.160]  and it was going to be substituted by a system of energy credits or energy
[42:55.160 --> 43:01.640]  currency that would be used to monitor all exchange of goods and services in
[43:01.640 --> 43:06.720]  the economy and a carbon-based currency we haven't seen that of course quite
[43:06.720 --> 43:11.600]  yet but we see the push for carbon based everything around the world this is
[43:11.600 --> 43:15.840]  what's sustainable the elements about this is what everything green is about
[43:15.840 --> 43:22.440]  this is what a jama 21 is about you get the idea it's everywhere today and in
[43:22.440 --> 43:26.280]  fact there there are actually articles out in the last five years that are
[43:26.280 --> 43:30.480]  there are openly discussing carbon currency but it's really a cut of it
[43:30.480 --> 43:34.240]  still in a minor that's right and in England they show the school kids a
[43:34.240 --> 43:38.080]  cartoon called megaopolis where the computer tells you when you can go
[43:38.080 --> 43:41.440]  outside it tells you when you can eat everyone has their job in the
[43:41.440 --> 43:46.840]  technocracy you're only allowed to have one child this is the plan so for
[43:46.840 --> 43:52.720]  folks out there it's fun to know about football and what size you know jock
[43:52.720 --> 43:55.440]  strap your favorite sports person wears for whatever reason I'm being
[43:55.440 --> 44:01.000]  sarcastic but but that doesn't matter that's a diversion you read these books
[44:01.000 --> 44:07.640]  written in the 1930s by Aldous Huxley whose brother was a eugenicist and went
[44:07.640 --> 44:11.760]  on to found the transhumanist movement head up the UN UNESCO program and
[44:11.760 --> 44:18.680]  agenda 21 and all of it that came out of the meeting in 92 you really see it's
[44:18.680 --> 44:25.400]  all the same control freak scientific dictatorship system under different
[44:25.400 --> 44:31.280]  names it's just that the brilliantly evil brazil's key who believes in things
[44:31.280 --> 44:38.000]  beyond good and evil foresaw the gestalt and got the real world manager David
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.440]  Rockefeller behind it because David Rockefeller if you had to say one guys
[44:42.440 --> 44:46.280]  king of the world you'd have to say it was David Rockefeller not so much now
[44:46.280 --> 44:50.280]  but he was the prime mover working 18 hours a day to bring this world
[44:50.280 --> 44:54.480]  government in and now his people are in place everywhere and he chose the
[44:54.480 --> 44:59.800]  brzezinski model on record and then he integrated it with eco science eugenicist
[44:59.800 --> 45:03.840]  model the injections and the additives the dumbest down it's all white our
[45:03.840 --> 45:07.960]  science are on record and you realize this is their military battle plan
[45:07.960 --> 45:13.840]  assaulting us and they think we're so dumb that we wouldn't get this and warn
[45:13.840 --> 45:16.840]  people and the elites comments to me when I've talked to some of the high-level
[45:16.840 --> 45:20.720]  people and I mean head of the Kissinger Group on record now there's off record is
[45:20.720 --> 45:25.360]  Alex the public can't even understand you you're one of us even if you don't
[45:25.360 --> 45:29.520]  know it and you're gonna grow up and see that I'm gonna grow up and see that and
[45:29.520 --> 45:32.280]  block development in the third world when that would actually reduce their
[45:32.280 --> 45:36.240]  population what you claim you want I've got to see that when you're busy
[45:36.240 --> 45:40.040]  funding al-qaeda to then blow stuff up to take my rights the point is they
[45:40.040 --> 45:44.480]  claim it's all scientific for the better good at the bottom of it is really an
[45:44.480 --> 45:48.360]  authoritarian lust for dehumanization and I want you to continue with your
[45:48.360 --> 45:53.560]  presentation and all these slides you sent us for the TV viewers but continuing
[45:53.560 --> 45:58.360]  to get into their plan studying them and working with the Sutton on their larger
[45:58.360 --> 46:03.440]  plan what what would you say the real philosophy was I mean and in just ten
[46:03.440 --> 46:08.520]  words or less I mean what is it neo feudalist just haters of humanity
[46:08.520 --> 46:14.480]  control freaks who are these people well they're driven by money they're driven
[46:14.480 --> 46:20.120]  by a lust for money they thought to create a new international economic order
[46:20.120 --> 46:26.760]  in 1973 I don't really think that game plan has changed is still an economic
[46:26.760 --> 46:30.720]  issue it's still about profits it's still about manipulation of the markets
[46:30.720 --> 46:35.840]  for their good they would press out competition and they have press out
[46:35.840 --> 46:42.560]  competition over the decades so it's still they're still looking to make as
[46:42.560 --> 46:47.040]  much money as they can they have little regard for the amount of money that you
[46:47.040 --> 46:52.240]  and I might make in fact the original model of technocracy from the 30s did
[46:52.240 --> 46:55.880]  away with private property all together we see this being picked up in a gen
[46:55.880 --> 47:01.080]  of 21 documents by the way that the property is out and well sure they want
[47:01.080 --> 47:05.600]  a post-industrial world they want to make us poor in their own words as a tool
[47:05.600 --> 47:10.640]  of control well essentially what they want is just all of our production Alex
[47:10.640 --> 47:16.280]  and if you go back to the feudal world the dark ages it was very dark and you
[47:16.280 --> 47:20.000]  look at people back then they were mostly farmers to grow in but they were
[47:20.000 --> 47:24.800]  productive they were able to grow things and the land yielded stuff it's just the
[47:24.800 --> 47:32.000]  lords of the land took 90% of everything that that they grew or the you know they
[47:32.000 --> 47:35.320]  the animals they bred they were like they were not allowed to keep anything
[47:35.320 --> 47:40.040]  except for just you know what they needed to stay alive and this is kind of
[47:40.040 --> 47:44.920]  where we're going they're still looking at getting the the output of our hands if
[47:44.920 --> 47:50.040]  you will the output of our production but they want it for themselves they
[47:50.040 --> 47:54.880]  don't want to share it back with us so even in the end that's still a very
[47:54.880 --> 48:01.440]  economic oriented you're right and they use our energy to build their little
[48:01.440 --> 48:05.520]  castles in the sky for their power trip so it's it's robbing our destiny
[48:05.520 --> 48:08.920]  continue with your presentation that's exactly right
[48:08.920 --> 48:14.320]  Zbigniew Przezky wrote in 1970 again in between two ages he and I quote this he
[48:14.320 --> 48:18.960]  said the nation state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life is seems to
[48:18.960 --> 48:23.840]  be the principle creative force international banks and multinational
[48:23.840 --> 48:28.600]  corporations are acting and planning the terms that are far in advance of the
[48:28.600 --> 48:34.920]  political concept of the nation state close quote that says a mouthful but
[48:34.920 --> 48:39.440]  this also has not changed this philosophy of this elite group has not
[48:39.440 --> 48:45.480]  changed since Brzezinski wrote that in 1970 and they believe that the nation
[48:45.480 --> 48:49.520]  state is basically just not compatible with reality and they're acting as if it
[48:49.520 --> 48:55.200]  did not exist so as they move move forward in the world and in China and
[48:55.200 --> 49:00.000]  Europe and of course in other India and other minor countries and especially in
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.880]  North America as they have moved forward we can see their fingerprints and their
[49:04.880 --> 49:09.360]  footprints all over the economic scene and they have used the political
[49:09.360 --> 49:14.080]  or co-opted the political mechanisms to achieve their new you know their new
[49:14.080 --> 49:19.720]  economic order pipe during well that's right instead of an economy based on
[49:19.720 --> 49:23.560]  whoever has the best innovations who's the most honorable it becomes who is the
[49:23.560 --> 49:28.240]  technocrats who is in control and in their tax exempt under globalism and
[49:28.240 --> 49:33.920]  have diplomatic immunity and we are just crushed by total surveillance which is
[49:33.920 --> 49:38.760]  their plan you know I would year old enough to remember some of the old
[49:38.760 --> 49:44.440]  green green green people from maybe the 60s and 70s with their long hair and so
[49:44.440 --> 49:49.040]  on if you can find a green under one of those original green people today and
[49:49.040 --> 49:53.320]  talk to them about the current state of the green movement you'll see him spitting
[49:53.320 --> 49:58.760]  molten nails because they believe that their movement was taken over by these
[49:58.760 --> 50:03.880]  people the Rockefeller crowd and so on they were given a lot of money then they
[50:03.880 --> 50:07.080]  were told after they had the money well you're not managing right we need to
[50:07.080 --> 50:10.800]  stand in our managers to manage your organization and basically the whole

[53:58.360 --> 54:23.640]  did turrets folks here's an example of how the propaganda is 24-7 I was in the
[54:23.640 --> 54:30.440]  coffee room this morning watching MSNBC monitoring of state-run media and they
[54:30.440 --> 54:33.440]  were promoting the end of the earth because of the torrent the hurricane
[54:33.440 --> 54:40.560]  or the typhoon that hit the Philippines and saying Al Gore was right we've got
[54:40.560 --> 54:46.880]  to do the carbon taxes that will save it and then just now during the break on
[54:46.880 --> 54:51.960]  CNN they're worshiping Ted Turner and his far-reaching impact was the headline
[54:51.960 --> 54:59.400]  and how he is saving of the earth I mean it's just never ending let us run the
[54:59.400 --> 55:06.200]  world we're saving you and then meanwhile Ted Turner David Rockefeller all of
[55:06.200 --> 55:11.000]  them are on record supporting an 80 plus percent population reduction we're
[55:11.000 --> 55:14.600]  joined by Patrick Wood he's sent us amazing documents today if you're a TV
[55:14.600 --> 55:19.240]  viewer we've been putting these documents and documentation and quotes up on
[55:19.240 --> 55:23.200]  screen we've got until five after next hour then we've got the famous Secret
[55:23.200 --> 55:27.680]  Service agent joining us with Inside Intel but Patrick in the time we've got
[55:27.680 --> 55:33.560]  left in this segment the next I want to have you back very soon get into their
[55:33.560 --> 55:39.200]  philosophy eugenics how it ties into the older globalist plans and all the other
[55:39.200 --> 55:41.520]  key points that people need to know about
[55:41.520 --> 55:47.720]  technocracy the system that we're going under right now well we haven't really
[55:47.720 --> 55:53.760]  broached the subject of transhumanism and I don't know that we have time to do
[55:53.760 --> 55:58.600]  that but start getting into it the Rockefeller crowd back in the 30s that
[55:58.600 --> 56:05.760]  well the 1920s and 30s poured a lot of money into the eugenics movement and it
[56:05.760 --> 56:10.120]  was very big movement back then it's kind of been buried especially buried
[56:10.120 --> 56:16.520]  since World War two with with Nazi Germany's experience with eugenics kind
[56:16.520 --> 56:20.320]  of been a taboo topic and hasn't been discussed much but they call it
[56:20.320 --> 56:25.080]  implementation by stealth that's their official policy well it is now for sure
[56:25.080 --> 56:29.600]  and back then though since there wasn't a lot of money poured on it on top of
[56:29.600 --> 56:36.400]  technocracy incorporated eugenics was not really part of their agenda not
[56:36.400 --> 56:41.120]  directly in any case some of their members were were obviously influenced
[56:41.120 --> 56:45.600]  by the genetics by the eugenics movement back then but that was not really an
[56:45.600 --> 56:52.880]  official part of their platform if you will they were very economic in nature
[56:52.880 --> 56:58.080]  they were they were focused on creating an economy that would be balanced that
[56:58.080 --> 57:03.200]  would be free of poverty exactly but David Rockefeller wants to use it to
[57:03.200 --> 57:07.560]  carry out eugenics he wants a computerized weaponized system to
[57:07.560 --> 57:13.720]  dehumanize well yes we could we could see the dovetail in modern times where
[57:13.720 --> 57:19.440]  where eugenics is an as an undercurrent this starting to you know kind of come
[57:19.440 --> 57:23.640]  back to the surface in this transhumanism really brings this out
[57:23.640 --> 57:28.840]  transhumanism and technocracy are like stymies twins joined at the hip if you
[57:28.840 --> 57:33.040]  will they're both based on scientism the philosophy of scientism and
[57:33.040 --> 57:38.680]  transhumanism basically sets up a society of the house and the had nots
[57:38.680 --> 57:45.240]  again based on genetic modification and so those who were genetically enhanced
[57:45.240 --> 57:50.680]  if you will will be the haves and the the rest of the people who are not
[57:50.680 --> 57:55.400]  genetically enhanced maybe they won't be as smart maybe they won't be as strong
[57:55.400 --> 58:02.160]  or athletic or whatever they will be the have nots and you know basically will
[58:02.160 --> 58:06.400]  end up with the eugenics system that can be controlled by push button rather
[58:06.400 --> 58:11.320]  than by edict as it was during Nazi Germany and then people will beg to be
[58:11.320 --> 58:14.640]  enslaved by the new genetic modifications in the toxic environment
[58:14.640 --> 58:18.360]  when it's really a Trojan horseback door of control that's how they always
[58:18.360 --> 58:22.440]  tell it absolutely on target with your research and of course as you said
[58:22.440 --> 58:26.920]  Puxley was one of these transhumanists before it even had the term and his
[58:26.920 --> 58:30.800]  brother founded that movement when eugenics was given a bad name on record
[58:30.800 --> 58:33.400]  we're gonna come back in 60 seconds give you five more minutes to get to other
[58:33.400 --> 58:37.120]  tidbits we'll definitely have to have you back in the near future third hour

[58:49.600 --> 58:55.040]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and
[58:55.040 --> 59:00.280]  replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around
[59:00.280 --> 59:04.400]  the world guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and
[59:04.400 --> 59:09.040]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[59:09.040 --> 59:14.440]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[59:14.440 --> 59:20.160]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ
[59:20.160 --> 59:24.440]  increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line

[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:40.440]  amazing Patrick Wood I tell you next time I'm out of town because then it is
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:44.720]  exciting so much I won't shut up but I'm adding important info and like David
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.320]  Knight does the show he's a smart engineer knows about this stuff you
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:53.880]  ought to have wood on for like two hours so the next time I'm out of town or the
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:56.800]  next time I'm not doing the show and I have night doing it I want to get wood
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.560]  on for two hours Patrick what have we not covered today that people need to
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.200]  know about I think it's important that suddenly the globalist the new term they
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.920]  use is technocrat I mean they're really trying to make that sexy and you know it's
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.200]  not surveillance that they watch everything we do they're watching it to
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.520]  make the economy better but really they're just giving it to the insiders
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:20.880]  well you know the spooky thing is let me read you to the official requirements
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.880]  from the 1932 document called technocracy study course that was their
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:30.720]  kind of their Bible of the day one said quote provide a specific registration of
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:35.040]  the type kind of center of all goods and services were produced to where used the
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.960]  next one says provide specific registration of the consumption of each
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:44.960]  individual plus a record and description of the individual and Alex this is
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:49.760]  exactly what the total surveillance society is doing to us right now they're
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.840]  collecting all of the financial records as well as any other profile or
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:58.160]  psychographic information they can get so they can slice the stendysis
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:02.080]  economically if you will and put us in you know maybe the pigeonhole is
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:05.960]  politically as well that you know there are threats to their system but this is
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:13.480]  an economic movement to try and extract the maximum amount possible from
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:19.000]  individual consumers it's very consumer centric but everything is focused on
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.440]  collecting this information to make this system work this is the last piece
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:29.320]  according to the original documents of technocracy that needs to be put in
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:36.240]  place before technocracy can actually be enforced and that's why I'm really
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:41.240]  concerned today about this total awareness society business because when
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.920]  they get this in place completely somewhere in knowledge is power of course
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:50.640]  there's gonna come a time when they can flip the switch and basically say we're
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:55.080]  now in control and now you will do what we say that's right it's a total
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:58.480]  military takeover the smart meters controlling how hot or cold our house
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.520]  is the satellite's not letting us cut a tiny tree in our backyard just
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.320]  absolute bureaucratic hell and then the robots get rid of the regular jobs and
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:11.040]  the farming so literally like a Kurt Vonnegut book their plan is to have a
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.840]  third of the population as enforcers and they're gonna hire the people they
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:19.640]  poisoned through the eugenics operation to literally rule over those of us that
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.840]  were informed so it's not even the eugenics that they've claimed their
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:27.160]  building if somebody wanted really to feed the world what they needed what we
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:32.880]  need to do is increase the CO2 content the atmosphere by 10% that's right it
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:37.160]  would feed the world in a heartbeat but when you take CO2 out plants can't grow
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:45.280]  crops can't prop can't thrive and people start I would endorse a real open
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:51.000]  market free open source technocracy that empowered and had us go to Alphaston
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.040]  turries but this this this technocracy is a bunch of bean counting
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.680]  communists adopted by Robert Barron eugenicist that openly are using it as
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:03.760]  a weapons system and so we've got to point out technocracy is what's
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:09.000]  delivering the poverty it's the enemy it is the enemy and the people who have
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.840]  brought us technocracy are the enemy as well I wouldn't really lay the blame
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:18.560]  necessarily at the feet of congressmen and senators but you know because they
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:23.880]  mostly been useful idiots and not really knowing what they're doing but if we
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.320]  look behind it to these people who have brought us technocracy this is where the
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:32.440]  trouble is and if we don't get rid of those people and get them out of our
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:38.520]  government system and get them off our back they will not be stopped and we
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:44.000]  will never be satisfied you know how much water can use these out of a sponge
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.360]  this is what they're doing to us and the only way to get more water out of the
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:52.440]  sponge is to ring it harder and that's right that's the plan Patrick Wood
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.400]  August forecast.com we're gonna be talking to you soon folks can find your
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:00.080]  great work right there thank you so much sir thank you

[01:08:54.840 --> 01:09:01.240]  radio listeners can go to info wars.com our prison planet.com former MSNBC
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:09.200]  host health plan source 350% thanks to Obamacare and he tweeted out I bought a
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:15.440]  catastrophic health policy for $107 a month when I left MSNBC Obamacare
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:22.560]  canceled the policy new rates $600 a month thanks Mr. President and then he
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:28.560]  should feel good some folks are having 500 600% increases so there you go
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:34.560]  affordable care act the joke is is on all of us and I want to replay his quote
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.880]  meltdown where he said we have a corrupt government it's evil they've all
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:41.240]  got to be removed America's in deep trouble and they fired him basically
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:44.480]  forced him out of that remember that how long ago was that it was like a year
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:51.280]  ago time just flies six months I don't remember about six months ago I mean he
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:55.080]  just said what was true like that's crazy there's on an out of control
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.880]  political class you're fired doesn't matter if you had some of the highest
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:03.800]  ratings in that area for that station that has no ratings I mean it's just
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:09.000]  it's like if you don't commit to evil you get purged if you don't commit to
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:15.440]  insanity you get removed now Michael Maloof joins us with some just amazing
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.200]  research we're so thankful you come on currently as a senior staff writer for

[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:27.480]  analysis former senior security policy analyst the office of the secretary
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:32.200]  defense Maloof is almost 30 years of federal service 23 years of which was
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:37.280]  the US Defense Department if I go over all of his military Defense Department
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:41.600]  history we'll never be able to get to him so we're just gonna tell you that he's
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:47.320]  also a best-selling author Maloof's recent book a nation forsaken EMP the
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:50.720]  escalating threat of American catastrophe published for worldnetdaily
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:58.720]  available at WND.com and he joins us he joins us right now to talk about
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.560]  something that we've been covering the last two years in fact we've been right
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:12.000]  at the forefront as worldnetdaily has been and others have been getting into
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.880]  the fact that Obama is radically as he promised to do transforming America in
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:21.480]  the regulatory positions the military positions in the judgeships everywhere
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:32.760]  really putting hardcore Marxist worshippers of Lenin Mao socialist eugenistist I mean
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:37.560]  this is scary so it doesn't matter when Obama leaves we've got a crew of really
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:41.360]  dangerous people in there who fundamentally hate this country on record
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:46.400]  Obama went to Reverend Wright's church 21 years was like a Ku Klux Klan meeting
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:49.440]  house for black folks but say he never really heard the sermons this is pure
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:52.800]  bull and of course he's a front man for the globalist but the point is they're
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:57.960]  using this radical Marxist ideology as the shock troops to take over well that
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:02.440]  the insider we have on right now Michael Maloof he has talked to all these major
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:06.840]  generals you name it regular generals the list goes on and on who've confirmed
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:12.000]  what our Navy SEAL sources have said on record and off record what our military
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.680]  police sources have said what Fort Hood styopsis told us that we've confirmed
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:20.720]  they give us good intel over and over again these are good men I've met them and
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:26.120]  there is a total purge of litmus test will you confiscate guns now this is a
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:31.000]  list of tests on other issues as well but we've got mr. Maloof on with us
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.680]  right now his articles at worldnetdaily.com and we linked to him on
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:41.520]  info wars.com here's Alan West a congress must probe military firings I
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.440]  agree with that but say that for months general blames night stalker for
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:50.600]  military purge he's got general Boykin all of them going public congressional
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:55.000]  medal of honor winners going public major generals you name it and so he
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.480]  joins us sir thank you so much please please break down from your high level
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:04.720]  sources as much as you can tell us well thanks for having me thank you number one
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:10.960]  there seems to be something permeating not only at the high ranks but but now
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:16.400]  it's it's coming down to the mid levels and even and even mid-level officers and
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:23.720]  even into the listed ranks there's if you disagree with the president's or the
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:29.760]  administration's policy you you are basically set aside and your career is
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:33.680]  basically ended and this seems to be catching on more and more now there are
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:38.520]  as as congressman west mentioned to me there are some zipper issues that have
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:44.800]  occurred even among the higher ranks but but but as general Boykin told me this
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:49.280]  is unprecedented to have so many flag officers so many four-star generals
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.400]  removed in such a short period of time when we're talking about nine general
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:59.960]  officers just in one year he removed some the previous years now some the some
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:05.360]  of the other presidents bush and removed a few a few generals because they
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:10.840]  disagreed with his policy on Iraq but it wasn't at the scale that we're seeing
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:15.120]  in the Obama administration today in fact sir I've seen defensively cardicles
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:19.600]  and I've seen your articles it break it out it's 200 or more this has never
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:24.080]  happened no in in in US history and it's and it's not like it's a downsizing
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:28.040]  this is this is political persecution can you tell us what the generals have
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:34.680]  told you the litmus test are well they some of the litmus tests include if you
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:41.120]  speak out against radical Islam like Lieutenant Colonel Dooley that this was
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:44.960]  and then general Dempsey who's our who's the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:50.160]  Staff actually ridiculed do little for doing that but this was an instructor
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:55.240]  who was talking about radical Islam in a classroom and an approved class and yet
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:04.320]  he's out and and so it's and we've had some other officers and and even listed
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:08.600]  personnel saying that they get more training in sexual harassment than they
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:13.720]  do in firing their weapons well that was my next point we have Fort Hood leaking
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.720]  two weeks ago that Fox confirmed it the Secretary of the Army as you know in
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:19.560]  public they were saying if you're evangelical or give money to the Tea
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:24.360]  Party we will court-martial you that is unprecedented and then bad-mouthing the
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:29.600]  founding fathers and Army manuals I mean this is absurdist yeah this is the
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:34.040]  jet the generals have been quite vocal that if you're not speaking the
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:39.440]  administration outlook on things that you're you're basically going to be
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:43.640]  a railroaded out now they generally the generals and the and the and military
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:47.440]  personnel generally cannot speak out against commander-in-chief while they're
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:52.960]  on active duty or and but exactly sir so you're the expert on this from when
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:57.120]  I've read these guys really aren't even bucking things they just know their
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:01.280]  patriots so they must be spying on them or have intelligence files on them well
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:07.560]  as I think general Valali told me they they've actually got to have the senior
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:13.040]  officers who are acting almost like communist political commissars that's
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:20.120]  right who are looking out for anyone who expresses opposition or even
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:26.200]  questions a policy determination and and you can't and they and the troops
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:32.440]  believe that their first amendment rights now are being dismissed as a
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:35.800]  consequence yes sir mr. Maloof if you tell somebody you can't give money to
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.960]  evangelicals or the Tea Party that is a trillion times over the top I mean that's
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:46.320]  that that's like Soviet level yep well that's why general Valali said it was
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:53.480]  like communist commissars this is the way things are going there the enlisted
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:58.480]  men and even the mid-level officers are trying to watch their six constantly
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:02.440]  now because they don't know if they say something that's out of line they don't
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:06.680]  know if this is the end of their career oftentimes are not told anything nothing
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:10.360]  it's just that they just don't get promoted and they get set aside and if
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:14.480]  you don't get promoted after a certain period of time you're out now you talk
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:20.880]  about the big issue here the morale they've got to know persecuting Christians
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:23.640]  saying you came and give money the Tea Party Violet in the First Amendment I
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.880]  mean they've got to know that's going to kill morale trying to put women in
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:32.000]  frontline combat yes but there are three elements here that that are really
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.480]  sticking in the crawl of a lot of the military personnel that is the one would
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:45.480]  be gazing in the same foxholes women in the foxholes as well as the rules of
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:52.200]  engagement rules of engagement that are really a demoralizing factor and as a
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.440]  consequence a lot of number of our troops have actually gotten killed
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:02.320]  because we couldn't respond in the firefight and constant and or there
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.840]  there might be there could be the possibility of civilians and so we are
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:10.480]  troops that have to stand down there have been instances of this time and again
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:16.120]  in in especially in Afghanistan and it's actually gotten some of our troops
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:19.440]  killed but then meanwhile that's when it's a group they want to protect
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.480]  meanwhile from what I've heard from my sources was really freaking the military
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:27.480]  out is that they're now actually having to go to Iraq and Jordan and actually
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:32.200]  train Al Qaeda and these guys are on the record on the on foreign news bragging
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:36.600]  that they literally insult on the basis I'm surprised they don't get killed these
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:41.320]  special warfare people and say I killed you dirty Americans just five years ago
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:45.200]  in Iraq and when I'm done with the sod I'm going to kill you that has got
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:49.720]  special warfare literally literally freaking out because as you know
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:52.960]  committing suicide because they're being told to train Al Qaeda what can you
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:57.800]  say about that well the problem is that we're seeing increasing numbers of
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:01.720]  these guys who are who are our friends today but I'm going to turn on us
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:06.840]  tomorrow just like we train the Mujahideen and actually help create the
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:11.840]  Mujahideen against it then Soviet Union and Afghanistan and now it's become our
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:16.440]  worst enemy and sure I've been asking the questions people we've had that guys
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:23.280]  shot by you know green on blue and it's been some very recent cases of this
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:27.400]  yes sir you're the expert on this with your sources I mean you've got
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:31.640]  Congressional Medal of Honor winners retired major generals I mean just an
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:35.720]  incredible list talking to you and really not to anybody else why have they
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:39.080]  come to you a and then be I've been asking the questions I want to give you
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:42.480]  the floor the next 10 minutes sir give us a presentation on what you think is
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:47.440]  most important what people need to know and what this is going to do to US force
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.960]  structure with China and the rest of it literally turning into something like a
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:57.560]  Marxist college I mean that's going to destroy the military yeah I feel the
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:02.560]  generals told me I reached out to them and some of them have been somewhat
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:06.800]  outspoken on this but when you actually confront them and get them to think about
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:12.520]  it they see a much larger problem here that's emerging and it's permeating
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:16.520]  throughout the ranks it's just not a few and they're seeing some of these
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:22.320]  firings as being politically motivated for example the three generals that got
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:28.400]  canned right on the eve of right after Benghazi the concern is is that they're
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:32.960]  using they were using the firings to deflect attention from this ongoing
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:38.560]  investigation on Benghazi which is far from resolved and as a consequence there
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:44.880]  there seems to be the notion of trying to hide things we've had some CIA officers
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:48.680]  actually told if you go up and testify you're going to be removed from your
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:54.720]  jobs so the intimidation is somewhat happening in the intelligence world but
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:00.440]  it's also much more it's easier in the military world because these guys have
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:08.440]  to salute take orders and shut up and but but the over the overarching picture
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:15.880]  is that it's having a fundamental problem of emasculating the troops it I've
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:22.320]  had general Valali and even general Brady tell me that our readiness is being
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:27.520]  affected as a consequence of this our troops our troop structures being cut
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:33.200]  back tremendously they're using age old equipment our ships we were down to
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:39.080]  about a third of the size of what of what our Navy was in terms of our
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:46.080]  capital ships at the time so there's there's a complete emasculation of our
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:51.320]  military forces across the board and this is becoming a very very serious
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:55.840]  problem in terms of readiness and I think this is what is really a concern
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:03.800]  to the to the upper brass well again if you just joined us we have a gentleman
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:08.200]  who advised the Pentagon on national security at the highest levels for a
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:12.040]  long time in the office of the Secretary of Defense Michael Maloof he's got his
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:16.000]  new book out where we're talking about that some briefly here in a minute look
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.520]  here's my issue okay I'm known as this radical libertarian guy that you know is
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:24.400]  so out there now I'm not known as that because it's all coming true I wish I'd
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:28.000]  been proven wrong I would love to like not work this hard not be in this much
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  danger with these people with the threats and the and the socialist
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.800]  harassment all of it but I mean it does get to a point where I can't even
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:41.760]  believe this that that we have the the training manual and the threats saying
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:45.840]  the founding fathers quote wouldn't be accepted in today's military I mean I
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:50.600]  can't even believe it's that over the top and then we have them saying if you
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:54.520]  are part of the Tea Party and give them money that's aiding a terrorist and we're
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:58.800]  gonna use stuff that's used on al-Qaeda if you're funding radical Islam and
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:02.680]  we're going to arrest you actually said you may be court-martialed they I mean
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:07.280]  that is the that is so over the top and then meanwhile there is radical Islam
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.720]  and I'm not some as they call it Islamophobe but I know there are those
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:16.040]  major radical elements that that that Obama is totally cozying up to so let
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:20.040]  me ask you this question from your inside sources and overall full spectrum
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:25.760]  analysis of this what is the strategy backing radical Islam trying to
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:29.160]  overthrow the military well I'm not a total fan of what they're better now
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:34.280]  al-Qaeda 10 times better in places like Egypt getting rid of qaddafi putting in
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:39.760]  al-Qaeda trying to get rid of Assad put in the crazies I mean what is the grand
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:45.880]  strategy I'm here well there seems to be part of part of it I think has to do
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:51.160]  with a traditional type of alliance that we have basically with the Saudis
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:58.080]  the Saudis have been big the biggest exporters of Bahá'í Sunni
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:04.520]  Wahhabism for years and of course they for the creation of a lot of the
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:10.560]  Islamist radicals I mean you have Prince Bandar now who is well you might not
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:19.120]  agree with the government of Bashar al-Assad but in Syria he is a major
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:23.640]  backer and financier of the foreign fighters that are going in there he's
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:28.680]  also and also the Chechens he told Putin that he can turn on and off the
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:33.240]  switch I think a lot of this has to do with our traditional ties and and the
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:39.400]  fact that that we we that the United that that Obama now has begun to show a
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:46.120]  little bit of a tilt toward Iran that has even incensed the Saudis even even
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:52.600]  more and they're actually increasing a lot of the the spread of the Islamist
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:25:00.720]  radical fighters so you now today see them not only waiting for the United
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:05.880]  States to leave Afghanistan and then and opening up which will then allow these
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:11.320]  radicals to come back into the Central Asia into the Caucasus but also into the
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:15.680]  Arabian Peninsula and then then you swing around into Somalia and North
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:21.520]  Africa and into the Maghreb there is a pattern of behavior of these of these
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:26.800]  radical Islamists and a lot of this it's actually beyond our control today and
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:33.080]  with the decimation of our own military and the fact that we we are not that
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:38.040]  that this radical Islamic movements are actually increasing and not diminishing
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:42.360]  because of all the work we did in Iraq and Afghanistan we really have a real
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:45.960]  problem on our hands and we should not be diminishing the military we should
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:50.960]  perhaps be restructuring it to somewhat to increase more special forces and what
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:55.080]  I agree well sir I was about to say I mean I'm not a military man like
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.920]  yourself for a long time inside of the Defense Department but I've made a
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:01.640]  study of just history it's so interesting I mean I look at where America is
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:06.280]  right now and if I wanted to destroy America even mid-term I would do what
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:10.120]  Obama's doing I've got to admit he's probably now ten times worse than I
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:15.360]  thought it would be I mean this this this just at a gut level I look at all
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:19.040]  the different strategies and strategy them and gambits that are going on and
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:26.160]  and and and clearly I see US interest now turning Al Qaeda loose in the in the
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:30.920]  in the red crescent around Russia threatening China and I'm not a fan of
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:37.800]  what China is doing I'm an American but I see almost a setup against America to
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:42.320]  put us into wars we can't win with infiltration in the military to destroy
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:45.400]  it and I've always been somebody who's more libertarian like Rand Paul I say
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:51.000]  cut it but now I get what you're saying is that there's I mean I for the first
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.040]  time ever I know the whole CFR elite and stuff for globalist but I mean are
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:58.800]  they really crazy enough to try to really destroy American credibility and
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:03.320]  and get rid of us and maybe just sell out to the communist Chinese or something
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:08.320]  I mean I just look at it and everything points towards sell out America and the
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:12.760]  globalist have power through America I've criticized that strategy I don't
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:17.000]  like being that that corrupt imp but this is really bad yeah well we're
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:22.920]  seeing it now as we try to deploy and do that pivot to East Asia yes we just
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:27.240]  don't have the Navy to deal with that on a full-time basis and try to live up
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:32.200]  to commitments elsewhere and and when you have a diminished naval
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:36.920]  naval force it's gonna make it even much more difficult and we're gonna have
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:41.400]  people who just gonna leave the military the fact to get back here to a
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:46.280]  second to the to the purge of our own military the fact that they're now
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:50.400]  easing out the captain than the majors the people who have actually been
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:55.840]  fighting the wars and and they're now leaving then who do we have who has
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:00.120]  had that battlefield experience sabotage as they get on up to the upper
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:05.960]  ranks it's gonna be it's gonna be very very serious problem as in the
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:10.600]  years to come in keeping a very strong military and I think that this is what
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:14.280]  alarming the generals at to a great extent and this is gonna have a this is
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:17.960]  gonna have a bearing on our force structure and our and our ability to
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:21.400]  project power in the future and and look out for our interest that we have all
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:24.120]  around the world now these other countries that you mentioned Russia and
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:28.760]  and China now it's intriguing that that they they they too have a Wahhabi
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:34.160]  problem they have a Sunni radical Islamist problem themselves within the
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:37.720]  Caucasus and in the North Caucasus area the Russians are very fearful that
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:42.400]  these Sunnis are going to be creating havoc on the time of the February 2014
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.880]  winter Olympics in Sochi and and and this is where Bandar came in he actually
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:51.940]  said Mr. Putin if you change your policies toward toward Syria and
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:56.040]  Iran that I can assure you you will not be attacked during the during the
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:59.360]  Olympics fight and I saw that in the Russian news and Bandar didn't deny it
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:03.560]  nope I mean why is Saudi Arabia so arrogant to threaten a nuclear superpower
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:09.200]  yes well they did the fact that that Bandar has this capability this outreach
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:14.320]  I mean he is running he doesn't want to become king of Saudi Arabia when the
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:19.080]  one king of Dulladies but this is his power base this is his he wants to be
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:23.000]  able to show that he is able to project this kind of capability in this power
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.400]  that's why he's basically taken a much more independent line from the United
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:29.960]  States and we see that now and he sounds like Napoleon intriguing Michael
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:32.600]  Maloufstar guests do five more minutes with us I want you to be able to finish
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:35.600]  up in the talk about your book and I want to ask you about solutions how do we
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:39.200]  get out of this on the other side of Michael Malouf man this is intriguing
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:43.880]  this guy really knows his geopolitics because I study it constantly and I'm
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:47.080]  learning something right now so that says something we'll be right back with

[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:33.160]  American Empire then I realized that the American Empire in its death row she's
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:38.880]  like trying to start World War three while undermining the military with all
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:44.920]  the weirds to still is anti-male stuff that goes on there's always been gay
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:49.120]  people in the military folks they don't want anybody that's the best was touch
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:53.520]  full stuff running around stirring up trouble military fires more people over
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:58.000]  officers with women under them they're they're really if they're trying to do
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.040]  a mission you don't want guys with all the women under them I run an operation
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.280]  with women that work here I don't need a bunch of stuff going on here with
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:09.000]  people I go don't fraternize with with people here even though it's tempting and
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:14.520]  and and now it's like you're gonna be in with men that are like coming after you
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:18.880]  I mean it's it's crazy so you don't put women in those combat units where people
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.600]  are but but I'm I'm ranting and I'll do that after he leaves Michael Maloof best
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:27.200]  selling author is with us former top Pentagon analyst and the office of
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:31.600]  Secretary of Defense World Lent daily senior writer I asked you during the
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:34.480]  break the question and I'll say it for the audience right now give me the best
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:37.440]  answer you can get because I've not seen anybody I know some of these generals
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:40.560]  are public some haven't been so public you've got quite a list you're
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:45.800]  interviewing so you're you're in there because they trust you my intel from some
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:49.600]  of these very people but they won't say it on air is that no Obama is looking to
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:54.280]  use DHS as the fifth arm to take over Marine Corps colonels gone public and
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:58.960]  others have but that's about as high as they've gone public Navy SEALs on record
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:03.960]  have gone public to Obama may actually think about staging some crisis or
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:07.480]  letting Al Qaeda attack us and claiming the Tea Party's with them even though it
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:11.120]  makes no sense the State Department has been putting stuff out like that so as
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:15.680]  West Point and and trying to go after the American people they're training to
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:21.400]  take the guns and and even though they can't succeed the mission the the the
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:27.480]  the the experience the voyage is the destination that they want to start some
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:32.480]  civil war in America and that's what I'm getting from high-level military
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:38.600]  forces have they said anything on or off record do you like that a and b what
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:42.840]  are they saying the destination is what is Obama and his controllers what are
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:47.000]  they trying to do well I think he's trying to change the fundamental approach
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:54.040]  with his very liberal approach toward trying to make the military a social
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:59.040]  experiment and and trying he's never been a fan of the military anyway I mean
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:03.640]  he was a he was a community organizer and then he becomes president there's
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:09.280]  there's no he has no experience no background but what about it I don't
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:12.960]  mean interrupt her but what about his advisors if you wanted to kill the
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:17.760]  military this is what you do why isn't the establishment stopping him well
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:20.560]  the establishment scared to death because they're going to be out I mean
[01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:26.480]  this is why one of my stories had to do with Valerie Jarrett she's she's the
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:31.960]  she's what we call the night stalker and she's she's one who guides and
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:37.240]  counsels him she's very leftist leaning and and has roots that go back to
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:42.880]  communist socialist practices that in at the local level in Chicago we many many
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:47.040]  years before this is and now they just brought it up to the national level and
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:52.920]  and this is part of a plan of theirs and and the fact that DHS is receiving so
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:58.160]  many so much ammunition and getting the troop carriers and things like this it
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:03.200]  has I've had some folks suggest to me that there is a possibility that that he
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:09.520]  is planning something to not not only emasculate the military but actually
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:13.760]  create his own strong civilian force the question is why I mean they've been
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:17.960]  good as Congress should have been pursuing this as to why that's what
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:22.160]  this is happening they they've never gotten a straight answer and yet Congress
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:28.080]  is still overlooking this possibility of this this problem of why DHS is arming
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:31.760]  the way it is DHS is part of the problem they got other issues that they've got to
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:36.000]  deal with and not the least of which is a dealing with natural catastrophes and
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  and yet they're another fighting well that's another issue they've pivoted
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.320]  talking about pivoting from the Middle East to Asia they have pivoted like 95
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:48.880]  percent from Al Qaeda I get the manuals the police send them to me we break them
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:53.720]  on the national news all the time 95% pivot I mean it'll be like a hundred
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:58.160]  page training manual I don't publish a lot of these cuz it could it could be
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:00.800]  actually damaging the real national script we show the cover sheets and
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:05.720]  stuff 95% of it will be about key party gun owners veterans Christians and then
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:10.400]  like one page on Al Qaeda yeah they see they see the threat more from within
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:14.600]  than from without and I think that this is what we're what we're seeing is
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:17.880]  pretty much what happened during the Clinton years that he never wanted to
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:23.040]  talk about after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that there was actually a
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:26.520]  terrorist that that was a terrorist act it was a criminal act by some
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:31.160]  disgruntled people there was a failure to want to recognize sure do have an
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:35.120]  external threat but it's more internal with your lone wolves and your and your
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:41.240]  right what he would refer to as your right wing militant militant groups
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:45.880]  and that's where I think the DHS is looking more as to where the threat is
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:49.280]  coming from within sure well I mean I mean here's my issues turn you're a
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:56.080]  smart guy I have a lot of military in my family I've literally read probably 500
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:00.240]  books on military history study it I know I don't know the tip of the
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:04.000]  iceberg I look at Valerie Jarrett I've read her papers I've seen her give
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  speeches she's a low-grade moron the woman looks mentally ill and I'm sorry
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.800]  well our country and I'm not usually the guy that goes with the theory of
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:15.640]  incompetence but that's even more frightening that the elite running this
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:20.680]  country are a bunch of incompetent dumb commies I mean I'll use that low
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:24.560]  pejorative it's what they are who literally are social engineering and
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:29.080]  that's 10 times more scary than an in control elite because at least an in
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:32.720]  control elite doesn't want to blow the planet up these mental patients look
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:38.120]  what they've done with Obamacare they this is a disaster I mean I think Obama
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:42.040]  needs to be impeached I know world that daily's leading a big group up to try to
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:46.400]  get that done coming up in a few weeks I mean what do here's my final question
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.840]  what do we do well I mean a do you agree with me these are very unstable weirdos
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:57.520]  and then be what do what are the generals and others saying that we can do any
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:02.320]  ideas try to stop this well I think it was the first of all yes I would agree
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:06.120]  with you that these are unstable weirdos they they have their own agenda
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:09.960]  they're in the position of power right now the argument is well you voted for
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:14.120]  them but we've got to live with it and I've had a lot of people and comments on
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:19.040]  my some of my stories saying well maybe we maybe we need to be taking taking
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:24.560]  taking back the government and and and there's talk like that now that's
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:28.280]  coming coming through people are very alarmed and I think but there's
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:32.920]  nothing that you can do about it short of taking up arms and it seems because
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:39.040]  that we we live under a nation of laws and and we voted for the man and or
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:43.440]  there's many many people voted for me I know I didn't but but then we have to
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:45.920]  live with it until the next election I was about to say though I mean take the
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:49.640]  military strategy we say they're a bunch of buffoons but they've got they're
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:53.800]  ready they want a civil war they want to push us that's what the Navy seals on
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:57.880]  and off record including a naval officer told me who's commanded large
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:00.680]  groups of seals I'll just leave it at that and then we've had the seals on the
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:06.000]  show that that's their analysis the Navy that the Navy special warfare people
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.800]  have looked at this and they say it's exactly what you're just looting to they
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:13.640]  want to push us into this but then we have no choice but maybe we do so let me
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:17.240]  ask you as a smart guy who's talked to all these other folks what do we do we
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:20.360]  don't want a civil war with poor cops and military that are just following
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:24.260]  orders but we can't go under common control what do we do I think we have
[01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:29.640]  to continue publicly bringing this out I think people who are in the system and
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:33.600]  people who have just come out they need to speak out of course they they're
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:36.800]  they're still concerned even in retirement if they want to get
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:41.120]  contract or jobs and what have you but we've got this where you we are at a
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:45.860]  point where things could really turn south on us and that this is what
[01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:50.480]  and we need to be bringing this out more and more and just keep hammering it
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:55.120]  and hammering it to really make this resonate and the people's consciousness
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:59.880]  and I would agree with Congress from west that we we need a congressional
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:03.120]  oversight and just what is really going on not that anything will ever come up
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:06.680]  but that mere fact that it's being brought out publicly I think it's going
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:12.040]  to be necessary to keep to keep I agree and for those that don't know you know
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:15.760]  well that's why you have the Congress Commission officers to begin with because
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:19.760]  you just can't have a Napoleon or a Hitler run all the military themselves
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:23.680]  that's always the bane of any free civilization as a Julius Caesar comes
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:28.480]  along and I think I really think these people running things well they talk
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:31.120]  about it talk about they want him to be a dictator wanting to have declare
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:35.360]  martial law you know see what Jackson leads so I think I I mean we need to
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:38.680]  listen to what these people are saying absolutely and and and deal with it in
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:43.440]  closing and I appreciate your time sir tell us about your new book a nation
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:49.120]  forsaken boy that says it all yes well that's that was whole idea the federal
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:53.760]  government has let us down and trying to protect this country against an
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:58.280]  electromagnetic pulse either from natural from the sun or from man-made
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:03.040]  which can be some little small country with a nuclear weapon in a and a means
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:06.840]  of delivery systems have been just exploded over at a high altitude and
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:12.320]  and knock out our national grid and and and all of the other critical life
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:16.120]  sustaining critical infrastructure which depend upon that grid they can do it
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:21.720]  with one blast and we're not ready for it and we have not equipped our and we
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:27.960]  have not hardened our our facilities whether it's for telecommunications or
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:36.120]  our pipelines are even our emergency responders they would also be affected
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:39.920]  our hospitals would be affected because we're totally dependent I mean look at
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:43.760]  the depression most Americans were self-sufficient and it was devastating if
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:47.640]  we have something like this now all the experts I talked to I haven't read your
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:51.480]  book yet I want to read it but I mean they say this is something we don't come
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:56.440]  back from at least not in the way we have been that's right well Jim Wolsey
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:01.840]  is and the new gingrich has recently formed a an EMP coalition and they're
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:05.640]  they're talking about this now they're trying to get a national effort underway
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:09.240]  to get Congress to pass what's called the shield act I don't think it's going to
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:13.360]  pass so it might pass in the house but certainly not in the Senate and also
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:18.520]  working more with the states to get the legislators at the state level to to
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:23.560]  direct their public utilities to start hardening these facilities we can
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:27.040]  mitigate this problem with just two billion dollars across the nation that's
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:31.240]  right if we if we put our minds to two billion dollars that they'll spend
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:35.200]  instead to put in transgender bathrooms I mean it's just unbelievable well
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:39.520]  listen I really appreciate you joining us mr. Maloof and your your analysis and
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:43.040]  unfortunately I concur with all of it and I just hope we can make it out of
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:47.320]  this I mean it's good news that Obamacare is finally blowing up so bad that I
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:51.280]  think I think this could be the you know the end of Obama being able to get
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:54.440]  done the problem is he just signs executive orders like shutting down our
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:58.440]  power plant speaking of power and does this let me ask you this are we at the
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:02.480]  most dangerous point right now then because Obama's thinking like a rock
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:06.840]  but that's when he might try something and and and what could that be to get
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:11.640]  his agenda back on track well yeah it'll be the tail wagging the dog episode you
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:16.480]  know people talk about what is he can he be impeached for this he lied to the
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:19.720]  American people well he also lied to Congress and that should be a misdemeanor
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:25.120]  right there he lied to Congress about Obamacare in which people would not be
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:30.120]  able to lose use and lose their doctors or their other health care and and on
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:34.480]  the basis of that they went ahead and passed that legislation without without
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:38.400]  any Republican support certainly but it did go through the country it did go
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:44.040]  through the it did go through the Congress and as a consequence they now
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:50.000]  are finding that it's just not true and so that to me is is something maybe the
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.160]  legal types need to look at that he lied in lying to the Congress the way he did
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:59.040]  that he and to get that legislation passed has he in fact committed a
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:03.960]  misdemeanor which is under the Constitution impeachable it certainly
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:07.080]  is we've got to send a message that we're not going to put up with this type
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:11.960]  of just rampant craziness and control freak behavior thank you so much for
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:15.520]  your time well thanks for helping me wow that was a scary interview but you know
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:22.320]  folks we're not trying to scare you I'm the type of guy that if it's flooding
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:26.720]  and I need to go to higher ground then I go to higher ground it's not that I'm
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:32.680]  living in fear I woke up three weeks ago open my back door looking on to the
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:36.680]  property that have a small piece of property was a ranch behind me and there
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:43.280]  was a no exaggeration I think 500 foot wide no it was actually kind of
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:51.800]  guesstimated measured it about a thousand feet past the my property on over
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:56.760]  the fence line giant Barton Creek was like a just torrent of like white
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:03.760]  rapids blasting out of a fire hose and it was coming up to our property line up
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:07.400]  to the fence all the way up to the pillars of our house because our house
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:13.840]  was built on stilts because it's an area that floods every 50 years and it
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:19.880]  kept rising and rising and it wasn't that I was living in fear that I went out
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:23.000]  looked up the window and saw the water rising and I walked down I said oh honey
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.600]  it's not raining anymore it's raining for 12 hours straight we're up near the
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:31.920]  headwaters it should be okay I don't think it's gonna be an issue and then
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:35.360]  obviously my children and wife were freaked out I'm no hydrologist but I
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:38.200]  could tell it's not raining more up to the headwaters it should be okay but I
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:43.000]  said if it keeps raining it might knock out our porch and stuff so we might have
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.280]  to leave but I said it and I went look at the weather report it wasn't keep
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:50.560]  raining so it was alright and then it went in a few hours and went back down
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:55.880]  to like 50 feet across so I was knocking trees over you name it it was I mean it
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:00.520]  was like a major river blasting by my house from just a sad creek that goes
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:07.160]  into Barton Creek the reason I tell that analogy now is or that story as an
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:11.360]  analogy of what we're currently under I mean I'm just watching a giant rising
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:19.200]  waters of tyranny and I'm sitting here going we need to stay no to this I'm
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:22.400]  getting called an extremist and a radical and I want to kill cops and I
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:26.720]  want to kill people and I don't want to kill anybody I just want to be a nice
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:32.480]  guy I just want to live in a free country our government sold us out to China
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:37.040]  and others undermining us at the same time attacking anything good I mean
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:41.960]  these people are just deviant I've now come to realization they are deviant
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:45.600]  deviant not like they want to go have sex with somebody I've learned that's
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:48.440]  not even really what you call deviance that's like the distraction area deviance
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:53.360]  it's the deviant of like screwing things up and messing with things and and
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:57.920]  doing nasty things and doing bad things and we all need to be like Dylan
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:00.720]  Radigan six months ago they got fired she's going this is all corrupt we're
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:04.400]  in trouble this is but you flipped out because he's there around the lines
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:07.520]  you're supposed to flip out you're supposed to say I'm not gonna be part of
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:15.080]  this anymore like Howard Beale a network and that's all I've done I mean I went
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:20.680]  because military told me about it and I saw Marines training to take our guns
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:24.520]  in America and I was a mainline libertarian Republican then and I was
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:29.560]  like oh my gosh and I found out about the whole plan they've been trying this
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:34.120]  forever they don't they already run everything they don't need to be doing
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:39.080]  all this they should they literally want to go after families they literally want
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:42.920]  our guns they want to break us they want to dominate us I mean it's not a they

[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:52.320]  it's like racism against Native Americans when they've already been
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:56.920]  defeated hunting everyone down and killing them the globalists are going to

[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:22.280]  a little beans and we whipped the bloody British at the town of New Orleans we
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:27.320]  fired our guns and the British kept becoming there wasn't as many as there was a while ago
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:31.960]  we fired once more and they begin to run it all down the Mississippi to the
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:39.160]  Gulf of Mexico we looked down a river and we see the British come and they must
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:43.360]  have been a hundred of beaten on the drum they stepped so high and they made
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:46.600]  the bugles ring we stood beside our cotton veils and didn't say a name

[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:54.320]  some lives many as there was a while ago we fired once more and they
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:57.160]  begin to run it all down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico just remember they
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:00.320]  start a civil war folks
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:07.640]  only those of us in leadership will be killed first and I'm not even worried
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:10.600]  about that I'm worried about beating these guys in the end there's things
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:14.880]  bigger than one person's life there's the children and there's justice to be
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:21.360]  served I don't want this physical war to come and I'm doing everything I can and
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:30.680]  on my knees every day before my almighty creator asking for the for the guidance
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:38.120]  you know sometimes in God's plan bad things happen we're here so that people
[01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:42.600]  have a choice in their heart to make about which side they're gonna be on in
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:46.080]  their heart and that's the most important decision none of us can do this
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:51.480]  alone we don't know what the outcome is gonna be short term but we know that in
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:56.920]  the end right always comes out on top it may take a hundred years may take six
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:02.760]  months they take a day we don't know what's in store for us there's a lot of
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:09.120]  twists and turns in this but everybody can feel the great danger we're all in
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:15.920]  we can tell history is already happening and it's about to happen and I feel like
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:21.400]  every day this could be my last broadcast here and everybody can tell
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:27.720]  hearing me on the air that and you can feel it as well this is history
[01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:33.480]  happening right now and you need to decide who your heart's with it's real
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:38.600]  simple if you want to break it down to men he certainly wasn't perfect but if
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:42.680]  you studied him he had amazing courage and leadership and providence are you
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:53.000]  with George Washington or are you with Barack Obama are you with people like
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:58.160]  Martin Luther King who wasn't perfect but had a lot of courage and vision or are
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:04.920]  you with people like Hillary Clinton you're gonna have to make a decision you
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:08.720]  got to decide in life it didn't about how many bobbles you got it didn't how
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:13.120]  many people know who you are believing I've got that it means nothing it matters
[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:17.520]  what you stand for and what you did it's not about the toys folks it's about
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:22.400]  what you did the air and tippin cheesy song but it's not cheesy we say it's
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:25.600]  cheesy because we feel cheesy when we feel like doing the right thing like
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:29.760]  that's bad no that's good you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:33.560]  anything you've got to be your own man not a puppet on the string never
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:37.840]  compromise was right and uphold your family name you've got to stand for
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:44.520]  something or you'll fall for anything yeah we might have had more money been
[01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:49.560]  better off live in a better house of dad done more given in a little more back
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:55.160]  and down but in the final equation ladies and gentlemen we have a
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:59.360]  civilization because people didn't bend over and bow down that's why the
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:04.560]  corrupt always try to attack those that are pure of heart tell us we're impure
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:09.640]  to tell us we're frauds to tell us we're lies because they they then know that
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:12.920]  that affects us and we'll give up thinking we're not worthy to fight evil
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:18.160]  you understand that they are willfully evil their hearts are evil that's the
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:24.240]  difference we are willfully good we have good will we have courage we have
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:30.600]  honor we have strength we have the future if we take it in our hands now is
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:36.440]  the time to choose which side you serve now is the time to give your heart to

[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:35.720]  well we're into the third hour here today it's one o'clock central standard
[02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:40.880]  time I'm Alex Jones your host and John McAfee of course the most famous
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:45.360]  anti-virus maker out there in the company still on the top companies out
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:49.480]  there that bears his name he's an inventor a journalist a really
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:55.480]  interesting fellow and of course so the website is who is McAfee.com and he
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:58.200]  joins us here we're gonna come back in the next segment really get into all
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:01.840]  the things he wants to cover but he was here about an hour before it came out
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:07.480]  and he said yeah I just talked to I just talked to NBC and they're gonna be you
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:10.560]  know talking about how the feds tried to hire him to come try to fix health care
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:14.400]  so I guess they are all hands on deck trying to hire all the tech gurus to
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:17.720]  fix stuff we're gonna talk about that coming up in the next segment but John
[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:21.120]  it is great to meet you in person buddy well it's great to meet you Alex I've
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:25.320]  talked to you on the phones too many times I felt like I knew you anyway well
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:28.520]  it's good to have you here what do you think of Austin so far I like Austin
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:33.680]  very nice town it's it's small small enough to to be enjoyable and not too
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:37.280]  crowded and yet large enough to have coffee shops well it used to be a lot
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:40.440]  smaller like a hundred thousand people now it's over a million but it is it is
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:44.640]  spread out but right I hear you have a water problem we do we're running out of
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:48.960]  water well until it flooded last week I mean every decade or so there's a drought
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:52.640]  but it's it's it next we're gonna have the dams about to break so all right
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:56.560]  well that's that's preferable I think I think the prettiest places in Austin
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:01.720]  would be down on say the Colorado River have you seen that yet I have beautiful
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:05.520]  beautiful like I'm saying I think that's river I'm staying on at the four
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:08.640]  seasons there I've got a beautiful view of some river there there were punters
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:12.720]  out this morning so what do you want to get into I mean obviously we'll talk
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:16.920]  about Obamacare that's the big breaking news we'll get an update on Brazil NSA
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:20.840]  you say there's more than just the NSA spying on us well obviously I mean if
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:24.720]  the NSA is spying on us and there's just one covert branch of the government
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:29.200]  then everybody has to be it'd be ridiculous to have this the NSA spying
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:34.640]  on the US population but the CIA and the FBI and other covert arms not doing
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:38.680]  military so you know for fact that we're being spied on by everyone you know
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:42.680]  Edward Snowden just blew the whistle on one aspect and so we're focused on that
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:46.360]  and the other the other branches are probably going oh please don't let them
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:51.400]  focus on us well that's right I mean there's 15 big intelligence agencies but
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:56.400]  it gets worse than that because it came out the DEA is hooked into the NSA
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:00.360]  tracking everybody I mean so they're listening to you talk about a pot plant
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:03.840]  you've got growing in your backyard well I don't smoke pot but no no but I'm at
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:07.960]  the public out there sure of course right so the all the all the agencies
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:10.640]  cooperate to a certain extent I mean they're jealous of each other and they
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:14.280]  keep guarded secrets but you can be guaranteed that's something of interest
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:19.320]  to one agency maybe of interest to another and and so there's nothing that
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:24.960]  we do that isn't known now I mean that has to be the case I also want to talk
[02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:27.920]  about your product when it comes out because you mean you're already one of
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:32.240]  the most famous computer type inventors out there I tell you this will be
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:36.040]  revolutionary it's not just an off-site proxy you go through because we know they
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:40.120]  they tap the backbone before it even gets there they've bragged about that if
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:43.640]  it's a device in front of your computer I don't know why I didn't think of that
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:47.720]  I guess I'm not John McAfee well you know it's it's a very simple concept
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:50.200]  people think that it's going to be difficult to implement but it's not
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:55.040]  it's a very simple idea it's just you step outside the box and say okay
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:59.280]  everyone's trying to fix the internet it's too big it's been here too long
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:03.440]  there are too many pieces I said well it can't be fixed why don't we just create
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:07.000]  another internet sort of a sub part of the real internet and as it grows
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:11.920]  perhaps that will be the new internet but it's very simple the the the concept
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:15.240]  rests on the principle that if they do not know if no one knows even yourself
[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:19.240]  the ID of the person you're sending it to or receiving information from then
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:22.400]  how can anybody watch that information and if the information itself is
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:26.600]  encrypted then even if it is intercepted it means nothing and my encryption
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:30.240]  technique has not been vetted by the NSA or they were not involved in the
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:34.760]  development of it so like every other technique is so they can't look at it
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:39.320]  nor can any other agency well John McAfee's our guest in studio your host
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:43.320]  Alex Jones and when we come back we're gonna dive into an in-depth interview
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:46.440]  I'm gonna ask him about human potential where he thinks things are going
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:50.240]  transhumanism Ray Kurzweil I've got a bunch of my questions we're gonna cover
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:53.840]  his points first as I asked him before we went live what do you want to cover I've
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:05:00.160]  got a list of four things it's all coming up live uncensored straight ahead
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:06.320]  strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future
[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:11.000]  about how do I safeguard renowned author and expert Joel Scowzen the US isn't
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.800]  building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat
[02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:19.200]  they know that a massive nuclear attack is coming they want that attack to come
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:23.520]  told Scowzen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic
[02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:28.000]  relocation and the securing of your home what I tell people is that you do have
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:31.960]  time we talk about natural disasters the health environment we talk about
[02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:35.960]  pollution the water quality my personal experience about being in every one of
[02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:39.240]  these states most people want to be ready won't be able to get out of town
[02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:43.920]  because they'll be absolute panic there is no preparedness without strategy

[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:34.560]  the results. Well John McAfee is our guest he's come to Austin to visit with us
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:42.000]  and this morning he did a interview with CNBC and its GOP asked for tech
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:47.160]  founder ex-fugitive McAfee to diagnose Obamacare and that fits in with the
[02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:52.560]  political article tech surge to repair Obamacare websites they're saying it's
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:58.080]  like the Manhattan project as they panic to try to fix it now of course John
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:05.680]  McAfee is a extremely famous computer programmer engineer worked for all sorts
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:10.040]  of big corporations NASA you name it he developed McAfee which is still the
[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:16.680]  dominant antivirus system out there he's also been better known lately for a
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:24.080]  scaping out of the kleptocratic area of beliefs and exposing connections to the
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:30.360]  communist Chinese Muslim terrorists you name it Ryerson plots and when he broke
[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:35.640]  this on our show I said man that is hard to believe and but I still had him on
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:41.680]  and said it may be true but then it all later came out in the news months and
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:47.600]  months later so he is definitely a blessed charmed man to have been able
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:51.520]  to make it out of there into Guatemala and then back to the good old US of A
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:55.240]  and we're going to talk about his view on the world and so many issues the NSA
[02:09:55.240 --> 02:10:02.440]  you name it but first sir let's get into Obamacare wow so you've been
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:05.560]  contacted by the government to try to come in and fix it what did you tell
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:09.800]  them and why did you refuse I was I was contacted by the House Committee on
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:15.520]  Energy and Commerce they're the ones that oversee the Obamacare package and
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:21.040]  if I would come out and basically oversee some of the changes and give them
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:26.560]  input on what needed to be done I said sure then they added that we can't pay
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:29.720]  your expenses or anything the government shut down I'm thinking why you
[02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:36.320]  pay $600 million to to completely inoperable agency to build this
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:42.320]  system and said okay well I'll pay me I'll pay my own way and they said okay
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:45.800]  and then they came back and as well we can't even get the committee members
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:50.680]  all together because again the the chaos of the shutdown can we do it on the
[02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:55.640]  phone and at that point I go okay I'm out of here they expect me to give them
[02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:59.400]  advice on a system that requires showing them charts and graphs and how this
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:02.200]  thing is put together and what's wrong with it and I want to do it over the
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:07.000]  phone they're not serious they just want to say we contacted McAfee he gave us
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.400]  some advice and we're going to implement it which is utter nonsense they're not my
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:15.520]  advice would be throw it away and start over you cannot you cannot fix the
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:19.240]  system that's there it is impossible the way it is architected any good
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:23.120]  program will tell you it says not going to work and they can pour money into it
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:27.160]  another 15 million other hundred million dollars it will never work the way
[02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:32.280]  that it is it needs to be redone friend of mine Mike Adams who's a successful
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:35.320]  computer programmer he said the same thing two and a half weeks ago he said
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:39.640]  several things he said it looks like basically chimpanzees were in there
[02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:44.040]  tied up to keyboards writing this it's gibberish it's not even bad code that
[02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:49.160]  came out today yes and he said that the government always throws more money at
[02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:52.280]  something that doesn't work when you need to scrap it but he said that's what
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:56.280]  all the top programmers are saying that is what you John McAfee as a well-known
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:12:00.840]  top programmer are saying but clearly the Commerce Committee knows that too so
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:05.680]  what do you think the real reason is Mike and others are saying now it's
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:08.960]  actually coming out that it's really an NSA front and they're just getting data
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:13.120]  for who doesn't have insurance to find them and it's totally cold-blooded might
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:16.480]  be might be because it doesn't seem like they were serious and actually
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:21.680]  implementing a Medicare system and you're right the code after after the
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:26.720]  rollout there were programmers that went on bulletin boards asking for help on
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:30.440]  programs that they'd been working on for the system all of them Indian of the
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:35.600]  CGI has over 10,000 programmers in the country of India and they're doing very
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:39.840]  basic programming in a language that only runs on the front end that is your
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:43.560]  your computers so when you log on to Obamacare the programs are downloaded to
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:47.920]  your computer and run and then ship the data back it's a very cheap and easy way
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:51.600]  of doing it and that's fine if you have 10 or 20 users but we have millions
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:55.520]  it just isn't going to work and that's why their architecture can't support it
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:13:00.480]  but but they have a company that that whose employees are asking for help
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:04.640]  from the general public on fixing their problems is absurd if you go through the
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:08.720]  code there but there are fundamental misspellings in there you know that
[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:11.520]  this shouldn't be happening this should be a professional company and that
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:16.200]  company CGI that that worked for the government of Canada about seven
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:20.520]  years ago was fired because of incompetence and not delivering what
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:24.360]  they had wanted so why did we choose a Canadian company when they're planning
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:27.800]  of American companies that are that are very technically competent in this
[02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:32.400]  area I have no idea well that's another issue consumer reports is now saying
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:36.120]  don't go to the website because you can basically have your identity stolen on
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:39.920]  it absolutely absolutely and it's not just the website you don't even know
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:43.160]  that it fits a legitimate website because there are there are so many
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:48.760]  examiners that can have their own websites and sorry that's my telephone
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:51.480]  here it kind of sounds cool it's like Star Trek let me turn the sucker off so
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:57.120]  there's there are so many of examiner sites that anybody can put together and
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:03.560]  the the sites can be made by hackers they can steal your identity they can
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:07.200]  ask for your social security number and the following day your bank account is
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:12.280]  going to be empty and this is going to cost consumers in terms of lost income
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:17.760]  and identity theft more than the entire Obamacare package cost to implement
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:22.440]  unbelievable and Obama came out today I forget the exact quote let me look at
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:28.040]  drudgereport.com and find it he came out and called it a good deal and that
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:32.400]  it's exceeding expectations well I mean I don't know whose expectations those
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:36.040]  would be does that win the BS award of all time well I think so or unless your
[02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:40.440]  expectations are dramatically lower than than any sane person to want to have
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:45.120]  so really that makes no sense what would the expectations be if in fact when it
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:49.200]  rolled out you couldn't log on you couldn't get support there was no
[02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:53.560]  security and it was it was crashing every three minutes so what what
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:57.640]  expectations could you possibly have that it meant. McAfee's our guest in
[02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:05.280]  studio going back here then to understand this the Republican committee a
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:09.280]  chair calls you up it says help us fix it and they want you to just tell them
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:14.040]  over the phone how to fix something that's like many times more complex than
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:18.400]  landing probably the Mars rover on the moon something this complex with all
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:21.720]  these different hundreds of millions people that are supposed to use it with
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:25.240]  all these interfaces and all these exchanges and nobody's ever made something
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:28.320]  like this work before from what I've been told right and then they want you
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:32.440]  over the phone to tell them how to do it right what did you say to them well
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:36.680]  the first of all it wasn't the committee chairman it was the the lawyer for the
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:41.120]  committee John Hayes to who contacted me and he was very flattering he said
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:44.840]  I'm sure this won't be a heavy lift for you with a manager or expertise and all
[02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:49.520]  of this I said well okay and then he said well but I can't pay you expenses I
[02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:54.360]  go okay I mean I'm a good American you need help I'll help then when it got
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:58.040]  down to you know we can't get the committee members all together can you
[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:00.920]  do this over the phone I realized that they're not even serious I never even
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:04.600]  responded this was an email this last one I just they wanted you as a PR name
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:08.440]  as a PR name say we contacted John McAfee and he's given us great advice and
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:11.880]  don't worry everything's going to be fine but it's not and so I don't want to
[02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:15.520]  be involved did you give him the advice you gave our listeners scrap it well
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:19.360]  they know that I've been saying that on in the press for a week now so yeah they
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:22.320]  have to scrap it and they're not going to listen to that or at least scrap the
[02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:26.840]  front end I mean without well how do you have a website based on a law it's
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:30.560]  got to follow this cockamamie law I well that's that's the other problem here
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:36.160]  technology within the government there are 6,000 pages of regulations for how
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:40.280]  you develop technological programs we're gonna and it takes years to write
[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:44.680]  those regulations technology is an area where every year you throw yourself on
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:48.000]  the way because it's out of date and you get a new one with new features
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:53.320]  technology is advancing rapidly the regulations are years old how on earth
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:57.480]  can you develop a high-tech program using regulations that take three years
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:17:01.200]  to write that's the fundamental problem it has to be simplified throw the
[02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:04.720]  regulations out trust the people that you're contracting with get American
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:09.280]  customers get American companies to produce the thing and and let's get
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:14.200]  real here well there are laws that most of our tech that's government funded
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:17.560]  should come from the US but they were religiously ignore it because of
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:21.280]  globalism they wanted to industrialize this country so they can pick the winners
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:26.280]  and losers absolutely absolutely but given that then you can't complain when
[02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:30.080]  systems don't work you can't complain when 10 I'm not putting down Indians by
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:33.000]  the way or India they are very intelligent people in great
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.440]  programmers but CGI takes them and go and puts them through a three months
[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:41.000]  training class three months and expects them to now produce miracle code it
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.680]  doesn't work and then connect it with all the other codes and connect it with
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:46.720]  all the other code it's like sure that's a very cheap way of doing it and
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:50.120]  you're gonna get a lot of code but then how on earth do you fix it this is the
[02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:53.400]  problem but I've talked to programmers that say and now it's in the news that
[02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:56.880]  it's just gibberish a lot of it like people just gave up and delivered crap
[02:17:56.880 --> 02:18:00.320]  they did because they were under the gun for time it has been on it has been on
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:03.320]  I know how that works you're a programmer and you don't even understand what the
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:06.820]  problem is and you're trying to fix it and your boss says get it done by
[02:18:06.820 --> 02:18:10.320]  Friday well you get it done by Friday and you turn it in and you hope no one
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:13.960]  ever runs that program to find out that it doesn't work that's like homework you
[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:18.160]  do on the school bus on the way on the way you're just scribbling as fast as
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:21.880]  you can go I hope I hope the teacher doesn't read this but unfortunately you
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:25.040]  know we do on these programs and we are they're gonna have found out well yeah
[02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:28.360]  I mean it's not like Common Core where they teach the kids two plus two equals
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:32.840]  four a computer's got to have it right or it won't work absolutely I guess the
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:36.720]  banksters percent right exactly I guess the banksters and the globalists have
[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:41.120]  finally tried to feed their con artist bull into a computer that's it and it's
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:45.480]  not working it's certainly not working way this was implemented so what do you
[02:18:45.480 --> 02:18:49.280]  think's gonna happen he's now trying to blame Republicans and people that don't
[02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:52.400]  like socialist healthcare for the website failing he did that in a speech
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:56.880]  today well you know you can blame the manager of the technological program and
[02:18:56.880 --> 02:19:02.520]  nothing else CGI is responsible period for delivering a working program they
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:07.320]  did not because really it was unrealistic given them the the way that
[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:10.840]  they did it and they did it in order to make money I understand that you've got
[02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:13.160]  a certain income you have a hundred million dollars that the government's
[02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:16.760]  paying you if you can get it done for five hundred thousand you have a ninety
[02:19:16.760 --> 02:19:21.280]  nine point five percent profit margin but now CGI is gonna get more money to
[02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:24.840]  fix it they say can't and they're gonna use the same program is because you
[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:29.240]  can't use new ones to fix an existing program whereas if they threw it out
[02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:33.480]  grab some really decent programs I mean very top-notch program it's because
[02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:39.440]  program don't tell them how to fix it we want it to fail anyway okay John

[02:23:33.480 --> 02:23:37.920]  tracks at privacylockdown.com the NSA has already shut down hundreds of sites
[02:23:37.920 --> 02:23:42.120]  and the truth be told they could shut down this operation at any time see the
[02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:45.280]  privacy loophole I'm about to show you allows you to make all your sensitive

[02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:12.920]  John McAfee is a really amazing in person and you saw the media hype and
[02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:16.960]  the demonization everyone was down in beliefs but we need to do a part two
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:21.000]  maybe for the nightly news with you where we go back and show how all the
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:24.960]  stuff you talked about with us earlier this year or I guess last year all of
[02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:28.240]  it later turned out to come out it was it was like a James Bond movie or
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:32.120]  something so we'll have an update in the next segment with Mr. McAfee with us
[02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:37.880]  again I'm Alex Jones you just tuned in but continuing with healthcare.gov I
[02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:41.760]  mean I understand as a top programmer you know reportedly genius level by the
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:44.800]  media and all the stuff you've invented over the years that you look at this and
[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:49.040]  you say it could be fixed my issue is I've talked to other programmers that
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:53.600]  are very smart as well they say there's no way government didn't know this was a
[02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:57.520]  piece of crap it wasn't gonna work what do you think's really going on here well
[02:24:57.520 --> 02:25:02.560]  I mean obviously I mean any sane person is going to test what they have
[02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:07.040]  developed at least one time and usually you test it for many many months and if
[02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:10.520]  the government it has any interest in this program then they had to have
[02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:14.120]  people monitoring the development so of course they knew it wasn't gonna work or
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:18.800]  they didn't bother to test it at all this is this is the bizarre truth of the
[02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:22.840]  issue so I don't know what's going on I do know that what happened is
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:28.240]  unthinkable if it were if it were being managed by of a true technological
[02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:32.840]  manager they would not let this happen you build the program you you design it
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:36.720]  you go through an alpha test period for a few months which is you know you you
[02:25:36.720 --> 02:25:41.600]  have a few people logging in then a beta test where you simulate massive amounts
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:45.440]  of input and then you fix the problems and you roll it out clearly they didn't
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:49.880]  go through any of that this is this is not the normal way of developing
[02:25:49.880 --> 02:25:56.000]  software I don't know what it is but but I've never seen it before I keep
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:00.960]  going back over this because it's just the whole thing is so not Orwellian more
[02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:05.800]  twilight zone because Obama's up there saying it's a great deal and exceeding
[02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:10.080]  expectations and just bizarreness to be like if my wife came home and I was in
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:13.680]  bed with seven women and I got up and said honey I've never cheated on you
[02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:21.360]  baby I mean it's just the level of BS well you know by the way that is a
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:24.440]  standard approach I mean if your wife does catch you in bed with a woman you
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:28.880]  deny it I mean never ever admit so I guess it is like like Bill Clinton said
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:34.280]  denied and I deny so I guess it is literally what's the term they use for
[02:26:34.280 --> 02:26:40.160]  that the Pentagon gas lighting that's it that's it so you know I really don't have
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:43.520]  a clue I am not politically connected I can tell you everything you need to know
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:49.280]  about computers software networking as security it but I don't have a clue what
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:52.480]  do you think about something's wrong and it's not going the way it should what
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:56.160]  do you what do you think about the whole NSA thing being exposed we know
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:27:00.080]  that's been going on for a long time but why now is it getting exposed and where
[02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:03.160]  do you think it's going well it's getting exposed because because someone
[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:07.920]  Edward Snowden said something and showed us now he's hiding out in Russia now
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:12.880]  unfortunately Russia however why are we worrying about the NSA it's every
[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:16.880]  single covert agency of the government and are 15 or 20 of those agencies and
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:22.080]  you know for a fact that if one agency is spying on us that they're all spying
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:27.360]  honest this is a fact and they all share information so the CIA the FBI
[02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:32.040]  Army Intelligence they are all watching us I know this I've known this for years
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:35.720]  if I say something people go all your paranoid you're crazy and it takes
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:39.840]  someone like Snowden to pop up and show us we go oh my god the NSA is spying on
[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:46.280]  us well duh of course they are they have been for years well talking about CGI
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:50.000]  they do the Pentagon's most complex systems so they obviously knew this
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:54.840]  wasn't gonna work so therefore it was done by design to put off Obamacare and
[02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:58.920]  only bring in the fine part I think clearly it's just there to find people
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:02.520]  it's entirely possible you know I don't know for a fact but but something is
[02:28:02.520 --> 02:28:07.400]  going on that this that is is not sensible not to the mind of someone who
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:10.880]  has been developing systems like this the whole life so you could be absolutely
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:17.040]  right let's shift gears into your device I can't wait till this comes out and we
[02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:19.760]  were talking during the break about the government won't be your biggest problem
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:23.480]  who will be your biggest problem with your device that blocks the NSA I think
[02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:29.360]  the music industry and the TV industry they are so paranoid about
[02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:34.520]  intellectual property that is please don't let anybody make one copy of my
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:38.640]  music or my my video and yet statistically I mean if you look at the
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:42.440]  figures the music industry and the television industry and the movie
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:47.640]  industry has never made more money than they are today with all the the piracy
[02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:52.720]  that's going on and also statistics say that people who pirate videos are the
[02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:57.260]  most purchasers they pay the more money for the ones that they do want so they
[02:28:57.260 --> 02:29:00.400]  have no reason to be doing what they're doing but I guarantee you there's already
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:04.200]  been comments made that this is a dangerous product and a dangerous idea
[02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:06.840]  that they're going to try and block it I want to talk about this when we come
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:10.320]  back in the long segment because it tortures me I have an old TV not that
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:13.720]  old like five six years that has a DVD player on the side that I've run in the
[02:29:13.720 --> 02:29:18.760]  garage in the treadmill it broke that DVD player so I went got another one
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:21.600]  plugged it in and it gave me a message and said you're not allowed to run another
[02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:25.840]  device in this anti piracy and these are bought DVDs right I understand and then
[02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:28.280]  I have all this other equipment in here for TV where we're trying to put on a
[02:29:28.280 --> 02:29:32.240]  show and I'll buy the equipment it's my show it won't let it run over a
[02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:36.080]  television right and I can buy I can buy a DVD from Australia and pay for
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:39.680]  legitimately and it will not run on my American DVD player because it's a
[02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:43.760]  different region so it's so it's stopping technological development so
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:47.520]  that they can kleptocratically make more money and instead they're screwing up

[02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:08.640]  was telling me about it we went down with an open carry at the Alamo over a
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:12.840]  thousand people with guns Saturday that made national news that was certainly
[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:17.320]  fun to openly exercise our right to self-defense and deep program all these
[02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:20.720]  people think you should know guns we'll talk to him about guns as well before we

[02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:33.160]  I went into the research at a file of the National Academy of Sciences you name it
[02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:37.760]  this is the only nation iodine that's put through this patented system to
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:42.440]  atomize it down to its absolute most basic elemental form of atomic iodine
[02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:48.600]  and let me tell you let me tell you it is something else so enforce life.com
[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:52.160]  it is sold out we'll have more in about two weeks so get in line to get it
[02:35:52.160 --> 02:35:56.760]  shipped out to you first I'm sorry they had to expand the size of their FDA
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:36:00.360]  approved laboratory bill to supply us they've never seen anything like this and
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:03.560]  so it's great we're getting high quality products out and funding our
[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:09.280]  operation it was just a little 40 year scientific you know specialist
[02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:12.920]  installation that we had do this so they weren't ready to mass produce it but
[02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:19.200]  that is now now happening enforce life.com or as I said 888-253-3139
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:24.440]  John McAfee is here with us and who is McAfee.com is his site so we got cut off
[02:36:24.440 --> 02:36:29.080]  by the break you were getting into your device I mean tell the audience as much
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:31.480]  as you can tell them you were telling me quite a bit but I don't know if that was
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:36.920]  in confidence about how revolutionary but also simple this is going to be and
[02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:42.040]  and what it's going to do. The device is a basically a hardware device that
[02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:45.840]  interfaces with your smartphone you carry it in your pocket it has no screen
[02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:48.840]  it has an on-off switch and a little light to show that the batteries running
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:54.120]  and that's it and we have an application that runs on your your iPhone or your
[02:36:54.120 --> 02:36:58.120]  Android phone that when you want to switch from the internet to secure
[02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:03.040]  network you press a button and then you're now in our network which is
[02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:06.520]  anybody else who has one of these devices within a quarter of a mile you
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:09.680]  are communicating and if you're in a city or a college campus there may be
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:14.640]  thousands of those that are that are close by. It's an information sharing
[02:37:14.640 --> 02:37:17.480]  network it's a file sharing that looks like a new internet or a private new
[02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:20.320]  internet and we'll start out small of course because everyone won't have of
[02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:23.800]  these things have these things but eventually I mean it you switch from
[02:37:23.800 --> 02:37:29.040]  the the current internet to the secure internet over and over and over and to
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:32.120]  begin with you might not be able to communicate with someone in India but
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:36.200]  after a year when we get enough of these done and the information is relayed then
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:39.400]  it'll be just like the internet. But it'll be able to get on the net as the
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:42.800]  first reason to then protect your identity that's absolutely it protects
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:45.360]  your identity and when you're on the secure part of the network no one knows
[02:37:45.360 --> 02:37:50.080]  who you are all of the data is encrypted and it's encrypted by a technique that
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:53.760]  the NSA has not been involved in so they can't break it they can't get into it
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:57.920]  and neither the standard nor the receipt. Let me guess does it have to deal with
[02:37:57.920 --> 02:38:04.280]  holograms? It does not no sir. Okay. If it did I wouldn't tell you would I?
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:08.000]  No no I was talking to my dad about this and he said I bet it's a hologram
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:13.080]  matter face. I might have smarter than I am in some ways but go ahead. No so I'm not
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:15.680]  going to not going to stay for this simple reason. No obviously don't stay.
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:20.280]  We don't want people to know so so it's going to be very secure so neither the
[02:38:20.280 --> 02:38:24.920]  NSA nor the CIA nor the FBI nor Army Intelligence nor anyone can find out
[02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:29.520]  who you're talking to what you're saying and what you're exchanging which is
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:33.080]  really what we should have that right anyway. Now you're a trailblazer in
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:36.360]  your own right obviously but other great minds are going to hear this so they
[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:39.360]  probably already thought of it even if they try to stop you selling this here
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:42.240]  domestically it's going to be a huge international market and then other
[02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:45.760]  people are going to make clones or knockoffs and then other technologies
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:49.560]  they're not going to be able to stop this. Well they may stop me temporarily of
[02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:53.640]  course you know they may say you can't sell this and I'll be fine you know you
[02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:57.840]  only your your control stops at your boundaries you have Canada and Mexico and
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:39:02.040]  the ocean I'll tell it everywhere else. It will have to get here eventually any
[02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:06.120]  any technology which is beneficial will eventually get here we know that it just
[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:10.520]  may take time. The music industry is going to raise hell and complain the
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:14.280]  movie industry is going to complain but you know the intellectual property is
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:19.040]  has been way overplayed by them for the past ten years. Well think about it
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:22.480]  they're trying to get world treaties that in free speech globally for them
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:27.600]  they are encroaching on our rights in the name of their rights I'm sick of it.
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:33.400]  Absolutely and so they are they are shutting down operations that are valid
[02:39:33.400 --> 02:39:38.840]  useful things for it's like shutting down telephones because criminals are
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:44.080]  using it to to covertly rob banks or whatever it's insane we we can't we
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:47.880]  can't protect ourselves to the point that we can't even use technology. Well folks
[02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:51.360]  used to hack with a telephone did I mean do you ban using telephones? That's
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:54.680]  right in fact if the first one to do so is a gentleman Captain Crunch who got
[02:39:54.680 --> 02:39:58.160]  these little whistles from the captain and he learned how to make tones on it
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:01.880]  for the old telephone so that he could he could make free long-distance calls
[02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:04.720]  that was the first telephone hacking well we didn't shut down the phones
[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:08.600]  because of that we didn't we just we just arrested him and that's a sensible
[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:13.080]  thing to do but now they're wanting us to shut down technologies like file
[02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:16.080]  sharing which is very useful for everything you have files you've got
[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:19.400]  photographs that you take on vacation that you want you want to share with
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:22.480]  your friends you put it out in the cloud and they can share it well you want to
[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:27.000]  stop that because people can put music that they haven't paid for on the net
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:30.960]  that's right you can't have prior restraint you know I ran into anti-gun
[02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:37.400]  people at our Alamo open carry this Saturday and they said you know my
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:41.840]  daughter got shot at Aurora and I said I'm sorry for your daughter but
[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:46.040]  statistically crimes using guns are down 49% because a good guy's having
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:48.720]  guns just department numbers right they didn't even deny that but they still
[02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:52.720]  said well it's still gun owners fault this happened I said if somebody stabs
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:57.560]  somebody is it not the knife makers fault or if I sell somebody a car and
[02:40:57.560 --> 02:41:01.080]  they drive down the road and kill somebody this putting the guilt on us
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:05.600]  when we didn't do it it's just crazy well you know it's an authoritarianism
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:09.040]  absolutely I've you know I've owned and carried guns ever since I was 12 and my
[02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:13.040]  father took me hunting for the first time and he taught me how to handle guns
[02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:16.360]  properly and not to point them at people and how to load them and unload them
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:21.600]  and seriously for the past 10 years I have never been without a gun except when
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:25.560]  I shower and when I get paranoid sometimes I don't shower so my wife
[02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:30.000]  complains you know so I've never pointed a gun at anyone certainly never shot at
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:35.640]  anybody but it is to me a deterrent if we all carried guns I lived in a town
[02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:40.280]  called rodeo New Mexico small town of a couple hundred people everybody was armed
[02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:43.960]  there everybody I love it well they never had a problem they never had a
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:47.400]  robbery in the grocery store they never had anything I'm a criminal coming
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:52.480]  through town that you know pulls a gun out in a at a cafe the all the all the
[02:41:52.480 --> 02:41:55.720]  customers are gonna pull a gun well that is criminals are on records that they
[02:41:55.720 --> 02:42:00.000]  don't go to small towns and rural areas because they know they know and so what's
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:03.200]  wrong with that and there's no violent crime there we all carried guns but I
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:06.880]  never saw a gun pulled in well you ask permission if you could bring you know
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:09.840]  like hey I'm bringing a gun we're like well you better right that's what they
[02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:13.240]  said so don't try anything here they said we're we're all armed well no but I
[02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:17.280]  mean for us it's like having a pencil or a coffee cup and it's a tool I sleep
[02:42:17.280 --> 02:42:21.920]  with my now I stopped sleeping with it in my hand for obvious reasons okay but
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:25.560]  but I see all then it gets all lonely yeah you know what but nightmares and
[02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:29.160]  things like that it's a pretty scary that might my car no more just not gonna
[02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:34.200]  be in your hand anymore I said if I lay it next to me you're on the bed that's
[02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:40.320]  okay but I'm always with a gun and and why not I mean if we the criminals have
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:43.640]  guns and off record you've you've had a lot of issues I mean there's a boob
[02:42:43.640 --> 02:42:48.120]  obviously of course and and I you know I mean for a month and a half the
[02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:52.120]  lesion government is actively trying to shoot me and you know why shouldn't I
[02:42:52.120 --> 02:42:54.960]  carry guns and why shouldn't I be able to protect my why are they allowed to
[02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:58.120]  have guns but we aren't well that's that's the problem isn't it and here's the
[02:42:58.120 --> 02:43:01.720]  thing if you if you pass a law saying we can't have guns I promise you the
[02:43:01.720 --> 02:43:04.680]  criminals don't care they're already breaking the law do you think they care
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:08.040]  if they are they're carrying an illegal weapon that's so absurd so we're not
[02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:10.720]  going to take it out of the hands of the people who are going to do damage with
[02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:14.680]  guns we're taking out of the hands of people who protect themselves from
[02:43:14.680 --> 02:43:18.880]  those people who are trying to do damage so I don't know you know I'm gonna have
[02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:22.840]  my gun in my hand except when I'm sleeping or in my pocket or I've got one
[02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:28.960]  here now obviously and you know as long as I can because it's my but I mean it
[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:33.040]  goes back to rural areas we had grizzly bears or or the or the immigrants were
[02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:36.680]  fighting with the natives I mean it came down to you better have a gun on you
[02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:40.720]  or you could get killed or you would get killed it's a fact of life I mean you
[02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:44.880]  know the world is a dangerous place especially outside of our our comfort
[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:47.520]  well here's my issue we're not worried about death threats around here and
[02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:50.520]  stuff because somebody who tries to come around here was something I mean
[02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:54.760]  anybody wants to carry a gun in the briefcase or CHL you name it folks are
[02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:58.040]  packing around here right and that's just the way it is and it's peaceful it's
[02:43:58.040 --> 02:44:00.640]  happy and everybody's friendly right if someone does come in here I'll stand
[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:07.480]  with you with my gun all right so ready right now man here you go yeah I like
[02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:11.640]  revolvers myself just because they're you know you know I do too and I prefer
[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:15.000]  the hammerless oh really I didn't know it's what you had well I've got all kinds
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:18.080]  of guns and I carry different guns for different occasions it's loaded here I'll
[02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:23.600]  let you I notice yours is not there you go all right there you go like a 357 just
[02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:28.360]  in stressful situation loaded I didn't oh yeah oh yeah a 357 you know in a
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:32.080]  stressful situation is good it's got the best penetration for something like this
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:35.040]  question but that's that's a little lighted carrying so that's beautiful it's
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:38.120]  beautiful so and the hammerless variety you know so many times you pull you
[02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:40.880]  gun out of your pocket not to not to point at someone just at the end of the
[02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:43.440]  day and the hammer gets caught on your pocket look at our guns they're they're
[02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:47.360]  friendly they're hanging out together right there we get a document cam shot on
[02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:51.800]  that and in fact in fact they here we'll put them over here by you and they
[02:44:51.800 --> 02:44:55.600]  could just have some time together all right then all right then look at that
[02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:59.840]  like a powerful they're like changing some 357s to I tell you what the finest
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:04.760]  little carry gun is just the new Ruger that little micro 380 I'm a doesn't
[02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:08.840]  carry a bunch of a punch but you know it's one of my friend's wives carries
[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:12.280]  that in her purse yeah well I carry one in each pocket sometimes because there's
[02:45:12.280 --> 02:45:15.680]  so light you can't see them that you don't even know you're carrying them you
[02:45:15.680 --> 02:45:20.520]  know seven rounds 380 trees on a bad gun James Bond use the the Beretta 380
[02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:24.000]  remember that in the first James Bond movie they try to give a different you're
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:29.000]  you're like an adventure aren't you what made you go down to police I guess
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:34.840]  adventure why not you know I think we might live once just once and if that's
[02:45:34.840 --> 02:45:40.320]  the case I don't miss anything I don't miss anything Alex without getting into
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:44.680]  your security and things you're traveling around the US right now I am I'm
[02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:48.920]  traveling with security and because of an incident that happened recently I've
[02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:53.080]  beefed up and I'm traveling with some very serious security now I did notice
[02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:56.960]  that well that's a good thing but I mean going back obviously you were a
[02:45:56.960 --> 02:46:01.000]  computer programmer I think worked at NASA in places going over your bio I
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:04.360]  mean do you have any shadowy background that you think that might be after you
[02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:10.760]  for yeah and not shadowy bad but secretive stuff well I mean I had a top
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:14.000]  secret security clearance for a while when I worked at NASA and I did work on
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:18.680]  some black programs but nothing that that anyone wanted to off me for I think
[02:46:18.680 --> 02:46:22.360]  my biggest concern is beliefs you know I've I ran afoul of the Blesian
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:26.000]  government and I came back and I stated some some things that maybe should not
[02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:29.960]  have been stated that the Prime Minister ordered the death of Arthur Young that
[02:46:29.960 --> 02:46:35.400]  John Stollevar was selling passports illegally that may and this is the
[02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:38.720]  Minister of National Security he's in charge of the army and the police and
[02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:42.200]  of course the Prime Minister is in charge of everything well they're not happy
[02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:45.400]  about that and they're afraid that if I provide more evidence the the entire
[02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:50.800]  government will unravel so obviously I have to think that maybe in the back of
[02:46:50.800 --> 02:46:55.880]  their minds they would they would feel better if I wasn't here well I know you
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:46:59.480]  talk is that paranoia no I don't think that's paranoia I mean knowing what goes
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:03.400]  on in the government of beliefs what it's used for how famously piratical it
[02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:07.480]  is I don't know about those individuals but I know that certainly I would be
[02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:13.400]  concerned if I had the entire Blesian mafia style government angry at me right
[02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:17.080]  and the other thing is is that they they have a longer reach than you might
[02:47:17.080 --> 02:47:21.040]  imagine for example there are American businesses they would love to do business
[02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:24.840]  in Blesian for a lot of you know reasons you can do illegal things there if you
[02:47:24.840 --> 02:47:30.000]  if you pay the right people and and your profits can store and in fact the the
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:34.160]  Blesian soccer team came to Portland where I live in July that's kind of
[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:38.040]  weird isn't to play soccer and with them there was an American business man who
[02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:42.600]  had a private jet who was flying around John Stollevar and two other people the
[02:47:42.600 --> 02:47:47.480]  head of the press office in Belize and the city councilman named Dean
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:52.080]  Stamuels and you know you look at that and think well you know I don't know
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:55.000]  why did they come to my city why did they had a national security come to my
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:58.240]  town way up there you know it's I'm thinking well I don't know maybe I
[02:47:58.240 --> 02:48:01.960]  should be cautious and I am cautious I don't call that paranoia well I don't
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:05.080]  need to be stupid if you aren't I would be sorry but as a result when I go
[02:48:05.080 --> 02:48:08.920]  somewhere I people people arrive in advance they check things out they
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:13.240]  looked as to if anything unusual is happening I change venues constantly I
[02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:16.640]  tell them and when he's staying at one hotel and check into another and when I
[02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:22.040]  arrive I arrive with them serious security so well I mean going back to
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:26.920]  Belize you were talking about Muslims and certain countries and Ryerson it was
[02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:31.040]  nowhere in the press and then it had to be four months later exactly what you
[02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:35.040]  said about that came out and you said that's one of the reason they were
[02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:38.920]  after you I mean do you now know have you figured out out of all the reasons
[02:48:38.920 --> 02:48:42.920]  why you think folks were after you they're after me because of what I knew
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:49.880]  because you know when they raided my my compound in Orange Walk in in May shot my
[02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:52.800]  dog in front of my eyes did a half million dollars worth of damage kept me
[02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:56.520]  handcuffed in the sun for 14 hours by the way that's I don't recommend that is
[02:48:56.520 --> 02:49:01.120]  something to do for fun Alex no that hurts that does hurt believe me I tried
[02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:06.080]  not to win for the whole day and I didn't and then left and then came back
[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:10.240]  and said you know you're going to you know are you going to reconsider giving
[02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:14.840]  us a donation to the party and I go no I'm not I went to the press at that
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:18.480]  point I started handing out presents computers that I had my own software on
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:23.400]  just to monitor things okay I gave them to the all the government ministers and
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:26.840]  their secretaries and their aides and and that's why I found out what was
[02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:30.080]  happening so you gave them a Trojan horse I think you made them think they'd
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:33.320]  won you started giving them goodies absolutely absolutely and just like the
[02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:36.160]  general public they just take devices they take devices they don't they don't
[02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:38.760]  think they don't think what who is this man why I'm John McAfee for every
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:44.320]  sake I invented computer security turn on your microphone on your laptop in
[02:49:44.320 --> 02:49:48.920]  your office and watch what you're doing that's so trivial anybody can do it so
[02:49:48.920 --> 02:49:53.560]  it may be in retrospect it may have been a mistake because then you learned
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:56.720]  all the secrets you were like your own private NSA all the stuff that's going
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:50:00.160]  on and it was scary and then I came back and I made the mistake of actually
[02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:05.640]  telling it on the blog and so yeah you'd be paranoid too if you know these
[02:50:05.640 --> 02:50:09.800]  people came up to your town and some American some shady American business
[02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:13.600]  man with a private jet drivet flying them all over America showing up in your
[02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:18.040]  town is like whoa so you know maybe the next time I'm on your show we will we
[02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:22.440]  will discuss this in greater detail it might make a really nice show yeah
[02:50:22.440 --> 02:50:26.880]  absolutely I tell you because because an event did actually happen recently
[02:50:26.880 --> 02:50:32.640]  that that caused me to do more than double my security and start asking a
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:35.880]  bunch of very hard questions I bet they're not happy they messed with you
[02:50:35.880 --> 02:50:39.280]  though yeah you know if they wouldn't have done that to your dog and all that
[02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:42.600]  stuff would you everything be fine shut my dog I think we could have fixed it
[02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:46.960]  but you don't shoot my dogs my dogs are family you know I don't know how you
[02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:51.320]  feel about animals but you know a dog is oh I love dogs well you know they're
[02:50:51.320 --> 02:50:54.200]  they're a member of the family they provide protection and I think they're
[02:50:54.200 --> 02:50:56.720]  maybe the best members of my family I'm well so it's certainly much more
[02:50:56.720 --> 02:51:00.400]  exactly what I'm gonna show you he's never gonna turn on you exactly we'll be

[02:54:05.680 --> 02:54:13.240]  present the Alex Jones Joe because there's a war on for your mind
[02:54:19.960 --> 02:54:25.280]  technology is rapidly increasing to say the least some people like Ray Kurzweil
[02:54:25.280 --> 02:54:28.560]  believe that there's gonna be a singularity I believe you'll have a
[02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:33.320]  singularity in information and news first or something approximating that
[02:54:33.320 --> 02:54:37.720]  something getting close to it where no matter what the system does they're not
[02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:41.320]  going to hide stuff anymore and when they try to put out this info that's
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:44.760]  going to be exposed that's already happening the Pentagon Psiops head came
[02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:47.600]  out a few months ago and said they're in deep trouble their ordered a lot of the
[02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:50.920]  public and the public's catching them and the Pentagon said we want to stop
[02:54:50.920 --> 02:54:54.720]  lying and there are people freaking out during the Pentagon briefing that was
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:54:57.080]  streamed on the internet right getting up saying we don't want to lie anymore
[02:54:57.080 --> 02:55:00.440]  me it was real sure but I think at the higher level they told me to do it to
[02:55:00.440 --> 02:55:04.800]  try to give people's confidence to go we promise we won't lie anymore but here
[02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:10.000]  is Ray Kurzweil one of the Google execs saying meet the Google executive who
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:14.760]  plans to cheat death Ray Kurzweil takes 150 vitamins a day so he can hold out
[02:55:14.760 --> 02:55:18.200]  long enough for invention of robots that will keep humans alive now whether
[02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:22.240]  this is real or not in my film in game that I made seven years ago I show all
[02:55:22.240 --> 02:55:26.800]  the quotes they say humans are bad they're gonna establish world government
[02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:30.720]  forcibly reduced world population they're gonna merge the machines and live
[02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:34.600]  forever I didn't say that as the New York Times said I was quoting Kurzweil
[02:55:34.600 --> 02:55:39.520]  and others here he is back in the news today this is the Daily Mail what do you
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:46.120]  think of these things because whether it's feasible down the road or not these
[02:55:46.120 --> 02:55:50.400]  people are maniacs who were anti-human what is your take on it well you know I
[02:55:50.400 --> 02:55:56.200]  have in one in one respect I I admire Kurzweil because he I do too he
[02:55:56.200 --> 02:56:01.480]  developed some some great music okay or musical devices and a copy of machine or
[02:56:01.480 --> 02:56:05.520]  a bunch of others and I'm not sure about the copy machine he's a scanner scanner
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:10.280]  right he's a brilliant man there's no question about it I don't want to merge
[02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:13.840]  with the machine quite frankly I would rather become a little more human than
[02:56:13.840 --> 02:56:17.920]  I even am I think we become machines by by spending our days watching the
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:22.240]  television instead of watching the world around it I agree and I think that
[02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:25.680]  there's so much of modern life which turns us into machines that why bother
[02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:29.640]  making a mechanical device to connect with us we're already halfway machines
[02:56:29.640 --> 02:56:32.760]  I'd like to go the other way and let's get a little more human you know let's
[02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:36.600]  have more personal face-to-face communication and let's get out and
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:40.840]  shoot or or do what we like to do or just get some fresh air jog around the
[02:56:40.840 --> 02:56:44.160]  block how much of that is is happening these days it's less than less than less
[02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:50.000]  and when it does happen it's structured and it's formalized so you know it's
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:53.480]  called quality time to take your kids out in nature well quality time should be
[02:56:53.480 --> 02:56:56.920]  every every moment of life is as I understand it every single moment and
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:01.720]  if you're not having quality time 24 hours a day do something else Alex I
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:07.040]  agree with the revolution against tyrants is having fun having friends and
[02:57:07.040 --> 02:57:11.640]  not being in the cookie cutter system that's it exactly you know getting into
[02:57:11.640 --> 02:57:15.080]  real life and take some risks because they have quite any quality time is
[02:57:15.080 --> 02:57:18.200]  risky it means you've got to get out of get off if you're comfortable sofa out
[02:57:18.200 --> 02:57:23.040]  of your safe secure house and into a world which is unpredictable and unknown
[02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:26.160]  it's a mystery well isn't that how things were when you were a kid wanted
[02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:30.120]  great to get out and explore the mystery of life the mystery of the world
[02:57:30.120 --> 02:57:33.440]  absolutely going to a friend's house and going out in the woods you bet
[02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:37.880]  sneaking on some farmers ranch and picking strawberries in your neighbor's
[02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:40.320]  backyard at night whether we're you know without them knowing whatever it's
[02:57:40.320 --> 02:57:44.560]  it's it's an adventure it's life as it should be we should all be children
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:49.120]  again they're trying to insert us into these bubbles where they bombard us with
[02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:52.600]  nothing but their propaganda to keep us from seeing the wider universe all
[02:57:52.600 --> 02:57:55.360]  right well that's how they control us see if you see the wider universe you're
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:57:58.640]  gonna ask questions aren't you like what the hell are you saying you're giving
[02:57:58.640 --> 02:58:02.840]  us garbage about Obamacare but if all we get is the news we some of us are
[02:58:02.840 --> 02:58:06.560]  gonna believe it you can fool all the people some of the time but you're
[02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:11.360]  talking about singularities you can't fool all the people all the time what do
[02:58:11.360 --> 02:58:15.680]  you think of a singularity I mean you think that really will come I think it's
[02:58:15.680 --> 02:58:20.280]  happened in many cases I think I think that this is evidence of it here we
[02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:25.000]  have something which is so obviously broken and improper that the Britain
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:28.680]  saying well that's what I expected that me it means expectations so it's a
[02:58:28.680 --> 02:58:32.680]  con artist singularity absolutely like a magician you know doing doing a trick
[02:58:32.680 --> 02:58:35.760]  you know don't watch what the left hand is doing and if we don't watch what the
[02:58:35.760 --> 02:58:39.320]  left hand is doing we go hold on we got a one minute break I got to do five
[02:58:39.320 --> 02:58:54.880]  minutes overdrive a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into
[02:58:54.880 --> 02:58:58.680]  why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that was still starving and my
[02:58:58.680 --> 02:59:03.000]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:06.480]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[02:59:06.480 --> 02:59:11.040]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace
[02:59:11.040 --> 02:59:15.680]  elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[02:59:15.680 --> 02:59:20.440]  healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there
