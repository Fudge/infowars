[00:00.000 --> 00:25.600]  All of a sudden, the fame-addicted vaccine dictator has appeared.
[00:25.600 --> 00:32.480]  Could it have something to do with the 55,000-page set of documents recently released by the FDA's
[00:32.480 --> 00:38.920]  Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, revealing to the public the data Pfizer submitted
[00:38.920 --> 00:44.160]  to the FDA from its clinical trials in support of a COVID-19 vaccine license?
[00:44.160 --> 00:50.120]  A big blow to the New World Order pandemic after U.S. District Judge Mark T. Pittman's
[00:50.120 --> 00:57.000]  denied the request from the FDA to suppress the data for the next 75 years, which the
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.960]  agency claimed was necessary, in part because of its limited resources.
[01:02.960 --> 01:06.920]  I have frequently said, you know, we're going to lead with the science.
[01:06.920 --> 01:09.440]  Science is going to be the foundation of everything we do.
[01:09.440 --> 01:11.440]  That is entirely true.
[01:11.440 --> 01:15.760]  I think public heard that as science is full proof.
[01:15.760 --> 01:18.200]  Science is black and white.
[01:18.200 --> 01:22.400]  Science is immediate and we get the answer and then we, you know, make the decision based
[01:22.400 --> 01:27.400]  on the answer and the truth is science is black and science is not always immediate
[01:27.400 --> 01:32.040]  and sometimes it takes months and years to actually find out the answer, but you have
[01:32.040 --> 01:35.720]  to make, you know, decisions in a pandemic before you have that answer.
[01:35.720 --> 01:42.240]  A 38-page report included in the documents features an appendix titled, List of Adverse
[01:42.240 --> 01:51.600]  Events of Special Interest, listing 1,291 different adverse events following vaccination.
[01:51.600 --> 01:59.720]  The list includes acute kidney injury, acute flaccid myelitis, anti-sperm antibody positive,
[01:59.720 --> 02:06.840]  brainstem embolism, brainstem thrombosis, cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, cardiogenic
[02:06.840 --> 02:14.200]  shock, death neonatal, deep vein thrombosis, encephalitis brainstem, front lobe epilepsy,
[02:14.200 --> 02:20.440]  pneumonia, stillbirth, tachycardia, temporal lobe epilepsy, and vertebral artery thrombosis
[02:20.440 --> 02:26.600]  among the 1,291 medical conditions following vaccination.
[02:26.600 --> 02:34.000]  It seems to indicate a break in the veil that may allow legal action basically due to fraud
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.360]  and concealment of these risks from the general public.
[02:38.360 --> 02:44.120]  This is why you have not been able to have full informed consent is they've hidden all
[02:44.120 --> 02:49.240]  this information from you and they've used all of the propaganda and censorship tools
[02:49.240 --> 02:55.680]  that you're about to cover and paid media to keep all this information from you and spin
[02:55.680 --> 03:01.480]  it so that you think that the left is the right and the up and the down is the up and
[03:01.480 --> 03:02.880]  the moon has made a green cheese.
[03:02.880 --> 03:07.080]  I'm an epidemiologist and people have asked me, Dr. McCullough, are the vaccines actually
[03:07.080 --> 03:08.920]  causing the deaths?
[03:08.920 --> 03:14.080]  The epidemiological construct that we have to go through is called the Bradford Hill
[03:14.080 --> 03:15.680]  Tennis of Causality.
[03:15.680 --> 03:18.680]  So the first question is, is it a large signal?
[03:18.680 --> 03:20.880]  Is it a large epidemiologic signal?
[03:20.880 --> 03:22.840]  And I tell you, it's astronomical.
[03:22.840 --> 03:27.480]  All the vaccines combined in the United States per year, it's no more than 150 deaths, not
[03:27.480 --> 03:32.880]  temporarily related, here we have over 21,000 deaths, so clearly it's a massive signal.
[03:32.880 --> 03:33.880]  Number one.
[03:33.880 --> 03:36.760]  Number two, is there a dangerous mechanism of action?
[03:36.760 --> 03:41.120]  The answer is yes, frankly, we know the vaccines have a dangerous mechanism of action.
[03:41.120 --> 03:43.600]  They install production of the spike protein.
[03:43.600 --> 03:48.200]  The spike protein is what makes the respiratory infection lethal and it follows that in some
[03:48.200 --> 03:53.200]  people excessive production of the spike protein in a vulnerable person would be lethal after
[03:53.200 --> 03:54.200]  a vaccine.
[03:54.200 --> 03:59.360]  And the third criteria is, is it internally consistent?
[03:59.360 --> 04:05.520]  Are there other conditions that are now acknowledged that they themselves could be fatal?
[04:05.520 --> 04:10.600]  And the answer is sure, with myocarditis, our FDA agrees, all the regulatory experts
[04:10.600 --> 04:13.200]  agree that the vaccines cause myocarditis.
[04:13.200 --> 04:14.200]  Can it be fatal?
[04:14.200 --> 04:15.200]  Yes.
[04:15.200 --> 04:16.920]  Have there been fatal cases published?
[04:16.920 --> 04:17.920]  Yes.
[04:17.920 --> 04:23.360]  There's over 1,000 peer-reviewed papers published on fatal and non-fatal outcomes, so that criteria
[04:23.360 --> 04:24.360]  is met.
[04:24.360 --> 04:30.680]  It is beyond any shadow of a doubt that the vaccines are causing large numbers of deaths.
[04:30.680 --> 04:36.520]  It's unequivocal, it is unassailable, those conclusions, and I'm a card-carrying epidemiologist.
[04:36.520 --> 04:40.520]  I'm telling you, the vaccines are causing large numbers of deaths.
[04:40.520 --> 04:45.800]  Maybe Dr. Fauci can crawl out of his hole and explain what he knew about the massive
[04:45.800 --> 04:51.280]  list of injuries that he had hoped would only be released long after he was gone.
[04:51.280 --> 05:02.120]  John Bowne reporting.
[05:02.120 --> 05:08.480]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022, and in the month of February,
[05:08.480 --> 05:14.520]  we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, X3, that has all
[05:14.520 --> 05:21.240]  three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity
[05:21.240 --> 05:26.760]  in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much, and the majority of
[05:26.760 --> 05:29.240]  the population of the world is iodine deficient.
[05:29.240 --> 05:31.560]  This is the very best iodine out there.
[05:31.560 --> 05:36.520]  So, we have on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or isn't going
[05:36.520 --> 05:40.880]  to come in for a long time, so I took it back to full products, and I was just thinking,
[05:40.880 --> 05:45.000]  you know what, we need the funds in now to stay on air, plus this is the right product
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.760]  everybody needs, so to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3
[05:49.760 --> 05:54.160]  an experience of yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off
[05:54.160 --> 05:55.640]  until it sells out.
[05:55.640 --> 06:07.200]  Get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[06:07.200 --> 06:34.760]  Well, you can mark your calendar, ladies and gentlemen, Tuesday, March 8, 2022 is the day
[06:34.760 --> 06:41.480]  the United States officially went to war with Russia.
[06:41.480 --> 06:42.840]  Welcome here to The Alex Jones Show.
[06:42.840 --> 06:48.360]  Last night, Tucker Carlson accurately pointed out that this proxy war that NATO started
[06:48.360 --> 06:55.800]  with Russia was now bleeding into a full-scale war, and when you block energy exports and
[06:55.800 --> 07:03.960]  you block imports into a country, that is the oldest form of war, it's called Siege.
[07:03.960 --> 07:12.960]  Putin has said just three days ago on the 5th that it would quote be a declaration of war
[07:12.960 --> 07:19.400]  if sanctions were put on Russia like banning the importation of gas and oil into Europe
[07:19.400 --> 07:23.280]  or the United States, that's the Washington Post, but I don't just believe them, I went
[07:23.280 --> 07:25.360]  and watched his press conference.
[07:25.360 --> 07:31.000]  Here's Sky News, NPR all reporting the same thing, Putin calls sanctions a declaration
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.680]  of war.
[07:33.680 --> 07:42.440]  And now, Biden just minutes ago officially announced a total ban on all Russian energy,
[07:42.440 --> 07:48.120]  and a bigger issue is that Europe imports about half its energy from Russia, they're
[07:48.120 --> 07:53.240]  announcing they're about to totally cut energy, do you have any idea what this means?
[07:53.240 --> 07:59.120]  Total absolute depression, and they're in the news, the head of the EU, the head of the
[07:59.120 --> 08:07.120]  World Economic Forum, the head of the UN, they're all saying they need tens of trillions
[08:07.120 --> 08:13.680]  in an emergency global bond to pay for everyone to transition to electric cars.
[08:13.680 --> 08:17.320]  Even if they had electric cars, that wouldn't work, because they've cut off the coal to
[08:17.320 --> 08:23.960]  burn to make the electricity, and now you know why Biden shut down more than 2,000 pipelines
[08:23.960 --> 08:29.920]  and pipeline spurs, including the Keystone pipeline as it was completed last year.
[08:29.920 --> 08:34.480]  I have a stack of news and video clips with world leaders saying, this is an opportunity,
[08:34.480 --> 08:39.840]  this is a transition to the great reset and build back better.
[08:39.840 --> 08:44.120]  But to build a new building, you've got to blow up the old one, but of course they're
[08:44.120 --> 08:49.360]  not sinking our ship here and then giving us another boat to get on, they're sinking
[08:49.360 --> 08:56.640]  us all into worldwide collapse, with a few companies able to keep operating to vertically
[08:56.640 --> 08:57.640]  integrate the world.
[08:57.640 --> 09:03.520]  They knew, I'm going to play a clip first of Biden and then of Lindsey Graham, Adam
[09:03.520 --> 09:08.920]  Schiff, and then Soros all bragging over the years how they were going to start a war,
[09:08.920 --> 09:16.600]  and we're starting a war with Russia, and they knew Putin gave them a month to announce
[09:16.600 --> 09:20.280]  that they would not take in Ukraine, and they were putting out the chatter that Ukraine
[09:20.280 --> 09:24.440]  was about to be brought into NATO, and that nuclear weapons were about to be stationed
[09:24.440 --> 09:28.880]  in Ukraine to manipulate Putin into invading.
[09:28.880 --> 09:34.680]  And I said Putin was manipulated into this, it's not a good idea, but his brother was
[09:34.680 --> 09:39.120]  killed being shelled by the Nazis in World War II, and of course he was born right after
[09:39.120 --> 09:46.400]  World War II, and he is very, very upset about armies on their borders, Russia is always
[09:46.400 --> 09:52.160]  getting invaded throughout history, and then winning when the chips are down, and that's
[09:52.160 --> 09:54.560]  where we are again, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:54.560 --> 10:02.240]  Biden got one thing right, usually when he screws up his foot in the mouth events are
[10:02.240 --> 10:06.800]  wrong, but this one was so wrong it was right.
[10:06.800 --> 10:14.840]  He said Putin invaded Russia, and no one's invaded Russia since World War II, well it's
[10:14.840 --> 10:20.080]  true nobody's invaded Russia since World War II, and it's also true that Putin invaded
[10:20.080 --> 10:25.880]  Russia, because Ukraine is where Russia was born, why do you think they call it Belarus,
[10:25.880 --> 10:30.320]  that just means white Russian, because you go each people get darker, they call them,
[10:30.320 --> 10:34.440]  those are the white Russians over there, what do you think Ukraine is, it's the white Russians
[10:34.440 --> 10:40.680]  as well, in fact it's had names in its past like that, the word slov comes from the founder
[10:40.680 --> 10:48.360]  of Ukraine in 900 and something, look it up, his name was slov, look it up, trouble pronouncing
[10:48.360 --> 10:56.960]  it, so that's where we are, and now Russia's committed ready for nuclear war, let me give
[10:56.960 --> 11:06.320]  you the big news here, there was a Pentagon drill, official war game in 2019 called the
[11:06.320 --> 11:12.600]  NATO Russia-Ukraine war, I'm going to show it to you in a moment, and they estimated
[11:12.600 --> 11:16.880]  the Pentagon did in this big supercomputer drill that it would lead to nuclear war at
[11:16.880 --> 11:22.400]  at least one billion dead, and now major think tanks say 10% chance nuclear war within a
[11:22.400 --> 11:30.400]  month, so that's on the low side a billion dead, so what did I say would come out of
[11:30.400 --> 11:36.520]  the great reset and come out of phase one, the virus, the tracker apps, the controls,
[11:36.520 --> 11:42.240]  then there would be a war, a cyber attack, conflict with Russia, and then China will
[11:42.240 --> 11:48.840]  move into Taiwan, and that's what's going on, war will cause hell on earth for global
[11:48.840 --> 11:53.240]  food prices, but really it's not even the war that's doing that right now, it was already
[11:53.240 --> 11:59.480]  done with the supply chains, but now they're blaming Putin, and he walked right into the
[11:59.480 --> 12:04.600]  trap of the great reset, and I said that when it started a few weeks ago, when it started
[12:04.600 --> 12:11.480]  14 days ago, and I say it again now, but now if Russia pulls out, they'll pour even more
[12:11.480 --> 12:16.280]  weapons into Ukraine, and accelerate that war with Russia, and that'll go right back
[12:16.280 --> 12:21.000]  to where we are, and they've got the former head of NATO, they've got a bunch of former
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.440]  British and U.S. generals all over the news, I got a stack up right here saying, time to
[12:25.440 --> 12:30.200]  go ahead and just have war with Russia, time to go ahead and just send in the U.S. military,
[12:30.200 --> 12:34.520]  time to take the A-10s out of mothballs and just kill all the Russians, well the Russians
[12:34.520 --> 12:38.720]  will then use tactical nuclear weapons on Poland or anywhere else in those aircraft
[12:38.720 --> 12:45.120]  or station, but see the globalists are going to go to their bunkers while we die on the
[12:45.120 --> 12:51.400]  surface, this is their great reset, they said 90% de-population by 2030, they're not playing
[12:51.400 --> 12:56.400]  games, that's official world economic forum policy, and they're the mouthpiece of the
[12:56.400 --> 13:02.840]  globalist, so don't you see they mean business?
[13:02.840 --> 13:07.000]  Let's go ahead and roll a clip here of Biden just about 30 minutes ago.
[13:07.000 --> 13:12.760]  Today I'm announcing the United States is targeting the main artery of Russia's economy, we're
[13:12.760 --> 13:18.400]  banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy, that means Russian oil will no
[13:18.400 --> 13:23.640]  longer be acceptable at U.S. ports and the American people will deal another powerful
[13:23.640 --> 13:26.560]  blow to Putin's war machine.
[13:26.560 --> 13:30.520]  This is a move that has strong bipartisan support with Congress and I believe in the
[13:30.520 --> 13:36.120]  country, America's have rallied to support the Ukrainian people and made it clear we
[13:36.120 --> 13:40.480]  will not be part of subsidizing Putin's war.
[13:40.480 --> 13:44.480]  This made, we made this decision in close consultation with our allies and our partners
[13:44.480 --> 13:49.400]  around the world, particularly in Europe, because a united response to Putin's aggression
[13:49.400 --> 13:57.240]  has been my overriding focus to keep all NATO and all of the EU and our allies totally
[13:57.240 --> 13:58.240]  united.
[13:58.240 --> 14:04.520]  All right, when we come back I have a clip of him in 97 saying any move into Ukraine
[14:04.520 --> 14:08.360]  would be an active war and Russia would respond with an active war, he believes World War
[14:08.360 --> 14:12.320]  III could start there, they know what they're doing, they started this, the head of the
[14:12.320 --> 14:17.320]  CFR, once a war, this is psychotic, here they are bragging about the war, they've helped
[14:17.320 --> 14:18.320]  start in Ukraine.
[14:18.320 --> 14:31.320]  The fight is our fight, 2017 will be the year of offense, all of us will go back to Washington
[14:31.320 --> 14:45.520]  and we will push the case against Russia, enough of a Russian aggression, it is time
[14:45.520 --> 14:50.520]  for them to pay a heavier price.
[14:50.520 --> 14:55.880]  The United States aides Ukraine and her people so that we can fight Russia over there and
[14:55.880 --> 14:58.480]  we don't have to fight Russia here.
[14:58.480 --> 15:09.840]  And the Soviet Union, the Soviet Empire collapsed and as the Empire collapsed, I moved in and
[15:09.840 --> 15:25.440]  picked up the pieces, first in Hungary in 1984 and then Poland in 1987, China in 1987 as well.
[15:25.440 --> 15:37.600]  So this is how the Soviet Empire was replacing the Soviet Empire.
[15:37.600 --> 15:41.400]  How do you think you're doing in your imperial ambitions?
[15:41.400 --> 15:45.320]  So there you go, they're all starting a war, they all know exactly what they've done,
[15:45.320 --> 15:50.360]  Putin's walked in to the trap and now we're all going to pay with a giant depression and
[15:50.360 --> 15:53.800]  they're going to use that as their great reset, so get ready ladies and gentlemen, they think
[15:53.800 --> 16:00.800]  you're stupid and they think you don't know, it's them doing it to us.
[16:00.800 --> 16:06.160]  Two of our best selling products are back in stock, them FullWarStore.com and they will
[16:06.160 --> 16:09.840]  sell out in the next three, four months before I get more of the product in if I sell it
[16:09.840 --> 16:10.840]  at full price.
[16:10.840 --> 16:15.560]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting Winter Son or getting
[16:15.560 --> 16:21.800]  X3 to try the products and see how amazing they are and I believe you will then get hooked
[16:21.800 --> 16:26.640]  on them like myself, my family and the crew are, so again, both these products are back
[16:26.640 --> 16:33.120]  in stock, both X3 and Winter Son, they are 50% off for a limited time because they're
[16:33.120 --> 16:39.280]  going to sell out at this price I would estimate in less than a month, so this is your chance
[16:39.280 --> 16:43.320]  to get X3 and experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens, this is your chance
[16:43.320 --> 16:47.800]  to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your muses as well, they're
[16:47.800 --> 16:49.800]  amazing and they're at FullWarStore.com.
[16:49.800 --> 16:56.160]  And the reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation, I need funds to run the operation,
[16:56.160 --> 17:01.040]  you need to be healthy, we need to stay on air, it's a match made in heaven.
[17:01.040 --> 17:06.480]  I stay on air selling high quality products that you need, that you want and that you're
[17:06.480 --> 17:11.120]  going to be happy with, that's why you come back and buy products from me again, it's
[17:11.120 --> 17:16.160]  a symbiotic relationship, I promote liberty, I promote freedom, I fight the globalist and
[17:16.160 --> 17:20.600]  I'm able to do that because you buy products at InfoWarStore.com and listen, all the products
[17:20.600 --> 17:25.960]  are great, but when it comes to high quality storeable food in an inflationary system with
[17:25.960 --> 17:32.080]  major supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute 360 win and no brainer and they've
[17:32.080 --> 17:36.080]  got high quality storeable food ready to ship to you right now, the great folks at my page
[17:36.080 --> 17:42.680]  of supply exclusively for ParallelX.com discounted, so again, be in inflation, be prepared, fund
[17:42.680 --> 17:48.080]  the InfoWar, the only way you lose is not taking action at InfoWarStore.com or prepare
[17:48.080 --> 17:53.880]  with Alex.com right now, this is high quality storeable food, this is how you beat inflation,
[17:53.880 --> 17:57.320]  get yours today, it's ready to ship, but I wouldn't wait because prices are about to
[17:57.320 --> 17:59.320]  go up because inflation is exploding.
[17:59.320 --> 18:02.640]  With the world awakening, I think what's important that we were right though, to prevent them
[18:02.640 --> 18:06.320]  right now, take advantage of this moment and I've always had an idea that something everybody
[18:06.320 --> 18:10.720]  can do, that every listener can do, I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to
[18:10.720 --> 18:15.360]  hang banners over highways, imagine a giant bean or a piece of land up there, it says
[18:15.360 --> 18:20.200]  Alex Jones is right, InfoWarStore.com, we stand with the truckers, a rest out or whatever
[18:20.200 --> 18:21.200]  it is.
[18:21.200 --> 18:24.560]  Brother, I'm so glad you called, elaborate on this, yes, now is the time in your small
[18:24.560 --> 18:28.720]  town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on
[18:28.720 --> 18:34.680]  your car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain reaction, what do you recommend
[18:34.680 --> 18:36.080]  people say on these banner hangs?
[18:36.080 --> 18:40.920]  I have a few ideas, first of all, health checks is really important, don't farm, rest out,
[18:40.920 --> 18:44.760]  rest out, swap, the vaccine is poison, there's tons of things, I say just keep it short,
[18:44.760 --> 18:45.760]  keep it concise.
[18:45.760 --> 18:50.160]  Don't agree, arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates, the COVID-vaxx is poison, beautiful.
[18:50.160 --> 18:53.640]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved and we could all be effective though, that's
[18:53.640 --> 18:54.640]  what I'm calling about.
[18:54.640 --> 18:58.920]  God bless you Chris, in Atlanta I really, really appreciate you calling us today, thank
[18:58.920 --> 18:59.920]  you so much.
[18:59.920 --> 19:05.400]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games, I like going to concerts,
[19:05.400 --> 19:08.160]  I like going to play golf, I like going out to dinner.
[19:08.160 --> 19:14.520]  I like the metropolitan life, I like everything that comes with this, but see I have the survival
[19:14.520 --> 19:20.520]  instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan
[19:20.520 --> 19:25.640]  areas, because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down, is it time to just
[19:25.640 --> 19:29.160]  move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in the woods, just get
[19:29.160 --> 19:33.240]  off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the land, that's the survival
[19:33.240 --> 19:37.240]  instinct, but see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says
[19:37.240 --> 19:41.680]  no, no, no, no, no, stay in the city, the survival instinct says get the hell out of
[19:41.680 --> 19:45.960]  anywhere they've ever noticed that you need to get a vaccine or a mask, that's the internal
[19:45.960 --> 19:51.400]  struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well, but you can
[19:51.400 --> 19:56.200]  at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies and so we have the
[19:56.200 --> 20:01.920]  best ones at m4store.com.
[20:01.920 --> 20:09.920]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:09.920 --> 20:20.240]  Well, welcome to a front row seat to Armageddon nuclear war is on the table.
[20:20.240 --> 20:22.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[20:22.000 --> 20:26.280]  You know, we would have Lee strain a hand on and a lot of other expert guests over the
[20:26.280 --> 20:31.320]  years about Ukraine and how the West was using it as a money laundering operation and how
[20:31.320 --> 20:38.280]  they were building up stay behind networks and paramilitary troops trained by army special
[20:38.280 --> 20:43.080]  operations and others to lure the Russians in to a trap.
[20:43.080 --> 20:47.960]  I mean, I know a lot of people who've been over there for more than a decade before the
[20:47.960 --> 20:54.800]  West even overthrew the Russian backed elected leader who've been over there preparing this.
[20:54.800 --> 20:56.560]  People ask, well, why'd they let the Russians in?
[20:56.560 --> 20:58.360]  Why didn't they stop them out at the border?
[20:58.360 --> 20:59.360]  Where were the tank traps?
[20:59.360 --> 21:00.360]  Where were the mines?
[21:00.360 --> 21:05.400]  Well, they were luring them in to attack them with thousands of anti tank missiles and anti
[21:05.400 --> 21:08.240]  aircraft missiles.
[21:08.240 --> 21:16.640]  And then more hardware is being poured in out of the West out of Poland.
[21:16.640 --> 21:19.480]  And Poland understands that Russia could target them over this like, oh, no, no, we're not
[21:19.480 --> 21:24.760]  going to give fodder jets to Ukraine and then quote, have the secretary of state backfill
[21:24.760 --> 21:25.760]  it.
[21:25.760 --> 21:29.360]  And so, okay, you give them your billions in jets and then we'll just give you jets
[21:29.360 --> 21:30.360]  to replace those.
[21:30.360 --> 21:31.360]  It's the same thing.
[21:31.360 --> 21:34.520]  Oh, we're not going to give Ukraine jets to fight Russia.
[21:34.520 --> 21:39.760]  Poland is and then we'll replace their old jets with new jets.
[21:39.760 --> 21:43.600]  And Labyrinth and Putin came out yesterday and said that's an act of war.
[21:43.600 --> 21:47.360]  They said it two days ago and they bombed all the Ukrainian airfields.
[21:47.360 --> 21:49.640]  They didn't want to destroy those before.
[21:49.640 --> 21:52.960]  They do just want to kick NATO out of there.
[21:52.960 --> 21:56.760]  And I'm not defending the Russian position, but I understand it.
[21:56.760 --> 22:01.040]  And it was well known in all the big tank tanks that doing this would make Russia go
[22:01.040 --> 22:07.160]  in and Putin kept warning and kept warning and he said two weeks ago on the eve of this,
[22:07.160 --> 22:15.520]  just say that you're not going to bring Ukraine into NATO and I will not invade and stop shelling
[22:15.520 --> 22:21.560]  the East and stop trying to infiltrate the sabotage in the South area there at the port
[22:21.560 --> 22:31.080]  they've got the Russia annexed in eight years ago because the West and Soros bragged that
[22:31.080 --> 22:33.840]  they overthrew Ukraine.
[22:33.840 --> 22:37.680]  Why does Richard Enhance of the CFR bragged that they overthrew Ukraine?
[22:37.680 --> 22:43.480]  Why does all these different globalists say this and talk about it?
[22:43.480 --> 22:47.560]  Why does the big resistance before he died bragged?
[22:47.560 --> 22:52.240]  Why does Soros bragged?
[22:52.240 --> 22:58.440]  Because they want to piss the Russians off to invade and they got them to do it.
[22:58.440 --> 23:03.640]  So people are all in two camps two weeks ago, either Alex, you should be pro-Putin.
[23:03.640 --> 23:04.640]  He's fighting the globalists.
[23:04.640 --> 23:09.640]  He's tired of being pushed around and Russia's Christian now and you should be for Putin.
[23:09.640 --> 23:11.640]  Or he's the worst guy on earth.
[23:11.640 --> 23:14.840]  We should start bombing Russian troops and have World War III.
[23:14.840 --> 23:21.120]  Not for that either because I see 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20 moves out and it's not
[23:21.120 --> 23:22.280]  hard to see this.
[23:22.280 --> 23:25.320]  I told you a month ago war started.
[23:25.320 --> 23:29.320]  They would cut off the energy worldwide, use that as the pretext to cover up for the supply
[23:29.320 --> 23:35.000]  chain breakdowns that had already happened.
[23:35.000 --> 23:40.160]  And folks this is so simple and now they're saying oh the energy prices are high, oh the
[23:40.160 --> 23:43.560]  food isn't getting delivered, oh the Third World starving the death, not because of two
[23:43.560 --> 23:50.800]  years of lockdowns in the Third World or the IMF World Bank ordered it, no because of Putin
[23:50.800 --> 23:55.840]  and then Biden doesn't let the U.S. drill in the Gulf, he kills all the new oil leases
[23:55.840 --> 24:02.240]  on public lands, many on private lands, he kills the Keystone Pipeline, they kill it all.
[24:02.240 --> 24:07.280]  And now they stop all Russian energy imports into the United States.
[24:07.280 --> 24:11.280]  There's a lot of mines that they don't even allow in the U.S. under the FDA, under the
[24:11.280 --> 24:16.880]  EPA, excuse me, a lot of the rare earth minerals we get are from Russia, none of that is allowed
[24:16.880 --> 24:18.640]  now in.
[24:18.640 --> 24:21.760]  And that's going to hurt America further, but don't worry Russia's now going to sell
[24:21.760 --> 24:28.120]  everything to who, to who, China and they're going on the Chinese digital currency now
[24:28.120 --> 24:32.520]  and they're going to sell all their oil to China now and China will have energy and China
[24:32.520 --> 24:39.320]  will have rare earth minerals, but we'll have nothing, you'll owe nothing, you'll have nothing
[24:39.320 --> 24:42.120]  and you'll like it.
[24:42.120 --> 24:45.600]  That's why I had a Buddha judge in the head of the energy department and all of them said
[24:45.600 --> 24:54.000]  oh it's a transition, all being done by design, squeezing the little guy, just like the lockdowns,
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.400]  oh your small company is not essential, oh your business is not essential, but the big
[24:58.400 --> 25:00.200]  companies they are essential.
[25:00.200 --> 25:06.000]  Here's Biden, who really going back to being a senator was the globalist in charge of Ukraine,
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.200]  it's kind of like his little duchy, his little fiefdom, his little area that he runs for
[25:10.200 --> 25:17.360]  the bosses and here he is saying that oh, if we bring Ukraine in, that's the red line
[25:17.360 --> 25:19.680]  for Russia, here it is.
[25:19.680 --> 25:27.600]  I think the one place where the greatest consternation would be caused in the short term for admission,
[25:27.600 --> 25:32.800]  having nothing to do with the merit and preparedness of the country to come in would be to admit
[25:32.800 --> 25:40.760]  the Baltic states now in terms of NATO, Russian, U.S., Russian relations and if there was ever
[25:40.760 --> 25:46.680]  anything that was going to tip the balance were to be tipped in terms of a vigorous and
[25:46.680 --> 25:52.040]  hostile reaction, I don't mean military in Russia, it would be that.
[25:52.040 --> 25:58.000]  So the way I look at the calculus here, all right so there you go ladies and gentlemen
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.920]  and what was happening around that time, they were bombing Belgrade and bombing Serbia
[26:01.920 --> 26:07.000]  and they gave one third of Serbia to the Muslims, the Albanians, to ethnically cleanse and
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.240]  the Russians sent in Russian troops into the Pristina airfield to stop the full handover
[26:12.240 --> 26:16.240]  of the country to the Muslims.
[26:16.240 --> 26:21.840]  So they know exactly what they've been doing the whole time, MTG is going to pop in with
[26:21.840 --> 26:26.400]  some breaking news and a bill she's introduced and her take on a lot of issues in the next
[26:26.400 --> 26:30.400]  segment and then I'm going to continue on with our World War III coverage but I can
[26:30.400 --> 26:36.120]  tell you this, I was scheduled and I'm still going right now to go to California next week
[26:36.120 --> 26:40.840]  to be on some really big podcast and interview some huge folks and do some other meetings
[26:40.840 --> 26:45.080]  and things and I'm probably still going to go but I'm watching this very carefully, things
[26:45.080 --> 26:50.160]  are so dangerous, World War III kick off, I may not go, I mean that's how dangerous
[26:50.160 --> 26:58.040]  and how bad the situation is and just believe me, I got some interviews set up out there
[26:58.040 --> 27:03.120]  that will break the Internet, it will be as big as my Joe Rogan podcast, I mean how could
[27:03.120 --> 27:08.240]  you top that, well use your head, there's not many ways to.
[27:08.240 --> 27:15.440]  So it's that serious, I legitimately know and believe there's a good chance we're going
[27:15.440 --> 27:19.920]  to see a regional war break out and then a nuclear war, it's the great reset, they want
[27:19.920 --> 27:27.160]  to get to 90% population reduction by 2030, that's the official goal and they're implementing
[27:27.160 --> 27:31.840]  everything they can so they think you're dumb and will think of the breakdown of civilization
[27:31.840 --> 27:36.480]  and the energy prices exploding and the food prices exploding and all the hyperinflation
[27:36.480 --> 27:41.800]  is because of Putin, not because of the great reset, not because of Fauci, not because of
[27:41.800 --> 27:46.200]  Klaus Schwab, not because of Bill Gates, they're the architect of this takeover with
[27:46.200 --> 27:51.920]  the Chinese, Gates is building nuclear reactors, the newest in China, they got new coal plants
[27:51.920 --> 27:58.620]  opening every week, they're open for business, we're closed for business, we're under attack
[27:58.620 --> 28:02.400]  just like the Russians are, they want to have Americans and Europeans kill each other with
[28:02.400 --> 28:08.000]  the Russians while China takes over the world, that's why Trump said hey we ought to bomb
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.400]  the Russians and say it was a Chinese, he said that it's a joke but that's what they're
[28:11.400 --> 28:17.320]  getting us to do is bomb our own energy, bomb our own food prices, bomb our own dollar value
[28:17.320 --> 28:22.280]  in this big lie, so this is the next political distraction, we always ask if they're killing
[28:22.280 --> 28:25.200]  us with all these shots and it's coming out that they're deadly and how will they smoke
[28:25.200 --> 28:30.240]  screen and I said a big war and a financial collapse and that's it and we're here, I told
[28:30.240 --> 28:38.480]  you thousands of times, every show multiple times, over and over and over and over, get
[28:38.480 --> 28:44.760]  ready to crawl in a hole and dive radiation poisoning, okay, because we are a satanic
[28:44.760 --> 28:48.960]  nation and we killed 60 million babies, if we don't repent now and if we don't change
[28:48.960 --> 28:55.080]  our ways now, most of us are dead, you understand that, you're all dead, Klaus Schwab's gonna
[28:55.080 --> 28:57.800]  murder you.
[28:57.800 --> 29:06.720]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022 and in the month of February we
[29:06.720 --> 29:12.960]  had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product X3 that has all three
[29:12.960 --> 29:19.560]  types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity
[29:19.560 --> 29:25.120]  in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much and the majority of the
[29:25.120 --> 29:30.680]  population of the world is iodine deficient, this is the very best iodine output, so we
[29:30.680 --> 29:35.120]  had on sale 50% off but we sold more than half of what we have or isn't gonna come in
[29:35.120 --> 29:39.960]  for a long time so I took it back to full process, I was just thinking, you know what,
[29:39.960 --> 29:44.720]  we need to funds in now to stay on air, plus this is a great product everybody needs so
[29:44.720 --> 29:49.320]  to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it yourself
[29:49.320 --> 29:54.920]  and support the broadcast, I'm gonna keep it at 50% off until it sells out, get X3 right
[29:54.920 --> 29:59.440]  now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[29:59.440 --> 30:06.000]  It has been noted by many a historian, the first casualty of war is the truth and the
[30:06.000 --> 30:13.240]  next big casualty isn't even the people that die, no that invariably follows, but first
[30:13.240 --> 30:20.920]  there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and massive censorship
[30:20.920 --> 30:26.680]  and now across the world from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[30:26.680 --> 30:36.640]  that if you amplify any quote pro-Russian information, you can be censored, you can be arrested,
[30:36.640 --> 30:41.640]  you can be imprisoned and of course now Canada is under this legislation that if you have
[30:41.640 --> 30:48.400]  a thought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online
[30:48.400 --> 30:53.040]  that you will be censored and arrested, ladies and gentlemen the authoritarianism is being
[30:53.040 --> 30:58.000]  carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes infowars.com more
[30:58.000 --> 31:01.000]  important than ever.
[31:01.000 --> 31:06.120]  So I did it, I signed up for the Austin Marathon, I've been training probably not as much as
[31:06.120 --> 31:11.040]  they should be but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com, before
[31:11.040 --> 31:16.760]  I set out on a run I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get
[31:16.760 --> 31:22.360]  going you know besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin
[31:22.360 --> 31:27.960]  C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy
[31:27.960 --> 31:32.360]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training and then every day now I'm taking
[31:32.360 --> 31:38.520]  Dr. Jones' sore list, I have bad joints, thanks mom, so this is great for giving my joints
[31:38.520 --> 31:43.800]  the extra support they need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[31:43.800 --> 31:48.400]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training, even
[31:48.400 --> 31:53.440]  if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, turbo force that can still give
[31:53.440 --> 31:57.720]  you the energy and clarity you need for every day and sore list can keep you moving and
[31:57.720 --> 31:59.520]  feeling great at any age.
[31:59.520 --> 32:04.840]  The first ten amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791.
[32:04.840 --> 32:09.760]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press.
[32:09.760 --> 32:16.000]  Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference
[32:16.000 --> 32:18.680]  and restraint by the government.
[32:18.680 --> 32:25.000]  231 years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious attack.
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.680]  GCN is under attack.
[32:27.680 --> 32:32.320]  Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not want you to know the truth.
[32:32.320 --> 32:38.480]  I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up and help us defend our right to
[32:38.480 --> 32:40.680]  continue telling you the truth.
[32:40.680 --> 32:42.160]  Would you like to join us?
[32:42.160 --> 32:50.280]  If so, please consider visiting savegcn.com.
[32:50.280 --> 32:54.800]  You may click follow, share, give and pray.
[32:54.800 --> 32:56.880]  You may select all of those choices.
[32:56.880 --> 33:01.080]  I'm Vincent Finnelli.
[33:01.080 --> 33:20.760]  Pleading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:20.760 --> 33:25.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:25.240 --> 33:38.160]  You are listening to Alex Jones.
[33:38.160 --> 33:41.600]  Well we've got a lot to cover in this short 10 minute segment.
[33:41.600 --> 33:45.440]  Thank you so much for joining us on this March 8th, Tuesday edition.
[33:45.440 --> 33:50.080]  Coming up after Marjorie Taylor Greene leaves us in about 10 minutes, we're going to hit
[33:50.080 --> 33:56.320]  with the active war Putin is saying with Biden cutting off any imports of Russian oil or gas
[33:56.320 --> 33:58.880]  or many other things as well.
[33:58.880 --> 34:01.440]  Europe says they're going to follow suit.
[34:01.440 --> 34:06.200]  I don't support Putin invading, but at the same time I don't support sending troops in
[34:06.200 --> 34:08.360]  and this going into a full scale war.
[34:08.360 --> 34:13.720]  I want to get MTG's take on that and then a new bill she's introduced that will absolutely
[34:13.720 --> 34:18.880]  bring accountability to how these voting scams are going on, not just across the country
[34:18.880 --> 34:24.560]  but particularly inside the House of Representatives itself and so much more.
[34:24.560 --> 34:26.600]  So it's great to have you back with us Congresswoman.
[34:26.600 --> 34:30.680]  Hi Alex, it's great to be back on with you today.
[34:30.680 --> 34:32.480]  Well you've got the floor, we've only got about 9 minutes.
[34:32.480 --> 34:33.480]  Where do you want to start?
[34:33.480 --> 34:38.120]  Well I just want to comment on something you just said and I think it's so important to
[34:38.120 --> 34:39.280]  talk about it.
[34:39.280 --> 34:41.720]  I actually fully agree with you.
[34:41.720 --> 34:46.560]  I do not at all support what Putin is doing with his Russian troops.
[34:46.560 --> 34:49.640]  They've invaded Ukraine and many innocent people have died.
[34:49.640 --> 34:58.240]  I think the death toll is somewhere over 400 of civilians and while we're completely against
[34:58.240 --> 35:03.480]  that, I think the decisions that are being made right now are going to further isolate
[35:03.480 --> 35:09.680]  Putin and push him into the arms of China and I think that is a great mistake.
[35:09.680 --> 35:16.480]  I think that the Biden administration is handling this all wrong and sadly all I hear is,
[35:16.480 --> 35:22.120]  the drums of war here in Washington and I'm completely against foreign wars.
[35:22.120 --> 35:27.480]  I don't think that's where we should be spending our tax dollars and I believe we should be
[35:27.480 --> 35:34.400]  working very hard in Washington to make the American tax dollars work for our country.
[35:34.400 --> 35:37.440]  For example, our border, we should have a secure border.
[35:37.440 --> 35:39.240]  We have out of control inflation.
[35:39.240 --> 35:45.800]  We have rising crime that is so high in many cities and now gas prices are out of control.
[35:45.800 --> 35:49.280]  We should be working hard on our own energy independence.
[35:49.280 --> 35:50.680]  We should be building nuclear.
[35:50.680 --> 35:52.600]  We should be drilling oil and gas.
[35:52.600 --> 35:58.600]  We should be pursuing everything we can to help America and we're not doing that and
[35:58.600 --> 36:04.160]  I'm not seeing any of that in the bills that I'm reading so it's very unfortunate.
[36:04.160 --> 36:10.360]  I think that the Biden administration is pushing us into a very bad place in the world where
[36:10.360 --> 36:16.480]  China's currency could be the currency that dominates over the dollar and that's the future
[36:16.480 --> 36:19.440]  that I see with these bad decisions being made.
[36:19.440 --> 36:20.940]  Absolutely.
[36:20.940 --> 36:24.000]  When you were in studio with us a few weeks ago, you talked about this and said you introduced
[36:24.000 --> 36:25.000]  a bill.
[36:25.000 --> 36:26.600]  You've done it today.
[36:26.600 --> 36:28.720]  It's breaking news right now.
[36:28.720 --> 36:34.360]  People can find the press release in your congressional site but tell us about this new bill you've
[36:34.360 --> 36:35.360]  introduced.
[36:35.360 --> 36:38.840]  Well, my bill is the Congressional Voting Accountability Act.
[36:38.840 --> 36:40.480]  I'm very excited about it.
[36:40.480 --> 36:44.120]  Since I've been a member of Congress, I've spent a lot of time on the House floor calling
[36:44.120 --> 36:50.360]  for recorded votes and the reason why this bill is so important is it would stop Congress
[36:50.360 --> 36:53.760]  from passing bills by voice vote.
[36:53.760 --> 36:57.720]  That's where just there's a handful of members of Congress sitting on the House floor and
[36:57.720 --> 36:59.680]  they simply say yes and no.
[36:59.680 --> 37:05.720]  Well, there's 435 members of Congress, Alex, and this bill would force every single member
[37:05.720 --> 37:11.360]  of Congress to actually have to vote and not vote by proxy, show up to work and vote in
[37:11.360 --> 37:17.240]  person and on record so the American people can see our job performance.
[37:17.240 --> 37:21.960]  Our votes are our job performance and whether you're a Democrat or Republican, independent,
[37:21.960 --> 37:27.200]  or you just don't even have a party you like, every single American and taxpayer should
[37:27.200 --> 37:33.240]  be able to look up Congress and look at what our voting record is on every single bill.
[37:33.240 --> 37:38.400]  That's why I'm so excited to introduce this bill because I believe it's very important.
[37:38.400 --> 37:42.480]  Most people when they hear the fact that they are voting without there being a record in
[37:42.480 --> 37:44.080]  many cases can't believe that.
[37:44.080 --> 37:45.760]  I mean, that is just amazing.
[37:45.760 --> 37:49.120]  Do we know how long they've been pulling this trick?
[37:49.120 --> 37:54.920]  They've been doing it for decades and decades and when you realize that they have been passing
[37:54.920 --> 37:59.320]  bills, which is, I mean, I've seen it happen with two members of Congress in the House
[37:59.320 --> 38:02.200]  chamber, two people saying yes and no.
[38:02.200 --> 38:06.960]  I have watched them try to pass bills like that and every single time I've risen to the
[38:06.960 --> 38:12.000]  microphone and interrupted and asked for the recorded votes, that's the only way we can
[38:12.000 --> 38:17.160]  get the bills on record, forcing Congress to vote and I've done that over the past year
[38:17.160 --> 38:25.320]  and we have over 500 bills now for the 117th Congress that Congress actually voted on record
[38:25.320 --> 38:31.040]  and this is the first time in decades, years and years that it's been that way and most
[38:31.040 --> 38:34.000]  people don't even know this story that's been happening.
[38:34.000 --> 38:39.520]  So I've introduced this bill and there's not a member in Congress that should be against
[38:39.520 --> 38:44.280]  this bill because I believe everyone that they represent in their district all across
[38:44.280 --> 38:48.840]  the United States will want them to cosponsor this bill and get it passed.
[38:48.840 --> 38:49.840]  Absolutely.
[38:49.840 --> 38:51.880]  The copy I've got doesn't have a number yet.
[38:51.880 --> 38:55.320]  Do we know what H-res it's going to be?
[38:55.320 --> 38:57.360]  We don't have an assigned number yet.
[38:57.360 --> 39:02.600]  It's being dropped today and then once that happens they'll assign a number and I'll definitely
[39:02.600 --> 39:07.680]  let you know so that your viewers and all of your followers can track it.
[39:07.680 --> 39:13.480]  Well I really appreciate you breaking this news here and how do people follow what you're
[39:13.480 --> 39:17.320]  doing, how do people get behind the different initiatives you're involved in because I follow
[39:17.320 --> 39:21.400]  it, I know how effective you are at exposing the mass mandates in Congress which they're
[39:21.400 --> 39:26.880]  starting to back off of, in exposing how they're running these voting scams, in exposing how
[39:26.880 --> 39:30.760]  they're not releasing the bills till right before the vote, procedurally you've been
[39:30.760 --> 39:35.400]  there demanding this over and over again and forcing them to do the right thing but you're
[39:35.400 --> 39:40.280]  now trying to change the actual laws so they're made to do this and then they sell this idea
[39:40.280 --> 39:43.320]  that you're ineffectual because they kept you off committees.
[39:43.320 --> 39:48.320]  No, that's because you are effective and you won with the biggest landslide of anybody
[39:48.320 --> 39:52.640]  when you ran last and you're an example of what they fear, that's why they say you're
[39:52.640 --> 39:56.520]  ineffective, that's why they say you're a loser, that's why they say you're crazy because it's
[39:56.520 --> 39:59.040]  the opposite.
[39:59.040 --> 40:04.960]  That's right, well they have to tell these lies because I am effective and if any Republican
[40:04.960 --> 40:10.640]  on committees was effective right now then we would see big changes in our country.
[40:10.640 --> 40:15.120]  It's just proof the fact that things are so bad in our country right now are proof that
[40:15.120 --> 40:20.160]  no Republican is effective in Congress but actually putting Congress on record is being
[40:20.160 --> 40:24.760]  effective and I've worked very hard to do that and I'm so glad that I've had my colleagues
[40:24.760 --> 40:30.000]  in the House Freedom Caucus join me in this effort but now we need to get this bill passed
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.000]  and I'll be pushing it around and seeing if I can get more cosponsors and continue to
[40:35.000 --> 40:40.200]  put the pressure on for everyone to vote for this bill because Congress needs to show the
[40:40.200 --> 40:45.560]  taxpayers what they do at work and that's why we have to get this one done.
[40:45.560 --> 40:49.800]  Now I'll tell you something else Alex, if people really want to put the pressure on
[40:49.800 --> 40:54.000]  my colleagues to pass the bill, I've got a phone number that people can call and you
[40:54.000 --> 40:59.920]  can call the congressional switchboard and ask to speak to any representative, your representative
[40:59.920 --> 41:13.200]  no matter where you live in the country and that phone number is 202-225-3121-202-225-3121
[41:13.200 --> 41:18.160]  and all you have to do is ask for your representative's office, you can talk to them in their office
[41:18.160 --> 41:24.160]  and tell them to vote for my bill, the Congressional Voting Accountability Act.
[41:24.160 --> 41:29.160]  Absolutely and I mean they count a phone call as if it's a thousand constituents, call,
[41:29.160 --> 41:36.400]  be polite but this is a very important thing to do because so many neocons pose as patriots
[41:36.400 --> 41:42.680]  and go and vote by voice so that there's not a record, this bill will make it be on record.
[41:42.680 --> 41:47.120]  That'd be like if you had a son or daughter that was 16 and you give them a credit card
[41:47.120 --> 41:50.720]  but it's your credit card and they don't want you to see the bill and don't want to know
[41:50.720 --> 41:51.720]  what they've been doing.
[41:51.720 --> 41:57.840]  I mean it's very suspicious and it's obviously something they're using so they can hide from
[41:57.840 --> 42:03.000]  their constituents what they're really up to so we get no report card on these people.
[42:03.000 --> 42:09.040]  Exactly and now it makes sense why we're $30 trillion in debt and everything is getting
[42:09.040 --> 42:10.680]  worse and worse in America.
[42:10.680 --> 42:16.520]  I gotta tell you something today Alex, we're waiting on the bill tax for the $1.5 trillion
[42:16.520 --> 42:18.560]  dollar omnibus bill today.
[42:18.560 --> 42:23.000]  When I left my office just a little while ago, only 53 pages were out.
[42:23.000 --> 42:28.360]  This bill is going to be thousands of pages, $1.5 trillion and Congress is supposed to
[42:28.360 --> 42:34.960]  vote on this bill tomorrow so this place is broken, Congress is broken, it does not work.
[42:34.960 --> 42:36.200]  There's wholesale robbery going on.
[42:36.200 --> 42:39.520]  You said you can do one more segment, that's great because I want to get into the omnibus
[42:39.520 --> 42:40.520]  bill.
[42:40.520 --> 42:41.520]  That's actually where I was going to go next.
[42:41.520 --> 42:45.080]  More on Russia, more on the economy, more on Biden where it's all going and this big
[42:45.080 --> 42:49.360]  lie all over the news that you said attack trans people.
[42:49.360 --> 42:53.880]  That's not what you said and we'll come back and set the record straight, of course they're
[42:53.880 --> 43:00.800]  going to lie even more but we'll break it all down, stay with us MTG.
[43:00.800 --> 43:07.160]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022 and in the month of February we
[43:07.160 --> 43:13.400]  had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product X3 that has all three
[43:13.400 --> 43:20.000]  types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity
[43:20.000 --> 43:25.520]  in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much and the majority of the
[43:25.520 --> 43:28.080]  population of the world is iodine deficient.
[43:28.080 --> 43:30.320]  This is the very best iodine out there.
[43:30.320 --> 43:35.200]  So we had on self-pity for some but we sold more than half of what we have or isn't going
[43:35.200 --> 43:39.600]  to come in for a long time so I took it back to full process and I was just thinking you
[43:39.600 --> 43:40.600]  know what?
[43:40.600 --> 43:46.320]  The funds in now to stay on air plus this is a great product everybody needs so to incentivize
[43:46.320 --> 43:49.880]  folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it for yourself and
[43:49.880 --> 43:54.680]  support the broadcast I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out.
[43:54.680 --> 44:00.320]  Get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[44:00.320 --> 44:09.960]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[44:09.960 --> 44:14.360]  that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations has put
[44:14.360 --> 44:15.360]  in place.
[44:15.360 --> 44:20.960]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[44:20.960 --> 44:26.360]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[44:26.360 --> 44:29.240]  faces from the light of the sun.
[44:29.240 --> 44:37.440]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[44:37.440 --> 44:43.800]  Ladies and gentlemen we are crossing the Rubicon now, the entire future destiny of humanity
[44:43.800 --> 44:44.800]  is upon us.
[44:44.800 --> 44:48.760]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[44:48.760 --> 44:50.760]  the world ID and carbon taxes.
[44:50.760 --> 44:56.320]  Things only get worse from here if we submit, they only get better if we resist and say
[44:56.320 --> 44:57.320]  no.
[44:57.320 --> 45:00.240]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[45:00.240 --> 45:06.200]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[45:06.200 --> 45:10.720]  and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out and they're doing that not because
[45:10.720 --> 45:16.280]  we're weak but because we're made the image of God, the Creator and we are powerful and
[45:16.280 --> 45:19.520]  the social engineers fear that so much.
[45:19.520 --> 45:23.360]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[45:23.360 --> 45:27.160]  with the boy is it true.
[45:27.160 --> 45:33.000]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[45:33.000 --> 45:36.800]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[45:36.800 --> 45:43.440]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God
[45:43.440 --> 45:45.440]  of this world who is a loser.
[45:45.440 --> 45:48.920]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep them full wars in the air now more than
[45:48.920 --> 45:53.320]  ever because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and
[45:53.320 --> 45:58.360]  setting up is safe and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast
[45:58.360 --> 45:59.360]  they just announced.
[45:59.360 --> 46:06.240]  So I did it, I signed up for the Austin Marathon, I've been training probably not as much as
[46:06.240 --> 46:10.960]  they should be but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for info wars at store.com.
[46:10.960 --> 46:16.640]  Before I set out on a run I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need
[46:16.640 --> 46:21.920]  to get going you know besides the energy turbo force it is giving me the vitamins I need
[46:21.920 --> 46:26.760]  like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids
[46:26.760 --> 46:30.920]  for sustained energy giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[46:30.920 --> 46:36.880]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' Soros, I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[46:36.880 --> 46:41.520]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation
[46:41.520 --> 46:43.920]  support and extra flexibility.
[46:43.920 --> 46:48.480]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[46:48.480 --> 46:53.160]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news turbo force that can
[46:53.160 --> 46:57.600]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and soilless can keep you moving
[46:57.600 --> 47:01.600]  and feeling great at any age.
[47:01.600 --> 47:28.600]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:28.600 --> 47:48.360]  Marjorie Taylor-Green is our guest here on the Alex Jones show, the next hour I'm going
[47:48.360 --> 47:54.400]  through how the UN, the Debo Scroop, the EU all admit they're collapsing the world economy
[47:54.400 --> 47:59.760]  using the Russian conflict to, quote, force us off of oil onto electric systems which
[47:59.760 --> 48:01.720]  don't work and aren't ready.
[48:01.720 --> 48:05.120]  They want us poor, you will own nothing, you will have nothing, it's here.
[48:05.120 --> 48:09.000]  The next phase of the global collapse and they're bragging about it and talking about
[48:09.000 --> 48:14.480]  once we're held hostage and the economy's falling apart, they want trillions per month
[48:14.480 --> 48:19.920]  at the UN to, quote, transition us to the new global green deal or build back better.
[48:19.920 --> 48:24.360]  In fact, let's talk about that right now with MTG and how they had their build back better
[48:24.360 --> 48:28.760]  bill that didn't completely pass but they've got pieces of it I know in other bills like
[48:28.760 --> 48:33.720]  the big omnibus spending bill and you're up there in the belly of the beast and so few
[48:33.720 --> 48:39.360]  members of Congress address what we're facing, this global great reset.
[48:39.360 --> 48:43.000]  Thank God you're there but the quicker people understand what we're facing, Lynn Beck's
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.560]  getting it, Tucker Carlson gets it, now Joe Rogan gets it, how are we ever going to beat
[48:48.560 --> 48:52.680]  this globalist corporate takeover that wants to make us poor to control us if people don't
[48:52.680 --> 48:55.320]  know even that they exist, MTG?
[48:55.320 --> 48:59.840]  You know, Alex, I always give people a lot more credit.
[48:59.840 --> 49:04.640]  Even if they don't really know the word, the great reset, they know something is wrong
[49:04.640 --> 49:10.240]  and they know that our government is failing them so I always give credit to the people
[49:10.240 --> 49:14.920]  even though they may not know the name, they know what's going on.
[49:14.920 --> 49:19.400]  There's some things that they're trying to fund this week, while we're waiting for the
[49:19.400 --> 49:25.280]  rest of the bill tax for the $1.5 trillion omnibus bill, there are some things I can
[49:25.280 --> 49:27.560]  tell you that are in there for sure.
[49:27.560 --> 49:35.080]  Number one, $22.5 billion for future COVID, COVID has been the greatest political tool
[49:35.080 --> 49:40.120]  that the Democrats have ever found and the people you were just talking about, the World
[49:40.120 --> 49:45.720]  Economic Forum and many other leaders in countries, they have used COVID as a political weapon
[49:45.720 --> 49:52.680]  against the people and they're planning more of this coming forward at $22.5 billion.
[49:52.680 --> 49:58.680]  They want to be able to produce more vaccines and even the wording in the language of the
[49:58.680 --> 50:05.080]  bill that we've read is they want to vaccinate the world, vaccinate the world and they want
[50:05.080 --> 50:07.320]  the American taxpayer to pay for it.
[50:07.320 --> 50:12.520]  Most completely wrong, we know that vaccines should always be someone's individual option
[50:12.520 --> 50:18.080]  and never forced on the American people, let alone be enforced on the world, especially
[50:18.080 --> 50:24.880]  since Pfizer has just released in the past few weeks all of the reported health adverse
[50:24.880 --> 50:32.280]  effects and it's nine pages, nine pages of terrible things that people have reported
[50:32.280 --> 50:34.160]  from the Pfizer vaccine.
[50:34.160 --> 50:39.960]  So this is more funding that is to fund the political tool COVID that has changed our
[50:39.960 --> 50:45.480]  world in just the past two years and really hurt our kids the most.
[50:45.480 --> 50:51.920]  Another thing that they're funding in this omnibus bill and that we'll be voting on today,
[50:51.920 --> 50:57.040]  maybe tomorrow is they want $10 billion for Ukraine.
[50:57.040 --> 51:03.760]  Now we can't, it can't be expressed enough how sad war is and about the innocent people
[51:03.760 --> 51:08.320]  that have been killed and all the refugees that have been displaced, families forced
[51:08.320 --> 51:14.960]  to leave their homes and the destruction we've seen on television and I'm completely opposed
[51:14.960 --> 51:19.960]  to it, you're opposed to it, Alex and we do not wish that on anybody and we wish Putin
[51:19.960 --> 51:27.200]  would stop, of course, but they want $10 billion to fund and it says in the language
[51:27.200 --> 51:33.080]  deployment of troops, deployment of troops and when we're talking about funding deployment
[51:33.080 --> 51:38.880]  of troops, well, that means, well, we don't know what that means, what comes next, right?
[51:38.880 --> 51:42.240]  And you know, I'm completely against funding foreign wars.
[51:42.240 --> 51:47.560]  I want to see our government take care of America for once and that's what I'm going
[51:47.560 --> 51:53.560]  to stand up here in Washington to make sure that I can do my part to make that happen.
[51:53.560 --> 51:59.000]  What is the sense right now in Congress because there does seem to be a bipartisan push to
[51:59.000 --> 52:03.800]  send more weapons to escalate war, the Secretary of State is talking about sending fighter
[52:03.800 --> 52:09.280]  jets to Poland and then having Poland give it to Ukraine, which again, Putin says is
[52:09.280 --> 52:14.600]  bringing the U.S. into the war, which it is, Putin has also said cutting off energy imports
[52:14.600 --> 52:18.600]  into the U.S. is an act of war, technically that is, again, I'm not a fan of what Putin
[52:18.600 --> 52:22.640]  did because you can see where this was all going into tragedy, which never happened,
[52:22.640 --> 52:32.360]  but now the danger of a full-on war and there's a big Pentagon drill that they did in 2019.
[52:32.360 --> 52:36.640]  NATO intervention to Ukraine could spark nuclear war, here's how it could happen and in the
[52:36.640 --> 52:44.920]  report it's estimated that a billion people will die during all of this in the big tabletop
[52:44.920 --> 52:50.880]  exercise that was done by the Pentagon and they're calling it the NATO-Russia war simulation
[52:50.880 --> 52:52.400]  of 2019.
[52:52.400 --> 52:55.000]  What do you make of that, Congresswoman?
[52:55.000 --> 53:00.280]  I think that should wake everyone up, it's terrifying and, you know, I was appalled at
[53:00.280 --> 53:06.400]  Lindsey Graham outwardly calling for the assassination of Putin of Russia.
[53:06.400 --> 53:12.160]  That was just the wrong thing, that's escalating and that's involving the U.S. just as much
[53:12.160 --> 53:20.360]  as funding weapons to be sent to continue the fighting, that is U.S. involvement.
[53:20.360 --> 53:24.120]  You know, another thing that needs to be said, there's other countries that have been in
[53:24.120 --> 53:32.400]  line waiting to buy these jets, these fighter jets that we're talking about sending to Ukraine
[53:32.400 --> 53:38.080]  and so they'll be missing out and then what comes next, Alex, Taiwan, we all know Taiwan
[53:38.080 --> 53:46.440]  is obviously next, China will be the aggressor, then where does it go from here?
[53:46.440 --> 53:50.760]  Now here's the real cost, let's talk about the cost of all of this.
[53:50.760 --> 53:58.400]  Russia is a major exporter of fertilizer and grain, not only do we buy oil from Russia,
[53:58.400 --> 54:05.960]  we also buy nuclear, to help our nuclear power plants here in the U.S., we buy that from Russia
[54:05.960 --> 54:13.280]  as well, so no one's talking about how stopping buying oil and stopping buying these things
[54:13.280 --> 54:19.800]  from Russia not only affects the U.S. but affects other countries, so if Russia stops exporting
[54:19.800 --> 54:25.920]  their grain, stops exporting their fertilizers, we're looking at potential food famines and
[54:25.920 --> 54:31.000]  not only are we looking at energy shortages here in the United States, but we're looking
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.320]  at many problems all over the world.
[54:33.320 --> 54:39.280]  I think we need to have cool heads in Washington, people need to slow down, we don't need the
[54:39.280 --> 54:47.360]  Lindsey Graham's and anyone else just continuing to drum the drums of war rushing America into
[54:47.360 --> 54:53.200]  this, we really need to take a step back and consider the real cost and it's always human
[54:53.200 --> 54:58.040]  lives and it's always the innocent people that suffer.
[54:58.040 --> 55:01.280]  Very well said, I know you can only do 10 minutes with us today but then a vote got pushed
[55:01.280 --> 55:04.000]  back and you can go a little bit the next hour but we're only going to keep you five
[55:04.000 --> 55:08.960]  minutes in the next hour because I want you to be able to respond to the lies and we're
[55:08.960 --> 55:13.360]  live right now but later I'm going to take what you actually said in studio two weeks
[55:13.360 --> 55:18.040]  ago and then put it on the front so we can have a video to get out there to counter the
[55:18.040 --> 55:21.960]  fraud but just to start to give the preface of what happened.
[55:21.960 --> 55:27.200]  We were talking about men and girls showers, biological men in front of little girls and
[55:27.200 --> 55:32.400]  some of these men it was in the news have assaulted women and are being given light prison sentences
[55:32.400 --> 55:37.440]  and men are getting women pregnant in prison and raping them and you said my husband would
[55:37.440 --> 55:41.640]  beat them into the ground, who doesn't agree that if a woman rapes a woman or a man rapes
[55:41.640 --> 55:44.880]  a woman or a little girl that they need to have their head beaten in.
[55:44.880 --> 55:50.120]  You didn't say beat up RuPaul on you know their TV show, you didn't say beat up you
[55:50.120 --> 55:55.280]  know some transgender person walking down the street, you were very clear that when men
[55:55.280 --> 55:59.800]  poses women and sexually assault women and little girls they need to be punished.
[55:59.800 --> 56:05.680]  Yes, I was clear about that and I talked with my husband about it so it's easy for me to
[56:05.680 --> 56:12.160]  double down if there's a grown man, an adult biological man dressing as a woman to be able
[56:12.160 --> 56:19.760]  to go into bathrooms, dorm rooms, going into women's private places, showers and so forth
[56:19.760 --> 56:23.880]  and we were talking about a camp, we were talking about a children's camp and I believe
[56:23.880 --> 56:31.520]  this was adult biological men, camp counselors who identify as women, we're staying in fifth
[56:31.520 --> 56:38.000]  grade girls' bathrooms or dorm or camp houses with fifth graders.
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.480]  Yeah, they don't belong in there.
[56:40.480 --> 56:43.600]  MTG, I want you to be able to get your full statement out, stay right there, we're going
[56:43.600 --> 56:46.760]  to come back in two minutes, you'll have five minutes to get it done, we really appreciate
[56:46.760 --> 56:49.960]  you being here but where's the best place for people to follow you on Getter?
[56:49.960 --> 56:53.080]  Where do people find all the great material you're putting out?
[56:53.080 --> 57:00.680]  Yes, I'm on Getter at MTG for America, I'm on Truth Social at MTG.
[57:00.680 --> 57:06.080]  My Twitter is RepMTG although that one's not as important, I'm on Instagram, Facebook
[57:06.080 --> 57:11.560]  so you can follow GAB, I'm on GAB also, Telegram so you can find me pretty much.
[57:11.560 --> 57:15.320]  Everybody loves you and you're getting more and more popular, as popular as Asanas, I'd
[57:15.320 --> 57:20.000]  love to see an Asanas MTG ticket, wow, all right, we're going to come right back.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.880]  Folks, don't forget, we're listeners supported by you, we don't have Soros or anybody else
[57:23.880 --> 57:27.880]  funding us, we sell great products, we have our TriEye and I have your immune system,
[57:27.880 --> 57:32.440]  you're thyroid and so much more, it is selling out but I'm keeping it at 50% off but it's
[57:32.440 --> 57:35.880]  going to sell out at current sales rates in like a week now and that's good because it's
[57:35.880 --> 57:41.720]  funding our operation, you need to get it, 50% off X3 at infowarstore.com and get Winter
[57:41.720 --> 57:50.040]  Sun 50% off while you're at it and Rainforest Ultra 40% off, stay with us.
[57:50.040 --> 57:56.400]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022 and in the month of February we
[57:56.400 --> 58:02.640]  had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, X3, that has all three
[58:02.640 --> 58:09.280]  types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity
[58:09.280 --> 58:14.800]  in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much and the majority of the
[58:14.800 --> 58:19.560]  population in the world is iodine deficient, this is the very best iodine out there.
[58:19.560 --> 58:24.480]  So, we had it on sale 50% off but we sold more than half of what we have or is it going
[58:24.480 --> 58:28.840]  to come in for a long time so I took it back to full products and I was just thinking you
[58:28.840 --> 58:33.400]  know what, we need the funds in now to stay on air plus this is the right product everybody
[58:33.400 --> 58:38.160]  needs so to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence, get X3 and experience
[58:38.160 --> 58:43.080]  with yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells
[58:43.080 --> 58:49.760]  out, get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[58:49.760 --> 58:55.080]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying,
[58:55.080 --> 59:00.960]  empowering and fulfilling, it's going to be hard to attain and when it comes to information,
[59:00.960 --> 59:08.200]  boy is that true today, we see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation, great
[59:08.200 --> 59:14.360]  recent combine, trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist
[59:14.360 --> 59:20.840]  nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors
[59:20.840 --> 59:27.040]  and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their
[59:27.040 --> 59:32.240]  world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it and none of
[59:32.240 --> 59:37.760]  it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and
[59:37.760 --> 59:42.920]  gas lit and that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence
[59:42.920 --> 59:47.280]  and that's why it's hard to share info wars links and band up video links, that's why
[59:47.280 --> 59:51.240]  we've got to share them now more than ever.
[59:51.240 --> 1:00:03.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:03.640 --> 1:00:10.080]  Big pharma, big tech, Hollywood are all funding the trans agenda, biological men saying they're
[1:00:10.080 --> 1:00:11.080]  women.
[1:00:11.080 --> 1:00:15.920]  I'm a libertarian, if somebody is a full grown adult wants to take their dog, they can but
[1:00:15.920 --> 1:00:20.520]  you shouldn't target children and handicapped children particularly autistic children, mainly
[1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:24.560]  boys telling them, oh you're really a girl and then take parental rights away and have
[1:00:24.560 --> 1:00:31.560]  them chemically or physically sterilized but going further we don't have biological
[1:00:31.560 --> 1:00:35.760]  men in prison getting women pregnant, some cases being them, we have a science camp out
[1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:41.360]  in California, KTLA reported on it a few weeks ago, TG was here in studio and you have these
[1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:45.920]  biological men sleeping in the same cabins with the girls, we were also talking about
[1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:50.560]  men that go in those showers and all the rest of it, she was saying that when a girl is
[1:00:50.560 --> 1:00:55.360]  being assaulted or something, somebody needs to defend them and the media misrepresented
[1:00:55.360 --> 1:01:01.720]  and said that she trans people to be physically attacked but she never said that, that's the
[1:01:01.720 --> 1:01:08.760]  corporate media news week, you name it, hundreds of publications misrepresented what she said
[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:13.840]  so she's here to be able to set the record straight, congresswoman.
[1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:17.360]  Thank you Alex, I'd love to set the record straight, well as all the corporate media
[1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:22.440]  lies, they always put the lies on the headline and then maybe the truth in the last paragraph
[1:01:22.440 --> 1:01:29.320]  of their article, the truth is that biological men are assaulting or attacking anyone under
[1:01:29.320 --> 1:01:34.760]  the age of 18, especially children, yes, they deserve to be beat up and there's nothing
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:39.800]  wrong with saying that corporate media and the radical leftists are completely detached
[1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:44.600]  from how parents feel and how the rest of America feels, not only do they deserve to
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:48.320]  be beat up, they deserve to be arrested, they deserve to be charged and they deserve to
[1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:53.520]  go to prison, it's completely wrong, I'm like you Alex, I don't really care what people
[1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:59.280]  do, adults consenting, adults do, it's none of my business, I hold no judgment over people's
[1:01:59.280 --> 1:02:05.080]  choices with their sexuality but I am taking a strong stand, there's only two genders,
[1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:11.400]  male and female and the biological men need to stay out of our private places, that's
[1:02:11.400 --> 1:02:19.480]  our bathrooms, our dorms, our sports, girls and women's sports and prisons, women's prisons,
[1:02:19.480 --> 1:02:26.440]  health clinics, women's rape clinics, biological men do not belong in there even if they feel
[1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:32.080]  like they're a woman and dress like a woman, so this is not, I don't hate transgender's
[1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:36.680]  not at all, I'm actually, you know, I know some and it's fine, I don't care, it's not
[1:02:36.680 --> 1:02:42.640]  a judgment on them, I'm taking a stand for women and I'm taking a stand for what's right
[1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:48.480]  in involving gender and I'm taking a stand for children, there should not be a lap, pediatric
[1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:52.960]  gender clinics are wrong and they're all over our country, educating children under the
[1:02:52.960 --> 1:03:00.400]  age of 18 and these teachers that are guiding kids under 18 and pushing them and trying
[1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:06.040]  to brainwash them that they're another gender is wrong and it's appropriate for me to say
[1:03:06.040 --> 1:03:12.800]  that because most parents agree with me, now if this offends the media, that's too bad
[1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:16.840]  because it's not really about the media, it's about the American people and parents are
[1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:22.240]  sick and tired of this garbage being shoved down their children's throats, now biological
[1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:27.460]  men are trying to act like their women as camp counselors, going into showers with fifth
[1:03:27.460 --> 1:03:32.960]  graders or sleeping in their cabins with other little girls or boys, that is completely
[1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:40.160]  wrong and it's okay for me to say that they might need a lesson, there's nothing wrong
[1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:44.440]  with that and I'll double down and I'll say it again, it's not about hating trans people
[1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:48.840]  or anyone, it's about hating children being targeted sexually undoubtedly because I have
[1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:53.680]  three daughters, I have a son but I know how camp works, if they had female counselors
[1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:58.120]  sleeping in a little bitty cabins that would be weird, adult women, it's weird and it's
[1:03:58.120 --> 1:04:02.600]  not done and look at the Boy Scouts handing out the condoms and then all of the sexual
[1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:06.840]  abuse of children bringing down the Boy Scouts, this is serious and these groups have infiltrated
[1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:11.560]  the Catholic Church and so many other institutions and destroyed them and I'm glad you're standing
[1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:17.280]  up and look at all of women's sports now, it's dominated by biological men, weightlifting,
[1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:23.640]  sprinting, swimming and it's a fraud, it is men invading women's spaces, if a man wants
[1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:28.880]  to say he's a woman and do all that, that's their issue but don't invade women's spaces.
[1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:34.920]  Exactly, so they're fine with men basically beating women in our women's sports, they're
[1:04:34.920 --> 1:04:41.880]  fine with men beating women and taking advantage of things that are our rights, our privacy
[1:04:41.880 --> 1:04:46.680]  rights, that's what the left is defending but they don't stand up for women's rights
[1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:51.520]  and they don't stand up for children's rights and I'm tired of it, I have no problem speaking
[1:04:51.520 --> 1:04:53.680]  out against it, it should be spoken out against.
[1:04:53.680 --> 1:04:59.920]  Well you are, you're doing a great job, thank you MTG.
[1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:05.280]  John Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great info wars listeners and
[1:05:05.280 --> 1:05:06.280]  viewers.
[1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:11.600]  If you will simply get X3 with all three types of good iodine that boosts your immune system
[1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:16.160]  and help everything that goes on your body at the cellular level, it will change your
[1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:22.160]  life, it will invigorate you, it will empower you, almost everyone has iodine deficiency,
[1:05:22.160 --> 1:05:27.760]  look into it for yourself, it's the opposite of fluoride, it's the good halogen and then
[1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:32.840]  your purchase of X3 funds our operation, now a lot of our products have been sold out and
[1:05:32.840 --> 1:05:36.880]  never came back in because of the lockdowns and supply chain breakdowns, we were sold
[1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:41.440]  out of X3 for a long time and I had it on sale for 50% off, a lot of folks were getting
[1:05:41.440 --> 1:05:45.480]  it and I was thinking you know what, I'm going to bring it back on sale again just until
[1:05:45.480 --> 1:05:49.240]  it sells out because even though we won't make as much money in the long run, a lot
[1:05:49.240 --> 1:05:53.200]  of folks need this product and we need to get the money from the sales in now to stay
[1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:54.200]  on air.
[1:05:54.200 --> 1:06:02.120]  Take your X3 right now at 50% off at infowarsstore.com.
[1:06:02.120 --> 1:06:11.040]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones Show.
[1:06:11.040 --> 1:06:12.040]  Fight is our fight.
[1:06:12.040 --> 1:06:15.040]  The fight is our fight.
[1:06:15.040 --> 1:06:20.480]  2017 will be the year of offense.
[1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:23.720]  All of us will go back to Washington.
[1:06:23.720 --> 1:06:33.120]  And we will push the case against Russia.
[1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:37.120]  Enough of a Russian aggression.
[1:06:37.120 --> 1:06:42.600]  It is time for them to pay a heavier price.
[1:06:42.600 --> 1:06:47.960]  The United States aides Ukraine and her people so that we can fight Russia over there and
[1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:50.520]  we don't have to fight Russia here.
[1:06:50.520 --> 1:07:01.880]  And the Soviet Union, the Soviet Empire collapsed and as the Empire collapsed, I moved in and
[1:07:01.880 --> 1:07:04.200]  picked up the pieces.
[1:07:04.200 --> 1:07:17.520]  First in Hungary in 1984 and then Poland in 1987, China in 1987 as well.
[1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:29.680]  So this is how the Soviet Empire was replacing the Soviet Empire.
[1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:33.640]  How do you think you're doing in your imperial ambitions?
[1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:41.560]  I think the one place where the greatest consternation would be caused in the short term for admission,
[1:07:41.560 --> 1:07:46.760]  having nothing to do with the merit and preparedness of the country to come in, would be to admit
[1:07:46.760 --> 1:07:54.000]  the Baltic states now in terms of NATO-Russian-U.S.-Russian relations.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:59.040]  And if there was ever anything that was going to tip the balance were to be tipped in terms
[1:07:59.040 --> 1:08:06.040]  of a vigorous and hostile reaction, I don't mean military, in Russia, it would be that.
[1:08:06.040 --> 1:08:13.640]  So the way I look at the calculus here is...
[1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:19.040]  See broadcast, Putin says Biden's banning of Russian oil imports is a declaration of war.
[1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:28.200]  Close quote, Pentagon War Game estimates one billion to die in NATO-Russia war, close quote.
[1:08:28.200 --> 1:08:34.600]  The European Union, the World Economic Forum and the UN all have officially announced that
[1:08:34.600 --> 1:08:42.800]  they will use the Russia conflict as a smokescreen to implement the great reset and the end of
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:46.840]  the use of fossil fuels, close quote.
[1:08:46.840 --> 1:08:51.120]  That is what we are covering here today.
[1:08:51.120 --> 1:08:54.040]  Joel Scalzen is the opposite of a Russophile.
[1:08:54.040 --> 1:08:55.520]  He does not like Putin.
[1:08:55.520 --> 1:08:59.040]  And he's got a lot of interesting angles and points here.
[1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:04.400]  He'll be joining us coming up in the third hour today.
[1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:11.440]  I have a lot of news, a lot of clips, a lot to cover, a lot to go over here today.
[1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:15.960]  But I specifically want to open the phones up and only take about 10 calls, because I
[1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:19.320]  don't want you to be holding on to the next hour.
[1:09:19.320 --> 1:09:24.320]  Four callers, so we'll go ahead and fire the phone system up, to specifically give me your
[1:09:24.320 --> 1:09:29.640]  take on how you think we get out of this and what you think of the situation.
[1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:31.960]  I'm going to just go through these calls quickly.
[1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:34.440]  I'm going to hammer through all of them.
[1:09:34.440 --> 1:09:43.400]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALIX.
[1:09:43.400 --> 1:09:50.000]  But I want to hit something that is incredibly important that we've already covered, because
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.480]  it's central to all of this, and I'm going to come back with Kellan McBreen's three
[1:09:53.480 --> 1:09:55.320]  articles on this.
[1:09:55.320 --> 1:10:02.200]  And that is the report from a few days ago, Pentagon-funded bioweapons labs in the Ukraine
[1:10:02.200 --> 1:10:07.800]  by the great Greg Rees.
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:13.720]  And the reason this is important, and we're about to play it, is it's on record in mainstream
[1:10:13.720 --> 1:10:17.440]  news that the U.S. built this stuff over there, and Fauci, of course, was involved, and the
[1:10:17.440 --> 1:10:21.840]  same old people with level four bioweapons labs.
[1:10:21.840 --> 1:10:25.280]  And that's real, and our media says it is it, but we have the documents, and the reason
[1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:28.720]  that's important is it ties in to Hunter Biden and Biden again.
[1:10:28.720 --> 1:10:31.920]  These people are as thick as thieves when it comes to this.
[1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:33.800]  And this is the next phase.
[1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:37.480]  And I believe they're going to launch a new bioweatack, a whole separate virus, other
[1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:39.600]  than COVID very soon.
[1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:40.600]  And that's when we come back.
[1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:41.600]  I'm going to play that clip.
[1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:48.060]  In fact, we'll play this clip going to break, and I'm going to come back with the head Canadian
[1:10:48.060 --> 1:10:52.080]  health minister, the one that said three years ago, soon we'll lock up the unvaccinated.
[1:10:52.080 --> 1:10:55.000]  What has she been told?
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:11:00.840]  She says another lockdown is coming, right after the election.
[1:11:00.840 --> 1:11:07.480]  So here is Greg Reese's very important report, and the reason I keep playing this is this
[1:11:07.480 --> 1:11:08.480]  is central.
[1:11:08.480 --> 1:11:09.480]  This is a big deal.
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:10.480]  Here it is.
[1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:24.320]  For years now, Russia has made verifiable claims that the U.S. is running secret biological
[1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:27.360]  weapons labs around their borders.
[1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:34.040]  And while Western media now claims this to be misinformation, back in 2013, they reported
[1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:35.520]  on it.
[1:11:35.520 --> 1:11:40.740]  While the United States and Murder Incorporated have been waging illegal wars all across the
[1:11:40.740 --> 1:11:46.120]  world in the name of democracy, Russia has been quietly selling energy and minding their
[1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:47.360]  own business.
[1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:51.840]  And according to National Geographic, this was the reason why the Pentagon was building
[1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:57.320]  these bioweapons labs in the first place, because Russia was entirely quiet on the subject
[1:11:57.320 --> 1:12:01.080]  and the U.S. wanted to get ahead of them.
[1:12:01.080 --> 1:12:08.200]  The initial biolab in Kazakhstan was built by the U.S. for $100 million to store high
[1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:15.200]  risk diseases such as plague and anthrax, and was hoping to attract scientists who might
[1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:21.520]  otherwise create biological weapons of mass destruction for someone else in order to keep
[1:12:21.520 --> 1:12:24.600]  the world safe.
[1:12:24.600 --> 1:12:29.020]  The U.S. has since built several labs in Kazakhstan.
[1:12:29.020 --> 1:12:35.880]  Most recently, a biosafety level 4 lab to be completed in early 2022.
[1:12:35.880 --> 1:12:44.360]  As early as 2004, the Pentagon's Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA, began creating a network
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:48.760]  of biolabs for infectious diseases in Uzbekistan.
[1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:54.480]  And within a few years after operations began, outbreaks of unknown diseases were reported
[1:12:54.480 --> 1:12:56.960]  in the same areas as the labs.
[1:12:56.960 --> 1:13:02.520]  In Georgia, leaked documents show that the U.S. embassy has been transporting deadly
[1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:06.840]  pathogens and human blood as diplomatic cargo.
[1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:12.440]  In a scheme where private U.S. contractors working for three different U.S. biolabs have
[1:13:12.440 --> 1:13:16.640]  been given diplomatic immunity to do so.
[1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:23.200]  Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, Atwar Klandestine released a video with maps of
[1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:28.480]  U.S. biolabs matching up with maps of the recent attack, suggesting that Russia was
[1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:32.080]  securing these top-secret biolabs.
[1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:36.760]  Western media claims this is false, but fails to debunk it.
[1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:42.000]  And once the video goes viral, the U.S. embassy in Ukraine is caught deleting evidence of
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:44.440]  these labs from their website.
[1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:49.880]  But not before an independent journalist was able to copy documents showing 11 Ukrainian
[1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:52.800]  biolabs funded by the Pentagon.
[1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:58.800]  The Russian embassy to Bosnia has accused the U.S. of filling Ukraine with biolabs,
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:04.360]  which were very possibly used to study methods for destroying the Russian people at the genetic
[1:14:04.360 --> 1:14:05.360]  level.
[1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:12.280]  And we now know that the so-called mRNA vaccines are destroying people at the genetic level.
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:16.880]  We now officially know that COVID-19 is a man-made bioweapon.
[1:14:16.880 --> 1:14:22.520]  We know that it was funded by elements of the NIH and Peter Dazik's EcoHealth Alliance.
[1:14:22.520 --> 1:14:25.800]  We know that it was made in Wuhan, China.
[1:14:25.800 --> 1:14:32.320]  And so what isn't threatening about the U.S. encircling Russia with top-secret biolabs?
[1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:36.920]  And who on earth thinks it's a coincidence that everyone involved in the United Nations
[1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:42.920]  Great Reset are now the Ukraine's greatest allies of all time?
[1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:47.720]  The mercenaries and war profiteers in America are getting excited about making short-term
[1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:50.240]  profits off the dead.
[1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:54.520]  But the only ones who will benefit from this war are the crooks at the top, who have been
[1:14:54.520 --> 1:15:00.880]  caught committing the most heinous crime against humanity in all of recorded history.
[1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:06.400]  And the only righteous way out of this is to hold these crooks accountable.
[1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:31.680]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:36.440]  A bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to
[1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:37.440]  counter a global problem.
[1:15:37.440 --> 1:15:42.640]  And the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world
[1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:43.640]  government.
[1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:53.640]  This is a biological warfare agent that had leaked out of the Wuhan laboratory.
[1:15:53.640 --> 1:16:03.720]  Two of our best-selling products are back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com, and they will
[1:16:03.720 --> 1:16:07.440]  sell out in the next three, four months before I get more of the product in if I sell it
[1:16:07.440 --> 1:16:08.440]  at full price.
[1:16:08.440 --> 1:16:13.120]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting one or son or getting
[1:16:13.120 --> 1:16:17.360]  X3 to try the products and see how amazing they are.
[1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:22.040]  And I believe you will then get hooked on them like myself and my family and the crew
[1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:23.040]  are.
[1:16:23.040 --> 1:16:27.080]  And again, both these products are back in stock, both X3 and one or son.
[1:16:27.080 --> 1:16:32.920]  They are 50% off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price I
[1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:35.800]  would estimate in less than a month.
[1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:40.040]  So this is your chance to get X3 and experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens.
[1:16:40.040 --> 1:16:44.200]  This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune
[1:16:44.200 --> 1:16:45.200]  system as well.
[1:16:45.200 --> 1:16:50.280]  They're amazing, and they're at InfoWarsStore.com, and the reason this is a 360 win is it funds
[1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:51.280]  the operation.
[1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:55.840]  I need funds to run the operation, you need to be healthy, we need to stay on air, it's
[1:16:55.840 --> 1:16:57.440]  a match made in heaven.
[1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:04.000]  It has been noted by many a historian, the first casualty of war is the truth, then the
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:11.200]  next big casualty isn't even the people that die, no that invariably follows, but first
[1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:18.880]  there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and massive censorship
[1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:24.680]  and now across the world from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[1:17:24.680 --> 1:17:33.360]  that if you amplify any quote pro Russian information, you can be censored, you can
[1:17:33.360 --> 1:17:38.760]  be arrested, you can be imprisoned, and of course now Canada is under this legislation
[1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:45.080]  that if you have a fought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate
[1:17:45.080 --> 1:17:48.880]  speech online, that you will be censored and arrested.
[1:17:48.880 --> 1:17:52.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalist around
[1:17:52.720 --> 1:17:58.640]  the world against humanity that makes InfoWars.com more important than ever.
[1:17:58.640 --> 1:18:04.040]  I stay on air selling high quality products that you need, that you want, that you're
[1:18:04.040 --> 1:18:08.720]  going to be happy with, that's why you come back and buy products from me again, it's
[1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:13.760]  a symbiotic relationship, I promote liberty, I promote freedom, I fight the globalist and
[1:18:13.760 --> 1:18:18.200]  I'm able to do that because you buy products at InfoWars.com and listen, all the products
[1:18:18.200 --> 1:18:23.560]  are great, but when it comes to high quality storeable food in an inflationary system with
[1:18:23.560 --> 1:18:29.680]  major supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute 360 win, hey no brainer, and they've
[1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:33.640]  got high quality storeable food ready to ship to you right now, the great folks at my page
[1:18:33.640 --> 1:18:40.280]  of supply exclusively for Paradox.com discounted, so again, be inflation, be prepared, fund
[1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:45.680]  the InfoWars, the only way you lose is not taking action at InfoWars.com or prepare
[1:18:45.680 --> 1:18:51.480]  with alex.com right now, this is high quality storeable food, this is how you meet inflation,
[1:18:51.480 --> 1:18:54.920]  get yours today, it's ready to ship, but I wouldn't wait because prices are about to
[1:18:54.920 --> 1:18:56.920]  go up because inflation is exploding.
[1:18:56.920 --> 1:19:00.120]  With the world awakening, I think what's important that we were right there, to prevent
[1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:03.440]  them right now, take advantage of this moment and I have always had an idea that something
[1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:07.160]  everybody can do, that every listener can do, I think it'd be powerful and effective
[1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:11.560]  for us to, you know, hang banners over highways, imagine if you're not being a listener, I
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:15.800]  want you to have an idea, it says Alex Jones is right, InfoWars.com, we stand with the
[1:19:15.800 --> 1:19:17.960]  truckers, we'll rest out, or whatever it's going to affect.
[1:19:17.960 --> 1:19:22.120]  Brother, I'm so glad you called, elaborate on this, yes, now is the time in your small
[1:19:22.120 --> 1:19:26.280]  town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall, or to put a sticker on
[1:19:26.280 --> 1:19:32.240]  your car, or banner hangs over highways, and it will be a chain reaction, what do you recommend
[1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:33.640]  people say on these banner hangs?
[1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:38.600]  I have a few ideas, first of all, I'll stress that what you call a farm, a rest house, a
[1:19:38.600 --> 1:19:42.320]  rest house, a vaccine is poison, there's tons of things, I say just keep it short, keep
[1:19:42.320 --> 1:19:43.320]  it concise.
[1:19:43.320 --> 1:19:47.720]  I agree, a rest house, a rest bill gates, the COVID-19 vaccine is poison, beautiful.
[1:19:47.720 --> 1:19:51.200]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved, that we could all be effective though, that's
[1:19:51.200 --> 1:19:52.200]  what I'm calling about.
[1:19:52.200 --> 1:19:56.480]  God bless you Chris, in Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today, thank
[1:19:56.480 --> 1:20:00.160]  you so much.
[1:20:00.160 --> 1:20:11.400]  Being a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:11.400 --> 1:20:29.400]  All right, so if you go back three years ago, you'd put the clip many times, Canada's public
[1:20:29.400 --> 1:20:39.800]  health officer, at the very top of the food chain, Therese Tam says, deadly lockdown measures
[1:20:39.800 --> 1:20:46.480]  aren't off the table for the future fall or winter, and that's what the UN saying, Bill
[1:20:46.480 --> 1:20:50.440]  Gates is saying, they're all saying it, and she's the one that said a year before any
[1:20:50.440 --> 1:20:58.760]  of this started three years ago, plus years ago, that we need to lock up the unvaccinated.
[1:20:58.760 --> 1:20:59.760]  What does she know is coming?
[1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:05.000]  Well, they all knew, they all wargamed it, they were all prepared, yeah, there she is
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:07.080]  saying, lock up everybody.
[1:21:07.080 --> 1:21:13.640]  So anybody that studies history knows, medical tyranny in the 19th and 20th centuries was
[1:21:13.640 --> 1:21:17.160]  the worst, and that the authoritarians used medical tyranny.
[1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:23.640]  The Soviets did it, the Nazis did it, Communist China does it, and now they've done it again.
[1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:28.480]  And still all over Austin, I was driving by a golf course this morning, and I saw a golf
[1:21:28.480 --> 1:21:34.880]  course workers, at one hole, another hole, on the machines, cutting the grass wearing
[1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:39.320]  masks, and I saw another guy raking leaves wearing one, hundreds of yards apart from
[1:21:39.320 --> 1:21:40.320]  each other.
[1:21:40.320 --> 1:21:41.320]  This is mental illness.
[1:21:41.320 --> 1:21:44.480]  And you go to restaurants, they're still wearing masks, and I'm like, I'm not going
[1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:47.000]  to eat here unless the damn masks come off.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:49.400]  This is mind control.
[1:21:49.400 --> 1:21:55.320]  Meanwhile, Russian embassy claims US-filled Ukraine with biolabs, exactly target Russians,
[1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:56.320]  well, there's no claims.
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:22:01.600]  I mean, they did have those there, that was part one, he did on March 2nd, then he did
[1:22:01.600 --> 1:22:02.600]  part two.
[1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:05.880]  Yesterday, Russian military accusers Pentagon of destroying evidence of secret biological
[1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:11.560]  experiments in Ukraine, and now part two of that report, part three total, how are
[1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:18.720]  Hunter Biden, Klaus Schwab and the CIA connected to US biolabs in Ukraine, and they are.
[1:22:18.720 --> 1:22:24.480]  Very important reports up on infowars.com, because the same people that cooked up the
[1:22:24.480 --> 1:22:28.880]  virus and released it and used it to lock down the world and starve next to 40 million
[1:22:28.880 --> 1:22:36.080]  people to death, goaded and poked and manipulated Russia, knowing they would invade by shipping
[1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:41.640]  weapons in, just played Eclipse last segment of all these world leaders admitting it, are
[1:22:41.640 --> 1:22:46.160]  now going to blame this war on the two years of lockdowns and the worldwide collapse that
[1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:47.560]  was already in full swing.
[1:22:47.560 --> 1:22:53.000]  And what did I say, thousands of times on air the last two years, I said, how will they
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:57.480]  cover up the deadly shots and record numbers of deaths, blood clots, heart attacks, heart
[1:22:57.480 --> 1:23:01.360]  swelling, cancer, how are they going to cover up the financial collapse, how are they going
[1:23:01.360 --> 1:23:07.440]  to cover up the hyperinflation that's coming, that's now here, and I said it'll be a war
[1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:12.280]  to then blame the war on that, because this is no brainer.
[1:23:12.280 --> 1:23:15.840]  Now let me tell you what's going to come next, we'll talk about it next segment, go to your
[1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:24.480]  calls, what's coming next has me extremely guilty right now, and I'm not somebody that
[1:23:24.480 --> 1:23:29.640]  ever feels guilty very often or that ever goes against my conscience, but I have to
[1:23:29.640 --> 1:23:36.520]  balance this and do the right thing and be Christ like, this is a paradox, like wait,
[1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:42.520]  you feel guilty, but you're saying it's Christ like, let me try to explain that in the best
[1:23:42.520 --> 1:23:46.280]  perspective, because I know you're probably going through this as well.
[1:23:46.280 --> 1:23:51.880]  My flesh and my individualism and my family that I really care about is in danger from
[1:23:51.880 --> 1:23:56.400]  nuclear war and financial collapse and road warrior scenarios, and everybody's instinct
[1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:01.000]  has been for years, get out of the cities, get self-sufficient, you've got a spirit,
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:05.760]  you've got a subconscious, you've got a mind, you're connected to God, you know.
[1:24:05.760 --> 1:24:12.400]  Now that voice is a screaming siren, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, danger,
[1:24:12.400 --> 1:24:15.240]  will Robinson.
[1:24:15.240 --> 1:24:19.920]  And now you see the reason you knew instinctively years ago, before the lockdowns, before the
[1:24:19.920 --> 1:24:27.320]  viral release, before the deadly shots, before the war, before the energy crunch, out of
[1:24:27.320 --> 1:24:35.560]  which a new global order, a new global Marshall plan to save the earth, what did Prince Charles
[1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:40.760]  say four or five months ago, he said we need a global Marshall plan, we need a global government
[1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:46.640]  with more money that exists in the world to the UN and to corporations to force the transition
[1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:52.400]  off of fossil fuels, a global military campaign, close quote.
[1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:56.680]  And now you're seeing it's a campaign to call the population by collapse and by war and
[1:24:56.680 --> 1:25:02.120]  by virus and by starvation, where they pose as the saviors.
[1:25:02.120 --> 1:25:08.720]  So the very UN World Health Food Program head is out saying hundreds of millions are going
[1:25:08.720 --> 1:25:13.000]  to starve to death now because of inflation and because of Russia.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:19.880]  Yeah, I got the video right there, we'll play it in a moment.
[1:25:19.880 --> 1:25:20.880]  Think about that.
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:25.040]  When the UN went along with the lockdowns, ordered the lockdowns that starved all those
[1:25:25.040 --> 1:25:28.960]  tens of millions of extra people to death on top of who normally die every year from
[1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:29.960]  starvation.
[1:25:29.960 --> 1:25:36.400]  And now the very same director is up there saying give the UN money, give the UN authority
[1:25:36.400 --> 1:25:41.640]  and they're everywhere saying oh we need trillions for new green deals because gas is so expensive.
[1:25:41.640 --> 1:25:45.400]  So they make gas and oil too expensive and try to force you on to something that's even
[1:25:45.400 --> 1:25:52.920]  more expensive and doesn't work and isn't rolled out yet.
[1:25:52.920 --> 1:26:03.880]  So here is the head health officer in Canada, Theresa Tam, talking about the new lockdowns.
[1:26:03.880 --> 1:26:09.520]  And so I think with all of those measures and understanding viral transmission, wearing
[1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:13.240]  a mask, ventilation, etc.
[1:26:13.240 --> 1:26:18.080]  We've got to be able to go into the fall and winter season or indeed the next wave if
[1:26:18.080 --> 1:26:26.040]  it should come in between with much more ability to respond without those really severe restrictions.
[1:26:26.040 --> 1:26:33.160]  That is the goal, but we still need to be flexible with the suite of measures should
[1:26:33.160 --> 1:26:35.160]  it become necessary.
[1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:39.560]  And it's very different, for example, I think in different areas of Canada where the health
[1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:43.400]  care system capacity may differ.
[1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:48.900]  And that's why I think you saw, or even right at the beginning, some of the smaller jurisdictions
[1:26:48.900 --> 1:26:54.480]  taking more measures because they simply can't afford to have a rapid escalation in their
[1:26:54.480 --> 1:26:58.400]  health care system impacts.
[1:26:58.400 --> 1:27:02.160]  All fraud, all lies, all proven to have killed over 40 million people.
[1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:05.320]  All proven to have caused massive suicide and people dying of cancer and heart attacks
[1:27:05.320 --> 1:27:06.320]  with no treatment.
[1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:07.320]  None of it was real.
[1:27:07.320 --> 1:27:09.160]  Put people in their houses, didn't slow the spread.
[1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:13.760]  It's all on record, but she is a criminal communist and she wants full control again,
[1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:17.040]  that she relishes locking in your house and making you non-essential.
[1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:18.520]  She has to cull you.
[1:27:18.520 --> 1:27:19.520]  That's her mission.
[1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:25.700]  Here's the German defense minister talking about Europe cutting off oil, but being getting
[1:27:25.700 --> 1:27:31.320]  off oil entirely and the European Green Deal built back better.
[1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:34.000]  Our second topic will be energy.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:41.200]  We have to get rid of the dependency of Russian gas, oil, and coal.
[1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:43.800]  I know the two of us agree on this.
[1:27:43.800 --> 1:27:48.920]  The Commission will be coming forward with proposals tomorrow.
[1:27:48.920 --> 1:27:51.600]  And there are three main pillars.
[1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:59.840]  One is that diversification of supply apply away from Russia and towards reliable suppliers.
[1:27:59.840 --> 1:28:03.200]  This is mainly LNG and pipeline gas.
[1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:10.440]  And both have the advantage that the infrastructure is over time hydrogen compatible.
[1:28:10.440 --> 1:28:16.240]  The second main element is to repower the European Union.
[1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:22.400]  Repower means massive investment in renewables like solar, wind, and hydrogen.
[1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:27.720]  So we are looking for a focused acceleration of the European Green Deal.
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:33.360]  And this is not only important and good for our strategic investment in our independence.
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:37.400]  It is also good for our industry and it is good for our planet.
[1:28:37.400 --> 1:28:38.400]  All of that is a lie.
[1:28:38.400 --> 1:28:42.880]  It is a post-industrial world that will starve billions to death total on record.
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:45.280]  But they're just introducing total death, total collapse.
[1:28:45.280 --> 1:28:46.280]  You will own nothing.
[1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:47.280]  You will have nothing.
[1:28:47.280 --> 1:28:48.280]  You'll no longer live in cities.
[1:28:48.280 --> 1:28:49.280]  You'll live in communes.
[1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:51.280]  Now you know how they're going to get you from A to Z.
[1:28:51.280 --> 1:28:54.920]  We're going to come back with more clips about the Great Reset and your phone call straight
[1:28:54.920 --> 1:28:58.720]  ahead.
[1:28:58.720 --> 1:29:02.720]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022.
[1:29:02.720 --> 1:29:08.840]  And in the month of February we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship
[1:29:08.840 --> 1:29:09.840]  product X3.
[1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:16.640]  That has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical
[1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:22.800]  cellular activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much.
[1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:26.080]  And the majority of the population in the world is iodine deficient.
[1:29:26.080 --> 1:29:28.280]  This is the very best iodine out there.
[1:29:28.280 --> 1:29:33.200]  So we had on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have or isn't going to
[1:29:33.200 --> 1:29:34.700]  come in for a long time.
[1:29:34.700 --> 1:29:36.720]  So I took it back to full process.
[1:29:36.720 --> 1:29:38.320]  And I was just thinking, you know what?
[1:29:38.320 --> 1:29:43.000]  We need the funds in now to stay on air plus this is the right product everybody needs.
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:46.960]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence, get X3 and experience it
[1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:52.600]  yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out.
[1:29:52.600 --> 1:29:58.840]  Get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[1:29:58.840 --> 1:30:03.600]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great info wars listeners and
[1:30:03.600 --> 1:30:04.600]  viewers.
[1:30:04.600 --> 1:30:10.680]  If you will simply get X3 with all three types of good iodine that boosts your immune system
[1:30:10.680 --> 1:30:15.240]  and help everything that goes on your body at the cellular level, it will change your
[1:30:15.240 --> 1:30:16.240]  life.
[1:30:16.240 --> 1:30:17.240]  It will invigorate you.
[1:30:17.240 --> 1:30:18.240]  It will empower you.
[1:30:18.240 --> 1:30:22.760]  And just everyone has iodine deficiency, look into it for yourself.
[1:30:22.760 --> 1:30:28.840]  It's the opposite of fluoride, it's the good halogen and then your purchase of X3 funds
[1:30:28.840 --> 1:30:29.840]  our operation.
[1:30:29.840 --> 1:30:34.000]  Now a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because of the lockdowns
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  and supply chain breakouts.
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:39.920]  We were sold out of X3 for a long time and I had it on sale for 50% off and a lot of
[1:30:39.920 --> 1:30:40.920]  folks were getting it.
[1:30:40.920 --> 1:30:41.920]  And I was thinking, you know what?
[1:30:41.920 --> 1:30:46.360]  I'm going to bring it back on sale again just until it sells out because even though
[1:30:46.360 --> 1:30:50.160]  we won't make as much money in the long run, a lot of folks need this product and we need
[1:30:50.160 --> 1:30:52.920]  to get the money from the sales and now to stay on air.
[1:30:52.920 --> 1:30:59.120]  See your X3 right now at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:59.120 --> 1:31:03.120]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going
[1:31:03.120 --> 1:31:06.000]  on both at home and the world at large.
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:10.760]  If you are having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new
[1:31:10.760 --> 1:31:15.200]  sleep support formula down and out is just the thing.
[1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:19.920]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you
[1:31:19.920 --> 1:31:22.720]  get the shut-eye you deserve.
[1:31:22.720 --> 1:31:26.960]  Formulated to improve upon our best selling product, Knockout, with down and out, now
[1:31:26.960 --> 1:31:32.640]  the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[1:31:32.640 --> 1:31:37.120]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[1:31:37.120 --> 1:31:42.320]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower which was traditionally
[1:31:42.320 --> 1:31:48.040]  used by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[1:31:48.040 --> 1:31:52.320]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will
[1:31:52.320 --> 1:31:54.160]  be down and out.
[1:31:54.160 --> 1:32:24.000]  Selling it out now at infowarstore.com.
[1:32:24.800 --> 1:32:33.040]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:39.920]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that
[1:32:39.920 --> 1:32:43.320]  only I own profitable.
[1:32:43.320 --> 1:32:45.680]  You will then be my slaves.
[1:32:45.680 --> 1:32:52.320]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of them from Cobra who will remove your immune
[1:32:52.320 --> 1:32:59.440]  system so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[1:32:59.440 --> 1:33:27.440]  Including a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:27.440 --> 1:33:41.960]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[1:33:41.960 --> 1:33:42.960]  the info war.
[1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:48.560]  So I just played the clips of the head of the European Union, it's also the head of
[1:33:48.560 --> 1:33:54.840]  the defense ministry and other world leaders saying, oh, we need to unify and use the cutting
[1:33:54.840 --> 1:33:59.760]  off of Russian oil and gas as a way to force people onto electricity and windmills which
[1:33:59.760 --> 1:34:04.560]  wouldn't be ready for years and don't work and bankrupt in Spain and put Texas in the
[1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:06.480]  dark last year.
[1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:07.480]  Unbelievable.
[1:34:07.480 --> 1:34:11.240]  So here's a few more of these clips and I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[1:34:11.240 --> 1:34:14.200]  There are so many.
[1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:24.520]  Here is Senator Mark Lee talking about how we need to declare a climate emergency and
[1:34:24.520 --> 1:34:30.280]  have a world transition, whether it's Prince Charles, the head of the EU or Democrats,
[1:34:30.280 --> 1:34:36.280]  it's build back better on the ashes of civilization which is designed to, again, make you totally
[1:34:36.280 --> 1:34:39.800]  poor, they can control you, give you a little bit of the first world and starve you to death
[1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:40.800]  for a little bit of the third world.
[1:34:40.800 --> 1:34:45.440]  And this is like shining on to total death and it has nothing to do with saving the earth.
[1:34:45.440 --> 1:34:46.440]  Here it is.
[1:34:46.440 --> 1:34:48.200]  Senator Jeff Merkley is a Democrat from Oregon.
[1:34:48.200 --> 1:34:51.960]  He participated in a bipartisan Zoom call with Ukrainian President Zelensky over the
[1:34:51.960 --> 1:34:52.960]  weekend.
[1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:57.080]  He's a staunch supporter of our efforts to get off of reliance on fossil fuels.
[1:34:57.080 --> 1:35:02.400]  Senator, I think that what we're seeing right now gives lives of this whole notion, 50 years
[1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:04.480]  of increasing US domestic production.
[1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:07.240]  It's not a question of where the actual stuff comes from.
[1:35:07.240 --> 1:35:11.720]  It's fossil fuels priced on a global market subject to these kind of things.
[1:35:11.720 --> 1:35:16.280]  This idea that we can drill our way out of this has been proven to be madness.
[1:35:16.280 --> 1:35:19.680]  Do your colleagues understand this?
[1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:24.760]  As long as there is a world market for oil, Russia will be able to sell its oil.
[1:35:24.760 --> 1:35:30.200]  And so, unfortunately, not all my colleagues yet understand that the way to undercut the
[1:35:30.200 --> 1:35:35.880]  power of Russia is to end our dependence on oil and have the world transition to renewable
[1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:36.880]  energy.
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:41.080]  And I was very struck by that 50 years of history you had, but back in the days of
[1:35:41.080 --> 1:35:45.680]  President Carter, there were two things that we didn't know at that point.
[1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:50.440]  One was that tremendous climate impacts of burning fossil fuels.
[1:35:50.440 --> 1:35:54.400]  And the second is renewable energy was very expensive at that time as compared to fossil
[1:35:54.400 --> 1:35:55.400]  fuels.
[1:35:55.400 --> 1:35:56.400]  Okay, I can't listen to this.
[1:35:56.400 --> 1:35:57.400]  I'm not going to play it.
[1:35:57.400 --> 1:35:58.400]  I'll just read you the quote.
[1:35:58.400 --> 1:35:59.840]  It's too hard to listen to these liars.
[1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:03.640]  Everything they say is a lie, and they're suppressing all the real technologies and things that
[1:36:03.640 --> 1:36:04.640]  are actually clean and good.
[1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:06.080]  These people are so sick.
[1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:10.800]  They said, we should, quote, have a climate emergency and need to have the world transition
[1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:13.880]  to green energy to undercut Russia.
[1:36:13.880 --> 1:36:14.880]  Absolute fraud.
[1:36:14.880 --> 1:36:16.800]  In post, we post this to Band-Aut video.
[1:36:16.800 --> 1:36:17.800]  Just add the clip I wanted.
[1:36:17.800 --> 1:36:18.800]  Thank you.
[1:36:18.800 --> 1:36:19.800]  Because I wanted these calls.
[1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:26.000]  Let's now move to the head of the World Food Program that the UN runs, the chief of that,
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  David Beasley.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:32.280]  The same one two years ago that's like, oh my God, hundreds of millions are on the verge,
[1:36:32.280 --> 1:36:36.840]  187 million are starving to death from just a few million, oh, 40 million are going to
[1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:40.720]  end, and 40 plus million did die extra in the next two years.
[1:36:40.720 --> 1:36:44.320]  But he doesn't ever tell you that the UN put the lockdown in place.
[1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:47.440]  Well now he's back, but he's grown a beard.
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:55.200]  Now he's Santa Claus, and he's saying basically, well, just hear it from him for yourself.
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:36:59.880]  He says that the higher cost of food and energy is going to cause hunger and death.
[1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:02.640]  Here it is.
[1:37:02.640 --> 1:37:06.600]  I'm standing here in Ukraine, you can see we're in a crisis, but it's not just a crisis
[1:37:06.600 --> 1:37:10.800]  inside Ukraine in terms of displacement, but it's also a crisis because this is going
[1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:16.440]  to affect supply chains, and particularly the price of costing of food.
[1:37:16.440 --> 1:37:21.600]  Already the World Food Program, before the Ukrainian crisis, we were buying 50% of our
[1:37:21.600 --> 1:37:24.960]  wheat, our commodities, right here in Ukraine.
[1:37:24.960 --> 1:37:30.280]  This breadvastcus helps us feed the world, Yemen, Ethiopia, Syria, that go on and on,
[1:37:30.280 --> 1:37:35.160]  and now we're looking at a price hike that will cost us an operational cost for 60 to
[1:37:35.160 --> 1:37:41.320]  75 million dollars more per month, and that means less people are going to get food, which
[1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:46.480]  means more people are going to go to bed hungry.
[1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:51.320]  So the UN cuts people off, stars them to death, and organizes military aged men into six
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:55.600]  months to year-long brainwashing camps, gives them debit cards with thousands of dollars
[1:37:55.600 --> 1:38:00.600]  on them, ships them to the U.S. to then undercut the wages and become a permanent underclass
[1:38:00.600 --> 1:38:06.000]  the Democrats control while they starve their families to death in their home countries.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:11.480]  That's full-spectrum murder, and that's how the United Nations operates.
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:21.120]  The founder of the World Wildlife System, Prince Bernhardt, remember, got caught running illegal
[1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:26.400]  poaching operations all over Africa, and uses organization as the cover for that.
[1:38:26.400 --> 1:38:30.760]  Always what they tell you they're doing, it's the opposite.
[1:38:30.760 --> 1:38:34.840]  Now I want to go to your phone calls here, I've got a lot of other news to get to as
[1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:41.120]  well, but this is just such a historic time, and there's really a very sickening, sinking
[1:38:41.120 --> 1:38:56.000]  feeling in my gut, watching what's unfolding right now, and the West going down every checklist,
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:01.320]  every point on the checklist, and checking it off to piss off Russia and to use Russia
[1:39:01.320 --> 1:39:05.880]  as the cover story for a world financial collapse in the Great Reset.
[1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:09.880]  And I've been saying that the last month was this build it up, and now you see it, and thank
[1:39:09.880 --> 1:39:17.800]  God I'm seeing a lot of other people figure that out in media, because we don't want a
[1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:22.560]  proxy war to continue with Russia, we need to not be backing Ukraine, we need to pull
[1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:29.400]  back and tell Russia to pull back and not keep going down this road, because again,
[1:39:29.400 --> 1:39:32.880]  this is being used as a smoke screen for the next phase of the Great Reset that is going
[1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:38.800]  to kill and starve to death innumerable numbers of people, and it was so predictable they'd
[1:39:38.800 --> 1:39:42.600]  use as a smoke screen, so predictable they'd bankrupt the world economy, they'll announce
[1:39:42.600 --> 1:39:48.480]  a new global currency, a new global SDR system, and a new digital tracking system based on
[1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:55.200]  the vaccine pass, and that's now all being announced, and then we are sleepwalking our
[1:39:55.200 --> 1:40:02.800]  way into the Chinese-style social credit score, and waking up in the chains.
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:08.080]  The chains are going on right now, and I want to go to your calls, but we've got all of
[1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:14.520]  these sock eclips, where she says Biden's doing everything he can to lower fuel prices,
[1:40:14.520 --> 1:40:19.400]  and everything he can to transition this on the better energy, and he just cares so much,
[1:40:19.400 --> 1:40:25.400]  that's why he's shut down over 2,000 pipelines in the Keystone pipeline, that's why he's
[1:40:25.400 --> 1:40:29.840]  shutting off the Russian oil now, and now importing it from Venezuela and Saudi Arabia,
[1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:37.760]  I mean it's just, she's up there saying two plus two equals 50, and it's a horror show,
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:41.560]  I mean the globalists are at war with us, we're going to go to break, and come back
[1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:47.960]  with Jordan, and John, and Jack, and Aaron, and Jayvon, and James, and Brandon, and Mike,
[1:40:47.960 --> 1:40:52.680]  and Carlos, and Robin, and Paddington, we've got Joel Scowles, and popping in for about
[1:40:52.680 --> 1:40:56.680]  30 minutes, I'll get to most of the calls before he comes on, but I'll get to Scowles
[1:40:56.680 --> 1:41:00.600]  in for about 30 minutes or so, and then we will go back to your phone calls, and then
[1:41:00.600 --> 1:41:09.120]  the great talk show host, who I just really admire and love all the work he does, Wayne
[1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:13.880]  Allen Root is going to be hosting, the fourth hour, and I really want to play some clips
[1:41:13.880 --> 1:41:17.360]  from yesterday's War Room, I mean Owen's always a smart talk show host, he does a really
[1:41:17.360 --> 1:41:21.640]  good job, but he's just been on fire lately, and so I've got a few clips I want to get
[1:41:21.640 --> 1:41:26.480]  to of the War Room, just where he knocks it out of the park, and there's some other shows
[1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:30.520]  knocking it out of the park that I'm so proud of as well, but I'll talk about those later,
[1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:39.480]  like the Nano World Order, episode seven of a new show on the COVIDland channel on Bandod
[1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:43.920]  Video, it was just first class, watched that last night, we're going to go to break, please
[1:41:43.920 --> 1:41:48.800]  remember that there is a major run on iodine, because people are figuring out it's the missing
[1:41:48.800 --> 1:41:54.040]  link for immunity, the missing link for IQ, the missing link for stamina, libido, but
[1:41:54.040 --> 1:42:00.120]  so many of it is bad, bound, garbage iodine, it would take hours to explain it.
[1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:05.400]  We have X3 that has the deep earth crystal iodine, and two other types of good iodine,
[1:42:05.400 --> 1:42:10.240]  to make sure you get maximum absorption, it's great for everybody, you should read what
[1:42:10.240 --> 1:42:15.120]  iodine deficiency does, over two million people have it, the globalists purposely bombard
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:19.000]  you with the bad halogens, fluoride, bromine, chloride, we have the good halogen, and despite
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:22.040]  the fact it's going to sell out, the current sales rate is about a week and a half right
[1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:27.640]  now, people are really buying it, I'm going to keep it at 50% off, also winter sun, highest
[1:42:27.640 --> 1:42:30.760]  quality vitamin D3 or vitamin K for your immune system and more, taking it out of the tongue
[1:42:30.760 --> 1:42:37.400]  it's incredible, it's 50% off, that's going to end soon, and we have the great new tropic,
[1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:41.280]  brain force ultra, it's different than brain force plus a turbo force, three different
[1:42:41.280 --> 1:42:45.640]  formulas, they're all different, they're all amazing, like one's a shotgun, one's a machine
[1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:54.440]  gun, and one is a next level new tropic mind weapon, but that is brain force ultra, it's
[1:42:54.440 --> 1:42:59.320]  40% off in Full War Store.
[1:42:59.320 --> 1:43:04.720]  I stay on air selling high quality products that you need, that you want, and that you're
[1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:09.400]  going to be happy with, that's why you come back and buy products from me again, it's
[1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:14.440]  a symbiotic relationship, I promote liberty, I promote freedom, I fight the globalist and
[1:43:14.440 --> 1:43:18.880]  I'm able to do that because you buy products at infowarstore.com, and listen, all the products
[1:43:18.880 --> 1:43:24.240]  are great, but when it comes to high quality, storeable food, in an inflationary system with
[1:43:24.240 --> 1:43:30.360]  major supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute 360 win, a no brainer, and they've
[1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:34.040]  got high quality, storeable food ready to ship to you right now, the great folks at
[1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:39.840]  my favorite supply, exclusively, prepare with alex.com discounted, so again, be in inflation,
[1:43:39.840 --> 1:43:45.560]  be prepared, fund the info war, the only way you lose is not taking action, at infowarstore.com
[1:43:45.560 --> 1:43:50.640]  or prepare with alex.com right now, this is high quality, storeable food, this is how
[1:43:50.640 --> 1:43:54.640]  you beat inflation, get yours today, it's ready to ship, but I wouldn't wait because
[1:43:54.640 --> 1:43:58.360]  prices are about to go up, because inflation is exploding.
[1:43:58.360 --> 1:44:03.160]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight,
[1:44:03.160 --> 1:44:08.080]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard
[1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:12.200]  Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it, so the first one I got was the original survival
[1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:16.320]  shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good, and then shortly thereafter you came out with
[1:44:16.320 --> 1:44:20.680]  that shield, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that,
[1:44:20.680 --> 1:44:25.040]  so I took it, and man, in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my
[1:44:25.040 --> 1:44:30.280]  brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again, I could connect with people again,
[1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:34.760]  and over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back, and I religiously
[1:44:34.760 --> 1:44:39.160]  took basically all of your supplements, they're all absolutely amazing supplements, the one
[1:44:39.160 --> 1:44:43.840]  I like recently is knockout, literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it, it's amazing,
[1:44:43.840 --> 1:44:48.200]  it works, but anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free
[1:44:48.200 --> 1:44:52.120]  of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into
[1:44:52.120 --> 1:44:53.120]  our own hands.
[1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:58.560]  Beautifully said, brother, I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[1:44:58.560 --> 1:45:02.120]  Let's go ahead and take another call, let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee, welcome.
[1:45:02.120 --> 1:45:03.120]  Hello, Alex.
[1:45:03.120 --> 1:45:04.120]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:45:04.120 --> 1:45:07.920]  Alright, I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[1:45:07.920 --> 1:45:13.960]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMailVialtality
[1:45:13.960 --> 1:45:18.520]  and BrainPorsePlus, mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[1:45:18.520 --> 1:45:23.240]  SuperMailVialtality really, really works, it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:28.800]  that have never been heated up, and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered
[1:45:28.800 --> 1:45:33.000]  versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong, this is like a very fine
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:37.880]  wine, in fact, each batch is different, sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay
[1:45:37.880 --> 1:45:41.520]  people are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong,
[1:45:41.520 --> 1:45:46.320]  that's just how it is, it's how it works, so it's always good, it's just sometimes
[1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:51.200]  it's like super strong, but yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this
[1:45:51.200 --> 1:45:52.200]  is it.
[1:45:52.200 --> 1:46:11.120]  Experience the next level in high powered energy new tropics with our latest BrainPorse
[1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:12.120]  offering, BrainPorse Ultra.
[1:46:12.120 --> 1:46:13.120]  Now it is easier than ever to take in the new lit form, with eight beneficial super

[1:46:59.480 --> 1:47:26.320]  Meeting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:51.960]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to Jordan in New Jersey where the great point he wants
[1:47:51.960 --> 1:47:57.040]  to raise, Ukraine produces 25% of the world's grain, that's true, and he ties it into the
[1:47:57.040 --> 1:47:58.040]  great reset.
[1:47:58.040 --> 1:48:01.040]  Jordan, tell us what we're witnessing.
[1:48:01.040 --> 1:48:04.240]  Peace to you, brother Alex.
[1:48:04.240 --> 1:48:09.040]  I just wanted to, you know, Mike Adams has been really good on this point in his podcast
[1:48:09.040 --> 1:48:10.040]  on Brighton.
[1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:15.240]  He's been talking about how they're trying to, through all this, as part of everything
[1:48:15.240 --> 1:48:22.640]  is basically shut down food production, amongst fertilizer, they're also going after the bread
[1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:23.640]  baskets of the world.
[1:48:23.640 --> 1:48:28.120]  No, you're right, but Mike said the next phase a year ago would be cutting off the fertilizer.
[1:48:28.120 --> 1:48:34.080]  He nailed it 100%, and I really have been asking my producers to get him on.
[1:48:34.080 --> 1:48:37.600]  Mike Adams, you're listening, I'd like to get you on tomorrow, go ahead, sir.
[1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:42.160]  Yes, so he hit that right on the money, you're right, Alex, and the other thing too is to
[1:48:42.160 --> 1:48:47.520]  remember, and you've been discussing it, the history of the Ukrainian area, up into the
[1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:52.600]  steps, you know, from Europe to the steps, and food production there, and really, who
[1:48:52.600 --> 1:48:55.920]  they're really targeting here is Europe, mostly Germany.
[1:48:55.920 --> 1:49:01.160]  Oh yeah, they're cutting their oil off, their gas, their grain, and it's going to bankrupt
[1:49:01.160 --> 1:49:06.480]  Germans and bankrupt Poles and bankrupt French and starve Africans and others to death.
[1:49:06.480 --> 1:49:11.480]  Yes, and India stands to really make a lot on this, and it's interesting that Biden's
[1:49:11.480 --> 1:49:16.080]  considering sanctions for the S-400 missile system against India, and all those strange
[1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:22.680]  moments with Bodhi and Biden earlier, or late last year, earlier this year.
[1:49:22.680 --> 1:49:27.080]  These are the times when world war started, people can't feel the danger, not just intellectually
[1:49:27.080 --> 1:49:31.760]  see it, but if you don't feel the danger, you're blind, spiritually, I mean, we are
[1:49:31.760 --> 1:49:33.760]  in grave danger.
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:39.560]  Yes, and this whole thing about a radiological device in Ukraine, a dirty bomb, would be
[1:49:39.560 --> 1:49:43.760]  so disastrous, okay, for the European continent, and the United States, because the United
[1:49:43.760 --> 1:49:46.960]  States has been decreasing wheat production since 1981.
[1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:49.680]  You drive through Route 90 through Arkansas, it's all soy farms.
[1:49:49.680 --> 1:49:54.640]  That's right, our government has been paying farmers not to produce wheat and not to produce
[1:49:54.640 --> 1:49:56.640]  other key staples.
[1:49:56.640 --> 1:50:01.600]  Yes, and so people have to realize that this is part of it, and Mike Adams has been doing
[1:50:01.600 --> 1:50:02.800]  a good job on this.
[1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:06.840]  You've been mentioning it, but they want to shut down global food production, and if
[1:50:06.840 --> 1:50:08.920]  anybody know Mike does, and I hope you get them on.
[1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:13.480]  We will, there's a big article about it on infowars.com today, Paul Joseph Watson, war
[1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:18.080]  will cause hell on earth, close quote, for global food prices, and that's what all the
[1:50:18.080 --> 1:50:23.760]  experts are saying, wow, it's absolutely insane, thank you so much, Jordan.
[1:50:23.760 --> 1:50:28.560]  All right, up next, ladies and gentlemen, who's been holding the longest here?
[1:50:28.560 --> 1:50:31.760]  That would be John in Georgia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[1:50:31.760 --> 1:50:37.920]  Hey Alex, hey listen, I'm former military, and I'm a graduate of the National War College,
[1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:41.560]  and you know, Joel Scousen's right about one thing, which is, it's really, it's the War
[1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:46.240]  Colleges and National War Colleges in specific, they're these globalist lecture series that
[1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:48.760]  kind of indoctrinate everybody, get everyone on the same page.
[1:50:48.760 --> 1:50:52.760]  Oh, Thomas Barnett comes and gives speeches saying America works for the New World Order,
[1:50:52.760 --> 1:50:56.760]  and America works for global corporations, and then America needs to be gotten rid of.
[1:50:56.760 --> 1:51:01.480]  Yes, sir, absolutely, and you ought to hear these folks, you drive to school every day,
[1:51:01.480 --> 1:51:05.880]  and everybody's saying, well you know, I heard on NPR this morning, it's just, you get all
[1:51:05.880 --> 1:51:10.400]  these colonels, lieutenant colonels, and state department officials in the USA, I think.
[1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:14.240]  Oh yeah, that's because they buy into all the garbage, and they get promoted.
[1:51:14.240 --> 1:51:18.320]  Absolutely, and you know, so the danger now is that, you know, we've got this senior working
[1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:23.400]  level folks, you know, that are high up enough in the system that they get a vote, but they're
[1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:27.240]  not, they're not the real people in charge, and they're, you know, you're a European
[1:51:27.240 --> 1:51:30.960]  command, they're in state department, and they're, it's like you said, they're sleepwalking
[1:51:30.960 --> 1:51:36.080]  us into this horrible situation, and the evil people behind them, the Victoria Newlands,
[1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:40.200]  the Wendy Sherman's, that crowd, they're happy to let them do it.
[1:51:40.200 --> 1:51:41.200]  It's just awful.
[1:51:41.200 --> 1:51:47.800]  Well let's be clear, Victoria Newland, McCain, Lindsey Graham has many me, all of them have
[1:51:47.800 --> 1:51:52.560]  said they want a war with Russia, and they want Ukraine to start it, and now it's happened.
[1:51:52.560 --> 1:51:57.160]  And again, Putin should not have taken the bait, I understand why they did it, but this
[1:51:57.160 --> 1:52:03.960]  is a disaster, and you can just smell the danger and the death, and the average trendy
[1:52:03.960 --> 1:52:07.600]  out there, though, that, you know, likes the lockdowns, and likes having nothing and owning
[1:52:07.600 --> 1:52:10.080]  nothing, they're about to get a front row seat to real poverty.
[1:52:10.080 --> 1:52:14.120]  I mean, folks, I'm not trying to scare listeners, I'm just telling you, everybody better get
[1:52:14.120 --> 1:52:18.600]  right with Jesus, because the whole world is, is, is going into a black hole right now,
[1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:20.680]  if these globalists don't get stopped.
[1:52:20.680 --> 1:52:25.280]  Oh, they took their mask off, and they put their Ukrainian flag pin on, it's awful, and
[1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:30.360]  I mean, I think the best case scenario is Russia wins this bath, and that window's kind
[1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:34.760]  of closing, and so kind of get this over with, because the longer this drags out, the longer
[1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:39.280]  there is for a purposeful or accidental miscalculation, and then they're going to get the war they
[1:52:39.280 --> 1:52:40.280]  want.
[1:52:40.280 --> 1:52:41.280]  It's just terrible, Alex.
[1:52:41.280 --> 1:52:43.400]  I hear your brother good points, thank you.
[1:52:43.400 --> 1:52:45.920]  Paddington in Washington, go ahead Paddington.
[1:52:45.920 --> 1:52:47.640]  How you doing, Alex?
[1:52:47.640 --> 1:52:48.640]  I'm alright.
[1:52:48.640 --> 1:52:53.240]  Hey, so real quick, so you know the bracelets, what would Jesus do?
[1:52:53.240 --> 1:52:58.360]  I think we need to kind of amend those a little for these times, and WWAD, what would the
[1:52:58.360 --> 1:53:04.080]  Amish do, or to be more accurate, what would the Anabaptist do, which are kind of the overall
[1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:10.600]  group that the Amish are under, and it's just, we need to get back to reality, reality is
[1:53:10.600 --> 1:53:11.600]  truth, reality is...
[1:53:11.600 --> 1:53:16.040]  One, I was thinking about the Amish last week, when I was on a business trip in Florida,
[1:53:16.040 --> 1:53:20.680]  and saw a bunch of them in Sarasota, and just they've got it right, they know evil's coming,
[1:53:20.680 --> 1:53:23.600]  they know they're being oppressed, they know if you try to be in the system, there's other
[1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:27.440]  greedy, hateful people that try to kill you or put you in prison, so they're like, okay,
[1:53:27.440 --> 1:53:31.440]  we don't want anything, we just want to be farmers, and that's what Thomas Jefferson
[1:53:31.440 --> 1:53:35.840]  talked about, the yeoman farmer, and how moral farmers are, because they actually have to
[1:53:35.840 --> 1:53:39.880]  really work and know what they're doing, and that's why Bloomberg says he hates farmers,
[1:53:39.880 --> 1:53:45.360]  he says they're evil, they're stupid, they're bad, because he's evil and stupid and bad.
[1:53:45.360 --> 1:53:49.600]  Yeah, and the bigger group is the Anabaptist, so then you've got the Mennonites and the
[1:53:49.600 --> 1:53:55.200]  Hutterites, so it's not all, we have to go full Luddite, but in general, what I see
[1:53:55.200 --> 1:53:56.200]  they're saying is...
[1:53:56.200 --> 1:53:59.280]  Well, you're right, I'm not against technology, but because it's being used by the Satanists
[1:53:59.280 --> 1:54:04.760]  to control us, the only way to really beat this would be to basically go Luddite, I mean,
[1:54:04.760 --> 1:54:05.760]  that's where we're at here.
[1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:10.920]  I was talking to my family last night at dinner about this, I just, we got property,
[1:54:10.920 --> 1:54:15.240]  I said, I'm gonna try to fix this, but I want the system to know too, I'm not fighting
[1:54:15.240 --> 1:54:21.400]  some war with the New World Order and all their stuff over power and Trump and all this.
[1:54:21.400 --> 1:54:26.120]  If Americans want to be part of the evil and America wants to go down, then it just has
[1:54:26.120 --> 1:54:29.800]  to go for those of us that don't want to be part of it, just to remove ourselves like
[1:54:29.800 --> 1:54:35.480]  the Israelites did out of Egypt, and just let all the leftists and all of them just
[1:54:35.480 --> 1:54:39.960]  murder themselves, because that's what they're a bunch of lost devil worshipers that want
[1:54:39.960 --> 1:54:44.480]  to take us with them, and the only way to survive is to get away from them.
[1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:51.520]  A parallel society, that has worked with totalitarianism, that's top two or three ways that you make
[1:54:51.520 --> 1:54:56.280]  it through totalitarianism parallel, and that's what the, that's what the Anabaptists did.
[1:54:56.280 --> 1:54:57.280]  They just...
[1:54:57.280 --> 1:54:58.720]  No, I hear you brother, I'm gonna jump, thank you for the call.
[1:54:58.720 --> 1:55:03.520]  Let's go to Carlos in Canada, he's been calling for over 15 years, he's a really smart guy,
[1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:05.640]  but we've got two minutes, cut to your point, Carlos.
[1:55:05.640 --> 1:55:11.320]  Thank you Alex, well, I just want to tell you that the NATO has pushed itself to a point
[1:55:11.320 --> 1:55:18.080]  where now it's clearly obvious the United States uses NATO as a weapon against any enemy,
[1:55:18.080 --> 1:55:22.960]  it doesn't really matter, it's Russia today, it'll be China tomorrow, whatever.
[1:55:22.960 --> 1:55:29.840]  It's really an obsolete instrument, and I want to just draw your attention to two websites.
[1:55:29.840 --> 1:55:37.520]  One is clarityofsignal.com, one word, clarity of signal, and the article is MSMMIA, the
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:44.040]  Ukrainian oligarch, right sector Nazis, MH17, and Joe Biden's son.
[1:55:44.040 --> 1:55:49.840]  You will find in that website, as well as in Dancing Bears website, that Joe Biden's
[1:55:49.840 --> 1:55:57.040]  son, Ihor Kolomoisky was his boss in Burisma, it was a partner with Zelensky, this whole
[1:55:57.040 --> 1:56:02.160]  thing has to be blown out of the water, Alex has gone too far, I think Sean Stone began
[1:56:02.160 --> 1:56:05.760]  to head on it, I think you should follow it up and expose it.
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:11.160]  Now with regards to Russia, I'm just going to continue what it's doing, as long as nobody
[1:56:11.160 --> 1:56:17.040]  gets hot under the collar and tries to do anything, they'll finish the job and they'll
[1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:23.040]  get down to work eventually, the suffering groups will get real, and I think NATO has
[1:56:23.040 --> 1:56:31.160]  overextended itself with New World Order and new World Economic Forum candidates.
[1:56:31.160 --> 1:56:39.160]  Zelensky, if you Google World Economic Forum, you will find that he is prominent.
[1:56:39.160 --> 1:56:44.920]  Well, sir, I know you're right about all of that, and I know that the Pentagon did a big
[1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:49.600]  war drill three years ago and found that at least a billion people are going to die on
[1:56:49.600 --> 1:56:52.120]  the road that's being gone down here.
[1:56:52.120 --> 1:56:57.360]  If the West got Ukraine to move towards NATO membership that Russia would invade, then
[1:56:57.360 --> 1:57:02.280]  Europe would start escalating with mercenaries and heavier weapons, and then invariably
[1:57:02.280 --> 1:57:06.040]  sanctions would take place, and then this would spin out of control with at least a
[1:57:06.040 --> 1:57:09.200]  billion people dead, mass starvation as well.
[1:57:09.200 --> 1:57:15.520]  Unless the United States or NATO begins the war, Russia is not going to, it's going to
[1:57:15.520 --> 1:57:19.280]  keep its gump out there dry, because in the long run, it's the largest country in the
[1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:21.840]  world, it's self-sufficient with all of the other...
[1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:22.840]  No, I agree with you.
[1:57:22.840 --> 1:57:24.000]  So why do you think...
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:26.680]  There's all these top generals saying, put an old fly zone in, go ahead and go to war
[1:57:26.680 --> 1:57:27.680]  with Russia.
[1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:29.680]  I mean, these people are insane.
[1:57:29.680 --> 1:57:35.520]  Well, Russia is basically now created, and no fly zone over Ukraine, because you try
[1:57:35.520 --> 1:57:36.520]  to go into Ukraine...
[1:57:36.520 --> 1:57:37.520]  No, no.
[1:57:37.520 --> 1:57:41.240]  Russia's going to go to war with anybody that flies over, and so I'm saying, NATO is making
[1:57:41.240 --> 1:57:43.240]  moves to actually do it.
[1:57:43.240 --> 1:57:44.240]  We'll be right back.
[1:57:44.240 --> 1:57:53.240]  Two of our best-selling products are back in stock, in FullWarStore.com, and they will
[1:57:53.240 --> 1:57:56.960]  sell out in the next three, four months before I get more of the product in, if I sell it
[1:57:56.960 --> 1:57:57.960]  at full price.
[1:57:57.960 --> 1:58:02.680]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting Winter Sun or getting
[1:58:02.680 --> 1:58:08.680]  X3 to try the products and see how amazing they are, and I believe you will then get
[1:58:08.680 --> 1:58:12.440]  hooked on them, like myself and my family, and the crew are.
[1:58:12.440 --> 1:58:18.080]  So again, both these products are back in stock, both X3 and Winter Sun, they are 50%
[1:58:18.080 --> 1:58:23.080]  off for a limited time, because they're going to sell out at this price, I would estimate
[1:58:23.080 --> 1:58:25.080]  in less than a month.
[1:58:25.080 --> 1:58:30.080]  So, this is your chance to get X3 and experience the good halogens or the bad halogens, this
[1:58:30.080 --> 1:58:33.800]  is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune
[1:58:33.800 --> 1:58:34.800]  system as well.
[1:58:34.800 --> 1:58:36.800]  They're amazing, and they're at FullWarStore.com.
[1:58:36.800 --> 1:58:41.360]  And the reason this is a 360 win is, it funds the operation.
[1:58:41.360 --> 1:58:45.400]  I need funds to run the operation, you need to be healthy, we need to stay on air, it's
[1:58:45.400 --> 1:58:48.400]  a match made in heaven.
[1:58:48.400 --> 1:58:49.400]  So I did it.
[1:58:49.400 --> 1:58:51.280]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[1:58:51.280 --> 1:58:55.960]  I've been training, probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[1:58:55.960 --> 1:58:58.960]  and thank goodness for InfowarsStore.com.
[1:58:58.960 --> 1:59:04.080]  Before I start out on a run, I throw down some Turbo Force to give me that energy I need
[1:59:04.080 --> 1:59:08.960]  to get going, you know, besides the energy Turbo Force, it is giving me the vitamins
[1:59:08.960 --> 1:59:13.680]  I need, like vitamin C to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino
[1:59:13.680 --> 1:59:18.320]  acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[1:59:18.320 --> 1:59:24.280]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis, I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[1:59:24.280 --> 1:59:28.960]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation
[1:59:28.960 --> 1:59:31.360]  support and extra flexibility.
[1:59:31.360 --> 1:59:35.920]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[1:59:35.920 --> 1:59:40.600]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, Turbo Force, that can
[1:59:40.600 --> 1:59:44.680]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and Sorilis can keep you
[1:59:44.680 --> 1:59:51.680]  moving and feeling great at any age.
[1:43:27.620 --> 2:00:30.280]  we are at war with Russia right now, clips of that coming up next segment, and
[2:00:30.280 --> 2:00:34.240]  Joel Scow is joining us, and then for callers that are still left on the board, we will
[2:00:34.240 --> 2:00:39.080]  continue with them, in fact, let's go to them right now in the order they were received.
[2:00:39.080 --> 2:00:41.920]  Robin in Oklahoma, thanks for calling.
[2:00:41.920 --> 2:00:48.480]  Alex, I remember several years ago, was a gentleman into the Rush Limbaugh show, he
[2:00:48.480 --> 2:00:54.120]  said he could, he could literally on a computer and a spreadsheet, see where America's decline
[2:00:54.120 --> 2:01:00.920]  started, financially, spiritually, and anything you can name, was 1973, and we all know what
[2:01:00.920 --> 2:01:01.920]  happened in 1973.
[2:01:01.920 --> 2:01:08.040]  We went off the gold standard, no, man, no, we started killing our unborn baby.
[2:01:08.040 --> 2:01:09.040]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:01:09.040 --> 2:01:10.040]  That too.
[2:01:10.040 --> 2:01:11.040]  That's even more important.
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:16.400]  We do not get, we don't get away with it, Alex, we're not going to get away with this.
[2:01:16.400 --> 2:01:17.400]  We're just not.
[2:01:17.400 --> 2:01:19.520]  We're, I mean, this is reaping and sowing.
[2:01:19.520 --> 2:01:26.000]  The whole world has reaped blood, thirsty, edamite behavior, and we are reaping what
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:30.840]  we have sown right now, and it is going to get worse.
[2:01:30.840 --> 2:01:34.280]  Side of a miracle, I don't think we can get out of this.
[2:01:34.280 --> 2:01:40.400]  We can talk political, we can talk war, we can talk, you know, victory gardens and greenhouses
[2:01:40.400 --> 2:01:42.240]  and cows and all that.
[2:01:42.240 --> 2:01:44.920]  We are, we are absolutely reaping what we sown right now.
[2:01:44.920 --> 2:01:45.920]  No, I totally agree with you.
[2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:47.920]  I don't know how I saw the point you were making.
[2:01:47.920 --> 2:01:51.600]  I was thinking about economy today, but, right, that's when we started the murder of 60 plus
[2:01:51.600 --> 2:01:57.480]  million babies and saying they're not humans, and now we say men or women and all the rest
[2:01:57.480 --> 2:01:58.480]  of it.
[2:01:58.480 --> 2:02:01.080]  And you go look at leftist, I don't feel good at how trashy and dumb they are.
[2:02:01.080 --> 2:02:04.200]  It makes me feel bad that they've fallen to such a level.
[2:02:04.200 --> 2:02:10.000]  They are literally confused, lost, demonic, hateful, crazy people, and they're everywhere
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:14.960]  now, everywhere all across the country and the world, and they are literally spiritless.
[2:02:14.960 --> 2:02:18.480]  They have no human spirit, or God's spirit isn't in them.
[2:02:18.480 --> 2:02:24.040]  They are completely drugged out and lost, and they are just rejoicing.
[2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:28.160]  They want nuclear war and death, and they want to bring it down on us because they've
[2:02:28.160 --> 2:02:29.640]  given up their life force.
[2:02:29.640 --> 2:02:32.040]  They are basically living dead.
[2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:33.440]  That's right.
[2:02:33.440 --> 2:02:36.320]  They're bloodthirsty, Edamont Alex.
[2:02:36.320 --> 2:02:37.320]  You're right.
[2:02:37.320 --> 2:02:40.160]  Let's go over to a spirit of strong delusion.
[2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:41.160]  Yes, sir.
[2:02:41.160 --> 2:02:42.800]  Thanks, Alex.
[2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:43.800]  Thank you so much.
[2:02:43.800 --> 2:02:45.000]  You made a really great point.
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:46.600]  Thanks for holding to say that.
[2:02:46.600 --> 2:02:48.880]  J-Von in New Jersey, you're up next.
[2:02:48.880 --> 2:02:49.880]  Thank you.
[2:02:49.880 --> 2:02:50.880]  Hi, Alex.
[2:02:50.880 --> 2:02:57.160]  First, I want to say please, please give Bishop Larry Gators back on for an emergency
[2:02:57.160 --> 2:02:58.160]  interview.
[2:02:58.160 --> 2:02:59.160]  Please get him back on.
[2:02:59.160 --> 2:03:00.160]  Get on who?
[2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:01.160]  Bishop Larry Gators.
[2:03:01.160 --> 2:03:02.160]  Oh, yeah.
[2:03:02.160 --> 2:03:03.160]  I like him.
[2:03:03.160 --> 2:03:04.160]  We'll get him back on.
[2:03:04.160 --> 2:03:05.160]  Yes, please.
[2:03:05.160 --> 2:03:16.040]  I don't agree with the Ukraine-Russia conflict, but I do believe that Vladimir Putin went
[2:03:16.040 --> 2:03:21.280]  in there for a reason, and I agree with you when you said he went in there to get out
[2:03:21.280 --> 2:03:29.280]  the Nazis and the pedophiles and bringing in a gay agenda and surrounding the country
[2:03:29.280 --> 2:03:34.640]  to try to infiltrate them and things of that nature.
[2:03:34.640 --> 2:03:39.840]  I do believe also, and Bishop Larry Gators brought this up, that he's trying to get rid
[2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:46.200]  of the Rothschild family that has ties in the Ukraine as well.
[2:03:46.200 --> 2:03:47.840]  So Vladimir has a plan.
[2:03:47.840 --> 2:03:52.960]  I believe he did have this planned out for years, and that he's prepared for anything
[2:03:52.960 --> 2:03:57.360]  that may come his way.
[2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:03.680]  Also I want to get on to what's happening here in this country.
[2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:09.240]  I believe we made a grave mistake helping Ukraine.
[2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:10.800]  We're going to pay for that.
[2:04:10.800 --> 2:04:15.360]  I'm going to say something that you won't say because you have a big target on your
[2:04:15.360 --> 2:04:17.960]  back, but I'm not afraid to say it.
[2:04:17.960 --> 2:04:25.800]  This country will, I believe, I pray to God that it won't happen, but I believe that we
[2:04:25.800 --> 2:04:28.720]  will get hit with a nuke.
[2:04:28.720 --> 2:04:36.600]  I had a dream years ago, way before this happened, that the lower part of Georgia got hit with
[2:04:36.600 --> 2:04:37.600]  a nuke.
[2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:40.000]  It came from the east.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:44.080]  We will pay for what we've done, especially with all the...
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:47.560]  Jayvon, I've got Joel Scousen coming up, but after he leaves, I'm going to go back to
[2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:48.560]  calls.
[2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:49.560]  If you can hold, I'll go back to you.
[2:04:49.560 --> 2:04:50.560]  If not, I appreciate your call.
[2:04:50.560 --> 2:04:54.960]  We'll go to Brandon and Mike, but Joel Scousen's going to come on for a few segments and I'll
[2:04:54.960 --> 2:04:55.960]  go back to your calls.
[2:04:55.960 --> 2:04:56.960]  We'll be right back.
[2:04:56.960 --> 2:05:05.240]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022, and in the month of February we
[2:05:05.240 --> 2:05:11.480]  had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, X3, that has all three
[2:05:11.480 --> 2:05:18.040]  types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical, cellular activity
[2:05:18.040 --> 2:05:22.960]  in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much.
[2:05:22.960 --> 2:05:27.440]  The majority of the population in the world is iodine deficient, this is the very best
[2:05:27.440 --> 2:05:28.440]  iodine out there.
[2:05:28.440 --> 2:05:33.280]  So, we had on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or isn't going
[2:05:33.280 --> 2:05:37.680]  to come in for a long time, so I took it back to full products, and I was just thinking,
[2:05:37.680 --> 2:05:41.800]  you know what, we need the funds in now to stay on air, plus this is the right product
[2:05:41.800 --> 2:05:46.600]  everybody needs, so to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3
[2:05:46.600 --> 2:05:50.440]  and experience it for yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50%
[2:05:50.440 --> 2:05:52.720]  off until it sells out.
[2:05:52.720 --> 2:05:57.720]  Get X3 right now exclusively at InfowarsStore.com for 50% off.
[2:05:57.720 --> 2:06:10.720]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:10.720 --> 2:06:20.120]  Bad news, travel like wildfire, good news, travel slow, they all call me wildfire, everybody
[2:06:20.120 --> 2:06:22.920]  knows, hell I'm bad news.
[2:06:22.920 --> 2:06:26.520]  All right, we had not checked the email, no big deal, nobody's fault, Bill Scalzen had
[2:06:26.520 --> 2:06:30.880]  to reschedule to tomorrow, we're getting Mike Adams on as well, and a lot more, so that
[2:06:30.880 --> 2:06:35.800]  means your phone calls and the news and information here on the Alex Jones show.
[2:06:35.800 --> 2:06:40.320]  So, Jay Vaughn was calling from New Jersey saying he really thinks the U.S. is going
[2:06:40.320 --> 2:06:41.320]  to get nuked.
[2:06:41.320 --> 2:06:46.960]  Well, I know this, Russia and the U.S. now say they have policies to use nukes first.
[2:06:46.960 --> 2:06:53.480]  We've had all these U.S. senators saying Democrat and Republican let's nuke Russia first.
[2:06:53.480 --> 2:06:56.720]  You've had the Pentagon saying, well, we can start using tactical nukes on each other and
[2:06:56.720 --> 2:07:03.560]  agree to not use intermediate or long-range missiles, but that's how all the war games
[2:07:03.560 --> 2:07:08.640]  show World War III, World War IV, whatever you want to call it starts, is that exact
[2:07:08.640 --> 2:07:09.640]  type of behavior.
[2:07:09.640 --> 2:07:13.760]  When your troops get overwhelmed, you use a tactical nuke, that's the doctrine.
[2:07:13.760 --> 2:07:15.000]  This is just unbelievable.
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:20.240]  I'm going to go back to your calls and then at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to recap
[2:07:20.240 --> 2:07:23.960]  and break some of the new news that's coming out, but it is just wild.
[2:07:23.960 --> 2:07:29.920]  But before I go back to Jay Vaughn, I wanted to play a clip from Colonel Douglas McGregor
[2:07:29.920 --> 2:07:35.840]  last night with Tucker Carlson saying Russia won't suffer as a result of our sanctions
[2:07:35.840 --> 2:07:40.480]  in Biden's plan to have Ukrainian pilots fly jets out of Poland, which Lincoln says is
[2:07:40.480 --> 2:07:46.360]  a plan, is the first decisive step across the line into what can make us a co-belligerent
[2:07:46.360 --> 2:07:48.040]  in a war in Ukraine.
[2:07:48.040 --> 2:07:50.240]  Moscow will not take this lightly.
[2:07:50.240 --> 2:07:55.280]  So Poland's saying they're not going to do it, but the Pentagon was on TV yesterday.
[2:07:55.280 --> 2:08:02.680]  I saw a spokesperson, Kirby, up there talking about, well, yeah, we're looking to get the
[2:08:02.680 --> 2:08:06.120]  A-10s out, going over there and killing all the Russians.
[2:08:06.120 --> 2:08:07.280]  This is real, folks.
[2:08:07.280 --> 2:08:08.280]  This isn't a simulation.
[2:08:08.280 --> 2:08:13.240]  This isn't a Hollywood movie, and the Russians say that they'll use tactical nukes on any
[2:08:13.240 --> 2:08:15.720]  country that's flying those planes out.
[2:08:15.720 --> 2:08:20.040]  I mean, Putin's on record, and I guess they're just going to let him be the bad guy and we'll
[2:08:20.040 --> 2:08:23.440]  have a nuclear war.
[2:08:23.440 --> 2:08:26.680]  That's really going to cut in all the green and blue and purple hair with all the trendies
[2:08:26.680 --> 2:08:27.680]  out there.
[2:08:27.680 --> 2:08:29.800]  And again, I don't care that you have blue and green and purple hair.
[2:08:29.800 --> 2:08:32.840]  It doesn't shock me.
[2:08:32.840 --> 2:08:34.680]  The point is, is that you love tyranny.
[2:08:34.680 --> 2:08:35.760]  You love big corporations.
[2:08:35.760 --> 2:08:37.120]  You love forced injections.
[2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:38.240]  You hate the Nuremberg Code.
[2:08:38.240 --> 2:08:39.280]  You love abortion.
[2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:40.280]  You love Satanism.
[2:08:40.280 --> 2:08:41.280]  You love being stupid.
[2:08:41.280 --> 2:08:42.280]  You love being lazy.
[2:08:42.280 --> 2:08:43.280]  You love death.
[2:08:43.280 --> 2:08:44.280]  You love war.
[2:08:44.280 --> 2:08:45.280]  You love Satan.
[2:08:45.280 --> 2:08:46.880]  You're idiots.
[2:08:46.880 --> 2:08:54.120]  And the government is just filled with all these weird, crazy perverts now.
[2:08:54.120 --> 2:08:59.080]  And perverts aren't just, you know, looking through your window at night masturbating.
[2:08:59.080 --> 2:09:00.080]  Perverts love war.
[2:09:00.080 --> 2:09:01.080]  They love death.
[2:09:01.080 --> 2:09:02.080]  They love evil.
[2:09:02.080 --> 2:09:03.080]  They love fraud.
[2:09:03.080 --> 2:09:04.080]  They love doing bad things.
[2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:06.760]  They love lying.
[2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:09.320]  I know our enemies, I've run into them, I've been around them.
[2:09:09.320 --> 2:09:13.400]  They're literally weak, twisted, unhappy people turned over to evil.
[2:09:13.400 --> 2:09:17.200]  And then they've got a bunch of dumbed-down followers, because there's not enough leaders
[2:09:17.200 --> 2:09:20.920]  standing up, that are following what they're saying and what they're doing, and they're
[2:09:20.920 --> 2:09:22.840]  leading us over the edge of a cliff.
[2:09:22.840 --> 2:09:24.960]  But so many others are just mercenaries.
[2:09:24.960 --> 2:09:26.600]  Rachel Maddow is a mercenary.
[2:09:26.600 --> 2:09:30.600]  She still goes on TV and says, the vaccine's 100% effective.
[2:09:30.600 --> 2:09:34.040]  Anybody criticizing that should be, you know, taken off the internet.
[2:09:34.040 --> 2:09:36.840]  And Biden still says, take the shot, you'll be protected.
[2:09:36.840 --> 2:09:38.640]  It's not even a damn vaccine.
[2:09:38.640 --> 2:09:40.520]  It erases your immune system.
[2:09:40.520 --> 2:09:45.560]  They know what they are doing.
[2:09:45.560 --> 2:09:51.080]  And those of us that, again, never get tired of swimming in the swimming pool, never get
[2:09:51.080 --> 2:09:54.920]  tired of hiking, never get tired of looking at the stars, never get tired of just going
[2:09:54.920 --> 2:09:58.640]  out to dinner and eating a nice meal, and never get tired of going to visit our neighbors
[2:09:58.640 --> 2:10:04.760]  or pet and our kitty cats or puppy dogs, never get tired of just being normal, good people.
[2:10:04.760 --> 2:10:05.920]  You're not mentally ill.
[2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:07.120]  You're not satanic.
[2:10:07.120 --> 2:10:08.120]  You're fallen.
[2:10:08.120 --> 2:10:09.120]  You're not perfect.
[2:10:09.120 --> 2:10:11.400]  But you're not given over to it.
[2:10:11.400 --> 2:10:17.200]  And you keep projecting your goodness onto these leftists and onto these people and thinking
[2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:19.200]  they can be convinced or gotten out of it.
[2:10:19.200 --> 2:10:20.200]  They can't.
[2:10:20.200 --> 2:10:21.200]  They're gone.
[2:10:21.200 --> 2:10:28.680]  Now, put the pictures back up and we'll go to the calls for TV viewers of anti-Fa arrestees
[2:10:28.680 --> 2:10:30.920]  and what they look like with their mask off.
[2:10:30.920 --> 2:10:33.040]  No wonder they want to cover their faces up.
[2:10:33.040 --> 2:10:36.400]  And then show the images of people on Instagram and Twitter.
[2:10:36.400 --> 2:10:37.680]  We didn't randomly select these.
[2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:44.400]  These are their pages who took the shot and are showing off they took it.
[2:10:44.400 --> 2:10:46.640]  Look at these people.
[2:10:46.640 --> 2:10:51.840]  These are the servants of Satan, almost every one of them on methamphetamine, almost every
[2:10:51.840 --> 2:10:57.040]  one of them blasted out of their brains, totally disconnected from God, having no idea what's
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:11:03.080]  going on, so lost they just believe if they join with the corporations at Big Pharma and
[2:11:03.080 --> 2:11:10.240]  CNN and dying Hollywood that they have attained something and they are better than you and
[2:11:10.240 --> 2:11:17.960]  they are part of a group and they are anointed when all they are is clowns that want one
[2:11:17.960 --> 2:11:23.760]  thing access to your children so they can get them when they're young and brainwash
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:27.880]  them and turn them over to their lifestyle and their system.
[2:11:27.880 --> 2:11:32.400]  And ladies and gentlemen, I did not guard my family enough.
[2:11:32.400 --> 2:11:42.600]  I did not keep a steadfast eye on this even myself.
[2:11:42.600 --> 2:11:52.400]  And I've got four wonderful children and the system got one of them and they're gone and
[2:11:52.400 --> 2:12:02.160]  it's very sad and it's the thing that's wounded me more than anything that my other children
[2:12:02.160 --> 2:12:11.280]  look like movie stars or Rex if he had dark hair looks like Clark Kent and this one beautiful
[2:12:11.280 --> 2:12:21.200]  child of mine put him back on screen looks like that now
[2:12:21.200 --> 2:12:27.960]  and it tears my guts out to see that spirit.
[2:12:27.960 --> 2:12:35.640]  And it's a spirit folks and I told you I've gone through a lot in the last few years.
[2:12:35.640 --> 2:12:39.760]  Satan's really had a lot of dirty tricks and I'm not a loser and I'm not a whiner and
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:46.800]  I'm not a victim and I don't feel sorry for myself I asked for this but I can tell you
[2:12:46.800 --> 2:12:54.920]  that I should have gotten out of Boston years ago but my infrastructure is here and my
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:13:01.600]  cruise here and I stayed here and it's my fault I knew this was going to happen a couple
[2:13:01.600 --> 2:13:06.400]  of years ago if I didn't get out of here I mean God told me your children aren't safe
[2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:10.200]  in this town get out of it go to a small town and get in with real Christians or you're
[2:13:10.200 --> 2:13:15.960]  going to you're going to lose your children and it's already started.
[2:13:15.960 --> 2:13:21.400]  You can't live in Babylon you can't be part of the system and live around it and be protected
[2:13:21.400 --> 2:13:32.920]  from it it will get you and these people are just such sad victims so caught up in the
[2:13:32.920 --> 2:13:37.640]  line we have to pray for them and there's been a lot of other stuff and I know you're
[2:13:37.640 --> 2:13:41.400]  all going through it as well my my God I had friends and family die of the bio weapon that
[2:13:41.400 --> 2:13:46.960]  Fauci made and launched almost killed my dad there's all the reports out of the long-term
[2:13:46.960 --> 2:13:53.040]  brain damage it causes once the prions to get into the brain and to sit there and watch
[2:13:53.040 --> 2:13:57.360]  it you know eat my brain it's in there growing I've done some things to mitigate it and basically
[2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:04.640]  knocked it out but I caught it early enough but I know a lot of people aren't the same
[2:14:04.640 --> 2:14:11.200]  after the new old order launched their attack and ate their brains but you know we're we're
[2:14:11.200 --> 2:14:16.240]  leaders and we're not wimps so we we dust ourselves off we get run over and keep fighting
[2:14:16.240 --> 2:14:19.480]  and keep moving forward but you don't want to just keep making money and living and doing
[2:14:19.480 --> 2:14:23.960]  your job you need to spend half your time folks fighting the new world order and exposing
[2:14:23.960 --> 2:14:29.520]  it because if you think the last two years of death and murder and dumbing down and psychic
[2:14:29.520 --> 2:14:36.320]  poison and spiritual poison and demonic attack if you think you've seen the full attack you
[2:14:36.320 --> 2:14:43.280]  have seen nothing like a poison cup that we're going to be forced to drink like that last
[2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:53.680]  caller said the lady we're gonna name now that God is gonna punish us for the 65 million
[2:14:53.680 --> 2:15:00.320]  dead babies and that God if we don't repent like David did and go to that quiet place
[2:15:00.320 --> 2:15:04.480]  the most high and get on our knees and and really tell God to come in and clean us out
[2:15:04.480 --> 2:15:10.600]  and push it all out and and renew us and forgive us then God's gonna allow evil to destroy
[2:15:10.600 --> 2:15:18.000]  us and it's gonna lower our shields or the biblical term lower the hedge remove the hedge
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:23.880]  remove the wall get the chills you can feel it coming in can't you but you know what we
[2:15:23.880 --> 2:15:29.880]  deserve it every damn one of us me included if God was to destroy the earth by fire this
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:34.840]  time right now I would understand it but I'm gonna keep moving forward and keep exposing
[2:15:34.840 --> 2:15:41.800]  this evil as best I can because God's watching wants to see what we're gonna do but you got
[2:15:41.800 --> 2:15:47.800]  to protect your children ladies and gentlemen because the power of satan is intense the
[2:15:47.800 --> 2:15:53.720]  power of satan is upon us and the weak are gonna fall and yield to it to be overtaken
[2:15:53.720 --> 2:16:01.560]  we've got to protect the children has been noted by many a historian the first casualty
[2:16:01.560 --> 2:16:09.280]  of war is the truth then the next big casualty isn't even the people that died no that is
[2:16:09.280 --> 2:16:17.560]  very much follows but first there is the crackdown on populations basic liberty and speech and
[2:16:17.560 --> 2:16:23.280]  massive censorship and now across the world from the united states to europe legislations
[2:16:23.280 --> 2:16:33.400]  being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro-russian information you can be censored
[2:16:33.400 --> 2:16:39.000]  you can be arrested you can be imprisoned and of course now canada's introduced legislation
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:45.640]  that if you have a fought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech
[2:16:45.640 --> 2:16:50.960]  online that you will be censored and arrested ladies and gentlemen the authoritarianism
[2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:55.280]  is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes them
[2:16:55.280 --> 2:17:21.800]  more important than ever what are champions made of here's a man who can show you triple
[2:17:21.800 --> 2:17:45.580]  étude

[2:18:00.620 --> 2:18:04.980]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[2:18:04.980 --> 2:18:10.900]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[2:18:10.900 --> 2:18:14.580]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[2:18:14.580 --> 2:18:19.540]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[2:18:19.540 --> 2:18:23.740]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[2:18:23.740 --> 2:18:27.940]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.

[2:18:57.820 --> 2:19:05.260]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[2:19:05.260 --> 2:19:11.380]  until the populations rebelled. They would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[2:19:11.380 --> 2:19:16.820]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[2:19:16.820 --> 2:19:22.420]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[2:19:22.420 --> 2:19:28.100]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[2:19:28.100 --> 2:19:32.380]  that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[2:19:32.380 --> 2:19:37.260]  So it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever. The problem is some globalist controlled
[2:19:37.260 --> 2:19:40.100]  areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[2:19:40.100 --> 2:19:45.940]  Like Canada, where they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario
[2:19:45.940 --> 2:19:48.780]  and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[2:19:48.780 --> 2:19:52.660]  So pray for these folks big time. This is a very serious situation.
[2:19:52.660 --> 2:19:59.660]  And stay tuned into infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[2:19:59.660 --> 2:20:06.660]  Ending of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:06.660 --> 2:20:17.660]  You're in a physical war. You're in an undeclared unrestricted total war of the New World Order.
[2:20:17.660 --> 2:20:25.660]  I'm your host Alex Jones. I saw this tweet going around. It really gets you thinking.
[2:20:25.660 --> 2:20:32.940]  The radio listeners all describe it. It shows a human being held down by two metallic aliens
[2:20:32.940 --> 2:20:40.300]  with hyperdermic needles in their hands. They're saying it's time to alter your DNA.
[2:20:40.300 --> 2:20:43.660]  All the big CEOs admitting they're going to alter your DNA. It's a revolution. Get you
[2:20:43.660 --> 2:20:45.980]  used to it. Take you over.
[2:20:45.980 --> 2:20:49.540]  And it alters it by beginning to grow spike proteins in your body and cutting your double
[2:20:49.540 --> 2:21:01.540]  helix. And it grows all the different graphene oxide matrices in your body.
[2:21:01.540 --> 2:21:05.620]  I'm going to go back to your calls right now, but I'm going to play a few minutes coming
[2:21:05.620 --> 2:21:13.780]  up from a powerful new show that's got some of the producers and directors involved from
[2:21:13.780 --> 2:21:22.500]  the great film series, Copeland. And hundreds of thousands of folks have already watched
[2:21:22.500 --> 2:21:27.820]  this latest episode. Watch how nanotech in COVID vaccines destroys your body. We've got
[2:21:27.820 --> 2:21:34.260]  a bunch of good COVID news as well that I haven't hit yet that we'll be getting to.
[2:21:34.260 --> 2:21:39.620]  But right now, let's go back to Jayvon. Jayvon, thanks for holding. So tell us where you think
[2:21:39.620 --> 2:21:48.740]  this is all going? I think this country, I can't speak on any other country. I'm just
[2:21:48.740 --> 2:21:55.220]  going to speak on ours. This country is going to go, it's going to go to hell. And the reason
[2:21:55.220 --> 2:22:01.460]  why it doesn't have to, but it's going, because like you said, it's too many people that don't
[2:22:01.460 --> 2:22:09.460]  care. They don't want to care until hell comes knocking on their door. And I think it's
[2:22:09.460 --> 2:22:14.740]  going to take that for everybody, whether you're rich, poor, middle class, it's going
[2:22:14.740 --> 2:22:19.620]  to knock on your door. And you're going to see how real everything is really going to
[2:22:19.620 --> 2:22:30.340]  get. I blame the pastors for not going to Washington, DC, instead of truck drivers.
[2:22:30.340 --> 2:22:38.140]  It should be the churches taking the first steps and then everything will follow. I believe
[2:22:38.140 --> 2:22:44.700]  it's when you keep God first and you're preaching and you're teaching and you're saying this
[2:22:44.700 --> 2:22:55.380]  and that, but your action, it takes the action of those works because chaste without works
[2:22:55.380 --> 2:23:03.500]  is dead. And I think the church needs to start getting ahead and start leading things before
[2:23:03.500 --> 2:23:09.700]  any other organization does because it's not going to take effect until a missile strike,
[2:23:09.700 --> 2:23:16.300]  until something catastrophe happens. But then it's going to be too late because this is
[2:23:16.300 --> 2:23:21.060]  not a third world country. The powers that be want America to be a third world country.
[2:23:21.060 --> 2:23:27.340]  And people are going to see how places like Venezuela and Cuba and parts of Africa really
[2:23:27.340 --> 2:23:32.780]  are because the people that come to this country legally, they don't want communism. They don't
[2:23:32.780 --> 2:23:38.660]  want socialism. But the people that were born here are so dumb and ignorant that they believe
[2:23:38.660 --> 2:23:45.300]  that communism and socialism is a good thing. And we've been lied to our whole lives through
[2:23:45.300 --> 2:23:53.460]  the school system, through the college system. They're absolutely wrong. And we're going
[2:23:53.460 --> 2:24:02.740]  to pay. It's sad because I try to be optimistic, but I can't. Once I found out that Ukraine
[2:24:02.740 --> 2:24:11.180]  got invaded by Russia, I got chills. I really get chills. I got chills once I saw that news
[2:24:11.180 --> 2:24:20.100]  because it's coming. It's coming quick. Absolutely. You know, Joy Reed, who's paid to create racial
[2:24:20.100 --> 2:24:24.420]  division and control people on MSNBC, she said people only care about Ukraine because
[2:24:24.420 --> 2:24:30.220]  they're white. No, it's because Russia's got nuclear weapons and most experts believe the
[2:24:30.220 --> 2:24:34.500]  nuclear war is going to start. It was going to start in Ukraine. That's why everybody's
[2:24:34.500 --> 2:24:38.900]  so concerned because this could end the damn world.
[2:24:38.900 --> 2:24:46.820]  Exactly. And some people, you know, they don't know geopolitical politics. They don't know
[2:24:46.820 --> 2:24:51.500]  anything. They don't have a mind of their own. They've been taught years to not have
[2:24:51.500 --> 2:24:59.900]  a mind of their own because of the public school system, because of college, the indoctrination
[2:24:59.900 --> 2:25:08.020]  from the Kazarian Jews, from the Rothschild family that's been plaguing this world for
[2:25:08.020 --> 2:25:17.300]  over 2,000 years. It's them. And we've become institutionalized as a nation. And it's sad
[2:25:17.300 --> 2:25:23.500]  because it's so biased, especially black people, and I'm black, especially black people are
[2:25:23.500 --> 2:25:30.300]  biased on this whole Ukraine-Russia thing that they are on the side of Ukraine, not
[2:25:30.300 --> 2:25:34.940]  knowing anything about anything because they're ignorant.
[2:25:34.940 --> 2:25:40.580]  It is scary. Listen, Jayvon, I appreciate your call. Really, really interesting points.
[2:25:40.580 --> 2:25:44.460]  And I mean, I'll just say this. There are evil groups in satanic organizations heading
[2:25:44.460 --> 2:25:49.940]  up every major ethnic and religious group on the planet right now. I mean, what he's saying
[2:25:49.940 --> 2:25:56.180]  is very reality-based. And I'm not saying that the Greek Orthodox or the Russian Orthodox
[2:25:56.180 --> 2:26:00.700]  Church is perfect, but they're calling out the New World Order. They're saying this is
[2:26:00.700 --> 2:26:05.140]  the mark of the beast. They're saying the vaccines are poisons. And that's who Putin
[2:26:05.140 --> 2:26:10.900]  says he's following. Now, people can say, well, he's just manipulating him. Well, regardless,
[2:26:10.900 --> 2:26:17.100]  the globalists want the Russians taken out. And then you've got Abramovich, the high priest
[2:26:17.100 --> 2:26:24.420]  of Satan, lady, who literally worships the same religion as Alistair Crowley developed,
[2:26:24.420 --> 2:26:31.220]  a version of black magic, saying she supports Ukraine. I mean, it's just out of control,
[2:26:31.220 --> 2:26:38.580]  ladies and gentlemen, and it's extremely dangerous. We're going to go to break, come back, and
[2:26:38.580 --> 2:26:43.020]  go to more calls. Then I'm going to hit some clips from some really powerful shows lately
[2:26:43.020 --> 2:26:49.620]  that have been on Bandai Video. I mean, I am really honored that there are folks doing
[2:26:49.620 --> 2:26:54.100]  whole shows and podcasts now just on Bandai Video. And I want them to put them everywhere,
[2:26:54.100 --> 2:26:59.940]  but they're calling us, getting vetted, and then getting put on there. Because we'd love
[2:26:59.940 --> 2:27:08.060]  to have everybody on Bandai Video. A, I can't pay for all the bandwidth. And B, we can have
[2:27:08.060 --> 2:27:11.740]  provocateurs get on there and try to set us up and call for violence. Because, A, I don't
[2:27:11.740 --> 2:27:17.100]  believe in offensive violence, and B, we're not going to let people set us up and put
[2:27:17.100 --> 2:27:20.620]  us in prison for violence. They already take things I've said out of context and edit it
[2:27:20.620 --> 2:27:24.740]  together, or The New York Times, The Washington Post will take two-word comments and one-word
[2:27:24.740 --> 2:27:30.020]  comments and quotes to make it look like I said something I didn't say, trying to get
[2:27:30.020 --> 2:27:34.460]  us shut down and trying to get our listeners to believe I said that so they'll go out and
[2:27:34.460 --> 2:27:42.300]  carry out some violence. So, there's a spiritual fight, there's a time for defensive violence,
[2:27:42.300 --> 2:27:45.940]  and it may come to that for people, but that's between you and God and that point in time.
[2:27:45.940 --> 2:27:52.500]  I am not called to be a military leader and to try to direct people into conflicts. You
[2:27:52.500 --> 2:27:55.740]  saw that January 6th, where I thought I was just there to, you know, be at a peaceful
[2:27:55.740 --> 2:27:58.340]  demonstration, and I've been to all these other Trump events that were peaceful, and
[2:27:58.340 --> 2:28:03.020]  then provocateurs came and took it away from us. And now the very system that did that
[2:28:03.020 --> 2:28:10.260]  is busy trying to put me and an Owen Schreuer and Sam Montoya and others in prison. That's
[2:28:10.260 --> 2:28:14.740]  currently all ongoing. And there's a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff people don't even
[2:28:14.740 --> 2:28:20.020]  know about, folks, but I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about nuclear war breathing
[2:28:20.020 --> 2:28:24.740]  down our neck, and I'm worried about the open borders and the collapsing dollar and just
[2:28:24.740 --> 2:28:30.180]  the evil, twisted people running things that are just not even human anymore, folks. They
[2:28:30.180 --> 2:28:36.620]  are demons. They are just hushed or avatar bodies, meat suits for these things that everything
[2:28:36.620 --> 2:28:41.220]  they do is to take our humanity, hurt our children, poison us slowly and then kill us.
[2:28:41.220 --> 2:28:46.020]  Kill, steal, and destroy. They're what the Bible describes as devils. I will be right
[2:28:46.020 --> 2:28:51.180]  back with all the callers and so much more, infowars.com. Those links only get shared
[2:28:51.180 --> 2:28:58.300]  when you share them, and that's critical to winning the war.
[2:28:58.300 --> 2:29:04.660]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022. And in the month of February,
[2:29:04.660 --> 2:29:10.900]  we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, X3. It has all three
[2:29:10.900 --> 2:29:17.500]  types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical, cellular activity
[2:29:17.500 --> 2:29:22.980]  in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much. And the majority of
[2:29:22.980 --> 2:29:28.460]  the population of the world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine out there. So
[2:29:28.460 --> 2:29:32.700]  you have on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or isn't going
[2:29:32.700 --> 2:29:37.060]  to come in for a long time. So I took it back to full products. And I was just thinking,
[2:29:37.060 --> 2:29:41.220]  you know what, we need the funds in now to stay on air. Plus this is the right product
[2:29:41.220 --> 2:29:45.940]  everybody needs. So incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3
[2:29:45.940 --> 2:29:50.380]  and experience it yourself and support the broadcast. I'm going to keep it at 50% off
[2:29:50.380 --> 2:29:58.300]  until it sells out. Get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off. Mike in California,
[2:29:58.300 --> 2:30:02.460]  thanks for calling. I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function
[2:30:02.460 --> 2:30:08.180]  research. Now, if you read the actual 2014 legislation, the US government gain of function
[2:30:08.180 --> 2:30:13.580]  deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research
[2:30:13.580 --> 2:30:18.740]  involving influenza, MERS and ZARS viruses. There's nothing about ZARS like viruses.
[2:30:18.740 --> 2:30:22.900]  It's a research funding pause. It's not a stop. It's not a prohibition. It's when
[2:30:22.900 --> 2:30:26.780]  you come to a four way intersection, there's the stop sign. You stop, you look both ways
[2:30:26.780 --> 2:30:31.620]  and then you proceed. And so it's also, it doesn't pause all gain of function, just selected
[2:30:31.620 --> 2:30:36.340]  gain of function, but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification
[2:30:36.340 --> 2:30:40.300]  research. So, you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right. They don't quite
[2:30:40.300 --> 2:30:43.380]  know what they're talking about calling it gain of function. You know, that's why he
[2:30:43.380 --> 2:30:47.020]  didn't perjure himself. That's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating
[2:30:47.020 --> 2:30:51.340]  new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do. But in the main definition, it's
[2:30:51.340 --> 2:30:55.940]  still a gain of function. You're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[2:30:55.940 --> 2:31:00.900]  Thank you, Mike. We love you. It has been noted by many a historian. The first casualty
[2:31:00.900 --> 2:31:08.580]  of war is the truth. And the next big casualty isn't even the people that died. No, that
[2:31:08.580 --> 2:31:15.580]  is very, very follows. But first there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty
[2:31:15.580 --> 2:31:20.900]  and speech and massive censorship. And now across the world from the United States to
[2:31:20.900 --> 2:31:31.020]  Europe, legislation is being introduced, that if you amplify any quote pro Russian information,
[2:31:31.020 --> 2:31:36.220]  you can be censored. You can be arrested. You can be a president. And of course now
[2:31:36.220 --> 2:31:41.980]  Canada's introduced legislation, that if you have a thought crime, and they think you may
[2:31:41.980 --> 2:31:48.540]  have the intent to engage in hate speech online, that you will be censored and arrested. Ladies
[2:31:48.540 --> 2:31:53.140]  and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world
[2:31:53.140 --> 2:31:58.540]  against humanity that makes them forward.com more important than ever. The purpose of fear
[2:31:58.540 --> 2:32:03.860]  is to call us into action. And there is plenty to be afraid of today. Half the population
[2:32:03.860 --> 2:32:09.420]  has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told
[2:32:09.420 --> 2:32:14.340]  to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease. The perpetrators of all this have
[2:32:14.340 --> 2:32:20.020]  clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence
[2:32:20.020 --> 2:32:25.420]  hive mind in less than nine years. For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know
[2:32:25.420 --> 2:32:30.620]  this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see. But there is only two things
[2:32:30.620 --> 2:32:36.220]  to do. We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game. If enough people awaken
[2:32:36.220 --> 2:32:41.620]  from the cold spell, then we win. But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days
[2:32:41.620 --> 2:32:46.700]  of convenience are soon coming to an end. And so we must prepare, get up to a years worth
[2:32:46.700 --> 2:32:53.660]  of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and lifesaving
[2:32:53.660 --> 2:33:11.100]  knowledge at N4store.com Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[2:33:11.100 --> 2:33:28.460]  who found it the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show.
[2:33:28.460 --> 2:33:43.340]  It's a program. You remember Jocelyn Elders was the nominee to be the Surgeon General
[2:33:43.340 --> 2:33:48.860]  when Bill Clinton first got in office in 1993. And I remember Limbaugh played the clips a
[2:33:48.860 --> 2:33:54.580]  lot. It's very hard to find it out there, but it's out there of her in a speech she
[2:33:54.580 --> 2:34:01.340]  gave saying, it's important to teach little children how to masturbate by age two. Reach
[2:34:01.340 --> 2:34:10.140]  down and help them, touch them, show them. That's how she talks. And you ask, why do
[2:34:10.140 --> 2:34:15.700]  they do that? Well, it's to sexualize children and train children that adults are touching
[2:34:15.700 --> 2:34:25.300]  them. It's pedophilia. And in 1984, which is based on a Stalinist future, and George
[2:34:25.300 --> 2:34:32.380]  Arwell had been a Damian Socialist who worked with economists and things he knew about it.
[2:34:32.380 --> 2:34:36.380]  In the book, they hand out porn to everybody when they're kids so that no one ever forms
[2:34:36.380 --> 2:34:40.900]  a lasting relationship. The studies show the more porn you watch, things like that, the
[2:34:40.900 --> 2:34:45.180]  more partners you have, the less chances are you'll actually form a bonding relationship
[2:34:45.180 --> 2:34:49.780]  and have a family. So it's about not having children. Just like transgenderism is about
[2:34:49.780 --> 2:34:54.540]  not having children. That's why it's pushed. I don't hate the individuals that are doing
[2:34:54.540 --> 2:34:58.860]  it, just don't target children, in my view. But the point I'm getting at here is I'll
[2:34:58.860 --> 2:35:03.500]  go to your calls, these clips, and I'll get to this next segment, is that they're now
[2:35:03.500 --> 2:35:11.060]  having not just summer camps where biological men are with fourth and fifth graders in the
[2:35:11.060 --> 2:35:17.460]  camps with them and in the cabins, but now they're having liberal masturbation camps
[2:35:17.460 --> 2:35:26.260]  where mothers bring their children and then these weirdos show them how to sexually assault
[2:35:26.260 --> 2:35:34.380]  their children, in my view, is what it is. I mean, this is just sick. And this is going
[2:35:34.380 --> 2:35:46.220]  on in Austin where they are sending out summer camps and actually springtime camps for adults
[2:35:46.220 --> 2:35:51.180]  to bring their children to these adult camps to, quote, teach them how to masturbate. It's
[2:35:51.180 --> 2:35:57.060]  just next level. So I'm going to be getting more of that coming up, but the leader of
[2:35:57.060 --> 2:36:01.500]  sexy camp recommends that children begin to masturbate as toddlers. Masturbation is really
[2:36:01.500 --> 2:36:05.780]  healthy and I recommend it to people of all ages. All ages, as soon as my nephews could
[2:36:05.780 --> 2:36:11.340]  talk, they were doing it. So that's my children talk between eight months and one year. So
[2:36:11.340 --> 2:36:19.420]  that's unbelievable. It's called sexy sex. It's the image of a butt, sexy summer camp
[2:36:19.420 --> 2:36:24.940]  schedule. If you go to Target, there's just stuff about all sorts of sex and sexy baby
[2:36:24.940 --> 2:36:32.220]  and it's all just very pedophilic. This workshop will include discussion, games, and some hand
[2:36:32.220 --> 2:36:38.780]  on practice. Let's just go to it now. This is going all over Twitter right now. That's
[2:36:38.780 --> 2:36:46.500]  why you have New York Times, Washington Post, Salon, Forbes, all coming out saying what's
[2:36:46.500 --> 2:36:51.460]  wrong with pedophilia. It's a good thing. It's loving. That's why the Germans under
[2:36:51.460 --> 2:36:57.940]  the CIA placed per city thousands of children as young as age three with men to rape them.
[2:36:57.940 --> 2:37:03.220]  They said this is how you form the new love. DW.com has it all. And then earlier last year
[2:37:03.220 --> 2:37:07.140]  they was reported even to the New Yorker magazine. People told New Yorker magazine, hey, you
[2:37:07.140 --> 2:37:11.380]  don't understand. This is love. Take a child at three from their parents. Give it to a
[2:37:11.380 --> 2:37:17.140]  man that rapes them. At age seven, they're then put in sex dungeons. And I'm not joking.
[2:37:17.140 --> 2:37:20.100]  And this is what the public schools are. This is what the schools want your kids to
[2:37:20.100 --> 2:37:24.740]  wear, mask, and take all these shots. They want to rape them one way or another. This
[2:37:24.740 --> 2:37:33.820]  whole agenda. So go ahead and play the sickening video of where this blob is. It might even
[2:37:33.820 --> 2:37:37.300]  be a useful idiot that actually thinks this is all good and doesn't even know what it
[2:37:37.300 --> 2:37:43.420]  is. But the whole agenda, the whole system is sexualization of children and getting children
[2:37:43.420 --> 2:37:48.340]  used like the TSA. Psychologists admit not blaming the TSA's as themselves, but touching
[2:37:48.340 --> 2:37:51.620]  little kids and then the federal law and state law said it was illegal. So now if you're
[2:37:51.620 --> 2:37:56.220]  under 12, I don't touch you. I've sickened with a man rubbing the back of his hand over
[2:37:56.220 --> 2:38:03.940]  my genitals. It's how pedophiles test a child and test people and get them used to the abuse
[2:38:03.940 --> 2:38:13.180]  and prepare them for the big finale. So look at these people. I mean, if you're a TV viewer,
[2:38:13.180 --> 2:38:20.940]  look at these women. And remember that the San Francisco Choir said we're going to recruit
[2:38:20.940 --> 2:38:24.700]  your children. We're going to get them their Rs. And I said, I guarantee you, you do a background
[2:38:24.700 --> 2:38:28.060]  check on those guys. You're going to find a bunch of child rapists. I said, do background
[2:38:28.060 --> 2:38:32.660]  checks, go out and get the plates of drag queen story times all over the country and
[2:38:32.660 --> 2:38:38.900]  go run their plates legally with PIs and they busted them all over the country. About half
[2:38:38.900 --> 2:38:48.060]  the time they were convicted child rapists. But see now it's the normal thing. Oh, no,
[2:38:48.060 --> 2:38:53.260]  no, bring your child and we're going to hands on show you and with a group of a bunch of
[2:38:53.260 --> 2:38:59.820]  weird fat women standing around and you got drag queen story time at hotels in Austin
[2:38:59.820 --> 2:39:03.340]  where people bring their little children, little girls, little boys and men put money
[2:39:03.340 --> 2:39:21.660]  in their G strings. Oh, it's a workshop $500. Sexy sex ed, sexy sex ed virtual sexy summer
[2:39:21.660 --> 2:39:27.740]  camp sex with me, self pleasure, reproductive help, the basics, gender diversity, talk it
[2:39:27.740 --> 2:39:34.180]  out relationships. Let's talk about sex over sexualization and policing of blackness. Sexy
[2:39:34.180 --> 2:39:37.820]  trans sex ed. What does black lives matter say the main mission is getting black men
[2:39:37.820 --> 2:39:42.860]  to add their generals cut off sex managed abortion info share pelvic floor health is
[2:39:42.860 --> 2:39:47.460]  for everybody. I'm not going to listen to these women about that the three P's P poop
[2:39:47.460 --> 2:39:54.380]  and pleasure. Oh, of course it's got to do with P and poop sex on drugs eugenics in Appalachia
[2:39:54.380 --> 2:40:04.820]  contraceptive options, sex sector body trauma, cycle tracking, closing celebration. Gotta
[2:40:04.820 --> 2:40:17.740]  reach down to the baby and touch it's peanuts. Oh, they get the thrill and how many of these
[2:40:17.740 --> 2:40:21.660]  people were abused as children themselves. And it's all they know. We don't know, but
[2:40:21.660 --> 2:40:27.780]  it should be investigated in a legal lawful peaceful way. Look at all the eyes on these
[2:40:27.780 --> 2:40:38.940]  people. I mean, this is a pervert convention. A pervert convention. And there I bet money
[2:40:38.940 --> 2:40:43.540]  half of them are school teachers. And the other half are social workers and college
[2:40:43.540 --> 2:40:50.580]  professors or college instructors. Go ahead and roll the video. That's how we should,
[2:40:50.580 --> 2:40:56.100]  you know, like get down with yourself, explore your own body. Mastervation is really healthy.
[2:40:56.100 --> 2:41:01.900]  And I recommend it to people of all ages, all ages. As soon as my nephews could talk,
[2:41:01.900 --> 2:41:07.300]  they were doing that. That's what they were doing. Kids touch themselves. Kids start to
[2:41:07.300 --> 2:41:12.460]  ask questions and we teach them the language for their bodies, right? That's your nose,
[2:41:12.460 --> 2:41:16.740]  touch your nose, show auntie, you can touch your nose. But my sister's not saying that
[2:41:16.740 --> 2:41:21.700]  when they're tugging at their penis, right? But it feels good, right? We have to learn
[2:41:21.700 --> 2:41:26.620]  ways to talk to young people about this so that they know how to explore their body consensually
[2:41:26.620 --> 2:41:31.340]  so that it's not in public, right? We don't want people exploring their bodies in public.
[2:41:31.340 --> 2:41:38.220]  That's not consensual. But exploring your body at any age, grandmas, grandpas, all of
[2:41:38.220 --> 2:41:43.220]  us need to be exploring our body. And that's the key. It's not consensual when a one year
[2:41:43.220 --> 2:41:49.820]  old has you touching their penis. They're not of age to make that consensual decision
[2:41:49.820 --> 2:41:57.980]  to engage in incest activity. Oh, you pick up on that too? And these people are so far
[2:41:57.980 --> 2:42:04.900]  gone that everything with them is the coming out. So now we're seeing this whole pedophilic
[2:42:04.900 --> 2:42:09.860]  coming out, this whole public schools putting kitty litter boxes in Michigan that was confirmed
[2:42:09.860 --> 2:42:13.780]  telling kids to crap in boxes. It's a bunch of mentally ill, whacked out people that are
[2:42:13.780 --> 2:42:20.460]  all into different pervert fetishes who literally want to rule us and say, we're coming for
[2:42:20.460 --> 2:42:28.780]  your children. They belong to us. We're going to get them. This is the true horror. This
[2:42:28.780 --> 2:42:36.140]  is video we shot in Austin. This is what goes on. It's all backed by Big Tech and the Tabas
[2:42:36.140 --> 2:42:45.220]  Stock Institute. All ages, babies need to be sexually assaulted to teach them the pleasure
[2:42:45.220 --> 2:42:52.260]  by their parents. That is the evil of the new world order. And that is the mutilization
[2:42:52.260 --> 2:42:59.020]  of the children with the transgenderism with a ride back. It's hard to believe that we're
[2:42:59.020 --> 2:43:05.740]  already into March 2022. And in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that
[2:43:05.740 --> 2:43:12.540]  was going of our flagship product, X3, that has all three types of the amazing iodine
[2:43:12.540 --> 2:43:18.620]  your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body, your immune
[2:43:18.620 --> 2:43:23.100]  system, your stamina, your libido, so much. And the majority of the population in the
[2:43:23.100 --> 2:43:28.820]  world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine out there. So we had on sale 50%
[2:43:28.820 --> 2:43:32.860]  off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or isn't going to come in for a long
[2:43:32.860 --> 2:43:37.500]  time. So I took it back to full profits. And I was just thinking, you know what, we need
[2:43:37.500 --> 2:43:42.140]  to funds in now to stay on air. Plus, this is the right product everybody needs. So
[2:43:42.140 --> 2:43:46.660]  incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it yourself
[2:43:46.660 --> 2:43:52.260]  and support the broadcast. I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out. Get X3 right
[2:43:52.260 --> 2:43:58.420]  now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off. I've been fighting as hard as I can
[2:43:58.420 --> 2:44:04.060]  for almost 28 years against the globalist. I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to
[2:44:04.060 --> 2:44:09.420]  wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational. But we
[2:44:09.420 --> 2:44:14.020]  failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but
[2:44:14.020 --> 2:44:20.140]  they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization, great reset. And that's
[2:44:20.140 --> 2:44:24.220]  why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[2:44:24.220 --> 2:44:28.860]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[2:44:28.860 --> 2:44:32.180]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda. We've
[2:44:32.180 --> 2:44:35.980]  also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high quality

[2:44:57.380 --> 2:45:02.780]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[2:45:02.780 --> 2:45:07.340]  a healthier life. Info wars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your
[2:45:07.340 --> 2:45:12.820]  system of a supplement that contains both. This info wars life offering vitamin C plus
[2:45:12.820 --> 2:45:17.940]  zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the info war store. The rose hips contained
[2:45:17.940 --> 2:45:24.380]  within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[2:45:24.380 --> 2:45:29.180]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[2:45:29.180 --> 2:45:33.900]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[2:45:33.900 --> 2:45:38.660]  shown. As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an
[2:45:38.660 --> 2:45:43.780]  important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[2:45:43.780 --> 2:45:48.860]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[2:45:48.860 --> 2:45:53.940]  like here in America. So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarstore.com

[2:46:59.260 --> 2:47:09.260]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:47:09.260 --> 2:47:15.020]  All right, I'm going to go right to your phone calls. We got a caller from Italy and others
[2:47:15.020 --> 2:47:19.100]  that have been patiently holding. I appreciate folks like Aaron and others staying there.
[2:47:19.100 --> 2:47:26.540]  I want to get to you and Mike, but I get blindsided by news about this Democrat party group, sexy
[2:47:26.540 --> 2:47:32.380]  sex that it turns out is funded by Black Lives Matter and Think Blue, a big Soros group.
[2:47:32.380 --> 2:47:39.180]  So you cannot make that up. It's called Act Blue. So this is the Democratic Party, ladies
[2:47:39.180 --> 2:47:47.820]  and gentlemen. This is who they are. And it is just unbelievable the things they do for
[2:47:47.820 --> 2:47:55.060]  having a sex camp to teach people, in my opinion, how to assault children. She's like, well,
[2:47:55.060 --> 2:48:02.340]  you know, I start teaching my family when they're one year old or when they can talk.
[2:48:02.340 --> 2:48:09.500]  Unbelievable evil. These people are just lost devils. I tell you, it's why you got to get
[2:48:09.500 --> 2:48:13.220]  your children out of public school. The colleges are gone. It's all gone. It's all lost. They
[2:48:13.220 --> 2:48:17.220]  look like zombies when you go around them. I mean, any leftist area, the children look
[2:48:17.220 --> 2:48:21.020]  like they've had their souls sucked out by a giant traffic spider or something. It's
[2:48:21.020 --> 2:48:29.660]  so sad. So, Rario, in Italy, thank you for holding and thank you for calling. What's
[2:48:29.660 --> 2:48:32.500]  your take on Ukraine and the World War and NATO?
[2:48:32.500 --> 2:48:40.300]  Okay, thank you, Alex. I was in the NATO for many years. Unfortunately, and I discover
[2:48:40.300 --> 2:48:47.460]  bad things like you discover too about these people. Anyway, we got a letter last week
[2:48:47.460 --> 2:48:53.660]  from the Italian Army, and if you want, I can email it to you, which they're calling
[2:48:53.660 --> 2:49:03.860]  all the people born from 1970 to 1980. And we got to go to the base, very close to her
[2:49:03.860 --> 2:49:10.740]  town, and they do the physical and be ready for go to the war, which I guarantee you,
[2:49:10.740 --> 2:49:20.740]  NATO, is they're getting war to Russia and China be attacked US and Iran be attacked Israel.
[2:49:20.740 --> 2:49:28.100]  I told Olin long time ago, this is be happened and it be a very nuclear. This is by the Bible.
[2:49:28.100 --> 2:49:35.620]  It's the East Hall versus Jacob and the wrong person at the best person in this part. It's
[2:49:35.620 --> 2:49:42.140]  the Pope we got in Rome, unfortunately. Is this the chief command for all these people?
[2:49:42.140 --> 2:49:45.140]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:49:45.140 --> 2:49:48.980]  Thank you, sir. Don't hang up. You don't get more information from you, but if we can put
[2:49:48.980 --> 2:49:54.340]  that back on screen, that's Bosnia with NATO troops going up by the Russian border. There
[2:49:54.340 --> 2:49:59.100]  are NATO troops, missiles, tanks, everything massing, and you're saying you were formerly
[2:49:59.100 --> 2:50:03.500]  in the military and that you've gotten a letter preparing to recall everybody going
[2:50:03.500 --> 2:50:09.780]  back 30 years. Have you ever heard of such a mobilization of Italian forces like this?
[2:50:09.780 --> 2:50:15.300]  No, never.
[2:50:15.300 --> 2:50:20.620]  Well, show tips at infowars.com or Rob D, Rob's good at checking his email, R-O-B-D,
[2:50:20.620 --> 2:50:26.740]  just the initial D, at infowars.com, and send us that letter, sir. We'd like to publish
[2:50:26.740 --> 2:50:30.740]  it and then take a snip out of what you had to say and add it to the article. Anything
[2:50:30.740 --> 2:50:32.660]  else you'd like to add?
[2:50:32.660 --> 2:50:38.780]  I want to say God bless you, and I want to tell you, they call it, in Europe, Putin,
[2:50:38.780 --> 2:50:44.620]  it's the prophet. They say he's the prophet. So everybody love him, and he protecting
[2:50:44.620 --> 2:50:54.140]  all the nuclear base in Ukraine, which some legionnaire or some private military organization,
[2:50:54.140 --> 2:51:00.620]  they try to blow up and blame Russia. He want to protect this nuclear thing. And like Hillary
[2:51:00.620 --> 2:51:09.220]  Clinton paid their bitch, I'm sorry, my language, she want to start this war with Russia. God
[2:51:09.220 --> 2:51:10.220]  bless you, sir.
[2:51:10.220 --> 2:51:16.460]  Well, I know this with mainline classical liberals, with conservatives, with people all over Europe,
[2:51:16.460 --> 2:51:22.580]  with a lot of big names, they're all pro-Putin. You know, me personally, I just see this as
[2:51:22.580 --> 2:51:27.420]  a real disaster, but I understand why Putin did it, but you're right. The West has had
[2:51:27.420 --> 2:51:32.100]  everybody turn against him, because they're not Westerners, they're globalist, and it
[2:51:32.100 --> 2:51:36.900]  is a very, very dangerous point to be in society, and I'm personally praying for peace. Please
[2:51:36.900 --> 2:51:40.940]  send us that letter, sir, and thank you for the call, from Italy.
[2:51:40.940 --> 2:51:47.020]  Wow. I'm going to go to Aaron and Mike here in just a moment, and we try to get to everybody
[2:51:47.020 --> 2:51:50.780]  here ahead of the next special guest host, Wayne Allen Root, taking over, but I got to
[2:51:50.780 --> 2:51:54.580]  say this or we won't be here anymore. Hell, we might not be here soon anyways, nuclear
[2:51:54.580 --> 2:51:59.300]  war, but we have great products you need, and so many of the products we've had, because
[2:51:59.300 --> 2:52:02.900]  we won't cut the quality, we can't get any more. That's why a lot of best-selling products,
[2:52:02.900 --> 2:52:09.180]  supplements are discontinued, because we won't cut the quality, and it's insane, and so many
[2:52:09.180 --> 2:52:13.620]  of the great products we've had are hard to get in, we got to now buy them 10, 20, 25
[2:52:13.620 --> 2:52:19.580]  weeks out, depending on the product. So when products are available, I would get them.
[2:52:19.580 --> 2:52:26.940]  We're offering X3 for your immune system, your body, and for other issues at 50% off,
[2:52:26.940 --> 2:52:30.660]  despite the fact that we're not going to get more for at least 10 weeks. I haven't put
[2:52:30.660 --> 2:52:33.620]  the order in for more, because I don't have extra money. So we have to kind of sell what
[2:52:33.620 --> 2:52:38.420]  we have, and be able to order the rest of stuff. So we're offering it at 50% off at
[2:52:38.420 --> 2:52:42.180]  infowarstore.com, and what it does to your whole body is just amazing. It's all three
[2:52:42.180 --> 2:52:46.020]  types of good iodine, the deep-growth crystal iodine, two other types, 50% off. There's
[2:52:46.020 --> 2:52:49.780]  big runs on iodine out there right now, and we've got it in stock, ready to ship to you.
[2:52:49.780 --> 2:52:55.060]  I would stock up on it. Also, winter sun, highest quality D3 with vitamin K for your
[2:52:55.060 --> 2:52:59.900]  immune system, taking out of the tongue. You can't beat it. It's 50% off, and brain force
[2:52:59.900 --> 2:53:05.580]  ultra, next level, Nutrubic, very fast acting, and I like it because it wears off quick.
[2:53:05.580 --> 2:53:10.620]  Turbo force lasts 8 to 10 hours, brain force 5 to 6 hours, it's amazing. The brain force
[2:53:10.620 --> 2:53:14.620]  plus the pill, there's the powder of the pill, and then this is the liquid, totally different
[2:53:14.620 --> 2:53:22.300]  formula. It is next level, Nutrubic. infowarstore.com, it is 40% off as well. Get a book, get a
[2:53:22.300 --> 2:53:27.340]  film, get a water filter, get an air filter. If you don't have water filters right now,
[2:53:27.340 --> 2:53:31.780]  you're crazy. We've got the best ones, the lowest price you're going to find at infowarstore.com,
[2:53:31.780 --> 2:53:37.860]  the Alexa Pure Pro. All right, let's go back to the phone calls. Let's go to Mike in Illinois
[2:53:37.860 --> 2:53:47.260]  and then Aaron in FEMA Region 6. Go ahead, Mike. Alex, we are exiting a preplanned pandemic,
[2:53:47.260 --> 2:53:54.580]  and we are entering a preplanned nuclear war. Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State visited
[2:53:54.580 --> 2:54:01.940]  Putin in Russia at his private residence. Fast forward, Donald Trump gets elected as
[2:54:01.940 --> 2:54:09.060]  president, and he's not even allowed to speak to Putin. I knew when she went to Russia for
[2:54:09.060 --> 2:54:16.540]  that meeting that there was some type of key meeting. I think that they discussed wildlife
[2:54:16.540 --> 2:54:23.420]  preservation. I think wildlife preservation means depopulation. Alex, do you saw that?
[2:54:23.420 --> 2:54:26.900]  I mean, I remember her bragging that she spent, I think she said five hours with him in his
[2:54:26.900 --> 2:54:34.020]  private office at his home. Yes, so I think, I don't know what they discussed, but my gut
[2:54:34.020 --> 2:54:39.140]  tells me that they will do nukes, but they will be limited and they will be here and there,
[2:54:39.140 --> 2:54:48.260]  and they will be used to scare the population and scatter the herd. I know this. All the big
[2:54:48.260 --> 2:54:51.700]  elites are building their bunkers and moving into them right now, and it's just an insane time,
[2:54:51.700 --> 2:55:01.780]  brother. Yeah, it's crazy, but I think people got to keep a level head. We're not all going to
[2:55:01.780 --> 2:55:07.460]  get incinerated. It's going to be nukes here and there, just like in Orwell's 1984, where they
[2:55:07.460 --> 2:55:14.180]  always had the war out in the outskirts to keep everybody on their toes. In my opinion,
[2:55:14.180 --> 2:55:19.540]  just keep an eye out for, okay, a nuke went off here or there, and now we all need to get rid of
[2:55:19.540 --> 2:55:24.980]  ours. Well said, Mike. Well said. We know there's a lot of behind-the-scenes deals. We know Biden
[2:55:24.980 --> 2:55:28.500]  said, go ahead and invade. We're not going to attack you to get him to invade. I mean, I think at
[2:55:28.500 --> 2:55:32.100]  that level, there's definitely signaling going on because then he'll use that as a distraction,
[2:55:32.100 --> 2:55:37.460]  use it for the great reset. It's just unbelievable. Very, very dangerous time. Thank you. All right,
[2:55:37.460 --> 2:55:45.060]  Erin in FEMA Region 6. That's Texas in a few other areas. Welcome, Erin. Hey, Alex. First,
[2:55:45.060 --> 2:55:49.940]  I want to plug your Saturday broadcast. I think that was your most compelling and informative show
[2:55:49.940 --> 2:55:57.700]  to date to win. We need all to be on the same page and doing the same thing, so we move like a
[2:55:57.700 --> 2:56:03.620]  machine. We need to all be using the same language. We, the patriots, need to flee and migrate to
[2:56:03.620 --> 2:56:08.500]  Texas and Florida, where we will have strengthened numbers and also be able to trust our neighbors
[2:56:08.500 --> 2:56:14.100]  and work with them and barter with them in the future. We need to grow our own food. We need to
[2:56:14.100 --> 2:56:20.340]  support local farms. We need to teach our children what is going on as they are resilient and deserve
[2:56:20.340 --> 2:56:26.580]  to know the truth. We need to journal and document what is happening for future generations as this
[2:56:26.580 --> 2:56:32.820]  knowledge shouldn't die with us. And remember, if they attack, don't fire until you see the whites
[2:56:32.820 --> 2:56:39.620]  of their eyes. God bless you, Alex, and God bless America. Wow. And get a mask, get a gas mask while
[2:56:39.620 --> 2:56:46.980]  you're at it. All right, Erin. Great, great points. Anything else? That's all, sir. I so appreciate
[2:56:46.980 --> 2:56:52.660]  you. I think we need to abandon their satanic world. They have created and star our own.
[2:56:53.700 --> 2:56:57.860]  I totally agree. I totally agree. Thank you so much. And it won't be a utopia.
[2:56:57.860 --> 2:57:04.020]  They always take some of the bad with us, but nothing. I mean, the left is a disease. They're
[2:57:04.020 --> 2:57:09.700]  a fallen, their victims of the devil. I mean, they're literally gone and they're hateful and they
[2:57:09.700 --> 2:57:13.780]  hiss at us and everything because they're not people anymore, folks, and they want to take us
[2:57:13.780 --> 2:57:18.660]  with them. And when you come to that realization that they're like gremlins, lobotomized gremlins,
[2:57:18.660 --> 2:57:24.420]  it's very sad. You just need to get away from them. Don't engage them and just stay away from them.
[2:57:24.420 --> 2:57:29.300]  And then try to find people that you can save and people that aren't under full demonic gremlin
[2:57:29.300 --> 2:57:34.100]  control yet. I mean, that's really what this comes down to. This is a spiritual blight that's
[2:57:34.100 --> 2:57:38.340]  hit us. And with it comes death and war. With it comes disease and pestilence with us.
[2:57:38.980 --> 2:57:43.380]  With it comes hell. He was on a white horse and death followed. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:57:48.020 --> 2:57:53.220]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great info wars listeners and viewers.
[2:57:53.220 --> 2:58:00.100]  If you will simply get x3 with all three types of good iodine that boosts your immune system and
[2:58:00.100 --> 2:58:04.980]  help everything that goes on your body at the cellular level, it will change your life. It
[2:58:04.980 --> 2:58:11.300]  will invigorate you. It will empower you. Almost everyone has iodine deficiency. Look into it
[2:58:11.300 --> 2:58:17.860]  for yourself as the opposite of fluoride. It's the good halogen and then your purchase of x3
[2:58:17.860 --> 2:58:22.180]  funds our operation. Now a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because
[2:58:22.180 --> 2:58:27.460]  of the lockdowns and supply chain breakouts. We were sold out of x3 for a long time and I had it
[2:58:27.460 --> 2:58:31.620]  on sale for 50% off. A lot of folks were getting it and I was thinking, you know what? I'm going to
[2:58:31.620 --> 2:58:36.420]  bring it back on sale again just until it sells out because even though we won't make as much
[2:58:36.420 --> 2:58:40.500]  money in the long run, a lot of folks need this product and we need to get the money from the
[2:58:40.500 --> 2:58:46.020]  sales in now to stay on air. See your x3 right now at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[2:58:46.020 --> 2:58:53.780]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training probably not as much as they
[2:58:53.780 --> 2:58:59.620]  should be but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarstore.com. Before I set out
[2:58:59.620 --> 2:59:05.060]  on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going. You know,
[2:59:05.060 --> 2:59:11.300]  besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy
[2:59:11.300 --> 2:59:16.660]  and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy giving me the best chance at
[2:59:16.660 --> 2:59:23.220]  getting through the training. And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones Sorilis. I have bad joints.
[2:59:23.220 --> 2:59:28.180]  Thanks mom. So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus
[2:59:28.180 --> 2:59:33.860]  inflammation support and extra flexibility. The quick release capsules help me recover fast
[2:59:33.860 --> 2:59:38.580]  so I can get back to the training. Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon,
[2:59:38.580 --> 2:59:43.540]  good news turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day
[2:59:43.540 --> 2:59:46.500]  and Sorilis can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[2:59:50.340 --> 2:59:54.340]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:59:59.380 --> 3:00:06.980]  And I heard as it were the noise of thunder. One of the four beasts saying come and see
[3:00:06.980 --> 3:00:11.460]  me and I saw and behold a white horse.
[3:00:21.780 --> 3:00:30.420]  There's a man going around taking things and he decides who to free and who to blame.
[3:00:30.420 --> 3:00:37.380]  All right, I got some news during the break that was like a punch in the stomach and I'm going to
[3:00:37.380 --> 3:00:40.900]  go ahead and cram in two more calls here. I'm going to come back, cover this in hand of a ton
[3:00:42.020 --> 3:00:48.340]  to Wayne Allen Root. But yeah, go ahead and bring me that now. Thank you.
[3:00:48.340 --> 3:00:51.300]  And then I was reading it during the break and left it over there on the desk. Thank you.
[3:00:51.300 --> 3:01:02.260]  Thank you. This information is just unbelievable.
[3:01:03.300 --> 3:01:06.500]  And guys, print me the links that are in this too. So I have those. I'm going to cover it next
[3:01:06.500 --> 3:01:15.940]  segment. We just got one step closer to nuclear war. One step very close to it. One giant step.
[3:01:15.940 --> 3:01:23.300]  Not for mankind, but against mankind. Jill on Louisiana. Thanks for holding
[3:01:23.300 --> 3:01:28.500]  you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, I just want to say first off, I love you,
[3:01:28.500 --> 3:01:32.180]  my brother in Christ and all the other brothers and sisters in Christ around the globe.
[3:01:32.980 --> 3:01:39.620]  Thank you for what you do. I was, I recently got a book from a fifth Tony Robbins.
[3:01:40.180 --> 3:01:44.740]  It's called Life Force. And the more I've been reading this, the more it's freaking me out.
[3:01:44.740 --> 3:01:52.740]  He went to the Vatican. The Pope is involved in this very deeply. They're talking about using
[3:01:52.740 --> 3:02:00.100]  artificial intelligence to simulate and test and solve all your problems. It's like scientific
[3:02:00.100 --> 3:02:07.140]  miracles. And they want to bring this about by 2030 with nanobots in your blood. It's creepy.
[3:02:07.780 --> 3:02:11.860]  I didn't know if you've heard of it yet. I was given that book and I intend to try to read it.
[3:02:11.860 --> 3:02:15.940]  I'm glad that you just reminded me that that was given to me last Friday.
[3:02:16.820 --> 3:02:20.820]  I think it was that book when I was in Florida. Is any opening up a medical clinic?
[3:02:21.460 --> 3:02:26.980]  Yes. Yes, it's disturbing. It's pretty disturbing. They want to use AI. I haven't read the whole book
[3:02:26.980 --> 3:02:32.500]  yet, but just the fact that they did this with the Pope and the Vatican. And after all the medical
[3:02:32.500 --> 3:02:37.540]  tyranny that we've been suffering, and now they're going to do this, I'm just, I just feel like, wow,
[3:02:37.540 --> 3:02:43.140]  these shots that they're killing people with, they may be cutting off people's souls from God.
[3:02:43.140 --> 3:02:47.460]  This may be the second part of it. And then they're going to blow us up with nukes.
[3:02:47.460 --> 3:02:52.020]  Okay, they're going to get rid of all of us. Tony Robbins has criticized the globalists and
[3:02:52.020 --> 3:02:56.260]  stuff. I've got to read the book first. And of course, there's always people saying they've got
[3:02:56.260 --> 3:02:59.860]  this and that. Medical miracles is kind of like Theranos. I'm not saying what he's doing is like
[3:02:59.860 --> 3:03:04.500]  Theranos. I've investigated it yet, but I'm going to definitely look into it. But the whole biomedical
[3:03:04.500 --> 3:03:11.380]  claims of what they'll do in general is greatly exaggerated. Thank you for the call. Mike in
[3:03:11.380 --> 3:03:18.340]  Ohio, Mike, you're on the air. Go ahead. Yeah, hi, Alex Jones. Yes, sir. Okay, nice to talk to you
[3:03:18.340 --> 3:03:24.820]  today. Nice talk to you. So listen, I'm calling from Cleveland, Ohio, calling about the gas.
[3:03:24.820 --> 3:03:33.220]  So if we think back a few years ago when when the gas prices were quite expensive, you know,
[3:03:34.820 --> 3:03:41.460]  at least equivalent to what they are now, see, my problem is, you know, back then when the cost
[3:03:41.460 --> 3:03:48.820]  was so high, everything else was on a normal amount. And now we're getting stuck in situations
[3:03:48.820 --> 3:03:54.340]  where everything's going up. Yep, it's real hyperinflation coming because of the great reset
[3:03:54.340 --> 3:03:59.220]  all the now be blamed on Russia. Isn't it convenient? Yeah, so convenient. So let me ask you this.
[3:03:59.220 --> 3:04:04.420]  Here's a question. And when is somebody going to ask these people in this administration?
[3:04:05.220 --> 3:04:10.420]  What does the administration say to us common civilians that are starting to feel the strength
[3:04:10.420 --> 3:04:15.220]  here? They actually have the clips. They say that Biden's helping you and his policies are
[3:04:15.220 --> 3:04:21.940]  making it cheaper for you. Fauci's and sake and all of them gaslight everybody. And then
[3:04:21.940 --> 3:04:26.900]  and then they say that it's all Putin's fault, even though it's all the globalist fault,
[3:04:26.900 --> 3:04:32.660]  turn of the power off, Mike, it's sick. This is amazing. Always right. This is an upside down
[3:04:32.660 --> 3:04:38.500]  calm world. And this is not good for us. Brother, I could talk to you another hour, but I've got
[3:04:38.500 --> 3:04:42.420]  to go, Mike. Thanks for holding. I appreciate your call. Wayne Allen route. That's something
[3:04:42.420 --> 3:04:46.900]  authors syndicated columnist is about to take over. But huge news just broke. So I'm going to come back
[3:04:46.900 --> 3:04:51.460]  for two minutes on the other side and then hand the baton to Wayne Allen route. This is the biggest
[3:04:51.460 --> 3:05:00.420]  news yet on the Russia situation. And it is bad when run contact tracers aren't coming. They're
[3:05:00.420 --> 3:05:05.540]  here all over the world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany. These
[3:05:05.540 --> 3:05:10.100]  tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening
[3:05:10.100 --> 3:05:16.340]  in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their facilities. And they're planning
[3:05:16.340 --> 3:05:21.700]  in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people
[3:05:21.700 --> 3:05:26.420]  away and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than martial law. And one
[3:05:26.420 --> 3:05:31.220]  big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here
[3:05:31.220 --> 3:05:37.220]  in America and are very compliant, meaning US government military grade at infowarstore.com.
[3:05:37.220 --> 3:05:42.980]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to shift to you when you visit infowarstore.com.
[3:05:42.980 --> 3:05:47.940]  Again, we have big backpacks. We have special dry bags. We've got them for cell phones. We've got
[3:05:47.940 --> 3:05:53.540]  them for laptops. We've got them for iPads. It's all there at infowarstore.com. So protect your

[3:05:57.380 --> 3:06:13.620]  Welcome back into hour number four. I'm Alex Schoens, your host, Wayne Allen Root is about to
[3:06:13.620 --> 3:06:18.500]  take over. I will hand the baton to him in T minus two minutes. And then the war room
[3:06:19.140 --> 3:06:24.820]  is coming up at 3pm central in about 54 minutes from now with the great Owen Schreuer.
[3:06:24.820 --> 3:06:29.780]  Well, here it is. Zero Hedges reporting on it. It's got links to the financial times of London
[3:06:29.780 --> 3:06:33.540]  and others. I hope this plan gets killed. We've been hearing a lot about it in the last three days.
[3:06:33.540 --> 3:06:38.660]  The Secretary of State said this is indeed going to happen, that the US would give them new jets,
[3:06:38.660 --> 3:06:44.260]  and then Poland would give these older migs who are still highly effective to the Ukrainians. And
[3:06:44.260 --> 3:06:49.220]  the Russians have said that is an act of war, which it is. Poland has made available all of its
[3:06:49.220 --> 3:06:55.220]  MiG-29 jets for US to transfer to Ukraine. And that's why the Secretary of State said two days ago
[3:06:55.220 --> 3:07:00.180]  we're going to then backfill their jets. I saw the spokesperson for the Pentagon yesterday
[3:07:00.740 --> 3:07:05.940]  say that indeed they're looking at sending US jets tank-killing A-10 warthogs.
[3:07:06.820 --> 3:07:10.900]  The authorities of the Republic of Poland after consultations between the President of the
[3:07:10.900 --> 3:07:16.660]  government are ready to deploy immediately and free of charge all their MiG-29 jets
[3:07:16.660 --> 3:07:21.380]  to Romstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the government of the United States of America.
[3:07:22.100 --> 3:07:25.620]  So we're getting a lot of mixed signals on this, but there's some of the articles.
[3:07:25.620 --> 3:07:30.500]  US works with Poland to provide Ukraine with fighter jets financial times. This is extremely
[3:07:30.500 --> 3:07:36.740]  dangerous. They've been talking about it for days, but now they're discussing actually doing it.
[3:07:36.740 --> 3:07:40.500]  Let's look at some of the other articles here that deal with all of this.
[3:07:40.500 --> 3:07:47.780]  Biden announces ban on Russian energy imports, which Putin says is a declaration of war.
[3:07:48.580 --> 3:07:54.180]  And then you have a NATO US exercise with the Pentagon 2019 and the quote,
[3:07:54.180 --> 3:08:00.420]  the NATO Russia war starting in Ukraine that kills at least a billion people.
[3:08:02.100 --> 3:08:08.740]  That is the reality of what we are faced with right now. And that's why this is so incredibly
[3:08:08.740 --> 3:08:14.740]  dangerous. We played the clips the start of the show of Biden saying going in and backing Ukraine
[3:08:14.740 --> 3:08:20.020]  would start a war with Russia. We've got Lindsey Graham saying we're fighting him over there to
[3:08:20.020 --> 3:08:25.380]  not fight him here. We've got Adam Schiff saying the same thing and Soros bragging.
[3:08:25.380 --> 3:08:30.900]  This is incredible. They have started this. Doesn't mean I back what Putin did. He's walked into a
[3:08:30.900 --> 3:08:35.860]  trap. Incredible. We'll be covering it more in the room today. Wayne Allen Root is loaded for
[3:08:35.860 --> 3:08:39.460]  bear. He takes over now from his studios in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[3:08:42.740 --> 3:08:48.580]  All right, Alex, thank you. As usual, I find myself on the same side as Alex. I'm certainly not a
[3:08:48.580 --> 3:08:54.500]  fan of Russia or Putin never have been. But I'm the guy that's been shouting from the highest
[3:08:54.500 --> 3:09:00.180]  mountains. I've always considered myself like a Paul Revere, right? I don't invent anything.
[3:09:00.180 --> 3:09:05.540]  I don't produce anything. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a scientist. But I'm the guy who yells the
[3:09:05.540 --> 3:09:10.500]  Russians are coming. The Chinese are coming. The vaccines are killing you. I'm a guy who spreads
[3:09:10.500 --> 3:09:16.740]  information that people need to know. And I've been warning for a couple of weeks now that if you
[3:09:16.740 --> 3:09:21.300]  didn't believe the media about the rigged and stolen election, if you know the election was
[3:09:21.300 --> 3:09:26.100]  stolen and you know the media lied to you and you didn't believe the media about the vaccines,
[3:09:26.100 --> 3:09:30.580]  and you know the media lied to you and people are dying because the media lie and because the
[3:09:30.580 --> 3:09:37.700]  media was paid off. Now it turns out, oh, was I right? Fox News and Newsmax took the money
[3:09:37.700 --> 3:09:44.100]  from the Biden administration to lie and to cover up and to mislead about the vaccines,
[3:09:44.100 --> 3:09:49.060]  the COVID vaccines. So if you didn't believe the media on the first one, the rigged election,
[3:09:49.060 --> 3:09:54.740]  you didn't believe the media on the second one, COVID vaccines, why would you believe the media
[3:09:54.740 --> 3:10:01.940]  about Ukraine Russia? Maybe the scenes you're seeing are meant to get you to love Ukraine
[3:10:01.940 --> 3:10:09.620]  and Zelensky and hate Putin and Russia so that you support America getting involved in World War
[3:10:09.620 --> 3:10:18.580]  III, destroying the oil industry, $10 a gallon gasoline, it's already $7.25 at stations in California,
[3:10:18.580 --> 3:10:27.060]  $7.25 a gallon. This will wipe out the middle class. This will usher in a new age of bankruptcy
[3:10:27.060 --> 3:10:32.580]  and disaster for the middle class. This will wipe out jobs by the millions. Are you willing to give
[3:10:32.580 --> 3:10:38.980]  up your job and you're home and become homeless for Ukraine? I know I'm not. Are you willing to
[3:10:38.980 --> 3:10:44.020]  let your kids die for Ukraine? I'm not. I'm not saying I'm on Russia's side. I'm not saying Putin
[3:10:44.020 --> 3:10:49.540]  isn't a bully. I'm not saying Putin isn't a madman. I'm not saying Putin isn't really attacking
[3:10:49.540 --> 3:10:54.740]  Ukraine. Of course he is. But the images you're seeing on it, just like COVID was real, but the
[3:10:54.740 --> 3:11:00.820]  images you saw on the screen were meant to make you scared to death. So you supported lockdowns,
[3:11:00.820 --> 3:11:06.420]  business shutdowns, school shutdowns, vaccine mandates, mask mandates, all the things that
[3:11:06.420 --> 3:11:11.220]  ripped our country and our economy apart. What makes you think the exact same thing
[3:11:11.220 --> 3:11:17.540]  isn't happening in Ukraine? Every image is meant to make you believe that America's
[3:11:17.540 --> 3:11:22.420]  got to get involved. And if it means World War II and if it means $10 a gallon gas,
[3:11:22.980 --> 3:11:31.380]  heck if it means $15 a gallon gas, we got to do it. This is madness. The entire world's economy
[3:11:31.380 --> 3:11:38.740]  is in danger right now. A great friend of mine who is a brilliant economist, financial guru,
[3:11:38.740 --> 3:11:44.100]  stock market expert, his name is Kip Erich. And Kip called me two days ago, literally almost in
[3:11:44.100 --> 3:11:48.660]  the middle of the night. And he said, Wayne, my friends in New York are so scared, all the
[3:11:48.660 --> 3:11:53.620]  billionaire hedge fund managers, the brightest guys on Wall Street, who have been right again
[3:11:53.620 --> 3:11:59.220]  and again, are scared to death that A, we're getting into World War III and B, by taking away
[3:11:59.220 --> 3:12:05.220]  all of Russia's financial system, the underpinnings of it and destroying all the money, they're wiping
[3:12:05.220 --> 3:12:12.500]  out the American financial system. He said it's all underpinned by Russian money. The Russian
[3:12:12.500 --> 3:12:18.580]  oligarchs have billions and they give it out in loans. And if you take it away and the money
[3:12:18.580 --> 3:12:24.500]  that Russia has, you take it away. The entire world credit system and the entire world financial
[3:12:24.500 --> 3:12:30.340]  system could collapse and it could happen in days or in a couple of weeks. And we're all scared to
[3:12:30.340 --> 3:12:36.020]  death. Thank you, Kip, for educating me on how bad this really is, how we're on the edge of the abyss
[3:12:36.020 --> 3:12:43.300]  right now over a little country, Ukraine. It reminds me of Vietnam, a little crappy country,
[3:12:43.300 --> 3:12:49.940]  Vietnam. And they sent, what, 60,000 of your children and grandchildren to die there for nothing.
[3:12:49.940 --> 3:12:54.740]  And in the end, we pulled out and let them take over anyway. What was the point of Vietnam?
[3:12:54.740 --> 3:12:59.300]  I'm a conservative Republican. When I was like six and seven and eight years old, I was supporting
[3:12:59.300 --> 3:13:04.980]  Vietnam. I went to school and told my teachers, I'm for the Vietnam War. I'm for Richard Nixon.
[3:13:04.980 --> 3:13:10.180]  I love Nixon. I was a Republican when I was three. And I got literature for Barry Goldwater.
[3:13:10.180 --> 3:13:16.740]  But I was fooled by the military industrial complex. This is BS. We don't need a war over Ukraine.
[3:13:17.300 --> 3:13:24.740]  This is insanity. So I wrote the column that got a lot of play over the weekend on, you know,
[3:13:24.740 --> 3:13:29.780]  the fact that this, you need your red pill, remember the movie, you know, the movie, the
[3:13:29.780 --> 3:13:34.580]  Matrix, the red pill or the blue pill, the red pill tells you what's going on, right? You need
[3:13:34.580 --> 3:13:38.820]  your red pill or you need your blue pill. I forgot now which one it is. I think it's the red pill,
[3:13:38.820 --> 3:13:45.300]  right? But you need the pill that wakes you up so that you understand that Democrats and
[3:13:45.300 --> 3:13:51.140]  communists, for whatever reason, I'm going to give them credit here. They're very smart. They play
[3:13:51.140 --> 3:13:57.300]  chess at such a high level. Well, we're playing checkers or all of our politicians are either
[3:13:57.300 --> 3:14:03.060]  dumb and playing checkers or they're bribed or blackmailed or a combination of bribed and blackmail,
[3:14:03.060 --> 3:14:07.460]  which you could see with Biden and the Biden crime family. You know, he's been bribed,
[3:14:07.460 --> 3:14:12.260]  unbelievably, but he's also been blackmailed because of his son and his own cheating and
[3:14:12.260 --> 3:14:18.580]  stealing. Biden stole money clearly. But again, it's my opinion. So I can't get sued. He's a public
[3:14:18.580 --> 3:14:23.540]  figure and I'm giving my opinion a public figure. It's very clear he's the biggest thief, the biggest
[3:14:23.540 --> 3:14:29.940]  traitor, the biggest committer of fraud and extortion in the history of America. He makes Hillary
[3:14:29.940 --> 3:14:36.260]  Clinton look like a piker. He stole so much money from Ukraine and China and Hunter Biden involved
[3:14:36.260 --> 3:14:42.820]  with what appeared to be underage girls in videos. So there's blackmail, there's bribery,
[3:14:42.820 --> 3:14:49.620]  they got him by the short hairs. Biden is corrupt. Biden is owned by China. So is John Kerry. John
[3:14:49.620 --> 3:14:54.100]  Kerry is probably owned by Iran. Why else would you do an Iran deal? That's the worst deal in the
[3:14:54.100 --> 3:14:59.700]  history of the world. And big America gives a pipsqueak terrorist country everything they want
[3:14:59.700 --> 3:15:05.300]  and then some why and lets them get a nuclear weapon with no oversight. Why? Because John Kerry is
[3:15:05.300 --> 3:15:13.460]  probably my opinion, making a cut of the deal. Iran's giving John Kerry $100 million, a half
[3:15:13.460 --> 3:15:19.220]  billion dollars, maybe even a billion dollars in a Swiss bank account or a Cayman or Belize bank
[3:15:19.220 --> 3:15:24.020]  account. I don't know where the account is, but it's offshore outside the reach of United States
[3:15:24.020 --> 3:15:30.980]  authorities. John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, they're all rich on your taxpayer dollars.
[3:15:30.980 --> 3:15:36.340]  They use their office to enrich themselves and their friends and get rich. And the Ukraine War
[3:15:36.340 --> 3:15:43.140]  is an extension of that. Every single dollar we send Ukraine and every weapon, I'll bet you,
[3:15:43.140 --> 3:15:48.100]  my opinion, a piece of all of it is going in the pocket of the Biden crime family,
[3:15:48.100 --> 3:15:53.140]  the Clinton crime family, the Kerry crime family. We'll be back with more in a sec. Wayne Allero.

[3:17:54.580 --> 3:18:01.620]  It's a match made in heaven. So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training
[3:18:01.620 --> 3:18:06.900]  probably not as much as they should be but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowars
[3:18:06.900 --> 3:18:13.220]  store.com. Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I

[3:18:35.860 --> 3:18:41.540]  support they need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility. The quick release

[3:18:58.100 --> 3:19:05.140]  that we're already into March 2022. And in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that
[3:19:05.140 --> 3:19:12.820]  was going of our flagship product X3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs
[3:19:12.820 --> 3:19:19.220]  for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina,
[3:19:19.220 --> 3:19:24.900]  your libido, so much. And the majority of the population of the world is iodine deficient.
[3:19:24.900 --> 3:19:30.020]  This is the very best iodine out there. So we had on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half of
[3:19:30.020 --> 3:19:35.460]  what we have or isn't going to come in for a long time. So I took it back to full process. I was
[3:19:35.460 --> 3:19:40.100]  thinking, you know what, we need the funds in now to stay on air plus this is the right product
[3:19:40.100 --> 3:19:45.300]  everybody needs. So incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience
[3:19:45.300 --> 3:19:50.820]  with yourself and support the broadcast. I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out.
[3:19:50.820 --> 3:19:55.220]  Get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[3:19:55.220 --> 3:20:03.380]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:12.820 --> 3:20:17.780]  All right, I'm live. Wait on the root guest host for the Alex Jones show for the great Alex Jones.
[3:20:17.780 --> 3:20:22.420]  I love the man. I think he's he's a guy wakes up. He is the red pill, right? I think I got it right.
[3:20:22.420 --> 3:20:28.100]  You're not going to believe this. I never watched the matrix. I work 24 hours a day,
[3:20:28.100 --> 3:20:35.620]  seven days a week. And I don't watch very much TV or movies. So I've never watched the matrix. I work
[3:20:35.620 --> 3:20:41.460]  like 15, 16 hours a day. I work out two hours a day in the gym. And then the rest of the day,
[3:20:42.260 --> 3:20:46.100]  that's my sleep time, which is just a couple hours. So I just don't watch movies. I've never
[3:20:46.100 --> 3:20:49.940]  watched the matrix, but I think it's the red pill versus the blue pill, whatever it is. It's
[3:20:49.940 --> 3:20:54.420]  time for you to get some information. So the Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book is my
[3:20:54.420 --> 3:20:58.980]  best selling book, number one bestseller on many categories on Amazon for several months.
[3:20:58.980 --> 3:21:04.020]  And I think it offers an opportunity to open your eyes and to help take this country back. The
[3:21:04.020 --> 3:21:09.380]  Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book, please get a copy. It's not just a book. Everybody writes
[3:21:09.380 --> 3:21:14.820]  books. Anyone can write a book. It's got solutions. And then it's got a resource guide in the back
[3:21:14.820 --> 3:21:20.260]  with the names of the top 120 corporations in America that screw over conservatives every day
[3:21:20.260 --> 3:21:24.420]  and we have to go over them. There it is. Great Patriot Protest book. And then I give you the
[3:21:24.420 --> 3:21:30.100]  phone numbers to reach the CEO and the email to reach the CEO and the social media accounts
[3:21:30.100 --> 3:21:35.620]  of the CEO and or the company and the mailing address to reach the CEO and the board of directors
[3:21:35.620 --> 3:21:41.460]  and the names of the board of directors. So you can now take five minutes a day and fire off emails
[3:21:41.460 --> 3:21:45.700]  or make a phone call and tell these companies how you think you're a conservative. You're not going
[3:21:45.700 --> 3:21:52.660]  to buy from them ever again. And the number one thing that I think is kind of a good example
[3:21:52.660 --> 3:21:58.660]  of my philosophy, which is Dr. Martin Luther King, civil disobedience is the Canadian truckers and
[3:21:58.660 --> 3:22:03.620]  then the American truckers that have been watching in the last few days. That's how we win back the
[3:22:03.620 --> 3:22:09.300]  country against these evil people that are owned by the devil, by Satan, by Lucifer. They're horrible.
[3:22:09.300 --> 3:22:14.260]  And by the way, don't think I'm exaggerating. Their playbook is Rules for Radicals by Saul
[3:22:14.260 --> 3:22:19.460]  Linsky. And the first page says the book is dedicated to Lucifer. And that's their playbook
[3:22:19.460 --> 3:22:26.580]  on the left. They actually are idolizing the devil. These people are sick in the head. They're
[3:22:26.580 --> 3:22:30.980]  mentally ill and they're evil. And they don't want to hurt us. They don't want to beat us in
[3:22:30.980 --> 3:22:36.100]  elections. They want to kill us. And a great example, of course, is the vaccines on the guy
[3:22:36.100 --> 3:22:41.380]  from the day one. And my guess is the only other guy in the country from day one was Alex Jones,
[3:22:41.380 --> 3:22:46.740]  who has a real show, radio TV and was out there saying, don't take the vaccines. I'm worried
[3:22:46.740 --> 3:22:51.780]  about it. And Alex, I'm sure was out there day one. I was out there from day one saying it scared
[3:22:51.780 --> 3:22:55.700]  the bejesus out of me that nobody should listen to government. Think about it. When has government
[3:22:55.700 --> 3:23:00.740]  ever been nice to you, been kind to you, been right led you in the right direction? Why would you
[3:23:00.740 --> 3:23:06.100]  ever trust government? And they rushed the vaccines into production. And then next thing you know,
[3:23:06.100 --> 3:23:11.060]  it's backed by no control group at all. If you don't know what I mean by that, every vaccine
[3:23:11.060 --> 3:23:16.180]  in history, every drug in history has control groups, 50 people on this side, 50 on the other,
[3:23:16.180 --> 3:23:20.020]  it's probably 10,000 on one and 10,000 on the other. But to make it simple, let's say 100 on
[3:23:20.020 --> 3:23:25.220]  one side, 100 on the other, this 100 gets the vaccine, this 100 does it. Let's watch what
[3:23:25.220 --> 3:23:31.540]  happens them in three months, six months, a year, 10 years, you've got to follow people for 10 years
[3:23:31.540 --> 3:23:36.420]  and a billion dollars to $2 billion to get FDA approval for any drug or any vaccine.
[3:23:36.980 --> 3:23:42.420]  There was no control group for the vaccine. They don't know if in three months, six months, a year
[3:23:42.420 --> 3:23:47.940]  or 10 years, you will lose all fertility, you will drop dead of cancer, heart attacks, stroke,
[3:23:47.940 --> 3:23:53.620]  blood clot, you will die of multi organ failure, you will grow three noses and five years,
[3:23:53.620 --> 3:23:59.620]  you will look like you're radioactive. They have no idea they never did because there is no control
[3:23:59.620 --> 3:24:05.540]  group and there never was except for 30 days. They had a control group for 30 days and then they
[3:24:05.540 --> 3:24:12.340]  decided it was mean to withhold the vaccine from the other 100 people saying the control group.
[3:24:12.340 --> 3:24:17.700]  So they merged the two groups together and gave them all the vaccine. Oh my God, that violates
[3:24:17.700 --> 3:24:25.540]  every principle in the history of science. It violates efficacy. It violates every human law.
[3:24:25.540 --> 3:24:31.860]  You can't give everyone the same vaccine because you'll have no idea who's sick and who's alive
[3:24:31.860 --> 3:24:37.380]  and what caused it. That's how they delivered the vaccines to all of you. And then the government
[3:24:37.380 --> 3:24:42.340]  came out and said the vaccines are great. Take them. And you all know I love President Trump.
[3:24:42.340 --> 3:24:46.660]  Next week I'm going on my honeymoon. I got married in November, didn't have a chance to get away.
[3:24:46.660 --> 3:24:51.140]  We're going on our honeymoon next week to Mar-a-Lago. I'm staying at President Trump's home
[3:24:51.140 --> 3:24:56.020]  and country club. Staying there. I love the guy, but he's been wrong on one issue, the vaccines.
[3:24:56.020 --> 3:25:00.820]  But that's okay. He learned. He learned. I made a very strong statement in all the media. And I
[3:25:00.820 --> 3:25:05.300]  said he's got to go after the vaccine mandates and stop bragging about the vaccines. And ever
[3:25:05.300 --> 3:25:09.860]  since then, he's done that. He's fantastic. He got the right message. He understood conservatives
[3:25:09.860 --> 3:25:14.820]  don't want him bragging about the vaccine because my belief is millions will die from
[3:25:14.820 --> 3:25:18.660]  this vaccine eventually. It's going to start cascading soon. It's going to be a blizzard.
[3:25:18.660 --> 3:25:21.620]  It's going to be an avalanche. It's going to be a tsunami. It's going to be an earthquake. It's
[3:25:21.620 --> 3:25:26.340]  going to be a tornado. How do you like those analogies? Whipped them up off the top of my head.
[3:25:26.340 --> 3:25:31.460]  It's going to be an avalanche of death. It's getting worse every day. So many people are dying
[3:25:31.460 --> 3:25:37.060]  from the vaccine. So many are sick for life. Just as an example, just my own accountant.
[3:25:37.060 --> 3:25:41.300]  One of my accounts. I have several of them, but one of my accounts got the vaccine. It's a woman.
[3:25:41.300 --> 3:25:46.820]  She got the vaccine and then she literally almost lost the site. She almost went blind for life
[3:25:46.820 --> 3:25:51.860]  site in both her eyes because her retinas detached from a shingles attack in her eyes
[3:25:51.860 --> 3:25:56.820]  within days of getting the vaccine. And then she was rushed to the hospital
[3:25:56.820 --> 3:26:02.660]  and she almost died. All of her organs shut down. I think if I remember her story from the drugs
[3:26:02.660 --> 3:26:07.140]  they gave her, her organs shut down and they thought she was going to die. And then she lived,
[3:26:07.140 --> 3:26:12.500]  but one eye is gone and the other eye is weak. And she's in constant pain and has constant
[3:26:12.500 --> 3:26:17.620]  shingles attacks and never had them before and has only had them since getting vaccinated.
[3:26:17.620 --> 3:26:22.580]  This is just one example. So she's not listed as a death. She's listed as an injury,
[3:26:22.580 --> 3:26:27.220]  an adverse effect. That doesn't sound so bad. That's not as bad as death, right? When I tell you
[3:26:27.220 --> 3:26:32.260]  about deaths by the thousands from the COVID vaccine, that sounds bad and it's happening.
[3:26:32.260 --> 3:26:35.540]  But when you say someone had an injury, well, maybe it doesn't mean anything. Maybe it means
[3:26:35.540 --> 3:26:39.380]  they stubbed their toe. Maybe it means for a day they had a headache. Maybe it means for a day
[3:26:39.380 --> 3:26:46.020]  they had a cough. I'm telling you, the injuries people are getting are heart attacks, strokes,
[3:26:46.020 --> 3:26:51.620]  blood clots, multi-organ failure, massive autoimmune attacks on their own body,
[3:26:51.620 --> 3:26:57.460]  and massive shingles herpes attacks that are so painful. It's blinding. Forget about her being
[3:26:57.460 --> 3:27:02.100]  blinded or eyes from the shingles attacking your eyes and detaching. It's shingles attacks
[3:27:02.100 --> 3:27:06.660]  any when your body are the most, I have heard, thank God I've never had one, are the most painful
[3:27:06.660 --> 3:27:13.060]  thing you've ever felt in your life. You can't touch your arm against literally the wind blowing,
[3:27:13.060 --> 3:27:17.940]  against a piece of cloth. You have to wear short-sleeved shirts because the pain for the
[3:27:17.940 --> 3:27:23.460]  shingles is that bad. That's what this causes. Anyway, back to Ukraine. So if you heard all
[3:27:23.460 --> 3:27:29.540]  of what I just said about COVID and you realized that Newsmax and Fox News, it's now proven,
[3:27:29.540 --> 3:27:35.380]  took bribes from the federal government to lie to you about COVID and mislead you about COVID.
[3:27:35.380 --> 3:27:41.380]  Even your friends at Newsmax and Fox News took the money and ran and never again were allowed to
[3:27:41.380 --> 3:27:46.260]  let any anchor host say anything negative about the vaccines and never allowed to have a guest
[3:27:46.260 --> 3:27:51.460]  not who said anything negative about the vaccines. And to my knowledge, this is a fact. But I'll say
[3:27:51.460 --> 3:27:57.300]  allegedly, my opinion, I heard it from Emeril Robertson. It used to be on Fox News, Newsmax,
[3:27:57.300 --> 3:28:01.540]  a White House correspondent, and she wrote a story this weekend that spilled all the beans
[3:28:01.540 --> 3:28:06.580]  that said that they were both Fox News and Newsmax, took literally, along with other networks,
[3:28:06.580 --> 3:28:12.260]  a billion dollars from the Biden administration to be always positive and run positive ads
[3:28:12.260 --> 3:28:18.260]  about vaccines and never allow a single guest to besmirch or warn you of the dangers or deadliness
[3:28:18.260 --> 3:28:21.780]  of the vaccines. So why would you now believe what the same government
[3:28:21.780 --> 3:28:28.020]  and the same media is telling you about Ukraine? Story this morning that George Soros and Hillary
[3:28:28.020 --> 3:28:33.940]  Clinton are cheering on the war with Russia. Of course they are. Biden has destroyed the United
[3:28:33.940 --> 3:28:40.820]  States, the energy industry, inflation, groceries, home prices, rental prices, the open borders,
[3:28:40.820 --> 3:28:47.060]  the disaster in Afghanistan, the list is long. Our country is a disaster like under Jimmy Carter.
[3:28:47.060 --> 3:28:52.180]  And they want to disguise it and distract you from it. And now you're starting to get the
[3:28:52.180 --> 3:29:20.660]  feeling we're about to enter World War III.
[3:29:22.180 --> 3:29:51.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the
[3:29:51.540 --> 3:30:02.660]  world against humanity. It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022. And in the month
[3:30:02.660 --> 3:30:09.460]  of February, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, X3, that has all
[3:30:09.460 --> 3:30:16.420]  three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in
[3:30:16.420 --> 3:30:22.340]  your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much. And the majority of the population
[3:30:22.340 --> 3:30:28.340]  of the world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine output. So we had on sale 50%
[3:30:28.340 --> 3:30:33.140]  off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or is it going to come in for a long time? So I
[3:30:33.140 --> 3:30:38.100]  took it back to full process. I was just thinking, you know what, we need to funds in now to stay
[3:30:38.100 --> 3:30:43.220]  on air. Plus this is the right product everybody needs. So to incentivize folks out there that
[3:30:43.220 --> 3:30:47.780]  have been on the fence, get X3 and experience it yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to
[3:30:47.780 --> 3:30:55.140]  keep it at 50% off until it sells out. Get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[3:30:56.420 --> 3:31:02.020]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying and
[3:31:02.020 --> 3:31:08.420]  empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain. And when it comes to information,
[3:31:08.420 --> 3:31:14.900]  boys, that's true today. We see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation,
[3:31:14.900 --> 3:31:21.380]  great recent combine, trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist
[3:31:21.380 --> 3:31:28.100]  nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and
[3:31:28.100 --> 3:31:34.420]  scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID-19 area, their world's
[3:31:34.420 --> 3:31:40.340]  going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it. And none of it can succeed,
[3:31:40.340 --> 3:31:46.180]  none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit. And that's
[3:31:46.180 --> 3:31:51.140]  why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence. And that's why it's hard
[3:31:51.140 --> 3:31:55.620]  to share info wars links and band up video links. That's why we've got to share them now more than
[3:31:55.620 --> 3:32:02.500]  ever. Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great info wars listeners and viewers.
[3:32:02.500 --> 3:32:09.300]  If you will simply get x3 with all three types of good iodine that boosts your immune system and
[3:32:09.300 --> 3:32:14.180]  help everything that goes on your body at the cellular level, it will change your life. It
[3:32:14.180 --> 3:32:20.500]  will invigorate you. It will empower you. Almost everyone has iodine deficiency. Look into it
[3:32:20.500 --> 3:32:27.060]  for yourself as the opposite of fluoride. It's the good halogen and then your purchase of x3
[3:32:27.060 --> 3:32:31.460]  funds our operation. Now a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because
[3:32:31.460 --> 3:32:36.740]  of the lockdowns and supply chain breakouts. We were sold out of x3 for a long time and I had it
[3:32:36.740 --> 3:32:40.820]  on sale for 50% off. A lot of folks were getting it and I was thinking, you know what, I'm going to
[3:32:40.820 --> 3:32:45.860]  bring it back on sale again just until it sells out because even though we won't make as much money
[3:32:45.860 --> 3:32:50.260]  in the long run, a lot of folks need this product and we need to get the money from the sales and
[3:32:50.260 --> 3:32:55.300]  now to stay on air. See your x3 right now at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[3:32:55.300 --> 3:33:03.620]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:12.500 --> 3:33:16.260]  All right, welcome back. Wayne Allerook, guest hosting for the Alex Jones show. For those of
[3:33:16.260 --> 3:33:20.900]  you who don't know me, I'm an SOB son of a butcher born on the wrong side of the tracks in
[3:33:20.900 --> 3:33:27.060]  Mount Vernon, New York on the Bronx borderline. I was the only Jew in a very overwhelmingly
[3:33:27.060 --> 3:33:31.060]  minority town, went to an all black middle school, all black high school, very different
[3:33:31.060 --> 3:33:35.860]  upbringing than any conservative in the media today. So I have a very different outlook
[3:33:35.860 --> 3:33:39.940]  on things. I had to fight my way to survive on the mean streets in New York. I had to fight my
[3:33:39.940 --> 3:33:44.500]  way to prove myself to all the people that were trying to attack me and hurt me and kill me
[3:33:44.500 --> 3:33:48.660]  and intimidate me and steal my lunch money and you name it, steal my homework,
[3:33:48.660 --> 3:33:52.420]  chase me on the way home from school. But I learned how to fight back and eventually I won
[3:33:52.420 --> 3:33:55.860]  and then I won all their respect. And then I walked tall and never had to do that ever again.
[3:33:55.860 --> 3:33:59.860]  Actually became a marshal at the school, carried a badge, made arrests, literally
[3:33:59.860 --> 3:34:05.140]  citizen arrests in the school hallways against guys much bigger than me, changed my life. All
[3:34:05.140 --> 3:34:09.860]  the people that run the Republican Party are a bunch of pussy cats. I'll say it that way because
[3:34:09.860 --> 3:34:14.100]  you're probably getting trouble if you say the wrong word on TV or radio. They're pussy cats
[3:34:14.100 --> 3:34:20.580]  and they spent their life playing golf at a country club with Chip and badminton with Muffy.
[3:34:20.580 --> 3:34:25.060]  And I didn't have that upbringing. I didn't have that luxury. So I understand the real world.
[3:34:25.060 --> 3:34:31.860]  Okay. My national radio show is every afternoon, three to six PM Pacific, six to nine PM east
[3:34:31.860 --> 3:34:37.300]  coast time, Monday through Friday on USA Radio Network. You can listen if you don't get it on
[3:34:37.300 --> 3:34:41.460]  your local radio station. You can listen online, which is where it seems like almost everybody
[3:34:41.460 --> 3:34:45.540]  now listens to me. I mean, I get thousands of fan mail a week and they all say they listen
[3:34:45.540 --> 3:34:52.020]  online. So go to USARadio.com and listen live on the stream or go to Odyssey on your phone.
[3:34:52.020 --> 3:34:56.740]  Odyssey is the number one streaming app in the United States of America. 40 million people
[3:34:56.740 --> 3:35:03.860]  listen to radio on Odyssey, A U D A C Y and they just took my show about two weeks ago.
[3:35:03.860 --> 3:35:08.180]  So I'm very proud to say you can get the Odyssey app on your iPhone or on your Android.
[3:35:08.180 --> 3:35:13.140]  And then you listen on the phone every day, three to six or six to nine east coast, three to six
[3:35:13.140 --> 3:35:19.700]  Pacific, five to eight central. I also want to mention my website, root for America.com is my
[3:35:19.700 --> 3:35:24.500]  website, root for America.com. That's where everything starts. There's my website. And
[3:35:24.500 --> 3:35:29.060]  you can buy my book there, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott book. You can read about the
[3:35:29.060 --> 3:35:34.500]  book. You can click on my podcast there. I podcast seven days a week. You can watch my video
[3:35:34.500 --> 3:35:39.620]  podcast there every Friday, Saturday and Sunday. You can watch my video commentaries there and
[3:35:39.620 --> 3:35:44.500]  you can read my written commentaries there and you get to my radio show, my national radio show.
[3:35:44.500 --> 3:35:49.620]  You just click and you're automatically listening to my national radio show when it's live. So all
[3:35:49.620 --> 3:35:55.220]  of that are ways to reach me. And then of course I love when you email me, Wayne root at gmail.com.
[3:35:55.220 --> 3:36:00.820]  I love to hear from my fans and friends, Wayne root at gmail.com. You give me all my best ideas
[3:36:00.820 --> 3:36:06.020]  for my shows. So good stuff happening. And a little birdie tells me soon I should have a TV show
[3:36:06.580 --> 3:36:10.260]  talking a bunch of different TV networks and they're all interested. So I'm guessing I'll pick
[3:36:10.260 --> 3:36:15.460]  up one of them. And so we'll have a daily TV show as well. So those are the things going on.
[3:36:15.460 --> 3:36:20.100]  And you can also get my opinions at all the biggest news stories the day a getter GTTR,
[3:36:20.100 --> 3:36:24.260]  which is the Twitter for me, the new Twitter, because I'm banned for life from Twitter.
[3:36:24.260 --> 3:36:27.780]  That's probably the best thing I could tell you about me. I'm banned for life from Twitter.
[3:36:27.780 --> 3:36:32.980]  Does that tell you that I'm good at what I do? I was attacked by the IRS for four years under
[3:36:32.980 --> 3:36:37.380]  Barack Obama. They tried to destroy my life. Does that tell you how good I am at what I do when
[3:36:37.380 --> 3:36:42.260]  they all want to get you, when they all want to destroy you, you know, you're good at what you
[3:36:42.260 --> 3:36:48.580]  do. I put out a tweet two years ago and the attorney general of a state tried to come after me
[3:36:48.580 --> 3:36:54.500]  for a tweet that told people what I take each day to be healthy. Can you, does that tell you
[3:36:54.500 --> 3:37:00.260]  how effective I am? Like Alex, liberals are looking and listening to every word I say
[3:37:00.260 --> 3:37:06.500]  to try and destroy me. Right wing watch, media matters. They all listen and record every
[3:37:06.500 --> 3:37:12.100]  single minute of my three hour daily radio show to try and take one sentence out of context and
[3:37:12.100 --> 3:37:16.740]  hang me with it. So obviously they're listening to everything I say and they're watching every
[3:37:16.740 --> 3:37:21.860]  social media post. Can you imagine an attorney general of a state has nothing better to do
[3:37:21.860 --> 3:37:27.700]  than to read my tweets and try and destroy me with one where I talk about what I take to be
[3:37:27.700 --> 3:37:34.580]  healthy? It's so bizarre that it's beyond belief. Okay. So look, I started to talk about this topic
[3:37:34.580 --> 3:37:39.060]  before we went to the break. It's so amazing to me that Emerald Roberts and the former White
[3:37:39.060 --> 3:37:44.580]  House correspondent for Newsmax has now disclosed and a FOIA request has confirmed,
[3:37:44.580 --> 3:37:50.660]  Freedom of Information quest has confirmed that government of Joe Biden spent a billion dollars
[3:37:50.660 --> 3:37:56.740]  and gave it out to TV networks, media companies and newspapers to convince them to run positive
[3:37:56.740 --> 3:38:03.460]  ads for COVID vaccine and to never, ever, ever, ever allow any hosts to see anything negative
[3:38:03.460 --> 3:38:08.420]  about COVID vaccine and to never allow any guests on to see anything negative about the COVID vaccine,
[3:38:08.420 --> 3:38:13.300]  which is why I used to be on Fox News all the time. I was one of their favorite guests.
[3:38:13.300 --> 3:38:19.140]  I could show you videos of several Fox News hosts saying, we love Wayne Root. Wayne,
[3:38:19.140 --> 3:38:23.860]  you're one of our favorite guests. Our audience loves you. And yet, I've never been allowed on
[3:38:23.860 --> 3:38:29.940]  again since the beginning of COVID. They've all been bought off and bribed every one of them.
[3:38:29.940 --> 3:38:35.300]  They gave them money to shut up and lie to you and they didn't care if their own viewers and fans
[3:38:35.300 --> 3:38:42.020]  died or got crippled for life or got shingles and their retinas is attached. They don't care,
[3:38:42.020 --> 3:38:48.420]  but nobody ever bribed me. I would not take the money and I've told you the truth from the first
[3:38:48.420 --> 3:38:53.540]  day. Now, let me tell you some things that I put out today on social media, obviously not Twitter,
[3:38:53.540 --> 3:38:58.820]  because I'm banned for life. But here's a, here's a, here's a post I put out together and I want
[3:38:58.820 --> 3:39:05.460]  to read it to you and then talk about it. Another disaster. And I was talking about Joe Biden
[3:39:05.460 --> 3:39:12.260]  announcing today that he's banning us from buying Russian oil. Another disaster. This decision was
[3:39:12.260 --> 3:39:18.980]  clearly forced by conservatives in the media, like me, who've been talking for days about how
[3:39:18.980 --> 3:39:26.020]  absurd it is that Joe Biden's making Russia the enemy and the most evil country and Putin is Hitler
[3:39:26.020 --> 3:39:32.740]  and at the same time buying a billion dollars a day of Russian oil. It shows you what a liar
[3:39:32.740 --> 3:39:39.380]  and fraud Biden is. So I said that, I wrote that, I said it on TV, I said it on my natural radio show,
[3:39:39.380 --> 3:39:44.180]  Wayne Allyn Root, Ron unfiltered on USA radio network. I said it on my podcast,
[3:39:44.180 --> 3:39:49.860]  War Raw. I said it in all those places and so did others. I'm sure, I'm sure Alex Jones said the
[3:39:49.860 --> 3:39:56.100]  same thing and many other really good conservative hosts said the same thing and Democrats watch
[3:39:56.100 --> 3:40:01.860]  everything we say to counteract it. So he went out and banned Russian oil. Now that would be great
[3:40:01.860 --> 3:40:06.180]  because I was saying how ridiculous it is. Why would you give the Russians a billion dollars a day
[3:40:06.180 --> 3:40:11.620]  if you and finance their war when you claim the war is evil and Russia's evil and Putin's evil?
[3:40:11.620 --> 3:40:15.780]  Well, guess what? They went out and did it. So I'd like to take credit for it, except for one
[3:40:15.780 --> 3:40:23.220]  little problem. They're morons. I didn't say to do it. Well, we don't create and produce and drill
[3:40:23.220 --> 3:40:28.980]  for oil in America. We've got to have our pipelines open. We've got to have coal. We've got to have
[3:40:28.980 --> 3:40:34.260]  drilling. We've got to have fracking. We've got to have all the energy companies working day and
[3:40:34.260 --> 3:40:39.380]  night, night and day in the United States for us to be allowed to do that. Or instead we're going
[3:40:39.380 --> 3:40:47.060]  to buy oil from Iran and Venezuela. How stupid are we? What a dumb country. What a dumb leadership.
[3:40:47.060 --> 3:40:53.380]  What a dumb government. But is it dumb? Or is this all the purposeful destruction of the
[3:40:53.380 --> 3:40:58.900]  United States of America? Because is this perfect? They're playing chess and we're playing checkers.
[3:40:58.900 --> 3:41:04.100]  While they're doing this, look at what's going to happen. There's going to be $8, $9, $10 gas
[3:41:04.100 --> 3:41:08.740]  maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's going to be $15 gas a gallon. You're going to bankrupt the whole
[3:41:08.740 --> 3:41:12.900]  middle class. You're going to destroy the whole American economy. You're going to kill capitalism.
[3:41:12.900 --> 3:41:17.940]  You're going to make everyone in America possible, dependent on government and wanting welfare and
[3:41:17.940 --> 3:41:23.060]  food stamps like a bird waiting for handouts. That's what you've done to America. No one's going
[3:41:23.060 --> 3:41:26.900]  to be able to afford to drive to work anymore. No one's going to be afford to go to a birthday party,
[3:41:26.900 --> 3:41:30.660]  a wedding, whatever it is, they're not going to get in their cars anymore. Who could spend $10
[3:41:30.660 --> 3:41:35.620]  a gallon on gas? So you've just killed the entire economy. You've wiped out the middle class.
[3:41:35.620 --> 3:41:40.740]  You made everyone dependent on government and how about as a bonus? Well, and you've ushered
[3:41:40.740 --> 3:41:46.820]  in the great reset where everyone's a slave and a surf and lives for government. But the bonus to
[3:41:46.820 --> 3:41:55.780]  all of this is you've just made green energy make sense. Green energy never, ever, ever made sense.
[3:41:55.780 --> 3:42:03.060]  Wind, sun, biofuel, electric cars, they're ridiculously expensive. The only cheap thing
[3:42:03.060 --> 3:42:09.060]  that works for the middle class is fossil fuels. But if fossil fuels no longer cost $2 a gallon
[3:42:09.060 --> 3:42:14.420]  or $3 a gallon, like they did other Trump, they cost $10 a gallon, then suddenly electric cars
[3:42:14.420 --> 3:42:19.300]  make sense. Suddenly green energy makes sense for the first time in history. And that's going to make
[3:42:19.300 --> 3:42:26.180]  all the Democrats and their friends filthy, freaking rich and in control of the entire energy
[3:42:26.180 --> 3:42:32.900]  industry and the American economy and put Exxon mobile and Chevron and Texaco and everybody
[3:42:32.900 --> 3:42:38.900]  else out of business who are all conservative leaning and fund conservative candidates. Brilliant.
[3:42:38.900 --> 3:42:45.460]  Brilliant. This is a game plan of the Democrat Party. They've managed to kill the oil industry,
[3:42:45.460 --> 3:42:50.820]  to kill the middle class, to kill capitalism, to kill American exceptionalism, and to usher in
[3:42:51.780 --> 3:42:54.980]  and green energy that makes them rich. That's what just happened.
[3:42:57.700 --> 3:43:02.580]  Two of our best selling products are back in stock, then FullWarStore.com. And they will
[3:43:02.580 --> 3:43:06.580]  sell out in the next three, four months before I get more of the product in if I sell it at full
[3:43:06.580 --> 3:43:12.980]  price. But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting one or sun or getting X3
[3:43:12.980 --> 3:43:18.740]  to try the products and see how amazing they are. And I believe you will then get hooked on them
[3:43:18.740 --> 3:43:23.940]  by myself, my family, and the crew are. So again, both these products are back in stock,
[3:43:23.940 --> 3:43:30.500]  both X3 and one or sun, they are 50% off for a limited time because they're going to sell out
[3:43:30.500 --> 3:43:36.580]  at this price I would estimate in less than a month. So this is your chance to get X3 and
[3:43:36.580 --> 3:43:40.260]  experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens. This is your chance to have the highest
[3:43:40.260 --> 3:43:45.220]  quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune system as well. They're amazing and they're in
[3:43:45.220 --> 3:43:51.460]  FullWarStore.com. And the reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation. I need funds to run
[3:43:51.460 --> 3:43:55.620]  the operation. You need to be healthy. We need to stay on air. It's a match made in heaven.
[3:43:57.540 --> 3:44:02.340]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul I've ever had in my
[3:44:02.900 --> 3:44:09.060]  47 years on this planet. I've had a lot of loss like everybody else has. And it's because
[3:44:09.060 --> 3:44:19.780]  it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[3:44:21.140 --> 3:44:27.860]  And now we're just throwing it all away. And I see the general public in a medically induced,
[3:44:27.860 --> 3:44:30.820]  scientifically induced, behavioral psychologically controlled
[3:44:30.820 --> 3:44:38.100]  tranty. And I know we're being fed into this globalist maker under and it's so incredibly sad.
[3:44:38.100 --> 3:44:45.540]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating
[3:44:45.540 --> 3:44:50.980]  collapsing and then coming back to life again. It's just the globalists are actively trying
[3:44:50.980 --> 3:44:56.260]  to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[3:44:56.260 --> 3:45:04.420]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022. And in the month of February we had a very
[3:45:04.420 --> 3:45:12.180]  popular sale that was going of our flagship product X3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine
[3:45:12.180 --> 3:45:18.900]  your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body, your immune system, your
[3:45:18.900 --> 3:45:25.140]  stamina, your libido, so much. And the majority of the population in the world is iodine deficient.
[3:45:25.140 --> 3:45:30.260]  This is the very best iodine out there. So we have on sale 50% off that we sold more than half of
[3:45:30.260 --> 3:45:35.300]  what we have, or isn't going to come in for a long time. So I took it back to full process.
[3:45:35.300 --> 3:45:39.940]  I was just thinking, you know what, we need the funds in now to stay on air. Plus this is a great
[3:45:39.940 --> 3:45:44.980]  product everybody needs. So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3
[3:45:44.980 --> 3:45:49.940]  and experience it yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until
[3:45:49.940 --> 3:45:57.220]  it sells out. Get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off. The first ten
[3:45:57.220 --> 3:46:03.060]  amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791. The first of these broadly
[3:46:03.060 --> 3:46:08.980]  protects the rights of free speech and free press. Free speech means the free and public
[3:46:08.980 --> 3:46:14.900]  expression of opinions without censorship, interference, and restraint by the government.
[3:46:14.900 --> 3:46:23.220]  231 years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious attack. GCN is under
[3:46:23.220 --> 3:46:28.580]  attack. Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not want you to know the truth.
[3:46:28.580 --> 3:46:35.460]  I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up and help us defend our right to continue

[3:46:53.860 --> 3:47:03.860]  I'm Vincent Finnelli. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:03.860 --> 3:47:16.260]  All right, Wade Alarook, guest hosting on the Alex Jones Show. WadeRoot.com. Love to hear from
[3:47:16.260 --> 3:47:20.180]  you in my book. Again, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book. It's the last segment. Boy,
[3:47:20.180 --> 3:47:24.020]  does this stuff go fast when you're enjoying yourself, not because things are going well
[3:47:24.020 --> 3:47:28.740]  in America. They're not, but because I am enjoying hanging out with you guys and telling you what I
[3:47:28.740 --> 3:47:34.660]  think, giving you my opinions, all raw truth, no holding back from the truth. The truth shall
[3:47:34.660 --> 3:47:41.460]  set you free. The truth shall set us free. Without the truth, we have nothing. Now we find out
[3:47:41.460 --> 3:47:48.740]  even we were backstabbed by even Newsmax and Fox News. And who knows how many conservative websites
[3:47:48.740 --> 3:47:54.500]  took the money from the Biden administration to refuse to discuss the negatives of the COVID vaccine.
[3:47:54.500 --> 3:47:57.940]  Let me tell you what all of this reminds me of. And let me give one more plug,
[3:47:57.940 --> 3:48:02.580]  my website, rootforamerica.com. Everything starts at rootforamerica.com. My books,
[3:48:02.580 --> 3:48:06.820]  my national radio show, you can listen live there, my podcast, you can listen there,
[3:48:06.820 --> 3:48:13.620]  all my commentaries, they're all there. Rootforamerica.com. Okay, so I'm very proud of the fact
[3:48:13.620 --> 3:48:19.220]  that I work out every single day and I work out about 90 minutes a day or so, sometimes two hours
[3:48:19.220 --> 3:48:23.620]  in the gym, but about 90 minutes of workout time, the other 30 minutes on my cell phone talking to
[3:48:23.620 --> 3:48:28.180]  people doing business deals and talking about politics. So I get 90 minutes of workout in every
[3:48:28.180 --> 3:48:34.340]  day in that two hour window. And the only way I could possibly get through a 90 minute workout
[3:48:34.340 --> 3:48:38.340]  is to have something great to watch on the screen in front of me. And I mentioned earlier in the
[3:48:38.340 --> 3:48:43.780]  show, I don't watch a lot of TV. At night, I don't. But that period in the gym is the only time
[3:48:43.780 --> 3:48:48.820]  that I turn on my TV and I watch something that inspires me that I really enjoy and then the
[3:48:48.820 --> 3:48:54.500]  90 minutes goes by fast. So about seven years ago in 2015,
[3:48:55.780 --> 3:49:00.580]  Trump had not even announced for president yet. And I'm on the treadmill and I'm watching a movie
[3:49:00.580 --> 3:49:07.540]  with Warren Beatty. Tell me the name again, the name again, Bulworth, Bulworth with Warren Beatty.
[3:49:08.100 --> 3:49:13.460]  And Bulworth is about a US senator running for reelection, who's getting killed by 20 points
[3:49:13.460 --> 3:49:18.580]  in the polls. And then he decides he wants to run for president after he's reelected and his staff
[3:49:18.580 --> 3:49:24.020]  thinks he's insane because he's down by 20 for senator. So I run for president and he decides
[3:49:24.020 --> 3:49:28.180]  he's going to take a risk and start telling the truth to everyone. He's going to literally
[3:49:28.820 --> 3:49:34.500]  sing the truth. And he starts singing and rapping what he thinks is the truth about politics. You
[3:49:34.500 --> 3:49:39.620]  know, hey, stop complaining because you're on welfare because you're a bum and everyone starts
[3:49:39.620 --> 3:49:45.860]  booing him. But then all of a sudden they go, Hey, he's right. And suddenly he gets huge crowds
[3:49:45.860 --> 3:49:50.660]  and they start cheering for him and cheering him on to tell the truth. And I wrote a commentary that
[3:49:50.660 --> 3:49:56.500]  said, this is Donald J. Trump. He should be our next president. That's why I met Trump. I never
[3:49:56.500 --> 3:50:01.860]  met him in my life. And Trump sends an email the next day after my column comes out. And it says,
[3:50:01.860 --> 3:50:07.060]  from the office of Donald J. Trump, and I open it, and it says see attached. And there's a personal
[3:50:07.060 --> 3:50:12.260]  handwritten note on Donald Trump stationary that says, Wayne, what a magnificent article. You're
[3:50:12.260 --> 3:50:18.340]  the best. Love the Bulworth analogy. And you will be very excited about what I'm about to announce
[3:50:18.340 --> 3:50:24.340]  soon. So I knew at that point he was going to run for president. That's how I met Donald Trump.
[3:50:24.340 --> 3:50:30.100]  And ever since then, he sent me nice notes about everything I wrote. Well, yesterday I was in the
[3:50:30.100 --> 3:50:37.220]  gym working out and I chose a movie to watch. And it was Braveheart with Mel Gibson. And I watched
[3:50:37.220 --> 3:50:41.060]  that movie over the last two days yesterday and today, because it's like a three hour movie. So
[3:50:41.060 --> 3:50:46.500]  I did 90 minutes yesterday, 90 minutes this morning. And you know what I found? It's today.
[3:50:46.500 --> 3:50:53.620]  It was a thousand years ago in Scotland and England. But it's today. We are living in Braveheart.
[3:50:53.620 --> 3:50:59.860]  It's a perfect analogy with what's going on today. Let me explain what Braveheart was about.
[3:51:00.500 --> 3:51:06.660]  Scotland wanted to be free and independent, the Scottish. But they were under the rule of England
[3:51:06.660 --> 3:51:12.740]  and their vicious, disgusting king, Longshanks, who wanted everything for himself. Every woman,
[3:51:12.740 --> 3:51:18.900]  every daughter, every dollar, everyone was under his control. And Scotland was under his control.
[3:51:18.900 --> 3:51:24.420]  And the Scottish people were led by this new hero, Sir William Wallace, who is Braveheart.
[3:51:24.420 --> 3:51:30.340]  And he led them to such magnificent victories that the king paid everybody off to entrap him
[3:51:30.340 --> 3:51:34.420]  and kill this guy, capture him and kill him. And eventually they did, by the way,
[3:51:34.420 --> 3:51:40.420]  said ending to the movie. But his death inspired a new battle. And it was the first time that the
[3:51:40.420 --> 3:51:46.580]  Scottish people ever actually defeated the British army on a battlefield and they won their independence.
[3:51:46.580 --> 3:51:54.260]  So first William Wallace, which is Mel Gibson, Braveheart, won battle after battle, small battles.
[3:51:54.260 --> 3:51:58.660]  And then they won the biggest battle of all after his death because he inspired them by being
[3:51:58.660 --> 3:52:05.220]  tortured and murdered by the British king and Longshanks. And so what's the point of the movie?
[3:52:05.220 --> 3:52:10.020]  Number one, everybody wants freedom. Every, the people want freedom. Those people are Donald
[3:52:10.020 --> 3:52:15.060]  Trump's voters. The little people of Scotland wanted freedom. America's blue collar, middle
[3:52:15.060 --> 3:52:20.340]  class, working class wants freedom. Then they're led by a brave hero who says, screw it, I'm going
[3:52:20.340 --> 3:52:25.780]  to tell the truth. That was Sir William Wallace, Mel Gibson, and that's Donald J. Trump. And then
[3:52:25.780 --> 3:52:30.660]  in between the problem is, and then you have the enemy, which is the king of England and all his
[3:52:30.660 --> 3:52:36.180]  army. And in America today, the enemy is the Democrat party. They're clearly of the devil,
[3:52:36.180 --> 3:52:41.140]  of Satan, of Lucifer. They're evil. They're horrible. They want to destroy America. They want
[3:52:41.140 --> 3:52:46.020]  to destroy the middle class. They want to make you broke and make you a ward of the state for
[3:52:46.020 --> 3:52:50.740]  the rest of your life, just like Longshanks wanted from you. But there was something amazing about
[3:52:50.740 --> 3:52:56.260]  the movie Braveheart that triggered my epiphany here, because there's something in between all
[3:52:56.260 --> 3:53:02.580]  those people. It was the noblemen of Scotland. They acted like they were on the side of the people
[3:53:02.580 --> 3:53:10.020]  of Scotland. But in reality, the king was bribing them with all kinds of goodies, land, hot women,
[3:53:10.020 --> 3:53:15.460]  hot daughters, sex on the first night of marriage, with anyone in Scotland getting married after
[3:53:15.460 --> 3:53:19.940]  the wedding ceremony. The king of England said, you, the noblemen of Scotland, have a right to
[3:53:19.940 --> 3:53:24.500]  have sex with that girl on the first night and then bring her back to her husband. So the noblemen
[3:53:24.500 --> 3:53:29.380]  said, hey, that's great. Let's screw over the Scottish people. We are a loyalty to the king of
[3:53:29.380 --> 3:53:35.460]  England. So the people, which is the Donald Trump voters, loved Braveheart, which is William Wallace,
[3:53:35.460 --> 3:53:41.220]  which is Mel Gibson. But the people now love Donald Trump. But we're being sold out by those
[3:53:41.220 --> 3:53:46.820]  noblemen. In Scotland, it was the Scottish noblemen. In America today, it's the Republican party.
[3:53:46.820 --> 3:53:52.820]  All the rhinos are selling us out and selling Donald Trump out and stabbing him in the back,
[3:53:52.820 --> 3:53:58.580]  just like the movie Braveheart. It just explored and explained everything that's happening in
[3:53:58.580 --> 3:54:04.740]  America today. Nothing ever changes. Scotland, England and Braveheart is America today.
[3:54:05.620 --> 3:54:10.180]  All right, let me let me read you something else that I put out today on social media.
[3:54:10.180 --> 3:54:18.660]  I warned you about this days ago. Do not take the bait. If Biden wants war with Russia,
[3:54:19.300 --> 3:54:26.580]  if Obama wants war with Russia, if Hillary wants war with Russia, if George Soros wants war with
[3:54:26.580 --> 3:54:34.100]  Russia, clearly it's the wrong thing to do. Clearly it's a bad move. Clearly they're brainwashing
[3:54:34.100 --> 3:54:41.940]  you. Clearly you're seeing bad images in the news. Clearly they never, those four never have
[3:54:41.940 --> 3:54:49.140]  America's best interests in mind. So stay away from anything these four communist traders want.
[3:54:49.140 --> 3:54:56.180]  Anything. This has nothing to do with saving the Ukrainian people. This is about saving Biden.
[3:54:56.180 --> 3:55:02.420]  This is my social media post today. Saving Biden from the worst poll numbers in modern history,
[3:55:02.420 --> 3:55:09.460]  distracting you from open borders and $7 a gallon gas, making you forget the lies they told you
[3:55:09.460 --> 3:55:15.540]  for the past two years that damaged your life and damaged your kids for the rest of their lives
[3:55:15.540 --> 3:55:22.100]  and ushering in the great reset to make us all your poor, broke, serfs and slaves dependent
[3:55:22.100 --> 3:55:28.340]  on government to survive. That's the game they're playing. They lied to you about the rigged
[3:55:28.340 --> 3:55:36.420]  election. They clearly stole it. They lied to you about COVID and the response to it. It was
[3:55:36.420 --> 3:55:41.140]  just awful. The lockdowns, the business closures, the school closures, the mask mandates, the vaccine
[3:55:41.140 --> 3:55:47.460]  mandates, the vaccine passports, all lies, the COVID tests, all false positives. My God,
[3:55:48.020 --> 3:55:52.820]  they just lied and lied and lied. And you took the bait. So many of us took the bait.
[3:55:52.820 --> 3:55:58.980]  So many conservatives I know are vaccinated. Since my wedding, since my wedding in November,
[3:55:58.980 --> 3:56:05.460]  10 people I know, all conservatives, all vaccinated, have either dropped dead or had
[3:56:05.460 --> 3:56:10.020]  massive open heart surgery and they're just barely hanging on or just barely recovering right now.
[3:56:10.580 --> 3:56:14.340]  10 people at one wedding. And that's just the people I know about.
[3:56:15.860 --> 3:56:19.620]  So they lied to you and they covered it up in the media by giving out a billion dollars
[3:56:19.620 --> 3:56:23.780]  and they make sure the media featured nobody like me to tell you the truth about the COVID
[3:56:23.780 --> 3:56:29.700]  vaccines. The Iran deal now is all about bribery, just like the Ukraine war is all about bribery.
[3:56:29.700 --> 3:56:35.300]  It's about how much money can they cut off of each deal? If we give a 10 billion dollars
[3:56:35.300 --> 3:56:40.660]  to Ukraine, Joe Biden is going to keep one billion. It's all incredible. All right. Look,
[3:56:40.660 --> 3:56:44.580]  my time is up in about a minute. I want to say goodbye to you all. I've got answers every day,
[3:56:44.580 --> 3:56:49.540]  three hours a day. Wayne Alleroute, Ron unfiltered on USA Radio Network. You can listen at USA

[3:57:01.060 --> 3:57:05.140]  Again, the website where it all begins root for America dot com and the book that I'm so proud
[3:57:05.140 --> 3:57:10.100]  of number one bestseller, the great patriot protest and boycott book. Thank you, Alex Jones for
[3:57:10.100 --> 3:57:14.580]  giving me the time on this show today. Always enjoyed being on your show. Nobody can fill
[3:57:14.580 --> 3:57:19.460]  your shoes, but I try my best. Alex, thanks for all you do. Wayne Alleroute, we got 30 seconds
[3:57:19.460 --> 3:57:25.780]  left to go. Have yourselves a great day. Fight, fight, fight and never, ever, ever give up or
[3:57:25.780 --> 3:57:30.980]  give in. Do I think the situation is good? No. Do I think it looks good for America? No. Do I
[3:57:30.980 --> 3:57:35.460]  think the odds are against us? Yes. Are we on the way down? It sure looks like it. But if you
[3:57:35.460 --> 3:57:40.260]  never give up and you keep fighting and you're relentless as Winston Churchill said, never,
[3:57:40.260 --> 3:57:50.180]  ever, ever give up, we can win this thing. Bye bye. I stay on air selling high quality products
[3:57:50.180 --> 3:57:54.900]  that you need, that you want and that you're going to be happy with. That's why you come back
[3:57:54.900 --> 3:58:00.420]  and buy products from me again. It's a symbiotic relationship. I promote liberty. I promote freedom.
[3:58:00.420 --> 3:58:05.140]  I fight the globalist and I'm able to do that because you buy products and at foreshore.com.
[3:58:05.140 --> 3:58:09.540]  And listen, all the products are great. But when it comes to high quality, storeable food
[3:58:09.540 --> 3:58:16.420]  in an inflationary system with major supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute 360 win,
[3:58:16.420 --> 3:58:20.900]  a no brainer. And they've got high quality, storeable food ready to ship to you right now.
[3:58:20.900 --> 3:58:26.420]  The great folks at my Patreon supply exclusively prepare with alex.com discounted. So again,
[3:58:26.420 --> 3:58:31.540]  beat inflation, be prepared, fund the info war. The only way you lose is not taking action

[3:58:37.860 --> 3:58:42.340]  This is how you beat inflation. Get yours today. It's ready to ship. But I wouldn't wait because
[3:58:42.340 --> 3:58:45.300]  prices are about to go up because inflation is exploding.
[3:58:48.980 --> 3:58:52.900]  Jacob in Ohio. Welcome. Go ahead. Hey, how's it going, Alex? Good, Alex.
[3:58:52.900 --> 3:58:57.780]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement. It's basically
[3:58:57.780 --> 3:59:02.980]  the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization and absurdity. It's
[3:59:02.980 --> 3:59:07.460]  like we're living in a twilight zone. All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling.
[3:59:07.460 --> 3:59:11.140]  Go ahead. Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out
[3:59:11.140 --> 3:59:15.940]  for one of the product. The X2 does wonders. They recommend it to everybody. You're on the fence
[3:59:15.940 --> 3:59:20.820]  about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the info war. Tyler in Maine. You're on
[3:59:20.820 --> 3:59:24.580]  the air. Thanks for holding it. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[3:59:24.580 --> 3:59:30.100]  Honor talk to you. Awesome. So first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products,
[3:59:30.100 --> 3:59:36.100]  alpha power, even at 29. If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps with the bedroom.
[3:59:36.100 --> 3:59:41.060]  So just number one for two. It definitely works. It's not a joke. Absolutely.
[3:59:41.060 --> 3:59:55.780]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
