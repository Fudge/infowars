[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:26.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:26.000 --> 00:31.000]  Well, for the next 20 minutes, Judge Andrew Napolitano joins us.
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  He, of course, from the last week has now moved from the weekends with the number one show in months.
[00:36.000 --> 00:44.000]  A lot of the gates was number one on Fox Business on the weekends to the regular Fox Business weeknights.
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.000]  And it's becoming very, very successful there as well.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  So from the weekends to weekdays, and hopefully very soon to the main Fox channel,
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  because he's a real libertarian at heart, and we always appreciate having Judge Andrew Napolitano,
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000]  JudgeNap.com, also bestselling author with us.
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.000]  Judge, this is a short segment, the long segment's coming up, but so much going on in the world today.
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  What's most important on your radar?
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.000]  I think the president wants to subjugate us, Alex.
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  I think the president who falsely claims that he believes in civil liberties,
[01:15.000 --> 01:23.000]  who took an oath to uphold the Constitution, and who could stop all of this with a phone call to cousin Janet,
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.000]  we're not related, but I kiddingly referred to her that way, John Napolitano,
[01:27.000 --> 01:35.000]  has placed armed and unarmed, uniformed agents between private carriers and their customers
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.000]  at the most critical juncture, barking orders, demanding conformity, threatening arrest and fines.
[01:41.000 --> 01:48.000]  I think this is the beginning of an effort of this president to use powers from some source other than the Constitution,
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  an argument his predecessors made to get us to conform to his will.
[01:52.000 --> 01:59.000]  I fear that this TSA stormtrooper behavior is the tip of an iceberg, or an ocean,
[01:59.000 --> 02:06.000]  that this administration, now that it has lost some of its strength in Congress, may want to use to overwhelm us.
[02:06.000 --> 02:13.000]  Well, we know, and you were critical of George Bush and the police state things he carried out,
[02:13.000 --> 02:19.000]  Obama's continued the torture, the wars, in some cases expanded some of the extraordinary rendition,
[02:19.000 --> 02:27.000]  the enhanced interrogations, but because he's got a leftist cover, the left is in a coma dealing with it,
[02:27.000 --> 02:35.000]  but now this TSA hands in pants, and we've got all of this happening.
[02:35.000 --> 02:43.000]  I mean, it really does show their lust to dominate us and to basically break those taboos, and you're right,
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  they've announced they want TSA scanners on the streets, they're already beta testing at train stations,
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  TSA's been searching people's bags without warrants for years in New York, so you're right.
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  I mean, this is something they want to roll out nationwide.
[02:55.000 --> 03:03.000]  You know, the most specific part of the Constitution, the one that provides the most details as to what the government may
[03:03.000 --> 03:09.000]  and may not do is the Fourth Amendment, which establishes the right to privacy, the right to be left alone,
[03:09.000 --> 03:16.000]  and it basically says the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses, papers, and effects,
[03:16.000 --> 03:22.000]  in their persons, meaning their bodies, and the Supreme Court has ruled in some cases with which you and I agree
[03:22.000 --> 03:28.000]  and in some with which you and I disagree, nevertheless, it has uniformly ruled that you own your body
[03:28.000 --> 03:35.000]  and the government cannot touch it or go near it or go inside of it without an order from a judge
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  after the judge has heard arguments from both sides and the government has proved its right to do so,
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.000]  because the Constitution presumes that we are innocent until proven guilty, yet the TSA,
[03:46.000 --> 03:52.000]  not by a law that Congress wrote, but by a regulation written by a couple of faceless bureaucrats,
[03:52.000 --> 03:58.000]  nameless until a few weeks ago, has turned that presumption of innocence upside down and treats everyone
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  as if they were entering a prison rather than getting onto a private airliner.
[04:02.000 --> 04:09.000]  Absolutely, and expanding on that, they are having federally funded checkpoints that violate the Fourth Amendment,
[04:09.000 --> 04:16.000]  federally funded blood draws at DWI checkpoints, no refusal, they're trying to push forced inoculations.
[04:16.000 --> 04:22.000]  This is clearly their attempt to set the precedent to get in our space and put their hands on our body,
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  and Ron Paul told me an hour and a half ago that they've grabbed his genitals.
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  I did not know that Ron was on with me last night.
[04:29.000 --> 04:35.000]  Ron made an argument which was purely Jeffersonian and its brilliance and its simplicity.
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.000]  Well, tell us about that when we come back, Judge, I want to hear that, but I want to go further.
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  I want to ask you as a judge, as a constitutional scholar, not just the Fourth Amendment,
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  am I wrong in saying this violates Ninth and Tenth?
[04:46.000 --> 04:52.000]  We've got a federal power grab that even sworn peace officers of the state can't stick their hands down your pants
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  without an emergency or an warrant.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  I mean, how are they doing this?
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.000]  We'll be right back with Judge Andrew Napolitano, JudgeNap.com.
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[05:03.000 --> 05:08.000]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy to fix and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.000]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.
[05:17.000 --> 05:24.000]  They have two holiday-priced packs for you to put into your reserves for a secure future or to share with others.
[05:24.000 --> 05:31.000]  The first is a six-month bulk supply in tin cans, and the second is a five-week supply of quick and easy to fix meals,
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  including delicious bakery items, shipped in heavy tote bags.
[05:35.000 --> 05:40.000]  Now, for a limited time, when you order two or more of these special holiday packs,
[05:40.000 --> 05:46.000]  you'll get free shipping on your entire order, haul now 800-409-5633
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  or visit them at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[05:50.000 --> 05:56.000]  That's 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[06:04.000 --> 06:09.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[06:09.000 --> 06:12.000]  Do you want answers? Well, so does he.
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[06:16.000 --> 06:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[06:22.000 --> 06:31.000]  Judging from Napolitano, his show's now moved from Fox Business Weekends, number one, to Fox Business Weeknights.
[06:31.000 --> 06:35.000]  You can find out more on his website.
[06:35.000 --> 06:40.000]  We're going to have Jerome Corsi on tonight. We'll find out what's coming up on his show tonight.
[06:40.000 --> 06:45.000]  I love seeing Fox promote somebody like Napolitano, because he tells the truth.
[06:45.000 --> 06:49.000]  He's a constitutionalist. He was against Bush when he was pushing tyranny.
[06:49.000 --> 06:53.000]  He's against Obama when he's pushing tyranny. He talks about the New World Order.
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  If you've just joined us, we were discussing the TSA in the last segment.
[06:56.000 --> 07:02.000]  You were getting into Ron Paul, who you interviewed last night, and his Jeffersonian argument against the TSA.
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.000]  Well, Ron Paul made the same argument that Jefferson did, which is interestingly,
[07:06.000 --> 07:13.000]  the same argument that the now iconic heroic young man from San Diego made at the San Diego Airport two weeks ago,
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  when he said, don't touch my junk, referring to his private parts.
[07:17.000 --> 07:24.000]  If I can't do it to you, then I can't give the government the power to do it to you.
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  If you take a swing at me, I can take a swing back.
[07:28.000 --> 07:33.000]  But I can't invite you onto my property and presume the right to touch your private parts
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  as a condition of your coming onto the property.
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.000]  Stated differently, the only powers the government has are the powers we give it.
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  And the only powers we give it are the powers that we have to give it.
[07:45.000 --> 07:53.000]  We don't have the power to touch someone else in their private parts against their will, no matter what they're doing.
[07:53.000 --> 07:59.000]  This is a sexual assault, whether it's done by the gardener, by a school teacher, by a member of the clergy,
[07:59.000 --> 08:02.000]  or by somebody wearing a government uniform.
[08:02.000 --> 08:09.000]  Congressman Paul not only articulated that so nicely on my show, he introduced a piece of legislation that's ten lines long,
[08:09.000 --> 08:13.000]  which would stop this in a heartbeat, but it will never see the heart of day.
[08:13.000 --> 08:22.000]  Why do you think Speaker-designate John Boehner, who flies commercial from Cincinnati to Washington
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000]  several days a week, was permitted to walk around the scanners and around the Gropers?
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  Is it because they recognize him? Well, of course they recognize him.
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  It's because they want him on their side.
[08:33.000 --> 08:36.000]  You group a member of Congress, he's going to vote against us.
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.000]  You let him walk around the Gropers, he's going to say, ah, go ahead, keep us safe.
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  So this is true discrimination at its heart.
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  But what about my point that this violates the Ninth and Tenth Amendment?
[08:48.000 --> 08:50.000]  I guess that goes to the Jeffersonians going.
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.000]  The Ninth Amendment says that the powers not given to the federal government are retained by the states and the people,
[08:55.000 --> 09:01.000]  and we never gave the Constitution nowhere gave the federal government the power to keep us safe.
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.000]  That is the obligation of the individuals and of the states.
[09:04.000 --> 09:11.000]  And the Ninth Amendment says, just because we have enumerated certain rights in this Constitution,
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  it doesn't mean that there are other natural rights that the people don't have.
[09:15.000 --> 09:22.000]  Stated differently, your right to bodily integrity. You have it whether it's mentioned in the Constitution or not.
[09:22.000 --> 09:23.000]  It's a natural right.
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  So Judge, what is this attempt then? What do you think is behind this?
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.000]  They know brazenly ordering them to put their hands down the pants now
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  and to record our naked images of our body, which they've been caught doing.
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.000]  They know this is 180 degrees polar opposite of a Liberty culture.
[09:39.000 --> 09:45.000]  It's a tyranny culture. So is this the furor precept that Bush tried where they said, well,
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.000]  it's not illegal when the president does it, you know, tortures illegal,
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  but it's not illegal if the president orders it.
[09:51.000 --> 09:56.000]  Is this just more of this control freak religion of pushing it to the limit?
[09:56.000 --> 10:03.000]  It's more of a control freak progressive with an uppercase T religion that the government can do whatever it wants.
[10:03.000 --> 10:06.000]  Look, this morning there were two polls, very dismay.
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  One said two-thirds of the American public doesn't object to the porn or the group.
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  Well, most of the public doesn't fly every day and they haven't exposed to this.
[10:15.000 --> 10:22.000]  But the more terrifying one is that 53% of Americans think the government is operating outside the Constitution.
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  And aren't doing anything about it. If the government is operating outside the Constitution,
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000]  it's time to change the government. I mean, that's about as reckless a thing as you can be.
[10:32.000 --> 10:38.000]  The Constitution equals the rule of law. If the government is not obeying the rule of law, how can it impose laws upon us?
[10:38.000 --> 10:46.000]  The problem with the Boehner exception to the TSA, should it make an exception from Madonna or Derek Gier or somebody else that's well-known,
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  is that these bureaucrats are making up rules on the spot and then making exceptions to the rules on the spot.
[10:51.000 --> 10:59.000]  That is a power that is not theirs to have. Only the commerce can make law and it can only do it after a legitimate debate and a vote by the peoples represented.
[10:59.000 --> 11:04.000]  So it's judge, jury, and executioner. I think the establishment is going to lose this fight.
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  I mean, I really see this becoming a focal point of peoples' anger in general.
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  You know, I agree with you, Alex, and I've seen some people that I'm surprised to see on our side.
[11:15.000 --> 11:22.000]  Former Senator Rick Santorum, who almost always sided with big government, sounded like Alex Jones this morning.
[11:22.000 --> 11:30.000]  Peter King, Republican Congressman from Long Island, who always sides with security, said the TSA has become the enemy of the American people.
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.000]  Congressman John Micah, who wrote the TSA legislation, says, we have to change this immediately.
[11:35.000 --> 11:44.000]  I think this is starting to sink in across the board. It knows no ideological, no ethnic, no gender line.
[11:44.000 --> 11:52.000]  I think the American public is saying enough is enough. But one person isn't listening and he could stop this with a phone call.
[11:52.000 --> 12:03.000]  And that's the president who wants to induce us to conform to his way of behaving and thinking, just like his predecessor.
[12:03.000 --> 12:16.000]  That's Barack H. Obama, and they do want to back off now because they understand if they continue the fight, it's only going to have the American people come together, and that's what they're threatened by.
[12:16.000 --> 12:31.000]  Speaking of Ron Paul, Judge, I had him on during the first hour, and I went over the Washington Post headline where they talk about, you know, using a war to fix the economy of the David Broder article.
[12:31.000 --> 12:49.000]  I went over the Rand Corporation two years ago, our article at prisonplanet.com, talking about how they need a larger war so that the dollar stays strong and so that countries basically go along with the formation of this corporate world government.
[12:49.000 --> 13:03.000]  And Ron Paul agreed with me. He said that certainly we have to look at the military industrial complex staging this provocation, not that North Korea is good. They're probably the most evil country on Earth, this hereditary dictatorship.
[13:03.000 --> 13:15.000]  But going into their waters, engaging in a naval exercise, firing artillery near their shore, when the North had warned them, that's clearly a provocation. What's your take on this?
[13:15.000 --> 13:28.000]  My take on it is that the president, that all presidents love war, except if Ron Paul became president, because they know that war is the health of the state, that people will pay more taxes, give up their liberty and unite behind the soldiers no matter what the outcome.
[13:28.000 --> 13:39.000]  They falsely believe that war will help the economy. It's beyond me how taxing people to purchase equipment and then destroying the equipment helps the economy.
[13:39.000 --> 13:49.000]  But this is a myth that has been perpetrated since Woodrow Wilson, reinforced by FDR, used by George W. Bush, and we're about to see if Barack Obama can use it.
[13:49.000 --> 14:02.000]  Fortunately, this is not in our backyard. It is 10,000 miles away, and there are voices in both parties on both sides of the aisle are saying, no, no, no, no, we're not going to do this again. Ron Paul is leading the charge.
[14:02.000 --> 14:12.000]  All right, judge, I've got a few other final questions for you and then tell us about what's coming up tonight on the TV show. Glenn Beck, who I've been critical of on many fronts because he's flip-flopped over the years.
[14:12.000 --> 14:21.000]  You have it. That's why I support you and your libertarian views. We're very close to each other. But I'm not trying to attack Glenn. He's given you a big platform to really tell the truth.
[14:21.000 --> 14:32.000]  But two weeks ago, as you know, he came out, he read the quotes by Obama and Clinton officials saying how great a terror attack would be, how it would help them.
[14:32.000 --> 14:39.000]  He read the newsletters where they're demonizing Glenn and myself saying we're going to cause an Oklahoma City attack.
[14:39.000 --> 14:49.000]  And he went ahead and said these people, this is a quote, are planning another Oklahoma City to be blamed on the Liberty Movement.
[14:49.000 --> 14:55.000]  That's a big bold shift for Glenn Beck. What's your take on him coming out and talking about false flag terror?
[14:55.000 --> 15:03.000]  Well, I'm a close friend of Glenn's. Obviously, I don't have any control over what he says on this show, but I appear with him a lot.
[15:03.000 --> 15:10.000]  I fill in for him on television when he's not here. And I share a lot of his views.
[15:10.000 --> 15:24.000]  I don't know anything about what he just said, but I do believe that this government would welcome the type of conflagration that we have seen in the past if it would help it become more authoritarian,
[15:24.000 --> 15:31.000]  particularly now with the loss of the House and with a filibuster positive number that the Republicans have.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  And I carry no water for them, as you know, in the Senate.
[15:34.000 --> 15:41.000]  The president is going to have to rule by decree. And the easiest way for him to rule by decree is to accompany his decree with fear.
[15:41.000 --> 15:46.000]  And the easiest way to get that fear is to look the other way if somebody assaults us.
[15:46.000 --> 16:09.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[16:09.000 --> 16:14.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[16:14.000 --> 16:20.000]  I've turned an innocent influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[16:20.000 --> 16:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[16:25.000 --> 16:28.000]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[16:28.000 --> 16:35.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[16:35.000 --> 16:39.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches.
[16:39.000 --> 16:42.000]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  The day seems like nobody does care.
[16:44.000 --> 16:49.000]  And right now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[16:49.000 --> 16:54.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[16:54.000 --> 17:00.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.000]  You've heard me talk about Calden five-star subs for years.
[17:05.000 --> 17:11.000]  This is an American-made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[17:11.000 --> 17:14.000]  By factory direct shipped via UPS right to your door.
[17:14.000 --> 17:20.000]  Check them out on the web at fivestarsope.com or call 800-340-7091.
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  Take my word for it.

[20:01.000 --> 20:05.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[20:05.000 --> 20:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:11.000 --> 20:18.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[20:18.000 --> 20:24.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:24.000 --> 20:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I couldn't think of a better time to have Congressman Ron Paul on with us.
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  He's only with us about 20 minutes.
[20:40.000 --> 20:46.000]  I want to get into the Korea situation, the TSA, the quantitative easing to the monetization of debt.
[20:46.000 --> 20:52.000]  I want to get into Rand Paul winning and what that signifies, the fact that Ron Paul and Rand Paul have announced
[20:52.000 --> 20:58.000]  that they're not going to be joining the Tea Party Caucus because some of the leaders of it are people that voted for the bailout.
[20:58.000 --> 21:01.000]  We're going to be discussing all that. Congressman, thank you for joining us.
[21:01.000 --> 21:02.000]  Good to be with you again.
[21:02.000 --> 21:07.000]  Of that constellation of things I threw out, what do you think is most important right now?
[21:07.000 --> 21:14.000]  Well, the cause of liberty. That's always my number one goal and that is related to the deficit
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.000]  because the bigger the government, the more the government spends, the less liberty we have
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  and that involves what we do overseas as well as what we do here.
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  So it's been the same old story and of course that's closely related to our financial system and our Federal Reserve
[21:28.000 --> 21:33.000]  because it would have been brought to a halt if they couldn't have been counterfeiting the money.
[21:33.000 --> 21:40.000]  You know, I'm seeing Wall Street Journal, New York Times headlines every week now saying Ron Paul was right
[21:40.000 --> 21:49.000]  pointing out that everything you talked about in those debates and got laughed at by a minority of fools has now come true.
[21:49.000 --> 21:55.000]  What's your view on quantitative easing? Are you going to get the Banking Committee chairmanship?
[21:55.000 --> 21:59.000]  Where are you going in your interrogation of the Federal Reserve?
[21:59.000 --> 22:05.000]  Well, I'm assuming I'm going to get the chairmanship but, you know, until it's done you can't be absolutely positive
[22:05.000 --> 22:12.000]  but I'm working on the assumption that we will and I think most everybody will know where I stand on the Federal Reserve
[22:12.000 --> 22:17.000]  although my position is to abolish the Fed and I read a book called In the Fed.
[22:17.000 --> 22:25.000]  I also take a stand that, you know, even if I could, I wouldn't close the Federal Reserve in one day.
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  I think they're going to close itself when they have a runaway inflation that destroyed a dollar and that's what's so dangerous
[22:30.000 --> 22:38.000]  but I would still argue the case for legalizing the Constitution and competition and allowing gold and silver to be legal tender.
[22:38.000 --> 22:45.000]  So everything they do is incorrect because they're managing the money supply and they're managing interest rates
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  and that's where the source of the problem is.
[22:47.000 --> 22:54.000]  And just recently some Republicans have come out and they say, you know what we need to do is take away some of the responsibility of the Fed
[22:54.000 --> 23:04.000]  because since 1978 they were supposed to deal with unemployment which, you know, it's true that that was a silly thing to do
[23:04.000 --> 23:10.000]  and they give us our other ones who give us the unemployment, they can't produce employment
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  but, you know, but removing that is almost irrelevant.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  It's the fact that they exist and manipulate interest rates and not mess around with the supply
[23:19.000 --> 23:26.000]  and some money supply and they're supposed to give us stable prices. Whether or not they have that additional mandate
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.000]  is missing the whole point. It's almost a distraction.
[23:29.000 --> 23:39.000]  Absolutely. I'm sure you noticed two weeks ago when the Chinese government said they want transparency on the Fed
[23:39.000 --> 23:47.000]  and basically called for an audit. We now have foreign governments and the biggest owner of our debt calling for some transparency of this group.
[23:47.000 --> 23:55.000]  Yeah, you know, sometimes when our Congress wants to tell other countries what to do, I object because we ought to mind our own business
[23:55.000 --> 24:00.000]  but, you know, if you've invested a trillion dollars or nearly a trillion dollars in our dollar
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.000]  they've almost earned the right to say something about our management of our dollar
[24:04.000 --> 24:09.000]  but the hypocrisy is for us to lecture China because we think their currency is too weak
[24:09.000 --> 24:13.000]  and that's all we do is work on weakening our currency.
[24:13.000 --> 24:21.000]  So it's going to, you know, come to a boil. I don't think it's good. I don't think it's good for the world.
[24:21.000 --> 24:27.000]  I don't think it's good for our economy and it's going to lead to a lot more trouble mainly
[24:27.000 --> 24:32.000]  because everybody has a fiat currency and everybody's trying to manage to maneuver somebody else
[24:32.000 --> 24:37.000]  and they just don't believe in sound money and they don't believe in free markets.
[24:37.000 --> 24:43.000]  Congressman, is this next session of Congress the new session starting next year with the Republican majority?
[24:43.000 --> 24:50.000]  Do you think in your gut this is going to be the Congress working with your son in the Senate
[24:50.000 --> 24:57.000]  that is finally going to get a real audit of the second largest holder of our debt, the private Federal Reserve?
[24:57.000 --> 25:03.000]  I think it's going to still be an issue. I think the auditing event will come up again.
[25:03.000 --> 25:10.000]  There'll be some more votes. We will get bits and pieces of information that we haven't had before,
[25:10.000 --> 25:17.000]  but a real audit, no, I'm not expecting it, but that doesn't diminish my desire to pursue the issue
[25:17.000 --> 25:22.000]  because, you know, even if we did finally get the votes in the Senate and came out in the bill,
[25:22.000 --> 25:28.000]  a president would probably veto it and if he didn't veto it, the Fed is going to stonewall us
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  and they'll go to the courts and they'll get a favorable ruling on the courts that they don't have to do it.
[25:33.000 --> 25:41.000]  So it would go on and on. So it's more likely we're going to find out about the Fed when they self-destruct
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  where they really just ruin the system and they no longer function and become irrelevant
[25:45.000 --> 25:51.000]  and people will be forced to use some sound money that is a use of gold and silver coins.
[25:51.000 --> 25:58.000]  I remember three years ago, two years ago, a year ago, you basically would precision as a medical doctor,
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  as a congressman, as someone who studies economics and has won awards in that area,
[26:02.000 --> 26:13.000]  that as time went on you saw the self-destruction of this system through dollar devaluation coming.
[26:13.000 --> 26:19.000]  Obviously we're getting closer to that. What type of timeframe do you see, Congressman?
[26:19.000 --> 26:25.000]  Well, that's what's not possible to predict and everybody wants to know, investors need to know
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.000]  or they need to make estimates. I work on the assumption that it could come anytime
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  because there's no foundation to our system, no foundation to our money,
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.000]  no support for the currency other than the promises of our politicians and the Federal Reserve
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000]  and people are losing confidence in those entities constantly.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  But I think they tend to pull stuff out of the fire more than we ever dreamed.
[26:49.000 --> 26:55.000]  It doesn't deserve to exist and they've really messed it up and we have these tremendous deficits.
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.000]  I still think they could keep this thing going, you know, three, four, maybe even five years.
[27:00.000 --> 27:03.000]  But to say that, oh, okay, it's going to be safe.
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.000]  So if you see interest rates go up, why don't you go back into buying long-term bonds
[27:08.000 --> 27:15.000]  because, you know, in 10 or 15 years there will be no problems and you can have confidence in what they're doing.
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  I think it's way too early to expect that.
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.000]  Well, is it accurate to say this is a debt black hole and we're seeing this now in Ireland,
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.000]  not just in Greece and Portugal and Spain, and that the bigger the bailouts,
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.000]  the more it just accelerates, you know, the final implosion?
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  Yeah, and everything is based on the dollar.
[27:34.000 --> 27:41.000]  You know, we're in all this trouble yet they can't bail out these countries or states like California.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  Everybody gets bailed out, but the base is the dollar.
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.000]  The dollar is the reserve and we're still getting away with it.
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  We're still printing the money and they're taking as much as China complains.
[27:52.000 --> 27:59.000]  They still, you know, buy some of our treasury debts that they use to, but they have so much and they don't want to crash it.
[27:59.000 --> 28:05.000]  But there's going to be a limit and the markets are more powerful than the governments and the central banks.
[28:05.000 --> 28:15.000]  I keep thinking back because I watched it so closely in the 70s and the 60s because they kept pretending that gold was as good as gold
[28:15.000 --> 28:21.000]  and it was at $35 an ounce, but finally the market overwhelmed no matter how many lies they told.
[28:21.000 --> 28:28.000]  People lost confidence in it and they had to quit the game because it wasn't people called them on it and they wanted their gold.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  So eventually that's going to happen again.
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[29:04.000 --> 29:10.000]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy to fix and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.

[31:35.000 --> 31:47.000]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business? I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[31:59.000 --> 32:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[32:04.000 --> 32:08.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[32:08.000 --> 32:14.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[32:14.000 --> 32:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[32:20.000 --> 32:24.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[32:24.000 --> 32:28.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[32:28.000 --> 32:35.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[32:35.000 --> 32:40.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[32:40.000 --> 32:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[32:45.000 --> 32:51.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[32:51.000 --> 32:59.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[33:01.000 --> 33:09.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:09.000 --> 33:27.000]  I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto Line. The desert is my brother. My skin is red.
[33:27.000 --> 33:33.000]  Now, racing through some of what's happening, we see the dollar back up today because of this Korea situation.
[33:33.000 --> 33:38.000]  Obviously, North Korea is a horrible hereditary dictatorship under Kim Jong-il
[33:38.000 --> 33:45.000]  and now Kim Jong-un, his secretive son. But now North Korea admits in Reuters they were doing drills
[33:45.000 --> 33:52.000]  and firing artillery into a questionable area that North Korea claims.
[33:52.000 --> 33:58.000]  Now North Korea has bombarded an island in the south, killing and maiming quite a few people.
[33:58.000 --> 34:01.000]  The South Korean president says they're preparing to strike the north.
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  The north is talking about annihilating the south.
[34:03.000 --> 34:09.000]  And then I have this Rand Corporation report, Rand Lobby's Pentagon for start of war to save U.S. economy.
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.000]  I think back to NATO, stirring stuff up with Russia on 888.
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.000]  I have the Obama advisor telling the Financial Times of London, bottom line here is
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.000]  Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership, Robert Shapiro said.
[34:23.000 --> 34:29.000]  He has to find some way between now and demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence.
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.000]  And in short of a new 9-11 or Oklahoma City, I can't think of how he can do that.
[34:33.000 --> 34:38.000]  We also have neocon leaders telling Obama to attack Iran or start a war.
[34:38.000 --> 34:44.000]  So we see a lot of hype out there to start some type of war or start one up to boost the dollar
[34:44.000 --> 34:49.000]  and keep this Ponzi scheme going. Your geopolitical take on that, Congressman.
[34:49.000 --> 34:56.000]  Yeah, it really is frightening when you hear people in our administration or outside the administration
[34:56.000 --> 35:03.000]  literally advocating war as a way to get out of an economic crisis, which is just insane talk.
[35:03.000 --> 35:11.000]  And the whole idea that we're on the verge of a serious attack by North Korea or South Korea or anybody else,
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.000]  they seem to be a little kooky for even implying that.
[35:15.000 --> 35:21.000]  But you wonder how they get motivated to do that because it's worse than a third world nation.
[35:21.000 --> 35:27.000]  You know, they have weapons, that's all they have, but they don't have any wealth. They can't feed their people.
[35:27.000 --> 35:33.000]  And they have no more ability to take over South Korea than a man on the moon.
[35:33.000 --> 35:39.000]  I just wish we weren't over there. And if it is a problem, which it may well be, let South Korea take care of it.
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.000]  Let China take care of it. They're close by. They probably don't want another war over there.
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  Japan has interests involved, but we don't.
[35:46.000 --> 35:53.000]  And we need to stay the devil out of there unless they're doing it deliberately and then sort of orchestrating this
[35:53.000 --> 36:00.000]  in order to have the military industrial complex, you know, benefit and the dollar temporarily benefit.
[36:00.000 --> 36:09.000]  But, you know, how could the borders over there be anything compared to the borders between Texas and Mexico?
[36:09.000 --> 36:14.000]  I mean, how many people died on our borders in the last year? Thousands.
[36:14.000 --> 36:19.000]  28,000 in the last two and a half years total. And that's kind of out of sight, out of mind.
[36:19.000 --> 36:25.000]  But you have a better chance, doctors, you know, of dying from a bee sting than being killed by terrorists.
[36:25.000 --> 36:34.000]  Moving to the next subject, this radio show a month ago launched the exposure of the TSA with the new enhanced patdown,
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  kind of like enhanced interrogation is torture. This is molestation.
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  Now they admit they're sticking their hands in people's pants.
[36:40.000 --> 36:47.000]  Pistol tried to deny it yesterday when he was on ABC, but they reported that ABC reporters are having them stick their hands down their pants.
[36:47.000 --> 36:53.000]  I have witnessed men touching babies' crotches. So this is now confirmed.
[36:53.000 --> 37:01.000]  And I believe this is a catalyst for the eruption of the anger that the American people already have.
[37:01.000 --> 37:08.000]  Doesn't this violate the Tent Amendment? What are minimum wage federal employees doing, groping everybody?
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  I mean, how did we go this far?
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.000]  You know, it's hard to figure out who would have ever believed this.
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  And the other day when I introduced my legislation to deal with this, I said, you know,
[37:18.000 --> 37:23.000]  I worry about the foreign policy spending, the Federal Reserve, our debt, the whole mess, which are huge.
[37:23.000 --> 37:30.000]  But this one addresses something else. This one is just such an affront.
[37:30.000 --> 37:39.000]  There's so much out in the open in government being so bold as to molest in public and say they're doing it for our interest.
[37:39.000 --> 37:43.000]  If we tolerate this, there's something wrong with us. I mean, something wrong with us.
[37:43.000 --> 37:48.000]  It's almost like it's probably not fair to say this because so many people don't deserve it.
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.000]  We deserve, you know, some of this stuff if we don't do something about it.
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.000]  And hopefully the American people will do something.
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.000]  They'll eventually have to boycott the airlines or whatever or throw the more the bums out.
[38:01.000 --> 38:08.000]  Maybe the Congress will get off their doff and do something in January and insist that we rein in the TSA.
[38:08.000 --> 38:16.000]  Congressman, you know, a month ago, just with my own common sense, I said this new enhanced pat-down is meant to harass people
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.000]  into accepting the naked body scanners that churned off at others or openly making money out of.
[38:20.000 --> 38:27.000]  Now, Atlantic Monthly has talked to the TSA. They admitted that, yes, we want to intimidate people.
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.000]  So this is an act of harassment or sexual terrorism, in my view.
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.000]  And they admitted, shouldn't there be congressional hearings about this?
[38:36.000 --> 38:42.000]  I mean, you know, the method to the madness if government can set the precedent to put its hands down your pants
[38:42.000 --> 38:52.000]  or remove a urology or colostomy bag, and they are doing this, that's confirmed, or to strip down five-year-olds in full view.
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.000]  It reminds me of the Nazis. They started out with papers, please, in 1933.
[38:56.000 --> 39:01.000]  By 40, it was stripping women down with babies and running them into pits and shooting them in the back of the head.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  We have the film footage of that.
[39:03.000 --> 39:10.000]  I mean, this is clearly to dominate us and to break our will, but I think they've gone one step too far.
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  I think they've triggered the sleeping giants.
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  Yeah, I hope so. It seems that way.
[39:16.000 --> 39:23.000]  Showing our papers, we've capitulated on that a long time because we show our social security number and our driver's license
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.000]  and the whole work to know better what we do, get a job, or buy something.
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  They usually want those numbers.
[39:28.000 --> 39:34.000]  But now they want the government to show them our genitalia, and they want to take pictures of us
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.000]  and put their hands into our pants and all that.
[39:37.000 --> 39:42.000]  So that's hopefully enough to wake the people up.
[39:42.000 --> 39:48.000]  And what I think is great, you know, we complain a lot about the mainstream media, and they haven't been very friendly to us.
[39:48.000 --> 39:54.000]  But there's been a lot of good pictures on all the TV stations, you know, because it's been so abusive.
[39:54.000 --> 40:00.000]  So even though a fraction of the American people fly frequently,
[40:00.000 --> 40:08.000]  I'm sure almost all Americans now have seen some of these pictures saying to themselves, hey, what's going on here?
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  I mean, why are they doing this?
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.000]  So I think it's a healthy wake-up call to a lot of Americans.
[40:14.000 --> 40:20.000]  I just hope they can work that in to the whole concept of what's been going on with our country for a long time.
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.000]  Government is too big and intrusive and abused our rights, and they do the things they shouldn't be doing,
[40:25.000 --> 40:28.000]  and they forget about the things they were instructed to do.
[40:28.000 --> 40:35.000]  Congressman, again, I noticed three weeks ago that this could be the catalyst for the American people to finally stand up and realize the power we have.
[40:35.000 --> 40:42.000]  Now mainstream media is admitting that this is something almost like the Tea Party that you were the catalyst for back in 0708.
[40:42.000 --> 40:50.000]  I really see this trending towards a changing point on the graph going back towards liberty.
[40:50.000 --> 40:51.000]  Do you agree?
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.000]  Yeah, I think so, and they'll always be trying to minimize it and dilute it.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  So maybe they'll see this as an opportunity.
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.000]  They have to back off, and they might contract some of this work out.
[41:02.000 --> 41:07.000]  But they contract it out to their favorite corporations, and they're doing the same thing.
[41:07.000 --> 41:13.000]  We have to be careful that they're not exempt from the same abuse that we're complaining about.
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  That was my next question.
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  Have you ever suffered at the hands of the TSA?
[41:18.000 --> 41:25.000]  I have to go through that all the time because I have metal in my knees, and I don't go through.
[41:25.000 --> 41:30.000]  Basically, the X-ray is not available, and I hate the idea of doing that.
[41:30.000 --> 41:33.000]  So I get proud of it all the time, and it's disgusting.
[41:33.000 --> 41:34.000]  And I tell them so.
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  This is disgusting.
[41:36.000 --> 41:37.000]  How can you do it?
[41:37.000 --> 41:38.000]  And why am I putting it up?
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  Well, it is.
[41:39.000 --> 41:50.000]  It's so disgusting that I just don't understand, and that's why I am determined to do my very best to wake up the people about what's happening.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  Well, Doctor, we've only got about two minutes left.
[41:52.000 --> 42:01.000]  A medical doctor, as permission is trained, doesn't respectfully, when you go get an exam, you're a gynecologist, and delivered so many babies,
[42:01.000 --> 42:08.000]  but now some minimum wage person is pulling off urology bags, is sticking their hands in people's pants.
[42:08.000 --> 42:15.000]  Jesse Ventura, the former governor, said here last Friday that he's going to boycott it, and he believes with enough people don't fly.
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  That will force industry to put pressure on government.
[42:19.000 --> 42:23.000]  I mean, specifically, have you had them, have you had the enhanced pat down yet, sir?
[42:23.000 --> 42:24.000]  Have they touched your crotch?
[42:24.000 --> 42:25.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  And it's, like I said, absolutely disgusting.
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  And, you know, they've already proven the point.
[42:30.000 --> 42:37.000]  You know, my argument is that the airlines, the owners of the airlines are responsible, which should be continental and united.
[42:37.000 --> 43:01.000]  Other people, and we should decide whether we want to contract with them.
[43:01.000 --> 43:06.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[43:06.000 --> 43:09.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[43:09.000 --> 43:14.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[43:14.000 --> 43:20.000]  I've turned a memories influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[43:20.000 --> 43:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[43:25.000 --> 43:35.000]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes, constructing world government.
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches.
[43:39.000 --> 43:42.000]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[43:44.000 --> 43:49.000]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[59:49.000 --> 59:51.000]  Thank you.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  Thank you.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  Thank you.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  Okay.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  Before I get into that, I just want to make a clarification.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  When do I think they're going to attack Iran?
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  When I said this year, I didn't mean 2010.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  I mean in the next 12 months.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  Yes.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  Because this year is almost through.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  Going back to this general scenario, remember that Russia is running this show.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  China is going to be tagging along as the ally to back up Russia in its nuclear attack on the West.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  China wants to play the role as not the primary attack and because it wants to position itself to be the Cold War opposer of the West after it becomes the ally of the West during the war.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  It's like Russia.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  Russia comes in and helps the West beat Germany and then becomes the new Cold War enemy and gets all these concessions from the United States in the process.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  That's what China is setting itself up to.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  China will be careful not to appear to be too much of the enemy even though they will take, I think, when this war starts, the Pacific in order to guard the rear of Russia.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  And then from that position they'll attack Russia sometime during the war so that the West can't win the war against Russia.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  Then it will be the West versus China.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  That's the big picture.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  Now, in doing so, I don't think that China will do ravaging attacks on Japan, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  I think they'll occupy or encircle to keep them contained but will not do a lot of damage so that when they switch sides they won't be viewed too much because of the enemy.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  Now, in terms of timing, we have to watch Russia because Russia is the one that's calling the shots here.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  Right now, the West is in the middle of giving everything away to the Russians.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  In NATO, for example, doing a joint military missile defense with Russia, Russia says, we'll cover your east and you take up the missile defense in Western Europe itself.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  What they're doing, and this is very, very interesting, they're saying, we'll put our own missile defenses in here to guard against Islamic, you know, road missile attacks.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  But they're taking the prime position to be able to use anti-blistic missiles or to keep Western anti-blistic missiles from shooting down their own missiles in their boost phase by taking the near east position.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  I don't know if I'm being clear what I'm saying here.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  But it's very, very important for the West to understand that the French who are now driving the agenda in NATO are completely selling out to the Russians.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  Why, just for natural gas or?
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  No, no, it seems to be part of the globalist agenda.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  Sure, of course.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  The natural gas is being driven by the...
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  Well, the EU has been called by Lord Monk to many others properly, the new Soviet.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  That's right, it is a new Soviet and they're basically, it's really a control of who's going to run this new world war.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  The Russians want to run it, the Anglo-Americans know that they intend to run it and they have to eliminate Russia in the process.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  But they're in the process of luring Russia in and getting it to be confident enough to attack the West.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  That's been the West problem all these years is trying to get Russia over.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  That's why the disarmament, that's why taking out our Mx missile, even when they were nicked on theirs.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  You know, Joel, this is too important, I promise to go to calls, but can you come back on the other side of the quick break and for three minutes put bookends on this and explain in basics the factions you see, how you see it playing out.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  This is so important, can you come back for three more minutes?
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Yeah, I will.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  Okay, we will.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  I promise folks, 800-25 at 9, 9231, we're going right to your calls.

[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  Wow, I tell you, I've always been a supporter, a fan, a representative who's on with us right now.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  But I had no idea that there in Knoxville, Tennessee, he is a listener to the show, representative John Duncan.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  And of course he's made headlines across the country in the last few weeks criticizing the TSA and their activities.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  Here's the headline, Duncan Blast TSA Pat Downs Body Scans in Floor Speech.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  And then I was just talking to him during the break and he heard Ron Paul and Judge Andrew Napolitano on the show yesterday.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  So he'll be with us for about 25 minutes, but hopefully the first of many visits.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  So we'll give a shout out to WBCR 1470 that we've been on for about a decade there in the Knoxville area.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  And I would also add on the New American Magazine true patriot index, he has the second highest in the country.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  He has a 99 score. Ron Paul has a 100.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  So we're very, very excited to have representative Congressman John Duncan on with us. Congressman, great to have you.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  Well, Alex, thank you very much. It's a real honor to be on with you and I always have appreciated the work you've done in trying to fight against the New World Order
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  and big government. You know, big government helps only the elitists and the very, very wealthy.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  And you fight for the people that I, well, I hate to say the little guy, but you know what I mean.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  I appreciate the work that you do.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  Well, we appreciate you. How long have you been tuning in to the show on WBCR?
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  Well, for many years. I know Harry Groth John real well. I've been on with him many times and I've been on with, he has the power hour.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  I've been on with Joyce Riley a couple of times and I've listened to your show. I try never to miss a vote.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  But as soon as we have the last vote of the week, I catch the first plane home and I actually end up spending just a little bit more time here
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  in the district in Tennessee than I do in Washington and so I do listen to several of the other stations.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  I don't want to make any of my other friends mad on the other stations, but I listen to WBCR regularly
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  and I really have enjoyed your program for many years, probably ever since you've been on here.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  So God bless you, sir, small world. This TSA situation is really becoming a focal point, not just against the abuse and humiliation,
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  but overall a focal point for people's anger. Give us your view on that statement and the fact that every day we learn more,
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  now they stick the hands in the pants, now they're removing people's urology bags, colostomy bags, women's artificial breasts from mastectomies.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  I mean, this is a federal power grab on so many fronts, Congressman. Tell us why you have powerfully spoken out against it.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  I mean, I know that you're on some of the most important committees. You were previously the House Aviation Subcommittee
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  and top Republican on the House Subcommittee. You'll probably be getting back in as the chairman.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  I mean, you're a leading expert in this area. Give us your view on it.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  Well, I did chair the Aviation Subcommittee for six years, a few years ago when Republicans had control of the Congress,
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  and we have a rule on our side that you can only chair a committee or subcommittee for six years,
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  but I have been on the Aviation Subcommittee ever since I've been in Congress, and that's now 22 years.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  And so it's something I'm very much interested in. I will continue to serve on that subcommittee, although I won't be a chairman.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  I'll be chairman in the next Congress of the Highways and Transit subcommittee.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  But I think this body scanner business and these pat-downs, I think it's totally ridiculous. I think it's excessive.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  And I've tried to tell people that if we spend 100% of the federal budget on security, we could not make the country totally, completely, 100% safe.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  So we need to have a little balance and common sense, and I think we need to come to our senses on this.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  I think it's far more about money than it is about security, although I do realize that even though there's a nationwide revolt against this
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  and we're really upset about it as they should be, I do realize that there probably are half the people who will go along with anything as long as it has the word security attached to it.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  But I think the TSA has gone too far, and I've spoken out on the floor about this.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  And of course, another thing I've been concerned about, almost all these federal contracts are sweetheart insider-type deals, and I don't like that either.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  I think that's present here too.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  Well, Chertoff, as you spoke on the floor, Benjamin Chertoff, former head of Homeland Security and Alphonse DiMotto, and there's also some Democrats involved with the former senator,
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  he's been all over TV. We've played the clips admitting he's making money as a consultant to one company and the head of another division of a separate one.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  I mean, he's admitted it, and then now they put out a press release last week saying he's made no money from it.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  Should we have congressional hearings about this? Because this looks like classic corruption where the general orders a missile system and then two years later retires and becomes the head of that company where he ordered the missiles.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  Well, you've hit on something else that I've been very outspoken about on the floor, and that is that the defense contractors hire all the retired admirals and generals,
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  and then they go back and sign on with these big defense contractors and go back and get the just ridiculously expensive contracts for the Pentagon.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  In fact, I've said in speeches and in committee hearings that I wonder sometimes if there's any conservatives at the Pentagon, and I can say that even though I believe that national defense is probably the most legitimate function of the federal government,
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  but I still hate to see all the waste and insider dealing going on with the defense department.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  But going back to Turtop, there's something funny going on there, in my opinion, because a year ago, November of last year, he was on Campbell Brown's show on CNN,
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  and he was supporting these standards at that time, and he didn't mention that he had anything to do with any of the companies until Campbell Brown said,
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  well, in the interest of full disclosure, you represent some of these companies, and having been caught, then he said, absolutely, that's correct.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  In other words, he admitted after he confronts him with it, and so then there was a story in the Washington Post at the first of this year saying that he had this connection,
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  and his firm got some kind of a correction, I think they said, for the headline, but not for the story.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  So there's been some kind of connection with these companies for the church off group, and now he's claiming that he never made any money off of it.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  But what he may be trying to say, I don't know, that his group made some money or some other people in his firm, but it still looks like an insider type deal to me.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  Well, absolutely. Speaking about the first point you brought up, Congressman, look, the borders are wide open.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  We've seen news reported two weeks ago that illegal aliens can walk in and get a TSA waiver and have and get to rent aircraft.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  We know that hundreds of boats a week are landing in San Diego and on the island off the coast. That's associated press.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  And that the illegal aliens are just pouring in on the fishing boats, no police, no border patrol, they could care less.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  You're exactly right. And what I've said on that is this, we've got plenty of security at the airports right now, but there's always companies and people trying to get more and get you to spend more.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  But I think now these terrorists would probably do something much more spectacular than bringing down a plane.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  They'd probably blow up a mall at Christmas or blow up a major sporting event or poison a water supply or even blow up a big city subway system.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  They kill a lot more people. And I think, too, we're very vulnerable in cybersecurity. We're so controlled by all the computers and so forth now.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  So we just can't go ridiculously overboard at the airports.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  That's what I'm trying to say. Are we going to have minimum wage federal employees that are outside the law and violate due process?
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  I mean, actually, Big Sis Janet Napolitano is actually in the news now saying next they want them in malls, trains, boats, buses.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  We already have TSA doing warrantless searches in areas like New York and Boston.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  I mean, are we going to have 50 million TSA workers to guard every 7-11?
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  Because, I mean, a real terrorist, I mean, that's just the way it is. The only answer is to have an armed concealed carry population.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  You can't put enough police on the streets with machine guns and dogs.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy to fix and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.

[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  Well, if this continues, we'll have to change the American flag to basically an image of a sheet or a ostrich with its head in the sand.
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:26.000]  And we'll have to get rid of the American eagle and replace it with an ostrich.
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  I mean, since when did the land of the free home of the brave get like this where we're so afraid of men in caves?
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  We've got a better chance from dying from a bee sting or an automobile accident.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  Hundreds die a year from bees and waff stings.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  And I mean, it's just so crazy to see the federal government expanding its power.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  But you're a congressman. You study these issues more than I have.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  I know that the airlines opt in to have the TSA there. Some airlines are saying and some airports are saying they don't want them now.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  But I mean, at the end of the day, where do you see this backlash going?
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  And what are your biggest problems, congressman, with what the TSA is doing?
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  And isn't this a Tenth Amendment violation to have them on the streets of America and announcing that they want to expand what they're doing?
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  Well, we have expanded all of these federal law enforcement agencies far beyond what they should be, far beyond what is necessary.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  I mean, the FBI, I have an uncle whom I love very much, who many, many years ago started his career as an FBI agent and he was just with him for a few years.
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  But I'll tell you, we've expanded that agency far beyond what's necessary.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  And most of the real law enforcement work is done by local law enforcement people in the first place.
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  And I've even said for instance that one agency that we should do away with is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  And now they've added on the word explosives to try to expand their mission.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  But everything that they do is done best by state and local law enforcement people.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  And one expert told me that they're nothing but paper pushers now.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  But I heard you say yesterday that these things, analogy, and I was very impressed by that, I have told people that you really are thousands of times, many thousands of times more likely to be killed driving on the highway than you are by terrorists.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  And the only, the problem we're into is this, Alex, it's almost impossible to get big brother federal government to ever admit making a mistake or ever go back on anything.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  And we've got so much, we've given so much power in this country to unelected bureaucrats.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  In fact, I've said many times that today, unfortunately, we have a government up buying for the bureaucrats instead of up buying for the people.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  And so it's going to be very hard to get them to go back very far on this.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  They're already squirming, though, and saying, well, they're going to tweak this a little bit.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  But I've had other concerns about this, the radiation factor.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  You know, there are several million frequent fliers who on average fly twice a week and getting full body doses.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  The TSA is trying to say, oh, well, it's not, it's just a tiny little dose.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  But I'll tell you, they give you more protection at the dentist.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  When I go to the dentist, they put a little shield over my neck and chest and so forth.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  And this is a full body radiation thing.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  And then I think parents have a legitimate concern about not only the radiation, but also having unfamiliar people grow or feel their children in private type places.
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  I think it's terrible.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  Well, I agree with you, Congressman.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  And I've had radiologists on the show.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  We've got the New York Times, top scientists, federal bodies, the International Atomic Energy Agency have said that these things have 50 times what the TSA claimed a year ago.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  They've been lying.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  And if you look at the images TSA has released to give me an idea, you can see the hands and you can see the bones in the hands.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  And that's exactly what radiologists have told me on and off air is that they've looked at the calibrations.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  It's about like a dental skull x-ray.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  It's not approaching a chest x-ray, but it's close.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  And it's the repeated exposure and they've got all these top scientists on record saying bare minimum skin cancers and that it'll exacerbate people that are already prone to skin cancers.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  What about the TSA workers who are around it all day?
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  They're not hiding behind any lead shielding.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  But Congressman, what about this issue?
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  Ron Paul, we had him on yesterday and you said you heard it.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  Right.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  But I said, so you've had enhanced pat down.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  He said, yes.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  I said, they've touched your crotch.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  He said, yes, it's disgusting.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  That's on the Drudge Report today, the video and audio of that.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  But now the TSA told ABC News, maybe that goes too far, hand in the pants.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  I mean, this is insane.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  And now people are stripping down their underwear as a protest.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  The TSA is still rubbing their skin, rubbing their kneecaps where they have metal in them to make sure it's really metal.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  I mean, this is like the sacrificing our liberty on the all term of big government Congress.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  But my issue is that now it's discriminatory because Boehner, it's videoing on the news.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  He gets to go around the checkpoint.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  A lot of other Congress people, they're not releasing the full list, but it's in the AP.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  The White House says they won't release who it is.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  But now if you're a big wig, you get a pass, but the citizens don't.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  Here's the headline.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  TSA, some government officials to skip airport security.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  A, do you get to bypass it?
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  And B, what's your view of this?
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  Well, no, I don't get to bypass it.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  And I saw that in the paper myself.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  I hadn't even heard that part until I saw that this morning on the news.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  And I assume that they're giving a pass to the top cabinet officials and the top administration officials
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  and the leaders of the House and Senate, the top five in the House and the top four in the Senate.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  I assume that that's what it is.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  But nobody, if we're going to have it, nobody at the top level should be given a pass.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  But there's other concerns that go along with that.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  For instance, I understand that already people who say they don't want to go through the scanning,
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  that some TSA people are resentful about having to do that.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  And so they're being almost rude or irritable or hateful in doing this.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  No, they're rough.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  They're rough.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  They squeeze hard.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  That's confirmed.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  Right, and then I have this concern also that the plans are right now to purchase 1,800 of these scanners
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  by various departments and agencies by the year 2014.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  And what I can see coming is that they'll end up buying several thousand of these things
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  and wanting to put them in all the federal buildings for when you go in, you know,
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  any federal building and all these department agencies,
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  they all want to get all the latest gizmos and so forth.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  But there is one good thing that may come out of this hopefully,
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  and it would be that number one, that Morpheal would begin to realize
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  that just because the word security is mentioned doesn't mean that it's necessary
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  or that it's good or that it's not excessive or intrusive.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  And Morpheal will begin to question these things and then also maybe hopefully some of these bureaucracies
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  will be a little bit slower to purchase a great many of these machines.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  But I just think it's, you know, we've got this big,
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  the latest out-of-control federal government now,
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  and it's totally opposite from what our founding fathers thought the way things should be.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  They thought that we should solve most of our problems through the private free enterprise system
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  and then go to government only for a few things,
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  and first to the local government and then to the state governments
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  and have the federal government.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  It was meant to be only a government of last resort with Barry Q. and Barry Lyndon.
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[1:29:54.000 --> 1:30:00.000]  FiveStarSoap.com for buying a one to two month soap sampler. Thank you.
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  Terany is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  now being expanded nationwide.
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com

[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  We're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches,
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:33:09.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  We are now in to hour number two, 33 minutes in.
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is popping in coming up the next hour.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  Gold is up over $16 an ounce right now because of fears going on on the Korean Peninsula.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  We're going to be talking to Wayne Madsen of the Wayne Madsen Report here in just a moment.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  Wayne Madsen, of course, attended the University of Mississippi where he joined the Navy in ROTC.
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  He then joined the U.S. Navy when he got out of college and was in submarine anti-warfare.
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  He also worked for RCA as a government consultant and then with the National Security Agency, NSA.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  Later he worked with the Navy's National Data Automated Command.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  He's written for many of the biggest publications in the country,
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  and he's also part of EPIC, the Electronic Privacy Information Center.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  And he has the WayneMadsenReport.com.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  And I wanted to get him on in less than 12 hours into this Korean Peninsula situation.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  Of course, we have this report from two years ago by Paul Joseph Watson and by Ian Dye.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  Rand Lobby's Pentagon start war to save U.S. economy.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  And it goes into the Rand Corporation saying they need a war.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  We also have the Washington Post here in my stack where they talk about Obama needing a war.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  David Broder does a war to be able to continue his agenda.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  I'll dig that out and pull it out and show it to you in a minute.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  But the fact that Obama's there last week, the fact that they, the North had said,
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  don't come into these islands, don't fire your artillery in our area, and then they sent them in to do it.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  The fact that it looks like this torpedo that hit the ship a while back ago was German.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  Again, I'm not saying the North Koreans are good folks. They're proxies of the Chinese.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  But this on the heel of the Chinese, WayneMadsen and others believe firing that missile two weeks ago
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  as a way to menace the West ahead of the G20.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  I want to get WayneMadsen's take on all this.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  Now, Wayne, what's your view on it?
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  Well, again, the North Korea is a very paranoid regime.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  It's a Stalinist, but they've made several overtures to the West.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  I would note that this incident follows their invitation to an American scientist
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  who took him to a new uranium enrichment facility where he saw plenty of centrifuges
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  ready to start enriching uranium.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  Now, why did the North Koreans do that?
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  Obviously, they're sending a message.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  We've got this, but we want you to know that they're not trying to hide it.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  They've asked the United States for years to open diplomatic relations with the North,
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  which could lead, remember, technically in a state of war.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  We have an armistice. We don't have a peace agreement between the two countries.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  So there have been, as you mentioned, these incidents where this past March, we had the South Korean Corvette in an area.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  There was the U.S. joint U.S.-South Korean exercises.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  That was an island further to the West from where this island, this island called Yongpyeong.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  That island back in March was the westernmost island,
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  but all these islands lived off the coast of Korea.
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  So they're highly militarized, highly sensitive areas.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  And when the U.S. and or South Koreans engage in military exercises in the area,
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  they always engender a negative response from the North.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  We have to remember, as nutty as Kim Jong-il, who's now turning over the reins of power to his son,
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  as crazy as he is, the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, is just as crazy.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  He's a right winger. He's very unpopular in South Korea.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  The South Koreans don't like him. He's always rattling sabers.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  And I believe on the heels of him, most in G20, the fact that you've got a South Korean as Secretary General of the U.N.,
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  all this plays into Lee Myung-bak also flexing his muscles as much as the people at Red North Korea are flexing hers.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  It's a recipe for disaster. And instead of coaxing the North by staging exercises in North Korean waters,
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  the U.S. should be pulling back on this activity rather than projecting its military presence right into the North Koreans' face.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  Well, I've also got David Broder just a month ago on October 31st, less than a month ago,
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  telling Obama, hey, start a war. North Korea, Iran, whatever, we've got neocons telling him to do it.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  We've got all these Obama advisors saying you need some type of crisis to look strong.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  You've got the dollar plunging. Now it's going back up today because people run to that safe haven
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  because this empire has the biggest military. This is on the heels of the meeting over there.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  We know this is a provocation to send these ships into this disputed area
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  when North Korea said they would fire on them. And so, clearly, they're looking for a provocation.
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  I mean, there's no doubt of that.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  Right. The way the news media is trading this is, you know, North Korea always is, you know,
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  from central casting, the enemy that we'd love to have, secretive, unpredictable.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  I mean, how many times has James Bond been after North Koreans, you know, in the James Bond movies?
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  But the fact is that the South is just as unpredictable.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  I would note that the South is now installing a missile system backed up by a radar system they're getting from Israel.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  So the North doesn't look with favor on this type of thing.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  We also have China upset about similar U.S. naval exercises with South Korean independent ones right off the Chinese coast.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  They feel, look, if you're going to do that off our coast, we can do things off your coast
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  to let you know that we can more than anything else.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  So we also saw the incident with the South Korean ship being sunk, which a lot of people think of myself,
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  and this was notified by people very close to both the North Korean government,
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  the Chinese government, and the U.S. government felt that that was a provocation
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  to get the Japanese Prime Minister Hatuyama to renege on his campaign,
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  promise of throwing the U.S. out of Okinawa.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  He changed his mind. He was attacked by his own party.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  He resigned, and now a pro-U.S. Prime Minister is in Tokyo,
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  and he's helping rattle the state along with the Americans and South Koreans against North Korea.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  And it's a nice political diversion.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  How does this tie in going back to the Chinese missile?
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  A, have you got any more intel confirming your sources that that was a Chinese missile?
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  A, B, why did they do it? C, how does this tie into this latest situation?
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  We know both the West uses South Korea as a proxy, and China uses North Korea as a proxy.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  Right, and there's now sources very close to NORAD that are saying yes,
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  it was a Chinese missile, and that President Obama was informed immediately by the commander of NORAD
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  about the incident, and all he did, of course, was keep it tamped down.
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  He was getting ready to meet the Chinese President in Seoul, and then again in Yokohama, Japan.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  I would also point out that Jackson Dio, in an op-ed piece in the Washington Post,
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  pointed to the amateurs running the foreign policy for the Obama administration.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  But basically, his corner of advisors are his ex-Senator, Hillary Clinton,
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  an ex-Congressional staffer, Tom Donilon, his national security advisor, and a lawyer.
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  Leon Panetta's running the CIA, and you know, both of you, he was pointing out,
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  where's the foreign policy gravitas there? It's not.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  So, you know, remember what Ronald Manuel said, never let a good crisis go to waste.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  Is this also an attempt to boost Obama's commander-in-chief credentials?
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  But I think it's coming in a very bad time when U.S.-Chinese relations are very, very afraid.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  Now, he wanted to pitch some sort of associate membership status or partnership status
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  with Russia on this missile shield, and the Chinese, look at that,
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  is bringing NATO right to its own borders with Russia.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  And then, of course, China pushed the idea of India joining the UN Security Council.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  Something else that China is very much opposed to.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  So, it looks like Obama keeps poking his finger in the Chinese eye.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  Maybe he forgets that China owns a great deal of our debt.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  But again, maybe this is back to the Washington Post op-ed,
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  where, you know, this guy's not the smartest guy in the world.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  We all, you know, just because somebody speaks well, actors speak well, because they weren't room to the line.
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones.

[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.

[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  I'm looking for America.

[1:45:55.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America today.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy to fix and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.

[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  The information war. It's Alex Jones.
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  Webster Griffin Tarbley is going to be riding shotgun with us for the rest of this hour at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  You better believe the circus that is the TSA molestation as they try to impart this mass mental illness of paranoia that there are all these terrorists wanting to get us so they can then set the precedent to put TSA into every airport,
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  every bus terminal, every train station, every highway, every mall, every school. It's all being announced. They're going to be everywhere.
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  As we warned you, Big Sis is now laying it out. But I wanted to make this point before we go to Tarpley.
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  There's all these articles out today. Airport security moving smoothly despite opt out day and the message is you failed.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  People aren't trying to slow down the airports. Some have said that's their goal. The goal is to say no and not use your machines.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  But it's not just opt out. We're saying don't put your hands on our genitals. Then it's oh, we'll try to charge you $11,000. That's if you leave the area.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  So you sit there and you argue with them. You come two hours early. You educate them. You resist. Fox News, all of them are like, oh, go ahead and submit.
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  Don't slow down the airports. NBC says 98% in the poll. Love it.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  But other polls that are scientific show 61, 72, 96% against. On the street, it's got to be 90% against it, what I'm saying.
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  So there's this hoax because they know if they can make you submit to this, they can do anything.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  Now, already in El Paso a few months ago, they said everyone will be put to the naked body scanners. The TSA and Mississippi Chicago Tribune, they plan on making everyone do it.
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  And so, yes, during big peak times, they always open up the regular lanes and don't put everybody through the scanners.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  Most of the airports don't have them yet. Austin gets theirs next month and I ain't going through and nobody's putting their hands on my genitals. Got it?
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  I'm not a terrorist. Your bosses that run this country stage the terror attacks. I've got the evidence and you're funding the other extremists.
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  The government's on record protecting the underwear bomber and where all the lockies hanging out at the Pentagon.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  Now, that's what they're doing. Number one, they lie. They say, you know, we're not putting our hands in your pants. They admit they are.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  There's no radiation danger. Liars, liars, liars, liars. So them saying it isn't slowing it down.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  Then I've got other reports that the airports are locked up all over the country. A lot of it winter storms. They're just a pack of liars.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  So they can do whatever they want. It's not about security. It's about making you submit.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  Now going to Webster Griffin Tarpley of tarpley.net. He's an economist. He has a doctorate in history.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  He also features widely in Fall of the Republic and the Obama deception or upcoming eugenics film.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  And Webster Griffin Tarpley. I wanted to get him on on China announcing in their big Chinese daily, ChinaDaily.com.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  China, Russia, yesterday agreed to quit the dollar in all their inter-country transactions with each other. We've got the North Korean situation,
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  which looks like a provocation on my end about defending North Korea. They're monsters.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  But let's get Tarpley's view on this and then the TSA. Webster, good to have you here with us.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  Thank you, Alex. Maybe I could just say for us concerning this circus, as you say, in the airports.
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  Just two facts to remember that might have gotten lost after all these months.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  You remember, a couple of days after Mutalab was nabbed on Christmas Day, we had this guy Richard Wolfe,
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  this elite British fellow who talks to Oberman on MSNBC.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  And he came out and said, my sources in the White House tell me that this incident was deliberately created.
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  And then he said, we think to make Obama look bad, but the heart of the analysis was correct.
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  The incident was deliberately created, and that was on MSNBC cable news within a week or ten days after the incident had occurred.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  And then, of course, it was covered up. But there was a moment where even the Obama White House realized that the rogue network had created this.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  The second thing is, in actual hearings in front of a House committee, Patrick Kennedy, the deputy secretary of state for consular affairs for visas,
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  said that there was an interagency task force meeting.
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  And the State Department had come forward and said, we have given a visa to Mutalab, but we'd like to revoke it.
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  We want to take it away from him because he's now in Yemen and he's going to different terror camps and so forth.
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  So we want to take the visa away.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  And the answer came from an unnamed agency, still unnamed as far as I know, saying, no, no, don't touch him.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  We've got eyes on him. We're following him. He's a little fish. He'll lead us to the big fish.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  It's essential that you not take his visa away.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  Of course, if you took the guy's visa away, he couldn't get on the plane, and therefore no incident, no circus, no hysteria,
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  and no opportunity for Chertoff to go on television and say, now it's time for these full-body scanners and so forth.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  So this was a manufactured incident, and people should remember this, that there's no basis for what they're doing.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  We don't need body scanners. We need mole detectors.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  We've got to have mole detectors installed at the FBI, and the National Security Agency, and the National Security Council,
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  and throughout the government, right?
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  Mole detectors to know if people are actually government officials trying to do a job,
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  or whether they're loyal to some shadowy rogue network going back to God knows what, to 9-11, to the Kennedy assassination,
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  the Gulf of Duncan, and all the other things that we've seen over the past decade.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  Let's see all of this going.
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  Well, it's, again, we look back to the 1930s. You can see this three-phase process, right?
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  Depression, economic depression, followed by dictatorship, followed by World War.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  And the big problem we have right now is we're in the depression phase,
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  but we can see the dictatorship elements gathering and becoming stronger in the society.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  And that is once you get into the dictatorship phase, it's almost impossible to stop the third phase,
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  which is the World War phase, because that's where it ultimately leads.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  The political forces that could have stopped World War II had been destroyed in places like Germany and Italy during the dictatorship phase.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  So I think the ultimate thing is the only way to fight this is you've got to get out of the depression.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  You've got to have a broad-based economic recovery.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  A return to full employment, a return to prosperity, a return to expanding standards of living.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  Because if you don't do that, the forces in the society pushing towards police states become overwhelming.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  Just one example, we've got this fraud-closure crisis going on.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  Talk about the sanctity of private property. Yeah, there should be that, and there should be the rule of law.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  But right now, we have a zombie banker who can come with fake paperwork and essentially steal your house
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  with the help of a robo-judge and a robo-signer and a bunch of...
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  I mean, that's the issue, is that there's almost, in history, in these cycles of time when the ruling class
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  just goes insane, hire secret police to stick their hands down your pants and train you to submit,
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  started with the Nazi-sing papers, please, and ended with women and children stripped,
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  being marched into holes and their heads being blown off into pits.
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  And banks just stealing everything, taxes going up.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  Look at Ireland. They're now openly saying, we want foreign banks to run Ireland.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  That's the best way. So the banks that have engineered their collapse are now being praised as a solution.
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  Economic conquest is sold as if it's some type of wonderful thing.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  And no one stops the crazy elites, and then they're just going to drive us into a...
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  Hootspah or arrogance or bravada-filled World War III. I mean, I guess that's it.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  They're going to destroy 12% of the gross national product of Ireland in the year 2011.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just to be clear, they say we're going into receivership to foreign banks.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  That was in Reuters with government officials saying, we believe foreign banks should run us.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  And this is now just brazen. We are sellouts. We are tyrants.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  And the banks that are taking over are the ones that engineered it.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  I mean, that's why they were brought into the EU so they could do this raping,
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  and next is Portugal, next is Spain, then England, then France, then Germany. Correct, Webster?
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  Yes, certainly. And the thing, though, is that the forces that resist this need a program.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  For example, today in Portugal, we have reportedly the biggest labor action, the biggest general strike

[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  You look at the Irish austerity plan, they want to have the minimum wage reduced for the average person.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  They want to have the sales tax go from 21% to 23%. Where's the tax on the banks?
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:43.000]  Where's the Wall Street sales tax? Where's the token tax, the turnover tax?
