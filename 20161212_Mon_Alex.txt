[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  From the InfoWars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines.
[00:29.000 --> 00:34.000]  In occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:34.000 --> 00:42.000]  You're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy tank-over.
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:45.000 --> 01:02.000]  You want it baby, you're about to get it.
[01:02.000 --> 01:11.000]  Will these graves still follow only on a God-gods truity? Can't you see it up in the sky?
[01:11.000 --> 01:17.000]  There's a kid here in the face and said to die. You never had the answers.
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.000]  I know, you tell me, the facts are alive. I really couldn't be bothered with you.
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  Get out of my face, I want me dead.
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.000]  It's Monday, the 12th day of December, 2016.
[01:38.000 --> 01:46.000]  And I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:46.000 --> 01:56.000]  About 30 seconds before I went on air, we have different monitors on with Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, C-SPAN.
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.000]  We have TVs in the hallways, TVs in the break room, TVs in the control room, we're just monitoring things.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  Plus screens up everywhere, tracking the latest news developments, going through your news tips.
[02:07.000 --> 02:16.000]  And I was sitting there looking at CNN on the screen and it said, Trump battles CIA.
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  And then it cut to, Trump is with Putin.
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.000]  And I'm just reading the big text, the white text on a red background at the bottom of the screen.
[02:26.000 --> 02:34.000]  And it's so surreal that you have a president that's just trying to restore our republic,
[02:34.000 --> 02:41.000]  get fair trade deals, defend the Second Amendment, appoint Americana judges and Supreme Court.
[02:41.000 --> 02:49.000]  And you've got Hollywood and mainstream media only getting more shrill, more hysterical, more wild-eyed, more crazy.
[02:49.000 --> 03:05.000]  Now, it's coming out very, very quickly that the entire election was manipulated by the Russians' narrative is a huge, gargantuan, colossal hoax.
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  We have the evidence of that today. We're going to be going over.
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.000]  But we've already been hearing this for over a year that Russia's manipulating our election,
[03:13.000 --> 03:19.000]  despite the fact that even Mika Brzezinski has come out and said that if they mildly criticized Hillary,
[03:19.000 --> 03:26.000]  they would get threatened with their jobs by the Clinton campaign through their bosses at NBC.
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  But we already know that from the WikiLeaks.
[03:28.000 --> 03:36.000]  Glenn Greenwald had an article out yesterday where minions of Hillary were just producing completely fake news,
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  giving it to MSNBC, and they were running with it when they knew it was a lie.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  DrudgeReport.com has a story up.
[03:44.000 --> 03:54.000]  The latest reporter that just got hired at a senior position at the New York Times has come out and is now being hired there.
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.000]  And it turns out in the WikiLeaks, this is a person that got directives from the Hillary campaign.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  So even after they're caught, they're doing this.
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  But when I say it's fake to lend us this Russian connection,
[04:09.000 --> 04:15.000]  we have all the multinationals and the globalists and the big foundations and the CIA involved in our elections,
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.000]  all of it's supposed to be illegal.
[04:19.000 --> 04:24.000]  We now have former UK ambassador saying, quote, I met with the DNC leaker,
[04:24.000 --> 04:29.000]  and he isn't Russian saying the CIA information is, quote, total BS.
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  That's the London Guardian today. It's up on infowars.com.
[04:33.000 --> 04:41.000]  We have former US ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, coming out and saying that he believes it's a Obama false flag
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.000]  and that if there isn't any intel, it was planted by them recently during the campaign.
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  Yeah, that makes absolute perfect sense, doesn't it?
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  All this and a lot more, but here's the bottom line.
[04:52.000 --> 04:57.000]  They're trying to overthrow the election of the 45th president of the United States.
[04:57.000 --> 05:00.000]  They now admit they're doing it.
[05:00.000 --> 05:08.000]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation,
[05:08.000 --> 05:15.000]  not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[05:15.000 --> 05:19.000]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[05:19.000 --> 05:24.000]  Are you ignorant of the private federal reserve? Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[05:24.000 --> 05:31.000]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[05:31.000 --> 05:36.000]  What kind of leverage do these people and the federal reserve have over the American people?
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.000]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.000]  Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.

[05:49.000 --> 05:54.000]  Spread the information, educate yourself and others. The truth shall set you free.

[08:08.000 --> 08:26.000]  It's Monday, December 12, 2016. We are now over 38 days out from the historic inauguration of Donald J. Trump to be our 45th president. But as we speak, the forces of globalism are openly trying to overturn his election.
[08:26.000 --> 08:32.000]  And under the directives of Obama, the Central Intelligence Agency has reared its ugly hand.
[08:32.000 --> 08:39.000]  You're listening to our show, show, show.
[08:39.000 --> 08:56.000]  Twenty are more articles I've seen just in the last few hours have been published by mainstream newspapers calling for a new election.
[08:56.000 --> 09:15.000]  It all started Friday and Saturday with CNN and MSNBC and others having CIA operatives like Robert Baron saying that, oh, the evidence is clear, Russia stole the election for Trump.
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  And so we've got to have a new election.
[09:19.000 --> 09:29.000]  There's no coming from the agency that is trained to lie and who's not supposed to be involved under federal law in domestic operations.
[09:29.000 --> 09:40.000]  But you see, three years ago, Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act bipartisanly changed the law to let the CIA engage in disinformation domestically.
[09:40.000 --> 09:48.000]  Now, they've been caught doing it many times since it was founded in 1947. And there were congressional hearings on in the 70s, obviously.
[09:48.000 --> 09:55.000]  But now they are going to the next level. And we've got CNN saying it's a national emergency that trumps in.
[09:55.000 --> 10:03.000]  He's got to be removed. He's a Russian agent. That's the latest this morning. I have a clip of that.
[10:03.000 --> 10:09.000]  They mean business. These are the people that have hijacked this country. They're the globalists. They work for the multinationals.
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.000]  And so whatever they're doing, they turn around and throw it in our face.
[10:14.000 --> 10:20.000]  It wasn't angry Americans of every race, color and creed that were upset about globalism.
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  Who are upset about our jobs being shipped overseas.
[10:24.000 --> 10:34.000]  No. That's not why you voted for Trump. You voted for Trump because the Russians mind controlled you.
[10:34.000 --> 10:39.000]  Russia can barely run its own country. It's got an economy the size of Italy.
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.000]  Though it has three times their population. They're on the verge of collapsing.
[10:44.000 --> 10:50.000]  George Soros admits he's got operatives inside the country, fomenting what they call color revolutions.
[10:50.000 --> 10:56.000]  They have two military bases. We have thousands.
[10:56.000 --> 11:03.000]  China is openly taking over our major infrastructure, Hollywood, the newspapers.
[11:03.000 --> 11:14.000]  That's the newspapers that Carlos Slim hasn't bought up, the Mexican kingpin. But we're told it's Russia, the perfect little boogeyman.
[11:14.000 --> 11:19.000]  China's richest man warns Trump of risk to U.S. jobs.
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.000]  Yes, we have the Chinese communist leaders on television telling us about how we should live.
[11:25.000 --> 11:31.000]  When they're total hypocrites living in opulence worth hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases, like that individual,
[11:31.000 --> 11:38.000]  who is the man buying up the big six Hollywood production studios.
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.000]  He's buying a controlling interest in them.
[11:43.000 --> 11:49.000]  Oh, there's no talk of antitrust there, though. Forget antitrust. What about national security?
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.000]  And then we have these traders of the CIA that clearly killed Kennedy, that have clearly been involved domestically,
[11:54.000 --> 12:00.000]  shipping narcotics into the country.
[12:00.000 --> 12:06.000]  It's amazing.
[12:06.000 --> 12:14.000]  So, as a culture, we have to realize that we have an alien globalist force that has hell been on destroying the American system
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.000]  that's now seized control of this country.
[12:17.000 --> 12:27.000]  And they are arrogant enough, they're full of themselves enough that they are openly now pushing the case that electors should not go for Trump
[12:27.000 --> 12:36.000]  on December 19th, only seven days away, and that Hillary Rodham Clinton should be given via the Electoral College
[12:36.000 --> 12:43.000]  the 45th president's position.
[12:43.000 --> 12:48.000]  Now, everybody knows Trump will fight that, won't he? Well, not if he's dead.
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  And they wouldn't be on the news, and they wouldn't have the CIA out there running around.
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.000]  And they wouldn't have congressmen calling for an overthrow of this election.
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  And Black Lives Matter wouldn't have had its money doubled by Soros the last few months if they weren't planning civil unrest
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.000]  and a national emergency and civil war.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  So, you can look at the tea leaves and try to decide for yourself what you think they're about to pull,
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  but here's the prime analysis.
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  Here's the threat vector.
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.000]  They're moving to overthrow this counter coup we've launched.
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  We've launched this counter coup against the globalists.
[13:23.000 --> 13:29.000]  And they're trying to block us at every front, whether Trump's perfect, whether Trump's a mixed bag,
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  bottom line, they know he wants prosperity.
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  They know he wants growth, and they don't want growth.
[13:35.000 --> 13:41.000]  They want consolidation, and that's his sin.
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.000]  And he doesn't have a score to settle with America.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  He's not out to get the country.
[13:49.000 --> 13:56.000]  Now, I talk about civil unrest, I talk about civil war, I talk about civil emergency, national emergency.
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  CNN now has multiple hosts, and so does MSNBC.
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  I've been hearing this all weekend.
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  I was so concerned I worked most of the weekend and followed a lot of special reports, as many of you know,
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000]  coming out and saying that Trump is destabilizing the country, creating a quote,
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.000]  national emergency, quote, the ultimate goal of the Russian disinformation to undermine democracy.
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  That means undermining the criminals that have hijacked the country and the fake media.
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  He says the ultimate goal of Russian disinformation to undermine democracy, to undermine faith,
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  and institutions like the media.
[14:30.000 --> 14:39.000]  Wall told Stettler, we have a president-elect now who has basically matched some of these key talking points
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  of Russian propaganda to undermine our system.
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.000]  That's the CNN's Stettler, so-called media analyst.
[14:47.000 --> 14:53.000]  So get this, if you're Brexit, you don't want to be under EU control and massive taxes, you must be a Ruski agent.
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.000]  If you don't want to turn your guns in, and don't believe the state owns your kids,
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  and want to control our borders, and don't like Obamacare, you're a Ruski agent.
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.000]  You're no longer a conspiracy theorist, you're no longer a racist.
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  That didn't work. Now you're a Russian agent.
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  And Trump's a Russian agent in between his part-time job as Santa Claus,
[15:14.000 --> 15:18.000]  and his other part-time job as a Loch Ness monster, or a UFO pilot.
[15:18.000 --> 15:23.000]  I mean, this is that insane.
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  Meanwhile, it's been telegraphed by William Benny, and now British ambassadors, and others,
[15:27.000 --> 15:31.000]  that it was the US intelligence agencies that leaked the information.
[15:31.000 --> 15:36.000]  And I already know that, because I was leaked information about the Secret Service.
[15:36.000 --> 15:42.000]  She was falling down, she was having seizures all the time, and we caught her twice having seizures.
[15:42.000 --> 15:47.000]  Millie Weaver caught her having to go in a tent for 45 minutes, they had emergency crews in there.
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  Then we saw her fall down in front of everybody a few days later in New York,
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.000]  and we saw her black ambulance that the Secret Service told us to look for.
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.000]  She's in bad shape, folks.
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.000]  And you saw it happen. We have our own sources.
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.000]  They didn't come from the Russians. DC leaks didn't come from the Russians that came from inside the DNC.
[16:07.000 --> 16:13.000]  People that were horrified by Bernie Sanders have the election stolen from them.
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  And now you've failed at overturning the country.
[16:17.000 --> 16:23.000]  You've lost control, at least, of a critical beachhead, and they're in total panic mode right now.
[16:23.000 --> 16:25.000]  Look at these headlines.
[16:25.000 --> 16:31.000]  Congressman begs electoral college voters to block Trump,
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.000]  especially as the recounts all over the country are showing hundreds of thousands of votes for Trump
[16:36.000 --> 16:40.000]  that hadn't been given to him, stolen by the Hillary people in every state.
[16:40.000 --> 16:44.000]  Isn't that funny? Just what Trump said. Millions of votes were taken from him.
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  And if you add up all the states, they've only done a recount in a couple,
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  the numbers add up to more than two million.
[16:50.000 --> 16:56.000]  So the average held across the country were seen in Michigan and Wisconsin and other states.
[16:56.000 --> 17:01.000]  Former UK ambassador, I met with DNC leaker and he isn't Russian.
[17:01.000 --> 17:05.000]  Craig Murray calls BS, that's his quote, on CIA claims.
[17:05.000 --> 17:09.000]  Paul Joseph Watson, he quotes the London Guardian article.
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  If you read to you from the Guardian, Craig Murray, the former UK ambassador,
[17:14.000 --> 17:20.000]  I understand, who's a close associate of Assange, called the CIA claims BS, adding, they're absolutely making it up.
[17:20.000 --> 17:23.000]  I know who leaked them, Murray, said I've met the person who leaked them,
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.000]  and they are certainly not Russian and it's an insider.
[17:27.000 --> 17:34.000]  It's a leak, not a hack, the two are different things.
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  Here's another one.
[17:36.000 --> 17:43.000]  Trump dismisses Russia CIA claim, says it's a conspiracy theory.
[17:43.000 --> 17:46.000]  He says it's just another excuse.
[17:46.000 --> 17:52.000]  Now what's Bolton say, former full head US ambassador to the UN?
[17:52.000 --> 17:55.000]  Bolton calls Russian hack a false flag.
[17:55.000 --> 17:58.000]  He says it may be a Obama false flag.
[17:58.000 --> 18:05.000]  Former UN ambassador believes intelligence has been politicized in Obama administration.
[18:05.000 --> 18:08.000]  That is the plot calling the kettle black, I gotta tell you about Bolton.
[18:08.000 --> 18:12.000]  It's really weird to hear Bolton and previous and people saying things.
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.000]  I totally agree with when I don't particularly like them.
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  Let's continue. Democratic congressman, again,
[18:18.000 --> 18:22.000]  electors should consider foreign interference reports before casting votes.
[18:22.000 --> 18:28.000]  See, this is all meant to push the idea to give cover to delegates who are being bribed, intimidated, threatened.
[18:28.000 --> 18:31.000]  You know what mafia is doing to juries and grand juries.
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.000]  Imagine what the global mafia is doing right now to those electors.
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  So just announce, oh, we have more evidence.
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.000]  Trump's a Russian agent.
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.000]  Oh, Trump had a heart attack today or Trump's plane blew up.
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.000]  Don't be a conspiracy theorist.
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  We don't know why it blew up.
[18:45.000 --> 18:48.000]  Then they'll bust some patriot person and say they did it or something.
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  I mean, sky's the limit.
[18:51.000 --> 18:59.000]  Renz Priebus asked Chuck Todd, what's your source on NBC News for claiming that Trump won because of the Russians?
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  Meanwhile, when we come back,
[19:01.000 --> 19:11.000]  Senate quietly passes the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act that gives hundreds of millions of dollars to you guys at the CIA and the State Department to engage in disinformation.
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  So now they legalize disinformation.
[19:13.000 --> 19:18.000]  Now they're openly setting up an office instead of it being secretly conduited through WikiLeaks.
[19:18.000 --> 19:23.000]  It's going to be done openly against the American people.
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  But here's the big takeaway from all this.
[19:25.000 --> 19:30.000]  I told everybody, I hate to say I told you so that they weren't going to give up and they were going to try to take the electors.
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  They were going to have recounts.
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  They're going to try to kill Trump.
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.000]  They're in every major newspaper saying, someone please kill him.
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.000]  And now they're saying he's a Russian agent to be able to trigger the president.
[19:43.000 --> 19:50.000]  They believe to be able to authorize a hit team to take out the president-elect before he gets in in 38 days.
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  That's how hardcore this is.
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  That's the waters we're in.
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  I notice folks aren't laughing at me now, are you?
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.000]  This is deadly serious.
[20:28.000 --> 20:34.000]  For years you've looked for safe solutions to protect what you've worked so hard to build.
[20:34.000 --> 20:37.000]  How do you weather the next market correction with confidence?
[20:37.000 --> 20:44.000]  Now there's a way to conquer the technology hurdle and help protect your profits without buying an annuity in any market condition.

[23:54.000 --> 24:00.000]  8-05-222-4584
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.000]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[24:03.000 --> 24:06.000]  Why don't you go hit me?
[24:06.000 --> 24:10.000]  So we've got a bunch of smiley-faced traitors.
[24:10.000 --> 24:15.000]  I think it's funny and cute to artificially put this country into a destabilization,
[24:15.000 --> 24:20.000]  and to prepare the country for a national emergency and CNN's own words.
[24:20.000 --> 24:25.740]  Then they sit back and blame Donald Trump and voters for it, claiming we were all under
[24:25.740 --> 24:28.980]  the control of Russians.
[24:28.980 --> 24:33.140]  This is so over the top insulting.
[24:33.140 --> 24:37.220]  That's right, Catalonia has been trying to leave Spain for 50 years.
[24:37.220 --> 24:41.820]  They're now saying that they successfully voted this year to begin leaving because of
[24:41.820 --> 24:42.820]  the Russians.
[24:42.820 --> 24:51.440]  Merkel was in der Spiegel yesterday and billed, and in Reuters, I saw three articles, blaming
[24:51.440 --> 24:57.300]  the Russians for the fact that her party is losing all these different parliamentary elections.
[24:57.300 --> 25:01.540]  No lady, you're opening the borders up to millions of military aged men that are running
[25:01.540 --> 25:04.060]  around raping and killing.
[25:04.060 --> 25:07.560]  But see, nothing's ever your fault.
[25:07.560 --> 25:13.500]  I was reading the CNN article.
[25:13.500 --> 25:17.340]  They go on to say our institutions aren't trusted.
[25:17.340 --> 25:19.540]  We're sacrosanct.
[25:19.540 --> 25:26.220]  That's like, that's like George Will, when he wrote for the Washington Post, of course
[25:26.220 --> 25:30.020]  your popular vote doesn't count in the primary.
[25:30.020 --> 25:36.540]  It is the sovereign party that decides not a mere plurality of voters, translate that
[25:36.540 --> 25:38.460]  into normal speak.
[25:38.460 --> 25:41.500]  We are royalty, and we don't care about the majority of the vote.
[25:41.500 --> 25:42.780]  That's what that means.
[25:42.780 --> 25:43.980]  We are sovereign.
[25:43.980 --> 25:46.220]  We don't care about plurality of vote.
[25:46.220 --> 25:49.660]  What North Korean nutball planet are you on?
[25:49.660 --> 25:54.220]  But look at the smiley face of stellar on CNN.
[25:54.220 --> 25:55.580]  I mean, just who would watch that guy?
[25:55.580 --> 25:57.580]  Who would listen to that nobody?
[25:57.580 --> 26:03.340]  Just another little quit, and they all sit there and regurgitate how great they are to
[26:03.340 --> 26:08.580]  each other because they control America and Americans are dumb efforts as the WikiLeaks
[26:08.580 --> 26:09.580]  show.
[26:09.580 --> 26:10.580]  And then you've got this.
[26:10.580 --> 26:12.340]  It gets even worse.
[26:12.340 --> 26:16.700]  New York Times hires reporter who said stories to Clinton's staffers for approval.
[26:16.700 --> 26:20.820]  Glenn Thrush, the one that called Thrush to be censored last week on MSNBC for shutting
[26:20.820 --> 26:25.140]  down his competition, won an authoritarian.
[26:25.140 --> 26:26.860]  He's the guy that said, I'll lie.
[26:26.860 --> 26:27.860]  I'm a hack.
[26:27.860 --> 26:29.020]  Just tell me what to write.
[26:29.020 --> 26:33.180]  They're like, oh my God, you're going to get promoted the New York Times.
[26:33.180 --> 26:35.900]  You're amazing.
[26:35.900 --> 26:40.180]  They all sit there with that weird, self-important look on their face, like they're sitting
[26:40.180 --> 26:42.180]  in a huge dirty diaper or something.
[26:42.180 --> 26:46.500]  I don't know what it is about these weird traders and these people that prey on Americans
[26:46.500 --> 26:50.300]  and who lie for a living, but they just are all so self-important.
[26:50.300 --> 26:52.940]  I mean, look at that guy on screen, TV viewers.
[26:52.940 --> 26:55.900]  Look at what a sack of garbage he is.
[26:55.900 --> 26:57.740]  And then look at stellar.
[26:57.740 --> 27:03.300]  He looks even worse with that fake confidence smile on his face all leering like he's a
[27:03.300 --> 27:05.300]  crocodile.
[27:05.300 --> 27:06.900]  I mean, look at that guy.
[27:06.900 --> 27:08.700]  Look at these nobodies.
[27:08.700 --> 27:12.980]  All they can do is go get a job with a trader globalist who can't get anybody real to work
[27:12.980 --> 27:15.380]  for him now because they're so dishonorable.
[27:15.380 --> 27:17.180]  Look at all of these people.
[27:17.180 --> 27:18.900]  This is who rules over us.
[27:18.900 --> 27:24.860]  A bunch of Ivy League nobodies, a bunch of nerds who've got to score to settle with everybody
[27:24.860 --> 27:27.060]  else.
[27:27.060 --> 27:30.980]  I'm sorry, but I'm getting angry.
[27:30.980 --> 27:33.420]  I got a bunch of clips I haven't gotten to and I want to go to them and come back from
[27:33.420 --> 27:34.420]  break.
[27:34.420 --> 27:35.580]  Let's start with one now.
[27:35.580 --> 27:39.860]  This is Bob Baer whose job is overthrowing governments, torturing people, lying, killing
[27:39.860 --> 27:42.380]  people, blaming it on other people that didn't do it.
[27:42.380 --> 27:44.300]  They made a movie, Siriana, about him.
[27:44.300 --> 27:45.700]  Big leftist CIA guy.
[27:45.700 --> 27:47.780]  Remember, the CIA still works for the president.
[27:47.780 --> 27:48.780]  That's Obama.
[27:48.780 --> 27:51.740]  They'll do whatever they're told, at least factions of it.
[27:51.740 --> 27:56.660]  And now, just like they had factions of the CIA put out false reports about WMDs in Iraq,
[27:56.660 --> 27:57.660]  the same thing today.
[27:57.660 --> 28:00.620]  Oh, my gosh, the Russians stole the election.
[28:00.620 --> 28:01.620]  Everybody wanted Hillary.
[28:01.620 --> 28:02.620]  I mean, come on.
[28:02.620 --> 28:03.620]  Don't you want Hillary?
[28:03.620 --> 28:04.700]  She's so popular.
[28:04.700 --> 28:08.540]  Even Joe Biden had to say, I know nobody likes Hillary and she's really unpopular, but you
[28:08.540 --> 28:12.420]  know, she's better than Trump and the crowds are like, oh, I guess.
[28:12.420 --> 28:15.300]  I mean, you're the arrogant, disconnected scum.
[28:15.300 --> 28:17.540]  The Russians didn't do that.
[28:17.540 --> 28:22.340]  Give yourself credit that here's Bob Baer, well, he hadn't seen the evidence, but if
[28:22.340 --> 28:26.460]  there is evidence, which I'm sure there is, we've got to have a new election.
[28:26.460 --> 28:29.020]  They're getting ready to put us into a civil war.
[28:29.020 --> 28:34.740]  You heard it from CNN, what they call it, national emergency.
[28:34.740 --> 28:35.740]  That's their plan.
[28:35.740 --> 28:37.240]  Let's go to it.
[28:37.240 --> 28:40.260]  The Russians, it looks like to me, did interfere in our elections.
[28:40.260 --> 28:44.460]  We'll never be able to decide whether they change the outcome.
[28:44.460 --> 28:48.660]  But I'll tell you, having worked in the CIA, if we had been caught interfering in European
[28:48.660 --> 28:53.180]  elections or Asian elections or anywhere in the world, those countries would call for
[28:53.180 --> 28:56.260]  new elections and any democracy would.
[28:56.260 --> 28:58.220]  And I just, I don't see it any other way.
[28:58.220 --> 29:02.940]  I mean, the electoral college before the 19th has got to know whether the Russians had
[29:02.940 --> 29:07.780]  an effect, whether they went to WikiLeaks, whether they hacked email.
[29:07.780 --> 29:11.580]  He goes on to say, you know, have the electors say no, we're going to break and come back
[29:11.580 --> 29:12.580]  with more.
[29:12.580 --> 29:16.380]  But hey, Bob, it's the CIA we know involved in killing Kennedy.
[29:16.380 --> 29:19.220]  We also know you're not supposed to be operating domestically, you know, you've changed laws
[29:19.220 --> 29:22.300]  to quote, engage in disinfo legally.
[29:22.300 --> 29:24.500]  And so stop meddling with how we voted.
[29:24.500 --> 29:26.420]  Of course we want to make America great again.
[29:26.420 --> 29:27.740]  Of course we want jobs back.
[29:27.740 --> 29:31.540]  I know you're part of the predator class and think it's all funny to keep the public
[29:31.540 --> 29:32.540]  poor and everything.
[29:32.540 --> 29:35.580]  But listen, your domestication is coming to an end, buddy.
[29:35.580 --> 29:36.740]  So you know, I got to hand it to you.
[29:36.740 --> 29:37.740]  You got some hootspa.
[29:37.740 --> 29:39.140]  You got some bravada.
[29:39.140 --> 29:43.980]  You got some hubris because you're really going to try to steal this from this incredibly
[29:43.980 --> 29:49.380]  popular president who's got the military and police firmly behind him 95%.
[29:49.380 --> 29:50.660]  We're on the march.
[29:50.660 --> 29:53.140]  The empire's on the run.
[29:53.140 --> 30:00.140]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.140 --> 30:04.220]  Why is the CIA pushing this ridiculous conspiracy theory?
[30:04.220 --> 30:07.860]  Reports of Russian officials intervening in the American presidential election have been
[30:07.860 --> 30:10.100]  industriously circulated for months.
[30:10.100 --> 30:14.780]  The FBI, DHS and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence are all looking at
[30:14.780 --> 30:19.100]  the same allegations and all of the agencies came up with the same foregone conclusion.
[30:19.100 --> 30:23.460]  Vladimir Putin's government deliberately interfered with America's presidential election.
[30:23.460 --> 30:28.020]  The laughable insinuation was reiterated this morning in an article published in The Hill,
[30:28.020 --> 30:32.020]  attacking President-elect Donald Trump for casting doubt on their assessment, concluding
[30:32.020 --> 30:35.140]  that Russia intervened in the election to help him win the White House.
[30:35.140 --> 30:39.060]  Trump tweeted out, can you imagine if the election results were opposite and we tried
[30:39.060 --> 30:41.140]  to play the Russia CIA card?
[30:41.140 --> 30:45.540]  Keep in mind this is the same CIA that asserted false claims against Saddam Hussein and led
[30:45.540 --> 30:49.820]  us into the invasion of Iraq with a track record like that, one must take their assessments
[30:49.820 --> 30:53.980]  with a spurious grain of salt and question the motivation of these agencies.
[30:53.980 --> 30:56.980]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for info wars.com.
[30:56.980 --> 31:03.820]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and

[31:59.620 --> 32:02.420]  I want to tell you about a brand new often-read product.
[32:02.420 --> 32:04.620]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[32:04.620 --> 32:08.580]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110
[32:08.580 --> 32:10.300]  appliances at your house.
[32:10.300 --> 32:13.300]  Like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.
[32:13.300 --> 32:15.900]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[32:15.900 --> 32:16.900]  It's mobile.
[32:16.900 --> 32:21.700]  To jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[32:21.700 --> 32:26.260]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, basically creating
[32:26.260 --> 32:28.740]  your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[32:28.740 --> 32:29.740]  A true innovation.

[32:40.380 --> 32:42.540]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.

[33:26.660 --> 33:35.180]  The Alex Jones Show because there is a war on for your mind.
[33:35.180 --> 33:37.940]  I'm sitting back really pinching myself.
[33:37.940 --> 33:38.940]  Am I dreaming?
[33:38.940 --> 33:43.980]  I mean, we're in the middle of open world government being announced.
[33:43.980 --> 33:49.940]  We've got the corporate media with almost no ratings that's in cardiac arrest, only
[33:49.940 --> 33:54.860]  intensifying their efforts to cause a civil war in the country and basically admitting
[33:54.860 --> 33:55.860]  it.
[33:55.860 --> 34:01.980]  They're saying they want to unseat the elected president because he's a Russian agent.
[34:01.980 --> 34:07.220]  They have actually called me a Russian agent and they've called Tucker Carlson last Thursday.
[34:07.220 --> 34:08.660]  We played it last Friday.
[34:08.660 --> 34:14.260]  A congressman was on a Democrat and said, oh, that's because you're a Russian operative.
[34:14.260 --> 34:20.140]  No, you are globalist operatives.
[34:20.140 --> 34:24.580]  You are the open new world order megabanks that have hijacked this country and almost
[34:24.580 --> 34:27.860]  every other country in the world and run it in the ground.
[34:27.860 --> 34:32.980]  And your philosophy is to make us poor and make us fight with each other while you rule
[34:32.980 --> 34:40.260]  over us and we don't want to do that anymore.
[34:40.260 --> 34:43.380]  And now they're openly calling for censoring the free and independent press.
[34:43.380 --> 34:46.540]  I extended the petition out through the weekend.
[34:46.540 --> 34:48.540]  We're now over 150,000 signatures.
[34:48.540 --> 34:53.860]  We're a Senator Trump or a Senate to Congress calling for president elect to do something
[34:53.860 --> 34:56.580]  about the calls to end the First Amendment.
[34:56.580 --> 35:01.100]  You know, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting
[35:01.100 --> 35:08.940]  the free exercise thereof or the freedom of the press or the people to rightfully assemble
[35:08.940 --> 35:11.020]  and petition their government for redress and grievances.
[35:11.020 --> 35:12.980]  I'm going from memory.
[35:12.980 --> 35:13.980]  I'm so flustered.
[35:13.980 --> 35:17.900]  Can we put the First Amendment on screen for me so I can read it properly?
[35:17.900 --> 35:25.380]  It's the First Amendment for a reason and you've got the CIA in the middle of this with
[35:25.380 --> 35:30.900]  Obama saying we've got evidence they were involved.
[35:30.900 --> 35:36.580]  The Russians were involved on covering Trump favorably in their news and some of that limited
[35:36.580 --> 35:38.580]  news got in the U.S.
[35:38.580 --> 35:44.060]  Well, I mean, I was favorable towards the Brexit and I support Nigel Farage.
[35:44.060 --> 35:46.100]  Of course, that's how that works.
[35:46.100 --> 35:48.300]  There were a lot of Brits who were supportive of Trump.
[35:48.300 --> 35:51.380]  I think there was more Brits support than Russian support because they speak the same
[35:51.380 --> 35:56.700]  language and it's part of the same culture of the English-speaking peoples.
[35:56.700 --> 36:01.220]  Written about by Churchill in his three-volume set that I've read, the history of the English-speaking
[36:01.220 --> 36:02.220]  peoples.
[36:02.220 --> 36:03.220]  It's excellent.
[36:03.220 --> 36:04.220]  You should read it.
[36:04.220 --> 36:08.140]  But was it like secret agents?
[36:08.140 --> 36:10.140]  Absolutely not.
[36:10.140 --> 36:15.060]  Russia has a kinship to us because they've been under the same oligarchs, the same very
[36:15.060 --> 36:18.060]  central banks.
[36:18.060 --> 36:22.140]  So I'm going to get into these clips here in a moment and then get into the other news.
[36:22.140 --> 36:29.700]  But there's really no way to overstate the unprecedented peril that this country and
[36:29.700 --> 36:33.460]  this world is in right now.
[36:33.460 --> 36:39.460]  Unprecedented with the CIA involved and electors getting ready to vote against Trump and all
[36:39.460 --> 36:42.740]  this other garbage, I'm here to tell you.
[36:42.740 --> 36:47.740]  Their continuity of government systems, if there really was someone put in by the Russians
[36:47.740 --> 36:51.740]  then the directives are to move to remove them.
[36:51.740 --> 36:55.820]  This is the cover they need inside government to pretend they're a bunch of patriots and
[36:55.820 --> 37:01.700]  try to organize enough people out of agencies to make them move against Trump to remove
[37:01.700 --> 37:04.420]  him or even assassinate him.
[37:04.420 --> 37:07.580]  And it can go a lot of different ways.
[37:07.580 --> 37:10.260]  They announced the electors aren't going for Trump.
[37:10.260 --> 37:14.260]  Next time he gets on board his plane, it blows up and they'll just say it's a conspiracy
[37:14.260 --> 37:15.260]  theory.
[37:15.260 --> 37:16.260]  We don't know why it blew up.
[37:16.260 --> 37:17.740]  Don't ask why it blew up.
[37:17.740 --> 37:21.820]  That's how brazen they are because they want a riot.
[37:21.820 --> 37:23.460]  They want a civil war.
[37:23.460 --> 37:30.220]  Then they can bring in their control because they can't win a peaceful information war.
[37:30.220 --> 37:31.260]  We are defeating them.
[37:31.260 --> 37:33.700]  We are absolutely running the tables against them.
[37:33.700 --> 37:36.580]  We are annihilating them in the information war.
[37:36.580 --> 37:40.380]  In short-term, mid-term, long-term, it just gets better for us.
[37:40.380 --> 37:44.140]  That's why they want to start a global war, an economic collapse.
[37:44.140 --> 37:47.060]  It's why they want to create civil unrest.
[37:47.060 --> 37:49.020]  And by the way, we're in a national emergency.
[37:49.020 --> 37:52.020]  I keep saying national emergency, we're in a national emergency.
[37:52.020 --> 37:55.580]  And some people say, oh, you're fair-mongering, where's the national emergency?
[37:55.580 --> 38:01.460]  When you've got foreign globalist banks financing billions to fund leftist groups to go out and
[38:01.460 --> 38:05.820]  burn buildings and shoot cops in the back of the head, you're in a national emergency.
[38:05.820 --> 38:10.500]  When you've got George Soros that's overthrown more than 25 countries, last time I checked,
[38:10.500 --> 38:16.940]  it's probably 30 or more, who finances the collapse of civilizations, openly involved
[38:16.940 --> 38:20.940]  in destabilization, we're in an emergency.
[38:20.940 --> 38:23.220]  And people better get that through your head.
[38:23.220 --> 38:26.060]  We're witnessing the attempted takedown of America.
[38:26.060 --> 38:28.300]  The globalists were already pretty much in control.
[38:28.300 --> 38:33.540]  They were trying to mop up the states, bring in speech controls, bring in censorship of
[38:33.540 --> 38:36.260]  the free press, and bring in gun control.
[38:36.260 --> 38:40.540]  They were already saying, your kids belong to us, force inoculations, the borders are
[38:40.540 --> 38:45.220]  wide open, Obama's above the law, we can do whatever we want.
[38:45.220 --> 38:47.260]  The CIA can be involved domestically.
[38:47.260 --> 38:52.100]  They were already rolling it out, and patriots in government, mainly, rallied with the Liberty
[38:52.100 --> 38:55.540]  Movement, and we took the country back.
[38:55.540 --> 38:59.900]  Russia obviously cheered it on, so did the Brits who just had Briggs, so did the Greeks
[38:59.900 --> 39:00.900]  who are trying to get out of it.
[39:00.900 --> 39:04.820]  And the Italians just voted to stop EU expansion, and they're over there in the news saying
[39:04.820 --> 39:06.900]  it must have been the Ruskies.
[39:06.900 --> 39:11.620]  No, the Italians are already under the EU, they already have to pay for all the EU programs
[39:11.620 --> 39:15.180]  like the Germans do, and don't get stuff back.
[39:15.180 --> 39:24.060]  And so they voted to not give EU veto power over their Congress, over their parliament.
[39:24.060 --> 39:28.660]  They voted against EU expansion, that's EU's response people wanting to pull out is, we'll
[39:28.660 --> 39:33.020]  just expand total authority and have an EU army march in and take over.
[39:33.020 --> 39:38.260]  Italy said no, they're in the news saying Italy was influenced by Russians.
[39:38.260 --> 39:45.020]  Same thing this weekend, Merkel, she's losing seats in parliament because of the Ruskies.
[39:45.020 --> 39:49.220]  If you know, instead of saying the dog at your homework, just say Vladimir Putin ate
[39:49.220 --> 39:50.220]  it.
[39:50.220 --> 39:54.300]  Oh, you didn't get an A in school, say Vladimir Putin did it, you lost your job, say Vladimir
[39:54.300 --> 39:55.300]  Putin did it.
[39:55.300 --> 40:02.100]  If I fall down, if I slip on a banana peel, I'm going to blame the Russians.
[40:02.100 --> 40:06.100]  If I eat too much cake and get fat, I'm going to blame Daria who works at the office who
[40:06.100 --> 40:07.100]  was born in Russia.
[40:07.100 --> 40:08.100]  It's her fault.
[40:08.100 --> 40:14.940]  But see, they don't even want you to buy this propaganda, they just want the legalese cover
[40:14.940 --> 40:19.340]  in their own minds to claim there was foreign Russian involvement.
[40:19.340 --> 40:24.900]  And now Politifact is saying that Renz Priebus is wrong because, I saw this here in the break,
[40:24.900 --> 40:31.340]  because he told NBC's Chuck Todd, another Democratic Party operative, taken over the media, that
[40:31.340 --> 40:32.340]  what's your proof?
[40:32.340 --> 40:33.340]  You don't have any proof.
[40:33.340 --> 40:34.340]  You don't have a source.
[40:34.340 --> 40:40.020]  Oh no, Defense Intelligence said Russia has the ability to hack U.S. systems.
[40:40.020 --> 40:42.580]  The ability is not doing it.
[40:42.580 --> 40:46.300]  Renz Priebus falsely claims no conclusive report whether Russia tried to influence election.
[40:46.300 --> 40:52.180]  Politifact, same folks that told you Obamacare was free.
[40:52.180 --> 40:56.780]  They're ruling, oh, mainstream media, Politifact says so.
[40:56.780 --> 41:01.860]  Now, before I go any further into all this, it's time to hit our knees and pray to God
[41:01.860 --> 41:04.380]  for providence and that Donald Trump be protected.
[41:04.380 --> 41:07.700]  I'm also going to get into some of the things Trump's doing that I don't personally like,
[41:07.700 --> 41:12.340]  but overall, he's got them hopping mad because he's not a globalist and they're trying to
[41:12.340 --> 41:13.420]  remove him.
[41:13.420 --> 41:18.340]  They're trying to sabotage him and I know he's moving forward like he's the president,
[41:18.340 --> 41:22.300]  doing more than Obama's done in eight years to get us jobs, he's acting like the commander
[41:22.300 --> 41:27.540]  in chief, he's basically already is the commander in chief, but he understands how serious this
[41:27.540 --> 41:32.020]  is, but he's just moving forward as president, so when they try to say he's not the president,
[41:32.020 --> 41:33.540]  the people say no en masse.
[41:33.540 --> 41:37.100]  The problem is they don't care if the majority of America is understanding what's happening
[41:37.100 --> 41:39.900]  or that Trump's legal and lawful.
[41:39.900 --> 41:45.860]  They just want the political cover for themselves after they assassinate him or set him up to
[41:45.860 --> 41:50.820]  be able to then sell the idea, at least to their own people, that what they did was right.
[41:50.820 --> 41:55.900]  So I'm telling you, Donald Trump is in grave physical danger, he's in political danger
[41:55.900 --> 41:56.940]  and so are we.
[41:56.940 --> 42:00.380]  The New World Order didn't hijack this country and spent hundreds of billions of dollars
[42:00.380 --> 42:03.020]  doing it to just turn it over.
[42:03.020 --> 42:05.380]  They're going to fight for it.
[42:05.380 --> 42:10.220]  They knew there was a tsunami that night that defeated their attempt to steal.
[42:10.220 --> 42:15.820]  They had to reorganize and I told you they'd be back and 38 days out, they are back.
[42:15.820 --> 42:22.020]  Maximum alert, they're bringing in censorship, maximum alert, they're using me as the poster
[42:22.020 --> 42:26.300]  child to shut down free speech because we're so effective.
[42:26.300 --> 42:33.060]  Maximum alert, they know the Trump crew understands that what I'm breaking down is accurate.
[42:33.060 --> 42:36.820]  That's why they're so scared, that's one of the reasons.
[42:36.820 --> 42:41.220]  They know the mainstream media is dead, they've got to move and try to discredit us now, shut
[42:41.220 --> 42:45.500]  us down now or they're doomed forever.
[42:45.500 --> 42:50.100]  They are a cornered rat.
[42:50.100 --> 42:56.300]  Even the Washington Times seeing its implosion has joined with Sauron and is putting out
[42:56.300 --> 42:59.180]  fake quotes against me.
[42:59.180 --> 43:04.780]  Paul Watson wrote an article exposing it, hundreds of newspapers this weekend because
[43:04.780 --> 43:10.020]  we carry the light of the Republic, the fire that can reignite 1776.
[43:10.020 --> 43:12.300]  We've already done it, you've already done it.
[43:12.300 --> 43:18.180]  Myself, the audience, all of us, the guests, interfacing synergistically, not collectively,
[43:18.180 --> 43:23.540]  but synergistically is unstoppable.
[43:23.540 --> 43:25.340]  Before I go any further, we need to fund this operation.
[43:25.340 --> 43:27.180]  I want to commend you all for your support.
[43:27.180 --> 43:33.420]  That's why if you order by the 17th or 18th, anywhere in the United States, we can guarantee
[43:33.420 --> 43:36.460]  you get delivery by the United States Puzzle Service.
[43:36.460 --> 43:42.620]  You can also click on there and get it by UPS or FedEx if you'd like and get it even
[43:42.620 --> 43:43.620]  faster.
[43:43.620 --> 43:47.220]  And we're running, again, this matches the biggest specials we've had so far in the last
[43:47.220 --> 43:48.220]  12 months.
[43:48.220 --> 43:52.020]  We've only done a sale like this two other times, one about a month ago and one a few
[43:52.020 --> 43:53.020]  months before that.
[43:53.020 --> 43:56.100]  I tend to do this towards the end of the year.
[43:56.100 --> 43:58.140]  We have free shipping store-wide.
[43:58.140 --> 43:59.500]  We were going to have a special each day.
[43:59.500 --> 44:01.020]  I just said, you know what?
[44:01.020 --> 44:02.020]  Change it this morning.
[44:02.020 --> 44:06.500]  I said, I want everything discounted between 50% and 30% off.
[44:06.500 --> 44:11.980]  The lowest discounts, 25% off on bio-true selenium because it's already so inexpensive.
[44:11.980 --> 44:13.140]  Super high quality.
[44:13.140 --> 44:18.180]  Rainforest plus with 20% more is also 25% off.
[44:18.180 --> 44:21.140]  Supermell vitality has a big discount.
[44:21.140 --> 44:28.380]  Survival shield X2, secret 12, vitamin B12, living defense, colloidal silvers, 50% off.
[44:28.380 --> 44:33.340]  We brought back the 25% off on DNA force, but that's why supplies last.
[44:33.340 --> 44:35.740]  It's going to sell out any day now.
[44:35.740 --> 44:37.860]  BioPCA, hair, skin, and nails.
[44:37.860 --> 44:41.900]  At $19.95, it's already the lowest price share we're going to find with free shipping on
[44:41.900 --> 44:44.700]  top of it, unbelievable.
[44:44.700 --> 44:50.740]  Leading hair, skin, and nail formulas that cost $45 to $60 to $70 to $80 have less dosages
[44:50.740 --> 44:53.340]  of the very same things that are in this.
[44:53.340 --> 44:55.820]  There's some products out there that are total rip-offs, folks.
[44:55.820 --> 44:58.860]  You see, if I can get something really inexpensive with this high quality, I'll just sell it
[44:58.860 --> 45:01.420]  super discounted.
[45:01.420 --> 45:05.500]  This is the same stuff you get in the salons for $60.
[45:05.500 --> 45:09.300]  They've got seven times the markup at those salons, folks, when it's $65.
[45:09.300 --> 45:12.620]  This is $19.95, and we make $10.
[45:12.620 --> 45:14.820]  We make a good profit to fund me up.
[45:14.820 --> 45:20.540]  I mean, I have to give people a good deal, and I want to thank you for the support.
[45:20.540 --> 45:25.060]  Living defense, 30% off silver bullet, 50% off brain force, 30% off winter sun, 25% off
[45:25.060 --> 45:26.700]  survival shield, 30% off.
[45:26.700 --> 45:27.700]  That's a big deal.
[45:27.700 --> 45:28.700]  Biotrucelinium.
[45:28.700 --> 45:29.700]  I'm sorry.
[45:29.700 --> 45:30.940]  They told me 25% is all they could do.
[45:30.940 --> 45:31.940]  It's 30% off.
[45:31.940 --> 45:32.940]  Excuse me.
[45:32.940 --> 45:33.940]  That's no correction.
[45:33.940 --> 45:34.940]  It's better than I said.
[45:34.940 --> 45:35.940]  Plus, store-wide free shipping.
[45:35.940 --> 45:39.060]  Order today and get guaranteed delivery by Christmas.
[45:39.060 --> 45:42.060]  This Christmas Super Sale is yet another 360 Win.
[45:42.060 --> 45:45.540]  Support the operation and get super high quality products that also make great gifts.
[45:45.540 --> 45:51.180]  Visit infowarslife.com today and take advantage of the InfoWars 2016 Super Sale before we sell
[45:51.180 --> 45:52.180]  out.
[45:52.180 --> 45:53.180]  That's infowarslife.com.
[45:53.180 --> 45:57.980]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're committed to this fight.
[45:57.980 --> 46:02.460]  We also, I'm somewhat of a camper, but I'm not a real outdoorsman.
[46:02.460 --> 46:05.300]  And I know CJ is a huge outdoorsman.
[46:05.300 --> 46:09.780]  He said, Alex, these thermal tents and thermal sleeping bags, because I told the crew, along
[46:09.780 --> 46:13.740]  with the very best survival equipment, where it's the highest quality at a good price.
[46:13.740 --> 46:14.740]  It's a nexus point.
[46:14.740 --> 46:16.620]  You can always buy something that's, you know, $1,000.
[46:16.620 --> 46:17.620]  It's better.
[46:17.620 --> 46:26.420]  We're talking about tents for $149, sleeping bags for $59, water packs for, you know, $54.
[46:26.420 --> 46:28.500]  It's all there.
[46:28.500 --> 46:33.580]  These are the very best brand names that aren't even available in many stores.
[46:33.580 --> 46:34.580]  These folks are patriots.
[46:34.580 --> 46:35.580]  They're listeners.
[46:35.580 --> 46:39.020]  They get, there's no reviews yet, but you can go check these.
[46:39.020 --> 46:45.980]  These are the highest quality survival thermal tents and sleeping bags in water systems where
[46:45.980 --> 46:48.980]  you put your own bottle internally so you can change it up.
[46:48.980 --> 46:50.180]  It's amazing.
[46:50.180 --> 46:55.260]  So brand names, highest quality, when you purchase them at infowarstore.com, you're funding our
[46:55.260 --> 46:59.900]  operation and you make it all possible.
[46:59.900 --> 47:02.540]  And trust me, we're under incredible attack.
[47:02.540 --> 47:04.900]  We have stove and a can for $495.
[47:04.900 --> 47:10.700]  This is just great for camping, but while you're at it, support the info war.
[47:10.700 --> 47:14.140]  And while you're at it, have backup supplies in case the power goes out, in case there's
[47:14.140 --> 47:15.140]  a war.
[47:15.140 --> 47:18.020]  One of the cases being self-sufficient is the answer.
[47:18.020 --> 47:22.340]  Not because we're living in fear, but because we're living awake and involved and informed
[47:22.340 --> 47:25.180]  and prepared and knowing how to use firearms.
[47:25.180 --> 47:27.140]  You know, I've gone from only going and shooting four or five times a year.
[47:27.140 --> 47:28.140]  I got so busy.
[47:28.140 --> 47:30.020]  I'm trying to shoot every week right now.
[47:30.020 --> 47:31.140]  I'm finally not playing games.
[47:31.140 --> 47:32.860]  I'm getting my concealed carry this week.
[47:32.860 --> 47:34.580]  You'd think I'd have it, but I've been fighting so hard.
[47:34.580 --> 47:35.580]  I haven't done it.
[47:35.580 --> 47:39.740]  Plus I don't live in fear, but the threats are serious enough now that I'm packing.
[47:39.740 --> 47:44.420]  So and believe me, it's, it's, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[47:44.420 --> 47:47.020]  The globalists are activating their minions are activating.
[47:47.020 --> 47:48.260]  They're coming out of hibernation.
[47:48.260 --> 47:50.340]  They're coming out of sleeper cell mode.
[47:50.340 --> 47:51.340]  It's a cult folks.
[47:51.340 --> 47:58.980]  I had a guy look like a in shapes, you know, 56, 57 year old professor type get in my face
[47:58.980 --> 48:03.340]  this weekend and say that I was wrong for not supporting world government.
[48:03.340 --> 48:06.340]  I mean, it's just, they're upset.
[48:06.340 --> 48:07.340]  They're angry.
[48:07.340 --> 48:08.340]  They're bowed up.
[48:08.340 --> 48:11.580]  They're tied into this big sick mental ill system.
[48:11.580 --> 48:16.940]  They're really not successful themselves, but by imagining they're part of the sellout,
[48:16.940 --> 48:19.820]  they're diluted enough to buy into it.
[48:19.820 --> 48:21.260]  So we have the Christmas super sale.
[48:21.260 --> 48:23.780]  I want to add that because it's so politically incorrect.
[48:23.780 --> 48:24.780]  Hey, it's America.
[48:24.780 --> 48:26.580]  Hey, it's a Christian holiday.
[48:26.580 --> 48:32.220]  So what if you're not a Christian, take advantage of the sales, Christmas, super sale specials.
[48:32.220 --> 48:38.820]  But if you're not a Christian, I don't mean the big fake churches out there, but really
[48:38.820 --> 48:42.140]  get in a relationship with God, I would tell you that it is important to try to understand
[48:42.140 --> 48:45.980]  there's a whole nother world out there and the globalist hate Christians for a reason
[48:45.980 --> 48:51.740]  because the, the, the spirit of it is what powered 1776 and they don't like that energy.
[48:51.740 --> 48:53.740]  They don't like that spirit.
[48:53.740 --> 48:57.140]  But again, bio crystallinium, all of it, store wide free shipping, you sign up for auto

[50:03.860 --> 50:05.540]  Right man.
[50:05.540 --> 50:11.140]  He started taking without me even knowing the survival shield X2 iodine because he read
[50:11.140 --> 50:15.540]  a book about iodine and how it boosted IQs and all the rest of it and I said, man, you've
[50:15.540 --> 50:16.540]  seen really focused lately.
[50:16.540 --> 50:19.820]  And he said, yeah, I've been on that about a month and he said, I was at the detox a
[50:19.820 --> 50:23.940]  few weeks ago and then suddenly I'm so clear headed, it's like I'm flying, it's exactly
[50:23.940 --> 50:24.940]  what you talked about.
[50:24.940 --> 50:26.820]  I don't know how it all metabolically works.
[50:26.820 --> 50:29.980]  I mean, I've been told, but I'm not going to attempt to go over it all, but it pushes
[50:29.980 --> 50:34.340]  out the bad garbage, it fills your glands, your thyroid with what it needs.
[50:34.340 --> 50:39.500]  Then they activate and then the whole electrochemical system in the body begins to operate like
[50:39.500 --> 50:40.500]  it should.
[50:40.500 --> 50:45.940]  You fuse X2 with bio true selenium from the mustard seed we have electrochemical.

[54:33.700 --> 54:39.900]  they've got two right now they get two more similar delegates with or electors as they're
[54:39.900 --> 54:46.460]  called to take the electoral votes away you could see trump behind hillary and I guess
[54:46.460 --> 54:50.300]  they're going to try to put Hillary in office if people keep saying that's too bold that's
[54:50.300 --> 54:56.660]  too insane they wouldn't have the CIA all over TV saying we've got to have a new election
[54:56.660 --> 55:02.460]  this wasn't the case they mean to try it these are bold criminals because again after they
[55:02.460 --> 55:06.780]  committed all those crimes or if they did all that stuff nobody got in trouble even
[55:06.780 --> 55:11.020]  though it's all the WikiLeaks and on the surface trumps been saying oh I'm going to back off
[55:11.020 --> 55:16.620]  hillary's been through enough well notice trump that they're coming after you that's
[55:16.620 --> 55:19.900]  what I've told him when I've been on the phone with him I've said mr. president elect they're
[55:19.900 --> 55:23.980]  not going to stop they're never going to stop they're never going to stop you have to get
[55:23.980 --> 55:28.900]  on the offense against them well I'm just going to focus on cutting taxes and get the
[55:28.900 --> 55:33.300]  economy going that's what'll show the people they can have prosperity I'm like I know but
[55:33.300 --> 55:37.460]  it didn't like a business deal this is a mafia and I'm not saying I lecture the president
[55:37.460 --> 55:43.020]  but he knows they think he's going after it when he gets in because of sessions and other
[55:43.020 --> 55:49.260]  things he's done but this is a serious war we're in a war right now fact the war got
[55:49.260 --> 55:53.740]  worse once he became president elect and that's what that's what Michael Savage always said
[55:53.740 --> 55:58.380]  when he was on before the election we should get him back on Michael Schneider is coming
[55:58.380 --> 56:01.500]  on he's been writing extensively about how they're trying to bring in civil emergency
[56:01.500 --> 56:06.380]  and the different angles and then Wayne Madsen always informative from the national security
[56:06.380 --> 56:10.060]  agency will be joining us and David Knight in the fourth hour before I go any further
[56:10.060 --> 56:15.500]  let's play some of those clips here's Bolton saying Russian hack could have been an Obama
[56:15.500 --> 56:20.300]  false flag I thought false flags didn't exist but clearly did you ever think of that they
[56:20.300 --> 56:24.820]  could hack from outside the country they say if it comes from Russia to be a guy in a hotel
[56:24.820 --> 56:29.420]  room in Russia an American or anybody else or a mercenary then we've got to physically
[56:29.420 --> 56:35.620]  attack Russia that's the parameters they're setting up let's go to that clip we have to
[56:35.620 --> 56:41.980]  know the facts here and it's not at all clear to me just viewing this from the outside that
[56:41.980 --> 56:48.540]  this hacking into the DNC and the RNC computers was not a false flag operation are you actually
[56:48.540 --> 56:53.340]  accusing someone here in this administration of trying to go in the community of trying
[56:53.340 --> 56:59.540]  to throw something we just don't know but I believe that intelligence has been politicized
[56:59.540 --> 57:03.820]  in the Obama administration do a very significant we're sure they get caught all the time now
[57:03.820 --> 57:08.860]  let's go out to break with rents previous challenges Chuck Todd what is your source and they admit
[57:08.860 --> 57:13.260]  they're not saying the source or saying a secret report with the CIA's history of putting
[57:13.260 --> 57:18.460]  out nothing but fake reports here it is but what I don't want to do Chuck is have a debate
[57:18.460 --> 57:24.140]  with you over an unnamed source that the article said was inconclusive over who hacked and
[57:24.140 --> 57:29.660]  why they hacked look someone hacked we don't like that I don't like it no one wants it
[57:29.660 --> 57:34.060]  we want to protect American interest it's America first I don't want to DNC hacked I don't
[57:34.060 --> 57:39.020]  want anybody hacked but I don't know who did the hacking that's my point so seven second
[57:39.020 --> 57:44.380]  point of view has no idea whether the hajans even influence the election you dispute 17
[57:44.380 --> 57:50.340]  different intelligence agencies that have assessed that Russia agents were behind this
[57:50.340 --> 57:55.700]  you just you just I dispute you a Democratic Party hack known for lying who's been caught
[57:55.700 --> 58:00.020]  in WikiLeaks emails coordinating fake news reports sitting here changing the subject
[58:00.020 --> 58:05.220]  from your corruption in these emails that were illegally being stored at Hillary's house
[58:05.220 --> 58:09.940]  but you turn the whole thing around on the American people and turn us all into enemies
[58:09.940 --> 58:12.900]  it's like the Southern Poverty Law Center says if you don't like Obamacare you're a
[58:12.900 --> 58:19.020]  Nazi you turn the country that defeated the Nazis into Nazis want to come back and finish
[58:19.020 --> 58:23.620]  up the rest of this clip just looking at the arrogance of Chuck Todd the you know the anger
[58:23.620 --> 58:28.620]  the belligerence they all have this spirit about them of just nastiness these are enemies
[58:28.620 --> 58:34.220]  of this country and that's why they claim we're foreign assets I'm Alex Jones spread the word

[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:38.700]  to the Alex Jones show so here is Chuck Todd democratic party operative these were the
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:49.620]  highest levels of multiple administrations is a Clinton and of course Obama operative
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:55.260]  sitting there arrogantly talking to rents previous everybody knows I don't like but still
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:01:03.660]  he's telling the truth turning it around saying oh you disagree with 17 agencies no it is a
[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:09.380]  secret report by the CIA but defense intelligence that Michael Flynn formally ran thank you you
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:15.700]  brought me water has said of course the Russians can hack but there's no proof they did hack
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:22.420]  this election now we have British ambassadors and others coming out saying I've met with
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:28.020]  the real hacker it's a US intelligence operative that's what our sources have been saying for
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:34.460]  a long time so here is this exchange but what I don't want to do Chuck is have a debate with
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:39.980]  you over an unnamed source that the article said was inconclusive over who hacked and
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:45.500]  why they hacked look someone hacked we don't like that I don't like it no one wants it
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:49.900]  we want to protect American interest it's America first I don't want to DNC hacked I don't
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:54.940]  want anybody hacked but I don't know who did the hacking that's my point so the second
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:02:00.340]  point is you have no idea what if the Hagen even influence the election you dispute 17
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:06.420]  different intelligence agencies that have assessed that Russia agents work behind this
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:11.900]  you just you dispute this check this is insane in the same article about those 17 agencies
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:16.860]  that report was inconclusive you're forgetting the most important piece it was inconclusive
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:23.020]  about Vladimir Putin Reince it was not inconclusive that Russian agents were involved there's
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:27.060]  a difference and I understand why you're trying to force us but there is a difference I'm
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:34.180]  not trying to force it I don't know who did the hacking Chuck the article is based on
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:40.300]  a lie that the RNC was hacked so the entire premise of the article is false the sources
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:46.820]  are unnamed and the report was inconclusive listen I don't want anyone hacked okay the
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:53.100]  point is though we need to find out more facts about this situation then we can make intelligent
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:57.420]  decisions later and you and I can have more intelligent conversation about what to do
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:05.660]  about it all right incredible this is the Democratic Party openly run by foreign banks
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:12.180]  with George Soros this fossilized Nazi collaborator running around openly funding groups that
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:17.900]  go out and promote shooting police in the back four dead cops was better than that five dead
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:27.620]  cops that at all on video this is a true insurrection that's why CNN says Trump's a national emergency
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:32.500]  no you're the national emergency trying to destabilize things and then here's a Democratic
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:40.220]  congressman coming out saying this is Elliott Engel of New York saying I only know what
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:44.860]  I'm reading in the newspapers well I mean the New York Times and the Washington Post
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:49.580]  had to retract last week that their original report about the alt-right being run by the
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:55.740]  Russians was a total lie but they did it two weeks after they'd already been pushing it
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:01.980]  no proof that bots were pushing info wars are Breitbart the bots are blocking us on
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:06.180]  Facebook and Twitter and we're daring the election as well let's go out to break with
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:10.540]  this ask you about that because you're a ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:16.540]  did you hear from intelligence sources that Russia's intent was to put Donald Trump in
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:22.220]  the White House I haven't heard from intelligence sources I only know what what I'm reading
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:27.700]  in the newspapers with intelligence sources have not contacted the members of Congress
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:33.420]  I'm calling on the intelligence sources to brief the members of Congress now let's stop
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:36.900]  right there briefing as to what I'm going to come back and play this again you know
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:41.260]  why this is so important I'm explain this again I know real people that are currently
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:46.540]  in the CIA I know former folks that were high up in it and all sorts of other agencies okay
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:51.580]  I call them they say this is not the CIA just like Trump has come out and said it's pure
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:57.020]  bold okay they say it's some little subgroup that Obama interviewed they put this out
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:03.300]  it turns out that's the truth a former Icelandic minister of interior is claiming that the
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:09.980]  US sent FBI agents to frame Julian Assange during a goodwill mission to Iceland in 2011
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:14.380]  now this troubling report has come to light and it's reviewing how the Obama administration
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:19.620]  the links that it will go to to a framed Julian Assange the minister says the US sent quote
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:25.140]  a plain load of FBI agents to Iceland in June of 2011 to both frame WikiLeaks and Assange
[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:29.260]  according to this minister to refuse them any cooperation and ask them to leave the
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:34.140]  country immediately he claims that the Obama administration implied to Iceland officials
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:37.660]  that they had knowledge of quote hackers wanting to destroy software systems in the
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:43.060]  country and offered help the interior minister mr. Johansson said he became suspicious of
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:47.980]  the US good intentions and said quote where where the helping hand might easily become
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:52.620]  a manipulating hand it looks like our ulterior motives were exposed all in an attempt to
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:59.620]  frame Julian Assange I'm Margaret howl reporting for info wars dot com

[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:50.260]  and well this day of the night is going to pop in at the bottom of the hour on his concerns
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:54.340]  of some of the appointments that that trumps attempting to make to see if they can get
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:09:02.260]  confirmed from Rex Tillerson to also rick perry supposedly to head up energy we've got
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:06.980]  this former marine court general kelly who headed up montanamo bay all I care about
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:11.580]  is they follow trumps orders we're going to see if trump delivers on jobs delivers on
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:15.860]  controlling the border delivers on pulling us out of naft and get and renegotiating these
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:20.860]  to be fair americanism not globalism if he deviates then I'm going to have some big issues
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:25.140]  but I said what what do you think we should do today but just under the break and he goes
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:31.300]  we need the constituents of trump to basically let him hear from us so he's not just surrounded
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:36.140]  by washington insiders and that certainly is important we should stay very engaged with
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:42.020]  trump and his people via twitter via facebook via letters via phone calls you mail letters
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:46.140]  to trump tower donald trump he stays up till two in the morning a lot of times reading
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:50.100]  hundreds of them a day in fact sometimes people say don't tell people to write him letters
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:56.060]  he reads them all I love trying to read the letters you send me and I'm very honored to
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:10:01.620]  see them little handwritten things from kids you name it but trump really reads the letters
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:06.580]  so that's something else you can do but listen I saw darin de brian one of our reporters
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:10.700]  and one of our great graphics people just go and I can't believe it walking down the
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:15.260]  hall he didn't see I was there and I said what's wrong he goes every TV in this place
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:19.980]  is Trump's a russian agent overthrow the election overturn the election they're making their
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:25.340]  move they played possum they tried to have the recount that should more votes went to
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:28.820]  trump then went to hillary you know he gets a couple hundred thousand in the state she
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:32.740]  gets three thousand oh look here's three thousand she didn't get that we're wrong oh there's
[01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:38.100]  two hundred thousand you know in in Wisconsin that we were supposed to go to him same thing
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:42.700]  in other states and now there's nothing in the news about the recount because it's so
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:48.380]  embarrassing and a judge has shot down jillstein for a pennsylvania recount I say go ahead
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:52.460]  you want to spend your money for it but the point is he didn't get what they wanted they
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:59.980]  want to try to delegitimize trump so now they're going with the russia agent angle and notice
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:05.780]  on a play this clip and go to our guest you have this congressman elliott engel democrat
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:11.140]  from new york and they've got him on cnn they're saying so you've heard from the 17 agencies
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:15.700]  just like a year ago just like six months ago just like two and a half weeks ago it
[01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:22.460]  was the washington post new york times absolute proof from the cia back then it was 15 other
[01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:26.500]  agencies now it's 17 I guess they're just adding new ones every day because they just
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:31.180]  did just create a new one sunday that oversees the news and engages in quote propaganda against
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:37.460]  us they came out and they said well where is it you know hey I guess you've met with
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:41.980]  them they you know all I know is what I read the papers because Obama has some handpicked
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:47.460]  little special office just like bush did to claim wmds in iraq and that's who's supposedly
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:52.100]  telling him the russians had the capability to hack and john bolton the former ambassador
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:57.100]  of the un from the us comes out and says this looks like an obama false flag because there's
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:04.820]  no evidence but listen think about this the cia famous for overturning elections and manipulating
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:08.940]  him the enemy of donald trump he said he doesn't know what briefings from them because he can't
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:13.100]  trust him then harry reid comes out and says yeah that's true we were going to give him
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:19.940]  fake reports basically trumps getting it from booze allen every day that's bigger than the
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:25.620]  cia basically that that is who shares all the intelligence is the private contractor groups
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:32.860]  that's where that's where snowden came from so I had all the agency info fused together
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:35.980]  so everything's a lie about trump he's not getting briefings yes he is there's gonna be
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:40.140]  a terror attack it's gonna be his fault he took credit for japan announcing 50 billion
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:44.140]  investment here because the head of the company said in a press conference he was did it because
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:50.260]  of trump everything he does they spent so here's that clip of the congressman saying
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:53.980]  no we haven't been given this intel by the cia we've been given it by the media here
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:57.660]  it is let me let me ask you about that because you're a ranking member of the house foreign
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:04.060]  affairs committee did you hear from intelligence sources that russia's intent was to put donald
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:09.660]  trump in the white house I haven't heard from intelligence sources I only know what what
[01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:14.380]  I'm reading in the in the newspapers with intelligence sources have not contacted the
[01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:20.980]  members of congress I'm calling on the intelligence sources to brief the members of congress to
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:25.180]  give us a thorough briefing as to what they know and why they came to the conclusion they
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:29.660]  came with and I'm also calling on the house to hold hearings I'm the ranking member of
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:33.460]  the foreign affairs committee I think it's appropriate if we know that's enough from
[01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:37.940]  other committees full clips on info wars.com so what we learned from that they're planning
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:42.500]  big show trial hearings to make trump look like the ruski agent try to discredit him
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:47.060]  and probably impeach him even if they can't unseat him before he gets in so in a race
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:50.940]  to get him in to get the prosperity going so america is so happy they don't go along
[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:56.220]  with this but they're not going to go this far and stop they're clearly looking at assassinating
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:14:00.860]  trump and the orders would basically come down from this current sitting president
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:05.100]  and say well there's evidence he's a russian agent taking him out and they'd find a team
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:10.780]  to try to do it so this is an incredibly dangerous time now I hate agreeing with bolton and suddenly
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:14.620]  previous and suddenly newt gandridge because I've been used to disagreeing with them so often but
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:19.900]  they've been telling the truth lately gandridge has come out and said the new york times is fake news
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:27.660]  well they are fake news so understand this is the same group that gave us cia reports on yellow cake
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:35.180]  on anthrax in iraq on niger it's all lies but again the bigger issue is the national emergency
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:43.500]  they're creating the fact they're trying to get delegates to not go uh as electors and put trump
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:47.740]  in at the electoral college this is an incredible time to be alive and i'm here to tell you
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:55.740]  you we are not out of the woods i think we're in more danger now than even before the election
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:59.580]  because they arrogantly thought they could steal it now michael schneider's with the economic
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:04.140]  collapse blog speaking of economic collapse they want to raise interest rates right now
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:09.180]  to basically dampen the the trump recovery that you're seeing i mean they can do that any week
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:13.980]  now so let me tell you folks they're out to get us so uh michael schneider joins us to cover the
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:18.380]  waterfront for the rest of the hour great to have you back my friend it's great to be with
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:22.860]  you alex thank you for having me on today the original reason i said please get michael schneider
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:27.500]  on last week as you wrote this article uh linking to and we'll talk about this before you leave us
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:31.020]  in the hour but first i'll let the trump stuff proof that the elite really do want a global
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:35.820]  society with no possessions no privacy and no freedom and the first exhibit you link to is what
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:41.420]  they link to world economic forum calling for world government welcome to 2030 i own nothing
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:46.940]  have no privacy and life's never been better so this is amazing now you wrote last week
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:51.900]  about a secret agenda are they planning to use russian interference as an excuse to invalidate
[01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:57.340]  trump's election victory clearly they're now doing that in a breathless way so let's cover the
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:02.460]  waterfront you've heard my analysis do you agree with it what do you have to add i mean my heart
[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:09.260]  is beating pretty fast right now i agree with you 100 alex this is a major emergency because
[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:13.500]  the establishment wasn't just going to roll over and die just because donald trump won the election
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:17.820]  and i think they've been groping and searching for a way to go after him and now they've settled
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:23.260]  on this russian angle and it's no accident in politics nothing happens by accident and it's
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:28.620]  no accident that all of a sudden barack obama hillary clinton u.s senators the mainstream
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:33.900]  media every news outlet all at once came out with this angle saying the election was not legitimate
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:38.940]  because russia helped donald trump win the election of course they offer no proof just the cia
[01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:43.740]  a thing but but alex you already mentioned the electoral college which is just in one week the
[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:47.820]  electoral college is going to vote we already know that there's at least some electors that are
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:52.700]  supposed to vote for trump that are not going to vote for him but it's not over on december 19th
[01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:59.820]  because what happens subsequently people forget january 6th that a joint session of congress
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:06.220]  gathers to count the electoral votes and most of the time that's a formality but objections can
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:12.780]  be raised to electoral votes at that time now the last time this happened was in 2005 the second
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:18.940]  bush election and and it you know it's it's never really been a serious matter throughout our history
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:24.220]  but it's a possibility what has to happen is that when the electoral votes are counted
[01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:30.940]  what at least one representative and one senator has to file an objection in writing and if that
[01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:35.900]  happens then the votes that are objected to whether it's one vote whether it's all of them
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:41.340]  have to be voted on by the house and by the senate and the and any votes that they vote
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:47.340]  that the objection is upheld are not counted and i got this from the official website of
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:53.500]  the house of representatives house.gov and which they say that any votes that are objected to and
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:59.580]  the congress passes that objection they're not counted toward the the vote total for that individual
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:04.460]  that's right that's official that's the law so won't go to hillary but it'll go against trump
[01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:11.180]  so if he loses enough she wins yeah so or theoretically they could invalidate all the votes
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:14.940]  in which case what do we have to have another election who knows what what it is which is
[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:22.780]  what the cia is now calling for yeah openly on cnn and xcia agents are openly counted
[01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:26.700]  openly calling for a new vote so this is extremely dangerous situation because we've
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:32.620]  already on sunday we had four us senators come out two of them were republicans john mccain
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:37.260]  and lindsey graham of course are openly they hate trump they can't stand trump and they're
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:41.340]  openly saying hey we've got to investigate this we've got to get to the bottom of this right away
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:48.140]  we've got 10 us electors members of the electoral college led by the daughter of nancy polosi
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:54.620]  that are calling on the us intelligence community to brief electors about this russian situation
[01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:59.980]  so that you know i think they want to use this to potentially steal the election from trump
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:05.420]  but even if we get through december 19th electoral college january 6th the counting of the votes
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:10.380]  even if we get through that they could potentially take this to court in fact on the huffington post
[01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:15.820]  they're already touting this court decision from 1995 in which one candidate won but then
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:21.420]  there was massive fraud found and then the election was given to the of the losing candidate
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:26.540]  just handed over by the court um and that was for you know a congressional seat but they're
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:31.900]  saying this could be used to actually hand the election over to hillary through the courts
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:36.780]  so there's several different avenues they could take with this potentially impeaching as you said
[01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:41.900]  even after trump is elected but i think you know they're making this a big thing they're
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:46.860]  calling it a national emergency because i think they want to use this to go after trump to deny
[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:55.420]  him the presidency if they can michael schneider here's my bottom line and this is what i've decided
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:20:03.980]  to do with my audience and with my main focus i'm going to really just publicly call for
[01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:09.180]  trump to take the gloves off and to come out and excrete these criminals and then the minute he gets
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:13.900]  into office the gloves have to come off brass nickels have to go on and we have to go ahead
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:18.380]  move forward with ran juries for what's in the wiki leagues and all the crimes and we have to start
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:23.020]  indicted these people because they're never going to stop these are these are loose terrorists
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:27.820]  these are globalists in the country hell bent on getting our guns hell bent on bankrupting us
[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:32.140]  hell bent on ruining our health care system in their own documents making us helpless making
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:37.100]  us desperate making us poor that's in the wiki leagues and everybody from gruber right through
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:41.660]  to hillary obama all of them obama ordering the borders wide open and they're trying to keep it
[01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:48.220]  secret uh that is sedition uh that is true treason against this country uh and i'm sorry i'm not
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:53.100]  an indicted person they're never going to back off they're never going to give up they're talking
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:58.380]  about going into insurrection terror mode in major newspapers saying it's time to burn things down
[01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:03.180]  and blow things up and the media just sits there and the secret services sits there we have to
[01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:08.700]  start removing this enemy force i have met them i know them i've seen them they say we are for
[01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:14.220]  global government we are against the family we are here we will assimilate you they are a cult
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:20.140]  they're never backing down and trump has to run them over yeah trump better be ready for the fight
[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:24.140]  of his life because just because he won the election that's not the end of the war that's
[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:28.940]  the beginning of the war because now the elite are in full blown panic mode and total offense is
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:33.740]  the only way that's what gets these rats running not playing games with them like they're actually
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:38.940]  having a dialogue there is no dialogue with these rats they have a total criminal will
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:44.700]  to dominate and enslave everyone they want no competition they hate everyone people must
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:50.620]  wrap their minds around the criminal energy of the globalist yeah and now the other angles they
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:56.300]  tried during the election didn't work so now it's the new mccarthyism now it's oh russia everyone's
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:00.620]  a russian agent they they're they're blaming isn't it funny it's the leftist that have hundreds of
[01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:05.100]  movies about oh they were blacklisted and they couldn't do this and that these were admitted
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:09.980]  communists that wanted to overthrow america and put conservatives in forced labor camps
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:13.900]  and there was censorship in hollywood and i'm against it but if you're a russian i'm against
[01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:18.700]  the censorship you got proof somebody's an agent arrest their ass don't don't do some half measure
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:23.340]  but instead the very people that talk about blacklist all day are rubbing their hands together to
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:31.820]  shut us up oh absolutely alex and um people in congress the donald trump he's got some allies
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:35.980]  but even members of his own party hate him there's members of the senate that hate him
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:40.860]  members of the house that hate him so if it actually came down to a vote on january 6th
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:45.180]  if if they blew this thing up and where they're saying okay we've got to object to the vote
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:50.540]  with donald trump with the republican party automatically uh support donald trump or would
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:55.820]  there be enough votes joining with the democrats in the senate and the house to invalidate his
[01:22:55.820 --> 01:23:00.460]  electoral votes and block him from becoming president i think this is a big thing people
[01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:05.500]  need to start focusing on that if we get through december 19th electoral college which is an open
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:10.380]  question because they're being openly lobbied i mean the the the left the radical left they're
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:15.660]  going gangbusters they're they want to do whatever they can people like michael morris correctly saying
[01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:19.820]  donald trump has not been elected yet because the next president in the united states is actually
[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:24.540]  not elected until december exactly you stole my thunder michael morris loves to look like he's
[01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:28.780]  smart no he's being given the inside intel he said watch trumps probably not going to get in
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:35.820]  something big is going to happen before the election we're seeing it we are seeing it and and so uh
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:40.940]  you know people need to be aware of what's going on because uh you know december 19th january 6th
[01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:45.820]  if we can get to january 20th and trump is successfully inaugurated and obama actually
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:50.140]  does hand over power to donald trump maybe we can breathe a little bit easier although they'll
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:54.860]  still come after trump every way they can every angle they can looking to impeach him looking
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:59.580]  to go after him however they can because it's not just the republicans versus the democrats
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:05.100]  it's the globalist it's the establishment versus trump and his few allies in congress so he's going
[01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:09.420]  to be fighting an uphill battle every step of the way but look at this article from yesterday from
[01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:15.340]  zero hedge senate quietly passes the countering disinformation and propaganda act so the state
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:21.420]  department cia can quote engage in propaganda and disinformation and actually funds it against the
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:27.900]  american people hr 5181 and the republicans help pass this and then trump is totally mute on it i'm
[01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:35.180]  told he isn't even aware of this he's busy making hundreds of calls a day to get jobs back so while
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:40.380]  he's doing that because he believes hey you're elected president you're president he still doesn't
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:45.900]  get how criminal they are yeah alex in the establishment you know they're trying they're
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:49.820]  trying to figure out what happened in this most recent election and so you know of course they
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:55.900]  want to deal with trump but they're they're also realizing that the alternative media is a major
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:25:00.780]  major threat to them they've totally woken up to this and so this list this organization proper
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:04.380]  not that the washington post came out and said hey look at all these sites that are russian
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:09.740]  propaganda info wars dot com was on the list but was so was two of my websites the economic collapse
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:14.860]  blog and end of the americans dream dot com were two of the two two hundred or so and by the way
[01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:19.660]  your articles are great because there might be five pages long there might be 25 hyperlinks
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:24.940]  mainly to video clips and mainstream news that's why they hate you so much is that they'll bury
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:28.620]  some really important thing in some innocuous article you'll actually go link to it kind of like
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:33.740]  the guardian buried it that this top ambassador was saying he met with the real leaker it's us
[01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:39.260]  intelligence that was buried in an article that didn't even have that in the headline yeah and so
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:44.540]  they're calling me a russian agent which is absolutely insane and i've written tons of
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:49.900]  articles about what a threat russia is and and articles against russia but they're calling me
[01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:55.100]  a russian agent just because i was pro trump just because i was attacking hillary clinton during
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:59.900]  the campaign trying to get trump elected and so they're coming after people like me people like
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:04.780]  you alex all the alternative media and they've got to shut us down so they're calling us russian
[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:10.700]  agents they're calling us fake news that they're they've taken the gloves off they're coming after
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:16.380]  us they they are the clear and present danger and here's what viewers have to understand clearly
[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:22.380]  they're moving to shut down free speech they're moving to try to unseat trump and notice they
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:28.780]  knew there was total fervor america was awake a month ago when trump had just won then they began
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:34.700]  the drumbeat of recounts then they began the drumbeat of the electors because that's falling apart
[01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:39.580]  now it's the number one story he's a russian operative we're all russian operatives doesn't
[01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:43.900]  matter of all that's already been discredited and retracted they're back with it again a secret
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:51.980]  report nobody can see congressional hearings on and on and on to again destabilize the country
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:56.780]  further and they're doing it during christmas when they know you're busy buying presents and
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:01.980]  working extra hours getting ready for the holiday and you know buying a ham or a turkey or visiting
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:06.700]  grandma at the nursing home or trying to go deer hunting with your son they know you're trying to
[01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:11.420]  have a life you worked real hard all year you want a week or so off and they're not going to let you
[01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:16.540]  have that they're going to tell you you're not americana you didn't vote to change things you can't
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:22.940]  have an american dream you can't make america great again the communist chinese said ha ha ha
[01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:26.700]  you'll never be as great as you were officially in their people's daily two weeks ago and you
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:32.700]  can't have trump he's not an american new yorker success story he's a russian i mean just think
[01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:37.900]  about how insane this is then meanwhile communist china was given our deepwater ports the panaman
[01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:44.220]  canal almost all the rare earth minerals almost all our jobs and has screw job taxes 15 lower than
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:48.940]  ours and all we're saying is we're going to equalize that and already all the money's flooding in
[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:52.940]  and that's their problem michael schinder i'm going to talk about that with you the good side of
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:57.420]  the balance the you know the bad side is they're crazy they're going for broke they're not going
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:01.580]  to stop even if they lose there they're going to try to kill him now again there's there's you know
[01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:06.540]  there's angels in this world too not just demons so so i think we're still winning but if the battle
[01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:10.700]  is hot it's real it's more important than ever they're doing this because they think people
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:15.500]  have gone back to sleep it's why they played possum for a couple weeks but i told people my gut told me
[01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:22.060]  that that that that it's a miracle if he gets in okay i'm telling you i'm telling you it's a
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:28.140]  miracle if he gets in it's a total emergency but the good news is the good news is irrevocable
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:32.860]  damage to the globalist people are awake exciting things are happening and he's already brought back
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:38.780]  so many jobs and already spending's up for christmas restaurants that were you know empty or almost
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:44.780]  full now or full the trump effect is is is happening we got about a minute to break but
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:51.020]  your view on that yeah and the new survey just came out that showed that optimism about the
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:56.460]  u.s economy is the highest that has been since 2008 when obama was first elected a trillion
[01:28:56.460 --> 01:29:02.300]  dollars has been out of the stock market in 30 days yeah the stock market is setting a new high
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:08.060]  after record high day after day the u.s dollar has surged to levels that we haven't seen in many many
[01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:12.700]  years so and we're seeing jobs come back we're seeing optimism you know whether before the
[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:18.060]  election about it was a 16 percent of republicans were optimistic about the future of the economy now
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:24.140]  it's 74 percent so just in 30 days we've seen a tremendous tremendous shift in terms of how
[01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:29.500]  americans are viewing and that's why the globalists are panicking folks mexico and nigerian places
[01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:33.980]  could be incredibly beautiful wonderful rich places their elites made decisions this is on
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:39.100]  record to keep people poor it's a management system the globalists want that here we're trying to
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:45.420]  break their will they're trying to break ours so we've got to re-intensify our efforts you've
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:50.540]  seen that we can win now we got to go to the next level but you got to ask god for guidance stay with
[01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:55.660]  us fires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:05.660]  why is the cia pushing this ridiculous conspiracy theory reports of russian officials intervening
[01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:11.580]  and the american presidential election have been industriously circulated for months the fbi dhs and
[01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:16.060]  the office of the director of national intelligence are all looking at the same allegations and all
[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:20.700]  of the agencies came up with the same foregone conclusion flatamir putin's government deliberately
[01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:25.820]  interfered with america's presidential election the laughable insinuation was reiterated this morning
[01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:30.380]  in an article published in the hill attacking president elect donald trump for casting doubt
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:34.700]  on their assessment concluding that russia intervened in the election to help him win the white house
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:39.420]  trump tweeted out can you imagine if the election results were opposite and we tried to play the
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:45.020]  russia cia card keep in mind this is the same cia that asserted false claims against adam hussain
[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:49.580]  and led us into the invasion of iraq with a track record like that one must take their assessments

[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:25.340]  i intellectually analyze things very calmly very coldly friends family neighbors have always
[01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:29.260]  noticed that they say once you get on air you have so much energy you start hyperventilating
[01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:35.020]  you get upset because after i've already done the analysis then i'm up here just as a primitive
[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:40.140]  instinct and i start getting animated and try to get the tribe motivated and it's not a manipulation
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:46.700]  i feel like i'm dying up here sometimes i'm so angry at myself that i can't find the words
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:52.460]  to describe how serious this is now trump is delivering big time on his policies
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:57.900]  he's got cars introducing bills for nationwide concealed carry where if you get it one state
[01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:04.220]  is nationwide they also want bills he's pushing legislatures to just have open carry he's bringing
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:09.980]  jobs back he's doing so many big things he's battling globalism he's exposing one-sided trade
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:18.060]  deals he's exposing monopolies like the one bezos has with amazon but he's appointing some
[01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:23.500]  big establishment insiders some outsiders but also kind of outliers in the establishment like
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:27.340]  rex tellison so we're going to discuss this some with david night here a little bit in the next
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:31.980]  hour wane madson joins us but but here's the key at what i'm really getting at and of course
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:39.340]  riding shotguns also michael snider you can see the elite hate trump this is real they're damaging
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:43.740]  themselves irrevocably with the stuff they're pulling and they're openly pushing foreign to
[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:48.220]  be killed in hundreds of newspapers and magazines i mean it's you see it every day it's every major
[01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:52.700]  publication has writers saying it's time to kill trump or i want to kill trump and they're not getting
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:59.180]  in trouble movie stars directors foreign leaders are saying kill trump he's not the nominee now
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:05.580]  he's the president elect and i know people that have known trump for 40 years they say no he's an
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:10.140]  anti-new world order guy he was just waiting you know buying his time night did his research found
[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:15.420]  where he fought naftan gat globalism and tpp and you know did that so it's a mixed bag and and if
[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:19.900]  trump's anything he's pigheaded he's his own man these guys don't like him because he wants to actually
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:25.180]  run stuff not them let's just hope he really gets enough influence from us to get us on the right
[01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:30.780]  track which is prosperity number one that defeats globalism they want us to be austere to control us
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:36.780]  but i want to get um our guest take on that because only with us till the end of the hour and then
[01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:40.060]  we'll continue with david in the shower but also to the next hour but david's over there after a

[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:38.700]  but i'm here to tell you i'm going to cut a video today where i just summon all my energy
[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:44.620]  and i'm going to reach out to donald trump it's the best way is publicly and say you must take
[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:50.380]  the gloves off just like in the after you lost the first debate you must get aggressive you must
[01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:55.260]  take it to her you got to take it to them now because they're trying to bring you down they're
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:59.900]  trying to bring us down they're trying to overthrow this election and we're all on the defensive
[01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:05.660]  acting like they have a right to do something like this they had a recount it blew up in their
[01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:10.060]  face now they're getting electors to say we're not going to honor the vote this is just like in
[01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:14.860]  the nomination process they're the ones that have the explaining to do they're the ones that are
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:21.740]  working for foreign banks and foreign countries i want soros investigated not the american people
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:26.540]  claiming i'm they say tucker carlson's a russian agent michael schneider at economic labs blog
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:31.740]  dot com what did you did you see that clip last thursday where they had a democratic congressman on
[01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:37.900]  to openly say to his face you're a russian agent i did see that clip alex and and like
[01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:42.060]  i said it's the new mccarthyism they're pointing at anyone they're even pointing at you they're
[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:46.940]  pointing at me saying we're all russian agents we're all fake news we've all got to be shut down
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:52.460]  because they they've determined that we're a major threat to them and now and donald trump you know
[01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:57.580]  even if he is able to successfully become president people need to realize his enemies are not just
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:02.940]  the democrats but there are many among the republicans in the senate and in the house of representatives
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:08.380]  that will gladly stab a knife in his back yeah they just passed a bill to go after breitbarton
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:12.940]  info wars in your site and everybody else's and and and daily caller they just signed the
[01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:19.580]  bill to come after us yes the republicans passed this yeah absolutely because the republicans
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:25.500]  you know the other party at this point if the establishment could they would like anybody
[01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:30.060]  to get in rather than trump it's not just about hillary clinton if they could have a republican
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:34.700]  replace trump and get into the white house they would in fact there is a plot among the electors
[01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:40.620]  there's a move to try to agree on a compromise candidate a compromise republican candidate
[01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:45.100]  that they would throw votes that are supposed to go to trump supposed to go to clinton the word is
[01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:50.860]  paul ryan yeah potentially paul ryan but they were talking about john casick but john casick
[01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:55.420]  said i don't want your votes and i have a feeling they could potentially even settle on a republican
[01:40:55.420 --> 01:41:01.340]  woman we'll see what it is but there's this plot if they can get at least 37 votes that are supposed
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:06.620]  to go to trump to go to someone else well then it gets thrown into the house of representatives
[01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:12.300]  i've got to give it to him i've got to give it to him and nobody's analysis is more on on spot but
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:18.060]  also not just on target but so wide ranging this guy is always up to the minute you know sider we
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:22.380]  all talk about having you do a daily hour show i'm thinking about night doing a daily show
[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:26.060]  no other people but i got to get more crew to do that first that's why it's important people
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:30.380]  support info wars because you are just such a brain stay there and ride shotgun with us
[01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:34.380]  david night i know you've been chomping in the bed on vacation for a week uh with your lovely
[01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:38.220]  wife so you certainly deserved it but before we get into the problems with trump i was just
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:43.420]  saying to you while he was talking we're fighting for our lives as a republic again i cannot come
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:51.020]  up with words to describe the incredible intrigue whether you're for trump or against trump or
[01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:55.820]  whatever that this country and world is now in i mean they just had bricks it and they said we
[01:41:55.820 --> 01:42:00.620]  don't care what your vote is we're staying and by the way we're creating an e you army if you try
[01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:06.700]  to leave this is so authoritarian and then meanwhile liberals run around and bitch at every
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:12.220]  conservative all day long that we somehow had a blacklist before i was born that persecuted
[01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:18.060]  some communist writers now they're openly saying shut us all down with big fat smiles on their
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:23.340]  faces yeah actually alec you know when we look at this and it's not being critical of trump and i
[01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:27.340]  want to talk about some of the good stuff that i saw because i was on vacation i didn't really
[01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:32.220]  respond to some of the good things that donald trump said but you know he had great picks
[01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:37.100]  for department of energy for epa for interior he had for epa he's got the guy who brags about
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:42.220]  the fact that he's a lead attorney in resisting overreaching epa regulation he's also against
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:46.460]  gen 21 yeah and when you look at the basically it's like alec shows or david night when you look
[01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:49.980]  at the interior department and of course that's where the bureau of land management these people
[01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:56.060]  who have been shutting down all these people who have been miners and loggers and ranchers and have
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:43:01.660]  had property rights removed from them that are just as real as the property rights to the land that
[01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:07.420]  your house sits upon and people can have multiple levels of property rights on public land that
[01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:11.980]  doesn't mean that they're claiming ownership of it but they do have as property rights say mining
[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:15.980]  rights or logging rights or water rights or whatever and these can all be happen at the same
[01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:21.420]  piece of land but to see somebody for interior department that alex her family came over as
[01:43:21.420 --> 01:43:27.820]  part of the oregon trail thing they're pioneers and then her family created a local stand there
[01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:35.020]  selling resources there in the pacific northwest she worked on a small family business sure trump
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:40.060]  putting somebody in that understands people on the land is a positive reversing the 30-year
[01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:45.420]  program to run people off public land when we look at that those are great we look at their
[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:49.500]  background we say that's a great deal now when he puts up somebody like rex tillerson i looked at it
[01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:53.340]  and i thought the optics were very bad i thought some of the things that in his past were very
[01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:57.420]  suspicious and and it's not to criticize trump because remember what the bible says you know
[01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:03.180]  that the wounds of a friend are faithful but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful okay so he's got
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:08.140]  all these people in washington that are coming to him the washington establishment and they're
[01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:12.620]  saying oh you know to get this person get that person if he doesn't hear from the voters who
[01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:17.100]  agree with his agenda who support him sure these people i've seen it happen with reagan i've seen
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:23.740]  it happen with steve john but is rex tillerson better than mit romney i don't know i don't know
[01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:28.460]  because i've seen him say things about carbon taxes well let me explain and you made the point
[01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:33.260]  earlier tillerson was the main funder exposing it was a fraud all the other oil companies were
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:38.460]  pushing it they tried to remove him in 2006 as the chairmanship he took exxon mobile which
[01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:42.860]  really is standard oil away from the Rockefellers and then he just kind of he was playing politics
[01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:49.820]  but he just did lip service well i know behind the scenes they were exposing it and so i guarantee
[01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:53.980]  you with trump he said no i'm against all this now if he gets in and goes for all that i'm going
[01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:57.820]  to get mighty angry but i get your point well you know when he went before the council in
[01:44:57.820 --> 01:45:01.900]  formulations when he testified before congress he was saying things like mocking the idea that we
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:06.540]  would have energy independence in the united states that's a core uh a core thing for donald
[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:10.140]  trump is to have energy independence he also said he thought a carbon tax was a way we would
[01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:16.380]  influence consumer decisions and i totally agree that it's 2007 he made a deal they they still
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:21.580]  tried to remove him he beat them but but he did join them at that point so i think this this has
[01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:26.060]  to be told well the other thing too is and we understand that all this stuff about russia
[01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:31.660]  is phony but if you get somebody announcing that he's going to go with somebody this is
[01:45:31.660 --> 01:45:37.340]  giving them ammunition to beat him about guys google google rex tillerson latimer putin yeah
[01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:41.820]  and it was him there in 2012 2013 and you've got marco rubio now saying well i'm not going to vote
[01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:47.260]  to confirm him all it takes is marco rubio and uh mccain who is already saying all the russians
[01:45:47.260 --> 01:45:51.820]  are coming the russians are coming and of course lindsey graham if just those three were to defect
[01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:55.820]  that would hand trump but i mean tillerson it drills all over europe all over africa all over
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:46:01.820]  latin america all over everywhere i mean again are we not supposed to deal with russia he's bad
[01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:06.380]  because he tried to get uh exxon into areas other people couldn't get into the drill i mean it's
[01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:11.900]  free market yeah absolutely but um i mean listen he's i mean if i let's say if i went to russia
[01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:16.540]  sightseeing or let's say i went to russia and in five years to do some organic food deal because
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:19.980]  they say that's going to be their big business if i went there to say sign a contract to buy
[01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:24.220]  say organic blueberries or something would i be a russian agent i did business with russians
[01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:27.980]  no i'm just saying that if you've got somebody who i mean i buy a lot of crap from china i buy
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:32.700]  nothing from russia i mean our listeners we go here's here you know here's a radio made in china
[01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:36.860]  that cost 20 bucks or the same radio made america that cost 80 they choose to buy the one made in
[01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:41.420]  china we sell some stuff made in china we try not to but because i'm buying shortwave radios from
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:46.460]  china does that mean i'm a i'm a chinese agent no i can't stand them no but if you've got somebody
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:51.180]  who has advocated for carbon taxes as a way to keep nations accountable the question is accountable
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:54.700]  to who no i hear you but i really want and you can get more in this next hour with main match
[01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:59.340]  but i'm going to get into the big front and center here what do you make of them trying to
[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:06.380]  overthrow the election i warned i warned trump i warned uh other people let's just say hi up i
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:12.300]  warned everybody uh well alex this is in the mix a year ago when drudge came here he knew that they
[01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:15.580]  were going to move against alternative if you want to call it alternative whatever the true
[01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:20.060]  oh yeah hillary said six months ago we're going to take out the alternative media once i get in
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:24.700]  that's right and she was already calling you out by name i don't think this is something that originated
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:30.220]  because donald trump won the election i think they have to now pull trump in and make him the
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:34.460]  brunt of this before they can move to us but i think this has been their plan i agree well why
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:38.940]  isn't anybody talking about hillary's uh leak of intelligence to the russians why isn't anybody
[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:44.780]  talking about how she corrupted the democrat elections that we now see as as being exposed by
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:49.100]  these leaks let me ask you that question and then back to michael schneider how do we get on
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:52.540]  let's go to schneider how do we get on the offense i mean she's the one in the emails
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:57.900]  hacking the election stealing things manipulating uh trump got a bunch of new votes and recounts
[01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:01.340]  he needs to get aggressive and say what david night was just saying he needs to i know he's
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:05.740]  trying to look magnanimous and presidential hey they're not acting like that they're a pack of rats
[01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:11.180]  at the gates and look i'm not an authoritarian these are anti-american foreign globalist i'm
[01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:16.780]  sick of the espionage i mean putin i'm not seeing his praises but he he he kicked out thousands of
[01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:20.940]  ngo's funded by soros of the state department trying to overthrow the russian government
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:25.420]  these foreign groups have no right to be here doing this and now they're claiming we're foreign
[01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:31.260]  assets when they're the foreign assets what do we do schneider yeah well first of all people need
[01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:36.540]  to wake up people have relaxed since donald trump was elected they think oh we won the war we can
[01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:40.940]  relax we don't need to prepare anymore we don't have to be involved in the information war things
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:47.100]  are going to be great now that trump is exactly to realize this is all out war and by the way by
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:51.180]  the way i'm not up here ringing the alarm bell because oh my gosh we had 85 million viewers
[01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:55.580]  the week of the election and now it's only 40 million i could care less i want to go on vacation
[01:48:55.580 --> 01:49:00.380]  i had a vacation set you know to do a bunch of rock climbing and mountaineering in early january
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:05.100]  i'm looking at canceling it in fact i just told him i canceled it i'm sick of this i'm tired of
[01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:10.300]  having to fight like this but i'm telling you we're in a maximum emergency it's worse than it was
[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:16.300]  five weeks ago sorry schneider go ahead yeah this has been the single most galvanizing moment for
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:20.460]  the establishment for the new world order that we've seen in generation so they're in full
[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:25.580]  blown panic mode they're declared all out war and they've got it's basically a scorched earth policy
[01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:30.620]  at this point david night was exactly correct they're going to start with donald trump scorched earth
[01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:36.540]  try to destroy him then they're coming for us because they think we put him in we were and so
[01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:40.700]  they're going to come after us with scorched earth policy david destroy us i want to get david's
[01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:45.340]  take on exactly and that's what i'm saying trump's gone sideways in a few areas he's delivering them
[01:49:45.340 --> 01:49:50.220]  in policy and rhetoric we'll see what happens all i'm saying is yeah we'll spend five percent of our
[01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:54.380]  time ten percent trying to keep his feet to the fire and watching but he we're all under attack
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:59.340]  now all i'm saying is all hands on deck we've got to get him in office then then we can deal with
[01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:04.780]  trump yeah if we go back to sleep now if we rest on our laurels and say okay trump got elected
[01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:09.500]  he knows what he's doing let's just let him handle all this stuff no the people who elected him
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:12.860]  have to get involved i think that's part of the genius i've never seen this before
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:17.500]  of donald trump going around doing victory tours he needs to keep the public engaged ronald reagan
[01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:20.940]  always said he was going to go over the heads of the congress and the heads of washington and go
[01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:25.740]  directly to the people donald trump is the one who's really done that's right and he's going to
[01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:29.820]  have to do that in order to get this finished and to govern he's going to have to go over the heads
[01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:35.500]  of the elite and folks let's face it it's not bragging info wars is the spearhead and we're
[01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:39.500]  not just the tip we're the spearhead with all the great guests and this whole family here

[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:39.660]  to talk more about solutions too but the answer is uh to be directly with trump uh via the media
[01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:44.140]  and privately as well and just and just saying they're coming after you my gut's never wrong
[01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:48.860]  and they're never going to make deals they're never going to back off they want this country

[01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:21.900]  david nice writing shotgun with us in the next hour michael thanks for letting us jump in and
[01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:27.820]  co-host with us other other issues you want to address uh other points i mean you obviously agree
[01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:33.420]  trump's got to get on the offense what else does he do well if i was in donald trump's position
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:38.140]  i'll tell you exactly what i would do if i was donald trump i would not appear in public until
[01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:44.540]  at least january 20th inauguration day because as you said you know him and his potentially his
[01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:50.860]  family are potentially in danger physically now i don't the new world order would prefer prefer to
[01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:55.820]  do this politically or legally if they can block him from becoming president but as i've always
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:59.500]  said they'll move heaven and earth to try to prevent him from becoming president once he
[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:03.420]  becomes president of course they'll try to do whatever they can to remove him so donald trump
[01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:09.340]  needs to realize that he is in danger this is a a critical moment in american history and the hopes
[01:56:09.340 --> 01:56:13.500]  and dreams of so many are centered on him because it's not just the white house as david night
[01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:18.860]  brought up earlier you know you've got the epa you've got the batf you've got all these agencies
[01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:24.460]  and the new world order advances their agenda and globalism is in trouble look at this look at
[01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:29.580]  the italians last week voting to stop e u expansion beautiful things are happening and what did the
[01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:34.220]  media say they're russian agents did you see the news where they're now merkel says russians are why
[01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:40.700]  she's losing oh yeah every everything is russia's fault all of a sudden but really it's the new world
[01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:45.660]  order that's freaking out because because donald trump unlike other republican presidents who come
[01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:50.700]  in and the game continues and the same people stay running the agencies and do advancing the
[01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:56.460]  new people in yeah he's going to clean house and all these agencies but those are the instruments
[01:56:56.460 --> 01:57:01.020]  that they use to impose their agenda on all of us because the people need to realize it's government
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:05.420]  agencies that are extremely powerful sure let me bring up one more point and it goes to your
[01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:10.220]  expertise economic class blog dot com i want to ask David this one come back obviously trump
[01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:13.900]  wants lower interest rates i always said raise them moderately because i've talked a lot of
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:18.140]  different economists you want to be in between but clearly dana we do dana we don't with qe
[01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:23.980]  unlimited they're talking about big rate increases now admittedly to stall him and make it look like
[01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:28.300]  it's his fault do you think that'll work or what do you think's happening there oh yeah you know the
[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:33.020]  federal reserve is already saying well we've got to raise interest rates in december we have no choice
[01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:37.660]  while they've had it on hold all this time because they want to help hillary get in so they didn't
[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:42.460]  raise interest rates throughout the entire year now they say we have to raise rates are never
[01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:45.740]  raise them in december they always do it in january of february that's that's unprecedented right
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:50.220]  david oh absolutely and that's what they want to do they want to slow down the economy just as
[01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:54.140]  they wanted to pump it up for obama and hillary as you all know and and people said that from the
[01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:58.700]  very beginning about the trump knows that he's battling to get us job yeah it's a political
[01:57:58.700 --> 01:58:03.580]  organization and they feather their own nest and then they reward their friends and punish their

[02:00:40.140 --> 02:00:46.860]  to finish up other points that you're focused on yeah alex so well let's talk about the other
[02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:52.140]  article you wanted you mentioned earlier in the show where a member of the parliament in denmark
[02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:57.180]  aida auken you know basically a member of the lead the lead are telling us exactly what they plan
[02:00:57.180 --> 02:01:01.580]  to do if we allow them to do it well she wrote an article which appeared on the web's official
[02:01:01.580 --> 02:01:06.540]  website of the world economic forum basically saying what life would be like she envisions how
[02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:12.300]  what life would be like in 2030 only 14 years from now and in the article she says oh i don't have any
[02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:18.380]  possessions i don't own a car i don't own a house i don't own any appliances i don't own any clothes
[02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:23.500]  i don't have any possessions at all but everything is provided for me by the central government i live
[02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:28.380]  in a planned economy she doesn't have photos of her grandmother there on the cloud they can be watched
[02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:34.060]  she says her own mind is hooked into the matrix she's controlled it's so wonderful in fact since
[02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:38.780]  you mentioned this let's have you back up this is an evergreen story next week for a full hour on
[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:43.580]  this but but but keep going yeah and basically saying oh i don't have any possessions i don't
[02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:49.340]  have any privacy but in the article she says oh but i've never been happier and she says oh in the
[02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:55.020]  future the people aren't going to have to work it all be done by robots and computers and artificial
[02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:59.980]  intelligence and then if you want something you just order it and it's delivered to you and scroll
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:04.860]  down this woman looks like a total cult member but but understand she's the upper class technocrat
[02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:09.980]  so she'll be controlling you so she's all for it it's nothing but socialism with a thin veneer
[02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:15.580]  of technology scroll down let's i mean show how crazy this woman looks please continue yeah and
[02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:20.940]  it's it's basically the equivalent of a member of a member of our congress saying this you know so
[02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:26.300]  this is somebody that has real political power in denmark but she's saying that basically she
[02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:32.220]  envisions a world of planned cities where we're tightly in very tight communities where we all
[02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:36.620]  use public and all she's saying is the public globalist plan it's not like she's the presenter
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:42.220]  oh yeah she didn't dream this up but this is what they they want and that they believe that they
[02:02:42.220 --> 02:02:47.580]  can create kind of this socialist utopia where everything is preplanned and where you know when
[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:53.340]  you graduate high school or college your job assignment your job is assigned to you because
[02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:59.180]  everything is planned everything is controlled and and and it's a great green society and they push it
[02:02:59.180 --> 02:03:03.900]  as as grassroots with a zeitgeist movement supported by the un and the new york times
[02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:08.780]  and the head of that movement said that i would be putting a reeducation camp yeah because those
[02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:12.380]  that don't agree that try to rebel against the system well they're the problem they need to be
[02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:17.580]  reeducated they need to be controlled they need to be put away whatever because they want this
[02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:22.300]  wonderful she says we'll just be put into zones which i told her by that movie or that series of
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:27.500]  books returning to movies uh you know the whole mocking jay and the rest of it hunger games is
[02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:33.980]  the real globalist plan and she says we'll be wild feral humans in her article mm-hmm yeah because
[02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:39.500]  they see us as a people who actually want liberty and freedom as a lower class of humanity but they're
[02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:44.540]  going to evolve and they're going to you know have this wonderful socialist dream and they're
[02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:49.420]  going to you know and it feeds into transhumanism humans being connected with technology and robots
[02:03:49.420 --> 02:03:54.060]  and computers and everything else become a different class of human more evolved into this
[02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:58.060]  wonderful new world order and those that don't want to participate well they're going to be
[02:03:58.060 --> 02:04:02.940]  you know put outside the city put in zones reeducated whatever you want to say it but she's
[02:04:02.940 --> 02:04:10.140]  just expressing what the global elite have wanted for decades but she she's saying hey we could have
[02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:16.940]  this by 2030 if the public will allow us to proceed toward this wonderful incredible and they call us
[02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:21.820]  fake news when we do what the mainstream media won't do we go to the world economic forum website
[02:04:21.820 --> 02:04:26.620]  and it's a freaking nightmare you know you go on there it's like we want 100 trillion and new taxes
[02:04:26.620 --> 02:04:32.620]  paid to private banks every decade we want to run your life your kids don't belong to you we need
[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:38.060]  al-qaeda that was one headline from the foreign affairs cfr al-qaeda is good we need them i mean

[02:05:09.980 --> 02:05:14.860]  troubling report has come to light in its reviewing how the obama administration the links that it

[02:08:19.420 --> 02:08:22.540]  wane madson former of the national security agency is one of the top
[02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:28.140]  writers when it comes to cyber security espionage you name it he just so much stuff he talks about
[02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:32.300]  when i was first interviewing him 20 years ago i just i just couldn't believe it like
[02:08:32.300 --> 02:08:37.180]  cell phones are tracking you they're triangulating that all came out later how they use keyword
[02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:41.260]  software he was the first guy i heard about a year ago when these wikileys were coming out saying
[02:08:41.260 --> 02:08:46.700]  this isn't russians this is american now william benny has gone so far on this show is to say it is
[02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:51.500]  and i said you know who and he said look you don't want to get swat team let's not talk any further
[02:08:51.500 --> 02:08:55.900]  now we have the uh high level british ambassador coming out one of the guardians saying look
[02:08:55.900 --> 02:09:01.980]  he said this months ago he said look i've been in dc i've met with the leaker it's high level
[02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:07.180]  it's us intelligence it's a leak not a hack it's the chinese that don't have to break into stuff the
[02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:12.940]  russians are very very small in their numbers compared to the chinese and he just went over
[02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:19.020]  the facts that's up on info wars dot com but separate from this i've never seen such authoritarianism
[02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:24.780]  i mean it's surreal to have hillary demonize me call me dark heart obama attacked me but to have
[02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:32.620]  vice news yesterday on hbo attacked me with the president to have mpr last week but basically
[02:09:32.620 --> 02:09:37.180]  every hour now it's it's settled down some i mean we're talking thousands of newspapers last week
[02:09:37.180 --> 02:09:42.700]  hundreds a day with fake quotes i'd say hillary is responsible for thousands and thousands of
[02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:47.260]  children being murdered and chopped up and sold to sex slavery and raped they edited it together
[02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:50.700]  and had me saying they were doing at the bottom of a pizza place
[02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:58.860]  and then cut out where i said syria now ladies and gentlemen this is going to next level and
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:03.020]  by the way i did talk about podesta and these codes but this is what this is how they discredit
[02:10:03.020 --> 02:10:10.300]  and they don't care anymore so so again some fools out there go oh great you know alex jones i'm not
[02:10:10.300 --> 02:10:15.820]  in trouble this is all of us in trouble to shut down free speech and if you think i'm in trouble
[02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:20.220]  getting all this traffic because mpr is big it's got 40 million listeners a week we've had
[02:10:20.220 --> 02:10:24.140]  massive traffic but we notice it's junk traffic they're not really buying anything or supporting
[02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:28.620]  sponsors which is fine with me most people don't want junk traffic i'll take all of it
[02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:33.660]  because a junk traffic somebody i'm gonna wake up statistically it's a low number of liberals
[02:10:33.660 --> 02:10:39.260]  i'm gonna wake up but i don't care send them to me but we're getting massive traffic from cnn abc
[02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:43.100]  cbs i mean we're not just talking about cnn with low ratings remiss mbc we're talking about abc news
[02:10:43.100 --> 02:10:51.260]  cbs news nbc news uh all the major nightly shows from steven cobert to you name it are
[02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:56.780]  attacking us weekly now and i'm not making it about us but i'm telling you they say they want
[02:10:56.780 --> 02:11:01.740]  thousands of sites shut down they listed the guy we had on michael schneider earlier i know madson's
[02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:07.180]  been some of the reports what they want is the licensed journalist well this guy's got press
[02:11:07.180 --> 02:11:12.620]  club credentials well they'll still go after him the this is massive they want government control
[02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:17.020]  so there's that issue there's the factor trying to keep trump from getting into office all i'm
[02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:20.860]  saying is let's wait let's get him in some appointments are good some are bad the job's
[02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:25.340]  coming back is good he's got them mad that's my take that's my view david night's riding
[02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:29.020]  shotgun with us for most of the hour they'll duck out for 10 minutes the end come back and host
[02:11:29.020 --> 02:11:32.940]  the fourth hour he just came back we're going to wane madson in a moment what are some of the
[02:11:32.940 --> 02:11:38.060]  areas you want to get into with wane madson i wanted to get him on mainly about the cia report
[02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:43.020]  that they admit they won't give the facts they say it's secret i've talked to our connections
[02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:48.220]  and yes i have connections with former high-level cia and current and we have connections into
[02:11:48.220 --> 02:11:52.940]  the private security agencies that are even bigger because they nexus the 16 agencies
[02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:57.980]  booze alan and others i've talked to three people with connections to that they've made the phone
[02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:03.180]  calls they say this is not the main cia that's why we've had clips of congressmen saying who were
[02:12:03.180 --> 02:12:10.940]  anti-trump by the way uh i played the clip last hour where congressman uh which one is that uh
[02:12:10.940 --> 02:12:15.900]  congressman elliott engel of new york said no they won't give us the facts they won't show it to us
[02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:21.580]  so quote i want hearings so i can see it so this is so asinine we know it's hillary tried to steal
[02:12:21.580 --> 02:12:26.940]  the election hillary that ordered the media through i mean i'm wickedly exposed it so we'll
[02:12:26.940 --> 02:12:31.180]  we'll get madson's breakdown expert breakdown on that then we'll get his take on what he thinks we
[02:12:31.180 --> 02:12:35.820]  should do about it uh so we're going to be talking to him here in just a moment the wane madson report
[02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:39.900]  dot com he also reports for info wars dot com i'm inviting him again to come to dc i know we'll
[02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:44.220]  already be there we're getting hotels and stuff to help us cover it during the inauguration but
[02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:48.700]  will trump make it because this is unprecedented they have the cia you're not supposed to be
[02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:53.660]  involved in domestic operations domestically doing this uh what are some of the points you
[02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:57.980]  want wane to get into well i think it's very significant alex that the cia would come out
[02:12:57.980 --> 02:13:02.460]  and talk about this because they would not attack trump if they didn't believe they could take him
[02:13:02.460 --> 02:13:06.300]  down this is why trump needs to take this very seriously and he needs to push back because
[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:10.780]  we always understand that when this information comes out whether it's coming from snowden or
[02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:16.060]  wiki leaks or somebody they want to make them the focus them the criminals so when you expose
[02:13:16.060 --> 02:13:21.500]  the criminal actions of hillary clinton and you expose that she actually did rig the elections
[02:13:21.500 --> 02:13:27.020]  we see that from the conspiracy between her and the press and the dnc they don't want you to look
[02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:30.460]  at what she did to rig the elections they don't want you to look at her crimes they want to make
[02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:35.260]  the whistleblowers and the messengers the criminals and come after them and that's what i told trump
[02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:40.780]  four months ago i said they're trying to steal the nomination you just got that i said i told
[02:13:40.780 --> 02:13:45.260]  miss personally and i said they're coming after you they're going to try to steal the general
[02:13:45.260 --> 02:13:49.020]  and he said i'm already on it so he didn't do what i said he said alex i'm already on it
[02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:54.300]  you'll be very pleased the next few days then he came out it wasn't him listening to me he totally
[02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:58.940]  agreed and understood it wane madson where do you want to start there's a lot here well you know
[02:13:58.940 --> 02:14:06.300]  i um i i've never seen so many per so-called progressives singing the praises of the central
[02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:11.340]  intelligence a you see in one in one case it's surprising but in another it isn't because i've
[02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:17.900]  just written a book called the almost classified guides to uh cia front companies for prior terries
[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:24.940]  and contractors and for even after the uh end of world war two when the cia was created they used
[02:14:24.940 --> 02:14:31.340]  a lot of so-called progressives liberals out of academia they say out of ivy league schools
[02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:37.740]  to do their dirty work in media manipulation operation mockingbird uh the mighty world
[02:14:37.740 --> 02:14:44.460]  it's all this came from people who claim to be good old fd was illegal then they've now passed
[02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:50.780]  laws legalizing it yeah now we're gonna see the voice of america start to play a domestic propaganda
[02:14:50.780 --> 02:14:58.460]  role but uh i look this you know donald trump's right i'm surprised he knows enough about computer
[02:14:58.460 --> 02:15:04.700]  security to say look we don't know if this is china or russia or some guy i know he said a couple
[02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:11.660]  times somebody laying in their bed uh it's called network weaving and the way a way a hacker covers
[02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:18.940]  covers his or her tracks is they go through various servers and computer systems uh around the world
[02:15:18.940 --> 02:15:24.860]  sure i don't like bolton but he's saying this could be an obama false flag yeah yeah yeah absolutely
[02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:31.660]  so network weaving was always done uh by nefarious actors to make it look like it was the russians
[02:15:31.660 --> 02:15:36.380]  or the soviets but that's like a phone spoof where you program your phone to be somebody else's phone
[02:15:36.380 --> 02:15:41.740]  number and then call up and death threat the swat team right so so what they what they do this for
[02:15:41.740 --> 02:15:46.460]  is a especially if they're breaking into bank accounts they don't want to be subject to criminal
[02:15:46.460 --> 02:15:51.980]  investigation it gets to the point where you can't follow those electronic breadcrumbs back any
[02:15:51.980 --> 02:15:59.420]  further because they get lost in this huge complex network weaving operation and and i i don't i don't
[02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:05.260]  think the cia is telling the truth uh i think they're their secret report it's like all the other phony
[02:16:05.260 --> 02:16:10.780]  intelligence have come out with see i i think there's not only a problem with fake news there's a
[02:16:10.780 --> 02:16:17.180]  problem with fake intelligence well honestly most intelligence is fake so cia has has quartered the
[02:16:17.180 --> 02:16:23.340]  market on fake intelligence remember yellow cake uranium and weapons and tracks production and all
[02:16:23.340 --> 02:16:29.660]  that nonsense and by the way they knew those were british trucks sold in 1990 and 1989 uh more than
[02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:35.420]  30 of them to sudam to pump up hot air balloons with cameras on them for artillery direction uh for
[02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:39.420]  the iran iraq war that had just ended but they ordered more trucks they knew in the specs in
[02:16:39.420 --> 02:16:43.580]  jane's weapons quarterly what the trucks were but they lied and said it was anthrax trucks but let
[02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:49.100]  me just get back to this then we get so close to a problem that as we stare into the abyss we become
[02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:53.820]  you know kind of comfortable with it to paraphrase nichy i mean i don't think i've ever seen something
[02:16:53.820 --> 02:16:59.420]  since the kennedy assassination this epic where the cia is openly involved domestically the media
[02:16:59.420 --> 02:17:04.060]  is lockstep saying trumps a russian agent they actually say tucker carlson this congressman
[02:17:04.060 --> 02:17:09.500]  said thursday you're a russian agent i mean this is so laughable but they're doing it
[02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:14.780]  they're serious they're trying to get delegates to go against trump more saying you watch he's not
[02:17:14.780 --> 02:17:20.700]  getting in i think they're triggering cog and i think obama's got on his desk i'm sure they floated
[02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:24.700]  it to him with the media promoting assassination i think they're looking at actually killing trump
[02:17:24.700 --> 02:17:29.180]  i talked to wane right after the election alex and we talked about the color revolutions the
[02:17:29.180 --> 02:17:34.700]  sorrows and the fact that they have always had the goal of delegitimizing an election
[02:17:34.700 --> 02:17:39.820]  and then painting the one who won it as a foreign agent and authoritarian right after they lost
[02:17:39.820 --> 02:17:43.260]  about how it was a purple revolution when hillary came out with her purple clothes what does this
[02:17:43.260 --> 02:17:46.460]  tell you they don't ask wane this what does this tell you they only get back to them assassinating
[02:17:46.460 --> 02:17:49.660]  trump because i think that's really on the front burner now what is it must keep the
[02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:53.580]  break i need more time let me be here sooner they continue so it doesn't matter we're sitting here
[02:17:54.140 --> 02:17:58.300]  we're looking at this and as you said they wouldn't be putting all this out if they didn't
[02:17:58.300 --> 02:18:05.100]  think that they could unseat him and as soon as they lost november 8 two days later sorrows gave
[02:18:05.900 --> 02:18:09.340]  several hundred million more to black lives matter a couple hundred million more to a
[02:18:09.340 --> 02:18:13.420]  fort foundation initiative and a bunch of corporations lined up and gave a million two
[02:18:13.420 --> 02:18:18.300]  million kelochs did they gave hundreds of millions so we're talking close to a billion bucks has been
[02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:23.580]  given to destabilize double the money they got the last year in an election so they're not backing
[02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:28.220]  off on destabilization that was a real marker that they're getting ready for civil war then
[02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:34.140]  cnn comes out yesterday and says we're going into a national emergency get ready it's trump's fault
[02:18:34.140 --> 02:18:39.260]  so wane let's tackle both the national emergency the assassination issue and and and what all this
[02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:43.820]  signifies because i mean i mean in your 40 years as a journalist before that you know in the navy
[02:18:43.820 --> 02:18:50.140]  and in the nsa have you ever has your spidey sense of your gut uh or or or maybe you think i'm wrong
[02:18:50.140 --> 02:18:57.180]  maybe this isn't a critical time i mean what time in history are we standing right now uh 1963 and
[02:18:57.180 --> 02:19:04.140]  john f kennedy i actually before it was after the bay of pigs invasion in 61 he said he was going to
[02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:10.380]  take the cia and and break it up into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the wind i think we're
[02:19:10.380 --> 02:19:15.420]  in that time frame we've never had a president with the exception of jimmy carter who tried to
[02:19:15.420 --> 02:19:20.780]  fire all the bush people and of course they hit him with the october surprise uh that got him out
[02:19:20.780 --> 02:19:28.540]  of office but we've never seen this kind of uh head-to-head struggle uh between the cia and and a
[02:19:28.540 --> 02:19:33.180]  president or in this case and they usually kill somebody or false flag them that's what i'm saying
[02:19:33.180 --> 02:19:38.220]  they wouldn't be arrogantly up on their hind legs that they weren't moving that's right and uh look
[02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:44.860]  you got john brennan as the cia directors still he look this guy's bad news this guy operative
[02:19:44.860 --> 02:19:50.860]  yeah he's representing saudi arabia and the islamic state general flinn called him out on that and
[02:19:50.860 --> 02:19:56.540]  that's why they're going after flinn look at the the story they're trying to say that flinn general
[02:19:56.540 --> 02:20:02.780]  flinn had a private email server at his office in the pentagon anyone who knows washington knows
[02:20:02.780 --> 02:20:08.860]  that the di a director's office isn't in the pentagon it's a di a headquarters of bowling
[02:20:08.860 --> 02:20:15.500]  air force base in washington dc across the phantomic river they're just uh they're calling crazy flinn
[02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:20.220]  when he's known as one of the smartest one of the best guys ever reorganizing things and they're
[02:20:20.220 --> 02:20:25.980]  saying i saw all these articles going he's crazy he claims hillary funded isis it's on record they did
[02:20:26.700 --> 02:20:32.540]  yeah well if the huffington post can't get a basic fact like that right where is the office of the
[02:20:32.540 --> 02:20:39.180]  director the di a director defense intelligence hz if they don't know that's a bowling air force
[02:20:39.180 --> 02:20:45.740]  base what else are they getting wrong they're getting a lot wrong so uh you know fake news i
[02:20:45.740 --> 02:20:51.500]  you know is it fake news or it's just it's not good news gathering it's it's just they just make
[02:20:51.500 --> 02:20:56.540]  up whatever they want so getting back to assassination i mean do you see it in the cards because i see
[02:20:56.540 --> 02:20:59.900]  everything they're doing shows they've committed they're going to try to stop him getting into
[02:20:59.900 --> 02:21:08.060]  office yeah that's why i i mean yeah it's bothering me i i gotta give trump credit for taking on the
[02:21:08.060 --> 02:21:13.900]  cia i it's it's like for me it's a dream come true i always wish somebody would do now look
[02:21:13.900 --> 02:21:19.660]  obama is a product of the cia let me say this then we ask this did you notice they said six months ago
[02:21:19.660 --> 02:21:23.180]  or about five months ago when he won the nomination they said oh we don't want to give him intelligence
[02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:27.420]  previous he said i don't want those fake things from the cia i wouldn't believe a word of that
[02:21:27.420 --> 02:21:33.260]  i have my sources i now know for multiple sources he has high level booze allen analysis that could
[02:21:33.260 --> 02:21:38.700]  become a whole other issue how he was getting that uh and has been getting really good intel all along
[02:21:38.700 --> 02:21:42.460]  and knows what's going on if you look at booze allen whether you like it or not they get diffused
[02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:47.260]  the 16 agencies info they're not just looking at one agency so when they're saying that you know if
[02:21:47.260 --> 02:21:52.220]  we get hit by terrorist he didn't get his briefings it's his fault no it's not because he certainly
[02:21:52.220 --> 02:21:57.260]  is on top of things how astute does it show that he doesn't even want cia briefings
[02:21:57.260 --> 02:22:03.820]  because i think one reason i on wall street there are risk analysis firms who provide uh
[02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:09.100]  wall street with much better intelligence because they're making decisions on wall street that
[02:22:09.100 --> 02:22:14.460]  meet could mean billions and trillions of dollars if they don't have exactly the cia is a bunch of
[02:22:14.460 --> 02:22:20.940]  political uh you know ivy league people that trump can't stand they cook the books on intelligence
[02:22:20.940 --> 02:22:27.340]  we know they did it we know cheney did it on iraq uh and and look i i think yeah i think he's right
[02:22:27.340 --> 02:22:32.380]  i look kennedy that even he didn't trust the cia intelligence because they were trying to
[02:22:32.380 --> 02:22:38.940]  lead him into a nuclear war with the soviet union at the time so we've been here before with this
[02:22:38.940 --> 02:22:45.580]  reagan when reagan was president roundhog day yeah gates bob gates was feeding reagan false
[02:22:45.580 --> 02:22:50.300]  information about soviet but at least back then the soviets were corrupted doing mad stuff there
[02:22:50.300 --> 02:22:53.820]  they're trying to reform while we're going the way of the soviet union i mean how could they
[02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:57.420]  ever accuse putin of trying to censor press when there's not real evidence of it when they're
[02:22:57.420 --> 02:23:03.660]  openly saying shut us up by name all over the place wane yeah they're trying to censor rt and
[02:23:03.660 --> 02:23:09.660]  sputnik radio over here but you know because it's linked to the uh the russian government's
[02:23:09.660 --> 02:23:14.700]  well i'm gonna ask you both this then what does trump do with 38 days out uh let's say i get a
[02:23:14.700 --> 02:23:19.180]  chance to talk to him the next few days i'm talking to trump for say 10 minutes what do i say to the
[02:23:19.180 --> 02:23:25.900]  president uh stand your ground don't don't don't be intimidated by the cia they've been running
[02:23:25.900 --> 02:23:33.740]  this country since 1947 censor inception kennedy tried to take him on they killed him uh and uh
[02:23:33.740 --> 02:23:39.020]  carter tried to take him on they eased him out of office with a with a hostage situation
[02:23:39.020 --> 02:23:46.300]  created by the cia in iran so this is what he's facing reagan didn't trust these trilateral types
[02:23:46.300 --> 02:23:52.940]  and cfrs either and a friend of the bush family took a shot at him uh you know a few months after
[02:23:52.940 --> 02:23:58.380]  he was inaugurated well trump trump has backed off some going after hillary at least until he gets in
[02:23:59.020 --> 02:24:02.700]  and all they're doing is attacking him from every angle trying to bring him down
[02:24:03.740 --> 02:24:09.180]  i mean he's got to secure the republic in our vote if outside influences like soros are moving
[02:24:09.180 --> 02:24:13.980]  against us and congress wants investigations of us and trump there should be real investigations
[02:24:13.980 --> 02:24:18.380]  of soros and these leftist groups and hillary trying to steal the election look they're trying
[02:24:18.380 --> 02:24:23.020]  to overthrow our country and the first amendment at a certain point we've got to go after these
[02:24:23.020 --> 02:24:27.020]  people criminally david yeah absolutely alex and that's what we talked about right after the
[02:24:27.020 --> 02:24:31.180]  election the fact that this follows a pattern that we've seen from george soros again and again
[02:24:31.180 --> 02:24:37.020]  for regime change his color revolutions and it's about delegitimizing the election and demonizing
[02:24:37.020 --> 02:24:40.780]  the person that won the election he needs to come out on the offensive he needs to understand
[02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:44.620]  first of all they're very serious they think they can get away with this or they would not be attacking
[02:24:44.620 --> 02:24:48.700]  the president you don't go after the king unless you think you can kill him how's he go offense how's
[02:24:48.700 --> 02:24:54.780]  he go offense by saying hey you're not talking about what was exposed how hillary and the democrat
[02:24:54.780 --> 02:24:58.540]  party and the media actually do a press conference because he keeps trying to corrupt the election he
[02:24:58.540 --> 02:25:02.220]  keeps trying to ignore it because he's presidential yeah and hope it goes away it's every channel
[02:25:02.220 --> 02:25:07.340]  he's got to come out in the press conference and say it's outrageous my father my company what we do
[02:25:07.340 --> 02:25:12.460]  in america what we've built the great victory we've had the job list the jobs he's brought back and
[02:25:12.460 --> 02:25:18.940]  then the cia that gave you fake wmd info and all the rest of it comes out here and claims the russians
[02:25:18.940 --> 02:25:23.100]  did this and that you're stupid america and you voted for me because of the russians and i'll tell
[02:25:23.100 --> 02:25:27.340]  you something else hillary had jill stein go out with this recount the democrats gave her money she
[02:25:27.340 --> 02:25:31.900]  joined it and they counted these states and i got hundreds of thousands more votes if he did that
[02:25:31.900 --> 02:25:37.260]  everywhere you added up it'd be millions like i said they've got the illegals voting they think
[02:25:37.260 --> 02:25:41.420]  they run this country they've run it in the ground and you know what what does the american people
[02:25:41.420 --> 02:25:46.380]  want me to do they're trying to have the electors overthrow this and cause a civil war what should
[02:25:46.380 --> 02:25:52.860]  we do and then the people would say arrest their assets because i am sick of this and you notice
[02:25:52.860 --> 02:25:58.780]  that as soon as jill stein crashed and burned on this recount attempt being shut down in two states
[02:25:58.780 --> 02:26:04.460]  by judges who had the good sense to say she doesn't have standing in this she's got one percent or less
[02:26:04.460 --> 02:26:09.100]  of the vote there's no reason that she should be the one calling for a recount but in the one
[02:26:09.100 --> 02:26:13.740]  they're trying to cause a civil war we gotta stop them it's sedition listen if i get up here and say
[02:26:13.740 --> 02:26:17.180]  the government's corrupt and out of control they just stop this policy it's not because i hate america
[02:26:17.180 --> 02:26:20.940]  it's i hate the criminals in government we finally start getting a government that wants to restore
[02:26:20.940 --> 02:26:26.140]  the republic bring back jobs bring back transparency do some decent stuff and all these foreign powers
[02:26:26.140 --> 02:26:31.020]  and agencies are openly trying to overthrow it and cause a civil war and they've given a billion
[02:26:31.020 --> 02:26:37.260]  dollars to cause a race war we cannot sit here and let a james bond villain plan be carried out
[02:26:37.260 --> 02:26:42.700]  against us sorry go ahead david oh that's exactly it in other countries he's done it not on the basis
[02:26:42.700 --> 02:26:48.220]  of race because they're homogeneous in terms of race but they have a stratified yeah that's by religion
[02:26:48.220 --> 02:26:52.700]  or stratified based on income level that's the way the communists did it they broke everybody
[02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:57.180]  into these economic classes here they didn't have that type of thing so what they did was they went
[02:26:57.180 --> 02:27:02.700]  after racial division to try to create the basis for the revolution but alex the key thing is that
[02:27:02.700 --> 02:27:07.420]  we've got to understand that this attack on the press was in the works going back to 2013 when
[02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:11.740]  they took away the prohibition of voice of america coming into this up the whole time yeah this has
[02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:15.820]  been this is before trump and so this isn't anything as they're trying to betray it i would
[02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:19.900]  tell the dummies out there something there's so many people with blogs and sites that even follow
[02:27:19.900 --> 02:27:24.060]  our genre of awakening and they and they think it's competition they go oh good i hope alex
[02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:28.620]  shut down will be bigger hey dummies they'll shut you down before they shut us down that's how it
[02:27:28.620 --> 02:27:33.500]  works they're getting the little people first that's who facebook everybody's kicking off believe me
[02:27:34.620 --> 02:27:39.100]  if things get so bad the press is getting shut down i'm just going to evacuate this isn't about
[02:27:39.100 --> 02:27:43.900]  alex jones like washington times alex jones begs trump to save his website now that folks are calling
[02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:48.540]  for it to be shut down it's called a blacklist dummy that's what i'm concerned about not about
[02:27:48.540 --> 02:27:55.020]  them shutting me down individually uh i'm sorry go ahead my friend go ahead wane mattson well look
[02:27:55.020 --> 02:28:00.860]  i think uh one thing it's i think i think trump ought to go on the offensive uh rather than play
[02:28:00.860 --> 02:28:06.060]  defense on this he should say look after i'm inaugurated i'm going to name a blue ribbon
[02:28:06.060 --> 02:28:12.460]  commission or panel to look at the cia's blatant involvement before the election people like uh
[02:28:12.460 --> 02:28:19.340]  these retired or former cia directors michael hayden mike morrell all getting involved this guy evan
[02:28:19.340 --> 02:28:25.980]  mcmullin former cia clandestine running against them uh you know i mean who funded these operations
[02:28:25.980 --> 02:28:30.940]  oh they have cia field commanders running the stuff in utah to try to get delegates i mean they're
[02:28:30.940 --> 02:28:37.500]  oh this is an operation right he needs the he needs then he needs to say look i want to do i i want
[02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:42.460]  to do what eisenhower said when he warned us against the military industrial complex cia was part
[02:28:42.460 --> 02:28:48.300]  of that what kennedy said he wanted to do get rid of this agency what senator daniel patrick moinahan
[02:28:48.300 --> 02:28:53.820]  hillary's predecessor is senator from new york said get rid of the cia and get rid of all that
[02:28:53.820 --> 02:28:59.020]  claim that's exactly it's over for the globalist if we link up with russia unify around dealing
[02:28:59.020 --> 02:29:04.300]  with radical islam and create a free market bridge and then get china contained and reformed
[02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:09.900]  i'm telling you it's peace man but the globalists don't want that do they want no no they want they
[02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:16.220]  want constant uh schisms and you know i mean hillary's still wearing the purple i saw at this
[02:29:16.220 --> 02:29:21.420]  farewell thing for senator reid means color revolution walked in she looked like barney the
[02:29:21.420 --> 02:29:27.660]  dinosaur with a purple pants suit on uh uh you know so she's still playing that purple revolution
[02:29:27.660 --> 02:29:34.060]  card uh i think her days are over she's history but look she's got plenty of acolytes out there
[02:29:34.060 --> 02:29:39.420]  in congress and then these uh ngos and all these other groups well let's talk about that let's talk
[02:29:39.420 --> 02:29:42.540]  about the way they're going to try to bring down trump because they're certainly trying as david
[02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:46.620]  said you you aim at the king to take him out you better hit him i mean they're going all out what
[02:29:46.620 --> 02:29:53.820]  do we expect what can we do straight ahead we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and
[02:29:53.820 --> 02:30:04.300]  the gcn radio network why is the cia pushing this ridiculous conspiracy theory reports of russian
[02:30:04.300 --> 02:30:09.180]  officials intervening in the american presidential election have been industriously circulated for
[02:30:09.180 --> 02:30:14.460]  months the fbi dhs and the office of the director of national intelligence are all looking at the
[02:30:14.460 --> 02:30:19.100]  same allegations and all of the agencies came up with the same foregone conclusion flatamere
[02:30:19.100 --> 02:30:23.660]  putin's government deliberately interfered with america's presidential election the laughable
[02:30:23.660 --> 02:30:28.300]  insinuation was reiterated this morning in an article published in the hill attacking president
[02:30:28.300 --> 02:30:32.780]  elect donald trump for casting doubt on their assessment concluding that russia intervened in
[02:30:32.780 --> 02:30:37.180]  the election to help him win the white house trump tweeted out can you imagine if the election results
[02:30:37.180 --> 02:30:43.100]  were opposite and we tried to play the russia cia card keep in mind this is the same cia that asserted
[02:30:43.100 --> 02:30:47.500]  false claims against saddam hussein and led us into the invasion of iraq with a track record
[02:30:47.500 --> 02:30:52.220]  like that one must take their assessments with a serious grain of salt and question the motivation

[02:38:58.220 --> 02:39:03.100]  things i want to cover with you but looking at where all this lays out this point in history
[02:39:03.100 --> 02:39:11.100]  uh what else is on your big board well i i just it's amazing to me to see the as so many democrats
[02:39:11.100 --> 02:39:17.820]  and some republicans like the dementia patient john mccain uh resorting to these macarthur
[02:39:17.820 --> 02:39:25.340]  tactics of calling everyone a russian agent i you know it's what we're back in the 1950s here
[02:39:25.340 --> 02:39:34.140]  i mean it's like uh trumps an agent uh flinzen agent uh but then there were some soviet agents
[02:39:34.140 --> 02:39:39.340]  i mean it wasn't as bad as i mean now it's total ball oh now it's like there's one behind every
[02:39:39.340 --> 02:39:46.620]  tree and uh under your bed and and uh you know i and i'm not surprised that soros is helping
[02:39:46.620 --> 02:39:52.940]  with this propaganda because he's a hungarian he has a visceral hatred for anything russian
[02:39:52.940 --> 02:39:58.860]  and uh it's to the point where he and his father were helping the gestapo at the end of world war
[02:39:58.860 --> 02:40:05.420]  two uh to round up hungarian jews and send them to the death camps uh that that's uh somebody
[02:40:05.420 --> 02:40:12.300]  that really has a visceral hatred for russians because uh he decided it was better to kiss
[02:40:12.300 --> 02:40:20.540]  this lot with the nazis and uh so i mean this is just ridiculous all these charges that everybody
[02:40:20.540 --> 02:40:27.580]  oh yeah look even even tom hartman because he has a show on rt and you know he's a he's a soros
[02:40:27.580 --> 02:40:33.580]  acolyte he's accused of being a russian agent ed schultz larry king because they have shows on
[02:40:33.580 --> 02:40:40.300]  rt all all supposedly now russian agents it's really disgusting that the that many democrats
[02:40:40.300 --> 02:40:45.980]  and a few of these republicans are resorting to these tactics sure but saying tucker carlsson
[02:40:46.540 --> 02:40:50.140]  that i mean the i mean the guys he said well you're a russian agent too and tucker starts
[02:40:50.140 --> 02:40:53.420]  laughing at the end of the interview because the guy couldn't show proof of you know this all being
[02:40:53.420 --> 02:40:57.980]  run by the russians and it just been retracted that very day by the washington post and of course
[02:40:57.980 --> 02:41:01.500]  tucker hasn't said this but i know tucker but the dinner with him even i mean i looked into things
[02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:06.220]  his dad was the head of voice of america for like 20 years and a bunch of other clandestine
[02:41:06.220 --> 02:41:10.860]  stuff i mean you know to say his dad was probably cia was working for the russians is just a
[02:41:10.860 --> 02:41:16.460]  ridiculous joke yeah i met his dad a few times and yeah i mean that's that's kind of ridiculous
[02:41:16.460 --> 02:41:23.820]  since he was part of the effort to combat uh soviet uh an act of measures and disinformation
[02:41:23.820 --> 02:41:29.980]  during the cold war but these people again they they want they're they're they're entitled
[02:41:30.700 --> 02:41:35.580]  to their own opinions even though they're flawed but they're not entitled to their own facts here
[02:41:35.580 --> 02:41:41.500]  and that's what we're we're seeing and in many cases uh these individuals are casting
[02:41:42.140 --> 02:41:48.380]  blame i i wasn't on that washington post list the proper not that combo many publications
[02:41:48.380 --> 02:41:56.460]  including info wars who i write for uh were on that list so i you know i i know it's ridiculous
[02:41:56.460 --> 02:42:01.260]  well i've seen you listed as fake news in articles though about fake news so don't worry oh yeah
[02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:07.180]  yeah no there was a couple twitter messages that stated that so uh fake news yeah well let's look
[02:42:07.180 --> 02:42:15.180]  at the washington post 1981 uh janet cook uh wrote a book i wrote an article about uh a seven-year-old
[02:42:15.180 --> 02:42:21.260]  african-american boy named jimmy in dc who was a heroin addict uh got the Pulitzer prize for it
[02:42:21.260 --> 02:42:27.980]  except one problem uh they had to retract it she made up the story even though the great bob woodward
[02:42:27.980 --> 02:42:35.180]  is the one who nominated her for the Pulitzer uh jason blair new york times 34 what do you think
[02:42:35.180 --> 02:42:40.140]  of the new york times hiring the guy from from politica that said quote i'm a hack tell me what
[02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:45.100]  to do all right any anything you want i'll lie and they're like oh you know that's great credentials
[02:42:45.100 --> 02:42:51.660]  you're a discredited lying hack in the wiki leaks let's hire you yeah yeah well look you want fake
[02:42:51.660 --> 02:42:58.380]  news go to the new york times washington post the new republic usa today they've all had their
[02:42:58.380 --> 02:43:04.380]  share and brian williams of all people i mean this you notice he's the new crusader against fake news
[02:43:04.380 --> 02:43:09.900]  yeah you know you can't make it up you just can't make it up i've never seen anything like this let
[02:43:09.900 --> 02:43:13.180]  me ask you about the psychology you're i mean you're really a smart guy i mean i really want your
[02:43:13.180 --> 02:43:16.460]  view on this and i want david's view on this jumping anytime david this is a this is co-host
[02:43:16.460 --> 02:43:20.940]  free for all here we're all co-hosting together right now on a panel what is the mental illness
[02:43:20.940 --> 02:43:24.860]  that's come over and i want to add to that i've lived in austin liberal towns it's high school
[02:43:24.860 --> 02:43:28.620]  but it was good old-fashioned liberals that were against torture war all this kind of stuff
[02:43:29.260 --> 02:43:34.140]  now that i get confronted at every time i go out grocery store hiking bike trail
[02:43:34.860 --> 02:43:38.540]  had a guy walk up pull a gun out and say you think you're tough now you know you piece of crap
[02:43:39.420 --> 02:43:44.940]  i mean they're going crazy right now and they just seem like they're they're they're they're going
[02:43:44.940 --> 02:43:50.700]  like you're dying or something and i don't get it for hillary clinton this monster and then they're
[02:43:50.700 --> 02:43:55.340]  they're lying about trump what what the hell happened to him they're they remind me of the
[02:43:55.340 --> 02:44:01.660]  people who follow jim jones down to jones town in guiana i mean i think i think these people are
[02:44:01.660 --> 02:44:08.460]  delusional and that's being kind uh some of them are plain mentally ill i think uh uh the way
[02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:15.820]  they're spreading around certain uh stories but uh you know i guess that's uh that's the kind of
[02:44:15.820 --> 02:44:21.340]  environment we live in now with you know and now they want to breathe there's a call to brief
[02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:26.380]  all the members of the electoral college to give them a cia intelligence briefing where they'll be
[02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:32.460]  lied to by the cia about fake intelligence oh yeah they're saying the democrats are saying
[02:44:32.460 --> 02:44:36.620]  brief everyone get involved like the mafia with a jury that's what they are but they've already
[02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:41.100]  been given the vote the jury foreman's been given the vote to deliver and they say let the cia come
[02:44:41.100 --> 02:44:46.060]  in and tell them don't vote for trump because the rooskies well what we should show them alex is
[02:44:46.060 --> 02:44:50.220]  that clip from the defense department briefing remember a few years ago was it two years ago
[02:44:50.220 --> 02:44:55.980]  where the uh the the one lady who was an officer stood up and said to the defense department official
[02:44:55.980 --> 02:45:00.860]  uh nobody believes us anymore it's just mindless propaganda that's what they should show these
[02:45:00.860 --> 02:45:06.140]  jurors yeah that's in the article uh uh pentagon's promises to stop lying because of matt drudge
[02:45:06.140 --> 02:45:11.180]  and the under secretary of defense gets up and they have people to psi off meeting but both
[02:45:11.180 --> 02:45:15.500]  military and civilian getting up and going what we don't have to lie anymore they didn't get that
[02:45:15.500 --> 02:45:20.140]  was a new announcement that they're going domestic and we promise to stop lying that was the roll out
[02:45:20.140 --> 02:45:24.780]  of the line this one woman gets up from the military and she doesn't quite get it she goes
[02:45:24.780 --> 02:45:28.380]  i'm really sick of lying can i tell the truth because they don't believe us they're like excuse me
[02:45:28.380 --> 02:45:34.700]  man you didn't quite get this but the other part of it is alex just as they use the policies of
[02:45:34.700 --> 02:45:39.100]  they call it diversity but actually it is racialism that they push and racism that they push
[02:45:39.100 --> 02:45:43.740]  now these people who have been calling those of us who are concerned about open borders the security
[02:45:43.740 --> 02:45:49.020]  issues of that the economic consequences of that they called us xenophobic and yet they're pushing
[02:45:49.020 --> 02:45:55.020]  hardcore xenophobia by saying foreign influence is why we have to give the uh state department
[02:45:55.020 --> 02:45:59.900]  the ability to propagandize america they're going to put out fact-based narratives we're going to
[02:45:59.900 --> 02:46:04.540]  give them 160 million dollars to do this we're going to make the state department the center of this
[02:46:04.540 --> 02:46:08.940]  that is why they're they're pushing back and they're using xenophobia to do it and does it that
[02:46:08.940 --> 02:46:12.300]  but so it's okay that we're going to blacklist and state rome because we're fighting the racism
[02:46:12.300 --> 02:46:17.580]  which is actually creating the division wane looking at this psychology the again i know you
[02:46:17.580 --> 02:46:21.020]  talked about the mentally ill followers of it what about the press themselves they've only
[02:46:21.020 --> 02:46:25.660]  seemed to get more arrogant and they and they're doing more of what brought them to where they are
[02:46:25.660 --> 02:46:30.140]  i don't think they realize most the military and even intelligence people now are awake
[02:46:30.140 --> 02:46:35.900]  so they try some weird soft coup i expect is going to blow up in their face well this is because
[02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:42.060]  you get uh ownership of the media and so few corporate hands they can they can actually get
[02:46:42.060 --> 02:46:47.340]  together and and you know on monday morning say okay this is what we're going to this is going to be
[02:46:47.340 --> 02:46:54.220]  the lead uh this week this is where we're going everybody runs with the pack and it's very easy
[02:46:54.220 --> 02:46:59.660]  to do that you know people it reminds me of the movie network where peter finch who played
[02:46:59.660 --> 02:47:06.300]  howard bill the network anchor man said everybody turn off your tv's go to the window put your head
[02:47:06.300 --> 02:47:11.260]  out the window and say i'm mad as hell and i'm not going to take it anymore i i think basically
[02:47:11.260 --> 02:47:17.820]  trump is tapped into the people the fictional people in that movie who said yeah that's that's
[02:47:17.820 --> 02:47:22.540]  he's speaking for me and they you know people all over the country stuck their head out the window
[02:47:22.540 --> 02:47:27.820]  and said i'm mad as hell and i'm not going to take it anymore and i think people as we saw with the
[02:47:27.820 --> 02:47:35.580]  election results basically did the same thing in the in at the polling place so looking at foreign
[02:47:35.580 --> 02:47:39.420]  governments looking at what the cia is done before here and and we're throwing other governments
[02:47:39.420 --> 02:47:43.260]  if they do try a power play we know they're trying to get the delegates to go against team
[02:47:44.860 --> 02:47:48.620]  the electors to go against team if that doesn't work they've shown they're not going to give up
[02:47:48.620 --> 02:47:52.460]  they're totally mentally ill what do they do next well i think he's really going to have to have
[02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:55.980]  somebody to come out in his organization if he doesn't want to do it he's going to have to have
[02:47:55.980 --> 02:48:00.860]  somebody come out and say this is why we have the electoral college it is a firewall against
[02:48:00.860 --> 02:48:05.020]  the concentration of power it is a firewall against the corruption that you find in certain
[02:48:05.020 --> 02:48:09.900]  jurisdictions like new york or california or whatever the big cities that's what its purpose
[02:48:09.900 --> 02:48:14.380]  is to everything separation of powers exactly and so they have to defend that and then they also have
[02:48:14.380 --> 02:48:20.140]  to put this in the context of these people saying well we're going to change the electors who are
[02:48:20.140 --> 02:48:23.420]  going the delegates who are going to go to the convention and we're going to get them to have
[02:48:23.420 --> 02:48:27.180]  their own uh uh decision here now we're going to do the same thing with the electoral college and
[02:48:27.180 --> 02:48:33.740]  the lesson is this trump fought it so they weren't able to steal his nomination sanders didn't he lost
[02:48:33.740 --> 02:48:38.620]  it the lesson is trump must go on the attack so i'm going to go back to you guys to go on this
[02:48:38.620 --> 02:48:44.060]  attack against the electoral college right wane how does he go on the attack i as i say i think
[02:48:44.060 --> 02:48:49.900]  what he needs to do he needs to be really tough on what the cia is doing right now he needs to call
[02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:56.620]  for a commission after he's inaugurated to say look we're this is an interrogation i agree with you
[02:48:56.620 --> 02:49:01.340]  said that earlier but what does he do in the next 38 days my friend well i think he's got to keep
[02:49:01.340 --> 02:49:07.500]  keep up the offense on on uh the people that are the these vicartheid tactics of saying
[02:49:07.500 --> 02:49:13.100]  everybody's a russian agent it's ridiculous because that can lead obviously russia's a
[02:49:13.100 --> 02:49:19.580]  nuclear superpower that can lead to war and maybe that's my next question what do you
[02:49:19.580 --> 02:49:25.740]  think russia's thinking by all this well i mean you know right russia has been putting out with
[02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:34.940]  this fake fakery with the news in the west and fake intelligence now for you know what 15 years or
[02:49:34.940 --> 02:49:41.900]  more uh that russia is doing all these things because it's aggressive it was told that nato
[02:49:41.900 --> 02:49:47.420]  would not first it was told by malin albright nato's not going to expand into poland check us
[02:49:47.420 --> 02:49:53.500]  check and slavak and uh hungry and it did and they say well it's not going to expand and they
[02:49:53.500 --> 02:49:57.580]  watched him bomb sir being handed over to the muslims they closer they watched him take over
[02:49:57.580 --> 02:50:01.420]  the middle east and had it handed to radicals and they see him moving up their borders saying we
[02:50:01.420 --> 02:50:06.300]  come in peace we come in peace but like in mars attacks they don't come in peace right right i
[02:50:06.300 --> 02:50:10.300]  mean it was to the point they were going to be in ukraine and georgia they were going to surround
[02:50:10.300 --> 02:50:15.900]  russia i mean you'd have naton nato right we're going up the vulgar river if they had a chance
[02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:22.780]  and then our media says russia invaded ukraine when soros brags he overthrew the thing yeah right
[02:50:22.780 --> 02:50:31.100]  right at twice soros was involved in the orange revolution in uh 2004 and the maydan revolution
[02:50:31.100 --> 02:50:36.140]  in 2014 that's twice let me ask you this question when we come back when they get david's take why
[02:50:36.140 --> 02:50:43.180]  is soros still above ground not pushing daisies i mean he's got so many enemies this guy is like

[02:55:08.620 --> 02:55:13.820]  trump maximum alert globalist claim americans did not choose trump and i think that's really
[02:55:13.820 --> 02:55:20.140]  emblematic the cia and the democrats claim you didn't choose trump you can't have it you're a russian
[02:55:22.060 --> 02:55:25.660]  moron you're a useful idiot uh you're a russian
[02:55:26.460 --> 02:55:31.820]  dup that is such an insult by this arrogant you know i've read a lot of novels i've read a lot
[02:55:31.820 --> 02:55:36.780]  of history i've read a lot i see a lot of movies but fiction is so much crazier wane madson the
[02:55:36.780 --> 02:55:43.580]  arrogance of the imperial press the how discredited how low and now they've got the in movies i got
[02:55:43.580 --> 02:55:48.620]  i checked out what a caller called advertising msnbc at movie chains and they're force feeding it to
[02:55:48.620 --> 02:55:56.060]  school kids it's just like an obama's calling for state-run media it's like wow wow you think you
[02:55:56.060 --> 02:56:01.820]  weren't lying enough is why you lost wane your comments on that and closing well i just i would
[02:56:01.820 --> 02:56:07.340]  just point out you know they they said that paul maniford it was a former campaign chairman for
[02:56:07.340 --> 02:56:13.420]  uh uh trump uh what they've said he's a russian agent because he he had a lot you know he was
[02:56:13.420 --> 02:56:18.140]  basically a lobbyist and he was representing the interests of the ukrainian president victor
[02:56:18.140 --> 02:56:25.900]  janikovic who was overthrown by the soros revolution in 2014 janikovic was the democratically
[02:56:25.900 --> 02:56:31.500]  elected president that's the thing i've talked to roger stone about this and maniford said
[02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:36.140]  why come on and tell the public they just don't they just not sophisticated enough he helped put
[02:56:36.140 --> 02:56:41.340]  people in that were anti russian but podesta was involved just as much as maniford wise and they
[02:56:41.340 --> 02:56:45.980]  never said anything about podesta's involvement as a lobbyist exactly it's his brother it's picking
[02:56:45.980 --> 02:56:52.460]  and choosing it's cherry picking and that's what you're doing this this new macartheism is uh is
[02:56:52.460 --> 02:56:58.700]  just right i mean anyone i think the democrats are going to pay a big price for what they're doing
[02:56:58.700 --> 02:57:04.380]  and demonizing people uh like what happened in the 1950s well yeah i mean it's beyond it's beyond
[02:57:04.380 --> 02:57:09.900]  calling us deplorables what do you make of the fbi coming out challenging the cia and saying uh no no
[02:57:09.900 --> 02:57:14.940]  you don't have proof of this oh well they're trying to say coli's another russian agent now
[02:57:14.940 --> 02:57:21.100]  look the fbi has responsibility for current foreign counterintelligence activities in the united states
[02:57:21.100 --> 02:57:27.340]  they're the experts on that i'll go with the fbi that's weird coming from me who's been visited by
[02:57:27.340 --> 02:57:33.980]  them on several occasions but i'll go with the fbi's good judgment on that they know the cia
[02:57:33.980 --> 02:57:39.660]  is making it up and then of course we see that in georgia you had the uh department of homeland
[02:57:39.660 --> 02:57:43.180]  security actually try to hack in there and they had to admit it and they said well it was a rogue
[02:57:43.180 --> 02:57:48.220]  employee but of course it couldn't be a rogue employee that uh exposed all these emails from
[02:57:48.220 --> 02:57:53.500]  hillary clinton and uh and podesta now it couldn't be couldn't be a rogue employee apparently they
[02:57:53.500 --> 02:57:59.580]  also were caught by going into the systems in illinois so we have a pattern of dhs doing it
[02:57:59.580 --> 02:58:02.860]  when we do five more minutes with us in the day but night's going to take over he's got a lot of

[03:00:29.100 --> 03:00:35.660]  going to get more into uh some of these nominees uh rex tillerson was previously anti carbon tax
[03:00:35.660 --> 03:00:40.620]  anti global warming they threatened to remove him then he became for it trump says he's against it
[03:00:40.620 --> 03:00:45.900]  i know his new epa head is attorney general of oklahoma he says it's a total fraud rick perry
[03:00:45.900 --> 03:00:50.860]  was against carbon taxes i don't like him for the department of energy uh and so it goes on and on
[03:00:50.860 --> 03:00:56.380]  this this this marine court journal that was forget mo i get not liking al qaeda i get the fact but
[03:00:56.380 --> 03:01:00.460]  you gotta have to process or it ends up being used against us there's some problems with these
[03:01:00.460 --> 03:01:04.540]  appointments but what i care about is he's bringing the jobs back and i want to see what he does once
[03:01:04.540 --> 03:01:09.740]  he gets in office the cia and the globalist and soros trying to block our election is front and
[03:01:09.740 --> 03:01:15.340]  center for me right now that's what i'm focusing on trump goes sideways we're gonna keep him honest
[03:01:15.340 --> 03:01:21.180]  or die trying politically but wane other points well it's going to be interesting to see who his
[03:01:21.180 --> 03:01:28.620]  pick is for cia director uh the word is that carly fiorina may have to be the dni director of national
[03:01:28.620 --> 03:01:33.500]  intelligence but no that cia director is going to be very key because he's going to have to
[03:01:33.500 --> 03:01:38.300]  have somebody with the mandate to go in there and shake that place up and the people who've been
[03:01:38.300 --> 03:01:45.260]  involved in domestic politics partisan politics have got to be shown the door uh and it's
[03:01:45.260 --> 03:01:50.140]  going to be a very they need a tough guy to do that but we or a woman well i tell you they're
[03:01:50.140 --> 03:01:55.340]  arrogant to go up against rumber they know is vindictive at least he keeps score trying to
[03:01:55.340 --> 03:02:00.620]  keep him out he's they've got to know that he's coming after him now well he knows how to say
[03:02:00.620 --> 03:02:07.660]  you're fired i mean he did that on on this reality show so uh you know we know he's capable of doing
[03:02:07.660 --> 03:02:12.460]  it and he said you know apparently done it with a couple of people who supported him and we're on
[03:02:12.460 --> 03:02:18.460]  the transition team so uh i think he should scorch dirt i mean basically i think it's time for all
[03:02:18.460 --> 03:02:23.580]  the old both party people anybody that didn't support him gone you gotta get william benny
[03:02:24.860 --> 03:02:30.460]  william benny is the head of the cia i tell you he's a tough guy he stood up to the uh nsa and he
[03:02:30.460 --> 03:02:33.740]  said this is against the constipation and he ran the program against the russians yeah that's how
[03:02:33.740 --> 03:02:38.460]  we decorate he knows all the technical issues he's not going to be gaslighted by these people
[03:02:38.460 --> 03:02:43.980]  hey yeah what about william benny for director of or cia director i'm i'm all for bill benny uh over
[03:02:43.980 --> 03:02:50.540]  there he he um you know he at least unlike some cia directors he knows how to drive there he knows
[03:02:50.540 --> 03:02:55.980]  the directions how to get the you know the cia quarters and i wonder about some of the past
[03:02:55.980 --> 03:03:01.100]  directors whether they actually knew where to show up for work now what do you make of hayden he just
[03:03:01.100 --> 03:03:09.580]  comes off as a candy s oh well you know d at the nsa director cia director uh i called i called him
[03:03:09.580 --> 03:03:16.300]  when he was ahead of uh nsa i called it hayden's heroes and i i did i i did a thing with hogan
[03:03:16.300 --> 03:03:22.540]  he you know he was he was uh wearing the you know he was in this where hogan pernell hogan was i mean
[03:03:22.540 --> 03:03:29.020]  the guy's a joke uh you know he he didn't even know what the fourth amendment to the constitution
[03:03:29.020 --> 03:03:34.540]  was at at a speech he gave at the national press club i i don't know where they find these people
[03:03:35.580 --> 03:03:41.740]  but uh uh look brennan brennan's got to be one of the first guys of course i i hope that
[03:03:41.740 --> 03:03:46.620]  he doesn't convince trump to keep him on in some temporary capacity that's right he keeps
[03:03:46.620 --> 03:03:51.420]  brennan on when he's pulling all this with trump uh i mean this is insane yeah he's going to
[03:03:51.420 --> 03:03:57.420]  dagger this back and we now know that brennan has authorized the jihadist rebels in syria to have
[03:03:57.420 --> 03:04:02.540]  these shoulder launch missiles so you know they can be used against russian planes of course oh
[03:04:02.540 --> 03:04:06.060]  yeah but they're saying trump only gets a weekly briefing so there's any terror attacks it's his
[03:04:06.060 --> 03:04:12.460]  fault no it's obama and brennan's fault yeah so brennan's given the wants them to shoot down russian
[03:04:12.460 --> 03:04:19.020]  sq 34 fighters but those same missiles can be used to bring down commercial aircraft i mean who's
[03:04:19.020 --> 03:04:25.100]  running that show up there at langley these are about they you know i look what trump needs to do
[03:04:25.100 --> 03:04:31.420]  is he needs to say also the cia is aiding and embedding terrorism in syria and other countries
[03:04:31.420 --> 03:04:35.740]  same thing has been saying hillary's the founder of isis all right thank you so much wane madson

[03:05:06.620 --> 03:05:12.460]  a goodwill mission to island in 2011 now this troubling report has come to light in its reviewing

[03:05:33.820 --> 03:05:38.060]  that they had knowledge of quote hackers wanting to destroy software systems in the country and
[03:05:38.060 --> 03:05:44.300]  offered help well the interior minister mr yohansen said he became suspicious of the u.s good intentions

[03:08:36.940 --> 03:08:39.740]  historically when governments move against free press
[03:08:39.740 --> 03:08:47.740]  major wars and absolute horrors are committed against the people as we speak the european
[03:08:47.740 --> 03:08:53.180]  union is openly calling to shut down the quote alt right in the united states and is ordering

[03:09:06.540 --> 03:09:12.140]  just during the us but worldwide that's what our bill of rights and constitution are all about
[03:09:13.100 --> 03:09:19.820]  that's why it's called the first amendment first because it is the most important if we shut down
[03:09:19.820 --> 03:09:45.740]  free speech the light goes out of the world
[03:09:49.820 --> 03:10:05.900]  uh
[03:10:05.900 --> 03:10:28.580]  Okay, and of course that was that clip of all the people in Korea crying because of their
[03:10:28.580 --> 03:10:32.800]  dear leader departed and we saw the beginning of that Hillary Clinton dressed in purple
[03:10:32.800 --> 03:10:37.300]  because whenever she bothers to comb her hair and go outside the apartment she always wears
[03:10:37.300 --> 03:10:41.060]  purple now because that's the way they're going to roll. Look, we have to understand
[03:10:41.060 --> 03:10:46.260]  the narrative and how this thing has progressed. Understand that at the very next day after
[03:10:46.260 --> 03:10:50.460]  the election, what do we have? We had riots, then they moved from that to recounts and
[03:10:50.460 --> 03:10:54.700]  now we have this attack with the Electoral College.
[03:10:54.700 --> 03:10:59.420]  Remember first it was an attack on the Electoral College. They said, how dare we even have
[03:10:59.420 --> 03:11:03.700]  an Electoral College? How undemocratic to have an Electoral College? Why don't we just
[03:11:03.700 --> 03:11:08.460]  have the people make the decision and now look at what they've done. They flipped it.
[03:11:08.460 --> 03:11:13.940]  They said, no, we need the Electoral College to make the correct decision and overrule
[03:11:13.940 --> 03:11:18.500]  what the people voted for state by state. That's what these electors here in Texas and
[03:11:18.500 --> 03:11:22.860]  other places are saying. We don't care that there are millions of Texans who voted for
[03:11:22.860 --> 03:11:23.860]  Donald Trump.
[03:11:23.860 --> 03:11:27.860]  No, the guy who wasn't on the ballot, the elector that I didn't see on the ballot is
[03:11:27.860 --> 03:11:32.940]  going to say, no, I'm gonna make the decision for you because you didn't get the right answer.
[03:11:32.940 --> 03:11:36.780]  Same thing we saw the Republican Convention pushing the delegates to do that, the elites
[03:11:36.780 --> 03:11:37.780]  doing that.
[03:11:37.780 --> 03:11:41.340]  They came out, they said, we don't want to have an Electoral College because it's undemocratic
[03:11:41.340 --> 03:11:46.380]  and now they want to throw away your democratic vote using the Electoral College. Just see
[03:11:46.380 --> 03:11:50.420]  how they switch it. Remember how they were talking about how globalism was nothing but
[03:11:50.420 --> 03:11:55.860]  a conspiracy theory? Then during this election, they came out and they said, no, no, globalism
[03:11:55.860 --> 03:12:01.020]  is a good thing. You should want globalism. Look at all the advantages of globalism and
[03:12:01.020 --> 03:12:05.900]  then when they got defeated on globalism versus Americanism, they came back and said globalism
[03:12:05.900 --> 03:12:08.540]  is a conspiracy theory again.
[03:12:08.540 --> 03:12:13.940]  See, they change whatever they're saying to fit their agenda time and again. And we need
[03:12:13.940 --> 03:12:17.620]  to understand when we look at what happened with the NDAA. And again, you want to talk
[03:12:17.620 --> 03:12:23.740]  about fake news? Let's talk about the NDAA. That is fake security. It's not real security.
[03:12:23.740 --> 03:12:27.140]  When they take away your Fourth Amendment, when they take away your due process, when
[03:12:27.140 --> 03:12:32.740]  they say we're going to have indefinite detention without trial. That's fake security. When
[03:12:32.740 --> 03:12:38.820]  you sacrifice your liberty, when you sacrifice your fundamental human rights, your protections
[03:12:38.820 --> 03:12:44.340]  against government abuses for the promise of security, you will never get safe. You will
[03:12:44.340 --> 03:12:45.340]  never have security.
[03:12:45.340 --> 03:12:50.180]  As I've said many times, when you give up your liberty and your freedom and your dignity
[03:12:50.180 --> 03:12:56.100]  as a human being, to that extent, you become a nameless slave. And nameless slaves are
[03:12:56.100 --> 03:13:00.780]  never safe, they're never secure. And yet we have these same people like Senator Rob
[03:13:00.780 --> 03:13:05.220]  Portman, who if remember going back to the election, he came out and he endorsed Donald
[03:13:05.220 --> 03:13:06.220]  Trump.
[03:13:06.220 --> 03:13:10.060]  And then the beginning of October, he said, no, no, no, I have to withdraw my support
[03:13:10.060 --> 03:13:15.860]  of Donald Trump. This is the same guy who's a co-author of this propaganda bill, turning
[03:13:15.860 --> 03:13:22.220]  the State Department into a Ministry of Truth. How are we? Listen to this, the State Department
[03:13:22.220 --> 03:13:26.860]  is going to coordinate and synchronize counter propaganda efforts. Again, this is an article
[03:13:26.860 --> 03:13:32.820]  by Zero Hedge that's up on infowars.com. Senate quietly passes the quote unquote, countering
[03:13:32.820 --> 03:13:35.380]  disinformation and propaganda act.
[03:13:35.380 --> 03:13:40.500]  This was something that was put together by Rob Portman and a Democrat, Chris Murphy
[03:13:40.500 --> 03:13:44.500]  of Connecticut. They put this thing together. And then on Thursday, before the vote on
[03:13:44.500 --> 03:13:49.820]  Friday for the NDAA, they quietly snuck this thing in. So they can stick all this stuff
[03:13:49.820 --> 03:13:55.220]  in to these security bills because they know that virtually everybody is going to vote
[03:13:55.220 --> 03:13:59.440]  for the Defense Authorization Act, that's what funds the military.
[03:13:59.440 --> 03:14:05.860]  So they load this up, not with pork spending anymore, but with liberty killing amendments.
[03:14:05.860 --> 03:14:11.100]  The place where they hung out with the indefinite detention, now they're sticking in the Orwellian
[03:14:11.100 --> 03:14:16.780]  Truth Department that's going to put out fact-based narratives. And of course, this is all going
[03:14:16.780 --> 03:14:23.900]  to save us from foreigners using fear of others, the Auslander, that's the way the Germans
[03:14:23.900 --> 03:14:28.700]  did it, that's the way Hadoff Hitler did it, the foreigner, got to save us from the foreigners.
[03:14:28.700 --> 03:14:32.620]  So they're going to set up the State Department, they're going to coordinate and synchronize
[03:14:32.620 --> 03:14:37.140]  counter propaganda efforts. Well, those are actually propaganda efforts, aren't they?
[03:14:37.140 --> 03:14:41.140]  They're not truth. They're going to be the ones to determine what is fact and what is
[03:14:41.140 --> 03:14:46.740]  fake. And they're going to fund this, guess what, through contracts to NGOs. Does that
[03:14:46.740 --> 03:14:51.820]  sound familiar? That's the way George Soros operates and his color revolutions is through
[03:14:51.820 --> 03:14:57.220]  NGOs. And of course, it's also the way George Soros operates to delegitimize elections. That's
[03:14:57.220 --> 03:15:01.700]  where the color revolutions always began. We've been saying this from right after the
[03:15:01.700 --> 03:15:05.660]  election as soon as they started the riots. We said, oh, this looks familiar, doesn't it?
[03:15:05.660 --> 03:15:11.020]  We're saying irate, ignorant, useful idiots, college students typically, because that's
[03:15:11.020 --> 03:15:16.540]  the best way to describe most of the colleges, using them to start a revolution and to say
[03:15:16.540 --> 03:15:22.280]  that the election is not legitimate. So they've moved from riots to recounts, and now they're
[03:15:22.280 --> 03:15:25.980]  moving to the electoral college saying, well, we didn't like that electoral college, we
[03:15:25.980 --> 03:15:29.220]  just wanted to have a direct election. But now we're going to throw out the votes of
[03:15:29.220 --> 03:15:32.900]  the general people. Listen to what they're saying. They're going to fund and train local
[03:15:32.900 --> 03:15:37.500]  journalists. They're going to provide grants. This is State Department. They're going to
[03:15:37.500 --> 03:15:42.860]  provide grants and contracts to NGOs, to civil society organizations, to think tanks, to
[03:15:42.860 --> 03:15:48.420]  private sector companies, to media organizations and other experts outside the US government,
[03:15:48.420 --> 03:15:53.980]  the people who will be part of the US government's propaganda expert. They're going to private,
[03:15:53.980 --> 03:15:59.620]  it's going to be a public private partnership for propaganda. That's precisely what this
[03:15:59.620 --> 03:16:03.420]  is, folks. You want to know what it is? That's what it is. That's the thing we have to watch
[03:16:03.420 --> 03:16:07.300]  out for when it comes to our infrastructure, these private public partnerships, which is
[03:16:07.300 --> 03:16:10.780]  just a fancy name for crony capitalism. Well, what they're going to do is they're going
[03:16:10.780 --> 03:16:16.380]  to create a private public partnership for propaganda, the PPPP. That's what it's really
[03:16:16.380 --> 03:16:19.860]  going to be. Let's just talk about it and understand that's where this is. And let's
[03:16:19.860 --> 03:16:27.020]  understand that this is not a reaction to the hack of the DNC emails. This has been
[03:16:27.020 --> 03:16:30.420]  in development for multiple years. This has been in development since before I came to
[03:16:30.420 --> 03:16:34.940]  Infowars. And I've been here for four years. And then it hit the big time in 2013, when
[03:16:34.940 --> 03:16:38.940]  they repealed the Smith-Mundt Act, which authorized Voice of America and these other
[03:16:38.940 --> 03:16:43.340]  propaganda organizations, but said, no, you're not going to put that fake crap here in America.
[03:16:43.340 --> 03:16:49.500]  But now they want the fake crap here in America. They want to fund it big time, bigly. Okay.
[03:16:49.500 --> 03:16:53.820]  Big League. Let's go to some of your comments here. Let's talk to Chris in Virginia. Chris,
[03:16:53.820 --> 03:17:02.100]  go ahead. Yeah, I wanted to talk about conflict of interest because I have never heard so
[03:17:02.100 --> 03:17:07.660]  much talk of conflict of interest. That's why it makes me that when they criticize whoever
[03:17:07.660 --> 03:17:11.380]  Trump picks or cabinet, that's what let me know them. People are actually going to do
[03:17:11.380 --> 03:17:17.260]  their job. It's somebody that they would accept or like wholeheartedly that I will have a
[03:17:17.260 --> 03:17:20.980]  problem with because it seems right to me that they're just having to sit because they
[03:17:20.980 --> 03:17:25.020]  know these people are finally going to put the money that's been going to these fat
[03:17:25.020 --> 03:17:29.340]  cats in the right place. And I think that's a big problem that's really got them on scared
[03:17:29.340 --> 03:17:30.340]  factor.
[03:17:30.340 --> 03:17:33.580]  Well, that's the one thing that they can say about somebody who actually knows something
[03:17:33.580 --> 03:17:37.740]  about the area that they would be regulating. Now, of course, we've seen with the Attorney
[03:17:37.740 --> 03:17:41.820]  General that was put in place of the EPA, they're not going to be able to get conflict
[03:17:41.820 --> 03:17:46.940]  of interest against him because he's not really come from a business background. But it's
[03:17:46.940 --> 03:17:50.620]  very important to have people who actually know how the world works rather than a community
[03:17:50.620 --> 03:17:51.620]  organizer.
[03:17:51.620 --> 03:17:54.340]  And I thought it was interesting. You talk about conflict of interest. Rand Paul came
[03:17:54.340 --> 03:17:58.380]  out this weekend when he was interviewed and he said, hey, I don't think it's really fair
[03:17:58.380 --> 03:18:05.620]  to require Donald Trump to try in a fire sale to diverse himself of all of these many different
[03:18:05.620 --> 03:18:09.620]  industries that he's involved in. He goes, people knew that he owned all these companies
[03:18:09.620 --> 03:18:10.620]  when they voted for him.
[03:18:10.620 --> 03:18:14.100]  I mean, how do you feel about that? I think that is going to be a major line of attack
[03:18:14.100 --> 03:18:19.220]  on Donald Trump once he becomes president. They're going to come after him. As you pointed
[03:18:19.220 --> 03:18:22.180]  out with conflict of interest on this and conflict of interest on that, they're going
[03:18:22.180 --> 03:18:25.180]  to be finding a conflict of interest in everything that he does.
[03:18:25.180 --> 03:18:30.340]  Yeah, I totally agree with that. It just seems like to me like they're just making a big
[03:18:30.340 --> 03:18:35.300]  fuss out of nothing. We never had anything like this. It just seems like to me it's
[03:18:35.300 --> 03:18:39.900]  easy to tell that a lot of people that don't want him to let the money go to the right
[03:18:39.900 --> 03:18:44.500]  places that they need to be. And for you personally, keep making them run.
[03:18:44.500 --> 03:18:49.420]  Yeah, they're not going to stop in terms of trying to delegitimize everything that Donald
[03:18:49.420 --> 03:18:53.780]  Trump does. Not only the election, but this and this is always going to roll. I want to
[03:18:53.780 --> 03:19:00.540]  take more of your calls in the next segment. Again, that number is going to be 800-259-9231

[03:19:20.740 --> 03:19:25.300]  us independent of these people and we are the tip of the spear. You understand? They
[03:19:25.300 --> 03:19:30.780]  started this whole thing years ago. They started it before the election and it wouldn't be
[03:19:30.780 --> 03:19:35.180]  about Donald Trump at this moment. It would simply be about us, but we're number two in
[03:19:35.180 --> 03:19:39.140]  line because they already started talking about Alex Jones and Info Wars, majored on
[03:19:39.140 --> 03:19:44.740]  us all of last week. They're trying to delegitimize any voices except the government approved
[03:19:44.740 --> 03:20:10.700]  media. So stay with us. We're going to be right back with your phone calls.

[03:24:15.740 --> 03:24:20.540]  I'm going to go back to our colors. Mike Joshua, Bob, Mike, Antoine, hang on. I'm going to
[03:24:20.540 --> 03:24:24.860]  get to you in just a moment. As I was mentioning before we went to the break, now is the time
[03:24:24.860 --> 03:24:30.220]  that we really need your support. We are taking the brunt of the attacks as you saw last week
[03:24:30.220 --> 03:24:35.460]  in terms of the attacks on free speech. This is an all-out attack on free speech. I don't
[03:24:35.460 --> 03:24:38.500]  think this had anything to do as I've pointed out many times. This is something that's been
[03:24:38.500 --> 03:24:43.100]  rolling out for years. This was the time that we're really going to make this fall into
[03:24:43.100 --> 03:24:48.700]  online. Because Hillary Clinton didn't win. Because you didn't buy their phony narrative.
[03:24:48.700 --> 03:24:53.020]  Because Donald Trump won. He is now taking the brunt of this. They're trying to delegitimize
[03:24:53.020 --> 03:24:58.540]  his election. And they are trying to delegitimize the press. And social media. Talking about
[03:24:58.540 --> 03:25:03.820]  how social media was weaponized in this last election. That means you folks, they're coming
[03:25:03.820 --> 03:25:08.540]  after you. They want to shut down your speech. They want to shut down our speech. They want
[03:25:08.540 --> 03:25:12.580]  to shut down info wars. So we need your support. We're grateful for your support. And we have

[03:25:37.380 --> 03:25:42.100]  especially this time of year when you don't get the natural vitamin D that you would
[03:25:42.100 --> 03:25:46.060]  normally get with the sun exposure because of winter, because you're indoors more, because
[03:25:46.060 --> 03:25:51.340]  you're more bundled up. This is very important to keep up your vitamin D3 levels. And again,
[03:25:51.340 --> 03:25:56.420]  it's a very good source of vitamin D3, not the synthetic stuff, not the D2 that you get
[03:25:56.420 --> 03:26:02.700]  with a lot of supplements. Winter sun, vitamin D, 25% off. Survival shield, X2, nascent iodine,
[03:26:02.700 --> 03:26:08.820]  30% off. 30% off. Biotru, selenium, a very essential mineral for you to have. And of
[03:26:08.820 --> 03:26:15.140]  course, store-wide, free shipping on everything, everything, free shipping. That's our Christmas
[03:26:15.140 --> 03:26:21.540]  Super Sale. We have now taken it live at infowarslife.com. This is a 360 win, folks.
[03:26:21.540 --> 03:26:26.900]  We have to fight this together. Just as we have to support Donald Trump as he is being
[03:26:26.900 --> 03:26:32.580]  attacked with this false narrative about the election. I just cannot believe how they're
[03:26:32.580 --> 03:26:37.220]  using and abusing and misrepresenting the Electoral College. It's absolutely amazing.
[03:26:37.220 --> 03:26:42.220]  But I want to get your comments. Let's go to Mike in England. Go ahead, Mike.
[03:26:42.220 --> 03:26:44.220]  Hello, David. Hey.
[03:26:44.220 --> 03:26:50.580]  Hey, there's great analysis. I always look forward to your opening analysis. It's great.
[03:26:50.580 --> 03:26:54.900]  I spoke, actually, been a couple of months now. I spoke to the presidential press office
[03:26:54.900 --> 03:27:00.260]  for Putin. And they said they'd be open to an interview. And you guys would be the perfect
[03:27:00.260 --> 03:27:04.340]  ones to do it. And I think this is part of what Alex was asking earlier. What do we do
[03:27:04.340 --> 03:27:08.780]  to go in the offense? I think going on the offense is actually putting Putin's face
[03:27:08.780 --> 03:27:14.380]  on American TVs and having an interview on an American platform where people can actually
[03:27:14.380 --> 03:27:20.500]  see him and hear him because he's a statesman in contrast to the jokers and clowns that
[03:27:20.500 --> 03:27:23.420]  we have, the embarrassments that we have.
[03:27:23.420 --> 03:27:31.060]  Yeah, it would be interesting. I know when they asked Putin about the training exercises
[03:27:31.060 --> 03:27:34.860]  that they said were going on right at the border, you know, this massive buildup of
[03:27:34.860 --> 03:27:39.700]  NATO exercises. Well, this is just training. There's no message behind this. And it just
[03:27:39.700 --> 03:27:44.020]  started laughing like, come on, I'm not that stupid. Nobody is that stupid. We understand
[03:27:44.020 --> 03:27:49.860]  when that's being done that it's intimidation. And, you know, quite frankly, right after
[03:27:49.860 --> 03:27:54.940]  the election, I covered this. There was a town. It was a Daily Mail story. There was
[03:27:54.940 --> 03:28:00.900]  a town in Russia and they started the people there, started a petition wanting to rename
[03:28:00.900 --> 03:28:06.260]  a street to Donald Trump. Interestingly enough, the name of the street now is Godless Street.
[03:28:06.260 --> 03:28:10.620]  It was named that by the communists because they were proudly atheist and they wanted
[03:28:10.620 --> 03:28:13.540]  to put that out there. So they named the street Godless Street. So they want to change the
[03:28:13.540 --> 03:28:18.260]  name from Godless Street to Donald Trump Street. That was their petition. Why? Because they
[03:28:18.260 --> 03:28:22.980]  realized that the Obama administration, that Hillary Clinton, that the globalists, both
[03:28:22.980 --> 03:28:28.940]  Republicans and Democrats, had put a loaded gun to their head. They're trying to push
[03:28:28.940 --> 03:28:33.500]  not only for a Russian reset, which is reset of the Cold War, but they wanted to push right
[03:28:33.500 --> 03:28:39.860]  up to the brink of World War III. And they feel like, they understand what it's like.
[03:28:39.860 --> 03:28:44.740]  They're not naive like Americans. They felt the full brunt of World War II in their country.
[03:28:44.740 --> 03:28:49.340]  You know, the closest that we got was Pearl Harbor. And that was something that really,
[03:28:49.340 --> 03:28:53.900]  we just passed that anniversary. Americans that had a big effect on them. I remember
[03:28:53.900 --> 03:28:58.740]  my parents talking about that. That was the time that they were just a young married couple
[03:28:58.740 --> 03:29:03.500]  when that happened. And my dad then signed up to the military. That was something that
[03:29:03.500 --> 03:29:07.300]  they lived through. But that was not anything at all like what the Russian people lived
[03:29:07.300 --> 03:29:13.260]  through in World War II. So they took it very seriously. All of this, beating the drums
[03:29:13.260 --> 03:29:17.740]  of war that were done by Obama and Hillary Clinton. And they believe that they dodged
[03:29:17.740 --> 03:29:23.180]  the bullet. I also was interviewed by a Russian press organization, Zargrad TV. And they
[03:29:23.180 --> 03:29:27.780]  felt the same way. They were ecstatic that Donald Trump had won. Well, he hasn't become
[03:29:27.780 --> 03:29:31.540]  president yet, as Michael Moore pointed out. And we have to understand what their tactics
[03:29:31.540 --> 03:29:37.020]  are and I hope he will directly confront their tactics and talk about it just as he did,
[03:29:37.020 --> 03:29:41.100]  the attempt to overthrow the election at the primary level. That's what they're trying
[03:29:41.100 --> 03:29:44.140]  again now. It didn't work then. I don't think it's going to work now, but we're going to
[03:29:44.140 --> 03:29:46.980]  have to directly confront it. Stay with us. We'll be back with more of your phone calls.
[03:29:46.980 --> 03:29:59.780]  I'm David Knight.
[03:29:59.780 --> 03:30:05.500]  Why is the CIA pushing this ridiculous conspiracy theory? Reports of Russian officials intervening
[03:30:05.500 --> 03:30:09.940]  in the American presidential election have been industriously circulated for months. The
[03:30:09.940 --> 03:30:14.500]  FBI, DHS, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence are all looking at
[03:30:14.500 --> 03:30:18.780]  the same allegations and all of the agencies came up with the same foregone conclusion.
[03:30:18.780 --> 03:30:23.180]  Vladimir Putin's government deliberately interfered with America's presidential election. The
[03:30:23.180 --> 03:30:27.700]  laughable insinuation was reiterated this morning in an article published in The Hill,
[03:30:27.700 --> 03:30:31.700]  attacking President-elect Donald Trump for casting doubt on their assessment, concluding
[03:30:31.700 --> 03:30:35.100]  that Russia intervened in the election to help him win the White House. Trump tweeted
[03:30:35.100 --> 03:30:39.620]  out, Can you imagine if the election results were opposite and we tried to play the Russia
[03:30:39.620 --> 03:30:44.340]  CIA card? Keep in mind this is the same CIA that asserted false claims against Saddam
[03:30:44.340 --> 03:30:48.700]  Hussein and led us into the invasion of Iraq. With a track record like that, one must take
[03:30:48.700 --> 03:30:52.500]  their assessments with a serious grain of salt and question the motivation of these
[03:30:52.500 --> 03:31:20.980]  agencies. I'm Margaret Helve, reporting for Infowars.com.

[03:33:01.300 --> 03:33:16.300]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:16.300 --> 03:33:20.300]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host for the rest of this fourth hour.
[03:33:20.300 --> 03:33:26.300]  We're taking your phone calls and if you want to call in and comment on what's going on with the attacks
[03:33:26.300 --> 03:33:33.300]  about the legitimacy of the election, the electoral college or comment on the cabinet picks that we've seen
[03:33:33.300 --> 03:33:39.300]  Donald Trump pick so far or some of the ones that are coming up, that number is 800-259-9231.
[03:33:39.300 --> 03:33:47.300]  Again, that's 800-259-9231. Let's go to Joshua in Georgia. Go ahead, Joshua.
[03:33:47.300 --> 03:33:52.300]  Yes, thank you for taking my call, David, and God bless you guys for everything you guys are doing.
[03:33:52.300 --> 03:34:00.300]  I wanted to talk about this illusion that's being put out by, I guess, what we like to call the CUC servitors
[03:34:00.300 --> 03:34:10.300]  that are continually being put on CNN, ABC. Back in the day, in 2009 and 2010, I used to listen to Glenn Beck on Fox News
[03:34:10.300 --> 03:34:16.300]  and then I was introduced to you guys by a buddy of mine and I've been listening to you guys ever since.
[03:34:16.300 --> 03:34:22.300]  I saw that Glenn Beck really utilized a lot of your information, almost verbatim.
[03:34:22.300 --> 03:34:27.300]  Oh, yeah, there was a guy back when I first started here. We had a film contest at Alex.
[03:34:27.300 --> 03:34:31.300]  If you remember, it was about $100,000. There was a guy, I think it was out of Australia.
[03:34:31.300 --> 03:34:38.300]  He basically put a clip of Alex saying something with a date and then Glenn Beck saying it like six months
[03:34:38.300 --> 03:34:41.300]  or a year or two years later, exactly the same thing, put him back to back.
[03:34:41.300 --> 03:34:45.300]  It was pretty amazing to document that, but of course, Rolling Stone did the same thing as well.
[03:34:45.300 --> 03:34:46.300]  Go ahead.
[03:34:46.300 --> 03:34:52.300]  Yes, and so now Glenn Beck has changed his course.
[03:34:52.300 --> 03:34:58.300]  Obviously, he keeps attacking Alex Jones. He attacks Breitbart, attacks Drudge.
[03:34:58.300 --> 03:35:04.300]  Says he's a conservative, but now he's going on ABC and CNN and apologizing saying he's made mistakes
[03:35:04.300 --> 03:35:13.300]  and to beware of the alt-right and to beware of Richard Spencer saying that him and Steve Bannon
[03:35:13.300 --> 03:35:16.300]  are white nationalists and he's quoting from the LA Times.
[03:35:16.300 --> 03:35:22.300]  He's saying he has all this documentation about them and really putting a lot of misinformation out there,
[03:35:22.300 --> 03:35:27.300]  but I can't verify stuff he's saying. Do you know anything about this Richard Spencer guy?
[03:35:27.300 --> 03:35:31.300]  No, I don't know anything about him, and I don't like the label alt-right.
[03:35:31.300 --> 03:35:38.300]  I don't accept that label for myself. I'm a libertarian, actually a paleo-libertarian,
[03:35:38.300 --> 03:35:39.300]  if you want to get more specific about it.
[03:35:39.300 --> 03:35:43.300]  Hey, I wonder what Glenn Beck thinks about his false messiah Ted Cruz.
[03:35:43.300 --> 03:35:48.300]  You know, false messiah Ted Cruz voted for the NDAA on Friday.
[03:35:48.300 --> 03:35:55.300]  So we've seen, haven't we, the Sixth Amendment, our due process amendment shredded by the NDAA
[03:35:55.300 --> 03:35:59.300]  when it first was put in there. What was that on the 20, 2012 I think.
[03:35:59.300 --> 03:36:04.300]  They put that in there to say you're going to have indefinite attention by the military without trial.
[03:36:04.300 --> 03:36:09.300]  That was something that a few people spoke out against, but not Ted Cruz anymore.
[03:36:09.300 --> 03:36:15.300]  And now when they come out and say we're going to turn the State Department into an official propaganda unit
[03:36:15.300 --> 03:36:21.300]  and we're going to let them allocate money to preferred private organizations and NGOs,
[03:36:21.300 --> 03:36:23.300]  then Ted Cruz votes for that as well.
[03:36:23.300 --> 03:36:28.300]  So he's now voted for the shredding of the Sixth Amendment, the shredding of the First Amendment.
[03:36:28.300 --> 03:36:31.300]  And this is a guy who said he was all about the Constitution.
[03:36:31.300 --> 03:36:37.300]  What a fraud and what a fraud Glenn Beck is for saying that he had a word from God
[03:36:37.300 --> 03:36:42.300]  that God had chosen Ted Cruz to be president, the false messiah.
[03:36:42.300 --> 03:36:45.300]  So I've seen this from Glenn Beck.
[03:36:45.300 --> 03:36:50.300]  I saw the lies that he was putting out about what happened at the Bundy standoff.
[03:36:50.300 --> 03:36:57.300]  I saw how he tried to apply the label of sovereign citizen to Clive and Bundy
[03:36:57.300 --> 03:37:02.300]  who had absolutely no idea that that was a loaded term that had been loaded up by law enforcement
[03:37:02.300 --> 03:37:05.300]  to sound like he was a dangerous revolutionary.
[03:37:05.300 --> 03:37:10.300]  He tried to throw him under the bus with that and now he's out there using loaded terms
[03:37:10.300 --> 03:37:15.300]  like the alt-right trying to paint other people in the media as racist.
[03:37:15.300 --> 03:37:18.300]  This is the tactic of Glenn Beck.
[03:37:18.300 --> 03:37:23.300]  This guy has been a phony conservative, a phony libertarian, a phony Christian from day one.
[03:37:23.300 --> 03:37:28.300]  Everything about that man is phony and a lie and so I'm not surprised at all that he's out there
[03:37:28.300 --> 03:37:31.300]  whoring himself out to the mainstream media.
[03:37:31.300 --> 03:37:36.300]  Anybody that will put him on because his media empire is collapsing and he's looking for a job.
[03:37:36.300 --> 03:37:37.300]  That's about all I got.
[03:37:37.300 --> 03:37:40.300]  So you want to say anything else, Joshua?
[03:37:40.300 --> 03:37:44.300]  No, I would love to hear your viewpoints.
[03:37:44.300 --> 03:37:46.300]  I know you guys really do the in-depth research.
[03:37:46.300 --> 03:37:51.300]  He keeps bringing up a gentleman named Richard Spencer, having a relationship with Breitbart and Steve Bannon
[03:37:51.300 --> 03:37:56.300]  and that's where he's really trying to hone in on the alt-right being this racist thing
[03:37:56.300 --> 03:37:59.300]  and he's really selling this thing on a daily basis.
[03:37:59.300 --> 03:38:01.300]  If you guys were able to potentially put a piece together on that
[03:38:01.300 --> 03:38:07.300]  just so I can send that out to my Cuck's Servative friends that keep trying to debate me, that would be awesome.
[03:38:07.300 --> 03:38:14.300]  Well, I know that some of the people who are white nationalists have proudly embraced the label alt-right
[03:38:14.300 --> 03:38:20.300]  and I haven't seen any definition of it but I know that's the way that they're trying to paint everybody who takes that label.
[03:38:20.300 --> 03:38:22.300]  I'm not alternate and I'm not right-wing.
[03:38:22.300 --> 03:38:29.300]  When I was a libertarian, I took a great deal of exception to people who called me a right-wing nut.
[03:38:29.300 --> 03:38:33.300]  I said, I'm not right-wing. I'm a libertarian.
[03:38:33.300 --> 03:38:37.300]  I reject your false left-right dichotomy and I'm not a nut either, okay?
[03:38:37.300 --> 03:38:41.300]  We back up what we have to say here, unlike Glenn Beck, but we know exactly what he's about.
[03:38:41.300 --> 03:38:43.300]  Let's go to Bob in Pennsylvania.
[03:38:43.300 --> 03:38:45.300]  Bob, go ahead.
[03:38:45.300 --> 03:38:47.300]  It's great to talk to you.
[03:38:47.300 --> 03:38:54.300]  I have an interesting story about that. Glenn Beck, but first I wanted to talk about something a little bit different.
[03:38:54.300 --> 03:39:05.300]  I consider myself a foot soldier in the Information War and as a foot soldier, I know that I'm not always going to get direction from above.
[03:39:05.300 --> 03:39:13.300]  So I have to figure out what I can do on my own and what I did this morning was I called my Democratic Congressman
[03:39:13.300 --> 03:39:21.300]  and wanted to know what they're going to do about the people that are trying to commit treason in a Democratic Party.
[03:39:21.300 --> 03:39:26.300]  I think we have to put pressure on Congress wherever we have an opportunity.
[03:39:26.300 --> 03:39:29.300]  And I'm also going to be making up my sign.
[03:39:29.300 --> 03:39:34.300]  Trump is my president. I live close enough to D.C., maybe five hours.
[03:39:34.300 --> 03:39:39.300]  I'm going to be driving down there and I will be on the steps of Congress now and then.
[03:39:39.300 --> 03:39:47.300]  I think you hit the nail right on the head. Remember how they were saying before the election when we were talking about concerns that we had about electronic voting machines,
[03:39:47.300 --> 03:39:54.300]  concerns we had about voter fraud allowing people who are not legitimate voters to come in and vote and they were shutting these things down.
[03:39:54.300 --> 03:39:56.300]  We said, wait, you shouldn't be doing that.
[03:39:56.300 --> 03:40:01.300]  And they said, how dare you question the legitimacy of the election?
[03:40:01.300 --> 03:40:05.300]  That is treason if you do that sort of thing. And now who is doing it? They're doing it.
[03:40:05.300 --> 03:40:09.300]  At the same time, immediately after the election, they were coming out and saying, oh, this is horrible.
[03:40:09.300 --> 03:40:15.300]  We have an electoral college and Hillary Clinton is winning by a half million, by a million, by a million and a half.
[03:40:15.300 --> 03:40:20.300]  It just kept going up, right? Because it was being padded by these corrupt jurisdictions.
[03:40:20.300 --> 03:40:24.300]  And that's precisely what the electoral college was set up to avoid.
[03:40:24.300 --> 03:40:30.300]  And so now they're saying, no, we want the electoral college to overturn what the voters did.
[03:40:30.300 --> 03:40:35.300]  They're complaining that the electoral college was going to overturn what the voters did.
[03:40:35.300 --> 03:40:38.300]  Now they're saying they want the electoral college to overturn what the voters did.
[03:40:38.300 --> 03:40:42.300]  See, they changed their position to get what they want.
[03:40:42.300 --> 03:40:46.300]  And there's no consistency in what they say, and there's no truth in what they say.
[03:40:46.300 --> 03:40:48.300]  And of course, it's all politically motivated.
[03:40:48.300 --> 03:40:58.300]  We see the electors who are now calling for a briefing by the CIA as the daughter of Nancy Pelosi as part of this group that's calling for it.
[03:40:58.300 --> 03:41:00.300]  Okay, that's the way this thing is rolling out.
[03:41:00.300 --> 03:41:03.300]  It is nothing other than an attempt to discredit the election.
[03:41:03.300 --> 03:41:08.300]  And they will say one thing this week and they will say 180 degrees different next week.
[03:41:08.300 --> 03:41:11.300]  They'll completely switch and reverse their opinion.
[03:41:11.300 --> 03:41:16.300]  Anything that they can to disrupt the election to delegitimize Donald Trump's election.
[03:41:16.300 --> 03:41:19.300]  And that's why he needs to go on the attack.
[03:41:19.300 --> 03:41:21.300]  He needs to address this directly.
[03:41:21.300 --> 03:41:24.300]  We've seen this happen before at the primary level and they're doing it again.
[03:41:24.300 --> 03:41:26.300]  This is a very dangerous thing.
[03:41:26.300 --> 03:41:32.300]  As I said before, I think they believe they can get away with it or they would not be coming out and saying this in the way that they are.
[03:41:32.300 --> 03:41:35.300]  People in the CIA coming out and saying that.
[03:41:35.300 --> 03:41:37.300]  That's a very amazing thing.
[03:41:37.300 --> 03:41:38.300]  Thank you, Bob.
[03:41:38.300 --> 03:41:40.300]  Was there anything else that you wanted to say?
[03:41:40.300 --> 03:41:44.300]  Yeah, we have the greatest country in the world and now is not the time to sit back.
[03:41:44.300 --> 03:41:52.300]  If you can think of something to do to put the word outside Alex's petition or whatever.
[03:41:52.300 --> 03:41:56.300]  But now is the time to act.
[03:41:56.300 --> 03:41:59.300]  I wanted to tell you something about Mr. Glenn Beck.
[03:41:59.300 --> 03:42:05.300]  I think when his career was first starting, he wrote a book called The Christmas Sweater.
[03:42:05.300 --> 03:42:09.300]  It was sort of like a book on his life.
[03:42:09.300 --> 03:42:16.300]  In that book, he tells a story about how his mother was killed in a car crash, which never happened.
[03:42:16.300 --> 03:42:20.300]  That will tell you how low of a scum this person is.
[03:42:20.300 --> 03:42:22.300]  The worst of the worst.
[03:42:22.300 --> 03:42:23.300]  Yeah, Mr. Fake News.
[03:42:23.300 --> 03:42:24.300]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:42:24.300 --> 03:42:25.300]  That's amazing.
[03:42:25.300 --> 03:42:27.300]  Of course, he does love his sweaters, doesn't he?
[03:42:27.300 --> 03:42:31.300]  He likes to get that, who is the guy on public TV?
[03:42:31.300 --> 03:42:32.300]  Mr. Rogers.
[03:42:32.300 --> 03:42:34.300]  He likes that Mr. Rogers vibe going.
[03:42:34.300 --> 03:42:36.300]  He tries to get that going all the time.
[03:42:36.300 --> 03:42:37.300]  Thank you, Bob.
[03:42:37.300 --> 03:42:41.300]  When we look at this election, and one of the things I think is unfortunate about this.
[03:42:41.300 --> 03:42:48.300]  I said after the election, I said, let's do continue on and look at the specifics that Donald Trump,
[03:42:48.300 --> 03:42:51.300]  that we were talking about before the election.
[03:42:51.300 --> 03:42:54.300]  Let's make sure that we've got legitimate voters.
[03:42:54.300 --> 03:43:01.300]  Let's make sure that we don't open ourselves up to massive fraud by manipulation of voting machines,
[03:43:01.300 --> 03:43:03.300]  by manipulation of the vote totals.
[03:43:03.300 --> 03:43:05.300]  And of course, we've had that type of thing happen.
[03:43:05.300 --> 03:43:10.300]  Let's make sure that we have the mechanisms in place to do an audit of an election,
[03:43:10.300 --> 03:43:16.300]  which we've had the Texas director of elections here shut down ever since he became the director of elections,
[03:43:16.300 --> 03:43:21.300]  to shut down the ability to do a recount if it's coming from one of these electronic voting machines.
[03:43:21.300 --> 03:43:23.300]  And so we said, let's take a look at this.
[03:43:23.300 --> 03:43:28.300]  Now is the time as victors that we can come in and say this, look, we won the election,
[03:43:28.300 --> 03:43:30.300]  but we want to make the election more honest.
[03:43:30.300 --> 03:43:34.300]  Let's use that and not be accused of being sore losers.
[03:43:34.300 --> 03:43:42.300]  But what we've seen with Jill Stein is that she has focused on this in a way that is really delegitimizing the concerns
[03:43:42.300 --> 03:43:45.300]  about voter fraud, about election fraud.
[03:43:45.300 --> 03:43:48.300]  And that's one of the things that I'm most angry about with Jill Stein,
[03:43:48.300 --> 03:43:56.300]  is that she is giving a black eye to genuine efforts to try to correct the elements that have been put in
[03:43:56.300 --> 03:44:00.300]  that systematically invite fraud, whether it happens or not.
[03:44:00.300 --> 03:44:01.300]  She says, well, we think it might have happened.
[03:44:01.300 --> 03:44:03.300]  It's like, yeah, we think it can happen too.
[03:44:03.300 --> 03:44:05.300]  So let's do something about that.
[03:44:05.300 --> 03:44:09.300]  But instead she used it, she became a shill for Hillary.
[03:44:09.300 --> 03:44:13.300]  As I point out, Jill, the shill went up the hill to carrying Hillary's water.
[03:44:13.300 --> 03:44:15.300]  She's falling down now, okay?
[03:44:15.300 --> 03:44:19.300]  She's broken her crown and she has the results of this,
[03:44:19.300 --> 03:44:24.300]  is that she's delegitimized genuine concerns and real things that we should be doing
[03:44:24.300 --> 03:44:29.300]  to make sure that we have fair, honest, audible elections in the future.
[03:44:29.300 --> 03:44:33.300]  So she, I think, really abused that position there where she didn't really have any standing.
[03:44:33.300 --> 03:44:35.300]  Let's go to Mike in Indiana.
[03:44:35.300 --> 03:44:37.300]  Go ahead, Mike.
[03:44:37.300 --> 03:44:39.300]  Hey, David, thanks for taking my call.
[03:44:39.300 --> 03:44:41.300]  Well, thank you for calling.
[03:44:41.300 --> 03:44:43.300]  Yes, and can you hear me?
[03:44:43.300 --> 03:44:45.300]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:44:45.300 --> 03:44:51.300]  When I wrote my first pamphlet back in the early 80s of billions for the bankers,
[03:44:51.300 --> 03:44:56.300]  debts for the people, I was awakened of what the global agenda was.
[03:44:56.300 --> 03:45:00.300]  And just like anybody else, I kind of fell asleep.
[03:45:00.300 --> 03:45:05.300]  And a good friend of mine gave me one of the Alice's CDs and I listened to it
[03:45:05.300 --> 03:45:08.300]  and I've been awake ever since and I'm going to stay awake.
[03:45:08.300 --> 03:45:12.300]  And you know something, I'm actually from northwest Indiana,
[03:45:12.300 --> 03:45:19.300]  which is a stone straw from Chicago, which is probably the worst corrupt part of the state.
[03:45:19.300 --> 03:45:23.300]  You know, we have a bigger lead problem here than they do in Michigan,
[03:45:23.300 --> 03:45:28.300]  but you don't see anything that on the national news network and stuff like that.
[03:45:28.300 --> 03:45:30.300]  Yeah.
[03:45:30.300 --> 03:45:36.300]  So, you know, and I mean, the news media is really fake.
[03:45:36.300 --> 03:45:41.300]  Well, and you know, when you're talking about the problems that you got there being close to Chicago,
[03:45:41.300 --> 03:45:46.300]  I mean, you know how they've been involved in rigging the presidential election in the past or for JFK and so forth.
[03:45:46.300 --> 03:45:49.300]  That was what the Electoral College, part of what it's about.
[03:45:49.300 --> 03:45:54.300]  It's about making sure that we have a regional representation for everybody,
[03:45:54.300 --> 03:45:59.300]  that you don't have your vote if you live outside of New York, Chicago, or LA,
[03:45:59.300 --> 03:46:05.300]  that your vote is not completely eradicated by a dishonest, corrupt, big city machine,
[03:46:05.300 --> 03:46:12.300]  like we see in Chicago, where they can continue to pad the votes for weeks in favor of one candidate.
[03:46:12.300 --> 03:46:15.300]  That's what we don't want to have. That's why we have the Electoral College.
[03:46:15.300 --> 03:46:19.300]  But then we take it to the next level and we look at what these people are doing and say,
[03:46:19.300 --> 03:46:23.300]  hey, I'm here as an elector, so I need to be able to make that decision.
[03:46:23.300 --> 03:46:29.300]  It's like we don't need them to overwrite the votes of the people on a state-by-state basis.
[03:46:29.300 --> 03:46:36.300]  If we had a multi-party democracy and we had more than two candidates who had a chance of winning in this,
[03:46:36.300 --> 03:46:41.300]  then the electors, I think, should represent what the people of the state wanted them to do for at least one ballot
[03:46:41.300 --> 03:46:45.300]  and then they can make a decision. But we've got a two-person election here.
[03:46:45.300 --> 03:46:51.300]  And so there's nothing for them to do other than be a rubber stamp for what the people said they wanted in election.
[03:46:51.300 --> 03:46:54.300]  And so that's my concern. You're talking about Chicago.
[03:46:54.300 --> 03:47:01.300]  And I think it's the exhibit A of why we need an Electoral College that takes this vote on a state-by-state basis.
[03:47:01.300 --> 03:47:03.300]  Do you agree?
[03:47:03.300 --> 03:47:09.300]  I agree. Totally. That's what I was trying to explain to my wife and stuff about the Electoral College and stuff like that.
[03:47:09.300 --> 03:47:16.300]  How people in large corrupt cities can't overturn any election and stuff like that.
[03:47:16.300 --> 03:47:21.300]  We need the same system that we have right now at the Electoral College.
[03:47:21.300 --> 03:47:25.300]  And that's the best thing we have going right now.
[03:47:25.300 --> 03:47:29.300]  Absolutely. And so we have a system and as Donald Trump pointed out, he said, look,
[03:47:29.300 --> 03:47:35.300]  if we didn't have the Electoral College, I would have campaigned in only five states and I would have campaigned differently under different rules.
[03:47:35.300 --> 03:47:37.300]  And see, that's one thing we should all pay attention to.
[03:47:37.300 --> 03:47:43.300]  We don't want to have a situation where instead of him campaigning in essentially 15 states, that would be narrowed down to only five states.
[03:47:43.300 --> 03:47:45.300]  See, that's why you want to have the Electoral College.
[03:47:45.300 --> 03:47:52.300]  But then the other part of it is the fact that the Democrats, when they don't get the results that they want, or the globalists, or Republicans as well,
[03:47:52.300 --> 03:47:54.300]  then they want to move the goalposts.
[03:47:54.300 --> 03:47:56.300]  They want to change the rules when they don't win.
[03:47:56.300 --> 03:47:58.300]  They're going to take their ball and they're going to go home.
[03:47:58.300 --> 03:48:04.300]  Let's go to, thank you, Mike. Let's go to Antoine in California. Go ahead, Antoine.
[03:48:04.300 --> 03:48:06.300]  Antoine, are you there?
[03:48:06.300 --> 03:48:07.300]  Do we lose Antoine?
[03:48:07.300 --> 03:48:08.300]  Yeah, hello, David.
[03:48:08.300 --> 03:48:10.300]  Hey, how you doing? Go ahead.
[03:48:10.300 --> 03:48:11.300]  I'm doing good.
[03:48:11.300 --> 03:48:19.300]  So I wanted to talk about, first, Donald Trump, I'd like to say you've got to invest a lot in internet media.
[03:48:19.300 --> 03:48:23.300]  A lot, because we have, I mean, that's all there is.
[03:48:23.300 --> 03:48:25.300]  The lies are us.
[03:48:25.300 --> 03:48:26.300]  That's right.
[03:48:26.300 --> 03:48:29.300]  And I think there's a lot of alternative media out there.
[03:48:29.300 --> 03:48:32.300]  There's a lot of stuff being taken over, censored.
[03:48:32.300 --> 03:48:35.300]  You need to basically replace it.
[03:48:35.300 --> 03:48:36.300]  It's very easy.
[03:48:36.300 --> 03:48:47.300]  Think about the fact that Antoine, the Senate just authorized the State Department to spend $180 million to put out their message to counter us.
[03:48:47.300 --> 03:48:48.300]  That's $180 million.
[03:48:48.300 --> 03:48:54.300]  I mean, how many colloidal silver do we have to sell at 50% off to equal $180 million?
[03:48:54.300 --> 03:49:03.300]  I mean, it's absolutely insane the amount of resources and money that they can throw out there to counter social media and what people are putting out there
[03:49:03.300 --> 03:49:07.300]  and putting out what to counter infowars. It's absolutely amazing.
[03:49:07.300 --> 03:49:09.300]  Go ahead.
[03:49:09.300 --> 03:49:10.300]  Yeah.
[03:49:10.300 --> 03:49:14.300]  So, yeah, I have an alternative platform.
[03:49:14.300 --> 03:49:17.300]  I use YouTube. It's called the Orbiter.
[03:49:17.300 --> 03:49:20.300]  I've seen a lot of stuff and it's all aligning for right now.
[03:49:20.300 --> 03:49:21.300]  Some scary stuff.
[03:49:21.300 --> 03:49:23.300]  I say this week is pretty scary.
[03:49:23.300 --> 03:49:28.300]  I hope he can get past all this stuff with the 19th and stuff.
[03:49:28.300 --> 03:49:38.300]  And so I'd have to say, yes, there's stuff where a lot of conspiracies where people say that this year is very critical.
[03:49:38.300 --> 03:49:42.300]  And, you know, martial law could be called as J.D. Helm was practiced.
[03:49:42.300 --> 03:49:48.300]  I heard they've been building, you know, from a conspiracy theorist's got killed by a piano wire.
[03:49:48.300 --> 03:49:59.300]  He said they've been building since 1993, Black Hawk helicopters for the year 2017, 26 of them a day and with the budget of the underground budget.
[03:49:59.300 --> 03:50:05.300]  So I don't know what is going on, but I say just stay cautious and look at the alternative media.
[03:50:05.300 --> 03:50:07.300]  Well, we do a lot of good information.
[03:50:07.300 --> 03:50:10.300]  And what is your YouTube channel again, Antoine?
[03:50:10.300 --> 03:50:11.300]  The Orbiter.
[03:50:11.300 --> 03:50:22.300]  See, you're going to be taken down if they can take down info wars, they will take you down and nobody will notice because that's and they're going to have $180 million for starters.
[03:50:22.300 --> 03:50:28.300]  This is whenever they start a new program, okay, it always starts very, very small and then builds on that.
[03:50:28.300 --> 03:50:37.300]  So this is where they're starting $180 million with the State Department to come out and seed money to the people who are friendly to the government,
[03:50:37.300 --> 03:50:43.300]  who will tell the government's side of things, who will never question the government's official story.
[03:50:43.300 --> 03:50:48.300]  No matter how absurd, no matter how much of an obvious lie it is, it will never be questioned.
[03:50:48.300 --> 03:50:49.300]  That's what they want.
[03:50:49.300 --> 03:50:50.300]  That's what I grew up with.
[03:50:50.300 --> 03:50:54.300]  I grew up with a situation where there were only three channels and NPR.
[03:50:54.300 --> 03:50:56.300]  We don't want to go back there, folks.
[03:50:56.300 --> 03:50:57.300]  Stay with us.
[03:50:57.300 --> 03:51:26.300]  We'll be right back with more of your phone calls.
[03:51:27.300 --> 03:51:32.300]  I know that you will feel Extendivite working for you and will want to take another bottle.
[03:51:32.300 --> 03:51:33.300]  Life is too short.

[03:52:27.300 --> 03:52:56.300]  Come and take it.
[03:52:58.300 --> 03:52:59.300]  Hello again.
[03:52:59.300 --> 03:53:00.300]  My name is Gary Clark.
[03:53:00.300 --> 03:53:07.300]  I'm the actor who's turning 80 in August who played the part of Steve on the 1960s western TV series, The Virginian.
[03:53:07.300 --> 03:53:12.300]  Now, those of you who've suffered the side effects of prescribed medicines know what I'm talking about.
[03:53:12.300 --> 03:53:18.300]  And those of you who have watched the devastating effects that worrying about you has had on your loved ones.
[03:53:18.300 --> 03:53:21.300]  And what I shared a few months ago is only part of the story.
[03:53:21.300 --> 03:53:26.300]  I neglected to mention how one-world-way protein powder has affected my life.
[03:53:26.300 --> 03:53:30.300]  Now, I realize this is not dinner table conversation, but here goes anyway.
[03:53:30.300 --> 03:53:33.300]  One-world-way solved my irregularity.
[03:53:33.300 --> 03:53:38.300]  I've been plagued with constipation for years and I thought it would be that way for the rest of my life.
[03:53:38.300 --> 03:53:41.300]  Three weeks on one-world-way set me on a new path.
[03:53:41.300 --> 03:53:45.300]  That was five months ago and I haven't been irregular since.
[03:53:45.300 --> 03:53:46.300]  Will it work the same way for you?
[03:53:46.300 --> 03:53:47.300]  I don't know.
[03:53:47.300 --> 03:53:48.300]  It worked for me.
[03:53:48.300 --> 03:53:54.300]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[03:53:54.300 --> 03:53:59.300]  That's one-world-w-h-e-y.com.
[03:53:59.300 --> 03:54:05.300]  Big job. Big job.
[03:54:05.300 --> 03:54:07.300]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight.
[03:54:07.300 --> 03:54:09.300]  We're going to take your calls in this next segment.
[03:54:09.300 --> 03:54:15.300]  Folks, you have to understand this is a global war now against free speech.
[03:54:15.300 --> 03:54:21.300]  Many people don't realize that the war on drugs was not something that was created by Richard Nixon in 1971.
[03:54:21.300 --> 03:54:24.300]  It was created by the United Nations in 1961.
[03:54:24.300 --> 03:54:33.300]  It is a worldwide agenda, just like Agenda 21 or the 2030 Agenda for Sustainability, or this new attack on free speech.
[03:54:33.300 --> 03:54:41.300]  Now, the last day I was here, Friday, December the 3rd, I talked with Leap LaRouth, a journalist, 61 years in Europe with experience.
[03:54:41.300 --> 03:54:43.300]  61 years of experience as a journalist.
[03:54:43.300 --> 03:54:51.300]  And, of course, he's been the head of multiple journalist trade organizations throughout Europe, and he is the sitting president of one of them.
[03:54:51.300 --> 03:55:02.300]  I can't remember the name of it right now, but he was talking about the fact that the European Parliament came out with the same sense that they needed to control the press from propaganda.
[03:55:02.300 --> 03:55:07.300]  And he said, well, what is propaganda? Who decides what propaganda is?
[03:55:07.300 --> 03:55:09.300]  Oh, the government will decide, of course.
[03:55:09.300 --> 03:55:13.300]  One week later, we had the U.S. House pass that.
[03:55:13.300 --> 03:55:22.300]  And then about 10 days later, we had them inserted into the NDAA Act, $180 million, and that's what we're up against, folks.
[03:55:22.300 --> 03:55:29.300]  $180 million to fight infowars, to fight Breitbart, to fight other people who are telling you the truth.
[03:55:29.300 --> 03:55:31.300]  They don't want you to hear the truth.
[03:55:31.300 --> 03:55:44.300]  And so, when I look at this Christmas Super Sale special that we've now taken live at InfowarsLife.com, I think it really ought to be called the 2016 Fight for the Life of Free Speech Sale, because that's what this is, folks.
[03:55:44.300 --> 03:55:48.300]  I mean, we try to offer you the very best prices on the very best products that we can.
[03:55:48.300 --> 03:56:02.300]  We've got discounts up to 50% off the site and free shipping site-wide. How much of this do we have to sell in order to counteract the $180 million of propaganda that's going to be coming out of the government?
[03:56:02.300 --> 03:56:13.300]  Okay, we've got living defense, 30% off, brain force plus, 30% off, survival shield, X2, nascent iodine, 30% off, bio-truse selenium, 30% off,
[03:56:13.300 --> 03:56:22.300]  winter sun, vitamin D, 25% off, silver bullet, colloidal silver, 50% off, and free shipping store-wide.
[03:56:22.300 --> 03:56:25.300]  That's the way we fund our operation. That's the way we maintain our independence.
[03:56:25.300 --> 03:56:34.300]  We don't need $180 million to counter the lies of the State Department as long as we still are on the air.
[03:56:34.300 --> 03:56:38.300]  But we need your help to fund this operation to get this microphone out there.
[03:56:38.300 --> 03:56:47.300]  So go to InfoWars Live. Take a look at the 2016 Christmas Super Sale because it really is a sale for your right to know.
[03:56:47.300 --> 03:56:57.300]  Your right to know the truth. Your right to question authority. Authority that is going to now be propagandizing you actively and overtly, not just covertly.
[03:56:57.300 --> 03:57:02.300]  Let's quickly go to our other callers here. Taylor in Texas. Go ahead, Taylor.
[03:57:02.300 --> 03:57:08.300]  Oh, hey, David. How are you doing? Doing good. Great little time. Go quickly. Okay, so, yeah.
[03:57:08.300 --> 03:57:18.300]  So I'm a software engineer and you guys were talking about the election earlier and I asked for a paper ballot in Texas and they denied me that option.
[03:57:18.300 --> 03:57:24.300]  Yeah. So, and I know how easy it is to hack into a computer system. Absolutely.
[03:57:24.300 --> 03:57:36.300]  And I'm just a regular Joe Schmo. And so if I can do that, I imagine what government officials and other people with higher background could possibly do to influence the election.
[03:57:36.300 --> 03:57:42.300]  Yeah, people like Homeland Security could do that, couldn't they? Somebody tried to do that in Georgia and elsewhere.
[03:57:42.300 --> 03:57:48.300]  Yeah, it's absolutely insane that we would do things to make our election vulnerable to fraud.
[03:57:48.300 --> 03:57:53.300]  And you and I both know because of our technical background that it is very easy to do that.
[03:57:53.300 --> 03:57:57.300]  Anybody that's on the Internet knows how easy it is to have your computer hacked.
[03:57:57.300 --> 03:58:03.300]  If you want to look at the self-driving cars with all the electronic stuff in it, every year at the Black Hat Conference,
[03:58:03.300 --> 03:58:08.300]  they show you how they can take over a car and drive it into the ditch or they can slam on the brakes or they can slam on the accelerator.
[03:58:08.300 --> 03:58:15.300]  We need to understand the vulnerabilities that they're deliberately building into our infrastructure and into our elections.
[03:58:15.300 --> 03:58:20.300]  That's where the real concern needs to be. And I'm afraid Jill Stein has shut down a lot of that, giving it a bad name.
[03:58:20.300 --> 03:58:24.300]  We need to come back and we need to make our elections more honest and not less dishonest.
[03:58:24.300 --> 03:58:29.300]  That's it for today's show. Join us tonight for the InfoWars Nightly News at 7 Central, 8 PM Eastern.
[03:58:29.300 --> 03:58:51.300]  I'm David Knight.
