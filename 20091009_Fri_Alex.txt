[00:00.000 --> 00:11.180]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.180 --> 00:18.720]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.720 --> 00:31.800]  Texas Alex Jones chairman Rocky I'm looking at the report that you handed out
[00:31.800 --> 00:37.760]  this morning and I was wondering if you could take your copy and turn to page 26
[00:39.320 --> 00:47.520]  okay there's a table in page 26 which consists of your balance sheet and one
[00:47.520 --> 00:52.120]  of the entries on the balance sheet is under assets central bank liquidity
[00:52.120 --> 01:01.920]  swaps which shows an increase from the end of 2007 from $24 billion to $553
[01:01.920 --> 01:08.680]  billion in change at the end of 2008 what's that those are swaps that were
[01:08.680 --> 01:15.520]  done with foreign central banks many many foreign banks are short dollars
[01:15.520 --> 01:19.240]  and to our markets looking for dollars and drive up interest rates and create
[01:19.240 --> 01:23.840]  volatility in our markets what we have done is with a number of major central
[01:23.840 --> 01:27.480]  banks like European Central Bank for example we swap our currency dollars
[01:27.480 --> 01:31.880]  for their currency euros they take the dollars lend it out to the banks and
[01:31.880 --> 01:36.760]  they're in their jurisdiction that helps bring down interest rates in the
[01:36.760 --> 01:40.680]  global market for dollars and meanwhile we're not lending to those banks we're
[01:40.680 --> 01:44.920]  lending to the central bank the central bank is responsible for repaying us so
[01:44.920 --> 01:49.080]  who got the money to financial institutions in Europe and other
[01:49.080 --> 01:55.280]  countries which ones I don't know half a trillion dollars and you don't know who
[01:55.280 --> 01:59.200]  got the money the loan went to the the loans go to the central banks and they
[01:59.200 --> 02:04.960]  they then put them out there to their institutions to try to bring down short
[02:04.960 --> 02:08.120]  term interest rates and dollar markets around the world well let's start with
[02:08.120 --> 02:12.840]  which central banks got the money there's 14 of them which are listed in our
[02:12.840 --> 02:18.640]  I'm sure they listed in here somewhere all right so who actually made that
[02:18.640 --> 02:21.720]  decision to hand out a trillion dollars that way half a trillion dollars who
[02:21.720 --> 02:26.520]  made that decision the federal market committee okay and was it done at one
[02:26.520 --> 02:30.920]  time or in a series of meetings series of meetings and under what legal
[02:30.920 --> 02:35.000]  authority we have a long-standing legal authority to do swaps with other
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  central banks it's not an emergency it's not an emergency authority of any kind
[02:39.000 --> 02:48.120]  anything specific about it do you know the my counsel says section 14 of the
[02:48.120 --> 02:51.800]  general professional reserve act all right we actually looked at one of the
[02:51.800 --> 02:55.560]  arrangements and one of the arrangements is nine billion dollars for New
[02:55.560 --> 02:59.000]  Zealand that works out to three thousand dollars for every single person who lives
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.360]  in New Zealand seriously wouldn't it be better to extend that kind of credit to
[03:03.360 --> 03:09.520]  Americans rather than New Zealanders it's not costing Americans anything we're
[03:09.520 --> 03:13.000]  getting interest back and it comes back it's not at the cost of any American
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.280]  credit you are extending credit to Americans well couldn't it wouldn't
[03:17.280 --> 03:21.880]  necessarily affect the credit markets if you extend half a trillion dollars in
[03:21.880 --> 03:27.400]  credit to anybody we are lending to all US financial institutions in exactly the
[03:27.400 --> 03:31.260]  same way well look at the next page the very next page has the US dollar
[03:31.260 --> 03:35.040]  nominal exchange rate which shows a twenty percent increase in US dollar
[03:35.040 --> 03:41.280]  nominal exchange. All right ladies and gentlemen it is October 9th 2009 on this

[11:35.240 --> 11:37.960]  instead of me throwing out a bunch of questions about what do you think of the
[11:37.960 --> 11:40.200]  fair mongering what do you think of the adjuvants what do you think of the
[11:40.200 --> 11:43.880]  announcements of sports stadiums trying to force medical workers quietly to take
[11:43.880 --> 11:49.240]  it through color of law just what do you think is most important right now and
[11:49.240 --> 11:55.480]  give us a report on what you think is key what I think is key is to do whatever
[11:55.480 --> 12:00.560]  you have to do to keep yourself healthy and I've always been proponent you know
[12:00.560 --> 12:04.200]  Alex and I've talked about this before in terms of health is from the inside
[12:04.200 --> 12:08.000]  out and what's happening externally in terms of the bug there's not a big
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.920]  reason to be afraid of that but you have to keep yourself healthy from the
[12:11.920 --> 12:17.280]  inside out one of the problems though is the is that the FDA is going to make it
[12:17.280 --> 12:21.040]  increasingly more difficult for you to keep yourself healthy they've been
[12:21.040 --> 12:25.120]  sending out letters since May of this year for any sort of vitamin and
[12:25.120 --> 12:29.240]  supplement company that is putting out supplements that says that it can protect
[12:29.240 --> 12:32.840]  you and boost your immune system against the flu and if they've mentioned the
[12:32.840 --> 12:37.840]  H1N1 flu virus in any of their products the FDA is sending them warning
[12:37.840 --> 12:43.760]  letters that are actually could potentially cause them to and threatening
[12:43.760 --> 12:47.720]  criminal prosecution of these people so it seems to me that they're trying to
[12:47.720 --> 12:51.600]  eliminate the competition and take it harder and harder for people to stay
[12:51.600 --> 12:57.080]  healthy and take care of themselves if they do get sick there was a and the
[12:57.080 --> 13:00.840]  they had a final ruling that came out today also about colloidal silver I mean
[13:00.840 --> 13:05.520]  I know that or if it came out last week I know that a lot of the people that I
[13:05.520 --> 13:08.520]  get a lot of emails from and I'm sure you do too they asked me you know why
[13:08.520 --> 13:12.240]  don't I talk a lot about colloidal silver well I've seen this coming down the
[13:12.240 --> 13:16.200]  road and that they that the FDA was going to say it's not generally recommended
[13:16.200 --> 13:20.520]  to say and if it's and that they're taking regulatory action against the
[13:20.520 --> 13:25.880]  product that's marketed as a dietary supplement unless it's labeled in a
[13:25.880 --> 13:31.800]  very specific way and it's marketed in a very specific way and that it cannot be
[13:31.800 --> 13:35.640]  protected by the Deshea Supplement Act if it says a topical gel or anything that
[13:35.640 --> 13:39.920]  that's used on the skin they've had this out there for a while it's been out
[13:39.920 --> 13:45.800]  there since 1997 but the final ruling on this just came down last week on August
[13:45.800 --> 13:50.000]  you know it's just last Thursday as a matter of fact and it was listed in the
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.520]  federal register that they that all over-the-counter drugs products
[13:54.520 --> 13:57.880]  containing colloidal silver or gradients or silver salts are used for
[13:57.880 --> 14:01.800]  external use are not generally recognized as safe and effective and are
[14:01.800 --> 14:06.920]  misbranded so it makes me nervous that it seems as though the all of the
[14:06.920 --> 14:11.680]  products that we in the natural health community have used safely for years and
[14:11.680 --> 14:15.240]  have seen great results with it whether it be vitamin supplements or colloidal
[14:15.240 --> 14:20.080]  silver it seems as though those those products may be taken away from us well
[14:20.080 --> 14:23.120]  you know I've got colloidal silver generator and I've got some I've bought
[14:23.120 --> 14:26.200]  but I need to remind my wife to buy a whole bunch of the better products that
[14:26.200 --> 14:31.760]  are out there as they shut down this this tool you're a medical doctor and I've
[14:31.760 --> 14:35.360]  had medical doctor after medical doctor after medical doctor on in many cases
[14:35.360 --> 14:38.520]  you aren't even involved in promoting it and they say no it's a very strong
[14:38.520 --> 14:43.200]  antiviral and antibacterial and in a lot of studies and I'm gonna ask you if this
[14:43.200 --> 14:46.840]  is correct it shows us a lot better than Tama flu or other things they're making
[14:46.840 --> 14:50.000]  all this money off of but I guess they're saying as a doctor you're not
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.640]  allowed to practice medicine and say that I mean what do we know from the
[14:53.640 --> 14:57.120]  studies I mean what does colloidal silver do I mean well what they're saying in
[14:57.120 --> 15:00.880]  this FDA ruling and this really comes right off of the FDA website and the
[15:00.880 --> 15:05.160]  ruling went into effect September 16th so this is really kind of hot off the
[15:05.160 --> 15:08.800]  presses and what it says is that anything that people have seen that
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.800]  there's no information about strength quality purity and potency and there was
[15:13.800 --> 15:18.200]  a lot of people who sent in and gave testimonials about different types of
[15:18.200 --> 15:21.600]  things and they said that it was all anecdotal evidence that nobody had
[15:21.600 --> 15:25.560]  submitted anything that proved anything to any kind of a drug quality drug
[15:25.560 --> 15:29.160]  quality standard but they've known for thousands of years that silver is a
[15:29.160 --> 15:33.200]  strong antibiotic right and they're not allowing it to be grandfathered in they
[15:33.200 --> 15:37.400]  are clear in that in they are very clear in that that without evidence and I'm
[15:37.400 --> 15:40.800]  reading right from the right from the report Alex where it says without
[15:40.800 --> 15:45.720]  evidence that the composition and labeling has not changed since 1938 or
[15:45.720 --> 15:52.240]  1962 the products cannot qualify for either grandfather exemption so somebody
[15:52.240 --> 15:56.520]  means specifically as a doctor oh no we use it in our practice I mean what does
[15:56.520 --> 16:02.400]  it do explain to people why micro silver kills bacteria and viruses when
[16:02.400 --> 16:06.800]  antibiotics only kill bacteria antivirals only weakened viruses and then and then
[16:06.800 --> 16:10.320]  it looks obvious to me that right as everybody's realizing this is something
[16:10.320 --> 16:15.200]  that the evidence has shown in the past has some good effects against flu and
[16:15.200 --> 16:18.320]  things that they're now saying you better not use this you better not have
[16:18.320 --> 16:21.840]  it and you better not use certain vitamins and you better not use certain
[16:21.840 --> 16:25.880]  herbals like medicinal mushrooms and things like that that boosts up your own
[16:25.880 --> 16:30.720]  resistance to external microbes back to your question I mean the way that it's
[16:30.720 --> 16:33.800]  understood that how the silver particles work is that they go in and they cause
[16:33.800 --> 16:38.040]  this the metabolism of the bug to stop working and they stop the replication of
[16:38.040 --> 16:42.480]  viruses and it laces the cell membrane of bacteria is in fungus and and I'm not
[16:42.480 --> 16:47.360]  an expert on the physiology of that Alex and I think there might be some loopholes
[16:47.360 --> 16:52.000]  for some of the manufacturers but I have seen FDA warning letters that if that
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.760]  went out a while ago the people who are manufacturers of this and I guess my point
[16:56.760 --> 17:01.040]  when you asked me what did I think was important is that we we have a lot of
[17:01.040 --> 17:05.720]  tools in the natural health community to not only keep it as well after we've
[17:05.720 --> 17:09.800]  been sick so that we can avoid things like Tamiflu but that we can build up
[17:09.800 --> 17:13.800]  our own resistance and build up our own internal strength and up against these
[17:13.800 --> 17:18.320]  microbes and it looks as though at every turn not only is the are they
[17:18.320 --> 17:21.560]  promoting this vaccine and everybody has to be vaccinated and I know you've
[17:21.560 --> 17:25.320]  talked about this a lot and a lot of the writings in the radio I've been on to
[17:25.320 --> 17:29.360]  there's been a lot about the vaccine but it's like what else can we do to keep
[17:29.360 --> 17:33.480]  ourselves healthy it's concerning to me that it looks like a lot of these tools
[17:33.480 --> 17:41.240]  are being set down by the FDA and FDA also well it's outrageous I mean I've
[17:41.240 --> 17:46.960]  I've read the reports we've had medical doctor for medical doctor on and there I
[17:46.960 --> 17:52.520]  have gone back and seen studies over the last hundred years about tiny silver
[17:52.520 --> 17:59.000]  particles just shredding viruses and bacteria it's like holy water to a
[17:59.000 --> 18:07.080]  vampire and I mean I've got it for my family and I've seen the studies that
[18:07.080 --> 18:10.640]  elderberry might be bad because it could actually cause a hemorrhagic immune
[18:10.640 --> 18:14.560]  response and jack up your immune system and trigger something I don't understand
[18:14.560 --> 18:18.640]  all the properties of that so we're not going to use that I mean and then I guess
[18:18.640 --> 18:21.640]  in America they could come after you I'm not even allowed to ask you a medical
[18:21.640 --> 18:27.800]  doctor I mean I guess get son because I've had vitamin D helps especially the
[18:27.800 --> 18:31.840]  type that the skin produces I guess I'm not allowed to ask you if that's good I
[18:31.840 --> 18:34.520]  guess I'm not allowed to ask you if getting a lot of sleep is good and being
[18:34.520 --> 18:39.920]  healthy I guess I'm not allow I mean what are you doing for yourself well
[18:39.920 --> 18:45.200]  we're doing things like like alcohol and water and lots of vitamin C lots of
[18:45.200 --> 18:51.320]  vitamin D vitamin A trying to get fresh you know all the things that I talk
[18:51.320 --> 18:56.760]  about exercise the fresh air fresh water good food try to eat it organic as
[18:56.760 --> 19:00.680]  much as we can try to get some little bit of exercise get out of the chair and
[19:00.680 --> 19:05.520]  away from the computer and do some exercise and I think that that's what's
[19:05.520 --> 19:09.360]  really really important and the other thing is a lot of you know our emotions
[19:09.360 --> 19:13.880]  play a big role on what happens to our bodies also and if you live in that state
[19:13.880 --> 19:17.600]  of fear that big fear factors and what that does is it suppresses your cortisol
[19:17.600 --> 19:20.960]  levels and it makes you or it increases your cortisol levels and makes you more
[19:20.960 --> 19:25.760]  susceptible to illness and disease so my husband and I we just don't live in a
[19:25.760 --> 19:29.400]  fear-based place about all this stuff we sort of look at it and say I'm not
[19:29.400 --> 19:32.560]  going to get the vaccine I'm not going to do it and whatever happens is going to
[19:32.560 --> 19:36.080]  happen and if I have to self quarantine and pull up in my house with food
[19:36.080 --> 19:39.600]  vitamins and water that's what I'm going to do well you can still get
[19:39.600 --> 19:45.760]  vitamins you'll get it Dr. Sherry Tenpenny stay there I want to get into the
[19:45.760 --> 19:49.080]  fact that Dr. Monteef has a flu report from the CDC saying it's going to peak
[19:49.080 --> 19:53.000]  the middle of next month right when all the vaccine injections get going I want
[19:53.000 --> 19:58.360]  to get into adverse reactions in Europe from the vaccine and other vaccines the
[19:58.360 --> 20:00.640]  forced inoculations stay with us.

[24:22.720 --> 24:27.360]  military medical workers to take the shots threatening to fire them but also
[24:27.360 --> 24:33.080]  just the vaccine manufacturing process the adjuvants the fact that dr. Montee
[24:33.080 --> 24:39.280]  medical doctor was on with us yesterday that and he talked in detail and we went
[24:39.280 --> 24:42.960]  to the CDC's own website and they admitted that upwards of 37% of people
[24:42.960 --> 24:48.880]  they've tested in the US and also in Australia have been found to have the H1N1
[24:48.880 --> 24:56.200]  and didn't even get sick from it and it appears to be very mild and this whole
[24:56.200 --> 24:59.080]  thing we know they've been secretly preparing for it since January give us
[24:59.080 --> 25:03.000]  your take on that well it's not that much different than what was happening
[25:03.000 --> 25:07.760]  with the bird flu with H5N1 Alex three years ago and that they were saying
[25:07.760 --> 25:11.160]  that there were tens of thousand more people in Southeast Asia and China and
[25:11.160 --> 25:15.240]  around and in that part of the world that had been infected and weren't even
[25:15.240 --> 25:18.840]  sick enough to go to the doctor and yet the ones that were the most sick in the
[25:18.840 --> 25:23.680]  hospital and perhaps had a fatal or a bad outcome that those were the ones that
[25:23.680 --> 25:27.360]  they were using only for those for the statistics so that if they admitted a
[25:27.360 --> 25:31.240]  hundred people to the hospital and fifty people died they call it a fifty
[25:31.240 --> 25:34.880]  percent death rate but the truth is about a hundred people went to the
[25:34.880 --> 25:39.760]  hospital and they were ten or twenty thousand people who were sick enough to
[25:39.760 --> 25:43.560]  not even who weren't even sick enough to go to the doctor that changes the
[25:43.560 --> 25:47.600]  denominator and makes the death rate you know some in the testimony small
[25:47.600 --> 25:51.120]  number and I don't think it's any different now with the swine flu I
[25:51.120 --> 25:54.600]  mean they've said that they thought that by flu season this year almost a third
[25:54.600 --> 25:59.080]  of the general population in the US would have either been exposed or would
[25:59.080 --> 26:04.520]  have been sick by the H1N1 virus so what is the big deal they say it's highly
[26:04.520 --> 26:09.000]  infective but it has a low virulence which means a lot of people can get it a
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.320]  lot of people can spread it around but not very many people get sick from it
[26:14.320 --> 26:22.400]  continue breaking that down in terms of what do you mean what youth why are
[26:22.400 --> 26:27.320]  they hyping it then if it's no big deal they really want us to get this
[26:27.320 --> 26:31.120]  vaccine for one reason or another and one of the things that I've said for a
[26:31.120 --> 26:35.920]  while is that this is either phase three this is like with when you're in the
[26:35.920 --> 26:39.120]  Navy and you have to do all of these final checks before you send the show you
[26:39.120 --> 26:44.000]  want to ship out to the to the ocean this is either the final test to make
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.200]  sure that all of the the implementation things are in place before they pull the
[26:48.200 --> 26:52.960]  big trigger in the final one because it's looking less and less like this is
[26:52.960 --> 26:58.360]  going to be it you know we've had three trial runs we've had SARS we've had H5N1
[26:58.360 --> 27:03.080]  and now we've had this one the H1N1 they're talking about it is it going to
[27:03.080 --> 27:07.000]  ramp up this winter and wouldn't it be a coincidence if it ramps up right around
[27:07.000 --> 27:12.200]  October 15th when the when the vaccine was supposed to be delivered and you
[27:12.200 --> 27:15.720]  know they've got these emergency utilization authorizations that are
[27:15.720 --> 27:20.880]  sitting back in the backdrop the EUA's which have been put into place by the
[27:20.880 --> 27:25.840]  2006 PREP Act so that at any given time the head of Department of Health and
[27:25.840 --> 27:29.880]  Human Services can just say oh we really need this vaccine we don't have
[27:29.880 --> 27:33.240]  enough vaccine we have a manufactured enough of it let's pull in all the
[27:33.240 --> 27:37.200]  vaccine we can from everywhere oh isn't it interesting the ones we have the most
[27:37.200 --> 27:41.200]  of came from China and from and from Europe and they're the ones that have
[27:41.200 --> 27:46.160]  the squalene in the ASO 3 and the MF 59. Let me stop you I want to go through that but
[27:46.160 --> 27:50.360]  you're saying pull the trigger on the big event all these little events dry runs
[27:50.360 --> 27:54.040]  to set up the medical tyranny infrastructure Ron Paul talked about
[27:54.040 --> 27:59.120]  that last hour are you saying they may release something else or try to do a
[27:59.120 --> 28:06.120]  force inoculation what is the big event? Well either that there is a the virus
[28:06.120 --> 28:11.400]  gets suddenly worse either something is released it seems so weird Alex that
[28:11.400 --> 28:14.920]  that if something was really made in nature which they're trying to make us
[28:14.920 --> 28:18.720]  believe would suddenly have a ramp up and particularly since everything coming
[28:18.720 --> 28:21.640]  out of South America in the southern hemisphere says that it didn't ramp up at
[28:21.640 --> 28:27.760]  all down there so could it be that they're going to have another test tube
[28:27.760 --> 28:33.520]  made virus that could be released at some major event in the winter you know
[28:33.520 --> 28:36.680]  we've got the winter Olympics that are coming up this winter and it makes me
[28:36.680 --> 28:39.200]  nervous to think that there'll be people that will going to be going to
[28:39.200 --> 28:43.680]  Vancouver from all over the world and in the middle of the winter time and is
[28:43.680 --> 28:48.600]  that a point in time where the virus may be contracted be worse to be spread by
[28:48.600 --> 28:52.600]  just humans going back home. Doctor we're about to break but I want to spend time
[28:52.600 --> 28:56.080]  on this in the next segment I want to flesh this out because this is what
[28:56.080 --> 29:01.760]  every other medical doctor I have on says they believe is being set up and my
[29:01.760 --> 29:06.760]  dad called me Sunday night and said check your email and I didn't see it and I
[29:06.760 --> 29:10.760]  need to call him and find out what he was talking about he said he got a CDC
[29:10.760 --> 29:16.000]  report he was reading online that said oh we believe it could mutate and then
[29:16.000 --> 29:21.140]  they gave the mutation into something super hyper deadly in the next few
[29:21.140 --> 29:24.240]  months and they gave the calculation are you aware of what he was talking about
[29:24.240 --> 29:29.200]  I've read a little bit of that but I haven't perhaps read as much specific as
[29:29.200 --> 29:32.840]  what you have but that's exactly what you're saying because we see this massive
[29:32.840 --> 29:36.840]  build-up troops suddenly popping up on the streets all over the US and Europe
[29:36.840 --> 29:41.260]  stay there let's let's talk about how this may unfold because we've never seen
[29:41.260 --> 29:45.480]  such a build-up at this level Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is our guest Dr. Tenpenny.com

[30:03.440 --> 30:07.400]  yourself this question do you really know what's in your tap water in a recent
[30:07.400 --> 30:12.080]  study conducted by a major environmental auditor they found that over 260
[30:12.080 --> 30:15.860]  chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water many of these
[30:15.860 --> 30:19.720]  chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental
[30:19.720 --> 30:24.280]  system diseases now what are you going to do about it the a colo blue atmospheric
[30:24.280 --> 30:28.040]  water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your
[30:28.040 --> 30:32.200]  families drinking water the a colo blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water
[30:32.200 --> 30:36.160]  from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration

[33:27.160 --> 33:32.160]  Gary Tenpenny is our guest
[33:32.160 --> 33:37.400]  doctor continuing along the line that you've gotten into about all the evidence
[33:37.400 --> 33:42.160]  showing pointing towards them releasing something more deadly or knowing it's
[33:42.160 --> 33:47.600]  going to mutate the CDC report saying it may mutate into something extremely
[33:47.600 --> 33:50.080]  deadly continue
[33:50.080 --> 33:53.640]  I read a report I think it was a couple of days ago and I just skimmed it I
[33:53.640 --> 33:57.960]  didn't really read at the details of it but it was talking about the H1N1
[33:57.960 --> 34:02.040]  morphing into something and being a different subtype and I thought well
[34:02.040 --> 34:06.320]  now isn't that just interesting we just spent ten billion dollars manufacturing
[34:06.320 --> 34:10.000]  a vaccine by five different companies and bottling it all up and even their
[34:10.000 --> 34:14.320]  stuff isn't going to work you know if this is really true that the virus is
[34:14.320 --> 34:18.240]  going to going to morph and they claim that in order for the vaccine to work it
[34:18.240 --> 34:22.840]  needs to be an exact batch except of course Nancy Cox who once in a while has
[34:22.840 --> 34:26.680]  said and I talked about it in my book foul or she said well you know sometimes
[34:26.680 --> 34:31.480]  if it's a close match it'll it'll be okay so how close is close enough you know
[34:31.480 --> 34:34.760]  is the vaccine going to be even in their own mind is it going to be good enough
[34:34.760 --> 34:39.640]  to to protect against this morphing very much stronger more virulent virus
[34:39.640 --> 34:44.960]  because at that point it won't match the virus that's in the vaccine anyway
[34:44.960 --> 34:50.440]  what about for the last month all these nursing associations and nurses and
[34:50.440 --> 34:53.280]  their husbands and wives have been calling me sending me letters now we
[34:53.280 --> 34:59.800]  posted on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com where they're told three
[34:59.800 --> 35:04.040]  different things in different letters you take the shot of your fired you take
[35:04.040 --> 35:10.120]  the shot or you wear a mask for six months or you're fired or we'd like you
[35:10.120 --> 35:15.600]  to take the shot but but it's all three and then now at schools they're not even
[35:15.600 --> 35:18.560]  asking they're just telling parents you've got to do it they're now making the
[35:18.560 --> 35:22.360]  nurses take the regular seasonal flu shot this is confirmed it's now come out
[35:22.360 --> 35:26.920]  mainstream news weeks after we covered it and Obama does this military tactic of
[35:26.920 --> 35:31.320]  denying so everybody kind of stands down so our opposition can't
[35:31.320 --> 35:35.520]  articulate what's happening and build to resist the polls show the majority of
[35:35.520 --> 35:40.000]  people don't want to be forced to take it and don't want to take it but there's
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.920]  this whole kind of quiet under-the-radar program and I've talked to nurse after
[35:44.920 --> 35:49.760]  nurse and firefighter or firefighter they tell them you got to take this many
[35:49.760 --> 35:53.320]  have already been forced to take it at Seton hospitals here in Austin and don't
[35:53.320 --> 35:57.640]  tell anybody we made you do this or you're fired I mean it's like a huge
[35:57.640 --> 36:03.880]  curtain of tyranny and oppression is lowering over us I certainly hope that a
[36:03.880 --> 36:08.400]  lot of those people that heard that will be brave enough to maybe partner with
[36:08.400 --> 36:12.040]  several other people who were told the same things and come forward and expose
[36:12.040 --> 36:17.200]  that because now we're talking about American against American and neighbor
[36:17.200 --> 36:21.280]  against neighbor and even friend against friend doing these sorts of things
[36:21.280 --> 36:26.680]  this really is tyrannical those sorts of things and people have got to be brave
[36:26.680 --> 36:31.680]  enough to be able to stand up and step out and say and expose the people that
[36:31.680 --> 36:35.120]  are saying this and that they can expose the person who told them to say that
[36:35.120 --> 36:38.640]  because then finally we'll go far enough down into the raffle we'll find the
[36:38.640 --> 36:43.160]  rat and who's giving these sort of orders and making this be that we have to
[36:43.160 --> 36:47.240]  take this medication and have one American have to be forcing forcibly
[36:47.240 --> 36:52.080]  giving it to another I have studied the Rockefellers deep land I know you have
[36:52.080 --> 36:57.360]  as well but so is Dr. Blalock and every researcher we have on has the same
[36:57.360 --> 37:01.400]  intel because we're just researching their own statements the big private
[37:01.400 --> 37:06.520]  corporation that manages New York City the Rockefellers set up tied into 9-11
[37:06.520 --> 37:11.400]  tied into the big vaccine makers tied into all the key players and I read
[37:11.400 --> 37:15.400]  horror what's his affidavit remember he predicted the anthrax attacks before
[37:15.400 --> 37:19.200]  they happen and then with precision said who did it now so you know sometimes
[37:19.200 --> 37:23.440]  you take I take what he does is kind of whoa that's that's extreme but then
[37:23.440 --> 37:27.920]  he's proven right down the road so I've got a look at his app and then I've done
[37:27.920 --> 37:32.520]  my own research reading the affidavit where he's going to the FBI saying here
[37:32.520 --> 37:38.460]  are the criminals they did it very bold have you a read his affidavit and what
[37:38.460 --> 37:43.480]  do you think of this whole racketeering operation that he says is going on I have
[37:43.480 --> 37:49.720]  read the his affidavit I have to say that I haven't studied it and I haven't
[37:49.720 --> 37:52.760]  really connected all the dots I do know that when I was reading through it it
[37:52.760 --> 37:56.520]  seemed as though I did have questions of saying there seem to be some gaps and
[37:56.520 --> 38:00.600]  some of the connections there and that's my opinion and again I didn't go
[38:00.600 --> 38:04.440]  through and study every single one of those line item things but I do believe
[38:04.440 --> 38:08.320]  that there's enough evidence there there's enough evidence that somebody
[38:08.320 --> 38:13.520]  who is on our side of the equation on our table needs to sit up and take notice
[38:13.520 --> 38:16.440]  and follow through with some of the things that he's talking about I mean in
[38:16.440 --> 38:21.040]  any sort of a lawsuit of any kind even if it's a car accident there are
[38:21.040 --> 38:25.040]  certainly elements that have missing little missing links and some assumptions
[38:25.040 --> 38:30.040]  that can be made and I do believe that that there's there's things that do
[38:30.040 --> 38:35.280]  need to be investigated no doubt I want to open the phones up specifically for
[38:35.280 --> 38:39.320]  questions on the flu the level 6 pandemic declared when it's really not a
[38:39.320 --> 38:42.560]  pandemic according to medical doctors we've talked to they've they've changed
[38:42.560 --> 38:47.000]  the scale to call it a pandemic when it's not I'd like you to speak to that
[38:47.000 --> 38:53.640]  but I want to take calls 1-800-259-9231 but only on the flu and the whole
[38:53.640 --> 39:02.120]  martial law situation 1-800-259-9231 but but doctor specifically and Ron Paul
[39:02.120 --> 39:05.760]  agrees he said this is a medical tyranny first they say we're taking your
[39:05.760 --> 39:10.600]  rights for shadowy people and turbines in Central Asia in Afghanistan then they
[39:10.600 --> 39:14.160]  go well really DHS and Homeland Security and North Comer for the American
[39:14.160 --> 39:17.920]  people and yeah the Patriot Act is going to be is being used and non-terror
[39:17.920 --> 39:21.280]  related and we don't need warrants anymore to take your blood at checkpoints
[39:21.280 --> 39:26.000]  or bus in your house and you know but but but that's not even good enough it
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.520]  it's perfect to then say everybody could have the flu everybody could be carrying
[39:30.520 --> 39:35.080]  it and it's just a perfect excuse to further expand under UN control the
[39:35.080 --> 39:39.680]  takeover of nation states and under level six we are under UN control right
[39:39.680 --> 39:44.760]  now I mean do you get what I'm saying here that that flu is the perfect thing
[39:44.760 --> 39:49.680]  to create the ultimate boogeyman oh absolutely and I'm in total agreement
[39:49.680 --> 39:54.120]  Alex with everything that you just said because one thing it has led to another
[39:54.120 --> 39:59.240]  and the thing that bothers me about all of this is that you know somebody's out
[39:59.240 --> 40:04.080]  there making those FEMA camp somebody's handling hammering nail into wood
[40:04.080 --> 40:08.400]  somebody is making those shots and giving them to people somebody is putting
[40:08.400 --> 40:12.840]  documents in place and in signing their name and who those somebody's are our
[40:12.840 --> 40:16.400]  neighbors our friends people we go to church with people that are in our schools
[40:16.400 --> 40:22.640]  our soccer teams why is it that people who are doing those things can't see
[40:22.640 --> 40:27.040]  what's happening and stop and let's all band together and it's really us
[40:27.040 --> 40:33.320]  Americans there's 300 million of us and 550 of them where we're we've got the
[40:33.320 --> 40:37.480]  resistance we've got the power of the people here we've got numbers but yet we
[40:37.480 --> 40:43.560]  have allowed that them that small set of 554 of them down in Washington DC to
[40:43.560 --> 40:47.840]  pull all this wool over our eyes I think it's really time that we all stand up
[40:47.840 --> 40:52.120]  and set aside our differences and say enough is enough just like that 912
[40:52.120 --> 40:56.040]  March I mean I don't you know when I looked at that to me it really wasn't
[40:56.040 --> 40:59.520]  about what side of the equation you were on or what you were saying or where your
[40:59.520 --> 41:03.240]  politics happened to stand it was the fact that people were willing to get out
[41:03.240 --> 41:06.960]  of their chairs spend money go to Washington and make their voice be heard
[41:06.960 --> 41:11.440]  and I think that on a state-by-state community by community level this is
[41:11.440 --> 41:17.560]  what we need to do well you're absolutely right doctor what about
[41:17.560 --> 41:22.880]  adverse reactions from the flu trials we've had nurses calling in saying that
[41:22.880 --> 41:26.800]  when they get the shots everybody's arm basically becomes paralyzed we have the
[41:26.800 --> 41:31.520]  internal CDC report about neurological problems linked to previous vaccines and
[41:31.520 --> 41:38.680]  possibly to this one what's the intel on that now well I heard a report out of
[41:38.680 --> 41:42.080]  them it was just them it was a rumored report but it was a report that came out
[41:42.080 --> 41:45.720]  of Oklahoma that said that there was a small hospital where the doctors all
[41:45.720 --> 41:48.400]  got together and said they weren't going to take it need they were in neither
[41:48.400 --> 41:50.920]  were the nurses and they weren't going to give it to anybody because they had
[41:50.920 --> 41:54.880]  heard that the same sort of things that out of these clinical trials that there
[41:54.880 --> 42:00.520]  was a lot of adverse reactions that were not being reported at all and you know
[42:00.520 --> 42:03.960]  that's another thing is that there's anybody out there that's been forced to
[42:03.960 --> 42:08.200]  take this by a nurse or paramedics or first responders they need to be very
[42:08.200 --> 42:12.440]  vocal about it and let everybody else know the type of reactions that they
[42:12.440 --> 42:16.440]  had because it's not going to be reported by the CDC and you know with
[42:16.440 --> 42:21.720]  YouTube that we have now and blogs and and the Internet there are ways that we
[42:21.720 --> 42:25.680]  can make our voice be heard so I really think there's going to be a lot of
[42:25.680 --> 42:28.960]  problems with it now the CDC has already loaded their side of the deck on that
[42:28.960 --> 42:33.560]  though Alex they've already put up PowerPoint presentations and had other
[42:33.560 --> 42:38.160]  speakers who are from the CDC say yes yes yes of course because we're going to
[42:38.160 --> 42:42.120]  have so many people vaccinated at the same time the percentage risk of
[42:42.120 --> 42:45.840]  vaccination injury is going to go up so we expect that and that's going to be
[42:45.840 --> 42:53.160]  acceptable well it's not acceptable well I've got a report here at info wars
[42:53.160 --> 42:58.560]  net from Steve Watson swine flu document list sports arena as max
[42:58.560 --> 43:02.560]  vaccination center and we've always known that was the plan people ask
[43:02.560 --> 43:06.320]  where are the FEMA camps and Congress admits and the New York Times admits
[43:06.320 --> 43:10.920]  they've built certain FEMA camps six big ones across the country for millions of
[43:10.920 --> 43:15.400]  Americans but they have they admit the sports stadiums the local schools these
[43:15.400 --> 43:19.400]  are the places they can roll barbed wire in hours or they already have it and lock
[43:19.400 --> 43:23.920]  everybody down they're training the military for force quarantine under
[43:23.920 --> 43:26.600]  level six but they're saying well we're not sure we're going to implement that
[43:26.600 --> 43:31.960]  and they're now kind of floating the trial balloon of oh well you don't have
[43:31.960 --> 43:35.600]  to take the shot but you can't fly you can't get on a bus you can't drive to
[43:35.600 --> 43:40.560]  work and you're gonna have to wear a bracelet digital angel the very chip
[43:40.560 --> 43:47.000]  company got a patent their stock went up 200 plus percent the other day to make
[43:47.000 --> 43:51.600]  it for you have to take a chip to prove you've had it that's AP reporting that I
[43:51.600 --> 43:57.200]  mean this is 1984 what we're saying Alex it's exactly what I've been saying for
[43:57.200 --> 44:02.160]  the last six months that I really don't think that the government at any level
[44:02.160 --> 44:06.720]  whether it's state or local has quite the power in this big country that's
[44:06.720 --> 44:10.200]  spread out across everywhere to make everybody show up at a certain place
[44:10.200 --> 44:13.640]  and force them to get a vaccine that they can make it really really hard to
[44:13.640 --> 44:17.720]  refuse it and the really hard to refuse it is that list of things that you
[44:17.720 --> 44:20.640]  already said and you know you can't go to places where there's large
[44:20.640 --> 44:25.080]  congregations which could could be church could be the grocery store could
[44:25.080 --> 44:29.040]  be if you have a place of employment that has more than 30 or 40 people that
[44:29.040 --> 44:32.280]  they would hire a security guard at the door and you have to either show your
[44:32.280 --> 44:36.880]  digital chip or your your card that looks like a driver's license or bracelet
[44:36.880 --> 44:42.400]  or a bracelet or anything like that and you know I'm just this doctor out here
[44:42.400 --> 44:46.680]  in Cleveland Ohio and if I can think of that and you can think of that
[44:46.680 --> 44:51.120]  certainly those who would be making those sorts of tools can be thinking of
[44:51.120 --> 44:55.440]  no they're saying that's what they're gonna do I know and I've been saying it
[44:55.440 --> 44:59.520]  for six months but that was probably that that I was very suspicious that
[44:59.520 --> 45:03.640]  that was coming down the road so now it's just coming out into full view and
[45:03.640 --> 45:07.160]  the in the playbook is being opened up well and more and more people are
[45:07.160 --> 45:11.960]  hearing about it you're right we're a 90% urban society we had the great
[45:11.960 --> 45:16.520]  depression we were 20% urban we're totally dependent on government the
[45:16.520 --> 45:20.640]  highways were designed by the Pentagon and President Eisenhower and the Pentagon
[45:20.640 --> 45:24.920]  Braggs this is how they control our society they control the resources they
[45:24.920 --> 45:30.360]  control our currency they the UN Maury Strong the head of their program in 92
[45:30.360 --> 45:34.080]  at the Rio de Janeiro summit we have as quotes in the new film said they were
[45:34.080 --> 45:38.680]  going to deindustrialize us to make us go into their control for eugenics and
[45:38.680 --> 45:44.280]  this may be the big final giant beta test to then launch the main attack in
[45:44.280 --> 45:49.160]  the next two to three years or this could be it and I think they're gauging
[45:49.160 --> 45:56.520]  testing the public testing our response and have it in between red light and
[45:56.520 --> 46:00.640]  blue and and and green light they are they are looking and I believe in the
[46:00.640 --> 46:03.920]  next week or two we're gonna make the decision and I've really learned how to
[46:03.920 --> 46:07.560]  guess what they're gonna do they're making the decision whether this is the
[46:07.560 --> 46:13.880]  final beta test or if they're gonna go live right now and God help us you know
[46:13.880 --> 46:16.880]  there was a report that came out from a meeting that would that happened in
[46:16.880 --> 46:21.520]  Washington just a couple weeks ago and one of the people from the autism
[46:21.520 --> 46:25.640]  community from safe minds wrote a report about what was happening at that
[46:25.640 --> 46:31.240]  meeting and they were talking about what level the the insider these the flu
[46:31.240 --> 46:34.280]  vaccine people who are all there there were only two people who were non
[46:34.280 --> 46:39.400]  government and CDC employee insiders at this meeting and it was an invitation
[46:39.400 --> 46:43.040]  only meeting and Barbara Lo Fisher and I'm sorry I can't remember the other
[46:43.040 --> 46:46.120]  woman saying but she's from safe minds was at this meeting and she wrote a
[46:46.120 --> 46:49.720]  report and said that you know most people when they went out and did those
[46:49.720 --> 46:53.000]  town hall meetings that the vast majority of people said they needed to go
[46:53.000 --> 46:56.800]  slow either either very slow intermediate or fast and it was the
[46:56.800 --> 47:00.200]  government officials who said we need to take this at the highest level we need
[47:00.200 --> 47:05.080]  to vaccinate everybody was 55% of them let me confirm what you're saying we had
[47:05.080 --> 47:09.720]  Wayne Madsen who went to that big international somewhat government run
[47:09.720 --> 47:15.720]  swine flu symposium three weeks ago in DC and we got their internal program and
[47:15.720 --> 47:19.080]  the cover that we broke that it was originally happening as a listener in
[47:19.080 --> 47:25.320]  DC sent it to us and then we covered it all and no that was discussed openly and
[47:25.320 --> 47:29.000]  then one of the government people said kick the media out of here turn off
[47:29.000 --> 47:32.840]  recording devices and the whole thing was about what will the public accept
[47:32.840 --> 47:38.000]  and now we we broke at prisonplanet.com last week an article that had the
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.960]  government document in it they're sending to business owners even small
[47:41.960 --> 47:45.880]  ones and the questionnaires they're saying will you forcibly inoculate your
[47:45.880 --> 47:49.320]  employees will you do what you're told will you go to quarantine centers so
[47:49.320 --> 47:54.800]  it's confirmed the feds are testing with their antennae out in the wind to
[47:54.800 --> 47:58.240]  decide if they're going to make their move we're being studied by the
[47:58.240 --> 48:03.600]  psychological warfare system right now they're making the decision and God
[48:03.600 --> 48:10.360]  help us well Alex what's the solution here how do we mobilize people to to to
[48:10.360 --> 48:13.160]  make a decision of what they're going to do to protect their families in their
[48:13.160 --> 48:18.840]  community how do we get what's the how to I mean there's you know we we send out
[48:18.840 --> 48:22.480]  a lot of information I mean you give information hour after hour every day I
[48:22.480 --> 48:26.800]  do a lot of radio I'm on the internet a lot I write a lot of articles and the
[48:26.800 --> 48:30.040]  bottom line is people say okay this is great I'm hearing what you're saying but
[48:30.040 --> 48:35.400]  what should I do what's my how to well we want we can't tell you get sunshine and
[48:35.400 --> 48:38.680]  get colloidal silver we can't I mean we're telling you they're going to set up
[48:38.680 --> 48:42.160]  checkpoints so they decide to drop the hammer all I can do is try to reach as
[48:42.160 --> 48:46.160]  many people as I can and then spend up most my time is trying to fund my
[48:46.160 --> 48:51.880]  operation I mean it's not a powerlessness we know we have we're
[48:51.880 --> 48:54.760]  reaching more people than ever but it doesn't look like it's enough soon enough
[48:54.760 --> 48:59.520]  and I don't know what are the solutions doctor I mean all I can do is sit here and
[48:59.520 --> 49:03.760]  go okay bear no only put HIV and hepatitis and all these shots and killed
[49:03.760 --> 49:08.640]  all these people MSNBC okay they nerve gas troops and project shed okay they
[49:08.640 --> 49:12.800]  radiated foster children 4,300 of them I wouldn't trust anything this government
[49:12.800 --> 49:18.280]  does okay the White House science are wrote a 1,100 page government textbook
[49:18.280 --> 49:21.600]  saying they want to poison us and sterilizes through vaccines and water
[49:21.600 --> 49:25.400]  and the UN's declassified that in tetanus shots they sterilized Asian
[49:25.400 --> 49:29.200]  African Latin American women I mean we know they're a bunch of lunatic Nazi
[49:29.200 --> 49:32.800]  killers and they just keep killing us it's like I live in Nazi Germany and I'm
[49:32.800 --> 49:37.360]  going Hitler's bad Hitler's bad Hitler's bad and I send my guys to

[49:45.880 --> 49:51.840]  mean it's just it's just insanity so is there any hope I mean what are we what

[54:18.240 --> 54:21.720]  openly announcing the end of the dollar in the next couple years openly
[54:21.720 --> 54:26.280]  announcing global government is so much is happening and they need this crisis
[54:26.280 --> 54:29.840]  of the flu the un bragged couple months ago this was great for world
[54:29.840 --> 54:34.120]  government everybody was following the world health organization orders is it
[54:34.120 --> 54:37.760]  a moral so I tell people I was doing anything illegal but now they're making
[54:37.760 --> 54:41.880]  everything illegal that people around the country are going to Walgreens and
[54:41.880 --> 54:49.400]  spring flu shot is poison squalene mercury on the side of Walgreens I don't
[54:49.400 --> 54:53.880]  think you should do that but you probably should you know put up basic facts
[54:53.880 --> 54:57.920]  handout flyers go to sherry ten pennies website hand those out to people that's
[54:57.920 --> 55:02.080]  your first amendment right but if the flu shot causes gillian berets with
[55:02.080 --> 55:06.440]  anybody if it causes neurological problems if this has happened in the past
[55:06.440 --> 55:14.440]  is it more immoral to not warn people and let them die or get sick or is it more
[55:14.440 --> 55:19.120]  immoral to spray paint on the side of Walgreens dr. sherry ten penny well I
[55:19.120 --> 55:23.600]  don't know about immoral but it's certainly could be illegal I think that
[55:23.600 --> 55:27.800]  there's other ways I mean I I saw your report on that and I saw the letters
[55:27.800 --> 55:30.560]  that I saw what you wrote underneath there and I agree you know nobody's
[55:30.560 --> 55:35.200]  condoning people to go out and do vandalism and do that but you know on
[55:35.200 --> 55:39.080]  the other hand you know you know good for them that they were brave enough to do
[55:39.080 --> 55:43.440]  it because I think that we've been so indoctrinated with fear for so long
[55:43.440 --> 55:47.680]  fear from so many different areas that we're afraid to stand up and say and
[55:47.680 --> 55:52.000]  go hand out flyers you know I keep it when I go to if you go to pandemic blue
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.400]  online dot com or you go to dr. ten penny dot com and you download the flyer
[55:56.400 --> 56:00.240]  that says the truth about the flu shot there's another one on pandemic blue
[56:00.240 --> 56:03.600]  online that's about the raggedy and doll and it tells you the whole history of
[56:03.600 --> 56:07.480]  what the mandatory vaccination is about I keep a stack of those in the back of
[56:07.480 --> 56:13.040]  my car and when I go into restaurants or I go into places like Macy's or
[56:13.040 --> 56:16.520]  others or Walmart or any place like that I just take a handful of them and I
[56:16.520 --> 56:18.960]  just walk down the aisle and I just say here's something you might want to look
[56:18.960 --> 56:22.680]  at I don't engage in conversation I don't want to debate and I don't really
[56:22.680 --> 56:26.280]  much care if they just throw them in the trash but you never know where those
[56:26.280 --> 56:30.880]  might go that person may take those and make 500 copies and hand them out to
[56:30.880 --> 56:35.080]  everybody and I think what you're saying is resistance is victory you have the
[56:35.080 --> 56:41.200]  truth you resist banner hangs on highways posters signs city council we
[56:41.200 --> 56:44.360]  are the people yes if the listeners start which they've done it's why the
[56:44.360 --> 56:47.800]  show so powerful because of you the listeners and viewers if you go out and
[56:47.800 --> 56:51.880]  take action spread links of this video this audio to everybody you know if you
[56:51.880 --> 56:56.000]  tell people about dr. ten penny dot com if you just get involved we're
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.840]  unstoppable but if you sit there in fear that's why they're now telling people
[57:00.840 --> 57:04.440]  protest the government you're going to be put on a no-fly list if we get into
[57:04.440 --> 57:09.560]  that they win I mean that is ultimate tyranny to say no judge no jury we just
[57:09.560 --> 57:12.960]  put you on a secret list did you know that that just happened to my people in

[1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:52.960]  show and another show you know RBN with dr. Chew off and he just released some
[1:00:52.960 --> 1:00:58.000]  information from Bob Chapman saying that the there's a naval vessel somewhere
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:01.440]  off the coast it's been fully quarantined now because the ship's captain and
[1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:06.360]  petty officer and many others have died from swine flu injections well that's
[1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:12.440]  amazing we'll check that email it to riders and info wars dot com but that's
[1:01:12.440 --> 1:01:18.880]  you know always with the 1918 1976 77 it always the deadly thing only happens on
[1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:23.520]  a base and then and then they try to force inoculation dr. Sherry 10 penny
[1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:27.080]  comments on that well that would be pretty interesting to track that down to
[1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:30.280]  find out if that's true but you know I think they're suspecting those things
[1:01:30.280 --> 1:01:34.800]  Alex I'm sure you reported a couple of days ago when the when the Canadian
[1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:39.320]  government spent swine flu vaccine and syringes in body bags to the Indians in
[1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:43.280]  northern Manitoba the Indian reservations up there so was that the
[1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:47.000]  message that if you die from the flu here's your body bag there was that the
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:50.400]  message if you get your flu shots you're gonna die you're gonna die and
[1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:56.960]  here's your body bag yeah that was in the national post newspaper just off the
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:02:00.880]  charts bizarre and there's been body bag purchases the British news reports and
[1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:05.080]  the US news and all those plastic FEMA coffins they admit were purchased by the
[1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:10.960]  CDC that are kept in Georgia Alabama Colorado California and Oklahoma thank
[1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:15.560]  you so much for that tip Aaron Tom in California Tom you're on the air Alex
[1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:19.840]  thank you for your work and for having me on I have some information from a
[1:02:19.840 --> 1:02:23.560]  professor Garth Nicholson that's written hundreds of peer-reviewed medical
[1:02:23.560 --> 1:02:27.800]  journal articles yes he used to work at the MD Anderson facility we've had him
[1:02:27.800 --> 1:02:30.880]  on in fact that's a good idea to get Nicholson on about the microplasm in
[1:02:30.880 --> 1:02:35.680]  cognitus go ahead well some of his videos I posted on my myspace pages my
[1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:41.200]  space dot com slant toxic reverend I'm an environmental technologist but next to
[1:02:41.200 --> 1:02:44.760]  my icon which is a red skull and bones is a little links his videos you click on
[1:02:44.760 --> 1:02:48.600]  that he has to I posted two of his videos on the dangers of vaccines and
[1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:52.600]  another one and the biological weapons experiments on the American yeah he's a
[1:02:52.600 --> 1:02:56.640]  scientific medical doctor very prestigious right and one of the things
[1:02:56.640 --> 1:03:00.760]  he talked about was how they don't screen for these microplasmas that they're
[1:03:00.760 --> 1:03:04.720]  now are incapacitating agents non-lethal bio weapons well that's why all the
[1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:09.480]  studies in rat show vaccines are causing in rodents just incredible
[1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:15.000]  arthritis appreciate your call dr. ten penny can you comment on the RNA the
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:21.080]  viruses the German news reporting cancer viruses in the shots well yes I can on
[1:03:21.080 --> 1:03:25.280]  two points one is just to acknowledge what the caller said we've known for a
[1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:30.600]  year that at least 6% of all vaccines and these are also childhood vaccines that up
[1:03:30.600 --> 1:03:35.280]  to 6% of vaccines have Michael plasma in them they're not screened out for that
[1:03:35.280 --> 1:03:39.640]  so that's not even the the swine flu and the in the regular flu so Michael
[1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:43.800]  plasma has been getting into the population for a long time and describe
[1:03:43.800 --> 1:03:47.600]  people that don't know what that is it's like a so Michael plasma is an
[1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:51.600]  organism that's kind of the kind of live somewhere between a virus and a
[1:03:51.600 --> 1:03:56.400]  bacteria is the best way to explain it it's susceptible to antibiotics but it
[1:03:56.400 --> 1:03:59.840]  hides inside of yourself so the antibiotics aren't always effective
[1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:03.320]  and when it goes inside the cells it acts more like a virus in terms of
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:08.320]  replication and it's a very nasty bug and it can cause a lot of problems in a
[1:04:08.320 --> 1:04:11.600]  lot of health problems a lot of different health problems and there's a
[1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:16.400]  whole host of different types of Michael plasma to just a big breaking news
[1:04:16.400 --> 1:04:19.880]  I'm going to get Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson to post this right now but you
[1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:24.520]  can just Google it Navy ships under swine flu quarantine AP group of Navy
[1:04:24.520 --> 1:04:27.240]  ships under quarantine after several dozen sailors and Marines on board
[1:04:27.240 --> 1:04:31.000]  tested positive for swine flu so they're just fear mongering over that
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:34.920]  doesn't look like anybody died I help officials say at least 69 people have
[1:04:34.920 --> 1:04:39.080]  been confirmed with the virus so they make much ado about nothing but 30 some
[1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:42.240]  percent of the population already has it aren't even sick and all of them have
[1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:47.360]  since recovered so nobody's dead point there everyone they cover there's the
[1:04:47.360 --> 1:04:51.760]  key point nobody's dead on the USS Boxer Navy officials say they now
[1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:55.520]  quarantine an undetermined number of crew members with flu-like symptoms on
[1:04:55.520 --> 1:05:00.040]  four ships that are part of the USS Boxer amphibious ready group which

[1:10:39.080 --> 1:10:43.920]  life is like a Twilight Zone episode Alex you know have you heard reports from
[1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:47.960]  other parts in the world I mean other than the US are these sorts of things
[1:10:47.960 --> 1:10:52.160]  these sound wave technologies these mandatory vaccines the FEMA camps all
[1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:57.520]  this other stuff in other countries yes same simultaneously the Air Force said
[1:10:57.520 --> 1:11:02.760]  well we can't use this in Iraq in 2004 till we use it in America so they started
[1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:06.640]  using it here then saying it was a no big deal now they're rolling out microwave
[1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:10.400]  guns we've gotten confirmed reports and I saw this in Denver but it was in a
[1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:14.400]  police area when they saw me videoing it they they brought in a
[1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:24.720]  garage they have microwave guns big big mounted on Humvees listen this is such a
[1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:28.080]  police state there that they tried to talk to the military and talked to a
[1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:31.480]  spokesman last night defense link put a press release out they said and they
[1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:35.080]  said no we're not gonna talk to you get out of here then that then they got their
[1:11:35.080 --> 1:11:39.680]  license number had the police poses Alamo rental car people from the county
[1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:44.920]  there Allegheny County in Pennsylvania they called them and so no we your cars
[1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:48.800]  got no brakes bring it in and they said well we're in the cordon at g20 were
[1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:52.760]  news reporters we can't get out till tomorrow and they said well that's fine
[1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:55.800]  because I'm a police officer with the Army and FBI and you've all been put on
[1:11:55.800 --> 1:11:59.840]  terror list and your life's over boy and we know you're a terrorist and you were
[1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:04.760]  sneaking around the military base and ran all lies Sherry just I mean and they
[1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:11.400]  just think of us is dirt well and here's the thing Alex is that what you say they
[1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:16.280]  just think of us they are our neighbors they are people who live in our
[1:12:16.280 --> 1:12:21.480]  communities their job is working for the other side we have to get through to
[1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:26.120]  these people that wait a minute I'm your friend I'm your neighbor I'm an American
[1:12:26.120 --> 1:12:30.880]  I vote for presidents and people just like you do why are you doing this I
[1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:35.520]  mean we have there has to be a way we have to learn from history that you know
[1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:40.600]  when Nazi people went into when Germans started assaulting fellow Germans I mean
[1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:44.200]  all the Jews that they that they dragged away we're all Germans and that they
[1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:48.840]  hurt other Germans I mean we've got to let people get through to them stand
[1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:52.600]  there and say wait a minute you're in America why are you doing this and I
[1:12:52.600 --> 1:12:55.800]  think that passive resistance handing out flyers and trying to when you're
[1:12:55.800 --> 1:12:59.640]  standing there in the gap if you if it comes to that to remember that to remind
[1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:04.720]  these people that hey we're on the same team we're it should be us against the
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:09.400]  people that are telling you what to do not you against me we should we should
[1:13:09.400 --> 1:13:13.720]  be doing this differently why are you doing this and I think that we have got
[1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:18.360]  to start using those passive resistance tools we have to use all the mind games
[1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:22.800]  that they try to play on us and turn the tables around it and get people to
[1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:27.240]  understand that we're all Americans and if who's ever giving those orders
[1:13:27.240 --> 1:13:32.120]  against Americans that's the enemy not the person standing in front of you and
[1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:35.920]  somehow somehow I don't have all the answers Alex and I know you don't either
[1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:39.840]  but we've got to come up with some solutions for people who may be standing
[1:13:39.840 --> 1:13:44.000]  in the gap of what can they do in that moment in terms of resistance other than
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:48.480]  violence what else can they do well I want to say this approximately eight
[1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:52.280]  minutes ago we got on the phone with Douglas and he said I can hear nothing
[1:13:52.280 --> 1:13:55.200]  they're using sound weapons they're telling us to disperse Mike Nelson heard
[1:13:55.200 --> 1:14:00.120]  the war and the troops stopping every 30 seconds you're saying disperse disperse
[1:14:00.120 --> 1:14:03.560]  we've got them let's go to live now here they are from Pittsburgh g20 under
[1:14:03.560 --> 1:14:10.840]  attack wait Mike just said they had them put them on the system that's why we
[1:14:10.840 --> 1:14:18.680]  punch them up yes yes is this Rob do yeah well on Liberty and kind of a
[1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:23.320]  downtown part of Pittsburgh we just passed a they had a block the tree

[1:15:54.200 --> 1:15:58.680]  press or not they didn't disperse and then they started like launching the the
[1:15:58.680 --> 1:16:03.000]  weapon so people don't have a permitted march violating the first of them you

[1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:31.500]  terms of with billy clubs or anything but they were working with police to
[1:16:31.500 --> 1:16:35.840]  cordon off areas and they had Humvees right now I'm looking at a line of

[1:17:10.760 --> 1:17:14.480]  were walking down Liberty Street and right as we're getting to 34th they had
[1:17:14.480 --> 1:17:17.600]  the street blocked off and they were talking to us through the little sound
[1:17:17.600 --> 1:17:20.960]  cannon things and then they would press them you know just to do a beep it'd be
[1:17:20.960 --> 1:17:24.120]  like beep beep beep beep but it would get really loud for a split second and they
[1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:27.360]  would turn it down and they bring it back up again and then turn it down just
[1:17:27.360 --> 1:17:30.560]  to let you know that they could do that you know it was it was definitely a
[1:17:30.560 --> 1:17:35.200]  show force and there's probably I'm looking at about 300 military right now
[1:17:35.200 --> 1:17:43.800]  and Douglas said it was painful was it painful it didn't get
[1:17:43.800 --> 1:17:46.520]  loud to where it was painful but it got loud as you know they could turn it up
[1:17:46.520 --> 1:17:49.960]  louder they were they were throwing it up at us just to let us know when people
[1:17:49.960 --> 1:17:53.400]  started crouching down on cars and mailboxes because they thought they were
[1:17:53.400 --> 1:17:56.520]  gonna do the real thing on like what were they what were I think they did do
[1:17:56.520 --> 1:17:59.440]  the real thing on you buddy because what Douglas said but do always is a
[1:17:59.440 --> 1:18:08.480]  cheerful person do whatever the point is Rob specifically what were they
[1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:12.880]  broadcasting in English and I have that on tape and basically what they were
[1:18:12.880 --> 1:18:16.440]  saying is that we're in an unlawful assembly and the chief police order to
[1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:21.000]  disperse and if we don't disperse you'll be arrested they may use a non they say

[1:18:54.040 --> 1:18:58.600]  were blasting and as that happened I basically turned around saw about 40
[1:18:58.600 --> 1:19:03.240]  riot police assisted by military and I ran up and I got all the footage I could

[1:33:07.640 --> 1:33:11.280]  come after your guns if you don't think the military doesn't want to disarm you
[1:33:11.280 --> 1:33:14.880]  if you don't think they don't aren't spoiling for a fight with us I don't
[1:33:14.880 --> 1:33:19.280]  care what they say we've proven that they are ready look at Ken State and our
[1:33:19.280 --> 1:33:24.200]  military's been taken over you have you have to G20 global leaders meeting
[1:33:24.200 --> 1:33:28.480]  openly in mainstream news to get rid of the dollar and bring in quote global
[1:33:28.480 --> 1:33:32.880]  governance this is the end of our country and the police in the military are
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:36.680]  acting like people that don't like it or pure scum and terrorist because the DHS
[1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:41.800]  has trained them to do that mermis what's happening now I am backing off but
[1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:46.800]  a good majority of the protesters mostly anarchists and black and front are
[1:33:46.800 --> 1:33:50.600]  making it down you could probably hear them right now then this is probably a
[1:33:50.600 --> 1:33:54.240]  staged event they're with the police they're probably gonna go to a normal
[1:33:54.240 --> 1:33:58.800]  protest and then try to claim that get out of there all right are you getting
[1:33:58.800 --> 1:34:04.240]  away from them I'm backing up and back up how far away are you from them I'm
[1:34:04.240 --> 1:34:11.600]  probably about one 200 and so the L rad is further away and and in what
[1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:17.320]  drove them back yeah what they've been doing is as the police now in certain
[1:34:17.320 --> 1:34:20.960]  areas they'll take certain side streets because we're outside of the main city of
[1:34:20.960 --> 1:34:25.040]  Pittsburgh this started in Lawrence about a mile and a half away and
[1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:30.520]  originally in the park the riot police had gathered and they had they decided
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:34.280]  that they would go the other direction there were no riot police set up there
[1:34:34.280 --> 1:34:39.920]  at first then the police cordoned them off the sound weapons were they then
[1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:44.800]  moved to the right hand side by the time it turned around to cover the protesters
[1:34:44.800 --> 1:34:49.840]  the majority of them were already gone this is the first time that I've been
[1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:52.920]  around them but I can already tell that they've been able to disperse the crowd
[1:34:52.920 --> 1:34:59.280]  by at least at least three fifths I mean if this crowd was much larger than it
[1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:04.720]  was before and just to be clear just to be clear don't stay at the head of them
[1:35:04.720 --> 1:35:08.560]  go down a side street get out of there right now okay I am on a side street
[1:35:08.560 --> 1:35:12.640]  right now and they're passing Alex I have no police there at this point they
[1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:15.640]  have not caught up all right well you're gonna see the police following them
[1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:19.480]  later they'll be hungry for blood and to engage their enemy the American people
[1:35:19.480 --> 1:35:23.560]  and so they may corner you in that alley or side streets
[1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:29.000]  here come the anarchist staging here they come right now they're there they just grabbed a dumpster
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:35.440]  they're flipping it over and I got it I got it on tape right now I don't want to put you in danger Jason but
[1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:41.000]  if you follow that stinking fed is it a big guy three people and of course they
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:44.560]  haven't asked on Alex I I earlier followed a couple people that I caught
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:50.080]  spray-painting a couple that were throwing eggs I mean I am not you know I
[1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:54.200]  am desperately trying to cover this but that's what I can you are kicking butt my
[1:35:54.200 --> 1:36:02.520]  friend so so the operatives the operatives are recap so we have a
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:08.280]  record you did see military with the LRAP police and you've talked to military
[1:36:08.280 --> 1:36:14.080]  today yes I talked to military earlier today they were at a there were five
[1:36:14.080 --> 1:36:19.360]  people outside of a home be basically most of the homies in the military
[1:36:19.360 --> 1:36:23.640]  were courting me off at checkpoints on Main Street in the main city of Pittsburgh
[1:36:23.640 --> 1:36:28.040]  I approached them I asked them what their mission was they said it was to
[1:36:28.040 --> 1:36:31.640]  assist the police I asked them what they would have to stay to their critics
[1:36:31.640 --> 1:36:35.240]  that this was a violation of policy comment on it and of course none of them
[1:36:35.240 --> 1:36:38.600]  knew that what that was I then had to explain to them that that was the
[1:36:38.600 --> 1:36:43.040]  separation of military and police and it was the standard boilerplate answer of
[1:36:43.040 --> 1:36:50.160]  you know we're just following orders unbelievable now you did see troops
[1:36:50.160 --> 1:37:06.080]  National Guard or Army with the police with the LRAD cannon
[1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:13.920]  although they told me they were police however they had no police numbers no
[1:37:13.920 --> 1:37:23.560]  I think they're lying to me as well of course that's what they do to their
[1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:27.540]  enemy the American people Burmese briefly we're gonna go to Sherry Tim
[1:37:27.540 --> 1:37:32.640]  penny briefly tell folks about last night you guys pull up to the gate you
[1:37:32.640 --> 1:37:36.080]  have to talk to the public information officer they called the police and lied
[1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:41.080]  and said that you were sneaking around you ran from them is that true
[1:37:41.080 --> 1:37:45.480]  absolutely not you know we went up to the main gate we asked the officer if
[1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:49.640]  he could discuss all what the 2,500 troops would be doing and Pittsburgh
[1:37:49.640 --> 1:37:52.680]  tomorrow he said he couldn't even told us that he could get a representative
[1:37:52.680 --> 1:37:55.960]  that could or a phone number we then pulled off to the side of the road where
[1:37:55.960 --> 1:38:00.320]  they instructed us to we made it around 15 or 20 minutes a representative came
[1:38:00.320 --> 1:38:04.320]  back immediately he was hostile towards us he did not like our credentials he
[1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:07.400]  said he would not answer our question yeah I heard him I was on cell phone with
[1:38:07.400 --> 1:38:12.040]  you go ahead exactly and you know we tried to get as much information as we
[1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:15.320]  could he refused to answer our questions so then Rob asked him for his
[1:38:15.320 --> 1:38:19.560]  information and where we could contact him tomorrow if we could get a word with
[1:38:19.560 --> 1:38:23.560]  him he then gave it and we left we didn't run away from anything by the time
[1:38:23.560 --> 1:38:27.840]  that we had left turned around and exited the main military facility there
[1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:32.760]  was another car parked on the other side of the road waited for us past follow
[1:38:32.760 --> 1:38:38.360]  us for an exit then I got off and then we were shot when Douglass got a call
[1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:42.600]  trying to entrap him and have us go return our rental car for quote-unquote
[1:38:42.600 --> 1:38:48.520]  two more free days when we didn't fall for that he then came clean and said he
[1:38:48.520 --> 1:38:52.040]  was actually military personnel and he wanted to know whether or not we were
[1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:56.520]  terrorists salad and then he told Douglas you're on a list now pal for the
[1:38:56.520 --> 1:39:02.120]  rest of your life with pleasure and they'll take your houses they'll take
[1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:06.080]  your guns they'll take your wives they do it all over the world they want to do

[1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:53.880]  but see what the cops do is they make the protesters think they're in control and only block certain streets and they will herd them to a to to a dead end where all the cops are waiting with tear gas and rubber bullets and I got video and all they'll walk up to an old lady

[1:45:16.880 --> 1:45:32.880]  well you know we've just been trying to get lawfully assembled and peaceably marched but we were just in a place where there was like 600 cops in full riot gear and they are and they do have the sound weapons and they do have the microwave weapons so
[1:45:32.880 --> 1:45:46.880]  oh wait you saw the microwave gun oh heck yeah oh my god those things can kill you on on on having and we were really close to you know this is America Alex this is the country my son died for
[1:45:46.880 --> 1:45:56.880]  where you can't even exercise your first amendment right Cindy Sheehan give us a quick report what have you seen with the L rat and the microwave guns
[1:45:56.880 --> 1:46:06.880]  well they have them and that's how they're using it I don't think that they've turned them on or they haven't turned them on where I've been but there is L rat here and they're warning
[1:46:06.880 --> 1:46:10.880]  no they turned them on they've turned them on oh my gosh we've heard it
[1:46:10.880 --> 1:46:36.880]  they say I wasn't where they were trying just trying to get to downtown so we can exercise our freedom of speech Alex and you know they're blocking peaceful protesters we don't have any weapons they're blocking us with the most disastrous horrible weapons that they can think of and so yeah it's just really awful down here
[1:46:36.880 --> 1:46:56.880]  and they've also learned how to get around vinegar if you soak your bandana vinegar it's supposed to stop the tear gas but they've put baking soda in their tear gas so it'll make the bandana even more dangerous
[1:46:56.880 --> 1:47:10.880]  this is just incredible and here you are constantly fighting and Martha's vineyard in Crawford Texas right Cindy did you know they're openly announcing the formation of the world government at this meeting yes I know they are yes I do
[1:47:10.880 --> 1:47:29.880]  I mean even the head of the EU even spoke out against it Klaus at the UN yesterday and they're openly announcing the end of the dollar those troops don't know that their whole savings and their whole family future is gone and there they are with pleasure guarding the very government that is illegitimate and criminal

[1:49:02.880 --> 1:49:11.880]  I heard that LRAD again it was over to the right and maybe two blocks up I can't really see any of the protesters at this point

[1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:51.880]  all the scumbag bankers that are robbing our country are arriving live right now
[1:50:51.880 --> 1:50:56.880]  while our police and military bought off and brainwashed by them are having their way with people
[1:50:56.880 --> 1:51:00.880]  with a few staged anarchist I guarantee you are either feds or police
[1:51:00.880 --> 1:51:04.880]  what would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality
[1:51:04.880 --> 1:51:06.880]  feeling better than you have in years
[1:51:06.880 --> 1:51:08.880]  and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns
[1:51:08.880 --> 1:51:11.880]  blood sugar levels and had a sense of well-being overall
[1:51:11.880 --> 1:51:14.880]  there's something that is changing thousands of people's lives
[1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:17.880]  and you could be one of them it's called heart and body extract
[1:51:17.880 --> 1:51:20.880]  Sharon Harris co-creator of heart and body extract
[1:51:20.880 --> 1:51:23.880]  talks about the positive effects of heart and body extract
[1:51:23.880 --> 1:51:26.880]  what happens with the formula heart and body extract
[1:51:26.880 --> 1:51:31.880]  is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes and phytonutrients
[1:51:31.880 --> 1:51:33.880]  so the body will heal itself
[1:51:33.880 --> 1:51:36.880]  and yes the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure

[1:51:39.880 --> 1:51:43.880]  it can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetic
[1:51:43.880 --> 1:51:45.880]  so the body is an amazing thing
[1:51:45.880 --> 1:51:48.880]  it simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself

[1:52:04.880 --> 1:52:06.880]  in the near future
[1:52:06.880 --> 1:52:09.880]  earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[1:52:09.880 --> 1:52:12.880]  it's known as the builder bird
[1:52:12.880 --> 1:52:15.880]  could their objective be world domination?
[1:52:15.880 --> 1:52:18.880]  for thousands of years their dark order grew
[1:52:18.880 --> 1:52:21.880]  now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[1:52:21.880 --> 1:52:26.880]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand
[1:52:28.880 --> 1:52:30.880]  for the first time in history

[1:52:38.880 --> 1:52:40.880]  builder bird is making great progress toward a world government
[1:52:40.880 --> 1:52:42.880]  most people have no idea they're not after money
[1:52:42.880 --> 1:52:44.880]  they have all the money they need
[1:52:44.880 --> 1:52:46.880]  they're after power, less they're after easier

[1:53:10.880 --> 1:53:12.880]  we've had more bank failures this year
[1:53:12.880 --> 1:53:14.880]  than the previous 10 years combined
[1:53:14.880 --> 1:53:16.880]  and money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper
[1:53:16.880 --> 1:53:18.880]  due to the nation's 12 trillion dollar debt
[1:53:18.880 --> 1:53:21.880]  which is why gold is now over a thousand dollars an ounce
[1:53:21.880 --> 1:53:23.880]  according to the atlanta fed chief

[1:54:10.880 --> 1:54:12.880]  this is all about equipment
[1:54:12.880 --> 1:54:17.120]  poses anarchists in every case. They've been caught over and over again. That's why they're using
[1:54:17.120 --> 1:54:21.840]  sound guns, microwave weapons. We know they use the sound guns. The microwave guns are there.
[1:54:22.640 --> 1:54:25.760]  Amazing to have Bermas and Sidney, she and all these people together,
[1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:31.440]  they're standing as turning, she lost her son. And the military will follow orders. And that's
[1:54:31.440 --> 1:54:36.720]  all this is. And there are the bankers openly setting up world government bankrupting us by design.
[1:54:36.720 --> 1:54:43.600]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, this is how the Republic falls with the stormtroopers in the streets
[1:54:43.600 --> 1:54:47.920]  and the world leaders coming to our country to sell it out of the mainstream news reporting it.
[1:54:48.960 --> 1:54:54.400]  Yes. Alex, why are they in Pittsburgh? Of all the cities in America, why Pittsburgh?
[1:54:56.160 --> 1:55:00.720]  Because it's got a lot of draconian laws in Pennsylvania from what we've seen with them.
[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:06.400]  Do they have a local Patriot Act, a state Patriot Act? And they chose it because they
[1:55:06.400 --> 1:55:11.840]  like cities that have tyranny like London and DC and places like that. And they've chosen it to
[1:55:11.840 --> 1:55:15.840]  come here and kill the dollar in America. It's a big joke to them. I mean, it's all over the news.
[1:55:15.840 --> 1:55:21.120]  World government, end of the dollar. And Ron Paul earlier, he's an economist, not just medical doctor.
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:25.760]  He said this will just, it'll be worse than the Great Depression if they kill the dollar and they
[1:55:25.760 --> 1:55:33.760]  are doing it. Wow. Well, you know what, Alex, it's things that you and I have been talking about
[1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:40.160]  and other people have been talking about for weeks, months and years and it looks like it's here.
[1:55:40.160 --> 1:55:45.200]  Well, at least we can expose the flu shot. At least we can get the flyers, the materials,
[1:55:45.200 --> 1:55:49.360]  and educate people and speak out of our city councils. This is all at the local level.
[1:55:49.360 --> 1:55:53.760]  The takeover is happening through the federal, international and everybody just better become
[1:55:53.760 --> 1:55:58.640]  info warriors and get involved today because what everybody just heard. And if this develops,
[1:55:58.640 --> 1:56:04.240]  I may do a special live broadcast to just listen to the info war streams. Ron Paul and Congressman
[1:56:04.240 --> 1:56:08.640]  Grayson, everybody are coming back up on the restreams at infowars.com and MNFM stations
[1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:14.000]  re-air the show. But as stuff develops tonight, we'll post it info wars. If we're about to go
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:20.320]  live and we'll go live on internet only at prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com. I'm here finishing
[1:56:20.320 --> 1:56:24.720]  my film for the Republic today. I'm finishing. It's done today. We're just doing some final
[1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:30.480]  things with the DVD menu and adding a few more documents. And I will be here. I mean,
[1:56:30.480 --> 1:56:34.720]  fall the Republic. This is the end of the Bill of Rights, the end of the Constitution,
[1:56:34.720 --> 1:56:38.960]  the Senate admits, the Patriot acts being used everywhere for misdemeanor crimes.
[1:56:38.960 --> 1:56:43.520]  No more warrants. The police are taking blood all over the country without warrants at checkpoints.
[1:56:43.520 --> 1:56:50.800]  I mean, doctor, it's really happening. It is happening. It is. It's really scary, Alex. I mean,
[1:56:50.800 --> 1:56:55.280]  it's really kind of frightening to see this stuff happening in real time. Now, I'm sitting,
[1:56:55.280 --> 1:57:01.440]  I'm sitting at home in my living room and they did have a little bit of a snip on CNN and on Fox
[1:57:01.440 --> 1:57:07.200]  News, but nothing like what your guys on the streets have captured. Well, here's the examiner
[1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:15.600]  newspaper reporting on these sound weapons at the Tea Parties. It says both town halls took
[1:57:15.600 --> 1:57:22.160]  place without incident. However, the use of military device concerned San Diegans. The LRAD
[1:57:22.160 --> 1:57:26.320]  crowd control is primarily used in Iraq to control insurgents and can cause serious
[1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:31.840]  and lasting harm to humans. And they admit this. I mean, this is just outrageous.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:38.480]  Well, it'll be interesting to see what unfolds for the rest of the evening. And it'll be very
[1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:44.800]  interesting tomorrow to see what's been posted on Prison Planet and what sort of news clips that
[1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:49.120]  you've actually been able to put together. Thank you for all the work you do, Alex. Thank you very
[1:57:49.120 --> 1:57:52.960]  much. Well, thank you, doctor. The website is doctortenpenny.com. And what's the other one
[1:57:52.960 --> 1:58:00.800]  for the flyers to educate people and to leave at drugstores? Pandemicfluonline.com. Pandemicfluonline.com.
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:04.640]  Click on the toolbox and everything there for you. God bless you, doctor. We'll talk to you
[1:58:04.640 --> 1:58:10.240]  again soon. All right, take care. This unfolds. We're going to rebroadcast right now, but I
[1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:16.080]  could go live the next 20 minutes again only on the infowars.com streams and prisonplanet.tv
[1:58:16.080 --> 1:58:21.600]  video. So watch this space. We won't be on the AM and FM until tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central
[1:58:21.600 --> 1:58:27.120]  Standard Time, 12 noon Eastern on the AM and FM and the shortwave of WWCR doing a great job.
[1:58:28.480 --> 1:58:31.920]  Pray for my guys. Pray for everybody there. Pray for Cindy Sheehan.
[1:58:31.920 --> 1:58:35.840]  Great job, crew. Great job, Genesis and everybody that makes this show possible.
[1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:38.960]  We will continue to defend the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[1:58:38.960 --> 1:58:48.000]  The Republic is being brought down right. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:50.640 --> 1:58:54.000]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:57.680]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[1:58:57.680 --> 1:59:01.680]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson,
[1:59:01.680 --> 1:59:06.160]  Illinois. These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it
[1:59:06.160 --> 1:59:11.440]  most. Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces
[1:59:11.440 --> 1:59:15.920]  electricity for free. It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[1:59:16.480 --> 1:59:21.280]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers and even keep food from spoiling.
[1:59:21.280 --> 1:59:26.160]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through
[1:59:26.160 --> 1:59:31.360]  painful power outages again. When the power goes out, you'll be ready. With a solar power
[1:59:31.360 --> 1:59:38.000]  generator from Solutions from Science, go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[1:59:38.000 --> 2:00:01.600]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365. Don't wait. Call today.
[2:00:08.640 --> 2:00:16.800]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[2:00:16.800 --> 2:00:21.600]  network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:27.120 --> 2:00:32.560]  It is Friday, ladies and gentlemen. Alex Jones here, breaking in with a live report. Also,
[2:00:32.560 --> 2:00:40.960]  beyond a little bit longer at the end of the radio show today, obviously, everyone is reeling
[2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:45.280]  right now. And I've been reading the preliminary reports coming out even from a lot of mainstream
[2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:51.680]  media, especially foreign press. And all of this Obama worship is falling flat on its face.
[2:00:51.680 --> 2:00:56.560]  They made him the first U.S. president to be the sitting head of the UN Security Council,
[2:00:56.560 --> 2:01:01.920]  which holds all of the power in the United Nations. The world government set up by the
[2:01:01.920 --> 2:01:10.320]  Anglo-American establishment publicly to establish world government. That's why the
[2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:14.160]  International Olympic Committee, even though it has a lot of globalists on it, didn't give it to
[2:01:14.160 --> 2:01:19.680]  Obama because the whole world is sick and tired of them selling him as the savior,
[2:01:19.680 --> 2:01:24.560]  the second coming of Jesus, to this planet. So that's certainly bluffing their face.
[2:01:24.560 --> 2:01:31.600]  Now they've given him not just the Nobel Prize, but a Nobel Peace Prize when he has expanded
[2:01:31.600 --> 2:01:37.680]  the war in Afghanistan, continued the war in Iraq, gone back on his promises there.
[2:01:38.480 --> 2:01:43.360]  And of course, he has engaged in all sorts of police state activities worldwide and delivered
[2:01:45.120 --> 2:01:51.280]  the biggest defense budget in U.S. history over $1 trillion. And that's before special
[2:01:51.280 --> 2:01:58.320]  supplemental funding for the war efforts, the actual combat. So this guy is a complete fraud.
[2:01:58.320 --> 2:02:04.480]  And look, the Nobel Prize, early on, of course, Nobel who invented dynamite,
[2:02:04.480 --> 2:02:09.760]  it saved tens of thousands of miners. It's exposed them for very, very dangerous. They
[2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:14.880]  still are, obviously, but a lot less with dynamite compared to the more primitive system they had.
[2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:20.560]  And the Nobel Prize has been given to some good people. But now, in the last 20 years or so,
[2:02:20.560 --> 2:02:25.440]  it's a complete fraud, a complete joke. They gave Al Gore one for his global warming garbage
[2:02:25.440 --> 2:02:31.360]  and his call for a world tax. They've now given one to this lawyer, a slick, good-looking lawyer
[2:02:31.360 --> 2:02:36.400]  who can read off the teleprompter, who lies about everything. They've given it to a lawyer
[2:02:36.400 --> 2:02:41.520]  who was in the U.S. Senate for four years. And it's just totally cheap and it's a joke. But
[2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:48.720]  remember that the Watson gentleman who discovered the double helix in DNA, he won an award from
[2:02:48.720 --> 2:02:53.840]  these guys. And he's the guy that says, black people are not human beings. And had to step down
[2:02:53.840 --> 2:02:59.440]  from the Cold Springs Harbor IVM, eugenics, death lab at Cold Springs Harbor. So that's
[2:02:59.440 --> 2:03:04.960]  just a bunch of elitists scum giving themselves an award, trying to prop Obama up, trying to sell
[2:03:04.960 --> 2:03:10.560]  him as the savior. It turns out they made this decision when he'd only been in office two weeks.
[2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:15.920]  So they were setting him up to be our world government savior, to bring the United States
[2:03:15.920 --> 2:03:19.600]  into world government, to bring the rest of the planet into world government. Two weeks ago,
[2:03:19.600 --> 2:03:28.320]  as you know, they handed the United Nations over to, they handed the internet system
[2:03:28.320 --> 2:03:33.680]  to ICANN completely, the private corporation, that says that the United Nations will be in
[2:03:33.680 --> 2:03:37.920]  control of it. So they're moving into the internet, too, to shut down free speech there and bring
[2:03:37.920 --> 2:03:42.720]  the internet under international law. And they end the free speech. They're getting the FCC ready
[2:03:42.720 --> 2:03:49.440]  to regulate and control the web. You notice the G20 is now announcing that they're getting rid of
[2:03:49.440 --> 2:03:53.920]  the dollar, preparing to phase it out. Notice everything is happening right now. And this is
[2:03:53.920 --> 2:03:58.240]  only the beginning of going down the slide. But we're now going down the slide, and we'll only
[2:03:58.240 --> 2:04:03.760]  accelerate into total tyranny in world government. Meanwhile, Paul Watson is doing a detailed report
[2:04:05.360 --> 2:04:12.240]  about this huge, vicious hit piece that is in the New Republic, which is the official mouthpiece
[2:04:12.240 --> 2:04:18.240]  of the establishment eugenics left, viciously attacking me, twisting everything I've said,
[2:04:18.240 --> 2:04:23.200]  and declaring that I'm a dangerous enemy to the elite. So that dovetails with the fact that I'm
[2:04:23.200 --> 2:04:28.240]  on the White House enemies list, nicely. And we're suddenly seeing that confirmed that that is indeed
[2:04:28.240 --> 2:04:35.280]  accurate by all these other big establishment organs coming out and attacking me. So we're
[2:04:35.280 --> 2:04:40.000]  definitely drawing blood on the New World Order. We're definitely targeting the real elite, bypassing
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:44.560]  their puppet frontmen, and they're not happy. So let's continue to expose the bankers and the true
[2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:48.720]  planetary government bringing in total tyranny. We'll be right back with more analysis. Please
[2:04:48.720 --> 2:05:06.000]  stay with us. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle
[2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:11.200]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I
[2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:16.880]  can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[2:05:16.880 --> 2:05:22.160]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[2:05:22.160 --> 2:05:26.800]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[2:05:26.800 --> 2:05:31.360]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[2:05:31.360 --> 2:05:36.720]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[2:05:36.720 --> 2:05:42.080]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How
[2:05:42.080 --> 2:05:47.280]  much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight
[2:05:47.280 --> 2:05:56.480]  another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number
[2:05:56.480 --> 2:06:05.280]  1-800-409-5633. The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[2:06:05.280 --> 2:06:09.760]  you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center? Buying their processed food that makes
[2:06:09.760 --> 2:06:15.520]  you sick? Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.

[2:07:02.640 --> 2:07:07.520]  each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent
[2:07:07.520 --> 2:07:13.360]  study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants
[2:07:13.360 --> 2:07:17.840]  are present in municipal drinking water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer,
[2:07:17.840 --> 2:07:22.720]  reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases. Now what are you going to do about it?
[2:07:22.720 --> 2:07:27.920]  The Acola Blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and
[2:07:27.920 --> 2:07:33.120]  your family's drinking water. The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity
[2:07:33.120 --> 2:07:38.480]  in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent
[2:07:38.480 --> 2:07:44.000]  light sterilization techniques. That's right, clean water right from the air you breathe. Order
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:57.840]  today by calling 1-800-691-6043. That's 1-800-691-6043 or visit Acola Blue on the web at www.ecoloblu.com
[2:07:57.840 --> 2:08:15.600]  today at www.ecoloblu.com. I was just listening to the ad that ran. It's a local, so a lot of stations
[2:08:15.600 --> 2:08:19.920]  probably didn't hear it, but it's the EatFoods Direct ad that I cut a year and a half ago.
[2:08:21.440 --> 2:08:25.440]  And I said, will you have storable foods or will you be forced
[2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:31.120]  to go to the inoculation centers? Now how did I make an ad a year and a half ago
[2:08:31.680 --> 2:08:36.400]  saying they would be trying to forcibly inoculate you with inoculation centers now being announced,
[2:08:36.960 --> 2:08:43.040]  now as they ease it out there? Because we got the secret FEMA training manuals three years ago,
[2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:48.000]  a year and a half before it was declassified, of the tens of thousands of clergy being secretly
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:53.280]  hired by FEMA, and the training manual said, tell them it's of God to turn your guns in.
[2:08:53.280 --> 2:09:00.960]  It's of God to go to the FEMA camp and be inoculated to submit. It's of God to do all of this.
[2:09:00.960 --> 2:09:07.440]  And so we then knew that was one of their main battle plans. Then in January, we saw them telling
[2:09:07.440 --> 2:09:12.800]  local police get ready for martial law, the flu's coming. That's why we knew in January, rolled into
[2:09:12.800 --> 2:09:18.160]  April, and then it came out. We knew it was level six, three months before it became mainstream news.
[2:09:18.160 --> 2:09:23.600]  And we've warned so many people about what's happening, that it's going to be hard for the
[2:09:23.600 --> 2:09:26.880]  globalists to carry this out. We're going to go to Dr. Stan Monk teeth in one moment,
[2:09:26.880 --> 2:09:30.960]  but finishing up with Luca and Bridget from Mojave County, Minuteman and Mojave County
[2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:37.760]  Oathkeepers. Final comments from both of you. Alex, I want to say one thing. We need to be
[2:09:37.760 --> 2:09:42.480]  proactive, as you know, as you say, information is the first way from, and then we need also
[2:09:42.480 --> 2:09:46.240]  start to make this information active in the community. Otherwise, if we keep it for ourselves,
[2:09:46.240 --> 2:09:50.960]  it's not the only thing. One important thing we're doing this Saturday and Sunday,
[2:09:50.960 --> 2:09:55.600]  and this is part of the knowledge we must know. We have Apple Street coming in Kingdom.
[2:09:55.600 --> 2:10:03.760]  It's free class of a clinic how to become a rifleman for women and for teenagers till 21,
[2:10:03.760 --> 2:10:09.520]  and also for all the people in active duty. Please come. We post the information on Mojave,
[2:10:09.520 --> 2:10:14.400]  Minuteman.com, because this is not the way we're going to somehow prepare for what's coming. We
[2:10:14.400 --> 2:10:18.880]  need to know the information, but also we need to know the skills that our founder's father has.
[2:10:19.520 --> 2:10:24.160]  Pray for the best, but hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
[2:10:24.160 --> 2:10:30.160]  Exactly. Exactly. And just what for me is just like Luca said, I'm going to do Apple
[2:10:30.160 --> 2:10:35.520]  Street. You know, we're aware. We open our mouths. We ask questions. We're not afraid.
[2:10:35.520 --> 2:10:40.400]  We learn to shoot. We don't shut up. We're learning everything we can. We're spreading the word.
[2:10:40.400 --> 2:10:45.680]  And if the New World Order thinks that they're going to be able to take us over without a fight,
[2:10:45.680 --> 2:10:50.720]  I think they miscalculated that there's too many people just like us from coast to coast.
[2:10:50.720 --> 2:10:53.520]  They're going to have a big, fat fight on their hands if they want to.
[2:10:53.520 --> 2:10:56.320]  Well, they're going to stage events, though. They're going to kill their own troops and
[2:10:56.320 --> 2:10:59.920]  blame it on us. They're going to bomb federal buildings and blame it on us. We're going into a
[2:10:59.920 --> 2:11:05.600]  very dark time. But remember, we know they did it just like Hitler with Gliwitz and Reichstag.
[2:11:05.600 --> 2:11:08.640]  We know they're staging the events. We know they've released the flu.
[2:11:08.640 --> 2:11:13.680]  We know they're staging all of this. This is only another big drill, in my opinion.
[2:11:13.680 --> 2:11:17.760]  God bless you. We'll continue to check in with you as things develop. Take care of yourselves.
[2:11:17.760 --> 2:11:19.920]  We love you, Alex. We love you, Alex.
[2:11:19.920 --> 2:11:24.320]  We love you. Take an action as well. And folks, go to city councils, go to county commissioners.
[2:11:25.600 --> 2:11:33.440]  I remember in 1999, the SWAT team came in and threatened me at a county commissioners meeting,
[2:11:33.440 --> 2:11:40.560]  not to speak. It was on video, on TV. I said, I'm going to speak. Then after the SWAT team commander,
[2:11:40.560 --> 2:11:44.240]  it was in the same county convention building, asked me, was actually across the street. He said,
[2:11:44.240 --> 2:11:48.160]  please come to my office. And he said, look, I'm a Vietnam vet. There's not going to be troops
[2:11:48.160 --> 2:11:53.280]  in Austin. There's no martial law coming. He said, I would never allow that. Lieutenant Beck,
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:57.280]  they later got mad at him and ran him out because he said things like this.
[2:11:57.280 --> 2:12:01.520]  And I said, listen to me. They're paying off police chiefs. And I gave him videos of it.
[2:12:01.520 --> 2:12:04.560]  Police chiefs I interviewed, they tried to pay off. San Antonio police chief.
[2:12:05.280 --> 2:12:09.920]  And I said, Delta Force will visit you. They're visiting all the major cities now.
[2:12:09.920 --> 2:12:14.240]  Austin was about 700,000 people then. I said, they're going to come to you soon.
[2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:18.640]  He laughed at me. A couple of months later, he calls up and says, can you come to my office?
[2:12:18.640 --> 2:12:23.680]  He goes, here's Delta Force's card. He said, everything you said is true. Tell me more.
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:30.080]  And then he said, how do you know all this being so young? So I was like 24 or something.
[2:12:30.080 --> 2:12:34.320]  I remember how old I was. Yeah, about 24, 25. I looked really young and he said,
[2:12:34.320 --> 2:12:38.480]  who are you with? Are you with the government? Is this a thing in the government fighting each
[2:12:38.480 --> 2:12:44.400]  other? And I said, no, I'm with the American people. I mean, they just can't believe that
[2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:48.880]  citizens would be involved and informed in running counterintelligence against this
[2:12:48.880 --> 2:12:52.720]  global corporate takeover. Look, somebody's got to do it. I never claimed to have all
[2:12:52.720 --> 2:12:57.920]  the answers or be the best at this. We're just a ragtag group going toe to toe with
[2:12:57.920 --> 2:13:02.560]  the new world order and they're psyops. But if you just start understanding everything
[2:13:02.560 --> 2:13:08.720]  they say is the opposite, everything they say is a lie or a distortion. I've got mainstream news
[2:13:08.720 --> 2:13:13.360]  we're going to cover with Dr. Monteef admitting that they chose a plastic of thousands of plastic
[2:13:13.360 --> 2:13:21.680]  formulas for worldwide adoption in the sixties that sterilizes the men. The White House science
[2:13:21.680 --> 2:13:25.120]  are admits they're putting this stuff in the water that they want. I mean, folks,
[2:13:25.120 --> 2:13:32.160]  this, the military and the police, I'm not your enemy. I don't have some macho head up thing of
[2:13:32.160 --> 2:13:38.080]  fantasy of having war with you. I don't, I hate what you do though. I hate your ignorance. I hate
[2:13:38.080 --> 2:13:44.880]  your denial. I just wish you'd research. This is important. This is real.
[2:13:47.760 --> 2:13:53.360]  Let's go to Dr. Stan Monteef. He's led a delegation of physicians from Santa Cruz County to the
[2:13:53.360 --> 2:13:57.680]  House of Delegates of California Medical Association for 10 years. He's led the battle with an organized
[2:13:57.680 --> 2:14:02.720]  medicine in California address AIDS epidemic. This is an old bio and was, he's just talk show host
[2:14:02.720 --> 2:14:08.400]  on Genesis written a bunch of bestselling books, made videos, made films. He's a medical doctor,
[2:14:08.400 --> 2:14:13.120]  been doing this for over 40 years, fighting the new world order, an expert on the eugenics,
[2:14:13.120 --> 2:14:18.000]  an expert on AIDS being engineered, and an expert on what's happening with this flu.
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:22.640]  For the balance of the hour, Dr. Stan Monteef joins us. Doctor, it's good to have you on with us.
[2:14:22.640 --> 2:14:27.040]  It's great to be with you, Alex. And this is an exciting time because, you know,
[2:14:27.040 --> 2:14:31.520]  I'm getting all sorts of emails from people in the healthcare industry who are saying,
[2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:36.000]  look, they're threatening to take away my job. They're threatening to take away my,
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:41.360]  my pension. If I won't take this vaccine and I say do not take it, just tell them you're going to
[2:14:41.360 --> 2:14:52.000]  sue them, get the other people. Dr. Monteef. All right. We just lost his phone line. Yes,
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:55.920]  they've denied the last month that they're ordering people to take shots and it's forced.
[2:14:55.920 --> 2:15:00.240]  Now they're having to admit it slowly, but again, they deny it to the last minute
[2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:05.680]  so we can't build opposition. If an army is about to attack you, they want to sneak up.
[2:15:06.240 --> 2:15:13.520]  They don't want you to know they're coming. And this is what they're doing. And while we're
[2:15:13.520 --> 2:15:21.120]  getting Dr. Monteef back on the line, MAAC organizes Pittsburgh security for G20. It says,
[2:15:21.120 --> 2:15:27.280]  the FBI and Secret Service are running it along with the army. Now we saw this in 99 in Seattle.
[2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:31.280]  When I knew the army was running this two weeks before, I said they're going to stage riots.
[2:15:31.280 --> 2:15:36.320]  And then it came out, the police had to admit later, 50 anarchists were flown in funded by a
[2:15:36.320 --> 2:15:42.720]  big foundation. This is all in my film, police state to the takeover. We released in 2000.
[2:15:44.160 --> 2:15:47.600]  You want to see the documentation and they flew them in.
[2:15:47.600 --> 2:15:54.800]  And they had them attack police before the news cameras to then set the pretext to attack everybody.
[2:15:55.920 --> 2:15:59.600]  Delta Force ran that as well. That was in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer,
[2:15:59.600 --> 2:16:03.200]  Seattle Times. It was in all three of the papers in Seattle,
[2:16:04.320 --> 2:16:09.600]  Seattle Times Post-Intelligencer and the other one. That's all in police state two,
[2:16:10.960 --> 2:16:15.440]  the takeover. This is the takeover and they know incremental is hard to beat.
[2:16:15.440 --> 2:16:20.400]  It's like a frog in cold water. He won't jump out. He turned it up slowly,
[2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:24.880]  he'll boil to death. You throw him in hot water, he'll jump out. That old analogy.
[2:16:24.880 --> 2:16:28.720]  And the troops are brainwashed, the police are brainwashed, the public's brainwashed.
[2:16:29.280 --> 2:16:34.080]  And I told you over a decade ago, the big takeover would come when they fully bankrupted
[2:16:34.080 --> 2:16:38.720]  the economy. Dr. Monteef, we lost you there and your phone's real low. Can you speak up?
[2:16:38.720 --> 2:16:42.800]  Okay. How was that? Good start over. You're saying an exciting time to be alive.
[2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:48.800]  Well, it certainly is. But really, with this whole thing on this wine flume,
[2:16:48.800 --> 2:16:53.840]  everybody, most people have missed this article that appeared in the New York Times
[2:16:54.560 --> 2:17:00.720]  on the 12th of September and they quote a number of leading epidemiologists who have said that
[2:17:02.240 --> 2:17:07.200]  they got a great vaccine, but the problem is the epidemic's going to be over. It's kind of
[2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:14.240]  peaked out before the vaccine's available in the middle of next month. And that really is true.
[2:17:14.240 --> 2:17:19.440]  In fact, I emailed or just talked to Mr. Hartman and hopefully you'll have those
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:26.640]  figures off the CDC webpage. You can see that it's already peaked at its highest level. They call
[2:17:26.640 --> 2:17:34.560]  it widespread level five in almost 20 states as of about two weeks ago. It's already peaked
[2:17:34.560 --> 2:17:41.600]  and declining the incidence of the new infections in California. This disease is so mild that most
[2:17:41.600 --> 2:17:47.440]  people who get it don't even know they've been ill. And what they've done is debate and switch
[2:17:47.440 --> 2:17:54.880]  on the vaccine. The article that they utilized to demonstrate that the vaccine was effective
[2:17:54.880 --> 2:17:58.800]  was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on the 10th of September. It's called
[2:17:58.800 --> 2:18:08.080]  a trial of influenza A-H1N1-2009 mild-ovalent, monovalent adjuvanted vaccine. In other words,
[2:18:08.080 --> 2:18:15.120]  they used an adjuvanted vaccine in Australia to prove that the vaccine works, but they're not
[2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:20.160]  going to give an adjuvanted vaccine in the United States at least. They're afraid to because they
[2:18:20.160 --> 2:18:26.560]  know there's so much opposition to it, because it's not licensed in the United States. So they
[2:18:26.560 --> 2:18:31.600]  used one vaccine and said, gee, look how great it works. And then first they're going to use the
[2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:35.840]  different vaccine in the United States. Well, doctor, I want to walk through all this with you,
[2:18:35.840 --> 2:18:41.360]  but also from your years of researching this eugenics order of darkness, Brotherhood of Darkness,
[2:18:41.360 --> 2:18:45.920]  as your book title states it, what do you think the master plan here is? Is this just a giant
[2:18:45.920 --> 2:18:53.200]  drill for federalization and nation states to go under UN level six control or could this be
[2:18:53.200 --> 2:18:59.120]  something better? It may be a trial. It may be an effort to make $40 billion for the pharmaceutical
[2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:03.840]  industry. I certainly they're going to do tremendous damage to our allied technical
[2:19:03.840 --> 2:19:10.960]  department population, because the CDC is mandating that this vaccine or at least
[2:19:10.960 --> 2:19:16.480]  I suggesting the vaccine be given to every pregnant woman. Whereas if you read the material
[2:19:16.480 --> 2:19:20.240]  from the manufacturers of the vaccine here in the United States and throughout the world,
[2:19:20.240 --> 2:19:26.560]  they say don't give it to pregnant women. The CDC is saying it ought to be given to all children
[2:19:26.560 --> 2:19:31.440]  starting at two years of age. The manufacturers are saying don't give it to children less than four
[2:19:31.440 --> 2:19:36.240]  years of age. They get into all sorts of problems with it. And they don't want to give us one shot
[2:19:36.240 --> 2:19:43.120]  of the vaccine. They want to give two shots of the swine flu vaccine and two shots of the influenza
[2:19:43.120 --> 2:19:48.400]  vaccine. So that's the seasonal regulator. Well, stay there. You're a medical doctor and expert on
[2:19:48.400 --> 2:19:54.320]  eugenics. I want to get into their larger master plan as well and take phone calls. Dr. Stan Monteef

[2:21:57.120 --> 2:22:15.520]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[2:22:15.520 --> 2:22:28.800]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[2:22:28.800 --> 2:22:38.240]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[2:23:00.240 --> 2:23:18.400]  You worry. You see the signs and worry about the future. You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages. How to be prepared while preserving your sanity? Your answer may be at hand. Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization. She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[2:23:18.400 --> 2:23:30.160]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants. The cost of learning is minimal. Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere. It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[2:23:30.160 --> 2:23:43.920]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality and joy. Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use and store it.

[2:24:00.800 --> 2:24:24.800]  Medical doctor, Dr. Stan Montief, joins us for the rest of the hour. We're going to take some of your phone calls on the swine flu, your questions, your comments. When we open the phones up, doctor, unlimited amounts, as many as we can take, nurses and husbands and wives of nurses being ordered to take another fired, nurses who've been fired.
[2:24:24.800 --> 2:24:38.800]  We're going to have a lady on the day, but she kind of chickened out and I don't blame her. But we have the letters where they're being threatened. It's in the news, they're now being fired. But there's not even a law. They're using regulations and Obama's lying, saying they're not trying to make this mandatory.
[2:24:38.800 --> 2:25:00.800]  Open discussions on CNN and Fox about using the military to forcibly inoculate us. But you gave us the CDC's Center for Disease Control map. We'll put that up on screen. They admit it's supposed to peak middle of next month. It's basically already peaked. It doesn't even go up much. This is a very mild flu, as you said. So why do they want us to take this vaccine so bad?
[2:25:00.800 --> 2:25:19.800]  Because it contains mercury and mercury is toxic, it destroys the fertility, it destroys the mind, destroys the endocrine system. There is no safe dose of mercury, yet they're going to give it. They want everybody to take a swine flu shot with a full dose of mercury.
[2:25:19.800 --> 2:25:36.800]  A regular flu shot with the regular dose of mercury. They want every pregnant woman to take these shots. They want to give two shots of swine flu and two shots of the regular influenza vaccine to every child less than 10 years of age.
[2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:41.800]  Is this not precedent setting where they're ordering medical workers to take the standard flu shot?
[2:25:41.800 --> 2:25:53.800]  It absolutely is. I don't know about the standard flu shot. They've always recommended that. I've got the letters from major hospital chains. They are firing people that don't take it.
[2:25:53.800 --> 2:26:11.800]  Well, basically, of course, this is going to produce terrible damage, first of all, because it does contain the mercury. A lot of people never have gotten the flu until they take a flu shot. They've been recommending for years that medical personnel take the seasonal flu.
[2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:25.800]  That's not the eighth one and one. It's the seasonal, and most people won't take it because they know it makes them sick and it doesn't do any good. The vast majority of doctors in this country do not believe in influenza.
[2:26:25.800 --> 2:26:38.800]  And that's in national polls, and everybody mouth to mouth person to person knows that I took the flu shot and almost died. I mean, my mother, that happened to her. Everybody I know has their horrible flu shot story.
[2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:55.800]  And of course, this promotes guinea farré disease. It produces all sorts of medical problems, and they said they've been trying to sell it to the American people, and yet so many people have been crippled or have permanent damage to their immunity.
[2:26:55.800 --> 2:27:12.800]  I don't understand that the whole idea of vaccines is to stimulate the immune system. And this is one reason why we have so much autoimmune disease in America. We're talking about rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, shortness disease, certain types of thyroiditis, chronic bowel symptoms.
[2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:15.800]  It's because they've overstimulated the immune.
[2:27:15.800 --> 2:27:30.800]  Exima? Absolutely. And then of course, what we have to understand, we could start with simply an alphabetical approach to this. A, that you get asthma, and you get allergies, and you get autoimmune disease.
[2:27:30.800 --> 2:27:45.800]  You realize that in the United States today, one in nine children has asthma. You don't see this in the Amas children because they aren't required to take the vaccines or they just refuse to take the vaccines.
[2:27:45.800 --> 2:27:57.800]  There's been an explosion of autoimmune disease. There's an explosion of exima in the asthma, as you point out. And then of course, the mercury in the vaccine attacks the brain.
[2:27:57.800 --> 2:28:13.800]  This is why today in the United States, one in six children, according to the CDC, their own figures, one in six children has either a learning disability or a neurodevelopmental abnormality.
[2:28:13.800 --> 2:28:22.800]  One in six American children. You don't see this in children who don't take the vaccines. They're destroying the minds and lives of our children.
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:32.800]  Which is what the top eugenicists like H.C. Wells and Bertrand Russell and John P. Holdren said they would do.
[2:28:32.800 --> 2:28:42.800]  Absolutely. In fact, if you read, and we have the book, people can get it, it's called The Impact of Science on Society, written by Bertrand Russell.
[2:28:42.800 --> 2:28:57.800]  And he comments there by diet, injections, and injunctions. We will alter the mind of the child that they will not be able to differ from the things that they were taught by the schoolmaster.
[2:28:57.800 --> 2:29:06.800]  By diet, injections, and injunctions. What are they going to put in the diet? Why do they put aspartame in the diet?
[2:29:06.800 --> 2:29:18.800]  It has the impact on the mind, but we could talk for hours on that because it's cancer. But then they put, of course, the mercury that they're giving our kids and the injection.
[2:29:18.800 --> 2:29:30.800]  They know that this destroys the mind. You realize that today in America, we have five million people with dementia and Alzheimer's disease in all of China with four times our population.
[2:29:30.800 --> 2:29:33.800]  They've only got a little over five and a half million people.
[2:29:33.800 --> 2:29:41.800]  And it gets worse than that. Stay there, Dr. Long's segment coming up. It gets worse than that. Our diabetes level, everything.
[2:29:41.800 --> 2:30:07.800]  We're going to talk about that with medical doctor Dr. Stan Monteef on the other side. Stay with us.
[2:30:07.800 --> 2:30:16.800]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois. These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[2:30:16.800 --> 2:30:26.800]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free. It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[2:30:26.800 --> 2:30:37.800]  It runs some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling. Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:30:37.800 --> 2:30:47.800]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready. With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[2:30:47.800 --> 2:31:00.800]  That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365. Don't wait. Call today.
[2:31:17.800 --> 2:31:27.800]  Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times. This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class. It doesn't matter.
[2:31:27.800 --> 2:31:36.800]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well. You know the government isn't looking out for you. You need to look out for yourself.
[2:31:36.800 --> 2:31:50.800]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse. You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones. Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today. Again, it is here's what you do.net.
[2:31:50.800 --> 2:31:59.800]  That's here's what you do.net. One last time. It's here's what you do.net.
[2:31:59.800 --> 2:32:09.800]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[2:32:09.800 --> 2:32:22.800]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S. and Canada. At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[2:32:22.800 --> 2:32:34.800]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten. Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients. This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to 5 years when vacuum packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storeable food.
[2:32:34.800 --> 2:32:45.800]  Hempusa.org is a bulk shipper starting with 5 pounds and up. To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org and order today.
[2:32:45.800 --> 2:33:00.800]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition. This superfood will be your greatest asset, so try it today, store it today, and change your life. Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[2:33:00.800 --> 2:33:16.800]  Is it getting better?
[2:33:16.800 --> 2:33:22.800]  Or do you feel the same?
[2:33:22.800 --> 2:33:35.800]  Will it make it easier on your mouth? You've got someone to blame. You said one love, one life.
[2:33:35.800 --> 2:33:43.800]  Mike, Chris, Susan, Dan, Mark. Dan's calling from the Philippines. Really, you're calling from Dr. Monteef here in a few minutes. We're gonna have him back up.
[2:33:43.800 --> 2:33:59.800]  Next week, if you can do it, to get more into eugenics with us. Doctor, separately from the whole flu situation. You mentioned Alzheimer's. They now have this early onset of it when you're 35, 40 years old.
[2:33:59.800 --> 2:34:07.800]  You mentioned that we have more brain disorders than people in China and more Alzheimer's. I mean, they're killing us. We know it's designed. They stated they would do it.
[2:34:07.800 --> 2:34:20.800]  They write giant textbooks on it, like EcoScience bragging about it. And how do we defeat this? They control the main churches. They control the corporations.
[2:34:20.800 --> 2:34:29.800]  They don't just want a world government. That's the means to the end, as John P. Holder in White House Science R says, as he states, a planetary government, a planetary regime.
[2:34:29.800 --> 2:34:43.800]  Dr. Pianca says it. Peter Singer says it. They all say it. Erlich says it. George Bush Senior's advisor that they're going to have a world government to carry out our orderly extermination, testing soft kill weapons as we die.
[2:34:43.800 --> 2:34:51.800]  They train as it's normal. They pose as the saviors. They have marches and marathons to fund research, which is actually funding how to kill us.
[2:34:51.800 --> 2:35:02.800]  You're a medical doctor who discovered this decades ago. It appears all the evidence shows they're expanding their eugenics operations to more of a hot kill, fast kill now.
[2:35:02.800 --> 2:35:09.800]  And the Reuters has got a big article out saying, oh, there'll be millions of deaths this year. People will think they take the shot and die.
[2:35:09.800 --> 2:35:18.800]  But no, there'll be no adverse reactions. It's impossible. They're telling doctors if someone dies after they take it or becomes paralyzed, the shot didn't do it.
[2:35:18.800 --> 2:35:28.800]  It appears they're preemptively studying how to roll this out successfully, just like Gardasil and Kill and Mamus and sterilize us and then get away with it.
[2:35:28.800 --> 2:35:37.800]  Well, I think that probably the vaccine that they're going to give in Europe will be more dangerous than the one that they're going to give here.
[2:35:37.800 --> 2:35:48.800]  Because the one they're going to use in Europe is a squalene one that's a license to give to people over 65. They're going to give it to the whole population.
[2:35:48.800 --> 2:35:54.800]  And that, of course, is an article in global research, which is usually very, very, very, very reliable.
[2:35:54.800 --> 2:36:01.800]  And they're talking about the nanoparticles that they put in there to so-called turbo charge the European vaccine.
[2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:07.800]  I just hope and pray that they haven't stuck it into our vaccine, because you can't trust them.
[2:36:07.800 --> 2:36:18.800]  Well, we've had medical workers at the vaccine companies call in, and I've seen reports that, no, there's different versions, but no, they have the Indra-Lukin or whatever it's called.
[2:36:18.800 --> 2:36:23.800]  Dr. Horowitz on yesterday, they're saying that it is in the vaccines, or at least some of them.
[2:36:23.800 --> 2:36:33.800]  It may very well be. See, we can't trust them, because they've put things into the vaccines in the past, or have they, let's say, well, we didn't know it was there.
[2:36:33.800 --> 2:36:38.800]  Well, they can say that, but when they did know it was there, they continued to distribute it.
[2:36:38.800 --> 2:36:43.800]  And I'm talking about specifically the polio vaccine, the original polio vaccine.
[2:36:43.800 --> 2:36:48.800]  And when they found out it had a cancer virus in it, they continued disseminating it.
[2:36:48.800 --> 2:36:57.800]  And they've contaminated the whole population of the world, about 30% of our population today, still carries that cancer vaccine.
[2:36:57.800 --> 2:37:01.800]  That's cancer virus that was in the original polio vaccine.
[2:37:01.800 --> 2:37:12.800]  One reason why the incidence of bone cancer and brain cancer, and lymphoma, and mesothelioma, and pentamoma, and medullaplastoma in children has gone up.
[2:37:12.800 --> 2:37:23.800]  And when they actually, when they perhaps see them, they find evidence of this cancer-producing virus that was introduced into our population, the original polio vaccine.
[2:37:23.800 --> 2:37:33.800]  And no doubt, by design, in German news is reporting that they're growing it again in the same monkeys that have the SV40 for the virus stock in the European vaccines.
[2:37:33.800 --> 2:37:39.800]  Well, I've got help those people over there, supposedly. And all we know is what they tell us, Alex.
[2:37:39.800 --> 2:37:45.800]  Supposedly, the American vaccine is going to be grown in the yolk of eggs.
[2:37:45.800 --> 2:37:50.800]  But then we get the chicken viruses. That's the pricing thing about this.
[2:37:50.800 --> 2:37:59.800]  And they've introduced so many viruses from so many animals, God gave us an immune system that allows us to fight off animal viruses.
[2:37:59.800 --> 2:38:03.800]  They can't get to our bodies unless you inject them with a needle.
[2:38:03.800 --> 2:38:12.800]  Well, what about how for five years the FDA approved it's now in wide use? Not just a radiation of the meat, but they're now spraying in Latin.
[2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:24.800]  I can't pronounce it. That means bacteria-eating virus. They grow it in giant vaccine tanks with other viruses and RNA and are now spraying it on most meats we get at the store.
[2:38:24.800 --> 2:38:32.800]  Well, I'm very concerned that so much of what they're doing to our food supply, it will lead to terrible problems.
[2:38:32.800 --> 2:38:44.800]  Certainly, we know that the genetically modified corn that they have introduced across America, and of course, it is contaminating our entire corn supply here.
[2:38:44.800 --> 2:38:52.800]  Chickens are a lot smarter than people. Chickens both eat it. We know that it actually causes infertility in pigs.
[2:38:52.800 --> 2:39:03.800]  We know that studies have been done in Russia that shows it causes the genetically modified corn to actually create infertility in animals in Russia.
[2:39:03.800 --> 2:39:11.800]  And the people who wanted to get the information out were told you can't disseminate the information. It's all about population control.
[2:39:11.800 --> 2:39:33.800]  We know that the Rockefeller Foundation, that Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation at Monsanto, and a similar very large genetic modification company over in Switzerland, are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to store seeds in fast falls up above the Arctic Circle on a little island there.
[2:39:33.800 --> 2:39:42.800]  And nobody's asked, why are they storing all these seeds for corn and for wheat and for all the other vegetables and things?
[2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:51.800]  You know, in these falls where they'll be permanently frozen and should be very obvious, all of these people are dedicated to population control.
[2:39:51.800 --> 2:39:56.800]  And they want the seeds for when they start fall over again.
[2:39:56.800 --> 2:40:08.800]  And they've stated this. In fact, the MI-6 officer, he was OSS who wrote the James Bond novels that were made into movies, he wrote Moonraker.
[2:40:08.800 --> 2:40:18.800]  And in that, the global elite and this head banker want to kill everybody on Earth. They, the eugenics pure, go to a space station.
[2:40:18.800 --> 2:40:27.800]  While they kill everybody on Earth, they're going to come back. But in the real government documents, they're not going to space. They've got the underground bases. And I saw a Reuters article two weeks ago.
[2:40:27.800 --> 2:40:29.800]  In fact, we can pull that up.
[2:40:29.800 --> 2:40:53.800]  They're putting in the police state grid to then carry out the medical mayhem and murder. And I want the troops in military to know something.
[2:40:53.800 --> 2:40:59.800]  I know this is probably going to go ahead and go to fruition. Just know you're going to be judged at your own hand.
[2:40:59.800 --> 2:41:05.800]  The masters you've served for are going to murder you and your family as well. Go ahead and laugh.
[2:41:05.800 --> 2:41:12.800]  Just remember, as you're dying with your family years from now, you asked for it. You were warned. You wanted to be part of it.
[2:41:12.800 --> 2:41:24.800]  Dr. Montes, men and women become accomplices to the evil they fail to oppose. And the people within the military who are carrying out the orders of our leaders who have killed.
[2:41:24.800 --> 2:41:30.800]  I don't know if you've read the article by the shoe drawer or the man, of course, who was through the shoes of George Bush.
[2:41:30.800 --> 2:41:42.800]  He talked about the million Iraqis who were killed. He talked about the million widows there. He talked about the five million orphans in Iraq today.
[2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:48.800]  He talked about the suffering there of the people, how they've turned the Arabs against one another.
[2:41:48.800 --> 2:42:00.800]  One time, the Tunisians, the Shias, the Christians got along well together. But since the Americans came in, the Christians have been driven out. And of course, everybody is everybody else's throat.
[2:42:00.800 --> 2:42:07.800]  And we are sending in Asian provocateurs to commit acts of terrorism to maintain this division.
[2:42:07.800 --> 2:42:15.800]  But this is all because the American people haven't had the courage to stand up. Oh, they voted for Barack Obama.
[2:42:15.800 --> 2:42:21.800]  He's, of course, expanding the war in Afghanistan today because he is a servant of the elite.
[2:42:21.800 --> 2:42:25.800]  And we're talking about the trial of a commission that you do as well.
[2:42:25.800 --> 2:42:37.800]  The Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderbergers, is a financial elite led by David Rockefeller, who has a different worldview because he worships the different God.
[2:42:37.800 --> 2:42:47.800]  And until people understand that there is a powerful spiritual force, a very important force behind everything going on today, and they really hate humanity.
[2:42:47.800 --> 2:42:51.800]  And that's why they're storing the seeds so they will have them there.
[2:42:51.800 --> 2:42:58.800]  There are videos of Maurice Strong, as you know, saying we're going to destroy the entire industrial base through the world government.
[2:42:58.800 --> 2:42:59.800]  I mean, they're doing it now.
[2:42:59.800 --> 2:43:09.800]  I remember when I was first on your show back in 99 when I was out there covering Operation Urban Warrior in Oakland with the Marines trying to confiscate our guns on video.
[2:43:09.800 --> 2:43:13.800]  Look how much has happened now. Everywhere they've got troops on the streets.
[2:43:13.800 --> 2:43:18.800]  I mean, the reports, it's just intensifying incrementally.
[2:43:18.800 --> 2:43:25.800]  Well, so they put on the other hand, you know, more and more Americans are committed to know what's going on.
[2:43:25.800 --> 2:43:30.800]  I think that the other side is frightening. I think they're going to start moving very, very rapidly.
[2:43:30.800 --> 2:43:40.800]  I think that this march that we had in Washington, D.C., I think was the 12th of September, and it's probably between a million and a million and a half people were there.
[2:43:40.800 --> 2:43:45.800]  I think that this really has been disturbed because this was an amazing thing.
[2:43:45.800 --> 2:43:55.800]  In fact, there have been a lot more people there if they hadn't turned back the buses on the cars and people trying to come and join in that demonstration.
[2:43:55.800 --> 2:44:00.800]  You are waking up an awful lot of people, you and a few of the others.
[2:44:00.800 --> 2:44:04.800]  Yeah, but the problem is they then put the operative Glenn Beck in there to lead them.
[2:44:04.800 --> 2:44:08.800]  We wake the people up and then we turn them over to Glenn Beck.
[2:44:08.800 --> 2:44:17.800]  Well, he's as funny as a three-dollar bill. Everybody has to understand that Glenn Beck would not be on national television if he was telling the truth.
[2:44:17.800 --> 2:44:25.800]  So basically, he's going to say some things that are absolutely right, you agree with, but that's the old fates with technique.
[2:44:25.800 --> 2:44:32.800]  He gets in there, he gets your confidence, and then he gives you a lot of information that is frankly not true.
[2:44:32.800 --> 2:44:38.800]  That's why I think people look to you for leadership, they look to you for reliable information.
[2:44:38.800 --> 2:44:45.800]  I appreciate so much you're getting that information out and you must be ruffling a lot of feathers because you're getting so much opposition.
[2:44:45.800 --> 2:44:48.800]  People are saying you have to get that guy off the air.
[2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:51.800]  They say that locally here in Santa Cruz.
[2:44:51.800 --> 2:44:56.800]  Hopefully our station manager is going to have the courage to keep you off.
[2:44:56.800 --> 2:45:08.800]  So the people are beginning to wake up. I've been at this for 47 years and we are seeing more people upset now, especially when they're threatening our health care workers being fired.
[2:45:08.800 --> 2:45:16.800]  And let me say that the health care workers who are there just tell them that you fire me and I'm going to sue you and I will tell any of them.
[2:45:16.800 --> 2:45:29.800]  I'll come back and testify to you. First of all, you do not need to take the shot because by the time they have the vaccine for the H1N1 influenza virus, why the epidemic is going to be just about over.
[2:45:29.800 --> 2:45:37.800]  It's already peaking out as we speak today, but they've got 195 million doses of the vaccine.
[2:45:37.800 --> 2:45:40.800]  What are they going to do with it? They've got to give it to the people.
[2:45:40.800 --> 2:45:51.800]  They've got to double off on the amount of mercury they're going to give to our children. Every child less than 10 years of age, they want to give them not one, but two swine flu shots.
[2:45:51.800 --> 2:45:58.800]  Doctor, absolutely. And the key point you make here from the CDC's own website is it's now going to be peaking in the next couple of weeks.
[2:45:58.800 --> 2:46:01.800]  Why then for something incredibly mild are they doing this?
[2:46:01.800 --> 2:46:05.800]  They're just fear mongering this event to be able to expand their control.
[2:46:05.800 --> 2:46:10.800]  Going back to radio stations, plug the local station I'm on.
[2:46:10.800 --> 2:46:18.800]  It came with KOMY here in the Monterey Bay area and they're doing a great job of getting your information out.
[2:46:18.800 --> 2:46:24.800]  But very, very few people object to it. Most people really appreciate what you're saying.
[2:46:24.800 --> 2:46:29.800]  Well, I know that MZ, the owner of those stations, has had me on two different ones.
[2:46:29.800 --> 2:46:36.800]  And I know it's been very popular, but he has said there are people viciously, a minority saying get me off.
[2:46:36.800 --> 2:46:39.800]  I want to explain something to those people.
[2:46:39.800 --> 2:46:48.800]  Ten years ago, or about nine years ago, I was offered a national radio slot. I was told I would be the next Glenn Beck.
[2:46:48.800 --> 2:46:54.800]  Glenn Beck wasn't on the scene yet. They said we need a young Rush Limbaugh, no more New World Order, no more fellow reserve.
[2:46:54.800 --> 2:47:02.800]  You reach out and grab people on the radio. But of course, as a journalist, they say this is a private meeting.
[2:47:02.800 --> 2:47:05.800]  You're not going to discuss this non-disclosure, but this is the offer.
[2:47:05.800 --> 2:47:08.800]  And then I had some other offers along the road.
[2:47:08.800 --> 2:47:16.800]  And if I wanted to be on 500, 600 radio stations and be making $50 million a year like Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh, I could have done it.
[2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:21.800]  The money means nothing. When you know they're putting cancer viruses in vaccines,
[2:47:21.800 --> 2:47:27.800]  when you know they've designed the plastics to leach estrogen mimickers on record.
[2:47:27.800 --> 2:47:29.800]  That's BBC today to sterilize you.
[2:47:29.800 --> 2:47:37.800]  When you know you have no future, why would I take $50 million and go live in a mansion and sit there in line of people all day?
[2:47:37.800 --> 2:47:40.800]  The truth is what matters. We have no future.
[2:47:40.800 --> 2:47:42.800]  This is a cold-blooded killing machine.
[2:47:42.800 --> 2:47:48.800]  This isn't just some boss hog offering me $50 million to hang out with him in Roscoe Pico train.
[2:47:48.800 --> 2:47:53.800]  There's no survival. This is making a deal with the devil.
[2:47:53.800 --> 2:48:01.800]  Dale Rundis, a friend of mine, Dr. Monteef, always gives the analogy of, for selling out,
[2:48:01.800 --> 2:48:05.800]  if I offered you $1,000 for your eyes, would you take it, Dr. Monteef?
[2:48:05.800 --> 2:48:08.800]  Absolutely not.
[2:48:08.800 --> 2:48:11.800]  What have I offered you? What have I offered you a million?
[2:48:11.800 --> 2:48:13.800]  Or a billion?
[2:48:13.800 --> 2:48:17.800]  Nothing, because freedom is the most important thing we have.
[2:48:17.800 --> 2:48:19.800]  Your eyes, exactly.
[2:48:19.800 --> 2:48:23.800]  To finish the statement, your eyes are just a window to the soul.
[2:48:23.800 --> 2:48:26.800]  How much money would I take for my soul?
[2:48:26.800 --> 2:48:29.800]  Folks, you don't hurt me when you get me taken off the air.
[2:48:29.800 --> 2:48:31.800]  You hurt yourselves.
[2:48:31.800 --> 2:48:33.800]  I've told you the truth.
[2:48:33.800 --> 2:48:41.800]  It hurts me at a level of wanting to reach new people to warn them for all those women listening who can go Google Gardasil deaths
[2:48:41.800 --> 2:48:45.800]  and find out how many people it's killing so they don't kill their daughter or maim them.
[2:48:45.800 --> 2:48:52.800]  So when you try to take me off the air, it is on you murdering those young girls.
[2:48:52.800 --> 2:48:56.800]  And if you want that on your soul, my God, just be forewarned.
[2:48:56.800 --> 2:49:00.800]  So I want to make that clear that there's nothing I'd like better, Dr. Monteef,
[2:49:00.800 --> 2:49:02.800]  than to quit this show and stop doing this.
[2:49:02.800 --> 2:49:04.800]  This is a burden.
[2:49:04.800 --> 2:49:08.800]  And so people who think they get me by attacking me or lying about me or doing that,
[2:49:08.800 --> 2:49:12.800]  and they attack the station owners that have courage to put me on,
[2:49:12.800 --> 2:49:15.800]  you folks don't even know where I'm coming from.
[2:49:15.800 --> 2:49:16.800]  And so I just feel sorry for you.
[2:49:16.800 --> 2:49:18.800]  Dr. Monteef, go ahead.
[2:49:18.800 --> 2:49:19.800]  Well, hi, Meyer.
[2:49:19.800 --> 2:49:20.800]  What did you do, Alex?
[2:49:20.800 --> 2:49:21.800]  You do it so well.
[2:49:21.800 --> 2:49:23.800]  You do it better than anybody else.
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:26.800]  I don't because you speak with this intensity.
[2:49:26.800 --> 2:49:34.800]  People have to understand, as Alex said, first of all, the H1N1 infection swine flu is a very mild disease.
[2:49:34.800 --> 2:49:43.800]  In the initial study that they did over in Australia where they actually, this is the study published
[2:49:43.800 --> 2:49:46.800]  in New England Journal of Medicine on the 10th of September.
[2:49:46.800 --> 2:49:53.800]  And this is the vaccine trial that they're using to justify using the vaccine of the United States.
[2:49:53.800 --> 2:49:57.800]  They've tested an entirely different vaccine in Australia.
[2:49:57.800 --> 2:50:05.800]  The one that had the adjuvant in it, the excreted adjuvant, but what was really so interesting about the study,
[2:50:05.800 --> 2:50:10.800]  although they didn't play it up, was that they got all these people recruited.
[2:50:10.800 --> 2:50:13.800]  They wanted to get these studies done as quickly as they could.
[2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:18.800]  So they tested all of them ahead of time to see if they had antibodies to the infection,
[2:50:18.800 --> 2:50:20.800]  to the swine flu infection.
[2:50:20.800 --> 2:50:25.800]  Because first they wanted, you know, they figured probably one or two of them would have.
[2:50:25.800 --> 2:50:33.800]  They found that 14% of one group already been infected and 39% of another group had already been infected.
[2:50:33.800 --> 2:50:36.800]  In other words, they were already immune to the disease.
[2:50:36.800 --> 2:50:47.800]  And all they could accomplish by giving them, you know, the vaccine was going through most of their immunity to the disease.
[2:50:47.800 --> 2:50:53.800]  They were already immune to most of the people in the United States have had this disease already,
[2:50:53.800 --> 2:50:58.800]  but they can't put the building of 195, maybe those, the vaccine.
[2:50:58.800 --> 2:51:00.800]  Stay there, got a break.
[2:51:00.800 --> 2:51:04.800]  When looking at your personal preparedness level, remember the freeze-dry guy.
[2:51:04.800 --> 2:51:08.800]  During times of physical and emotional stress, like the uncertain times we live in today,
[2:51:08.800 --> 2:51:11.800]  it is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[2:51:11.800 --> 2:51:16.800]  You should only store what you usually eat, because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[2:51:16.800 --> 2:51:18.800]  Lucky for you, there's the freeze-dry guy.
[2:51:18.800 --> 2:51:25.800]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the freeze-dry guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[2:51:25.800 --> 2:51:30.800]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[2:51:30.800 --> 2:51:34.800]  The freeze-dry guy has been serving various government agencies, as well as the private sector,
[2:51:34.800 --> 2:51:39.800]  with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[2:51:39.800 --> 2:51:46.800]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch-car days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[2:51:46.800 --> 2:51:51.800]  Comparably, the advances made in food storage from the World War II era till now are equally great.

[2:52:22.800 --> 2:52:31.800]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:52:31.800 --> 2:53:00.800]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:53:01.800 --> 2:53:05.800]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health
[2:53:05.800 --> 2:53:10.800]  is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[2:53:10.800 --> 2:53:15.800]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance,

[2:54:00.800 --> 2:54:15.800]  We're going to talk to Mike and Mass Chris in Maryland, Dan in the Philippines.
[2:54:15.800 --> 2:54:17.800]  We'll go to Dan here in just a moment for the next two segments,
[2:54:17.800 --> 2:54:21.800]  and I'm going to get into a host of other issues in the next hour.
[2:54:21.800 --> 2:54:25.800]  Well, Dr. Monteef keeps trying to point out here while I'm interrupting,
[2:54:25.800 --> 2:54:28.800]  is just so many facets that are popping into my mind here,
[2:54:28.800 --> 2:54:30.800]  is what I've already read in the mainstream news.
[2:54:30.800 --> 2:54:38.800]  It's admitted that upwards of 30% of people where they test for the antibodies already have it in many nations.
[2:54:38.800 --> 2:54:39.800]  It's very mild.
[2:54:39.800 --> 2:54:41.800]  So what is this all about?
[2:54:41.800 --> 2:54:42.800]  Well, they want to have a scare.
[2:54:42.800 --> 2:54:44.800]  They have to monger for months.
[2:54:44.800 --> 2:54:47.800]  And so clearly this is a way to just sell vaccines,
[2:54:47.800 --> 2:54:49.800]  set the precedent to make people take them,
[2:54:49.800 --> 2:54:53.800]  and get everybody into this medicalized tyranny.
[2:54:53.800 --> 2:54:54.800]  Dr. Monteef.
[2:54:54.800 --> 2:54:58.800]  Well, I've never seen in all those 40, 70 eyes I've had at this
[2:54:58.800 --> 2:55:04.800]  such a dramatic, coordinated campaign of every means of communication
[2:55:04.800 --> 2:55:08.800]  to convince us we've got to take this H1N1 vaccine.
[2:55:08.800 --> 2:55:11.800]  So obviously for anybody out there that's listening to this,
[2:55:11.800 --> 2:55:13.800]  you can realize the control they have.
[2:55:13.800 --> 2:55:18.800]  They control literally almost every major media outlet in the United States.
[2:55:18.800 --> 2:55:20.800]  I mean, why would they be talking about this?
[2:55:20.800 --> 2:55:23.800]  This is such a mild disease that, as Alex says,
[2:55:23.800 --> 2:55:27.800]  most people don't even know they've had the disease in the study,
[2:55:27.800 --> 2:55:30.800]  which would they use to justify giving the vaccine.
[2:55:30.800 --> 2:55:34.800]  In one group, 39% didn't even know that had the illness,
[2:55:34.800 --> 2:55:38.800]  and yet they already had antibodies to it, were immune to it,
[2:55:38.800 --> 2:55:41.800]  and certainly by the time they get around to giving the vaccine,
[2:55:41.800 --> 2:55:44.800]  the majority of people will have had the illness,
[2:55:44.800 --> 2:55:46.800]  and it's not going to be a problem.
[2:55:46.800 --> 2:55:49.800]  So obviously there's another agenda.
[2:55:49.800 --> 2:55:53.800]  It's a giant hoax, and that other agenda is clearly eugenics,
[2:55:53.800 --> 2:55:57.800]  and you have the internal CDC report admitting it's going to cause
[2:55:57.800 --> 2:56:02.800]  and has caused in the past similar vaccines, neurological disorders.
[2:56:02.800 --> 2:56:04.800]  Let's talk to Dan in the Philippines.
[2:56:04.800 --> 2:56:07.800]  You're on the air with Dr. Stan Monteef. Go ahead.
[2:56:07.800 --> 2:56:09.800]  Hello, hello.
[2:56:09.800 --> 2:56:11.800]  Yes, go ahead.
[2:56:11.800 --> 2:56:16.800]  Yeah, yeah, hello. I just wanted to call the audience to know
[2:56:16.800 --> 2:56:18.800]  about a new, they're not new.
[2:56:18.800 --> 2:56:21.800]  It's a tool on the Internet to, when they talk to their friends,
[2:56:21.800 --> 2:56:24.800]  if everyone says they're connected, they say, how?
[2:56:24.800 --> 2:56:28.800]  There's some things out there called NNDB.com,
[2:56:28.800 --> 2:56:31.800]  like no-name database or have you want to say it,
[2:56:31.800 --> 2:56:37.800]  NNDB.com and Muckatee.com, M-U-C-K-E-T-Y.com,
[2:56:37.800 --> 2:56:40.800]  and they provide a vast resource of how everyone is connected.
[2:56:40.800 --> 2:56:44.800]  I heard, I only can hear, you know, previous days of your shows
[2:56:44.800 --> 2:56:47.800]  because I get them from when it's a day after,
[2:56:47.800 --> 2:56:50.800]  but I was hearing about partnership for New York.
[2:56:50.800 --> 2:56:54.800]  I'm sorry. It's the most diabolical partnership I've ever seen.
[2:56:54.800 --> 2:56:59.800]  You know, Rockefeller, Carbis, crazy people connected in there.
[2:56:59.800 --> 2:57:01.800]  You can see visually there.
[2:57:01.800 --> 2:57:05.800]  For folks that don't know, Dr. Horowitz has filed an affidavit with the FBI
[2:57:05.800 --> 2:57:09.800]  showing a criminal racketeering conspiracy with a partnership
[2:57:09.800 --> 2:57:12.800]  for New York and the Rockefellers behind this whole inoculation hoax.
[2:57:12.800 --> 2:57:14.800]  I appreciate your call.
[2:57:14.800 --> 2:57:16.800]  Dr. Monteef, the Rockefellers.
[2:57:16.800 --> 2:57:20.800]  I mean, eugenics, every time we turn over some evil rock,
[2:57:20.800 --> 2:57:22.800]  the Rockefellers are under it.
[2:57:22.800 --> 2:57:24.800]  They certainly are.
[2:57:24.800 --> 2:57:27.800]  First, they've been added for, you know, been a part of a century,
[2:57:27.800 --> 2:57:30.800]  and it goes all the way back first to old John T.
[2:57:30.800 --> 2:57:32.800]  And then it's done.
[2:57:32.800 --> 2:57:35.800]  These people, you know, at the beginning of the 20th century,
[2:57:35.800 --> 2:57:40.800]  in the early 1900s, were already funding the laboratory at Cold Harbor,
[2:57:40.800 --> 2:57:45.800]  busy creating new diseases at that time.
[2:57:45.800 --> 2:57:50.800]  They always wanted to eliminate the majority of the people in the world.
[2:57:50.800 --> 2:57:54.800]  Of course, basically all one has to do is read the scriptures and find out,
[2:57:54.800 --> 2:57:59.800]  you know, the rider of the pale horse is going to kill a quarter of the percent,
[2:57:59.800 --> 2:58:02.800]  a quarter of the population of the world.
[2:58:02.800 --> 2:58:05.800]  I have the writings of Barbara Marks Hubbard,
[2:58:05.800 --> 2:58:07.800]  who is deeply involved in Luciferianism.
[2:58:07.800 --> 2:58:11.800]  We wrote a book called The Revelation, the Book of Co-Creation.
[2:58:11.800 --> 2:58:12.800]  She didn't write it.
[2:58:12.800 --> 2:58:14.800]  It was traveled to her by a demonic spirit,
[2:58:14.800 --> 2:58:18.800]  which she said, we're going to kill a quarter of the population of the world,
[2:58:18.800 --> 2:58:20.800]  but that is not your job.
[2:58:20.800 --> 2:58:26.800]  That is ours, my dear, because we are the riders of the pale horse death.
[2:58:26.800 --> 2:58:28.800]  And then they had the Earth's first battalion in the military.
[2:58:28.800 --> 2:58:30.800]  They've got a whitewash coming out,
[2:58:30.800 --> 2:58:34.800]  the men who stare at goats with George Clooney about it.
[2:58:34.800 --> 2:58:36.800]  We'll be right back in one minute with more calls.
[2:58:36.800 --> 2:58:39.800]  Dr. Stan Monteef, I'm Alex Jones.
[2:58:42.800 --> 2:58:45.800]  You are listening to GCN.
[2:58:45.800 --> 2:58:48.800]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:51.800 --> 2:58:54.800]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:58:54.800 --> 2:58:57.800]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[2:58:57.800 --> 2:59:00.800]  how much ammunition do you want?
[2:59:00.800 --> 2:59:02.800]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom
[2:59:02.800 --> 2:59:04.800]  and the lives of your loved ones.
[2:59:04.800 --> 2:59:06.800]  Food is your only ammunition.
[2:59:06.800 --> 2:59:07.800]  How much do you want?
[2:59:07.800 --> 2:59:08.800]  When do you want it?
[2:59:08.800 --> 2:59:10.800]  Now or after the battle starts.
[2:59:10.800 --> 2:59:11.800]  When will you need it?
[2:59:11.800 --> 2:59:13.800]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:59:13.800 --> 2:59:15.800]  Will there be any food?
[2:59:15.800 --> 2:59:16.800]  Will it make your children sick?
[2:59:16.800 --> 2:59:19.800]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[2:59:19.800 --> 2:59:21.800]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[2:59:21.800 --> 2:59:25.800]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:59:25.800 --> 2:59:29.800]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:59:29.800 --> 2:59:30.800]  How much will you need?
[2:59:30.800 --> 2:59:31.800]  We don't know.
[2:59:31.800 --> 2:59:32.800]  How much do you want?
[2:59:32.800 --> 2:59:33.800]  All you can get.
[2:59:33.800 --> 2:59:34.800]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:59:34.800 --> 2:59:37.800]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[2:59:37.800 --> 2:59:45.800]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:59:45.800 --> 2:59:56.800]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[3:00:15.800 --> 3:00:20.800]  Coming up, our maximum alert dealing with the troops being deployed all over the United States.
[3:00:20.800 --> 3:00:21.800]  What's happening with the flu?
[3:00:21.800 --> 3:00:23.800]  Your calls and a lot more.
[3:00:23.800 --> 3:00:26.800]  Understand my teeth of RadioLiberty.com is our guest.
[3:00:26.800 --> 3:00:30.800]  A lot of great books and videos and materials available at RadioLiberty.com.
[3:00:30.800 --> 3:00:31.800]  I'm very thankful for him joining us.
[3:00:31.800 --> 3:00:34.800]  I want to get him back up about eugenics in the near future.
[3:00:34.800 --> 3:00:40.800]  In fact, Doc, I keep meaning to come out and interview you for a new eugenics film I'm working on.
[3:00:40.800 --> 3:00:42.800]  We need to set that up.
[3:00:42.800 --> 3:00:44.800]  I'm also interviewing Dr. Blalock for it.
[3:00:44.800 --> 3:00:46.800]  Let's talk to Mike and Mass.
[3:00:46.800 --> 3:00:47.800]  Mike, you're on the air.
[3:00:47.800 --> 3:00:48.800]  Go ahead.
[3:00:48.800 --> 3:00:49.800]  Hi, Alex.
[3:00:49.800 --> 3:00:50.800]  Hi, Doc.
[3:00:50.800 --> 3:00:51.800]  How are you doing?
[3:00:51.800 --> 3:00:52.800]  I'm doing fine.
[3:00:52.800 --> 3:00:53.800]  That's good.
[3:00:53.800 --> 3:00:55.800]  I'm a nursing student in Massachusetts.
[3:00:55.800 --> 3:01:03.800]  I brought up to my dean the first day of classes on the Massachusetts Bill 2020 about forced inoculations.
[3:01:03.800 --> 3:01:04.800]  She told me that.
[3:01:04.800 --> 3:01:06.800]  Well, she advised me that.
[3:01:06.800 --> 3:01:12.800]  It'd be wise if I didn't tell the other students about this bill and the effects of it.
[3:01:12.800 --> 3:01:17.800]  Yeah, well, they have the bill to come in your home and forcibly take your children and inoculate you.
[3:01:17.800 --> 3:01:18.800]  That's on mainstream news.
[3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:22.800]  And you're not supposed to talk about it, though, because in America you're not allowed to?
[3:01:22.800 --> 3:01:23.800]  Exactly.
[3:01:23.800 --> 3:01:29.800]  But I took the liberty upon myself to take the video that was posted on your site with the judge yesterday.
[3:01:29.800 --> 3:01:35.800]  And I went on Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, all those globalism websites.
[3:01:35.800 --> 3:01:37.800]  And you did it against them and started spreading the word.
[3:01:37.800 --> 3:01:42.800]  And I call all Massachusetts residents to do the same.
[3:01:42.800 --> 3:01:43.800]  We have to use this technology.
[3:01:43.800 --> 3:01:44.800]  But hold on.
[3:01:44.800 --> 3:01:46.800]  Who told you you're not supposed to talk to people?
[3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:49.800]  The dean of my department of the nursing program.
[3:01:49.800 --> 3:01:54.800]  And in America you can't talk about what's on the news or what's being debated in the newspaper.
[3:01:54.800 --> 3:01:55.800]  That's the new freedom.
[3:01:55.800 --> 3:01:56.800]  That's the freedom.
[3:01:56.800 --> 3:02:01.800]  But I went against her orders as a true patriot does.
[3:02:01.800 --> 3:02:07.800]  Who are all these people that just gleefully serve evil?
[3:02:07.800 --> 3:02:11.800]  Well, unfortunately, a lot of them just want to go along and get along.
[3:02:11.800 --> 3:02:16.800]  They think that, you know, well, if they just go along and that this is not going to affect them,
[3:02:16.800 --> 3:02:20.800]  they don't understand that if they serve these evil forces,
[3:02:20.800 --> 3:02:23.800]  eventually they themselves will be destroyed.
[3:02:23.800 --> 3:02:25.800]  And I saw Germany.
[3:02:25.800 --> 3:02:28.800]  I was the military officer, medical officer.
[3:02:28.800 --> 3:02:31.800]  And I was in Germany after the Second World War.
[3:02:31.800 --> 3:02:33.800]  I saw there that he's in trouble.
[3:02:33.800 --> 3:02:40.800]  I mean, total destruction of many of the major cities over there because the good people did nothing.
[3:02:40.800 --> 3:02:42.800]  And that old attitude is so true.
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:46.800]  All that's necessary for evil to triumph is the good people do nothing.
[3:02:46.800 --> 3:02:49.800]  But we have to be involved and we have to be involved now.
[3:02:49.800 --> 3:02:52.800]  And there is a growing awareness across the country.
[3:02:52.800 --> 3:02:59.800]  I know you sense it, I sense it, of the people who are on the front lines of this, what's going on, sense it.
[3:02:59.800 --> 3:03:04.800]  And I think a lot of people in the medical profession are up in arms.
[3:03:04.800 --> 3:03:07.800]  They'll just stand together and just say, we're not going to do it.
[3:03:07.800 --> 3:03:10.800]  I would tell you, since I am in the medical profession,
[3:03:10.800 --> 3:03:15.800]  I get all sorts of things from various government agencies and they're putting on special seminars.
[3:03:15.800 --> 3:03:20.800]  How are we going to convince the people who are healthcare workers to take this,
[3:03:20.800 --> 3:03:23.800]  this vaccine because they don't want to take it?
[3:03:23.800 --> 3:03:26.800]  How are we going to get them to do something they want to do?
[3:03:26.800 --> 3:03:29.800]  Here's what you do and they lay out a whole plan for them.
[3:03:29.800 --> 3:03:32.800]  Well, doctor, hold on. You said you could stay.
[3:03:32.800 --> 3:03:36.800]  Can you do one more long segment to finish up telling us about that and then take some more calls?
[3:03:36.800 --> 3:03:37.800]  Okay.
[3:03:37.800 --> 3:03:42.800]  Because, again, I see this more and more as we're winning.
[3:03:42.800 --> 3:03:44.800]  People are waking up to vaccines.
[3:03:44.800 --> 3:03:47.800]  So they're trying through fear to push it on us.
[3:03:47.800 --> 3:03:52.800]  I see this almost as a failing forward or fleeing forward, doctor.
[3:03:52.800 --> 3:03:53.800]  I agree with you.
[3:03:53.800 --> 3:03:56.800]  I think that this is the greatest issue from our point of view,
[3:03:56.800 --> 3:04:00.800]  because now suddenly this is not what's going on over in Iraq.
[3:04:00.800 --> 3:04:04.800]  This is not the genocide that's being carried out over in Africa.
[3:04:04.800 --> 3:04:07.800]  This is going to affect people in this country.
[3:04:07.800 --> 3:04:11.800]  And you know, there's nothing to get your attention more than when your own ox gets scored.
[3:04:11.800 --> 3:04:15.800]  And I think a lot of healthcare workers are going to be up in arms about this.
[3:04:15.800 --> 3:04:17.800]  Oh, they are.
[3:04:17.800 --> 3:04:21.800]  I've got an article about big demonstrations forming around the country of healthcare workers.
[3:04:21.800 --> 3:04:23.800]  Anything else, Mike, in mass?
[3:04:23.800 --> 3:04:27.800]  Yeah, I just wanted to end with, if they do pass this bill in Massachusetts,
[3:04:27.800 --> 3:04:30.800]  and police officers are doing house to house or business to business,
[3:04:30.800 --> 3:04:34.800]  there won't be, you could say, a second shot heard around the world
[3:04:34.800 --> 3:04:37.800]  that's referring to the original American weapons issue.
[3:04:37.800 --> 3:04:38.800]  Yeah, well, that's the thing.
[3:04:38.800 --> 3:04:42.800]  If 1% of citizens don't take the shot and fight back,
[3:04:42.800 --> 3:04:45.800]  that's 3 million people firing weapons at police.
[3:04:45.800 --> 3:04:48.800]  We don't want this to happen, because the new order wants to start this war.
[3:04:48.800 --> 3:04:54.800]  And I hope police and military know they're being marched in up against the spirit of 1776,
[3:04:54.800 --> 3:04:56.800]  and they're going to be crushed.
[3:04:56.800 --> 3:05:00.800]  But that's part of the plan. I'll explain when we get back.
[3:05:00.800 --> 3:05:02.800]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones,
[3:05:02.800 --> 3:05:05.800]  and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[3:05:05.800 --> 3:05:07.800]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:05:07.800 --> 3:05:10.800]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[3:05:10.800 --> 3:05:15.800]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:05:15.800 --> 3:05:18.800]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive,
[3:05:18.800 --> 3:05:20.800]  immune, and developmental system diseases.
[3:05:20.800 --> 3:05:22.800]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[3:05:22.800 --> 3:05:27.800]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control
[3:05:27.800 --> 3:05:29.800]  of you and your family's drinking water.
[3:05:29.800 --> 3:05:34.800]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere,
[3:05:34.800 --> 3:05:37.800]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis,
[3:05:37.800 --> 3:05:40.800]  and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[3:05:40.800 --> 3:05:43.800]  That's right. Clean water right from the air you breathe.

[3:06:59.800 --> 3:07:02.800]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[3:07:02.800 --> 3:07:04.800]  What does humidity mean to you?
[3:07:04.800 --> 3:07:07.800]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days,
[3:07:07.800 --> 3:07:12.800]  but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[3:07:12.800 --> 3:07:15.800]  That's why I'd like you to visit acoloblu.com.
[3:07:15.800 --> 3:07:19.800]  Acola Blue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator
[3:07:19.800 --> 3:07:24.800]  producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis
[3:07:24.800 --> 3:07:28.800]  and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system
[3:07:28.800 --> 3:07:31.800]  which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.

[3:08:26.800 --> 3:08:30.800]  Dr. Montee, we're going to continue with phone calls.
[3:08:30.800 --> 3:08:33.800]  But I wanted to ask you,
[3:08:33.800 --> 3:08:38.800]  if we know Bayer and Baxter knowingly shipped out HIV, hepatitis blood
[3:08:38.800 --> 3:08:41.800]  in their own documents in court, MSNBC has reported it,
[3:08:41.800 --> 3:08:46.800]  knowing it would kill the hemophiliacs and others that took the Factor A product.
[3:08:46.800 --> 3:08:49.800]  This was basically a matter of eugenics.
[3:08:49.800 --> 3:08:52.800]  You see, wouldn't the world, if you are eugenicist,
[3:08:52.800 --> 3:08:55.800]  who believe in eugenics, wouldn't the world be better off
[3:08:55.800 --> 3:08:57.800]  than the world in the hemophiliacs,
[3:08:57.800 --> 3:08:59.800]  because then we wouldn't have the disease.
[3:08:59.800 --> 3:09:01.800]  They set out to kill the hemophiliacs.
[3:09:01.800 --> 3:09:04.800]  They killed almost half of them in the United States.
[3:09:04.800 --> 3:09:08.800]  They shipped Factor A that they knew would kill the hemophiliacs
[3:09:08.800 --> 3:09:11.800]  to Canada, to France.
[3:09:11.800 --> 3:09:12.800]  Well, I want you to elaborate on that,
[3:09:12.800 --> 3:09:14.800]  but just to finish the full question,
[3:09:14.800 --> 3:09:18.800]  if we know they did that and other companies have done thousands of other things,
[3:09:18.800 --> 3:09:22.800]  why do we then trust any vaccines they come out with,
[3:09:22.800 --> 3:09:25.800]  anything they say, Bayer worked with Hitler.
[3:09:25.800 --> 3:09:27.800]  It's all these companies.
[3:09:27.800 --> 3:09:32.800]  I mean, it's so elementary, and then they admit this flu isn't dangerous.
[3:09:32.800 --> 3:09:35.800]  I mean, compared to regular flu,
[3:09:35.800 --> 3:09:38.800]  30-some percent of people already have it, didn't even get sick.
[3:09:38.800 --> 3:09:42.800]  I mean, just how we, I mean, how is it,
[3:09:42.800 --> 3:09:44.800]  why aren't people waking up quicker?
[3:09:44.800 --> 3:09:48.800]  Well, what we need to do is simply keep talking and talking about it.
[3:09:48.800 --> 3:09:52.800]  I'm sure you're well aware of the fact that Baxter says, you know,
[3:09:52.800 --> 3:09:58.800]  a batch is a massive batch of influenza vaccines in Europe
[3:09:58.800 --> 3:10:06.800]  that actually contains the deadly H1N5 or H5N1 avian flu viruses.
[3:10:06.800 --> 3:10:10.800]  Our bodies would fight this off if we don't get infected by it
[3:10:10.800 --> 3:10:12.800]  unless they inject it into you.
[3:10:12.800 --> 3:10:14.800]  And they were going to give it to millions of people
[3:10:14.800 --> 3:10:17.800]  if it hadn't been for the Czechoslovakians who tested the vaccine
[3:10:17.800 --> 3:10:22.800]  before it was given and found it killed all the ferrets that then checked the vaccine.
[3:10:22.800 --> 3:10:24.800]  They would have killed millions of people.
[3:10:24.800 --> 3:10:27.800]  And I'm talking with them the last several months.
[3:10:27.800 --> 3:10:30.800]  This happened, and Baxter said,
[3:10:30.800 --> 3:10:36.800]  oh gee, we just have no idea how the deadly virus got in our flu vaccine.
[3:10:36.800 --> 3:10:37.800]  Let me ask you this.
[3:10:37.800 --> 3:10:39.800]  So believe it for a minute.
[3:10:39.800 --> 3:10:42.800]  This is why I think they were moving towards the climax in history.
[3:10:42.800 --> 3:10:47.800]  That would have been the greatest criminal act of all time,
[3:10:47.800 --> 3:10:50.800]  would have dwarfed anything that Adon Pepper ever did.
[3:10:50.800 --> 3:10:57.800]  And we would have heard on the news that it was a mutated bird flu killing everybody,
[3:10:57.800 --> 3:10:59.800]  and we would have never known it was Baxter.
[3:10:59.800 --> 3:11:02.800]  But by the grace of God, a lab technician discovered it.
[3:11:02.800 --> 3:11:06.800]  And basically, this was the last couple of months,
[3:11:06.800 --> 3:11:08.800]  and anybody can check these facts out.
[3:11:08.800 --> 3:11:12.800]  Currently, we have access to the vaccine.
[3:11:12.800 --> 3:11:13.800]  As you go to your search engine,
[3:11:13.800 --> 3:11:17.800]  they put in Baxter the avian flu virus,
[3:11:17.800 --> 3:11:20.800]  and it was put into a flu vaccine.
[3:11:20.800 --> 3:11:22.800]  But they would do that.
[3:11:22.800 --> 3:11:26.800]  I mean, they should have immediately arrested the people from Baxter
[3:11:26.800 --> 3:11:27.800]  and put them in prison.
[3:11:27.800 --> 3:11:31.800]  We're talking about the attempt to kill millions of people.
[3:11:31.800 --> 3:11:33.800]  Well, let me go further, doctor.
[3:11:33.800 --> 3:11:35.800]  Then it came out on a London Telegraph
[3:11:35.800 --> 3:11:40.800]  of 100 homeless that were given this shot, a bird flu vaccine,
[3:11:40.800 --> 3:11:43.800]  and told that it was regular flu vaccine, the city.
[3:11:43.800 --> 3:11:44.800]  One city in Poland paid them.
[3:11:44.800 --> 3:11:46.800]  This happened all over Europe.
[3:11:46.800 --> 3:11:49.800]  21 of the 100 that were tested died.
[3:11:49.800 --> 3:11:51.800]  So this is a deadly weapon.
[3:11:51.800 --> 3:11:54.800]  And then no one from the vaccine makers got in trouble.
[3:11:54.800 --> 3:11:57.800]  They arrested the city officials.
[3:11:57.800 --> 3:12:00.800]  Well, I think it's about time the American people,
[3:12:00.800 --> 3:12:04.800]  I honestly believe that the one that they're going to give in Europe
[3:12:04.800 --> 3:12:07.800]  would be much more deadly than the one they gave here in the United States.
[3:12:07.800 --> 3:12:09.800]  But I'm not certain of that,
[3:12:09.800 --> 3:12:12.800]  and you shouldn't take it anyway because it contains mercury,
[3:12:12.800 --> 3:12:15.800]  but you do not know what is in this.
[3:12:15.800 --> 3:12:18.800]  I mean, we can go back to the history of vaccines.
[3:12:18.800 --> 3:12:22.800]  We can start back, certainly, back in 1942
[3:12:22.800 --> 3:12:25.800]  when they gave our military yellow fever vaccine.
[3:12:25.800 --> 3:12:28.800]  But they forgot to test it ahead of time.
[3:12:28.800 --> 3:12:32.800]  And because they got yellow jaundice because it had a hepatitis B.
[3:12:32.800 --> 3:12:39.800]  And actually about 300,000 American troops got the virus.
[3:12:39.800 --> 3:12:42.800]  Fortunately, only about 28,000 came down with a Z.
[3:12:42.800 --> 3:12:44.800]  I don't know how many of them died.
[3:12:44.800 --> 3:12:47.800]  Only 28,000 had their liver eaten.
[3:12:47.800 --> 3:12:49.800]  How nice of the government.
[3:12:49.800 --> 3:12:51.800]  What people do not know,
[3:12:51.800 --> 3:12:54.800]  and this is one of the most carefully kept secrets of modern times,
[3:12:54.800 --> 3:12:56.800]  is that there are,
[3:12:56.800 --> 3:12:58.800]  and you can go to the World Health Organization website
[3:12:58.800 --> 3:13:00.800]  and get the information,
[3:13:00.800 --> 3:13:02.800]  two billion people.
[3:13:02.800 --> 3:13:04.800]  That is not million.
[3:13:04.800 --> 3:13:07.800]  That's two billion people have been infected
[3:13:07.800 --> 3:13:10.800]  with hepatitis B throughout the world.
[3:13:10.800 --> 3:13:12.800]  How did they get it?
[3:13:12.800 --> 3:13:15.800]  The vast majority of them got from the World Health Organization
[3:13:15.800 --> 3:13:18.800]  vaccine immunization program,
[3:13:18.800 --> 3:13:21.800]  where they just accidentally used dirty needles.
[3:13:21.800 --> 3:13:23.800]  Oh.
[3:13:23.800 --> 3:13:25.800]  Of course, that's the spin.
[3:13:25.800 --> 3:13:27.800]  I saw the BBC article about four years ago,
[3:13:27.800 --> 3:13:29.800]  where it said in one African country,
[3:13:29.800 --> 3:13:32.800]  we don't know why 47% of the women all have HIV,
[3:13:32.800 --> 3:13:34.800]  and we've had medical tests.
[3:13:34.800 --> 3:13:36.800]  A lot of these little 10-year-old girls
[3:13:36.800 --> 3:13:38.800]  have never had sexual intercourse.
[3:13:38.800 --> 3:13:42.800]  You know, they still have their,
[3:13:42.800 --> 3:13:44.800]  I guess, the hymen in place.
[3:13:44.800 --> 3:13:46.800]  And then the BBC said,
[3:13:46.800 --> 3:13:48.800]  oh, they must have used dirty needles,
[3:13:48.800 --> 3:13:50.800]  the U.N. inoculators, bull.
[3:13:50.800 --> 3:13:52.800]  As you know, doctor,
[3:13:52.800 --> 3:13:55.800]  it's very hard to get HIV from a first needle stick.
[3:13:55.800 --> 3:13:57.800]  Now, this was clearly the researchers believe
[3:13:57.800 --> 3:13:59.800]  that they injected into them
[3:13:59.800 --> 3:14:01.800]  in the different vaccines they were being given.
[3:14:01.800 --> 3:14:03.800]  Unfortunately, I think you're true.
[3:14:03.800 --> 3:14:05.800]  Well, here in the United States,
[3:14:05.800 --> 3:14:07.800]  you know, basically,
[3:14:07.800 --> 3:14:10.800]  they gave an experimental hepatitis B vaccine.
[3:14:10.800 --> 3:14:14.800]  It was about 1966 or 1977,
[3:14:14.800 --> 3:14:18.800]  to coal hearts of homosexuals who volunteered for this,
[3:14:18.800 --> 3:14:21.800]  that this was a hepatitis B trial,
[3:14:21.800 --> 3:14:23.800]  you know, to see if the vaccine worked in New York,
[3:14:23.800 --> 3:14:26.800]  in San Francisco, and in Los Angeles.
[3:14:26.800 --> 3:14:29.800]  And a few years later, all the homosexuals there
[3:14:29.800 --> 3:14:31.800]  started, or most of them,
[3:14:31.800 --> 3:14:33.800]  started coming down with a strange new disease
[3:14:33.800 --> 3:14:35.800]  that turned out to be AIDS.
[3:14:35.800 --> 3:14:38.800]  In San Francisco, and we have the figures for it,
[3:14:38.800 --> 3:14:43.800]  75% of the young homosexuals, idealistic people,
[3:14:43.800 --> 3:14:47.800]  who were trying to stop the spread of hepatitis B
[3:14:47.800 --> 3:14:50.800]  in their community,
[3:14:50.800 --> 3:14:54.800]  77% of them came down with AIDS,
[3:14:54.800 --> 3:14:56.800]  almost all dead today.
[3:14:56.800 --> 3:14:58.800]  And why did the government use them?
[3:14:58.800 --> 3:15:00.800]  Because they were very sexually promiscuous,
[3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:02.800]  and it was perfect to use them
[3:15:02.800 --> 3:15:05.800]  as the seed vector to spread it.
[3:15:05.800 --> 3:15:07.800]  And if it's the cover, you say,
[3:15:07.800 --> 3:15:10.800]  oh, well, their province clearly is doing that.
[3:15:10.800 --> 3:15:12.800]  And so, basically, of course, we thought,
[3:15:12.800 --> 3:15:14.800]  well, and I will have to admit,
[3:15:14.800 --> 3:15:17.800]  I could not believe this initially.
[3:15:17.800 --> 3:15:19.800]  I thought that, you know,
[3:15:19.800 --> 3:15:22.800]  as it got to 77% of the homosexuals,
[3:15:22.800 --> 3:15:25.800]  you know, who had taken this vaccine,
[3:15:25.800 --> 3:15:27.800]  obviously it was going to just explode
[3:15:27.800 --> 3:15:29.800]  in the rest of the homosexual population.
[3:15:29.800 --> 3:15:31.800]  It was going to get in the heterosexual population,
[3:15:31.800 --> 3:15:33.800]  which is equally promiscuous,
[3:15:33.800 --> 3:15:35.800]  and it really didn't do it.
[3:15:35.800 --> 3:15:39.800]  It was also meant to launch the global fear-mongering.
[3:15:39.800 --> 3:15:43.800]  This virus is designed to kill black,
[3:15:43.800 --> 3:15:45.800]  and in the United States today,
[3:15:45.800 --> 3:15:49.800]  almost half of the AIDS cases are in black,
[3:15:49.800 --> 3:15:52.800]  and almost half of the people who've died of AIDS
[3:15:52.800 --> 3:15:54.800]  are black in the United States.
[3:15:54.800 --> 3:15:57.800]  And as you said, doctor, they've done the studies.
[3:15:57.800 --> 3:15:59.800]  My dad's shown me these in medical journals,
[3:15:59.800 --> 3:16:01.800]  he's a physician,
[3:16:01.800 --> 3:16:04.800]  that you'll take a black that is less promiscuous
[3:16:04.800 --> 3:16:07.800]  in these average actuaries than whites
[3:16:07.800 --> 3:16:09.800]  with the test subjects,
[3:16:09.800 --> 3:16:11.800]  and they have a much higher rate of getting it,
[3:16:11.800 --> 3:16:13.800]  and they found in the studies, we can tell us about that,
[3:16:13.800 --> 3:16:15.800]  we'll keep you longer, we'll take some calls,
[3:16:15.800 --> 3:16:18.800]  that it's easier for blacks to get HIV.
[3:16:18.800 --> 3:16:24.800]  They know how to create diseases that are race-specific.
[3:16:24.800 --> 3:16:27.800]  In other words, if you want to infect blacks,
[3:16:27.800 --> 3:16:29.800]  they have slightly different genetic makeup,
[3:16:29.800 --> 3:16:31.800]  and you can actually engineer a disease,
[3:16:31.800 --> 3:16:34.800]  and this is an engineered disease.
[3:16:34.800 --> 3:16:36.800]  How do we know it was engineered?
[3:16:36.800 --> 3:16:38.800]  Because one of the fellows who was part of the engineering
[3:16:38.800 --> 3:16:41.800]  came forward, he was dying of pancreatic cancer,
[3:16:41.800 --> 3:16:44.800]  and he told a man named Gary Glum the story,
[3:16:44.800 --> 3:16:48.800]  and actually the book is called Full Disclosure.
[3:16:48.800 --> 3:16:50.800]  In fact, you can go to my website,
[3:16:50.800 --> 3:16:53.800]  we actually have the print of the book there,
[3:16:53.800 --> 3:16:57.800]  and yet all of the links have been disconnected,
[3:16:57.800 --> 3:16:59.800]  they don't want you to read the book,
[3:16:59.800 --> 3:17:01.800]  but the book is called Full Disclosure,
[3:17:01.800 --> 3:17:04.800]  you can probably get a copy on the Amazon,
[3:17:04.800 --> 3:17:06.800]  someplace like that,
[3:17:06.800 --> 3:17:08.800]  and here's a fellow who was part of this whole thing,
[3:17:08.800 --> 3:17:11.800]  he's dying, he tells the whole story,
[3:17:11.800 --> 3:17:13.800]  and totally blacked out by the controlled media,
[3:17:13.800 --> 3:17:16.800]  because it's too horrible for people to believe
[3:17:16.800 --> 3:17:19.800]  that they would target blacks to kill on the black part.
[3:17:19.800 --> 3:17:23.800]  And I want to say this, I was listening to XM left today,
[3:17:23.800 --> 3:17:26.800]  the liberal XM channel,
[3:17:26.800 --> 3:17:31.800]  I heard two black soldiers in a 20 minute drive into work
[3:17:31.800 --> 3:17:33.800]  calling up the liberal talk show host,
[3:17:33.800 --> 3:17:37.800]  defending collateral damage in the million dead Iraqis,
[3:17:37.800 --> 3:17:39.800]  and it came to my mind, I said,
[3:17:39.800 --> 3:17:42.800]  here are these black soldiers serving the New World Order,
[3:17:42.800 --> 3:17:44.800]  thinking they're fighting for America,
[3:17:44.800 --> 3:17:47.800]  and meanwhile, Tuskegee experiment aids,
[3:17:47.800 --> 3:17:50.800]  this government wants to murder them,
[3:17:50.800 --> 3:17:53.800]  and they will go to the grave loving their murderers.
[3:17:53.800 --> 3:17:55.800]  And Chris, the thing is that they have targeted the blacks,
[3:17:55.800 --> 3:17:58.800]  that's what, of course, why they put the abortion clinics
[3:17:58.800 --> 3:18:00.800]  into the black community.
[3:18:00.800 --> 3:18:03.800]  Look at Obama taking the funding block off
[3:18:03.800 --> 3:18:05.800]  for abortions in Africa.
[3:18:05.800 --> 3:18:08.800]  I mean, people find it difficult to believe
[3:18:08.800 --> 3:18:11.800]  that there is a genocidal program
[3:18:11.800 --> 3:18:14.800]  first for the blacks, but next for the whites,
[3:18:14.800 --> 3:18:16.800]  and now they're getting around to the white part.
[3:18:16.800 --> 3:18:19.800]  And you go into companies like, say,
[3:18:19.800 --> 3:18:22.800]  Bobboi in Africa today,
[3:18:22.800 --> 3:18:25.800]  and the average age of a black man,
[3:18:25.800 --> 3:18:28.800]  you know, the average man would die at 64.
[3:18:28.800 --> 3:18:32.800]  Today, the average age of a black man who dies at 34,
[3:18:32.800 --> 3:18:35.800]  they have a life, they've done this intentionally,
[3:18:35.800 --> 3:18:36.800]  they've done it with aids,
[3:18:36.800 --> 3:18:39.800]  there's other programs that they have to kill off the blacks.
[3:18:39.800 --> 3:18:42.800]  And sir, that's another point, and correct me if I'm wrong,
[3:18:42.800 --> 3:18:45.800]  but I've had other medical doctors on and folks
[3:18:45.800 --> 3:18:49.800]  that study statistics.
[3:18:49.800 --> 3:18:54.800]  Before, around 40% of children would die
[3:18:54.800 --> 3:18:57.800]  before the age of five or six,
[3:18:57.800 --> 3:19:00.800]  and so that would show that the average life expectancy
[3:19:00.800 --> 3:19:02.800]  was 55 years old in frontier days.
[3:19:02.800 --> 3:19:05.800]  But if you lived past five or six,
[3:19:05.800 --> 3:19:07.800]  people actually were living longer,
[3:19:07.800 --> 3:19:10.800]  and 90 in many cases on average.
[3:19:10.800 --> 3:19:11.800]  You go to old graveyards,
[3:19:11.800 --> 3:19:13.800]  you see half the graves are for three-year-olds,
[3:19:13.800 --> 3:19:15.800]  four-year-olds, five-year-olds, two-year-olds.
[3:19:15.800 --> 3:19:18.800]  But now, if you take out the infant mortality rate
[3:19:18.800 --> 3:19:21.800]  being lower today than it was 150 years ago,
[3:19:21.800 --> 3:19:24.800]  our life expectancy is plunged.
[3:19:24.800 --> 3:19:26.800]  So has the Russians, the Africans,
[3:19:26.800 --> 3:19:29.800]  every country that takes vaccines.
[3:19:29.800 --> 3:19:30.800]  Absolutely.
[3:19:30.800 --> 3:19:34.800]  And the thing is, this is why Bill and Belindicates,
[3:19:34.800 --> 3:19:38.800]  who are totally dedicated to population control,
[3:19:38.800 --> 3:19:40.800]  are simply funding putting the seeds up
[3:19:40.800 --> 3:19:42.800]  above the Arctic Circle,
[3:19:42.800 --> 3:19:44.800]  that's why they're funding giving the vaccines
[3:19:44.800 --> 3:19:45.800]  to all of those black children.
[3:19:45.800 --> 3:19:46.800]  Stay there.
[3:19:46.800 --> 3:19:47.800]  Let's talk about them.
[3:19:47.800 --> 3:19:49.800]  I'll just go ahead and keep you for another 20 minutes
[3:19:49.800 --> 3:19:50.800]  if you can do it,
[3:19:50.800 --> 3:19:52.800]  because I want to go to Chris, John, Steve, Mark, and Rob,
[3:19:52.800 --> 3:19:53.800]  and everybody else.
[3:19:53.800 --> 3:19:54.800]  Let's talk about Belindicates,
[3:19:54.800 --> 3:19:56.800]  the ghouls of Planned Parenthood.
[3:19:56.800 --> 3:20:01.800]  They run it.
[3:20:01.800 --> 3:20:03.800]  If you're tired of paying too much for gas,
[3:20:03.800 --> 3:20:05.800]  diesel, or heating oil,
[3:20:05.800 --> 3:20:08.800]  future fuel technologies has the answer you're looking for.
[3:20:08.800 --> 3:20:10.800]  It's called FFT Fuel Saver.
[3:20:10.800 --> 3:20:13.800]  FFT Fuel Saver is made using a patented formula
[3:20:13.800 --> 3:20:15.800]  that helps fuel burn cleaner,
[3:20:15.800 --> 3:20:18.800]  resulting in a 10 to 20% increase in fuel efficiency
[3:20:18.800 --> 3:20:21.800]  and reduces emissions 30% or more.
[3:20:21.800 --> 3:20:24.800]  Each bottle of FFT Fuel Saver will save you money.
[3:20:24.800 --> 3:20:27.800]  Increase your MPG, improve engine performance,
[3:20:27.800 --> 3:20:30.800]  and will treat up to 160 gallons of fuel.
[3:20:30.800 --> 3:20:32.800]  When used in your car, truck, motorcycle, or boat,
[3:20:32.800 --> 3:20:35.800]  you will feel the results in 20 miles or less.
[3:20:35.800 --> 3:20:38.800]  FFT Fuel Saver is registered with the EPA.
[3:20:38.800 --> 3:20:41.800]  The Better Business Bureau is made in the USA
[3:20:41.800 --> 3:20:43.800]  and comes with a money-back guarantee.

[3:20:57.800 --> 3:21:00.800]  FFT, simply the best fuel saver on Earth.
[3:21:00.800 --> 3:21:03.800]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[3:21:03.800 --> 3:21:06.800]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:21:06.800 --> 3:21:08.800]  We've got to give them a stake
[3:21:08.800 --> 3:21:10.800]  in creating the kind of world order
[3:21:10.800 --> 3:21:12.800]  that I think all of us would like to see.
[3:21:12.800 --> 3:21:15.800]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[3:21:15.800 --> 3:21:17.800]  that Obama is working for the best interests
[3:21:17.800 --> 3:21:19.800]  of the American people.
[3:21:19.800 --> 3:21:21.800]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[3:21:21.800 --> 3:21:23.800]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:21:23.800 --> 3:21:26.800]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[3:21:26.800 --> 3:21:29.800]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program
[3:21:29.800 --> 3:21:32.800]  of a group of extreme bankers
[3:21:32.800 --> 3:21:35.800]  and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:21:36.800 --> 3:21:38.800]  It's not about left to right.
[3:21:38.800 --> 3:21:40.800]  It's about a one-world government.
[3:21:40.800 --> 3:21:43.800]  This film documents who Obama works for,
[3:21:43.800 --> 3:21:45.800]  the lies he is told,
[3:21:45.800 --> 3:21:47.800]  and his real agenda.

[3:21:55.800 --> 3:21:57.800]  The Obama deception.
[3:21:57.800 --> 3:21:59.800]  The people strike back.
[3:22:01.800 --> 3:22:02.800]  Gold isn't for you?
[3:22:02.800 --> 3:22:04.800]  Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources,
[3:22:04.800 --> 3:22:06.800]  one of the world's premier gold and precious
[3:22:06.800 --> 3:22:07.800]  metal investing firms.
[3:22:07.800 --> 3:22:08.800]  I get it.
[3:22:08.800 --> 3:22:10.800]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed
[3:22:10.800 --> 3:22:12.800]  that the government is doing a great job
[3:22:12.800 --> 3:22:14.800]  that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars
[3:22:14.800 --> 3:22:16.800]  like bailout candy that social security
[3:22:16.800 --> 3:22:17.800]  would be there for you.
[3:22:17.800 --> 3:22:19.800]  That's not what's happening.
[3:22:19.800 --> 3:22:21.800]  You might even pass on gold
[3:22:21.800 --> 3:22:23.800]  if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation,
[3:22:23.800 --> 3:22:25.800]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value,
[3:22:25.800 --> 3:22:27.800]  or that your retirement would be secure.
[3:22:27.800 --> 3:22:29.800]  If all looks rosy to you,
[3:22:29.800 --> 3:22:31.800]  then now is not the time to buy gold.
[3:22:31.800 --> 3:22:32.800]  For the realists,
[3:22:32.800 --> 3:22:34.800]  there have never been more sobering reasons
[3:22:34.800 --> 3:22:35.800]  to diversify with gold.
[3:22:35.800 --> 3:22:36.800]  Since 2001,
[3:22:36.800 --> 3:22:39.800]  the US dollar index has tanked 30%
[3:22:39.800 --> 3:22:41.800]  while gold has risen 300%.
[3:22:41.800 --> 3:22:43.800]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold
[3:22:43.800 --> 3:22:44.800]  to their portfolios.
[3:22:44.800 --> 3:22:45.800]  You should, too.
[3:22:45.800 --> 3:22:46.800]  Find out what they know.
[3:22:46.800 --> 3:22:48.800]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons
[3:22:48.800 --> 3:22:50.800]  why gold will do very well, free.
[3:22:50.800 --> 3:22:53.800]  800-686-2237.
[3:22:53.800 --> 3:22:56.800]  That's 800-686-2237.
[3:22:56.800 --> 3:22:59.800]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[3:22:59.800 --> 3:23:01.800]  Say no to toxic overload.
[3:23:01.800 --> 3:23:02.800]  Say no to chemicals.
[3:23:02.800 --> 3:23:04.800]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[3:23:04.800 --> 3:23:05.800]  When you have fatigue,
[3:23:05.800 --> 3:23:06.800]  problems concentrating,
[3:23:06.800 --> 3:23:07.800]  muscle weakness, headaches,
[3:23:07.800 --> 3:23:08.800]  digestion, memory loss,
[3:23:08.800 --> 3:23:10.800]  influenza, or joint pain,
[3:23:10.800 --> 3:23:11.800]  the solution may be as simple
[3:23:11.800 --> 3:23:13.800]  as detoxifying your body.
[3:23:13.800 --> 3:23:14.800]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite
[3:23:14.800 --> 3:23:15.800]  helps the body heal itself
[3:23:15.800 --> 3:23:17.800]  so that it can become stronger
[3:23:17.800 --> 3:23:18.800]  to fight off viruses.
[3:23:18.800 --> 3:23:20.800]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[3:23:20.800 --> 3:23:23.800]  Liquid zeolite detoxifies the body
[3:23:23.800 --> 3:23:24.800]  by safely helping remove toxins
[3:23:24.800 --> 3:23:25.800]  and heavy metals,
[3:23:25.800 --> 3:23:26.800]  boosting energy levels,
[3:23:26.800 --> 3:23:28.800]  and promoting a strong immune system.
[3:23:28.800 --> 3:23:30.800]  Liquid zeolite is tasteless, odorless,
[3:23:30.800 --> 3:23:31.800]  and so gentle you won't even know
[3:23:31.800 --> 3:23:32.800]  you're taking it.
[3:23:32.800 --> 3:23:33.800]  Feel great again
[3:23:33.800 --> 3:23:34.800]  in as little as three days
[3:23:34.800 --> 3:23:35.800]  to three weeks.
[3:23:35.800 --> 3:23:36.800]  Liquid zeolite comes with
[3:23:36.800 --> 3:23:37.800]  a money-back guarantee,
[3:23:37.800 --> 3:23:38.800]  but it's only available

[3:24:03.800 --> 3:24:04.800]  The preacher man says
[3:24:04.800 --> 3:24:06.800]  it's the end of time,
[3:24:06.800 --> 3:24:07.800]  and the Mississippi River,
[3:24:07.800 --> 3:24:09.800]  she's a gold grime.
[3:24:11.800 --> 3:24:12.800]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[3:24:12.800 --> 3:24:13.800]  when you discover
[3:24:13.800 --> 3:24:14.800]  that there's a technological
[3:24:14.800 --> 3:24:16.800]  enslavement system,
[3:24:16.800 --> 3:24:18.800]  a scientific dictatorship
[3:24:18.800 --> 3:24:22.400]  And we have a statue of her textbooks here in the office.
[3:24:22.400 --> 3:24:26.600]  We show them to you daily on air where they're talking about how we're stupid and how they
[3:24:26.600 --> 3:24:30.480]  control us and they laugh about how they're killing us.
[3:24:30.480 --> 3:24:32.280]  It angers you.
[3:24:32.280 --> 3:24:39.000]  And then to see the poverty pimps, the liberals, Margaret Sanger, hired by the Rockefellers
[3:24:39.000 --> 3:24:40.200]  90-something years ago.
[3:24:40.200 --> 3:24:43.280]  And I sent off to the universities and got her actual copies of her letters, not just
[3:24:43.280 --> 3:24:48.160]  quotes and books, calling black, subhuman, garbage, weeds that have to be killed.
[3:24:48.160 --> 3:24:52.920]  She came as a liberal lover to the blacks, W. E. B. Du Bois.
[3:24:52.920 --> 3:24:55.880]  They hired him to go out.
[3:24:55.880 --> 3:25:00.160]  And they've destroyed their family with the welfare, paid the women not to have men in
[3:25:00.160 --> 3:25:01.160]  the house.
[3:25:01.160 --> 3:25:02.640]  They've done it to everybody else's community now.
[3:25:02.640 --> 3:25:03.720]  Blacks were the test.
[3:25:03.720 --> 3:25:06.040]  They sold the narcotics in their communities.
[3:25:06.040 --> 3:25:08.060]  They put the Planned Parenthood in their communities.
[3:25:08.060 --> 3:25:12.480]  And then the liberals on TV, Chris Matthews says, if you don't agree with Obama, you're
[3:25:12.480 --> 3:25:13.480]  a racist.
[3:25:13.480 --> 3:25:20.720]  And so the real eugenicists, the real hardcore people that hate blacks, I've documented they're
[3:25:20.720 --> 3:25:23.640]  the ones that poses the liberals.
[3:25:23.640 --> 3:25:28.960]  You see, blacks, you don't have to worry about the FBI-controlled Ku Klux Klan with wearing
[3:25:28.960 --> 3:25:29.960]  the sheets.
[3:25:29.960 --> 3:25:33.280]  The real killers are the liberals, the so-called liberals.
[3:25:33.280 --> 3:25:34.280]  They're not liberal.
[3:25:34.280 --> 3:25:37.240]  They got all these well-meaning idiots under them that don't understand what they're part
[3:25:37.240 --> 3:25:38.240]  of.
[3:25:38.240 --> 3:25:41.560]  But Bill and Melinda Gates, Bill Gates is part of Planned Parenthood.
[3:25:41.560 --> 3:25:44.680]  He's given over $80 billion with Warren Buffett to their foundation.
[3:25:44.680 --> 3:25:46.320]  I have the article somewhere in the stack.
[3:25:46.320 --> 3:25:48.160]  Guys, pull it up on screen.
[3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:49.160]  Times of London.
[3:25:49.160 --> 3:25:53.960]  Rich meet, secret meeting for population control in New York four months ago.
[3:25:53.960 --> 3:25:57.920]  Dr. Monteef, short segment, we're going to come back and talk to Chris, John, Steve, Mark
[3:25:57.920 --> 3:26:00.680]  and Rob, and then let you go.
[3:26:00.680 --> 3:26:02.040]  But you're an expert on eugenics.
[3:26:02.040 --> 3:26:04.160]  You were talking about this before I was born.
[3:26:04.160 --> 3:26:07.760]  I'm 35 years old, been doing this for over 40.
[3:26:07.760 --> 3:26:12.000]  According to them, what his global vaccine program is, he wants to release mosquitoes
[3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:17.640]  that have vaccines in them, explain to people how his father was the former head of Planned
[3:26:17.640 --> 3:26:19.520]  Parenthood, who we're dealing with.
[3:26:19.520 --> 3:26:25.080]  Well, Bill and Melinda Gates, that foundation is funding all sorts of terrible things.
[3:26:25.080 --> 3:26:30.400]  And one of the worst things, of course, is the massive vaccine program for Africa.
[3:26:30.400 --> 3:26:37.200]  Now, of course, here in the United States, why they have taken the mercury out of childhood
[3:26:37.200 --> 3:26:41.240]  vaccines, vaccines that are given for childhood diseases.
[3:26:41.240 --> 3:26:46.600]  Unfortunately, they've left it in the vaccines that are given to children.
[3:26:46.600 --> 3:26:52.160]  What a clever study impact now they've mandated the children as you have in six months debates.
[3:26:52.160 --> 3:26:56.680]  I started getting regular influenza shots with the full dose of mercury.
[3:26:56.680 --> 3:27:00.200]  Now with this wine flu vaccine, they're going to be able to give them four times as much
[3:27:00.200 --> 3:27:01.200]  as they want.
[3:27:01.200 --> 3:27:07.120]  Two shots of regular seasonal vaccine and two shots of swine vaccine, just starting
[3:27:07.120 --> 3:27:12.560]  at six months of age, but through the maximum amount of damage as far as the mercury.
[3:27:12.560 --> 3:27:17.120]  And they know about it because we have their study, it's called the Southwood Study of
[3:27:17.120 --> 3:27:18.120]  the Vaccine Manipulation Report.
[3:27:18.120 --> 3:27:23.720]  It was in a meeting that was held in the year 2000 with people from the CDC and the World
[3:27:23.720 --> 3:27:24.720]  Health Organization.
[3:27:24.720 --> 3:27:29.760]  The vaccine manufacturers got together at a place called Simpson Wood, the Simpson Wood
[3:27:29.760 --> 3:27:30.760]  Report.
[3:27:30.760 --> 3:27:35.960]  And they said, you know, the mercury does produce the autism that destroys the lives
[3:27:35.960 --> 3:27:40.440]  of children, of our children, they're not going to get it, but how are we going to keep
[3:27:40.440 --> 3:27:42.440]  the public from knowing?
[3:27:42.440 --> 3:27:45.480]  Because if they knew this, they wouldn't take our vaccine.
[3:27:45.480 --> 3:27:50.760]  So we know that they know what they're doing and they destroyed the lives of our children
[3:27:50.760 --> 3:27:57.480]  between one and sixty and one and ninety American boys is now autistic and the lives
[3:27:57.480 --> 3:28:00.000]  are destroyed and they know what they're doing.
[3:28:00.000 --> 3:28:07.680]  So Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are funding the vaccine program in Africa and we left
[3:28:07.680 --> 3:28:11.920]  the mercury and the vaccines for giving to the African children.
[3:28:11.920 --> 3:28:17.360]  Now that not only destroys their minds, they destroy their fertility, and the fertility
[3:28:17.360 --> 3:28:22.560]  is destroyed in this generation and in subsequent generations.
[3:28:22.560 --> 3:28:27.320]  And not just this generation, they destroy fertility, but, you know, with their children
[3:28:27.320 --> 3:28:29.320]  and their children's children.
[3:28:29.320 --> 3:28:34.600]  One of the most vicious and horrible things that has ever been done and is being done
[3:28:34.600 --> 3:28:37.680]  by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[3:28:37.680 --> 3:28:40.800]  Now you have to ask yourself, why would they do that?
[3:28:40.800 --> 3:28:46.920]  First of all, why would people who are dedicated to population control want to save the lives
[3:28:46.920 --> 3:28:51.360]  of little African children and they don't want to save their lives, they want to destroy
[3:28:51.360 --> 3:28:52.360]  them?
[3:28:52.360 --> 3:28:54.760]  Yeah, that's one plus one equals a hundred.
[3:28:54.760 --> 3:28:55.760]  It doesn't make sense.
[3:28:55.760 --> 3:29:01.080]  In fact, put that article back up, secret meeting with the Rockefellers, the Gates's,
[3:29:01.080 --> 3:29:05.560]  Warren Buffett, Ted Turner, Ted Turner, who calls us useless eaters and feeders, billionaire
[3:29:05.560 --> 3:29:11.200]  club in bid to curb overpopulation, and they said a secret meeting of how to carry this
[3:29:11.200 --> 3:29:12.200]  out.
[3:29:12.200 --> 3:29:13.200]  Go ahead.
[3:29:13.200 --> 3:29:20.240]  Don't forget George Soros was there, but basically you have to try to say, why would rational
[3:29:20.240 --> 3:29:26.040]  people do this, well, these are not rational people, there are people who've gone over
[3:29:26.040 --> 3:29:31.040]  to these dark sides, and basically there is an organization in the United States, they
[3:29:31.040 --> 3:29:36.720]  have a newsletter, they have offices in New York City, in Geneva, London, they're very
[3:29:36.720 --> 3:29:41.120]  well funded, some of the business people in the world fund them, and of course they're
[3:29:41.120 --> 3:29:43.200]  called the Lucius Trust.
[3:29:43.200 --> 3:29:51.960]  Tell us about Lucius Trust and phone calls straight ahead.
[3:29:51.960 --> 3:29:55.680]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.680 --> 3:30:02.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:02.000 --> 3:30:05.320]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[3:30:05.320 --> 3:30:09.160]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[3:30:09.160 --> 3:30:13.600]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[3:30:13.600 --> 3:30:18.080]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[3:30:18.080 --> 3:30:23.240]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity
[3:30:23.240 --> 3:30:24.240]  for free.
[3:30:24.240 --> 3:30:27.920]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[3:30:27.920 --> 3:30:32.640]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[3:30:32.640 --> 3:30:37.120]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer
[3:30:37.120 --> 3:30:39.240]  through painful power outages again.
[3:30:39.240 --> 3:30:41.680]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[3:30:41.680 --> 3:30:47.560]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to MySolarBackup.com and
[3:30:47.560 --> 3:30:49.440]  get off the grid today.
[3:30:49.440 --> 3:30:56.040]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[3:30:56.040 --> 3:31:00.040]  877-327-0365.
[3:31:00.040 --> 3:31:01.040]  Don't wait.
[3:31:01.040 --> 3:31:02.040]  Call today.
[3:31:02.040 --> 3:31:07.520]  A big idea, a new world order.
[3:31:07.520 --> 3:31:10.840]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:31:10.840 --> 3:31:16.840]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[3:31:16.840 --> 3:31:20.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:31:20.000 --> 3:31:25.920]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[3:31:25.920 --> 3:31:28.040]  of humanity is at hand.
[3:31:28.040 --> 3:31:35.800]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:31:35.800 --> 3:31:39.680]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:31:39.680 --> 3:31:42.320]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:31:42.320 --> 3:31:44.120]  Most people have no idea they're not after money.
[3:31:44.120 --> 3:31:45.480]  They have all the money they need.
[3:31:45.480 --> 3:31:46.480]  They're after power.
[3:31:46.480 --> 3:31:47.480]  That's their after-easy.

[3:31:56.120 --> 3:31:57.120]  Blue prep for global enslavement.
[3:31:57.120 --> 3:31:58.120]  You have been warned.
[3:31:58.120 --> 3:32:06.640]  Hi, it's MZ, wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[3:32:06.640 --> 3:32:10.320]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[3:32:10.320 --> 3:32:16.360]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[3:32:16.360 --> 3:32:18.640]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[3:32:18.640 --> 3:32:23.160]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[3:32:23.160 --> 3:32:26.320]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[3:32:26.320 --> 3:32:34.480]  You can find out all about it and order it online at nogerms.info, that's nogerms.info.
[3:32:34.480 --> 3:32:39.360]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well
[3:32:39.360 --> 3:32:43.040]  when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[3:32:43.040 --> 3:32:48.800]  Don't pick your nose, don't shake hands, and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[3:32:48.800 --> 3:32:53.920]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[3:32:53.920 --> 3:32:57.840]  Go to nogerms.info, that's nogerms.info.
[3:32:57.840 --> 3:33:00.320]  Be well and stay well, best MZ.
[3:33:00.320 --> 3:33:13.520]  I harp on eugenics every day, how could you talk about anything else, we have a global
[3:33:13.520 --> 3:33:19.040]  government being set up openly for the stated purpose of exterminating us.
[3:33:19.040 --> 3:33:22.880]  They're testing different poisons and toxins in the food and vaccines, they're bragging
[3:33:22.880 --> 3:33:28.880]  about it, and the general public still only cares about football and is it racist to criticize
[3:33:28.880 --> 3:33:33.640]  Obama when he's just a blackface on their killing machine.
[3:33:33.640 --> 3:33:42.720]  I mean, I almost broke down and cried a week and a half ago, my kids are playing out in
[3:33:42.720 --> 3:33:46.720]  the front yard, in the neighbor's yard, in two different groups of neighborhood kids
[3:33:46.720 --> 3:33:51.640]  out of four groups, you know, four different groups of kids from different parents in the
[3:33:51.640 --> 3:33:56.560]  neighborhood, I know all their parents, were coming up showing me their flu shot bandages
[3:33:56.560 --> 3:34:04.080]  on their arms, and these are sweet little smart little kids, and I've known them for
[3:34:04.080 --> 3:34:07.440]  about a year and a half as we lived in this neighborhood, and I don't know if it was
[3:34:07.440 --> 3:34:13.360]  placebo mentally or whatever, but it was, they seemed like dumbed down and kind of
[3:34:13.360 --> 3:34:18.400]  look at my where I got a shot and one of them was kind of like he was drunk, and maybe
[3:34:18.400 --> 3:34:24.720]  it was something else that was making him act like that, but then they're over at my
[3:34:24.720 --> 3:34:30.120]  house playing in the backyard and one of their mother's calls and says, tell her son's name
[3:34:30.120 --> 3:34:34.640]  to come home in 20 minutes for dinner, and she goes, I go, how are you doing, how you've
[3:34:34.640 --> 3:34:38.840]  been doing to the lady three doors down, and she goes, oh, I'm good.
[3:34:38.840 --> 3:34:47.000]  I just got both, you know, both my kids flu shots today, and I just didn't even say anything
[3:34:47.000 --> 3:34:48.000]  to her.
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:52.960]  I know I was supposed to, but she was so proud of herself, and you know, once a mother's
[3:34:52.960 --> 3:34:56.440]  hurt their child, it's like a woman, once she's had an abortion, she rarely wants to
[3:34:56.440 --> 3:34:57.440]  say it was wrong.
[3:34:57.440 --> 3:34:58.440]  They get into it.
[3:34:58.440 --> 3:34:59.440]  Oh, it was right.
[3:34:59.440 --> 3:35:00.440]  It was good.
[3:35:00.440 --> 3:35:01.440]  It wasn't a human.
[3:35:01.440 --> 3:35:05.640]  Dr. Monteef, we're going to take some calls, what do you call that psychology and then get
[3:35:05.640 --> 3:35:10.400]  into the Lucius Trust, where once they've done something wrong or been wrong, they can
[3:35:10.400 --> 3:35:11.920]  never admit they're wrong?
[3:35:11.920 --> 3:35:18.840]  Well, you call it denial is the term, but the truth of the matter is, Alex, it is so hard
[3:35:18.840 --> 3:35:24.800]  to believe that the doctor who you know and you trust would give something to your child
[3:35:24.800 --> 3:35:28.760]  that would be harmful to them, but what you must understand, I don't know if you've ever
[3:35:28.760 --> 3:35:35.000]  seen the DVD or heard the talk put out by Dr. Pleylock, and I know you don't know Russell,
[3:35:35.000 --> 3:35:42.120]  but he has a talk on vaccine and brain development, pointing out that the vaccines actually stunt
[3:35:42.120 --> 3:35:43.120]  brain development.
[3:35:43.120 --> 3:35:47.440]  The younger they're given why, of course, the younger the child is, the more damaged
[3:35:47.440 --> 3:35:55.880]  they do, but every time you take a vaccine, why it triggers the immune response of the
[3:35:55.880 --> 3:36:01.360]  body, but the immune response of the brain, and that's why those children were a little
[3:36:01.360 --> 3:36:06.280]  groggy, they weren't quite themselves, they weren't thinking clearly, well, when you get
[3:36:06.280 --> 3:36:12.960]  the flu, you know, you're buying this sort of groggy, but of course, what the same thing
[3:36:12.960 --> 3:36:18.120]  happens when you take the vaccine, but you do this repeatedly and you produce chronic
[3:36:18.120 --> 3:36:24.520]  inflammation in the brain of an older person, and that's why somebody gets admitted, but
[3:36:24.520 --> 3:36:29.040]  you do this to the child and prevent the normal development of the brain of the child.
[3:36:29.040 --> 3:36:33.800]  This is criminal activity, and to give them, they want to give several of these vaccine
[3:36:33.800 --> 3:36:38.840]  shots at the same time, knowing that we'll do the maximum amount of damage that way.
[3:36:38.840 --> 3:36:43.760]  The average doctor has no idea, because they've never allowed to hear this information.
[3:36:43.760 --> 3:36:46.520]  That's why we need to educate your audience.
[3:36:46.520 --> 3:36:48.520]  They've got to get the doctor.
[3:36:48.520 --> 3:36:49.520]  Yeah, they're compartmentalized.
[3:36:49.520 --> 3:36:54.160]  We need to educate our city councils, our health departments, our police, our doctors.
[3:36:54.160 --> 3:36:55.160]  Most of them, they don't know.
[3:36:55.160 --> 3:37:00.400]  But I think that an awful lot of people at least have a suspicion of something's going
[3:37:00.400 --> 3:37:05.520]  on, and I think there's a growing awareness that there's something seriously wrong, and
[3:37:05.520 --> 3:37:10.640]  they have to understand that it is not simply the mercury in the vaccines, although this
[3:37:10.640 --> 3:37:14.600]  is toxic to the brain, it is the aluminum that is in the vaccines.
[3:37:14.600 --> 3:37:21.160]  Now, fortunately, as far as we know, they will have not going to have aluminum in the
[3:37:21.160 --> 3:37:28.480]  swine flu vaccine, but it is in the regular seasonal vaccine, and this, of course, aluminum
[3:37:28.480 --> 3:37:33.680]  is a toxic metal, and aluminum and mercury together are even more toxic, and then if
[3:37:33.680 --> 3:37:39.000]  you have fluoridated water, that's the one, two, three thing, and this is why so many
[3:37:39.000 --> 3:37:44.880]  even our college students when they graduate are totally incapable when they graduate from
[3:37:44.880 --> 3:37:45.880]  college.
[3:37:45.880 --> 3:37:46.880]  They can't think.
[3:37:46.880 --> 3:37:50.680]  I mean, this is what the globalists call for in their documents, is brain damaging everybody
[3:37:50.680 --> 3:37:55.760]  through the food, water, and vaccines, and so people say it's like the public's retarded.
[3:37:55.760 --> 3:38:02.240]  They are, and Dr. Blalock points that out that they have major studies that people that
[3:38:02.240 --> 3:38:09.360]  are 20 now on average have the memory of a 65-year-old, and literally, they're just
[3:38:09.360 --> 3:38:15.240]  going to turn it into a business, advertise it, and say it's normal to have an ADIQ, it's
[3:38:15.240 --> 3:38:23.320]  normal to drool, you know, geniuses won't have 140 IQ, they'll have 100, and if somebody
[3:38:23.320 --> 3:38:29.400]  can tie their shoelaces, they'll be a genius, and then the elite's just laughing, and I
[3:38:29.400 --> 3:38:33.600]  know there's brain damaged people listening right now, but even with a retarded child,
[3:38:33.600 --> 3:38:35.600]  you can get through to them and talk to them.
[3:38:35.600 --> 3:38:40.800]  To the police officers, you've been brain damaged, you've been brainwashed, the sodium
[3:38:40.800 --> 3:38:48.000]  fluoride isn't good for you, the vaccines aren't good, bad man giving you shot, bad,
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:55.640]  you know, bad system hurt your brain, brain is what you think with, it's in your, I'm
[3:38:55.640 --> 3:39:00.920]  not being sarcastic here, sometimes I think I should talk to the general public like that
[3:39:00.920 --> 3:39:05.120]  because I just, what do you, look, I want to take a few final calls here with you, Dr.
[3:39:05.120 --> 3:39:09.880]  Monteef, but one last question before we take a few of those quickly, the time we have left
[3:39:09.880 --> 3:39:13.520]  here, because I've got other news for listeners I'm going to hit when you appreciate your
[3:39:13.520 --> 3:39:14.520]  time.
[3:39:14.520 --> 3:39:18.920]  I don't play lock on several times in the last month, and he pointed out that mercury,
[3:39:18.920 --> 3:39:25.280]  aluminum, not just squaling, are adjuvants themselves and cause the autoimmune response
[3:39:25.280 --> 3:39:31.160]  and swelling, not just in the brain, but in other glands and organs, and that that's
[3:39:31.160 --> 3:39:36.560]  where most of the damage is coming from, not just the cancer viruses, not just the neurological
[3:39:36.560 --> 3:39:40.400]  damage of the mercury itself, what's your intel on that as a medical doctor?
[3:39:40.400 --> 3:39:45.520]  Well I think he's absolutely right, and remember what Bertrand Russell said in his book on
[3:39:45.520 --> 3:39:52.120]  page 53, the impact of science on society by diet, injections, and injunctions will
[3:39:52.120 --> 3:39:58.120]  alter the brain pattern of our children, that's exactly what it was about, he was one of the
[3:39:58.120 --> 3:40:02.880]  leaders, he made it all out, but we can't let the people know they're really our evil
[3:40:02.880 --> 3:40:05.560]  people who want to harm their children.
[3:40:05.560 --> 3:40:09.560]  Alright let's take a call, I'm going to give you calls quickly now, Chris and Marilyn
[3:40:09.560 --> 3:40:11.560]  you're on the air with Dr. Stan Monteef, go ahead.
[3:40:11.560 --> 3:40:15.240]  Hey doctor, it's an honor to talk to you.
[3:40:15.240 --> 3:40:20.600]  I was a combat lifesaver in the army years ago, and one of the things that we were taught
[3:40:20.600 --> 3:40:29.520]  is to give vaccines for the flu, and during the course the instructor had said, now these
[3:40:29.520 --> 3:40:36.240]  actual flu vaccines are from last year's strain, and I questioned him, I asked, why are we
[3:40:36.240 --> 3:40:41.920]  getting last year's strain, because of, if it's this year that we're living in, what
[3:40:41.920 --> 3:40:47.640]  good is last year's strain going to be, and it makes sense now with all these nanoparticles,
[3:40:47.640 --> 3:40:52.600]  these adjuvants such as mercury, the other stuff, you're not given the shot to take
[3:40:52.600 --> 3:40:55.520]  care of the flu, you're given it to be brain damaged.
[3:40:55.520 --> 3:41:01.480]  Exactly, and now I understand why I've got these medical disabilities such as, damn
[3:41:01.480 --> 3:41:10.760]  IBS, and autoimmune system infection where I'm, it's attacking my own body, makes perfect
[3:41:10.760 --> 3:41:11.760]  sense.
[3:41:11.760 --> 3:41:15.520]  And were you in during the Gulf War, during the first Gulf War?
[3:41:15.520 --> 3:41:16.520]  Unfortunately, yes.
[3:41:16.520 --> 3:41:21.000]  Well that's because that's when they used the experimental vaccine, so-called vaccine
[3:41:21.000 --> 3:41:29.520]  A with the squalene in it, and over, you know, almost 80,000 of the 690,000 true percent
[3:41:29.520 --> 3:41:33.640]  are dead already, and Chris, they're monitoring this very closely, they seem to have-
[3:41:33.640 --> 3:41:37.760]  Yeah, the army admits it was the squalene, you're lucky you're not dead, you're lucky,
[3:41:37.760 --> 3:41:42.720]  I mean the army admits, you've been soft killed, and I'm sorry they tried to murder you, just
[3:41:42.720 --> 3:41:46.200]  be glad you're not dead, and warn as many people as you can before they continue the
[3:41:46.200 --> 3:41:47.200]  murders.
[3:41:47.200 --> 3:41:52.080]  I just got out of the hospital because of it, and I had some bleeding, and the only
[3:41:52.080 --> 3:41:57.240]  good thing I got out of it was the morphing, but the only good thing that I got out of
[3:41:57.240 --> 3:41:58.240]  the hole-
[3:41:58.240 --> 3:42:02.120]  Well they hit you hard, and I'm sorry they didn't see, they hate you, as somebody that
[3:42:02.120 --> 3:42:05.720]  believes they're patriotic, they hate you, they hate their servants.
[3:42:05.720 --> 3:42:10.960]  Yeah, and this reminds me, the Christianity in this country is not the Christianity that
[3:42:10.960 --> 3:42:16.880]  Jesus taught back in his day, I know it, because the churches are teaching people to, you know,
[3:42:16.880 --> 3:42:20.920]  pray for your leaders, pray for your country, why would I want to pray for a country that
[3:42:20.920 --> 3:42:23.360]  wants to kill me for first, and second that-
[3:42:23.360 --> 3:42:29.280]  Well it's not your country, it's a criminal corporate group, look, if hijackers hijack
[3:42:29.280 --> 3:42:33.120]  a plane, does everybody bow down because they put the captain cap on?
[3:42:33.120 --> 3:42:38.520]  No, you know it's illegitimate, it's a hijacking, it's a global corporate takeover, they wrap
[3:42:38.520 --> 3:42:41.600]  themselves in the flag, and then carry out their operations.
[3:42:41.600 --> 3:42:43.880]  Dr. Montee, if you wanted to comment.
[3:42:43.880 --> 3:42:49.400]  I can't say it better than that, it is not our country, it is, our country has been taken
[3:42:49.400 --> 3:42:54.280]  over, we have an invisible government, we have an invisible government, which I call
[3:42:54.280 --> 3:42:59.600]  the brotherhood of darkness, people need to understand that, that they want to destroy
[3:42:59.600 --> 3:43:02.160]  the majority of the people in the world.
[3:43:02.160 --> 3:43:07.120]  And by the way, I know there are new military people who aren't veterans yet, a lot of police
[3:43:07.120 --> 3:43:12.000]  listening, most of you don't laugh, some do, go ahead, take all the shots, get diabetes
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:17.000]  when you're 35, let your kid get cancer when they're 10, and then you won't be laughing.
[3:43:17.000 --> 3:43:20.440]  This isn't a game, I'm not up here risking my life to tell you about this stuff, they've
[3:43:20.440 --> 3:43:21.440]  killed a lot of people.
[3:43:21.440 --> 3:43:26.640]  Dr. Montee, and I appreciate your call Chris, I'm sorry they did that to you, but Dr. Montee,
[3:43:26.640 --> 3:43:30.960]  I'm sure you saw the ABC News article from three or four months ago, with the headline
[3:43:30.960 --> 3:43:36.640]  that Merck quote sent out hit teams to doctors homes, and in court documents it came out
[3:43:36.640 --> 3:43:41.040]  that they said, oh, we've got to seek and destroy, take them out, hit them.
[3:43:41.040 --> 3:43:44.520]  One that criticizes our drugs and vaccines, and then when Merck got caught in federal
[3:43:44.520 --> 3:43:48.760]  court with these internal corporate documents, they said, oh, we just meant that as a joke
[3:43:48.760 --> 3:43:51.760]  saying hit teams.
[3:43:51.760 --> 3:43:57.640]  Well, this is nothing funny about what's going on, the number of people who've been killed,
[3:43:57.640 --> 3:44:05.360]  the number of children who have been destroyed forever, one in every 60 to 90 boys in the
[3:44:05.360 --> 3:44:10.760]  United States is autistic, and they did it on purpose, that's what's so uncomfortable.
[3:44:10.760 --> 3:44:15.400]  They call autism the range of brain damage caused from the chemical weapon and biological
[3:44:15.400 --> 3:44:16.400]  weapons in the vaccines.
[3:44:16.400 --> 3:44:17.400]  Right.
[3:44:17.400 --> 3:44:18.400]  Let's talk, go ahead.
[3:44:18.400 --> 3:44:23.280]  The thing is that basically probably every child has been injured to stomach, greater
[3:44:23.280 --> 3:44:24.280]  or less, than death.
[3:44:24.280 --> 3:44:29.440]  And now they're coming out with pharmacological crops that have the vaccines in them.
[3:44:29.440 --> 3:44:30.440]  Right.
[3:44:30.440 --> 3:44:36.720]  Oh, so they, the GMO foods, the disaster, that's why they're storing the seeds up above
[3:44:36.720 --> 3:44:42.800]  the Arctic Circle, so that they will have them there when they start in all over again.
[3:44:42.800 --> 3:44:45.280]  John in North Carolina, you're on the air worldwide.
[3:44:45.280 --> 3:44:46.280]  Thank you.
[3:44:46.280 --> 3:44:50.800]  I appreciate the opportunity, I know your time is short.
[3:44:50.800 --> 3:44:53.800]  Just a couple of things.
[3:44:53.800 --> 3:44:58.280]  We had black helicopters directly over our house just the day before yesterday, I was
[3:44:58.280 --> 3:44:59.800]  trying to get in with you.
[3:44:59.800 --> 3:45:01.400]  They were scanning you.
[3:45:01.400 --> 3:45:08.320]  Well, I mean, they were right over our house, looking in our windows, I mean, within a hundred
[3:45:08.320 --> 3:45:09.320]  feet.
[3:45:09.320 --> 3:45:10.320]  Yeah, they do that.
[3:45:10.320 --> 3:45:13.320]  Everybody gets those visits, it's all part of being a slave.
[3:45:13.320 --> 3:45:17.040]  The thing is, we have no criminal history at all.
[3:45:17.040 --> 3:45:20.640]  That's why if you were a criminal, they'd like you.
[3:45:20.640 --> 3:45:23.800]  They don't like producing good red-blooded Americans.
[3:45:23.800 --> 3:45:27.800]  The Mayak Report, Homeland Security says you are the enemy.
[3:45:27.800 --> 3:45:28.800]  Right.
[3:45:28.800 --> 3:45:31.160]  And they were, they were definitely showing that.
[3:45:31.160 --> 3:45:36.280]  I've been talking to people around here and showing them the 800 FEMA camps.
[3:45:36.280 --> 3:45:43.840]  And yesterday, I was at the Hurtford Chamber of Commerce and got the pandemic flu and you,
[3:45:43.840 --> 3:45:49.120]  which is to be given to the, this is a checklist for the employers.
[3:45:49.120 --> 3:45:53.480]  And right down in there, and I take, and I show this right along with the detention
[3:45:53.480 --> 3:46:04.160]  of, anyway, concentration camps under 1.2 plan for the, it says plan for the impact
[3:46:04.160 --> 3:46:07.560]  of a pandemic on your employees and customers.
[3:46:07.560 --> 3:46:13.560]  And it says, forecast and allow for employees' absence during a pandemic due to factors such
[3:46:13.560 --> 3:46:19.800]  as personal illness, family illness, and here's where it is, community containment measures
[3:46:19.800 --> 3:46:20.800]  and quarantine.
[3:46:20.800 --> 3:46:21.800]  Yeah.
[3:46:21.800 --> 3:46:23.240]  Send that to us.
[3:46:23.240 --> 3:46:25.400]  You've seen that in the news, but it's always good.
[3:46:25.400 --> 3:46:28.720]  Send it to writersandinfowars.com.
[3:46:28.720 --> 3:46:29.720]  God bless you, sir.
[3:46:29.720 --> 3:46:31.920]  I've got to move quick because we're almost out of time.
[3:46:31.920 --> 3:46:38.480]  But we just put up on screen, Vioxx maker, Merck and Co. Dr. Hitlist, an international
[3:46:38.480 --> 3:46:43.640]  drug company made a hit list of doctors who had to be neutralized or discredited because
[3:46:43.640 --> 3:46:49.200]  they criticized their anti-arthritis drug, the pharmacological giant produced.
[3:46:49.200 --> 3:46:54.760]  And it goes on to say, neutralize, neutralize, with seeking destroy teams, go to where they
[3:46:54.760 --> 3:46:59.440]  live, destroy them where they live, go to their homes.
[3:46:59.440 --> 3:47:00.440]  They mean business.
[3:47:00.440 --> 3:47:02.440]  This is a hardcore, savage group.
[3:47:02.440 --> 3:47:08.440]  And of course, what they do is they demonize them, they marginalize them, they get them
[3:47:08.440 --> 3:47:13.240]  in front of a group of doctors, and they laugh at them, and it takes a lot of courage
[3:47:13.240 --> 3:47:18.880]  to stand up against them and say, why are you doing things that are going to damage
[3:47:18.880 --> 3:47:19.880]  people?
[3:47:19.880 --> 3:47:24.960]  And as you said earlier, they have training manuals of how the head doctors call you in
[3:47:24.960 --> 3:47:25.960]  a group.
[3:47:25.960 --> 3:47:31.680]  They laugh, knowing the average fluoride head will laugh too, and again, it's all psychology,
[3:47:31.680 --> 3:47:32.680]  all dog training.
[3:47:32.680 --> 3:47:38.760]  Well, I tell you what, I was in the House of Delegates of the California Medical Society
[3:47:38.760 --> 3:47:39.760]  for 10 years.
[3:47:39.760 --> 3:47:45.440]  I finally brought the whole House of Delegates behind me, got a static ovation, and the first
[3:47:45.440 --> 3:47:50.560]  of the leaders of organized medicine still refused to address the AIDS epidemic and
[3:47:50.560 --> 3:47:52.800]  to stop the unnecessary deaths.
[3:47:52.800 --> 3:47:57.840]  We've killed over a half a million people in America unnecessarily.
[3:47:57.840 --> 3:48:02.160]  Another million are infected, and they're going to die, but people say, well, most of
[3:48:02.160 --> 3:48:03.160]  them are black.
[3:48:03.160 --> 3:48:04.160]  That's not going to happen.
[3:48:04.160 --> 3:48:06.520]  Well, they're going to, they're just going to put a red ribbon on and go to a dinner
[3:48:06.520 --> 3:48:07.520]  and feel good.
[3:48:07.520 --> 3:48:08.520]  Right.
[3:48:08.520 --> 3:48:13.760]  So the globalists are also good at creating movements of charities around the black ops
[3:48:13.760 --> 3:48:17.480]  they're running to then act like they're the saviors while they do it.
[3:48:17.480 --> 3:48:18.480]  It's so sick.
[3:48:18.480 --> 3:48:19.480]  I know it really is.
[3:48:19.480 --> 3:48:25.800]  I mean, but one day Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and Farrakhan are going to have to stand before
[3:48:25.800 --> 3:48:29.680]  the Lord and answer what they've done as a betrayal of the black people.
[3:48:29.680 --> 3:48:30.680]  I hear you.
[3:48:30.680 --> 3:48:33.680]  We're going to have you back up soon about the whole HIV situation.
[3:48:33.680 --> 3:48:38.160]  John, is it John in North Carolina next, or is it Steve?
[3:48:38.160 --> 3:48:40.960]  Stephen in Texas, you're on the air with Dr. Stan Monteef.
[3:48:40.960 --> 3:48:41.960]  Yeah.
[3:48:41.960 --> 3:48:44.560]  Hi, Dr. Monteef, good to talk to you.
[3:48:44.560 --> 3:48:48.960]  As a Bible-believing Christian, I'm sure you've heard of Jonathan Edwards, who preached the
[3:48:48.960 --> 3:48:53.160]  most well-known sermon in American history, centers in the hands of an angry God.
[3:48:53.160 --> 3:48:58.720]  I don't know if you're aware of how he died, but in, and this relates to vaccines and I
[3:48:58.720 --> 3:49:03.320]  have something else I want to bring up if you have time, but in 1758, he was given the
[3:49:03.320 --> 3:49:07.080]  smallpox vaccine and that's what killed him.
[3:49:07.080 --> 3:49:14.960]  Well, we had Jonathan Edwards back again because he led the Great Awakening in 1730 that saved
[3:49:14.960 --> 3:49:15.960]  America.
[3:49:15.960 --> 3:49:21.080]  Well, what we need is a great revival today, short of that, I don't think we have any possibility
[3:49:21.080 --> 3:49:22.080]  of survival.
[3:49:22.080 --> 3:49:26.600]  And the other thing I wanted to ask is, have you ever heard of a book called Horrors of
[3:49:26.600 --> 3:49:29.600]  Vaccination Exposed and Illustrated that was published in 1928?
[3:49:29.600 --> 3:49:33.120]  Yeah, I've got a copy right here by right hand.
[3:49:33.120 --> 3:49:38.840]  Yeah, and I had sent a copy of that to Alex, but I just wanted to give you real quick some
[3:49:38.840 --> 3:49:41.480]  quotes right at the beginning, it's a real short.
[3:49:41.480 --> 3:49:49.880]  Dr. James J. Garth Wilkinson in 1876 said this, this amazing act is the homicidal insanity
[3:49:49.880 --> 3:49:51.520]  of a whole profession.
[3:49:51.520 --> 3:49:54.000]  This is blood assassination.
[3:49:54.000 --> 3:49:58.200]  And then another one, vaccination is not always a harmless procedure, it must be looked
[3:49:58.200 --> 3:50:04.920]  upon as the production of an acute infectious disease, Dr. Milton J. Russel, 1914.
[3:50:04.920 --> 3:50:07.760]  And then finally, this is the kicker.
[3:50:07.760 --> 3:50:13.320]  Vaccination is a delusion, it's penal enforcement, a crime, Professor Alfred Russell Wallace
[3:50:13.320 --> 3:50:15.520]  in the wonderful century, 1899.
[3:50:15.520 --> 3:50:17.360]  Yeah, let me stop you.
[3:50:17.360 --> 3:50:23.040]  For those that don't know, vaccination is over 300 years old, and I did get the PDF.
[3:50:23.040 --> 3:50:24.360]  We need to get a link to that up on the site.
[3:50:24.360 --> 3:50:26.320]  We have limited personnel and just can't do everything.
[3:50:26.320 --> 3:50:31.280]  I'm trying to finish a film today, it has to be done, follow the Republic, but I appreciate
[3:50:31.280 --> 3:50:32.280]  your call.
[3:50:32.280 --> 3:50:36.320]  That's why everybody else should start radio shows, websites, get the word out.
[3:50:36.320 --> 3:50:41.680]  RadioLiberty.com, great books, videos, materials at RadioLiberty.com, Dr. Monteef, thank you
[3:50:41.680 --> 3:50:43.520]  so much for spending time with us today.
[3:50:43.520 --> 3:50:46.440]  It's always a pleasure, God bless you, Alex, bye-bye.
[3:50:46.440 --> 3:50:47.440]  Thank you.
[3:50:47.440 --> 3:50:50.640]  Straight ahead, more key news on the economy as we wrap up this transmission.
[3:50:50.640 --> 3:50:56.200]  I'll have to spend more time tomorrow on the overall true takeover of America.
[3:50:56.200 --> 3:50:57.640]  Stay with us.
[3:50:57.640 --> 3:51:05.600]  Hello, friends, this is Alex Jones here to tell you about Calben Soap.
[3:51:05.600 --> 3:51:10.280]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Calben
[3:51:10.280 --> 3:51:15.800]  Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.

[3:51:19.720 --> 3:51:21.960]  They have been a long-time sponsor of ours.

[3:51:25.840 --> 3:51:27.940]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[3:51:27.940 --> 3:51:32.280]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calben Pure
[3:51:32.280 --> 3:51:33.280]  Soap products.
[3:51:33.280 --> 3:51:38.320]  Check out their whole line of bath, hair, laundry, and dish soap and more at 5starsoap.com.

[3:51:42.560 --> 3:51:43.560]  anywhere.
[3:51:43.560 --> 3:51:45.000]  Don't take my word for it.

[3:51:52.920 --> 3:51:57.320]  Again, go to 5starsoap.com and just try their products.
[3:51:57.320 --> 3:51:58.320]  You're going to love them.
[3:51:58.320 --> 3:52:02.040]  You will never use anything else again.
[3:52:02.040 --> 3:52:07.640]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero
[3:52:07.640 --> 3:52:11.200]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[3:52:11.200 --> 3:52:16.480]  This rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[3:52:16.480 --> 3:52:18.040]  to tell their story.
[3:52:18.040 --> 3:52:27.080]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:52:27.080 --> 3:52:31.840]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[3:52:31.840 --> 3:52:34.120]  take action against their global masters.
[3:52:34.120 --> 3:52:37.240]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[3:52:37.240 --> 3:52:43.080]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:52:43.080 --> 3:52:46.560]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[3:52:46.560 --> 3:52:52.400]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order
[3:52:52.400 --> 3:52:53.900]  the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:52:53.900 --> 3:52:58.760]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[3:52:58.760 --> 3:53:01.800]  and bring in martial law.
[3:53:01.800 --> 3:53:05.160]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[3:53:05.160 --> 3:53:09.040]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[3:53:09.040 --> 3:53:13.520]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[3:53:13.520 --> 3:53:18.040]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[3:53:18.040 --> 3:53:23.240]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity
[3:53:23.240 --> 3:53:24.240]  for free.
[3:53:24.240 --> 3:53:27.840]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[3:53:27.840 --> 3:53:32.440]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[3:53:32.440 --> 3:53:36.760]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer
[3:53:36.760 --> 3:53:38.880]  through painful power outages again.
[3:53:38.880 --> 3:53:41.280]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[3:53:41.280 --> 3:53:47.200]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and
[3:53:47.200 --> 3:53:49.120]  get off the grid today.
[3:53:49.120 --> 3:53:59.600]  That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365 877-327-0365.
[3:53:59.600 --> 3:54:00.600]  Don't wait.
[3:54:00.600 --> 3:54:11.680]  The preacher man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River, she's a gold drive.
[3:54:11.680 --> 3:54:20.600]  The interest is up and the stock market's down and you're only getting mugged if you
[3:54:20.600 --> 3:54:21.600]  go downtown.
[3:54:21.600 --> 3:54:39.000]  All right, we have Alex Jones on vacation and joined the beach and I am Ted Anderson
[3:54:39.000 --> 3:54:43.200]  in case you're wondering if you don't already recognize my voice.
[3:54:43.200 --> 3:54:44.200]  Alex called me up today.
[3:54:44.200 --> 3:54:48.200]  He says, man, he says you've got to let these people know what's going on in the gold market.
[3:54:48.200 --> 3:54:49.960]  Everything's so hot.
[3:54:49.960 --> 3:54:50.960]  And he's right, man.
[3:54:50.960 --> 3:54:56.200]  I just can't believe what I'm seeing and watching the economy just sort of melt down
[3:54:56.200 --> 3:54:58.720]  in front of my eyes.
[3:54:58.720 --> 3:55:02.160]  You know, Alex and I have been talking about this on air.
[3:55:02.160 --> 3:55:07.840]  I've been in the gold market for 30 years and I've always known that because of the
[3:55:07.840 --> 3:55:14.360]  fact that we have a deficit-based currency, the way that money comes into supply is by
[3:55:14.360 --> 3:55:19.360]  debt, that there's a flaw in the system and it's by design that it's going to destroy
[3:55:19.360 --> 3:55:24.880]  our economy and send us into a world-type economy and that'll be destroyed as well.
[3:55:24.880 --> 3:55:30.640]  You just simply cannot expect to take on more debt and not have the compounding interest
[3:55:30.640 --> 3:55:36.080]  to consume you and that's what's going on with the United States of America right now
[3:55:36.080 --> 3:55:38.680]  and it's just sad to watch it happen.
[3:55:38.680 --> 3:55:43.680]  But on the other side of it, we've been talking to people about buying gold for years and
[3:55:43.680 --> 3:55:47.800]  years and years and most everybody that has picked up gold other than the people that
[3:55:47.800 --> 3:55:54.560]  have just picked it up recently are up three, four even in some cases, 500% in their gold
[3:55:54.560 --> 3:56:00.040]  and silver positions and I just need to say that that is just so wonderful and the very
[3:56:00.040 --> 3:56:05.440]  fact that they bought that gold and silver from us is the reason why you have the opportunity
[3:56:05.440 --> 3:56:10.840]  today to listen to the Alex Jones show ironically enough so the people that were supported the
[3:56:10.840 --> 3:56:15.600]  show by buying the gold and silver are now able to laugh their way to the bank while
[3:56:15.600 --> 3:56:22.400]  all the yuppies and the government institutions and the globalists are watching the whole
[3:56:22.400 --> 3:56:28.760]  thing melt apart and thinking that they're getting their teeth into the citizens by stripping
[3:56:28.760 --> 3:56:32.800]  away their wealth, the people that are listening to this show and taking advantage of the gold
[3:56:32.800 --> 3:56:39.000]  and silver offers are now looking at four, five, 600%, I suppose 500% is realistic just
[3:56:39.000 --> 3:56:43.800]  because we're looking at $3 silver and right now silver is almost $18, I guess you could
[3:56:43.800 --> 3:56:54.200]  say 600% but it has been a really long and fruitful ride I must say but the bad side
[3:56:54.200 --> 3:57:01.040]  of it is that the United States of America has got to take the hit and it just bothers
[3:57:01.040 --> 3:57:06.480]  me to no end now knowing that I've got grandchildren that will have to live through this and Alex
[3:57:06.480 --> 3:57:12.960]  has kids that it's just you know darn well that things in the future is not bright and
[3:57:12.960 --> 3:57:17.960]  we need to fight and we need to fight for our liberty more than ever before.
[3:57:17.960 --> 3:57:22.760]  So you know I guess one of the best ways to get started is pick up that last video of
[3:57:22.760 --> 3:57:28.280]  Alex Jones's and start making copies, get it out there, I mean it explains the monetary
[3:57:28.280 --> 3:57:33.480]  system better than anything that I can think of out there and it's a motivator, a lot of
[3:57:33.480 --> 3:57:39.160]  really highfalutin people that are making some really solid points on that and you know
[3:57:39.160 --> 3:57:44.920]  if you can just somehow educate the people enough of them to stand up and actually fight
[3:57:44.920 --> 3:57:51.320]  will actually get our liberty back and get back to constitutional and the rule of law.
[3:57:51.320 --> 3:57:57.200]  But anyways what's going on in the gold market today, gold jumped up to 1,053 today, right
[3:57:57.200 --> 3:58:03.240]  now it's trading at about 1,050, we have some of the older $10 gold pieces and the silver
[3:58:03.240 --> 3:58:11.680]  of walking liberty has to let the lower price and I would call us at 1-800-686-2237 again
[3:58:11.680 --> 3:58:17.520]  1-800-686-2237 and take advantage of those specials.
[3:58:17.520 --> 3:58:22.760]  And another thing that you might want to remember right now if you go to infowars.com this show
[3:58:22.760 --> 3:58:27.680]  right now, this one that's ending will be starting again and you can pick up on what

[3:58:52.360 --> 3:58:56.960]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions, if you're going into a battle and
[3:58:56.960 --> 3:59:00.680]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?

[3:59:19.320 --> 3:59:23.680]  you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized, you wipe
[3:59:23.680 --> 3:59:27.160]  out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
