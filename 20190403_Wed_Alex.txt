[00:00.000 --> 00:22.000]  we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance it's alex jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:52.200]  info wars tomorrow's news today crashing through the lies and disinformation it's
[00:52.200 --> 01:11.680]  alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war it's wednesday april
[01:11.680 --> 01:18.800]  third 2019 i'm your host alex jones and you can really mark your calendar april third
[01:18.800 --> 01:28.720]  2019 is a date where you can really say the united states is in the latter stages of collapse
[01:28.720 --> 01:33.880]  now trump's been trying to shore up the cell boat before it capsizes this is an valiant
[01:33.880 --> 01:39.200]  job overall and globalism itself is in deep trouble because it never delivered on what
[01:39.200 --> 01:44.080]  it said it would do was designed to collapse third world countries and consolidate control
[01:44.080 --> 01:48.600]  and then it was designed to collapse first world nations so globalism is being rejected
[01:48.600 --> 01:55.280]  as a system but it's byproduct or it's venom is killing us the third world is completely
[01:55.280 --> 02:01.120]  collapsing almost everywhere it's being directed as a weapon by stay behind groups of globalists
[02:01.120 --> 02:06.520]  against the nation states and we've got the headlines here if you're not paying attention
[02:06.520 --> 02:12.840]  the world ending storm of a third world war is gathering in venezuela russians chinese
[02:12.840 --> 02:21.520]  the u.s venezuelan storm border as columbia warns russia looks like scenes of the u.s
[02:21.520 --> 02:30.360]  being overrun and now they're banning opposition leaders in venezuela continuing shock video
[02:30.360 --> 02:41.360]  migrants drag screaming children under water through constantina wire to enter the united
[02:41.360 --> 02:50.560]  states illegally this is the hell and these people are supposedly heroes taking their
[02:50.560 --> 02:55.760]  children through hundreds of miles of desert to do this to get the welfare and bankrupt
[02:55.760 --> 03:02.520]  the country and remember the little girl that got drug in the united states over a hundred
[03:02.520 --> 03:07.040]  miles she hadn't eaten in a day she was taken with her mother to a facility for food and
[03:07.040 --> 03:11.120]  water and of course america was bad for saving her and trump was bad for saving her and they
[03:11.120 --> 03:18.160]  photoshopped the president holding you know the little girl hostage basically none of
[03:18.160 --> 03:25.840]  it was true well that's the same paradigm that we see over and over and over again now
[03:25.840 --> 03:29.120]  because we're the bad guys because we're taking care of all these people and they're being
[03:29.120 --> 03:34.480]  turned into political enemies against this nation remember that mother brought her daughter
[03:34.480 --> 03:40.400]  hundreds of miles over 150 miles over that border into that border in the dead of night
[03:40.400 --> 03:46.240]  that it was america's fault when we saved her we were the bad ones this country better
[03:46.240 --> 03:52.560]  get itself together so yes globalism's in deep trouble but it's aftermath and the storm
[03:52.560 --> 03:57.000]  it was planning to take down nation states is still taking place kind of like a sun blows
[03:57.000 --> 04:04.720]  up in a supernova the sun is gone globalism's in deep trouble falling apart but the shock
[04:04.720 --> 04:12.640]  wave of its implosion and its ongoing operations even though it itself is basically gone it's
[04:12.640 --> 04:20.000]  still has armies and still has systems and still has repercussions like what you see
[04:20.000 --> 04:26.800]  ripples in a pond going out so this is one incredible time to be alive right now total
[04:26.800 --> 04:32.720]  maximum red alert the democrats and the globalists are scrambling for power they believe them
[04:32.720 --> 04:37.120]  they might be able to hold on to nation states and then use the crises to get even more power
[04:37.920 --> 04:41.680]  they don't they won't have their big grand global government just yet but they could still
[04:42.480 --> 04:47.280]  still have their way with some gun owners some christians and some conservatives you ask why
[04:47.280 --> 04:50.880]  because they want to mount your head on the wall because they know you're better than them
[04:52.160 --> 04:56.400]  these globalists that run our government they are the scum of the earth their instinct is evil and
[04:56.400 --> 05:04.560]  lies infowarstore.com is how you support us and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need

[06:28.800 --> 06:35.600]  thank you for joining us ladies and gentlemen on this live wednesday april third 2019 global
[06:35.600 --> 06:39.360]  transmission mike adams is going to be hosted the fourth hour and we're going to have open
[06:39.360 --> 06:43.760]  phones like we did yesterday but i intend to go to your calls a lot earlier i'm sorry i didn't get
[06:43.760 --> 06:50.320]  to a lot of you guys uh at the end of the hour but i had an emergency that i had to take care of
[06:50.320 --> 06:56.320]  that came up so i went to rebroadcast for 15 minutes uh before paul joseph watson took over
[06:56.320 --> 07:02.080]  live so those folks that were unable to get on air you'll be first to the line today if you let
[07:02.080 --> 07:08.080]  the folks answering the phones know that but the big theme i want to discuss today and i'd like
[07:08.080 --> 07:12.240]  the callers to call in about and at least give me your view on then you can segue into a second
[07:12.240 --> 07:19.920]  point if you'd like the police humor me is the fact that what you see happening in venezuela has
[07:19.920 --> 07:28.000]  all of the trimmings and all of the fixings all the ingredients and then some for how you see a new
[07:28.000 --> 07:35.200]  world war start now many historians and analysts are saying if you're not paying attention to the
[07:35.200 --> 07:40.160]  world ending storm of third world war that's gathering in venezuela you're crazy
[07:42.640 --> 07:48.720]  but i agree with the cia when they call the cold war world war three this is world war four
[07:48.720 --> 07:54.800]  it's giant migrant waves it's economic war it's authoritarianism and then it's gathering armies
[07:54.800 --> 08:03.760]  cyber war and then physical war venezuela has for now several years around a thousand people a day
[08:03.760 --> 08:08.960]  die of starvation the government passed a law a few years ago making it illegal to call it that
[08:09.840 --> 08:14.400]  the average venezuela in the last year has lost 20 what was it 27 pounds
[08:14.400 --> 08:25.360]  you're not seeing any fat people there uh any more and brazil and columbia have put up fences and
[08:25.360 --> 08:31.680]  troops because everyone's fleeing and when you get it was five million the last year now they say
[08:31.680 --> 08:37.760]  it's five million this month so it's total collapse power's been off gases out electricity's down most
[08:37.760 --> 08:45.120]  the time starvation murdered death and now they're breaking over the borders and there are russian
[08:45.120 --> 08:52.000]  and chinese troops uh there that are reportedly involved and so this is the real unraveling
[08:52.000 --> 08:58.480]  of a country now russia and china are there because it's strategic doorstep to the u.s in northern
[08:58.480 --> 09:04.160]  south america they also have more oil than any other country per capita per square mile even
[09:04.160 --> 09:10.160]  more than salt arabia probably a five times the oil texas has and so it's quite the plum
[09:11.280 --> 09:15.200]  and things are degenerating very very quickly
[09:19.680 --> 09:28.000]  now why is that so important because if you look at a map of northern south america then you see the
[09:28.000 --> 09:37.600]  little isthmus there a Panama up into southern north america mexico it's not very far from venezuela
[09:38.800 --> 09:46.960]  up into mexico and the united states and so the other countries brazil columbia others are not
[09:46.960 --> 09:53.440]  letting the illegal alien stop or stay there they deport them they ship them out immediately because
[09:53.440 --> 09:59.200]  if people hear their safe harbor in costa rica it'll go from being a really nice place to a hell
[09:59.200 --> 10:05.680]  hole and already Guatemala is a hell hole so people are moving north from one hell hole to another
[10:05.680 --> 10:15.840]  to get to el norte so this is all unfolding right now and you have the un setting up the
[10:15.840 --> 10:24.240]  refugee centers through the few countries in northern south america into central america
[10:24.240 --> 10:31.760]  so that the giant throngs now in the hundreds of thousands per month can leapfrog their way
[10:32.960 --> 10:37.600]  through columbia as venezuela tries to completely break the columbian border which is happening now
[10:37.600 --> 10:47.200]  into Panama into costa rica into nicaragua into Honduras into Guatemala and then into mexico
[10:49.600 --> 10:57.840]  that is a publicly planned un funded obama funded state department soros financed operation one
[10:58.560 --> 11:04.160]  trillion percent and that is how they intend to take down america now you're looking at footage
[11:04.160 --> 11:12.160]  you're a tv viewer from back in october november december now the caravans are double that size
[11:13.840 --> 11:20.080]  last friday the border patrol issued a total red alert ssl and said the border is broken
[11:21.600 --> 11:29.440]  previous records were three thousand a day they were stopping in places like el paso
[11:29.440 --> 11:38.880]  now it is 15 000 a day and beto is saying there is no border come on up everything's free you deserve
[11:38.880 --> 11:46.240]  it they're encouraging lowering the drawbridge meanwhile i've got stacks of articles of democratic
[11:46.240 --> 11:52.480]  party leaders saying towards ramos and others there is no border you can't stop it it's gone
[11:53.840 --> 11:58.480]  now remember this is successful when we're in a depression in six months a year or two
[11:58.480 --> 12:02.880]  depending on the timetable and you're living in hell and there's burning cities and riots
[12:02.880 --> 12:12.960]  you just remember who did it this is such an incredible time to be alive nobody likes illegal
[12:12.960 --> 12:17.280]  immigration oh yeah right nobody so let's do something about it let's legalize the first
[12:17.280 --> 12:23.040]  10.7 million undocumented immigrants that are already here second yeah the thing is legalized
[12:23.040 --> 12:28.320]  at all illegal and realistic immigration system that works this won't be solved with a useless wall
[12:29.120 --> 12:31.760]  and then he's got other quotes saying you can't stop it
[12:34.880 --> 12:40.640]  so this is where our country is right now this is what we've become this is what it's turned into
[12:41.280 --> 12:49.040]  george ramos amnesty free legals migrants nothing we can do to stop them get rid of it
[12:49.040 --> 12:56.400]  get rid of the walls just open up everything hey dude it's so great down there mr ramos you're so
[12:56.400 --> 13:02.560]  busy pissing on america and bitching and complaining every 10 seconds why don't you just hoppy scotch
[13:02.560 --> 13:08.720]  on down to venezuela because brazil to the south of venezuela and columbia to the west
[13:09.760 --> 13:16.400]  are prosperous compared to venezuela and they have put up giant fences and armed troops and
[13:16.400 --> 13:22.880]  they're now forcefully shipping people back in and now the venezuelan trips are showing up and saying
[13:22.880 --> 13:28.560]  no you're not you're gonna take these people if you're a radio listener you can go to info

[21:47.440 --> 21:52.080]  bingo the asylum system has been overwhelmed the courts have been overwhelmed the emergency
[21:52.080 --> 21:56.640]  center has been overwhelmed democratic party vehicles are waiting many of them hardcore
[21:56.640 --> 22:02.720]  pedophile groups and the families and children and unaccompanied children disappear they've been
[22:02.720 --> 22:08.640]  taken to democratic party members homes who then don't work but go file for them to get social
[22:08.640 --> 22:14.960]  security file for them to get medicare medicaid to get all the different food stamps and then
[22:15.600 --> 22:22.080]  on average the each democrat family has three people living with them and then they collect
[22:22.080 --> 22:29.840]  up to 15 000 per month of taxpayer money they are then given how to vote in the names of dead people
[22:29.840 --> 22:35.440]  and they rule texas is being conquered as we speak they say we'll be blue by the next election
[22:35.440 --> 22:39.920]  probably if not after that one and the average conservative just drives around a big truck
[22:39.920 --> 22:46.960]  going up tough yeah boy doing absolutely nothing and then they're going to socialize
[22:46.960 --> 22:52.000]  and the country will collapse and that's just how it works and there'll be nowhere to run
[22:52.000 --> 23:00.560]  nowhere to hide from the giant third world collapse now taking place all orchestrated
[23:00.560 --> 23:04.640]  by the globalists yes their systems rejected yes it's in trouble but we're not arresting
[23:04.640 --> 23:09.760]  the leaders of globalism we're not cutting the un funding that's funding the refugee centers that
[23:09.760 --> 23:14.240]  stage the groups to come in tropas cut the funding to the central american countries
[23:14.240 --> 23:20.080]  that are aiding and abetting this uh brazil and columbia have put their militaries on alert
[23:20.080 --> 23:24.320]  they've got big fences up they're trying to block the people coming into their country
[23:25.440 --> 23:34.160]  and russian and chinese troops are massing inside venezuela in case the united states tries to stop
[23:34.160 --> 23:39.360]  this operation and so here's the thing i don't want troops on the border with russia and i don't
[23:39.360 --> 23:44.160]  want provocations but one of the u.s was staging a third world collapse let's say out of the middle
[23:44.160 --> 23:51.040]  east and opened up a conduit up into georgia and was shipping in 10 million illegal aliens muslims
[23:52.080 --> 23:55.840]  and had domestic groups within russia saying you've got to let them in you got to let them in
[23:57.040 --> 24:02.240]  russia would have a reason to go to war with us now russia's not been behind orchestrating all
[24:02.240 --> 24:06.240]  this but they're jumping on the bandwagon and aiding and abetting it china has been orchestrating
[24:06.240 --> 24:12.080]  it through our media in our systems they're both there like the five armies war wanting to get smogs
[24:12.080 --> 24:19.760]  treasure almost as much oil as you've gotten saudi arabia there in venezuela and so that's
[24:19.760 --> 24:26.560]  why you've got all these buzzards circling but this is taking us to the edge of war the videos
[24:26.560 --> 24:31.280]  are dramatic the photos are shocking some of them we can't even air because we're on broadcast
[24:31.280 --> 24:39.600]  television but venezuela battle war is on and even the new york times admits it is hell on earth
[24:39.600 --> 24:47.200]  mass death carnage burn offerings venezuelan officials blocked the border with columbia
[24:47.200 --> 24:51.520]  and a bid to keep out of military supplies remember all that well now it's spilling over
[24:51.520 --> 24:58.640]  in to columbia itself as they try to flee and there have been huge giant events today
[24:58.640 --> 25:03.600]  as all of this unfolds and the democrats in this country the leader of the democratic party
[25:03.600 --> 25:13.680]  george ramos he says just get used to it there's nothing you can do it will happen
[25:14.400 --> 25:19.360]  this is the way it is now nothing you can do to stop it is the exact quote
[25:22.640 --> 25:31.840]  so from all corners of south america all three socialist countries that are in south america
[25:31.840 --> 25:37.440]  are collapsing the others are stabilizing they're all overwhelming like lifeboats that cut the
[25:37.440 --> 25:44.000]  countries around them and then flooding via un leapfrog refugee centers towards us again
[25:45.280 --> 25:48.160]  the hundreds of thousands of different caravans that slammed into us
[25:49.440 --> 25:55.680]  last year are nothing compared to what is now already slamming in the caravans are hitting
[25:55.680 --> 26:06.560]  daily 15 000 a day per overwhelmed border sector in the three most overwhelmed sectors that's 45 000
[26:06.560 --> 26:14.320]  people a day in just three of the most active sectors that they're catching we are hemorrhaging
[26:14.320 --> 26:19.680]  out right now and the democrats are there's nothing you can do it's all over
[26:19.680 --> 26:30.160]  and beto is there is no border crisis there's nothing you can do come on up let's do it together
[26:32.880 --> 26:38.080]  and it's criminals and it's poor people and it's people with diseases and who the hell knows they
[26:38.080 --> 26:43.520]  are who the hell knows who they are but doesn't matter because the democrats are going to suck
[26:43.520 --> 26:51.760]  them as a permanent underclass into a giant vacuum cleaner that will be a permanent underclass that
[26:51.760 --> 26:59.360]  they control and that they skim the welfare money off of and who they use as the decisive voting
[26:59.360 --> 27:06.960]  block to break this country's back once and for all so what does the president do he doesn't just
[27:06.960 --> 27:12.640]  declare the emergency over law enforcement they could circumvent that in congress as commander
[27:12.640 --> 27:18.080]  in chief his jobs protect the border if he declares a full emergency as commander in chief
[27:19.040 --> 27:26.080]  a full real national emergency not what his lawyer is tricking to do this baby one and he orders
[27:26.960 --> 27:30.880]  a couple hundred thousand troops down to that border and he pulls them out of afghanistan he
[27:30.880 --> 27:38.160]  pulls some out of these other areas like korea and puts it where we need it on our border it needs
[27:38.160 --> 27:43.600]  to be done now and i guarantee you they get the army core engineers to drop what they're doing
[27:44.240 --> 27:47.760]  and to get down there they can build and block because you got to keep them out
[27:49.200 --> 27:54.880]  because the way the laws are written once they get here bingo you get everything free and there's
[27:54.880 --> 28:01.040]  no immigration judges anymore they're now backlog six years you're done everything's free 900

[32:15.040 --> 32:21.200]  in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good
[32:21.200 --> 32:25.680]  but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[32:25.680 --> 32:31.760]  deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due to
[32:31.760 --> 32:36.640]  the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep earth
[32:36.640 --> 32:42.560]  crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining
[32:42.560 --> 32:49.520]  it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it supercharges it and makes it even
[32:49.520 --> 32:55.440]  more bioavailable ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an incredible

[33:17.680 --> 33:23.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[33:23.760 --> 33:35.360]  you want answers well so does he live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[33:39.520 --> 33:47.200]  ladies and gentlemen mark your calendar you can officially say that april 3rd 2019 is the day that
[33:47.200 --> 33:55.680]  the us border was officially collapsed and not because of the valiant work of the border patrol
[33:56.480 --> 34:00.800]  not because of the hard work of president trump or our military or you trying to get the word out
[34:00.800 --> 34:09.200]  but it's official the border patrol head came out last friday and said we are in a red alert
[34:09.200 --> 34:18.080]  crisis the border has collapsed we have 15 000 people a day slamming that we're catching our
[34:18.080 --> 34:24.560]  beds only hold 5 000 in these sectors it's over they don't have men they don't have food they
[34:24.560 --> 34:31.120]  don't have water the democrats have buses lined up in vans and they are loading them and taking
[34:31.120 --> 34:39.600]  them god knows where people say well just arrest them oh yeah what does one cop do with 500 people
[34:39.600 --> 34:43.120]  what are you going to do if you have a party at your house and you're trying to put a party on
[34:43.120 --> 34:47.280]  for 20 people and you're cooking the hamburgers and you're getting the cocoa coal out and you're
[34:47.280 --> 34:51.040]  telling people where the channel changer is to watch the game you can't run a party with one
[34:51.040 --> 35:00.720]  person that's a party with chips and dip this ain't your nfl party baby this is the collapse
[35:00.720 --> 35:08.800]  of the united states this is football stadiums of people slamming the border every day
[35:10.880 --> 35:17.600]  i'ma say that again they're catching football stadium groups and then just saying okay at
[35:17.600 --> 35:22.560]  least organize here and they try to feed the little kids that are sick most of the time
[35:23.680 --> 35:28.800]  and sometimes there'll be a man with four kids or a weird kind of kids are crying for mommy and
[35:28.800 --> 35:34.720]  mommy ain't there and the board patrol is freaking out and being demoralized they were very positive
[35:34.720 --> 35:40.880]  about trump they were very excited but then the globalist onslaught hit that they were planning
[35:42.720 --> 35:47.440]  and so now the board patrol is so depressed knowing they're turning children over to smugglers
[35:49.360 --> 35:55.680]  that's what jack posobic asked george reymos amnesty for illegal migrants nothing we can
[35:55.680 --> 36:02.160]  do to stop them i don't support child trafficking cartels frank do you and the senate report
[36:04.160 --> 36:07.920]  even the washington post has been in last year thousands of children went into trafficking
[36:07.920 --> 36:12.880]  and disappeared under obama having them loaded on buses it was obama created the incentive
[36:13.760 --> 36:19.760]  it was obama said you get here you're quote a child we let you in that meant tab a child with you
[36:19.760 --> 36:26.080]  like a homeless person always has some starving dog so they can get more money at the side of the
[36:26.080 --> 36:32.160]  of the sidewalk i pulled in the other day to a little corner restaurant to eat some lunch i
[36:32.160 --> 36:38.000]  was working up here on saturday and i was while i sat there about an hour doing business on my
[36:38.000 --> 36:44.160]  phone and eating i took my time i watched two different corners run by some pimp there's a pimp
[36:44.160 --> 36:49.120]  over it and the women would come over and both of them had little dogs and they'd slap the dog
[36:49.120 --> 36:53.920]  if it did anything and i haven't videotaped some of it then she'd sit there and give him the money
[36:53.920 --> 36:58.320]  and then she'd get in the car and obviously smoke some crack or whatever it's her payment
[36:58.320 --> 37:04.720]  because a woman gets more than a man and a woman with a dog it was bingo bingo bingo it was like a
[37:04.720 --> 37:12.160]  cash machine at the corner over by the office there's a shanty town under the road feces some
[37:12.160 --> 37:17.840]  piles of feces just drip off now and just run onto the street there's just urine everywhere
[37:17.840 --> 37:22.640]  every day i drive to work i get to turn into the underpass and drive by and just see the feces
[37:22.640 --> 37:31.280]  everywhere those are the real homeless people just big piles of stinking newspapers and sleeping
[37:31.280 --> 37:37.200]  bags and they're all just like schizophrenics whacked out of their brain five or six of them
[37:37.200 --> 37:42.320]  sleeping just one little pile but then you've got the more professionals and they're out there with
[37:42.320 --> 37:47.600]  their little dog and they've got the woman out there and then she goes over and gives him the
[37:47.600 --> 37:52.080]  pile of money and she's whacked out of her brain to the only planet she's on he gives her a little
[37:52.080 --> 37:55.520]  something and she runs around and gets in the back of the car you can tell what she's doing then
[37:56.160 --> 38:03.200]  10 minutes later she gets out and bow bows to him and then he just goes get and then she runs back
[38:03.200 --> 38:09.600]  over a couple hundred yards about a hundred yards to the street corner and his people just
[38:09.600 --> 38:15.760]  cash machine or just cash cash cash almost every car cash cash cash cash cash cash because she's got
[38:15.760 --> 38:23.360]  the dog it's the same thing we have the children open the gates ah in fact that even happening
[38:23.360 --> 38:29.120]  Guatemala is that men would run for with a baby to the riot police going ah using with
[38:29.120 --> 38:36.000]  child as a human shield and the Mexican police would stand down and that's what we've become
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.240]  that's who we are meanwhile the democrats want to kill every damn baby they can before they're born
[38:40.240 --> 38:45.200]  and they're anti christian and they're demoralizing this country and they know exactly
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.560]  what they've done in a big big way let's roll some of this footage again for tv viewers
[38:51.120 --> 38:56.400]  shock video migrants drag screaming children you mean illegal alien invaders underwater
[38:56.400 --> 39:02.240]  through constantino wire to enter the us illegally first they taught us not to call them illegal
[39:03.840 --> 39:08.320]  then they taught us to you know just bow down if they have a child with them and and now we've
[39:08.320 --> 39:12.800]  just totally capitulated we've given up we've run the white flag up and trump couldn't get the funding
[39:12.800 --> 39:18.720]  he wanted you know he wanted 10 billion extra dollars for security and for the wall but he you
[39:18.720 --> 39:24.720]  know what he didn't get that he got a billion three and now this is it it just encourages
[39:24.720 --> 39:29.760]  a mass stampede like you see black friday stampede where people get hurt or killed trying to get a
[39:29.760 --> 39:34.400]  washing machine or a playstation well this is worse than that it's just billions of people
[39:34.400 --> 39:39.600]  they want to come here there's a big un report 20 plus percent of the illegal aliens in the world
[39:39.600 --> 39:45.760]  live in the us that's out of six billion third world people 20 now live here we are the third
[39:45.760 --> 39:50.640]  world we are falling apart we are bankrupting we are degenerating it's happening
[39:52.240 --> 39:56.560]  shock video migrants drag screaming children underwater through constantino wire to enter
[39:56.560 --> 40:01.600]  the us illegally but they got the little kid so it's okay disturbing video of illegal immigrants
[40:01.600 --> 40:07.760]  defying us border agents to push screaming children underwater through razor wire to american
[40:08.320 --> 40:13.120]  officers latest evidence of the chaos of the border democrats continue to ignore they're not
[40:13.120 --> 40:20.560]  ignoring it american mirror they said come on up they turned the red light on to screw america
[40:21.280 --> 40:25.760]  in one video illegal immigrants pulled young children under the border fence through large
[40:25.760 --> 40:30.880]  coils of constantino wire you can see kids faces are bleeding during a cold december morning in
[40:30.880 --> 40:35.840]  human arizona this video has been released this last year the video shows several adults crawling
[40:35.840 --> 40:41.360]  and hoisting about half a dozen youngsters little babies through a barbed wire barrier us border
[40:41.360 --> 40:47.200]  patrol urged them to reconsider as they repeatedly snagged their clothes on the wire the traumatic
[40:47.200 --> 40:55.520]  experience punctuated by blaring sirens and flashing police lights oh but they're not the
[40:55.520 --> 41:02.320]  bad people taking their kids through this or whoever's kids they kidnapped no no no we are
[41:02.320 --> 41:08.160]  and we are importing the worst of the worst from an already collapsed and dangerous as hell third
[41:08.160 --> 41:16.160]  world and when they get here they vote almost a hundred percent democrat party the ones that did
[41:16.160 --> 41:22.240]  this and engineered this and it is just a real shame how they use these poor people to do this
[41:22.240 --> 41:25.600]  all right we're going to go to break we're going to keep fighting but here's the bottom line
[41:26.320 --> 41:29.920]  i don't say this to be negative we've stabilized the country in some ways trump knew this was
[41:29.920 --> 41:35.440]  coming he was unable to get congressional funding to do it all we have to understand the democratic
[41:35.440 --> 41:40.400]  party are globalist seditious traders hell bent on overthrowing the nation and start regarding
[41:40.400 --> 41:44.880]  them as that and responding to them as that and they've got to be dealt with in the military
[41:44.880 --> 41:49.520]  and the government and the police and everybody else the general public have to recognize this
[41:49.520 --> 41:54.720]  country is collapsing and now if these latest waves that are twice the size they were last year
[41:54.720 --> 41:59.360]  three times bigger than anything we've ever been hit with there'll be 10 times this by 2020 you watch
[42:00.000 --> 42:05.600]  you watch it's going to be so hellish and so horrific and so out of control that you're going
[42:05.600 --> 42:10.640]  to have many cities burning with rioters just like venezuela just like columbia and just like
[42:10.640 --> 42:16.080]  brazil because again we have the videos today they are assaulting those borders too and what
[42:16.080 --> 42:23.280]  are they fleeing socialism communism but they're flooding back where the socialist and communists
[42:23.280 --> 42:28.560]  have gotten control again and are offering more freebies and these aren't mexican migrants coming
[42:28.560 --> 42:33.600]  in now no no no the mexicans have learned how to make money off of them and tax them as they come up
[42:33.600 --> 42:40.160]  these are people that are leaving communism leaving socialism to come up here and get the new big
[42:40.160 --> 42:47.120]  free deal that's it when i was out at the betel orc half the shirts and democratic socialism
[42:47.120 --> 42:52.560]  they're coming folks and they're going to vote your money your guns and your children away this is

[46:58.720 --> 47:16.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:29.360 --> 47:40.320]  so
[47:40.320 --> 47:49.920]  so
[47:55.840 --> 48:00.240]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live i'm alex jones your host and i intend to open the phones
[48:00.240 --> 48:04.800]  up in the second and third hour the entire time so get ready i'll be taking your phone calls i'll
[48:04.800 --> 48:11.520]  give the number out the start of the next hour i cannot stress to you enough how huge it is
[48:12.400 --> 48:20.560]  how insane it is how out of control it is that you've got the chinese the russians and others in
[48:20.560 --> 48:26.000]  venezuela trying to have some type of influence over who gets into power there to control that oil
[48:26.000 --> 48:34.240]  when the bigger issue is venezuela is being collapsed into central and north america with
[48:34.240 --> 48:43.680]  un centers built to flood us with the illegal alien hordes so i hope the pentagon and the
[48:43.680 --> 48:50.480]  president aren't distracted over the oil but i talked about this yesterday and then i never
[48:50.480 --> 48:55.040]  got to it because i wanted to basically spell it out properly and it's a very complex issue
[48:55.040 --> 49:03.120]  because i don't just endorse invasions or war lightly and i'm not even saying i fully endorse it
[49:03.120 --> 49:09.760]  but i think we're moving into that area where it's actually in our interest that needs to be done
[49:10.960 --> 49:17.280]  and not over the oil over the fact that the un runs venezuela and they are collapsing it
[49:17.280 --> 49:22.320]  to collapse the united states and that now the majority of people heading us are not even from
[49:22.320 --> 49:26.640]  central america they're from venezuela and columbia because some people are joining the venezuelans
[49:27.360 --> 49:34.880]  as they go through columbia some of the columbians are joining them so this crisis
[49:35.600 --> 49:39.760]  is spiraling out of control very very quickly and quite frankly
[49:42.960 --> 49:48.960]  i'm gonna air a few clips here that are i wanted to play anyways regardless and then i'm
[49:48.960 --> 49:54.720]  gonna try to focus my mind and give the analysis that needs to be given because i know not just
[49:54.720 --> 49:58.080]  the public listens but a lot of people in the government listen for whatever reason we've
[49:58.080 --> 50:02.160]  proven we've got a pretty good handle on things and i'm just going to try to put out to the public
[50:02.160 --> 50:05.280]  what other people are saying and doing and thinking because i guarantee you what you're
[50:05.280 --> 50:09.920]  going to hear from me is exactly what's being discussed by patriots that are in the pentagon
[50:10.480 --> 50:15.440]  and other areas of intelligence agencies you aren't globalist but this country is in such
[50:15.440 --> 50:20.320]  peril right now that i can't even believe it quite frankly and that's really the paradox is
[50:21.440 --> 50:27.840]  if you study times like world war two a lot of people didn't get out of austria or germany
[50:27.840 --> 50:33.200]  or czechoslovakia or poland or france when they had a chance to only when it was too late they
[50:33.200 --> 50:41.040]  try to get out and what i'm getting is people don't normally recognize historically how dangerous
[50:41.040 --> 50:48.800]  something is until it's already run them over and things are so bad things are good that we're
[50:48.800 --> 50:54.240]  waking up but things are so bad geopolitically and this country is under such globalist assault
[50:56.160 --> 51:02.640]  that the president has to act decisively and you can't just build a wall
[51:03.440 --> 51:08.240]  you have to stop the countries under you and control you have to stop the globalist influence
[51:08.240 --> 51:13.360]  countries like mexico and venezuela mexico guatemala and venezuela are the problems
[51:14.480 --> 51:21.040]  places like columbia and brazil are the solutions and columbia is already threatened to go to war
[51:21.040 --> 51:27.280]  with venezuela right now because they're being crapped on they're being overwhelmed they're
[51:27.280 --> 51:31.760]  being they're having their economy destroyed they're being invaded and when you get invaded
[51:31.760 --> 51:37.040]  by a government throwing its poor at you you you take that government out or you collapse
[51:37.040 --> 51:44.160]  we're the ones under attack columbia brazil the united states mexico says hey you do whatever you
[51:44.160 --> 51:49.120]  want as long as you go up north and piss on america and meanwhile the south american and central
[51:49.120 --> 51:54.880]  american gangs that are there now aren't following mexico's rules and you've got cartel wars everywhere
[51:54.880 --> 52:03.840]  so again central and south america and southern north america are descending into bedlam
[52:07.440 --> 52:12.960]  the border patrol has said red alert sos our border is collapsing it's gone
[52:14.400 --> 52:22.800]  that was the plan overwhelm the courts overwhelm border patrol and ice overwhelm law enforcement
[52:22.800 --> 52:28.400]  that's the ether in which socialists and globalists swim they're always in armored compounds with
[52:28.400 --> 52:32.480]  private security and out of this fall of civilization they gain control
[52:35.920 --> 52:43.040]  the democrats are saying we should have no border beto towards ramos all of them that's an enemy
[52:43.040 --> 52:48.880]  that says your country shouldn't have a border and come on up here and america sucks but they
[52:48.880 --> 52:55.520]  hate america that's who these globalists are and we have to stop lying to ourselves about how bad
[52:55.520 --> 53:02.240]  they are and how out of control they are and how incredibly evil they are
[53:07.280 --> 53:13.280]  we have to face up to nobody can beat the us with a bunch of planes and tanks and ships but they
[53:13.280 --> 53:18.880]  can beat us culturally and use our openness to infiltrate us and they can use our open society
[53:18.880 --> 53:23.920]  and how loving we are to pull on our heartstrings and they can use our 2200 mile southern border
[53:23.920 --> 53:32.000]  that is backed up against a chain of third world nations that run the gambit from bad to worse
[53:33.200 --> 53:36.320]  so you care about your kids you care about prosperity i don't care what color you are
[53:36.320 --> 53:43.120]  you better understand folks that the worst of south and central america are being literally
[53:43.120 --> 53:49.600]  crapped onto us right now children are being kidnapped and smuggled women are being kidnapped
[53:49.600 --> 53:54.320]  and smuggled in a gargantuan level and if we have a broken border folks will have a broken
[53:54.320 --> 53:59.600]  country and already most areas of south texas are becoming unlivable many areas of california
[53:59.600 --> 54:04.720]  are becoming unlivable many areas of arizona unlivable we are in collapse let's not lie about
[54:04.720 --> 54:09.040]  it we got a bunch of clips of that coming up in the next hour with your calls but i want you to
[54:09.040 --> 54:14.080]  understand something i'm not at liberty to get into this yet but i've learned with the democratic
[54:14.080 --> 54:19.120]  mafia the democrat mafia is doing to us to shut us down behind the scenes and their plans have
[54:19.120 --> 54:24.480]  fallen into our hands just as of late and when you come face to face with these people you don't
[54:24.480 --> 54:29.680]  have fear you only have concern that you're not going to do a good enough job stopping them we're

[1:00:31.440 --> 1:00:40.240]  beto the un puppet reinforces us downfall literally here it is the un funded by elements of our
[1:00:40.240 --> 1:00:46.400]  own government and stay behind groups putting power by hillary and obama help collapse europe
[1:00:46.400 --> 1:00:52.880]  with the help of the e u with over 10 million military age men the last seven years or europe
[1:00:52.880 --> 1:01:00.640]  is just wrecked 80 plus percent less terrorism crime rates off the charts just just bedlam
[1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:07.600]  thousands of cars burned per week hundreds per night mass stabbings sex slavery
[1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:21.760]  the third world of many areas is hell and we're in an existential threat crisis here and just as
[1:01:21.760 --> 1:01:27.440]  they ran the same operation with north african and middle easterners and others i guess europe in
[1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:33.520]  the last seven eight years the exact same people are running an attempt with not one but two caravans
[1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:40.080]  of over 40 000 now the government's saying 40 000 they were saying that was a thousand
[1:01:40.080 --> 1:01:47.920]  before and it was 50 000 and beto orork is there as a literal treasonous trader organizing it and
[1:01:47.920 --> 1:01:52.400]  bragging what it's happening people are coming across not being tested for diseases they've
[1:01:52.400 --> 1:01:58.000]  been caught smuggling children in mass this is insanity families including 40 000 children
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:04.160]  expected to enter the process this month we are doing everything we can to simply avoid a tragedy
[1:02:04.160 --> 1:02:09.840]  in a cvp facility but with these numbers with the types of illnesses we're seeing at the border i
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:14.880]  fear that it's just a matter of time but it's designed to bring the country down and you've got
[1:02:14.880 --> 1:02:20.400]  that backdrop with the deep state trying to overthrow trump all trump is doing is the basic
[1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:25.360]  default that anybody would do to keep the country from collapsing but it's not enough because the
[1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:33.040]  attack's been launched and trump can't get the laws of the funding to stop it and once
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.960]  they overwhelm the courts and once they overwhelm the detention facilities it's over
[1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:45.680]  you'll have 10 million people in the next year come in it was a million and a half illegals they
[1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:52.720]  know of last year probably four million they don't 10 million is now estimated will pour in this year
[1:02:52.720 --> 1:03:00.320]  10 million people tell you if it was under 1000 apprehensions the day before that was a relatively
[1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:05.440]  good number and if it was above 1000 it's a relatively bad number and i was going to be in
[1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:12.480]  a bad mood the whole day on tuesday there were 4 000 apprehensions i know that a thousand overwhelms
[1:03:12.480 --> 1:03:18.960]  the system i cannot begin to imagine what 4 000 a day looks like so we are truly in a crisis and
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:25.760]  there is a crime culture an ms-13 and a smuggling culture and all the lawlessness you see in latin
[1:03:25.760 --> 1:03:31.840]  america is now here and that's exactly what's happening here floods of crime floods of disease
[1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:40.560]  and the un funding and all to overwhelm the beds the democrats wanted in the latest

[1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:12.800]  into the us in about two weeks for being trucked up most of them almost all of military age men
[1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:17.040]  but the trader media will go show a few women that are in the crowd to pull on heartstrings
[1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:22.480]  when they collapse the courts and collapse law enforcement and the border it's over
[1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:30.320]  like europe it's broken 10 million in europe the last seven years almost all military age men

[1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:48.640]  combing the purges himself to congress who ran the fake russia gay garbage but who himself just
[1:22:48.640 --> 1:22:55.200]  wanted a home of power he'd been owned by the bushes and the clutons before him and
[1:22:57.120 --> 1:23:02.480]  he was just so incompetent and so weird and so double dealing that trump even tried to bring
[1:23:02.480 --> 1:23:06.320]  him in but he kept double dealing and trump of course knew he was leaking
[1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:12.320]  stuff to the press while he was lying about it i mean you think you have your own intelligence
[1:23:12.320 --> 1:23:20.880]  agencies jack you don't know who was watching you the whole time see people make me sick and
[1:23:25.280 --> 1:23:28.240]  he goes on christina i'm on poor show mrs billderberg
[1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:38.240]  he's got a nice wig she's wearing these days and she says shouldn't law enforcement stop
[1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:46.240]  people saying lock hillary clinton up i mean we push hillary for president we we we we made
[1:23:46.240 --> 1:23:51.200]  that popular somebody else coined it i saw it again on somebody's yard had a sign they put up
[1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:54.880]  it awesome i thought that's a good idea but whoever that guy is he coined it
[1:23:54.880 --> 1:24:01.600]  but we popularize that this audience did you're awesome we had airplanes flying around the country
[1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:10.320]  saying it and she's saying shouldn't we arrest them now think about the authoritarian instinct
[1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:16.080]  that she's on international television aiding and abetting other countries that are watching her
[1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:23.200]  on cnn in the us and cnn in canada and cnn in europe and the middle east and asia cnn's on all
[1:24:23.200 --> 1:24:30.560]  over the world people know not to believe it but still it's on force fed cia it is cia
[1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:37.520]  ben cia says ted turner set it up on military satellites and we cia we mean the establishment
[1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:43.360]  cia not defending the cia but it's always too broad to say the you know them the cia is like the
[1:24:43.360 --> 1:24:48.400]  biggest oldest modern intelligence agency army intelligence and naval intelligence precursors
[1:24:48.400 --> 1:24:54.880]  that of course and has never trusted the cia so it's governments within governments but you've
[1:24:54.880 --> 1:25:04.960]  got him up there being asked about arresting people talk about me talk about you that say lock her up
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:08.960]  because the rhetoric was effective it was true and now they know they're close to getting locked up
[1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:12.720]  for all the crimes they've committed the crimes he's committed so what she's really saying is
[1:25:12.720 --> 1:25:18.000]  isn't it time to move with law enforcement against people trying to stop you and your criminal activity
[1:25:20.800 --> 1:25:26.080]  he's like oh no no we have that right in america because he understands the climate now
[1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:30.480]  and he's trying to keep his head down with clapper and brennan and the other conspirators who know
[1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:35.920]  trump's got the goods on him and all i'm saying is mr president i don't mind have my ass hanging out
[1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:40.000]  here in the wind with the american people because we count on you but the damn borders just collapse
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:46.320]  the board patrol ran up an sos rattle hurt there's fire fights going on the brazilian
[1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:50.400]  venezuelan border and the columbian border they can hardly keep another five million people from
[1:25:50.400 --> 1:25:55.280]  storming our ass the democrats are running around and engage in open treason and if you sit there and
[1:25:55.280 --> 1:26:01.040]  you let them do it then you're aiding and abetting them and listen i don't know exactly what the move
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:07.760]  is to stop it i just know legally and lawfully through the executive and through the congress
[1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:11.440]  we have to act on this thing now because this is orchestrated by outside powers
[1:26:11.440 --> 1:26:17.040]  it's destroying the country in front of everybody's face and the stuff they're doing to me
[1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:22.560]  just shows it doesn't go oh i'm being attacked or lying about me they're doing dirty
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:26.560]  tricks and espionage they're doing stuff that's just over the top criminal
[1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:32.880]  it's that they don't even care if they get caught they've reached a wild cornered animal level
[1:26:32.880 --> 1:26:40.320]  and it's like you wake up and you're vacationing in colorado this has happened to people and you
[1:26:40.320 --> 1:26:47.520]  walk in at you know five a.m to make some coffee and there's a mountain lion sitting there on the
[1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:53.520]  counter eating the eating the ham you left out the night before now if you give it a chance to
[1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:59.040]  leave it'll go but what if it's rabid and what if it's got you in your kids corner and it's coming
[1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:03.600]  towards you with foam coming out its mouth i don't want to have this fight but i'm cornered by a
[1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:11.520]  rabid animal i'm cornered they're cornered and i'd back off these people except they're a bunch
[1:27:11.520 --> 1:27:16.320]  of perverts and weirdos obsessed with sexualizing our kids and they want to bankrupt everything and
[1:27:16.320 --> 1:27:23.840]  they're jealous of free market no no no no we've got to oppose these people there's no more games
[1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:28.160]  there's no more playing games trumps tried to keep the stock market up while he has confidence
[1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:34.160]  while he stops the un collapse the border we don't have any more time let me give the number
[1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:38.800]  out in a moment but here is comey with christina i'm on poor this is basically the mouth of the
[1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:46.240]  eu on singing and saying arrest the american people good one question because you just said
[1:27:46.240 --> 1:27:54.080]  locker up um or lock me up of course locker up was a feature of the 2016 um trump campaign do you
[1:27:54.080 --> 1:28:00.080]  in retrospect wish that people like yourself the head of the fb i i mean the people in charge of
[1:28:00.080 --> 1:28:06.080]  law and order had shut down that language that it was dangerous potentially that it could have
[1:28:06.080 --> 1:28:12.800]  created violence that it's kind of hate speech should that have been allowed that's not a role
[1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:17.520]  for government to play the beauty of this country is people can say what they want even if it's
[1:28:17.520 --> 1:28:23.200]  misleading and and it's demagoguery the people who should have shut it down were republicans
[1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:28.960]  who understand the rule of law and the values that they claim to stand for shame on them but it
[1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:33.200]  wasn't a role for government to play all right james when we come back we're going to analyze that

[1:33:33.040 --> 1:33:38.400]  sure it's gonna be have a negative impact on the economy it's one of the biggest trade deals in
[1:33:38.400 --> 1:33:46.720]  the world that we've just done with the usmca it's a very big trading partner but to me trading
[1:33:46.720 --> 1:33:52.080]  is very important the borders are very important but security is what is most important you have
[1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:59.280]  to have security this is what this gentleman is all about to my right and we're gonna have
[1:33:59.280 --> 1:34:04.480]  security in this country that's more important than trading hey all you hear me talking about
[1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:11.440]  is trade but let me just give you a little secret security is more important to me than trade so
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:17.040]  we're gonna have a strong border over and have a closed border and you know when we close that
[1:34:17.040 --> 1:34:23.280]  border we will stop hundreds of millions of dollars of drugs from coming in because tremendous
[1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:37.760]  amounts of drugs come through our southern border what's happening is the un model of
[1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:41.760]  collapsing your collapse of the us using third world populations this year the board patrol is
[1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:47.600]  officially overwhelmed it is three times any collapse level before the president has to be calm
[1:34:47.600 --> 1:34:54.000]  because he doesn't want to plunge the economy but he just signaled everybody if we don't control the
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:57.920]  border we don't have a nation anyways and so yes we've got to seal the border but that's gonna take
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:03.680]  hundred thousand troops you cannot let them get in and people are willing to drag babies
[1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:09.440]  through barbed wire to get in the law has to be changed now but the democrats have so beat
[1:35:09.440 --> 1:35:14.720]  people over the head that oh it's mean if you ship somebody back or it's mean they've got to have all
[1:35:14.720 --> 1:35:19.680]  these immigration hearings they're backed up six years ninety some percent of people look it up
[1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:27.120]  don't ever show up for the immigration hearing so a mother of three single mother she's working two
[1:35:27.120 --> 1:35:34.480]  jobs she does the laundry she cooks the meals she pays her bills legal alien hits her with no
[1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:39.360]  insurance what happens to her it's just true the legal aliens are above the law
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:46.000]  law and and and they're being used as a permanent underclass to undercut the whole system it's a
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:54.720]  plan walmart very predatory would tell workers this came out 10 years ago in their own manuals
[1:35:56.320 --> 1:36:03.360]  we only keep you part time so that you can you then are able to get food stamps and aid
[1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:06.400]  so here's how you go get food stamps and aid and here you can make more money
[1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:13.600]  so walmart uses government subsidy taxpayer money to undercut the whole market but notice
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:23.120]  walmart itself is now being displaced by amazon so this is a consolidation going on and when you
[1:36:23.120 --> 1:36:29.520]  bring in a giant third world low IQ population by the way the third world has smart people in it
[1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:35.200]  they're staying there they own things they run things we're taking the bottom the most desperate
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:41.280]  the most criminal the most diseased the most mentally ill the most unskilled into our country
[1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:49.680]  what does that do they go all the Statue of Liberty Statue of Liberty was said here by the french
[1:36:50.880 --> 1:36:55.120]  they try to give to the egyptians they didn't want it it's a cult it's a guy in drag look it up

[1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:07.280]  to six months to make sure you didn't have disease they don't check anything now they don't check
[1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:12.000]  you're not a human smuggler and i know you know that but that's the lawlessness next time you're
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:19.440]  going through an internal border patrol checkpoint i've said to him why do you want to ask him a
[1:37:19.440 --> 1:37:24.960]  citizen it wouldn't matter if i wasn't no yeah you're right why do you have checkpoints at the tsa
[1:37:25.680 --> 1:37:30.320]  to make sure jihadi doesn't blow us up you just let them in and protect them it's all a joke
[1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:35.440]  next time i'm trying to get into football game they want to want you well why would you do that i
[1:37:35.440 --> 1:37:40.560]  have a right to be in this football game for free like no no that's a private company a private thing
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:48.560]  you gotta well so is our country we paid for this we're being exploited our openness is being
[1:37:48.560 --> 1:37:55.680]  exploited and this country is being collapsed and i know everybody gets it so now i promise when we
[1:37:55.680 --> 1:38:01.360]  come back i'm going bam bam bam to your calls first up first around military police border patrol
[1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:04.960]  former border patrol i want to get your take on this if i'm wrong or am i right but they have the
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:10.160]  border patrol they all say it's collapsed red alert help us help us help us and drums like i'm gonna
[1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:15.760]  have to shut the border well he doesn't have the resources to do it we have to stop the democrats

[1:38:21.040 --> 1:38:26.640]  soros gives his own money to have these giant migrant centers uh in southern mexico and and
[1:38:27.600 --> 1:38:34.720]  all these other central american countries down to south america they have cover stories on roiders
[1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:39.840]  and about how great he is and now they give three thousand dollars to each person on their card that
[1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:44.240]  doesn't even have their name on it and they go hey george soros is behind it they go oh conspiracy
[1:38:44.240 --> 1:38:49.440]  there is fire loo dobs get rid of judicial watch they're lying they're not lying they're calling
[1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:58.400]  the elephant in the room and the average american still knows they're being lied to but not as bad as
[1:38:58.400 --> 1:39:05.440]  they imagine it's even worse i've had people high level make up outrageous lies about me
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:12.720]  and they tell people these lies and the folks i talked to cannot believe that the u.s senator or
[1:39:14.240 --> 1:39:17.520]  people like that would tell someone like this they would call and get involved
[1:39:17.520 --> 1:39:23.920]  in things i'm involved in and say you better not represent alex jones or you better you better get
[1:39:23.920 --> 1:39:28.240]  rid of his bank account or you better because he's under criminal investigation and we know he's a

[1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:43.200]  scent from a russian government on a uk any foreign government and look the fbi and all the system
[1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:50.640]  knows that they don't know what to do they have probed everything we do and they're all a bunch
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:54.480]  of followers at the top who got their jobs by other powerful people they're a bunch of brown
[1:39:54.480 --> 1:40:00.880]  nosers and they can't believe that info wars is shelf made that our listeners are real and that
[1:40:00.880 --> 1:40:06.880]  we're not funded by some other group i am so proud i'm not a part of an intelligence agency
[1:40:06.880 --> 1:40:14.080]  i'm so proud that i did what i did by god's help and your support and the democrats now
[1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:21.600]  are just in overdrive gear you know they call ice criminals and murderers and nazis and then
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:26.720]  there's a guy with both his legs blown off that has a fireman's cross on his elbow you know for
[1:40:26.720 --> 1:40:34.560]  the name of their uh unit in afghanistan anybody knows a fireman's cross and they call him a
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:39.440]  nazi and then they end up hiring the woman that did it to run a newspaper she gets rewarded for
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:50.720]  being a liar that's just what they do and now that new york fact checker under fire for mistaken
[1:40:50.720 --> 1:40:58.000]  ice workers tattoo for a nazi symbol it's a fireman symbol now she got promoted around a major
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:05.040]  publication tell the lady on the board at the new york timeshed whites aren't human they would you
[1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:10.560]  go right to the top lady that's who they are so here's the toll free number for law enforcement
[1:41:10.560 --> 1:41:14.160]  military former border patrol current people living right on the border we want to hear from you
[1:41:14.160 --> 1:41:18.480]  eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine the first round wait for those guys to call
[1:41:18.480 --> 1:41:22.400]  in then i'll give open phones to everybody eight seven seven seven eight nine alex eight seven seven
[1:41:23.040 --> 1:41:27.600]  seven eight nine two five three nine you don't even say your real name or whatever you say where
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:32.960]  you're calling from and we'll get you on air but hell they've got the head of the border patrol the
[1:41:32.960 --> 1:41:37.440]  deputy head so deputy had called us like six years ago down there to catch the illegal aliens they
[1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:41.520]  were ordering loaded on buses and the public's like well why was the border patrol helping them
[1:41:41.520 --> 1:41:45.280]  because they've been ordered to and there's so many of them they don't have a place to put them
[1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:50.400]  but they're the ones that called us to say do something i love how the public is too
[1:41:52.160 --> 1:41:56.160]  the border patrol actually signed up for this are in dangerous positions go through all this they're
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:01.120]  down there with the scorpions and the rattlesnakes and then the dead people and the dead bodies and
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:05.520]  people with the diseases and all that hell and then everybody's mad that they're busting them in
[1:42:05.520 --> 1:42:10.560]  and i get they should stand down but if they stand down then it totally collapses because the law
[1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:16.400]  hasn't been changed and trump is not a dictator but here's the thing when you're brought into a
[1:42:16.400 --> 1:42:21.680]  national crisis like this by traders it's not called martial law it's called survival so all i'm
[1:42:21.680 --> 1:42:26.080]  saying at this point is we got to really start making some serious decisions here as a country
[1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:30.160]  about if we're going to be run by these people because the democrats are a lawless group of lying
[1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:34.480]  crooks allied with the chai comms and they've been caught red-handed and they're scared and now
[1:42:34.480 --> 1:42:38.640]  they're going for broken they're dangerous so make no mistake this is the most critical time in our

[1:47:41.440 --> 1:47:45.680]  former and current active duty border patrol witnesses on the border that's who we're
[1:47:45.680 --> 1:47:49.760]  hoping the phone's up for 877-789-2539 let me just say this
[1:47:52.720 --> 1:47:58.240]  i've had old friends old journalists people that i've known people that i basically started
[1:47:58.240 --> 1:48:04.800]  their careers make cheap shots at me because if you make cheap shots on youtube they let you
[1:48:04.800 --> 1:48:08.240]  operate the only way you're allowed to talk about alex jones is if it's negative
[1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:16.720]  and they say oh my god alex jones supports martial law alex jones supports rex 84
[1:48:18.640 --> 1:48:23.680]  well there's an old saying and it's called you live you learn and and i learned
[1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:31.680]  how the leftists were lying about ronald reagan and it didn't mean that ronald reagan was perfect
[1:48:32.800 --> 1:48:36.480]  but since i learned about the weathermen and read some of the declassified files that only came
[1:48:36.480 --> 1:48:40.400]  out a few years ago and talked to the folks that infiltrated their groups like larry graphwald
[1:48:40.400 --> 1:48:47.360]  who was a great patriot i confirmed that there was a democrat plan to collapse mexico and central
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:54.400]  america into southern north america mexico and to bring in martial law through a migrant crisis
[1:48:55.040 --> 1:48:59.680]  and that the democrats would then activate migrant leaders trained in these un camps
[1:48:59.680 --> 1:49:07.120]  to burn down the us now that was in the 1980s and the left always attacked it and i would see it
[1:49:08.320 --> 1:49:14.640]  on pbs and things and go wow that is terrible that they planned martial law and oliver north got
[1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:20.320]  told to shut up or the senator said don't talk about it in the congressional hearing and all the
[1:49:20.320 --> 1:49:29.760]  rest of it and i was always rex 84 bad and then you pull back and they're running the exact op and
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:38.720]  you've got beto or orc and you've got jorge ramos saying it's over the country's gone there are no
[1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:44.080]  borders we're latin america and the un's running the refugee camps for the invasion it was about
[1:49:44.080 --> 1:49:50.640]  six months ago i went wait a minute remember i'm mr fema camp which obama wanted a national
[1:49:50.640 --> 1:49:55.920]  emergency and camps for conservatives hillary talked about it remember so so there's there's
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:00.960]  bad camps we want to process but if people hit you with 20 million people there's nowhere to keep
[1:50:00.960 --> 1:50:07.360]  them you got to keep them in a facility and ship them back or you're done so they've already overwhelmed
[1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:12.080]  the facilities and the judges and do process so they put you into martial law artificially
[1:50:12.080 --> 1:50:18.800]  and then reagan's plan was well that used military bases to hold up to 10 million people because that
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:26.800]  was the democrat plan originally created it you know cornell by bill ares who was obama's mentor
[1:50:26.800 --> 1:50:33.920]  you can't make this stuff up they did this to europe too just now the last 10 years so these dogs
[1:50:33.920 --> 1:50:39.360]  don't learn new tricks because these tricks work so reagan and the pentagon got ready and you better
[1:50:39.360 --> 1:50:46.960]  believe they got plans now but they're filled with sjw is at the command level and so i came on air
[1:50:46.960 --> 1:50:55.200]  with courage and said rex 84 was a good plan and i was calm by the left and man did people have a
[1:50:55.200 --> 1:51:04.560]  heyday with that mr anti fema camp now supports the fema camps i'm not for a fema camp or against
[1:51:04.560 --> 1:51:09.920]  a fema camp if an asteroid hits the atlantic ocean with the power of a thousand hydrogen bombs
[1:51:09.920 --> 1:51:13.520]  and we've got five years of nuclear winter and everybody's starving to death people are gonna
[1:51:13.520 --> 1:51:18.480]  be in emergency facilities most people are gonna die a camp is a camp like a gun as a gun or a
[1:51:18.480 --> 1:51:23.600]  truck as a truck the point is who's creating the crisis and why are they doing it if a bio weapon
[1:51:23.600 --> 1:51:27.920]  gets released you're gonna see this stuff happen that's why it's in place i didn't like it because
[1:51:27.920 --> 1:51:35.360]  i had emergency managers and people inside the military tell me that obama before that clinton
[1:51:35.360 --> 1:51:40.160]  was planning martial law and i got the documents and i used to be screaming and yelling at the
[1:51:40.160 --> 1:51:44.400]  fbi how they were all traitors until we'd be at an illegal army checkpoint the army didn't like
[1:51:44.400 --> 1:51:50.800]  what they were doing training to take guns from citizens on i-35 i'm like you scumbag fbi you
[1:51:50.800 --> 1:51:55.200]  filth you filthy military traitors to america all of a sudden they're like turn your camera off a
[1:51:55.200 --> 1:51:59.280]  minute here here's the documents we're on your side we don't like this either you're like uh
[1:51:59.280 --> 1:52:07.200]  uh oh all right the military and the police are more awake than anybody folks they don't like this
[1:52:07.200 --> 1:52:13.440]  crap and then the black lives matter and kill the cops movement starts up and they wanted to kill
[1:52:13.440 --> 1:52:18.080]  the cops to make them capitulate to the globalists so they would go along with the left taking
[1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:23.600]  control of law enforcement so they could then put conservatives in the fema camps the damn camps are
[1:52:23.600 --> 1:52:31.680]  there so i'm just saying you can let people shove their kids through constantino wire barbed wire
[1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:35.200]  and then get here by the millions and collapse the whole country or are we going to put them
[1:52:35.200 --> 1:52:39.040]  in facilities and ship their asses back but that's not even what i want then i'm going to go to your
[1:52:39.040 --> 1:52:46.400]  calls and i'm going to explain this very very very calm and very cooly we have to have a coalition
[1:52:46.400 --> 1:52:50.880]  with brazil and with columbia who are already about to go to war with venezuela it's already
[1:52:50.880 --> 1:52:55.920]  collapsed millions are flooding in every few months their countries there's fire fights you name it
[1:52:55.920 --> 1:53:02.880]  it's all over the news now down there to stabilize and maduro has to be removed the un isn't going
[1:53:02.880 --> 1:53:07.120]  to help they're behind it orchestrating the whole damn thing and we have to get them out and do it
[1:53:07.120 --> 1:53:12.160]  because they're running it as the base to collapse into the u.s in this program just like the un did
[1:53:12.160 --> 1:53:16.400]  the arab spring with obama to collapse the middle east into europe so i don't want to go down there
[1:53:16.400 --> 1:53:21.840]  for regime change like the other times and all the rest of it to get the damn oil we have to go down
[1:53:21.840 --> 1:53:26.880]  there to stabilize that country because it's in norther south america and is already falling into
[1:53:26.880 --> 1:53:31.760]  our country i don't trust the neocons and not sabotage to blame trump i don't even like the idea
[1:53:31.760 --> 1:53:37.520]  but it's way better than what we already have millions coming our way collapse border babies
[1:53:37.520 --> 1:53:42.400]  being shoved through barbed wire because their countries have collapsed we can't let the whole
[1:53:42.400 --> 1:53:48.880]  south collapse into bedlam and insanity and then engulf us with the democrats and our open society
[1:53:48.880 --> 1:53:56.560]  opening the door in a weatherman communist un plan from the 1970s it has to be stopped now
[1:54:00.160 --> 1:54:05.280]  and there you have it and of course the russians and the chinese are there the chinese already
[1:54:05.280 --> 1:54:09.040]  put in a social score there they're running the show the russians want their interest because
[1:54:09.040 --> 1:54:14.000]  they sold a bunch of weapons to them and gold and and a bunch of issues and and and i'm not a
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:18.720]  russophile if we were pumping into the russian border millions of people russia would have the
[1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:22.880]  right to go to war with us so i'm going to tell russia i'm against going to war with you i want
[1:54:22.880 --> 1:54:28.080]  you to be successful have your pipelines do what you want but i'm and fight the jihadis but get
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:35.520]  the hell out of there because i'm telling you i'm telling you the only move to make here pretty
[1:54:35.520 --> 1:54:39.760]  soon is to go in there and kill everybody and i'm talking about the military bases and the
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:46.240]  leadership of that damn government because that's the problem cut it off at the head cut off soros
[1:54:46.240 --> 1:54:50.080]  and the state department funding again you want to blame the russians our government's the number
[1:54:50.080 --> 1:54:55.040]  one funder of this that's it the rush is not the problem i'm saying russia better get the hell out
[1:54:55.040 --> 1:55:03.600]  of it and the chai comes it's time to bloody their nose maduro is a monster he's arresting all the
[1:55:03.600 --> 1:55:10.000]  political opposition he's a pig he's a criminal they have a thousand people dying a day down there
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:14.880]  from starvation you say well that's not our thing to get involved in i agree it was overseas
[1:55:14.880 --> 1:55:20.320]  it's on our border it's a chain reaction on our border and i'm not going to sit here and
[1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:25.360]  and like a wimp and play games with this whole thing because as i got older i learned the pieces
[1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:31.120]  of this whole puzzle and they're running their move on us this is the takedown of the country folks
[1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:35.760]  and we either act and overthrow the mexican president or we've got to invade
[1:55:36.400 --> 1:55:40.960]  that his country's totally lost in a joke and he's adding to it i've been to mexico the central
[1:55:40.960 --> 1:55:46.000]  american crime gangs are making mexico even worse right now he won't do a damn thing he's a globalist
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:51.120]  he's getting paid off and you know he ish and the venezuela is the problem mexican leadership
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:55.680]  and venezuela leadership are enemies of humanity and of everybody in latin america and they need
[1:55:55.680 --> 1:55:59.920]  to be dealt with and dealt with right now if anybody cares about civilization and that's the
[1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:06.000]  end of it all the games stop right here the real world's happening 15 000 people a day three times
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:11.920]  the previous record are hitting the three major border sectors that's just in el Paso 15 000 alone
[1:56:11.920 --> 1:56:18.880]  mccallen 15 000 alone that's that's 30 000 a day they're grabbing in texas they can't take care of
[1:56:18.880 --> 1:56:24.160]  them it can't be dealt with no one's there people say oh well just be humanitarian oh don't worry the
[1:56:24.160 --> 1:56:28.960]  democrats are taking them into their homes to be voters and to be a permanent underclass all right
[1:56:28.960 --> 1:56:34.720]  i'm gonna go to break and i swear i'm going to thomas and jim and john and and john and dan but
[1:56:34.720 --> 1:56:38.880]  i went ahead and said it i'm not ashamed of saying it i just want to say it right and get all my
[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:44.960]  points out there i feel really good about this i don't trust the globalist in our government to
[1:56:44.960 --> 1:56:50.320]  sabotage it and blame trump like maya pigs that's why they've got a sign on to it publicly there's
[1:56:50.320 --> 1:56:56.960]  got to be press conferences people say oh well you got to have a sneak attack no sneak attacks massive
[1:56:56.960 --> 1:57:03.600]  multi-month buildup so they know we're coming and they'll leave but if we wait much longer they're
[1:57:03.600 --> 1:57:08.720]  going to foment the domino collapse into our country and there's going to be stay behind
[1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:13.360]  networks down there they're going to have to be dealt with so this is big boy pants time for everybody
[1:57:13.360 --> 1:57:20.160]  out there this is big boy pants time we put the big boy pants on or we let the globalist collapse
[1:57:20.160 --> 1:57:25.120]  the whole hemisphere they've already collapsed europe their tourism is down 80 per cent paris
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:34.480]  is like an open-air islamic toilet and i just i'm not rolling over and the president doesn't want to

[1:58:57.680 --> 1:59:01.840]  tip of the spear of the zeitgeist that's why the globalists are obsessed with it trying to shut it
[1:59:01.840 --> 1:59:07.840]  down i didn't invent all this i went and researched the renaissance americana and what really works
[1:59:07.840 --> 1:59:12.720]  for humanity and i'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's super popular like
[1:59:12.720 --> 1:59:18.240]  it's always been that's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because

[2:00:15.440 --> 2:00:21.600]  central and south america giant waves are on their way programmed and brainwashed in
[2:00:21.600 --> 2:00:27.040]  reeducation camps called u n emergency centers we either stabilize the southern border
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:33.120]  crack down on the mexican leadership the venezuela leadership or we lose the country this is it
[2:00:33.120 --> 2:00:41.760]  make no mistake this is all defensive 100 percent you notice i didn't support regime change in
[2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:49.840]  syria didn't support it in iraq didn't support the whole ukrainian fiasco because the globalists
[2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:54.720]  started it and the globalists started this against our country and just like russia stood up to the
[2:00:54.720 --> 2:00:58.960]  destabilization of ukraine and they attempt to drive the russian population that's been there for
[2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:04.720]  500 years out we have to stand up now and just like putin put troops into western and eastern
[2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:09.520]  ukraine we have to put troops in right now because it's right down there south of us and we're
[2:01:09.520 --> 2:01:16.080]  already being hit by this it's it's it's our issue it's our sovereignty and it's being done by design
[2:01:16.080 --> 2:01:20.320]  21st century fifth generational warfare all right i'm going to shut up go to your calls
[2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:25.200]  thomas is active military we're going to go to him in just a moment we're going to talk to jim
[2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:30.240]  first-hand accounts of migrants crossing activity national guard migrant crisis fema camps a
[2:01:30.240 --> 2:01:34.640]  minister on the sleeping churches in china takeover retired police officer immigration
[2:01:34.640 --> 2:01:40.000]  family is border patrol citizen a migrant crisis has lived in mexico el paso worked at border patrol
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:45.680]  in california what trump needs to do let's go to jake in washington state first jake thanks for
[2:01:45.680 --> 2:01:50.160]  calling and holding thank you alex i just wanted to say i think the number one thing
[2:01:50.160 --> 2:01:54.560]  president trump could do is get the national highway transportation safety administration to
[2:01:54.560 --> 2:02:00.480]  track the number of dui deaths caused by illegal aliens they're given driver's license to everybody
[2:02:00.480 --> 2:02:05.280]  they don't know who's causing these deaths anymore and if you look at the cost of a two vehicle
[2:02:05.280 --> 2:02:10.560]  accident with multiple people killed additional people no i agree we should try the statistics
[2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:14.320]  we spend like 200 billion a year on illegals let me ask you this what about my point that we have
[2:02:14.320 --> 2:02:19.600]  to nip it at the bud cut the unfunding funding this i like trump just didn't cut in this the
[2:02:19.600 --> 2:02:24.720]  money of the central american countries and we've also got to cut the funding uh to you know to
[2:02:24.720 --> 2:02:29.920]  these other leftist groups and we're gonna have to go into venezuela uh i absolutely believe
[2:02:29.920 --> 2:02:35.280]  you've got to cut the funding to send the message that this is intolerable and the key thing is is
[2:02:35.280 --> 2:02:39.760]  the costs are hidden to the american public and you don't have to be an evil person to kill somebody
[2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:44.160]  as a drunk you can just be a guy who went to a party but then let's just say it the illegal
[2:02:44.160 --> 2:02:48.400]  aliens are above the law it comes out they just let them go and they run i'm not trying to act tough
[2:02:48.400 --> 2:02:53.840]  here calling for stopping mexico but when mexico lets people go through its country not stay there
[2:02:53.840 --> 2:02:59.440]  but attack us invade us we've got to do something and trump's talking about cutting funding that's
[2:02:59.440 --> 2:03:04.720]  not enough seal the border yes that'll put pressure on mexico but what about venezuela a fallen corrupt
[2:03:04.720 --> 2:03:08.720]  group now bringing foreign troops in i think the ultimate thing you could do is take the troops
[2:03:08.720 --> 2:03:14.240]  you'd put in venezuelan put them on the us border then the venezuelan carnage and mayhem will end
[2:03:14.240 --> 2:03:18.640]  up in mexico and mexico will realize this is intolerable i know but you understand that when
[2:03:18.640 --> 2:03:22.400]  the illegals crawl through the barbed wire holding babies up as human shields under law they get to
[2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:27.600]  stay here so the place to keep them is you stabilize venezuela who's got resources coming out the
[2:03:27.600 --> 2:03:32.640]  yin yang then that stops the whole that's where the whole u n thing is set up so so why would we
[2:03:32.640 --> 2:03:36.640]  sit there it's kind of like not bombing the north of vietnam oh we're not going to bomb the factors
[2:03:36.640 --> 2:03:41.440]  in the north because we've got some you know deal at the u n blow the hell out of the north
[2:03:41.440 --> 2:03:45.440]  so it's the same thing why are we having a war when the whole thing running and is just sitting
[2:03:45.440 --> 2:03:50.320]  there like you're a gift to this country from god but i just think we've been running internal
[2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:56.160]  checkpoints in the united states forever we ought to draw the line at our border no i agree with you
[2:03:56.160 --> 2:04:01.120]  if we've got internal checkpoints here's the thing the immigration judges won't we should
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:07.120]  look southwest airlines will fly somebody to central america for 500 bucks or south america
[2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:12.720]  for 600 i mean i say we start chartering southwest airlines planes with federal marshals on it
[2:04:12.720 --> 2:04:15.920]  handcuff these people throw their asses on the airplanes and take them there and dump them
[2:04:15.920 --> 2:04:20.640]  where they came from i mean because we've got to stop the giant damn breaking there's nothing
[2:04:20.640 --> 2:04:25.120]  against having some immigration but this is a tsunami i mean you you get the point i'm making
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:31.200]  right absolutely god bless you for your intensity alex this country needs it your vision is clear
[2:04:31.200 --> 2:04:37.840]  and your passion is so palpable it's just incredibly positive for this nation but you are jake you're
[2:04:37.840 --> 2:04:42.480]  more focused than i am and i'm not trying to sound radical here we're under radical attack so i have
[2:04:42.480 --> 2:04:47.920]  to go all in and call for what others won't call for i'm serious we needed an humanitarian emergency
[2:04:47.920 --> 2:04:53.040]  mission to venezuela they're under a damn dictator flooding us with giant masses of people what are
[2:04:53.040 --> 2:05:00.480]  we gonna do center and take it living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real
[2:05:00.480 --> 2:05:06.160]  drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water
[2:05:06.160 --> 2:05:12.480]  and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[2:05:13.120 --> 2:05:19.200]  and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of
[2:05:19.200 --> 2:05:26.160]  tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels
[2:05:26.160 --> 2:05:32.240]  of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity
[2:05:32.240 --> 2:05:38.720]  filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored
[2:05:38.720 --> 2:05:45.760]  to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of the water so what
[2:05:45.760 --> 2:05:52.480]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly
[2:05:52.480 --> 2:06:01.760]  a good water filtration system will purify it big brother mainstream media government coverups
[2:06:01.760 --> 2:06:17.680]  you want to stop tyranny will so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex joe
[2:06:24.720 --> 2:06:29.840]  alex jones here back live president trump and a lot of speeches that russian troops
[2:06:29.840 --> 2:06:37.280]  need to leave chinese troops need to leave i had said stay out of venezuela even though it's a
[2:06:37.280 --> 2:06:45.280]  dictatorship but now they've organized the un camps the last three years into columbia
[2:06:46.320 --> 2:06:51.120]  to create a corridor because they're right there in northern south america central america is a
[2:06:51.120 --> 2:06:57.360]  very short little trick a few hundred miles you make that trek you get up to mexico and now they
[2:06:57.360 --> 2:07:04.400]  just let the people right through and i've been in mexico i have to have security now and i went
[2:07:04.400 --> 2:07:10.880]  through an internationally recognized group and got a federally well two different times and they
[2:07:10.880 --> 2:07:15.760]  sit there and show me the police feeds everything like oh no sir you don't want to be in cancun you
[2:07:15.760 --> 2:07:21.120]  want to be on another place uh look and they've shown me stuff that wasn't on the news in fact i've
[2:07:21.120 --> 2:07:24.560]  thought about getting one of the fellows on the air he's willing to even do it we're going to
[2:07:24.560 --> 2:07:30.160]  blur out his face and i was i had my own security down there on top of it obviously and they were
[2:07:30.160 --> 2:07:34.480]  just showing me everything and i even drove in a taxi to see it and there was the steakhouse
[2:07:34.480 --> 2:07:39.840]  that i'd eaten that a year before you know the clothes and everybody was robbed and in armored
[2:07:39.840 --> 2:07:45.200]  vehicles and marines getting killed at night inside their hotel rooms and americans getting
[2:07:45.200 --> 2:07:50.560]  kidnapped and killed and i mean multiple times a day and i was staying in another resort not in
[2:07:50.560 --> 2:07:57.600]  cancun but nearby that it doesn't have crime and i talked to the police and i talked to some of the
[2:07:57.600 --> 2:08:03.360]  folks because this gentleman was friends with the marines that were in in somewhat control of the area
[2:08:04.160 --> 2:08:08.960]  and he was talking to them and they were just like well if you want to come to cancun you can come
[2:08:08.960 --> 2:08:12.560]  ride one of our armored vehicles with us we'll take you to dinner but they said you know we just

[2:08:16.480 --> 2:08:21.680]  and there's troops all over the street when you land at the airport i mean i've been
[2:08:21.680 --> 2:08:25.360]  to third world countries i've been in war zones on the edge of war zones i've never seen anything
[2:08:25.360 --> 2:08:29.360]  like this i've been in hurricane zones with the militaries on the street and this is like
[2:08:29.360 --> 2:08:34.160]  the police and military like this i mean they've got their big heavy guns out armored vehicles
[2:08:34.160 --> 2:08:39.840]  motorcycles everywhere and they said oh it's all over mexico it's it's central america has invaded
[2:08:39.840 --> 2:08:46.560]  oh we hope trump can stop it and they were talking about even areas that they lived in in mexico that
[2:08:46.560 --> 2:08:52.240]  didn't even have bad crime are now really bad they're like oh if you thought el chopo was bad
[2:08:52.240 --> 2:08:58.320]  and if you thought the mexican cartels are bad they said these guatemalan and honduran groups they
[2:08:58.320 --> 2:09:04.560]  are so bad he said now we have the venezuelans here they don't care they don't care they'll give
[2:09:04.560 --> 2:09:10.560]  a key of cocaine to a 15 year old kid in a machine gun and say you're in charge of this area go shoot
[2:09:10.560 --> 2:09:19.280]  everybody in that restaurant and the kid will go do it so mexico which is on the high end of third
[2:09:19.280 --> 2:09:22.880]  world countries you wouldn't think of that but wealth wise it's on the high end a lot of nice areas
[2:09:23.360 --> 2:09:29.200]  it is being overrun with central americans right now and now they go oh and now sir the south americans
[2:09:29.200 --> 2:09:36.560]  you think oh that's just the mexicans being elitist no mexico is like 10 times shaffer than venezuela
[2:09:37.440 --> 2:09:38.240]  or guatemala
[2:09:43.040 --> 2:09:48.400]  and what is trump going to do we're just going to sit here and let the whole thing collapse
[2:09:48.400 --> 2:09:52.640]  good seal the border cut off the mexican funding cut off all the central american funding he's
[2:09:52.640 --> 2:09:57.040]  starting to do it good thank god imagine if we had hillary during all this let's go back to your calls
[2:09:57.040 --> 2:10:01.680]  oh my gosh i forgot jim's in columbia i should have gone to him first thanks for holding
[2:10:01.680 --> 2:10:05.600]  first-hand accounts of migrants crossing jim what are you witnessing down there
[2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:10.560]  because obviously we put a map up to those who don't know you've got venezuela in eastern
[2:10:10.560 --> 2:10:16.000]  northern northeastern south america and they go right through and basically columbia as you
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:20.160]  know is threatened war right now over the fact that the venezuelan government's allowing this
[2:10:20.160 --> 2:10:28.880]  yes but i'm not so sure uh that columbia would actually go to war with venezuela
[2:10:29.920 --> 2:10:38.480]  that i i believe came from trump last week mentioning that president duque here in columbia
[2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:46.400]  had lied to him uh and said that he was going to cut down the flow of illegal drugs into america
[2:10:46.400 --> 2:10:53.760]  but it's actually increased uh that's my thought on that everything else everything you're saying
[2:10:53.760 --> 2:11:02.240]  you are spot on i'm in a place called bucker among a columbia i'm about six to seven hours uh from
[2:11:02.240 --> 2:11:09.200]  the border uh in distance i don't know how how far i am that you have to go up the mountain down
[2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:16.640]  the mountain it's just very difficult to travel uh i know people that live in the border town of
[2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:22.640]  cucata columbia and that's where you get the famous pictures that everybody in the united
[2:11:22.640 --> 2:11:31.280]  states are seeing uh with the where they're blocking those huge bridge freeways in between
[2:11:31.280 --> 2:11:39.680]  between venezuela and columbia um but people are still coming through there how they're getting
[2:11:39.680 --> 2:11:47.280]  through i don't know uh i i wouldn't put it past them just coming and walking around the barricades
[2:11:47.280 --> 2:11:57.200]  and just coming right over the bridge um i have met countless venezuelans here uh and around christmas
[2:11:57.200 --> 2:12:05.440]  um me and my wife were shopping in an area right close to bucker among us and there were a lot of
[2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:14.000]  venezuelans with satchels full gym bags actually full of the venezuelan bolivars uh their currency
[2:12:14.960 --> 2:12:20.000]  and i thought well i'm going to help these guys out and i gave them some columbian money
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:28.560]  and in exchange for the what i call communist money and it is communist money uh i took it
[2:12:28.560 --> 2:12:34.000]  home to my son let him get on the computer he thought he had a big stack of money for christmas
[2:12:34.880 --> 2:12:42.880]  and to teach him a lesson of how communism actually affects money and he was astounded
[2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:53.520]  he's 10 years old i've met women uh probably about five to eight women with children in another
[2:12:53.520 --> 2:12:58.160]  place close to here called florida blanca columbia and that's where these people are
[2:12:58.160 --> 2:13:04.720]  hubbing up and they're giving help what is happening is the men are going they're going on
[2:13:04.720 --> 2:13:11.280]  they're moving on towards the united states and me and my wife would try to give money
[2:13:11.280 --> 2:13:18.160]  to any of these people that we see on the streets with children and uh my wife is columbian
[2:13:19.040 --> 2:13:25.360]  and she speaks more fluent spanish than me but we've asked these ladies oh where are your
[2:13:25.360 --> 2:13:32.160]  husbands out well well they've went on they're they've gone on towards america and we're waiting
[2:13:32.160 --> 2:13:38.400]  because there's groups that will help us and then we're going to go later so we're trying to survive
[2:13:38.400 --> 2:13:43.360]  until they see oh that's all public it's the un it's all staged yeah what do you think trump
[2:13:43.360 --> 2:13:48.240]  should do because latin america is collapsing uh north africa is collapsing the middle east is
[2:13:48.240 --> 2:13:52.320]  collapsing we're talking about not 10 million but 50 million we're talking about the end
[2:13:52.320 --> 2:14:00.320]  of our civilization as we know it here uh you are exactly right i am a hands off uh
[2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:10.320]  uh conservative libertarian in this situation we have no choice we're either going to take
[2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:19.360]  care of the situation now it's probably going to have to be an invasion or a huge strong show of
[2:14:19.360 --> 2:14:28.240]  force out in the sea at the columbian border or the brazilian border or what hadn't uh if we don't
[2:14:28.240 --> 2:14:36.800]  do it now we're going to end up spending uh there's going to be more bloodshed more money spent if we
[2:14:36.800 --> 2:14:42.320]  don't correct the situation now well 20 million illegal aliens is bringing the us to its knees
[2:14:42.320 --> 2:14:45.760]  and driving down the wages and bankrupting everything imagine another 20 30 million and

[2:20:17.280 --> 2:20:22.960]  you know we're taking your phone calls on the fact that trump tried to stabilize the border
[2:20:22.960 --> 2:20:26.480]  he tried to get rational funding he tried to get lost change he's not a dictator
[2:20:27.280 --> 2:20:31.040]  and now the border patrol i've been on there 25 years and i've ever seen this talk
[2:20:31.040 --> 2:20:35.760]  we're under red alert we're getting three to four times the number we ever got
[2:20:35.760 --> 2:20:40.240]  we're having to let people go we don't want to do this this is super dangerous these are
[2:20:40.240 --> 2:20:45.760]  unaccompanied children red alert well just do your job handle it oh yeah you're one border patrol
[2:20:45.760 --> 2:20:52.560]  agent for on average 200 people oh yeah you're one guy you're gonna handle 200 people give me a break
[2:20:54.480 --> 2:20:59.280]  give me a break and it's this instant gratification and i'm not here to kiss the
[2:20:59.280 --> 2:21:07.440]  border patrol's ass but they got a rough job and i see the uh republican pundits like well
[2:21:07.440 --> 2:21:13.600]  trumps got record catch and release uh yeah because there's not beds there's not judges
[2:21:13.600 --> 2:21:17.440]  there's not infrastructure so we better push the president to get the troops on the border
[2:21:17.440 --> 2:21:22.080]  get that wall finished and put pressure on venezuela that is absolutely already collapsed
[2:21:22.960 --> 2:21:26.880]  you've got a collapsed country with how many people live in venezuela let's look that up
[2:21:26.880 --> 2:21:29.280]  and most of them are coming this way
[2:21:31.680 --> 2:21:34.560]  we're not just going to be paying for them they're going to be voting the names of dead people
[2:21:36.080 --> 2:21:37.280]  and most of them are communists
[2:21:39.680 --> 2:21:42.160]  there we have active duty military guys just hang up
[2:21:43.040 --> 2:21:47.200]  so i'm going to go to john in mass active duty national guard migrant crisis fema camps
[2:21:47.200 --> 2:21:49.280]  thanks for calling john i appreciate it you're on the air
[2:21:50.720 --> 2:21:54.000]  alex alaya thanks for taking my call you bet what's your view on all this
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:22:03.200]  it's just ridiculous and i believe it was your show that that brought up the fema camps where
[2:22:03.200 --> 2:22:07.840]  there was a congresswoman or somebody that mentioned like oh we're building what was in games
[2:22:07.840 --> 2:22:13.520]  oh we're building them for when the illegals come so the illegals are here and they ain't filling
[2:22:13.520 --> 2:22:19.920]  up the camps and it's tough living up here in the republic of massachusetts where even the
[2:22:19.920 --> 2:22:27.520]  republican governor is a democrat well you're right notice that we've got all these nonviolent
[2:22:27.520 --> 2:22:33.760]  offenders in prison trump's trying to fix that but then smugglers murderers multi multi-time
[2:22:33.760 --> 2:22:40.000]  kidnappers are just turned loose by ice because the judges let them go the judge what do we do
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:49.840]  about these judges you can't long list of impeachment are you just it's it's ridiculous i mean you
[2:22:49.840 --> 2:22:56.160]  don't know what's like being a conservative living in massachusetts and like for me working i work as
[2:22:56.160 --> 2:23:00.720]  a contractor on the outside i can't compete with all the illegals that are floating around here
[2:23:04.160 --> 2:23:08.320]  it's insane it drives down our wages raven against them god bless you john i appreciate your call
[2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:13.920]  my son active duty police officer in florida that's another place of massive amounts of
[2:23:13.920 --> 2:23:17.360]  illegals are showing up what's your view on this what should we do what should trump do
[2:23:18.320 --> 2:23:25.040]  all right first and foremost how do you hear me i can okay great uh i think we should militarize
[2:23:25.040 --> 2:23:31.840]  the border until the wall gets erected once it's erected and uh border patrol does an assessment
[2:23:31.840 --> 2:23:40.000]  they slowly demilitarize the border so they stabilize it then demilitarize it until this thing
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:44.800]  it's uh under control and by the way that's in the constitution the one place that's supposed to
[2:23:44.800 --> 2:23:49.920]  be militarized is your border that's your cell wall your cell membrane and it's it's the board

[2:23:55.760 --> 2:24:04.320]  think that that's the the model you look at the eu um that's the the model for the new world order

[2:33:42.880 --> 2:33:49.840]  who is trying to walk on landmines of not spooking the public but the same time preparing the
[2:33:49.840 --> 2:33:55.680]  country to defend itself you know i didn't even mention the story it it was it was only in full
[2:33:55.680 --> 2:34:01.920]  wars dot com yesterday illinois house passes bill requiring women african americans on corporate
[2:34:01.920 --> 2:34:07.440]  boards now on the surface that sounds real good oh really help black people help women
[2:34:09.440 --> 2:34:14.720]  corporate boards saying if you have a corporation and then you create a board to govern it you have
[2:34:14.720 --> 2:34:21.280]  to put certain people on it that sounds pretty Nazi to me you know i don't think there's a lot
[2:34:21.280 --> 2:34:26.880]  of white people on the board of b e t or the n double a c p or a lot of christians on the board
[2:34:26.880 --> 2:34:32.560]  of the a d l groups have free association we're not going to ban a golf course or we're not going
[2:34:32.560 --> 2:34:37.120]  to ban a bank from having white people or black people at it but you know if folks want to go
[2:34:37.120 --> 2:34:43.040]  create their own group whether it's the polish american association or you know whatever it is
[2:34:43.040 --> 2:34:47.360]  that's what people do this is dangerous and this will kill illinois even faster
[2:34:48.880 --> 2:34:52.080]  then i got stories like this one up on info wars dot com it's got to go viral
[2:34:53.120 --> 2:34:59.600]  great examples of this jesse smallwood is a hero google improves empire actors search results
[2:34:59.600 --> 2:35:06.640]  and the don salazar article tet giants preferential treatment of libs continues unabated
[2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:11.600]  and it turns out they've put a bunch of fake results for him that he's a hero and a great guy
[2:35:11.600 --> 2:35:15.360]  just like maxine water says he's proud of me did a great job
[2:35:21.040 --> 2:35:25.440]  so that's who they are folks the democrats think they can do anything they want
[2:35:26.880 --> 2:35:30.000]  whenever they want and escape any type of
[2:35:32.400 --> 2:35:38.720]  even scrutiny but that story is front and center at news wars there's a war on for the news news
[2:35:38.720 --> 2:35:45.200]  wars dot com jesse smallwood's a hero that's the top search result you look at duck duck go
[2:35:47.120 --> 2:35:54.880]  it's an idiot liar suspect joke pathological liar you go to google he's a hero
[2:35:57.120 --> 2:36:03.280]  think of the nerve of that and then sundar bachai right there while i'm in his face gets in front
[2:36:03.280 --> 2:36:10.560]  of congress and says we've never fixed one search result ever well that's funny
[2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:15.040]  that's really hilarious if it wasn't so serious
[2:36:17.840 --> 2:36:23.440]  man who's been holding the longest here let's go to
[2:36:26.880 --> 2:36:28.480]  pastor sam in texas go ahead
[2:36:28.480 --> 2:36:36.640]  Alex i just want to start by confirming everything that you said about latin america and south
[2:36:36.640 --> 2:36:42.400]  america and mexico today i know time is going to limit us so i'd just like to go to your most
[2:36:42.400 --> 2:36:51.040]  controversial point first the mexican president is absolutely a fraud the election was a fraud
[2:36:51.600 --> 2:36:57.440]  there were over 200 politicians assassinated in the run up to this election and i have personally
[2:36:57.440 --> 2:37:03.920]  approached three different latin presidents about this what we do in venezuela is a dry run for what
[2:37:03.920 --> 2:37:10.160]  we were are also going to have to do in mexico so i totally agree in the u.s has had to invade mexico
[2:37:10.160 --> 2:37:15.520]  three times and it's a constant problem and and the outgoing president was a patriot and worked
[2:37:15.520 --> 2:37:22.240]  with trump the new president is a socialist and is a globalist and is working to openly collapse
[2:37:22.240 --> 2:37:27.840]  everything so they're invading us with drugs and murder and millions of people and letting it happen
[2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:33.040]  and bragging they're doing it so we'll see what happens this is this is this is all you and run
[2:37:33.040 --> 2:37:40.480]  all the democratic party is behind this it's it's why you've seen the democrats call ms13 god's children
[2:37:45.520 --> 2:37:50.320]  thank you so much pastor sam i appreciate the call we'll put the current mexican president
[2:37:50.320 --> 2:37:55.600]  on screen for you give you all his bio info for tv viewers we put the wrong mexican president up
[2:37:55.600 --> 2:37:59.840]  that was the outgoing guy tried to actually help things and fix things but there's a new guy in there
[2:38:00.720 --> 2:38:08.560]  jim yeah there's the new guy right there all right let's talk to jim in dallas jim you're on the air
[2:38:08.560 --> 2:38:12.560]  you work with the estate national guard people think oh state guard that's like the crème
[2:38:12.560 --> 2:38:17.440]  d'or la crème of patriots working with federal and state try to defend the border in texas is the
[2:38:17.440 --> 2:38:21.520]  hot spot so they're right in the middle of it jim what are you witnessing down there well let me
[2:38:21.520 --> 2:38:26.000]  correct you alex i'm not in the national guard i'm in the texas state when i said texas state guard
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:31.600]  i think i said that you know i i'm i'm i'm a major general bodice's staff i'm the intelligence
[2:38:31.600 --> 2:38:39.040]  officer or one of a couple okay we're working uh with uh chief randall prince of the texas rangers
[2:38:39.040 --> 2:38:46.240]  right now and uh activating of course the ranger reconnaissance team at the border security operation
[2:38:46.240 --> 2:38:53.360]  center and from our side of it um we're centralizing at the 39th composite regiment that's texas state
[2:38:53.360 --> 2:39:01.280]  guard in el paso don't think that uh we're gonna wait for the federal government to protect the
[2:39:01.280 --> 2:39:07.360]  state of texas okay you've got aviation units up there and marshall they're coming down to the
[2:39:07.360 --> 2:39:14.320]  border and if the feds aren't going to do their job just like carnal travis admonished us and
[2:39:14.320 --> 2:39:20.400]  every one of our offices we have a quote from carnal travis on the wall about protecting ourselves
[2:39:20.400 --> 2:39:26.880]  against the outside aggression we're better at this than the federal government the border patrols
[2:39:26.880 --> 2:39:34.880]  not doing their job and the state of texas will protect the residents of the state well jim let me
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:39.920]  clear because my audio cuts out and i was saying the best people from the military the state guard
[2:39:39.920 --> 2:39:43.920]  the federal government are in the texas guard i know you're texas guard i know the main attack
[2:39:43.920 --> 2:39:48.400]  is happening in texas arizona and california i know the governor has said they're going to defend
[2:39:49.040 --> 2:39:54.400]  but we're talking about just in el paso they were saying 15 000 now a day instead of 3000
[2:39:54.400 --> 2:39:59.680]  being the previous record i understand you're doing a great job but how do you deal with a flood
[2:39:59.680 --> 2:40:04.400]  of something like that and i'm glad to hear you guys are fired up and you know out in the open
[2:40:04.400 --> 2:40:09.680]  that's i mean that's good news but give us your view on just how serious this is and then give us
[2:40:09.680 --> 2:40:16.320]  that carnal travis quote well i can't quote exactly but we've got him on our walls there's 25
[2:40:16.320 --> 2:40:21.360]  quotes that are out in every office what i'm saying is uh this isn't getting a lot of attention
[2:40:22.080 --> 2:40:28.000]  but the attorney general attorney general paxton uh and the governor governor abbott have called
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:34.880]  up the texas state guard unit uh we've been in contact with hood and blitz and the adjutant's
[2:40:34.880 --> 2:40:41.600]  office there isn't talking to us okay for some unknown reason now major general bonus is the
[2:40:41.600 --> 2:40:47.040]  commander of all texas forces the texas texas national guard the texas international guard
[2:40:47.040 --> 2:40:53.120]  and the texas state guard and he's activating members of the texas state guard and uh the next
[2:40:53.120 --> 2:40:59.360]  step is the texas national guard but that's got to be approved from the uh from washington well we
[2:40:59.360 --> 2:41:05.680]  don't have time for that alec and i'll tell you something else the next step is the authorization
[2:41:05.680 --> 2:41:10.400]  of lethal force by the governor we're not going to wait for anybody above the governor because
[2:41:10.400 --> 2:41:16.640]  our state's under attack uh alec and uh if we've got a if we've got to remove the illegals from our
[2:41:16.640 --> 2:41:22.640]  state and send them to another state or send them back to texas because you're back to mexico
[2:41:22.640 --> 2:41:28.480]  because you know that uh alec that the rangers have the same power as united states marshal
[2:41:28.480 --> 2:41:34.080]  they can deport people straight back over to the mexican province whether they're about mexican
[2:41:34.080 --> 2:41:39.760]  governors in those provinces are going to be cooperative or not they're not coming into texas
[2:41:40.640 --> 2:41:48.400]  and the governor is uh hairs breath away from authorizing deadly force to be used by the border
[2:41:48.400 --> 2:41:53.040]  security operation center and the ranger reconnaissance team well that's as we know there's talk
[2:41:53.040 --> 2:41:56.160]  about that there's all these armed qualities that have been shooting and killing people and let's
[2:41:56.160 --> 2:42:01.120]  explain the beds are overwhelmed the feds are overwhelmed the border patrol is overwhelmed
[2:42:01.120 --> 2:42:07.440]  the democrats are saying just capitulate if we let them break the border literally 20 of latin
[2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:12.320]  america in the next few years will spill in this will be the end of the country i mean this is

[2:42:24.800 --> 2:42:31.920]  members deploying to the border and the next step if the border patrol and the fed do not do
[2:42:31.920 --> 2:42:38.240]  something about this the next step is all of the governor abbott is going to authorize lethal force
[2:42:38.240 --> 2:42:44.400]  to prevent this tidal wave coming into state of texas now what they do to louis vienna new mexico

[2:47:11.760 --> 2:47:14.960]  again this is alex jones here we just joined this station's joining us
[2:47:16.960 --> 2:47:21.520]  i want to be clear the border patrol is estimating a hundred thousand people
[2:47:21.520 --> 2:47:26.960]  they're trying to get in they've got up to 15 000 people triple the number they've ever seen
[2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:32.160]  at two border checkpoints in texas one in arizona and then one in california so i was saying three
[2:47:32.160 --> 2:47:38.080]  earlier that's four so yesterday it was 45 000 a day it's four checkpoints responding that number
[2:47:38.880 --> 2:47:44.800]  my god it's up at 60 000 a day now and these are armed men bringing many of them in so
[2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:53.360]  so this is becoming just hysteria and you heard the major with the texas guard saying that
[2:47:54.080 --> 2:47:57.840]  that this is being escalated up to be able to defend themselves because they're getting shot at
[2:47:59.280 --> 2:48:03.280]  and so they branded all this that the these heroes are trying to get into the country
[2:48:04.240 --> 2:48:09.200]  this has become a really really really really serious crisis i'm going to take calls this
[2:48:09.200 --> 2:48:13.280]  segment the next and then mike adams is coming up but the second segment of the next hour i'm
[2:48:13.280 --> 2:48:17.920]  going to rear a piece we put that article on screen for tv viewers please that's from october
[2:48:17.920 --> 2:48:24.320]  21st of last year hard to believe already uh like four or five months ago almost six months ago
[2:48:24.320 --> 2:48:29.600]  meet the 600 million man un invasion force and i show all the documents all the admissions
[2:48:29.600 --> 2:48:35.200]  the un saying we're going to do this and i explain how by next year if we don't stop this invasion
[2:48:35.200 --> 2:48:41.040]  force it will encourage the next invasion force this is so critical we'll have it reposted the
[2:48:41.040 --> 2:48:47.040]  main page then force dot com will restream it before mike adams comes on live so jim and dallas
[2:48:47.040 --> 2:48:52.240]  you're all amped up and that's good and we are coming down to make it or break it i'm not somebody
[2:48:52.240 --> 2:48:57.920]  that ever wants to invade countries but venezuela is a dictatorship with the un as the main base
[2:48:57.920 --> 2:49:02.640]  to flood columbia and then right into central america they admit they're running it so we cut
[2:49:02.640 --> 2:49:06.880]  you in funding we cut central american funding which trump just did we cut mexican funding we
[2:49:06.880 --> 2:49:11.840]  closed the border uh and then we stopped playing games with the democrats who were involved in
[2:49:11.840 --> 2:49:16.800]  government uh and the state department still orchestrating this i mean that's this is maker
[2:49:16.800 --> 2:49:21.840]  to break it this this is this is the real threat what do you think well alex i agree with you
[2:49:21.840 --> 2:49:29.440]  entirely in fact uh major general bodice today and he's the head of the uh the texas military
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:35.840]  department uh adjutant general uh sent out orders to the texas state guard to the first and second
[2:49:35.840 --> 2:49:42.480]  regiment so we're going to have armed members of the texas state guard down in mcallin and over
[2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:50.800]  in el paso by 1800 tonight this is coming to a breaking point the uh camp maybrie is going
[2:49:50.800 --> 2:49:57.280]  to be uh setting up a tactical headquarters down in mcallin and in el paso so if the federal
[2:49:57.280 --> 2:50:03.200]  like i stated previously if the federal government is not going to defend texas texas are going to
[2:50:03.200 --> 2:50:08.560]  defend texas and we're not waiting for the federal government to do anything and i can tell you right
[2:50:08.560 --> 2:50:14.400]  now that the reds the fourth and the eighth and the 19th regiments of the texas state guard will
[2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:20.400]  be there within 72 hours and we're not going with rubber bullets we're being issued live rounds
[2:50:21.280 --> 2:50:29.280]  we will not let the federal government let texas be invaded by a tidal wave of of disease
[2:50:29.280 --> 2:50:35.360]  carrying illegal aliens and yes we use the term illegal and they're also smuggling and
[2:50:35.360 --> 2:50:40.320]  that's been confirmed the senate report and everything so let me ask you this though notice
[2:50:40.320 --> 2:50:44.640]  the border patrol friday said red alert we've been overwhelmed we need help so they're good people
[2:50:45.200 --> 2:50:49.760]  obviously and and trump's trying he's just acting with the confines of congress he wanted
[2:50:49.760 --> 2:50:54.800]  you know billion ten billion dollars he got 1.3 billion uh i'm just saying he should declare
[2:50:54.800 --> 2:50:58.640]  an emergency a law enforcement emergency he should declare a commander in chief emergency
[2:50:58.640 --> 2:51:02.400]  and then he can do whatever he wants i mean this is the border this is where presidents have
[2:51:02.400 --> 2:51:11.360]  dictator powers well alex you know as a lifelong texan as an asmi when you see the rangers start
[2:51:11.360 --> 2:51:17.680]  wearing their tactical uniforms which is the olive drab you know that we're not fooling around
[2:51:18.320 --> 2:51:26.080]  and it's just a sad situation that data texas pays 18 percent of all federal taxes and we
[2:51:26.080 --> 2:51:32.720]  can't get one cavalry soldier from hood to come down and protect the border it's not the the
[2:51:32.720 --> 2:51:38.480]  responsibility of the state of texas under our current constitutional setup for texas to have
[2:51:38.480 --> 2:51:45.280]  to appropriate 5.2 billion dollars to build a wall in our state because congress in washington
[2:51:45.280 --> 2:51:51.920]  can't get it done but i'm here to tell you like you said on several occasions real men are bred
[2:51:51.920 --> 2:51:58.800]  in texas in the history of colonel travis and you will not take our liberty and the people of the
[2:51:58.800 --> 2:52:04.720]  state of texas have an organization that will defend that lone star flag and what no i agree with
[2:52:04.720 --> 2:52:09.520]  you but i'm just telling you there's more than one way to skin a cat we need to be suing beto
[2:52:09.520 --> 2:52:14.720]  who openly smuggled a bunch of groups for child smuggling we know he helped smuggle kids in he
[2:52:14.720 --> 2:52:21.040]  brags about it just like uh jack besovic tweeted it or hey ramos and said oh you say open the border
[2:52:21.040 --> 2:52:25.360]  you support child smuggling there's more than one way to skin a cat we need to target legally and
[2:52:25.360 --> 2:52:32.320]  lawfully but no more games the leadership of the democratic party the gloves are off believe me they
[2:52:32.320 --> 2:52:36.480]  are tearing the hell out of me behind the scenes with non-conventional operations and so you guys
[2:52:36.480 --> 2:52:40.320]  are doing a great job we'll pray for you you're right hundreds of thousands are already headed
[2:52:40.320 --> 2:52:45.840]  this way hundreds of thousands have hit and i'm just glad that the folks in our texas guard are
[2:52:45.840 --> 2:52:50.880]  awake and i'm glad the governor is a great patriot's awake uh but this is the plan uh to implode the
[2:52:50.880 --> 2:52:56.160]  country so everybody should really really be pushing for trump to take action just in closing
[2:52:56.160 --> 2:53:02.320]  what would you like to see the president do well before we get to the president the attorney general
[2:53:02.320 --> 2:53:08.400]  kenny paxton is not sitting on his hands alec the stuff that you just suggested you know you've
[2:53:08.400 --> 2:53:12.400]  spoken off the record with attorney general paxton well let's not get these people in trouble but
[2:53:12.400 --> 2:53:18.160]  yeah they're patriots so but you know that the legal side of the house that he's as much a fighter
[2:53:18.160 --> 2:53:23.840]  as you and i are in the field as much or more so of a patriot good man for play dough texas
[2:53:23.840 --> 2:53:29.200]  and he's going to take care of that side uh alec we're not laying down for this we're up on our
[2:53:29.200 --> 2:53:34.480]  high no i understand because this is it they're breaking the country right now we just i'm just
[2:53:34.480 --> 2:53:40.960]  saying and i agree let's deal with the big threat this the wave who sent the wave because i just
[2:53:40.960 --> 2:53:45.120]  really want to i really want those people to get in some trouble god bless you jim folks that's why
[2:53:45.120 --> 2:53:49.840]  i tell you we're not just hyping this crisis up trump can act like it's not a crisis he's not doing
[2:53:49.840 --> 2:53:54.400]  that uh the last caller can act like it's not a crisis and just kind of like put up with it until
[2:53:54.400 --> 2:54:00.240]  we just collapse like venezuela um we got to deal with this we got to stabilize the third world
[2:54:00.800 --> 2:54:07.520]  and we got to stabilize our own country sure this makes me sick ike in missouri you're on the
[2:54:07.520 --> 2:54:13.600]  air retired police immigration family and border patrol what's your view on the situation well
[2:54:13.600 --> 2:54:17.440]  first of all ronald regens though the nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation
[2:54:18.960 --> 2:54:23.600]  and we are not controlling our borders we have not been controlling our borders for some time
[2:54:25.200 --> 2:54:29.440]  being a police officer i've had incidences where i've come across people that were from out of
[2:54:29.440 --> 2:54:34.960]  the country you check the passports there's no us ports of entry stamps uh and their passports
[2:54:34.960 --> 2:54:40.080]  you call ice you call immigration and immigration says we don't have the manpower to come down and
[2:54:40.080 --> 2:54:47.680]  bring these people in and this was a small town in the middle of bfb we need to bolster those ranks
[2:54:47.680 --> 2:54:53.040]  we need to give the the money to immigration to these law enforcement agencies down along the border
[2:54:53.040 --> 2:54:57.520]  down in texas to get the personnel that they need to do to protect our border if we have to use
[2:54:57.520 --> 2:55:01.280]  the military to do it we need to use the military to do it no i agree but i'm saying we've been
[2:55:01.280 --> 2:55:06.640]  talking about this forever it's here now they're getting 15 000 a day in el paso the the previous
[2:55:06.640 --> 2:55:14.240]  record was 3000 it's it's all broken it's everything's overwhelmed now the border has fallen yes it has
[2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:19.920]  without a doubt but the thing about it is is we also need to be looking at our own federal
[2:55:19.920 --> 2:55:24.080]  government and the people that are supporting source and the people that are supporting this
[2:55:24.080 --> 2:55:29.040]  need to be kicked out of office they need to have charges against them no i agree the games are over
[2:55:29.040 --> 2:55:34.240]  i mean it's either roll over and die or or they or we start legally and lawfully going
[2:55:34.240 --> 2:55:41.280]  after all of them and they're all plum targets we've got their ass the other issue is a lot of
[2:55:41.280 --> 2:55:46.240]  sorrows this business is conducted down in south america if you look at a lot of his companies
[2:55:46.240 --> 2:55:51.280]  a lot of the companies that he owns or has interest in are based out of south america of course
[2:55:51.280 --> 2:55:59.760]  so what do you think we should do like we need to build the wall we need a controller border
[2:55:59.760 --> 2:56:05.200]  we need to have a way to legally vet these people if they want to come into the country make sure
[2:56:05.200 --> 2:56:08.880]  that we're not getting the scum of the earth in our country that these people are coming here
[2:56:08.880 --> 2:56:15.520]  that are going to not harm our citizens show allegiance to the american flag come here to try
[2:56:15.520 --> 2:56:20.560]  to make a better life for themselves and their families and we need to have a legal way to do
[2:56:20.560 --> 2:56:24.080]  it instead of just opening the doors letting them in giving them this welfare we need to take

[3:00:01.280 --> 3:00:19.200]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show
[3:00:31.280 --> 3:00:42.080]  you want to talk about what can be done because i'm not a dramatic person
[3:00:43.360 --> 3:00:47.680]  and i follow the border news and i know three thousand a day is huge in el Paso
[3:00:47.680 --> 3:00:53.680]  or mcallin and both border heads there said it's 13 to 15 thousand to 16 thousand a day
[3:00:54.640 --> 3:00:58.320]  and and and and we're not testing anybody we're not even getting who they are they're just going
[3:00:58.320 --> 3:01:04.160]  every direction because you can't well the border patrol ought to do something you try with 20 people
[3:01:04.160 --> 3:01:13.440]  to stop 10 000 it's insane what do you think's happening here thomas hey alex how are you doing
[3:01:13.440 --> 3:01:19.440]  sir i'm i've never been this concerned for the country i i don't know how are you doing i'm doing
[3:01:19.440 --> 3:01:24.080]  fine but i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna address the elephant in the room that it appears
[3:01:24.080 --> 3:01:28.880]  nobody else wants to discuss or talk and that's plain and simple i'm a trump supporter
[3:01:28.880 --> 3:01:34.960]  i voted for him but i'm going to put this all on him he has got specific laws it's specifically
[3:01:34.960 --> 3:01:42.720]  10 usc 284 a state that this doesn't have to turn into a dog and pony show he can act so to me it seems
[3:01:42.720 --> 3:01:48.640]  like he's agitating sides or he's saying the left isn't letting me do this boo who he has all the
[3:01:48.640 --> 3:01:53.680]  authority not only given through the executive branch but that's specific law i just mentioned
[3:01:53.680 --> 3:01:57.920]  to me this seems like a game well you're very sophisticated because this weekend i was thinking
[3:01:57.920 --> 3:02:02.800]  about this i said i hope trump and blame with fire letting this crisis get out of control to win the
[3:02:02.800 --> 3:02:08.320]  next election because we might win that one but we'll lose all the others after and i was thinking
[3:02:08.320 --> 3:02:14.800]  that myself is he letting this get out of control it has to be because i actually alex i've sat down
[3:02:14.800 --> 3:02:20.480]  the other night and i listed uh with ongoing events 10 or 12 different subjects where he
[3:02:20.480 --> 3:02:24.560]  actually has authority to take control of and he does not but he does love to get in front of the
[3:02:24.560 --> 3:02:28.640]  camera and say look at the left of stopping me i'm starting to think maybe he was there to
[3:02:29.200 --> 3:02:35.760]  cause more division um i'll be honest under obama we knew it was literally but there's the deal he's
[3:02:35.760 --> 3:02:39.840]  not a police officer like you and i'm not just defending trump i've noticed when he gets info
[3:02:39.840 --> 3:02:46.480]  he does the right thing he's there asking his advisors things he can ask his advisors well
[3:02:46.480 --> 3:02:50.960]  he needs to get new advisors the bottom line is i'm i'm pretty much a low-level guy but if i can
[3:02:50.960 --> 3:02:55.600]  look up the laws and see my civic the way that they're put to us if he can't see him he doesn't
[3:02:55.600 --> 3:03:00.560]  need to be in the job then you've got the next you've got the next two minutes what does trump
[3:03:00.560 --> 3:03:07.840]  need to do trump needs to follow the law plain and simple he just needs the 10 usd 284 gets him
[3:03:07.840 --> 3:03:12.480]  full authority when he was doing this dog and pony show with nancy plosie like asking for funds and
[3:03:12.480 --> 3:03:17.200]  all this kind of garbage that's pure nonsense executive branch has its own uh its own budget
[3:03:17.200 --> 3:03:22.800]  he could have built the wall with no fanfare very quietly and did it but he was it was acting like
[3:03:22.800 --> 3:03:27.440]  uh amp amp b and gomer pile needs to give him authority and this person and that person
[3:03:27.440 --> 3:03:32.320]  his legal authority is clearly spelled out and it would take a third grader to see it no you're
[3:03:32.320 --> 3:03:37.760]  right under under the commander in chief he could do it everyone uh when it comes to military
[3:03:37.760 --> 3:03:43.360]  installations and uh federal buildings and borders within the united states and or its
[3:03:43.360 --> 3:03:50.560]  territory he has full legal and and to quote the law sole authority so what's he waiting for
[3:03:52.800 --> 3:03:56.480]  no you're right and that's why encultures mad at him so what do you think he's really up to
[3:03:58.240 --> 3:04:01.680]  that's where i lean on you alex because you've been deciphering this for years
[3:04:02.400 --> 3:04:06.880]  you know i've trump super smart on some things and not on others and i'm not trying to give him a
[3:04:06.880 --> 3:04:11.440]  pass but when you finally get to him with something he'll do the right thing that's why they fight we
[3:04:11.440 --> 3:04:17.680]  can't get to him you still do he he has these these advisors around him that i'm not giving him a pass
[3:04:18.560 --> 3:04:24.240]  uh but we need to get to him so that he understands like the way he acts at all happy once he got
[3:04:24.240 --> 3:04:30.000]  clear to russia gate of course he was cleared of it why wait till they do it he just i don't know man
[3:04:31.280 --> 3:04:34.640]  at least he cut the funding off to central america right that that was a big move
[3:04:34.640 --> 3:04:41.040]  i mean that's a big way to cut it off i i just i don't know thank you thomas we're going to take
[3:04:41.040 --> 3:04:46.240]  more calls obviously throughout the next few days here this is what we're going to be focusing on

[3:06:07.600 --> 3:06:13.680]  united states is under attack this is 21st century sixth generation warfare the mega
[3:06:13.680 --> 3:06:19.840]  corporations of the planet publicly have organized the un and its world migrant refugee program
[3:06:19.840 --> 3:06:25.200]  to actually create refugee crisis and then organize them into political tools to create
[3:06:25.200 --> 3:06:31.760]  migration routes out of north africa asia the middle east and latin america into first world
[3:06:31.760 --> 3:06:38.640]  nations to politically conquer them we're about to break down the facts the documents the history
[3:06:38.640 --> 3:06:44.080]  and how we can stop it with this critical information but it's up to you to get it out
[3:06:49.280 --> 3:06:56.720]  the story of the 10 000 plus illegal alien migrant caravan that smashed through mexican
[3:06:56.720 --> 3:07:04.240]  defenses yesterday on its way to the united states begins in europe and what they've gone
[3:07:04.240 --> 3:07:08.880]  through in the last six years but i want everyone watching to understand something
[3:07:09.680 --> 3:07:15.520]  what i'm about to break down is admitted fact from the united nations and george soros's
[3:07:16.080 --> 3:07:24.160]  open society foundation none of this is my opinion it's shocking to me to watch
[3:07:25.360 --> 3:07:31.760]  mainstream media deceive the american public but to also watch even conservatives not realize the full
[3:07:31.760 --> 3:07:42.000]  magnitude the united states is under military attack it's a 21st century war using weaponized
[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:48.000]  third world populations let's begin now a lot of people think of europe is far away from the
[3:07:48.000 --> 3:07:57.360]  middle east and far away from africa it's its own area of the world the tip top of industrialization
[3:07:57.360 --> 3:08:05.440]  and uh and western civilization the first world but just south of it 90 miles in some cases
[3:08:05.440 --> 3:08:14.000]  only five miles is north africa now the united nations set up by the robber barons about 75
[3:08:14.000 --> 3:08:19.680]  years ago by the multinational corporations understands that it understands that if they
[3:08:19.680 --> 3:08:26.400]  have jurisdiction over migrants or over refugees they can use them as political weapons and they've
[3:08:26.400 --> 3:08:31.680]  written many a white paper on it a few of which i'm about to break down here in a moment but if
[3:08:31.680 --> 3:08:39.840]  you look at the middle east and you look at central asia its smack dab right here underneath
[3:08:39.840 --> 3:08:47.680]  europe and only greece and bulgaria and mastodonia and albania are standing in the way and most of
[3:08:47.680 --> 3:08:55.120]  those countries are now muslim or muslim majority like albania what did bill clinton do back in the
[3:08:55.120 --> 3:09:03.040]  1990s bombed syria repeatedly to help al qaeda and to help other islamic fighters take control
[3:09:03.040 --> 3:09:08.960]  of a third of syria so it's part of a globalist colonization backing radical islam across the
[3:09:08.960 --> 3:09:16.720]  world and in the last six years we've seen more than 15 million illegal aliens staged at un
[3:09:16.720 --> 3:09:24.960]  emergency centers in north africa and in the middle east to then be escorted and paid to then
[3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:30.160]  invade europe with socialist and globalist governments under EU control letting them in
[3:09:30.960 --> 3:09:34.880]  and they admit it's part of a plan to take over and i'm going to show those documents here in a
[3:09:34.880 --> 3:09:39.520]  moment that's why this is so critical because they're carrying out the same plan here
[3:09:39.520 --> 3:09:46.880]  so the story of what's happening to the united states begins the middle east in europe now
[3:09:48.160 --> 3:09:54.080]  here is north america from southern mexico to the north pole is north america central america
[3:09:54.640 --> 3:10:00.960]  and then south america right now in guatemala tens of thousands have already crossed and had been
[3:10:00.960 --> 3:10:08.080]  stopped on the edge of mexico hundreds of thousands more are being prepared in camps in guatemala
[3:10:08.080 --> 3:10:14.400]  and honduras un funded camps ford foundation funded camps george soros funded camps it's all
[3:10:14.400 --> 3:10:19.760]  in federal documents it's all public but mainstream media will lie and say that's a conspiracy theory
[3:10:20.400 --> 3:10:24.400]  now i'm going to break down their overall master plan and then how we stop it here in a moment
[3:10:25.040 --> 3:10:28.800]  that's why we're so censored and so blocked because the globalists know we actually research
[3:10:28.800 --> 3:10:33.760]  their source documents but let's finish up with europe real quick before we go to america here is
[3:10:33.760 --> 3:10:40.720]  reuters we have clips of it right here in the info wars dot com article macron walks back mass
[3:10:40.720 --> 3:10:48.160]  migration tells migrants to succeed in africa after he said 200 million need to enter europe
[3:10:48.160 --> 3:10:57.920]  in the next 20 years or so here's another one from a un document in 2001 un planned to flood america
[3:10:57.920 --> 3:11:05.120]  with 600 million migrants to politically divide and conquer drive down wages and destroy any
[3:11:06.080 --> 3:11:13.040]  sovereignty that nations have in a tower of babel type scenario austria hungry and others are
[3:11:13.040 --> 3:11:19.440]  pulling out of the un immigration pack saying that they are not going to be part of this
[3:11:19.440 --> 3:11:25.440]  because the un is purposely paying to bring in the refugees and to create the refugee problem
[3:11:25.440 --> 3:11:33.200]  to bring in a client group that the eu the un and the globalist control so again think about how
[3:11:33.200 --> 3:11:41.520]  close africa and the middle east is to europe 90 miles from italy only a few miles from spain
[3:11:42.080 --> 3:11:49.280]  soros is on record funding millions of people in zodiac boats coming across and then invading
[3:11:49.280 --> 3:11:56.720]  state being turned into political armies the very same thing is now being done just like
[3:11:56.720 --> 3:12:01.520]  it started six years ago in europe to the united states the good news is we know the battle plan
[3:12:01.520 --> 3:12:06.240]  and can stop it so the united nations and multinational corporations they're promoting
[3:12:06.240 --> 3:12:12.640]  globalism almost all of them go in and exploit venezuela set up socialism and communism once
[3:12:12.640 --> 3:12:18.720]  it collapsed everyone starts fleeing and in a domino effect only seven nations from venezuela
[3:12:18.720 --> 3:12:26.240]  up to the us border people begin to flee by the tens of millions just as the un brings in policies
[3:12:26.240 --> 3:12:30.000]  with the imf world bank that collapsed north africa and the middle east just like hillary
[3:12:30.000 --> 3:12:34.320]  and obama started the wars in the arab spring that admittedly caused the refugee crisis the
[3:12:34.320 --> 3:12:40.160]  globalists go in they help exacerbate the crises millions begin to flee in all directions the un
[3:12:40.160 --> 3:12:46.880]  sets up refugee camps to organize train and pay the groups to the elite frog nation by nation
[3:12:46.880 --> 3:12:53.440]  and the un openly tells panaman costa rica nicaragua honduras and guatemala if you simply let
[3:12:53.440 --> 3:12:59.600]  our people have passage we won't leave them here we're sending them to the us and now in just the
[3:12:59.600 --> 3:13:07.520]  last year millions are migrating all the way up to the guatemalan border where the un has been
[3:13:07.520 --> 3:13:14.320]  called in by mexico to fix the problem that the un itself set up on record to then set up a refugee
[3:13:14.320 --> 3:13:21.040]  camps or a group of camps over the mexican border to ensure that they don't stay in mexico
[3:13:21.040 --> 3:13:28.560]  but instead are given transit up to the united states this is the political plan to capture
[3:13:28.560 --> 3:13:33.360]  this nation it's been done before and they admit it's their plan think about the incredible
[3:13:33.360 --> 3:13:39.600]  deception of cnn when tens of thousands of illegal aliens un funded smashed over the guatemalan
[3:13:39.600 --> 3:13:47.760]  border yesterday they said oh there was chaos at the migrant march no they attacked the police
[3:13:47.760 --> 3:13:54.720]  they tore down the fences they rampaged over and they used children as shields and then when other
[3:13:54.720 --> 3:14:00.480]  smaller groups have gotten up to the border they claim that we're taking children away from these
[3:14:00.480 --> 3:14:05.200]  people to find out who they really are and the famous case of trump standing a little girl it
[3:14:05.200 --> 3:14:10.720]  wasn't even true so they bring these children into this dangerous situation the un funds it
[3:14:10.720 --> 3:14:17.440]  and the un sets up their bases ensuring the next country that we won't let them stay here
[3:14:17.440 --> 3:14:24.000]  get into us and we promise to ship them into the united states into europe into the heart of the
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:29.840]  political systems they want to control this is the reverse of colonialism and is a corporate
[3:14:29.840 --> 3:14:36.160]  form of colonialism using weaponized third world populations to take over the planet now in part
[3:14:36.160 --> 3:14:40.800]  two of this breakdown we're going to go into the studio and i'm going to lay out how we stop it how
[3:14:40.800 --> 3:14:46.480]  president trump stops him but the first thing we've got to do as modern paul reveres is raise the alarm
[3:14:46.480 --> 3:14:50.960]  we care about third world populations and we hope they reform their nations but the very globalists
[3:14:50.960 --> 3:14:55.680]  that have imploded their nations are using the crises they've helped create to now literally
[3:14:55.680 --> 3:15:07.600]  phone in these giant migrant waves to form huge migration routes literal railroads into the west
[3:15:07.600 --> 3:15:16.160]  just like they've done europe this is the plan the official un plan 600 million people they plan
[3:15:16.160 --> 3:15:22.080]  in the next 30 years to bring into the united states and totally and completely conquer the
[3:15:22.080 --> 3:15:27.360]  nation because that's how you control people is to divide and conquer bring in people keep them
[3:15:27.360 --> 3:15:32.400]  poor keep them dumb set them up under socialism and then if you don't like what the domestic
[3:15:32.400 --> 3:15:38.800]  population has done you can trigger the population you brought in to absolutely burn the nation down
[3:15:39.360 --> 3:15:44.720]  that's the globalist plan this is 21st century warfare and america is under attack now we've
[3:15:44.720 --> 3:15:56.640]  got to talk about how we stop it hi i'm dan pilla i started fighting the irs over 40 years ago when

[3:20:17.040 --> 3:20:25.520]  it is the alex jones show with mike adams all right this is mike adams jumping in here for the
[3:20:25.520 --> 3:20:30.320]  remainder of the fourth hour of the alex jones show today thanks for continuing with me here
[3:20:30.320 --> 3:20:36.960]  i've been listening to the show today as you have as well and i agree with alex's assessment we are
[3:20:36.960 --> 3:20:42.880]  in an emergency situation with the the open borders the invasion of the united states the
[3:20:42.880 --> 3:20:48.800]  occupation and attempted overthrow of america but it's it's really bigger than that alex has
[3:20:48.800 --> 3:20:53.440]  talked about this it's about the overthrow of western civilization and for the rest of the hour
[3:20:53.440 --> 3:20:59.840]  today i'm going to bring some unique analysis to this situation and explain exactly what's
[3:20:59.840 --> 3:21:07.440]  happening and why it's going to get a whole lot worse a lot worse in the years ahead you're going
[3:21:07.440 --> 3:21:13.600]  to look back at today and think these were the good times because we are headed western civilization
[3:21:13.600 --> 3:21:22.480]  is headed for an engineered collapse by design and it's designed to take down all independent
[3:21:22.480 --> 3:21:28.560]  thinking and even to take down humanity ultimately because remember the globalists want to destroy
[3:21:29.280 --> 3:21:35.360]  about six billion people now that is a thousand times bigger than the holocaust of world war two
[3:21:35.360 --> 3:21:41.680]  statistics about world war two typically quote six million jews being exterminated by the third
[3:21:41.680 --> 3:21:49.600]  rike the globalists today want to exterminate six billion humans that's a thousand holocausts
[3:21:50.160 --> 3:21:54.800]  and they are attempting to carry it out right now but one of the things is they have to take
[3:21:54.800 --> 3:22:00.800]  your guns first because it's really hard to to take over and and and murder people and execute
[3:22:00.800 --> 3:22:07.200]  people if people can defend themselves so today i have an important alert you know the the high
[3:22:07.200 --> 3:22:13.520]  capacity gun magazine ban was overturned in california just a couple of days ago those of
[3:22:13.520 --> 3:22:18.480]  you listening in california you have a very limited window of opportunity to purchase these
[3:22:18.480 --> 3:22:25.360]  what i call normal capacity magazines to me a a 30 round magpul magazine in an ar-15 is a normal
[3:22:25.360 --> 3:22:31.600]  capacity magazine i wouldn't defend my home or my my ranch without a 30 round magazine or
[3:22:31.600 --> 3:22:37.200]  several of them actually so that's normal capacity you know to me maybe a hundred round drum that
[3:22:37.200 --> 3:22:42.960]  might be a high capacity magazine but a 30 round magazine or for your glock pistol or your sig pistol
[3:22:42.960 --> 3:22:49.120]  whatever you have smith and wesson you know a 15 round 17 round even a 21 round magazine for your
[3:22:49.120 --> 3:22:56.320]  f in 509 whatever you have that's a normal capacity magazine retailers are now flooding
[3:22:56.320 --> 3:23:01.600]  california with high capacity magazines as they're called which i call normal capacity again but
[3:23:01.600 --> 3:23:09.760]  retailers like brownells midway usa palmetto state armory other online resellers right now
[3:23:09.760 --> 3:23:16.560]  many of them are offering specials you know like like nine magpul mags for your ar-15
[3:23:16.560 --> 3:23:23.040]  for 90 dollars these are specials because these companies in my view they haven't said this but
[3:23:23.040 --> 3:23:28.800]  in my analysis they are deliberately working to flood california with these normal capacity
[3:23:28.800 --> 3:23:35.600]  magazines before the re-ban kicks in making it illegal for people to purchase or possess these
[3:23:35.600 --> 3:23:42.640]  magazines and you can bet you can bet there are probably hundreds of thousands of constitutional
[3:23:42.640 --> 3:23:49.920]  patriots law-abiding citizens across california today that are ordering you know 40 or 50 of these
[3:23:49.920 --> 3:23:55.680]  magazines which are of course non-serialized that you know they can't be traced you don't need an
[3:23:55.680 --> 3:24:01.840]  ffl to purchase the magazines and they are squirreling these away they are going to hide them they're
[3:24:01.840 --> 3:24:07.200]  going to hold on to them because they know what's coming and what's coming is a brutal civil war
[3:24:07.200 --> 3:24:14.080]  an invasion almost a military class land invasion of california arizona new mexico and texas
[3:24:14.080 --> 3:24:20.480]  through the southern border it's on the border is beyond broken it is in essence a warlike invasion
[3:24:20.480 --> 3:24:28.000]  of america and the fact that these many of these immigrants being violent child traffickers and
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:33.520]  drug smugglers and sex traffickers not all of them but many of them are and i've got a quote here
[3:24:33.520 --> 3:24:39.200]  from christian nielsen that i'll talk about today who even talks about this child so-called child
[3:24:39.200 --> 3:24:46.080]  recycling traffic ring which is unbelievably horrific and insane the fact that the fact that
[3:24:46.080 --> 3:24:52.960]  lawmakers in america are trying to disarm the american people disarm law-abiding citizens of
[3:24:52.960 --> 3:25:00.800]  this country while allowing us to be overrun by a land invasion of violent migrants in some cases
[3:25:00.800 --> 3:25:06.880]  violent criminals and traffickers and smugglers this is beyond acceptable we are very close to
[3:25:06.880 --> 3:25:14.400]  the point in my analysis of if if trump doesn't activate the american people if trump doesn't
[3:25:14.400 --> 3:25:20.880]  you know maybe call up the militia or maybe call up the guard or maybe call up the the pentagon
[3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:25.200]  to defend the border if trump doesn't do something i think we're arriving at a point very soon where
[3:25:25.200 --> 3:25:31.360]  the american people are going to do something on their own because in the constitution they have
[3:25:31.360 --> 3:25:35.680]  the right to you have the right to defend your country against all enemies foreign and domestic
[3:25:35.680 --> 3:25:40.800]  and we are being invaded this is a matter of national survival it's beyond just national
[3:25:40.800 --> 3:25:47.280]  security this is about whether america will exist over the next you know 10 years or maybe less
[3:25:47.280 --> 3:25:54.400]  than that so right now as it is legal as this ban in california has been temporarily lifted
[3:25:54.400 --> 3:25:58.480]  if you are in california get get your high capacity so-called high capacity again normal
[3:25:58.480 --> 3:26:03.680]  capacity magazines for your firearms and the rest of you all over the country if you're living in
[3:26:03.680 --> 3:26:09.760]  oregon you know there's a law they're trying to pass there to ban and outlaw the 80 percent receivers
[3:26:09.760 --> 3:26:15.360]  that you can use to make a fully functional ar receiver in a ghost gunner a cnc milling machine
[3:26:16.000 --> 3:26:20.640]  and i have one of those machines and i mill out my own receivers and it works great you know ghost
[3:26:20.640 --> 3:26:26.240]  gunner it's it's a breakthrough product you should get one if it's legal but they've outlawed it into
[3:26:26.240 --> 3:26:31.200]  jersey and they're trying to outlaw it in oregon because they don't want the citizens to be armed
[3:26:31.200 --> 3:26:39.440]  to defend yourself against this invasion that is being not just tolerated but endorsed by democrats
[3:26:39.440 --> 3:26:47.360]  endorsed by them you know the level of corruption of these democrats who are in my analysis taking
[3:26:47.360 --> 3:26:52.960]  money from the drug cartels to keep the border open because the drug cartels need that vector they
[3:26:52.960 --> 3:26:58.880]  need that highway to be able to smuggle in not just you know not marijuana because there's no
[3:26:58.880 --> 3:27:04.080]  there's no money in smuggling marijuana it's legal almost everywhere it's the money is in heroin
[3:27:04.080 --> 3:27:09.280]  and the money is in child trafficking the money is in the human smuggling that they're doing
[3:27:10.160 --> 3:27:16.560]  and what they're doing now is they're kidnapping children so that they can claim to be a family
[3:27:16.560 --> 3:27:21.920]  as they claim asylum at the border this this again is called child recycling so they're
[3:27:21.920 --> 3:27:26.560]  kidnapping children in mexico and other south american countries el salvador and so on and
[3:27:26.560 --> 3:27:31.360]  then exploiting those children to try to get into america as a family and then once the
[3:27:31.360 --> 3:27:38.480]  the child is released then the child is taken back down you know the kidnapping continues
[3:27:38.480 --> 3:27:43.840]  from these coyotes and the human traffickers and then they assign that same child to another
[3:27:43.840 --> 3:27:50.320]  adult to claim that that person is the parent and that's their child and this recycling goes on
[3:27:50.320 --> 3:27:56.080]  every day and this is how democrats are abusing the system if we don't stand up and stop this
[3:27:56.080 --> 3:28:01.840]  i mean the humanitarian crisis is off the charts here we have a humanitarian obligation
[3:28:01.840 --> 3:28:07.520]  to halt this not just a national defense obligation if we don't do something urgently
[3:28:07.520 --> 3:28:12.160]  if trump doesn't take action or the people don't take action or the governors of states like texas
[3:28:12.160 --> 3:28:19.360]  don't take action then america will be gone it'll be done for america will become venezuela we will
[3:28:19.360 --> 3:28:23.680]  be overrun and there's no doubt in my mind that civil war will break out because the american
[3:28:23.680 --> 3:28:29.040]  people are fed up and they're tired of having their votes overruled by the votes of illegals in
[3:28:29.040 --> 3:28:36.080]  places like california we can no longer stand by and just watch tv and pretend trump is going to
[3:28:36.080 --> 3:28:41.920]  solve all our problems it is time for the american people to demand a solution and be prepared to
[3:28:41.920 --> 3:28:47.680]  defend our nation much more straight ahead here on the alex jones show this is mike adams be right

[3:33:14.320 --> 3:33:20.800]  all right with the democrats now demanding the full release of the muhler report and claiming to
[3:33:20.800 --> 3:33:27.920]  believe in transparency of course it's a selective belief on on their part why not release the fisa
[3:33:27.920 --> 3:33:35.520]  warrant details why not release the scope memo that expanded the scope of the muhler investigation
[3:33:35.520 --> 3:33:42.720]  way beyond even any hint of a of a potential crime but to obstruction why not release hillary
[3:33:42.720 --> 3:33:48.800]  clinton's 33 000 so-called destroyed emails well you know there's a lot of stuff that needs to be
[3:33:48.800 --> 3:33:54.800]  released why not release all the area 51 files for that matter i mean if trump wants to get into
[3:33:54.800 --> 3:34:00.080]  the the mood of releasing documents well there's all kinds of stuff he could release i mean he could
[3:34:00.080 --> 3:34:05.920]  blow a hole in the in the british intelligence mi5 operation and he may well do that i i have a
[3:34:05.920 --> 3:34:11.920]  feeling trump is holding things for the right moment to to quote go nuclear on the intelligence
[3:34:11.920 --> 3:34:16.480]  community if it comes to that that's just my guess i mean i don't have any specific inside
[3:34:16.480 --> 3:34:22.000]  information on that but in this segment i want to present to you an understanding about what's
[3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:28.000]  called the collapse of complex societies there's a book by that name that i read many years ago
[3:34:28.000 --> 3:34:35.600]  it's by joseph tainter it's called collapse of complex societies now the reason this is relevant
[3:34:35.600 --> 3:34:41.360]  to you is because this is what we are witnessing and living through right now we are going to
[3:34:41.360 --> 3:34:47.440]  to suffer an incredible global collapse it is now inevitable we're past the point of no return
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:52.800]  so have no illusions you are going to live through the most difficult time of your life and it's
[3:34:52.800 --> 3:34:57.600]  going to get so much worse again you're going to look back at today and think today that these are
[3:34:57.600 --> 3:35:02.960]  the good times instead of getting more difficult to get anything done logistics are going to break
[3:35:02.960 --> 3:35:07.920]  down everywhere if you think bowing airplanes falling out of the sky was a big deal that's
[3:35:07.920 --> 3:35:14.960]  just the tip of the iceberg things stop working when they become incredibly complex and i'll explain
[3:35:14.960 --> 3:35:21.200]  why here but even this morning the united states postal service had an outage of its api for shipping
[3:35:21.200 --> 3:35:27.280]  packages which means that every fulfillment warehouse across the country could not ship out its
[3:35:27.280 --> 3:35:32.400]  packages or was delayed while the postal service uh computer bugs were worked out it's probably
[3:35:32.400 --> 3:35:36.400]  i mean i know this affected our operation it might have affected info wars store operation
[3:35:36.400 --> 3:35:42.480]  temporarily although the api did come back online but it just goes to show you that we now live in
[3:35:42.480 --> 3:35:48.640]  such complex societies where let's take the bowing example a pilot of an airplane you know i'm
[3:35:48.640 --> 3:35:55.200]  trained as a pilot i flew sesna's in a sesna you have cables you know cable controls you are working
[3:35:55.200 --> 3:35:59.920]  the foot pedals you're working the rudder you're you know you're you're pitching the airplane using
[3:36:00.640 --> 3:36:05.760]  physical controls in the cockpit it's not an electronic interpretation of what you want to
[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:11.200]  do there's not some computer software system that's overriding the controls believe me sesna
[3:36:11.200 --> 3:36:16.560]  airplanes i flew a 182 by the way uh believe me there's there's no software in that system
[3:36:16.560 --> 3:36:21.360]  at all except what's on your navigation board so you have direct control over that airplane
[3:36:21.360 --> 3:36:26.320]  and you'd have to be a fool to pitch the nose down and fly into the ground i never did that obviously
[3:36:26.320 --> 3:36:33.040]  you know nobody does that you'd be a moron but yet when you introduce complex bowing software
[3:36:33.040 --> 3:36:39.680]  and now you have to have computer programmers who by the way there's no qualification you know to be
[3:36:39.680 --> 3:36:44.240]  a programmer some programmers are great other programmers are morons they're incompetent they
[3:36:44.240 --> 3:36:48.880]  have no idea what they're doing there's no certification that guarantees programmers
[3:36:48.880 --> 3:36:52.800]  are our programs not like a a medical license for being a doctor not that doctors know what
[3:36:52.800 --> 3:36:58.240]  they're doing either but my point is anybody can claim to be a programmer and they could work for
[3:36:58.240 --> 3:37:03.440]  bowing and they can introduce a bug into that software they can have oversight oh we didn't
[3:37:03.440 --> 3:37:08.000]  figure that you know the sensor would have a glitch or whatever the case may be and then you have
[3:37:08.000 --> 3:37:14.240]  the pilot in at the flight deck and that pilot is like i don't want to pitch the nose down but the
[3:37:14.240 --> 3:37:20.160]  software is pitching the nose down because the pilot doesn't have control over the the rudder
[3:37:21.040 --> 3:37:26.160]  of the airplane or the ailerons or anything the pilot no longer has control over the physical
[3:37:26.160 --> 3:37:31.040]  flight surfaces of that airplane so the airplane nose dives into the ground bursts into a flame
[3:37:31.040 --> 3:37:37.440]  and makes a giant crater and kills hundreds of people this is a very an eerily accurate metaphor
[3:37:37.440 --> 3:37:41.680]  for what's happening across society right now because we have not reached the point of such
[3:37:41.680 --> 3:37:49.120]  complexity that nobody is in control anymore nobody is at the controls nobody can get anything
[3:37:49.120 --> 3:37:54.560]  done that makes any sense for example if we were a simple society and we were suffering an invasion
[3:37:54.560 --> 3:37:59.440]  of illegal immigrants coming across the border occupying and invading our nation the simple
[3:37:59.440 --> 3:38:06.320]  decision would be well of course build a wall put soldiers on the border how hard is that to figure
[3:38:06.320 --> 3:38:12.880]  out and yet here we are in america today a complex society we are paralyzed we can't get it done even
[3:38:12.880 --> 3:38:18.640]  when the president wants to get it done have all this budgeting we have all these debates and fake
[3:38:18.640 --> 3:38:24.800]  news information sources we have you know the the courts that are trying to interfere with
[3:38:24.800 --> 3:38:30.800]  common sense all the time the liberal court judges so we we are not at the controls anymore
[3:38:30.800 --> 3:38:36.080]  we can't just say hey build the wall and put people on the border put soldiers on the border
[3:38:36.080 --> 3:38:40.720]  deploy the military for some reason we are no longer able to do that in the same way that the
[3:38:40.720 --> 3:38:46.240]  pilot of that Boeing airplane is not able to say stop pitching the nose down so we are all on a
[3:38:46.240 --> 3:38:52.960]  suicide mission because we are a complex society that has lost touch with reality that's what this
[3:38:52.960 --> 3:38:59.760]  book talks about the collapse of complex societies by joseph tainter now this book looked at over
[3:39:00.320 --> 3:39:07.120]  200 civilizations throughout human history the collapse of all these civilizations it has one
[3:39:07.120 --> 3:39:14.240]  thing in common they became too complex too much bureaucracy long logistics and supply lines
[3:39:14.240 --> 3:39:21.120]  too much centralization taking power out of the hands of the individuals who knew what they were
[3:39:21.120 --> 3:39:25.920]  doing when farmers don't get to make decisions about what food they wish to grow and the government
[3:39:25.920 --> 3:39:31.360]  is telling them what to grow i.e. north korea you get mass starvation and a food collapse right
[3:39:31.920 --> 3:39:36.880]  when economic decisions are no longer allowed to be made by small businesses such as setting
[3:39:36.880 --> 3:39:40.880]  their own wages for employees and instead you have a centralized government that's making all
[3:39:40.880 --> 3:39:47.440]  the decisions for you you have economic collapse mass unemployment a homelessness and so on when
[3:39:47.440 --> 3:39:53.040]  when centralization creates believe it or not complexity because now you have to have this
[3:39:53.040 --> 3:39:58.320]  incredible bureaucracy to run everything and you're taking away decisions from the people
[3:39:58.320 --> 3:40:03.040]  on the street and people in the businesses you know people real people who can make better
[3:40:03.040 --> 3:40:06.960]  decisions because they have better information right there they are the ones who see what's
[3:40:06.960 --> 3:40:10.560]  happening in their communities they see what's happening in their businesses they see what's
[3:40:10.560 --> 3:40:16.000]  happening on the streets or in their local schools as centralization happens in societies you take
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:22.640]  away all of that control and that autonomy you have mass centralization dictatorial control
[3:40:22.640 --> 3:40:29.200]  over education over economies of banking finance technology medicine you name it that's what
[3:40:29.200 --> 3:40:35.760]  obama care was it was medicine a medical dictatorship it in essence and that's why
[3:40:35.760 --> 3:40:41.760]  it failed because these ideas don't work so then as you centralize things you create a
[3:40:41.760 --> 3:40:49.280]  society that has no redundancy you create long complex supply lines and the logistics become
[3:40:49.280 --> 3:40:55.280]  unsustainable and then one little weakness in the system cascades to a system of failures
[3:40:55.280 --> 3:41:01.920]  across the entire system and that's how you get venezuela and socialism is it is a philosophy of
[3:41:01.920 --> 3:41:08.720]  collapse it's a philosophy of human suicide socialism and communism it always ends in
[3:41:08.720 --> 3:41:14.720]  collapse because it must by definition this is what it commands it it it demands that people give
[3:41:14.720 --> 3:41:19.680]  up all of their rights and all of their individual decisions and it creates this highly complex
[3:41:19.680 --> 3:41:25.200]  society multiple layers of bureaucracy that no one can survive that can't even deliver food to
[3:41:25.200 --> 3:41:30.000]  people i mean venezuela's sitting on a gold mine of free oil all you got to do is pump it out of
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:35.200]  the ground and you have endless abundance and yet they can't even do that because of socialism
[3:41:36.080 --> 3:41:40.000]  that's what's happening and it's happening globally and when you look at migrant populations
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:44.080]  now that are fleeing into the united states they're fleeing el salvador they're they're
[3:41:44.080 --> 3:41:48.560]  fleeing central and south american countries they're fleeing the middle east much of what's
[3:41:48.560 --> 3:41:54.800]  happening is people fleeing the collapse of complex societies and as they are fleeing these
[3:41:54.800 --> 3:42:01.520]  collapsing nations they are causing a cascading collapse throughout the system and this is why
[3:42:01.520 --> 3:42:08.960]  western nations like france and and the uk and germany and the united states are now next in line
[3:42:08.960 --> 3:42:15.760]  to suffer the cascading collapse it is a tidal wave of human incompetence it's a tidal wave of
[3:42:15.760 --> 3:42:23.520]  government corruption a tidal wave of unsustainable complexity in every facet of a society the culture
[3:42:23.520 --> 3:42:30.560]  will collapse the medical systems will collapse economics will collapse science and technology
[3:42:30.560 --> 3:42:35.040]  is in the process of beginning to crumble in many ways as we're seeing like with bowing as a good
[3:42:35.040 --> 3:42:41.200]  example i'm here to tell you this is only going to accelerate after this break i'm gonna try to
[3:42:41.200 --> 3:42:45.040]  share with you maybe some things you can do to survive what's coming because it's going to get

[3:47:17.840 --> 3:47:23.040]  it's mike adams you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:23.040 --> 3:47:30.560]  so some of the signs that are now rather obvious that the collapse has begun and it is accelerating
[3:47:30.560 --> 3:47:37.120]  include the fact that alex sandrel class of portes are actually in congress when you have
[3:47:37.120 --> 3:47:44.240]  a cognitive moron who is making law for the country and you had some voters actually vote
[3:47:44.240 --> 3:47:49.040]  for her even though it was just it was a very small number uh that's a sign that the collapse
[3:47:49.040 --> 3:47:54.560]  is here because you you no longer have rationality you have the collapse of reason you have the
[3:47:54.560 --> 3:47:59.120]  collapse of education i mean doesn't she even have a master's degree or something and yet
[3:47:59.120 --> 3:48:06.400]  she talks like a valley girl high school girl and she thinks like a six-year-old like a six-year-old
[3:48:06.400 --> 3:48:11.120]  walks around and says oh mommy i wish i wish no one would ever suffer mommy i wish everybody
[3:48:11.120 --> 3:48:15.600]  would have something to eat mommy i wish i wish the weather would be nice every day and there
[3:48:15.600 --> 3:48:20.640]  would never be flooding in hurricanes that's that's sort of the mindset of people like ocasio
[3:48:20.640 --> 3:48:27.440]  portes it is an infantile idiotic mindset why are these people making laws in our country why is
[3:48:27.440 --> 3:48:33.840]  she featured as a speaker everywhere and on the cover of magazines it's it's insane when you've got
[3:48:35.440 --> 3:48:42.320]  this kind of idiocy going on and then you have the corruption of people like adam schiff you know
[3:48:42.320 --> 3:48:49.520]  that collapse is near and you know on ocasio cortez she pushes her green new deal and she says she's
[3:48:49.520 --> 3:48:56.560]  in favor of recycling and i don't know if you knew this but recycling programs all across
[3:48:56.560 --> 3:49:02.560]  liberal cities today they are collecting you know all the plastic and then they're just burning it all
[3:49:02.560 --> 3:49:08.000]  they're just incinerating the plastic so in many liberal cities across america today the recycling
[3:49:08.000 --> 3:49:14.960]  program is a total joke it's complete theater they used to sell the plastic to china which
[3:49:14.960 --> 3:49:19.520]  purchased you know large amounts of thousands maybe millions of tons of plastic in bulk
[3:49:19.520 --> 3:49:24.000]  well china stopped purchasing the plastic they don't want our trash anymore apparently
[3:49:24.000 --> 3:49:29.280]  and so these liberal cities they still have their citizens oh sort out your your cans and your plastic
[3:49:29.280 --> 3:49:34.960]  bottles and sort everything out be a good citizen and then they just burn it they just incinerate it
[3:49:34.960 --> 3:49:42.240]  in like near your neighborhood so it's it's insane you might as well just gather up all your plastic
[3:49:42.240 --> 3:49:46.160]  and set fire to it in your own backyard because that's exactly what cities are doing i'm not saying
[3:49:46.160 --> 3:49:53.360]  you should do that but that's what cities are doing but it gets even worse so again aoc and
[3:49:53.360 --> 3:49:59.280]  people like her they claim to be in favor of recycling well what about child recycling sounds
[3:49:59.280 --> 3:50:03.840]  like something they would like right child recycling yeah you should recycle children so this
[3:50:03.840 --> 3:50:11.200]  is from dhs secretary christian nielson she was on with tucker carlson last night talking about how
[3:50:11.200 --> 3:50:17.840]  traffickers across the open border are engaged in child recycling and what they do is they
[3:50:17.840 --> 3:50:23.040]  kidnap children in central and south america i sort of mentioned this in the last segment but let
[3:50:23.040 --> 3:50:29.040]  me read you a quote from nielson here she says quote we broken up so-called child recycling rings
[3:50:29.040 --> 3:50:34.000]  if you can believe it in the last couple of months which is where smugglers kidnap a child they give
[3:50:34.000 --> 3:50:39.040]  it to an adult to cross the border and they present themselves as a family and then once
[3:50:39.040 --> 3:50:43.840]  they get in because you know we can only hold families for 20 days they send the child back
[3:50:43.840 --> 3:50:49.040]  and then they bring the child back with another family another fake family another adult so this
[3:50:49.040 --> 3:50:57.040]  is called child recycling and this is how children are kidnapped and trafficked and abused and used
[3:50:57.040 --> 3:51:02.720]  over and over and over again because of the open borders and this is what democrats support
[3:51:02.720 --> 3:51:09.040]  they love this idea they love that that they can get more voters in by having children kidnapped
[3:51:09.040 --> 3:51:15.520]  and then you know have fake families demand asylum and be given voting rights in places like
[3:51:15.520 --> 3:51:23.040]  california and just as a side note by the way we should that california should be
[3:51:23.040 --> 3:51:31.760]  should be ostracized from the electoral college california electoral votes should not count
[3:51:31.760 --> 3:51:37.920]  until they have a voter id law in place and stop giving illegals the right to vote california senators
[3:51:37.920 --> 3:51:42.160]  should be barred from the senate california members of congress should be barred from the house
[3:51:43.040 --> 3:51:48.560]  california is not following election laws those are not american votes those are
[3:51:48.560 --> 3:51:54.800]  illegals voting in california's elections they should be barred from participating in our electoral
[3:51:54.800 --> 3:52:00.480]  process why should illegals in california who also by the way skew the whole census program
[3:52:01.040 --> 3:52:06.720]  why should they be able to out vote you and me we are real american citizens we paid taxes we
[3:52:06.720 --> 3:52:12.320]  grew up in this culture we you know we we've been americans our whole lives why should some
[3:52:12.320 --> 3:52:18.400]  illegal kidnap a child come in claim that they're a family get asylum get voting rights in california
[3:52:18.400 --> 3:52:23.520]  and then out vote you that makes no sense whatsoever so i'm all for saying california
[3:52:24.320 --> 3:52:31.120]  like a forced secession of the electoral process in california just bar all california senators
[3:52:31.120 --> 3:52:34.720]  bar bar all california electoral votes that's what we need to do
[3:52:35.920 --> 3:52:41.280]  but there you go child recycling rings that's happening in america right now and that's directly
[3:52:41.280 --> 3:52:48.800]  from dhs secretary kirsten nielsen right uh other news today we've got the usda has now
[3:52:48.800 --> 3:52:55.280]  announced that they're going to stop their cannibal cats experiments where they were having cats eat
[3:52:55.280 --> 3:53:01.920]  other cats like kittens to see what would happen this is part of the usda the usda has long been
[3:53:01.920 --> 3:53:06.640]  involved in the mass killing and genocide business that used to have a program called
[3:53:06.640 --> 3:53:11.600]  buy buy blackbird where they would kill hundreds of millions of blackbirds all across america
[3:53:11.600 --> 3:53:16.640]  by feeding them poison and this is this is what the government does the government has long
[3:53:16.640 --> 3:53:22.560]  been in the business of genocide killing off whatever they don't like animal species sometimes
[3:53:22.560 --> 3:53:29.120]  and you know pretty soon most of humanity this is what they are doing so they said they're going
[3:53:29.120 --> 3:53:34.560]  to stop the experiments on kittens most americans have no idea that they were running experiments
[3:53:34.560 --> 3:53:39.440]  on kittens but guess what the government's still running experiments on you and your children
[3:53:40.160 --> 3:53:45.440]  and this is especially true in the lgbt community where you have the transgender medical experiments
[3:53:45.440 --> 3:53:53.200]  on children so imagine this you have a child that's like nine years old let's say and then
[3:53:53.200 --> 3:53:59.120]  somehow she's watching tv and and she's convinced that she's a he or the other way around and she
[3:53:59.120 --> 3:54:05.280]  wants to be a transgender well the the drug companies and now the psychologists and even the schools
[3:54:05.280 --> 3:54:12.080]  are pushing for the permanent surgical maiming and chemical castration of these children and these
[3:54:12.080 --> 3:54:17.120]  protocols and we recently published an article about this on natural news i forgot the title but
[3:54:17.120 --> 3:54:23.120]  these protocols are extremely dangerous to children they cause heart valve problems and heart
[3:54:23.120 --> 3:54:29.120]  disease and cardiovascular disorders these chemicals are deadly very dangerous chemical
[3:54:29.120 --> 3:54:34.880]  castration castrators and the surgical procedures are of course irreversible so you know you take
[3:54:34.880 --> 3:54:41.440]  a young male child and you convince him that he's a girl because that's the cool in thing now
[3:54:42.000 --> 3:54:46.960]  in our collapsing culture and then you have them undergo you know transgender quote reassignment
[3:54:46.960 --> 3:54:54.640]  surgery well it's physically maiming it's cutting off the genitals of a young boy and and and dosing
[3:54:54.640 --> 3:55:03.360]  him up with you know castration chemicals to alter him to conform to an insane deranged society
[3:55:03.360 --> 3:55:09.040]  of left-wing lunatics who are trafficking children and they're sexually molesting children they are
[3:55:09.040 --> 3:55:15.200]  pedophiles and they are now medically maiming children because that's what fits their narrative
[3:55:15.200 --> 3:55:19.760]  and there is no better example of the collapse of our society right now the collapse of western
[3:55:19.760 --> 3:55:26.240]  culture when you have like Teen Vogue magazine out there with videos of young teens saying that
[3:55:26.240 --> 3:55:31.600]  that binary is BS saying that there's no such thing as a man or a woman saying that you can
[3:55:31.600 --> 3:55:35.680]  choose whatever gender you want at any time and then all your physical organs magically become
[3:55:35.680 --> 3:55:41.440]  female organs or male organs depending on your mood that is insane that is a collapse of society
[3:55:41.440 --> 3:55:46.000]  and that's that's being pushed aggressively everywhere through every school every university
[3:55:46.000 --> 3:55:52.000]  every left-wing media outlet this is child abuse on a scale that we have never seen before in this
[3:55:52.000 --> 3:55:58.000]  society and by the way as another side note if there's no such thing as a man or a woman
[3:55:58.000 --> 3:56:03.920]  as the left says then why are they celebrating like women's history month what does it even mean
[3:56:03.920 --> 3:56:07.280]  if they say there's no such thing as a woman or if anybody can be a woman
[3:56:07.280 --> 3:56:13.680]  what how does it mean anything you know i mean it's again i i honor women for who they are real
[3:56:13.680 --> 3:56:19.920]  women i honor individuals for who they are but to say that there's no such thing as a man or
[3:56:19.920 --> 3:56:24.960]  woman and then to selectively celebrate women is a meaningless exercise but that's that's the
[3:56:24.960 --> 3:56:29.920]  kind of derangement that the left engages in constantly because all rationality is gone
[3:56:29.920 --> 3:56:35.200]  they are lunatics we're talking about mass mental illness combined with pedophilia child
[3:56:35.200 --> 3:56:41.680]  trafficking you know rampant corruption and abuse of the system that's what the left has become so
[3:56:42.480 --> 3:56:45.760]  i didn't get to everything i wanted to get to in terms of preparing for collapse
[3:56:46.560 --> 3:56:51.520]  i do have a sunday show here on info wars it's called counterthink it airs every sunday 6 p.m
[3:56:51.520 --> 3:56:57.200]  central you can also see other episodes you may have missed at counterthink.com and we'll discuss
[3:56:57.200 --> 3:57:03.040]  surviving the coming collapse more at counterthink.com in those videos as well bottom line is get
[3:57:03.040 --> 3:57:08.320]  ready the insanity is only going to accelerate the collapse is going to get much worse if you're

[3:57:12.160 --> 3:57:16.880]  steamrolled you're going to be overrun they're going to take everything they won't leave you

[3:57:20.800 --> 3:57:25.680]  a firearm you won't even be allowed to live if you're a white male christian they're going to
[3:57:25.680 --> 3:57:31.120]  have mass executions and mass genocide all across this country that's their plan make no mistake
[3:57:31.120 --> 3:57:36.240]  that's what's coming unless we rise up and stop it that's the show today thanks for watching mike
[3:57:36.240 --> 3:57:46.960]  adams here info wars.com there are thousands of ideologies out there hundreds of different
