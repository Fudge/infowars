[00:00.000 --> 00:24.000]  How you like me now?
[00:24.000 --> 00:37.760]  It's Tuesday, the 26th day of June 2018, and I come in here occasionally every few months
[00:37.760 --> 00:42.320]  and I say this may be the most important broadcast I've ever done.
[00:42.320 --> 00:45.760]  I used to say that every couple of years, but there's a quickening, a lot of big things
[00:45.760 --> 00:51.200]  happening and everyone knows that Info Wars has its finger on the zeitgeist.
[00:51.200 --> 00:56.560]  You've heard me saying they plan on civil unrest leading to civil war, soft civil war,
[00:56.560 --> 01:02.200]  it's a term I coined about a year and a half ago, watching the enemy's activities, watching
[01:02.200 --> 01:06.160]  what they've done in other countries, knowing that it is, stay behind networks of globalists
[01:06.160 --> 01:12.040]  in the CIA running this, well, the blueprints of how they've done this in other countries
[01:12.040 --> 01:17.400]  and then how they've operated here domestically are crystal clear.
[01:17.400 --> 01:24.480]  But yesterday, if you'll remember, I rebroadcast about Happen Show because I was so pregnant
[01:24.480 --> 01:32.320]  and thought that I was not saying at all or not giving you the future because I've already
[01:32.320 --> 01:37.160]  told you what was coming and then now it's here, so I need to stop proving I was right
[01:37.160 --> 01:39.800]  and I need to tell you what's going to happen.
[01:39.800 --> 01:44.680]  Now the White House watches, the Pentagon watches, and they've got a good idea as well,
[01:44.680 --> 01:51.800]  but I'm going to lay out exactly what Mueller is going to do, I'm going to lay out exactly
[01:51.800 --> 01:56.760]  what Pelosi is going to do, I'm going to lay out exactly what Brennan and Clapper and
[01:56.760 --> 02:05.040]  all the usual suspects and Comey are going to do.
[02:05.040 --> 02:13.920]  And we've got their battle plan, so this is a big deal, we need to lay it all out because
[02:13.920 --> 02:24.240]  this is undoubtedly up to this point, most important broadcast that I've ever done.
[02:24.240 --> 02:31.920]  And it is incumbent on everyone to understand why they're trying to squeeze down Info Wars
[02:31.920 --> 02:39.000]  and why they're trying to block us is because they know our talking points are dead on and
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.240]  will torpedo their entire agenda.
[02:41.240 --> 02:49.160]  They know that if the talking points get to the President, who is now back to doing whatever
[02:49.160 --> 02:55.400]  he wants that they're done, now Trump already has great instincts and doesn't need me to
[02:55.400 --> 03:05.360]  tell him what to do, but I have been asked to present what I think to the military,
[03:05.360 --> 03:11.880]  the police and everyone else, and I'm going to do that.
[03:11.880 --> 03:18.040]  And it's a big responsibility, but I can tell you that this is the only broadcast out there
[03:18.040 --> 03:19.360]  that's doing anything like this.
[03:19.360 --> 03:23.360]  Sean Hannity has begun to do some of it, that's wonderful, that's why they want him off the
[03:23.360 --> 03:24.360]  air.
[03:24.360 --> 03:29.840]  Tucker Carlson's son, that's great, but they are under a lot of pressure.
[03:29.840 --> 03:36.160]  I know for a fact, Hannity was almost thrown out a year ago, but he didn't back down.
[03:36.160 --> 03:41.400]  So I'm just telling you that there is a very small fraternity of people that will even
[03:41.400 --> 03:42.760]  go near the reality.
[03:42.760 --> 03:48.920]  And I have been asked because other people are waiting, I have to do it first.
[03:48.920 --> 03:51.160]  You understand that?
[03:51.160 --> 03:54.320]  And I thought it was like when Soros would put this in his publications constantly and
[03:54.320 --> 03:57.320]  saying they're following Jones' talking points, we've got to shut him down.
[03:57.320 --> 04:00.960]  And I thought, oh, well, they just think I'm just discrediting, so they're always focusing
[04:00.960 --> 04:02.280]  on me as a way to hurt Trump.
[04:02.280 --> 04:03.280]  That's not what it is.
[04:03.280 --> 04:05.000]  They've got it figured out.
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.160]  And it is a real revelation.
[04:08.160 --> 04:12.360]  It's also a sickening burden.
[04:12.360 --> 04:16.400]  The average little narcissistic devil worshiper out there would just love to have power because
[04:16.400 --> 04:18.080]  they have no idea what they even do with it.
[04:18.080 --> 04:24.400]  I'd be like one of the minions and despicable me blowing itself up with TNT or something.
[04:24.400 --> 04:27.600]  So this is big stuff, and I just have to tell you how big it is.
[04:27.600 --> 04:35.000]  I can't just sit here and put out the info and then not tell you that it is the info.
[04:35.000 --> 04:36.960]  It is the info.
[04:36.960 --> 04:38.720]  And it is the future.
[04:38.720 --> 04:41.520]  And if you have the enemy battle plan, you should be able to stop it.
[04:41.520 --> 04:44.800]  So I've told you everything up till now, it was going to happen, and it's happened 98%
[04:44.800 --> 04:45.800]  like I said.
[04:45.800 --> 04:48.640]  But we can change the future.
[04:48.640 --> 04:49.880]  It's choose your own adventure.
[04:49.880 --> 04:54.080]  So when we come back, I'm going to brief the world, the military, the police, everybody
[04:54.080 --> 05:00.760]  about possible futures, infowars.com, newswars.com, stay with us.

[06:25.440 --> 06:28.600]  It's Tuesday, June 26, 2018.
[06:28.600 --> 06:37.880]  I'm about to brief the listeners, the viewers, the president, other individuals watching around
[06:37.880 --> 06:44.040]  the world about the current best estimates on the globalist attack plan for Europe and
[06:44.040 --> 06:46.000]  the United States.
[06:46.000 --> 06:51.840]  As many of the people in our government already know, we're in the midst of World War Four.
[06:51.840 --> 06:55.680]  World War Three, of course, is what the CIA called the Cold War.
[06:55.680 --> 06:59.840]  World War Four is by megacorporations against individual nations and the family and the human
[06:59.840 --> 07:01.440]  biological system itself.
[07:01.440 --> 07:08.840]  It is a complete technotronic, technocracy, genetic takeover of the planet itself in the
[07:08.840 --> 07:12.640]  words of Google and the other technocrats.
[07:12.640 --> 07:18.720]  They are planning to fully implode the third world nations that they control.
[07:18.720 --> 07:23.600]  They've been exploding for decades.
[07:23.600 --> 07:28.280]  They have put in policies in the third world to double their populations and then deploy
[07:28.280 --> 07:36.600]  those populations against the West in a giant cloud and piven type program to bankrupt the
[07:36.600 --> 07:45.880]  social compact and bring the world back into a new dark age of collapsed austerity and starvation
[07:45.880 --> 07:49.480]  that will depopulate at least 80% of the Earth.
[07:49.480 --> 07:57.320]  There will then be a de-evolution to city-states, corporate city-states, corporate islands that
[07:57.320 --> 08:02.880]  will be high-tech breakaway civilization oases.
[08:02.880 --> 08:07.440]  Now, I've been telling viewers and listeners about this for 20-plus years because it's
[08:07.440 --> 08:08.960]  in the globalist white papers.
[08:08.960 --> 08:14.880]  But we're here now and they are executing the operation.
[08:14.880 --> 08:23.320]  Now, their operation is being executed while sane individuals in our governments, in corporations
[08:23.320 --> 08:30.480]  and in government, military, private life have seen enough of the plan.
[08:30.480 --> 08:31.480]  They know how bad it is.
[08:31.480 --> 08:34.840]  They've known about it for a long time, but they've been bullied, intimidated, attacked.
[08:34.840 --> 08:40.040]  So, patriots in the last few decades have gone out and recruited and started organizations
[08:40.040 --> 08:45.400]  around the world like UKIP and others and what Ron Paul and others did to begin for
[08:45.400 --> 08:50.120]  the preparation and defense against the main globalist move, which they always, again,
[08:50.120 --> 08:54.720]  would deny was happening so we would be flat-footed, but we were not caught completely flat-footed.
[08:54.720 --> 08:59.440]  In fact, the globalists were caught flat-footed when they went to their main launch.
[08:59.440 --> 09:01.960]  Everything else had been preparation.
[09:01.960 --> 09:14.440]  So we are here and currently the West is under total attack using humanity, using huge streams
[09:14.440 --> 09:23.960]  of desperate people leaving collapsed globalist-controlled systems like Venezuela, Cuba, the collapsing
[09:23.960 --> 09:28.800]  Middle East, which, again, seven years ago Obama and Hillary on record triggered to collapse
[09:28.800 --> 09:33.920]  good governments, moderate governments to destroy economic infrastructures in four different
[09:33.920 --> 09:37.360]  nations that were stabilizing all the Middle East and Africa.
[09:37.360 --> 09:43.520]  This is an admitted post-industrialization sabotage plan to then collapse Africa, collapse
[09:43.520 --> 09:49.080]  the Middle East, use that for destabilization to begin to collapse the civil unrest into
[09:49.080 --> 09:54.560]  the stands, into Russia, into Asia, collapsing into Western Europe, collapsing the United
[09:54.560 --> 09:57.560]  States, using Latin America.
[09:57.560 --> 09:59.280]  This is all a plan.
[09:59.280 --> 10:07.960]  And Ronald Reagan was briefed on the plan in 1983 when they discovered that the Democratic
[10:07.960 --> 10:11.720]  Party was already having meetings with the Ford Foundation, this has all been in congressional
[10:11.720 --> 10:17.880]  hearings, you can pull them up on YouTube, and they were planning to use giant third-world
[10:17.880 --> 10:21.560]  populations that they would bring into the U.S., turn against the U.S., have them racially
[10:21.560 --> 10:26.440]  identify against whites, and then basically have a weatherman style, you've seen the tapes
[10:26.440 --> 10:32.280]  of the weatherman talking about having a collapse, and then having a race war in America that
[10:32.280 --> 10:35.360]  then allows the U.N. to come in to stabilize things.
[10:35.360 --> 10:41.400]  Well, we've now seen a replay of that plan.
[10:41.400 --> 10:48.880]  We've now seen that, and the left in PBS went, oh my God, look, FEMA camps, Rex 84, to put
[10:48.880 --> 10:53.520]  whole families in these things, and even back when I was first waking up, people would
[10:53.520 --> 10:57.440]  deny that that was real, but I knew it was in government documents and congressional hearings
[10:57.440 --> 10:58.440]  that I'd read about newspapers.
[10:58.440 --> 11:02.400]  It wasn't until years later, I actually saw the video that had been on C-SPAN years before
[11:02.400 --> 11:06.760]  that I'd missed that somebody had archived.
[11:06.760 --> 11:10.760]  And so then I realized that Reagan wasn't perked by any yardstick, but they put in
[11:10.760 --> 11:16.840]  Rex 84 to activate U.S. military bases, if we got hit with 25 million people, if Latin
[11:16.840 --> 11:21.800]  America collapsed, as part of a globalist communist plot, that they would have to then
[11:21.800 --> 11:26.720]  house all these people and not let the disruption be triggered to then burn down cities and
[11:26.720 --> 11:32.480]  bring in the leftist breakdown of society and civil unrest that they wanted for a civil
[11:32.480 --> 11:33.480]  war.
[11:33.480 --> 11:38.040]  You can go read synopses in the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Miami Herald of Rex
[11:38.040 --> 11:44.760]  84, much of it's been declassified, garden plot, cable splicer, and then if you read
[11:44.760 --> 11:50.040]  the news today, you see Trump is implementing the beginning stages of Rex 84, and it would
[11:50.040 --> 11:53.760]  be called Rex 2018 or Rex 18 today.
[11:53.760 --> 11:59.080]  So Trump has implemented, probably has the same name, Rex 18.
[11:59.080 --> 12:01.800]  And again, it shows how you learn things as you get older.
[12:01.800 --> 12:08.480]  That is a U.S. stabilization emergency program, and it's an active measure preparation training
[12:08.480 --> 12:14.000]  scenario that they've been carrying out at least since 1984 that has now gone live.
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.560]  Now, it's not martial law as the left advertised it, and again this showed how I didn't understand
[12:19.560 --> 12:21.680]  when I was reading 25 years ago.
[12:21.680 --> 12:27.400]  This was the preparation, if they tried to have a civil war, to simply be able to house
[12:27.400 --> 12:30.240]  the giant populations during a collapse event.
[12:30.240 --> 12:35.520]  The same thing they're doing in Europe, bringing in over 10 million military aged men, building
[12:35.520 --> 12:39.800]  the migrant bases, inviting everyone in to collapse the borders, to collapse the social
[12:39.800 --> 12:45.520]  safety net, so the U.N. can come in and announce an emergency reorganization of the E.U., an
[12:45.520 --> 12:53.120]  emergency reorganization of North America, which is in Reuters today, U.N. to present
[12:53.120 --> 12:58.440]  plan for Mediterranean migrant centers and an E.U. Army, which they've already set up,
[12:58.440 --> 13:03.240]  to block the nation states stopping the Islamists pouring in.
[13:03.240 --> 13:09.880]  So again, there's thousands of angles and points, but I'm trying to give a condensed
[13:09.880 --> 13:14.760]  synopsis of this, and then the most important point when we come back from break, is I'm
[13:14.760 --> 13:18.800]  mainly briefing the general public at this point, the President knows all this, obviously.
[13:18.800 --> 13:23.560]  What has to be understood is the Democrats, by their action, their body language, their
[13:23.560 --> 13:32.160]  telecommunications, their signals, their demeanor, and their previous activity, indicating future
[13:32.160 --> 13:39.680]  activity, and all of their preparations show that Antifa has withdrawn and is prepping
[13:39.680 --> 13:44.560]  for assassinations, brutal attacks, they're going to hit, they're going to hit hard.
[13:44.560 --> 13:48.680]  They are preparing arson, they're preparing to attack police stations, they're just the
[13:48.680 --> 13:53.920]  front for other more professional paramilitary teams that are going to be in behind them,
[13:53.920 --> 13:56.520]  they're just the throwaway decoys.
[13:56.520 --> 14:02.920]  And as of now, the deep state, the globalist, and you see it everywhere, are preparing the
[14:02.920 --> 14:08.960]  atmosphere by the middle of August, late August, unless we get the word out and back them down
[14:08.960 --> 14:16.640]  and stop them, they're going to trigger from soft civil war to real civil war, and then
[14:16.640 --> 14:25.080]  Mueller in September is going to begin a WikiLeaks-type cascade where he begins to dribble out fake
[14:25.080 --> 14:33.000]  news and disinfo about Trump being a Russian agent, corruption, women's scandals, Rodgers
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.200]  Stone stuff, Alex Jones stuff, he's joining us by the hour, exclusive of what they're
[14:36.200 --> 14:37.560]  now looking into.
[14:37.560 --> 14:42.040]  My filmmaking, Joel Gilbert's filmmaking, the FBI's considering saying our films are
[14:42.040 --> 14:45.880]  criminal and are political speech that are criminal, they already tried to charge Gilbert
[14:45.880 --> 14:49.840]  before, remember three years ago, saying he violated campaign finance law.
[14:49.840 --> 14:53.680]  So they're looking at criminal charges against me, and you have to understand, this will
[14:53.680 --> 14:57.520]  be during martial law and burning cities and Trump being assassinated or being forced
[14:57.520 --> 14:58.520]  to step down.
[14:58.520 --> 15:02.360]  So you're like, well, that'll never happen, no, no, they're getting the charges and everything
[15:02.360 --> 15:05.200]  lined up for thousands of people.
[15:05.200 --> 15:10.280]  Now a lot of us will just get hit at 3 a.m., so I'm telling you, they're going to begin
[15:10.280 --> 15:14.600]  triggering in August, maybe even earlier because we're exposing it, and it's not launching
[15:14.600 --> 15:17.400]  well, it's not going well right now.
[15:17.400 --> 15:21.400]  Then by September, middle of September, they're going to start releasing all the stuff on
[15:21.400 --> 15:26.440]  Trump that's made up and cooked up, and you've got senators canning at that, buckle up for
[15:26.440 --> 15:31.720]  more, Robert Mueller, Russia revelations, key Senate Democrats, you know, says at a
[15:31.720 --> 15:36.680]  party, blah, blah, blah, Senator Mark Warner, oh, and just like we heard from Tom Arnold
[15:36.680 --> 15:40.760]  that, oh, he was going to be with Cohen and he was going to bring down Trump and Cohen
[15:40.760 --> 15:42.760]  had all the dirt, it was a hoax.
[15:42.760 --> 15:48.280]  They're just going to launch a bunch of hoaxes coming up in September into October, and they'll
[15:48.280 --> 15:52.360]  either try to have them via the 25th Amendment, as they've already announced, have Trump stand
[15:52.360 --> 15:56.120]  down and have his cabinet turn against him, and if that doesn't work, they will probably
[15:56.120 --> 15:59.840]  blow up the White House or shoot down his aircraft.
[15:59.840 --> 16:04.320]  Disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[16:04.320 --> 16:08.480]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[16:08.480 --> 16:13.360]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[16:13.360 --> 16:16.760]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[20:03.960 --> 20:14.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:14.840 --> 20:36.280]  Now continuing with my emergency briefing to the planet and to all the Patriots around
[20:36.280 --> 20:40.840]  the world and here in the U.S. that want to have prosperous nation stage with true open
[20:40.840 --> 20:42.120]  free societies.
[20:42.120 --> 20:47.000]  We are witnessing the corporate world government assault on Europe, Australia, the U.K., the
[20:47.000 --> 20:51.680]  U.S. with hundreds of millions of illegals.
[20:51.680 --> 20:56.960]  You've seen Macron talk about the leprosy of the West and the leprosy of nationalism.
[20:56.960 --> 21:02.480]  That's the president of France and saying we're going to bring in 200 million people
[21:02.480 --> 21:05.360]  from the Middle East and Africa in the next decade.
[21:05.360 --> 21:08.360]  You're like, well, that's almost the population of Europe.
[21:08.360 --> 21:11.240]  90% of them don't even ever get jobs.
[21:11.240 --> 21:14.920]  It's total economic warfare.
[21:14.920 --> 21:20.520]  Now, let me get back to the briefing here and then I'm going to come back and go through
[21:20.520 --> 21:25.240]  all the documentation and all the evidence of it, but I'm giving you the boil down here.
[21:25.240 --> 21:33.320]  Remember a year ago, a year ago, I said Antifa is getting the names of federal law enforcement,
[21:33.320 --> 21:38.640]  especially ICE, and they're getting the names of conservative police and judges, and they
[21:38.640 --> 21:44.040]  are going to kill you if they are allowed to.
[21:44.040 --> 21:48.000]  And now Antifa has doxxed Chloe Given inside knowledge, and who is Antifa?
[21:48.000 --> 21:52.360]  They're government employees, people like Reality Winner, they're tenured professors
[21:52.360 --> 21:55.680]  that go out in disguises and do this.
[21:55.680 --> 22:00.800]  And this has all just been preparation, and the real Antifa only puts their little method
[22:00.800 --> 22:05.640]  decoys out while they watch the police and they watch the public.
[22:05.640 --> 22:08.520]  And so remember a year ago, I told you that, and I told you they were preparing it, and
[22:08.520 --> 22:13.760]  the New York Times said I was insane and there was no call by Antifa to overthrow the government,
[22:13.760 --> 22:20.280]  even though they'd run a full page ad in the New York Times saying overthrow the president
[22:20.280 --> 22:21.280]  physically.
[22:21.280 --> 22:25.960]  And you go, yeah, that was weird.
[22:25.960 --> 22:28.000]  Why did they do that?
[22:28.000 --> 22:31.080]  And then why did they deny it at the same time?
[22:31.080 --> 22:36.800]  Because you tell your people get ready for war, gear up, but then when the other side
[22:36.800 --> 22:39.240]  starts getting ready, you go, oh, I'm not going to attack.
[22:39.240 --> 22:46.440]  That is a classic tactic because it gets enough people on the other side not to get prepared,
[22:46.440 --> 22:47.440]  not to get ready.
[22:47.440 --> 22:51.760]  And I said they'd fail last year, and I said it was a beta test, but if they couldn't
[22:51.760 --> 22:56.800]  remove him politically, that they would do it physically with Civil War.
[22:56.800 --> 23:01.200]  And now that's the word, the compound word, Civil War.
[23:01.200 --> 23:02.880]  You're hearing it everywhere.
[23:02.880 --> 23:06.080]  Top professors have come out now and said, no, we're in a Civil War.
[23:06.080 --> 23:12.680]  We're not in the early stages, and they're calling for more and more violence.
[23:12.680 --> 23:15.120]  So what does the president need to do?
[23:15.120 --> 23:17.640]  Well, the president's already doing what he has to.
[23:17.640 --> 23:22.520]  He's getting the emergency preparations ready to stabilize the government during this.
[23:22.520 --> 23:24.920]  The police and military are being prepared for it.
[23:24.920 --> 23:30.400]  The problem is they have stacked the ranks of the FBI particularly and many city police
[23:30.400 --> 23:33.920]  departments with actual communists.
[23:33.920 --> 23:37.760]  I mean, Brennan voted on record.
[23:37.760 --> 23:41.680]  There's like Washington Post articles for the Communist Party back in the 70s and was
[23:41.680 --> 23:44.080]  admitted to the CIA because he was one.
[23:44.080 --> 23:46.280]  He's also a hobbyist.
[23:46.280 --> 23:51.680]  And that's the big piece of news here is this article from January 10th of this year is
[23:51.680 --> 23:53.520]  the key to all of this.
[23:53.520 --> 24:03.560]  We have their battle plan here, 25 pages of it from a brother of an Antifa individual
[24:03.560 --> 24:07.360]  who was able to capture the documents and we confirm their authenticity.
[24:07.360 --> 24:08.360]  The media never covered this.
[24:08.360 --> 24:11.160]  They never challenged it.
[24:11.160 --> 24:15.000]  And it is how they were working with major police departments in blue cities, but only
[24:15.000 --> 24:24.760]  with the leadership to allow Antifa to attack police, to allow them to burn and agitate
[24:24.760 --> 24:30.880]  to try to get urban black populations to burn down the cities, but they didn't do it everywhere
[24:30.880 --> 24:31.880]  they tried.
[24:31.880 --> 24:33.680]  You've been seeing Obama try this for a long time.
[24:33.680 --> 24:37.160]  This was 2015 and it's all the admissions.
[24:37.160 --> 24:38.760]  It's George Soros's group.
[24:38.760 --> 24:42.640]  His son Alexander is the general.
[24:42.640 --> 24:43.640]  He runs it.
[24:43.640 --> 24:49.320]  He has the documents and it's how they stage this with the police.
[24:49.320 --> 24:53.800]  It's the action BW-104-18-15.
[24:53.800 --> 24:59.340]  Now you want to go read this, you need to go understand this and it's all the places
[24:59.340 --> 25:00.340]  they targeted.
[25:00.340 --> 25:01.340]  It's what they did.
[25:01.340 --> 25:04.240]  This is criminal racketeering of the highest order.
[25:04.240 --> 25:07.080]  This is espionage against the country.
[25:07.080 --> 25:08.240]  It's trends of democracy.
[25:08.240 --> 25:12.920]  So all of this has been a beta test, but now you see Netflix, every movie, every TV show
[25:12.920 --> 25:19.120]  about violence and uprisings and the purge where the U.S. Army is the KKK and wears clan
[25:19.120 --> 25:21.440]  outfits and comes and kills black people.
[25:21.440 --> 25:26.800]  It's all to create a simulation of people's heads into the summer trying to get everybody
[25:26.800 --> 25:28.080]  angry.
[25:28.080 --> 25:31.880]  Trump did the right thing trying to defuse it, even though it looks like it gave him
[25:31.880 --> 25:32.880]  what they wanted.
[25:32.880 --> 25:35.640]  It defused it because he knew the children weren't being hurt.
[25:35.640 --> 25:41.480]  He knew very few were being separated and so he's trying to defuse them.
[25:41.480 --> 25:46.360]  He's doing the right moral thing, not luring them in to try this.
[25:46.360 --> 25:52.840]  But he's telling Maxine and others, watch out what you do because I'm telling you.
[25:52.840 --> 25:58.960]  Mr. President and everybody else, they are going to try to kill you and they're going
[25:58.960 --> 26:01.440]  to be threatening your family and trying to turn them.
[26:01.440 --> 26:03.840]  They are going to be threatening to kill your family.
[26:03.840 --> 26:05.680]  They are going to target your family.
[26:05.680 --> 26:06.880]  This is a globalist move.
[26:06.880 --> 26:08.800]  They don't care if it looks bad.
[26:08.800 --> 26:11.400]  They don't care how it looks.
[26:11.400 --> 26:14.080]  They are not going to let your family live.
[26:14.080 --> 26:19.240]  They are going to kill everybody in your family when they make their move.
[26:19.240 --> 26:22.000]  And so they're going to go for broke.
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.840]  It's going to be like a malice purge, the weathermen that advised Obama and it came
[26:26.840 --> 26:31.720]  out of course in congressional hearings and Larry Graphwald and others exposed it, who
[26:31.720 --> 26:35.200]  infiltrated them, how they would do all of this back in the 70s was their plan and how
[26:35.200 --> 26:41.760]  they were going to kill 25 million people and put 25 million more in camps.
[26:41.760 --> 26:47.840]  So bottom line, they are going to try to execute this.
[26:47.840 --> 26:50.400]  They are going to try to execute this.
[26:50.400 --> 26:53.880]  And the Justice Department has been captured.
[26:53.880 --> 26:58.520]  Rosenstein's the globalist operative that's been proven for whatever reason, Sessions
[26:58.520 --> 27:03.200]  is compromised or they would have already moved on Soros and his son when we got the
[27:03.200 --> 27:09.640]  criminal proof of what they did.
[27:09.640 --> 27:16.320]  Instead we've got the tech giants and everybody else trying to side with the globalist and
[27:16.320 --> 27:20.560]  you've got all these cowards that think they can appease both sides.
[27:20.560 --> 27:23.720]  So people are telling Trump what he wants to hear about fixing the country and turning
[27:23.720 --> 27:25.920]  it around and not wrecking everything.
[27:25.920 --> 27:30.320]  And other folks are then out of the other side of their mouth going along with the plotters.
[27:30.320 --> 27:32.600]  But I know this.
[27:32.600 --> 27:43.000]  Brennan and all these other people, Clapper, Hayden, Hillary, you guys only hope is to
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.920]  not execute this because you'll never, never get away with it.
[27:47.920 --> 27:51.040]  But that's why they go on TV and say he'll be dead soon, he'll be out soon.
[27:51.040 --> 27:54.080]  This is triggering their people inside the deep state.
[27:54.080 --> 27:55.240]  Hold on, we're going to win.
[27:55.240 --> 27:57.040]  All they do is put on a confidence act.
[27:57.040 --> 27:58.040]  They're losing.
[27:58.040 --> 27:59.680]  The economy is coming back.
[27:59.680 --> 28:01.680]  The sovereignty is coming back.
[28:01.680 --> 28:04.840]  Full numbers for Trump with black Americans are doubling.
[28:04.840 --> 28:07.440]  Thousands of factories are coming back in.
[28:07.440 --> 28:09.600]  Hollywood's imploding.
[28:09.600 --> 28:12.440]  Secret technologies for life extension are beginning to be released.
[28:12.440 --> 28:13.440]  Medical breakthroughs.
[28:13.440 --> 28:16.400]  We've got a guy in there really trying to fix things.
[28:16.400 --> 28:19.360]  And why wouldn't there be some elements of the establishment that didn't want to have
[28:19.360 --> 28:26.360]  a giant globalist orchestrated, mal-style communist operating system for megabanks
[28:26.360 --> 28:31.640]  to totally shred the country and reeducate the U.S. as if you'll ever win when America
[28:31.640 --> 28:35.240] 's whole ethos is about fighting empires and digging in.
[28:35.240 --> 28:41.000]  Yeah, I mean, it's just, you will be destroyed.
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.560]  I don't care if you guys think you're going to sit there in Hawaii or sit over there in
[28:45.560 --> 28:48.640]  Tasmania or Switzerland and escape this.
[28:48.640 --> 28:54.600]  I mean, you are playing a game of chicken and we're not going to turn off the road either.
[28:54.600 --> 28:58.280]  So it's coming down to this toe-to-toe battle with the globalists and the final battle for
[28:58.280 --> 28:59.280]  the republic.
[28:59.280 --> 29:02.560]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.
[29:02.560 --> 29:05.720]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.
[29:05.720 --> 29:07.600]  Get a sunny-bay heating pad.
[29:07.600 --> 29:12.600]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck or back or shoulder.
[29:12.600 --> 29:15.920]  And the best relief for that pain is a sunny-bay heating pad.
[29:15.920 --> 29:19.720]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways
[29:19.720 --> 29:22.280]  to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[29:22.280 --> 29:27.000]  Sunny-bay heating pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.680]  and have a lifetime 100% positive rating on both Amazon and Etsy.
[29:31.680 --> 29:33.200]  Why take another pill?
[29:33.200 --> 29:37.440]  Many people use our sunny-bay heating pads alone and got rid of the neck pain.
[29:37.440 --> 29:42.120]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body.
[29:42.120 --> 29:45.400]  Our homegrown small business tries to help people just like us.
[29:45.400 --> 29:49.480]  That's why we design and test our handmade products with great care before we introduce
[29:49.480 --> 29:50.480]  them to the public.
[29:50.480 --> 29:53.640]  You can easily find sunny-bay heating pads on Amazon.
[29:53.640 --> 30:00.520]  Just go to amazon.com and search for sunny-bay heating pads.
[30:00.520 --> 30:05.120]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home, but sometimes
[30:05.120 --> 30:07.240]  supplements don't work fast enough.
[30:07.240 --> 30:12.080]  That's why InfoWarsLife has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line, Super
[30:12.080 --> 30:14.320]  Blue Silver Immune Gargle.

[32:00.120 --> 32:04.040]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[32:04.040 --> 32:08.560]  The real drama can be found here in Lelani Estates, but a lot of us on the big island
[32:08.560 --> 32:14.000]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[32:14.000 --> 32:19.400]  Big ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[32:19.400 --> 32:20.920]  to unhealthy levels.
[32:20.920 --> 32:27.440]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[32:27.440 --> 32:31.440]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[32:31.440 --> 32:32.760]  in the rainwater.
[32:32.760 --> 32:38.120]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter and not only were the heavy
[32:38.120 --> 32:44.200]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[32:44.200 --> 32:49.840]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[32:49.840 --> 32:55.160]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[32:55.160 --> 33:03.400]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[33:03.400 --> 33:32.040]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:32.040 --> 33:37.600]  We are back and I was laying out the fact that we are in the middle of World War 4.
[33:37.600 --> 33:41.960]  Powerful multinational corporations are held bent on bringing down nation states and capturing
[33:41.960 --> 33:48.000]  the jewels of global control the West and then deploying that wealth, that technological
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.160]  prowess into establishing the first true corporate planetary government.
[33:53.160 --> 33:57.320]  And to do that, third world populations are being used as weapons to break down our borders.
[33:57.320 --> 34:04.800]  They intend to then bring in a race-based, ethnic-based, culture-based civil war in the
[34:04.800 --> 34:11.440]  Democrats' own words, and then they intend to target and physically attack Republicans,
[34:11.440 --> 34:14.080]  Christians, conservatives, patriots, nationalists.
[34:14.080 --> 34:17.680]  There was a big video from Steve McQueen's The Great Escape going around.
[34:17.680 --> 34:18.920]  I'll show later.
[34:18.920 --> 34:24.160]  On Twitter last night with Democrats' prominent Twitter accounts saying, I shot a whole video
[34:24.160 --> 34:27.600]  on it saying, oh, you're lucky.
[34:27.600 --> 34:30.880]  We just ran Sanders out of the restaurant and chased her down the street and chased her
[34:30.880 --> 34:31.880]  into another store.
[34:31.880 --> 34:36.280]  No, no, this is what's going to be happening to you.
[34:36.280 --> 34:41.760]  And it shows Nazis at a French cafe in the greatest state being machine-gun.
[34:41.760 --> 34:46.960]  MS Bellows Jr. was one of the ones tweeting it, said, I got asked to leave.
[34:46.960 --> 34:47.960]  It's nothing.
[34:47.960 --> 34:50.640]  Here's how the Trump administration officials will be treated at restaurants.
[34:50.640 --> 34:53.720]  If we don't stop them now, they should thank us.
[34:53.720 --> 34:59.240]  And that's what the antifa are the professors and the corporate people that are part of
[34:59.240 --> 35:00.240]  the left.
[35:00.240 --> 35:05.520]  And they are, I know the biggest gun shops in town, and they've asked me not to particularly
[35:05.520 --> 35:09.080]  get into what place they are, but I can quote them.
[35:09.080 --> 35:13.200]  They said, listen, our biggest business now is leftist, and they're in there training
[35:13.200 --> 35:16.720]  how to use firearms saying they're getting ready for civil war.
[35:16.720 --> 35:21.080]  This has been going on for a year, and it's not lost on them, though, that they want my
[35:21.080 --> 35:22.360]  guns, but they can have guns.
[35:22.360 --> 35:23.640]  See why I have my guns?
[35:23.640 --> 35:27.120]  It's for deranged lunatics like you, and you've got Hashtag Hunt Republicans and the
[35:27.120 --> 35:32.040]  year anniversary of Scalise Kitten Shot, and you've got crazy Maxine Waters putting the
[35:32.040 --> 35:40.840]  talking point out like Donnie Deutsch and like Pito Fonda saying kidnap Baron, put him
[35:40.840 --> 35:43.120]  in a cage, burn down the facilities.
[35:43.120 --> 35:46.720]  You've got the doxing of the ICE agents by Antifa.
[35:46.720 --> 35:49.280]  That's by federal stay-behind network agents.
[35:49.280 --> 35:50.280]  I told you.
[35:50.280 --> 35:52.840]  They've already got the Office of Personnel Management.
[35:52.840 --> 35:54.960]  Obama gave that to the leftist.
[35:54.960 --> 35:58.000]  They've got all your houses, where you live, where you're at.
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.320]  They've got access to the databases to track you.
[36:00.320 --> 36:02.640]  They're in the NSA database.
[36:02.640 --> 36:06.640]  They have put hundreds of thousands of their own people, like Reality Winner, a member
[36:06.640 --> 36:11.800]  of ISIS, a person that said all whites should be genocided, a crazy white woman, was let
[36:11.800 --> 36:16.880]  in to run super high-level security clearances, some of the highest clearances you can get.
[36:16.880 --> 36:22.680]  She was hired because she was a fruitcake lunatic, evil person, because she would start
[36:22.680 --> 36:27.840]  a war with the American people and burn down prosperity and create racial division, because
[36:27.840 --> 36:30.120]  she was a bad person.
[36:30.120 --> 36:36.520]  Now, I'm going to go over all the background on this and show you the articles, the documents,
[36:36.520 --> 36:41.040]  Rex 84, everything that ties together to this, and I didn't sit there and say those terrible
[36:41.040 --> 36:46.920]  things are planned to do with the president, which they've said they'll do, just to hype
[36:46.920 --> 36:47.920]  things up.
[36:47.920 --> 36:55.040]  This is their move, and the globalists are planning a complete overthrow of America.
[36:55.040 --> 36:58.680]  It's their only shot now, and the same thing in Europe, and hundreds of millions from the
[36:58.680 --> 36:59.680]  third world.
[36:59.680 --> 37:01.000]  This is happening.
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.840]  The UN is announcing is taking control of the euro.
[37:03.840 --> 37:06.280]  It's announcing is taking control of the military.
[37:06.280 --> 37:17.000]  It's Reuters, the Nancy Pelosi and Loretta Lynch said they were going to bring in UN officials
[37:17.000 --> 37:22.520]  to run local police departments, remember when Hillary got in office, but it didn't happen.
[37:22.520 --> 37:25.080]  But they're still moving forward.
[37:25.080 --> 37:30.520]  Now, I'm going to go over all of it, but now people are finally listening because top professors
[37:30.520 --> 37:34.080]  are going, we're not going to see a civil war, we're in one.
[37:34.080 --> 37:39.080]  So let's be honest, and then let's talk about later in the next hour, what do we do as solutions
[37:39.080 --> 37:40.080]  to counter this?
[37:40.080 --> 37:45.360]  Well, you understand that they're going to try to cause a civil unrest, race-based, Democrat
[37:45.360 --> 37:51.400]  versus Republican civil war that will be used to make Trump stand down, and then the UN
[37:51.400 --> 37:57.680]  will come in for reconciliation and will arbitrate and will oversee the refugee centers, which
[37:57.680 --> 38:00.280]  are the port of entry for the takedown of the country.
[38:00.280 --> 38:01.440]  This is global government.
[38:01.440 --> 38:02.980]  This is capitulation of America.
[38:02.980 --> 38:03.980]  This is war.
[38:03.980 --> 38:07.400]  This is their stated plan.
[38:07.400 --> 38:15.440]  Reuters today, okay, UN to present plan for Mediterranean migrant centers for the EU.
[38:15.440 --> 38:21.560]  EU announces a EU army to not let nations leave and to make nations let the, quote,
[38:21.560 --> 38:24.960]  migrants in.
[38:24.960 --> 38:28.600]  It's all here, but you've got patriots getting elected everywhere, the tides turning against
[38:28.600 --> 38:29.600]  them.
[38:29.600 --> 38:30.600]  The blue states are all collapsing.
[38:30.600 --> 38:31.600]  People are fleeing.
[38:31.600 --> 38:33.640]  Merkel's in deep trouble.
[38:33.640 --> 38:37.240]  They don't know what to do, so they're going to move their timetable up.
[38:37.240 --> 38:41.160]  They're activating the colleges, they're activating the antifa, they're activating the violent
[38:41.160 --> 38:42.160]  groups.
[38:42.160 --> 38:44.640]  Antifa's saying they've got targets picked out in every city of who they're going to
[38:44.640 --> 38:45.640]  kill.
[38:45.640 --> 38:48.720]  They're just the cover for more serious hit teams.
[38:48.720 --> 38:53.160]  And then during all the unrest, if they can get rid of Trump or remove him or kill him
[38:53.160 --> 38:58.240]  or have a 25th amendment, which again, Clapper and Brenner are on TV saying, the cabinet must
[38:58.240 --> 38:59.240]  remove him now.
[38:59.240 --> 39:00.240]  We must take him out now.
[39:00.240 --> 39:09.360]  If that doesn't happen by October, because they know they're about to lose in a red wave,
[39:09.360 --> 39:13.520]  then they are going to try to kill the president.
[39:13.520 --> 39:15.480]  And I'm telling you, they know they're going to lose.
[39:15.480 --> 39:16.800]  They know everybody's turning against them.
[39:16.800 --> 39:21.040]  They know that the poll numbers are even way better than what they're saying.
[39:21.040 --> 39:28.400]  And they are in Hitler's bunker, basically, but we could let them manipulate us into going
[39:28.400 --> 39:30.880]  along with their narrative and their hoax.
[39:30.880 --> 39:35.200]  And so this country and the world, this is a global system we're fighting is on the razor's
[39:35.200 --> 39:36.200]  edge right now.
[39:36.200 --> 39:42.160]  Now, dovetailing into this is Roger Stone with exclusive information about the latest
[39:42.160 --> 39:50.640]  dragnet of Mr. Mueller and Rosenstein committing violations of the government regulations that
[39:50.640 --> 39:56.280]  are very, very serious that he's discovered and some other huge developments on the dragnet
[39:56.280 --> 39:59.840]  targeting Joel Gilbert, myself, and other filmmakers.
[39:59.840 --> 40:04.800]  So they're looking at a campaign finance now, but they put Dineshda Susan in prison for
[40:04.800 --> 40:07.880]  nine months saying he did something wrong on campaign finance.
[40:07.880 --> 40:13.240]  They've already tried to arrest Gilbert a few years ago saying that films he mailed
[40:13.240 --> 40:15.720]  out to people during a campaign was campaign finance.
[40:15.720 --> 40:17.640]  And you're like, well, that's crazy.
[40:17.640 --> 40:21.120]  But if they've got a civil war and martial law and Trump goes down, that'll be their
[40:21.120 --> 40:24.400]  excuse not to even kill us but to arrest us.
[40:24.400 --> 40:26.240]  Then it'll all be nice and neat and tidy.
[40:26.240 --> 40:28.240]  So they've got a couple tracks going here.
[40:28.240 --> 40:32.000]  And so after Roger breaks this down, I'm going to ask him, what does the president do?
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.960]  Because it's a clear and present danger.
[40:33.960 --> 40:35.120]  They're doxing everybody.
[40:35.120 --> 40:36.320]  They're saying civil war.
[40:36.320 --> 40:38.440]  They're saying harass and intimidate people.
[40:38.440 --> 40:40.320]  Folks are getting attacked everywhere.
[40:40.320 --> 40:43.240]  And at a certain point, we can't just sit here.
[40:43.240 --> 40:45.360]  It becomes a dereliction of duty.
[40:45.360 --> 40:47.120]  We have to move against these people.
[40:47.120 --> 40:49.720]  So Roger, thank you for joining us with the exclusive info.
[40:49.720 --> 40:50.720]  We got two minutes to break.
[40:50.720 --> 40:54.600]  Give us a synopsis and we'll come back and get it all out there.
[40:54.600 --> 40:56.680]  Well, let's do it this way, Alex.
[40:56.680 --> 41:03.760]  Yesterday, the former CIA official, Mr. Mudd, I think gave away the game when he said, we're
[41:03.760 --> 41:07.160]  going to kill this guy, referring to Trump.
[41:07.160 --> 41:14.760]  We, meaning the CIA, the intelligence community, have been around for since the 1900s.
[41:14.760 --> 41:17.360]  And we're just going to kill this guy.
[41:17.360 --> 41:18.960]  I take that very seriously.
[41:18.960 --> 41:21.560]  I wrote a book on the Kennedy assassination.
[41:21.560 --> 41:27.920]  I know the role of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon and the FBI and the
[41:27.920 --> 41:31.320]  Secret Service in that coup d'état.
[41:31.320 --> 41:35.920]  So I think Mr. Mudd has given away the game.
[41:35.920 --> 41:38.920]  That's exactly what they have in mind.
[41:38.920 --> 41:41.000]  Now we're going to be called alarmists.
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.520]  We're going to be called extremists.
[41:42.520 --> 41:48.320]  We're going to be called conspiracy theorists because we point this out now.
[41:48.320 --> 41:56.640]  So right here on Infowars, I predicted the 25th Amendment play by the establishment and
[41:56.640 --> 41:58.560]  here we have it.
[41:58.560 --> 42:02.880]  Once again, Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[42:02.880 --> 42:04.200]  And it gets more insane.
[42:04.200 --> 42:09.320]  Mudd, I looked into his genealogy, it appears, is related to Dr. Mudd, the only other person
[42:09.320 --> 42:13.000]  convicted of shooting Lincoln, of helping John Wilkes Booth.
[42:13.000 --> 42:18.720]  And so here is another guy calling for another death of a Republican president by assassination
[42:18.720 --> 42:21.320]  and it appears he's the same family from Virginia.
[42:21.320 --> 42:24.880]  I couldn't trace it back because the records didn't go back, but it goes back to the same
[42:24.880 --> 42:29.640]  town and he's definitely related, but I don't know if it's directly to them.
[42:29.640 --> 42:33.000]  That's where his name is Mudd, comes from the traitor Mudd.
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.960]  Can you believe that, Roger?
[42:35.960 --> 42:39.320]  It's amazing, Alex, and not a coincidence.
[42:39.320 --> 42:40.320]  Absolutely.
[42:40.320 --> 42:44.240]  I mean, this family has Republican bloodlust.
[42:44.240 --> 42:47.240]  They hate America, folks, and it's unbelievable.
[42:47.240 --> 42:48.240]  And here's the deal.
[42:48.240 --> 42:50.520]  I am honored to stand with Roger and the president and you.
[42:50.520 --> 42:51.520]  We're not bully.
[42:51.520 --> 42:52.520]  We're not backing down.
[42:52.520 --> 42:53.520]  It's a game of chicken.
[42:53.520 --> 42:56.600]  And I am just pressing the accelerator down and I'm going right down the center lane and
[42:56.600 --> 42:57.600]  let's go.
[42:57.600 --> 42:58.600]  We're going to do it.
[42:58.600 --> 42:59.600]  Let's do it.
[42:59.600 --> 43:02.000]  Fueling your body is hard work.
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.520]  That's why we've introduced the Infowars Life Daily Digestive Pack to help you fuel
[43:06.520 --> 43:07.960]  it right.

[46:56.440 --> 47:22.240]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[47:22.240 --> 47:26.800]  Well, you just heard Roger Stone, who has predicted everything that they would try to do to Trump,
[47:26.800 --> 47:27.800]  including the 25th Amendment move.
[47:27.800 --> 47:29.800]  He said that a year ago here.
[47:29.800 --> 47:31.760]  The whole Alzheimer's thing, all of it.
[47:31.760 --> 47:36.760]  And they are now openly saying we're going to have civil war, we're going to harass Republicans
[47:36.760 --> 47:39.920]  and their families, we're going to harass any Trump voters, we're going to physically
[47:39.920 --> 47:40.920]  hurt them.
[47:40.920 --> 47:44.560]  Antifa is doxing federal law enforcement home addresses.
[47:44.560 --> 47:50.200]  They're saying target their families, that Hollywood stars, Hollywood turds are out there
[47:50.200 --> 47:56.280]  saying burn down their houses, attack them, kidnap their children.
[47:56.280 --> 47:58.640]  Donnie Deutch is saying they're all Nazis.
[47:58.640 --> 48:03.560]  The Democrats are circulating video online of the great escape with Steve McQueen with
[48:03.560 --> 48:06.600]  their machine-gunning Nazis at a cafe and saying, this is what we're going to do to
[48:06.600 --> 48:08.960]  you in the cafes now.
[48:08.960 --> 48:09.960]  It's just unbelievable.
[48:09.960 --> 48:13.840]  And then I saw the comments last night when I showed that they were tweeting that and
[48:13.840 --> 48:15.840]  people were like, yeah, we're going to kill you.
[48:15.840 --> 48:17.280]  Well, here's the deal.
[48:17.280 --> 48:19.240]  It's like James Woods said.
[48:19.240 --> 48:24.840]  He's going to get armed, who isn't already armed, gets more training, watch our six.
[48:24.840 --> 48:29.800]  And if anything happens like this, we're going to fight back.
[48:29.800 --> 48:33.280]  So I appreciate Democrats being honest about what your intentions are.
[48:33.280 --> 48:37.720]  So if I have to defend myself, it's very, very clear who was the aggressor.
[48:37.720 --> 48:43.800]  So I mean, I understand that the Democratic situation tends to be followers or mentally
[48:43.800 --> 48:46.960]  ill or have a lot of problems or be on the government mammary gland.
[48:46.960 --> 48:51.040]  But I don't think they understand like threatening us isn't making us go away.
[48:51.040 --> 48:52.400]  It was kind of like Hitler bombing London.
[48:52.400 --> 48:54.800]  He thought it would make them give up and it made them go from being against the war
[48:54.800 --> 48:55.800]  for the war.
[48:55.800 --> 49:00.400]  Roger, you've got a lot of big breaking news here, but I need people to understand that
[49:00.400 --> 49:04.480]  you just concurred with me and sometimes you disagree, but you just agreed that they are
[49:04.480 --> 49:06.640]  going to go to the mattresses.
[49:06.640 --> 49:08.320]  They know they're losing.
[49:08.320 --> 49:09.760]  You're saying you agree with my analysis.
[49:09.760 --> 49:11.240]  You can see the preparation everywhere.
[49:11.240 --> 49:14.800]  I mean, they say they're planning this and I just don't know how the president doesn't
[49:14.800 --> 49:15.800]  move on them.
[49:15.800 --> 49:19.120]  And I think that I think that he should probably fire the attorney general.
[49:19.120 --> 49:20.320]  He should fire them all.
[49:20.320 --> 49:21.320]  He should put new people in.
[49:21.320 --> 49:24.400]  He should declare a civil emergency.
[49:24.400 --> 49:25.400]  Definitely the country's in one.
[49:25.400 --> 49:29.160]  George Washington did that during his first term and point out who the traders are because
[49:29.160 --> 49:32.000]  these, these aren't organic Americans that are doing this.
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.200]  These are people trying to overthrow the country quarterback by the UN, trying to break our
[49:36.200 --> 49:38.240]  borders, trying to capture the country.
[49:38.240 --> 49:40.600]  This is our nation under attack.
[49:40.600 --> 49:45.400]  And I think the president has been very judicious and very restrained so far and he's been turning
[49:45.400 --> 49:49.640]  the economy around trying to get people to wake up and just be decent, but they've proven
[49:49.640 --> 49:53.440]  how evil they are and they're just howling for his blood, my blood, your blood.
[49:53.440 --> 49:56.560]  And so this, we now move into survival mode against these people.
[49:56.560 --> 50:03.400]  Well, and their hysteria is only increased by a growing economy and by the disappearance
[50:03.400 --> 50:08.280]  of the polling edge that they seem to have in the upcoming elections.
[50:08.280 --> 50:10.640]  There will be no blue title wave.
[50:10.640 --> 50:13.880]  There may be a red title wave.
[50:13.880 --> 50:17.440]  Every day that goes by, the economy improves.
[50:17.440 --> 50:22.880]  They know that the president's personal and corporate income tax rates have not yet even
[50:22.880 --> 50:26.360]  had a chance to have their full positive effects.
[50:26.360 --> 50:29.880]  So things are only going to get bigger, better.
[50:29.880 --> 50:32.920]  And I think that strengthens the president's hand.
[50:32.920 --> 50:36.000]  And that's why the Democrats now admit they want to bankrupt the economy to stop us.
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.840]  I mean, they are the enemy.
[50:38.840 --> 50:43.200]  There's a piece up on Bloomberg today that says Robert Mueller is now going to focus on
[50:43.200 --> 50:45.080]  Russian collusion.
[50:45.080 --> 50:46.080]  Wait a minute.
[50:46.080 --> 50:50.320]  I thought that's what he was focusing on from the beginning.
[50:50.320 --> 51:01.640]  This nothing burger story ties to every non-crime, every allegation, every false or muted fact
[51:01.640 --> 51:05.320]  about the fact that there is no Russian collusion.
[51:05.320 --> 51:12.680]  It mentions the contact through Michael Caputo to me by Henry Greenberg, but it never mentions
[51:12.680 --> 51:17.720]  that Mr. Greenberg is an indisputable FBI informant.
[51:17.720 --> 51:23.480]  Really Chris Strom and Shannon Pettypiece need to be ashamed of themselves.
[51:23.480 --> 51:25.520]  This is not journalism.
[51:25.520 --> 51:28.360]  This is an attempt to fraud.
[51:28.360 --> 51:29.360]  It really is.
[51:29.360 --> 51:30.360]  It is fraudulent.
[51:30.360 --> 51:39.520]  In my own case, as you know, Reuters, AP, others have reported that the FBI has interrogated
[51:39.520 --> 51:47.120]  and in some cases subpoenaed, in other cases are attempting subpoena, a number of my current
[51:47.120 --> 51:50.760]  and former associates and employees.
[51:50.760 --> 51:52.360]  Now I know how this works.
[51:52.360 --> 51:54.440]  I've seen enough mob movies.
[51:54.440 --> 51:58.560]  You find the underlings, you find something they've done wrong.
[51:58.560 --> 52:02.200]  Let's say they didn't pay their federal income taxes.
[52:02.200 --> 52:09.840]  Now you give them a walk on that charge in return for testifying against the big fish
[52:09.840 --> 52:12.240]  that would be made.
[52:12.240 --> 52:18.360]  So we don't know what will happen, but we do know that the lead prosecutor investigating
[52:18.360 --> 52:25.080]  Roger Stone comes from the Baltimore U.S. Attorney's Office of Rod Rosenstein.
[52:25.080 --> 52:30.120]  That's interesting because Mr. Rosenstein, by regulation, is not supposed to be involved
[52:30.120 --> 52:35.320]  in the operations or staffing of the special counsel's office.
[52:35.320 --> 52:39.960]  So how this lawyer got his job, we don't know.
[52:39.960 --> 52:46.600]  But we do know that they will find no evidence of rushing collusion and Roger Stone, no evidence
[52:46.600 --> 52:54.120]  of WikiLeaks, hijinks, and Roger Stone, no evidence that I had for knowledge of John
[52:54.120 --> 52:55.120]  Podesta's email.
[52:55.120 --> 52:58.200]  I want to go back to this because I was just reading the Bloomberg article they put out
[52:58.200 --> 53:00.480]  it, and they think we have no memory.
[53:00.480 --> 53:01.480]  It's like we're goldfish.
[53:01.480 --> 53:07.720]  It says Mueller now for the first time focusing on Russia, and he's accelerating things.
[53:07.720 --> 53:10.960]  Yeah, because he knows they're about to lose the midterms.
[53:10.960 --> 53:14.200]  They thought they'd win the midterms, then have their impeachment, but instead they're
[53:14.200 --> 53:20.720]  going to totally politically, right before, I'd say, September, October, start releasing
[53:20.720 --> 53:25.520]  all the latest hoaxes, like Tom Arnold saying that Trump's lawyer told him he had all the
[53:25.520 --> 53:27.680]  dirt, which he admits was a total hoax.
[53:27.680 --> 53:31.240]  So I expect a bunch of those hoaxes going at the same time with them trying to start
[53:31.240 --> 53:34.920]  a race war at the end of the summer as some way to drive the president out and get his
[53:34.920 --> 53:37.080]  cabinet to go 25th Amendment.
[53:37.080 --> 53:40.560]  But if that doesn't work, you agree they are planning to kill him.
[53:40.560 --> 53:48.400]  Well, and they're now examining the independent political operations of my independent efforts
[53:48.400 --> 53:56.400]  to elect Donald Trump, specifically the Committee for American Sovereignty, which produced the
[53:56.400 --> 54:04.040]  documentary Banished the Danny Williams story, seen by 35 million Americans, which by the
[54:04.040 --> 54:12.160]  way debuted right here on Info Wars, also produced the Danny Williams rap video by the
[54:12.160 --> 54:15.960]  Trinauts, seen by 28 million people.
[54:15.960 --> 54:21.320]  And you played it and aired it and promoted ads in black urban areas, and many experts
[54:21.320 --> 54:26.840]  credited for Trump winning 100% legal.
[54:26.840 --> 54:35.680]  But Joel Gilbert is now under the microscope, the the incredible director of these videos.
[54:35.680 --> 54:43.320]  This is this is legal harassment by a vengeful federal prosecutor with a partisan objective.
[54:43.320 --> 54:47.600]  I'm being targeted because I'm a friend of Donald Trump.
[54:47.600 --> 54:54.400]  I am being targeted because I have been effective in the election of Donald Trump.
[54:54.400 --> 54:56.480]  Is this Hillary's payback?
[54:56.480 --> 54:57.960]  I suspect it is.
[54:57.960 --> 55:02.760]  And Alex, I don't need to tell you the cost is enormous.
[55:02.760 --> 55:07.760]  I want to thank the thousands of people who have sent contributions to my legal defense
[55:07.760 --> 55:08.760]  fund.
[55:08.760 --> 55:09.760]  Absolutely.
[55:09.760 --> 55:10.760]  Don't defend.com.
[55:10.760 --> 55:16.520]  I'm going to be bankrupt by this process, but I will not throw in the towel and I will
[55:16.520 --> 55:23.440]  not quit and I will not roll over and I will not testify against the president.
[55:23.440 --> 55:26.400]  And there's nothing to testify about, as you've said.
[55:26.400 --> 55:31.600]  Well, but see, they try to induce you to compose testimony.
[55:31.600 --> 55:33.480]  It's an age old trick.
[55:33.480 --> 55:34.480]  Well, sure.
[55:34.480 --> 55:37.840]  But last time you run, you pointed out you've done nothing wrong and so you never testify
[55:37.840 --> 55:38.840]  against him.
[55:38.840 --> 55:42.000]  And then they said, stone admits he did something wrong, but he won't flip on the president.
[55:42.000 --> 55:43.800]  They are such incredible liars.
[55:43.800 --> 55:47.400]  And speaking of that, I didn't even plug one time yesterday because I'm so upset about
[55:47.400 --> 55:50.480]  what's happening and all the calls for violence and the fact that we know they're going to
[55:50.480 --> 55:54.520]  make their civil unrest, martial law move.
[55:54.520 --> 55:59.640]  And it's just a terrible situation, but I didn't even plug yesterday one time.
[55:59.640 --> 56:05.120]  We have super blue fluoride free toothpaste fortified with colloidal silver and iodine.
[56:05.120 --> 56:06.120]  It's amazing.

[56:37.840 --> 56:43.040]  We cannot go any lower than that read the thousands and thousands of five star reviews.
[56:43.040 --> 56:48.880]  It takes a lot of money to fund this operation in full wars life.com in full war store.com
[56:48.880 --> 56:53.160]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.

[56:57.560 --> 56:58.560]  Those donations really, really help.
[56:58.560 --> 57:01.880]  I want to thank you all for those and they know we're beginning to win.
[57:01.880 --> 57:04.400]  That's why they're so scared, Roger.
[57:04.400 --> 57:09.360]  People can buy your latest bookstones rules at info or store.com as well.
[57:09.360 --> 57:13.080]  But more importantly, tell folks the best website where they can go and make a donation.
[57:13.080 --> 57:15.400]  So you can stay in the fight.

[57:21.480 --> 57:23.640]  You can send a contribution there.
[57:23.640 --> 57:28.720]  Look, the survival of input wars is crucial for my own survival because they're the only
[57:28.720 --> 57:31.320]  ones who are going to tell you the truth.
[57:31.320 --> 57:33.720]  If the government decides to move again, stay right there.
[57:33.720 --> 57:34.720]  Let's do five more minutes.
[57:34.720 --> 57:38.520]  We have a special guest in the studio, the amazing Lucas, think about this folks.
[57:38.520 --> 57:40.200]  You always get the news a year before here.
[57:40.200 --> 57:42.240]  They know that the enemy knows that.
[57:42.240 --> 57:44.800]  And we're going to talk about what should Trump do next to counter this?
[57:44.800 --> 57:49.160]  What should we all do to stop their civil war plan?
[57:49.160 --> 57:54.080]  The scientists at info wars life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support
[57:54.080 --> 57:55.840]  and joint support.
[57:55.840 --> 57:59.000]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[57:59.000 --> 58:02.800]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[58:02.800 --> 58:07.160]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[58:07.160 --> 58:11.320]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[58:11.320 --> 58:15.600]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption
[58:15.600 --> 58:20.760]  to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system and
[58:20.760 --> 58:22.560]  so much more.
[58:22.560 --> 58:26.960]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains one to five percent of active ingredients.
[58:26.960 --> 58:32.760]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients.
[58:32.760 --> 58:38.680]  These combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme
[58:38.680 --> 58:41.560]  to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.560]  Make it all changes.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:11.080]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.080]  It is a choice.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.560]  Just like what I said, slavery is a choice.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:19.060]  Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing as expecting a different result.
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:24.040]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, you f**k you, you f**k you, how are we going
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.120]  to get a different result out of hate?
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:30.000]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.400]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.080]  We have the resources for a peaceful world.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:37.260]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy mother f**kers to change something.
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:40.340]  Steve Jobs is crazy, now we all know Steve Jobs phones.
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.460]  They say Trump's crazy, they say I'm crazy,
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.780]  but I'm here to show love.
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:47.820]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:48.660]  told me.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:54.020]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:56.300]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:59.300]  And now the left's favorite director,
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.540]  Mr. Lynch has come out and supported Trump.
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:05.300]  Every other left icon, Morris C,
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.660]  the list goes on and on, anybody that is really
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:11.700]  about prosperity in the future knows that Trump's a good guy.
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:14.340]  But the globalist, Brennan, others who special,
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:16.700]  these overthrowing countries, admit they're trying
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.260]  to overthrow the president and the electoral process.
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:21.100]  And so it's all public now.
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:23.380]  And we kept warning of this and warning now they're public.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:26.300]  Roger, what does the president need to do?
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:29.980]  I mean, if we don't talk about how we respond to this,
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:31.820]  we don't want to get tricked into doing something too much,
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:34.660]  but at a certain point that becomes a mind game
[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:38.100]  of its own, because when they're already going hot on you,
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:39.900]  I think the big thing is people need to know how serious
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.580]  this is so they don't get the jump on us,
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:44.740]  and that they are planning at the end of the summer,
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:49.540]  end of the fall to basically trigger civil unrest
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.180]  and the assassination of the president
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:53.700]  and a total political shutdown.
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:56.180]  They're also pre-programming, I've noticed,
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.340]  in Bloomberg and McClatchy and everywhere now,
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.060]  that the Russians are claiming that people want
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:04.100]  to overthrow Trump and that the Russians are claiming
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:06.220]  that the little girl really wasn't hurt.
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:08.300]  And the Russians are claiming that the left
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.940]  wants to sow civil war,
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.060]  when the Russians have nothing to do with it,
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.020]  they're the ones doing it,
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:14.580]  so that when we're saying, hey, this is bad, don't do it,
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:17.140]  they're gonna say that's Russia propaganda too.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.900]  I mean, hell, if I didn't cook my kid's eggs
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:21.460]  right this morning, it was the Russians' fault.
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.260]  So in the three minutes we have left,
[01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:24.660]  what does Trump need to do?
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:28.940]  Well, the single most important thing he could do today,
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:30.780]  right now in the next hour,
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:34.580]  is to terminate the employment of Rod Rosenstein.
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:38.620]  Mr. Rosenstein certainly has grounds for termination.
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:40.660]  He has not turned over to the Congress
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:42.620]  what the Congress asked for.
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:45.140]  He has turned over substantially less
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:47.380]  than what the Congress asked for.
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:51.940]  He is the one who signed the surveillance authorization
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:56.620]  under a FISA warrant based on fraudulent information.
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:59.900]  Those two acts of treachery alone
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:02.500]  should merit his termination.
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:05.300]  We won the election, but the deep state
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:08.860]  continues to control the Justice Department.
[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:11.860]  The president cannot possibly combat
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.340]  the coming counter-revolution,
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:19.340]  the coming revolt to overturn the country in a coup
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:23.780]  without a Justice Department committed to the rule of law
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:27.060]  and the prosecution of those who plan
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:30.700]  to execute the violence.
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:32.460]  And Roger, you were completely right.
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:34.100]  That's why Mueller admits he's accelerating
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:38.100]  his fake Russia probe is because he understands
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.020]  the wheels are coming off.
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:41.140]  Rosenstein is absconding with evidence.
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:42.900]  He's violating federal rules.
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:44.740]  He's got his own picked lawyer
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:47.420]  after you that violates federal rules.
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:50.380]  He's got to go or Trump is in dereliction of duty.
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:52.540]  Trump is totally completely innocent of all this.
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:53.500]  It's been proven.
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:56.340]  Rosenstein is a criminal coup plotter
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:58.740]  with Hillary, with McCabe, with Strock,
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:00.540]  with all of these people.
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:03.540]  And Trump must move against the clear and present danger
[01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:05.980]  before they crash the economy, assassinate him,
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:07.140]  and start a race war.
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:08.460]  So it's got to be done.
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:09.500]  Rosenstein's got to go.
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.140]  And I think the attorney general does as well.
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:12.460]  Got to fire both of them.
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:16.180]  Amen, from your mouth to God's ear.
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.420]  It's got to be done.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.540]  He can't wait till Mueller comes up
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:22.260]  with all his fake garbage down the road
[01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:23.980]  and then just lets them continue to engage
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:24.820]  in criminal activity.
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:27.420]  At the proof, from the beginning, it was a frame up.
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.620]  That means investigations are over.
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:31.340]  I cannot believe that Mueller has not had
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:33.620]  his arrogant ass thrown in prison yet.
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:36.260]  You know, it's amazing.
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:40.180]  I did an interview with the Hill, Alex, last week.
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:44.620]  And although I never used the word indict in my interview,
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:48.220]  their headline, Roger Stone expects to be indicted.
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:49.820]  Not what I said.
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.740]  Roger Stone expects to be framed.
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.700]  That's a real possibility.
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:55.540]  I bless you.
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.380]  We'll be back.
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:02.100]  Infowarslife and infowarslife.com is extremely excited
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:04.020]  to announce our latest release,

[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:11.500]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.580]  nutritional supplement.
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:14.300]  It is produced by extracting oil
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:17.300]  from healthy nutrient dense plants known as lichens.
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:20.380]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.

[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:33.060]  The research and development took over two years,
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:35.940]  but the result, as verified by independent laboratories,
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:39.180]  is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.

[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:52.340]  something the globalists are targeting.

[01:05:58.380 --> 01:05:59.580]  Good evening, everybody.
[01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:03.660]  Here's not even the same universe.
[01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:06.300]  I mean, he is an abject psychopathic,
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.260]  demon from hell.
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:10.060]  People around him are saying she's so dark now
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.740]  and so evil and so possessed
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:14.700]  that they are having nightmares.
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:15.780]  They're freaking out.
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:17.220]  Hopefully, they say, listen,
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:19.300]  Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.100]  Oh!
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:25.460]  Whiskey bottles and brand-new cars.
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:29.060]  Oh, you're in my way.
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:33.380]  There's too much coke and too much smoke.
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:35.540]  Look what's going on inside you.
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:36.340]  That's different.
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:37.580]  At this point, y'all just wait.
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:39.540]  Ooh, that smell.
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:41.620]  I have two words for you.
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:43.620]  Can't you smell that smell?
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.940]  That's a good quote.
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:50.340]  Ooh, that smell.
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.580]  The smell of gas around you.
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:54.260]  Hey, you saw?
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:55.020]  Died.
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.340]  There's a guy on the radio.
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:00.700]  He said he and Hillary are demons.
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.700]  Said we smell like sulfur.
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:03.860]  Hey, man, son.
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:05.340]  I thought just the entire key.
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:07.340]  A Tony Margaret named Samoa.
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:11.820]  I had never seen or smelled anyone like her.
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:16.700]  Can't you smell that smell?
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:19.180]  Can't you smell that smell?
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:23.180]  Can't you smell that smell?
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:25.180]  Can't you smell that smell?
[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:29.180]  Can't you smell that smell?
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:34.420]  Defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic.
[01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:36.420]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:43.420]  Can't you smell that smell?
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:45.420]  Can't you smell that smell?
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:50.420]  Can't you smell that smell?
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:53.420]  So, man, there it is.
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:56.420]  There's a lot of flies in here, and the center is going to do
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:58.420]  something about these flies.
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:01.420]  We're going to kill them.
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:12.420]  I'm picking up a bad oar.
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:14.420]  That's the thing I can't hold.
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:16.420]  I think it's all in the jeweler's car.
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.420]  Onscreen.
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:23.420]  But here's the good news, chumps.
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:26.420]  You think you're gonna assassinate Trump?
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:31.420]  I can't believe a bunch of us are going along with you.
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.420]  How do I preserve top?
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:34.420]  It's not for me.
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:37.420]  I'm willing to fight to one point at this point.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:42.420]  And only the dumbest morons buying to your SJW Globalist, George Soros, dropping.
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:43.420]  Stabilize it.
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:44.420]  Emergency reserve.
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:47.420]  Hillary Clinton and the New World Order and Michael Moore.
[01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:50.420]  Go back to babies where you came from.
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:54.420]  We're awake and you're not putting us back in the coma.
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:55.420]  You got that, Jack?
[01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:56.420]  You're done.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.420]  It's over.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:58.420]  You don't want it.
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:08:59.420]  Get him back.
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:00.420]  Get him back.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:07.420]  Do you think there was more than one?
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:11.420]  For sure.
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:12.420]  I'm picking cheater.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:15.420]  It sounds like it's confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:16.420]  Clear.
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:17.420]  Or what do you think?
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:18.420]  All right.
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:22.420]  He is riding shotgun with us for the rest of the broadcast.
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:23.420]  He's the amazing Lucas.
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.420]  Everyone of his videos is really good.
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:26.420]  Really informative.
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:30.420]  And he's a champion bodybuilder and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:33.420]  And he's the amazing Lucas on Instagram.
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:35.420]  I'm the amazing Lucas.
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:36.420]  You too, the amazing Lucas.
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:43.420]  And he just got involved in the last year or so because of all the stuff that he has seen.
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:45.420]  So it's great to have you here with us.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:47.420]  Thank you for having me.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:52.420]  Man, I tell you, what would you call the state of the nation right now?
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:54.420]  What would you call that?
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:55.420]  A hysterical.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.420]  And it's manufactured hysteria.
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:59.420]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:02.420]  Because everything from Maxine Waters, like that's real.
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:03.420]  When it comes to the mom.
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.420]  And the thing is, many people were focusing on what she was saying.
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:11.420]  But if you really go back in time, they've always been saying some off the wall things.
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:14.420]  The only difference is now people are cheering.
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:21.420]  And once you have Tommy Loring and water thrown in her face, it's only a matter of time that water becomes acid.
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:23.420]  Well said.
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:27.420]  I mean, I've experienced hot coffee dumped on my face.
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:30.420]  I've experienced people knocking my food over at the restaurant.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:33.420]  And they call you a Russian agent or a Nazi.
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.420]  It's like calling me a space alien.
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:38.420]  So a lot of times I laugh at them and they get mad.
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.420]  But a lot of people, it's not funny to them, but they'll do it in front of your kids too.
[01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:43.420]  Yeah, because that's what they actually believe.
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:46.420]  They've been brainwashed into believing that you're Nazis.
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:50.420]  So if you actually believe that someone is a Nazi, well, I'd be right there with them.
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:52.420]  I'd be like, yeah, we need to get these Nazis out of here.
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:56.420]  These bigots, these homophobes, these xenophobes, all these words to censor people.
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:59.420]  And it's a process of dehumanization.
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:01.420]  You know, it's funny you bring that up.
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:03.420]  Guys, can you pull up the Great Escape clip?
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.420]  And then also he removed it off his Twitter.
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:08.420]  But it had been retweeted thousands of times.
[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:12.420]  The Democrats were sharing this last night.
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:14.420]  But first, we can't want to actually show the tweet.
[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:15.420]  We saved it.
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:19.420]  The Democrats were tweeting this all over the place.
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:25.420]  And I learned about it from some of the crew here who had it tweeted at them.
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:27.420]  They had it tweeted at them.
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:30.420]  And this is MS Bellows Jr.
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:33.420]  I got asked to leave is nothing.
[01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:37.420]  Here's how Trump administration officials will be treated at restaurants if we don't stop them now.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:43.420]  And it's Steve McQueen, who by the way was good buddies with Chuck Norris and would be a patriot today if he was alive.
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:49.420]  A lot of people that knew him, he was like Americana, you know, red, white and blue, would love Trump.
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:52.420]  And of course, we're the Americans that beat the Nazis, remember?
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:58.420]  But in the new leftist program when they're funded by George Soros, a literal former Nazi collaborator in his own words on 60 Minutes,
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:07.420]  they have this guy tweeting this out, other people tweeting it, thousands of tweets celebrating that, yeah, we're going to start killing you.
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:09.420]  And now they're doxing the Border Patrol agents.
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:11.420]  Now they're putting dead animals on their doorsteps.
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:13.420]  Now they're chasing people around out of movie theaters.
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:15.420]  And it's happened to me.
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:20.420]  And again, these mobs telling Milo that he's a Nazi when he's Jewish.
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:21.420]  It's crazy.
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:29.420]  So here's the clip from the Great Escape that they're passing around the Internet saying this is what needs to happen to Republicans when they're in restaurants.
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:30.420]  Here it is.
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:31.420]  Hello.
[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:32.420]  Hello.
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:33.420]  Hello.
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:34.420]  Hello.
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:35.420]  Hello.
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:36.420]  Hello.
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:37.420]  Hello.
[01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:38.420]  Hello.
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:45.420]  Hello.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:49.420]  Hello.
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:52.420]  Hello.
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:57.420]  Our couple's up the outside canof함.
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:05.420]  And they kill the Nazis.
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:06.420]  And they talk about, oh are we in the French Resistance?
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:07.420]  Oh, yeah, we are.
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:11.860]  a drink together. So the other left, it's anti-gun, doesn't even know which end of
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:16.500]  it shoots, fantasizing about all this and saying kill the president's family,
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:24.580]  kidnap his son. The amazing Lucas, again, is here with us in studio. When do they
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:27.900]  stop her? How far does this go? They won't stop. They absolutely won't stop
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:32.860]  because what they won't allow to happen is a repeat of what happened in 2016. And
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:36.900]  I don't think a lot of people understand that. What we're seeing is just, it's the
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:41.380]  tipping point. And while they're figuring out and re-strategizing right now, this
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:47.180]  is the time that we need to consolidate and plan for 2019, 2020, because what
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:53.460]  they're planning for is 2030, 2044. So we have to, we have to join our forces
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:56.580]  together and really figure it out because... And we've got to reach out across
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:14:01.180]  racial and cultural lines because they are sowing classical race-based
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:05.460]  garbage and then to play a demographic number to steal the American dream. It's
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:10.540]  so cold-blooded. It absolutely is. The thing is they, what the left touches, they
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:13.540]  destroy. And for people who don't believe that, you can look at the black
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:16.900]  community, everything from separating fathers with the welfare, to put in
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:20.860]  Planned Parenthoods in the communities, to presently right now saying voter
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:26.020]  IDs, it's racist, it's racist. It's like we all know that's not the case. You want
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:29.740]  the votes from the Legals. But what the frightening part is, what should be alarming
[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:35.380]  to people right now, is that they have their eyes on America. That should
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:38.820]  be the frightening part because guess what? That affects you, that affects me,
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:43.380]  that affects everyone. And that's why you need to pick up and fight. And I'm not
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:46.660]  saying it incites violence, but you need to fight. And you know, no pun intended,
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:56.620]  but it is an information war. When I look at how they are just cold-bloodedly
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:15:02.300]  pushing lies and they get worse and worse and worse, I don't see how they
[01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:06.260]  succeed. But at the same time, I see a lot of Republicans becoming intimidated by
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:10.300]  it. I don't think, I mean, if they don't start standing up to this, these people
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:14.380]  could win. Absolutely. I told you sometimes, I mean, if you don't stand up,
[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:20.340]  they will consume you. If you cower, they will consume you. Amazing Lucas, we're
[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:23.380]  gonna cover the waterfront. We come back, a bunch of breaking news, Trump's
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:27.820]  statement on the Supreme Court ruling in his favor, all of it. But it's really
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:31.060]  true. If you look at every blue state, every blue city, everyone is in
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:34.900]  Exodus. The elites that are in charge always are tax-exempted, don't even really
[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:39.940]  live there. And it's true. I mean, what you said is everything they touch turns
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:44.060]  to crap. Why in the world will we want these people running things? The

[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:09.740]  holding. Hey, I've been following you since I was 14. I'm 32 now. I remember
[01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:13.740]  back when Info Wars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:17.900]  screen and it had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:21.820]  was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all

[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:49.300]  God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God and I wanted to say that

[01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:05.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:36.260]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:43.780]  Alright, the amazing Lucas is in studio with us. I tend to open the phones up
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:48.460]  coming up later in the next hour and I should have told you this. I should have
[01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:54.780]  told you this. Mike Cernovich is coming on and Mike Cernovich, if you notice, they've
[01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:58.940]  really been demonizing and attacking. The left is really afraid of Mike and
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:03.140]  that's because the left likes him. He's a likable guy. I wouldn't even call him a
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:07.140]  conservative. He's more of a libertarian and now Bill Maher bizarrely had a meltdown
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:12.260]  saying I'm a liar about him saying he wants the economy to crash even though
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:16.100]  he's shed it and I'm a liar that he's made a hundred million dollars on his
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:21.940]  contract when that's on record. I mean that's on record from HBO and he goes
[01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:27.900]  further and he says, so this is coming up next segment, that he hopes that Mike
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:32.340]  Cernovich dies and then he says, oh, I really just want to cook your head in an
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:37.460]  oven for children to eat and it's not even funny and then he goes, no, actually I
[01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:41.460]  want you to get help. So Maher is having, what do you think that is? We're gonna play
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:46.380]  the clip coming up. I don't know. I guess this is Trump derangement syndrome
[01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:50.060]  because I heard him say when he was talking about, you know, it's time for
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:53.940]  the economy to crash if it means getting the president out. I was like, that's
[01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:59.340]  that's insanity. That's to have millions of people to be out of work. That
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:02.860]  impacts everyone and that shows the vitro that they have for this president.
[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:06.180]  Has nothing to do with his policies. Has nothing to do with his administration.
[01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:10.220]  It is personal. I don't think I don't think we've ever seen anything like this
[01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:14.940]  before. It's unprecedented. And that's what Mike Cernovich said. He said he had a
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:18.300]  link to Reuters pointing out that you basically have a doubling of suicides
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:24.780]  during just a recession. And he made a joke about that. I mean, this is sickness.
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:29.820]  Yeah, I mean, it's absolutely is. But the thing is what they do, because I saw how
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:33.660]  you responded, but he responded, you know, tongue in cheek. You know, that's
[01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:36.020]  that's the way they do it. They encapsulate it in like this little
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:40.580]  comical humorous, you know, ha ha ha ha ha. While in the meantime, they mean
[01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:46.340]  exactly, they mean everything that they say. Well, that's the thing is that they
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:48.660]  take this little girl who was never separated from mother, put her on the
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:52.500]  cover of Time magazine. She's at a family center, totally safe. The mother has
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:59.780]  smuggled people here before. She's been deported in 2013. And then they get caught
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:04.540]  lying. Tom Arnold lies and says that, oh, Cohen's going public against the president.
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:10.700]  None of that was true. I mean, now they're just reduced to hoaxing. They have no
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:15.700]  credibility left. And then they say, we're these heartless, horrible people, but
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:20.700]  they want to abort as many kids as they can the amazing Lucas. And on top of it,
[01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:23.740]  they don't care if we have 10,000 extra suicides during a recession.
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:28.620]  Absolutely. And then not only that, that lady, she left three other kids there. So
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:34.340]  I'm like, you left three other kids there along with your husband to what? To come
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:38.980]  here illegally? And then be surprised when we enforce our laws? That's what
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:42.700]  blows my mind. I've never heard of such a thing. I'm like, if you do, if you
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:46.180]  commit a crime here, guess what? You suffer the punishment. But I guess I guess not,
[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:51.140]  you know, in New York, we have the Blasio, who's lessen the penalty for drunk
[01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:58.940]  driving and in grand larceny for illegals. Who else has they done that for?
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:02.660]  Well, that's the thing is they're setting it up to incentivize people coming to
[01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:06.340]  Europe, coming here. They give them everything free and then say, you
[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:10.060]  actually are above the law to incentivize. Exactly. And it's like you're sending
[01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:13.660]  two different message where Trump is trying to enforce our laws that we
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:17.420]  already have to the fullest extent and treat us equal. Exactly. So but at the
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:21.060]  same time, how are you gonna say don't come here? But if you come here, it's okay
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:25.220]  because we have sanctuary states that blows my mind. That's like selling
[01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:29.340]  someone. Hey, I'm an officer. If you run that red light, that's legal. But if you
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:34.460]  do it, I'm not gonna give you a ticket. What? Well, let me tell you, if my wife
[01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:38.060]  tried to smuggle our four-year-old daughter over a hundred miles of deadly
[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:41.180]  desert, probably most dangerous area in the world, I mean, she would deserve to
[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:45.380]  be arrested. I would deserve. How is this mother not having any responsibility for
[01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:49.380]  what she did? And then Trump is this bully hurting her. It's just it's crazy
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:54.300]  because the logic is so simple that it's a fraud. Completely. You would think that
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:58.060]  they would be looking at her like that's child endangerment. That's what you just
[01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:03.260]  did. That you're unfit to be a parent right now. But they completely reverse it.
[01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:06.500]  Instead of looking at the criminal, they look at the law. Well, the law needs to be
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:11.060]  abolished. The same thing they did with the Electoral College. When the Electoral
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:15.100]  College said we're giving it to Trump. Well, it's not that they voted. It's, you
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:19.980]  know what? We need to remove the Electoral College. And it's, I think
[01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:24.660]  people are waking up because due to just this incessant attack, attack, attack.
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:28.060]  It's just a myriad of attacks. Let me ask you this question. Because you're a smart
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:33.220]  guy. I had a gut level. So I've watched a lot of your videos and my son likes them
[01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:38.820]  as well. You get a lot of nuances at a gut level. How do you see this ending?
[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:41.740]  Because I know they're crazy. They're out of control. People are waking up, but
[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:46.900]  that makes them only more desperate. And they're just they're like crazy zombies
[01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:52.220]  or something. Maxine Waters, Mueller, all these Hillary looks like a jack-o'-lantern
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:58.380]  demon. It lies constantly and they never go away. Pelosi can't even hardly talk,
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:01.940]  but they're in charge and they're telling us we're going to remove the president
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:05.740]  extra judicially. I mean, they're on TV saying we're going to kill him. Phil
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:09.660]  Mudd used to run assassination squads overseas. He never did the killing
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:13.620]  himself, but that's what he did was, was, was run assassinations. Counterterrorism.
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:21.060]  So a guy whose job it is to assassinate people who runs operations to do that, he's
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:23.940]  saying we're going to kill the president. And at a certain point, I think Trump's
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:27.260]  got a problem if he doesn't go in there and do something to Mudd. And I know
[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:29.220]  they're coming after me because I've been saying something needs to be done, but
[01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:34.020]  I'm sorry, man. People start saying we're coming to kill you in Texas. Folks that
[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:38.740]  I grew up around said, well, we're coming for you. Wow. Does that make sense? It
[01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:42.700]  absolutely makes sense. They're coming for everyone, even remotely who, who don't
[01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:45.780]  even have an opinion on the issue. It's like, well, if you don't have an opinion,
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:50.460]  that's has an approval of Trump. We can't allow that. And there comes a point in
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:54.860]  time where it's no longer, well, okay, I'm just gonna, you know, comes a point in
[01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:58.860]  time where someone's attacking you. You need to defend yourself. I agree. What
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:04.020]  should happen to a pedo? I mean, Peter Fonda, who said kidnap Trump, sign, throw
[01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:07.860]  him in a thing with pedophiles. The same thing that happened to anyone else who
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:14.460]  would say like, say something like that. Imagine if any conservative said something
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:20.060]  even remotely like that about Obama's daughter. Imagine they would get arrested
[01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:24.740]  for sure. Imagine they may even get killed because of the mom and talent they
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:30.780]  had. Well, who brings people's kids into it? And I get his point. Well, he looks
[01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:34.860]  like a pervert. I'm not saying Peter Fonda is a child molester. But man, if I
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:38.100]  was going to cast a child molester for a movie that kidnaps and kills kid, it'd
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:42.860]  be Peter Fonda. I mean, put that picture back up. Man, is he one ugly looking
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:48.820]  day shoe and just like, God, you got the road. Look at that. Man, imagine me a
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:53.300]  little kid and that guy walks in the room. Think of nightmares are made of man.
[01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:57.020]  That guy is a sick freak. Reportedly, people that know that Hollywood say he is
[01:27:57.020 --> 01:28:02.300]  a like we're talking even stupider than Maxine Waters. They say he is so dumb.
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:09.180]  Wow. Oh yeah. I didn't think that was possible. Maxine, you know, she's now
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:12.780]  saying that no one's criticizing her. She says, my own party's not criticizing me
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:18.420]  even though we have on video Schumer. Yeah, Schumer just came out to not only
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:22.820]  that, but also Pelosi. But what she said is when they confront her is the president
[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:27.500]  is lying. I never said that. I'm like, we have it on tape. Like, what are you
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:31.020]  talking about? What are you? How are you going to just boldface lie to my face,
[01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:35.300]  going to spit in my face and then tell me it's raining? Well, I just think it's
[01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:38.860]  sick that Peter Fonda is dreaming about little kids getting raped by pedophiles.
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:43.420]  I mean, I'm not saying he's a pedophile. I'm just saying that, you know, that he
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:46.500]  and Hayden could start a new movie about two pedophiles that go on a cross
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:50.620]  country trip together. I'm serious. These people are sick. We'll be right back with

[01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:32.260]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:34:02.220]  Well, we've got Mike Cernovich via the Skype and we've got the amazing
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:07.460]  Lucas & Studio with us, but I wanted to just play a short clip of Bill Maher and
[01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:10.540]  I'll play the longer clip because it appears he's having some type of weird
[01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:14.060]  mental breakdown because everything he says in these in these little periods
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:19.420]  with little scripted images beside him are a teleprompter. No folks have been
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:23.620]  there at the production. So what he does is monologue it's a teleprompter and so
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:29.340]  the stuff they wrote doesn't make any sense. A stick Mike Cernovich has had
[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:33.740]  none of them have children eat his dead head. He hopes Mike Cernovich commit
[01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:39.100]  suicide and I think it's because he's so destroyed by Mike Cernovich pointing out
[01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:43.020]  that suicides you have 10,000 extra suicides for every recession that they
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:46.940]  basically double and that he was calling for an economic crash and that I pointed
[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:50.260]  this out that he's makes 10 million dollars a year on his contract. He's had
[01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:54.020]  10 seasons they say he's been paid a hundred million of a variety reports that
[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:59.620]  he says I'm a liar. So why are they every week now singling myself and Mike
[01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:04.260]  Cernovich out on these TV programs? What is it that triggers them about Mike
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:07.940]  Cernovich and Alex Jones? But I got to say I'm getting a little jealous when
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:11.060]  they're saying they want to kill you. Now that happens sometimes but I haven't had
[01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:15.820]  that yet from from old old Bill Maher. He looks like he is about to kill
[01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:19.340]  himself when he talks about me. So this is very interesting psychology and Mike
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:23.820]  Cernovich gets into the psychology from a kind of archetypal union way. I think
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:26.620]  that's what scares him. So let's play the clip get Mike Cernovich's take here it is.
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:31.700]  Mike Cernovich said suicides increased during recessions. Bill Maher wants people
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:38.740]  to die. Yes specifically Mike Cernovich.
[01:35:40.740 --> 01:35:44.100]  I guess it's about laughing about people die. I want him to put his head in the
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:51.620]  oven so starving kids confuse it for food. Why? No I don't why. I don't know who
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:58.900]  the f*** are Mike Cernovich but I want you to live a long healthy life and get
[01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:03.180]  the help you so desperately need. So he talks about convoluted craziness and
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:06.780]  before that he says I'm lying about him being rich and a
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:11.660]  depression not hurting him which is total truth. So amazing looks before we go to
[01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:15.340]  Mike Cernovich what do you make of that it just doesn't even make sense. That's
[01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:20.140]  the first time me hearing him saying put the head in the oven I was just but it's
[01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:25.060]  once again it's a crowd going laughing it up. I think that's the goal get him to
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:30.780]  laugh about killing us. It's just an incitement to kill us. That's what Cernovich said a
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:33.740]  year ago I said why are they doing this he goes they just want to start
[01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:39.180]  killing us they're gearing up for killing us. It's this process of dehumanization
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:43.300]  saying you know what they're saying is absolutely it's all conspiracy theories
[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:46.660]  and everything so that way people don't go in and search what you're actually
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:51.460]  saying it's true. Absolutely well Mike what do you make of this latest meltdown
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:56.080]  I mean it just adds the whole harass conservatives harass Trump people kill
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:01.820]  Trump dump hot coffee on Alex Jones Sue Alex Jones bank rep libertarian media
[01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:06.100]  docks the ICE agents I mean they're gearing up it appears at the end of
[01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:10.620]  summer here to really try to launch a violent overthrow. Yeah I mean there's a
[01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:16.780]  number of things one is that Bill Meyer was triggered by the truth because we
[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:20.620]  now troll with the truth. The number one thing that I've learned over the years
[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:25.460]  is that the left the way to really trigger the left is with facts and logic
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:29.700]  and reason and they didn't have any he didn't have any issue to what I said
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:33.380]  because if you do want a recession you are saying you want people to kill
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:36.980]  themselves and then of course you know when Anthony Bourdain Bourdain kill
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:42.140]  themselves all of the worst people in the world are like oh we're so sad call
[01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:47.580]  the hotline love oh my god your life matters and then like the next day they're
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:51.260]  like yeah kill conservatives hunt them down rape their children throw them in
[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:56.220]  cages have pedophiles rape children in front of their moms yeah that's what
[01:37:56.220 --> 01:38:00.740]  we're gonna do so we're exposing their hypocrisy and they don't have an
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:04.460]  answer for it. And they seem to be going crazier by the minute I asked you this
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:08.660]  question about two years ago I said you're during the campaign what is peak
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:14.020]  insane libtard behavior but now they're not so much libtards they're like like
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:19.340]  crazy Tasmanian devils that lie and attack logic and are just I mean they
[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:24.380]  are really it seems degenerating. Well they know that they're not going to
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:29.900]  win in November that's what is amusing me is they're not playing like winners
[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:35.300]  if so people have noticed that I used to be a very I don't know I used to be a
[01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:38.380]  little bit of a wild man and I've calmed down and they go oh is having a
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:45.020]  daughter calm you down and the answer is no we were winning you know we are the
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:50.060]  voice of reason now and the left they keep claiming they're going to November
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:53.660]  but they have no solutions they have no answer so here's what the left stands
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:58.220]  for this is now truth by the way this is all confirmed the left now stands for a
[01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:03.820]  branding women as the nexium sex cult did and if you look into the donors and
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:07.220]  the connections to some of the Clinton Foundation donors you're gonna find
[01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:11.140]  connections there Eric Schneider men or whatever the former attorney general to
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:17.140]  New York endorses calling brown women his slaves remember he made one girlfriend
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:21.340]  where a slave caller so they endorse branding women they endorse slavery and
[01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:26.620]  they endorse kidnapping and raping children in front of their mothers that
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:30.980]  is the platform of the modern left and quite frankly that is terrifying and
[01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:36.260]  you're not just saying that because I remember growing up and I mean nobody
[01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:39.580]  was racist in my family that's what shameful losers were into that finally
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:42.100]  get around Democrats and I travel around the country and I'm not saying the east
[01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:45.900]  is bad but I hear people say racist stuff and I was like what I was like are
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:48.940]  you trying to see if I'm racist because I don't agree with this and it was it
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:52.500]  was Democrats and I'm and I'm I could tell all the stories it would take all
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:56.940]  day but that's when I began to discover that Democrats at the top and at the
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:40:01.540]  middle level are just sick criminals I mean I'm sorry it's just true yeah and
[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:04.580]  you're absolutely right and they're the main ones who are racist but what they've
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:09.180]  done is they've managed to now go so far as to change our history books so now
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:13.620]  children are growing up learning what they want them to believe and I'm like
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:18.220]  that's that's that's demonic it's Machiavellian and you know what they
[01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:21.620]  have this whole idea of the party switch the party switch I'm like there is
[01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:25.940]  that's the most historical just just absolute drivel it's a prattle but they
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:29.260]  keep repeating it and says gaslighting of repetition once you repeat something
[01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:33.380]  everyone around you is repeating it well now slowly becomes truth and the
[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:35.740]  people who are actually telling the truth well now they're seeing as the
[01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:44.380]  crazies I agree Mike speaking of racist Democrats there's a video terrible video
[01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:51.660]  shows a a white woman purportedly harassing a Mexican-American citizen
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:56.140]  and everything and I'm just wondering why that woman nobody seems to know who
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:59.940]  she is they keep calling her an unidentified woman which I find
[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:04.500]  interesting because the media is always able to find you know anonymous
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:08.300]  gift-makers anonymous people they have no problem with that but when they're
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:12.540]  saying is the left is famous for staging false flags the police say
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:18.140]  something like 98% of poop swastikas and you know stuff that the Air Force
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:21.940]  Academy it's the left doing it to themselves is what you're saying well
[01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:26.220]  I'm saying I'm just wondering why we don't know who the woman's name yet I
[01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:29.980]  grew up in a small town the running Springs California the town where the
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:35.260]  video was filmed 5,000 people in a town of 5,000 people if someone in that town
[01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:40.300]  makes national news international news talk of the town right they're gonna be
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:45.580]  in the paper that day yeah so I've been on every public Facebook group for
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:49.540]  running Springs California nobody's saying oh my god I can't believe this
[01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:53.620]  woman in Paris says nobody's identified her in this very very small town yeah we
[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:58.860]  haven't played that video yet I saw that we should queue that up and if you go
[01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:04.100]  to CNN's website it's all like watch this man tell Mexicans to get out of the
[01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:07.940]  restaurant and you watch it and it's bad acting who actually walks in and goes
[01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:15.020]  Mexicans get out of here I mean it's so fake it is but the thing is desperate
[01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:20.940]  times call for desperate measures and as we get closer and closer it's just
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:26.380]  gonna get more desperate and desperate I agree yeah I've got a thousand questions
[01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:29.340]  for both of you but Mike Sermos we come back what else is on your radar screen
[01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:33.700]  you want to head well I think that video is very important for maybe all of us to
[01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:38.700]  watch and discuss because it raises a lot of issues all I know is remember the
[01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:42.660]  attacks on the synagogues the attacks on the Jewish cemeteries and then Trump
[01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:46.580]  said I think that might be staged they go oh my god they're anti-Semitic and it
[01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:52.420]  turned out it was a leftist Jewish guy did it I mean I'm just I'm sorry I've
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:58.060]  dealt with this myself folks that's all these people do is lie choose to take

[01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:05.100]  the real drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us on the
[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:09.740]  big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid
[01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:15.220]  rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:20.020]  the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of
[01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:25.780]  tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in
[01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:30.700]  fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we
[01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:34.980]  tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the
[01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:40.260]  heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:45.860]  levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:50.500]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:55.380]  rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will

[01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:42.100]  striking back we now take you live to the central Texas Command Center in the
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:47.840]  heart of the resistance you're listening to Alex Jones I don't want to give these
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:50.620]  people attention but at this point we've got to cover it I'm used to death
[01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:55.580]  threats but these are very specific now they're targeting libertarians
[01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:59.220]  patriots Christians families I was talking to Mike he was showing me some
[01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:02.180]  stuff I'm not going to give attention to but he was showing me stuff off record
[01:48:02.180 --> 01:48:06.020]  what they're doing to him and his family and it's massive it's coordinated it's
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:13.540]  doxing and it's incredible and we've got the amazing Lucas writing shotgun I
[01:48:13.540 --> 01:48:17.540]  hear whether Cernovich.com Twitter at Cernovich Mike Cernovich is here he
[01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:22.100]  wanted to get into and I'm glad he raises this see it Trump supporter
[01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:25.500]  threatens landscapers because their Mexican calls them rapists and animals
[01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:35.380]  now you watch something like this and this is the most ridiculous thing on
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:42.260]  earth and the the guy being yelled at looks real like I don't think he knows
[01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:46.740]  that this is going on but this is the type of false flag leftist have been
[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:50.660]  caught doing over and over and over again and and frankly if white supremacists
[01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:53.580]  have been caught doing it too there's been a lot of famous cases where a
[01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:58.780]  white woman will carve stuff on her and say that black guys raped her I don't
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:01.940]  know why I'm a news guy I read the news I've seen that probably ten times and
[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:06.580]  there's also the other way around where you know black ladies will carve
[01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:09.940]  swastikas on themselves and say white guys did it hell it happened in Austin a
[01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:13.340]  few years ago happened in college station I know two cases in Texas so
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:17.580]  there's this thing about being a victim and wanting the attention I'm not saying
[01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:20.260]  this is fake we're gonna play the video though but I think Mike Cernovich is
[01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:25.620]  right just the fact that you go to CNN every day there's some weird video and
[01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:28.540]  I won't even say it because they edit what I say when I do stuff out of
[01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:31.260]  context and then say that I'm saying like Megan Kelly did I said Hillary's
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:34.020]  responsible for killing tens of thousands of children in the Middle East
[01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:37.940]  they edit together about some pizza place so I get sued and now she's gonna get
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:40.820]  well I'm not gonna say it I'm gonna say it make to the surprise comes the point
[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:45.820]  is is that Mike Cernovich this is next level yeah yeah exactly I'm not saying
[01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:51.860]  it's fake in fact what I found interesting about this video is most
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:57.620]  Trump supporters 99% will go I've never seen a Trump supporter act like that
[01:49:57.620 --> 01:50:01.420]  that's why yeah find out who is this woman did she estate from a mental
[01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:06.460]  institution yeah does she need help maybe she's psychiatric care she oh I
[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:10.060]  get your angle cuz she does come off as a little bit wacky you're saying it may
[01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:13.460]  not be completely staged but people know who she is in the town know she's a
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:18.420]  local in and are protecting that yes I'm worried about this woman's that's an
[01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:22.180]  unstable thing I mean just going up to complete strangers and putting your
[01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:26.540]  hands in someone's face is a very violent that sounds like the Democrats so
[01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:31.060]  it's very weird so it could be she you know it's just the town you know has
[01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:36.380]  really problems or whatever but for me what I find compelling is that if you
[01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:42.180]  make a gif or whatever they can find you even if you're anonymous but nobody's
[01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:47.100]  identified it every video says unidentified white woman nobody on the
[01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:51.260]  the private or the public Facebook no one's looking because normally it'd be
[01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:56.700]  the search for who she is who is this idiot bigot like permit Patty for
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:51:00.980]  example so there was that woman in San Francisco who by the way was a liberal
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:06.020]  she was actually a liberal a weedhead and she wanted to call the police in an
[01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:09.580]  eight-year-old African-American girl who was selling bottled water they dubbed
[01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:14.340]  her permit Patty they found out who she was in 30 minutes right permit Patty
[01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:19.740]  was a recent case of a San Francisco liberal going after an African-American
[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:24.780]  entrepreneur they found her 30 seconds right like no problem but with this
[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:28.940]  woman here in running Springs it's actually easier to find out who someone
[01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:32.900]  is in a small town because if you grew up in a small town and you see a local
[01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:36.860]  person on seeing I agree so what do you think they know she's the local crank
[01:51:36.860 --> 01:51:41.620]  and they're covering that up and she's probably a Democrat my my best guess
[01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:46.700]  would be that she is a local a senile person that they actually feel sorry for
[01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:52.220]  me and that they're just yeah yeah and somebody sent her over well I mean but
[01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:54.700]  once I went and watched the video the guy looks like he's legitimately being
[01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:59.260]  bitched at she just looks either like she's it's a setup or she's nuts I don't
[01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:02.780]  mean that meanly she does look like what you'd see on the street corner you know
[01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:07.380]  somebody that schizophrenic yeah that that's exactly what I'm saying is I
[01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:13.300]  think maybe like a local person goes oh let's send this crazy and again I don't
[01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:16.740]  my mother has been in institutions for bipolar I take mental illness very
[01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:20.180]  seriously so I'm not being we're not making fun of her yeah she just yeah
[01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:25.260]  well let me say this I've never seen the racist stuff people talk about until I
[01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:29.180]  was getting divorced and my money was locked up and I couldn't get a house so
[01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:32.860]  I got a you know three-room condo and I was around the so-called leftist elitist
[01:52:32.860 --> 01:52:36.620]  and I heard you know some race stuff from them but they hated everybody
[01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:39.820]  everybody when somebody else would walk over we were grilling hamburgers out of
[01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:42.820]  the pool they talk crap about them they talk crap about the next person they
[01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:46.540]  look at that dumb redneck this person but they had these cool guys that
[01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:49.780]  happen to be black that would detail your cars for a really good price in that
[01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:53.260]  in the garage so I started finding how much they were I started getting them
[01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:58.100]  to clean my car once every two weeks and I twice saw ladies and then Mercedes or
[01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:01.580]  whatever go over to the black guy that's like in somebody's car cleaning it
[01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:05.220]  obviously they're going what are you doing in here black guy so I get that goes
[01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:09.220]  on it was very upsetting to me that but but and again I found out who these
[01:53:09.220 --> 01:53:14.020]  women were guess what Mike they weren't conservatives well that was what permit
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:19.860]  Patty proved permit Patty was the the face of modern mainstream liberalism
[01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:24.500]  lives in San Francisco selling marijuana because if you're white woman in
[01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:27.940]  San Francisco you can sell marijuana and not go to jail but if you're a young
[01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:31.540]  african-american girl trying to sell bottled water they want to rush you so
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:37.220]  permit Patty is that she is the face of modern white liberalism they love to
[01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:41.900]  call the police well that was my thing it wasn't even some I was embarrassed by
[01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:44.860]  how these women were actually the two times I saw it and the way these guys
[01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:48.300]  were so nice you tell that must happen all the time okay man here's my car
[01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:51.100]  would you like me to do your car I'm blah blah blah the guys were cool
[01:53:51.100 --> 01:53:54.420]  like I saw that once is why I got them to start doing my cars and they said yeah
[01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:58.300]  I know what happens every day but the fact was they were you guys I don't care
[01:53:58.300 --> 01:54:00.700]  make it a hundred grand a year doing this put these people whatever but the
[01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:04.340]  point was those guys weren't victims they were entrepreneurs doing a good job
[01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:08.180]  stand and getting pushed around but but they didn't take it on like oh I got a
[01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:11.180]  bunch of weird old white people messing with me I'm gonna freak out listen I
[01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:13.740]  gotta live in a gay community because of threats I don't like living in even a
[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:17.660]  fancy neighborhood and then all those old weirdos hate my ass man because I'm
[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:21.140]  not in the country club I don't play all that do I turn into this big victim
[01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:24.740]  because every one of these old blue blood mummies doesn't like me no I could
[01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:28.740]  care less yeah is this is this ideology of this victim hood mentality which they
[01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:31.460]  have been instilled in the black community and these white liberals are
[01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:36.260]  the most racist people that you will ever come across and the beautiful thing
[01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:40.500]  about that story is well guess what they've set the system in place that if
[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:43.580]  you were to see that what's the first thing most people think oh that must be
[01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:47.220]  a Republican because Republicans are the racists the Nazis they hate they hate
[01:54:47.220 --> 01:54:50.900]  Hispanics and the second thing is they don't even have to mention who she's
[01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:54.380]  with because they already have that set in place so they can just show just show
[01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:57.940]  there you go there it is same thing they do with Trump when they run out of
[01:54:57.940 --> 01:55:02.180]  stories what do they do they make they come up with stuff well is he being
[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:05.620]  impeached is he colluding with so-and-so is this happening
[01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:11.580]  Tom Arnold says he's a he's going down well yeah the issue with the white
[01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:15.860]  liberals too is I don't even know if it's fair to call them racist they just they
[01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:19.740]  hate everybody for a difference that's what I was saying I noticed that liberals
[01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:24.300]  living down at the Ashen for three years I learned it they talk crap about
[01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:30.020]  they hate everybody hmm I mean a conservative Republic of the successful
[01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:33.900]  would know who people are cleaning cars nothing is left is so stupid they're
[01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:37.620]  always afraid of everything too sorry go ahead Mike well speaking of liberals
[01:55:37.620 --> 01:55:42.140]  let's talk about your friend Ron Perlman who challenged you to a fight and
[01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:47.100]  then back down and he goes oh I urinated in my hand before I shook Harvey
[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:52.180]  Weinstein's hand and I don't know if you saw that tweet no I didn't even know he
[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:57.180]  back down oh I saw it yeah yeah so he Ron Perlman admitted that he knew about
[01:55:57.180 --> 01:56:01.300]  Harvey Weinstein what Weinstein was doing and he's such a why was Perlman even mad at
[01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:08.180]  me I saw the news when he said he wanted to fill me in cuz I can't keep track all
[01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:12.780]  this stuff what how do you back down what happened well no no well Ron Perlman
[01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:17.460]  had challenged you to a fight and then we were on your show and we accepted and
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:24.020]  then he back down and hid and went you know yeah but so what he did was he
[01:56:24.020 --> 01:56:28.140]  tweeted out yesterday the day before he said I was at a charity gala and Harvey
[01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:32.700]  Weinstein told me I'd better shake his hand so I went into the bathroom and I
[01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:38.980]  took a urination on my hand and then I shook Harvey Weinstein's hand sounds
[01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:43.420]  like mental illness that's what I'm saying who does that but it's also
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:48.220]  showing this this pure cowardice just pure cowardice he's thinking he's
[01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:51.860]  standing up to the man I'm like what you did was like some passive aggressive
[01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:57.100]  little cowardice thing and that's what they are their cowards at their core see
[01:56:57.100 --> 01:57:00.780]  I would shake Weinstein's hand and then not let go of it and turn my camera on
[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:07.300]  I've done that before and and short-ass and serious questions yeah but so the
[01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:11.380]  Ron Perlman thing really just typifies everything that the thing is they never
[01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:15.380]  challenged you never challenge anybody in their own peer group right they've
[01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:18.340]  never asked Bill Clinton if he's a rapist they never asked Harvey Weinstein
[01:57:18.340 --> 01:57:22.380]  about anything none of these media matters left-wing washout groups ever do
[01:57:22.380 --> 01:57:26.540]  it so Ron Perlman oh big tough guy peed in my hand and shook Harvey Weinstein's
[01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:30.380]  hand yeah way to go buddy wait show everybody how tough show plus Perlman
[01:57:30.380 --> 01:57:34.860]  didn't know the secret even if he was in shape he might start winning at first
[01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:37.860]  but once he starts hurting me that's when he gets hurt because I'm not looking
[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:40.900]  for trouble but he's just a total punk when we kind of we're gonna come right
[01:57:40.900 --> 01:57:44.460]  back with Mike Cernovich and more right on the other side the amazing Lucas I'm
[01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:49.100]  gonna ask him what he predicts coming up we've taken thousands of years of known
[01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:53.700]  research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to
[01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:57.300]  find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify
[01:57:57.300 --> 01:58:01.500]  the body that's why I'm introducing the Z shield toxic metal and chemical
[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:06.460]  defense support it's made in the USA it's filled with known compounds from
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:09.940]  nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:14.580]  supports the info or it is a classical 360 win this is the formula that I
[01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:18.540]  personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as
[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:22.940]  close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get you

[02:00:45.260 --> 02:00:49.940]  support of a rates landscaper because they're mexican calls them rapist and
[02:00:49.940 --> 02:00:55.300]  animals well you know i don't show people the old videos of his spanish
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:59.300]  gang members beating up white people are you know racial racial attacks of
[02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:02.940]  black folks target white people that that goes on but imagine i ran it hundreds
[02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:06.380]  of times and said black people don't you feel bad for the knockout game no we've
[02:01:06.380 --> 02:01:09.060]  played it we've talked about it once or twice we don't but they're gonna run
[02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:11.900]  this forever the point is they're bad people in every group so let's go ahead
[02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:15.180]  and roll some of this bizarre video that took place in california and like
[02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:18.660]  mike sort of it said why is there not a search for who this lady is in this town
[02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:22.700]  of 5,000 people because you can tell she's in people's faces all day is she
[02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:26.460]  bipolar is she schizophrenic i'm not trying to defame her i'm just saying she
[02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:29.460]  looks like a crazy person here it is
[02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:37.460]  i don't know why you hate us why do you hate us because we're mexicans we're honest people right here
[02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:44.460]  rapist? how many people have i raped? how many people how many drugs have i dealt?
[02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:50.460]  well oh yeah you believe everything you see on the news? do you see how we're working hard right here?
[02:01:50.460 --> 02:01:53.100]  hey well that idiot lady doesn't even know that guy's probably been her 5,000
[02:01:53.100 --> 02:02:02.100]  racists. no, look here. I don't know any rational person who behaved like that.
[02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:06.540]  wow, seeing someone look at her face when she turns the camera she should be
[02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:10.420]  that has that crazy person look can we can we get her when she turns the
[02:02:10.420 --> 02:02:15.420]  camera and blow her face up? i mean she's a lun bag what are you gonna say? i just i
[02:02:15.420 --> 02:02:19.020]  don't see how any rational person or insane of mind would behave that way
[02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:26.020]  knowing that they're being recorded. look at her. i mean
[02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:33.420]  that woman is guaranteed probably has Alzheimer's i think like certain of it
[02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:37.740]  said that's the look of dementia and i somebody might have wound her up too
[02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:42.940]  like hey betty we'll give you $100 you go out and mess with those mexicans out
[02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:46.940]  there well what do you think Mike you're a smart guy got level yeah and it got
[02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:51.140]  level i think some local teenagers or something just because we had people like
[02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:55.220]  that ride grew up where don't step on the grass and then you step on the grass
[02:02:55.220 --> 02:02:59.580]  and the old you know she would come out you know exactly they come like the
[02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:03.540]  wicked west so growing a small town we actually had two women like that older
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:07.740]  women and as a kid this was mean but and you do stuff to them and then blame it
[02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:11.580]  on somebody else i didn't do about new kids that did it exactly so i bet
[02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:16.860]  somebody broke in her house and then said hey betty it's the mexicans mm yeah
[02:03:16.860 --> 02:03:20.140]  they wound her up they knocked on her door oh those are the people i saw they
[02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:23.820]  were looking in that's why you don't see anything before the video or after she's
[02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:29.180]  that little clip right it's like a 29 31 second clip even though there's still
[02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:32.940]  like a conversation on going like she hasn't stopped no that's the look of
[02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:35.580]  the brain shutting down like look at how the nerves are even attached to her
[02:03:35.580 --> 02:03:40.500]  mouth you know it's sad she has that look yeah i mean it's definitely a
[02:03:40.500 --> 02:03:44.340]  tragedy so i that's why i'm trying to figure out you know did some local
[02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:50.100]  teenagers harass this poor woman and you know just wind her up and lighter or
[02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:54.180]  whatever that's why i just want to know why the media is not trying to find out
[02:03:54.180 --> 02:03:57.700]  who that is and that's why i want to get a bunch of extra reporters hired and i
[02:03:57.700 --> 02:04:01.380]  didn't plug last hour and fund ourselves which is my problem i don't plug
[02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:04.660]  enough when i plug we get the money to fund things expand is that i'd love to
[02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:07.540]  have a crew that like because mike always has great ideas my terms is always
[02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:12.820]  like hey hillary's coming to or or or um booklet is coming to town and he just
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:15.780]  always just hey why don't you do cnn's terrorist why don't you always great
[02:04:15.780 --> 02:04:19.860]  ideas and then he's like hey he'd call up and say hey why don't you send a crew
[02:04:19.860 --> 02:04:23.540]  here in fact i can even have you starting to miss just i have a crew that you
[02:04:23.540 --> 02:04:27.140]  direct or something it can be the jones sternovich crew i i all can pay for it
[02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:30.260]  god just because everything you every that's why they don't like you
[02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:34.500]  everything you've done is turned to gold that's what it is well that that's the
[02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:37.700]  idea is we could get somebody there to interview the townspeople and
[02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:41.060]  hold that picture and say do you know who this woman is but the key is it's
[02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:44.740]  got to be done right when it breaks yeah you know rapid response force you have
[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:49.140]  to yeah because then it just spreads like a wildfire
[02:04:49.140 --> 02:04:52.820]  amazing lucas is in studio and of course the amazing mike sternovich i'm alex
[02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:57.540]  jones info wars dot com living in volcano
[02:04:57.540 --> 02:05:02.020]  may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in
[02:05:02.020 --> 02:05:06.260]  leilania states but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water
[02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:09.700]  and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:13.220]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[02:05:13.220 --> 02:05:17.060]  and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels
[02:05:17.060 --> 02:05:21.300]  to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:26.340]  alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels
[02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:29.300]  of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[02:05:29.300 --> 02:05:33.140]  next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter
[02:05:33.140 --> 02:05:36.660]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:40.340]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels
[02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:45.620]  as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of the water
[02:05:45.620 --> 02:05:49.780]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[02:05:49.780 --> 02:05:53.060]  rainwater supply but more importantly a good
[02:05:53.060 --> 02:06:01.060]  water filtration system will purify it

[02:06:05.780 --> 02:06:09.060]  it's alex jones
[02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:17.780]  the amazing lucas riding shotgun with myself and mike sternovitz just made a
[02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:20.740]  great point do we forget that even when ran
[02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:24.580]  paul was running for the senate they caught
[02:06:24.580 --> 02:06:27.780]  democrats and i remember seeing the photos on air and saying
[02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:31.220]  folks got to go search who this is who is this in this town in kentucky and they
[02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:35.060]  found he was worked for the campaign of the democrats
[02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:38.660]  that uh he was running against and and they're out there in hay seat outfits
[02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:42.820]  with a with a farmer hat and and and coveralls or
[02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:47.940]  overalls with signs going i love the kkk and i love ran paul
[02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:51.540]  and i hate the mexicans and the media show deceptive they'll take that and
[02:06:51.540 --> 02:06:54.660]  play it and say see there's jones like once i said i don't hate gay people i
[02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:58.660]  love gay people i love everybody i don't hate gay people
[02:06:58.660 --> 02:07:01.220]  they edited it show a little bit of screen on cobear
[02:07:01.220 --> 02:07:04.500]  where you can't even see the edit goes i hate gay people i mean
[02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:08.660]  i'm telling you man and so he was making the point that
[02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:12.660]  they have caught people thousands of times they've been caught staging
[02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:16.260]  things yeah i mean it's not that far it's not that big of a stretch and then
[02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:18.980]  that's that's really the scary thing because during the election what they
[02:07:18.980 --> 02:07:21.540]  were doing they were planting people in the trump rallies
[02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:25.700]  to cause the problem to cause a stir and it came out wiki looks we were right
[02:07:25.700 --> 02:07:29.780]  exactly so i mean like i said desperate times calls for desperate measures
[02:07:29.780 --> 02:07:32.980]  it would make sense why they would do the you know put out a piece like that
[02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:36.020]  just reinforce it the same thing where you have with the police
[02:07:36.020 --> 02:07:39.540]  and the video camera comes out and what they said is turns out to be just a
[02:07:39.540 --> 02:07:42.980]  member of the NAACP head yeah said that the guy called me all these racial
[02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:46.660]  names and did all these horrible things the cop lets him off like three things
[02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:50.260]  the car's not registered right all this stuff's missing the cops totally polite
[02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:54.420]  and it's the whole and i never but here's the thing i didn't air that
[02:07:54.420 --> 02:07:58.340]  we had an article but i couldn't even air it because i felt like it would
[02:07:58.340 --> 02:08:01.300]  create more division and that's my point i'm making about taking
[02:08:01.300 --> 02:08:03.700]  something embarrassing like this and running it over and over again yeah
[02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:07.700]  now did i do the right thing mic not ever airing the NAACP head
[02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:11.460]  in a major city being a race baiting horrible liar i just
[02:08:11.460 --> 02:08:14.820]  i could hardly watch it once and because i felt sorry
[02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:18.180]  for humanity that they've programmed people
[02:08:18.180 --> 02:08:21.540]  to have the cop kiss his ass and then have him
[02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:25.220]  lie about the cop and try to get the cop fired not knowing
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:29.700]  cops all got cameras on him now what do you think mic what do you think amazing
[02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:33.220]  Lucas well yeah there was also that case where
[02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:37.300]  Sean King falsely accused the police officer of raping a woman
[02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:40.900]  millions of people saw these allegations and everything so
[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:46.180]  i i'm like you where i don't like race baiting and what i found is you don't
[02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:49.220]  when you when you report on too many of these stories
[02:08:49.220 --> 02:08:53.460]  you do attract that small percentage of people the left and the right
[02:08:53.460 --> 02:08:57.460]  who are just toxic and looking for some of the blame so yeah i understand you
[02:08:57.460 --> 02:09:00.660]  don't want to attract that crowd it's a it's a bad crowd there aren't a lot of
[02:09:00.660 --> 02:09:04.100]  them but but they're a bad crowd but on the other hand
[02:09:04.100 --> 02:09:07.780]  you you do you know as journalists we do want to tell the truth and when there
[02:09:07.780 --> 02:09:10.580]  are hoaxes we do want to call out those hoaxes there's an example we used to
[02:09:10.580 --> 02:09:13.540]  run our own comments till about five six years ago and when somebody threatened
[02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:16.100]  the president secret serves would show up as i said hey
[02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:19.700]  let's go to the third party thing like discus show i don't have control to see
[02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:23.700]  it anymore but back then we would go in and see the commenters going
[02:09:23.700 --> 02:09:26.900]  you know and again i can't even the media showed us up now i can't even say i
[02:09:26.900 --> 02:09:29.940]  can't quote stuff down as they edit it they cover my mouth they would say
[02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:33.540]  stuff like kill the inwards do all this other stuff and then they'd have
[02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:36.180]  people said they were black folks they would kill the horrible whites were
[02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:38.340]  going to kill you and then my it people we did
[02:09:38.340 --> 02:09:42.100]  were videos on this we ought to find them and it was the same groups of people
[02:09:42.100 --> 02:09:46.100]  and we tracked it back to pr firms who weren't even hiding their identities
[02:09:46.100 --> 02:09:49.300]  who had what they called sock puppets back then now they call them bots
[02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:53.060]  and they had hundreds of bots on the sites that would go into a story about
[02:09:53.060 --> 02:09:56.500]  fluoride bad for your children and it would just be
[02:09:56.500 --> 02:10:00.740]  inward inward inward white crackerhead you know just huge fight and all it was
[02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:03.940]  was some pr firm creating division i mean that is
[02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:07.380]  that is crazy and that's all you need all you need is that one person that one
[02:10:07.380 --> 02:10:11.060]  story and then you can guilt through association
[02:10:11.060 --> 02:10:14.020]  that's how they do it and spreads like wildfire and they repeat and repeat and
[02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:17.060]  show it show it again and again it's even the news twitter box
[02:10:17.060 --> 02:10:20.420]  put out racial slurs and i remember talking to it and they're like we should
[02:10:20.420 --> 02:10:23.780]  just get rid of comments and i said no people like it but
[02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:26.580]  mike what do we do i mean because because i don't want to be too confident
[02:10:26.580 --> 02:10:29.940]  humanity's waking up the globalists are in trouble the u n says we're going to
[02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:33.060]  take over the e u now the military is going to stop nations that don't bring
[02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:36.980]  in the islamics i mean it's now a world government war against nation states
[02:10:36.980 --> 02:10:40.660]  people are waking up but at the same time i just at a gut level
[02:10:40.660 --> 02:10:44.340]  i feel like we're not doing enough and you know i talked to my level folks this
[02:10:44.340 --> 02:10:47.780]  week i'd heard from a while but they literally asked me what do you think we
[02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:50.500]  should do and i was like are you pat me on the head they're like no
[02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:54.820]  go with your gut tell us what we should do and it was actually
[02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:58.740]  very stressful to be told this now that i'm being asked what to do and it wasn't
[02:10:58.740 --> 02:11:00.980]  condescension so what do you think we should do
[02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:04.340]  they're asking us they're listening to the show the white house is
[02:11:04.340 --> 02:11:08.500]  what do we do yeah we have to spread more
[02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:12.100]  radical love a lot of people have noticed that
[02:11:12.100 --> 02:11:16.740]  when you insult me now i say i love you god loves you i wish blessings on you
[02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:20.020]  i used to be known for just body slamming people you know you'd come at me and i
[02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:23.460]  would call you you know any kind of despicable name i could
[02:11:23.460 --> 02:11:28.740]  but then i realized that the the energy right now the demonic energy of the
[02:11:28.740 --> 02:11:32.100]  left is so strong that it's up to the good people
[02:11:32.100 --> 02:11:35.860]  always be polite super polite and that's why marz said he wants you to die it's
[02:11:35.860 --> 02:11:38.980]  the love that's their scare to kanya yeah it's the love
[02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:42.980]  absolutely and you need to give it to them give them the truth but do it do it
[02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:46.180]  you know do it's love so what do i do if i'm sitting
[02:11:46.180 --> 02:11:49.300]  with my family at brunch and people walk over and go
[02:11:49.300 --> 02:11:52.660]  you're a racist you're a terrorist you're going down jones and won't stop
[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:55.700]  what do i do i guess i get up like kanya did when he was at tmz and just go i
[02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:58.340]  love you i love you whatever i did i'm sorry i'm
[02:11:58.340 --> 02:12:02.180]  i'm sorry how have you took it wrong i'm sorry i said that's what i've been
[02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:04.580]  thinking because even though i didn't really do what they're saying i'm gonna
[02:12:04.580 --> 02:12:07.060]  say i'm sorry yeah because if you act if you
[02:12:07.060 --> 02:12:10.260]  do anything remotely that they would find aggressive that's
[02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:12.820]  it's done it's game over because that's what they're aiming for it that's what
[02:12:12.820 --> 02:12:16.260]  they want you to do no sure they get they get happy when i go f you
[02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:20.180]  you know and and i buttoned some big guy doing it because then you know that

[02:12:23.140 --> 02:12:26.740]  then then they like laugh and you know get off on it so so what do i do
[02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:29.620]  sarnovich yeah no that's what i've been doing i

[02:12:46.820 --> 02:12:49.620]  or zimmerman's like but we gotta stop and then a guy tried to run me over and
[02:12:49.620 --> 02:12:53.460]  they were forming mobs and we had to stay in the hotel the last day
[02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:58.180]  well yeah um we always want to film um because i was attacked by a guy actually
[02:12:58.180 --> 02:13:01.780]  at austin a year ago and i i punched him you know he

[02:13:04.980 --> 02:13:07.860]  the cop goes you're all right he i saw everything that happened and we just
[02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:12.420]  escorted out so yeah the the cameras are your best friends because they will lie
[02:13:12.420 --> 02:13:16.420]  and they will false flag you so definitely oh that happened three times in
[02:13:16.420 --> 02:13:20.020]  hawaii all three women came over and said you're a racist you're a russian
[02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:23.540]  you're a sandy hook and iron you are the children and then i would say hey let's

[02:13:54.580 --> 02:13:58.180]  well we're winning the moral high road so our job
[02:13:58.180 --> 02:14:02.180]  is to be impeccable i've even cleaned up my image you know me
[02:14:02.180 --> 02:14:05.540]  used to see me in just gym clothes all the time and never really cared about my
[02:14:05.540 --> 02:14:08.580]  hair never really got but but we have to just present up an
[02:14:08.580 --> 02:14:12.260]  impeccable leadership position we're in like yesterday i went on air i had a
[02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:15.860]  really bad headache allergies or whatever i just wore a t-shirt and i
[02:14:15.860 --> 02:14:18.980]  changed the middle of the show and put a sports jacket on because i knew the
[02:14:18.980 --> 02:14:22.180]  white house and the campaign everybody were actually
[02:14:22.180 --> 02:14:24.740]  let me ask you this though we'll do one more second with both of you but i don't
[02:14:24.740 --> 02:14:28.980]  want to get into inside baseball stuff but what do you make of high level
[02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:32.500]  folks asking info wars what do you think we should do what comes
[02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:35.140]  next and then it's not it's not a thing to pat us on the head
[02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:38.420]  they're literally asking me what they think we should do because they know our
[02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:41.540]  track record is so accurate predicting things
[02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:45.620]  yeah well and they also know that you know the audience is massive you know
[02:14:45.620 --> 02:14:50.740]  five to ten million people listen in every day so there that shows that they're
[02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:54.180]  they're waking up and they're learning who their friends are and who their
[02:14:54.180 --> 02:14:56.980]  friends aren't because a lot of people that know this but
[02:14:56.980 --> 02:15:00.580]  paul ryan is actually trying to get an amnesty bill passed as a way to
[02:15:00.580 --> 02:15:03.700]  suppress trump voter turnout that way he can help lead the
[02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:08.260]  impeachment against trump tragaudy um they finally realized what i've said
[02:15:08.260 --> 02:15:11.780]  many times on your show you said it first you said he was a mole
[02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:16.420]  yeah so that's it that's what they said is that man
[02:15:16.420 --> 02:15:19.620]  it was like we were right about the how the i mean we know what they're planning
[02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:22.660]  because we read what they say and it's like they're up in that bubble up there
[02:15:22.660 --> 02:15:24.980]  and they just can't believe how accurate we've been and i'm not trying to do our
[02:15:24.980 --> 02:15:28.100]  horn sorrows to them want to shut us down and you down because they know how
[02:15:28.100 --> 02:15:31.300]  accurate we are yeah and it's it's a war and

[02:21:08.180 --> 02:21:10.980]  and there's a revolt and i'm just going to tell you this
[02:21:10.980 --> 02:21:20.820]  kurt russell uh bruce willis um plentys would all those people and some big
[02:21:20.820 --> 02:21:25.060]  producers are really trying to crack hollywood right now
[02:21:25.060 --> 02:21:28.260]  and bring it back but bring it back just from an american of you show
[02:21:28.260 --> 02:21:32.740]  when you see kanye and all this that's what's going on beneath the surface
[02:21:32.740 --> 02:21:37.620]  and you know kanye west uh has been looking to go on other big liberty
[02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:42.420]  base shows and i know from folks that talk to him
[02:21:42.420 --> 02:21:45.380]  uh that they threatened to baker act him again so
[02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:48.100]  that's the point we all need to show courage in the face of this amazing
[02:21:48.100 --> 02:21:50.900]  lucas mic cernovich i wanted to ask you in a minute too you were saying some
[02:21:50.900 --> 02:21:54.420]  solution ideas what trump needs to do not some stunts but some things that
[02:21:54.420 --> 02:21:56.980]  really illustrate what's happening but amazing lucas what would you call this
[02:21:56.980 --> 02:22:01.620]  period we're in right now uh i would say a revolution honestly
[02:22:01.620 --> 02:22:05.060]  um because that's what's happening we're taking back america
[02:22:05.060 --> 02:22:08.660]  because when it comes to the media everywhere they're at the media
[02:22:08.660 --> 02:22:14.340]  hollywood uh magazines print tv we need to be right there behind them
[02:22:14.340 --> 02:22:18.740]  instead of putting out the truth and people see that contrast
[02:22:18.740 --> 02:22:23.700]  they'll they're waking up and they know when they call us right wing noxies
[02:22:23.700 --> 02:22:27.700]  anybody that's watched knows that i'm not even a conservative i'm like a
[02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:33.380]  common sense prosperity pro america guy how would you decide to find yourself
[02:22:33.380 --> 02:22:36.180]  it's not about talking about ourselves but they're always trying to define us
[02:22:36.180 --> 02:22:40.180]  so i think part of part of victory is defining who we are yeah i'm i've been
[02:22:40.180 --> 02:22:43.300]  called a nazi
[02:22:43.300 --> 02:22:47.860]  jesus what did you say to the moron when they said it i i was i was dumbfounded
[02:22:47.860 --> 02:22:52.100]  i was just like what
[02:22:52.660 --> 02:22:58.340]  that's all you can say because they're so gone that they truly believe it
[02:22:58.340 --> 02:23:03.300]  mike how would you define yourself i i get i get that all the time i'm like dude i'm
[02:23:03.300 --> 02:23:07.220]  you know i'm in a my daughter you know they're like oh you hate
[02:23:07.220 --> 02:23:11.220]  minorities i'm like well my daughter is you know you know not that it matters
[02:23:11.220 --> 02:23:14.820]  or whatever but it's just so weird that that's the thing that i that i learned
[02:23:14.820 --> 02:23:18.020]  about there are some lessons you know maybe we're digressing but
[02:23:18.020 --> 02:23:21.860]  you know alex mentioned covering his mouth earlier there are some lessons
[02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:26.340]  that i wish that i had known early on so anybody listening i once read a
[02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:30.820]  dramatic reading of charles manson's book and not realizing because i was naive
[02:23:30.820 --> 02:23:33.860]  at the time how they'll edit stuff and pretend that you actually really said
[02:23:33.860 --> 02:23:38.260]  that and the defining myself i go oh they call
[02:23:38.260 --> 02:23:41.220]  me this you're right on that sarcastically
[02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:44.900]  so what they do is they'll edit anything you say
[02:23:44.900 --> 02:23:48.020]  to try to define you is what you're not because me i'm not
[02:23:48.020 --> 02:23:52.100]  so we're your friends though and so is everybody else who knows who you are
[02:23:52.100 --> 02:23:55.860]  so when they get those edited tanks on you notice i didn't turn against you
[02:23:55.860 --> 02:23:59.940]  and it wasn't it wasn't in it was because i know you're real
[02:23:59.940 --> 02:24:03.460]  and i know what they do but exactly when i repeat what they say now i have to
[02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:06.660]  cover my mouth because they'll edit it
[02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:10.980]  yeah i do big hand gestures now whenever i do that whenever i do
[02:24:10.980 --> 02:24:14.820]  that messes up their jump cuts yeah and again the tricks they use though when
[02:24:14.820 --> 02:24:17.620]  you're ever watching a show they'll have a little screen
[02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:22.340]  like cobert will turn to it and i'll say i can't even say you know i hate the
[02:24:22.340 --> 02:24:25.540]  gay people i hate the black people and it's just edited stuff and then they
[02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:29.860]  just put it up there propaganda but that's what i mean like
[02:24:29.860 --> 02:24:33.780]  you want to get honest i mean i'm not a violent guy but the writers of cobert
[02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:37.620]  and people i'd like to you know sometimes i get let's just say this
[02:24:37.620 --> 02:24:41.380]  they're frauds they're con men and they get and they're bullies and they piss me
[02:24:41.380 --> 02:24:46.820]  off as only natural you that's why i worry about yeah
[02:24:46.820 --> 02:24:49.460]  well i'm saying that's why i'm worrying about your friend you know that riding
[02:24:49.460 --> 02:24:52.100]  shotgun and stuff you're gonna become a target now you're
[02:24:52.100 --> 02:24:56.340]  you're gonna media matters it's gonna you know smear you and everything you have
[02:24:56.340 --> 02:24:58.900]  no other choice though yeah talk about why you got off the
[02:24:58.900 --> 02:25:01.620]  me you didn't get off the fence but you had your own career and why you went
[02:25:01.620 --> 02:25:05.060]  public doing 3d animation i've you know i've always had a conservative
[02:25:05.060 --> 02:25:08.740]  had a conservative upbringing um and you know i was
[02:25:08.740 --> 02:25:12.180]  didn't really care anything about the eight years of obama because obama could
[02:25:12.180 --> 02:25:15.380]  have done anything and they would have just like oh it's greatest thing ever
[02:25:15.380 --> 02:25:19.540]  but what i realized is when trump came into office
[02:25:19.540 --> 02:25:22.260]  during the administration during his inauguration they were talking about well
[02:25:22.260 --> 02:25:26.660]  that his speech was reminding me of a dictator a dictator i heard the
[02:25:26.660 --> 02:25:30.340]  speech i was like okay that's interesting america's coming together we
[02:25:30.340 --> 02:25:33.060]  love each other yeah and then then it got to the
[02:25:33.060 --> 02:25:36.260]  point of being petty with the the crowd size oh that he's lying about the
[02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:38.420]  crowd size what else could he be lying about in the
[02:25:38.420 --> 02:25:42.340]  administration i'm like the man hasn't even stepped foot in the
[02:25:42.340 --> 02:25:46.340]  oval office and you're just already attacking him
[02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:50.900]  and then it got to the well the mok bus you he removed it you see he's a racist
[02:25:50.900 --> 02:25:55.220]  i was like then we find out that didn't happen and it's just been an attack after
[02:25:55.220 --> 02:25:59.060]  attacking a myriad of attacks i'm like hold up if they can attack the president
[02:25:59.060 --> 02:26:02.100]  of the united states like this and no one wants to mention
[02:26:02.100 --> 02:26:06.500]  that if hillary clinton had won mom would have been the word we wouldn't have
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:10.100]  found out about any of this and that's where they miscalculated i agree
[02:26:10.100 --> 02:26:12.820]  exactly you're gonna keep riding shotgun we've got a
[02:26:12.820 --> 02:26:19.140]  liberal journalist slash lawyer coming on uh who is pointing out this whole thing
[02:26:19.140 --> 02:26:22.900]  at the border is a hoax as well so that's coming up but but let me just ask
[02:26:22.900 --> 02:26:25.620]  you in closing mike as you pull me some inside baseball during the break won't
[02:26:25.620 --> 02:26:29.380]  get into who you met with but you were advising them on
[02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:33.140]  what you thought would be good things for the president to do so how does the
[02:26:33.140 --> 02:26:36.420]  president get ahead of them trying to cause a race war a culture war they're
[02:26:36.420 --> 02:26:40.660]  going to disguise as left versus right it's really a race war led by a bunch of
[02:26:40.660 --> 02:26:43.220]  weird white people i'm at the sense of virtue signal it's a bunch of damn white
[02:26:43.220 --> 02:26:45.940]  people liberal white people are the problem
[02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:49.620]  what how do we stop that what does trump need to do because we because you know
[02:26:49.620 --> 02:26:54.820]  we're in some serious situations here right so while i don't want to be you
[02:26:54.820 --> 02:26:58.020]  know taken out of context by the fake news media
[02:26:58.020 --> 02:27:01.140]  i will say that when ordinary trump supporters
[02:27:01.140 --> 02:27:06.580]  now face the kind of attacks that you and i and lucas and so many other people
[02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:11.060]  do that maybe now they're realizing oh the left isn't going to stop with the
[02:27:11.060 --> 02:27:14.500]  so-called french figures they're going to go after everybody and
[02:27:14.500 --> 02:27:18.420]  they're going to go after your children so so what they need to do what trump
[02:27:18.420 --> 02:27:21.700]  needs to do is i've always been critical so when people call me an
[02:27:21.700 --> 02:27:26.100]  apologies for trump i go wow you've never watched my videos i've always said
[02:27:26.100 --> 02:27:29.860]  that trump has never tweeted about how if you wear red hat public and you get a
[02:27:29.860 --> 02:27:34.420]  brick down in your face doesn't care but alex balvin makes fun of him or and
[02:27:34.420 --> 02:27:37.700]  that's trump's biggest failing and i forgot to tell him that
[02:27:37.700 --> 02:27:40.980]  that the fact that he doesn't make a big deal how he always goes we're tough
[02:27:40.980 --> 02:27:43.700]  we're great we're winning he doesn't want to act like
[02:27:43.700 --> 02:27:46.900]  his people are under attack but the people want him to come out and say
[02:27:46.900 --> 02:27:49.700]  god bless people that have stood up against this crap
[02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:52.660]  and this intimidation he could open the discussion with giving the names of
[02:27:52.660 --> 02:27:55.140]  ice putting dead animals on their property saying
[02:27:55.140 --> 02:27:58.660]  attack their children and expand that out to america and say
[02:27:58.660 --> 02:28:01.940]  god bless you i appreciate your courage he always just says you're smart
[02:28:01.940 --> 02:28:06.180]  you're smart you know what i'm doing yeah and then he tweets about jimmy

[02:33:27.780 --> 02:33:31.140]  all right mike sternovich is always pissing the global stuff phil marvitt
[02:33:31.140 --> 02:33:34.820]  just joined us said he hopes that his head is cut off putting it out of him
[02:33:34.820 --> 02:33:38.740]  the children eat his his face and then he commits suicide
[02:33:38.740 --> 02:33:43.540]  because bill mar called for a depression he's an economic collapse
[02:33:43.540 --> 02:33:47.300]  that's not a recession and tens of thousands commit suicide during that
[02:33:47.300 --> 02:33:51.540]  society was tweeted it and then he said i hope you die
[02:33:51.540 --> 02:33:54.740]  we're going to go to susan pie who is a lawyer
[02:33:54.740 --> 02:33:58.820]  who's nonpartisan and who's even been criticized coming on the show there
[02:33:58.820 --> 02:34:01.940]  she was coming on the thought police thought about what's really happening
[02:34:01.940 --> 02:34:04.900]  with kids with the border and what's having trump will talk to him
[02:34:04.900 --> 02:34:09.060]  or talk to her just a moment uh she's at strong visa dot com
[02:34:09.060 --> 02:34:15.300]  but finishing up with uh mike sternovich mike a lot of stuff on the radar you
[02:34:15.300 --> 02:34:17.620]  got your big film hoax coming out i've talked to people that are involved in
[02:34:17.620 --> 02:34:21.620]  film they say it's amazing the crew that the other people so i look forward to
[02:34:21.620 --> 02:34:24.900]  that being a vehicle just a free speech when you and i go on tour together
[02:34:24.900 --> 02:34:28.180]  so we can kind of announce that's coming up here and freak out the media
[02:34:28.180 --> 02:34:33.140]  uh but looking at this just other little tidbits of what you see
[02:34:33.140 --> 02:34:36.820]  of i see this summer and them trying to cause civil unrest
[02:34:36.820 --> 02:34:40.260]  i see going in with with with mewler saying he's accelerating his
[02:34:40.260 --> 02:34:42.900]  investigation because now they know the blue wave is a red wave
[02:34:42.900 --> 02:34:46.580]  i mean i see real panic setting in his david lynch at khanye west and
[02:34:46.580 --> 02:34:49.300]  everybody comes out and says trump to be the greatest president in history
[02:34:49.300 --> 02:34:51.940]  with all the peace deals everything else the economy coming back
[02:34:51.940 --> 02:34:55.540]  but let's not be too confident as the wolf says in poll fiction
[02:34:55.540 --> 02:34:59.620]  you know let's not start celebrating yet uh what else is going on and and
[02:34:59.620 --> 02:35:03.140]  what are the little nuggets you've got from inside the administration do you
[02:35:03.140 --> 02:35:07.060]  know what malania trump's shirt meant or jacket
[02:35:07.060 --> 02:35:10.900]  oh well what i tell people is it is going to get worse and by that mean by
[02:35:10.900 --> 02:35:14.500]  that i mean if you're a conservative or libertarian
[02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:18.180]  and you don't realize that it's gonna get way worse
[02:35:18.180 --> 02:35:21.540]  they're gonna start going through vote what they're gonna do next the left
[02:35:21.540 --> 02:35:26.740]  i've they're they're going to go through voter uh donations and start doxing
[02:35:26.740 --> 02:35:30.100]  people going after every regular person
[02:35:30.100 --> 02:35:34.980]  it's all right my friend it's like i got somebody here gotta go
[02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:38.580]  so that's the next thing that's coming is just a total harassment of
[02:35:38.580 --> 02:35:43.140]  individuals exactly all right mike we'll talk to
[02:35:43.140 --> 02:35:46.340]  you soon when is uh when is the film hoax coming out
[02:35:46.340 --> 02:35:50.660]  we're gonna do uh fall premiere hoaxmovie.com for more details all right
[02:35:50.660 --> 02:35:55.540]  that's great thank you so much dot com thank you uh uh you want to comment on
[02:35:55.540 --> 02:35:58.260]  just just the the moment of history we're in amazing
[02:35:58.260 --> 02:36:01.380]  Lucas the moment of history we're in here
[02:36:01.380 --> 02:36:06.180]  where where most people i know that just want the economy back and like america
[02:36:06.180 --> 02:36:09.860]  aren't even conservatives i mean yeah i was arrested by George Bush twice for
[02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:12.740]  asking questions i mean i i was against those wars
[02:36:12.740 --> 02:36:18.020]  but the left of today is like crazed rabid robots yeah and i think that's
[02:36:18.020 --> 02:36:21.540]  that's the beauty of it because you honestly at this point in time you
[02:36:21.540 --> 02:36:24.500]  don't have to have any you know knowledge of history or the
[02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:28.740]  political affiliation it just boils down to common sense
[02:36:28.740 --> 02:36:32.020]  like when it comes to immigration like common sense
[02:36:32.020 --> 02:36:35.220]  when it boils down to there being two genders
[02:36:35.220 --> 02:36:40.100]  common sense and i think that's where they're losing a lot of their base
[02:36:40.100 --> 02:36:42.980]  because they're just like yo you guys have gone so far left
[02:36:42.980 --> 02:36:46.660]  that i can't even i can't even coastline on that and there's a total war on
[02:36:46.660 --> 02:36:49.620]  reality like it's your reality it's one thing to say
[02:36:49.620 --> 02:36:53.460]  there's 50 genders fine say there's a thousand but then don't try to ban
[02:36:53.460 --> 02:36:55.940]  mother and father off government forms because they're hurtful
[02:36:55.940 --> 02:37:00.260]  yeah it's it's this idea of your truth it's moral relativism
[02:37:00.260 --> 02:37:04.660]  which is absolutely cancer i mean it is and then when you look at it and when
[02:37:04.660 --> 02:37:08.500]  you confront them on these ideas these well
[02:37:08.500 --> 02:37:11.940]  because they can't they can't defend them they're indefensible that's why
[02:37:11.940 --> 02:37:15.700]  absolutely keep riding shotgun with us we're gonna go to uh our guest here in
[02:37:15.700 --> 02:37:18.180]  a moment just first i was i didn't even plug last hour
[02:37:18.180 --> 02:37:21.940]  despite the fact that summer is always the doldrum for funding
[02:37:21.940 --> 02:37:24.580]  even though the audience is record large even for the summer people are
[02:37:24.580 --> 02:37:27.460]  awake and involved while it's happening we're not selling a lot of products in
[02:37:27.460 --> 02:37:31.220]  inforworksstore.com that makes gord soros the global is very very happy
[02:37:31.220 --> 02:37:34.420]  and a lot of it's because i'm not cutting ads i'm not plugging i'm so obsessed
[02:37:34.420 --> 02:37:38.020]  with the news and info but we're not funded by soros we're not funded by
[02:37:38.020 --> 02:37:41.780]  taxpayer money like msnbc was with a banker bellot money in stimulus
[02:37:41.780 --> 02:37:44.980]  package we're funded by you and i came out my dad's a
[02:37:44.980 --> 02:37:48.180]  dentist and old surgeon from the top place in the country that wants to say
[02:37:48.180 --> 02:37:50.420]  their name is they get threatened in a rash the top
[02:37:50.420 --> 02:37:54.100]  organic fluoride free toothpaste maker makes our stuff but they put 50 cents in
[02:37:54.100 --> 02:37:58.020]  each tube we put three dollars a product in it
[02:37:58.020 --> 02:38:02.260]  okay yes that's what i'm talking about and it's got the colloidal silver it's got
[02:38:02.260 --> 02:38:06.260]  the iodide it's got all the real concentrated oils the peppermint you name
[02:38:06.260 --> 02:38:09.700]  it that's why it's so concentrated even an adult might want to water down the
[02:38:09.700 --> 02:38:13.060]  super blue for adults the children's doesn't have uh you know the really strong
[02:38:13.060 --> 02:38:16.100]  tea tree and stuff in it peppermint because it will burn their mouths and
[02:38:16.100 --> 02:38:19.460]  we've got all of it 50 off one of the record sales on that
[02:38:19.460 --> 02:38:23.380]  we've got immune gargle is my dad's name for it because that's a term
[02:38:23.380 --> 02:38:26.900]  but what you do is you brush your teeth you gargle with it you spit it out and
[02:38:26.900 --> 02:38:31.380]  then yes it's a supplement under the fda and all of it you can even
[02:38:31.380 --> 02:38:35.140]  swallow some of it people the way gargle you spit out it's my dad's name
[02:38:35.140 --> 02:38:38.820]  he named it super blue too because the toothpaste turns blue first it's white
[02:38:38.820 --> 02:38:42.020]  that turns blue because it's got real iodide in it that actually turns blue not
[02:38:42.020 --> 02:38:45.300]  red okay so the point is it's amazing and even though
[02:38:45.300 --> 02:38:48.820]  immune gargle the combo doesn't have reviews it's brand new
[02:38:48.820 --> 02:38:51.460]  even though immune gargle is one of our best sellers a lot of folks who are on
[02:38:51.460 --> 02:38:55.380]  the fence that don't try it so whether it's 16 ounces or the 10 ounce the one
[02:38:55.380 --> 02:38:59.940]  ounce or the all of it it's all 50 off or get it all together
[02:38:59.940 --> 02:39:04.100]  at info warslife.com or info wars store.com or triple a 253
[02:39:04.100 --> 02:39:09.780]  3139 now joining us is susan pie and uh this is the first
[02:39:09.780 --> 02:39:13.620]  generation u.s citizen daughter of north korean refugee
[02:39:13.620 --> 02:39:17.220]  she worked in dc with former u.s ambassador to the un former head of the
[02:39:17.220 --> 02:39:20.500]  gsa former assistant director of operations cia
[02:39:20.500 --> 02:39:24.980]  former commissioner of the u.s customs attorney pie is admitted to the
[02:39:24.980 --> 02:39:29.140]  washington bar and practices only federal law so she's a hot shot lawyer
[02:39:29.140 --> 02:39:32.500]  and from her office in florida and she's also a good-looking lady there i
[02:39:32.500 --> 02:39:35.700]  guess it's politically correct i can't say it she's i just did it she also
[02:39:35.700 --> 02:39:39.460]  submitted testimony to the house history committee on humanitarian immigration
[02:39:39.460 --> 02:39:44.420]  in senate judiciary committee members on business immigration fraud and abuse
[02:39:44.420 --> 02:39:48.180]  as an immigration and and a nationality attorney miss pie may appear in all that
[02:39:48.180 --> 02:39:51.860]  he says the u.s and it's strong visa.com and and she's not a liberal she's not
[02:39:51.860 --> 02:39:54.820]  a conservative let her define herself but i've told she's been told don't come
[02:39:54.820 --> 02:39:58.180]  even come on here and and she's just trying to say for as a
[02:39:58.180 --> 02:40:02.100]  lawyer and an expert what's really going on and what's really
[02:40:02.100 --> 02:40:04.100]  happening we know it's a hoax with the little girl
[02:40:04.100 --> 02:40:07.620]  wasn't taken from her parents we now know this is a pr stunt but
[02:40:07.620 --> 02:40:11.860]  she's somebody that's just willing to come in and just state the facts and so
[02:40:11.860 --> 02:40:15.700]  telling the truth in a world of universal deceit is a revolutionary act
[02:40:15.700 --> 02:40:20.580]  so thin and the amazing lucas is riding shotgun thanks for coming on with us
[02:40:20.580 --> 02:40:25.460]  hi thank you alex wow that's a whole cool interesting story about your parents
[02:40:25.460 --> 02:40:28.980]  fleeing north korea i mean we've got to have you on about that separately but
[02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:31.620]  just we've got a few minutes to break we'll come back and get into the details
[02:40:31.620 --> 02:40:34.820]  but in a nutshell you're out there on twitter saying
[02:40:34.820 --> 02:40:38.260]  what we're hearing about trump is it true just as an immigration lawyer
[02:40:38.260 --> 02:40:41.940]  who's non-partisan who's worked i know with both parties what is going on
[02:40:41.940 --> 02:40:45.300]  crystallizing what is really happening
[02:40:45.860 --> 02:40:50.100]  well i think that the democrats or liberals are
[02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:53.620]  they're they're very apt to just sort of dismiss
[02:40:53.620 --> 02:40:58.900]  trump and miller and kelly and neilson and that's a really grave error because
[02:40:58.900 --> 02:41:03.380]  he has been methodically executing his immigration plan
[02:41:03.380 --> 02:41:06.260]  with regards to legal and illegal immigration
[02:41:06.260 --> 02:41:11.300]  i mean basically since seven days into his administration
[02:41:11.300 --> 02:41:14.820]  and i think that the supreme court opinion this morning
[02:41:14.820 --> 02:41:20.980]  on the travel ban reinstituting it indicates a real tectonic level shift
[02:41:20.980 --> 02:41:26.420]  in everything and people would do well to not so easily dismiss him or for
[02:41:26.420 --> 02:41:31.540]  example for people like me to tell me you know i don't even know what they're
[02:41:31.540 --> 02:41:35.060]  thinking to tell me that i'm not allowed to come on your show
[02:41:35.060 --> 02:41:40.740]  or any show for that matter so well that's really it and
[02:41:40.740 --> 02:41:44.180]  if anything trump's trying to make the borders more open for people that aren't
[02:41:44.180 --> 02:41:47.540]  criminals or bad which has got some right wingers mad at him and some of the
[02:41:47.540 --> 02:41:51.620]  actual racist groups that we've been watching and so you're saying
[02:41:51.620 --> 02:41:54.340]  as a you know the senior top immigration lawyers is that's
[02:41:54.340 --> 02:41:56.980]  accurate or can you expand on that because
[02:41:56.980 --> 02:42:00.340]  trumps all about process and it being transparent and working right i mean
[02:42:00.340 --> 02:42:03.140]  as an immigration lawyer what are you seeing him do when you say he's
[02:42:03.140 --> 02:42:06.580]  methodically implementing it's it's all right there
[02:42:06.580 --> 02:42:10.820]  yeah it's it's it's just a law and and rulemaking
[02:42:10.820 --> 02:42:16.100]  setting up cases setting up you know a lots of litigation which you know as
[02:42:16.100 --> 02:42:20.580]  you know it's kind of trumps or k but i think people really underestimate
[02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:24.420]  especially steven miller and his role in you know not only having trumps
[02:42:24.420 --> 02:42:28.420]  here but also in articulating these sort of long range
[02:42:28.420 --> 02:42:33.300]  plans on immigration and it and i i really don't understand what is going
[02:42:33.300 --> 02:42:36.260]  on with democrats or people like maxine waters
[02:42:36.260 --> 02:42:40.660]  they're not spending any time it seems like you know reading what is going on
[02:42:40.660 --> 02:42:43.700]  and steven miller by the way he's not an immigration lawyer but
[02:42:43.700 --> 02:42:47.060]  by no means should he be underestimated i've worked with him
[02:42:47.060 --> 02:42:49.860]  uh what let's hear about that let's hear about steven miller when we come back
[02:42:49.860 --> 02:42:54.420]  they're now harassing him in his house they'll be right back
[02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:58.340]  alex jones here with an extremely

[02:46:57.060 --> 02:47:04.340]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:27.540 --> 02:47:30.340]  oh
[02:47:39.140 --> 02:47:45.780]  susan pie is a leading immigration lawyer and she's talking about mr miller
[02:47:45.780 --> 02:47:49.780]  who's one of the architects of trumps plan and i've looked at trumps plan
[02:47:49.780 --> 02:47:53.140]  i've looked at what he's introduced to congress uh it actually opens america
[02:47:53.140 --> 02:47:56.180]  up for people that aren't criminals and people that go through the system the
[02:47:56.180 --> 02:47:58.900]  democrats and republicans have made a very long arduous system
[02:47:58.900 --> 02:48:02.740]  he's trying to make it more streamlined but no more hidden groups of people no
[02:48:02.740 --> 02:48:06.660]  more 20 million illegals that are you know off the radar the
[02:48:06.660 --> 02:48:10.180]  democrats use them to launder money and you know i mean to me it looks like
[02:48:10.180 --> 02:48:15.620]  trump is really pragmatically uh trying to fix it having a pro
[02:48:15.620 --> 02:48:19.540]  immigrant stance but that's me reading what he's pushing what he said
[02:48:19.540 --> 02:48:25.540]  uh susan what are you saying he's doing versus what we see in the news
[02:48:25.540 --> 02:48:29.380]  i mean honestly i wouldn't call it a pro immigrant
[02:48:29.380 --> 02:48:34.100]  but i will say that uh you know steven miller is a young man he's got the
[02:48:34.100 --> 02:48:37.780]  ear of the president you know his his young age really
[02:48:37.780 --> 02:48:41.940]  belies the the vast depth of knowledge even
[02:48:41.940 --> 02:48:46.020]  including legacy knowledge about immigration uh that he has you know he
[02:48:46.020 --> 02:48:50.340]  did all of uh senator sessions heavy it was a chief advisor well let me stop
[02:48:50.340 --> 02:48:53.300]  you there then i mean you're sounding like you're saying that's a different
[02:48:53.300 --> 02:48:56.900]  plan than what they're saying and that you somewhat agree with it or you don't
[02:48:56.900 --> 02:49:00.020]  for me i'm when i say pro immigrant i mean legal immigrant
[02:49:00.020 --> 02:49:03.620]  streamlining it for good people i mean it's better for good people
[02:49:03.620 --> 02:49:07.380]  or or or give me your view of what trumps proposing then
[02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:12.580]  and then get back into miller yeah i mean you know i i'm not going to
[02:49:12.580 --> 02:49:16.340]  hazard a guess about like what is in trumps mind or anybody else in his
[02:49:16.340 --> 02:49:19.780]  administration i i can tell you you know that that they
[02:49:19.780 --> 02:49:25.140]  are method methodically closing a lot of loopholes that have existed now
[02:49:25.140 --> 02:49:29.780]  just because people on the left uh don't want to
[02:49:29.780 --> 02:49:33.140]  admit that there's you know asylum fraud or
[02:49:33.140 --> 02:49:36.900]  or that united but the fact is is that the united states is the number one
[02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:40.100]  destination for asylum seekers as of right now overtaking
[02:49:40.100 --> 02:49:45.060]  germany 330 thousand asylum seekers in 2017 alone
[02:49:45.060 --> 02:49:48.580]  and you know everybody who goes to immigration court we know
[02:49:48.580 --> 02:49:52.500]  that there are many you know a fraudulent asylum claim said
[02:49:52.500 --> 02:49:56.740]  some unwitting some some malicious you know a lot of people on the left are
[02:49:56.740 --> 02:49:59.780]  saying well you know people are just coming here to get a better life yeah
[02:49:59.780 --> 02:50:04.500]  that's true okay but that's not within the definition of a valid asylum claim
[02:50:04.500 --> 02:50:07.700]  and asylum was never meant to be a blank check
[02:50:07.700 --> 02:50:12.420]  so i think in in that way yes i i'm acutely aware that steven miller knows
[02:50:12.420 --> 02:50:16.580]  where all the loopholes and you know where the fraud and the uses
[02:50:16.580 --> 02:50:20.740]  not just in illegal immigration but also in legal immigration programs like
[02:50:20.740 --> 02:50:23.700]  i mean what the democrats do i mean they just say
[02:50:23.700 --> 02:50:27.060]  get rid of everything and have no border i mean when like
[02:50:27.060 --> 02:50:30.980]  mexico's a war zone exactly what they try to do with
[02:50:30.980 --> 02:50:35.140]  with the wind sign the bill they're trying to get passed
[02:50:35.140 --> 02:50:38.340]  so let me ask you this is a as an immigration lawyer
[02:50:38.340 --> 02:50:40.900]  who i know is draw the ire of the left and i don't even hear what you're
[02:50:40.900 --> 02:50:45.060]  saying that would upset them what is not accurate about what the media is
[02:50:45.060 --> 02:50:49.700]  saying of that that trumps doing okay so there there's like a big story that
[02:50:49.700 --> 02:50:55.540]  just blew up about a guatemalan mother who lost custody of her her child to
[02:50:55.540 --> 02:51:00.900]  american born adoptive parents who are white okay but and that's how it was
[02:51:00.900 --> 02:51:04.660]  presented in in the media but you know that's not really
[02:51:04.660 --> 02:51:08.500]  all there is to that story so just taking that as like an example
[02:51:08.500 --> 02:51:13.140]  you know that woman came here when she was pregnant in 2006
[02:51:13.140 --> 02:51:16.980]  she left two children behind in Guatemala and she's been apart from them
[02:51:16.980 --> 02:51:21.460]  now for 12 years she gave birth to a child in the united states she would
[02:51:21.460 --> 02:51:25.300]  she was busted during the bush obama bush administration working
[02:51:25.300 --> 02:51:28.900]  uh as an undocumented worker in a chicken processing plant
[02:51:28.900 --> 02:51:32.580]  and then a few months later she she pled guilty to
[02:51:32.580 --> 02:51:36.820]  aggravated identity theft and she caught a two-year felony sentence
[02:51:36.820 --> 02:51:40.020]  so and so but the evil white people are taking care of her baby now so they're
[02:51:40.020 --> 02:51:46.180]  bad well i mean the adoptive parents uh from what i read
[02:51:46.180 --> 02:51:50.660]  hired a lawyer for her and then she had no contact with the child
[02:51:50.660 --> 02:51:54.500]  for either one or two years and even though she had
[02:51:54.500 --> 02:51:58.660]  has sisters here in the united states so you know she's been here for 12 years
[02:51:58.660 --> 02:52:01.780]  fighting this case and the department of homeland security has allowed her to
[02:52:01.780 --> 02:52:05.140]  stay here in the united states uh to fight that but meanwhile back in
[02:52:05.140 --> 02:52:08.260]  Guatemala you know she's got two children who have grown up without a
[02:52:08.260 --> 02:52:12.740]  mother so you know it's it's not it's not usually black and white you know
[02:52:12.740 --> 02:52:16.100]  there's there's a lot of stuff that's going on and like this morning you know
[02:52:16.100 --> 02:52:19.780]  the supreme court has just reinstituted the travel ban
[02:52:19.780 --> 02:52:24.180]  not under national security but but under much much
[02:52:24.180 --> 02:52:27.940]  broader statutes and that but i mean you're a lawyer but isn't trump just
[02:52:27.940 --> 02:52:30.740]  following the law the president has the power to do that any country he wants
[02:52:30.740 --> 02:52:33.700]  right i mean he's exercising his presidential
[02:52:33.700 --> 02:52:38.100]  discretion is is what the supreme court says but then the supreme court
[02:52:38.100 --> 02:52:42.420]  went beyond that and said that not only does he have the discretion to exclude
[02:52:42.420 --> 02:52:46.660]  all you know aliens from entry entering the united states
[02:52:46.660 --> 02:52:51.300]  but they even went further to talk about uh 1182 section
[02:52:51.300 --> 02:52:56.180]  i think it's a yeah so if you come to the united thing that that's the thing
[02:52:56.180 --> 02:52:59.380]  the press secretary said she said listen we can't just do whatever we want we
[02:52:59.380 --> 02:53:02.900]  follow the law we can't just do like obama and it's true isn't
[02:53:02.900 --> 02:53:06.580]  from from what i watch trump is very neurotic about following law
[02:53:06.580 --> 02:53:09.540]  that's why he's always saying change it change it
[02:53:09.540 --> 02:53:13.060]  i don't in my opinion i i don't think trump is i think
[02:53:13.060 --> 02:53:16.980]  steven miller is i think secretary neilson you know any female who's in
[02:53:16.980 --> 02:53:20.020]  law enforcement will tell you that you know no woman gets to that kind of a
[02:53:20.020 --> 02:53:22.660]  position in the federal government you know without
[02:53:22.660 --> 02:53:25.860]  being pretty tough as nails and knowing what they're doing
[02:53:25.860 --> 02:53:28.900]  you know so uh and then there's general kelly
[02:53:28.900 --> 02:53:35.380]  you know so i mean they i will say that i i am acutely aware that they know
[02:53:35.380 --> 02:53:39.540]  where all of the weaknesses are in the current immigration
[02:53:39.540 --> 02:53:42.260]  i think it's worth saying they're just looking out for the country like we're
[02:53:42.260 --> 02:53:44.660]  a country i mean because the un wants europe is just
[02:53:44.660 --> 02:53:48.260]  completely open to north africa and in the middle east i mean it's
[02:53:48.260 --> 02:53:50.900]  insane we have to stabilize those countries they are
[02:53:50.900 --> 02:53:54.340]  doubling their population they are collapsing how does
[02:53:54.340 --> 02:53:58.180]  how does bringing in hundreds of millions of people who then the liberals
[02:53:58.180 --> 02:54:02.260]  put on welfare to not be self-sufficient help things it will sink us
[02:54:02.260 --> 02:54:07.380]  why do they want to sink us okay so like i said you know asylum was
[02:54:07.380 --> 02:54:09.700]  never meant to be a blank check i mean certainly
[02:54:09.700 --> 02:54:14.260]  that the underlying core issue that like nobody is talking about that i don't
[02:54:14.260 --> 02:54:17.460]  understand is a global migration crisis that has
[02:54:17.460 --> 02:54:21.780]  displaced so i think it's 68 million people and after
[02:54:21.780 --> 02:54:25.380]  world war two there were 15 million people
[02:54:25.380 --> 02:54:29.300]  displaced so this is an issue that can't be
[02:54:29.300 --> 02:54:33.540]  it's not unique to the united states it's it's an international crisis that
[02:54:33.540 --> 02:54:37.140]  requires much more than just you know short-term
[02:54:37.140 --> 02:54:41.620]  policy making or short-term reactions on the part of this just the united states
[02:54:41.620 --> 02:54:44.260]  but as far as like loopholes within the system
[02:54:44.260 --> 02:54:48.980]  you know i i think people like my my colleagues think that if we don't talk
[02:54:48.980 --> 02:54:51.860]  about what the loopholes are that people won't know well
[02:54:51.860 --> 02:54:54.740]  it's i mean that ship has sailed you know and after this morning with the
[02:54:54.740 --> 02:54:57.940]  supreme court decision reinstituting muslim ban and then even going
[02:54:57.940 --> 02:55:01.460]  further than that uh and saying that you know people have to prove
[02:55:01.460 --> 02:55:06.820]  like affirmatively prove over 60 bases of potential inadmissibility to even be
[02:55:06.820 --> 02:55:10.420]  legally entered to the united states with a legal visa
[02:55:10.420 --> 02:55:14.260]  i mean people have to understand my colleagues have to understand that
[02:55:14.260 --> 02:55:17.700]  there's no hiding anything anymore whether it's
[02:55:17.700 --> 02:55:21.060]  policy deficiencies in policy deficiencies in the law
[02:55:21.060 --> 02:55:25.460]  fraud and abuse or you know anything like that i mean those are
[02:55:25.460 --> 02:55:28.820]  those are all on their radar and they have all been addressed going all the
[02:55:28.820 --> 02:55:30.820]  way back to the first week that trump took
[02:55:30.820 --> 02:55:34.660]  office so when people say to me you know you can't talk on alice jones i mean
[02:55:34.660 --> 02:55:37.860]  i don't i don't understand what they're saying they're saying i people have a
[02:55:37.860 --> 02:55:42.420]  very visceral reaction to you well i tell you
[02:55:42.420 --> 02:55:45.620]  it is all i know is tom arnold said that
[02:55:45.620 --> 02:55:48.100]  he met with trump's lawyer and he was going to spill the beans and in a minute
[02:55:48.100 --> 02:55:49.700]  it was a total hoax he just lied to everybody
[02:55:49.700 --> 02:55:52.660]  hello i'm an entertainer it's funny but they know he's a liar and then all this
[02:55:52.660 --> 02:55:54.500]  little girl was separated from her parents and
[02:55:54.500 --> 02:55:58.740]  we learned that cnn and others knew day one that they went to a family center
[02:55:58.740 --> 02:56:02.980]  and so i know what goes on in mexico in some areas
[02:56:02.980 --> 02:56:06.580]  some areas are nice some areas are bad it's it's road warrior death in northern
[02:56:06.580 --> 02:56:09.460]  mexico on the texas border and then and then i get to
[02:56:09.460 --> 02:56:12.820]  hear about how i'm a nazi because i want to control the border
[02:56:12.820 --> 02:56:15.940]  and it's just none of these leftists would understand that we'd have no
[02:56:15.940 --> 02:56:19.300]  civilization if we allowed latin america collapse into the
[02:56:19.300 --> 02:56:22.900]  us so i'm concerned you've got third world
[02:56:22.900 --> 02:56:26.020]  populations that have doubled they're set to get even bigger
[02:56:26.020 --> 02:56:28.740]  these countries are mismanaged or falling apart run by communists and
[02:56:28.740 --> 02:56:31.220]  socialists and you know you were able to flee from
[02:56:31.220 --> 02:56:34.020]  north korea boy i think your asylum was a hundred percent clear for your parents
[02:56:34.020 --> 02:56:37.060]  god any north koreans can get out come on over
[02:56:37.060 --> 02:56:40.900]  uh but because they're fleeing it they're not like fleeing
[02:56:40.900 --> 02:56:45.140]  socialism or communism trying to come here and set it up it's like californians

[02:57:02.580 --> 02:57:07.060]  we would do well to correctly educate people and tell them that yes

[02:57:10.420 --> 02:57:14.660]  inclination of all parents but that doesn't necessarily mean that you know

[03:00:01.540 --> 03:00:04.980]  this message is transmitted at the request with the president of the united
[03:00:04.980 --> 03:00:08.340]  states of america and the office of homeland security
[03:00:08.340 --> 03:00:11.540]  in compliance with the united nations the president of the united
[03:00:11.540 --> 03:00:14.980]  all right ladies and gentlemen uh susan
[03:00:14.980 --> 03:00:18.500]  pie is our guest he's in uh leading well-known immigration lawyers was
[03:00:18.500 --> 03:00:20.580]  getting into what's really happening what trump's doing versus what we're
[03:00:20.580 --> 03:00:23.780]  hearing and you were talking about how do these immigration lawyers take
[03:00:23.780 --> 03:00:27.140]  hundreds of cases versus you saying you only take two i mean
[03:00:27.140 --> 03:00:31.300]  what makes you take one i mean i would imagine somebody fleeing iran who's got
[03:00:31.300 --> 03:00:34.100]  proof they're political dissident somebody's trying to go north korea
[03:00:34.100 --> 03:00:37.620]  obviously there's gonna be a question uh at least in my view or somebody trying
[03:00:37.620 --> 03:00:41.940]  to get out of who's a christian and sudan whose parents were killed i mean
[03:00:41.940 --> 03:00:46.500]  i mean isn't aren't there a lot of real people need to get get into america
[03:00:46.500 --> 03:00:50.180]  yeah so i i have a case and my client's giving me permission to speak about it
[03:00:50.180 --> 03:00:53.700]  to the public but um
[03:00:53.700 --> 03:00:59.620]  you know she was tortured for two decades and when i say tortured i mean
[03:00:59.620 --> 03:01:04.340]  teeth were knocked out of her mouth her eardrum was perforated
[03:01:04.340 --> 03:01:08.180]  her bones were broken she has scars all over her body
[03:01:08.180 --> 03:01:12.340]  her hand was put in an open flame and she was
[03:01:12.340 --> 03:01:18.660]  she was tortured by an actual nazi member of her country's government
[03:01:18.660 --> 03:01:23.540]  okay that's a real asylum thing she she has to grieve
[03:01:23.540 --> 03:01:26.740]  for her son who she left behind and she has to
[03:01:26.740 --> 03:01:30.340]  think of him as dead because she cannot turn
[03:01:30.340 --> 03:01:36.180]  him away from you know her abuser who was her husband in her country but who is
[03:01:36.180 --> 03:01:39.300]  ironically in charge of asylum cases in her country now
[03:01:39.300 --> 03:01:44.580]  that's really different than um some of my colleagues who
[03:01:44.580 --> 03:01:48.900]  who you know we're lawyers so all there is for us is the law and the facts
[03:01:48.900 --> 03:01:52.980]  it's it's not like our our political opinion so whether or not we think
[03:01:52.980 --> 03:01:56.740]  somebody deserves you know a chance in a better country
[03:01:56.740 --> 03:02:00.020]  i mean i can see that of the vast majority of people you know who don't
[03:02:00.020 --> 03:02:03.620]  are not fortunate enough to live in the united states but that doesn't mean that
[03:02:03.620 --> 03:02:08.020]  i as a lawyer am allowed to file those cases just to get my client work
[03:02:08.020 --> 03:02:11.700]  authorization six months after we file because i know that the case is going
[03:02:11.700 --> 03:02:14.580]  to go on for three four five six eight years
[03:02:14.580 --> 03:02:18.020]  i was about to say though and then a lot of cases don't you even get government
[03:02:18.020 --> 03:02:20.740]  funding for the appeal
[03:02:20.740 --> 03:02:24.580]  i mean all all federal public defenders can
[03:02:24.580 --> 03:02:28.420]  sit on a panel and and get compensated by sure so so these people
[03:02:28.420 --> 03:02:31.540]  take on all these cases and they're sitting there doing it and then if you
[03:02:31.540 --> 03:02:35.220]  expand on that you start thinking about it
[03:02:35.220 --> 03:02:38.340]  yeah i i have a problem like with you know
[03:02:38.340 --> 03:02:41.780]  whether you're an extremist on the right or the left i mean it really doesn't
[03:02:41.780 --> 03:02:45.700]  matter you know you're an extremist so you know there are extremists on the
[03:02:45.700 --> 03:02:49.220]  left who are who are very i mean they just don't
[03:02:49.220 --> 03:02:52.660]  recognize just because you don't recognize america's borders
[03:02:52.660 --> 03:02:56.100]  doesn't mean that borders don't exist okay borders exist
[03:02:56.100 --> 03:03:00.500]  and i mean genders don't exist i mean i think the amazing lucas is a man
[03:03:00.500 --> 03:03:05.140]  i think the amazing susan pie is a woman and it doesn't hurt anybody else out
[03:03:05.140 --> 03:03:09.540]  there that they identify as a potted plant the fact is mammals are males and
[03:03:09.540 --> 03:03:12.900]  females and you know we have borders and we're a country and there's
[03:03:12.900 --> 03:03:16.740]  six billion people that want to come here and you know uh it's like ellis they
[03:03:16.740 --> 03:03:20.820]  go ellis silan take our poor ellis silan put your ass in solitary confinement for
[03:03:20.820 --> 03:03:24.180]  six months they thought you were sick you know the quarantine
[03:03:24.180 --> 03:03:26.660]  and and so i've been we're talking to the border patrol how they're bringing people
[03:03:26.660 --> 03:03:29.540]  in with diseases you name it and now these diseases that weren't even in the
[03:03:29.540 --> 03:03:33.460]  u.s like leprosy are back it's incredible
[03:03:33.460 --> 03:03:38.740]  well you know i don't i i know for a fact because i've been following some of
[03:03:38.740 --> 03:03:43.860]  the uh real extremist elements of open borders
[03:03:43.860 --> 03:03:47.700]  movement for many many years and i know for a factor they've come right out and
[03:03:47.700 --> 03:03:52.020]  said that we hey we use bodies uh to push our political
[03:03:52.020 --> 03:03:56.260]  agenda and when they say we use bodies that means they're purposefully
[03:03:56.260 --> 03:04:02.660]  using uh women children you know uh families and i don't know that the
[03:04:02.660 --> 03:04:06.580]  people who are organizing things like the migrant caravan i don't know that
[03:04:06.580 --> 03:04:10.500]  they are um if they're not misleading the people who
[03:04:10.500 --> 03:04:14.260]  are a lot of useful idiots sign on because they want to go in virtue signal

[03:04:29.860 --> 03:04:34.420]  that but there is just so much
[03:04:34.420 --> 03:04:37.540]  that we've got to go over but man the supreme court i haven't even gotten into
[03:04:37.540 --> 03:04:42.020]  that properly i've slapped down of them is just epic
[03:04:42.020 --> 03:04:46.100]  because the law is crystal clear and so all these are little subjudges they
[03:04:46.100 --> 03:04:48.340]  ignored it but why did the supreme court actually
[03:04:48.340 --> 03:04:52.580]  follow the clear cut law bless that question straight ahead and we have

[03:06:07.860 --> 03:06:32.820]  john show
[03:06:38.740 --> 03:06:46.100]  well there he is ladies and gentlemen
[03:06:46.100 --> 03:06:50.180]  we've got the amazing lucas we've got the elusive
[03:06:50.180 --> 03:06:56.420]  Watson there he is the waddle wart hey Watson you've got a lot coming up this
[03:06:56.420 --> 03:07:02.020]  hour a lot of craziness going on but um i was asking some folks in the
[03:07:02.020 --> 03:07:04.180]  government you know kind of high level the other day
[03:07:04.180 --> 03:07:07.140]  what can i do and they said no no what do we do
[03:07:07.140 --> 03:07:09.780]  and i was like is that a pat on the head and they said no your track record
[03:07:09.780 --> 03:07:12.260]  everything you're doing what do you think and i said well
[03:07:12.260 --> 03:07:15.460]  they're getting ready for the civil war this is like last wednesday
[03:07:15.460 --> 03:07:18.420]  and uh they're getting ready to try to take down the whole country and they're
[03:07:18.420 --> 03:07:21.540]  going to cause race riots calling it republican versus democrats they're
[03:07:21.540 --> 03:07:24.660]  going to ratchet up violence and they're going to come out with all their
[03:07:24.660 --> 03:07:27.700]  fake russia gate stuff and try to 25th amendment
[03:07:27.700 --> 03:07:31.940]  and i i i just don't think we can sit here and just beat them with prosperity
[03:07:31.940 --> 03:07:35.060]  and truth at a certain point when people are saying they're going to overthrow
[03:07:35.060 --> 03:07:38.260]  the government i don't know what we do
[03:07:38.260 --> 03:07:41.940]  and so i i did an analysis the first 30 minutes where i
[03:07:41.940 --> 03:07:46.020]  kind of put my best thinking cap on of what we should do Watson but
[03:07:46.020 --> 03:07:49.620]  you've got the un and Reuters announcing that they're basically with the EU
[03:07:49.620 --> 03:07:52.980]  setting up an EU army to make people accept open borders they're going to
[03:07:52.980 --> 03:07:55.620]  use the crisis of tens of millions of invaders
[03:07:55.620 --> 03:07:58.340]  macron says 200 millions what he wants the next decade as you know
[03:07:58.340 --> 03:08:02.660]  to take over and have the un so it's simple they orchestrate the collapse of
[03:08:02.660 --> 03:08:05.540]  third world open up incentivize people coming into the
[03:08:05.540 --> 03:08:09.220]  countries with welfare and everything else bring them in in mass and then use
[03:08:09.220 --> 03:08:12.660]  them as a political detonator to control the populations this is
[03:08:12.660 --> 03:08:16.020]  21st century warfare world war four is here
[03:08:16.020 --> 03:08:20.100]  again cold war was world war three the cold war was world war three
[03:08:20.100 --> 03:08:24.340]  that's where we are and the president gets it and miller gets it and you get it
[03:08:24.340 --> 03:08:28.580]  we all get it and but at the same time now they're going into their full
[03:08:28.580 --> 03:08:32.180]  intimidation mode doxing patriots doxing federal
[03:08:32.180 --> 03:08:36.820]  agents they're moving and i'm not just going to sit here
[03:08:36.820 --> 03:08:40.340]  flat-footed it doesn't mean i'm launching some operation
[03:08:40.340 --> 03:08:45.940]  but we have been tasked with because we are recognized info wars as these
[03:08:45.940 --> 03:08:48.900]  guys and so i will tell you that high level
[03:08:48.900 --> 03:08:52.260]  folks want to know what everybody here thinks
[03:08:52.260 --> 03:08:58.180]  so paul what do you think well i mean i get the same thing from over here in
[03:08:58.180 --> 03:09:01.780]  the uk alex you'd be surprised some of the people who you think maybe
[03:09:01.780 --> 03:09:04.340]  used to be in the elite or have you know one
[03:09:04.340 --> 03:09:08.260]  tau in the elite you know dipped in the elite they're totally on our side now
[03:09:08.260 --> 03:09:11.540]  you got another example of that today conrad black
[03:09:11.540 --> 03:09:15.780]  this is a former steering committee member of the builder bird group
[03:09:15.780 --> 03:09:19.460]  doesn't get much more elitist than that he's come out and said that trumps
[03:09:19.460 --> 03:09:22.660]  basically engaged in a bloodless civil war
[03:09:22.660 --> 03:09:26.420]  against the establishment against the deep state you see the clip there
[03:09:26.420 --> 03:09:30.260]  and that he's basically winning this is someone who was in the upper echelons of
[03:09:30.260 --> 03:09:33.460]  the elite for decades and decades and as you just said
[03:09:33.460 --> 03:09:36.500]  you know i talked to people in this country who are coming from the same
[03:09:36.500 --> 03:09:41.060]  direction who were kind of you know tiptoeing on on the globalist hierarchy
[03:09:41.060 --> 03:09:44.260]  five ten fifteen years ago and now they're completely on board
[03:09:44.260 --> 03:09:47.780]  because we're winning and that's why they're all freaking out and panicking
[03:09:47.780 --> 03:09:51.380]  because they're still and i mean it's it's really getting boring alex
[03:09:51.380 --> 03:09:55.540]  when i have to make the same video was about the same subjects because they've
[03:09:55.540 --> 03:09:59.700]  gone back to the original rhetoric like with deniro a couple of weeks
[03:09:59.700 --> 03:10:03.380]  ago he said the same thing you know f trump and that's going to achieve
[03:10:03.380 --> 03:10:07.060]  anything in front of a sycophantic audience so let me ask you this and then
[03:10:07.060 --> 03:10:09.460]  i'm going to get out of here great amazing lucas is here but
[03:10:09.460 --> 03:10:12.260]  this is the point we've gotten to i'm not going to get into what's happened in
[03:10:12.260 --> 03:10:16.900]  the uk behind the scenes of the e you but we have the same approach by top
[03:10:16.900 --> 03:10:20.260]  people and they say we're ready for you and paul to
[03:10:20.260 --> 03:10:24.580]  lead operations and and these are famous people we're
[03:10:24.580 --> 03:10:27.700]  talking to we're like well wait we are leading operations
[03:10:27.700 --> 03:10:32.900]  and and then it's the same thing so so i'm just saying we we have to step into
[03:10:32.900 --> 03:10:37.060]  that and realize that all these beach heads we've
[03:10:37.060 --> 03:10:40.980]  got are just those and just like we don't realize we're in the catbird seat
[03:10:40.980 --> 03:10:45.140]  our listeners don't realize they are like captains or kernels in his fight
[03:10:45.140 --> 03:10:48.820]  everything we do now people are listening they get it they know it there's a
[03:10:48.820 --> 03:10:52.980]  sense of optimism but there's a vacuum in leadership
[03:10:52.980 --> 03:11:00.260]  in that so many people don't want to then say what we need to do
[03:11:00.260 --> 03:11:05.460]  or what needs to happen or what needs to unfold so paul what do you think
[03:11:05.460 --> 03:11:08.740]  i think we're doing pretty well as it is i mean why do you think they're panicking
[03:11:08.740 --> 03:11:12.020]  they weren't panicking before they had this blue wave rhetoric that was going
[03:11:12.020 --> 03:11:16.020]  on for months you know democrats 16 points ahead in the race for the house
[03:11:16.020 --> 03:11:19.220]  as recently as december that's completely vanished
[03:11:19.220 --> 03:11:24.020]  so as soon as that vanished they started freaking out again what's new about it
[03:11:24.020 --> 03:11:27.540]  this is what i've noticed over the past few weeks alex
[03:11:27.540 --> 03:11:32.740]  is targeting children like literally calling to intimidate and target
[03:11:32.740 --> 03:11:35.380]  children not only did you have peter fonder
[03:11:35.380 --> 03:11:39.220]  you know calling for baron trump to be put up under break by pedophiles
[03:11:39.220 --> 03:11:43.300]  and going out to protest border patrol agent schools at which their kids
[03:11:43.300 --> 03:11:46.900]  attend you also had the daily beast out in
[03:11:46.900 --> 03:11:50.180]  pamela gala's daughter she's got an islamic terrorist fatwar against her
[03:11:50.180 --> 03:11:53.220]  family completely exposed them put them at risk of death
[03:11:53.220 --> 03:11:58.340]  you have tom tom arnold he's this d-rate celebrity washed up celebrity
[03:11:58.340 --> 03:12:01.140]  claims he's got all these secret trump tapes
[03:12:01.140 --> 03:12:05.860]  he put out a tweet a few days ago he said next is protesting baron's private
[03:12:05.860 --> 03:12:09.460]  school as well as james and lachlan murdoch's kids
[03:12:09.460 --> 03:12:13.460]  this is what i can do to end the abuse of these children we're going to make you
[03:12:13.460 --> 03:12:16.260]  uncomfortable so they're literally talking about going out and
[03:12:16.260 --> 03:12:20.420]  intimidating people's children that's where it's reached a new level
[03:12:20.420 --> 03:12:24.340]  this is the lowest of the low so they're trying to launch a violent civil war
[03:12:24.340 --> 03:12:27.380]  many experts believe we're already in it and that they're going to try to totally
[03:12:27.380 --> 03:12:32.580]  overthrow european here in the next year
[03:12:32.580 --> 03:12:36.500]  and you know going back to what i was just saying this sarah hookabee sander
[03:12:36.500 --> 03:12:39.140]  story he was out that this wasn't violent this is just
[03:12:39.140 --> 03:12:41.860]  confronting her outside a restaurant whatever no
[03:12:41.860 --> 03:12:46.820]  she went home she went home with her husband her family went on to a different
[03:12:46.820 --> 03:12:50.340]  restaurant they follow them yeah they harassed them too
[03:12:50.340 --> 03:12:53.460]  they're not just harassing the trump administration officials
[03:12:53.460 --> 03:12:56.820]  they're targeting people's families they're the lowest of the low it's
[03:12:56.820 --> 03:13:00.180]  absolutely despicable and that's not a vote winning strategy
[03:13:00.180 --> 03:13:03.780]  it's desperation it's a sign that they're losing no i agree with you and
[03:13:03.780 --> 03:13:06.740]  that's why schumer and people like want to have the cake in here too they're like
[03:13:06.740 --> 03:13:10.260]  oh don't do that don't don't do it and then waters goes i didn't do that
[03:13:10.260 --> 03:13:17.300]  and no one's criticizing me so i agree but mueller and brennan and all them
[03:13:17.300 --> 03:13:21.940]  are still planning a violent coup they've said
[03:13:21.940 --> 03:13:24.900]  they're planning it they want a 25th amendment as well so
[03:13:24.900 --> 03:13:27.940]  i agree we're winning paul but i'm telling you that makes them go into
[03:13:27.940 --> 03:13:31.780]  cornered rat mode and i'm telling you they're gonna make some major
[03:13:31.780 --> 03:13:35.940]  moves what do you think get some you're absolutely right get some desperate
[03:13:35.940 --> 03:13:39.700]  and when they see you know people are turning it gets
[03:13:39.700 --> 03:13:43.700]  it's unknown what they're liable to do and they're known for going for the
[03:13:43.700 --> 03:13:46.340]  lowest of the lowest tactics and when it comes to the children
[03:13:46.340 --> 03:13:49.460]  well they see that you ask anyone well if you could have stopped hitler would
[03:13:49.460 --> 03:13:52.660]  you have it's like yeah they would so if they see you the
[03:13:52.660 --> 03:13:56.260]  parent as a nazi well guess what that's a little hitler right next to them
[03:13:56.260 --> 03:14:00.020]  they've already dehumanized you and your whole family so paul
[03:14:00.020 --> 03:14:02.580]  all these countries in europe even socialist countries other going bankrupt
[03:14:02.580 --> 03:14:07.300]  they're turning back the sorrow stuff i mean it is falling apart but but how
[03:14:07.300 --> 03:14:12.340]  again what's their next move because we're tomorrow's news today we can't
[03:14:12.340 --> 03:14:15.460]  what does trump need to do
[03:14:15.460 --> 03:14:18.340]  i don't know i'm not i'm not in the business of making predictions he needs
[03:14:18.340 --> 03:14:21.860]  to do what he's doing already i mean he's just had another major victory today
[03:14:21.860 --> 03:14:25.220]  and we're winning we're winning in italy we're winning the votes because people
[03:14:25.220 --> 03:14:28.180]  are seeing that they're completely unhinged and that doesn't
[03:14:28.180 --> 03:14:32.500]  resonate with calm reasonable rational people it's not a vote winning strategy
[03:14:32.500 --> 03:14:36.820]  they've got no candidate for 2020 they've got no platform apart from the social
[03:14:36.820 --> 03:14:39.380]  justice bs which if you look at the polls
[03:14:39.380 --> 03:14:43.140]  everybody's turned off to they've got nothing so they're just going to lash
[03:14:43.140 --> 03:14:46.020]  out they're going to try to incite violence inside
[03:14:46.020 --> 03:14:49.780]  stuff that we've already why don't they run maxine waters then we draft her
[03:14:49.780 --> 03:14:53.380]  then we draft maxine waters the other thing alex
[03:14:53.380 --> 03:14:56.740]  you were talking about sternovich and bill ma want to him you know him to put
[03:14:56.740 --> 03:15:00.820]  his head in an oven and commit suicide oh but he doesn't support suicide
[03:15:00.820 --> 03:15:05.300]  we had an article in october 2012 where he openly said that he wanted people to
[03:15:05.300 --> 03:15:08.580]  kill themselves to make way for room on the highway
[03:15:08.580 --> 03:15:14.100]  because the planet was overpopulated he said i'm consistently pro-death
[03:15:14.100 --> 03:15:17.860]  he said let's kill the right people he said i'm for assisted suicide i'm for
[03:15:17.860 --> 03:15:20.900]  regular suicide i'm for whatever gets the freeway moving
[03:15:20.900 --> 03:15:24.340]  so six years ago he said he was for suicide
[03:15:24.340 --> 03:15:28.020]  again and then he's saying he denies it today with sternovich well then i think
[03:15:28.020 --> 03:15:32.020]  he ought to shove a gun in his mouth and blow his little ugly brains all over
[03:15:32.020 --> 03:15:35.620]  the wall that he hates well i mean seriously
[03:15:35.620 --> 03:15:39.700]  i mean you want us all to die how about you die the court emperor palpatine
[03:15:39.700 --> 03:15:43.460]  no no no you will die
[03:15:43.460 --> 03:15:46.500]  paul can you do it by the name give me a palpatine
[03:15:46.500 --> 03:15:50.900]  no you will die amazing lucas you're awesome

[03:17:54.100 --> 03:17:58.020]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[03:17:58.020 --> 03:18:01.300]  the real drama can be found here in leilani estates
[03:18:01.300 --> 03:18:05.220]  but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned
[03:18:05.220 --> 03:18:09.540]  about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy
[03:18:09.540 --> 03:18:13.700]  metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to
[03:18:13.700 --> 03:18:17.860]  unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[03:18:17.860 --> 03:18:23.300]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[03:18:23.300 --> 03:18:27.140]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[03:18:27.140 --> 03:18:30.980]  next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter
[03:18:30.980 --> 03:18:34.580]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:18:34.580 --> 03:18:38.180]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels
[03:18:38.180 --> 03:18:43.540]  as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[03:18:43.540 --> 03:18:47.540]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate
[03:18:47.540 --> 03:18:51.300]  a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water
[03:18:51.300 --> 03:18:55.860]  filtration system will purify it we've taken thousands of years of
[03:18:55.860 --> 03:18:59.140]  known research and put it together with our own four years of
[03:18:59.140 --> 03:19:02.900]  seeking and testing to find the very best systems that god gave us through
[03:19:02.900 --> 03:19:06.820]  mother nature to detoxify the body that's why i'm introducing z shield
[03:19:06.820 --> 03:19:12.260]  toxic metal and chemical defense support it's made in the usa it's filled with
[03:19:12.260 --> 03:19:16.180]  known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[03:19:16.180 --> 03:19:20.020]  the body and it supports the info war it is a classical 360 win
[03:19:20.020 --> 03:19:23.780]  this is the formula that i personally have been taking for over a year and
[03:19:23.780 --> 03:19:28.580]  now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier

[03:19:57.060 --> 03:20:01.620]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:06.900 --> 03:20:10.820]  live from the info wars dot com studios
[03:20:10.820 --> 03:20:14.740]  you're listening to the alex jones show and now
[03:20:14.740 --> 03:20:20.900]  your host paul joseph watson
[03:20:20.900 --> 03:20:24.900]  we're live but it's the fourth hour of the alex jones show in the next segment
[03:20:24.900 --> 03:20:29.140]  we're going to play a clip from steven crowder's youtube channel
[03:20:29.140 --> 03:20:32.660]  basically he went out to an event he had one of these um
[03:20:32.660 --> 03:20:36.260]  you know changed my mind event one of the leftist there
[03:20:36.260 --> 03:20:41.140]  doxxed them tweeted out their location and then encouraged other people to
[03:20:41.140 --> 03:20:45.540]  fire bomb their van because they're so tolerant peaceful and loving
[03:20:45.540 --> 03:20:49.460]  so then they found this woman at the uh the same event i think or she had a
[03:20:49.460 --> 03:20:51.940]  a boo that the same event that crowd was at
[03:20:51.940 --> 03:20:55.940]  confronted her confronted the mob that surrounded her to try and get one of
[03:20:55.940 --> 03:20:59.300]  them one of them to disavow the violence
[03:20:59.300 --> 03:21:02.820]  not only did they fail to get them to disavow it they basically
[03:21:02.820 --> 03:21:06.340]  huddled around them in a in a huge mob tried to intimidate them called them
[03:21:06.340 --> 03:21:09.700]  nazis of course and completely justified it
[03:21:09.700 --> 03:21:13.700]  again this is just the start of this violent rhetoric you get these uh
[03:21:13.700 --> 03:21:18.820]  these doxxing incidents you get that many people i rate incited
[03:21:18.820 --> 03:21:22.820]  and it could end in bloodshed as it already did with uh james t hodgkinson
[03:21:22.820 --> 03:21:27.220]  shooting just over a year ago of course a minor miracle that nobody died and
[03:21:27.220 --> 03:21:31.460]  attempted massacre of republicans by a far left extremist
[03:21:31.460 --> 03:21:35.620]  radicalized by mainstream media propaganda
[03:21:35.620 --> 03:21:38.740]  talking of mainstream media propaganda there was a new york time
[03:21:38.740 --> 03:21:42.180]  timespiece today that trended on twitter this morning entitled
[03:21:42.180 --> 03:21:47.140]  we have a crisis of democracy not manners well no you have a crisis of
[03:21:47.140 --> 03:21:50.020]  butthurt because he still refused to accept the results of democratic
[03:21:50.020 --> 03:21:53.380]  election and you're getting more desperate because
[03:21:53.380 --> 03:21:57.300]  you see that trump's likely to win in 2020 the republicans now have a great
[03:21:57.300 --> 03:22:00.660]  chance of holding on to the house in 2018
[03:22:00.660 --> 03:22:05.860]  you've blown your 16-point lead the blue wave has turned into a drizzle
[03:22:05.860 --> 03:22:09.220]  and now you're freaking out about it so they had this article
[03:22:09.220 --> 03:22:13.860]  new york times trending article and down below right near the bottom of it it
[03:22:13.860 --> 03:22:17.780]  said this quote she's trying to justify the
[03:22:17.780 --> 03:22:21.300]  whole maxine waters thing basically agreeing that people should be confronted
[03:22:21.300 --> 03:22:24.660]  in an intimidating way she said this the writer
[03:22:24.660 --> 03:22:29.780]  i know of no left-wing publication that has run quasi-pornographic fantasies
[03:22:29.780 --> 03:22:34.340]  about murdering political enemies really
[03:22:34.340 --> 03:22:38.580]  really there was literally one just yesterday and we wrote about it up on
[03:22:38.580 --> 03:22:42.500]  info wars dot com headline left-wing writer suggests
[03:22:42.500 --> 03:22:47.540]  anti-trump protesters should carry out domestic terror attacks
[03:22:47.540 --> 03:22:50.580]  now they got a picture of this guy he looked like he was completely out to
[03:22:50.580 --> 03:22:54.820]  lunch he was wearing a batman mask looked like some kind of ginger
[03:22:54.820 --> 03:22:59.780]  isis jihadist because i'm sure he's tolerant and peaceful and loving
[03:22:59.780 --> 03:23:06.020]  a far-left columnist now this this was a website called splinter news
[03:23:06.020 --> 03:23:10.740]  owned by univision the division of gizmodo media group so they bought out
[03:23:10.740 --> 03:23:14.420]  gizmodo media group this splinter news was one of those websites formerly owned
[03:23:14.420 --> 03:23:18.340]  by gizmodo it's now owned by univision communications
[03:23:18.340 --> 03:23:23.220]  so it's a massive corporation owning this fairly sizable left-wing media
[03:23:23.220 --> 03:23:26.580]  website and in an article entitled this is just
[03:23:26.580 --> 03:23:30.260]  the beginning the writer hamilton knowl and writes this is all
[03:23:30.260 --> 03:23:33.700]  going to get more extreme and it should
[03:23:33.700 --> 03:23:36.980]  let me say that again this is why you wrote this is all going to get more
[03:23:36.980 --> 03:23:41.460]  extreme and it should that's an open call for
[03:23:41.460 --> 03:23:45.460]  extremism he went on to say that trump administration
[03:23:45.460 --> 03:23:50.980]  officials should not be able to quote live their lives in peace
[03:23:50.980 --> 03:23:55.300]  and what did he mean by that well he went on to say read an effing history book
[03:23:55.300 --> 03:24:00.660]  read a recent history book the u.s had thousands of domestic bombings per year
[03:24:00.660 --> 03:24:04.100]  in the early 1970s of course he's talking about
[03:24:04.100 --> 03:24:07.940]  the weathermen underground domestic terror attacks carried out
[03:24:07.940 --> 03:24:13.380]  by far left terrorist organizations including black panther organizations as
[03:24:13.380 --> 03:24:15.780]  well so he's talking about making the lives of
[03:24:15.780 --> 03:24:18.580]  trump administration officials uncomfortable
[03:24:18.580 --> 03:24:21.620]  he's saying that things are going to get more extreme and they should
[03:24:21.620 --> 03:24:25.060]  and then he talks about domestic bombings in the united states
[03:24:25.060 --> 03:24:30.020]  gee i wonder what the connection is there can we put two and two together
[03:24:30.020 --> 03:24:33.700]  he went on to say this quote the day will come
[03:24:33.700 --> 03:24:37.460]  sooner than you all think when trump administration officials will lock back
[03:24:37.460 --> 03:24:39.860]  fondly on the time when all they had to worry about
[03:24:39.860 --> 03:24:43.220]  was getting hollered out at a Mexican restaurant
[03:24:43.220 --> 03:24:46.420]  he went on to say when you aggressively eff with people's lives you should not be
[03:24:46.420 --> 03:24:49.620]  surprised when they decide to eff with yours
[03:24:49.620 --> 03:24:53.700]  so he's clearly putting it in the context of justifying encouraging some
[03:24:53.700 --> 03:24:57.540]  would say even inciting domestic terror attacks
[03:24:57.540 --> 03:25:01.620]  against either trump supporters or trump administration officials
[03:25:01.620 --> 03:25:05.300]  he justified it by claiming that trump administration was implementing fascism
[03:25:05.300 --> 03:25:09.220]  again going back to this idea of de-legitimizing dehumanizing people
[03:25:09.220 --> 03:25:13.940]  for attack for violent assault by calling them Nazis
[03:25:13.940 --> 03:25:16.660]  he went on to say the people who are responsible for what is happening are
[03:25:16.660 --> 03:25:20.260]  not going to get out of this with their happy wealthy respectable lives
[03:25:20.260 --> 03:25:24.180]  unscathed and the ones who make the laws are not going to like what happens when
[03:25:24.180 --> 03:25:27.540]  America starts to regard them as the criminals
[03:25:27.540 --> 03:25:33.460]  openly inciting potential attacks against trump administration officials
[03:25:33.460 --> 03:25:36.820]  or trump supporters the context of that article
[03:25:36.820 --> 03:25:40.820]  cannot be taken any other way and he hasn't come out as far as i looked on
[03:25:40.820 --> 03:25:45.060]  his twitter an hour ago and disavowed it or walked it back or said
[03:25:45.060 --> 03:25:49.300]  he's not calling for violence the article stands it's up on a major left
[03:25:49.300 --> 03:25:53.540]  wing website owned by Univision so when the New York Times says
[03:25:53.540 --> 03:25:57.540]  oh there's no left wing publication that's ever endorsed violence
[03:25:57.540 --> 03:26:00.660]  against political enemies literally it happened
[03:26:00.660 --> 03:26:05.140]  last night yesterday and there are numerous other examples of it but the
[03:26:05.140 --> 03:26:08.580]  article's still up there and this this is the tone this is the
[03:26:08.580 --> 03:26:10.900]  rhetoric these are the times that we're living in
[03:26:10.900 --> 03:26:14.980]  absolute insanity we have a professor
[03:26:14.980 --> 03:26:18.980]  University of Tennessee law professor glenn hall and reynolds who wrote an
[03:26:18.980 --> 03:26:22.820]  article in the usa today saying what alex jones said on
[03:26:22.820 --> 03:26:26.100]  sunday that we're already in a civil war albeit
[03:26:26.100 --> 03:26:29.940]  low level but he said in an op-ed for usa today that america
[03:26:29.940 --> 03:26:33.220]  is headed towards a civil war he asked the question in the headline
[03:26:33.220 --> 03:26:36.980]  and then he says it's already begun those are his words
[03:26:36.980 --> 03:26:40.260]  well hollywood has basically turned its products and its award shows into
[03:26:40.260 --> 03:26:44.180]  showcases for the resistance americans are already sorting
[03:26:44.180 --> 03:26:47.620]  themselves into communities that predominantly red or blue
[03:26:47.620 --> 03:26:51.460]  so he said that the uh sarah hookaby sanders incident which again
[03:26:51.460 --> 03:26:55.380]  you've probably seen this by now she wasn't just harassed in the restaurant
[03:26:55.380 --> 03:26:59.220]  after she was harassed initially she left with her husband they went home
[03:26:59.220 --> 03:27:04.980]  and her family went to a different restaurant and they were harassed too
[03:27:04.980 --> 03:27:07.700]  so they're directly targeting people's families
[03:27:07.700 --> 03:27:11.380]  even if the target of their anger is no longer present
[03:27:11.380 --> 03:27:15.380]  which goes back to what peter fonder said oh by the way peter fonder
[03:27:15.380 --> 03:27:18.580]  what is it now nearly a week since he said this on twitter
[03:27:18.580 --> 03:27:22.260]  advocating hacking a government database a crime
[03:27:22.260 --> 03:27:26.260]  advocating targeting and intimidating the children
[03:27:26.260 --> 03:27:30.660]  of border patrol agents at their schools advocating putting
[03:27:30.660 --> 03:27:35.220]  baron trump in a cage and making him get raped by peter files
[03:27:35.220 --> 03:27:38.660]  do you think any of those violate twitter's terms of service yes
[03:27:38.660 --> 03:27:42.100]  all three do clearly is he banned on twitter
[03:27:42.100 --> 03:27:47.380]  no he wasn't even suspended for 24 hours he deleted the tweets he was back on
[03:27:47.380 --> 03:27:50.980]  you know my lo got banned for making fun of a ghost busters movie
[03:27:50.980 --> 03:27:55.140]  lifetime ban oh well if you want to put a kid in a cage to be raped by peter
[03:27:55.140 --> 03:27:58.580]  files intimidate people's children hack a government database
[03:27:58.580 --> 03:28:03.220]  no problem you don't even get a 24 hour ban
[03:28:03.220 --> 03:28:06.180]  but again going back to this article this professor says that the civil war has
[03:28:06.180 --> 03:28:09.380]  already begun because he said that civil society
[03:28:09.380 --> 03:28:12.980]  is being eroded the polarization can partly be blamed on the
[03:28:12.980 --> 03:28:16.180]  disintegration of churches organizations and neighborhoods
[03:28:16.180 --> 03:28:21.140]  which previously helped people build social ties that transcended politics
[03:28:21.140 --> 03:28:24.340]  so again he's talking about the atomization of society the fact that
[03:28:24.340 --> 03:28:27.460]  nobody talks to their neighbors anymore the fact that fewer and fewer people
[03:28:27.460 --> 03:28:31.620]  participate in civil society or go to church so they don't meet people they
[03:28:31.620 --> 03:28:34.740]  don't have conversations even if they disagree politically
[03:28:34.740 --> 03:28:38.820]  to kind of resonate and bond as human beings as Americans who all live in the
[03:28:38.820 --> 03:28:41.380]  same country and should want the best for everyone
[03:28:41.380 --> 03:28:45.140]  this is the alex germ show live fourth hour we'll be back in four wars

[03:35:26.180 --> 03:35:30.660]  he had one of his events which is you know the famous change my mind events
[03:35:30.660 --> 03:35:34.340]  when he was doxxed and basically threatened by a leftist who encouraged
[03:35:34.340 --> 03:35:38.100]  people to go and fire bomb his van with him in it
[03:35:38.100 --> 03:35:41.380]  and then they found this woman this tolerant leftist
[03:35:41.380 --> 03:35:45.140]  at another event later on down the line and they confronted her
[03:35:45.140 --> 03:35:48.980]  let's see what happened here it is
[03:35:48.980 --> 03:35:52.260]  we were at the texas state democrat convention taping a fourth of july
[03:35:52.260 --> 03:35:55.460]  theme to change my mind to be released on july 2nd when
[03:35:55.460 --> 03:35:59.380]  we noticed a familiar face it's firebomb lady
[03:35:59.380 --> 03:36:02.980]  that's the girl who posted our location in austin precisely and called for
[03:36:02.980 --> 03:36:06.420]  people to firebomb our car and then doubled down with a second
[03:36:06.420 --> 03:36:11.780]  post for additional domestic terrorism context so i decided to confront her
[03:36:11.780 --> 03:36:16.340]  take it
[03:36:17.540 --> 03:36:22.820]  how are you today quick question for you why would you encourage people to fire
[03:36:22.820 --> 03:36:27.780]  bomb my van why would you do that
[03:36:27.780 --> 03:36:31.060]  do you think that's appropriate to encourage people to firebomb my van
[03:36:31.060 --> 03:36:34.500]  and hurt my crew when we're just expressing a difference of opinion
[03:36:34.500 --> 03:36:37.300]  sorry could you repeat that why would you threaten to firebomb my van or
[03:36:37.300 --> 03:36:41.540]  encourage other people to do it at first she just denied denied
[03:36:41.540 --> 03:36:44.820]  good thing we brought a bristol board as a matter of fact we have your pictures
[03:36:44.820 --> 03:36:48.580]  right here of your tweets of your posting our location right now let's
[03:36:48.580 --> 03:36:51.940]  hold that for me there not kj so is that the way you deal with civil
[03:36:51.940 --> 03:36:55.380]  disagreements i've heard a lot of people talk
[03:36:55.380 --> 03:36:58.100]  about calls to civility with president trump and conservatives but what about
[03:36:58.100 --> 03:37:01.620]  this what about firebombing someone committing acts of violence i would
[03:37:01.620 --> 03:37:04.580]  never encourage acts of violence against you i don't want anyone to ever hurt
[03:37:04.580 --> 03:37:10.100]  you nothing huh this is the tolerant left
[03:37:10.100 --> 03:37:12.980]  no my feelings aren't hurt i just don't want to be firebomb really literally
[03:37:12.980 --> 03:37:16.980]  have a place in today's political discussion wouldn't you say
[03:37:16.980 --> 03:37:20.020]  why the eye roll you think it does have a player role
[03:37:20.020 --> 03:37:24.180]  as long as it's the right target really no opinion in this all what if a
[03:37:24.180 --> 03:37:27.060]  conservative what if donald trump were to encourage anyone to firebomb somebody
[03:37:27.060 --> 03:37:29.540]  else well when they go to war that's what they're doing
[03:37:29.540 --> 03:37:32.260]  we were not in war we were just having a discussion as we just did with three or
[03:37:32.260 --> 03:37:36.900]  four democrats at a van literally said we need to kill uh the innocent families
[03:37:36.900 --> 03:37:40.580]  so did he say that when did he say that but i didn't say that about my family
[03:37:40.580 --> 03:37:44.180]  but i've never said that what he said what he said what if trump said this
[03:37:44.180 --> 03:37:47.460]  do you condemn that uh no i think it's great you think you think it's great
[03:37:47.460 --> 03:37:50.100]  so you're cool with firebombing people who've never committed an act of
[03:37:50.100 --> 03:37:52.340]  violence just throwing strikes on children
[03:37:52.340 --> 03:37:55.220]  this silly falls out right so this doesn't bother you
[03:37:55.220 --> 03:37:59.380]  you're okay with encouraging violence against people i just want to make sure
[03:37:59.380 --> 03:38:04.340]  what you are human right you are all human right
[03:38:04.340 --> 03:38:08.340]  you do realize we're filming that's fine go ahead and film we have the right
[03:38:08.340 --> 03:38:13.700]  to have help there is a human right yeah what about a van is not a life
[03:38:13.700 --> 03:38:17.700]  what are the people in the van know
[03:38:17.700 --> 03:38:24.260]  how dare is that human right no one's gonna speak out against this
[03:38:24.260 --> 03:38:28.900]  how dare is a human right how dare is a human right
[03:38:28.900 --> 03:38:30.900]  How dare is a human right?
[03:38:30.900 --> 03:38:31.900]  So violence can't rule.
[03:38:31.900 --> 03:38:32.900]  How dare is a human right?
[03:38:32.900 --> 03:38:33.900]  Come on, men.
[03:38:33.900 --> 03:38:34.900]  Let's not get violent.
[03:38:34.900 --> 03:38:35.900]  How dare is a human right?
[03:38:35.900 --> 03:38:36.900]  I can do this.
[03:38:36.900 --> 03:38:37.900]  How dare is a human right?
[03:38:37.900 --> 03:38:38.900]  I can do it all day.
[03:38:38.900 --> 03:38:42.900]  You're disrespecting my flag by wearing it on your body.
[03:38:42.900 --> 03:38:43.900]  Really?
[03:38:43.900 --> 03:38:45.900]  What bothers me is encouraging acts of violence and acting like an animal.
[03:38:45.900 --> 03:38:46.900]  How dare is a human right?
[03:38:46.900 --> 03:38:47.900]  How dare is a human right?
[03:38:47.900 --> 03:38:51.900]  You're the one who started the chant.
[03:38:51.900 --> 03:38:52.900]  You started the chant.
[03:38:52.900 --> 03:38:53.900]  What's the solution?
[03:38:53.900 --> 03:38:54.900]  What's the solution?
[03:38:54.900 --> 03:38:55.900]  What's the solution?
[03:38:55.900 --> 03:38:56.900]  What's the solution?
[03:38:56.900 --> 03:38:57.900]  What's the solution?
[03:38:57.900 --> 03:38:58.900]  What's the solution?
[03:38:58.900 --> 03:39:00.900]  Nonviolent speech.
[03:39:00.900 --> 03:39:01.900]  You animals.
[03:39:01.900 --> 03:39:03.900]  I'm just looking for one condemnation.
[03:39:03.900 --> 03:39:05.900]  Anyone to have an opinion on encouraging acts of violence,
[03:39:05.900 --> 03:39:07.900]  I discourage them across the board.
[03:39:07.900 --> 03:39:09.900]  You're creating acts of violence against her by posting her face everywhere
[03:39:09.900 --> 03:39:11.900]  and trying to get people to hurt her.
[03:39:11.900 --> 03:39:12.900]  I've never done that.
[03:39:12.900 --> 03:39:13.900]  What?
[03:39:13.900 --> 03:39:14.900]  You're...
[03:39:14.900 --> 03:39:17.900]  This is her asking people to bomb my van.
[03:39:17.900 --> 03:39:18.900]  No, she didn't.
[03:39:18.900 --> 03:39:19.900]  You put it on Twitter.
[03:39:19.900 --> 03:39:22.900]  Bomb, van, fire, take care of it.
[03:39:22.900 --> 03:39:24.900]  This was clearly an exercise in futility.
[03:39:24.900 --> 03:39:26.900]  So they brought out the heavy artillery.
[03:39:26.900 --> 03:39:27.900]  Stand up, fight back.
[03:39:27.900 --> 03:39:28.900]  Good, good.
[03:39:28.900 --> 03:39:30.900]  You're a very violent, angry little fella.
[03:39:30.900 --> 03:39:31.900]  Stand up, fight back.
[03:39:31.900 --> 03:39:32.900]  Thank you.
[03:39:32.900 --> 03:39:34.900]  I see you're strong with the mob,
[03:39:34.900 --> 03:39:35.900]  but you should be ashamed of yourself.
[03:39:35.900 --> 03:39:36.900]  Stand.
[03:39:36.900 --> 03:39:37.900]  You should be ashamed of yourself.
[03:39:37.900 --> 03:39:38.900]  Stand up, fight back.
[03:39:38.900 --> 03:39:39.900]  You missed it.
[03:39:39.900 --> 03:39:40.900]  You missed it too.
[03:39:40.900 --> 03:39:41.900]  One.
[03:39:41.900 --> 03:39:42.900]  Stand up, fight back.
[03:39:42.900 --> 03:39:43.900]  You're on beat.
[03:39:43.900 --> 03:39:44.900]  You're all false.
[03:39:44.900 --> 03:39:45.900]  Of course not.
[03:39:45.900 --> 03:39:49.900]  Do you believe that all people, regardless of their race,
[03:39:49.900 --> 03:39:51.900]  should have equal opportunities in this country?
[03:39:51.900 --> 03:39:52.900]  Absolutely.
[03:39:52.900 --> 03:39:54.900]  Nothing to say.
[03:39:54.900 --> 03:39:55.900]  Just an apology would be nice.
[03:39:55.900 --> 03:39:56.900]  Stand up, fight back.
[03:39:56.900 --> 03:39:58.900]  You are a coward, though.
[03:39:58.900 --> 03:40:00.900]  She ain't no woman a coward.
[03:40:00.900 --> 03:40:01.900]  No woman a coward.
[03:40:01.900 --> 03:40:02.900]  You're a coward, too.
[03:40:02.900 --> 03:40:03.900]  Oh, thank you.
[03:40:03.900 --> 03:40:04.900]  You're a coward.
[03:40:04.900 --> 03:40:05.900]  I hope I'm saying you're all cowards.
[03:40:05.900 --> 03:40:06.900]  You're the coward.
[03:40:06.900 --> 03:40:07.900]  You're the coward.
[03:40:07.900 --> 03:40:08.900]  We can see how big of a man you are.
[03:40:08.900 --> 03:40:10.900]  You want to go to the restroom?
[03:40:10.900 --> 03:40:11.900]  No, no, no, no.
[03:40:11.900 --> 03:40:12.900]  Come on, man.
[03:40:12.900 --> 03:40:13.900]  Let's stop being cowardly.
[03:40:13.900 --> 03:40:15.900]  And then, of course, they called the brutal,
[03:40:15.900 --> 03:40:18.900]  fascist, racist police who agreed with us that they were dicks.
[03:40:18.900 --> 03:40:21.900]  Well, look, see, this lady encouraged acts of violence against me,
[03:40:21.900 --> 03:40:22.900]  and so I just was asking her why.
[03:40:22.900 --> 03:40:23.900]  And she started me down.
[03:40:23.900 --> 03:40:26.900]  Look, that seems pretty reprehensible, right?
[03:40:26.900 --> 03:40:28.900]  To post my location in our van in a bomb saying,
[03:40:28.900 --> 03:40:29.900]  take care of it.
[03:40:29.900 --> 03:40:30.900]  That's pretty bad, isn't it?
[03:40:30.900 --> 03:40:31.900]  Yeah.
[03:40:31.900 --> 03:40:32.900]  See that?
[03:40:32.900 --> 03:40:34.900]  Anyone who's not with you thinks that's bad.
[03:40:34.900 --> 03:40:37.900]  Hey, officer, this is conferring a lady who encouraged firebombing
[03:40:37.900 --> 03:40:39.900]  against my car and asked her why she did that.
[03:40:39.900 --> 03:40:40.900]  Don't worry about it.
[03:40:40.900 --> 03:40:42.900]  But they had to ask us to leave anyway, which we did.
[03:40:42.900 --> 03:40:45.900]  Unfortunately, there still seem to be some miscommunications.
[03:40:45.900 --> 03:40:46.900]  Nazi, go away!
[03:40:46.900 --> 03:40:48.900]  Nazi, go away!
[03:40:48.900 --> 03:40:51.900]  It seems they're less offended by the Nazism than by the fact
[03:40:51.900 --> 03:40:53.900]  that we had a better booth than them.
[03:40:53.900 --> 03:40:56.900]  I can just forgot to check the floor plan.
[03:40:56.900 --> 03:40:58.900]  Oh, well, as you can see on this channel,
[03:40:58.900 --> 03:41:00.900]  my first choice is civil discourse.
[03:41:00.900 --> 03:41:03.900]  But when you call people to act of violence, know this,
[03:41:03.900 --> 03:41:05.900]  I will find you.
[03:41:05.900 --> 03:41:07.900]  I will confront you.
[03:41:07.900 --> 03:41:09.900]  And I will shame you.
[03:41:09.900 --> 03:41:11.900]  America first.
[03:41:11.900 --> 03:41:12.900]  Love the flow.
[03:41:12.900 --> 03:41:13.900]  So there you have it.
[03:41:13.900 --> 03:41:16.900]  Steve and crowd are confronting somebody who threatened to firebomb
[03:41:16.900 --> 03:41:19.900]  or at least encourage others to firebomb his van.
[03:41:19.900 --> 03:41:22.900]  And again, the whole narrative in the leftist media today
[03:41:22.900 --> 03:41:26.900]  is, oh, the Tea Party stood up and confronted Democrats during
[03:41:26.900 --> 03:41:27.900]  the Obama era.
[03:41:27.900 --> 03:41:28.900]  Yes, and they did.
[03:41:28.900 --> 03:41:29.900]  And it was very confrontational.
[03:41:29.900 --> 03:41:30.900]  It was aggressive.
[03:41:30.900 --> 03:41:33.900]  But if you want to talk about legitimizing violence,
[03:41:33.900 --> 03:41:36.900]  you want to talk about a situation where, you know,
[03:41:36.900 --> 03:41:39.900]  the New York Times is openly siding with this.
[03:41:39.900 --> 03:41:43.900]  We had the whole punch in Nazi narrative for the past year plus.
[03:41:43.900 --> 03:41:46.900]  Who's a Nazi, anyone who disagrees with you?
[03:41:46.900 --> 03:41:48.900]  See how the slippery slope goes here.
[03:41:48.900 --> 03:41:52.900]  We've got people openly now calling Trump a Nazi, you know,
[03:41:52.900 --> 03:41:54.900]  shock horror, get a new insult.
[03:41:54.900 --> 03:41:58.900]  Again, the lack of originality is tiresome to say the least.
[03:41:58.900 --> 03:42:02.900]  But again, if you dehumanize somebody, if you dehumanize
[03:42:02.900 --> 03:42:05.900]  tens of millions of American voters as Nazis,
[03:42:05.900 --> 03:42:07.900]  and then encourage in-site violence against them,
[03:42:07.900 --> 03:42:12.900]  as left-wing websites are now doing, owned by giant corporations,
[03:42:12.900 --> 03:42:14.900]  that legitimizes it.
[03:42:14.900 --> 03:42:17.900]  That's different from a few toothless hicks spewing death threats
[03:42:17.900 --> 03:42:21.900]  against Obama on Twitter, you know, back in 2010.
[03:42:21.900 --> 03:42:24.900]  Little bit different when it's being codified and legitimized
[03:42:24.900 --> 03:42:26.900]  by the mainstream media.
[03:42:26.900 --> 03:42:29.900]  When this hysteria is being whipped up every single day
[03:42:29.900 --> 03:42:33.900]  by people on television with huge audiences still.
[03:42:33.900 --> 03:42:34.900]  That's the difference.
[03:42:34.900 --> 03:42:36.900]  They've legitimized it.
[03:42:36.900 --> 03:42:38.900]  They've moved the Overton window so far left.
[03:42:38.900 --> 03:42:42.900]  They've become so hysterical that it's now directly leading
[03:42:42.900 --> 03:42:44.900]  to attacks on Trump supporters as it has for the past year,
[03:42:44.900 --> 03:42:48.900]  and events like James T. Hodgkinson attempting to massacre people.
[03:42:48.900 --> 03:42:50.900]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live in 4Wars.com.
[03:42:50.900 --> 03:43:09.900]  We'll be back.
[03:43:20.900 --> 03:43:22.900]  What we've learned was that there was, in fact,
[03:43:22.900 --> 03:43:25.900]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:43:25.900 --> 03:43:29.900]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter,
[03:43:29.900 --> 03:43:33.900]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[03:43:33.900 --> 03:43:36.900]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:43:36.900 --> 03:43:39.900]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure
[03:43:39.900 --> 03:43:42.900]  raises the pH of the water.
[03:43:42.900 --> 03:43:45.900]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain
[03:43:45.900 --> 03:43:47.900]  can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:43:47.900 --> 03:43:52.900]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:44:18.900 --> 03:44:21.900]  If you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[03:44:21.900 --> 03:44:25.900]  Winner's Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of Vitamin D3.
[03:44:25.900 --> 03:44:27.900]  The research and development took over two years,
[03:44:27.900 --> 03:44:30.900]  but the result, as verified by independent laboratories,
[03:44:30.900 --> 03:44:33.900]  is the best vegan Vitamin D3 product in the world.

[03:44:41.900 --> 03:44:44.900]  but Vitamin D supports our memory and brain function,
[03:44:44.900 --> 03:44:46.900]  something the globalists are targeting.

[03:45:56.900 --> 03:45:58.900]  You're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[03:45:58.900 --> 03:45:59.900]  Hey, Alex. Hey.
[03:45:59.900 --> 03:46:03.900]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[03:46:03.900 --> 03:46:06.900]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet,
[03:46:06.900 --> 03:46:08.900]  it was just blue text on a white screen
[03:46:08.900 --> 03:46:11.900]  and it had to load down the page on my dial-up internet.
[03:46:11.900 --> 03:46:14.900]  And I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books
[03:46:14.900 --> 03:46:17.900]  and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[03:46:17.900 --> 03:46:20.900]  And I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield.
[03:46:20.900 --> 03:46:25.900]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the SuperMail Vitality, the Caveman,
[03:46:25.900 --> 03:46:28.900]  the Real Red Pill, MycoZX body. It's all amazing.
[03:46:28.900 --> 03:46:29.900]  Thank you, brother.
[03:46:29.900 --> 03:46:32.900]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much,
[03:46:32.900 --> 03:46:36.900]  it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body,
[03:46:36.900 --> 03:46:38.900]  you're detoxing the spirit.
[03:46:38.900 --> 03:46:41.900]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God,
[03:46:41.900 --> 03:46:43.900]  but the more you chase God.
[03:46:43.900 --> 03:46:46.900]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you,
[03:46:46.900 --> 03:46:48.900]  the crew, and the listeners out there.
[03:46:48.900 --> 03:47:09.900]  Okay, 1776 World War.
[03:47:19.900 --> 03:47:22.900]  It is the final segment of the fourth hour.
[03:47:22.900 --> 03:47:25.900]  War Room is coming up at the top of the hour.
[03:47:25.900 --> 03:47:28.900]  We're going to go to this Conrad Black video here in a second.
[03:47:28.900 --> 03:47:30.900]  Headline up on info was Conrad Black.
[03:47:30.900 --> 03:47:33.900]  Trump is winning a bloodless civil war against the establishment.
[03:47:33.900 --> 03:47:38.900]  But first, I want to read just a small passage from John Nolte's article out of Breitbart today.
[03:47:38.900 --> 03:47:43.900]  Again, talking about why we're seeing this heightened hysterical rhetoric from the left.
[03:47:43.900 --> 03:47:47.900]  Because again, as I pointed out, every time a leftist promotes extremism and violence,
[03:47:47.900 --> 03:47:51.900]  as Splinter News did yesterday, and then the New York Times lied about it and said,
[03:47:51.900 --> 03:47:53.900]  no left-wing websites ever doing this.
[03:47:53.900 --> 03:47:55.900]  Literally, they did it on the same day.
[03:47:55.900 --> 03:47:59.900]  Again, when they do this, it puts another reasonable-minded person off voting for Democrats.
[03:47:59.900 --> 03:48:05.900]  This is not a vote-winning strategy to act crazy to throw your toys out of the pram
[03:48:05.900 --> 03:48:07.900]  every time something doesn't go your way.
[03:48:07.900 --> 03:48:10.900]  Get an actual platform like Trump got.
[03:48:10.900 --> 03:48:12.900]  That's how he won the election.
[03:48:12.900 --> 03:48:15.900]  Again, this whole crisis of democracy mantra.
[03:48:15.900 --> 03:48:20.900]  The only crisis is within you and within your mindset and your narrative.
[03:48:20.900 --> 03:48:25.900]  Because again, your harmful, intolerant ideology is being rejected by everybody.
[03:48:25.900 --> 03:48:27.900]  This is what John Nolte said about it.
[03:48:27.900 --> 03:48:29.900]  That's the article out of Splinter News yesterday,
[03:48:29.900 --> 03:48:34.900]  where literally they talk about Trump administration officials should be glad
[03:48:34.900 --> 03:48:37.900]  that they're only getting hollered outside restaurants
[03:48:37.900 --> 03:48:40.900]  and basically saying that it needs to get more extreme.
[03:48:40.900 --> 03:48:43.900]  Then he goes on to talk about domestic bombings.
[03:48:43.900 --> 03:48:46.900]  Gee, what kind of connection is he making there?
[03:48:46.900 --> 03:48:50.900]  But again, this is what John Nolte said about the situation in his article today.
[03:48:50.900 --> 03:48:54.900]  He said, what the left and the media are doing is testing us,
[03:48:54.900 --> 03:48:58.900]  testing how far they can go, how much we will take, how ugly they can get.
[03:48:58.900 --> 03:49:02.900]  They're also hoping to normalize this violent behavior in the eyes of the public.
[03:49:02.900 --> 03:49:06.900]  They want us to get as used to it to see it as the status quo.
[03:49:06.900 --> 03:49:08.900]  So they're trying to normalize this.
[03:49:08.900 --> 03:49:13.900]  Again, if they can normalize it that calling for violence is a legitimate form of political discourse,
[03:49:13.900 --> 03:49:15.900]  what's the next stage?
[03:49:15.900 --> 03:49:16.900]  Gee, I wonder.
[03:49:16.900 --> 03:49:19.900]  He goes on to say the left cannot win at the ballot box.
[03:49:19.900 --> 03:49:21.900]  Their media no longer have the power to persuade.
[03:49:21.900 --> 03:49:26.900]  Their elected officials are completely out of ideas other than socialism.
[03:49:26.900 --> 03:49:28.900]  So now they turn to violence.
[03:49:28.900 --> 03:49:30.900]  And again, that's exactly it.
[03:49:30.900 --> 03:49:34.900]  You talk about violent rhetoric during the Obama era.
[03:49:34.900 --> 03:49:39.900]  I mean, it was there in the background, but it was nowhere near the levels we see now.
[03:49:39.900 --> 03:49:45.900]  And it certainly wasn't being legitimized by centrist, by the mainstream media on the right.
[03:49:45.900 --> 03:49:50.900]  If you want to talk about Fox News or however, like it is being legitimized by the big media,
[03:49:50.900 --> 03:49:53.900]  by the hysterical media on the left right now.
[03:49:53.900 --> 03:49:58.900]  But Conrad Black came out today in an interview, and I talked about this with Alex earlier.
[03:49:58.900 --> 03:50:02.900]  This is a guy who was a former Bilderberg steering committee member.
[03:50:02.900 --> 03:50:04.900]  Again, he was part of the elite.
[03:50:04.900 --> 03:50:06.900]  At least he had one foot in the elite.
[03:50:06.900 --> 03:50:08.900]  Conrad Black, former newspaper magnate.
[03:50:08.900 --> 03:50:10.900]  He earned a bunch of papers around the world.
[03:50:10.900 --> 03:50:14.900]  Big former globalist now apparently changed course.
[03:50:14.900 --> 03:50:18.900]  He said that Donald Trump has launched a bloodless civil war against the establishment
[03:50:18.900 --> 03:50:24.900]  and basically makes the point that he's winning is the clip.
[03:50:24.900 --> 03:50:29.900]  What was needed was a bloodless civil war to clean up the Washington sleaze factory.
[03:50:29.900 --> 03:50:33.900]  The entire government of the United States had become a shambles.
[03:50:33.900 --> 03:50:39.900]  Let me remind you, in the previous 20 years, you had the greatest economic crisis since the 1930s,
[03:50:39.900 --> 03:50:44.900]  brought on by bad American policy in both parties, in both branches of government.
[03:50:44.900 --> 03:50:53.900]  You had virtually the entire conventional land forces capability of the United States militarily,
[03:50:53.900 --> 03:51:01.900]  mired in the Middle East for 15 years in order chiefly to hand over the main influence over Iraq to Iran,
[03:51:01.900 --> 03:51:03.900]  which is the last thing they wanted.
[03:51:03.900 --> 03:51:09.900]  It produced this humanitarian crisis where millions of desperate people were scrambling for their lives
[03:51:09.900 --> 03:51:13.900]  and turning up in the shores of Italy and into central Europe and so forth,
[03:51:13.900 --> 03:51:18.900]  all caused by utter incompetence in American policymaking.
[03:51:18.900 --> 03:51:27.900]  You had the decline of GDP per capita growth in the United States from 4.5% under Reagan,
[03:51:27.900 --> 03:51:32.900]  3.9% under Clinton, 2% under George W. Bush, 1% under Obama.
[03:51:32.900 --> 03:51:34.900]  The country was a pressure cooker.
[03:51:34.900 --> 03:51:35.900]  Poverty went up.
[03:51:35.900 --> 03:51:36.900]  Violence rose.
[03:51:36.900 --> 03:51:37.900]  Discontent rose.
[03:51:37.900 --> 03:51:41.900]  But our great national media in the United States didn't notice it.
[03:51:41.900 --> 03:51:43.900]  And Trump said it is all rotten.
[03:51:43.900 --> 03:51:44.900]  We've got to clean it all up.
[03:51:44.900 --> 03:51:50.900]  Wall Street, Hollywood, the national media, the lobbyists, campaign financing,
[03:51:50.900 --> 03:51:52.900]  all factions of both parties.
[03:51:52.900 --> 03:51:53.900]  They're all useless.
[03:51:53.900 --> 03:51:54.900]  We've got to get rid of them.
[03:51:54.900 --> 03:51:55.900]  And he's doing it.
[03:51:55.900 --> 03:51:56.900]  And it's a war.
[03:51:56.900 --> 03:51:57.900]  It's a war.
[03:51:57.900 --> 03:51:59.900]  And it's a war that he's winning right now.
[03:51:59.900 --> 03:52:03.900]  And that's why you see the desperation, the flailing hysteria from the left
[03:52:03.900 --> 03:52:05.900]  and this alarming uptick and violent rhetoric.
[03:52:05.900 --> 03:52:08.900]  That's Conrad Black, a former Bilderberg member,
[03:52:08.900 --> 03:52:12.900]  a former Bilderberg steering committee member laying it down the line
[03:52:12.900 --> 03:52:17.900]  and actually coming over to the right side and pointing out that Trump is at war
[03:52:17.900 --> 03:52:20.900]  with the deep state, with the establishment, and that he's winning.
[03:52:20.900 --> 03:52:25.900]  And so the resistance, as they call it, which is now openly inciting harassment,
[03:52:25.900 --> 03:52:28.900]  intimidation, and violent attacks, they're on the side of the deep state.
[03:52:28.900 --> 03:52:30.900]  They're on the side of the establishment.
[03:52:30.900 --> 03:52:32.900]  Trump represents the opposing force.
[03:52:32.900 --> 03:52:35.900]  So that's the narrative we've known to be true all along.
[03:52:35.900 --> 03:52:36.900]  That's what they've tried to hide.
[03:52:36.900 --> 03:52:38.900]  Now Conrad Black pointing out the truth.
[03:52:38.900 --> 03:52:40.900]  Again, I talked about it with Alex.
[03:52:40.900 --> 03:52:44.900]  A lot of the people who were globalists, to some extent 10 years ago,
[03:52:44.900 --> 03:52:48.900]  have now come across to the right side because people have chosen their side
[03:52:48.900 --> 03:52:51.900]  and many have chosen wisely.
[03:52:51.900 --> 03:52:54.900]  Let's move on to some global news now with the migrant crisis.
[03:52:54.900 --> 03:52:56.900]  This is out of RT.
[03:52:56.900 --> 03:53:01.900]  Headline helicopters, 100s of Austrian soldiers and police officers take part
[03:53:01.900 --> 03:53:03.900]  in migrant deterring drills.
[03:53:03.900 --> 03:53:08.900]  Hundreds of Austrian soldiers and police were involved in a border protection exercise
[03:53:08.900 --> 03:53:11.900]  that simulated containing migrants with fears that neighbouring Germany
[03:53:11.900 --> 03:53:14.900]  might begin to turn away new arrivals trying to cross their frontier.
[03:53:14.900 --> 03:53:18.900]  So again, we've seen this massive uptick in the migrant crisis.
[03:53:18.900 --> 03:53:20.900]  It's at least turning away the boats.
[03:53:20.900 --> 03:53:21.900]  They're now going to Spain.
[03:53:21.900 --> 03:53:22.900]  They're now going to France,
[03:53:22.900 --> 03:53:25.900]  or at least trying to get there after they've adopted in Spain.
[03:53:25.900 --> 03:53:29.900]  But now Austria have deployed 600 police, 400 soldiers,
[03:53:29.900 --> 03:53:33.900]  and two Black Hawk helicopters in an exercise which simulated arrival
[03:53:33.900 --> 03:53:37.900]  of hundreds of migrants on the country's border with Slovenia, local media reported.
[03:53:37.900 --> 03:53:42.900]  A state that in the worst case cannot protect its borders loses its credibility.
[03:53:42.900 --> 03:53:46.900]  Interior Minister Herbert Kickel of the far right, it says,
[03:53:46.900 --> 03:53:48.900]  freedom party told reporters.
[03:53:48.900 --> 03:53:51.900]  So again, they're expecting a new wave of migrants.
[03:53:51.900 --> 03:53:55.900]  Austria has made this pact with other central European countries
[03:53:55.900 --> 03:53:56.900]  to defend their borders.
[03:53:56.900 --> 03:54:00.900]  The German interior minister is also on board with that idea.
[03:54:00.900 --> 03:54:05.900]  Angela Merkel isn't as an internal civil war basically within the German coalition government
[03:54:05.900 --> 03:54:10.900]  now, which could lead to the end of Angela Merkel's political legacy.
[03:54:10.900 --> 03:54:12.900]  And Austria is ready.
[03:54:12.900 --> 03:54:13.900]  They're preparing for it.
[03:54:13.900 --> 03:54:14.900]  They're preparing for an invasion.
[03:54:14.900 --> 03:54:18.900]  We saw the Croatian border video a couple of days ago
[03:54:18.900 --> 03:54:22.900]  where they were chanting Alarakba trying to break down the border to get in there.
[03:54:22.900 --> 03:54:25.900]  So as soon as one route gets shut off, another opens,
[03:54:25.900 --> 03:54:29.900]  because we still have these turncoat governments that are betraying their people.
[03:54:29.900 --> 03:54:33.900]  They see the border situation in Croatia where they tried to break through
[03:54:33.900 --> 03:54:35.900]  while chanting Alarakba.
[03:54:35.900 --> 03:54:39.900]  But some countries are finally enforcing proper border security
[03:54:39.900 --> 03:54:44.900]  given the huge problems that this has caused in virtually every European country
[03:54:44.900 --> 03:54:46.900]  that's accepted migrants over the past few years.
[03:54:46.900 --> 03:54:51.900]  Because we had the Aquarius boat dock in Spain last week.
[03:54:51.900 --> 03:54:56.900]  Soon as the migrants were sent to their holding locations in a town called Alacante,
[03:54:56.900 --> 03:55:00.900]  the local population of students who had paid for their accommodation were told
[03:55:00.900 --> 03:55:03.900]  they had 12 hours to get the hell out of there.
[03:55:03.900 --> 03:55:06.900]  Get out, you're being replaced by these migrants.
[03:55:06.900 --> 03:55:07.900]  And that's that.
[03:55:07.900 --> 03:55:09.900]  We saw that in other countries.
[03:55:09.900 --> 03:55:12.900]  We saw the video out of Italy with the old bed and breakfast owner
[03:55:12.900 --> 03:55:14.900]  literally being almost turfed out of his own home,
[03:55:14.900 --> 03:55:18.900]  ordered by police to allow migrants to stay there against his will,
[03:55:18.900 --> 03:55:23.900]  literally requisitioning his property to place migrants in there.
[03:55:23.900 --> 03:55:27.900]  And what results do we see from that legacy over the past three years?
[03:55:27.900 --> 03:55:29.900]  Well, here's another headline.
[03:55:29.900 --> 03:55:34.900]  40-year-old migrant arrested for murdering his 16-year-old teen bride in Sweden.
[03:55:34.900 --> 03:55:37.900]  This was an Afghan migrant who was arrested in Iran.
[03:55:37.900 --> 03:55:38.900]  Again, he escaped.
[03:55:38.900 --> 03:55:41.900]  We saw that in Germany with the headline you just flashed up before
[03:55:41.900 --> 03:55:45.900]  about the 14-year-old girl being strangled, raped and murdered in Germany.
[03:55:45.900 --> 03:55:47.900]  He was an Iraqi migrant who escaped.
[03:55:47.900 --> 03:55:49.900]  They managed to get him back and charge him.
[03:55:49.900 --> 03:55:54.900]  Now an Afghan migrant has been arrested in Iran for murdering his teen bride in Sweden.
[03:55:54.900 --> 03:55:58.900]  It was an international arrest warrant against the man who was taken back to Sweden
[03:55:58.900 --> 03:56:01.900]  and will face trial for the murder committed in 2016.
[03:56:01.900 --> 03:56:05.900]  The 40-year-old man should have been married to the 16-year-old girl Swedish media say,
[03:56:05.900 --> 03:56:10.900]  in March 2016, the teen was murdered and her husband has been wanted since June that year.
[03:56:10.900 --> 03:56:14.900]  They found her remains buried in a wood.
[03:56:14.900 --> 03:56:21.900]  So yet another murder of a young teenage girl blamed on migrants in a major European country.
[03:56:21.900 --> 03:56:23.900]  Because we had the whole narrative last week about,
[03:56:23.900 --> 03:56:27.900]  oh, Trump's lying when he says that crime's risen in Germany.
[03:56:27.900 --> 03:56:31.900]  If you'd have put the word violent or if you'd have put the word migrant behind the word crime in that tweet,
[03:56:31.900 --> 03:56:33.900]  you would have been completely right.
[03:56:33.900 --> 03:56:37.900]  Because as Reuters admitted, as numerous of the big publications admitted,
[03:56:37.900 --> 03:56:41.900]  BBC admitted as you see there, the rise in violent crime,
[03:56:41.900 --> 03:56:44.900]  the rise in political crime in Germany as well,
[03:56:44.900 --> 03:56:46.900]  talking about attacks on Jewish people mainly,
[03:56:46.900 --> 03:56:51.900]  can largely, in some cases, 90% of it be attributed to migrants.
[03:56:51.900 --> 03:56:54.900]  That's why when Trump talks about Europe having huge problems,
[03:56:54.900 --> 03:56:58.900]  as a result of open borders, he's exactly right.
[03:56:58.900 --> 03:57:03.900]  Meanwhile in Italy, Italian Euroskeptic Coalition polling at nearly 60%,
[03:57:03.900 --> 03:57:08.900]  Italy's new Euroskeptic Anti-Mass Migration Coalition continues to enjoy large support.
[03:57:08.900 --> 03:57:12.900]  Now they've got up to 60% of the vote.
[03:57:12.900 --> 03:57:14.900]  This is the new coalition government.
[03:57:14.900 --> 03:57:17.900]  Liga alone were at 17% back in March.
[03:57:17.900 --> 03:57:19.900]  Now they're at 29%.
[03:57:19.900 --> 03:57:26.900]  They've almost doubled their support specifically as a result of Salvini enforcing proper border security,
[03:57:26.900 --> 03:57:30.900]  turning away these votes and making Italy great again.
[03:57:30.900 --> 03:57:35.900]  And that's what Donald Trump wants to follow with his legacy when it comes to the border.
[03:57:35.900 --> 03:57:37.900]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour coming up.
[03:57:37.900 --> 03:57:50.900]  War Room with Owen Shroyer, breaking news at Infowars.com. We'll be back.
