[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:32.800]  last week we had William Benny former technical director of the National
[00:32.800 --> 00:38.800]  Security Agency in studio with us for about an hour and a half that's basically at the
[00:38.800 --> 00:46.520]  top of the pyramid but coming up in the third hour we're going to have a guest on
[00:46.520 --> 00:54.040]  who was with us about a year ago who was at the bottom of the pyramid and that's a
[00:54.040 --> 00:58.600]  very important place to be because that's where the real rubber meets the road that's
[00:58.600 --> 01:02.720]  how Snowden was able to get so much because he was a quote contractor that had to have
[01:02.720 --> 01:07.320]  all the systems integrate together in and work and that's the data point that foreign
[01:07.320 --> 01:13.040]  governments corporations and others would actually try to get in through and then monitor
[01:13.040 --> 01:20.120]  not just private networks public networks but the NSA network you heard William Benny
[01:20.120 --> 01:25.320]  talk about the fact that they will not allow any monitoring of who goes on the NSA network
[01:25.320 --> 01:30.320]  I'm going to say that again they've got machine gun nest in minefields around NSA buildings
[01:30.320 --> 01:35.800]  as if the public would try to sneak over a fence and go in but they don't allow any
[01:35.800 --> 01:43.640]  monitoring of who goes on the network so data can be stolen and be wide open see all this
[01:43.640 --> 01:50.080]  national security is there to protect the globalist takedown of America that's not
[01:50.080 --> 01:54.400]  rhetoric that's what's happening in fact at about 6 a.m. this morning I was up reading
[01:54.400 --> 02:03.600]  Jade Helm news when I was reading a Houston Chronicle article titled covert warfare coming
[02:03.600 --> 02:10.720]  to Texas sparked some fears of federal takeover that attacks us and I knew what hit me like
[02:10.720 --> 02:17.880]  a ton of bricks but I hadn't really set it on here the drill the two state two month
[02:17.880 --> 02:26.600]  drill joint forces is about causing a stir and then a laying the fears and testing their
[02:26.600 --> 02:34.040]  psyops on the American people through the media I mean they admit in the document that
[02:34.040 --> 02:41.360]  it is to condition the public to accept the military presence I mean they quote in there
[02:41.360 --> 02:50.040]  that it's about working with local police and the general public that's not for overseas
[02:50.040 --> 02:55.840]  I've been to countless of these drills I've it's been declassified you heard callers where
[02:55.840 --> 03:03.920]  they'd be an army Ranger and they'd have them in DC just going around in EPA uniforms setting
[03:03.920 --> 03:10.560]  up sniper nest just to randomly simulate taking out Americans it was released in lawsuits
[03:10.560 --> 03:15.560]  the last year the two years before that the FBI had snipers in place to decapitate the
[03:15.560 --> 03:21.080]  leadership of Occupy Wall Street and it wasn't that they were even against Occupy Wall Street
[03:21.080 --> 03:29.080]  or for them is actually Obama funded and Soros run on record let's just say Obama run globalist
[03:29.080 --> 03:35.320]  run Soros funded it was about just seeing will the FBI snipers go out and train their
[03:35.320 --> 03:45.080]  beads on peaceful demonstrators under a martial law scenario to decapitate I mean let me explain
[03:45.080 --> 03:50.760]  something folks it's on a list tens of thousands Americans gender different scenarios that
[03:50.760 --> 03:56.600]  would be taken out and they've got large I mean we're talking 10,000 persons what I
[03:56.600 --> 04:02.560]  estimate hit team in the US where they will attach them with going out and killing someone
[04:02.560 --> 04:09.040]  every day for a month until everybody on the list is dead now once this starts it's not
[04:09.040 --> 04:12.880]  going to be easy the first few rounds it'll be easy to kill people and I'll guarantee
[04:12.880 --> 04:22.200]  I'm on the top of the list Ron Paul top of the list and it'll just be Alex Jones shot
[04:22.200 --> 04:27.160]  himself Ron Paul shot himself or Ron Paul died in a grease fire Ron Paul died in a car
[04:27.160 --> 04:30.640]  wreck Ron Paul got hit while riding bicycle I mean and you'll just suddenly all these
[04:30.640 --> 04:35.200]  people are dying and those conspiracy theorists think we're wiping people out we're not they've
[04:35.200 --> 04:40.720]  killed like 500 microbiologists now they've had them in Houston where they like run over
[04:40.720 --> 04:45.760]  the guy with a van and then back back over him at in the university in a 10-mile-an-hour
[04:45.760 --> 04:51.000]  speed zone and the police say no investigation not even a hit-and-run investigation they

[08:28.040 --> 08:35.880]  the nation on its ear and the shock that lexington heard around the world when the british fired
[08:35.880 --> 08:44.120]  in the early dawn the war of independence had begun the die was cast the rebel flag unfurled
[08:44.120 --> 08:50.200]  and on to concord march the pole to seize the arsenal there you know waiting folks searching
[08:50.200 --> 08:56.880]  all around till our militia stopped them in their tracks at the old north bridge we turned
[08:56.880 --> 09:03.880]  them back and chased those red posts back to boston town and the shocker around the world
[09:03.880 --> 09:12.520]  was the start of the revolution the big men were ready for all the moves take your powder

[09:20.240 --> 09:24.960]  that they had planned if the british was ever to come over here that they had put a light
[09:24.960 --> 09:31.360]  up in this high church steeple and paul went down there to look and showing up there was
[09:31.360 --> 09:37.760]  the light burning bright on day of paul he jumped on his old horse and he lit out he
[09:37.760 --> 09:41.680]  didn't know where he was going but he knew he had to go somewhere oh i wish you could
[09:41.680 --> 09:46.160]  have seen it that old horse with his ears laid back in his nostrils wide open the sucking
[09:46.160 --> 09:51.360]  in wind like a jet engine feet pounding on them cobblestones striking off sparks paul
[09:51.360 --> 09:55.680]  are holding on for dear life and are hollering at the top of his lungs he says the british
[09:55.680 --> 10:01.200]  is coming the british is coming get you a gun we gonna have us a revolution and them
[10:01.200 --> 10:06.840]  farmers come up piling out of the hay like beat out of beehive minute men there's called
[10:06.840 --> 10:11.760]  what's meant me minute men there's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice and
[10:11.760 --> 10:16.320]  when paul comes screeching down the road that way they grabbed their guns and hid out behind
[10:16.320 --> 10:22.320]  the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere and when the british come pranks and long haul
[10:22.320 --> 10:30.760]  dressed up and in their red suits they let them have it it was a sight to see and then
[10:30.760 --> 10:38.800]  it happened they fired the gun they fired the gun and the shot was so loud it was heard
[10:38.800 --> 10:53.880]  clear around the world oh get out that's the way this country started
[10:53.880 --> 10:59.880]  it started when the empire came out and openly said it was gonna disarm the people
[10:59.880 --> 11:08.240]  and that it was going to put unelected governors over the colonies and you look at what's in
[11:08.240 --> 11:14.800]  the declaration of independence the reasons for the rebellion against tyranny and we
[11:14.800 --> 11:22.320]  are living under far greater oppression today and the preparations for the complete annihilation
[11:22.320 --> 11:27.080]  of every check and every balance are being made and are being launched right now there
[11:27.080 --> 11:32.480]  are counter movements as well we're going to cover the good the bad and the ugly here
[11:32.480 --> 11:36.800]  that's the commitment you get from yours truly alex jones thank you so much for joining
[11:36.800 --> 11:50.840]  us on this live thursday the 26th day already of march 2015
[11:50.840 --> 11:58.240]  we have a telecom insider from the ground floor we talked to william benney at the top
[11:58.240 --> 12:01.640]  of the nsa and i want to talk to somebody at the bottom and when i say the bottom it's
[12:01.640 --> 12:06.640]  not really the bottom because sometimes the bottom's the top when it comes to actually
[12:06.640 --> 12:10.680]  being able to get into the infrastructure and know what's really there it's where the
[12:10.680 --> 12:17.120]  rubber meets the road is where you find reality we've had the whistleblower insider on before
[12:17.120 --> 12:24.800]  about a year ago he's going to be joining us coming up in the third hour james knots
[12:24.800 --> 12:32.440]  had been on this in over a year and of course he was breaking down the snowden grid the
[12:32.440 --> 12:37.280]  snowden documents that showed the infrastructure specifics we know about the technology and
[12:37.280 --> 12:43.000]  how it works but he was going over the specifics from the ground level and confirming and adding
[12:43.000 --> 12:48.800]  to the information we had from the first snowden major data dump will also get his take on
[12:48.800 --> 12:52.000]  what he thinks snowden's talking about when he says he may release information that will
[12:52.000 --> 12:57.200]  bring down western governments i don't know they've psychologically inoculated this where
[12:57.200 --> 13:01.400]  we pretty much accept anything they could come out and say that the president's molesting
[13:01.400 --> 13:07.240]  children and the trendies wouldn't care we've really become a broken nation where we'll
[13:07.240 --> 13:12.920]  accept anything and i say that very sadly we have to find our conscience find our dignity
[13:12.920 --> 13:20.000]  again and start to stand up against the incredible dehumanization there's so much unbelievable
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.360]  news and i'm going to go over all of it today it's it's just over the top but first i wanted
[13:26.360 --> 13:34.880]  to mention an article out of biz pack review uber liberal cosmopolitan magazine just admitted
[13:34.880 --> 13:39.720]  babies can feel in the womb in a twist of irony cosmopolitan magazine told his readers
[13:39.720 --> 13:49.200]  babies can feel in the womb
[13:49.200 --> 13:54.400]  and it was showing babies jolt awake and get high off the stimulant that is cigarettes
[13:54.400 --> 14:00.720]  that is the poison nicotine and they were lecturing women not to smoke because you got
[14:00.720 --> 14:03.960]  to carry your baby well what about there's so many ironies here i'm going to go over
[14:03.960 --> 14:11.920]  my perspective a you're not supposed to give pregnant women vaccines until five years ago
[14:11.920 --> 14:15.960]  now they claim it's wonderful that you should quote take extra when they know it causes
[14:15.960 --> 14:19.920]  miscarriages and deformities and all sorts of other problems but then they say oh pregnant
[14:19.920 --> 14:23.000]  women get your shots well then pregnant women smoke five packs of cigarettes and drink a
[14:23.000 --> 14:29.520]  gallon of whiskey to must be good for you know it's not but the larger issue here is
[14:29.520 --> 14:37.840]  they show these three d ultrasounds that by the way different states are trying to ban
[14:37.840 --> 14:44.240]  california and others they don't want you to see these this is what's killing abortion
[14:44.240 --> 14:47.760]  is the three d images of the babies when you go and get an ultrasound now they don't give
[14:47.760 --> 14:54.640]  you a super high death one because there might be something quote wrong and you might want
[14:54.640 --> 14:59.880]  to terminate i've got friends that have recently gone into have ultrasounds at the nicest hospital
[14:59.880 --> 15:09.920]  in austin when i had children years ago just six years ago of our last child they showed
[15:09.920 --> 15:15.440]  us low res and i said why they went well uh well i know why and i checked out the machine
[15:15.440 --> 15:21.480]  they had they could turn it up and have it be three d but they don't want to humanize
[15:21.480 --> 15:26.960]  the ultrasound they want it all black and white and gray or you can barely make out the sex
[15:26.960 --> 15:32.160]  and barely that's because that's a window into social engineering you know why i get
[15:32.160 --> 15:37.480]  a headache doing the show almost every day now because i look at one article and a hundred
[15:37.480 --> 15:42.600]  data points go out first i think of four or five angles then i think of 20 angles then
[15:42.600 --> 15:47.000]  a hundred angles and then the headache hits because you can take one article understand
[15:47.000 --> 15:57.240]  the whole world propaganda disinformation manipulation all of it so i see something like the cosmopolitan
[15:57.240 --> 16:04.360]  article and i get a headache you want to hear some of the other angles i see in this why
[16:04.360 --> 16:09.880]  are we calling them liberals because oh they say babies might feel oh they're the liberal
[16:09.880 --> 16:14.480]  authorities that we all listen to that condescend to us and lecture us all day and tell us what
[16:14.480 --> 16:18.680]  language to use and how to act and who associate with and what our school kids are gonna eat
[16:18.680 --> 16:28.520]  in school and wow they they admit babies can feel how sweet of them why hitler was nice
[16:28.520 --> 16:38.360]  to his german shepherd blondie don't write cuss words on your airplane but drop napalm
[16:38.360 --> 16:45.880]  on villages it's the same deal it's mental illness and they know what they're doing they're
[16:45.880 --> 16:51.080]  teaching people mental illness viruses much of mental illness is not genetic or chemical
[16:51.080 --> 16:57.080]  or even you know you know nature it it is nurture they are teaching people how to be
[16:57.080 --> 17:10.880]  mentally ill it is mental illness to obsess all day over sexual preferences and over is
[17:10.880 --> 17:14.920]  someone racist and let's have a discussion about race when you buy coffee that is meant
[17:14.920 --> 17:20.080]  to create a totally confused ship of people fighting with each other a total tower of
[17:20.080 --> 17:26.920]  babel anybody knows that you go in your office this is an office of like 40 something people
[17:26.920 --> 17:32.240]  then some of the folks work outside the office I've learned over the years anybody likes
[17:32.240 --> 17:36.720]  to gossip and start up trouble I just gotta get rid of them because that's what they do
[17:36.720 --> 17:40.480]  that's their little mental illness they go in circles their whole life chasing their
[17:40.480 --> 17:45.080]  tail never trying to build something or do something or affect the outside they don't
[17:45.080 --> 17:50.360]  have missions their missions are screwing with everyone we've all run into those people
[17:50.360 --> 17:59.760]  that's what the social engineers are because they want us all to be failures they want
[17:59.760 --> 18:06.920]  us all to have chips on our shoulders and imagine things that aren't there and be filled
[18:06.920 --> 18:12.080]  with all these mindless anxieties that aren't connected to any real threat while the real
[18:12.080 --> 18:18.800]  threat is we're being conquered by a technocratic elite establishing world government writing
[18:18.800 --> 18:25.000]  hundreds of articles a week thousands of books over the years thousands of documents admitting
[18:25.000 --> 18:36.280]  the world government they're going to build that is a hell hole for the average person
[18:36.280 --> 18:40.040]  it's going to be so bad you're going to wish you were dead unless you're in one of the
[18:40.040 --> 18:43.600]  high-tech pleasure cities and you're going to be bombed out of your brain on entertainment
[18:43.600 --> 18:49.440]  and drugs and it's all just ushering humanity out the door like aliens from Alpha Centuries
[18:49.440 --> 18:54.320]  landed and set all this up I mean it's that evil that's sophisticated the elite might
[18:54.320 --> 18:59.520]  as well be as I've said enemy aliens shape shifters like David Ike says and I don't really
[18:59.520 --> 19:05.960]  believe that the point is the allegory still stands it might as well be that because that's
[19:05.960 --> 19:15.360]  what they are is anti-human snakes we have a report coming up BBC less tolerant of climate
[19:15.360 --> 19:21.000]  skeptics than pedophiles yeah well that they're they're rolling out the pedophiles so that's
[19:21.000 --> 19:27.520]  where we stand as a society and as a civilization and I can keep going now I'm done talking
[19:27.520 --> 19:31.520]  about that what are we going to hit today there's some good news house effort would completely
[19:31.520 --> 19:37.840]  dismantle Patriot Act globalist will just blow some more buildings up to get us to go
[19:37.840 --> 19:42.520]  along with it Russia has constructed massive underground shelters anticipation of nuclear
[19:42.520 --> 19:51.200]  war one of them the Pentagon says is 400 square miles we're going to get into the economy
[19:51.200 --> 19:55.560]  the latest on Jade Helm and more you do not want to miss this transmission I am focused

[23:55.560 --> 24:11.880]  we are on the march the empires on the run but they're fleeing forward let me give you
[24:11.880 --> 24:16.960]  the headlines then we're gonna burrow into all of them tornadoes hit Oklahoma Arkansas
[24:16.960 --> 24:24.160]  one dead several injured look at this insane headline US officials military worries about
[24:24.160 --> 24:30.200]  easing transgender ban another article second graders taken on field trip given sex kits
[24:30.200 --> 24:35.440]  lube and condoms if somebody gave that to your kid in the backyard they'd go to jail
[24:35.440 --> 24:43.480]  for pedophilia or soliciting it but the government doesn't it's okay again I don't hate men
[24:43.480 --> 24:46.840]  that think they're women they're women that think they're men they've gone in and done
[24:46.840 --> 24:51.920]  you know studies on them as another man has a female brain that stuff happens naturally
[24:51.920 --> 24:56.360]  but they're pushing it is like an option on the menu now where you know you go to the
[24:56.360 --> 25:03.120]  thing and it has beef chicken pork and fish and then now you go and there's an eater on
[25:03.120 --> 25:08.640]  the menu nothing against aunt eaters but the aunt eaters aren't usually on the menu they're
[25:08.640 --> 25:15.600]  there they're pushing it kind of like they've overfished the ocean so they push tilapia
[25:15.600 --> 25:19.800]  on the menu you know at every restaurant you go to like it's some fine fish tastes fine
[25:19.800 --> 25:24.800]  I'm just saying they are pushing this stuff because they don't want you having kids and
[25:24.800 --> 25:29.080]  they don't want families so at the end of the day it's an anti-human operation if you
[25:29.080 --> 25:33.720]  were space aliens brought here you'd add stuff to the water in a long-term program demonize
[25:33.720 --> 25:38.200]  the family to break it up and demonize having children to begin phasing out the humans so
[25:38.200 --> 25:44.600]  again that's the alien agenda I'm not saying it's aliens I am transcending the debate and
[25:44.600 --> 25:49.800]  going this is what aliens would do you start thinking about it that way you're like my
[25:49.800 --> 25:54.400]  god I see the whole attack the elites are a predator class who see themselves as a new
[25:54.400 --> 26:00.800]  species BBC look it up and within breeding and things they are a new species they have
[26:00.800 --> 26:05.160]  a whole nother strand of mutated DNA you look at the British royalty and others just like
[26:05.160 --> 26:10.760]  a inbred breed of dog will be really smart sometimes but really weird have all sorts
[26:10.760 --> 26:18.960]  of disorders and do mean weird things like Siamese cats we are Siamese if you please

[34:20.440 --> 34:28.760]  and pacification meanwhile Jade Helm troops who operate undetected amongst civilian population
[34:28.760 --> 34:32.080]  and of course the military people and the vets are not buying any of they're not stupid

[34:48.120 --> 34:52.880]  disposal you'll quote the army is going to show up to defuse a bomb but then you get
[34:52.880 --> 34:58.040]  the internal agreements it's for everything from warrants service to checkpoints with
[34:58.040 --> 35:05.120]  military personnel in nondescript blue jumpsuits just like the army ranger called in and said
[35:05.120 --> 35:11.400]  they were wearing EPA blue jumpsuits it's always blue or tan jumpsuits and it might
[35:11.400 --> 35:20.920]  say EPA it might say police it might say park service I mean I've videotaped Delta force
[35:20.920 --> 35:28.040]  in these outfits and then they sent a guy in uniform over to put a gun to Mike Hansen's
[35:28.040 --> 35:33.880]  chest and head on the ground in San Antonio after we'd had the police chief already thrown
[35:33.880 --> 35:38.560]  him out they still came in and then they put Hansen wouldn't give him the video camera
[35:38.560 --> 35:46.560]  with the tape in it back when we had tape and they took it erased it and gave it back
[35:46.560 --> 35:53.000]  you know pulled the gun out stuck it up to him oh nothing's going on no no they're just
[35:53.000 --> 35:58.680]  simulating killing and assassinating Americans in these stinking drills and they're going
[35:58.680 --> 36:03.080]  to have some quote drills where they'll chase a guy with a big turban on his head and a
[36:03.080 --> 36:07.280]  gun I've been to those two and they'll have that on the news crazy Alex Jones says they're
[36:07.280 --> 36:15.000]  getting up for a takeover anti-American piece of trash but here's the video as they practice
[36:15.000 --> 36:23.720]  Jake chasing Durkan Durkan Muhammad Jihad aka Team America folks training with the police
[36:23.720 --> 36:28.480]  training with locals in plain clothes quote doing suspicious activities is to train the
[36:28.480 --> 36:32.280]  police to work with the military and covert operations and to condition the military
[36:32.280 --> 36:36.320]  to accept it and to condition the public to accept it and then when we cover it and talk
[36:36.320 --> 36:41.620]  about it they practice the Psyop in real time putting out this information I can see the
[36:41.620 --> 36:47.880]  script from Army Times to military dot com to Stars and Stripes to Bloomberg to Daily
[36:47.880 --> 36:59.440]  Beast to Vice to the Houston Chronicle and no exaggeration today you go search Jade Helm
[36:59.440 --> 37:04.280]  there are now hundreds of articles and in almost all of them yours truly is being demonized
[37:04.280 --> 37:10.160]  Jones who's warned of an imminent takeover for decades I'm going to read the quotes keeps
[37:10.160 --> 37:15.760]  claiming it's going to happen but of course it never does no it never does checkpoints
[37:15.760 --> 37:23.120]  TSA open spying highway dividers being put up nationwide open manuals that the number
[37:23.120 --> 37:30.000]  one enemies veterans and gun owners and Christians I mean come on this is the Psyop and I guess
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.560]  no babies were aborted either and I guess if you like your doctor you can keep your
[37:34.560 --> 37:47.200]  doctor and it's going to cut your bill in half and two plus two equals five no it doesn't
[37:47.200 --> 37:52.320]  makes me sick you guys are showing news from a web search that's good but you can also show
[37:52.320 --> 38:02.800]  it is stars and stripes all of it click news you can really see all the articles and it's
[38:02.800 --> 38:09.160]  just so frustrating to read the Houston Chronicle one because it's just gives me a headache
[38:09.160 --> 38:14.480]  it gives me a headache that they're praying on the Houston readers that's the biggest
[38:14.480 --> 38:23.000]  paper in south Texas it's the paper to 10 million Texans 7 million up in Houston 2 million
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.080]  people probably read that stinking article and what's your family down there that makes
[38:27.080 --> 38:32.440]  it and I don't mind them making it look like I'm a liar it's that they are dishonorable
[38:32.440 --> 38:39.600]  and they know full well what they're doing they're giant steaming piles of trader is evil
[38:39.600 --> 38:42.800]  and I just am tired of looking at them I mean I'll be quite frank with you I'm not even
[38:42.800 --> 38:48.840]  scared of dying I'm not scared to fight these people I'm sick of it I am sick of looking
[38:48.840 --> 39:00.960]  at miserable scum all you fools in the mainstream media who've had your pay cut most of you lost
[39:00.960 --> 39:06.800]  your jobs and you still sycophantically run around groveling to the lies any idiot could

[39:10.960 --> 39:15.800]  national police force and then and and the brigades they're setting up because they'll
[39:15.800 --> 39:21.880]  admit it out on one side of their mouth and then deny it out of the other like let me
[39:21.880 --> 39:27.240]  just I'm going to get into the price of ground beef was doubled to 2008 that's your real inflation
[39:27.240 --> 39:31.360]  huge article that's so important next hour Russia has constructed massive underground
[39:31.360 --> 39:36.000]  shelters and anticipation nuclear war 400 square miles this is a story that has hundreds
[39:36.000 --> 39:44.000]  of data points ties into everything gives me a huge headache to even look at it I'm
[39:44.000 --> 39:49.980]  not kidding I'm like a computer with smoke coming out of tears FBI figures tweak the
[39:49.980 --> 39:57.360]  show phony increases in mass shootings yeah we actually have statisticians that volunteer
[39:57.360 --> 40:03.880]  their work professors people like that and a lot of them want to come on air Rob do's
[40:03.880 --> 40:10.040]  brothers the statistician and a professor no phd becoming a professor and they basically
[40:10.040 --> 40:15.200]  threatened his professor job if he ever came on the show again so we have we have other
[40:15.200 --> 40:18.840]  statisticians and then they analyze the stuff and don't come on air because they'll lose
[40:18.840 --> 40:24.440]  their university job because the country's so free it's so free that they'll run them
[40:24.440 --> 40:31.800]  out of the university if they dare analyze stuff the country's so free and there's no
[40:31.800 --> 40:38.040]  police state they're just banning pro-gun groups and marches in student groups all over the
[40:38.040 --> 40:48.520]  state and all over the country but we reported two years ago when the 20 year FBI numbers
[40:48.520 --> 40:59.960]  came out from 92 to 2012 and there was a 51% overall drop in guns being used in crimes
[40:59.960 --> 41:06.200]  but mass shootings had gone up a little bit and then we noticed right there on the statistician
[41:06.200 --> 41:10.520]  we were talking to point out you notice they've added certain classes of gang violence into
[41:10.520 --> 41:19.440]  mass shooting now so if you take those out it's actually gone down but overall six in
[41:19.440 --> 41:27.920]  2013 alone there were 67 people killed in quote school shootings period the memory service
[41:27.920 --> 41:32.480]  I think 40 something were mass shootings and most of that was gangs shooting each other
[41:32.480 --> 41:40.920]  and that's if you use the phony baloney new haven stuff but this is Fox News of course
[41:40.920 --> 41:54.800]  they did that but let's go ahead and analyze this piece of this information and you notice
[41:54.800 --> 42:00.880]  you read this you go read all the others it's the same article scrambled we ought to even
[42:00.880 --> 42:07.760]  check and see if Dylan bad or is a human or he's a CIA bot you think I'm joking I don't
[42:07.760 --> 42:13.200]  really think Dylan's a CIA bot but a CIA bot could have written this I knew about 10 years
[42:13.200 --> 42:17.760]  ago they had government bots actually writing articles where they put in the disinfo and
[42:17.760 --> 42:22.840]  then it scrambles it makes it look like a person wrote it and then puts a fake gnome to plume
[42:22.840 --> 42:28.600]  pen name for the robot program on it you don't believe that just type CIA developing fake
[42:28.600 --> 42:34.600]  journalist computers to write news and it was declassified four years ago but we knew
[42:34.600 --> 42:41.440]  about six years before but these things misbehave more delicately so humans wrote the stars
[42:41.440 --> 42:47.520]  and stripes and the army times disinfo and then other humans just scramble it but not
[42:47.520 --> 42:51.840]  for long these people will be replaced with bots soon enough just as they've announced
[42:51.840 --> 42:55.680]  they're getting rid of a White House press conferences soon you know the standard daily
[42:55.680 --> 42:58.960]  ones just they're just going to have an announcement in their own video department and that's it
[42:58.960 --> 43:03.100]  no no questions because they already pre-screen them but sometimes reporters want to be rock
[43:03.100 --> 43:07.680]  stars and actually ask a real question because that's the paradox you ask real questions
[43:07.680 --> 43:12.240]  you get famous and successful and make money people want that but you can't do it or they'll
[43:12.240 --> 43:17.200]  fire you so it's a paradox kind of like this show everywhere we end up being on the air
[43:17.200 --> 43:21.400]  and gets high ratings mom and pop stations end up beating the big juggernauts and we
[43:21.400 --> 43:26.240]  get taken off the air for having a race car that's 400 horsepower beating 600 horsepower
[43:26.240 --> 43:36.560]  race cars we beat them and so they go oh you can't be on the racetrack from New York to
[43:36.560 --> 43:41.200]  Florida from California it's happened over and over again just destroy Rush Limbaugh
[43:41.200 --> 43:48.000]  the response is taking off the air ESPN always comes and buys the station always covert warfare
[43:48.000 --> 43:53.160]  coming to Texas sparks some fears like that's an industry inside joke that you put my show
[43:53.160 --> 44:00.360]  on for a year to up your ratings and sell your station anyways covert warfare coming
[44:00.360 --> 44:07.800]  to Texas sparks some fears of federal takeover some fears so they write it to get you to
[44:07.800 --> 44:12.280]  read it because they want to bury something they give it a boring headline but oh my gosh
[44:12.280 --> 44:17.520]  federal takeover other than that's not happening this map from an army slideshow see first
[44:17.520 --> 44:21.960]  they denied it was real a week ago week and a half ago then they said oh it's we're not
[44:21.960 --> 44:27.200]  sure if it's totally real Jones may have added stuff and then okay it's real so first it's
[44:27.200 --> 44:32.160]  just oh we're not sure that's real oh we're not sure we're not sure we're not sure there's
[44:32.160 --> 44:40.160]  death panels okay yeah there are okay just creeping around like evil Siamese cats this
[44:40.160 --> 44:47.200]  map from an army slideshow explaining Operation Jade Helm frightened some with its designation
[44:47.200 --> 44:53.720]  of Texas is a hostile territory frightened some and this was all meant to come out we've
[44:53.720 --> 44:58.040]  been they've called us into you know told Joe yeah it's a Psyop shut up you can't do
[44:58.040 --> 45:05.440]  nothing yeah okay we can't do nothing resistance is futile the board will absorb you Texas stirred
[45:05.440 --> 45:11.240]  some ultra right wing fears ultra right wing you know I want fourth amendment second amendment
[45:11.240 --> 45:17.720]  tenth amendment low taxes horrible stuff the country was founded on horrible prosperity
[45:17.720 --> 45:29.040]  producing common sense mom and apple pie Ford and Chevy John Wayne bad stuff really bad
[45:29.040 --> 45:38.440]  stuff Texas stirred some ultra right wing fears of a government takeover I don't know
[45:38.440 --> 45:42.520]  I mean two years ago the legislature passed along the house did not let TSA grow up children
[45:42.520 --> 45:49.080]  and they threatened a air blockade of I mean mostly you show feds threatened to block air
[45:49.080 --> 45:54.680]  travel into Texas over TSA bill I mean show them I mean we're not playing all that but
[45:54.680 --> 45:59.520]  nothing's happening they're just shut down a three billion dollar power plant in south
[45:59.520 --> 46:03.560]  Texas that was finished built that would have cut our power prices instead they've gone up
[46:03.560 --> 46:08.080]  there's nothing go outside of a law there was no law the borders being open there was
[46:08.080 --> 46:18.160]  no law on the bullet band none of it but there's nothing happening folks just go to sleep
[46:18.160 --> 46:26.560]  lay down America these aren't the droids you're looking for move along Operation Jade Helm
[46:26.560 --> 46:31.360]  will bring a coalition of forces including Green Beret Seals and special operations
[46:31.360 --> 46:35.840]  commands from the Air Force and Marines of Texas for two months of realistic military
[46:35.840 --> 46:41.520]  training in a simulated hostile territory between July and September this summer and
[46:41.520 --> 46:45.880]  it's in towns they've already announced like 18 towns have said where we're signed on as
[46:45.880 --> 46:53.240]  of last night and you're gonna see the newscast all preplanned Alex Jones as his credited
[46:53.240 --> 46:57.920]  here the military practice decontamination in case of a chemical attack and this army
[46:57.920 --> 47:03.840]  unit helped diffuse a mock bomb Jones you damn traitor look at how discredited you

[47:08.240 --> 47:13.760]  I'm sick of it I have had special forces jumped out of the bushes and set fires and try to
[47:13.760 --> 47:18.280]  blame it on me I had them pull guns on me because these are the scum that'll do these
[47:18.280 --> 47:22.280]  domestic operations all the guys that would deal the drugs all the guys would be involved
[47:22.280 --> 47:26.640]  in the corrupt garbage they're gonna use the larger operation as their operation to roll
[47:26.640 --> 47:32.880]  in with bags of money like they've done in third world countries to buy off the cities
[47:32.880 --> 47:40.080]  that's what these drills are really all about is cash small town mayors get 50 to 100 grand
[47:40.080 --> 47:46.680]  big city mayors get a million police chiefs get 200,000 and they give a little department

[54:28.680 --> 54:36.040]  so ultra right wing they're so bad they like the founding fathers they're so bad they like
[54:36.040 --> 54:41.640]  a group of rag tag people that beat the biggest empire in the world that had never been defeated
[54:41.640 --> 54:46.760]  they actually reversed a lot of tyranny and created prosperity and believe in the individual
[54:46.760 --> 54:55.320]  how sick how sick Texas stirred some ultra right wing fears of government takeover in
[54:55.320 --> 55:02.400]  the Lone Star state but local law enforcement say they've long been aware of the drill so
[55:02.400 --> 55:09.040]  see it's like oh we knew it's not a takeover we knew that's the whole point collaborator
[55:09.040 --> 55:15.160]  is you're being taught with reasonable missions up front and then it turns into gun confiscation
[55:15.160 --> 55:26.440]  later I was in the Travis County SWAT team office in 1998 and was shown by then Lieutenant
[55:26.440 --> 55:30.560]  Beck who they basically fired over it he was sort of working at the airport after that
[55:30.560 --> 55:36.200]  Vietnam veteran I told him Delta Force is coming to pay you off six months later he
[55:36.200 --> 55:39.720]  calls this police come office here's their card here's the name how the hell did you
[55:39.720 --> 55:43.720]  know this and I said do you think I came here to make all this up I've already interviewed
[55:43.720 --> 55:48.600]  the San Antonio police chief emergency managers he says I just thought you were making it up
[55:48.600 --> 55:54.000]  that because the SWAT team actually came over to the Travis County court where I was yelling
[55:54.000 --> 56:00.640]  at them when they were laughing at me and then said listen we lock your show why don't
[56:00.640 --> 56:03.360]  you quit threatening everybody because they were right next door then why don't you come
[56:03.360 --> 56:07.600]  on over have a coffee Alex you know we we know the government didn't perfect we're not bad
[56:07.600 --> 56:12.160]  you trust us and there they had you know Oklahoma City cover up videos and everything they're
[56:12.160 --> 56:18.280]  like we know what's going on but the Delta Force didn't come in and is ridiculous all
[56:18.280 --> 56:24.200]  sudden later how do you know that the Delta Force came in here with a bunch of money and
[56:24.200 --> 56:27.560]  of course they didn't take it so then they use some political correctness to get rid
[56:27.560 --> 56:34.920]  of him claiming that he later somebody said he might not have said a bad word or something
[56:34.920 --> 56:39.280]  that's how all this works ladies and gentlemen that's just one little story of hundreds
[56:39.280 --> 56:44.920]  that I've experienced with this and then I get to read the news article oh Jones says
[56:44.920 --> 56:49.440]  it's an imminent secret takeover but the police know I didn't say it was imminent I didn't
[56:49.440 --> 56:54.040]  say it was secret I said it's a long term strategic ran corporation plan and I provided
[56:54.040 --> 56:58.720]  in all the articles the document with a whole bunch of other proofs so that again they prey
[56:58.720 --> 57:02.560]  on their viewers and readers ignorance and I don't have time to get to all of it I got
[57:02.560 --> 57:07.240]  a bunch of the news I want to hit the Russian bunkers the beef prices the FBI covering up
[57:07.240 --> 57:11.240]  crowns districts but here's part of the clip the first part to cut off she says martial
[57:11.240 --> 57:14.680]  law be here part of it she says will martial law ever become a reality this was aired in

[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:15.600]  media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:26.080]  radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones you notice the last hour I didn't
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:32.160]  get into the whole air crash over in Europe with the German wings pilot I saw our commenter
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.840]  speculating yesterday that it would be a radical Islamist or something crashing it on purpose
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:43.440]  but they said it was a depressed mentally ill pilot 28 year old here's the deal stuff
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.800]  like this can happen I'm not saying it's fake but with these lying governments who knows
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.720]  if any of us true I mean I just you that's when you have a discredited known liars and
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:56.440]  the EU lies even more than the US I mean it's just it's it's hard to say they top it but
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:02.560]  they do the EU bureaucrats publicly have Swiss bank accounts and don't pay taxes and exempt
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:07.120]  themselves and in the countries where it's illegal they still do it while raising taxes
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:13.720]  the 101% I kept saying 100% it was a 101% on middle class just to bankrupt you I mean
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:18.760]  it's it's it's called see it's called takeover but the co-pilot deliberately crash plane
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:23.000]  they've been saying and I mean I'll give you my angle on that it's going to be all pushed
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.320]  to have overrides from the tower so that they can remote control them well here's the deal
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:31.480]  all the new aircrafts already have the remote control and they don't like the public knowing
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.480]  about that but it's actually in all the industry publications in both the aircraft that hit
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:42.080]  the world trade centers on 9-11 had remote control on them people are also pointing
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:46.320]  out the plane almost completely disintegrated saying hey that show shanks filled it could
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:50.560]  have gone into a hole and that shows the Pentagon actually the news has been showing
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:58.160]  kind of the end of the crash there are big chunks of the plane big chunks of the plane
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.920]  but it does look a little bit like the other but if you look at the top there's big old
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:13.280]  chunks so whatever it's just that to say that questioning known liars isn't reasonable you're
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:20.320]  supposed to question known liars I mean if somebody lies to me one time their suspect
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:27.400]  I catch him lying to me twice they're gone in my life I mean unless it's something like
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:37.840]  lying about food being good or telling a woman something looks good I mean I don't know any
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:42.280]  women that actually wanted to be told what something they're wearing looks like you just
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:47.680]  got to tell them that looks better does this look nice well yeah I don't know if it's really
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:54.080]  proper for this event but I mean I I always ask people how's this look because I want
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:03:02.240]  to know you know whatever I got really angry this morning reading the Houston Chronicle
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:10.600]  and then it just blew my whole day I I may go taking your management or something I know
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:13.440]  it's part of the show people like it and the ratings go up when I blow up and stuff but
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:25.920]  it's not an act okay I have to control myself not to push this desk over all the time we're

[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:50.160]  during the state of emergency following hurricane katrina in new orleans u.s. troops also arrived
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:56.040]  something far easier to do even now thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 posi

[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:13.200]  quelling dissent would be critical and that's exactly what the clergy response team as it's
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:18.320]  called helped accomplish in new orleans the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:22.200]  walk and get this thing over with and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:27.520]  is over such clergy response teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:32.680]  versus the wishes of the public in a lot of cases these clergy would already be known in
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:37.520]  the neighborhoods in which they're helping to diffuse that situation for the clergy one
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:42.920]  of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public down or obey the law
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:48.920]  is the bible itself specifically romans romans 13 because the government is established by
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:53.960]  the law you know and that's what we believe in the christian faith you know scripture
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:59.400]  civil rights advocates believe the amount of public cooperation may depend largely on how
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:06.240]  long they expect a suspension of their rights might last jeff ferrell ksla news 12 reported
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:11.040]  according to tuberville during hurricane katrina the clergy response team provided 38 chaplains
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:16.800]  a day around the clock at eight different camps oh the camps hillary says we need fun
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:23.000]  camps and they've aired pieces like that around the country going yet during marshal law you
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.460]  know we're gonna need you to go to the camps take the shots turn your guns in it's of the
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:32.200]  lord romans 13 hitler's favorite passage out of context we've had pastors on historians
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:37.760]  on constitutional lawyers on it's we the people so we're the rightful government and the bill
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:42.400]  of rights and constitution so even if you believe the distorted interpretation of romans 13
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:46.000]  you're violating it when you violate the bill of rights and constitution declaration of

[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:25.360]  that a year ago when they had trips for months in east st louis rolling around and helping
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:31.840]  the police arrest people or in chicago where they've had governor governors call for trips
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:38.480]  on the streets and they have them now or new york this is the acclamation when they have
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:42.960]  the national guard with an m16 in the airport a real terrorist would go into the airport
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:47.280]  to the checkpoint and blow up the checkpoint like they do in israel that's the target the

[01:14:54.400 --> 01:15:01.480]  pilot that's going to crash a plane or from a crazy person but they use these nebulous
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:09.200]  rare threats to push this total takeover when it's the takeover itself that's the threat
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:14.920]  i'm gonna say this very slowly almost every dentist and oral surgeon and medical doctor
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:23.320]  my dad knows two years ago homeland security came to him one of his patients said i'd like
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.200]  you to come to a meeting and you can even get paid to be part of it want you to be part
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:33.040]  of basically infregard under homeland security first it was like ceo's and power plant managers
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:40.760]  and you know folks that might actually need to be part of that and he said are they setting
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.680]  me up and i said no they're so ignorant they probably don't even know that you're my dad
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:48.800]  that's how lazy they are i bet they're recruiting a bunch of other dentists because i knew they
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.840]  were at the time all of the country and he made some calls and found out almost everyone
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:58.480]  had either had the visit or signed on the older dentist all were like what is this soviet
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:04.200]  russia because they'd say what do you want me to look for like islamicist or or you
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:09.800]  know or like a make they type that's incredibly rare and they're like no we want to know what
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:14.800]  people are thinking and saying i want you to help influence you know it's just helping
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:19.320]  in the community no it's it's secret cores of propagandists and spies who once they find
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:23.840]  out you're pliable it's expanded i'm gonna say this again it we got it in the associated
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:32.080]  press after i interviewed the chief police of santonia and thomas sanchez and others
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:36.040]  that the delta force and other people were doing it as well that the the navy was doing
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:41.760]  it as well not just army the delta force serves the president and his army and navy
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:45.760]  and it's in marines a joint group as you know people that have been recruited into it but
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:50.880]  they do the really dirty stuff used to they go and pay people off in third world countries
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:56.040]  and do assassinations and things and so-called rescues a rescue mission is their cover you
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:01.320]  know the fbi hostage rescue team is a group of assassins folks that's not the hostage
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:06.120]  rescue team and the delta force is in a hostage hostage rescue team sure they did that failed
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:11.360]  thing in iran which was a setup and i'm not saying delta force hasn't done a lot of good
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:20.360]  work as well but large wings or is they call them squadrons of delta force are involved
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:26.640]  in domestic takeover training and compromising cities and counties and paying off i mean
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:31.480]  you gotta hand it to them they'll come in they use the uniform to sell it they'll come
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:37.360]  in and they're playing closer in their army uniform here comes the colonel with the two
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.440]  delta force guys with him and says we just like you to work with us and for doing that
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:47.440]  we'd like to give you two hundred thousand dollars keep it yourself or give it to a charity
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:52.440]  and the and think about it most people in the cities took the money and they go no no
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:55.840]  no that'd be bribery or what do you mean well well just to show that you're a friend we
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:05.200]  want you to take it and i know i keep harping on this folks it's not my opinion that there
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:11.600]  are military takeover drills going on it's not my opinion it's a fact and this is the
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:17.360]  biggest 10 state it was a 10 state operation ever they said they're going to be doing quote
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:22.040]  suspicious things they say it's to gain the hearts and minds read it of the american
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:32.400]  people and create relationships with the local authorities this is i guarantee you they're
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:37.640]  going to have big chest of money they are that corrupt and that arrogant they don't
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.360]  even care that i've blown their operation repeatedly i guess they do care i mean that's
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:46.760]  why they tried to set fires in brooksville florida and again my kansas was there with

[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:15.200]  of my 18 years because I didn't know about this for about two years on air until I was
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:23.000]  told by military active duty marine captains army colonels police chiefs many of them on
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.520]  air people who just got now they're like you know we're training for gun confiscation
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:32.040]  and then I would talk about it and then I would get contacted by emergency managers
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:39.800]  the 700 club even had Thomas Sanchez on after I interviewed him the AP did its job and ported
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:45.440]  on the attempted bribery of the police chief I mean folks when you sit here and you read
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:49.480]  these psyops and the houston chronicle and then the washington posts and everywhere they're
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:25:00.920]  lying to you and I just started I wouldn't even call it flashbacks it's just my memory
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:06.360]  starts flashing back to just all the craziness I've seen all the newscast all the articles
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:10.600]  generals again in the washington post like 1213 years ago I remember covering it's in
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:17.480]  one of my films it's in masters of terror saying we want to have mexican troops patrol
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:23.200]  with canadian troops to deal with america extremist I mean they got plans to bring foreign troops
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:32.040]  in here that's not me it's the general in the washington post I've got footage of cooperative
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:40.840]  nugget 93 94 95 96 smuggled out by the army there's good people in the military because
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:45.680]  they know this stuff's true training to take over us cities and confiscate the guns and
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:51.680]  we know they want the guns and if we can force a debate about this and look the globalists
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:55.080]  have failed there's a national debate about the militarization of police there's multiple
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:26:00.360]  bipartisan bills gaining steam to repeal the patriot act william benny sent me this article
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:04.600]  out of the hill today the former director of technical like the number two or three guy
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:10.680]  at the nsa sends us news articles and I'm not bragging I'm just saying we are the resistance
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:17.520]  here okay I can sit here with the former technical director of the nsa and you know and he he
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:21.640]  said on air before that I have a greater understanding of the nsa than any other journalist he's talked
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:26.200]  to I could go to dinner with him and he just said I can't believe you know all this because
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:32.360]  I'm not sitting around on my butt ladies and gentlemen I live this stuff I know what I'm
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:36.280]  talking about I'm not bragging I'm telling you I'm looking out my window and seeing our
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:42.880]  house on fire here we got to do something it's criminal and the military is being put in
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:48.520]  the position to follow these illegal orders we need to stand up and break the scyop and
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:52.600]  see through it and I don't know what to say about all the scyop people at the pentagon
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:56.760]  last year when the pentagon came out and said they were going to engage in scyops domestically
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:00.600]  by starting to tell the truth and there was like a hundred people civilians in the room
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:04.600]  mainly who all look sick at their stomachs because they understood this was the big plunge
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:11.840]  look at the top link on drudge we guys it just did that on my big screen over here you
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:17.160]  aim a document cam over there pentagon down place troop training in towns top story on
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:24.240]  drudge you know what that means it's one of the top stories in the country army special
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:30.320]  operations command pushes back against alarmist claims about upcoming exercise and they call
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:44.000]  us conspiracy theorist and all the rest of it in the article absolutely ridiculous yeah
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:49.360]  this is the same article that came out a few days ago we're just going to continue to break
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:28:00.360]  all this down while they didn't want people actually going to our site guys I've got copies
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:08.440]  of this printed this is a news story right here they have expunged our names out of this
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:20.880]  article I wonder if they did that over at the army times article too and I'll guarantee
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:24.040]  you that's because drudge is getting a big pushback saying you're not showing the other
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:33.440]  side of this drudge you need to show what we're saying about it what I'm going to do
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:42.280]  is oh he is linked to our story right here troops to operate undetected amongst civilian
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:49.920]  population pentagon practices infiltrating American towns during controversial exercise
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:57.880]  to info war stories and that's why the pentagon is I guarantee you flooding drudge with bots
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:01.720]  and saying you need to show the other side so drudge is doing that good job drudge do
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:07.920]  it but the point is I'm going to now get really neurotic and I'm going to shoot a special
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:13.200]  report to the layer tomorrow after the show today because I'm too upset right now not
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:18.520]  about their current attacks just bringing up all these memories I see police brutality
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:22.160]  I don't even want to watch it anymore and I know about all their takeovers and I just
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:28.400]  don't even want to I've got to really control myself even to go into the data because when
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:33.240]  I go into the data it's just so treasonous and so true what's happening that I want to
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:37.880]  throw up I mean I'm nauseous right now to actually watch the takeover of the country
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:41.400]  and to know what they're going to be doing buying off all the towns and everything else
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:46.120]  I mean it's just so sick to Obama might be getting ready to make his move though on a

[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:40.840]  one of the top stories in the country hundreds of news articles today saying i'm a liar
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:48.120]  basically that the military drills are for overseas and there's nothing going on nothing
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:53.240]  to see here and then i basically have all this other news to cover but i've
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:59.560]  just spun out and and and just gone into telling you stories about things that happen a lot of
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:07.640]  it's on video i made four police state films the first two um are when i would go to the drills
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:13.960]  and go to the operations and then and then catch them running real law enforcement operations and
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:20.600]  all the insider interviews and the police chief interviews and then they even have foreign troops
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.920]  that a lot of these and and then they say oh that's because this is for overseas but then
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:29.320]  you find out they're training to take on militias in america and admitting it and then they have it
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:34.680]  in other manuals that the preparations are being made and the washington post that they're preparing
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:42.280]  to use canadian and mexican troops on us that's sensational that's what's so frustrating do we
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:49.960]  have poll Watson not yet we can't get a hold of i'm gonna call it yeah he he has this tendency

[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:18.840]  and the hardware being given and then the the marines running dwi checkpoints in california

[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:26.520]  go ahead and say this because i don't know exactly what i want to do i've had a hernia for 14 years
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:32.840]  got it as a sports injury and i've lost so much weight that's what i keep forgetting we've been
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:36.920]  doing that before and after took a photo a month and a half ago i need to go ahead and just take
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:41.560]  a photo now because i might gain some weight after have surgery i want to show folks with
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:46.920]  the supermail vitality and stuff how much weight i've lost and so travis he's just taking a photo of
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:53.080]  me uh in the office with my shirt off after the show in the same spot so we can do that for an ad
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:58.520]  but i gotta go ahead and have surgery and i don't like having surgery i had surgery on my leg
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:03.640]  and uh that was not fun because it took a whole lot more anesthesia to put me under the normal
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:12.200]  people for whatever reason so i've got to tell myself to go under um or it takes a lot even
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:18.520]  with the new stuff and so i've got to go do that next wednesday i think i'm just gonna be out out
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:28.600]  all next week because i want to spend some time with my kids i'm not getting back till monday i want
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:41.160]  to spend some time with them before i have surgery but um we're going to get watson on and we're
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:46.840]  going to do a whole article and then after the show today i need that stack from the last report
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:54.120]  i shot and then i need to just get clergy response team infraguard documents um i need the guys in
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:38:02.280]  the back to tear the internet apart and search for the headline out of the washington post i think
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:09.000]  it's in master's of terror that i show the washington post article and it's some headline like
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:16.760]  us and mexico trained to fight terror and then you read later it's like they'll be used
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:24.120]  inside conus to deal with extremists as well so i just want to show the general saying that i mean
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:27.720]  it's not just that you're trying to military take on american people admitting it you want to use foreign
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:35.480]  troops you've had a long-term strategic operation to do this and you're trying to act like we're
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:40.440]  crazy and we're making something up as the government power grabs everything under the sun
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.960]  and as congress comes out and says the president is acting like a dictator but then does nothing
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:51.000]  i mean what's all on the line what's it called thank you what's it called
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:39:01.400]  when the president is opening the borders without law coming after guns without law
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:06.360]  shutting off the power plants without law funding al-qaeda outside of law overthrowing
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:12.280]  countries outside of authors just everything power grabbing the internet power grabbing
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:19.800]  with obama care i mean it came out last year that they have secret death panels for the troops
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:25.160]  and no one got in trouble and that's why we're in so much trouble the bottom has fallen out
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:31.800]  Watson thanks for coming to the line on on on uh short notice are you on phone or you on skype
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:40.440]  listen this story is a top story on drudge this there's no exaggeration over a hundred articles
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:51.080]  attacking me by name today um this is good we're we're really drawing major fire um but i we need
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:56.920]  to hit them hard because we are so conservative that we're not hitting them with 10 of the truth
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:01.880]  i want i want to do a master article for tomorrow and i'm going to shoot a video tonight
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:07.400]  but the problem is is that i don't have the hours and hours to dig up some of this stuff
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:14.040]  it's just in my head i need the washington post and a couple other there's like five or six articles
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:21.480]  when they floated in 2002 using mexican and canadian troops against american citizens
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:27.320]  what they called extremists and terrorists i want to hit them with that i want to hit them with a
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:32.680]  ran corporation national stabilization force police force i want to hit them with all the
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:37.560]  admissions that they want to get rid of passing commentatus and the council on farm relations
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:44.280]  calling for it and i want to hit them with uh all the admissions uh that they've got infragaard
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:50.600]  clergy response teams that they're hiring citizens to be spies i want to hit them like hey you know
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:55.080]  since the pentagon says all this about us here is what they're being trained with that the founding
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:59.240]  fathers wouldn't be welcome in the day's military you know the fox news article i want screenshots
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:04.360]  of it not just links you know here's even fox news admitting that ford hood said don't be evangelical
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:10.360]  or be a part of the tea party or will indict you know will will court marshal you and i mean
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:14.520]  i just want to show it all to him because i got nauseous thinking about all the massive evidence
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:19.400]  and then watching these sickening stories saying we're lying and then i want to explain how the
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:29.000]  sci-op works paul um where where they imply that we say a real invasion is happening and that they're
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  really going to take over hey is that a real photo on your twitter paul i like sorry i like
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:47.160]  the i know you're writing notes but is that a real photo on your twitter yeah wow who took that
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:55.400]  your girlfriend it's healthy who the healthy elix no no the shot of like a guy standing there
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:42:00.600]  with the pebbles it looks like you at a at the beach in england numb it's number six it's the
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:10.760]  prisoner oh okay who is number one you are number one you are number six yeah it's amazing i like
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:17.400]  that we got the same reaction remember after the fleet 2012 us army manual which repeatedly
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:23.640]  threw out said that it was for overseas but also domestic within the colonists the continental
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:28.280]  united states then for weeks after we were constantly attacking this is for overseas
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:34.120]  operations when oh remember they said drugs in demo were were wrong when we were linked to like
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:38.920]  seven or eight mainstream articles about drones spying on farmers building new barns
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:45.080]  and then now they just get knit they're everywhere i mean it's just i'm sick of it and then in this
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:50.360]  case you know jade helms the army says this is not going to affect anyone's day-to-day life this
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:55.640]  training is going to be in remote remote locations nobody's going to be really even noticed it and
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:43:00.280]  yet at the same time they come back and say oh by the way the troops are going to be blending in
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:07.400]  and infiltrating the local population and people to support to report suspicious activity so in
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:11.880]  one in one sense they say it's remote nobody's even going to know it's going on and then in the other
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:16.840]  sense they say we're going to be amongst you so they're being caught in a lie just on that alone
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:22.760]  and and and how practicing infiltrating here how does that teach you ukraine or or afghanistan
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:29.960]  look we but they want us here's the style they want us to debate and then even have to prove
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:33.960]  even though the proof's there they want to make it about proving this is true instead of having
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:39.320]  a debate about why is this going on militarization of police is all over the news we have and others
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:44.840]  have forced it out there the american people are starting to wake up and and i'm telling you if obama
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:49.720]  could get away with seizing power and staying in office he would we're going to expose this so that
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:54.200]  it doesn't happen and we're not doing this to attack the us army we're doing it to save the
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:44:00.600]  us military from being compromised and corrupted to become the new homeland security domestic
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:07.320]  security force just as big just as strong as our military so i want a giant obnoxious article with
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:14.360]  screenshots documents links and videos every three paragraphs 25 pages long paul just just
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:21.640]  just hammering them with everything and explaining that it is like the the war on drugs was mission
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:27.400]  creep or the war on terror this is the federal globalist takeover of the united states and and
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:31.880]  and it we're forcing a debate about it they just want to roll their sigh up out and condition
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:36.760]  everybody to accept it and we're not going to go along with it did you hear all the former rangers
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:41.000]  and people that just got out last year calling in yesterday about how yeah they'd go out with
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:47.080]  sniper teams and just randomly train them on citizens in in dc and stuff of course i know
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:52.840]  all about it it's all on record i mean that's what they do and then then they deal drugs and then
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:59.000]  they kill people and then they i mean this is what these teams do the more you'll do the more
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:04.840]  they'll put you into the really dirty teams and and and they all hide under national security
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:10.920]  and again most our military is not involved in this but it needs to stop and it needs to stop
[01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:17.080]  right now paul i want you to hit them too with the us army running uh los zenith that came out in
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:23.720]  federal court with the fbi and the us army they were running two of the three major cartels in a
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:30.760]  mexican destabilization and then the head number two head guy uh of the mexican drug cartel announced
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:35.000]  national security they sealed the court and the court let him off and said yes it's true he did it
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.240]  under the directions of the department of defense you always hear about him busting like army captains
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:43.400]  dealing drugs or killing people hey you know you'll hear oh these army captains got cut and
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:49.000]  running assassination teams on their own no they weren't doing it on their own and people just need
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:57.800]  to understand this cancer that is growing paul go ahead now i mean you mentioned the sniper training
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:02.040]  i mean it came out during occupy wall street there were there were plans to train snipers on
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:08.520]  those protesters again and again they did it just to see if the fbi snipers would actually go out to
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:14.520]  the peaceful protest and train sniper rifles on people yeah and remember there was already videos
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:21.160]  out even years before that troops in camo fatigues you know snatching people off the street also in
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:27.320]  the 2012 leaked manual they got into explicit detail about what weapons they would need to use
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:34.280]  both incapacitate protesters and to kill people to literally kill and they also describe how they
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:39.560]  need to hire all these civilian inmate labor camp people for domestic and terminate how to process
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:44.360]  our social security numbers and how to work with local law enforcement so the army came out in 2012
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:52.040]  and said we were liars it was for overseas when it says when operating in conus exactly and it's
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:58.840]  all geared towards this mass civil unrest that the first couple predicting that in years and paul
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:03.160]  your phone's breaking up that's why i wanted to get you on skype i just wanted to do good then you're
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:07.400]  on the same page as me you're bringing up all seeing all the stuff i'd forgotten about i forgot
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:14.120]  about public ads for internment specialist and public army documents about training to kill us
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:20.120]  and and and round us up i mean it's always worse than i remember i mean paul that's really our
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:25.640]  problem is but but can you do it as a bullet point people love those kind of just explain up front
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:30.280]  here's the total proof in your face globalist those of you taking over the military for this
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:35.720]  traitorous operation and just explain that we don't think this one operation is the end all be
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:40.920]  all takeover and we never said that the takeovers basically already happened and then just show it
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:48.520]  paul yeah all my legs all right great job i'm do me a favor because i'm really uh been up since
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:53.320]  six a.m and i'm really angry and i try to control my anger but when i do i get really angry and then
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:59.800]  i get really exhausted send a rob do in an email all those points you just said please and then i
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:04.360]  will shoot the video all the points we just brainstormed i will shoot the video at the end of
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:10.600]  the show put it all together and then it'll compliment your report that'll be out in the morning
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:17.080]  because we've got a real chance because the globalists have have countered us and put us in
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:22.520]  the spotlight and they can't help themselves they've already launched the operation even though
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:28.680]  i'm announcing this they're not going to be able to pull back quick enough i think we really got them
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:33.160]  here so we need to put all that in together and then we're going to shove this back down their
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:39.160]  throat how's that sound well they've cancelled other quite similar drills in the past after
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:44.920]  concern raised by residents haven't they so it could happen again yep and i mean they're just
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:48.280]  doing the standard deal that we don't like the troops and we're dirty commies let me just give
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:52.440]  me a break okay we don't want the troops running around with double bags of cash buy it off the
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:59.640]  mayors okay and by the way paul dig up the ally phillipus interview and the and the ap article
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:05.240]  about delta force caught in bribery scandal in in san Antonio because people don't so they don't
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:10.440]  remember all this in fact some were framed around the office it was up for years and then it disappeared
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:15.720]  when we built that studio did we ever rehang up uh the uh all those framed articles out of the
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:23.560]  statesman uh where where uh where delta force and all that we exposed them because we could
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:28.440]  screenshot that or scan it and send it to Watson as well i mean i want to create one article
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:35.640]  that just has it all in there so that we can just say here look at this and deny this thank you paul

[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:18.520]  here's the bottom line alex jones here back live the takeover happened
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:26.040]  the eas kill switches are in place the nsa spawn on everything foreign global treaties are being
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:32.520]  signed in secret our sovereignty is ending the feds run everything from what our kids eat
[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:41.400]  to the pie the price of our power we are conquered and now they're getting ready to mop up what's
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:45.560]  left the military's been patrolling and running this stuff for 20 years it's just intensifying
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:50.760]  and so this is so we don't notice because it's incrementally done like the frog in the pot it's
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:55:03.000]  that simple and it's being done because they're going to break this country and they're going
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.760]  to reeducate us they're going to wreck the economy so bad basically everybody's going to go on
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:10.600]  welfare government contracts and our dignity is going to be destroyed and we're going to be in
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:17.160]  bondage and as a man as a human as an american as a text and i take that really personal
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:23.320]  and that's why we're in so much trouble it's a normal response to get physically ill and
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:29.720]  angry and enraged by all of this but people don't have that outrage i mean i think about
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:36.120]  how it came out that there are secret death panels killing the troops and then they just
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:40.120]  ran a whitewash saying it was an accident it would stop and it just continues just like the
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:47.640]  derivatives just like the abortions just like all of it i mean it it makes me viciously angry
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:53.080]  and see i'm a terrorist because i don't like criminals screwing everybody over
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:57.800]  or people say oh it's extraordinary that he cares no
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:06.440]  i'm going to get into the russian bunkers with our guests because it ties into all the same thing
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:15.400]  because we've gone too far on time and then i've got one of my crew that i've worked with for a
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:23.400]  let's get it straight 10 years who's just a great guy one of our it people no criminal record
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:31.000]  until this stall started goes to church twice a week one of the most upright christian people i know
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:40.520]  he doesn't want his name used and we knew they had license plate scanning stuff years ago some
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:45.560]  of the police cars because i'd be driving behind him from a restaurant come in to work late work
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:51.960]  at night and the cops would just swing around and then pull him over because he refuses to
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:55.800]  have a license because the illegals don't have to have them and they're above the law and that's on
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:02.360]  record so and he understands it's going towards the mark of the beast and i got this document
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:05.320]  all he does is go and beat them in court
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:15.480]  and so document camp police they list him as dangerous gang until they say caution
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:24.440]  white male dangerous gang until and i guess he's part of the christian gang then it continues
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:28.360]  the code is 10-0 sovereign citizen
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:40.280]  and this is what they put in these databases but there's 40 million illegals who get free
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:44.760]  health care free everything bank accounts with no id's that's associated press totally above
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:49.560]  the law police are told don't arrest them board patrol documents they're told don't arrest them
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:57.080]  for felonies above the law but a citizen with no criminal record
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:01.720]  refuses to have a driver's license he has an id card a christian id card
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:07.160]  and man you'd think that he was the devil and you know why he is the devil of these people
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:11.480]  because they're going to make everybody have a cashless society card and they're going to shut
[01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:16.440]  the economy down and they are going to hunt down anybody with an underground economy any they are

[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:21.080]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:25.080]  look at some of these headlines
[02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:35.320]  federal taxes hit record high and obama wants more
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:43.240]  oh the dea had sex parties in columbia i'm looking at drugs report right now
[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:48.920]  cartel funded sex parties well of course those are authorized cartels
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:59.080]  i mean see the story is the hookers and oh my gosh instead of oh the dea works with major
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:05.240]  cartels to shut down the other cartels it's all about a monopoly over the drugs the dea is the
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:09.240]  drug importation agency that's what the agents call it themselves
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:15.000]  and they'll only bring that out so they can burn whoever they want
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:21.160]  just to keep them scared now they were having pedophile parties at the wire house that'd be
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:36.440]  okay with the government i mean they always will talk about bill clinton and an intern because
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:43.320]  that's only about that intern it won't burn anybody else not missiles to the chinese you know
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:50.840]  uh merv technology bill clinton gave merv technology through lauren hughes space technologies
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:58.600]  merv technology so an icbm won't just have one big warhead and it'll have 10 15 20 30
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:06.040]  and dummies in it let's say half of them are dummies so that when it comes back into the
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:15.480]  atmosphere it pops open and deploys say 20 warheads that's what their icbms generally carry 12 to 20
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:23.320]  10 of them or so can be dummies and so the lasers and other things try to take those out and then
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:32.520]  some get through and then they destroy whole cities how's that sound oh but but the government's
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:37.640]  doing all this for our national security yes but let's talk about monica luensky a little bit now
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:42.440]  and the blue dress and the president seaman because everybody kind of gets excited about that
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:49.640]  and bill clinton's crooked proboscis who cares i mean fine that that would have brought him down
[02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:55.480]  great i'm just saying in conjunction though we have to then think about all the real things that
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:03:02.200]  are going on you're playing god with the internet republicans shouts at fcc chief during hearings
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:10.920]  absolutely i love louis gomer i mean he you know for the second amendment you name it you couldn't
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:14.680]  ask for better and he knows what he's doing who was the congressman that told obama during the
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:19.400]  state of the union you lie because obama was telling the ball face lie
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:30.360]  and remember we have republicans that passed in the house last year the partial breath abortion
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:33.960]  ban had got killed in the senate why didn't they pass it this year because now we had to
[02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:37.240]  vote in the senate to pass it and they could have actually done something so now oh we can't
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:41.560]  let it out of committee or if it does we got to vote it down because we can't ban that
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:46.280]  joe wilson is the name yes that's right joe wilson congressman joe wilson
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:53.960]  we ought to loop that and it's not really very audible we ought to augment it you know boost

[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:07.800]  if the british was ever to come over here that they had put a light up in this high church steeple and
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:14.760]  paul went down there to look and showing up there was the light burning brighter than day well paul
[02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:20.200]  he jumped on his old horse and he lit out he didn't know where he was going but he knew he had to go
[02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:25.160]  somewhere oh i wish you could have seen it that old horse with his ears laid back in his nostrils
[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:30.440]  wide open the sucking in wind like a jet engine feet pounding on them cobblestones striking off
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:35.480]  sparks paul are holding on for dear life and are hollering at the top of his lungs he says the
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:40.200]  british is coming the british is coming get you a gun we're going to have us a revolution
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:46.920]  and them farmers come up piling out of the hay like bead out of beehive minute men there's called
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:52.360]  what's that mean minute men there's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice and when paul
[02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:57.080]  comes screeching down the road that way they grabbed their guns and hid out behind the weeds
[02:09:57.080 --> 02:10:03.320]  and walls and trees and everywhere and when the british come pranks and long haul dressed up and
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:12.520]  in their red suits they let them have it it was a sight to see and then it happened they fired the
[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:22.760]  gun they fired the gun and the shot was so loud it was heard clear around the world oh get out
[02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:26.680]  wow that's the way this country started
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:37.560]  and the globalists hope to start a civil war it's even come out in democrat memos where they
[02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:42.200]  stage false flags blame on the liberty movement march the military and police out against us
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:47.640]  start gun confiscation that will trigger real resistance they'll keep staging atrocities to
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:53.160]  blame it on us and they think we're so stupid from all their tv's and movies where they show militia
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:58.440]  always fighting the police and they always archetypally branded that during a civil war
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:07.240]  the patriot militia will kill police if a civil war kicks off that's only if they're firing at
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:12.520]  you're trying to take you off to a facility everybody needs to think about who the enemy is
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:21.320]  who the real occupiers are that are running this thing they think you're so stupid they put a narrative
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:26.200]  out that we're all just going to kill each other no that's not going to happen george soros
[02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:32.360]  that's not going to happen all of you people that have been part of this
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:40.520]  all the zars 10 zars that have endorsed mausetown on television who killed 80 million people plus
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:48.200]  that's the chinese numbers cis is 65 million or whatever all of you people that have tried to
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:53.640]  bankrupt the economy endorse cloward and piven that is sedition that is sabotage all of you
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:58.280]  that are saying you'll cut off emergency funds the states that don't endorse carbon taxes that's
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:04.600]  terrorism you people have committed legions of crimes lowering our borders by the classical
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:11.720]  sense you are the ultimate criminal destroyer usurpers you will not get away with it that's why
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:17.880]  by the thousands the elite are buying redouts i told you this three years ago when cameron left
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:21.720]  and they made fun of me but now it's been in the guardian other places that know hollywood
[02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:26.040]  the billionaires they're leaving they're leaving israel they're leaving the us they're leaving
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:37.000]  europe they're going to the eastern areas of the pacific they are going to areas like new zealand
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:44.840]  is pretending what part of the world you're making say it's the other part of the pacific
[02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:48.120]  that's just it's just so horrible and
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:55.800]  are we smart enough to figure this out and just not do this i mean i don't want the civil
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:13:02.440]  war now our guest was coming on about the william benney interview the former technical director
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:06.520]  of the national security agency will go over some of those slides for tv viewers info wars.com
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:13.720]  forward slash show but then i'm also going to get his take he's a smart guy um james nox on russia
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:18.760]  has constructed massive underground shelters in anticipation nuclear war i want to tie this
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:25.480]  into the plane crash at the bottom of the hour they're now saying that passenger shriek has
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:32.680]  co-pilot deliberately crashed the jet after he'd locked the other pilot the main pilot out notice
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:39.960]  it was a hardened cockpit door see how any move of security can then cause the opposite effect and
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:45.000]  be used just like national security's been used to take our liberties the main threat is the national
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:52.600]  security cog grid it's what can be used to take over the country and is being used i call it a
[02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:57.880]  reverse valkyrie in operation valkyrie some of the german high command tried to kill hitler
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:02.920]  not because they even were sad about what hitler done to minorities but because they
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:08.120]  knew he was going to wreck germany more and kill tens of millions more germans at that time they
[02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:16.280]  already lost about 16 million germans and so when they tried to take hitler out it was because they
[02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:28.920]  were german patriots they cared about germany and they used the cog plan that hitler had for
[02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:34.760]  martial law to take over the military that they tried something to reverse engineer that and use
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:43.480]  that cog system to overthrow hitler but it didn't work cog is what ends the government it is what
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:49.480]  ends the republic continuity of government is the system to take it over and remember what
[02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:55.560]  william benney said he for since the early 90s he tried to get the nsa to have taps on its internal
[02:14:55.560 --> 02:15:00.280]  systems to see who accessed it that's the first thing you do everybody at my office has an access
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:05.000]  code so we know when they come they have a beeper that has their code so we know when they came
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:11.080]  that's not a police state it's our internal operation it's our internal security that's
[02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:15.960]  good where everybody takes care of their security the first thing you do is monitor who comes on
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:23.880]  that network they spy on everything but the nsa and who goes on the restricted networks show foreign
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:32.440]  governments and contractors can steal everything now if you're at the top of the pyramid you're at
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:40.520]  the top like william benney the equivalent of a multi star general then you've got at the bottom
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:49.320]  of the pyramid people like james nox a master telecommunications engineer who you know just
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:55.560]  like snowden had access to just massive amounts of stuff he won't get into some of that but he
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:16:00.040]  was talking about and confirming the snowden documents when they came out just about the hubs
[02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:06.120]  he put in and puts in and this guy goes over multi-stage doing this he so see the bottom of
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:10.760]  the pyramid's the top of the pyramid and vice versa police are the top of the pyramid even
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:14.120]  though they're the bottom of the pyramid because you're there where the rubber meets the road
[02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:22.040]  and you'll also go through the hell of these policies if they go through
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:29.880]  james nox is in in 1984 joined the us army as part of a last class of 60 uh 26 v's
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:36.600]  he was honorably discharged in 1990 he worked as an assistant comsec custodian ran
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:43.640]  ar fco's lethal force authorization transport of theater key mat repaired and maintained ts
[02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:49.160]  communications center and equipment reformed destruction duties tempest certification after
[02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:53.320]  discharge he joined the commercial market providing turnkey communications networks
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:58.120]  and maintenance throughout the united states and so part of that was put in the nsa snoo pops
[02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:03.480]  because that's what goes in everything folks he holds multiple certifications dc to daylight
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:08.840]  he likes to say he has done networks encompassing wireline to microwave to fiber optics to both
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:14.040]  commercial and government's clients and it was guys like him and even more high level
[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:18.600]  who told me no your cable box listens to you know everything has spy hubs everything has
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:23.080]  takeover boxes and then they would show me the documents and and and we're going to skip this
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:26.760]  network breaks we have plenty of time to talk to him only break i'm skipping today folks and i've
[02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:33.800]  had and i haven't been plugging today so support us in forestore.com uh but youtube.com forward
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:42.360]  slash james knocks dark uh camo twitter dark camo and he joins us right now james i want to get
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:47.240]  into bennie first uh and then i want to get into this russia situation because i promise and i want
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:54.520]  to get your take on it as well but uh first off what do you make of the massive acceleration
[02:17:54.520 --> 02:18:01.080]  of 10 state open infiltration takeover drills and then now there's huge psi ops saying it's for
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:06.680]  overseas when their own documents admit it's for domestic operations and then we have legions of
[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:11.320]  other documents admitting that it's exponentially going up they say on the houston chronicle and
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:15.000]  all these other publications that jones has been warned about this for decades it never happens
[02:18:15.640 --> 02:18:23.720]  has it the takeover pretty much happened uh james yeah and then you know from my point of view i've
[02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:31.640]  always seen it that nobody really understands that since uh nine eleven we've been under a
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:42.440]  status of emergency which uh invoke continuity of government to some unknown state so those
[02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:50.600]  things are going on i don't have any actual facts i can certainly give you my feeling
[02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:59.800]  uh as to what they've done and i see this as a psi op because if you notice in this uh
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:09.960]  document there's no enemy texas is a hostile place but it never says why texas is hostile
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:19.480]  and that's where i think we need to realize that they are their words mastering the human
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:27.480]  domain well when we talk about the sheep and the takeover but that's exactly what this is
[02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:39.400]  how do you get a citizenry to uh interact with these folks by getting these folks to interact
[02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:46.520]  with the civilians such that hey i'm with the government and i am going to help you
[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:52.680]  and of course in early missions they are actually helping but the point is it's a mission creep
[02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:57.960]  jurisdictional takeover for the national stability force that is really the takeover force in the
[02:19:57.960 --> 02:20:05.800]  rand corporations master admission oh absolutely i mean it's in your face well at least now but
[02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:15.720]  that uh highly common thought is uh no longer with us yeah notice they would always say to me
[02:20:15.720 --> 02:20:20.200]  15 years ago 20 years ago posse commentatus it'll never happen even when it was happening people
[02:20:20.200 --> 02:20:23.960]  were denying it now it's like yeah we got rid of posse commentatus and we're getting ready to
[02:20:23.960 --> 02:20:31.720]  process and yeah we'll disappear you exactly and i've got a little tidbit that i'm looking into
[02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:42.120]  uh from a buddy of mine that this things like jade helm um may have been going on and likely
[02:20:42.120 --> 02:20:51.960]  have been going on conus for some period of time much longer than we are presently aware
[02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:59.080]  absolutely it's been going on since the 60s uh i mean that's in my films but it's exponentially
[02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:03.560]  going up now before they were beta testing just to see if they could get the military to do it
[02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:08.520]  testing how they sell troops on doing it so so really it's about brainwashing the the military
[02:21:08.520 --> 02:21:12.760]  first to accept it and think it's a good mission because most these are good men and women and
[02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:17.160]  then it's about conditioning the locals to do it it's the exponential ramping up i mean let's say
[02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:24.120]  it was a one on a Richter scale under reagan and then let's say it was about a six under clinton
[02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:28.040]  and then it scaled back a little bit under bush but then the police state and other areas expanded
[02:21:28.040 --> 02:21:33.320]  under obama it's kind of like a seven eight or nine i mean it's just it's just shooting up right now
[02:21:33.320 --> 02:21:40.120]  james i would i would absolutely agree and and i think it's the fact that they're i was kind of
[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:47.320]  alluding to the the tier one architecture uh being involved um yeah let's get into nsa you
[02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:53.160]  really uh liked the uh william benny nsa uh technical director interview last week and
[02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:56.600]  contacted us and i was really happy to get you on the show because i was already wanting to
[02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:01.240]  uh give us your take on that interview from the top view and then from the ground view where you're
[02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:09.320]  at well william benny you know i have nothing but respect for that man and think he's a hero um
[02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:17.560]  you know he he exposed uh the way i see benny i think he was involved in carnivore uh to what
[02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:22.520]  extent i'm not sure he's no he basically you know he told me at dinner he said i don't like to brag
[02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:28.600]  but i basically directed the building all of it he said the infrastructure i designed and he didn't
[02:22:28.600 --> 02:22:36.200]  like to brag but the guy's a master genius oh affirmative um so i think thin thread then was
[02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:42.600]  uh a device to basically get around the objections of the congressional hearings
[02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:56.680]  of the carnivore device um which then basically utilizing helia and that access that had been
[02:22:56.680 --> 02:23:08.680]  put in place by uh brother bill click willie um turned everything on us and all the
[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:18.920]  infrastructure was there because what he did with helia creating that access that's access to each
[02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:30.280]  and every uh pop point of presence or circuit in the united states at a minimum and uh i kind of
[02:23:30.280 --> 02:23:35.320]  treasure map is something he talked about i would like to discuss yeah we're putting the slides on
[02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:42.040]  screen right now break it down and then specifically talk about on the ground how how the nsa jack's
[02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:48.600]  into everything well basically i mean that's just simple uh you can take a piece of fiber
[02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:53.960]  and you can either you know you can cut it connect your eyes it put it in a patch panel
[02:23:53.960 --> 02:24:01.800]  and then just put a prism in front of it and you basically split that signal um and then account for
[02:24:02.680 --> 02:24:12.360]  the minor uh loss of that splitter and then you run fiber over to the nsa collection point
[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:21.160]  for that point of presence and then the natural traffic flow discontinues through it is absolutely
[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:28.840]  you can't see it that's why i said there's no solution for it because and that was a
[02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:34.920]  complaint about carnivore uh what they they're doing is they're just slurping everything in
[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:41.080]  and telling you that hey i'll filter it you know trust us we're not going to look at that stuff and
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:50.600]  now we see that what has happened um and that gets into treasure map and that literally scares me
[02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:59.160]  to death and i can get into that but just write down treasure map and write down treasure now
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:06.680]  if we look at all those access points that you had just had a configure those are places that
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:14.600]  that's happening that that data is being slurped up and all of it you know think of it like the
[02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:20.520]  entire mission bit stream which is going to be everything you know to include the metadata
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:27.000]  you know the unused portion just that whole piece of fiber and they're taking everything
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:37.720]  that's on there and they're storing it if facilities uh like uh what is it something bluff in utah
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:47.160]  i always want to say pine bluff because pine bluff is uh our sister uh the five eyes down in
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:56.600]  uh alex spring australia um if you look at ford mead basically alex springs is much like that
[02:25:57.320 --> 02:26:04.520]  and then you have other five eyes areas that are those things matter of fact uh my grandfather
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:15.880]  was the one that built uh the uh conus um spaces for those uh satellite dishes for that network
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:22.600]  you know actually echelon at that time and that's not uh you know that's no longer classified
[02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:29.560]  right in talking about echelon that's a system based on key work and that's a good way you know
[02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:36.280]  that as william benny said creates a target rich environment where if you're slurping everything in
[02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:47.320]  you have just this mad amount of data that you then have to try to uh decipher and figure out what is
[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:52.520]  you know and there's a lot of points here number one we're just calmly talking about the fact that
[02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:58.760]  they're listening and recording and saving basically everything it's totally illegal they
[02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:04.840]  admit that our internet is a lot slower because they are slurping it uh it cost hundreds of
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:12.840]  millions of dollars to do this every few years uh it is converting our economy into the watchers and
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:19.880]  the watched and they've been caught and aren't in trouble and then major corporations are all
[02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:25.160]  basically surveilling people as well and selling the data and then gaming economies with the
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:29.880]  information so many people and what do you say to this uh james nox so many people say
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:35.880]  if you have nothing to hide what's the problem well you see people that put what they get for
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:39.960]  christmas and that they're going out of town on facebook and then they get robbed because the thieves
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:44.680]  use that intel you lock your door not because you're a bad person at night but because it's just
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:49.160]  another measure of security and it's like saying you shouldn't lock your door you're a criminal or
[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:54.360]  you shouldn't lower your blinds i lower the blinds because i want to sleep past six thirty
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:28:01.560]  you know i mean it's this mental illness how have we gotten this far uh liberalism
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:13.560]  um collectivism uh this communism um but that's i would diverge into something else there
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:21.560]  to me how have we got here it it's uh it's a tryout people have been led to believe
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:29.320]  um that all these things are good they make your life easier um it's really been fed to us on a
[02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:39.480]  you know on a platter of convenience and everybody was so sure that it couldn't happen here and with
[02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:44.760]  what you just said you know it doesn't say any of that in the constitution the constitution basically
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:53.000]  says the opposite it says you know what it's funny your business if i want to stand on top of half
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:29:04.920]  dome in yosemite and make gurgling sounds and talk to the clouds and act like a fruit cake i can do
[02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:18.040]  that why it doesn't matter if nobody's this that's america if i want to be a uh you know whatever
[02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:23.320]  religion um it's none of their business let's come back and talk about this and talk about what
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:29.640]  benny kept hammering i want to get your take on this that no one's allowed to see who goes on the
[02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:36.280]  nsa network i mean that must totally open it up then to infiltration and hackers that is the most
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:41.400]  insane thing because obviously the insiders don't want people knowing what they're doing
[02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:46.680]  so the criminals can get away with this they've left us wide open it's the perfect plan to destroy
[02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:54.360]  us in my view stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:36.920]  agency this isn't just tinkering around the edges poke and said during capital briefing on legislation
[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:42.600]  this is a meaningful overhaul of the system yeah that they estimate that just the spy grids between
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:49.480]  about 15 different agencies is a hundred billion dollars out of the giant budget and that's why
[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:53.800]  just like the movie enemy of the state they have killed people who try to do this so pray for those
[02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:58.200]  congressmen the bill will completely repeal the patriot act sweeping national security law
[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:03.240]  passed in the days of september 11th that will gut the nsa's takeover as well as the 2008 faiza
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:08.280]  amendments act uh so this is really really exciting what do you make of that there's some other
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:13.320]  positive news here today i'm going to cover this is the start of the show uh house revives
[02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:20.440]  bill to completely repeal the patriot act dismantle nsa spying uh kansas to join states
[02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:25.160]  allowing concealed guns without permits a lot of the great stuff like that uh so there's a lot
[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:30.440]  of positive stuff uh going on james and people are voting with their dollars destroying mcdonald's
[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:35.720]  and other globalist soft kill operations i mean we're seeing some positive things happen
[02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:41.880]  where do you see the battle right now if this was a football game well i think uh i think we're
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:47.080]  definitely moving the ball because people are starting to wake up and and and understand and
[02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:53.240]  thank you for what you said by the way it's the voice not the mind um and actually l five is fractured
[02:39:53.240 --> 02:40:00.280]  as i speak so i know you sent us a shot of the x-ray unbelievable i do appreciate that you know
[02:40:00.280 --> 02:40:07.720]  why you want us to show the x-ray on tv oh sure go ahead it's uh it's it's kind of a dramatic image
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:13.640]  well i'm surprised you can even talk man when my back was just thrown out shooting a 50 cal
[02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:17.960]  like 100 rounds handheld when the spine flipped the other way i mean it was excruciating until
[02:40:17.960 --> 02:40:21.480]  the chiropractor finally got it back but it felt like i was dying when they were putting it back
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:30.200]  i don't shoot the 50 anymore i i just stick with my 33 78 that's about all i can handle is that a
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:40.680]  lapua um no it's actually a 33 78 weatherby it's uh the fastest of the 30 so it'll do a 180 grain
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:49.480]  cartridge at 34 50 wow yeah it's uh it yeah i gotta say i'm not a very good shot with the 50
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:56.920]  caliber rifle with the 308 remington 700 with the scope i've got that i bought it like 15 years ago
[02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:02.920]  when a dallas swap team guy sold it to me and it it just it's like a laser beam at 500 yards i mean
[02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:06.920]  i can just shoot through the same hole if it's not real windy i'm not like a good sniper with
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:11.480]  choreolas and you know factoring in wind and all that stuff but out to about a thousand yards i can
[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:16.120]  shoot in about a five inch group with the with a 308 and i think that'll get the job done you know
[02:41:17.240 --> 02:41:25.560]  oh yeah absolutely 308 is uh it's been inherently accurate around and um certainly uh combat effective
[02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:31.240]  after a thousand yeah but i didn't mean to digress further i didn't mean to digress you were commenting
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:38.120]  on where the ball is right now yeah so i think we're moving the ball you know one thing that the
[02:41:38.120 --> 02:41:45.080]  last comment you made before i went to break uh about it was kind of a negative thing you know
[02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:49.800]  that really nailed it that brought me back to i'd made i got some notes in front of me and we've
[02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:56.120]  kind of been i've kind of missed a lot of them that brought me back to treasure map do we go back
[02:41:56.120 --> 02:42:03.160]  to that first yeah let's do that so you know if we look at that when when we talked about what
[02:42:03.720 --> 02:42:10.360]  colia did and all that access and then when william benny talked about being able to get
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:15.640]  everybody's i me i which is basically your electronic or a serial number of your phone
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:25.720]  we also have to realize that every device every device that has a network interface controller
[02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:32.440]  has a mac address media it has a media access controller and it has a hexadecimal address
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:41.080]  associated with that and that's hardwired into an e-pom hard coded they can be changed but it's
[02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:50.440]  hard coded now if what he said if they go out and they actually are able to audit the everything
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:43:01.800]  and know what where and and you know all those devices exist and where those ip addresses
[02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:11.240]  physically are they take that data and they store it that you know you thought for me
[02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:17.960]  wherever so you were talking about what we have to see here that's what our children
[02:43:17.960 --> 02:43:23.160]  are our grandchildren and other generations because the other thing you got to think about
[02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:30.760]  is he was talking about persistence they're not only looking at it they're storing it now they've
[02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:37.080]  just started doing that and through miniaturization more is law you know things you're just going to
[02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:43.960]  keep getting smaller and smaller and smaller which is going to allow them uh greater and greater
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:50.760]  ability to store more and more data for much greater length and they can also then corrupt
[02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:54.440]  and manipulate the data what do you make of the point i've been asking and we'll go back to treasure
[02:43:54.440 --> 02:44:01.720]  map about benny that they don't look at who's on the nsa network that i mean that i know that is
[02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:15.320]  insane that this silly assumption that they have that once you've been cleared and read on uh to
[02:44:15.320 --> 02:44:23.160]  a specific project or level of security because there's only three um and then beyond that you'd
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:33.640]  be read on to a particular project um so there's an assumption or inside uh it isn't that way the
[02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:43.880]  funny thing is that's not the way i knew it um we used to well i'll put it this way we used to
[02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:53.080]  watch our guys all the time um i i can't i can't go into that but sure i mean there's more than one
[02:44:53.080 --> 02:44:59.080]  way to skin a cat and obviously for people that are in the infrastructure itself you can do whatever
[02:44:59.080 --> 02:45:04.600]  you want i mean that's like snowden i mean it's like i said being on the ground almost gives
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:10.520]  you a better view than being on top of the mountain doesn't it absolutely because the reality is all
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:19.640]  that uh spy equipment is is really a tweak version of some management suite so i'm the guy that has
[02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:26.440]  the management suite i'm the guy that can go in and hook up to the craft port or do a rad session
[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:35.320]  or remote access session and log into that device and i have a super user uh administrative uh
[02:45:35.320 --> 02:45:43.000]  uh password so i can go in there and it's as if i'm you know sitting in front of the device
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:51.960]  or device it and you know i could do it from my smart device as things exist today okay well
[02:45:51.960 --> 02:45:58.040]  correct me if i'm wrong but as a layman and haven't we then built a system that leaves us wide open
[02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:03.720]  and is the opposite of something uh you know the system claiming that this panoptagonic
[02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:08.360]  omnipresent spy greatest keep us safe it sounds like we've created the doomsday device
[02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:13.320]  absolutely because of this
[02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:21.880]  well of exactly what you talk about and what benny talked about the really uh
[02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:30.680]  fast-acquired way that we've gone about this i think it's done nothing but open us up um
[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:36.840]  you know we talk about the grid i'll be honest with you you know i've i've uh i've been in every
[02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:44.600]  kind of energy facility that exists the only reason that the the grid is safe from hack
[02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:50.120]  is because it doesn't connect to the internet that's right it's just that physical the reason
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:54.680]  aren't they beginning now to make the grid quote go smart won't that open it up like swiss cheese
[02:46:54.680 --> 02:47:04.680]  that's a possibility and um i actually have a call in to uh an engineer i used to work with
[02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:11.880]  and uh as a particular electrical company and i want to discuss just that with him
[02:47:12.840 --> 02:47:22.360]  because i heard another uh little bird mentioned something uh about actually setting that up
[02:47:22.360 --> 02:47:28.440]  i'm not certainly disturbing yeah i've actually seen the tread publications it's also secret
[02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:33.480]  what goes in power plants and it should be uh but it's not secret people in the industries
[02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:40.040]  that they're starting to put you know monitoring systems in and other things uh for all this energy
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:46.520]  trading and stuff and they think that that's enough for them to get hacks into the computers
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:56.360]  and i guess that ties oh i'm sorry it could be and in reality all the way back to 2000
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:03.720]  inside what they call uh power center operations um you're seeing that even to the point
[02:48:04.360 --> 02:48:12.680]  that all substations uh now have audio and video surveillance of us the guys that worked there
[02:48:12.680 --> 02:48:20.840]  uh or well for me used to work there um we kind of don't like it because there's a lot of things
[02:48:21.400 --> 02:48:28.520]  that people don't need to see what we're doing certainly the security people so sometimes we
[02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:35.080]  have battles about that but that is definitely happening and i can tell you uh from being a
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:41.640]  native california is by far the most corrupt uh state union well that's huge news right there
[02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:45.880]  yeah we have people selling that all the time and the security guards the first level to break down
[02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:52.760]  are you telling me they have internet based cameras inside the power plant control rooms
[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:57.080]  which which you can go to websites that have hundreds of thousands of government uh and in
[02:48:57.080 --> 02:49:02.760]  private access cameras because people didn't change the code when they installed it yeah
[02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:11.080]  they have what they have internet based that's a story right there wow that is a horrible security
[02:49:11.080 --> 02:49:23.000]  breach that i tell you this is now crazy um how far they've gone with that i don't know but yeah it's
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:33.480]  not um and nothing happens you know you just you know people in my business we you know we live
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:42.760]  of our lives under a microscope um so it's not like you know we go around and and nobody knows
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:50.680]  what we're doing but to go this far and then to have management and this is what's happening
[02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:56.440]  kind of like in the healthcare industry where we have human resources and management controlling
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:50:03.960]  these systems and they know nothing about them and all they're going to do is think of well in
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:09.480]  california and in pennsylvania they got caught six seven years ago watching kids on the government
[02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:14.120]  issued laptops the free laptops that aren't free that we pay for and then they just defeated
[02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:18.760]  themselves and go yeah we're watching girls shower at home with them big deal we call the police
[02:50:18.760 --> 02:50:23.240]  because the skittles look like drugs i mean they're just so nonchalant about it
[02:50:23.240 --> 02:50:33.480]  throughout the industry um and this is something that i personally have a significant problem with
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:39.480]  and break that down for us and have a side and i'm gonna hit this russian bunker no absolutely

[02:54:08.360 --> 02:54:13.640]  on jade helm and the big picture not just this particular operation but the backdrop of the
[02:54:13.640 --> 02:54:20.040]  corruption of the military and our government the institutionalization of the permanent surveillance
[02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:25.240]  uh tyranny state and then i'm also going to shoot another special report that'll air tomorrow
[02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:28.920]  because david night's doing the show tomorrow i'm going out to california to speak at cal jam
[02:54:30.840 --> 02:54:34.360]  i'm 98 percent sure i'm going to pull the trigger on surgery next wednesday
[02:54:34.360 --> 02:54:38.440]  that's not an april fools joke that's when they can do it with the surgeon i want on my hernia
[02:54:38.440 --> 02:54:44.680]  that i've had for 14 years i had been working out in about a year or two and i showed off to a
[02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:49.880]  girlfriend that uh i guess my wife i just got about to get married but one of those rollers you know
[02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:54.440]  where you roll she couldn't do one and i did like 15 of them real fast and then did a little tear
[02:54:54.440 --> 02:54:59.720]  well now it's just gotten too big since i lost all this weight it's it's just uh the guts are now
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:03.880]  starting to come out more because when i've gotten my clothes off i mean standing up now i have a
[02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:07.320]  little bit of a pop bill when i'm sitting down when i stand up it's like bam i mean i'm starting
[02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:13.800]  to get a six pack and um so i've got to i've got to go do this i don't know i'm gonna pray about it
[02:55:13.800 --> 02:55:18.200]  because i'm not scared of the surgery but i also know they like to kill people while they're having
[02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:22.120]  surgery and i'm not saying they would do that it's a little too obvious but they've done it to jim
[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:26.360]  keith and other people um so kind of just throw that out there if they want to come get me i guess

[02:56:02.920 --> 02:56:07.560]  as soon as you're back it's a little bit better champ but james noxon just a minute or two any
[02:56:07.560 --> 02:56:14.840]  other point you'd like to add um you know i'll actually i'll tell you this you know when benny
[02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:22.840]  mentioned 2.8 million square foot comm center being built at me um just off the top of my head
[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:30.840]  i can think of oh that should bring up to about six million square foot a comm center that i know
[02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:41.000]  about um and that's that's a scary thing um you know one of the things that we could do to uh i don't
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:50.680]  know i guess frustrate uh the powers that be the NSA excuse me that's right because i always i always
[02:56:50.680 --> 02:56:55.320]  think about how to attack at the congress level just to get rid of it we should do that but also
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:59.720]  we should frustrate it and degrade it because it's criminal that's a great point how do you
[02:56:59.720 --> 02:57:10.040]  block this and protect yourself do a FOIA request on yourself to do the nsa to the fpi to the cia
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:19.080]  now make these people do their job they're trying not to allow FOIA request let's overwhelm
[02:57:19.080 --> 02:57:25.640]  i you know we need i i think we need to teach uh you know it made a real mistake when we did this
[02:57:25.640 --> 02:57:30.360]  when we opened this stuff when we put this infrastructure in but we need to remember that
[02:57:30.360 --> 02:57:36.360]  it's our infrastructure just you know public dollars pays for this so we need to take it back
[02:57:36.360 --> 02:57:43.160]  but again um i think anything that we can do to get them to realize that they are in fact
[02:57:43.160 --> 02:57:50.920]  serving and they took an oath things like you know a FOIA request anything that you see you know
[02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:59.320]  they see something report something do it but report the stupidest things you see because
[02:57:59.320 --> 02:58:03.800]  they're going to have to use resources and go out and look for it that's right they want to
[02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:08.600]  solve tattling on each other they want us to see something we i mean we call homeland security
[02:58:08.600 --> 02:58:13.640]  about the ammo bands about uh you know government drills you know training to shoot targets of
[02:58:13.640 --> 02:58:20.840]  kids absolutely just jam their spy grid tattling on them yeah because i think i i think the more
[02:58:20.840 --> 02:58:27.560]  people that and be nice you know there's nothing to be gained by you know attacking these people
[02:58:27.560 --> 02:58:33.560]  but if we go out there and and we talk to them sure let them know we're awake absolutely the
[02:58:33.560 --> 02:58:37.640]  menus aren't the problem but we need to let them know and their bosses know thank you so much

[03:00:05.480 --> 03:00:12.440]  because there's a war on for your mind there's a war on between the forces of good want to build
[03:00:12.440 --> 03:00:17.880]  things and have community and where we want to vote with our choices and basically build up
[03:00:17.880 --> 03:00:25.720]  the better attributes of humanity people that are prideful and honest and bring something to
[03:00:25.720 --> 03:00:31.320]  the table build one type of civilization a wonderful civilization those that don't come
[03:00:31.320 --> 03:00:36.600]  and take over civilizations and destroy them and build idols to themselves and tell people
[03:00:36.600 --> 03:00:43.320]  how great they are and that's what we're see happening classically at a very fast pace now and
[03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:52.360]  I didn't really whine today I just really hits me how ridiculous this criminal takeover is
[03:00:52.360 --> 03:00:58.840]  it's foreign banks publicly and they all brag about it it gave us I mean it's just sick
[03:00:59.720 --> 03:01:05.160]  but I realize it's a confidence game with ignorant people everything is about confidence
[03:01:05.160 --> 03:01:13.960]  it's with smart people it's about the data and then confidence doesn't hurt but it's just the
[03:01:13.960 --> 03:01:19.400]  confidence of hillary you know being asked a few months ago about you know hearings about turkey
[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:25.640]  and arms she goes to a turkey what about a turkey you know just just the disdain knowing the general
[03:01:25.640 --> 03:01:32.440]  public wouldn't even know what turkey is a country I mean just just playing games folks
[03:01:32.440 --> 03:01:37.800]  that's what they do oh Alex has been saying the government's going to take over forever
[03:01:37.800 --> 03:01:44.520]  where is the takeover where is the takeover look around I mean there won't be any freedom left
[03:01:44.520 --> 03:01:51.080]  very soon at this rate that's why I'm freaking out is they're moving quick man they're moving fast
[03:01:54.840 --> 03:01:59.320]  I mean look at television how it's changed from schoolhouse rock about the founding fathers
[03:01:59.320 --> 03:02:04.920]  until now I see articles and tv shows putting down the founders constantly and you know why
[03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:08.840]  they're doing it because the founders were alive in their age and they certainly weren't perfect
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:12.680]  but compared to every other country they were promoting more more freedom than anybody else
[03:02:12.680 --> 03:02:20.280]  and the ideas they came up with changed the world and there's a revolution against those men and
[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:29.160]  women and I am just not going to sit here while I watch a bunch of lesser men spit on all of us
[03:02:29.160 --> 03:02:33.720]  and spit on George Washington's grave and Thomas Jefferson's grave we ought to have some basic pride
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:41.320]  if we don't have pride we're going to be overrun where are instincts where is our territorialism
[03:02:42.200 --> 03:02:46.200]  I mean I know so many guys are walking out of a store with a 12 pack of beer and like bump into
[03:02:46.200 --> 03:02:51.400]  the act and tough or whatever where or if your dog goes you know in in their yard they come in
[03:02:52.200 --> 03:02:55.720]  I want you to go over there and pick up your dog's crap I'm like that's actually happening to me
[03:02:55.720 --> 03:03:00.040]  well I'm sorry I usually take the dog out I'm sorry he got out and did that I'd be glad to hey
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:05.960]  you've you've been over my house before and had a beer why are you bugging your eyes out I mean
[03:03:05.960 --> 03:03:13.560]  having a bad day and then I'll go forward people get mad at me in a store whatever I go I wish
[03:03:13.560 --> 03:03:17.080]  you'd get mad about the government screwing everybody over because you know what I'm not mad
[03:03:17.080 --> 03:03:23.720]  when you're you know your cat comes and craps in my flower bed or vice versa you know it's just
[03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:29.640]  we need to get mad about real stuff folks like hydrofluorescent acid that brain damage you
[03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:35.560]  and gives you all sorts of bone problems being put in the water and I and they go that debate's
[03:03:35.560 --> 03:03:42.680]  not settled yeah it is or they say the debate settled fluoride is good for you and so is mercury
[03:03:46.520 --> 03:03:49.560]  if you're a new listener I'm not kidding I actually say mercury's good for kids on the news
[03:03:49.560 --> 03:03:57.240]  there's there's major inflation in the economy I mentioned this a lot but it's such a big deal
[03:03:57.240 --> 03:04:00.360]  we were just talking about this the other day the price of ground beef has doubled
[03:04:00.920 --> 03:04:06.200]  since the last financial crisis it's and that's on the national average it's actually gone up more
[03:04:06.920 --> 03:04:10.760]  because they'll get together in different regions and quietly agree to run up the prices on it
[03:04:11.400 --> 03:04:13.560]  I mean it's got to be triple what it was in Austin
[03:04:13.560 --> 03:04:19.720]  since the depths and see that's what computers can do computers and NSA garbage and all these
[03:04:19.720 --> 03:04:25.080]  companies doing their own spying on the public it's not market research it's gaming everything
[03:04:25.800 --> 03:04:30.760]  I mean you want to live in a game society this is it we're billions are spent a year on the
[03:04:30.760 --> 03:04:35.960]  school lunch program and then the kid the paid for food has maggots in it that's in the news today
[03:04:37.560 --> 03:04:40.760]  I mean that's what they offer you want to live in a big fat prison where you're safe
[03:04:40.760 --> 03:04:47.080]  like Chicago Southside welcome to hell all right I'm taping two reports that'll air tomorrow
[03:04:47.080 --> 03:04:51.320]  when David Knight's in here live spread the word they're going to be key please tell everybody
[03:04:51.320 --> 03:04:55.880]  about the show the enemy does not want this to be on the air that's because it's veritas and it hurts
[03:04:55.880 --> 03:05:11.880]  them bad you
