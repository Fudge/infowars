[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:20.640]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:20.640 --> 00:30.640]  jones welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night and it's thursday
[00:30.640 --> 00:36.080]  february 27th 2014 i'll be filling in for alex today but we have an amazing show
[00:36.960 --> 00:41.120]  we've got some breaking investigative report coming up in the second hour
[00:41.680 --> 00:46.800]  you're not going to want to miss this you know we've got even rachel madow and cnn asking questions
[00:46.800 --> 00:52.160]  about the boston bombing now can you imagine that that's pretty much a change isn't it
[00:52.160 --> 00:57.040]  things have changed a lot in the last year they've gone from mocking alex to asking questions
[00:57.680 --> 01:03.760]  about a suspect ibrahim toteshev who's picked up by the fbi for questioning tells everybody
[01:03.760 --> 01:08.160]  they're going to kill me to get shot six times i believe it was once in the back of the head
[01:08.160 --> 01:13.840]  i mean we need to look into this there's a lot of questions about both the boston bombing
[01:13.840 --> 01:19.760]  and sandy hook about how the government used it about assassination of a witness in the case of
[01:19.760 --> 01:25.600]  the boston bombing a lot a lot of issues now we've got today coming up in the second hour
[01:26.240 --> 01:32.480]  wolfgang halbig now wolfgang halbig is a former state trooper he's a former educator and he's a
[01:32.480 --> 01:37.360]  school safety consultant he's not an investigative reporter you know usually we see these kind of
[01:37.360 --> 01:43.440]  details come out years maybe decades after the event there was an excellent excellent documentary
[01:43.440 --> 01:50.240]  on the oklahoma city bombing we carry that here at info wars but a lot of times it takes a very
[01:50.240 --> 01:55.360]  long time for these investigations to be put together by investigative journalists this guy
[01:55.360 --> 02:00.640]  wolfgang halbig as i said was has both experience in law enforcement and education he is a school
[02:00.640 --> 02:06.880]  safety consultant and so when the sandy hooks shooting happened he investigated it just as he
[02:06.880 --> 02:12.400]  investigated columbine and other school shootings to find out what went wrong what could be changed
[02:12.400 --> 02:18.560]  how could he advise schools to keep that from happening and what he found was amazing and
[02:18.560 --> 02:22.560]  you're going to want to hear this when he comes in the detail that he has about what happened at
[02:22.560 --> 02:26.320]  sandy hook it makes you question the entire narrative and we've questioned it from the very
[02:26.320 --> 02:31.680]  beginning i remember i had just been here a couple of months when it happened and everything changed
[02:31.680 --> 02:39.040]  i mean alex doubled down on this like i've never seen before since he knew it was on he knew this
[02:39.040 --> 02:44.800]  was a false flag set up to take our gun rights away and they have been pretty successful in some
[02:44.800 --> 02:50.000]  of the northeastern areas we've got the safe act got passed in new york we see what's going on in
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.280]  connecticut they're now said we're going to register firearms and then they're confiscating them right
[02:55.280 --> 02:59.680]  away from people who haven't turned them in and we saw that amazing letter that alex talked about
[02:59.680 --> 03:04.080]  yesterday it was written on the second of january and said we didn't receive your
[03:04.080 --> 03:08.160]  applicant your registration by the first of january so now you have the option of proving
[03:08.160 --> 03:12.480]  to us that you've destroyed them or we're going to come get them or you can turn them in it's just
[03:12.480 --> 03:18.000]  amazing as we've always said registration is a prelude to confiscation what's going on in
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.680]  connecticut with these gun rules as well as sandy hook and the subsequent investigation
[03:24.400 --> 03:30.240]  when he tried to find out about this wolfgang halbig wasn't just stonewalled they didn't just
[03:30.240 --> 03:37.120]  ignore his legal request freedom of information act requests they actually threatened him on the phone
[03:37.120 --> 03:43.200]  and got police officers in florida where he lives to visit his house twice to tell him to stop
[03:43.200 --> 03:47.680]  investigating stop filing these things or they were going to put criminal charges on him for
[03:47.680 --> 03:53.680]  asking information that's absolutely amazing and we're also going to be joined at the in this hour
[03:53.680 --> 03:57.760]  with paul joseph watson he's going to be talking about what's going on the ukraine we've got
[03:57.760 --> 04:04.080]  developments there with the imf they're now making their move they can smell just they can smell the
[04:04.080 --> 04:09.200]  opportunity to get in and control that country just like blood and the water so we're going to
[04:09.200 --> 04:14.320]  talk into paul joseph watson about that about the tensions that are being manufactured by
[04:14.320 --> 04:21.120]  washington between the us and russia and we're also going to be talking in the third hour to jacari
[04:21.120 --> 04:27.600]  jackson and leon macadoo they'll be joining us in the studio now we've had some interesting news here
[04:27.600 --> 04:35.120]  in the last uh last couple of days about the what's going on in arizona and religious freedom
[04:35.120 --> 04:39.200]  and we've got a take on that right after we come back from break it's going to be a little bit
[04:39.200 --> 04:44.080]  different i've actually looked at the bill and i it's not exactly the way that's been portrayed
[04:44.080 --> 04:47.760]  in the media not at all the way it's been portrayed in the media we're going to talk about that
[04:47.760 --> 04:53.200]  and some other stories we got a hundred sailors now sick from fukushima the number is increasing

[08:38.160 --> 08:42.160]  welcome to the alex joe's show i'm david night filling in for alex today on this thursday
[08:42.160 --> 08:48.480]  february 27th 2014 hard to believe that we've already had two months of the new year go by
[08:48.480 --> 08:55.280]  it's going very very quickly now yesterday we had a lot of news about the battle for religious
[08:55.280 --> 08:59.280]  freedom everybody was waiting to see what the governor of arizona was going to do about this
[08:59.280 --> 09:05.040]  bill that had been passed in the legislature in arizona entitled relating to the free exercise
[09:05.040 --> 09:11.280]  of religion and i was very interested to see what this was all about so i actually got the
[09:11.280 --> 09:17.680]  bill and looked at it and you know when i googled the terms when i searched the terms uh sex that's
[09:17.680 --> 09:23.120]  not anywhere in there the term gay the term homosexual is not in there anywhere it's all
[09:23.120 --> 09:30.160]  about religious freedom and it's about whether or not we're going to allow private companies to be
[09:30.160 --> 09:34.640]  dictated to by government but we've already had that discussion haven't we and when we see that
[09:34.640 --> 09:41.840]  hobby lobby can be fined a million dollars a day because they don't want to provide abortion
[09:41.840 --> 09:46.080]  which they see as murder they don't want to provide that coverage to their employees
[09:46.080 --> 09:51.120]  but the obama administration says nope we don't care we're going to mandate that to you i mean
[09:51.120 --> 09:55.600]  certainly there's issues with just the idea that they're mandating coverage that we ought to stop
[09:55.600 --> 10:00.800]  at that point but then they go one step further and they violate the clear prohibitions against the
[10:00.800 --> 10:07.280]  free exercise of religion let's understand that the free exercise of religion protected in the
[10:07.280 --> 10:14.000]  first amendment it's not granted by the first amendment it is actually there to show us that
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.960]  the government is going to respect those fundamental rights that we have for free speech for freedom
[10:18.960 --> 10:24.960]  of religion for the right to protect ourselves for the right to keep government at bay these are
[10:24.960 --> 10:29.360]  negative rights these are not positive rights these are things that says government you cannot
[10:29.360 --> 10:33.200]  step on these rights that we already have these are not being granted by the government they're
[10:33.200 --> 10:38.320]  just being recognized by the government so it's important when we see how the government reacts
[10:38.320 --> 10:43.520]  to these things it tells us not whether or not we have those rights it tells us whether or not the
[10:43.520 --> 10:48.880]  government is going to act as a tyrant and we're seeing this over and over again how they're going
[10:48.880 --> 10:53.920]  to act so it was kind of interesting to look at this bill and one of the things that i came across
[10:53.920 --> 11:00.320]  as i'm looking through this it says that the state action may subsequently burden a person's
[11:00.320 --> 11:07.120]  exercise of religion only if the government or non-governmental person is both in furtherance
[11:07.120 --> 11:13.440]  of a compelling governmental interest oh wait a minute let's stop right there you mean you can
[11:14.080 --> 11:21.200]  substantially burden a person's exercise of religion if it's in furtherance of a compelling
[11:21.200 --> 11:27.840]  government interest are you serious that's not what the first amendment is about and to say that
[11:27.840 --> 11:34.080]  this is a bill for the free exercise of religion is not true this is simply a head fake for their
[11:34.080 --> 11:40.720]  base they know that their base is seeing religious freedom trampled everywhere so they want to do
[11:40.720 --> 11:46.960]  something to shore up that base that is if you read the actual bill was really very meaningless
[11:47.600 --> 11:53.520]  but that was not the way that it came down there was such an outrage that all the republican
[11:53.520 --> 12:00.640]  leadership mccain and arizona as well as even romney came out and opposed this bill and of course
[12:00.640 --> 12:07.680]  republican governor vetoed this bill because you know what this is fundamentally is about religion
[12:07.680 --> 12:12.960]  but there's a religion that's far more important today in america and that's the religion of
[12:13.680 --> 12:18.160]  bowing down before the homosexual community they're the ones who are setting the agenda
[12:18.160 --> 12:22.560]  they're the ones that you have to please and if they think that this is something that is going to
[12:22.560 --> 12:32.320]  impinge on their rights then you got to back off because even making points with your base as the
[12:32.320 --> 12:37.120]  republicans are simply trying to do with this meaningless bill even that has to back off if
[12:37.120 --> 12:41.200]  you're going to offend the homosexual community today and we saw some other interesting things
[12:41.200 --> 12:48.160]  here too we saw the nfl putting pressure on arizona saying if you pass a bill that is a weak
[12:48.160 --> 12:54.240]  restatement of religious liberty then we're going to pull the super bowl away so you see again the
[12:54.240 --> 13:01.360]  nfl is always there pushing the social agenda of the government pushing the control of the government
[13:01.360 --> 13:08.800]  pushing an anti-family agenda you know they would not allow a very very innocuous super bowl
[13:08.800 --> 13:15.360]  commercial that showed a man it's kind of a morning in america type of commercial a man coming home
[13:15.360 --> 13:21.680]  to his family protecting his family they would not show that they would not show a man exercising the
[13:22.480 --> 13:27.840]  fatherly protection of his family there wasn't any guns in it they weren't shooting things that was
[13:27.840 --> 13:33.920]  just that it was kind of a pastoral type of suburban pastoral scene where he comes home
[13:33.920 --> 13:40.400]  the nfl pulled that and it brings up the question of what does it mean for tolerance now the
[13:40.400 --> 13:47.680]  washington examiner quoted this and said our policies emphasize tolerance inclusiveness
[13:47.680 --> 13:53.520]  and prohibit discrimination based on age gender race religion sexual orientation or any other
[13:53.520 --> 13:57.440]  improper standard you know really are they really that tolerant of religion that was
[13:57.440 --> 14:02.960]  what the nfl said i looked up the word tolerance and it says that you're going to show willingness
[14:02.960 --> 14:07.840]  to allow the existence of opinions or behavior that one doesn't agree with but that's not what
[14:07.840 --> 14:14.640]  they want they want you to celebrate to subsidize their relation and that's why i have a problem
[14:14.640 --> 14:20.240]  with a lot of libertarians like gary johnson who will come in and make gay marriage one of their
[14:20.240 --> 14:26.640]  main issues it really is an infringement on the rights and the liberties of other people to say
[14:26.640 --> 14:30.640]  if you're going to tolerate the behavior that means that you're not going to make it a criminal
[14:30.640 --> 14:35.120]  action you're not going to intrude in people's lives but it also doesn't mean that you have to
[14:35.120 --> 14:40.160]  accept it that you have to celebrate it that you have to subsidize it i remember the first
[14:40.160 --> 14:45.040]  time i heard about gay marriage and that was when i was traveling with andre maru who was
[14:45.040 --> 14:49.680]  libertarian candidate at the time and we got that that question at a press conference and he said
[14:49.680 --> 14:55.120]  the only reason you're looking for this is because you want to force a private company to give you
[14:55.120 --> 15:00.800]  benefits that you are not willing to negotiate with in a voluntary way and he said and you're
[15:00.800 --> 15:04.640]  also trying to force the taxpayer to get the government to do that and you're trying to
[15:04.640 --> 15:11.280]  force people to to accept something that they fundamentally don't agree with that's not tolerance
[15:11.280 --> 15:17.040]  that's servitude and it was interesting to see that tucker carlson who is going to be on the
[15:17.040 --> 15:23.280]  show tomorrow he's going to be in studio he's the editor of the daily caller and long time
[15:23.280 --> 15:27.760]  correspondent commentator on network television he's going to be in studio tomorrow with alex jones
[15:27.760 --> 15:34.400]  and he was raked over the coals when he gave the example of somebody being forced to
[15:34.960 --> 15:39.360]  make a wedding cake or take wedding pictures of a homosexual wedding that they didn't want to
[15:39.360 --> 15:45.120]  take pictures of and being sued by that and it's amazing when you look at a situation like this
[15:45.120 --> 15:50.400]  this is what the uh the respondent said to that the the other side of the argument came from
[15:51.360 --> 15:55.840]  the uh the anchor in this program to call him and she said well you're either open for business
[15:55.840 --> 16:00.000]  or you're not open for business you can't choose based on different criteria you know
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.720]  i remember a time in america when people had signs up and i think a lot of places still do
[16:04.720 --> 16:09.200]  we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone we want i don't know why they would do that
[16:09.840 --> 16:14.800]  because they're in it to make money i remember when i was a young child they had a one business
[16:14.800 --> 16:19.280]  a convenience store would not allow junior high school students in their in their store
[16:19.280 --> 16:23.840]  and even after i got older i never went back i don't know why a businessman would do that
[16:23.840 --> 16:30.320]  but if they want to make that decision that's their choice and tucker carlson said it's called
[16:30.320 --> 16:35.040]  tolerance when you try to force me to bake a cake for your gay wedding and threaten me with prison
[16:35.040 --> 16:41.520]  if i don't make it that's called fascism it really is fascism you know fascism isn't just
[16:41.520 --> 16:47.840]  extreme nationalism fascism has an economic component to it that means that tentatively you
[16:47.840 --> 16:53.200]  have private property but really you don't have control over that the government has control over
[16:53.200 --> 16:59.440]  it that's why we're really going into fascism in this country where the government dictates
[16:59.440 --> 17:05.360]  everything that you can do you don't really have any private property now we also got coming up in
[17:05.360 --> 17:10.640]  this program on the second hour we've got wolfgang halbig and he's going to be talking to us about
[17:10.640 --> 17:17.040]  his sandy hook investigation it's amazing to see that the mainstream media is now starting to question
[17:17.040 --> 17:24.400]  the boston bombing narrative and question the fact that you had the fbi pick up a witness to the
[17:24.400 --> 17:28.080]  boston bombing somebody that they said they were going to take in for questioning he told his friends
[17:28.080 --> 17:32.400]  they're going to kill me and in fact he wound up being shot multiple times once in the back of the
[17:32.400 --> 17:37.920]  head you've got even rachel madow talking about this now it's pretty amazing maybe she sees the
[17:37.920 --> 17:44.000]  handwriting on the wall as pierce morgan bit the dust but she really hit this and it's better late
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.400]  than never let's listen to some of the things that she said on the msnbc show that she has
[17:50.480 --> 17:57.040]  you guys got that clip in january fbi director james comey announced that the bureau had completed
[17:57.040 --> 18:02.320]  its shooting review in this man's death he was shot while being questioned by the fbi and other
[18:02.320 --> 18:06.720]  law enforcement authorities back in may i'm going to show you a couple photos which i should warn
[18:06.720 --> 18:12.560]  you are a little bit graphic and might be disturbing um but from these photos that were taken of
[18:12.560 --> 18:18.080]  the young man's body in the morgue it appears that he was shot seven times including once
[18:18.080 --> 18:24.000]  in the top of the head law enforcement officials have said that the man was himself unarmed when
[18:24.000 --> 18:29.600]  the fbi shot and killed him and although the fbi's report on this man's shooting is reportedly ready
[18:29.600 --> 18:34.240]  to go according to james comey he says the report on that shooting has been completed it still has
[18:34.240 --> 18:40.080]  not been released the fbi even blocked the county medical examiner from releasing the autopsy report
[18:40.080 --> 18:45.200]  in this case even though it was completed and ready to go and again these images are graphic
[18:45.200 --> 18:50.720]  i'll warn you again but the reason we have to count the bullet holes ourselves looking at these
[18:50.720 --> 18:55.200]  photographs in order to try to figure out what happened here is because the fbi won't let that
[18:55.200 --> 19:00.240]  autopsy report be released the county's happy to release it the fbi is stopping them from doing so
[19:00.960 --> 19:05.520]  the reason we have those photographs taken in the morgue is because a friend of the dead man
[19:05.520 --> 19:10.240]  took those photos himself when he went to identify the body and then he brought the photos to the
[19:10.240 --> 19:15.760]  dead man's father and it was the dead man's father who then released the photographs publicly
[19:15.760 --> 19:21.520]  demanding answers about why the fbi had shot and killed his son why he had to get shot apparently
[19:21.520 --> 19:27.440]  seven times including the top of the head when he himself was unarmed and that is where the story
[19:27.440 --> 19:32.720]  goes from sort of weird and worrying to intensely weird and worrying because the man who was killed
[19:32.720 --> 19:37.600]  by the fbi in this condo in orlando florida he was an immigrant from russia he was living here
[19:37.600 --> 19:42.320]  legally but his family is still in russia and when he died his family held his funeral in russia
[19:42.320 --> 19:46.480]  and the friend who had identified his body in the morgue and who took those photos in the morgue
[19:46.480 --> 19:51.680]  to give to the man's father he attended the funeral in russia he left the us to go to the funeral
[19:51.680 --> 19:56.160]  in russia even though that man has a green card and lives here in the u.s legally and is legally
[19:56.160 --> 20:00.320]  allowed to travel in and out of the united states after that funeral he was not allowed

[24:20.800 --> 24:24.640]  joined in just a few minutes by paul joseph watson from london and he's going to be talking
[24:24.640 --> 24:29.920]  to us about what's going on in the ukraine we see the imf smells the problems they see an
[24:29.920 --> 24:35.360]  opportunity it's like blood in the water they're coming in to get them in debt to the bankers and
[24:35.360 --> 24:40.160]  of course we've been telling you and many others have been telling you that we believe that this
[24:40.160 --> 24:45.680]  was set up by the bankers in the first place to get them in the sphere and influence of the eu you
[24:45.680 --> 24:51.200]  know they might want to watch the debate that's coming up between nigel ferange and nick clag in
[24:51.200 --> 24:57.360]  the uk now of course we've talked to nigel ferange here on the radio show many times a masterful
[24:57.360 --> 25:04.240]  debater this guy is amazing and he goes right to the heart of the eu he's elected to the eu as an
[25:04.240 --> 25:10.720]  opponent to the eu and he's the guy who stands up and calls them out on their takeovers of countries
[25:10.720 --> 25:17.920]  like greece and idly where they take out duly elected prime ministers and put in goldman sacks
[25:17.920 --> 25:25.440]  bankers it's just amazing what they're doing in the eu so before the ukraine throws itself into the
[25:25.440 --> 25:32.320]  eu basket they ought to take a look at what's being done in countries like greece like idly
[25:32.320 --> 25:36.080]  see what the bankers are doing there and of course now the bankers are starting to come in
[25:36.080 --> 25:40.800]  offering them the lure of money to try to get them under their control just as they've done
[25:40.800 --> 25:45.680]  the united states and so many other countries so we'll be talking to paul joseph watson at the
[25:45.680 --> 25:51.920]  bottom of the hour about that now we went out in the last segment with a clip from rachel madow
[25:52.880 --> 25:59.680]  and she's questioning the assassination and folks if you're picked up by the fbi and you tell people
[25:59.680 --> 26:05.600]  they're going to kill me and you're in a room full of fbi agents you're unarmed and you get shot
[26:05.600 --> 26:11.920]  six times and then once in the back of the head that's an execution folks that's not a questioning
[26:11.920 --> 26:18.160]  that's exactly what he knew was going to happen and it's about time that somebody in the mainstream
[26:18.160 --> 26:22.320]  media complained about that you know they're i think rachel madow came around to do this because
[26:22.320 --> 26:29.520]  it just looks ridiculous for them to ignore this they're losing all their credibility that's why
[26:29.520 --> 26:34.160]  pierce morgan's ratings were down in the tank he had no credibility so i think they see the
[26:34.160 --> 26:39.280]  handwriting on the wall i think they need see that they need to do that even cnn even cnn that was
[26:40.080 --> 26:45.680]  really twisting and and turning the government's narrative on both sandy hook and the boston bombing
[26:45.680 --> 26:50.880]  even cnn is questioning this let's play a little bit of this clip from cnn where they're questioning
[26:50.880 --> 26:57.040]  the boston bombing and the events surrounding that on cnn do they perhaps then not see that
[26:57.040 --> 27:02.320]  there's a wider role that toteshev and others may not have had anything to do with the bombings
[27:02.320 --> 27:08.960]  at the marathon like i told you before all we have is this one official statement that's the fbi's
[27:08.960 --> 27:15.840]  contention that ibrahim toteshev implicated tamerlin sarnaev in that grisly grisly triple murder and
[27:15.840 --> 27:22.160]  wall fem and so you have to sit there's a lot of questions here i mean my investigation starts
[27:22.160 --> 27:26.880]  with wall fem and there are a lot of leads that local officials didn't go through there and then
[27:26.880 --> 27:32.080]  it ends in actually late fall where i find the fbi's still reaching out to ibrahim toteshev's
[27:32.080 --> 27:39.200]  friends asking him very very basic questions about the boston well while that may have been
[27:39.200 --> 27:45.200]  you know at least some respite for these victims families in wall fem who have been waiting and
[27:45.200 --> 27:50.320]  waiting for some sort of solution i don't think that was i think that's where you're wrong it's
[27:50.320 --> 27:56.160]  not at all i mean the victims families are really really hurting i mean we had a let me just let
[27:56.160 --> 28:00.240]  me just ask you one question that there was one spot where i just stopped and my mouth dropped
[28:00.240 --> 28:05.920]  open and that was this the girlfriend of toteshev is perhaps the only person who can give us any
[28:05.920 --> 28:13.360]  insight what his reaction was when he heard about the bombings i.e did she suspect he may have known
[28:13.360 --> 28:18.960]  something about it when he heard about the bombings and the death of tamerlin that maybe
[28:18.960 --> 28:24.400]  something was afoot all she says she told me as she was in the condo with him and he heard about
[28:24.400 --> 28:30.560]  the boston marathon bombings it seemingly after tamerlin sir and i have died and he was very very
[28:30.560 --> 28:36.400]  sad maybe just sad for the death of a friend or sad for the reality of it all i mean she's hard to
[28:36.400 --> 28:41.920]  say i mean it's hard to say we we we just know that they were they were good friends and um
[28:42.560 --> 28:47.520]  there's a lot of questions here this is as good friends it's amazing he wasn't investigated back
[28:47.520 --> 28:52.160]  in 2011 it's a great piece you've done a lot of work i highly recommend uh people take a look
[28:52.160 --> 28:56.960]  there is a lot that you have uncovered and you've written about it well that's it yeah that's cnn
[28:56.960 --> 29:02.320]  folks that's cnn taking critical look at the government's narrative about the boston bombing
[29:03.120 --> 29:07.920]  they were set up they were working with the cia you can see them going back and forth into russia
[29:07.920 --> 29:12.960]  you can see russia asking them questions about this just as the american government is doing in
[29:12.960 --> 29:19.680]  the ukraine they've been pushing in chechnya you've got uncle sarnayev who is married to the head of
[29:19.680 --> 29:25.520]  the cia station in that area i mean come on this is this is as phony as it gets folks
[29:25.520 --> 29:30.320]  and the government is not above their own conspiracies we've got them saying that barrett brown and
[29:30.320 --> 29:35.360]  anonymous were plotting to overthrow the government how absurd does it get they got barrett browning
[29:35.360 --> 29:42.800]  in jail in dalis because he's linked to some data on a website can they throw people in jail for that
[29:42.800 --> 29:47.680]  our government is out of control we're going to be right back with paul joseph watson stay tuned

[33:30.560 --> 33:37.600]  today on this thursday february 27th 2014 i'm going to be joined here by paul joseph watson who
[33:38.320 --> 33:44.160]  is one of our writers here as well as a reporter and he's an expert on what's going on in europe
[33:44.160 --> 33:49.920]  with the imf with the e you and with the ukraine and so paul has published many stories about this
[33:49.920 --> 33:55.760]  as it's developing talking about the how the bankers are trying to get the ukraine under their
[33:55.760 --> 34:02.800]  control we also see how the us is trying to increase tension between russia and america
[34:02.800 --> 34:07.120]  and of course that serves the interest of the military industrial complex as well doesn't it
[34:07.840 --> 34:12.400]  it was they were searching around for a mission once the soviet union fell apart and they didn't
[34:12.400 --> 34:18.160]  have a credible enemy anymore so now they're creating credible enemies everywhere just like
[34:18.160 --> 34:24.320]  they've done since world war two so joining us now is paul joseph watson paul how you doing hi david
[34:24.320 --> 34:30.320]  good to be back great to have you now you want to talk about the imf and they're jumping into the
[34:30.320 --> 34:35.840]  water here offering all kinds of money to the ukraine people just come on in and sign on the
[34:35.840 --> 34:40.000]  bottom line right it's like a kid that just graduated from college getting all these credit
[34:40.000 --> 34:47.920]  card offers right then it's amazing david the situation right now is we've seen the
[34:47.920 --> 34:55.440]  foe revolution stirred up by the west by the ngo was by the united states by britain now we're
[34:55.440 --> 35:01.120]  seeing the counter revolution which is being stirred up by russia and which is centered in the
[35:01.120 --> 35:07.760]  in the Crimea the area of ukraine to the south where russia has a naval base so we've basically
[35:07.760 --> 35:15.760]  got a massive arms buildup with russia preparing fighter jets on combat alerts they've put out
[35:15.760 --> 35:22.800]  statements saying they've got 150 000 troops ready for a drill ukraine is warning against that
[35:22.800 --> 35:28.880]  military buildup as is the united states we've got deployment of a u.s aircraft carrier which was
[35:28.880 --> 35:35.520]  planned in advance but some are saying it's related to the building tension and then we've got the fact
[35:35.520 --> 35:41.520]  and this is the key to this entire story on info wars dot com central banker appointed as prime
[35:41.520 --> 35:49.680]  minister of ukraine three weeks ago the top u.s state department diplomat in europe victoria
[35:49.680 --> 35:55.760]  newland was involved in a leaked phone conversation with another top u.s diplomat and they were
[35:55.760 --> 36:03.120]  basically plotting the overthrow of the democratically elected ukrainian government and the very person
[36:03.120 --> 36:08.640]  that newland named in that leaked phone conversation that they would choose to become
[36:08.640 --> 36:15.520]  the new prime minister of the ukraine arsnit yatsenyuk is now the new head of the ukraine so the
[36:15.520 --> 36:22.720]  very person they named three weeks in advance is now in power proving once again that this was an
[36:22.720 --> 36:28.240]  act of regime change oh yeah and it was even more than that paul you know i had steve pacinic on
[36:28.240 --> 36:34.480]  the nightly news and i talked to him about that phone conversation that supposedly was just amazing
[36:34.480 --> 36:39.680]  tradecraft and the the american administration said i just can't believe that the russians would
[36:39.680 --> 36:43.360]  listen to our phones like that steve pacinic said that was the funniest thing you've ever heard of
[36:43.360 --> 36:48.560]  the fact that they would do this on an open line they wanted the russians to know this
[36:48.560 --> 36:55.120]  they wanted the world to know this it was an in-your-face demonstration it was provocative
[36:55.120 --> 37:00.480]  it was trying to uh it is basically just hubris but it's also very provocative they're trying to
[37:00.480 --> 37:07.360]  provoke tension between the u.s and russia not just pull the ukraine out of the russia sphere but
[37:07.360 --> 37:13.600]  the Crimea is vitally important to russia because that's their access to to water to the black sea
[37:15.040 --> 37:22.160]  well it would be like russia stirring up a revolution in canada or mexico or even you
[37:22.160 --> 37:26.960]  could think about it if scotland gained independence it would be like russia stirring up a revolution
[37:26.960 --> 37:34.400]  in scotland targeting england it's that sensitive because the ukraine is fundamentally linked to
[37:34.400 --> 37:40.880]  russia historically it's been part of russia for the majority of the past 100 years of course
[37:40.880 --> 37:48.000]  and as he said this this leaked phone conversation the media treatment of it was the fact that newland
[37:48.000 --> 37:54.640]  said f the u and that's what all the headlines became about oh my god she's saying f the f the u
[37:54.640 --> 38:00.960]  that wasn't the story the story was they were picking by name the future leaders of ukraine
[38:00.960 --> 38:06.160]  in the overthrow the coup d'etat that they were planning and now we see that that's come to pass
[38:06.160 --> 38:11.680]  even though russia started this counter-revolution against it as part of the new cold war that is
[38:11.680 --> 38:19.920]  emerging the NATO encirclement of russia now that that's come to pass in its first stage the imf is
[38:19.920 --> 38:26.400]  circling the wagons its vultures are preparing to swoop on ukraine to asset strip the country
[38:26.400 --> 38:33.280]  as part of their tried and tested imf riot plan as greg palast exposed back in 2001
[38:33.840 --> 38:40.720]  and today the associated press reports that the imf is sending ukris officials to the ukraine
[38:40.720 --> 38:46.400]  to start discussing with the ukrainian authorities which policy reforms would be required in exchange
[38:46.400 --> 38:53.600]  for an emergency loan program so in in other words again just as they did in greece this is about
[38:53.600 --> 39:00.400]  turning ukraine into the imf the globalist debt slave by creating the loan shark environment where
[39:00.400 --> 39:05.840]  they have to sell off infrastructure they have to impose draconian austerity measures high taxes
[39:05.840 --> 39:12.080]  on their population as happened in greece and install technocrats in the government who basically
[39:12.080 --> 39:16.640]  served as puppets to the imf to the globalist absolutely you know bloomberg reports that
[39:16.640 --> 39:21.840]  they're going to give that they're offering them a 35 billion dollar deal and of course
[39:21.840 --> 39:25.600]  that's much better than what the russians were giving them the russians were only giving them
[39:25.600 --> 39:30.640]  15 billion dollars that they've halted so they're going to get them totally in debt like you just
[39:30.640 --> 39:35.520]  mentioned they're going to raise their taxes they're going to control their country and they may
[39:35.520 --> 39:42.000]  wind up with a situation you know the one of the uh previous uh premiers in the ukraine was formally a
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.480]  central banker in the ukraine so he was the one who was on the other side from yunukovic
[39:46.480 --> 39:50.880]  and uh ryanikovic i don't know if i've got the infosys on the right syllable there but i always
[39:50.880 --> 39:56.640]  get confused about the russian names but the uh but he was a central banker the guy for the opposing
[39:56.640 --> 40:01.440]  party but he was a ukraine central banker these are the guys who've already spent what is it
[40:01.440 --> 40:07.360]  paul five billion dollars to start this revolution there yeah i mean newland announced back in
[40:07.360 --> 40:12.480]  december around the same time that john mccain went to ukraine and was buddy buddy with all
[40:12.480 --> 40:17.680]  these nazis that are part of the opposition movement newland announced that the u.s had
[40:17.680 --> 40:24.240]  already invested five billion dollars in the protest movement in ukraine so again that shows
[40:24.240 --> 40:28.720]  you they were prepared for this the initial protest started of course back in november when
[40:28.720 --> 40:34.880]  ukraine rejected the eu trade deal and went with russia but before that they knew that this was
[40:34.880 --> 40:41.920]  coming because research shows and this is linked in my article that these democratic uprisings
[40:41.920 --> 40:46.880]  whatever you want to call them whether they're grassroots or not whether they're grassroots
[40:46.880 --> 40:53.360]  to begin with and then hijacked by western powers at a later date they're entirely predictable
[40:53.360 --> 41:00.080]  because they're linked to the rising food prices you can track where unrest is going to happen in
[41:00.080 --> 41:06.960]  countries around the world based on if food prices rise above a certain level which is the
[41:06.960 --> 41:12.800]  un food and agriculture organizations food price index whenever that index rises above
[41:12.800 --> 41:17.760]  two ten the unrest quickly follows in all these different countries you can track it from
[41:17.760 --> 41:24.320]  Syria tunisia of course with the arab spring and most recently thailand venezuela and you
[41:24.320 --> 41:29.760]  guessed it ukraine so they know ahead of time when these uprisings are really going to pick
[41:29.760 --> 41:35.200]  up steam so even if you believe which of course a lot of these euro made and protesters are
[41:35.680 --> 41:40.400]  dupes they're useful idiots even if you believe that it's an organic uprising to begin with
[41:40.800 --> 41:46.640]  these democratic revolutions as they call them are seen years in advance by the u.s state
[41:46.640 --> 41:53.520]  department which is why the state department knew as far back as 2008 that the arab spring was
[41:53.520 --> 41:59.440]  coming which is why they had some of their top operators with these ngo's also linked to the
[41:59.440 --> 42:06.880]  cfr like larry diamond actually training the arab spring leaders on how to effectively use
[42:06.880 --> 42:13.360]  twitter and facebook to stir up these revolutions and as i documented in my expose of the iam
[42:13.360 --> 42:21.360]  a ukrainian pr stunt the very same individual larry diamond cfr member linked to the state
[42:21.360 --> 42:27.360]  department has done extensive work for the ned national endowment for democracy he was the one
[42:27.360 --> 42:33.840]  behind this viral video which was basically glib propaganda trying to portray the uprising in
[42:33.840 --> 42:41.200]  ukraine as exactly that just a grassroots democratic uprising when in fact he was the one years ago
[42:41.200 --> 42:48.640]  training arab spring activists on behalf of the u.s state department on how to foment fo revolutions
[42:48.640 --> 42:56.240]  and in fact they did it in the very same hotel that we visited last year for bill deberg because
[42:56.240 --> 43:03.520]  we spoke to the hotel staff the manager and he said yeah we had all these guys here back in 2008
[43:03.520 --> 43:09.680]  talking about the arab spring three years before it happened so they know when these riots are coming
[43:09.680 --> 43:15.120]  they have people prepared to train the leaders and of course soros has opened society institute
[43:15.120 --> 43:20.560]  is involved in that as well on the ground with the actual protesters so they know how to manage
[43:20.560 --> 43:26.160]  these controlled uprisings even if they're grassroots to begin with well it's very interesting
[43:26.160 --> 43:31.680]  that you mentioned that they see this as a leading indicator the price of food because we just see
[43:31.680 --> 43:38.080]  in the news today that cattle futures in the u.s have hit a record level and we see that there's a
[43:38.080 --> 43:42.960]  real war on independent farms here in america we've got some articles about that that we've
[43:42.960 --> 43:47.920]  been covering on the nightly news the last week or so they're coming after farmers and just so
[43:47.920 --> 43:53.360]  many different levels and it reminds me of what happened in the ukraine you know stallons approach
[43:53.360 --> 43:58.160]  the ukraine and one of the the gripes that the ukrainian people have that is a legitimate gripe
[43:58.160 --> 44:03.280]  as they remember the whole lot of more the starvation that was propagated against the ukrainian
[44:03.280 --> 44:10.000]  people under Stalin we see however some of these same tactics that are going to be used here in
[44:10.000 --> 44:14.800]  america where you've got the government coming in and shutting down farms over nonsense reasons
[44:14.800 --> 44:20.240]  they're now telling organic farmers that they can't use manure or have animals plow their fields
[44:20.240 --> 44:25.200]  this has been going on for millennia that this has happened but now you're going to have to buy
[44:25.200 --> 44:29.760]  commercial fertilizer that sort of thing but we see the the price is going on here we see the
[44:29.760 --> 44:35.600]  preparation in america that is our government giving military vehicles to police departments
[44:35.600 --> 44:41.040]  buying billions of rounds of hollow point ammunition not target rounds as you pointed out you were
[44:41.040 --> 44:46.080]  the spearheading those that research paul it's very worrying to see these kind of leading
[44:46.080 --> 44:52.400]  indicators coming here but besides just the ukrainian people getting out of the control of
[44:52.400 --> 44:58.080]  one gang of thugs and under the control of these bankers in europe these central bankers
[44:58.080 --> 45:03.440]  goldman sacks and others the other aspect of this is the military buildup you had an article
[45:03.440 --> 45:09.600]  today about russia puts fighter jets on combat alert as tensions mount i mean the the crimea
[45:09.600 --> 45:15.200]  is vitally important to the russians from a strategic standpoint just as ukraine is from a food
[45:15.200 --> 45:22.560]  standpoint precisely and that that's the biggest danger isn't it and now a lot of top analysts
[45:22.560 --> 45:26.720]  are saying this is the start of a new cold war yes you could see it coming beforehand
[45:26.720 --> 45:31.440]  because russia and china have been engaged in some of the biggest military buildups
[45:31.440 --> 45:38.080]  and aggressive military rhetoric for the past decade or so i mean i've written several articles
[45:38.080 --> 45:45.920]  over the past few months china conducting attacks on mock u.s. aircraft carriers that putting out
[45:45.920 --> 45:52.160]  editorials in state media talking about how the president of china is preparing the pl a for a new
[45:52.160 --> 45:59.520]  giant war and then you had the display for the recent land rover program in china where the
[45:59.520 --> 46:07.200]  backdrop for the image was a picture of a mushroom cloud over europe it was just an accident but
[46:07.200 --> 46:14.320]  continued state media editorials in chinese media talking about targeting the u.s. militarily china
[46:14.320 --> 46:19.760]  of course just got its first actual aircraft carrier they're talking about building more of
[46:19.760 --> 46:28.160]  those so it's iran russia and china lined up against the united states it is a new cold war
[46:28.160 --> 46:35.280]  and the fact that neo liberals and neo conservatives are willing to foster that by antagonizing russia
[46:35.280 --> 46:42.400]  by fostering this revolution right on its border just shows how insanely diabolical
[46:42.400 --> 46:47.280]  their plans are and the fact that they have no genuine concern about the future of the world
[46:47.280 --> 46:52.960]  because they're creating a situation which could go hot very very soon now we've got analysts
[46:52.960 --> 46:59.440]  even bbc analysts talking about a quote hot a war in ukraine so well the war is a life
[46:59.440 --> 47:04.720]  part of this the war is life by the state isn't it and you've got both the american government
[47:04.720 --> 47:09.520]  as well as the chinese government as well as the russian government they all can make themselves
[47:09.520 --> 47:15.200]  more important than everybody's lives if they create fear about an outbreak of war
[47:15.200 --> 47:21.680]  create fear about an outbreak of war but again you see in this build-up here in the ukraine
[47:22.480 --> 47:27.760]  if that fosters another cold war that fosters another military build-up with a military industrial
[47:27.760 --> 47:32.960]  complex who benefits from that well of course the same bankers that are trying to get control
[47:32.960 --> 47:40.240]  of the ukraine isn't it well precisely and it also distracts from domestic unrest in america
[47:40.240 --> 47:47.120]  because as you were talking about before again the the food price issue in america once that builds
[47:47.120 --> 47:52.480]  once people's wallets begin to be hit more and more there is a potential for unrest i mean i
[47:52.480 --> 47:58.160]  did the article yesterday pat caddell former presidential advisor and pollster basically
[47:58.160 --> 48:03.200]  said that the soft oppression that americans are currently experiencing could lead to a
[48:03.200 --> 48:10.720]  Kiev style uprising in the united states and then of course you have the us army building fake towns
[48:10.720 --> 48:17.680]  96 million dollars worth yeah with churches you know municipal buildings underground subways
[48:17.680 --> 48:22.640]  for the army to train to deal with domestic unrest of course it's passed off in the media
[48:22.640 --> 48:28.160]  oh there's a mosque well yeah there was a mosque there was also a christian church so it it's
[48:28.160 --> 48:34.640]  multifaceted yes it's for foreign occupation but it's also for domestic preparation because we know
[48:34.640 --> 48:40.800]  that fort hood soldiers and others are being trained that christians tea party supporters
[48:40.800 --> 48:46.080]  anti-abortion activists are a radical terror threat we've had those articles in the past
[48:47.040 --> 48:53.360]  department of homeland security of course in its own funded document describes liberty lovers
[48:53.360 --> 48:59.600]  that's their quote liberty lovers as domestic extremists links them alongside terrorists
[48:59.600 --> 49:04.480]  so yeah you have the federal government in the united states that's increasingly paranoid about
[49:04.480 --> 49:09.600]  its own citizens which is why they can unite the country around an external threat which
[49:09.600 --> 49:15.040]  again benefits the military industrial complex yeah you know we we tried to get them to talk to us
[49:15.040 --> 49:19.600]  at the asymmetric warfare center there in virginia where they built that city you know
[49:19.600 --> 49:25.440]  polo was originally going to be like 60 million dollars and they went 50 over budget on that
[49:26.160 --> 49:30.000]  but we wanted to ask them some questions about that i wanted to see if they really did have a
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.280]  mosque did you ever see a picture of a mosque there because all i saw was the footage that they put
[49:35.280 --> 49:40.880]  out we use that we use that in our report but all i saw was a small town christian church did you
[49:40.880 --> 49:44.720]  see any other pictures that actually showed a mosque or did they say that they had a mosque other than
[49:44.720 --> 49:50.400]  the article that i saw the pic the picture of the mosque with the minaret but they also had as
[49:50.400 --> 49:56.400]  you said a christian church so yeah we're all being targeted whether it's muslims in the middle
[49:56.400 --> 50:02.400]  east or americans at home i don't think you find many small christian churches like that in a lot
[50:02.400 --> 50:08.080]  of muslim countries so yeah it's it's targeting all of us oh well it's clearly an american city
[50:08.080 --> 50:15.360]  they had handicap parking signs they had speed limit signs they had a subway there with the logo
[50:15.360 --> 50:21.520]  from the washington dc subway i mean everything was very very detailed i found another video
[50:21.520 --> 50:26.400]  where they were actually laying down the slab when they were under the construction process
[50:26.400 --> 50:31.920]  and it actually showed them stubbing up electrical and plumbing i mean these are not shells of
[50:31.920 --> 50:36.640]  buildings like they have trained with in the past this is something where they are training
[50:36.640 --> 50:42.960]  they see us as the insurgents in an asymmetric warfare and it's very clear based on the research
[50:42.960 --> 50:47.680]  that you've done about the ammunition purchases what we see happening with these military vehicles
[50:47.680 --> 50:51.760]  when we come back i want to ask you about what's going on in scotland we just reported on this a
[50:51.760 --> 50:58.160]  year ago but now scotland has passed a law that has tremendous implications for parents we're

[54:41.200 --> 54:48.240]  been talking about the imf and the international bankers making their move as they've been telegraphing
[54:48.240 --> 54:52.880]  for quite some time now it's become very obvious they've actually put a price tag on it 35 million
[54:52.880 --> 54:58.560]  dollars that's the price of the freedom of the ukrainian people they're going to loot them and
[54:58.560 --> 55:03.040]  rob them five different ways as they've always done everybody when they come in and take over
[55:03.040 --> 55:07.280]  but now paul i wanted to talk to you about this law that just passed we covered this when it came
[55:07.280 --> 55:14.720]  out a year ago practically in april last year they were putting forth a bill in scotland called
[55:14.720 --> 55:19.920]  the children and young people's bill and of course this is going to this this now passed
[55:19.920 --> 55:27.600]  just within the last week and it is going to assign a government guardian to every child
[55:27.600 --> 55:35.600]  in scotland from birth until 18 years old that's amazing i tell you know there's there's a lot of
[55:35.600 --> 55:40.160]  reaction from that from the christian community there from people who understand the purpose of
[55:40.160 --> 55:46.320]  the family and who are concerned about government intrusions in the family what's your take on this
[55:46.320 --> 55:53.360]  paul well david i mean this is chilling cradle to grave tyranny imagine if they uncovered an obama
[55:53.360 --> 55:58.320]  care regulation which said oh by the way the government has a minder assigned to every child
[55:58.320 --> 56:03.760]  in the united states up to the age of 18 there would be an outcry yet this bill has passed
[56:03.760 --> 56:11.280]  largely unopposed in scotland every child the nhs will appoint a health worker to act as a named
[56:11.280 --> 56:17.040]  person a guardian for every child up until the age of five then it passes over to the local
[56:17.040 --> 56:23.360]  government council they will assign individuals to monitor every single child in scotland to
[56:23.360 --> 56:28.480]  quote ensure any potential cases of abuse or developmental difficulties are spotted and
[56:28.480 --> 56:37.440]  acted upon what does that mean well in the uk just as in the us with the cps they steal children to
[56:37.440 --> 56:45.920]  meet quotas in the uk case of the uk it's adoption quotas we've had a case just in the past week
[56:45.920 --> 56:51.760]  where a four-year-old boy was torn from a loving middle class family simply to meet an adoption
[56:51.760 --> 57:00.080]  quota we've had cases in colchester esics recently where a family had seven children they attempted
[57:00.080 --> 57:04.240]  to have another baby they had the baby it was taken away from them by the government because
[57:04.240 --> 57:10.240]  the government said their family was too large we've had children taken away from families
[57:10.240 --> 57:16.400]  because they're quote too fat and then we've had babies removed for apparently no reason whatsoever
[57:16.400 --> 57:22.960]  so this is about making it easier for the state to steal people's children and then you connect it
[57:22.960 --> 57:29.600]  to other articles like last year i believe it was or a couple of years ago there was a there was a
[57:29.600 --> 57:34.800]  family uh in northern england not far from where i used to live in rotherham they were members of
[57:34.800 --> 57:40.560]  the uk independence party the parents were the foster parents which is a major party expected
[57:40.560 --> 57:47.360]  to win the european parliamentary elections the local council removed their two foster children
[57:47.360 --> 57:53.440]  because they were members of that political party because according to the council the party is
[57:53.440 --> 58:00.560]  quote racist because it opposes mass uncontrolled immigration and despite the fact that this these
[58:00.560 --> 58:06.800]  foster parents had had a fantastic track record loving parents with numerous different children
[58:06.800 --> 58:11.760]  numerous different backgrounds and ethnicities they took the children away because they were
[58:11.760 --> 58:18.480]  members of a political party a mainstream political party that opposes immigration so that's amazing
[58:18.480 --> 58:22.560]  why they're doing it well we can see this happening in america we have this connecticut
[58:22.560 --> 58:28.000]  teenager whose parents took her to massachusetts to get treatment and because one hospital toughs said
[58:28.000 --> 58:32.880]  that it was a physical problem boston children's hospital said it was a mental problem the they
[58:32.880 --> 58:38.080]  took that decision away from the parents absolutely amazing we see what this has said it thanks paul
[58:38.080 --> 58:46.480]  we'll be right back thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today
[58:50.240 --> 58:56.400]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen
[58:56.400 --> 59:02.960]  bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess what else is an halogen family
[59:02.960 --> 59:09.040]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[59:09.040 --> 59:15.280]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table
[59:15.280 --> 59:22.240]  and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously
[59:22.240 --> 59:28.960]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base

[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:12.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:21.520]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:27.200]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex and i've got on the phone
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:33.200]  paul joseph watson from the uk and we were just talking about this outrageous bill that was passed
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:39.840]  by the scottish legislature that is going to assign a government minder to every child from the
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:46.080]  from the from birth until the age of 18 and paul was just recounting how we've had they've had
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:50.560]  situations in the uk where children were taken from the family because in the judgment of the
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:56.160]  government they had too many children how they were taken from a family because of their political
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.800]  affiliation of course it was a mainstream political party it wasn't the top two biggest parties but
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:05.280]  it's a party that is coming up the uk independence party and i was just starting to talk about this
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.400]  case here in uh boston in massachusetts where a connecticut family was seeking help for their
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.720]  daughter you have two different hospitals one of them toughs the other one boston's children
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:21.520]  hospital toughs says it's a physical problem boston children's hospital says it's a mental problem
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:26.400]  the parents should be able to choose between those two conflicting diagnoses but instead
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:33.040]  the child was removed from their custody by the government and they had a gag order put on them by
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:38.640]  the judge and when the father went to glenn beckon talked about it on glenn beck's program he was
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:43.680]  slammed with a contempt of court charge and then the mother just passed out recently as they've
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:48.400]  taken the children away from them and put them in foster care this is where this is headed isn't it
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:55.840]  paul it's chilling david i mean the the amount of emails i receive on a weekly basis both to my
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:04.320]  private email and to info wars from people merely expressing grief shock and horror in you know five
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:09.920]  page emails recounting the whole horror story about how the state has stolen their children
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:15.520]  begging me to draw attention to it and i can't even get through most of them because it's it's just
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:22.320]  so fundamentally disturbing there's actually a program in the uk called the family intervention
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:28.720]  project where the government installed surveillance cameras inside poor people's homes i believe it
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:34.880]  was 20 000 different families had this done to them to ensure that children went to bed on time
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:42.480]  eight proper meals and attended school so that's the level of invasiveness now it comes out that gchq
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:49.280]  british spy agency working with the nsa is as we predicted years ago watching our webcams
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:54.640]  storing the images from them it's completely invasive nanny state and again it you know how
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:59.680]  much will people put up with well they'll put up with a lot but once it comes to their wallets that's
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:04.240]  that's maybe when when it breaks maybe when it comes to their children is when it breaks you know
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:09.920]  they have maintained the document the the the notion here in the u.s a legal term for it is in
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:14.880]  loco parentis which means in place of the parents and courts have held over and over again that once
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:19.120]  you take your child to a government school you'd have no right to complain about what they do in
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.840]  the school because you've essentially abandoned your child to the state in their eyes the whole
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:30.080]  notion behind this and publicly is that the government knows better and cares more for these
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:35.920]  children than the parents do and of course that is an absurd thing on the face of it that we
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.640]  ought to reject but we need to understand that it is something far more sinister than that this
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:46.080]  is something that attacks the very fundamental the most fundamental institution in our society
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:51.920]  is the family and that was why Plato wanted to remove it so he could have a strong government
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:56.880]  that's what he suggested in the republic that no one in an ideal republic according to Plato would
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.600]  even know who their parents were their total allegiance would be to the state and that's
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:07.280]  what we see these social engineers the socialists of every stripe throughout generations have always
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:13.520]  sought to impose on population they've always seen the family as well as god as their competition
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:20.160]  exactly it's a brave new world scenario and of course statistically children are more likely
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:26.160]  to be abused when they in quote government care per capita than in the general population so
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:31.120]  their justification of protecting children is in fact the opposite they're more likely to be abused
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:35.920]  in government care yes we've seen that over and over again well paul thank you for joining us it's
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.160]  it's just amazing we keep watching what happens in the ukraine they see the bankers doubling down
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:45.600]  we see them fostering again a new coal war so they can sell more military equipment you know
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.560]  they always benefit they always profit from these wars we're going to be joined right after the break

[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:29.600]  texas alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show is thursday february 27 2014 i'm david knife
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:34.400]  going in for alex i'm joined here in the studio with jacari jackson we're gonna be taking your
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.680]  calls in just a couple of minutes you know we had scheduled today wolf gang how big now he's an
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:45.680]  investigator who is a former state trooper a former educator he is a school security consultant
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:51.920]  he started looking at sandy hook because that's his job his job is to look at what happens when
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:56.320]  there's when there's school violence and to advise people how to stop that he's investigated
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:01.760]  columbine he's investigated many school shootings over and over again and yet when he tried to
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:08.560]  investigate sandy hook what he found was very different not only was he totally stone walled
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:13.360]  by the connecticut police but they actually threatened him they had police in florida come
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:19.120]  to his house twice at their request and they called him and threatened him on the phone as well
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:23.200]  and what he has found there is absolutely amazing now this is came to our attention when the american
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:28.080]  free press had an interview with him we had a don solazar do an article about it we've interviewed
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:32.960]  him for the nightly news and we really wanted to have him on today but he called just a few minutes
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:38.400]  ago and said he's got a personal family emergency so pray for wolf gang whatever is going on with
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:43.920]  his family we hope to have him on again and talk about this soon it's amazing to see that this is
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:48.320]  all collapsing in front of the government's eyes these phony narratives about sandy hook
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:54.240]  these phony narratives about the boston bombing in the last hour we played clips from both cnn and
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:10:01.600]  rachel madow on msnbc seriously questioning the events as they were reported the official story
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:07.120]  about the boston bombing this is collapsing very quickly for them and they see that the mainstream
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:13.360]  media no longer has any credibility i kind of think that this is the way this is going to happen
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:19.360]  is that the voice of america got the prohibition to broadcast and they were prohibited after they
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.760]  were created in at the beginning of the cold war they're prohibited from broadcasting government
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:29.440]  propaganda into america they broadcast american propaganda into europe they were prohibited from
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:34.720]  doing that here domestically now that prohibition has been lifted i think what's going to happen
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:40.800]  is they're going to try to reposition much of the mainstream media as alternative media
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:45.440]  questioning to some degree in a limited way what the government's narrative is i think that's
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:51.120]  perhaps maybe what's behind msnbc and rachel madow or maybe they're just seeing the the collapse
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:55.280]  appears more again but whatever we welcome the fact that they're asking questions about the
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:01.440]  murder of ibrahim toteshev who was they said they were picking him up for questioning and then they
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:06.320]  shot him six times once in the back of the head that's clearly a murder clearly an assassination
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:12.800]  at the hands of the fbi and who investigates the fbi well that would be the fbi itself i guess
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:18.080]  and jacari we just had uh chief osavado in here yesterday we were questioning him about some of
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:23.440]  the things that recently happened that the police have done here in austin that we think are way
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:28.480]  over the top in terms of uh this this jogger incident that he had to apologize for last week
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:33.200]  mm-hmm and uh you did a special report where you went out on the street and you talked to people
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:38.480]  about that yes because that was one of the big deals from the beginning was uh to the people
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:42.240]  who are familiar with the story uh the austin police department for the last couple weeks have
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:47.840]  been track uh cracking down on various traffic infractions and last week they were studying
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:54.240]  jaywalking so their intention was to go out and signed citations to jaywalkers but they encountered
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:59.520]  one young lady who did not want to stop for them you know so they claim uh reports a contradictory
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.760]  we have eyewitnesses saying that the girl was grabbed from behind police chief osavado told me
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:08.080]  to my face that uh the officer was in the young lady's field of view but regardless of how she
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:12.240]  was growing up when he was here you were you were running past and saying now show me how you guys
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:16.640]  were reenacting it down in the hallway and i was like come on tell me tell me how this happened
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:22.240]  so regardless you know he says it doesn't matter if she was grabbed from behind or not because
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:26.160]  she knew it was an officer approaching her so we did a man on the street i went out to the streets
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.840]  and i asked young ladies i said you know how would you react if somebody ran up from you
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:34.960]  ran up on you from behind i even ran up on some people in the streets and i just ran up behind
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:38.640]  like hi how do you feel about somebody coming up on you from behind and of course you know the
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.040]  young ladies who would stop and talk to them they said well you know i i don't care who it is if
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.640]  it's a police officer it's just some guy on the street and somebody grabbed me from behind or out
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:51.280]  of my field of view i'm either going jerk away or fight back yeah i mean i really have a problem
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:56.720]  with this whole notion that because they're wearing a uniform they can do things that are
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.960]  really unacceptable in other words they have some authority because by nature of their uniform
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:06.000]  but there needs to be some limits on the police and we don't see those limits being enforced when
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.360]  they step over the line i understand what asavado is saying he says you know don't run from the
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.400]  police and you won't get shot in the back okay that's pretty whatever they tell you to do and you
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:21.440]  can always take it to court but the problem is he told i believe it was an interview with alex he did
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:25.920]  a while back he was talking about how you shouldn't run from the police for any reason yeah you know
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:30.400]  if regardless of how ridiculous the circumstances may be how unjustified he says do not run from
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:34.400]  the police and in the city of austin we know that you can be shot in the back if you do run from the
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.600]  police that's right and and and see the problem is is that they get away with it yes and and it's
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:44.720]  not just one isolated incident you know you can look at one case you can say all right well maybe
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:50.000]  maybe that's not as it appears to be but when it happens over and over and over and over again
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.200]  and every jurisdiction the american public is starting to come to the idea that there is nothing
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:00.400]  that a cop can do that they will ever stand trial for or ever be rolled back so this whole idea that
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:04.560]  you do whatever the cop says and then if you have a problem with it you can take it to court
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:09.360]  that ain't washing i don't see that happening you see the situation with kelly thompson california
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:14.480]  and last year yes here in the city of austin with larry jackson uh the people for the people who aren't
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:20.080]  familiar larry jackson was a man uh he went to a bank after it was robbed he was not the bank robber
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:24.800]  but uh he goes to the bank and allegedly try to commit a fraud whatever that means whether
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:29.440]  it's a fake id or pass a hot check regardless he flees the bank because you know he doesn't want
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:34.640]  to be involved with the police the officer commandeers a car to track him down and after
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:40.880]  and uh a supposed struggle uh larry jackson is is unfortunately shot in the back and dies
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:46.480]  now the officer wasn't under investigation until he retired and then apd just dropped
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:52.320]  investigation so which is to say if you commit a crime where you kill somebody if you just retire
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:56.720]  you don't want to fight it you say hey i'm done with it and investigation is dropped that's just
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:03.520]  amazing and to point it out too i mean the the guy who ran was a black guy the murt the bank robbery
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:08.080]  suspect was a white guy i mean he didn't match the description it's just kind of like this uh
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:12.080]  this christ dorner case out in in l.a. you know where they're looking for a black man and a different
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:17.120]  and they shoot up a car with two white women totally different cars a car not a truck a different
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:22.240]  color the whole bit i mean it's just amazing and yet they get away with it why because we've got a
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:27.200]  legal system that is fundamentally broken that's why i don't support the death penalty i support
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:32.640]  the death penalty in principle but i don't support it in practice because i don't believe
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:37.920]  that people are getting a fair and honest trial i don't believe that the juries most importantly
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:42.880]  the juries do not see themselves as independent of the judge's instructions as somebody who's
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:48.800]  going to sit there and and look at the facts and and see that their job is justice to judge the law
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:55.120]  as well as the facts of the case and you have so in the case of some of these police cases where
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:00.960]  they're not they're not found guilty the judges can manipulate that system by withholding evidence
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:07.040]  i mean they they have so much leeway and we don't have an independent jury system it's a it's a
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:11.360]  broken system but let's take a look at your report here can we go to that report guys
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:17.760]  we don't have that ready just yet okay we're here at the spot where last week four austin police
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:23.760]  officers were needed to subdue a single female jogger the original offense jay walking she was
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:28.800]  later on arrested for the failure to identify to an officer what happened to the moranda right to
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.720]  remain silent what happened to the fifth amendment what happened to the first amendment the freedom
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:36.640]  of speech does that also include the freedom not to speak let's find out what these students have
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:42.400]  to say i excuse me hi uh what do you think about the jogger who got arrested out here last week
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.880]  i actually think it's kind of funny because i cross the street all the time what do you think
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:52.240]  about the jay walker who was arrested last week i don't know the whole story do you i don't know
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:56.160]  the whole story but with what you heard do you have any opinion because they say well she was
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:00.960]  officially arrested for failing to identify to an officer it wasn't the jay walking charge
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:05.680]  but just the police resources do you think it's a good use of a police resource to be out here
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:10.400]  busting jay walkers just cracking down on jay walking i don't know that's sort of like you know
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:14.880]  do you still beat your wife right you you can't really beat your wife you can't say whether you
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:20.240]  did or not because you'd be guilty either way i don't necessarily agree with his comparison to
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:25.280]  beating your wife i mean busting the jay walkers busting the jay walker my thoughts are that's
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:30.960]  pretty ridiculous but um it was a white girl in a nice part of town and if it was anybody else that
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.040]  wouldn't have made the news if somebody gets hit from jay walking then that's their problem you
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:40.560]  don't need four cops involved i think he shouldn't have got arrested or she shouldn't have got arrested
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:45.680]  why is that because she just crossed the street right well you know the official reason given
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:50.000]  for her arrest wasn't so much that she crossed the street it was because she failed to identify to
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.600]  an officer so that means she didn't show her id is that the well she didn't provide the awesome
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:59.760]  police department with as much information as they desired i mean are you familiar with your
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:06.000]  Miranda rights yes i am familiar with you can you tell me uh one of the Miranda rights uh you
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.280]  have a right a right to remain silent there have been contradictory reports uh the police are saying
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:14.880]  that they were in the young lady's field of view when they try to grab her there have been other
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:19.440]  reports saying that the officers approached her from behind quintero doesn't think the officer
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:24.720]  did run up beside her like osvato said i think he grabbed her slightly from behind and it's
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:29.680]  it may not be from far behind but enough to where she didn't notice who was grabbing her right away
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.680]  so if you were out jogging you got your headphones in you're a single woman alone and somebody just
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:38.800]  grabbed you from behind what would your reaction be i would have kept running um all i heard i read
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.920]  was that she didn't see them coming and they grabbed her from behind whether or not he grabbed her
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:50.400]  by behind it doesn't match not relevant at some point she knows it's a crop if somebody was to
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:56.480]  grab you from behind for any reason what would your reaction be um definitely do exactly what she
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:04.400]  did you know kick that i excuse me miss you were jaywalking there for a second okay so she has to
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:08.400]  go to class and that's a good reason that jaywalk uh i just want you to get arrested by the awesome
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:13.440]  police department let me ask you about some comments that the police chief made he said that
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:17.920]  you know the big controversy of last week was that a jogger was arrested you know for
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:22.320]  filling to identify he says in comparison in other cities you have officers who are actually
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:26.560]  sexually assaulting people so does that concern you at all that the bar has been set kind of low
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.280]  he later came back and you know took back those comments but do you think that's a good place
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:36.480]  to set the bar no you this has nothing to do with sexual assault you can't compare that now he has
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:40.000]  later come back and rescinded those comments but do you think that's kind of a bad place that's a
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  great report all right we're starting we're out of time on this segment we're going to be right back

[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:31.680]  yet another sailor has come forward talking about how his exposure at fukushima has ruined his health
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:41.120]  it's now up to 100 solar soldiers and sailors here they said that they didn't know this is what cbs
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:45.600]  said they didn't know that they were heading into the path of a radiation plume really i don't know
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:49.440]  i think somebody knew about that they said now three years after the exposure at least 100 of
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:53.840]  those first responders are suffering from unexplained illnesses like cancer leukemia bleeding and
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:59.520]  hair loss we had one of those sailors on the program alex talked to him at length a very sad
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:04.480]  situation but we've seen over and over again a total disregard whether it's depleted uranium
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:10.640]  whether it's agent orange the government doesn't treat soldiers with the respect that they should
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:16.720]  have for them in many cases they treat them worse than they do chimpanzees because they've
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:23.280]  even said in some cases that they're cheaper than pink chim chimpanzees uh also google fears that the
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:30.160]  fcc's new internet powers are going to affect even google and we've just seen just the last week how
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:34.560]  the fcc was going to treat itself in the newsrooms everybody was concerned about that they said
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:41.520]  content is none of your business but the fcc is making it their business and now the fears are
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:48.560]  that they're going to do a backdoor content management on the internet using the same kind
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:53.440]  of justification that they were trying to get with sopa we've had sopa we've had pippa we've had
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:59.280]  syspa rejected twice now it looks like they're going to try to just do it with the fcc you know
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:03.760]  that's kind of jacar as kind of like obama has done this in the past hasn't he you know he's
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:09.280]  he's always come in and uh just said well this is the year of action we're just going to go around
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:13.680]  congress if we can't get uh internet censorship internet control passed by congress i'm sure we
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:18.960]  can just do the fcc gun stuff well yeah whatever if i can't get congress to sign on i'm just going
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:23.760]  to i got my pen i got my telephone that's how i'm going to do it that's right we've also got the
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:30.640]  fbi says that they had human source contact with ben laudan as far back as 1993 this is an exclusive
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:35.760]  from the washington times but you know this is not a surprise this is something that cebel edmunds
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:39.520]  blew the whistle on she tried to get the 9-11 commission to pay attention to this and of course
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:46.560]  they gagged her uh that's how she got the title uh the most censored woman in history a whistleblower
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:52.080]  who was at the fbi and she knew that they were in contact with ben laudan leading up to 9-11
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:58.000]  we've said over and over again that ben laudan was deeply tied deeply tied to the cia he was their
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.360]  guy just as they turn against menwell noriega and others and also we've got some planned food
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:08.960]  safety rules now coming from the fda again not from the legislature not being passed as laws
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:15.600]  but regulations these regulations would essentially ban organic farming they would ban practices that
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:24.080]  have been performed by farmers for millennia using natural organic fertilizer using animals to plow
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:29.680]  a field no you can't do that you got to buy your fertilizer from the pharmaceutical companies and
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:34.320]  dig agra so we're going to be taking your calls on that but before we do i want to tell you that

[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:42.960]  jacar you've got some updates on some articles various some various stories about self-defense
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:47.520]  you know all about the second amendment and self-defense but i want to talk briefly about that
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:52.640]  the fda article they said they don't want to have organic farming and so forth we've seen the the
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:58.560]  raids and the raw milk facilities and on people who have their own farms and so forth and this
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:02.720]  is a very important issue because you know we do have some victories like with subways saying that
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:08.080]  they want to take or they're going to take the uh when you call that the yoga mat material and the
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:12.080]  of the breads and things like that that happened very quickly yes that's a good victory but we
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:16.480]  also need to get behind these these organic farmers because this is the food that you need
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:21.120]  to be eating and if these guys get shut down all it's going to be is gmo so it's a very important
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:26.240]  issue that's right and just earlier this week i talked to mark baker bakers green acres he's a
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:32.240]  farmer in michigan and the pig association there is basically coming after the farmers who are
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:37.200]  raising heritage pigs they're saying that they're feral he's been fighting that on his own for almost

[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:25.920]  filling in for alex i'm joined here in the studio with jacari jackson and we've been talking about
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:30.400]  a wide variety of topics in the last hour i talked to paul joseph watson from the uk
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:37.760]  and we talked about how they just passed a law in scotland that would assign a government
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:46.320]  minder to every child from birth until the age of 18 and that is absolutely amazing and we can't
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:50.640]  say that that would never happen here can we jacari because we've just seen this case where you've
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:56.240]  got a connecticut teenager who goes to massachusetts to get treatment and you've got one hospital that
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:01.760]  says it's a physical condition another one says it's a psychiatric condition and the parents don't
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:07.680]  have any say so in this they believe they they agree with the with the diagnosis that it's a physical
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:12.480]  condition and they see their daughter getting constantly worse wasting away but the court the
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:16.720]  massachusetts court steps in and says can't do anything about it we're not going to let you
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:21.840]  we're not even going to let you talk to the media about it and they put a contempt order on the father
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:26.560]  when he goes and talks to glenn beck about it i'm it's just outrageous and now they put their daughter
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:31.120]  in foster care exactly because you see even stories where they try to take your children away or put
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:36.560]  sometimes a sanction on you if you refuse to vaccinate your children yes i don't i've read
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:40.560]  before i vaccinated and i've choose to not vaccinate my child and now they want to take
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:45.040]  your children away yes that's right coming against the family and as we just talked about in the last
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:51.360]  segment coming against the family farm we've had first we had obama's labor department say about a
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:55.840]  year ago wasn't it they said that they were going to start taking a close look at child labor laws
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:59.760]  and how they applied on the farm right you're not going to be able to work on the farm you know i have
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:05.920]  a family of farmers you know some old-time oklahoma country folks and you know they were you know
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:09.600]  obama supporters and i said you know obama doesn't want kids to work on the farm they just couldn't
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:14.880]  believe it it's like why would he do it i said because he can yeah exactly it's absolutely insane
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:20.480]  i just talked earlier this week uh there's an interview on the nightly news and of course jacari
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.480]  is on the night is a host and a reporter on the nightly news it's something you guys need to
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.800]  support prison planet tv i'll put a little plug in there for word listeners supported

[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:39.360]  so it's a it's a great way to see our documentaries to see our news reports first but i had
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:46.160]  mark baker of baker's green acres he's a farmer in michigan and he's raising heritage pigs he's
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:52.160]  he's letting it's like free-range cattle uh it's like uh you know grass-fed cattle free-range
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:57.120]  chickens that's what he's doing with his pigs and he's got a strain of heritage pigs that
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:01.760]  since he lives in michigan they've got hair on them and based on the physical appearance
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:07.200]  of the pigs right based on whether they've got the ears that stick up or they got uh for whatever
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:12.960]  of course this all came from his competitors who are politically connected and for three years
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:17.280]  nearly he's been fighting this order that came out the state of michigan they want to kill all of
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:21.440]  his pigs because they don't look like the cute pigs in the movies that's right and one of the
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:27.920]  things that he told me the reason i started getting on this again was he said that he got into farming
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:32.480]  because when he was in the military the most grounded most centered people that he met had
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:38.320]  been raised on a farm and he wanted that life for his family and he wanted to you know so that's why
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:45.680]  he got into farming you've got family farmers who are not producing the kind of factory food that
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:51.040]  we're concerned about that that's got a lot of pesticides a lot of steroids a lot of uh antibiotics
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:56.720]  in it you've got good clean honest food and the government is coming down on them from every
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:01.280]  direction like a hammer i mean it was the child labor laws then the ep from the labor department
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:05.760]  it's the epa came after them with dust regulations now we've got the fda coming out and saying they
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:10.640]  can't have natural fertilizer and then even during uh some drought periods we have seen
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:16.400]  cows and other livestock eating candy yeah it's all kind of these wacky things but you know we're
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:21.600]  gonna they want to have the entire food supply controlled by just a few people who are their
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:26.880]  friends both for monetary purposes but it's also very effective political means now we've had a
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:30.320]  couple of callers have been waiting for a while we've got uh let's go to them and give them a
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:34.480]  chance to weigh in on this we were talking about the family we got a first call was from bob and
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:39.440]  michigan he wanted to talk about the family bob thanks for taking my call enjoying your show
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:45.840]  today guys sounds really great thank you and uh i you've had other people call in and talk about
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:54.160]  the relationship of the political structure and how it enslaves people but people keep saying well
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:38:01.840]  how can they do that with the children uh impose a gag order uh tell them what medical care they'll
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:07.840]  get i i can't state this enough you've had some other people that have really articulated it very
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:14.800]  well uh as to why but you have to remember that the people that are in power see us as the chattel
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:23.280]  goods possessions slaves if you will and whatever is good for that property they are maintaining
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:30.000]  that as a corporate asset yes yes i mean that's the common thread through this whole thing and
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.960]  you know the the great late george carlin said it they own you exactly because they own you with
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:41.120]  your student loan that they own you with your mortgage they own you any kind of way they can
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:48.160]  give you that stupid number and and that's what this is uh we're we're talking about the result
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:56.640]  of a basic uh misclassification criminally i might say uh and put us all into that really risky
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:02.560]  dangerous place yes and you know that's a mindset that people need to understand they need to understand
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:07.760]  that this is not coming about because the government is fundamentally incompetent or they waste money
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:13.440]  or they really want to do the right thing but no they're basically they have a very evil agenda
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:18.880]  that's why we keep trying to put this that we see this over and over again and topic after topic it
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:24.640]  isn't incompetence it isn't mistakes being made they always try to play that off just like you
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:29.600]  know we have the situations of Benghazi have the situations of the atf running guns into Mexico and
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:34.480]  they said oh it was a few rogue agents even though the air colder has purged himself he knew about
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:38.560]  it he may have known about it under another name but he knew these activities were going on but
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:42.800]  they always try to plead incompetence i had too many moving parts in the government well why don't
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:46.400]  you shut down those moving parts when you find out they're acting the way they're not supposed to
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:50.720]  yes yeah fast and furious for example the good example that you bring up there that was not
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:57.120]  incompetence that was a deliberate effort to destroy the second amendment it was to manufacture
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:04.320]  a false flag so they could enact gun control and gun registration so they could prevent gun
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:09.600]  traveling over the border you know they still even though they that uh fast and furious incident
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:14.320]  was exposed they still try to use it because obama goes down to mexico he says the reason why you guys
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:18.720]  have such a high murder rate with your weapons because we have a first amendment in our country
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:23.200]  yeah yeah so i mean even the new york amendment second amendment even the new york times pointed
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:28.720]  out that it was a false flag in order to do that and they had the un armed trade treaty which was
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:33.360]  going to do precisely that so they they have something in mind that they want to enact and so they
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:39.280]  create a false flag that's going to move public opinion just in time for the event to come in but
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:45.520]  it fortunately blew up in their face and was exposed only because a federal agent was killed
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:51.120]  let's go to thank you bob uh for the call about the family let's go to dc and west virginia dc
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:55.600]  you said you got a uh washington times article you want to talk about it was one guy that's a great
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:02.320]  job like always um sorry for my little off topic but um i want to talk about the uh bankers suicide
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:08.640]  also known as murder and i wanted to see if you all see any connection between this washington times
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:14.080]  2012 october 25th article now this was put out like during the whole hysteria of the
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:18.560]  mind calendar and all that stuff but basically they quoted paul voker if those are the only
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:23.120]  paul voker he's in a trial at all commission he's also in the building group and they quoted him as
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:28.960]  saying that he believes the economies will collapse on march 4th 2014 and then all of a sudden we have
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:35.360]  all these bankers suicides yeah yeah that's that's true looks like it's you have all so many different
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:40.800]  predictions you know i'm not the greatest forecaster but i definitely do recognize the uh the bankers
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:45.840]  suicides or quote suicides a very mysterious circumstances going on with that and it definitely
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:51.040]  does concern me when you got somebody who is a former chair of the fed like paul voker um
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:56.640]  if they predict today i mean certainly they could manipulate the markets to the extent that they
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:01.280]  could precipitate a crash fulfilling i mean we have the federal reserve because you had jp morgan
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:06.960]  and facilitate a crash and use that as uh an excuse to create the federal reserve thank you dc
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:13.440]  let's go to uh john in ohio you want to talk about the ukraine uh yeah i um wanted a first point
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:18.320]  out that uh the media uh that everyone considers their friend in their car in their living room
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:24.080]  is really a cobra it's uh it's not true it's not your friend it's run by the central intelligence
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:28.560]  agency the biggest banks that own in their lock with it the fortune 100 companies the
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:33.200]  or mongering military industrial uh war profiteers and well that was even more
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:40.000]  confirmed with the fcc uh regulations that have been revealed recently uh i'm uh i'm not detailed
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:45.200]  on that but i that general statement i just made i think necessitates we get real alternative and
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:50.800]  i found one which is a global research it's a collection of a lot of writers and journalists
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:56.800]  will never get on cnr and fox and they've been talking about uh the lies were being told on
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:02.880]  global research uh concerning uh well just about everywhere including the ukraine and i wanted to
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:10.880]  bring up um some of the uh uh uh incestuous relationships between um uh victoria newland
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:20.800]  uh this notorious come out uh imperialist uh her husband is uh the neocon founder of the uh hit larry
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:27.840]  and project for a new american century robert kagan and he also interlocks with the republican
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:34.240]  war mongers because he is the uh top uh advisor to mit romney uh an even worse war monger than
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:40.560]  obama which is hard to imagine and so you see that there and you see that uh this project for a
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:46.000]  new american century i think a lot of people know was the uh the scheme of the uh top military
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:53.200]  industrial types and uh democrats and republicans to uh overthrow the entire world and establish us
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:58.720]  of uh world domination and they said because of the demise of the soviet union this was a golden
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:03.680]  opportunity that they were going to eliminate and destroy any country that stood in the way
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:10.000]  of u.s uh imperial imperialist world domination and you look at you look at um some at the power
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:18.480]  of the other war monger uh she is the life of uh cast sunstein who is uh is the uh uh evil demon
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:24.000]  that uh along with the military that are creating sock puppets to a plant uh you know pro war
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:30.320]  propaganda pro overthrow of syria libya uh ukraine propaganda throughout the media while
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:36.560]  pretending to be alternative and so i think when you look at all of that uh from all sides and i
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:43.840]  i think the info war is uh on some of its uh positions is uh exposing the military c i
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:50.080]  industrial propaganda like in ukraine syria libya but on the other hand it it promotes us uh
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:56.000]  those that propaganda what comes to china and cuba venezuela and sometimes even iran but i
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.560]  think that people have really got to realize that uh how do you think we promote the uh
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:04.080]  how do you think we promote propaganda did you see uh the interview that i had with steve pacinac
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:08.880]  on the nightly news the other night no i i don't follow do you know who steve pacinac is oh sure
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:13.440]  i do yeah okay well just for people who don't know i mean he was advisor to i think it was five
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:18.640]  administrations he brokered the camp david agreement he's got long-term involvement in the
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:23.200]  intelligence community but his i asked him about the ukraine i asked him about victoria newland
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:30.400]  and he said it was the most outrageous in your face deliberate uh challenge that he's ever seen
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:36.320]  the fact that she's claiming that they hacked her phone and the phony outrage from the state
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:41.040]  department and the u.s government that somebody would actually listen to her phone i mean can
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:45.600]  they really seriously say that with a straight face i mean they're listening to all of our phones
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:50.240]  blanket surveillance dragnet surveillance and yet they say can you imagine the russians listening
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:56.240]  to uh somebody at the at the state department's phone of course she did that just to challenge
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:03.680]  them just to cement uh dangerous relationships to escalate rate uh conflict between the u.s
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:08.800]  and the uh and the russians i think is part of a a way for the military industrial complex to get
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:15.840]  back there their profit center but uh how do you think that we are are promoting propaganda let me
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:21.040]  let me ask you to explain well i'm saying on on on certain countries you're you're doing a good
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:26.800]  job like on the ukraine and libya and syria and pointing out that lci aida is really behind these
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:32.800]  acclaims of uh anderson cooper and other ci rot rot rotters that uh these are freedom fighters
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:38.000]  but when it comes to china and cuba venezuela uh i think uh you don't apply the same standards
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.920]  of these color revolutions the ci subversion and the lies that were being told simply because
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:49.760]  they're either nominally uh socialist or they're uh semi socialist and there's that there's a kind
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:54.480]  of a a red flag that goes up that changes the whole standard when it comes to those countries
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:59.040]  but you know we have we have talked about venezuela we've talked about how there seems to be a double
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:03.280]  standard in the way that it is very telling how there's a double standard between the way the
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:07.280]  uh i believe uh it was curtain emma who put out an article just a few days ago sir maybe you can go
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:14.320]  to info wars dot com and check up on that for yourself yeah well i uh but uh i just uh i just
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:21.600]  think that uh like today talking about applying the same standards to uh uh country uh if russia
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:28.480]  came over here and uh tried over and and over through uh canada and started to move its uh
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:35.200]  missiles uh into a threatening position in our country and uh yeah how about if they put missiles
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:41.680]  in cuba when we see that as a crisis i think we have you know and and quite honestly i mean i
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:45.600]  look at the situation in ukraine and and i have a lot of sympathy for the people of ukraine
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:51.840]  i know they suffered under tremendous despotism i know that the soviet union went in they
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:48:00.080]  decapitated their leadership they co-opted the churches they had a massive influx of russians to
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:04.560]  immigration to control the country and then they took away their food and they starved them out and so
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:08.240]  i understand that people are still upset about that they should be upset about that
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:13.200]  but we also understand there's another gang that's out there eager to subjugate them i i hope they get
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:17.760]  their independence somehow but you know they're jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:21.920]  if they get under the control of these european bankers and the imf we said that was happening
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:26.800]  and now we see it as we talked about with paul joseph watson last hour the imf is there with
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:30.880]  they're going to outbid the russians instead of 15 billion dollars the imf is going to come in with
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:35.680]  35 billion dollars and they're going to loot the country left and right it's just really said well
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:41.520]  thanks john for calling from ohio we've got uh brad and kinetica you wanted to talk about sandy hook
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:48.960]  yeah you do it thanks for having me on hey brad sure go ahead um i just want to bring up a couple
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:55.760]  inconsistencies and weird things that i found from doing my own research about uh whatever went on
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:49:02.960]  in sandy hook um there is the evidence pictures that you can see online and um there is a uh
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:08.240]  two black sweatshirts ones by the uh front passenger and the others by the rear passenger
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:11.760]  that are just left on the ground and uh they never really talk about that
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:18.720]  yeah there's there's a lot of there's a lot of anomalies i mean the the article the the interview
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:23.680]  that uh wolfgang halby had with american free press it was a 45 minute long interview
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:30.560]  paul uh or adan salazar not paul joseph watson but adan salazar that a detailed argument talking
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:36.880]  about he kind of focused on the crime scene because that's his investigation uh background he's a
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:42.560]  a former state trooper he's a school security consultant so there's a lot of strange things
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:48.240]  that are going on the periphery of that and it's it's very strange that you don't have any families
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:52.720]  that have sued that's never happened before in a shooting but there's never been any families that
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:58.000]  sued it was interesting that you did have one family that was going to sue and they were going
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.400]  to sue for a hundred million dollars because not because their daughter was killed but because
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:07.440]  she was frightened and they and they backed off of that after just two weeks and nobody
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:11.600]  has sued them for negligence and of course that's the first thing that seems to happen and
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:18.080]  if they were concerned about children's safety you would think that they would be open to safety
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:23.680]  school safety consultants like wolfgang halby so we want to get him back on his amazing set of
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:29.840]  facts he's been researching this since it happened in spite of the stonewalling from connecticut
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:34.480]  and uh we've had him on the nightly news we want to have him on the radio soon and we hope that
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:40.000]  that'll happen but today he had a family emergency so our prayers go out to him we're going to be

[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:46.800]  mean for not just the ukrainian people but what does it mean for us as we see the american government
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:53.120]  escalating this conflict between and there and all the war hawks and everybody's ready to go oh
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:59.200]  yeah i mean you start going after the ukraine and russia and you start going after the Crimea
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:04.800]  which is their access to water that's that's gonna be a very calling last week talking about the
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:09.520]  ports out there and yeah that's a very real concern yeah that's that's a good way to stir up a
[01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:12.880]  hornet's nest if you wanted to start world war three that's the way you would do it and we've
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:17.840]  seen a lot of signs and we've seen we've heard warnings from people like scowls and saying that
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:21.600]  that's exactly what he thinks the government wants to do is start world war three we know
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:27.520]  that governments always profit when there's a war or there's a fear of a war oh so the question is
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:34.640]  do they just want to drum up conflict between us and russia and china and iran certainly that's in
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:42.080]  the interest of dictatorships like iran and countries where you've got a uh an oligarchy
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:48.640]  that's running it like china it certainly makes them stronger to brag about how they want to go
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:52.640]  to war and how prepared they are for war but of course our government is becoming more and more
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:57.120]  like a dictatorship in every respect so you would expect them to start doing that the situation in
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:01.360]  Syria where you know mama says they crossed the red line and then he says no the american people
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:06.880]  say they crossed the red line then they show the videos of these youtube videos with the al-qaeda logo
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:11.440]  on it show it on the big networks you see it's Assad i'm like oh Assad with the al-qaeda logo on
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:15.200]  his video like okay that makes perfect sense that's right i i guess we're not really too far away
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:21.600]  from the day when the u.s military is going to parade down the streets of washington on mayday
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:26.160]  you know of course of course they're already sending out the military vehicles to every village
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:30.800]  in town you know we've got we've got anti-mine vehicles that are going to every village in town
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:35.200]  so i guess they don't need the mayday parade anyway i think it's ohio state they have that big
[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:40.080]  mine proof truck yeah yeah i'm like what kind of frat parties are you guys busting up but you
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:44.160]  need something that big yeah that's that's my question that's right well let's go to our
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:48.960]  collars we had one caller from uh texas timmy from texas who's been on for a while hanging
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:54.800]  on for a while you wanted to say something about uh pension fraud uh i read an article it was post
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:57:00.880]  yesterday on drudge uh it was only there for for yesterday but it's over it was from yahoo news and
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:07.040]  it said that over a hundred firefighters and policemen are being arrested for pension fraud
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:12.880]  from the not uh stemming from the 9 11 uh pensions they got i guess they retired shortly after 9
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:17.600]  11 and i just wanted to discuss with you guys if if there may you know you guys might think there'd
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:23.600]  be a a deeper plot as far as these are the guys that just kept quiet and took the money but in
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:28.880]  reality they could be the guys to speak out and say there was maybe a proof of explosive and instead
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:33.680]  they took the money which uh in the article it states is over 400 million dollars so spread that
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:38.000]  out over a hundred people or so i mean that's a lot of money what do you guys think well it's hard
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:42.720]  to say i mean i look into that frankly i wouldn't be surprised to find anything associated with the
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:47.840]  9 11 situation but uh we know how the government has used it we've covered it over and over again
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:54.240]  alex's uh has talked to eyewitnesses we have uh done documentaries we've covered the news it's
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:58.560]  it's just amazing and we see it happening over and over again i mean what do you think about the
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:05.120]  fact that rachel maddow and msnbc and cnn are talking about how phony the boston bombing looks
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:08.960]  having issues with the fact that the fbi would pick somebody up for questioning and then shoot
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:12.800]  him in the back of the head or shoot him six times and once in the back of the head i mean hang on
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:18.320]  we'll be right back i want to know what you think about that stay tuned we'll talk about the awakening
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:23.280]  of the mainstream media if that's what's going on i guess you can say that to an extent maybe yeah

[02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:27.520]  welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night fillian for alex today and i'm joined in studio
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:32.080]  with my fellow nightly news reporter jacari jackson and we're taking your calls on a
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:37.440]  variety of subjects just before the break we had a caller asking us what we thought about the
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:42.880]  pension fraud story if we thought it might possibly be related to the 9-11 but we believe
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:46.320]  it's a conspiracy there but i asked him a question i wanted to know what he thought
[02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:51.840]  about rachel matt owlett in this msnbc starting to talk now about the fbi
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:58.160]  assassinating a witness in the boston bombing and cnn actually questioning the government's
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:01.600]  official story yeah it's typically they're the ones who put out the government's official
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:07.280]  story i mean it was amazing when the boston bombing was happening we would question details
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:11.600]  of the narrative and a half hour later we would oh it's almost like cnn was responding it was kind
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:17.120]  of surreal yeah it was pretty surreal but they were the spokespersons for what was going on
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:21.440]  with the boston bombing and now i guess to try to bolster their credibility they're questioning
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:28.080]  it what do you make of that caller um timmy in texas yeah david it's like you say you know every
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:32.720]  every uh every day on yelp's introduction they're on the run we got them on the run the info wars
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:39.520]  is uh defeating uh the dinosaur media um one more thing on that previous story i covered uh victoria
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:44.880]  cavalier with ruders who wrote that story jacari you said you'd uh want to look into it it's just
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:49.600]  you know when i went big corporate bankers um violator have some sort of fraud against and
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:53.760]  there's a hearing on it they're not arrested immediately and there's over a hundred firefighters
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:58.240]  and policemen that have been arrested so just really uh it just seems really uh sketchy i guess
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:03.600]  you could say yeah and uh one last thing guys i got to meet y'all there at the alamo uh jacari
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:08.080]  you were wandering around lost trying to find the march and uh i ran into you with a buddy of mine
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:13.840]  so good to meet you guys uh david i'd mentioned to you about the the uh uh the secret service
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:17.840]  agent swabbing his children for some odd reason i don't know if you remember that conversation
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:23.360]  yeah but uh it's good to talk to you guys and uh remember the guy i was with jacari his name's
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:28.240]  shawn and he's super trendy all right all right thanks well thanks temmie and thanks for showing
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:33.040]  up at the alamo you know we have to stand up for freedoms or we lose them and it's very very important
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:39.920]  for us to stand on the freedoms that the government recognizes they recognize so few and when it's
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:45.440]  legal to open carry a rifle and the police are harassing people for that because they
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:48.960]  want to make the public they've they've gone on record eric holder has said that he wants to
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:54.160]  brainwash the public they want everyone to be afraid not only of the sight of guns but the
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:59.040]  sight of someone with a gun biden and i'm glad uh the collar brought that up the alamo because
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:02.560]  everybody asks you know when you know we go out here we fight every day we get on the show every
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:06.720]  day you know what progress is being made that's progress going out to the alamo because we had
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:10.960]  a police chief who said he was going to arrest anybody who came out there with a gun you had
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:15.360]  thousand plus people show up with guns that's a victor when the food babe comes on here and says
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:19.200]  subway needs to take this stuff out of the food that's a victory when you had the hernandez family
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:23.680]  in san antonio texas saying that we're not going to wear your rfid tags they fight it out that uh
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:28.080]  kathryn albert gets involved they win that's a victory victories happen every day but you
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:31.200]  don't see this on your mainstream network so people just think we're just banging our head
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:35.600]  against the wall occasionally we knock a hole through that wall bust through it and get the bad
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:40.000]  guys out of there it can happen but you have to be persistent you can't give up and just be
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:45.440]  encouraged and keep going at it that's right you got rachel madow who's gone from laughing at alex
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:50.560]  jones and making all kinds of bizarre accusations about i mean he's just questioning the government's
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:55.040]  official story now she's questioning the government's official story that's a huge turnaround let's go
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:04:00.640]  to jerry in ohio he said you want to talk about farmers and the new world order jerry yeah how

[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:24.320]  living in northeastern ohio for most of my life and it's looking more and more like i'm living
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:32.160]  in communist china uh they are pressuring the farmers up here uh they are building housing
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:39.520]  allotments right next to farms and then people are complaining that uh they can smell the cows
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:46.160]  they get chickens they can hear pigs i mean they're really just trying to crowd the farmers out
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:52.800]  yeah that's right let's hang on we're gonna talk about that this la time story has a very interesting
[02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:57.760]  contradiction between what people want in terms of fresh food and what they think about farms stay

[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:47.200]  talking about planned food safety rules attacking organic farmers listen to what they said they
[02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:52.880]  interviewed a guy's name is jim crawford he's an organic farmer and he said that the fda came to him
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:59.600]  and said this is my badge these are the fines this is what's hanging over your head and we want you

[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:23.120]  of the public interest they're pushing the fda not to yield to these family farmers but to
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:27.920]  shut them down this is the last statement he had to say and then i want to get jerry in ohio's
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:32.640]  comments on this this is what jim crawford the guy that they talked to said he said the public
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:39.040]  loves to love and idealize us little family farmers but the vast majority of us are hanging by
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:43.920]  a thread now the government is saying we're going to put a lot more weight on that thread
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:50.640]  what do you think about that jerry in ohio yeah like i was telling you the uh they have these
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:58.240]  township people and they drive around and they're like little mini nazis uh if you have a compost
[02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:05.200]  bin if you don't go to get a permit to have one they come out and they take pictures of it and

[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:19.920]  an america that is filled with snoops oh in so many different ways we see america turning into
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:26.640]  east germany i talked to william bennie who was the technical director globally of the nsa until
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:31.920]  he resigned right after 9 11 because he saw the government violating the restrictions that have
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:36.640]  been put on them about foreign intelligence surveillance that they were to keep it foreign
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:41.920]  he was somebody who has spent his entire life watching people and the watching the government
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:47.200]  in the soviet union watching the government in east germany and he said that we are becoming
[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:51.600]  exactly like them we're going down that path and it's not just the government spying on people
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:57.040]  but it's the the citizens who got this culture exactly that's what they did in east germany
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:01.520]  it was getting the citizens to report on each other now of course they got the technology
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:05.840]  and it makes it even worse but it's just creating this snitch mentality which is what
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:11.920]  you're talking about jerry and also here in northeast ohio they're putting in like these
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:18.240]  little mini highways through all these small towns and they're cutting back all the trees
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:25.840]  and they're putting in all these cameras uh what i was told was that when the uprisings began and
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:32.000]  when the cities are burning that the military are actually going to use the small towns surrounding
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:40.560]  these big cities at the setup command post and uh also uh i've seen some fema places also popping
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:45.840]  up up here well we know that they're training for insurgency within the united states that's why
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:51.120]  they just spent a hundred million dollars on a fake us city that's more detailed than they've ever
[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:55.040]  done with any of their urban warfare and the bullets and the targets the targets of little
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:58.960]  children the targets of pregnant women it's all coming home and they got cameras all over they
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:03.200]  got you know 40 plus downtown austin they need more they're saying if we had more cameras we
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:06.560]  wouldn't have fights you know like the video even though there's a camera right where the
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:10.640]  video is taking place well they don't like you taking pictures of them though oh no yeah and
[02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:17.600]  we just reported on the nightly news that sisco is competing with ibm in order to create a physical
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:22.880]  information highway they're actually going to you've heard of the internet of things that's
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:28.560]  where they're connecting our appliances everything to the internet which as patrice told us a couple
[02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:32.640]  of years ago he's going to go swash here exactly so he's going to feed right to us well now they
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:37.760]  want to do that with the roads they want the roads to quote unquote provide you internet and social
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:42.320]  media contact but then of course they're also going to have tracking tracking they're going to
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:46.080]  of every aspect of your life they're going to look at your license plate they're going to have that
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:51.680]  in a database so even after paul joseph wasn't exposed the fact that or it was kid i forget which
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:58.400]  one of our writers found the story but they saw a an rfp from the department of homeland security to
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:05.200]  create a license database a car license database and then they that went viral and within a couple
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:10.160]  of days uh dhs homeland security said no no we're we're withdrawing that we're withdrawing that but
[02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:16.000]  we have been worse yeah exactly and yet at the same time you see in the tech world you see these
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:21.920]  reports that ibm and sisco are competing against each other as to who's going to provide the physical
[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:26.880]  information highway that's going to collect all this information all this data on you just in
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:30.000]  the name of we're going to make it easy for you we're going to let you have internet all the time
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:33.920]  in your car you're going to be able to watch it we go to these cities these downtown centers and
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:37.520]  they say they have the free wi-fi you know they can spy on you while you're using their thing
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:41.040]  and i'm talking about the license plate scanners now they have police cruisers i guess they've
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:44.960]  had them for a while that can read your license plate they're just driving around scanning everybody
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:48.400]  violating your fourth amendment they have no reason no probable cause to search you
[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:52.480]  also the red light cameras can do this as well yeah and they want they want you to be able to
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:56.960]  surf the internet and tell them what you're thinking while you're driving along in your
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:02.000]  driverless car yeah okay which you no longer have control over that anymore either let's go to uh
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:06.400]  tony and idaho you wanted to talk about the family we were talking about that earlier tony
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:13.760]  yeah uh good to talk to you guys uh i heard glenn back where he's talking about the little girl that uh
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:20.240]  uh what all they're doing to her i hadn't heard that they had put her in foster care though uh
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:26.000]  what the government does is they're manipulating the law to kind of justify themselves to do a
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:32.480]  lot of this stuff and they do it through registration the people they they bring the people up in the
[02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:35.840]  schools and the people aren't taught the law they don't know what the government's doing
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:43.520]  or how the government's manipulating the law but basically when you allow your baby to be registered
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:48.880]  with the birth certificate you're registering that child to the government and once you do that
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:54.000]  then the the maximum of law says the source of the right determines the governing law
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:58.080]  so when you register it to the government then they take it they just take it they have a right
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:03.280]  to do anything they want exactly and we talk about uh the school system the uh this whole
[02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:07.520]  generation i guess it happens generation to generation they'll rob you of some type of
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:12.160]  practical knowledge like we see now in our current military they're not teaching these young guys
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:15.680]  about the bill of rights they're not teaching people about constitutional rights they're just
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:20.080]  the opposite they're actively opposing it they don't want you to know this stuff so when you come
[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:23.920]  out and into the streets to do whatever duties you have to do you don't know you're not conscious
[02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:28.400]  of these things and it happens generation to generation just with our current our current
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:32.640]  system there's not going to be a generation who doesn't understand or who hasn't been fed this
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:36.480]  propaganda that you know guns are bad and anybody with a gun is just going to jump out the bushes
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:40.480]  to kill you or they they're not aware that you know there wasn't a time where you didn't have to get
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:45.280]  a pat down just to get on an airplane or to go just go see the super bowl this is the conditioning
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:50.400]  that we see you're growing up a whole generation and things and it gets worse worse generations
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:55.120]  it's normalcy bias it's a Stockholm syndrome you know when i went to school there weren't
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:16:00.720]  any policemen in the schools we didn't have metal detectors we didn't have school lockdown we
[02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:06.240]  didn't have any of that stuff today the kids are being raised in a model of a police state
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:12.240]  you know i've said it over and over again maximum security is actually a prison that's
[02:16:12.240 --> 02:16:17.040]  what they call a prison we see just like i was talking about earlier uh in uh san and san Antonio
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:21.680]  with the RFID trackers at the high schools down there that it's prisoner training you give the kids
[02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:25.920]  they're the little id badge they have to wear visibly all the time you stand in this line you
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:29.600]  do this you can't go here without this permission you have to ask permission to go to the water
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:34.480]  found just like you do in jail yeah he's working jail that's how it worked yeah yeah yeah if you if
[02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:41.360]  you value security over everything else you're going to get maximum security which is a pan-opticon
[02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:46.880]  prison where everything you do is watched you live your life in this fish bowl that the government
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:51.200]  super analyzes everything that you do in many cases will jump to the wrong conclusion make you the
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:56.720]  enemy uh that's what we're coming up to thanks uh tony let's go to bregan in wisconsin bregan
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:08.800]  hey guys um David um sorry my speakerphone was on David thank you for uh continuing to um um

[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:32.960]  hook because that's what he does he looks at school security they want to tell you
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:37.200]  that all these gun regulations are to keep the children safe but they don't want school security
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:42.800]  experts to know anything about the crime scene and after cover-up after cover-up after 10 months
[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:46.880]  they're trying to get foya information they started threatening him they started pushing
[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:51.760]  back against him so we've had him on the nightly news we wanted to get him on today but he had a
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:58.640]  family emergency go ahead bregan um and i have a few questions for wolfgang but i'll say that for
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:05.120]  when he gets back on the show but one of the primary questions would be where's all that video i mean
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:10.800]  they've they've yeah that's the question since day one yeah they've exploited all that video from
[02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:18.320]  columbine and every other school shooting and every other um you know mass murder events and and
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:24.800]  why won't they use it this time well a lot of people suspect that maybe there is no video
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:32.880]  yeah showing that very fact and um anyway uh thanks again for uh pursuing uh wolfgang and
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:37.040]  our thoughts and prayers are with him i i hope he's doing okay well thank you bregan and thank you

[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:16.480]  one or two years ago they had troops from all over the world i even think there's a
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:21.680]  few japanese uh personnel there as well running the troops running the uh running the drills

[02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:31.120]  results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously

[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:09.360]  caller he was excoriated this week because of his comments about what it really means to have
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:15.360]  freedom in this country as a business owner being able to decide who you want to serve and who you
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:20.560]  want to not serve now of course most business owners aren't going to turn people out but in
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:27.840]  some cases where you've got a wedding photographer who doesn't want to go to cover a gay wedding
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:31.600]  you ought to have the right to do that and if you say that he doesn't have the right to do that
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:37.040]  as tucker carlson pointed out that is just nothing but fascism that's servitude that's not freedom
[02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:41.840]  exactly because i believe the institute referring to is uh the gentleman who didn't want to make a
[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:46.720]  wedding cake for a gay couple and they knew they expected that going in they went to this guy purposely
[02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:51.840]  for that purpose and you know the shenanigans and all the big things that came out of it yeah it's
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:56.400]  amazing and i mean they really attacked him in the media for stating what i think is the obvious
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:26:01.360]  thing that if you've got a business you get to decide what who you want to do business with i
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:04.880]  mean if you cut off everybody you're going to go out of any restaurant it says we have the right
[02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:09.760]  to refuse service to anybody that's right whatever reason that's right it's a private business and
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:15.520]  if it's not if it's a private business where the people who own it and pay taxes and pay for it and
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:20.720]  have to meet payroll if they don't have the freedom to make the decisions about how they want to operate
[02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:25.680]  who they want to operate with then you've got fascism you don't have a free market you don't
[02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:31.200]  have private property you simply have economic fascism we have token ownership by private
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:35.040]  individuals but you don't have actual ownership now he's going to be on tomorrow i don't know
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:39.600]  what he's going to talk about but uh he's going to be on with alex jones live in studio that's
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:45.600]  tucker carlson tomorrow now we were just talking to scott in texas he had some questions about foreign
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:50.560]  troops in american soil and some of these urban warfare drills uh scott did you have anything
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:55.120]  else that you wanted to say i wanted to uh rod in france before we get to the break but uh
[02:26:55.120 --> 02:27:00.240]  tucker did you uh scott did you have another question yeah what i really wanted to probe you
[02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:10.560]  on is uh chinese troops in the u s uh for purposes under the u n maybe national is that disaster
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:18.240]  martial law uh if you were the chinese and you had 300 000 troops in the united states how long
[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:22.720]  are you going to play ball with the u n when the time comes to deploy are you going to follow the
[02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:28.720]  script or are you going to take advantage of the situation what what do you think is going
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:34.000]  on in the minds of the chinese well i think it's always important for a government that wants to
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:38.320]  do things in opposition to their citizens and we see over and over again that the american
[02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:43.520]  government sees the american people as the enemy it's always been the pattern that you use people
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:49.040]  that are not the the citizens to oppress the people in other words you're going to bring
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:54.240]  out a foreign military power you're going to uh uh and then once you get that established you're
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:27:58.000]  going to put somebody over them you're going to have a bureaucracy like the british empire did
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:04.240]  in india where they the entire indian bureaucracy was made up of indigenous people but at the very
[02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:08.320]  top you had a few people controlling that but when you have a war you want just the opposite of that
[02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:11.840]  you want more troops to come in and shoot people come in just like we see a lot of times in the
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:16.720]  drug war in mexico they'll bring various agents from the u s down to mexico to to assist in those
[02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:21.360]  drug bust let's go thank you scott let's go to rod in france you've been holding for a while from
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:28.000]  france ride what do you have to say hi david jacari it's always good to talk to you guys you do a great
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:34.240]  job just want to say starting out thank you thank you um what i want to talk about in fact with
[02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:41.840]  sandy hook and uh and wolf gang uh halbig um of course i i wish him the very best i had the
[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:50.320]  opportunity to uh to listen to his podcast uh from afp and it's extremely interesting i mean the
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:55.760]  things that uh that this guy has to say and what's amazing about the story is is that uh
[02:28:56.400 --> 02:29:01.040]  this guy he obviously knows what he's doing i mean it's his job and he's gone through all
[02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:08.000]  the correct channels to try and get information and the the cover-up just seems extensive and uh
[02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:15.280]  i just find it extremely disturbing that at the last moment you will you notice that he doesn't
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:22.480]  he hasn't gotten a lot of coverage as opposed to what i find is a is a very important story
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:29.840]  and i just find it extremely odd that just before he gets on to uh gets on to info wars and gets the
[02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:36.000]  massive exposure here with an extremely interesting story that uh that he's had a family emergency and
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:41.920]  i wish him all the best on that and i i do nothing nothing going well eventually that thank you for

[02:32:06.320 --> 02:32:11.680]  family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the american people so why are the
[02:32:11.680 --> 02:32:17.760]  social engineers adding it to the water simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:23.040]  technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet
[02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:28.240]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies i am extremely excited to announce the exclusive

[02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:33.520]  news crew and leon you were at the fluoride meeting in austin and we've got a lot of info wars
[02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:37.040]  crews still down there uh can you give us a teaser for that because that's going to be coming up on
[02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:40.800]  the nightly news we've got a report about what's happening down there well there were a lot of
[02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:45.120]  people that showed up to voice how they felt about the fact that the city of austin is going to be
[02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:51.440]  putting at the very least a half a million taxpayer dollars to artificially fluoridating
[02:33:51.440 --> 02:33:57.280]  the water supply so just amazing to me they do this all in the name of taking care of people's
[02:33:57.280 --> 02:34:02.240]  teeth and yet you know there's a big difference in topical application of some even if it were
[02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:07.040]  safe and effective there's a big difference in the topical application of it and ingesting it
[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:12.320]  internally you know there's warnings against that and in toothpaste and how do you control the dosage
[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:17.040]  when you just dump it into the water a dosage for an adult male is going to be different than it is
[02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:22.560]  for a female for a child that's a child and even for a child that's developing that's a fetus
[02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:27.040]  how do you control that well you can't control that if you just dump it in the water it absolutely
[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:30.880]  makes no sense even for the people who want to try to argue that it's safe and effective but it
[02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:37.040]  isn't safe and effective we've seen study after study harvard has had several studies and the most
[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:42.080]  recent one that they've done along with some chinese researchers is to go back and look at multiple
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:51.200]  studies and try to quantize the amount of the iq dropping to in the population to the amount of
[02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:55.840]  the fluoride so they're trying to make a you know if you add this much fluoride to the water you're
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:35:00.960]  going to get this much drop in the iq it's not a question as to whether the iq is going to drop
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:06.400]  it's just a question as to how much exactly i mean it's just amazing and yet they tax us to do this
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:12.000]  they put it in and you can't get these people to stop why do you think that is well some people
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:17.360]  there were pretty pretty certain that it's because we're dealing with psychopaths but um you know i
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:21.440]  was an element there's definitely an element i like to give people the benefit of the doubt and
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:27.280]  say perhaps they maybe they just were too busy to actually read the warning label when they signed up
[02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:31.840]  to put hydrofluorosalic acid in the water supply you know well there's also the money thing we can
[02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:37.840]  also follow the money and we know that there was a the exactly there was a an abrupt 180 and the
[02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:44.720]  way the medical community looked at fluoridation and fluoride there was an abrupt 180 when the
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:51.680]  aluminum industry past executive of alcoa became what was then the equivalent to the head of the
[02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:57.600]  FDA and then of course they doubled down on it when it became a waste product of the nuclear
[02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:03.440]  industry after that started so what we're taking is we're taking the toxic waste from the aluminum
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:09.360]  and nuclear industries and we're paying to dump it into our drinking water i mean it'd be bad enough
[02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:14.160]  if we paid to dispose it for them but to have to actually eat it that's like doubling it down it's
[02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:17.280]  like you're not going to pay for we're going to shove it down your throat the company that we're
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:23.360]  purchasing it from the taxpayers are paying for it says right on their website you know don't put
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:30.080]  into the lakes rivers streams you don't let it leak into the air but apparently there's some magic
[02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:34.160]  wand or something that they wave here at the city of austin that makes it safe to drink as soon as it
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:38.960]  goes on the water supply it's great and back in raleigh we had we had some people who had met up on
[02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:45.120]  planet info wars and they wanted to do activism for freedom and liberty there and the first thing
[02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:49.440]  they picked was fluoride they go down talk to the raleigh city council and the raleigh city council
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:53.760]  just picks up their glasses and toast them and says they're we're going to keep doing it we don't
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:58.560]  i mean it's just amazing the arrogant sustainability and the corruption that's going on but you want
[02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:01.840]  to talk about something else to you want to talk about story that you've been following on the
[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:08.320]  nightly news about designer babies right yeah bloomberg actually reported that the us regulators
[02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:15.200]  are now kind of weighing the safety of this new technology that's uh it hopes to eliminate genetic
[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:21.280]  diseases in news in newborns so they've done this before where they've already taken like a fertilized
[02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:28.560]  egg or something but now they're actually going to be taking the dna from one dad and two mothers
[02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:36.960]  to create a disease-free child so they're disease-free yeah they hope fingers crossed yeah if they
[02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:42.400]  understand everything about dna which we would be pretty skeptical about that since it wasn't very
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:46.640]  long ago that they were saying yeah you know most of that junk dna yeah most of that junk dna and
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:50.000]  then it's like a few years later well you know we just figured out what that's for and it's no longer
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:56.000]  junk is like these are the guys yeah we're not building pianos here just nail these two boards
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:00.960]  together i mean it's it's kind of it's very frightening to see them do that and of course the
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:07.360]  fda is involved in that because they see us as agricultural products or what i mean it's the
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:13.200]  drug side of it exactly we're a biological product that's um here they've done this procedure before
[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:20.480]  in 1997 to 97 to 2003 there are about 30 children that were born with the same sort of technique
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:26.640]  and then the fda fda came in and said this is a biological product we can regulate it and so they
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:34.000]  shut the program down for using it to create humans basically so here this kind of ties in
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:39.040]  to the young lady the young girl that's been put in foster care at the boston yeah we're talking
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:45.200]  about that during the break what she's suffering from is a defective the mitochondria disease
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:51.200]  which is the exact disease that this technique here is is attempting to eradicate so here we're
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:55.360]  seeing where the government is stepping in and saying in these hospitals they're taking these
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:39:01.200]  children away who have this disease they're already taking the parent out of it uh actually the hospital
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:08.320]  calls it a parent ectomy so there really yeah really yeah there that's their little pet name for it
[02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:14.800]  exactly yeah i mean you've got one well respected hospital called tufts that says that that's a
[02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:18.800]  physical condition and then you've got another one that says that's simply a psychological
[02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:23.440]  condition the parents are seeing her condition deteriorating rapidly they believe that it is
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:28.240]  a physical condition but the government steps in the judge steps in and says you're not going to
[02:39:28.240 --> 02:39:32.960]  make that decision about your child we're going to make that decision about your child we know
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:39.440]  your child better than you do we have the interest of your child better than you do and oh by the way
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:43.360]  you can't even talk to the media about it if you do we're going to slap you with a contempt charge
[02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:48.400]  right which that's absolutely amazing but that's where they're headed right and it's just it just
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:53.600]  shows how much power the children's hospital has because these people have been treating their daughter
[02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:58.480]  for this disease for many many years and then just a year ago she gets diagnosed with this different
[02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:04.880]  mental disorder somatiform disorder and they say oh that's what she's got and now you need to stop
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:10.080]  giving her medication for that and you're over medicating her this is a very very important
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:15.760]  case right here because it brings together several different factors that we see happening
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:21.760]  and if you don't think this is going to happen more and more frequently with obama care once the
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:26.720]  government is paying for your health care they are going to be making the decisions about it and
[02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:30.480]  we've already seen them making the decisions about it we already see them dictating to people
[02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:35.680]  how much coverage you're going to have what's going to be covered forcing you to buy coverage for
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:41.040]  things that you can't use single men having to buy maternity care for example and that's why
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:45.840]  people's insurance rates are skyrocketing by factor of two by factor of five in many cases
[02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:51.760]  why they're losing why they're losing their insurance and it's because this has been written
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:56.240]  by the insurance company as alex has said from the very beginning this is not something that is
[02:40:56.240 --> 02:41:00.720]  going to make health care more affordable more accessible it's going to make it more expensive
[02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:05.520]  and more profitable for the health insurance companies it's not going to give us more access
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:11.760]  to it but what it will do is it will give the government a stranglehold on the health care
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:16.960]  situation denying people health care taking children away from families as we see happening
[02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:22.880]  here in this case in boston and perhaps if you don't get all your vaccines then maybe you don't
[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:28.080]  get any health care right well that's the issue here with these designer babies if you're you
[02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:32.640]  know someone out there who's thinking that this might be a good idea for you the FDA has already
[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:38.480]  said that this is something that they can regulate it's a biological product so who's to say that
[02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:44.240]  that they're gonna you know if you decide that you want to take care of this biological product a
[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:50.480]  certain way if they don't agree with that they can swoop in and say well this is we regulate this
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:56.240]  person is i mean do they have the same classification as you know a human and we see how they treat
[02:41:56.240 --> 02:42:02.240]  children and parents now who aren't well you know we look at these things it's over and over again
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:07.600]  it doesn't matter what aspect of your life it is whether it is making health care decisions
[02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:13.760]  about your child deciding how what kind of food you want to eat you can't have raw milk you can't
[02:42:13.760 --> 02:42:18.960]  have organic food because we're going to put those guys out of business because we have politically
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:26.720]  connected big agricultural firms we're going to make gmo legal in the united states when it's banned
[02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:30.720]  in country after country and florida is another example of it they're going to dump whatever
[02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:35.280]  they want to in our water they're going to tell us what we can do with our business with our families
[02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:40.560]  with our food with our medicine we are their slaves and they're going to tell us whatever
[02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:44.080]  they is in their best interest so they don't care what we think we don't get to make those
[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:49.840]  decisions anymore oh exactly and that's today when we were down at city hall perfect example
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:54.160]  you know there's hundreds of people in there today and you know people are going presenting
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:43:00.080]  their line item talking you know to city council they leave once theirs is addressed once it comes
[02:43:00.080 --> 02:43:07.440]  time for the general public to speak to the godly city council all these police moved in to the room
[02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:12.800]  and they kind of set up different exits and it it was just so like oh we need to make sure that
[02:43:12.800 --> 02:43:18.480]  the slaves don't get out of hand expressing their first amendment right to their elected officials
[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:24.160]  that they put into those seats well you're lucky they just just didn't send you down to a quote
[02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:29.280]  unquote free speech zone like to do at the political conventions where they take anybody who has
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:36.000]  something to say which is specifically protected speech under the first amendment they send people
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:42.000]  down and away from the conventions put them in cages I mean it's absolutely ridiculous anybody
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:45.920]  that thinks you know when I was growing up used to people say yeah you know what do you want me to
[02:43:45.920 --> 02:43:51.440]  do but it's a free country to which you never hear anybody say that anymore everybody knows deep down
[02:43:51.440 --> 02:43:56.400]  it is not a free country we don't have freedom it's why we talk about it so much as some Europeans
[02:43:56.400 --> 02:44:01.760]  that point out that's right that's right well the issue here that goes on with this with these
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:06.880]  designer babies they have no idea what the permanent change is going to be when they start messing
[02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:13.200]  with the human genome and so far they've just tested this on mice and already the mice are
[02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:19.440]  showing that they are having breathing problems as well as reduced learning and exploring capabilities
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:24.320]  and so this research of course suggests that they don't know what's going to happen when they replace
[02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:30.720]  one mitochondrial strain with another they just don't know and so basically now you're dealing with
[02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:37.280]  you have taken it upon yourself to do this to your child who had no say about whether they
[02:44:37.280 --> 02:44:44.960]  wanted to be a genetically modified human and now you know generation after generation whatever
[02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:50.160]  they have whatever kind of diseases they may produce as a result is going to continue to be
[02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:57.200]  passed down so there's no amazing and you know we've seen this with genetically modified crops
[02:44:57.200 --> 02:45:04.080]  when they the French study where they showed the massive tumors on the rat so it very just an
[02:45:04.080 --> 02:45:09.200]  amazing picture and yet they pushed back on that and they said you picked a strain of rats that
[02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:14.720]  are prone to tumors and you didn't uh what was it the number the number of them right and it turns
[02:45:14.720 --> 02:45:21.520]  out that Monsanto used exactly the same strain of rats and the exactly the same number of rats
[02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:26.800]  but Monsanto didn't run the study very long Monsanto cut off like one or two three months or
[02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:31.200]  something like that these people ran it for about a year and two years yeah and the and the rats
[02:45:31.200 --> 02:45:37.200]  break out in these massive tumors this is the way they can skew these things to get whatever results
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:42.720]  they want we heard that it heard that pushback but we didn't hear what the actual study was that
[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:48.640]  proved to the FDA satisfaction that it was safe exactly and it was Monsanto's study yes exactly
[02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:54.240]  so they do their own study arms reach exactly study there it's a very scary thing we look at
[02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:59.920]  this and and you know sometimes we have people will contact us and say what's the big deal
[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:05.520]  we've been genetically modifying animals for quite some time well it is a very big deal because
[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:11.760]  that's not when you selectively breed animals that is not the same thing as transgenic
[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:18.080]  genetic modification which is what they're doing you can go in and you can selectively breed animals
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:22.640]  and we've seen that happen with livestock we've seen that happen with dogs and you can get quite
[02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:27.840]  a bit of variation just by selective breeding within the DNA you can then also go into what's
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:35.040]  called cisgenic genetic modification you can actually directly modify the DNA of these animals
[02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:41.840]  and that's kind of dodgy okay that's that's got a lot of question marks about that but the transgenic
[02:46:41.840 --> 02:46:47.840]  is when you take DNA from completely different organisms you take yeah you take some DNA from
[02:46:47.840 --> 02:46:53.360]  a plant and you put it into an animal or you know you you cross this with that and and you know
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:58.880]  the spiders with the goat's milk exactly you get crazy that's when you get your frankenstein
[02:46:58.880 --> 02:47:04.080]  animal is your franken food and that's really where we don't know where this is happening
[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:11.840]  and yet what is the FDA's concern the FDA's concern is to shut down heritage farmers to
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:19.200]  shut down organic farmers to curtail farming practices that have fed humans for millennia
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:25.040]  right they want to shut that down put all of our eggs in one basket this new franken food
[02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:31.040]  genetically modified corporate factory produced fertilizer stuff that that's where they want
[02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:35.920]  all of our eggs to be and that one thing that's a very very dangerous thing it's very dangerous
[02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:40.880]  and it kind of falls into the whole eugenics plan because we see with the with the rat studies
[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:47.120]  genetically modified foods makes the third generation they're sterile they can no longer
[02:47:47.120 --> 02:47:53.600]  reproduce and so this is happening with humans so if you're sitting here messing now with
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:59.440]  the human genome what is to say that you're not creating a totally different species of human
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:05.600]  in a generation from now or sterile humans that can no longer reproduce and who's to say that that
[02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:11.840]  isn't their real agenda bottom line anyway alex has pointed that out over and over again that
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:17.440]  that's what many of them have been saying for a long time is exactly their agenda to do a soft kill
[02:48:17.440 --> 02:48:22.720]  to do a sterilization to do a population culling you've got uh they they openly talk about it
[02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:27.920]  the people who are in charge of the media the people who've set up these georgia guide stones
[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:33.680]  with the Ted turners that they desperately desperately want to get rid of most if not all
[02:48:33.680 --> 02:48:38.320]  the humans i mean you have this this whole guy movement that was absolutely crazy that saw
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:43.520]  human beings as a virus on the planet that had to be stamped out that's really what i think is
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:48.000]  behind this and i think a lot of these scientists do know what they're doing i don't again you know
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:54.880]  we we talk about is it a question of incompetence and mistakes or is it just outright evil what
[02:48:54.880 --> 02:48:59.120]  they're doing and you know when they say that they're going to call the population and then you
[02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:04.000]  have them doing things that are going to result in sterilization a couple of generations that we've
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:10.400]  seen happen over and over again in animal studies maybe that's just their plan right it's a safe and
[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:15.520]  effective way to slow kill that's right that's right you want to take a call on small farmers
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:19.840]  we've got kasey in south carolina he's been on the phone for a while kasey what do you think about
[02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:25.120]  this hi david highly and how are you today doing good how are you doing real well i'm kind of
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:29.760]  concerned specifically about kodak's elementary is and how it plays in exactly to what you were
[02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:35.440]  just talking about with the calling of the population i also feel it ties in with obama care
[02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:42.080]  and food rationing any thoughts on that from you all oh absolutely as we were talking when i was
[02:49:42.080 --> 02:49:47.200]  talking to paul joseph Watson he pointed out that they can see this stuff coming they they know
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:51.280]  and they see that they see that there's a food shortage coming they see food prices spiking
[02:49:51.280 --> 02:49:55.760]  we have that happening in the united states now they know that when that is when when food is
[02:49:55.760 --> 02:50:00.960]  becoming scarce they know that there's going to be civil unrest that's going to follow as a result
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:05.600]  i think it is all part of their plan i think that they're they're definitely they're doing things
[02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:10.880]  that absolutely make no sense and so you have to say that they can't really be that stupid especially
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:16.320]  when they've got documents saying that their plan is to call the population their plan is to cut back
[02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:21.280]  the food supply when you start seeing this stuff happening it's it's not necessarily incompetence
[02:50:21.280 --> 02:50:25.680]  right and they've been they've had these plans for hundreds of years so they've got their blood
[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:31.440]  lines or whatever have no problem continuing to carry on this reality that they see for themselves
[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:36.800]  you know the singularity yeah the guy who came up with the term genocide pointed out the four
[02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:41.120]  steps that happened in the ukraine i mentioned it before cut out the political leadership
[02:50:41.120 --> 02:50:47.120]  co-op the churches bring in massive immigration and cut off their food we've seen this happen
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:52.880]  over and over again it's a pattern for control a pattern for tyranny and it's been executed
[02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:58.000]  very well by stalin and now it's starting to come around us we'll be right back stay tuned

[02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:19.600]  shirt there and it's a good way to get the message out about the fact that we have a right to defend
[02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:24.880]  ourselves we have a right to feed ourselves we have a right to defend ourselves and so we hope
[02:55:24.880 --> 02:55:29.920]  that you will take a look at those when you're thinking about how you're going to make yourself
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:34.240]  self-reliant we have a lot of products there and that would help the operation if you go to info
[02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:40.880]  wars life dot com and look at our store there how about that t-shirt you like that t-shirt i do i
[02:55:40.880 --> 02:55:45.520]  helped them they were kind of going back and forth between doing the gold gold foil for the females
[02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:50.160]  and i gave it a thumbs up makes it it's a great design pretty sharp with the spartan helmets
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:55.600]  little sparkly it is a great design and you know it's a reminder that nobody ever gives you your
[02:55:55.600 --> 02:56:01.920]  freedom the spartans had to fight for it the texans had to fight for it as alex pointed out to
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:10.480]  pierce morgan the former host at cnn that uh you know it wasn't a mexican american thing at the alamo
[02:56:10.480 --> 02:56:18.640]  so pretty much every mexican uh territory rebelled against anna he was a tyrant he thrown out the
[02:56:18.640 --> 02:56:23.600]  constitution he was rewriting the laws he was doing whatever he wanted to like somebody else i know
[02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:31.120]  that's in power right now and three of those seven uh areas that rebelled against anna three of them
[02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:36.000]  created governments of their own texas was one of them texas was the only one that got its independence
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:42.720]  but it was americans it was hispanic people people who'd immigrated from america they fought side by
[02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:47.440]  side to end tyranny and you know i think it's kind of interesting that you got this vigilante group
[02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:55.840]  down in mexico now taking back their area from the corrupt police the corrupt federales and the
[02:56:55.840 --> 02:57:00.800]  drug lords that were working with the federal government down there i think it's ultimately
[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:06.240]  it comes down to you've got to be able to provide for your own defense and that's what the people
[02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:09.680]  down there in that mexican province are doing right now that vigilante group they're taking
[02:57:09.680 --> 02:57:14.080]  it back from that drug group called the night's templar but you were just telling me in the break
[02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:20.960]  that uh leon and the info wars crew were down at city hall today and they were talking about
[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:25.200]  fluoride and so we were there to give them our perspective on it we still have crew
[02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:29.360]  that's down there and you'll be able to catch that on the nightly news but you were saying that
[02:57:29.360 --> 02:57:34.720]  they were talking about urban forest tell us about this one right well that's why you know it is so
[02:57:34.720 --> 02:57:40.560]  important for people to go to these city hall meetings to go voice your opinion i mean even
[02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:45.280]  if you just walk in and go on the little computer and vote to put your opinion that you're for or
[02:57:45.280 --> 02:57:51.280]  against something it's so important because these people are sitting down there today working on
[02:57:51.280 --> 02:57:57.920]  their agenda 21 master plan so they're down there today we're just we were be fuddled it's
[02:57:57.920 --> 02:58:03.760]  their imagine austin plan and they were talking about urban forestry which is great you know i
[02:58:03.760 --> 02:58:12.320]  love trees downtown but one of the snap snafus they had was trees on private property how do we
[02:58:12.320 --> 02:58:18.880]  take over that the private property for their urban forest see there isn't any private property

[03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:55.360]  on your mind hello okay let's go to eric in tennessee eric what's on your mind
[03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:03.520]  leon are you there yep we're there how you doing all right doing well doing well glad
[03:01:04.080 --> 03:01:08.880]  to hear you guys today you always do an excellent job when alex is away thank you uh
[03:01:09.840 --> 03:01:16.320]  the thing that really to me uh people are always crying you know their milk about how their kids or
[03:01:16.320 --> 03:01:23.040]  you know again and how this and that is going on and how the state steps in people forget that
[03:01:23.040 --> 03:01:28.240]  that birth certificate that they sign when they have the kid in the hospital pretty much puts them
[03:01:28.240 --> 03:01:35.040]  in state custody from day one so i mean you know we're a deader nation they own us from the time
[03:01:35.040 --> 03:01:39.680]  that that we're born until the time that we die and they find that that certificate um
[03:01:40.480 --> 03:01:46.080]  you know if people realize that more than they do i think that people would change a lot
[03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:50.720]  quicker in this country yeah very good point and they've had and they've had court decisions where
[03:01:50.720 --> 03:01:56.640]  people have complained especially in massachusetts i think it was at a school where uh a parent was
[03:01:56.640 --> 03:02:00.960]  concerned about what his children being taught in school and they said hey you know you've when you
[03:02:00.960 --> 03:02:04.960]  bring your child to the school and turn them over you've abandoned your child to the state i mean
[03:02:04.960 --> 03:02:10.080]  we need to start rolling these things back and people need to understand really what the true
[03:02:10.080 --> 03:02:15.120]  perspective of the state is towards us they really do believe that they own us and we need to reassert
[03:02:15.120 --> 03:02:19.600]  the fact that they don't and it's an educational issue thank you very much eric let's let's go to
[03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:23.520]  i want to try to get through as many calls as we can let's go to rocko in north carolina
[03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:31.200]  hey david thanks hey i've been really amazed how all across the board no one's really covering
[03:02:31.200 --> 03:02:37.360]  in detail the plans for this article five convention there's so many players and yeah
[03:02:37.360 --> 03:02:42.640]  diverging groups coming into place you have the convention of states people uh glenn benchup
[03:02:42.640 --> 03:02:48.800]  farm board yeah mark levin rob natelson yeah that's not a that's not a solution you know what is what
[03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:53.200]  the problem is the problem is not our constitution the problem is that we've got a gang of criminals
[03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:57.440]  who are running our government who don't pay any attention to the constitution or their oath to
[03:02:57.440 --> 03:03:01.680]  it that's the real problem and unless we get that changed the constitutional convention as far as i
[03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:07.920]  can see can only make things worse because you if they don't obey the law now what makes you think
[03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:11.760]  if you had a better law they would obey that but of course they can always come in and give themselves
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:17.680]  legal cover to to remove the restrictions that they currently have is that your take on it absolutely
[03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:22.320]  that the logical fallacies are clear i i completely agree with you not only would you be trusting the
[03:03:22.320 --> 03:03:28.160]  current occupants of congress right and if they legislate allegedly that there's two years logical
[03:03:28.160 --> 03:03:34.960]  fallacies number one you're trusting these people both breakers yeah both breakers to present
[03:03:34.960 --> 03:03:39.600]  good amendments and then even if they did which would be yeah it would be hard to believe that
[03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:44.720]  would happen then you're going to trust them in congress to obey the new amendments when there
[03:03:44.720 --> 03:03:50.880]  existing the current uh constitution i think would be great if i was to get on uh stewart roads
[03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:55.440]  have a little debate with bruce fine i think would be an awesome show yeah oh yeah absolutely i agree
[03:03:55.440 --> 03:03:59.280]  with you it's it's absolutely insane to think that these people would have the integrity to
[03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:04.160]  change something but you know once they pay attention to that once the the jurisdictions of
[03:04:04.160 --> 03:04:08.080]  washington dc and chicago start paying attention to supreme court decisions on the second amendment
[03:04:08.080 --> 03:04:12.400]  as well as to the constitution then i'll agree that maybe they've got something there let's go to
[03:04:12.400 --> 03:04:16.880]  kevin and georgia kevin i can't talk hello hey how you doing what's on your mind
[03:04:18.320 --> 03:04:22.400]  yeah about solutions have you know uh do you know anything about john durrash
[03:04:23.200 --> 03:04:27.280]  uh no i don't i've only got about 20 seconds i'm sorry to cut you short but yeah tell me
[03:04:27.280 --> 03:04:31.680]  real quickly what you want to say about it national limited alliance court you want to
[03:04:31.680 --> 03:04:36.080]  bring back the common law grand jury okay that would strike that would straighten out all our
[03:04:36.080 --> 03:04:41.520]  oh yes our juries are a mess yeah i also look at fully informed jury association feature well
