[00:52.720 --> 01:01.800]  viewers joining us is Mark Dice of the resistance from Southern California who
[01:01.800 --> 01:10.800]  put out the stunning video on Monday of the majority of people he talked to in
[01:10.800 --> 01:16.200]  Southern California in San Diego saying they would sign a petition and signing
[01:16.200 --> 01:21.240]  a petition reading the petition to ban free speech in America this is not a
[01:21.240 --> 01:28.760]  joke when Cass Sunstein the White House regulations are calls for censoring the
[01:28.760 --> 01:32.600]  internet and banning conspiracy theories and that means anything he
[01:32.600 --> 01:38.600]  disagrees with we have a serious problem ladies and gentlemen and we saw
[01:38.600 --> 01:43.120]  attempts at censorship with the free speech zones and the Pentagon admitting
[01:43.120 --> 01:48.040]  they had paid bloggers in the US under Bush and all the fake news and the fake
[01:48.040 --> 01:53.280]  news packages and the buying off of the media and the provocateurs trying to
[01:53.280 --> 01:58.280]  break up the anti-war rallies and so many other things Bush did but now
[01:58.280 --> 02:05.120]  it's in ultra high gear under Barack Obama because it's just a progression in
[02:05.120 --> 02:11.400]  the tyranny so he'll be joining us in the next hour then popping in Darwin
[02:11.400 --> 02:18.880]  Bettaker of the Austin gun show they got shut down by the feds illegally he did
[02:18.880 --> 02:24.680]  get the target center which is a nice facility in South Austin not North
[02:24.680 --> 02:32.240]  Austin that's coming up with the 20th 21st of February but believe me the
[02:32.240 --> 02:35.840]  globalist minions will be there trying to shut that down again so we'll talk to
[02:35.840 --> 02:42.480]  him for about 10 15 minutes coming up in the third hour today and then Kurt
[02:42.480 --> 02:47.080]  Haskell completely vindicated I mean he's been vindicated over and over again
[02:47.080 --> 02:51.840]  remember he and his wife both lawyers they have a law firm together they were
[02:51.840 --> 02:59.760]  flying back from Europe on Christmas Day and these supposed underwear bomber
[02:59.760 --> 03:04.720]  tried to blow the plane up he saw a well-dressed man bring him on board the
[03:04.720 --> 03:10.320]  plane without passport bat past security on board the plane he saw someone
[03:10.320 --> 03:15.120]  videotaping well other witnesses as well saw them videotaping and in
[03:15.120 --> 03:19.200]  focusing their camera throughout the flight on the underwear bomber some type
[03:19.200 --> 03:23.720]  of drill or something or to make him go ahead with the drill so he would
[03:23.720 --> 03:27.720]  believe that it was a drill that's what they do they set patsies up and by the
[03:27.720 --> 03:38.040]  way he has pled not guilty the underwear bomber has so he's popping in and then
[03:38.040 --> 03:42.600]  we have Deborah Medina on in the last 30 minutes of the show the amazing
[03:42.600 --> 03:48.680]  libertarian constitutionalist true conservative anti-war anti-big government
[03:48.680 --> 03:54.200]  anti-corruption anti-fetal reserve pro-america candidate who is just surging
[03:54.200 --> 03:59.880]  in the polls if she had more time she'd win for sure but the election is just in
[03:59.880 --> 04:10.440]  a week away the the big debate is Friday that Bilo tried to shut her out of but
[04:10.440 --> 04:13.960]  thanks to protest and the fact that she went up so high in the polls after the
[04:13.960 --> 04:18.080]  first debate she has been included but we'll see if they try to skimp on the
[04:18.080 --> 04:21.800]  time and give her less time like they did in the debates the Republican primary
[04:21.800 --> 04:28.000]  debates against Ron Paul in fact we did the math back then and in almost every
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.440]  case he got the least amount of time or the second least amount of time in those
[04:33.440 --> 04:42.040]  debates so that's coming up and I saw a report that war criminal arrest warrants
[04:42.040 --> 04:48.560]  are being considered and being requested against Cheney and Bush so we called the
[04:48.560 --> 04:52.720]  man that reportedly issued them professor of law Francis A. Boyle he's in

[08:01.040 --> 08:16.320]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[08:16.320 --> 08:20.800]  we have a completely jam-packed radio broadcast today on this thursday
[08:20.800 --> 08:26.560]  28th day of january edition we got mark dice with his incredible report
[08:26.560 --> 08:30.960]  the shock video of the majority of people in san diego he randomly talked to
[08:30.960 --> 08:34.640]  signing a petition to ban free speech and to ban anyone
[08:34.640 --> 08:38.960]  under penalty of arrest for criticizing obama in any way
[08:38.960 --> 08:42.080]  this is not a joke they're openly talking about restricting and shutting
[08:42.080 --> 08:46.720]  down freedom on the web italy has now done it that's london guardian
[08:46.720 --> 08:50.960]  australia is openly announcing it quote shiny style net censorship
[08:50.960 --> 08:55.360]  under the secret un treaty you don't believe me we've covered this probably
[08:55.360 --> 08:59.040]  20 times but google secret un internet
[08:59.040 --> 09:03.520]  treaty revealed came out what three months ago where they openly talk about
[09:03.520 --> 09:06.800]  restrictions that will basically for all intents and purposes shut it down
[09:06.800 --> 09:12.880]  remember microsoft set up predominantly the control grid
[09:12.880 --> 09:19.280]  more than 15 years ago for china and bill gates gave a speech two days ago
[09:19.280 --> 09:24.320]  defending that and saying he has no problem with what china is doing
[09:24.320 --> 09:29.360]  now he has designed most of the architecture microsoft has
[09:29.360 --> 09:32.320]  and the back doors for the nsa and everything else in this country the
[09:32.320 --> 09:36.160]  cyber security takeover system microsoft has gotten most of the big
[09:36.160 --> 09:41.200]  contracts along with ibm google is nastily involved as well but not as
[09:41.200 --> 09:47.280]  not as bad from our research uh in helping set this up
[09:47.280 --> 09:50.960]  i've got to do more complete reports on that but i just wanted to
[09:50.960 --> 09:54.560]  to mention that mark dies is coming up with a full next hour we've got darwin
[09:54.560 --> 09:59.520]  beteker popping in with some good news but it's going to be a fight as well
[09:59.520 --> 10:02.080]  they're going to try to shut down the next gun show you can be assured of that
[10:02.080 --> 10:06.800]  but we need everybody there at this first event and the next event to try to
[10:06.800 --> 10:11.520]  try to sting the stingers with our video cameras and catch them in their
[10:11.520 --> 10:16.160]  attempted setups also we've got kurt haskell the
[10:16.160 --> 10:20.560]  lawyer completely vindicated sunday fbi said okay we changed our story
[10:20.560 --> 10:24.480]  six times we're changing it a seventh time mr haskell is right
[10:24.480 --> 10:27.360]  there was another man on the plane we did arrest him but we're not going to talk
[10:27.360 --> 10:30.240]  about it
[10:30.320 --> 10:36.000]  i mean that is now admitted by associated press cnn uh you name it uh from
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  the underwear bomber and if you're like okay that happened a month ago a
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.680]  month and three days ago why do we care well they're using that to put in the
[10:43.680 --> 10:47.840]  naked body scanners at courthouses at airports england is saying
[10:47.840 --> 10:51.360]  we don't care if you refuse we're not going to let you have a pat down we're
[10:51.360 --> 10:55.200]  going to record your naked body the feds tsa are now talking about
[10:55.200 --> 10:59.040]  putting these things in and shopping malls and at bus terminals and subways
[10:59.040 --> 11:01.840]  and making you go through them this is a
[11:01.840 --> 11:06.640]  act of domination an act of making you submit to hardcore tyranny
[11:06.640 --> 11:10.640]  and it will not stand so we're going to be talking to kurt haskell about that
[11:10.640 --> 11:15.600]  and clearly uh watching the state of the union last night
[11:15.600 --> 11:18.160]  i i couldn't make myself watch the whole thing
[11:18.160 --> 11:21.520]  after it was over i went to youtube and watched maybe 30 minutes of it and it
[11:21.520 --> 11:24.000]  was just everything obama said was alive
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.440]  everything was a distortion everything was a fraud everything
[11:27.440 --> 11:31.840]  just like when bush talks it's just all one giant wall
[11:31.840 --> 11:37.680]  of lies and distortions and spin and twisting
[11:37.680 --> 11:43.840]  but we will uh cover that uh in most of the third hour darman better girl just
[11:43.840 --> 11:47.600]  be with us for about 15 minutes so we're gonna have open phones
[11:47.600 --> 11:50.800]  uh kurt haskell uh is just joining us for about uh
[11:50.800 --> 11:55.520]  30 minutes as well so we'll talk about it during another 30 minute section
[11:55.520 --> 12:02.160]  of the radio broadcast today as well and bankster gate uh
[12:02.160 --> 12:07.360]  it's over for tim geithner he's going to end up being replaced
[12:07.360 --> 12:11.120]  they may wait six months until right before the election to do it but
[12:11.120 --> 12:14.480]  i would be very surprised if he isn't gone and there's calls for his
[12:14.480 --> 12:17.920]  resignation in the house and senate and the white house is now distancing
[12:17.920 --> 12:21.200]  themselves that isn't good enough you don't throw
[12:21.200 --> 12:26.400]  one of your bag men under the bus and and then satisfy the american people the
[12:26.400 --> 12:30.640]  people of the world who've been swindled we need to get bernacky to not be
[12:30.640 --> 12:35.040]  reconfirmed to a second term as the uh federal reserve
[12:35.040 --> 12:38.240]  titular figurehead the real head of the federal reserves in new york fed that
[12:38.240 --> 12:42.000]  was geithner at the time but still uh he needs to be defeated
[12:42.000 --> 12:47.440]  in his uh in his confirmation hearings but that isn't enough
[12:47.440 --> 12:52.160]  his reconformation hearings to be precise that isn't enough
[12:52.160 --> 12:55.280]  we need to
[12:56.160 --> 12:59.200]  have criminal investigations of these individuals and the good news is that's
[12:59.200 --> 13:04.640]  openly being discussed in just publications everywhere i'm not
[13:04.640 --> 13:10.160]  even looking for articles about that and i see them all over the place
[13:10.160 --> 13:12.560]  and
[13:14.080 --> 13:17.280]  the people are learning who their real enemies are these offshore private
[13:17.280 --> 13:20.720]  banks that have come in taken over our government and suck almost all the tax
[13:20.720 --> 13:24.640]  money out through corporate welfare to themselves
[13:24.640 --> 13:28.560]  so that is coming up as well and i've been watching uh
[13:28.560 --> 13:33.760]  speeches by denis kasinich by other democrats by republicans
[13:33.760 --> 13:36.960]  they have gone from a month ago saying there's no way to beat the government
[13:36.960 --> 13:41.840]  takeover of health care to come on it's the lesser of two evils it's not
[13:41.840 --> 13:47.520]  perfect to this thing is a giant scam it gives liability protection and
[13:47.520 --> 13:50.800]  allows trust to be formed monopolies to be formed
[13:50.800 --> 13:54.880]  greater monopolies we already have cartels over health care
[13:54.880 --> 13:57.840]  uh it rips off people that already have insurance
[13:57.840 --> 14:02.800]  uh it the truth is now out there about this unconstitutional monstrosity
[14:02.800 --> 14:06.080]  and now they're saying it's dead scrap the whole thing
[14:06.080 --> 14:10.000]  democrats are saying that and they're revolting saying we never
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.320]  wanted to go along with this we don't want to be politically destroyed
[14:14.320 --> 14:18.240]  our constituents are angry with us
[14:18.800 --> 14:22.080]  and some republicans are saying oh we can have a compromise
[14:22.080 --> 14:26.160]  because they want to give the money the bailout along with some of the corrupt
[14:26.160 --> 14:31.360]  democrats to the insurance companies that's all this is
[14:31.360 --> 14:36.160]  that's all it will ever be i have a another mainstream
[14:36.160 --> 14:41.680]  article out of the british news and i have another one out of the canadian
[14:41.680 --> 14:44.800]  news i'm digging around for him here oh here's
[14:44.800 --> 14:49.520]  one of them where in the last three weeks as you
[14:49.520 --> 14:54.720]  know the swine flu hoax is in full retreat i mean this is good news
[14:54.720 --> 15:00.480]  but here's one headline out of the mail drug firms drove swine flu pandemic
[15:00.480 --> 15:06.240]  warning to recoup billions of pounds spent on research
[15:06.240 --> 15:09.120]  drug companies manipulated the world health organization into downgrading
[15:09.120 --> 15:12.960]  as definition of a pandemic so they could cash in
[15:12.960 --> 15:18.160]  on a swine flu outbreak it is claimed and who's saying that
[15:18.160 --> 15:21.520]  the eu health commission 40 plus member board
[15:21.520 --> 15:24.720]  an inquiry heard yesterday that the world health organization
[15:24.720 --> 15:29.440]  allegedly softened its criteria for declaring the h1n1 flu pandemic last
[15:29.440 --> 15:34.400]  spring just weeks before announcing there was a worldwide outbreak and we're
[15:34.400 --> 15:38.000]  very close to having either the commission chairman or one of the
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.040]  members of the commission on tomorrow in fact that's nailed down right
[15:43.920 --> 15:48.000]  on the swine flu we've got one of the eu commission members on tomorrow
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.920]  i know you guys told me two days ago we did awesome this is again
[15:51.920 --> 15:56.400]  in producing live on air here we are we are very close to getting one of the
[15:56.400 --> 16:01.840]  probably the chairman on so i'm gonna it's next week now because i guess
[16:01.840 --> 16:05.040]  they're still having the hearings today tomorrow and it always goes late
[16:05.040 --> 16:10.800]  okay well whatever good job guys so we are the hounds are on their heels
[16:10.800 --> 16:16.400]  there as well so good job to everybody now obviously
[16:16.400 --> 16:20.800]  i want to get into the democratic anger goes public in prime time
[16:20.800 --> 16:24.560]  that's the guardian headline where the democrats are now publicly criticizing
[16:24.560 --> 16:28.080]  obama and saying we're not going along with this we're not
[16:28.080 --> 16:32.240]  committing political suicide and doing something that is completely unpopular
[16:32.240 --> 16:36.800]  and unconstitutional but obama urges nervous democrats to fight for his
[16:36.800 --> 16:41.680]  agenda well what is your agenda offshore and wall street interest wanting
[16:41.680 --> 16:45.760]  another scam another ripoff
[16:46.960 --> 16:50.000]  but now i want to play a clip of representative
[16:50.000 --> 16:56.240]  mica encouraging geithner to resign and grilling him here is this historic
[16:56.240 --> 17:00.480]  clip you've distanced yourself from any cover up
[17:00.480 --> 17:06.000]  before november 24th and then of course you are out of the picture from
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.760]  november 24th forward is that correct and congressman i'm not trying to
[17:09.760 --> 17:13.680]  distance myself from anything i will take out complete responsibility
[17:13.680 --> 17:17.760]  for decisions i was played a role in shaping was part of shaping
[17:17.760 --> 17:22.080]  including all decisions up to the 24th on this case and i'm happy to take
[17:22.080 --> 17:26.080]  responsibility for all decisions i've made and you were aware of a hundred
[17:26.080 --> 17:29.920]  cents a hundred cents on a day a dollar bill absolutely
[17:29.920 --> 17:37.440]  absolutely and so see right here is the oxymoron
[17:37.440 --> 17:41.120]  he's always been public saying he ordered the new york fed
[17:41.120 --> 17:45.120]  with u.s taxpayer bailout money to give a hundred
[17:45.120 --> 17:50.320]  cents on the dollar they got the money in october they
[17:50.320 --> 17:54.000]  served it out in october and november and he was at the private new york fed
[17:54.000 --> 17:57.280]  then heading it and he's always said a hundred
[17:57.280 --> 18:00.480]  cents on the dollar and then he ordered it and he's always said it's secret who
[18:00.480 --> 18:04.400]  got the money then we have the emails carrying out his policy
[18:04.400 --> 18:09.120]  ordering aig to commit massive federal crimes
[18:09.760 --> 18:12.800]  the sec didn't give him a waiver to do this
[18:12.800 --> 18:16.320]  and to keep it out of the federal filing so the public and the media
[18:16.320 --> 18:18.640]  couldn't find out that geithner was giving himself
[18:18.640 --> 18:24.080]  and his former boss paul sent in a bunch of other crooks money
[18:24.080 --> 18:27.120]  so he then lies and says i wasn't involved in that email
[18:27.120 --> 18:30.880]  that's when he got caught and then he stonewalled it
[18:30.880 --> 18:35.360]  this guy's in a lot of trouble let's continue the risk that that was posed by
[18:35.360 --> 18:40.000]  that that offer so you knew about that but you weren't attempting to cover up
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.160]  that your test of course not today okay uh so
[18:44.160 --> 18:48.320]  i believe either you made a little so even a decision there i'm sorry i'm
[18:48.320 --> 18:51.200]  watching the video right now radio listeners can't see it but i'm sure a
[18:51.200 --> 18:56.400]  lot of you watched it live i mean geithner looks like an evil elf
[18:56.400 --> 19:01.520]  and he's not a good liar i mean he is the worst liar i've ever seen
[19:01.520 --> 19:05.440]  this guy is guilty of sin i mean we know with the facts but just watching him
[19:05.440 --> 19:09.760]  it's worse than bill clinton saying uh i didn't have sex with that woman monocle
[19:09.760 --> 19:13.200]  Lewinsky shaking his finger here we go test of course not today
[19:13.200 --> 19:17.680]  okay uh so i believe either you made a bad
[19:17.680 --> 19:23.920]  decision there uh or in fact there was the attempt to cover up one
[19:23.920 --> 19:29.040]  one of the biggest bailouts backdoor bailouts uh in history isn't a bailout
[19:29.040 --> 19:32.480]  now you've tried to frame it as you did it because
[19:32.480 --> 19:35.520]  you did it in the interest of the people and the failing
[19:35.520 --> 19:40.160]  the failure of the system i'm telling you i believe these are lame excuses
[19:40.160 --> 19:44.640]  either you were in charge and did the wrong wrong thing or you participated
[19:44.640 --> 19:48.480]  in the wrong thing this to uh to me it appears like
[19:48.480 --> 19:52.800]  you know when you were uh being confirmed uh stay there folks a lot of
[19:52.800 --> 19:56.080]  kind we're gonna come back and finish up with this

[21:10.400 --> 21:14.960]  this reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system
[21:14.960 --> 21:18.960]  wisdom being lost with time the government we once entrusted to protect
[21:18.960 --> 21:21.680]  from counterfeit has colluded with private business
[21:21.680 --> 21:24.800]  creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country
[21:24.800 --> 21:28.960]  ever experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an institution
[21:28.960 --> 21:32.240]  that is not accountable to our elected government but has also caused the
[21:32.240 --> 21:35.280]  dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value

[22:12.880 --> 22:16.080]  americans at home i have tremendous influence
[22:16.080 --> 22:20.080]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[22:20.080 --> 22:25.360]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[22:25.360 --> 22:28.560]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[22:28.560 --> 22:32.960]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[22:32.960 --> 22:35.520]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[22:35.520 --> 22:39.280]  tem geithner, bernanke, and arsonists they're asking for more matches
[22:39.280 --> 22:41.840]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[22:41.840 --> 22:46.160]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc

[23:55.280 --> 24:15.600]  1-888-51 eat free to share in the secret
[24:15.600 --> 24:20.880]  all right let's continue and every single congressman basically
[24:20.880 --> 24:25.440]  grilled him i haven't watched the full three hours but every clip i've seen on
[24:25.440 --> 24:29.920]  the web of congressman after congressman republican and democrat
[24:29.920 --> 24:34.000]  they are really hammering uh tiny tim geithner
[24:34.000 --> 24:39.360]  uh let's go back to the club traversy surrounded you're not paying your taxes
[24:39.360 --> 24:43.280]  you gave lame excuses then i believe you're giving that's too important
[24:43.280 --> 24:47.680]  that's too important back about 20 seconds i mean let's not forget that
[24:47.680 --> 24:50.640]  there are now what is it the last number i saw last week was
[24:50.640 --> 24:53.680]  over 60 people high level in the white house
[24:53.680 --> 24:57.200]  they just don't pay their taxes
[24:57.680 --> 25:01.760]  how many members of congress don't pay their taxes that's a real badge of
[25:01.760 --> 25:06.640]  tyranny when the system is exempt from the laws they put over us
[25:06.640 --> 25:10.000]  just like big corporations have used the patriot act and it's continued under
[25:10.000 --> 25:16.000]  obama to make their toxic waste dumping secret why can't we have some real
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.640]  environmentalism no we're gonna have a tax on carbon
[25:18.640 --> 25:21.680]  to oxide the plants breathe because that's something that doesn't hurt the
[25:21.680 --> 25:25.360]  big boys it taxes the regular people i'm sorry i'm digressing
[25:25.360 --> 25:28.560]  here he is bringing up the taxes in history
[25:28.560 --> 25:32.160]  now you've tried to frame it as you did it because
[25:32.160 --> 25:35.920]  you did it in the interest of the people and the failing uh the failure of the
[25:35.920 --> 25:39.120]  system i'm telling you i believe these are lame
[25:39.120 --> 25:42.240]  excuses either you were in charge and did the wrong
[25:42.240 --> 25:45.680]  wrong thing or you participated in the wrong thing
[25:45.680 --> 25:49.680]  this to me it appears like you know when you were
[25:49.680 --> 25:55.200]  being confirmed a lot of controversy surrounded you're not paying your taxes
[25:55.200 --> 26:00.080]  you gave lame excuses then i believe you're giving that that is lame excuses
[26:00.080 --> 26:04.800]  now and i want my final question is why shouldn't we
[26:04.800 --> 26:09.600]  ask for your resignation as secretary of the treasury i didn't think you should
[26:09.600 --> 26:13.120]  have been secretary of the treasury when it was disclosed that you didn't pay
[26:13.120 --> 26:16.000]  your taxes because that's the highest financial
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.400]  responsibility position in the united states government so why shouldn't you
[26:20.400 --> 26:24.480]  that is that is your right that is your right to that opinion
[26:24.480 --> 26:29.120]  i have worked in public service all my life i have never been a politician
[26:29.120 --> 26:32.240]  i have served my country as carefully and ably as i can
[26:32.240 --> 26:38.720]  and it is a great pleasure to serve the country this guy made tens of millions
[26:38.720 --> 26:42.400]  a year what some years he made 13 million
[26:42.400 --> 26:47.280]  bucks or more at goldman sacks he's a former high-level goldman sacks
[26:47.280 --> 26:50.400]  executive who worked directly under the head
[26:50.400 --> 26:54.560]  the chairman of goldman sacks henry paulson
[26:54.560 --> 26:58.800]  who he was doing this hanky-panky with when paulson was the head of treasury
[26:58.800 --> 27:02.480]  and he was the head of the new york fed it was a heist
[27:02.480 --> 27:06.960]  he's a public servant our bank robbers public servants
[27:06.960 --> 27:11.360]  oh yeah geithner you do all this because you love us
[27:11.360 --> 27:15.440]  you were one of the top executives of one of the most
[27:15.440 --> 27:23.520]  vicious piratical uh just absolutely criminal
[27:23.520 --> 27:27.200]  investment banks on the planet continue with snake
[27:27.200 --> 27:31.680]  as i can and it is a great privilege to me for me to work with this president
[27:31.680 --> 27:36.080]  to help prepare the damage that that was here
[27:36.080 --> 27:41.280]  when we took office and i will do so as long as he asked me to do so
[27:41.280 --> 27:45.520]  to the best of my ability with great pride in this country and in him
[27:45.520 --> 27:49.600]  again i think you're you're punting the blame and i think you're
[27:49.600 --> 27:53.360]  trying to position yourself as uh the senator you don't know me very well
[27:53.360 --> 27:57.040]  institution and yet you don't you don't know me very well i believe that we're
[27:57.040 --> 28:00.400]  not getting the whole story we're getting a lame story
[28:00.400 --> 28:03.920]  in a monumental backdoor decision of bailout
[28:03.920 --> 28:07.680]  for which the american taxpayers will stay on the hook for
[28:07.680 --> 28:12.000]  huge amounts of money even by estimates of the treasury department there will be
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.080]  billions of dollars from this deal which either you should have been
[28:16.080 --> 28:19.920]  overseeing uh and you said you had knowledge of
[28:19.920 --> 28:24.080]  and you failed to take some steps to further protect the taxpayer interest
[28:24.080 --> 28:27.920]  uh you were either incompetent on the job
[28:27.920 --> 28:32.240]  or you were not doing uh your job and knew
[28:32.240 --> 28:36.080]  what was taking place and tried to conceal it and i think that's grounds
[28:36.080 --> 28:40.480]  for your removal congressman i was there
[28:40.480 --> 28:46.400]  i know what i was responsible for i take full responsibility and i said great
[28:46.400 --> 28:50.400]  pride in those judgments the general time to expire but the secretary may
[28:50.400 --> 28:54.720]  answer the question as he takes great pride in those judge i do i take great
[28:54.720 --> 28:58.960]  pride in those judgments and and people have a right to disagree with them
[28:58.960 --> 29:02.960]  and they have a right to go back and look at them with great care and analysis
[29:02.960 --> 29:07.280]  and i hope you will give the same care and judgment
[29:07.280 --> 29:10.880]  to looking at those decisions in retrospect with the benefit of hindsight
[29:10.880 --> 29:15.840]  that we gave in making those decisions at that time
[29:15.840 --> 29:19.120]  so there you have it ladies and gentlemen call
[29:19.120 --> 29:25.200]  after call for him to resign and guide her up there acting like he's
[29:25.200 --> 29:30.560]  completely innocent
[29:30.560 --> 29:35.600]  the good news is by fully discrediting these people
[29:35.600 --> 29:38.800]  they won't be able to run more scams in the near future
[29:38.800 --> 29:41.840]  they're already trying a new banker bailout slash

[33:13.040 --> 33:17.280]  there's a lot of amazing experts and researchers in my film fall of the
[33:17.280 --> 33:23.360]  republic one of them is dr francis boiled
[33:23.360 --> 33:26.960]  a scholar in the area of international law and human rights
[33:26.960 --> 33:32.160]  he got some of the same phd's in the special uh programs that kissinger and
[33:32.160 --> 33:35.760]  others went through they were grooming him to be a basically a super gopher for
[33:35.760 --> 33:39.360]  the new world order so he has worked in and around these people a real expert
[33:39.360 --> 33:42.880]  on what makes them tick he also drafted the u.s domestic
[33:42.880 --> 33:46.480]  implementation legislation for the biological weapons convention
[33:46.480 --> 33:49.840]  he has served as the top lawyer for many heads of state i mean if i go over his
[33:49.840 --> 33:54.000]  bio it's it's it's it's just too lengthy to cover
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.800]  he's also written many books but i've got him on today
[33:58.800 --> 34:01.760]  because i saw news reports and i wanted to find out if this was accurate that
[34:01.760 --> 34:04.400]  professor of law francis a boil the university of
[34:04.400 --> 34:08.400]  illinois college of law uh the united states of america
[34:08.400 --> 34:11.920]  has issued a complaint with the prosecutor of the international criminal
[34:11.920 --> 34:15.680]  court against the above mention for their practice of extraordinary rendition
[34:15.680 --> 34:18.960]  that's secret arrests kidnapping torture forced
[34:18.960 --> 34:22.800]  disappearance of persons in subsequent torture including u.s citizens they
[34:22.800 --> 34:26.400]  authorized that in iraq but he's specifically saying iraq and for
[34:26.400 --> 34:30.720]  criminal policy which constitutes crimes against humanity in violation of the
[34:30.720 --> 34:36.320]  rome statute which set up the icc and i've got that
[34:36.320 --> 34:41.200]  filing right here so i wanted to get him on to talk about this because you know
[34:41.200 --> 34:44.720]  obama was going to bring hope and change but since he's gotten in
[34:44.720 --> 34:48.160]  of course he's going after reportedly george bush and richard
[34:48.160 --> 34:52.080]  shaney donald rumsfeld george tenet connalisa rice alberto gonzalez
[34:52.080 --> 34:54.640]  the international criminal court the hagam and other ones we're here to find
[34:54.640 --> 34:58.480]  out the details of this or of these news reports are
[34:58.480 --> 35:03.040]  accurate or entirely accurate but then separately there's the other issue
[35:03.040 --> 35:08.000]  of the barack obama who is actually accelerating
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.320]  uh many of these policies he just doesn't put out the rhetoric about how
[35:12.320 --> 35:15.600]  the dark side is great and taking the gloves off is great and
[35:15.600 --> 35:20.240]  what's the big deal let's get tough uh but he's actually spanned rendition and
[35:20.240 --> 35:25.600]  secret camps and uh many of these uh egregious operations so i wonder if
[35:25.600 --> 35:29.760]  down the road uh doctor boyle is going to be filing something on them
[35:29.760 --> 35:32.400]  uh doctor boyle good to have you on with us well
[35:32.400 --> 35:36.960]  alex thanks for having me out in my best to your listening audience yes an
[35:36.960 --> 35:41.120]  answer to your question if you read the uh documents maybe you could post them
[35:41.120 --> 35:46.560]  on your website you will see that uh i basically threaten the
[35:46.560 --> 35:49.920]  obama administration they are continuing uh
[35:49.920 --> 35:54.400]  extraordinary rendition um there's no question about that
[35:54.400 --> 35:58.320]  this complaint is designed to go against bush
[35:58.320 --> 36:02.160]  and and you know the kingpins and the bush administration
[36:02.160 --> 36:05.840]  uh but i i did make it clear in my uh filing
[36:05.840 --> 36:10.400]  with uh mariel compo the icc prosecutor that
[36:10.400 --> 36:14.080]  you know if he's not able to stop this i'll have to file a complaint against
[36:14.080 --> 36:18.800]  uh obama i'm a you know a licensed attorney i have a professional
[36:18.800 --> 36:22.720]  obligation to investigate both the facts and the
[36:22.720 --> 36:25.840]  law before i take legal action against someone
[36:25.840 --> 36:28.960]  and in the case of bush and the rest of them
[36:28.960 --> 36:32.560]  uh we have very expensive documentation
[36:32.560 --> 36:37.360]  uh by the parliamentary assembly uh for the council of europe the so-called
[36:37.360 --> 36:41.360]  marty uh reports based on exhaustive official
[36:41.360 --> 36:46.000]  investigation of all these uh european uh states
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.800]  so that is really the heart of my uh complaint against bush and the rest of
[36:50.800 --> 36:54.560]  the factual of submissions but i just don't have
[36:54.560 --> 36:58.640]  that many facts against obama uh there might be some things out there in the
[36:58.640 --> 37:02.560]  news media but with all due respect of the lawyer you can't really rely on news
[37:02.560 --> 37:06.240]  media accounts it's not enough exactly with bush you have the white house
[37:06.240 --> 37:09.360]  lawyers john you and others and rumsfeld quotes and
[37:09.360 --> 37:14.560]  cheney bragging about it i mean they they were very uh arrogant about this
[37:14.560 --> 37:18.400]  that's right uh john you and by the are in the complaint
[37:18.400 --> 37:23.280]  um they're not listed uh as the kingpins but they are in the complaint
[37:23.280 --> 37:28.240]  um it's sort of like what happened at nuremberg you had goring and the rest
[37:28.240 --> 37:32.560]  of the kingpins there at nuremberg uh and then a separate proceeding against
[37:32.560 --> 37:37.040]  the judges and the lawyers uh but here i'm i'm going to try to sweep up
[37:37.040 --> 37:43.360]  uh the judges and lawyers too uh like uh like byby who's now a judge you
[37:43.360 --> 37:48.160]  goldsmith at uh harvard law school uh but uh you know
[37:48.160 --> 37:53.120]  i'm going after the kingpins separately what do you know about cast sunstein
[37:53.120 --> 37:56.640]  i mean have you read the papers he's the new regulatory czar we openly says
[37:56.640 --> 38:00.480]  basically in free speech in america and arrest people if they criticize the
[38:00.480 --> 38:05.200]  government yeah sunstein is uh a neoconservative
[38:05.200 --> 38:08.800]  uh you know there are neocons in the uh
[38:08.800 --> 38:13.280]  obama administration uh larry summers cast sunstein
[38:13.280 --> 38:18.240]  uh alayna kagan uh harvard law school dean now the solicitor general and on the
[38:18.240 --> 38:23.200]  very short list for the next lot in the on the supreme court and you better
[38:23.200 --> 38:27.200]  pay attention to this um she's a neocon
[38:27.200 --> 38:31.840]  uh she hired this war criminal uh goldsmith at a harvard law school when i
[38:31.840 --> 38:35.280]  tried to prevent it he's a neocon and a war criminal
[38:35.280 --> 38:40.320]  uh obama appointed her uh u.s. solicitor general which is the so-called
[38:40.320 --> 38:45.280]  tenth member of the u.s. supreme court she's in charge of
[38:45.280 --> 38:49.600]  uh the quarterbacking of all litigation in all united states
[38:49.600 --> 38:53.440]  court federal court especially the uh supreme court
[38:53.440 --> 38:57.680]  and she has been the one going into all the federal courts
[38:57.680 --> 39:04.880]  uh to argue in favor of the uh all the police state tactics that bush adopted
[39:04.880 --> 39:10.160]  uh for eight years in power there's been no retreat on any of these police
[39:10.160 --> 39:14.480]  state tactics uh it's a dire threat to this uh
[39:14.480 --> 39:18.640]  republic and when the last seat opened up on the uh
[39:18.640 --> 39:22.320]  supreme court there were only three people who got
[39:22.320 --> 39:27.120]  um uh appointments with president obama on that
[39:27.120 --> 39:32.000]  slot uh granholz harvard law school the um
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.440]  current governor of michigan who who would have been a good excellent choice
[39:35.440 --> 39:40.000]  uh kagan former dean of harvard law school where uh bomb and i went
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.160]  although the two obamas were behind me and kagan was too
[39:44.160 --> 39:49.520]  and sort of my or who got the job now the short list we know just the stevens
[39:49.520 --> 39:51.920]  will be retiring at the end of this term
[39:51.920 --> 39:56.080]  so the short list then is uh kagan maybe granholz
[39:56.080 --> 40:00.960]  and uh cast sonstein is uh on that short list that's well sir when you read
[40:00.960 --> 40:05.040]  what cast sonstein has to say i mean i i literally he's got
[40:05.040 --> 40:09.120]  more than 50 papers we posted on info wars dot com and i
[40:09.120 --> 40:12.400]  got bloodshot eyes trying to read as many as i could
[40:12.400 --> 40:16.160]  and it was it was otherworldly he said i haven't
[40:16.160 --> 40:19.920]  you know alex i haven't read all his stuff because he is
[40:19.920 --> 40:23.520]  uh a neoconservative he's completely insane but i mean to shift gears back
[40:23.520 --> 40:26.720]  he was behind me at uh harvard law school
[40:26.720 --> 40:32.640]  uh he spent most of his career teaching at the university chicago law school
[40:32.640 --> 40:35.200]  which we've discussed before i've written about
[40:35.200 --> 40:39.680]  totally right wing racist bigoted reactionary
[40:39.680 --> 40:44.160]  warmongering and totalitarian uh that seems to be the main
[40:44.160 --> 40:47.680]  the main cubby uh of where they get their lawyers but but i apologize for
[40:47.680 --> 40:50.480]  digressing i just know that you know these people someone to see what i
[40:50.480 --> 40:53.520]  cast sons remember obama taught there too
[40:53.520 --> 40:57.680]  and then what happened to show you how incestuous all these people are
[40:57.680 --> 41:01.520]  kagan taught there to move to harvard law school became
[41:01.520 --> 41:06.240]  dean then hired sunstein from the university chicago law school to go to
[41:06.240 --> 41:10.640]  harvard law school and then uh obama put him in his
[41:10.640 --> 41:14.480]  current position where he is on the very short list
[41:14.480 --> 41:20.080]  for the supreme court along with kagan so pilots better pay attention they are
[41:20.080 --> 41:23.920]  both neoconservatives kagan is a plucky for larry
[41:23.920 --> 41:27.840]  summers uh larry summers we all know him
[41:27.840 --> 41:33.120]  uh when he was president of harvard uh he put her in charge of being the dean
[41:33.120 --> 41:37.520]  at harvard law school and uh she turned the place even more far
[41:37.520 --> 41:41.520]  to the right than it had been okay now now we're running out of time here and
[41:41.520 --> 41:44.880]  i'm sorry we digress that but it isn't important to see how it's the same
[41:44.880 --> 41:48.320]  crew of course he kept gates at the pentagon so it's the same
[41:48.320 --> 41:52.080]  operation just new boss going back to your complaint
[41:52.080 --> 41:56.400]  uh you know the e u has a lot of problems but this particular commission
[41:56.400 --> 42:00.720]  the uh is one of the same groups now saying the swine flu was a hoax and
[42:00.720 --> 42:03.920]  criminal and going after him so i believe there actually are some
[42:03.920 --> 42:08.640]  obviously some good people there do you have any faith that they'll actually
[42:08.640 --> 42:12.320]  start the investigation to indict bush chaney
[42:12.320 --> 42:15.920]  uh and others and and how will this unfold
[42:15.920 --> 42:20.400]  and uh what do you see happening a what's your gut tell you be
[42:20.400 --> 42:23.840]  if they did go for it which the the facts are all out in the open
[42:23.840 --> 42:26.480]  what would the procedure be and what would you expect
[42:26.480 --> 42:30.400]  uh the uh people in washington to do i mean i would see obama
[42:30.400 --> 42:34.960]  uh protecting bush yeah i think you're right well obama has protected bush all
[42:34.960 --> 42:39.760]  up and down so far uh publicly refusal to prosecute
[42:39.760 --> 42:44.400]  and then kagan has protected all of his uh the bush positions in court
[42:44.400 --> 42:48.640]  you know this is uh a bipartisan partisan attempt to destroy the
[42:48.640 --> 42:51.840]  constitution and set up a uh a police state there's no
[42:51.840 --> 42:57.680]  question about it i have received uh official notification
[42:57.680 --> 43:03.280]  uh from the icc uh on the filing of my complaint
[43:03.280 --> 43:07.600]  uh they said they are going to uh review my complaint
[43:07.600 --> 43:12.000]  uh it's fifty uh pages type single space
[43:12.000 --> 43:16.800]  uh and they will uh return to me uh in writing
[43:16.800 --> 43:22.480]  uh i have a requested a meeting with marino ocompo himself uh we'll see
[43:22.480 --> 43:26.240]  what happens on that i do have a uh a docket number
[43:26.240 --> 43:29.440]  um you know where it goes there it's going to take them
[43:29.440 --> 43:33.040]  some time to process my uh complaint and exhibits
[43:33.040 --> 43:37.520]  and the marty reported all the rest of it so i'm you know i i can't say this is
[43:37.520 --> 43:42.480]  really um the first step uh alex i i've got it on file
[43:42.480 --> 43:47.520]  i'm sure many other people had filed complaints with the icc for one reason
[43:47.520 --> 43:51.200]  or another but they did not establish jurisdiction
[43:51.200 --> 43:56.240]  that's the critical point here um he they can't do anything unless there's
[43:56.240 --> 43:59.360]  jurisdiction under the roams and they've they've been taking the people they
[43:59.360 --> 44:02.000]  kidnapped to be tortured all over europe so
[44:02.000 --> 44:05.840]  europe has the jurisdiction i haven't read your filing right what what it is
[44:05.840 --> 44:09.920]  the united states government is not a party to the roams statue
[44:09.920 --> 44:13.680]  so for all the years of bush people were saying why don't you file a complaint
[44:13.680 --> 44:15.600]  why don't you file a complaint i said because
[44:15.600 --> 44:20.880]  there's no jurisdiction but when i read of the marty report
[44:20.880 --> 44:25.280]  uh it in the uh news media that they had been committing
[44:25.280 --> 44:28.240]  uh enforce this appearance of human beings
[44:28.240 --> 44:34.000]  and torture in icc member states i remember i was teaching my uh international
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.600]  law court human rights course and i said to my students
[44:37.600 --> 44:42.080]  now i have them uh that they were committing that's right there to the
[44:42.080 --> 44:45.840]  i mean they've got the torture camps at horse ranches and old prisons
[44:45.840 --> 44:49.120]  i mean they're in poland they're in romania they're everywhere
[44:49.120 --> 44:52.800]  that's correct and that that's all in my complaint briefly
[44:52.800 --> 44:57.040]  that's correct uh and i point out to marino copper look uh this is just to
[44:57.040 --> 45:00.960]  get the ball rolling at the fifty page complaint and this is a confirmed fact
[45:00.960 --> 45:04.720]  so europe europe will now be complicit if they don't
[45:04.720 --> 45:08.320]  repudiate this and immediately go arrest the people running these torture
[45:08.320 --> 45:12.320]  dungeons one would hope so i'm i'm not fine you know i can't file
[45:12.320 --> 45:16.240]  lawsuits against everyone i mean how can you run illegal
[45:16.240 --> 45:22.560]  extrajudicial offshore secret dungeons at private facilities in someone else's
[45:22.560 --> 45:27.520]  country that is illegal on the face of it by all measures of law
[45:27.520 --> 45:31.840]  that's correct and that's why i filed a complaint because now i have jurisdiction
[45:31.840 --> 45:35.520]  and i have it not on the basis of news media report
[45:35.520 --> 45:39.680]  but the uh an official investigation by the parliamentary assembly of europe
[45:39.680 --> 45:45.120]  that is correct uh the other thing uh going back to obama as we now know
[45:45.120 --> 45:48.960]  under obama the cia has drawn up a hit list
[45:48.960 --> 45:53.200]  of united states citizens and what they're now five people on there at least
[45:53.200 --> 45:57.280]  that they're reporting and they're going around murdering us citizens
[45:57.280 --> 46:03.600]  with no due process of law did you see israel in roiders and uh upi six years
[46:03.600 --> 46:06.000]  ago were they bragged that they will that they're

[47:14.240 --> 47:18.720]  did you see at the g20 where where the army was snatching and grabbing people
[47:18.720 --> 47:23.440]  and then it was confirmed did i see what video the army was snatching and

[47:38.240 --> 47:42.880]  saying this is already creeping into the u.s right no it's clear the world this
[47:42.880 --> 47:47.440]  is george orwell's 1984 already we're we're in it
[47:47.440 --> 47:53.280]  and the wars go on abroad obama expands the war into
[47:53.280 --> 47:58.640]  pakistan somalia uh... yemen we know that the underwear bomber that was a
[47:58.640 --> 48:02.480]  set up to justify military intervention in yemen the
[48:02.480 --> 48:06.480]  washington post reported this already we've been in yemen for a while
[48:06.480 --> 48:11.040]  um... they're threatening iran uh... and in the process of doing this they
[48:11.040 --> 48:13.840]  understand especially given the um...
[48:13.840 --> 48:17.920]  dire economic situation and and we know obama's and in the palms of all the
[48:17.920 --> 48:21.600]  bankers and and wall street the rest and that's why he has larry
[48:21.600 --> 48:25.520]  summer running the economy summers is a crook we all know that
[48:25.520 --> 48:30.000]  um... and and geithner is his uh... is his plunky uh... too
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.320]  and obama's going to give us burn a key again i mean it is bush has got
[48:34.320 --> 48:37.920]  um... but we know that the more the war squad abroad
[48:37.920 --> 48:41.600]  the more they have to repress the american uh... people
[48:41.600 --> 48:45.760]  with these police state tactics instituted by bush going after the
[48:45.760 --> 48:50.080]  break from the day in office that is even with bush even before the patriot act
[48:50.080 --> 48:53.920]  and obama is continuing that kagan is doing this
[48:53.920 --> 48:58.000]  uh... in court you've already mentioned what sunstein is calling for
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.160]  this is what faces them and if we don't stop these people
[49:02.160 --> 49:05.360]  um... they're going to set off world war three here
[49:05.360 --> 49:09.600]  and then they will have the uh... excuse they need
[49:09.600 --> 49:12.400]  to formally put the whole country under martial law
[49:12.400 --> 49:16.480]  there's no question about it in my mind and there's no doubt they're openly
[49:16.480 --> 49:19.680]  under north com admitting it in the john warner defense
[49:19.680 --> 49:23.040]  authorization act admitting it in pdd fifty one
[49:23.040 --> 49:26.960]  admittedly kidnapping and torturing people admittedly provocaturing and
[49:26.960 --> 49:30.320]  staging terror attacks and i mean that there is no doubt
[49:30.320 --> 49:34.160]  they're going for broke how do we stop them i mean you why were you picked and
[49:34.160 --> 49:37.680]  groomed to be one of their top minions why did you wake up and turn against
[49:37.680 --> 49:42.080]  them that was my agenda all along when i was seventeen
[49:42.080 --> 49:46.880]  i was so appalled by the uh... vietnam war which i had studied it
[49:46.880 --> 49:50.000]  at great length and american foreign policy
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.960]  i decided that i would get the most elite education i possibly could
[49:54.960 --> 49:58.240]  and then come out and turn it against these people because they were going to
[49:58.240 --> 50:02.800]  be more vietnam vietnam uh... was not epistotic as i thought it was
[50:02.800 --> 50:07.040]  systemic uh... so uh... i went into the bellies of east
[50:07.040 --> 50:09.760]  there i guess i would say the brain of the beast for
[50:09.760 --> 50:12.880]  ten years at the university chicago and harvard
[50:12.880 --> 50:18.240]  and then came out and and proceeded with the plan i had when i was seventeen

[54:20.000 --> 54:23.600]  dr frances a boil is our guest with us for one more segment you were finishing
[54:23.600 --> 54:28.800]  up with that other book sir oh um destroying world order that really
[54:28.800 --> 54:34.800]  starts with uh 9-11 and the bush administration and carries it up if you
[54:34.800 --> 54:39.040]  hit those three books that'll bring it up to date until
[54:39.040 --> 54:44.320]  i guess uh march i did not attempt to uh get into
[54:44.320 --> 54:48.080]  obama i sort of concluded you know with bush and my closing thoughts and
[54:48.080 --> 54:52.720]  actually i said well it seems to me we're going to get a
[54:52.720 --> 54:56.320]  uh an obama clinton holdover administration
[54:56.320 --> 55:00.400]  i didn't really anticipate obama was going to keep all the bush people
[55:00.400 --> 55:04.000]  so basically we we now have an obama bush
[55:04.000 --> 55:10.560]  clinton three administration um it's it's very unfortunate
[55:10.560 --> 55:14.560]  and so giving us a forecast of what you see unfolding they're clearly
[55:14.560 --> 55:18.720]  want to continue to try to destabilize iran they were in
[55:18.720 --> 55:21.520]  yemen three months before with thousands of us advisors that was
[55:21.520 --> 55:29.360]  actually the new york times uh and uh the bbc uh the day before christmas and
[55:29.360 --> 55:32.320]  and of course the washington post yesterday confirmed so right as they
[55:32.320 --> 55:35.520]  launched that new operation here comes the underwear bomber
[55:35.520 --> 55:39.440]  that's right that was clearly a setup uh you know since i'm on the terrorist
[55:39.440 --> 55:43.520]  watch list myself there is absolutely no way this guy could have gone through
[55:43.520 --> 55:47.680]  unless he was uh uh flagged on through and they let him through it just can't
[55:47.680 --> 55:51.600]  happen behind me u.s. citizen so of course they he was let through
[55:51.600 --> 55:56.080]  uh he was shipped out of uh you know one of these manchurian candidate types
[55:56.080 --> 56:02.480]  shipped out of uh yemen uh they poured him on uh he was flagged on through
[56:02.480 --> 56:05.680]  uh no fortunately this thing didn't work
[56:05.680 --> 56:10.160]  uh but if it had uh we all know that uh
[56:10.160 --> 56:14.080]  tommy franks has said another terrorist attack the american people will demand
[56:14.080 --> 56:19.120]  that the military shut the country down also very significant alex
[56:19.120 --> 56:23.840]  um as gates was flying back from uh pakistan
[56:23.840 --> 56:30.320]  uh he let the new york times know that he was watching the movie seven days in
[56:30.320 --> 56:37.680]  may uh seven days in may is a 1964 movie about a
[56:37.680 --> 56:42.400]  military coup d'etat against the united states government
[56:42.400 --> 56:49.040]  uh that is only stopped by one officer uh sort of like spedley butler
[56:49.040 --> 56:54.960]  stopping the uh fascist coup d'etat against fdr it's an amazing film
[56:54.960 --> 57:01.120]  yeah but the interesting point here is that gates the secretary of defense
[57:01.120 --> 57:06.640]  on a pentagon airplane flying back home to the united state
[57:06.640 --> 57:13.120]  had obviously ordered one of his uh flunkies to go out and dig up a film
[57:13.120 --> 57:20.080]  from 1964 and then show it on the way home about a military coup
[57:20.080 --> 57:24.560]  against the civilian elected government and then reveal this back to the new
[57:24.560 --> 57:30.160]  york times uh to be uh reported back home so obviously
[57:30.160 --> 57:35.120]  gates threatened a military coup uh against obama
[57:35.120 --> 57:40.640]  uh if obama doesn't do exactly what the pentagon and i agree we saw neocon
[57:40.640 --> 57:44.880]  publications say he's a communist he's weak on these wars the
[57:44.880 --> 57:47.920]  military wants to overthrow him so they're taking
[57:47.920 --> 57:51.600]  all the anger by the people for the rest of the bankers own agenda
[57:51.600 --> 57:54.560]  and then turning that back against their own puppet
[57:54.560 --> 57:58.480]  i mean that is mackey of elliom well that's correct and also
[57:58.480 --> 58:02.960]  gates was head of the ci one ci always ci
[58:02.960 --> 58:05.840]  so you have to look at what the parable here
[58:05.840 --> 58:10.080]  that you had the head of the pentagon and ci a together
[58:10.080 --> 58:13.840]  uh by means of resurrecting this movie and putting it on the plane and
[58:13.840 --> 58:19.360]  prominently showing it uh ci pentagon are threatening a military coup well
[58:19.360 --> 58:23.120]  look ron paul said in a speech two weeks ago that we're basically already
[58:23.120 --> 58:26.160]  under a military ci a coup do you agree with him
[58:26.160 --> 58:31.440]  yeah i think i think nine eleven was the coup god bless you sir we appreciate

[1:09:24.080 --> 1:09:28.240]  some of the people he talked to the vast majority that he talked to would read a
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:32.160]  petition i'm a fake petition uh saying i want to
[1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:35.680]  ban free speech i want to ban criticizing obama
[1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:39.840]  and anyone that opposes the new world order will actually read that petition
[1:09:39.840 --> 1:09:45.040]  here on air today but mark dice of the resistance it's good to have you with us
[1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:48.880]  the resistance manifesto the illuminati facts and fiction the new world order
[1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:53.440]  facts and fiction are the books and he's had two different versions of resistance
[1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:58.880]  manifesto and mark dice dot com of course is the website our websites are
[1:09:58.880 --> 1:10:02.880]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv and make no
[1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:06.400]  mistake we are on the cutting edge the front lines
[1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:11.280]  of resistance to this new world order uh mark i tell you i have never seen
[1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:16.160]  anything as stunningly powerful as what you did out there
[1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:19.600]  showing how those people would sign a petition to ban
[1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:23.040]  the first amendment yeah and you know a lot of people think that i just
[1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:27.280]  cherry picked a lot of these people i left almost everybody and then that we
[1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:31.200]  talked to one i edited out and i didn't show because i burst out laughing as
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:35.360]  soon as i started talking to them about the petition i just i couldn't
[1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:40.160]  contain myself and one other lady just for length i left out and you know my
[1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:43.600]  other petition this is a third in a series of petitions that i've done and
[1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:48.560]  this is by far the most shocking one and some people in the comments say oh well
[1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:51.840]  they just signed the petition because they didn't want to be bothered
[1:10:51.840 --> 1:10:56.480]  and and even if that were true that no you read it to him and that one guy says
[1:10:56.480 --> 1:11:00.000]  i agree yeah we need to see you know they read it
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:04.320]  listen to see that's the denial they're in denial about the flu being a hoax
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:09.520]  the man made global warming being a hoax the wmd's being a hoax 9-11 being a
[1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:12.320]  hoax the banker bailout is a hoax i mean
[1:11:12.320 --> 1:11:17.840]  the people just can't believe uh that that that that stuff is going on even
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:21.360]  when it's admitted no and even the good the one guy at the very end that stopped
[1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:24.240]  signing it as soon as i mentioned it would repeal the first amendment i
[1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:27.680]  warmed him up by saying it would it would help to stop the hate speech he
[1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:30.960]  starts signing it and i'm and i'm just coming up with the most ridiculous
[1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:34.080]  stuff i could think of off the top of my head and i can see you fighting back
[1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:37.200]  laughing every time i mean it's it's so ridiculous yeah and you know i'm
[1:11:37.200 --> 1:11:40.240]  stumbling over my words and i had to dumb myself down
[1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:42.880]  because i just couldn't believe the i was trying to think of the most
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:46.560]  ridiculous things that i could think of and i just kept saying i'm the one guy
[1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:50.480]  at the end i finally said i said what this would do is is repeal the first
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:54.400]  amendment he stops his pen right in the tracks and he scratches his name off
[1:11:54.400 --> 1:11:57.280]  and he says i don't i don't think so i'm not going to sign and then i start
[1:11:57.280 --> 1:12:00.400]  arguing with him i said well why not i mean this would be a good thing and he
[1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:04.240]  said he points to the petitioner at catford.org his phony organization
[1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:07.280]  citizens against the first amendment that i said we were with
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:11.040]  and he said i'm gonna i'll do some research on you guys so either this
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:14.880]  guy was so brain dead that he he thought that he had to go and do some
[1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:18.400]  research to see if he was with citizens against the first amendment
[1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:23.120]  or he was so cowardly that he couldn't stand up for what was right
[1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:28.000]  in the face of what was a complete lie and then one lady says she doesn't want
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:31.120]  to get rid of free speech but she does want to get rid of the second amendment
[1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:35.520]  well i almost convinced her to change her mind because you could see her just
[1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:39.760]  mindlessly like a bobblehead just a nodding and agreeing with me when i'm
[1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:42.800]  when i'm making these phony sales pitches as to why
[1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:46.240]  we should repeal this and i think the only reason why she didn't do it is
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:50.240]  because i i noticed this later that she was wearing i believe it's a shirt from
[1:12:50.240 --> 1:12:54.320]  a local christian church and so she's probably a right-wing person
[1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:57.840]  doesn't like obama and so when i started saying that it would stop criticism
[1:12:57.840 --> 1:13:01.120]  of obama i don't think she liked that very much so you know if it would have
[1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:04.640]  been uh... somebody else a different president she should perhaps
[1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:07.120]  she would have signed it but none of these people
[1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:10.240]  it shows that they're they're so brain dead that they
[1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:13.760]  the half of them don't even know what the first amendment was they didn't even
[1:13:13.760 --> 1:13:17.280]  ask me what is the first amendment why would you want to do that
[1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:21.040]  and then they they wanted to support speech just to be
[1:13:21.040 --> 1:13:25.680]  stop people from saying mean things we can't have people saying mean things
[1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:29.520]  it's it's completely absurd i mean i can't believe it and i can't believe
[1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:32.160]  that the video hasn't gone more viral than it is
[1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:35.520]  but as we know in the mainstream media wants to keep people
[1:13:35.520 --> 1:13:38.080]  dumb down so they they can't be showing people the
[1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:42.240]  that's just how lost society really is maybe this is only california
[1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:46.000]  uh... but this is a pretty affluent neighborhood this is in a place where
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:50.320]  uh... the average home i think the minimum home is five to six hundred
[1:13:50.320 --> 1:13:54.640]  thousand dollars minimum i mean some tiny little shack in the middle of
[1:13:54.640 --> 1:13:57.680]  nowhere five hundred thousand dollars is a nice
[1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:00.880]  educated area i mean i can't imagine if i would have done this
[1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:04.080]  you know inland where i live who do you think the scariest one was i mean i
[1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:07.440]  think that middle-aged uh... kind of hippie guy he was the scariest is he
[1:14:07.440 --> 1:14:10.400]  really read it he said i agree we need to shut them down
[1:14:10.400 --> 1:14:15.600]  it says in bold print repeal the first amendment and then at the end of the
[1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:18.480]  video i read the text just a short little
[1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:23.200]  three sentence text that says that we need to stop people from criticizing
[1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:27.200]  obama they're holding him back from creating the new world order
[1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:30.160]  and those kinds of protections aren't needed
[1:14:30.160 --> 1:14:33.280]  in today's society and he read through it he put his finger you can see him
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:37.040]  reading it line by line and that's why there was a little bit of dead air there
[1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:42.880]  and he actually read it and then i made sure i said you you read this right
[1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:46.320]  you're okay with that he said i don't disagree with that
[1:14:46.320 --> 1:14:50.720]  it's unbelievable because it's obama he's a fake liberal
[1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:54.240]  caught up in that false paradigm so yeah let's ban these right wingers
[1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:57.600]  but we heard the same thing from michael savage and michael reagan
[1:14:57.600 --> 1:15:02.240]  when michael reagan said murder mark dice i'll give you the gun the ammo
[1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:05.760]  i'll pay you to murder him i mean it wasn't a more clear
[1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:10.720]  solicitation of murder and uh... the fb i said that's okay
[1:15:10.720 --> 1:15:14.000]  you know that's all right he's allowed to say kill mark dice
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:19.200]  so we see the same thing uh... from right wingers that worship the republican
[1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:22.560]  party they say ban anybody that disagrees with bush's
[1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:26.880]  speech and the obama supporters say ban the
[1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:31.840]  uh... right wingers speech and so uh... basically you've got
[1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:34.640]  more than half the public that's ready to ban free speech
[1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:38.880]  in the united states i mean that shows you the type of brainwashing and all the
[1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:42.960]  mtv specials and the college in high school education where all they talk
[1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:46.080]  about is hate hate hate hate hate hate and now
[1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:50.560]  we have obama cyber security chief resigning saying the pentagon's taking
[1:15:50.560 --> 1:15:53.520]  it over obama comes out and says i may have to shut down free
[1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:57.120]  speech on the web cast sunstein his regulations are that implements all
[1:15:57.120 --> 1:16:01.920]  this says they're going to do it italy is in mainstream news announcing you
[1:16:01.920 --> 1:16:04.480]  got a register to be able to write anything on the internet
[1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:06.800]  with the government pre approve it with them
[1:16:06.800 --> 1:16:10.320]  uh... banning websites extra judicially
[1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:13.440]  uh... in australia they say we're taking the chinese model
[1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:16.560]  bill gates head of microsoft says he likes what china's doing
[1:16:16.560 --> 1:16:19.360]  doesn't have a problem with it helped design the system for him
[1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:24.400]  he's now running the nsa takeover system uh... they are really coming after our
[1:16:24.400 --> 1:16:26.560]  second amendment now the hate crime law passed
[1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:29.680]  that federalizes local police create special
[1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:33.920]  thought police commas ours uh... to to track what people are saying the myack
[1:16:33.920 --> 1:16:37.280]  homeland security reports say gun owners conservatives libertarians
[1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:40.560]  returning veterans that we're the real target of homeland security
[1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:44.720]  provocateurs are out at every tea party sound cannons at g twenty
[1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:47.760]  uh... i mean they are really coming after us
[1:16:47.760 --> 1:16:51.120]  and this is actually going on in other countries as well i mean in my new book
[1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:54.640]  there's an ad example of a woman in britain who wrote a letter to her city
[1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:58.400]  council expressing her displeasure that a gay pride parade was going to be going
[1:16:58.400 --> 1:17:01.040]  through her neighborhood into police officers
[1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:04.160]  showed up at her house and threatened to arrest her
[1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:07.840]  but there's a guy in canada that that put out an ad in the newspaper quoting
[1:17:07.840 --> 1:17:11.680]  the bible verses and he was actually fine he had to pay
[1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:15.360]  for people who complained fifteen hundred dollars each because
[1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:20.320]  they felt that it incited hatred and they're now calling
[1:17:20.320 --> 1:17:24.000]  in europe and in the united states to make it illegal to deny
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:27.520]  man-made climate change i mean they're openly announcing it
[1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:32.880]  when google recently revealed in a blogger's name this woman had a blog
[1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:36.080]  about the new york social scene and she called the one particular
[1:17:36.080 --> 1:17:41.600]  supermodel a skank you know not exactly the the worst word in the world and
[1:17:41.600 --> 1:17:46.160]  this woman sued google and they revealed the the the woman blogger's name and
[1:17:46.160 --> 1:17:49.760]  now she's being sued for millions of dollars for defamation
[1:17:49.760 --> 1:17:53.600]  for calling this woman a name that you hear on the playground every day
[1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:57.760]  uh... at school but i mean i think
[1:17:57.760 --> 1:18:01.920]  s i don't know the actual street definition or urban definition of
[1:18:01.920 --> 1:18:05.280]  skank but doesn't that just mean like somebody who dresses
[1:18:05.280 --> 1:18:09.600]  scantily like a slut i think so i mean it's not one of the
[1:18:09.600 --> 1:18:12.800]  you know seven thirty words it's not allowed on television it's certainly
[1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:16.320]  not a popular word but it's not very you know
[1:18:16.320 --> 1:18:19.760]  defaming uh... i think but i don't even know about that case but
[1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:23.120]  i mean more and more we see this happening i remember six years ago i
[1:18:23.120 --> 1:18:27.600]  interviewed uh... robin page bbc tv host of one man
[1:18:27.600 --> 1:18:31.040]  his dog he just goes to different small towns and eats their food and drinks
[1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:33.840]  their beer and and he walks around with a tv camera
[1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:37.520]  and he was at a rural affairs meeting where they're shutting down hunting
[1:18:37.520 --> 1:18:42.320]  and and and other community events and he said look we the the the rural people
[1:18:42.320 --> 1:18:45.200]  deserve the same rights as muslims and homosexuals
[1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:50.880]  and they arrested him saying the word homosexual was hateful
[1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:54.240]  well you were mentioning earlier about the pentagon paying bloggers and and
[1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:58.480]  doing fake news not just as many people know an extension of the original
[1:18:58.480 --> 1:19:02.080]  operation mockingbird program which was exposed in the seventies in a
[1:19:02.080 --> 1:19:05.840]  congressional hearing where back then they were paying two hundred and fifty
[1:19:05.840 --> 1:19:10.240]  million dollars to high-level reporters and editors in every major form of
[1:19:10.240 --> 1:19:14.960]  media adjusted for inflation that's a billion dollars
[1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:18.000]  a year they were paying it and as you know many of your listeners may know
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:21.440]  there's a pentagon white paper that was floating around where
[1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:25.200]  not only were they talking about buying off the bloggers but they were talking
[1:19:25.200 --> 1:19:30.560]  about actually hacking prominent blogs and then changing the blog
[1:19:30.560 --> 1:19:34.320]  uh... so that it in a sense they would just hack info wars dot com and then
[1:19:34.320 --> 1:19:37.840]  change the wording in some of the stories we already have that happening
[1:19:37.840 --> 1:19:41.840]  people take our stories and then change the article
[1:19:41.840 --> 1:19:44.880]  and and they take my show and edit it together
[1:19:44.880 --> 1:19:49.120]  and i mean if there's definite they tried to have co-intel pro

[1:24:57.600 --> 1:25:01.440]  the repeal of the first amendment
[1:25:01.440 --> 1:25:09.520]  beautiful day hi signature you know
[1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:13.280]  i mean in today's society we don't need i mean who are the people to say that
[1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:16.640]  they don't agree with the president anymore you know
[1:25:16.640 --> 1:25:19.920]  and he knows what's best
[1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:26.640]  so we figured best thing we'll play some more before mark leaves us but
[1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:29.840]  looking at this these two young women with this toddler
[1:25:29.840 --> 1:25:36.160]  they have no idea the type of bondage that they're bringing their family
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:40.000]  into and they just hear we're gonna be nice we're gonna ban mean people
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:43.520]  saying mean things we're gonna get rid of the first amendment and they're there
[1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:47.600]  signing it and they mean well i'm sure that they're really nice people
[1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:51.440]  they just have no conception of what it is to live in a free country mark
[1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:56.080]  and again even even if some of these people knew what was going on or knew
[1:25:56.080 --> 1:25:58.800]  what the first amendment or sort of felt coerced into it
[1:25:58.800 --> 1:26:02.640]  what does that say about society when they don't have enough of a backbone
[1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:07.120]  to stand up for what's right and will just be allow themselves to be talked
[1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:11.120]  into something that's completely 180 degrees from their own beliefs
[1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:14.160]  because they're intimidated and it's not like i'm meeting them in some dark
[1:26:14.160 --> 1:26:18.000]  alley somewhere so they're going to just sign it and say oh yes i agree so they
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:21.520]  can get away from me this this is on a public street in a beach outside of a
[1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:24.240]  shopping mall these people have no backbone no
[1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:27.200]  brain and you know what i'm hoping with this is that
[1:26:27.200 --> 1:26:30.400]  people that will will see this video that it's going viral that the perhaps
[1:26:30.400 --> 1:26:33.120]  don't know much about the first amendment or freedom of speech or
[1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:36.400]  anything will then find the rabbit hole and that's what i try to do with my
[1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:40.000]  work is i touch on a wide variety of issues
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:44.080]  that that people can grasp onto and then that will lead them down the rabbit
[1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:47.440]  hole so that they can find out what it is that's going on they can find the
[1:26:47.440 --> 1:26:51.120]  bigger issues i criticize these pop culture icon
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:55.360]  i've been somewhat successful getting into these celebrity gossip column
[1:26:55.360 --> 1:26:59.200]  making criticisms about certain things that celebrities are doing
[1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:03.600]  i believe the criticism but i think what they're doing is horrible and
[1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:06.960]  the statements i make are valid but the larger picture you know this much of the
[1:27:06.960 --> 1:27:10.720]  audience knows this is to then point people down the road
[1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:13.920]  so they can find out about the new world order and that they can become
[1:27:13.920 --> 1:27:16.880]  involved and realize i'm trying to steer them away
[1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:20.400]  from the celebrity gossip column from the celebrity worship
[1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:26.480]  well it's simple if we don't educate the public that they were never
[1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:29.600]  taught about freedom and the bill of rights and the constitution the second
[1:27:29.600 --> 1:27:32.880]  amendment the first the tenth we're going to lose it
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:37.840]  and so it is a life and death scenario not just for this republic
[1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:41.600]  but for our way of life for freedom for private property
[1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:45.280]  for our entire future to go out and to show people
[1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:50.640]  just how ignorant they really are and to understand that
[1:27:50.640 --> 1:27:54.560]  that they better start learning as much about the bill of rights and
[1:27:54.560 --> 1:27:59.040]  constitution as they do about the cults and the saints
[1:27:59.040 --> 1:28:03.440]  coming up in eight nine days at the super bowl they had better
[1:28:03.440 --> 1:28:08.400]  have a crash course in freedom fast because all of the job losses i mean
[1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:11.040]  austin's one of the wealthiest cities in the country
[1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:15.840]  one of the least hit by the depression we're going into
[1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:19.840]  all over we went to the baby store the other day
[1:28:19.840 --> 1:28:23.680]  and almost all the shops around it in a middle-class area of austin were shut
[1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:26.800]  down across the street from my house is a strip
[1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:30.640]  shopping center middle-class area they're all shutting down i mean the
[1:28:30.640 --> 1:28:33.840]  majority it's scaring me i won't be able to go to the pharmacy across the
[1:28:33.840 --> 1:28:37.120]  street i won't be able to go get a pizza i won't be able to go to the cleaners i
[1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:40.240]  won't be able to to go eat chinese food i mean it's just
[1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:44.800]  all shutting down the america is dying and the media is telling us oh
[1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:47.520]  everything's fine the economy is on the upswing
[1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:50.960]  i mean just hopes after hoax after hoax mark
[1:28:50.960 --> 1:28:55.520]  and that's why i you know with my last two books the reason the subtitle is
[1:28:55.520 --> 1:28:59.520]  facts and fiction is because i take all of this information
[1:28:59.520 --> 1:29:03.920]  about the new world order and separate it and and really look at what are the
[1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:06.960]  sources what what's the what's the source of this what's the
[1:29:06.960 --> 1:29:10.560]  credibility of that source where's this coming from what's an allegation of
[1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:15.600]  distortion and exaggeration a complete fabrication because
[1:29:15.600 --> 1:29:18.880]  they're trying to muddy the system is trying to muddy the waters as we've
[1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:22.240]  been discussing so that people get confused when they're you know

[1:33:33.600 --> 1:33:37.520]  seven eight hours of research reading government documents
[1:33:37.520 --> 1:33:42.000]  knowing that we're accurate knowing that we have so much proof it's incredible
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:46.240]  studying history experiencing things i have experienced
[1:33:46.240 --> 1:33:51.360]  things that most people wouldn't experience as a activist leader
[1:33:51.360 --> 1:33:54.480]  i remember trying to build a veteran a new house when they were going to bull
[1:33:54.480 --> 1:33:59.360]  does his old house actually the citizens had the idea
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:05.600]  and spearheading it and having co until pro we later learned
[1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:08.800]  come on and try to start fights and break up the activist and just make
[1:34:08.800 --> 1:34:12.640]  stuff up about me um they understand human psychology
[1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:16.400]  i remember being at weiko building a memorial chapel there
[1:34:16.400 --> 1:34:19.360]  and people coming in and threatening me and doing something later
[1:34:19.360 --> 1:34:23.600]  reading their names years later as fbi informants
[1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:28.240]  on december 8th erin dykes wrote an article off of mpr report
[1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:33.200]  and other uh media reports well the imam called me
[1:34:33.200 --> 1:34:36.640]  um in fact we had him on air when that palestinian activist got
[1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:40.240]  all gut up and slit open and and basically scanned
[1:34:40.240 --> 1:34:45.840]  his arms tied his legs tied thrown into lake austin thrown into the river
[1:34:45.840 --> 1:34:49.040]  they called the river the colorado they've damned up lake austin
[1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:53.120]  and the police said it was a suicide and i talked to the imam
[1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:59.200]  they said it certainly wasn't a um a suicide and then to learn that the
[1:34:59.200 --> 1:35:04.160]  admitted fbi informant who'd been sent to central america south america
[1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:08.960]  in his own words who had been sent to katrina who had been in austin trying
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:13.040]  to infiltrate 9 11 truth and trying to get them
[1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:18.000]  to fire bomb brave new books uh which is a bookstore the one of my listeners
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:23.600]  founded that i've supported uh i mean that's people need to know
[1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:28.800]  but see that's what the feds do they they go and and and and call for
[1:35:28.800 --> 1:35:31.520]  violence and and call for criminal activity
[1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:36.720]  and get everybody in fighting to run everyone off
[1:35:36.720 --> 1:35:40.800]  that's what they do and they make up elaborate lies i mean i remember a
[1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:44.560]  decade ago howl turner people constantly emailing me this
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:47.840]  guy's attacking you on his radio show this guy's writing about you
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:51.520]  this guy's going after you uh this guy's saying you're a zionist
[1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:55.840]  agent and i'm like zionist agent uh i mean i mean i'm a
[1:35:55.840 --> 1:36:00.000]  baptist go to a methodist church that's where my parents go
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:06.640]  uh i mean i'm i'm an american and then i learned that a known israeli
[1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:11.040]  diamond dealer uh brags about it put out the story
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:14.240]  i work for the vatican i mean just completely made up
[1:36:14.240 --> 1:36:19.280]  and when you experience this it's not for alex jones
[1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:24.320]  in a sick way like pt barnum said just spell my name right
[1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:28.560]  most publicity is pretty darn good except it's meant to turn people off who are
[1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:31.600]  awakening so they only in fight with each other
[1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:35.200]  and i remember all the coantel pro that was running against we are changing new
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:37.600]  york when it was first set up when i first was
[1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:40.560]  supporting it getting luke on the air he was by himself
[1:36:40.560 --> 1:36:43.440]  and then he started getting a few supporters that came to help him and
[1:36:43.440 --> 1:36:46.480]  they were trying to plant bombs on him we got the video of that they were
[1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:48.880]  trying to say he was a terrorist we know you're not a terrorist but we're going
[1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:51.520]  to set you up it's all covered in truth rising
[1:36:51.520 --> 1:36:56.560]  i remember when uh uh german talus a great member we are changed
[1:36:56.560 --> 1:37:00.800]  was protesting uh laura bush and out of the
[1:37:00.800 --> 1:37:04.320]  alleyway comes a man with a girl in a wheelchair ramming him and hitting him
[1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:08.000]  and all the witnesses saw it but the bookstore wouldn't give up the
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.880]  surveillance tape and they took him to court he was going to go to prison for
[1:37:10.880 --> 1:37:14.640]  years with felonies and we supported him financially
[1:37:14.640 --> 1:37:17.040]  it went to trial and the secret service wouldn't lie
[1:37:17.040 --> 1:37:20.720]  the apd did the secret service said no none of that's true they
[1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:24.720]  they attacked him and then the new york post had to print a retraction
[1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:28.880]  that was an attempted setup that's that that's what coantel pro does
[1:37:28.880 --> 1:37:32.880]  it was an attempted setup of luke over and over again
[1:37:32.880 --> 1:37:37.520]  uh this is what this is what they try to do
[1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:43.840]  and we called out um hal turner a decade ago
[1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:47.280]  only because he was attacking us and we were very brief we just said
[1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:50.640]  no one is allowed to threaten federal judges no one is allowed to call for
[1:37:50.640 --> 1:37:53.920]  violence every day unless they're a fit
[1:37:53.920 --> 1:37:58.560]  and the guy uh was hooked in with shon hanity and the neocons we know
[1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:04.000]  hanity is literally a cia asset it's come out cnn washington post to cia
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:08.480]  uh and now it's come out in federal court
[1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:12.640]  and the fbi is on record and the u.s attorney he is the highest level fbi
[1:38:12.640 --> 1:38:18.400]  agent there is they said national security level fbi agent
[1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:23.680]  not a uh informant they usually use x cons and people
[1:38:23.680 --> 1:38:27.440]  they've gotten to their control uh and they use some x cons here locally
[1:38:27.440 --> 1:38:30.720]  against us and when it's actually happening to you
[1:38:30.720 --> 1:38:35.440]  it's hard to believe that it's really going on it's hard to believe
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:38.560]  that it's actually happening but again and i'm going to mark dice here in a
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:42.080]  moment i he just brought this up so i thought i'd talk about it
[1:38:42.080 --> 1:38:44.880]  it's hard to believe until you've been doing this 14 years and it's been
[1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:49.040]  confirmed over and over and over and over again
[1:38:49.040 --> 1:38:52.720]  that this is the case i wanted to read to you coantel probe on an acronym for
[1:38:52.720 --> 1:38:55.360]  counterintelligence program was a series of covert
[1:38:55.360 --> 1:38:58.000]  off any legal projects conducted by the united states federal bureau of
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.960]  investigation aimed at investigating and disrupting
[1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:05.840]  distant political organizations from the united states the fbi
[1:39:05.840 --> 1:39:10.240]  used covert operations from its inception however formal coantel pro
[1:39:10.240 --> 1:39:15.600]  operations took place between 56 and 71 the fbi statement
[1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:18.720]  uh motivation at the time was protecting national security
[1:39:18.720 --> 1:39:22.000]  they're now saying covering up aig is national security preventing violence
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.960]  and maintaining the existing social and political order according to fbi
[1:39:24.960 --> 1:39:28.400]  records 85 of coantel pro resources were expended on infiltrating
[1:39:28.400 --> 1:39:32.080]  disrupting marginalizing and or subverting groups suspected of being
[1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:35.840]  subversive and then you read into this let me find the
[1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:40.800]  area where it says it uh that they would go into nonviolent
[1:39:40.800 --> 1:39:45.680]  civil rights movement including martin luther king and others
[1:39:45.680 --> 1:39:48.560]  and it says the american indian movement and other civil rights groups a
[1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:51.440]  broad range of organizations new left including students for democratic
[1:39:51.440 --> 1:39:54.880]  society the national lawyers guild on and on and on
[1:39:54.880 --> 1:39:58.320]  anyone against the vietnam war and even in uh individual student
[1:39:58.320 --> 1:40:02.880]  demonstrations with no group affiliation and then it talks about
[1:40:02.880 --> 1:40:06.160]  how in the thousands of pages of documents
[1:40:06.160 --> 1:40:10.560]  how they would do this is and and it's literally a textbook and most of
[1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:13.200]  the people that are part of it don't even know they're being led by a
[1:40:13.200 --> 1:40:17.200]  psychological warfare expert and the pentagon declassified a few years
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:21.520]  ago their 2004 manual for the third world anybody who's a leader they say
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:24.560]  they're making money because they don't want activists to ever get any
[1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:28.400]  capital to build anything real uh you ought to be the leader or that
[1:40:28.400 --> 1:40:32.720]  person wants to take over what you're doing uh or go protest them at their
[1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:36.640]  protest or split off and then it says in here
[1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:40.880]  they have them go in and call for violence
[1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:46.880]  to then run off the reasonable members that's what cast sunstein calls for in
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:49.680]  a new document a year and a half old and he's now in the white house and set to
[1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:53.280]  be the next supreme court justice when steven leaves at the end of the year
[1:40:53.280 --> 1:40:56.720]  as he said we will go into their groups we covered this a few weeks ago
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:41:00.480]  and we will pose this conspiracy theorist we will pose this anti-government
[1:41:00.480 --> 1:41:03.360]  anti-fellow reserve anti-global warming people
[1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:08.320]  and uh we will uh get everybody fighting with each other
[1:41:08.320 --> 1:41:11.120]  and then we will accuse those that were setting up
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:14.720]  of being the ones that did it and so that's why this is so important because
[1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:19.200]  then they force you to even talk about it so you have to
[1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:23.840]  educate people and then that gets people more paranoid about going out
[1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:28.080]  speaking out being involved uh going back to mark dice mark getting into
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:30.880]  howl turner we called him out over a decade ago
[1:41:30.880 --> 1:41:34.080]  you've been calling him out the last three years everything he put out was a
[1:41:34.080 --> 1:41:37.520]  hoax go ahead howl turner is a very fascinating case
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:41.680]  because yes he's he's called for violence against people and now
[1:41:41.680 --> 1:41:46.640]  he's been arrested for making these threats june of 2009 by the state and
[1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:50.320]  the feds are defending him go ahead yeah so his lawyer openly
[1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:54.720]  stated and admitted in court that he was an agent provocateur
[1:41:54.720 --> 1:41:58.720]  taught by the agency quote this is a quote from his his lawyer michael
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:03.200]  or or soco his job was to basically publish information which would cause
[1:42:03.200 --> 1:42:06.880]  other parties to act in a manner which would lead to their arrest
[1:42:06.880 --> 1:42:11.520]  now we him urging violence is one thing i mean obviously
[1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:15.440]  it wasn't to lead to their arrest it was he was to urge people to commit violent
[1:42:15.440 --> 1:42:19.280]  acts to then demonize certain groups but what's what's very interesting about
[1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:24.160]  howl turner is that in 2008 he published photos of what he claimed
[1:42:24.160 --> 1:42:27.840]  were the amaro coin and we all know that the amaro
[1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:31.840]  has been discussed by a lot of these high-level globalists and cfr people as
[1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:35.120]  the the coming regional currency so this is in the works and usually what the
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:39.200]  cfr want the cfr gets so this guy published photos
[1:42:39.200 --> 1:42:43.680]  saying that he got pictures and had an informant at the denver mint
[1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:48.560]  that sent him photos of this amaro coin then a few months later october 2008
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:53.280]  he publishes a youtube video showing what in reality it was a replica you can
[1:42:53.280 --> 1:42:57.280]  buy a marrow replica coin there are thousands of companies that will make
[1:42:57.280 --> 1:43:00.960]  any coin you want it turned out that that group was in colorado and they just
[1:43:00.960 --> 1:43:03.840]  printed some up to show what was being announced
[1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:08.160]  yeah so he goes on to say that he has a real amaro coin
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:11.520]  and that that he has an informant in the mint and he shows it
[1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:14.960]  and so you know people might think oh well maybe he was he was mistaken he
[1:43:14.960 --> 1:43:18.560]  can't have been mistaken because the month earlier he posted the photos
[1:43:18.560 --> 1:43:21.760]  the which he just took from these replica coin site
[1:43:21.760 --> 1:43:25.280]  and so he had to have been getting dozens hundreds of emails saying no that
[1:43:25.280 --> 1:43:29.520]  this is not correct photos from these replicas yeah we put up an article
[1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:33.920]  saying um look here it's a replica coin
[1:43:33.920 --> 1:43:37.680]  yeah yeah so he goes out and his video climbed to the top hundreds of thousands
[1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:41.360]  of views it was number one on google videos top 100 list when they were
[1:43:41.360 --> 1:43:44.400]  doing the the top 100 videos on google video so
[1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:48.320]  he goes out the people spread the video around look the amaro's out
[1:43:48.320 --> 1:43:51.840]  and then later on people start to realize that it was a hoax and so
[1:43:51.840 --> 1:43:55.520]  he's already admitted to be on the payroll for the fed as an agent
[1:43:55.520 --> 1:43:59.280]  provocateur to urge violence and have you seen the new court records that was
[1:43:59.280 --> 1:44:03.200]  the older ones new ones came out with the u.s attorney and fbi saying
[1:44:03.200 --> 1:44:06.720]  he was an agent yeah yeah but but what he does this is
[1:44:06.720 --> 1:44:10.080]  this is really ingenious on on his handler's part
[1:44:10.080 --> 1:44:14.720]  is to create this stir everybody started emailing this video around in his
[1:44:14.720 --> 1:44:17.520]  article from his website where he claimed to have this
[1:44:17.520 --> 1:44:20.640]  as if they're coming we're sending the amaro's to china they're not going to
[1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:23.840]  drop the dollar so everybody starts to say oh yeah
[1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:27.680]  look it's coming true and then it comes out people start looking oh no it was
[1:44:27.680 --> 1:44:29.920]  a hoax how turner the fraud it was a replica
[1:44:29.920 --> 1:44:34.640]  so what that does is then people start to dismiss the idea when they're talking
[1:44:34.640 --> 1:44:37.440]  people like us people like alex that are talking about there's a marrow coming
[1:44:37.440 --> 1:44:41.840]  there's global currency then the whole role of how turner and his hoax
[1:44:41.840 --> 1:44:45.360]  is to then get people to think oh no i heard about that that was a hoax
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:49.280]  you know don't worry about that and then to take it to the next level
[1:44:49.280 --> 1:44:52.880]  a few months after his video showing his fake amaro coin
[1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:56.640]  he then posted pictures of what he claimed to be
[1:44:56.640 --> 1:45:01.200]  the paper amaro currency so he's just continuing to recycle
[1:45:01.200 --> 1:45:06.320]  this same hoax every few months to try to spread it around there to create this
[1:45:06.320 --> 1:45:10.080]  this disinformation and muddy the water and then in his blog
[1:45:10.080 --> 1:45:15.040]  he posted that all the youtube video was pulled his youtube account was pulled
[1:45:15.040 --> 1:45:20.800]  under national security because he was destabilizing the dollar and so i mean
[1:45:20.800 --> 1:45:25.360]  that the list of hoax and that this guy has perpetuated just goes on and on and
[1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:29.520]  on and and that's his job this is admitted by his
[1:45:29.520 --> 1:45:33.120]  lawyer and so thankfully he's been arrested for making
[1:45:33.120 --> 1:45:37.200]  these these claims of of wanting to kill people but it's absurd
[1:45:37.200 --> 1:45:41.600]  that his lawyer says oh well he was just you know posting threats to urge people
[1:45:41.600 --> 1:45:43.840]  to commit acts so they could be arrested no
[1:45:43.840 --> 1:45:46.800]  now he was he was committing he was posting these things so the people
[1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:50.240]  would actually commit crimes because the FBI is not going to know what kind of
[1:45:50.240 --> 1:45:53.920]  psycho is going to read his blog post and the people's addresses that he would
[1:45:53.920 --> 1:45:56.960]  post on his website and go and harm these people
[1:45:56.960 --> 1:46:01.280]  and the intention is not to find these people before they do anything the
[1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:04.560]  intention is to get them to do it
[1:46:04.560 --> 1:46:08.640]  well you're absolutely right in fact uh there was a new hoax
[1:46:08.640 --> 1:46:14.000]  un gold hoax muddies the waters of real move towards global currency
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:16.720]  that was what a month and a half ago let me see the date on that article they
[1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:20.080]  just put on screen they have more of those i mean there's whole
[1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:24.240]  constellations of groups who don't make mistakes everybody does that
[1:46:24.240 --> 1:46:28.480]  but they knowingly and and we've also identified who's co until pro we've
[1:46:28.480 --> 1:46:31.760]  even looked into some of the corporate documents and some of the alternative
[1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:34.080]  little fake radio networks that are out there
[1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:37.840]  who their only job is attacking and and and lying about myself mainly
[1:46:37.840 --> 1:46:41.120]  because they know i'm one of the biggest bonafide real things
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:46.160]  attacking ron paul attacking myself making up things
[1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:49.680]  and they always just put out wild dis info you know
[1:46:49.680 --> 1:46:53.840]  alex jones is owned by the saudi arabians alex jones is owned by the
[1:46:53.840 --> 1:46:56.400]  brothman's a alex jones is owned by the
[1:46:56.400 --> 1:47:00.400]  scientologist uh and and the same people will be saying i'm
[1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:03.760]  owned by all of it i mean obviously that's not true even if you believe i
[1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:07.600]  was by one of those groups all of them you know the jews the vatican the
[1:47:07.600 --> 1:47:11.120]  scientologists the saudi's the kebler elves the
[1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:16.480]  you know abc owns genesis uh because uh of many satellites we've leased any
[1:47:16.480 --> 1:47:18.320]  radio owner will be laughing you have to
[1:47:18.320 --> 1:47:21.680]  lease a satellite if you want to have a gardening show or anything else
[1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:25.920]  you know a feed of thousands on it it's like five thousand dollars a month it's
[1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:28.400]  like it's like getting a road runner at your house
[1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:33.120]  so they also take kernels of things but but it's important to expose this
[1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:37.280]  so other people spend their time and energy other people listening or
[1:47:37.280 --> 1:47:40.800]  watching they know they're good so don't spend your
[1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:44.480]  time in fighting with each other spend your time
[1:47:44.480 --> 1:47:48.640]  you know the mark of an avocado is they always want to attack any real leaders
[1:47:48.640 --> 1:47:52.160]  they always want to break up real groups they always want to call
[1:47:52.160 --> 1:47:56.560]  for violence they always want to spread this info they don't want you
[1:47:56.560 --> 1:48:00.800]  to go out and be your own leader they don't want you to go out and wake people
[1:48:00.800 --> 1:48:03.680]  up they just want to i mean why do they have riot police
[1:48:03.680 --> 1:48:06.240]  at every event and at every event they get caught
[1:48:06.240 --> 1:48:09.600]  in the news the police attacking their own police in front of news cameras
[1:48:09.600 --> 1:48:13.280]  dressed up like anarchists until no one wants to go out and protest
[1:48:13.280 --> 1:48:16.480]  because you don't want to get rubber bulleted or or hit with a sound cannon
[1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:20.240]  or a microwave gun and they just do this over and over
[1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:24.400]  and over again until americans don't want to go out and protest
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:28.320]  they have effectively with with free speech zones and the rest of it
[1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:32.080]  killed most protesting and any protest i've ever had
[1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:35.920]  you know people show up to try to disrupt it and then they say
[1:48:35.920 --> 1:48:39.600]  you are the disruptor so that's how you can always tell
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:43.920]  the co-intel pro and the useful idiots that they've got working for a mark
[1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:48.080]  you know i've launched a program to help to try to reach out to the mainstream
[1:48:48.080 --> 1:48:51.440]  audience and uh you know some of the hand of these listeners glenn beck
[1:48:51.440 --> 1:48:54.320]  listeners i mean a lot of them are just well to do
[1:48:54.320 --> 1:48:57.760]  trying to find the truth and and don't see these people for what they are so i'm
[1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:00.880]  launching a program details are at mark dice dot com

[1:49:37.280 --> 1:49:41.040]  shows and a lot of people know that i've kind of i'm kind of known for
[1:49:41.040 --> 1:49:45.200]  compulsively calling into these shows and imposing the audio on youtube and
[1:49:45.200 --> 1:49:48.480]  showing how they and if we can get millions of our activist listeners to
[1:49:48.480 --> 1:49:52.560]  start doing this it will devastate them you know it's come out the white house
[1:49:52.560 --> 1:49:54.800]  is doing all these fake letters to the editor
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:58.640]  of course they are well we're just getting real citizens who are angry
[1:49:58.640 --> 1:50:01.920]  to really let their voice be heard if there wasn't power and letters to the
[1:50:01.920 --> 1:50:05.120]  editor if there wasn't power in calling into radio talk shows
[1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:09.120]  they wouldn't be faking it themselves and that's why they have the call
[1:50:09.120 --> 1:50:12.560]  screeners to make sure that your question or your comment is going to be on par
[1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:15.840]  with what the host believes and if it if it's counter to what the host believes
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:19.040]  sometimes they'll let the the call around to the call you gotta if it's a
[1:50:19.040 --> 1:50:21.920]  fake right wing show you got a call in an act like a dumb liberal to get on
[1:50:21.920 --> 1:50:26.720]  that's the way yeah you have to either you know subscribe to their ideology or
[1:50:26.720 --> 1:50:30.080]  act like a complete moron so they can ridicule you and this is all detailed
[1:50:30.080 --> 1:50:34.320]  in the quick article on how you can get on the show how to bypass the screener
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:37.840]  and so i just hope everybody checks it out and just imagine if we can get
[1:50:37.840 --> 1:50:41.600]  multiple calls into all these shows every day for the next month or two
[1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:45.200]  how bad is Sean Hannity gonna squirm and then when people start hearing about
[1:50:45.200 --> 1:50:48.080]  these issues or start hearing about certain things
[1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:51.680]  certain videos certain books people are gonna google it thousands of people are

[2:01:38.800 --> 2:01:43.440]  because it's that true diversity that and that true lone wolf operation the
[2:01:43.440 --> 2:01:46.320]  globalist can't stop and let me warn you for listeners
[2:01:46.320 --> 2:01:49.840]  and i'm sure mark already knows this the first batch of people that show up
[2:01:49.840 --> 2:01:53.520]  wanting to help you they're operatives or they're crooks
[2:01:53.520 --> 2:01:58.800]  the next wave is you cannot hire people that ask for jobs
[2:01:58.800 --> 2:02:02.400]  50 of the time they are literal co until pro

[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:13.440]  you've got to hire totally separate people or they will
[2:02:13.440 --> 2:02:17.120]  burn your operation down go ahead people email me all the time that live in my
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:19.680]  area in my community and then they say oh hey let's

[2:02:22.640 --> 2:02:24.720]  mean i'm not going to work with these people it's just
[2:02:24.720 --> 2:02:28.320]  i have my own personal crew of people that my inner circle that i trust that i
[2:02:28.320 --> 2:02:31.520]  know that work with me because we're friends not because
[2:02:31.520 --> 2:02:35.120]  you know i'm on some pedestal for them you don't need me i mean look at what i've

[2:08:09.600 --> 2:08:35.840]  okay for one segment we have darwin bettaker and while the gun show was
[2:08:35.840 --> 2:08:40.800]  still going on what is it two Sundays ago now
[2:08:40.800 --> 2:08:47.200]  two Sundays and four days ago a good caller called in and told me that they
[2:08:47.200 --> 2:08:50.480]  had made them put up these signs saying you can't have private sales of firearms
[2:08:50.480 --> 2:08:54.160]  and we read on air the law that private sales are legal all over the country but
[2:08:54.160 --> 2:08:57.680]  a few states where they've passed unconstitutional laws
[2:08:57.680 --> 2:09:01.120]  we still haven't found out how they ran the saxet off but we know they did run it
[2:09:01.120 --> 2:09:04.400]  off they thought darwin bettaker at the austin gun show
[2:09:04.400 --> 2:09:08.640]  was the old group they'd run off so we know that
[2:09:08.640 --> 2:09:13.040]  and we just simply wanted to investigate and find out who was who
[2:09:13.040 --> 2:09:18.000]  who the bad guys are who the good guys are and uh to set the record straight and
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:23.200]  i believe darwin he's on the inside of this uh this uh
[2:09:23.200 --> 2:09:27.360]  former police officer uh who was the head of the event center
[2:09:27.360 --> 2:09:30.960]  had nothing to do and actually did defend in the meeting
[2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:33.840]  and elsewhere and was not playing good cop bad cop give us
[2:09:33.840 --> 2:09:40.240]  his name again to remind us kell they didn't have you up yet say it again
[2:09:40.240 --> 2:09:44.080]  it's andrew perkel perkel that's right and so
[2:09:44.080 --> 2:09:47.440]  and so he really did try to keep the gun show where it had been for almost two
[2:09:47.440 --> 2:09:50.560]  decades exactly he definitely fought for us inside the
[2:09:50.560 --> 2:09:54.640]  meeting well that's good um now moving on from
[2:09:54.640 --> 2:09:58.720]  there we have the goodness we have the good news uh was a great
[2:09:58.720 --> 2:10:00.800]  success i'd say 80 percent of the folks came out to the
[2:10:00.800 --> 2:10:04.560]  demonstration with several other groups there i don't get permits for protest
[2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:07.600]  in austin because you don't need permits that sets a very bad precedent but
[2:10:07.600 --> 2:10:10.000]  there were several other groups out there but
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:16.800]  overall it was very very very uh a successful rally i'd say over 300 people
[2:10:16.800 --> 2:10:21.120]  there total front page of the statesman i didn't see it but i was told by family
[2:10:21.120 --> 2:10:24.960]  uh and uh there's now a state investigation going on
[2:10:24.960 --> 2:10:28.640]  governor rick perry says he's looking into it overall darwin i think this has
[2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:32.320]  been a pretty good uh success fighting back against these people
[2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:36.400]  yeah absolutely i mean we we definitely got the word out and
[2:10:36.400 --> 2:10:39.760]  created a lot of buzz and for you know a lot of people that didn't know what
[2:10:39.760 --> 2:10:43.120]  was going on uh see how their how their
[2:10:43.120 --> 2:10:46.160]  inside government is working and treating them so overall is a great
[2:10:46.160 --> 2:10:50.240]  success absolutely and we have some more good news
[2:10:50.240 --> 2:10:55.040]  um you got news yesterday and called us that you were able to get another good
[2:10:55.040 --> 2:10:57.680]  center uh where you'd previously had some gun
[2:10:57.680 --> 2:11:01.440]  shows before they ran off the saxet this time in south austin
[2:11:01.440 --> 2:11:05.360]  and coming up next month it is on yes there uh
[2:11:05.360 --> 2:11:10.960]  february 20th and 21st the third weekend of february we'll be back at the target
[2:11:10.960 --> 2:11:16.160]  building which is exit 228 william cannon off of ih 35
[2:11:16.160 --> 2:11:22.560]  those old super target building now i want everybody to come out to
[2:11:22.560 --> 2:11:26.240]  this to make sure that they don't because it financially
[2:11:26.240 --> 2:11:29.760]  as you said you only run two shows was devastating you have gotten quite a bit
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:35.040]  of support now uh in small donations uh at the texas gun show dot net
[2:11:35.040 --> 2:11:39.120]  but we need to ensure that there is a gun show in central texas now that they've
[2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:44.160]  harassed h e b are you worried about them harassing the owners of the target
[2:11:44.160 --> 2:11:47.200]  center uh but as the governor said if this happens
[2:11:47.200 --> 2:11:50.160]  again it is definitely harassment and racketeering
[2:11:50.160 --> 2:11:53.760]  yeah no i'm not i'm not afraid of it happening on this one because
[2:11:53.760 --> 2:11:57.520]  i mean we we got them on tape saying you know if it if it happens again it's
[2:11:57.520 --> 2:12:01.200]  definitely it's definitely uh racketeering and what you said so no
[2:12:01.200 --> 2:12:03.840]  i'm not i'm not worried about them coming over there making a
[2:12:03.840 --> 2:12:07.680]  big stink at the next show because they know over there the person that
[2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:11.520]  decides what goes on is me so they know they're barking up the wrong
[2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:15.520]  tree they they can't strong arm and somebody into forcing it out like they
[2:12:15.520 --> 2:12:18.720]  did last time i think it's smart to do with a lot of
[2:12:18.720 --> 2:12:20.880]  other gun shows have done and you may have already been doing this but just
[2:12:20.880 --> 2:12:24.720]  have a one-page printout sheet for private sellers who have it on their
[2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:29.440]  back or on a table that without the government involved that's fine
[2:12:29.440 --> 2:12:33.600]  uh but ask for a texas id and ask them to be a
[2:12:33.600 --> 2:12:37.680]  felon but it turns out that i met the fella at the
[2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:41.520]  demonstration he seemed like a good guy i mean he seemed genuine in what he was
[2:12:41.520 --> 2:12:45.200]  saying and this is what witnesses told me separately
[2:12:45.200 --> 2:12:48.800]  that they kept sending illegals up to him saying
[2:12:48.800 --> 2:12:52.080]  i don't have a driver's license sell me a gun and he said no even though he
[2:12:52.080 --> 2:12:56.880]  legally could under private seller uh he was going the extra mile
[2:12:56.880 --> 2:13:00.560]  and then they brought somebody in with a fake id
[2:13:00.560 --> 2:13:05.040]  who will they said it was fake took him outside threatened to arrest him and
[2:13:05.040 --> 2:13:07.760]  said don't you feel bad he said no i didn't do anything wrong and they let
[2:13:07.760 --> 2:13:11.040]  him go then they told the media they're been an arrest
[2:13:11.040 --> 2:13:15.760]  this was a hoax yeah and they did it they did it just so they could go back to
[2:13:15.760 --> 2:13:19.200]  h.e.b. and and say see even though it was a different promoter
[2:13:19.200 --> 2:13:22.560]  nothing's changed we still had an arrest in the parking lot
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:26.240]  that's exactly why they did that on saturday
[2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:31.200]  i think the only unsolved mystery here i mean we know they ran sex it out who
[2:13:31.200 --> 2:13:35.120]  were great folks been there since i was in high school and college so we're
[2:13:35.120 --> 2:13:38.560]  talking 17 18 years i mean i was in high school 18 years ago
[2:13:38.560 --> 2:13:42.000]  hard to believe i'm getting that old i've been out of high school as long as
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:45.680]  i was in in school and since i was born uh but i'm
[2:13:45.680 --> 2:13:50.080]  getting to be an old dog now 36 next week but uh
[2:13:50.080 --> 2:13:53.120]  saxet we've tried to contact them they're a lot bigger they probably just
[2:13:53.120 --> 2:13:56.480]  want to move on but they need to defend the second amendment
[2:13:56.480 --> 2:14:00.800]  and we need to well i mean specifically darwin they thought you were the saxet
[2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:05.040]  what did they say to you as the saxet well they the reason they thought we
[2:14:05.040 --> 2:14:09.360]  were the saxet is because uh we filled in the same weekend
[2:14:09.360 --> 2:14:12.640]  and they didn't there was no there was no month that skipped where there wasn't a
[2:14:12.640 --> 2:14:15.120]  show and there so when they invited us to the
[2:14:15.120 --> 2:14:17.440]  meeting obviously they thought we were a saxet but
[2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:21.440]  when they started reading off all the different incidences that had happened
[2:14:21.440 --> 2:14:25.760]  they all happened at the other show and then that's when i told them well
[2:14:25.760 --> 2:14:28.800]  you're reading off something that doesn't even pertain to me
[2:14:28.800 --> 2:14:32.720]  and they were like what you know they didn't even realize that we were
[2:14:32.720 --> 2:14:36.640]  a different show all together which upset me and then on the news you know i
[2:14:36.640 --> 2:14:40.720]  listened to one of the reports and instead were you know uh
[2:14:40.720 --> 2:14:43.520]  well we were the gun show where all all this stuff that happened all these
[2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:46.720]  different instances that happened which wasn't true because we've only been
[2:14:46.720 --> 2:14:50.160]  there three shows but darwin it was far worse than that and again this isn't
[2:14:50.160 --> 2:14:53.360]  just about texas of the second amendment or the justice department
[2:14:53.360 --> 2:14:57.120]  now the news now admits basically called for this from the apd so this is
[2:14:57.120 --> 2:15:01.120]  obama uh there's the issue of media lying
[2:15:01.120 --> 2:15:05.920]  and saying it's the law you gotta have paperwork what's the big deal
[2:15:05.920 --> 2:15:10.480]  yeah no it it it's upsetting because they just basically make
[2:15:10.480 --> 2:15:13.920]  make rules as they go along and they feel because that they believe it that
[2:15:13.920 --> 2:15:18.480]  it's true and i mean you can't get farther from the truth
[2:15:18.480 --> 2:15:23.440]  well i'm going to be down there both days off and on
[2:15:23.440 --> 2:15:28.400]  uh maybe we can even do a live broadcast from there sunday but
[2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:35.040]  uh the issue is we're going to be there you've authorized us to be inside
[2:15:35.040 --> 2:15:39.360]  with cameras uh i need to talk to you privately about come and tell pro because
[2:15:39.360 --> 2:15:41.360]  you'll invite me there and i'll be there and there'll be a group showing up
[2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:44.320]  saying get out of here and i'm supposed to be here and they'll do another hoax
[2:15:44.320 --> 2:15:48.080]  uh but that's what come and tell pro does uh and we're
[2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:51.680]  lucradowski's putting report out on this today and one separate issue
[2:15:51.680 --> 2:15:59.200]  but or tonight it's just it's so amazing to to to see the things they do i mean
[2:15:59.200 --> 2:16:02.800]  they ran fake stings on you you're now experiencing
[2:16:02.800 --> 2:16:07.040]  the long arm of the dirty law and that they really do do this and they really
[2:16:07.040 --> 2:16:10.640]  do lie and they really do twist and make you and i
[2:16:10.640 --> 2:16:17.920]  the bad guy uh darwin uh so it's very important for everybody to come out to
[2:16:17.920 --> 2:16:21.120]  this event you know people should rent tables
[2:16:21.120 --> 2:16:24.480]  i'll get a table we'll have our books and videos there i'll be there signing
[2:16:24.480 --> 2:16:28.480]  books signing videos uh and when i'm not there i'll
[2:16:28.480 --> 2:16:32.240]  have my crew there and you might want to tell the cops because you say the cops
[2:16:32.240 --> 2:16:36.400]  without warrants just always the detectives and vatf just walk in the
[2:16:36.400 --> 2:16:39.360]  back door like they own the place are you going to put them on notice that
[2:16:39.360 --> 2:16:42.800]  that's your business they've got to uh ask permission before they enter
[2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:46.560]  absolutely uh absolutely i mean i'll i'll put it
[2:16:46.560 --> 2:16:49.920]  i'll do a formal announcement i'll write them a letter saying that you know if
[2:16:49.920 --> 2:16:55.200]  they want to if they want to come in they got to have a warrant with them
[2:16:55.200 --> 2:17:00.800]  now you're going to rent some police officers though uh to be at the front
[2:17:00.800 --> 2:17:04.080]  yeah absolutely because we need good officers there
[2:17:04.080 --> 2:17:08.240]  again we're not saying the police are bad i kind of went wild when cops were
[2:17:08.240 --> 2:17:12.320]  laughing at us and flipping us off and taking photos of people in the windows
[2:17:12.320 --> 2:17:15.440]  but but those were thug cops that wanted to come to the window and make fun of
[2:17:15.440 --> 2:17:20.080]  us some of them weren't thugs they were agreeing with us and my dad
[2:17:20.080 --> 2:17:24.000]  went around with copies the law i i didn't even know he'd come
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:30.720]  but he left uh and uh but but he talked a whole bunch of police
[2:17:30.720 --> 2:17:34.480]  who were down the street watching us and they would say look we know
[2:17:34.480 --> 2:17:37.520]  and and and they would hold their blackberry with the law and say i was
[2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:41.120]  just reading it yes we know we know this is wrong thank you
[2:17:41.120 --> 2:17:44.400]  so the good news is austin police are upset about this
[2:17:44.400 --> 2:17:47.840]  absolutely i've had phone calls from four of them
[2:17:47.840 --> 2:17:51.760]  uh that called me to express you know the concern and
[2:17:51.760 --> 2:17:54.880]  saying that you know they're behind me and when we find a new building that
[2:17:54.880 --> 2:17:58.560]  they'll be there and they'll show their support by coming to the next show so
[2:17:58.560 --> 2:18:02.880]  i mean uh yeah by far not all the cops and and also not bad it's just a few
[2:18:02.880 --> 2:18:06.640]  bad things that they have uh working for them
[2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:11.360]  well it's the guys at the top and then i mean watching those detectives in the
[2:18:11.360 --> 2:18:13.920]  press conferences they didn't look like evil people
[2:18:13.920 --> 2:18:16.880]  they look like they really thought they were doing good because the feds came
[2:18:16.880 --> 2:18:21.760]  in and told them do this yeah yeah i didn't get it i didn't get a
[2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:25.120]  sense that you know they were evil people i just got a sense that
[2:18:25.120 --> 2:18:29.200]  they didn't they didn't stand up for what truly is right they
[2:18:29.200 --> 2:18:33.120]  think that they they had an order they took it and they followed through on it
[2:18:33.120 --> 2:18:37.840]  thinking they were doing a good job but uh that's i mean that's their downfall
[2:18:37.840 --> 2:18:41.360]  you know not following not following their true their true order which is
[2:18:41.360 --> 2:18:47.280]  right absolutely well again a texas gun shows

[2:21:09.760 --> 2:21:13.760]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[2:21:13.760 --> 2:21:16.960]  the americans at home i've determined its influence
[2:21:16.960 --> 2:21:21.360]  on our president and congress and they really are calling the shards i think
[2:21:21.360 --> 2:21:25.600]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay

[2:21:28.240 --> 2:21:31.680]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[2:21:35.840 --> 2:21:38.640]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[2:21:38.640 --> 2:21:42.000]  they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:44.800]  checkout to. Today seems like nobody does care
[2:21:44.800 --> 2:21:48.320]  and right now in washington dc we have seen

[2:24:06.720 --> 2:24:13.360]  Kurt Haskell absolutely vindicated in quadruplicate the lawyer with his wife
[2:24:13.360 --> 2:24:16.800]  flying back from Amsterdam Christmas Day with the underwear bomber.
[2:24:16.800 --> 2:24:20.080]  They now admit we did arrest a supposed terrorist. We won't say what we did with
[2:24:20.080 --> 2:24:22.640]  him. We were tracking someone. Why did they lie
[2:24:22.640 --> 2:24:25.280]  about that and everything else the smart dress man?
[2:24:25.280 --> 2:24:28.080]  This is big because they're relaunching their al-Qaeda
[2:24:28.080 --> 2:24:31.680]  is going to get us garbage. He did that in the state of the union last night.
[2:24:31.680 --> 2:24:35.200]  That's coming up for about 30 minutes the next hour then the last 30 minutes
[2:24:35.200 --> 2:24:39.520]  Deborah Medina going into the big debate tomorrow night. This has national
[2:24:39.520 --> 2:24:44.000]  implications just as big as what we saw with Brown
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:47.760]  potentially in Massachusetts. That's why this is so important
[2:24:47.760 --> 2:24:52.400]  for the national audience. She is an in the fed, died in the wool, Ron Paul
[2:24:52.400 --> 2:24:58.320]  Alex Jones, patriot supporting, you know, absolutely wonderful.
[2:24:58.320 --> 2:25:01.440]  In fact, I had Deborah Medina invite me down to Ron Paul events. I got invited
[2:25:01.440 --> 2:25:05.920]  down by the Ron Paul folks to his last event in the fed and I just couldn't
[2:25:05.920 --> 2:25:09.360]  go. I didn't go. I need to get involved more in
[2:25:09.360 --> 2:25:13.280]  events. I need to come out to more events. It just we're so tied down here with
[2:25:13.280 --> 2:25:16.400]  the electronic media where I can reach millions of people
[2:25:16.400 --> 2:25:21.600]  every day. Program notes, I haven't plugged this and I like the trailer
[2:25:21.600 --> 2:25:24.960]  that was made, but it doesn't even really capture how powerful the film is.
[2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:28.320]  So we're going to make another trailer. I consulted on it.
[2:25:28.320 --> 2:25:32.480]  This film was five years in the making. It's how we'd won the West. Now I've
[2:25:32.480 --> 2:25:37.520]  told everybody I don't smoke marijuana. I don't like marijuana.
[2:25:37.520 --> 2:25:40.720]  I have smoked it in high school here and there and in college or you know had a
[2:25:40.720 --> 2:25:44.560]  girlfriend. Hey, smoked this.
[2:25:44.960 --> 2:25:49.360]  But I know it has more medical uses than any plant we've ever seen.
[2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:53.600]  I know they banned regular hemp that has no THC that's better than cotton
[2:25:53.600 --> 2:25:57.520]  that can be grown anywhere in the U.S. Really hurt our farmers.
[2:25:57.520 --> 2:26:00.800]  I know this was done by the big chemical companies.
[2:26:00.800 --> 2:26:04.720]  That's on record. They had just had prohibition and
[2:26:04.720 --> 2:26:08.000]  they couldn't make money for the mafia and the corrupt police off alcohol
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:10.240]  anymore. So all they had was gambling and
[2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:13.600]  prostitution. So they went into narcotics and
[2:26:13.600 --> 2:26:16.960]  they started with marijuana and they banned everything else which they
[2:26:16.960 --> 2:26:20.560]  shouldn't be readily available. Heroin and cocaine are horrible.
[2:26:20.560 --> 2:26:24.320]  Unless you got a broken leg or something or they're doing eye surgery with cocaine.
[2:26:24.320 --> 2:26:26.960]  They use that to do something with the nerves I've read and
[2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:30.400]  obviously opiates if you've broken your back. You know they shoot you up with them.
[2:26:30.400 --> 2:26:34.720]  But the point is marijuana is is amazing. Do people abuse it? Are there
[2:26:34.720 --> 2:26:38.160]  potheds that are jellyfish out there? Absolutely.
[2:26:38.160 --> 2:26:42.400]  But the issue is that that it has so many medical uses
[2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:45.360]  and 14 states have said the feds have no jurisdiction.
[2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:49.120]  Just like Montana said you have no jurisdiction over us manufacturing our
[2:26:49.120 --> 2:26:51.840]  own guns. And now other states like Tennessee and
[2:26:51.840 --> 2:26:55.360]  others are moving to do that. This is how we get state freedom back over
[2:26:55.360 --> 2:27:00.160]  our commerce. And in California the feds are
[2:27:00.160 --> 2:27:04.000]  still trying to shut it down. Obama is exposed in this film
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:07.040]  as the fraud he is. We expose the government drug dealing.
[2:27:07.040 --> 2:27:10.800]  I'm the main presenter in it. Kevin Booth made it. Of course his
[2:27:10.800 --> 2:27:14.320]  last big film aired on Showtime won all these big awards.
[2:27:14.320 --> 2:27:17.280]  I was working with Kevin on this five years ago. He shelved it.
[2:27:17.280 --> 2:27:23.120]  He came back in the last year and the trailer is up on infowars.com.
[2:27:23.120 --> 2:27:27.360]  It's on the shopping cart at the Yahoo shopping cart.
[2:27:27.360 --> 2:27:34.720]  How weed won the West. It is pre-orders. But it ships coming up the 15th.
[2:27:34.720 --> 2:27:38.640]  Two hour documentary film. A lot of extras.
[2:27:38.640 --> 2:27:44.480]  And this is a documentary that will really wake up the young people.
[2:27:44.480 --> 2:27:47.760]  The reason it's important is the podhead movement
[2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:51.600]  is pretty much what runs the cannabis movement when it's a lot bigger than
[2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:54.240]  that. This explains to them and it shows drug
[2:27:54.240 --> 2:27:57.440]  dealers saying I don't want drugs legalized. Well of course the drug
[2:27:57.440 --> 2:28:00.640]  dealers don't. And of course the banks don't. And of course the alcohol and
[2:28:00.640 --> 2:28:03.280]  cigarette producers are some of the biggest contributors to keep it
[2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:09.680]  illegal. They don't want folks if you decriminalize,
[2:28:09.680 --> 2:28:14.160]  not legalize, decriminalize drugs.
[2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:17.040]  In some of Europe's done this. Drug use goes way down.
[2:28:17.040 --> 2:28:20.240]  It gets cleaner. It doesn't get cut with poison.
[2:28:20.240 --> 2:28:23.280]  The person isn't breaking into your house for your jewelry and stereo and
[2:28:23.280 --> 2:28:28.240]  computer, your iPod. Because they want to get some more drugs.
[2:28:28.240 --> 2:28:32.800]  It becomes dirt cheap. It becomes an illness. It becomes a disease.
[2:28:32.800 --> 2:28:36.960]  And it gets cut by over 50% in the countries that have done this. So
[2:28:36.960 --> 2:28:39.760]  you want to stop the CIA and their narcotics trafficking. You want to stop
[2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:43.440]  the New World Order. CIA is always crashing airplanes full of cocaine.
[2:28:43.440 --> 2:28:49.040]  That's covered in the film. And you can get it at infowars.com. You can get
[2:28:49.040 --> 2:28:52.080]  some of my films like Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic,
[2:28:52.080 --> 2:28:55.760]  Half Price. You can get American Drug War, Half Price when you
[2:28:55.760 --> 2:28:59.360]  order it. And we're going to be the first people to have it.
[2:28:59.360 --> 2:29:02.560]  We're manufacturing it right now. I mean I'm actually involved paying for the
[2:29:02.560 --> 2:29:06.320]  manufacturing of it. I'm that much in this film. I asked Kevin not to be in
[2:29:06.320 --> 2:29:09.360]  the credits because he really did the work on the film. I just did the
[2:29:09.360 --> 2:29:13.360]  consulting and other things. But the point is we're manufacturing.
[2:29:13.360 --> 2:29:16.640]  And so it's being made right now. We'll get it in
[2:29:16.640 --> 2:29:20.240]  week and a half. Pre-order now. We're going to ship it out
[2:29:20.240 --> 2:29:27.440]  the 15th infowars.com to get how weed won the west. States rights for guns
[2:29:27.440 --> 2:29:31.440]  for farmers. Everything. We're taking our rights back.
[2:29:31.440 --> 2:29:37.840]  Now the weed won the west infowars.com or call toll 3888-253-3139

[2:29:51.520 --> 2:29:55.360]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[2:29:55.360 --> 2:30:00.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:30:00.480 --> 2:30:03.840]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Acola Blue atmospheric
[2:30:03.840 --> 2:30:06.960]  water generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity
[2:30:06.960 --> 2:30:09.200]  in the air. No, this isn't science fiction. It's very
[2:30:09.200 --> 2:30:11.440]  real. I know because I use one every day in my
[2:30:11.440 --> 2:30:14.960]  own home and it's available right now to you because you know exactly where your
[2:30:14.960 --> 2:30:18.000]  water comes from with Acola Blue. You'll know what's in your cup.

[2:30:21.600 --> 2:30:25.440]  grid today by ordering your own Acola Blue atmospheric water generator for
[2:30:25.440 --> 2:30:28.880]  your home or business. Their best seller, the Acola Blue 28,

[2:30:46.080 --> 2:30:50.720]  independence today by calling Acola Blue at 1-800-691-6043.

[2:30:55.280 --> 2:31:02.400]  at www.ecoloblue.com today. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[2:31:02.400 --> 2:31:04.880]  you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:31:04.880 --> 2:31:08.800]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[2:31:08.800 --> 2:31:11.680]  bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to
[2:31:11.680 --> 2:31:15.760]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true.
[2:31:15.760 --> 2:31:20.000]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:22.800]  coming. Number three, in some areas of the country
[2:31:22.800 --> 2:31:27.280]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[2:31:27.280 --> 2:31:31.120]  is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a
[2:31:31.120 --> 2:31:34.400]  threat to local grids. Every year thousands of families lose their
[2:31:34.400 --> 2:31:38.240]  power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[2:31:38.240 --> 2:31:42.000]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in
[2:31:42.000 --> 2:31:45.280]  the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old
[2:31:45.280 --> 2:31:50.320]  sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[2:31:50.320 --> 2:31:54.320]  That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,
[2:31:54.320 --> 2:32:00.720]  so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[2:32:00.720 --> 2:32:04.560]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into
[2:32:04.560 --> 2:32:09.120]  a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[2:32:09.120 --> 2:32:13.280]  My answer would be all I can get. In the battle for freedom and the lives of
[2:32:13.280 --> 2:32:17.520]  your loved ones, food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When
[2:32:17.520 --> 2:32:20.880]  do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you
[2:32:20.880 --> 2:32:23.600]  need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:32:23.600 --> 2:32:27.680]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine
[2:32:27.680 --> 2:32:31.760]  and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[2:32:31.760 --> 2:32:35.360]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:32:35.360 --> 2:32:39.120]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:32:39.120 --> 2:32:43.280]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get.
[2:32:43.280 --> 2:32:47.440]  I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[2:32:47.440 --> 2:32:54.880]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:32:54.880 --> 2:33:01.040]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[2:33:11.040 --> 2:33:16.240]  Kurt Haskell coming up, singing in Associated Press, you name it.
[2:33:16.240 --> 2:33:19.600]  Authorities were watching Different Nigerian on Christmas Day Flight.
[2:33:19.600 --> 2:33:22.480]  First, they denied they were watching anybody. First, they denied they arrested
[2:33:22.480 --> 2:33:25.280]  anybody. What a whitewash headline though. It should
[2:33:25.280 --> 2:33:29.680]  be FBI caught in line number 7. Totally vindicating Kurt Haskell,
[2:33:29.680 --> 2:33:33.840]  the underwear bombing situation in Debra Medina in the last 30 minutes,
[2:33:33.840 --> 2:33:38.880]  joining us, surging in the polls. But I wanted to get Matt Ryan in here.
[2:33:38.880 --> 2:33:42.160]  We've got a bunch of new things with PrisonPlanet.tv,
[2:33:42.160 --> 2:33:45.200]  a bunch of new things with the websites we're adding that we're not going to talk
[2:33:45.200 --> 2:33:48.480]  about till it's done in the next, what, two weeks.
[2:33:48.480 --> 2:33:53.840]  But I have hired some more people up here just for social networking,
[2:33:53.840 --> 2:33:58.560]  just for videos, just for other things we're going to be offering for free.
[2:33:58.560 --> 2:34:01.520]  And we're actually going to be really, instead of just having a couple of
[2:34:01.520 --> 2:34:04.480]  Twitter accounts with 10,000 members or whatever,
[2:34:04.480 --> 2:34:08.400]  or fan Facebooks with 30,000, 20,000, 10,000 members,
[2:34:08.400 --> 2:34:12.240]  which are great, we are going to take an active role on Facebook,
[2:34:12.240 --> 2:34:17.200]  an active role on Twitter, an active role in a bunch of other ways.
[2:34:17.200 --> 2:34:20.160]  That's nothing compared to what we're about to launch.
[2:34:20.160 --> 2:34:24.080]  And then, well, we're finally getting a lot of stuff done around here.
[2:34:24.080 --> 2:34:27.680]  And just people have been overwhelmed. We've got a great crew, but,
[2:34:27.680 --> 2:34:31.040]  and Matt, you've been instrumental in really helping us get a lot of other
[2:34:31.040 --> 2:34:34.000]  things going. But tell folks about the two original
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:36.800]  Twitter accounts that we never really interact on.
[2:34:36.800 --> 2:34:40.160]  We're going to start interacting on all three accounts. We're going to start taking
[2:34:40.160 --> 2:34:44.160]  questions, by the way, later. I must implement, again,
[2:34:44.160 --> 2:34:47.520]  another thousand plus phone calls on the comment line.
[2:34:47.520 --> 2:34:50.480]  Let's just go through those. I want to play a bunch of those tomorrow. I want to
[2:34:50.480 --> 2:34:53.280]  make sure we reimplement that. We've got to make ourselves do that because
[2:34:53.280 --> 2:34:57.360]  people really enjoyed that content and those questions.
[2:34:57.360 --> 2:34:59.920]  But tell folks about the three new Twitter accounts.
[2:34:59.920 --> 2:35:03.520]  Sure. First are the two that have been existing for a little while. They've been
[2:35:03.520 --> 2:35:08.240]  through infowars.com and prismplanet.com. The first one is
[2:35:08.240 --> 2:35:12.800]  twitter.com slash infowars stories. All one word.
[2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:16.480]  And that has been basically a feed of all the stories as they are posted to
[2:35:16.480 --> 2:35:19.920]  infowars in real time. So you can get up to date on the latest
[2:35:19.920 --> 2:35:23.600]  information on that site. Also, prismplanet. That's twitter.com
[2:35:23.600 --> 2:35:26.480]  slash prismplanet. And that's been put into place and that's
[2:35:26.480 --> 2:35:30.080]  on Twitter right now for prismplanet articles that have been going up.
[2:35:30.080 --> 2:35:34.160]  But the latest one that I'm very excited about is twitter.com
[2:35:34.160 --> 2:35:38.400]  slash realalexjones. And that is your personal
[2:35:38.400 --> 2:35:42.320]  Twitter account where you will be interacting directly with the fans of
[2:35:42.320 --> 2:35:45.760]  the show. And keeping people up to date on what's
[2:35:45.760 --> 2:35:48.240]  going on behind the scenes. And what'll be great is if I'm going on
[2:35:48.240 --> 2:35:51.600]  coast to coast a.m. or I'm going on Talksport in England
[2:35:51.600 --> 2:35:57.280]  or I'm going on a little local show. I can tell people the web address to
[2:35:57.280 --> 2:36:01.360]  listen online and I'll just fire it out. It's so easy for me always texting my
[2:36:01.360 --> 2:36:05.600]  friends and my wife and people. I can just text them and send it out.
[2:36:05.600 --> 2:36:08.400]  And I know this has been around for a while. I'm just so busy. But this is
[2:36:08.400 --> 2:36:12.240]  something I actually will be doing. Absolutely. And the best thing about
[2:36:12.240 --> 2:36:17.120]  it is you have a real-time interaction with Alex as he's doing the show.
[2:36:17.120 --> 2:36:21.280]  So they can give me information. Exactly. He's got the Twitter feed
[2:36:21.280 --> 2:36:25.280]  for mentions and all of his friends. Anybody that he follows back
[2:36:25.280 --> 2:36:29.440]  are up here on his screen. He can see it 24-7.
[2:36:29.440 --> 2:36:34.000]  In fact, we should have people. In fact, I just sent the Twitter out
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:39.360]  about Debra Medina come on. And then we can actually maybe take a few questions
[2:36:39.360 --> 2:36:42.480]  off of here for Debra Medina. Exactly. I'll be busy on the show but you can
[2:36:42.480 --> 2:36:46.160]  print them off for me. Absolutely. We'll do. And this is a real
[2:36:46.160 --> 2:36:49.200]  way where you can communicate directly with your audience and the audience
[2:36:49.200 --> 2:36:51.840]  can communicate with Alex. Let him know what's going on. If you see an article
[2:36:51.840 --> 2:36:55.360]  that is important and you want us to cover, send it to us on Twitter. Let us
[2:36:55.360 --> 2:36:59.600]  know. A direct message. Do an at sign and send it out to the world and
[2:36:59.600 --> 2:37:03.600]  we'll make sure it's mentioned. Absolutely. Now again,
[2:37:03.600 --> 2:37:10.160]  so they go where? Twitter at RealAlexJones and then they can send a
[2:37:10.160 --> 2:37:13.040]  question for Debra Medina. Absolutely. They can send a question there.
[2:37:13.040 --> 2:37:17.040]  Just do at RealAlexJones and your question for Debra Medina.
[2:37:17.040 --> 2:37:20.160]  Make sure they get printed out. Alex can also see them on his screen here.
[2:37:20.160 --> 2:37:23.920]  And we'll make sure that questions are asked directly from you,
[2:37:23.920 --> 2:37:27.120]  the Twitter users. And this is a brand new account.
[2:37:27.120 --> 2:37:31.360]  Absolutely. Brand new. It's one day old. Right now it has three followers. No one
[2:37:31.360 --> 2:37:35.360]  has heard about it. This is the first time anyone has mentioned this
[2:37:35.360 --> 2:37:38.000]  this account publicly. Give the full address out.
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:44.160]  It is twitter.com slash realAlexJones. Because there's a lot of other Alex
[2:37:44.160 --> 2:37:47.920]  Joneses on there. Absolutely. And this one will be the real deal.
[2:37:47.920 --> 2:37:51.440]  He'll have direct access to this account. This is his account and he'll be
[2:37:51.440 --> 2:37:55.280]  posting off of it himself. And I've already posted quite a bit of stuff
[2:37:55.280 --> 2:37:58.240]  up there. Absolutely. I know that during the break,
[2:37:58.240 --> 2:38:00.320]  right after we got off the phone with Darren
[2:38:00.320 --> 2:38:03.840]  Bedeker and you found out that the show's back on,
[2:38:03.840 --> 2:38:07.360]  just sent a post off about that one. Well, what's great about this is,
[2:38:07.360 --> 2:38:10.640]  and again, all this stuff comes out and sometimes we're ahead of the
[2:38:10.640 --> 2:38:12.720]  curve on technology. A lot of times we're behind the curve.
[2:38:12.720 --> 2:38:16.400]  I'm so busy trudging through things.
[2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:19.440]  I kind of just saw this as a way to send out our stories to people. No.
[2:38:19.440 --> 2:38:27.040]  This is if I'm at a water park with my kids and I see a jet airplane crash,
[2:38:27.040 --> 2:38:31.760]  or I see cops beat somebody up, or I see something
[2:38:31.760 --> 2:38:34.720]  interesting, or if I'm in a bad spot even, once this gets
[2:38:34.720 --> 2:38:38.880]  hundreds of thousands of members, I can boom Twitter and I'm here.
[2:38:38.880 --> 2:38:42.720]  Exactly. In real time. So we can have a real time
[2:38:42.720 --> 2:38:45.280]  communication directly with you, the audience. And it's going to be a big
[2:38:45.280 --> 2:38:47.760]  thing. All right. And then we're going to commit
[2:38:47.760 --> 2:38:49.920]  to this and actually use it and actually do it.
[2:38:49.920 --> 2:38:53.200]  Absolutely. Well, Matt, Ryan, you're kicking butt. We appreciate you.
[2:38:53.200 --> 2:38:57.360]  Thank you. Take care, buddy. All right. I've got a bunch of news
[2:38:57.360 --> 2:39:02.640]  that I want to go over here today that we really haven't gotten to yet. And then
[2:39:02.640 --> 2:39:07.120]  as I said, we got Kurt Haskell and Deborah Medina coming up
[2:39:07.120 --> 2:39:12.560]  in the next hour, but you can send those questions. You can send questions to
[2:39:12.560 --> 2:39:18.000]  Kurt Haskell. In fact, I'll ask two questions you send for
[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:24.480]  Kurt Haskell. And boy, there's a bunch of them coming up there.
[2:39:24.480 --> 2:39:31.600]  It says, you man, you are my hero. The real Alex Jones finally
[2:39:31.600 --> 2:39:36.880]  talked to the man directly. Is this Alex Jones, the real deal? Scroll down a
[2:39:36.880 --> 2:39:40.480]  little bit. I scroll down. It's here on my screen.
[2:39:40.480 --> 2:39:45.040]  I'm so used to them controlling the screens.
[2:39:46.320 --> 2:39:50.400]  Well, that's great. They're just pouring in. Again, I
[2:39:50.400 --> 2:39:55.440]  miss a lot of things. I mean, I wasn't really understanding
[2:39:55.440 --> 2:39:59.440]  because I'm not a webmaster. I'm not a person who's really good with
[2:39:59.440 --> 2:40:02.320]  computers, but I know how to text. I know how to send email. I know how to
[2:40:02.320 --> 2:40:05.600]  do things. And this is just so easy. Now I'll just go to my Twitter account on my
[2:40:05.600 --> 2:40:11.360]  iPhone. And man, I just wish this thing had like
[2:40:11.360 --> 2:40:15.600]  automatic uploads of video. Exactly. We drive down the road and
[2:40:15.600 --> 2:40:18.480]  we're, you know, in a parking lot, shoot a video and then upload it right away
[2:40:18.480 --> 2:40:21.520]  because I always want to rant and rave. And then, you know, there's this
[2:40:21.520 --> 2:40:24.880]  process of taking the video back to the office and uploading it.
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:29.840]  But our intention is to put out more media, more issues, more facts, more
[2:40:29.840 --> 2:40:33.120]  points. And that's what we're doing here.
[2:40:33.120 --> 2:40:36.720]  Boy, I didn't have three members anymore. That thing is just exploding.
[2:40:36.720 --> 2:40:42.080]  How many think we'll have by tomorrow? 10,000?
[2:40:42.160 --> 2:40:47.600]  You think 5,000? Yeah. Well, we'll see what happens with that.
[2:40:47.600 --> 2:40:51.120]  You know, we tried the InfoWars network just with a little social network
[2:40:51.120 --> 2:40:54.480]  system, but people ran their own scripts and stuff. Not that they're bad. It just
[2:40:54.480 --> 2:40:58.320]  kept crashing our servers. I've since bought a lot bigger servers and
[2:40:58.320 --> 2:41:02.160]  CDNs and systems. We are designing and really spending a lot of money and time
[2:41:02.160 --> 2:41:07.120]  on a real social networking system. And where you can have meetup type
[2:41:07.120 --> 2:41:09.920]  things. People want to meet for relationships.
[2:41:09.920 --> 2:41:14.240]  Patriots want to get together. People want to,
[2:41:14.240 --> 2:41:17.040]  I mean, obviously it's going to be infiltrated and stuff. That's,
[2:41:17.040 --> 2:41:19.520]  so I've got to hire a couple people just to try to watch over that, but we're
[2:41:19.520 --> 2:41:25.280]  going to launch big social networking website very, very soon.
[2:41:25.280 --> 2:41:28.240]  I mean, I've been wanting to do this for three, four years, but I've just now
[2:41:28.240 --> 2:41:31.120]  got into big enough building, big enough space. I've talked to the
[2:41:31.120 --> 2:41:33.680]  accountants. I've looked at the money we've got and I'm just going to dump what we
[2:41:33.680 --> 2:41:39.040]  got into this and into the TV studio we're building over there
[2:41:39.040 --> 2:41:42.960]  that's crawling along, but it seems to be going a little bit quicker now.
[2:41:42.960 --> 2:41:47.840]  Okay. That's just some of what's going on here at InfoWars.
[2:41:47.840 --> 2:41:51.680]  Getting more than one a second right now.
[2:41:53.840 --> 2:41:57.360]  If we keep getting one a second to our new Twitter account, I wonder what it'll
[2:41:57.360 --> 2:42:04.240]  end up being. That's funny. Oh man.
[2:42:04.240 --> 2:42:08.640]  We haven't even begun to fight, ladies and gentlemen. We haven't even begun
[2:42:08.640 --> 2:42:13.600]  to resist the new world order. Okay.
[2:42:13.600 --> 2:42:20.560]  Let's get into something sad right now. The facts are the facts
[2:42:20.560 --> 2:42:24.160]  and so we cover them.
[2:42:24.160 --> 2:42:29.680]  And I've told the story many times of when I was 15 going to driver's
[2:42:29.680 --> 2:42:34.000]  education and my dad was a dentist, also did oral surgery in some hospitals,
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:38.000]  and he wasn't a conspiracy theory type guy. He didn't talk much trash about the
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  government. He just talked about the things, the way things were.
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:46.240]  And he said, son, don't sign the organ donor card.
[2:42:46.240 --> 2:42:49.600]  And he said, the word is from doctors and surgeons, I know that a lot of
[2:42:49.600 --> 2:42:57.440]  hospitals, if you come in hurt, but easy to revive,
[2:42:57.440 --> 2:43:00.320]  you know, not that hurt, they will let you die to get your organs because they
[2:43:00.320 --> 2:43:02.960]  could get hundreds of thousands of dollars then. Now it's about a half
[2:43:02.960 --> 2:43:06.480]  million. And the hospital and the doctors
[2:43:06.480 --> 2:43:09.600]  ended up getting part of that money.
[2:43:09.600 --> 2:43:21.280]  And I mean, I didn't believe it when he told me I couldn't believe it
[2:43:21.280 --> 2:43:27.360]  because I was young and naive. But then I remember probably five years later in
[2:43:27.360 --> 2:43:31.760]  college, now living in Austin, going over visit of my grandparents. I went most
[2:43:31.760 --> 2:43:36.800]  Sundays to eat dinner with my grandfather and grandmother.
[2:43:36.800 --> 2:43:40.160]  And I remember watching 60 Minutes with my grandfather because he watched it every
[2:43:40.160 --> 2:43:43.760]  week. And they had a whole show about Chicago and
[2:43:43.760 --> 2:43:47.440]  other cities, hospitals, killing people for their organs.
[2:43:47.440 --> 2:43:51.520]  And it went on and on and on and on. And the media
[2:43:51.520 --> 2:43:54.880]  doesn't really ever cover that. I've only seen a few reports confirmed of that.
[2:43:54.880 --> 2:43:58.080]  But they'll always cover, if you don't sign the organ donor card, they don't
[2:43:58.080 --> 2:44:01.600]  care. They still take your corneas or your eyes.
[2:44:01.600 --> 2:44:05.360]  And Cass Sunstein says, even if you don't want it, they're going to take your
[2:44:05.360 --> 2:44:09.120]  organs. And we know China takes people's
[2:44:09.120 --> 2:44:14.080]  political dissidents organs. We know they sell them on the world market.
[2:44:14.080 --> 2:44:17.200]  We know people have been killed by gangster groups to have their organs
[2:44:17.200 --> 2:44:20.800]  taken. But Israel really was caught with
[2:44:20.800 --> 2:44:24.640]  its pants down. Israel, if you'll remember about
[2:44:24.640 --> 2:44:29.520]  six months ago, it came out in Dutch and German prestigious
[2:44:29.520 --> 2:44:34.000]  newspapers. And one came out in Sweden as well
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:37.120]  saying, we've confirmed with doctors in Israel
[2:44:37.120 --> 2:44:42.480]  that they will go out and kill a Palestinian
[2:44:42.480 --> 2:44:45.360]  and they'll drag them off and the soldiers get the money, part of the
[2:44:45.360 --> 2:44:50.960]  money, and they gut them right there in a field hospital and fly the organs out.
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:58.560]  Just like China. And then different Haiti activists said,
[2:44:58.560 --> 2:45:02.400]  watch out about a week and a half ago, watch out
[2:45:02.400 --> 2:45:07.280]  Israel's there. And the word is they're taking people's organs.
[2:45:08.400 --> 2:45:12.480]  And my issue here is Israel is not
[2:45:12.480 --> 2:45:16.480]  for Sadah non grata. They are not off limits to criticize and go after.
[2:45:16.480 --> 2:45:19.200]  But also get criticized because I don't say the center of all evil on the
[2:45:19.200 --> 2:45:21.680]  planet is in Israel or the center of evil on the
[2:45:21.680 --> 2:45:25.280]  planets in our own hearts and minds. Every group of people has evil
[2:45:25.280 --> 2:45:28.480]  psychopaths and they all team up and work together. But Israel
[2:45:28.480 --> 2:45:32.720]  really does arrogantly attack anybody that criticizes them and uses the
[2:45:32.720 --> 2:45:36.480]  anti-semitic remark. Then it came out. In fact, since I
[2:45:36.480 --> 2:45:38.640]  mentioned this, when you print me the AP and Reuters,
[2:45:38.640 --> 2:45:43.360]  Israel admits they did take organs and then they finally got caught and a
[2:45:43.360 --> 2:45:48.240]  bunch of their doctors came out and said, no, they are taking people's organs.
[2:45:48.240 --> 2:45:52.000]  They are. And folks, if you can get a half million dollars for the liver, the two
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:56.960]  kidneys, the lungs and other things they take the eyes,
[2:45:56.960 --> 2:46:01.120]  you better believe that governments are in there doing it.
[2:46:01.120 --> 2:46:07.840]  And you better believe that that could be going on. And Paul
[2:46:07.840 --> 2:46:12.480]  Watson wrote an article last week says, activists say this, we don't know.
[2:46:12.480 --> 2:46:15.760]  But because Israel has been caught doing, this is like if the Chinese were there
[2:46:15.760 --> 2:46:19.520]  and people were accusing them, we go, well, the Chinese do this. I mean, you know,
[2:46:19.520 --> 2:46:23.280]  and it's not going to stop if we don't expose them. Oh, don't criticize the
[2:46:23.280 --> 2:46:26.080]  Chinese. I mean, I remember back when Bill Clinton was caught selling
[2:46:26.080 --> 2:46:30.000]  missile secrets, missile cone systems,
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:34.960]  MIRV technology, which is key. You don't just send up one ICBM with one
[2:46:34.960 --> 2:46:39.120]  warhead. When it comes back into orbit or back
[2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:42.960]  into the atmosphere, it pops off and shoots off five or six dummies and
[2:46:42.960 --> 2:46:47.280]  five or six depending on the MIRV system. That particular thing had 12 MIRVs,
[2:46:47.280 --> 2:46:50.400]  real warheads. It's got missiles inside the missile
[2:46:50.400 --> 2:46:53.760]  that shoot off in different directions so that even if you've got particle
[2:46:53.760 --> 2:46:58.240]  beams or anti-missile missiles or
[2:46:58.240 --> 2:47:02.720]  railgun Sabo systems that still you can't stop all the nukes.
[2:47:02.720 --> 2:47:06.160]  Clinton gave that. I remember CNN saying it's racist
[2:47:06.160 --> 2:47:12.720]  to criticize China and their, what they're doing with the missile secrets.
[2:47:12.720 --> 2:47:17.600]  It's wrong to be doing this. No, anytime somebody does that, I'm not going to go
[2:47:17.600 --> 2:47:20.960]  along with it. Doctor admits Israel pathologist harvest
[2:47:20.960 --> 2:47:23.920]  organs without consent. That's the London Guardian.
[2:47:23.920 --> 2:47:28.000]  There's an AP even stronger. Israel has admitted pathologist harvest organs
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:31.200]  from dead Palestinians and others without the consent of their families. The
[2:47:31.200 --> 2:47:35.600]  practice it said ended in the 1990s. It has emerged at this weekend. Well,
[2:47:35.600 --> 2:47:39.440]  we first exposed that the U.S. and Israel
[2:47:39.440 --> 2:47:43.280]  were doing this because of the doctors reports in Iraq.
[2:47:43.280 --> 2:47:47.840]  The photos and photos even released by the Pentagon
[2:47:47.840 --> 2:47:51.520]  clearly showed they'd done quick surgeries where they slice them open here,
[2:47:51.520 --> 2:47:57.520]  here and here, open it up for fast entry, carve out the the
[2:47:57.520 --> 2:48:01.120]  breastbone, pop it open and just get the goodies fast
[2:48:01.120 --> 2:48:05.680]  and assanguate the blood and sell that. I mean they just suck humans dry like
[2:48:05.680 --> 2:48:10.400]  we're a cantaloupe and it's clear that contractors, the Pentagon and Israel,
[2:48:10.400 --> 2:48:15.760]  and I covered this in martial law in the extras. We made a mini film,
[2:48:15.760 --> 2:48:22.720]  a little 10-minute film about it. We covered this in 2005. Now, why do I
[2:48:22.720 --> 2:48:25.600]  go over all this? When we come back after the break,
[2:48:25.600 --> 2:48:31.120]  traffickers targeting Haitian children, human organs, the prime minister
[2:48:31.120 --> 2:48:37.920]  says, the prime minister, trafficking of children and
[2:48:37.920 --> 2:48:41.760]  human organs is occurring, the CNN and the aftermath of the
[2:48:41.760 --> 2:48:45.280]  earthquake, the devastated parts of Haiti killed more than 150,000 people and
[2:48:45.280 --> 2:48:48.160]  have many children, orphans, Haitian prime minister,
[2:48:48.160 --> 2:48:56.480]  Jean Max Bell Arieve said last night, there is organ trafficking for children
[2:48:56.480 --> 2:49:01.840]  and other persons also because they need all types of organs.
[2:49:01.840 --> 2:49:05.600]  He said an exclusive interview with CNN's Christina Amanpour. Well, why didn't she
[2:49:05.600 --> 2:49:08.560]  ask who's doing it? He did not give specifics, but asked
[2:49:08.560 --> 2:49:13.680]  Amanpour if there was trafficking of children, but when asked by Amanpour
[2:49:13.680 --> 2:49:18.320]  that was trafficking of children, Bell Arieve said, the reports I receive
[2:49:18.320 --> 2:49:24.320]  say yes. So, the first reports was it was Israel
[2:49:24.320 --> 2:49:30.080]  doing it. Now, I'm here exposing this, and I've been
[2:49:30.080 --> 2:49:33.920]  exposing it since 2005. The COINTELPRO will then say if other
[2:49:33.920 --> 2:49:38.000]  countries are doing it, oh, how dare you say the Chinese are doing it? No, only
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:41.520]  Jews can do something evil. See, that's how the COINTELPRO
[2:49:41.520 --> 2:49:44.720]  operatives work, and that's how it's not fair. No, we're here
[2:49:44.720 --> 2:49:48.320]  exposing. We're here covering it. We're here talking about it.
[2:49:48.320 --> 2:49:51.120]  My whole point is government is evil across the board.
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:54.400]  We've got to cut its size. We've got to have more transparency.
[2:49:54.400 --> 2:49:58.320]  We've got to get up off of our fat butts and get involved
[2:49:58.320 --> 2:50:03.120]  and start exposing these people. We have to educate the population.
[2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:06.480]  You want the solution? Look in the mirror, letters to the editor, calling the talk
[2:50:06.480 --> 2:50:08.640]  radio. Go visit your congressman, visit your

[2:50:26.960 --> 2:50:32.240]  how. So, guys, there's so many of those, though.
[2:50:32.240 --> 2:50:35.200]  Can you, hundreds of comments coming in. Can you print me the specific questions
[2:50:35.200 --> 2:50:38.480]  for Deborah Medina and Kurt Haskell then? Okay, we're going to come back with
[2:50:38.480 --> 2:50:43.680]  this horrible organ situation. You just have to get down to how
[2:50:43.680 --> 2:50:47.760]  evil government is and the things they'll do, the
[2:50:47.760 --> 2:50:50.400]  types of horrible, I mean, the U.N. everywhere they go
[2:50:50.400 --> 2:50:54.640]  runs child kidnapping rings, organ harvesting, you name it.
[2:50:54.640 --> 2:51:01.520]  Our government does it. The hospitals do it. They're evil people everywhere.
[2:51:02.800 --> 2:51:08.240]  Our economy is in great distress. The financial dominoes can fall at any
[2:51:08.240 --> 2:51:11.760]  time. It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen
[2:51:11.760 --> 2:51:17.440]  and prepare just in case it does. You have auto and home insurance.
[2:51:17.440 --> 2:51:22.720]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance? Are you prepared to feed your family
[2:51:22.720 --> 2:51:26.480]  long term because it might take years to recover?
[2:51:26.480 --> 2:51:30.560]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family,

[2:52:09.600 --> 2:52:13.600]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[2:52:13.600 --> 2:52:16.880]  Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence
[2:52:16.880 --> 2:52:20.800]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[2:52:20.800 --> 2:52:26.080]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:52:26.080 --> 2:52:29.280]  For the republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[2:52:29.280 --> 2:52:33.680]  the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty,

[2:52:36.960 --> 2:52:40.240]  Bernanke, and their arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the
[2:52:40.240 --> 2:52:44.160]  Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does
[2:52:44.160 --> 2:52:48.080]  care and right now in Washington DC we have seen

[2:54:10.480 --> 2:54:16.880]  Okay, here is the prime minister of Haiti talking about organ theft
[2:54:16.880 --> 2:54:22.960]  going on in the country. Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[2:54:22.960 --> 2:54:27.680]  Let me talk about the children. The children, tens of thousands of them,
[2:54:27.680 --> 2:54:31.120]  maybe hundreds of thousands, have been separated from their families, many of
[2:54:31.120 --> 2:54:35.040]  them. Families dead, families lost, families moved out.
[2:54:35.040 --> 2:54:39.280]  What is being done to corral these children, to register them, to make sure
[2:54:39.280 --> 2:54:43.520]  no further harm comes to them? It's one of the biggest problems that we
[2:54:43.520 --> 2:54:46.880]  have and this morning during the coordination meeting in the international
[2:54:46.880 --> 2:54:51.600]  community addressed the question of the adoption because I have a lot of
[2:54:51.600 --> 2:54:54.720]  petition for that but they have to be very prudent
[2:54:54.720 --> 2:54:59.920]  because there is a lot of cautious because there is a lot of traffic in
[2:54:59.920 --> 2:55:02.560]  that area. You mean illegal child trafficking?
[2:55:02.560 --> 2:55:07.280]  Yeah, even if it seems to be legal but a lot of
[2:55:07.280 --> 2:55:10.640]  organizations they come and say there were children on the streets who are
[2:55:10.640 --> 2:55:15.040]  going to bring them to the States and we have already reports of a lot of
[2:55:15.040 --> 2:55:18.800]  trafficking, even of organ trafficking. Of organ trafficking?
[2:55:18.800 --> 2:55:21.680]  Now? Yeah, already. Of the victims of the earthquake?
[2:55:21.680 --> 2:55:25.680]  Yeah. So, do you know that for sure? Yeah, I know that for sure and it was
[2:55:25.680 --> 2:55:29.120]  discussed in Montreal during the conference. And do you know for sure that
[2:55:29.120 --> 2:55:32.720]  children are being trafficked now? There is children trafficking for
[2:55:32.720 --> 2:55:36.800]  children and adult persons also because they need all type of organs so.
[2:55:36.800 --> 2:55:39.840]  No, but I mean live children, are they being trafficked now?
[2:55:39.840 --> 2:55:45.200]  The report I receive, yes. Well there you have it from the Prime Minister of Haiti.
[2:55:45.200 --> 2:55:51.280]  Now, here's the issue. What do you think the CPS does? They're above the law.
[2:55:51.280 --> 2:55:54.400]  They swear out fake reports. They do whatever they want.
[2:55:54.400 --> 2:55:58.080]  They've been caught five to seven times more often
[2:55:58.080 --> 2:56:02.240]  in pedophilia, in abuse of children than any other group.
[2:56:02.240 --> 2:56:08.960]  The most dangerous place for your child to be
[2:56:08.960 --> 2:56:12.320]  is in government custody statistically. That's from the Justice Department
[2:56:12.320 --> 2:56:15.520]  themselves. And it's the same thing in Europe,
[2:56:15.520 --> 2:56:20.000]  same thing in Russia. Where do you think perverts go?
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:23.120]  Now, are there some good social workers? Absolutely.
[2:56:23.120 --> 2:56:28.240]  Are there some good truancy officers? Sure, but statistically
[2:56:28.240 --> 2:56:32.000]  this is the group that has to be watched, just like government
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:39.040]  and aid groups in there, shipping those kids out of the country.
[2:56:39.040 --> 2:56:41.680]  And I would imagine if she pressed, they're probably grabbing the kids and
[2:56:41.680 --> 2:56:45.920]  taking their organs. But she didn't elaborate on that and
[2:56:45.920 --> 2:56:53.520]  CNN should continue to cover this. But in my experience,
[2:56:53.520 --> 2:56:57.600]  CNN doesn't report on Chinese organ harvesting.
[2:56:57.600 --> 2:57:02.800]  They don't report on the Israelis organ harvesting.
[2:57:02.800 --> 2:57:06.400]  They don't report on any of this illegal activity.
[2:57:06.400 --> 2:57:10.320]  And it's so macabre, it's hard for the average person to believe, but to
[2:57:10.320 --> 2:57:16.160]  psychopaths and to greedy people, human beings are like a
[2:57:16.240 --> 2:57:22.880]  clutch of apples, or tomatoes, or squash, or bananas,
[2:57:22.880 --> 2:57:29.600]  or a side of beef. The New World Order
[2:57:29.600 --> 2:57:38.240]  doesn't even think of us as human. The New World Order
[2:57:38.240 --> 2:57:43.840]  could care less about us, and we need to realize that the government is full
[2:57:43.840 --> 2:57:47.200]  of people at the top that are ruthless, power grasping
[2:57:47.200 --> 2:57:52.080]  sociopaths and psychopaths, and under them there's a bunch of well-meaning
[2:57:52.080 --> 2:57:55.760]  we're the government, we're the boss, we know what's best on the right and the
[2:57:55.760 --> 2:57:58.400]  left. You had all those fake right-wingers call
[2:57:58.400 --> 2:58:02.160]  for banning free speech of the liberals under Bush.
[2:58:02.160 --> 2:58:06.160]  Now we see the Democrats and their supporters and people in the White House
[2:58:06.160 --> 2:58:10.400]  calling for restricting free speech. You see
[2:58:10.400 --> 2:58:13.600]  Obama continuing free speech zones, just like Bush did.
[2:58:13.600 --> 2:58:18.000]  The whole country's a free speech zone, the whole world's a free speech zone.
[2:58:18.000 --> 2:58:20.640]  This is what they're doing, and they're doing this
[2:58:20.640 --> 2:58:27.680]  by design in a premeditated fashion.
[2:58:27.680 --> 2:58:32.160]  But the establishment cannot defeat us
[2:58:32.160 --> 2:58:37.120]  if we just continue to resist them, continue to resist them, continue to
[2:58:37.120 --> 2:58:41.040]  resist them. Kurt Hassel, coming up.

[3:00:10.720 --> 3:00:16.080]  Debra Medina coming up in 30 minutes.
[3:00:16.080 --> 3:00:21.280]  Her campaign for governor being watched around the nation,
[3:00:21.280 --> 3:00:25.360]  just as Massachusetts was watched with Mr. Brown
[3:00:25.360 --> 3:00:30.560]  unseating that what they thought was invincible Kennedy seat.
[3:00:30.560 --> 3:00:34.480]  She's coming up in 30 minutes. But for the next 20 minutes, then that short
[3:00:34.480 --> 3:00:38.000]  segment in between, I'm going to cover news, we have Kurt Haskell
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:41.200]  turning it law with his wife. They're flying back from Amsterdam
[3:00:41.200 --> 3:00:46.320]  Christmas Day. They see a sharp-dressed man bring the underwear bomber
[3:00:46.320 --> 3:00:49.840]  through security, doesn't have a passport, he gets him on board the plane.
[3:00:49.840 --> 3:00:52.800]  Other witnesses say someone's videotaping him from seats behind the
[3:00:52.800 --> 3:00:56.240]  whole time, trained on him, then daring the bombing.
[3:00:56.240 --> 3:01:00.800]  FBI says that tape doesn't exist, sharp-dressed man doesn't exist,
[3:01:00.800 --> 3:01:04.240]  and they said that Kurt Haskell didn't see
[3:01:04.240 --> 3:01:08.080]  another man where the drug dog, the bomb dog,
[3:01:08.080 --> 3:01:13.200]  once they got to, once they got to Detroit,
[3:01:13.200 --> 3:01:17.760]  the bomb dog runs over, they've got him in the customs, runs over to this guy's bag,
[3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:21.040]  they bring him over, bring him behind closed doors. The FBI says, obviously, if
[3:01:21.040 --> 3:01:24.640]  you're safety, everybody get out of here. They get him out,
[3:01:24.640 --> 3:01:27.840]  and the FBI comes to Haskell's office. You didn't, you know, you didn't see that,
[3:01:27.840 --> 3:01:31.440]  that didn't happen. No, you know, that's not going on. We're not
[3:01:31.440 --> 3:01:34.000]  going to talk about it. They told the media it wasn't going
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:38.720]  on. They changed their story five, six, seven times. I lost track after six.
[3:01:38.720 --> 3:01:42.160]  Kurt's been following it closely. He survived all this,
[3:01:42.160 --> 3:01:45.840]  and then all these witnesses came out on TV and said, no,
[3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:49.680]  Kurt Haskell's right. We, we saw that happen. He's not lying.
[3:01:49.680 --> 3:01:54.080]  He's not lying about any of it. Well, now Sunday it came out, what, five days
[3:01:54.080 --> 3:01:57.840]  ago, six days ago, or I guess, yeah, five days ago,
[3:01:57.840 --> 3:02:01.280]  authorities were watching different Nigerian on Christmas Day flights seeing
[3:02:01.280 --> 3:02:04.560]  him. But, but, but what a way to take a huge issue and just kind of
[3:02:04.560 --> 3:02:08.320]  put it out there like it's milk toast. Okay, there was somebody else. Yeah, they
[3:02:08.320 --> 3:02:10.560]  did arrest him, but we're not going to talk about it.
[3:02:10.560 --> 3:02:16.240]  Kurt, there's a definite cover-up, and you've been vindicated and triplicate.
[3:02:16.240 --> 3:02:20.880]  Thanks, Alex. And thanks for having me back. You bet, brother.
[3:02:20.880 --> 3:02:25.200]  Um, not only that, but I don't know if you caught the ABC news article that came
[3:02:25.200 --> 3:02:28.400]  out over the weekend. Uh, there were a couple sentences
[3:02:28.400 --> 3:02:32.080]  knocked in the bottom of this article about female suicide bombers. I don't
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:37.200]  know if you caught this. No, no, tell us. I'll read it to you word for word.
[3:02:37.200 --> 3:02:41.600]  Federal agents also tell ABC news they're attempting to identify a man
[3:02:41.600 --> 3:02:45.600]  who, passenger said, helped Abdul Muthalab
[3:02:45.600 --> 3:02:49.760]  change planes for Detroit when he landed in Amsterdam
[3:02:49.760 --> 3:02:54.400]  from Lagos, Nigeria. Authorities had initially discounted the passenger
[3:02:54.400 --> 3:02:57.360]  account, but the agents say there's a growing
[3:02:57.360 --> 3:03:03.440]  belief the man may have played a role to make sure Abdul Muthalab did not get
[3:03:03.440 --> 3:03:06.400]  cold feet. Oh my god, you've been vindicated by them
[3:03:06.400 --> 3:03:09.760]  on that, but obviously they think the trail's cold now.
[3:03:09.760 --> 3:03:14.320]  They have all the surveillance footage. They knew you were telling the truth.
[3:03:14.320 --> 3:03:18.080]  They were involved in a cover-up, but Kurt, this is huge.
[3:03:18.080 --> 3:03:22.880]  Well, that, you know, that was my take on it, but unfortunately for ABC news they
[3:03:22.880 --> 3:03:26.800]  buried in the bottom of a seemingly unrelated article
[3:03:26.800 --> 3:03:30.240]  about female suicide bombers heading here from Yemen.
[3:03:30.240 --> 3:03:33.920]  What's the headline? What's the headline on that? What's the headline?
[3:03:33.920 --> 3:03:40.240]  The headline is alert, uh, colon, female suicide bombers may be heading here from
[3:03:40.240 --> 3:03:44.640]  Yemen. It's from Saturday ABC News.com. I've got it.
[3:03:44.640 --> 3:03:49.600]  I've got it. Here it is. Excuse me. I've got an unbelievable, Kurt.
[3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:54.000]  Yeah. That was my thought too. My thought was,
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:59.200]  okay, why is this not front page news everywhere? Number one,
[3:03:59.200 --> 3:04:03.920]  number two, why are you burying at the bottom of this article? Number three,
[3:04:03.920 --> 3:04:07.040]  why did you initially discount my story to begin with?
[3:04:07.040 --> 3:04:12.320]  It's not like I'm not credible here. And of course they had COINTEL probe posing
[3:04:12.320 --> 3:04:18.320]  as the patriot movement attacking you, uh, all the usual suspects. I mean, it never ends, Kurt.
[3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:22.080]  And when you add the fact that there was coordinated lies and stories being told
[3:04:22.080 --> 3:04:27.920]  about you, despite all the other witnesses, and you add how they were already getting in Yemen,
[3:04:27.920 --> 3:04:31.280]  that's now confirmed. Washington Post, they were planning to already launch a bigger attack,
[3:04:31.280 --> 3:04:37.680]  2,000 troops there, uh, relaunching the naked body scanners. Everything comes together,
[3:04:37.680 --> 3:04:43.280]  stage, stage, stage, but I know, well, we'll get your take on that and recap the bombshells you
[3:04:43.280 --> 3:04:49.440]  just dropped. I mean, I literally was coughing in amazement because I knew this confirmed
[3:04:49.440 --> 3:04:53.920]  everything you were saying. And then even more is confirmed about this guy helping him get on
[3:04:53.920 --> 3:04:59.280]  the plane in Amsterdam. They clearly knew that. And the biggest issue when I come back, the key,
[3:04:59.280 --> 3:05:04.320]  straight ahead. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar
[3:05:04.320 --> 3:05:08.880]  power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[3:05:08.880 --> 3:05:13.920]  electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric
[3:05:13.920 --> 3:05:18.800]  company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name
[3:05:18.800 --> 3:05:24.160]  of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is
[3:05:24.160 --> 3:05:29.360]  dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[3:05:29.360 --> 3:05:33.520]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year,
[3:05:33.520 --> 3:05:37.360]  thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five,
[3:05:37.360 --> 3:05:41.760]  a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks,
[3:05:41.760 --> 3:05:45.600]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from science. One of my
[3:05:45.600 --> 3:05:52.640]  old sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[3:07:01.760 --> 3:07:06.160]  Hi neighbor, no matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one
[3:07:06.160 --> 3:07:10.800]  of us who have prepared will have two regrets. Even those who haven't wasted a single penny
[3:07:10.800 --> 3:07:16.000]  on Christmas, birthdays and vacations in order to store all the food possible. Even those who have
[3:07:16.000 --> 3:07:21.040]  sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food. Even those who have traded their gold
[3:07:21.040 --> 3:07:26.960]  while it will still buy food. Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[3:07:26.960 --> 3:07:31.600]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[3:07:31.600 --> 3:07:38.000]  We will still have two regrets. We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food
[3:07:38.000 --> 3:07:43.920]  sooner. We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food. Putting off emergency food
[3:07:43.920 --> 3:07:50.560]  preparations will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make. Call 800 409
[3:07:50.560 --> 3:08:10.240]  5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com 800 409 5633. Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[3:08:10.800 --> 3:08:19.760]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from
[3:08:19.760 --> 3:08:32.800]  Austin, Texas. Alex Jones. Kurt Haskell is our guest and I wanted to get him on all week
[3:08:32.800 --> 3:08:37.520]  because CNN reported, okay, there was a second person we pulled off. We arrested.
[3:08:38.560 --> 3:08:43.040]  The bomb dog did go over. Other witnesses confirmed that when the government denied it.
[3:08:43.040 --> 3:08:48.720]  Now I have the ABC news article that just at the bottom says, oh, yeah, in fact, we'll read the
[3:08:48.720 --> 3:08:54.480]  quotes again. Just says, oh, yeah, we are looking at somebody that helped him get on a plane. Now
[3:08:54.480 --> 3:09:00.160]  here is the key issue that no one is pointing out except Kurt and myself and a few others,
[3:09:00.160 --> 3:09:06.880]  but no mainstream media. Who is a person without a passport who gets people through security and
[3:09:06.880 --> 3:09:13.360]  on planes? Who can do that? Amsterdam had naked body scanners before this happened. I mean,
[3:09:13.360 --> 3:09:20.560]  they have some of the highest security in Europe. How on earth was this able to take place? This
[3:09:20.560 --> 3:09:26.800]  should be headlines everywhere. How did this person, this supposed terrorist, is able to get
[3:09:26.800 --> 3:09:31.440]  through security? I mean, somebody who's shepherding terrorists on the planes. I mean, this should be
[3:09:31.440 --> 3:09:37.040]  a three alarm emergency with them questioning everyone at that airport day one, but for over
[3:09:37.040 --> 3:09:43.360]  a month, Kurt, they've been saying that you were wrong. Yeah, and you know, they've had the surveillance
[3:09:43.360 --> 3:09:49.360]  video all along and they knew I was right all along. That's the big question. Why, you know,
[3:09:49.360 --> 3:09:54.000]  why haven't they admitted I was right and come out and shown the video to man and asked us to
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:09:59.600]  identify him? By the way, notice what they're not still not admitting to the part of my story that
[3:10:00.640 --> 3:10:05.680]  someone helped him on the plane posing him as being from Sudan and getting him on without a
[3:10:05.680 --> 3:10:13.280]  passport. You're still not admitting that part of my story. Why not? Well, the fact that government
[3:10:13.280 --> 3:10:18.880]  would cover this up from day one is more evidence they're behind it. The fact that they were already
[3:10:18.880 --> 3:10:24.240]  in Yemen, getting ready to launch public attacks on Yemen. The fact that they were getting ready
[3:10:24.240 --> 3:10:29.840]  to promote the naked body scanners going in worldwide, including courthouses, within minutes
[3:10:29.840 --> 3:10:34.000]  of the attack, they were saying, don't worry, the scanners are coming. We just got them because of
[3:10:34.000 --> 3:10:39.840]  this. Turns out they ordered them a year before. I mean, you can see this is an entirely concerted
[3:10:39.840 --> 3:10:43.840]  effort and you told me privately off air. Well, I don't know if you want to talk about that,
[3:10:43.840 --> 3:10:47.040]  that what you thought the FBI was doing in your office and the way they behaved.
[3:10:49.200 --> 3:10:52.400]  No, I don't really want to talk into anything we talked about off the air.
[3:10:52.400 --> 3:10:57.200]  Okay. Okay. And you know, I don't, I don't really know who's behind it or why it's being covered
[3:10:57.200 --> 3:11:02.800]  off. I mean, people can make their own judgment calls on that. All I know is that, you know,
[3:11:02.800 --> 3:11:08.560]  the official story has been not truthful since the start. And now it's coming out bit by bit,
[3:11:08.560 --> 3:11:13.440]  vindicating myself and showing that in fact, I have been telling the truth all along.
[3:11:15.200 --> 3:11:20.000]  Well, you were on an airplane and almost got killed with your wife. You're just telling the truth.
[3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:24.000]  And much of your story has been confirmed by the other passengers.
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:29.520]  Right. You know, and you know, we're don't lose track of the point to that we're victims here
[3:11:29.520 --> 3:11:35.280]  from not only Abdul Muthalab, but now from our own government. I mean, we're, we're both attorneys.
[3:11:35.280 --> 3:11:40.400]  We have our own business. Our livelihood depends on our reputation in the community.
[3:11:40.400 --> 3:11:44.400]  And here we have our own federal government basically coming out calling us liars all over
[3:11:44.400 --> 3:11:50.720]  the press. We're not too happy about it. Well, you're a lawyer. I don't know if this is your
[3:11:50.720 --> 3:11:53.920]  specialty, but I mean, isn't this defamation? Don't you have a suit?
[3:11:53.920 --> 3:12:01.360]  It's not my area specialty. It's something I'm going to look into, whether I have a case or
[3:12:01.360 --> 3:12:09.920]  not. I don't know. I have retained an attorney to handle a civil suit, not a defamation suit,
[3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:14.960]  but I'm letting him handle that. And I don't really want to get into any more detail.
[3:12:14.960 --> 3:12:18.480]  Oh, so that's breaking the case has been filed yet.
[3:12:18.480 --> 3:12:19.840]  Is this breaking news right now?
[3:12:19.840 --> 3:12:26.480]  I've told a couple other reporters that I've hired an attorney and the case will be filed shortly,
[3:12:27.280 --> 3:12:32.320]  but that's really the extent of the details. I can give it this time because I'm letting
[3:12:33.520 --> 3:12:36.720]  my attorney handle the cause of action when it will be filed. So
[3:12:37.440 --> 3:12:41.680]  and you can't tell us, I mean, is it against the Aviation Administration FBI?
[3:12:42.320 --> 3:12:46.720]  I'm letting him, I'm letting him decide who he wants to take action against. I'm leaving
[3:12:46.720 --> 3:12:51.440]  everything up to him because I'm not a civil attorney, I'm a divorce attorney, a bankruptcy
[3:12:51.440 --> 3:12:55.040]  attorney. But those are his areas of specialty and not mine.
[3:12:55.920 --> 3:13:02.160]  I understand the law is so complex, specializing is the only way to go. Well, I mean, recapping
[3:13:02.160 --> 3:13:10.080]  this, Kurt, I mean, this is blowing me away that that we're talking. This came out January 22nd
[3:13:10.080 --> 3:13:18.240]  in both CNN and ABC, two separate bombshells. I only knew about the CNN because it's buried
[3:13:18.240 --> 3:13:23.280]  in here and the ABC, it's buried in the article. And that's pretty big news that somebody can get
[3:13:23.280 --> 3:13:27.520]  past security and that supposed terrorists run the airport now.
[3:13:29.920 --> 3:13:34.080]  I don't know that I would say that, but it's certainly suspicious why they're covering it up.
[3:13:34.080 --> 3:13:38.400]  And you know, one other thing, Alex, I read another article and I can't remember where
[3:13:38.400 --> 3:13:43.520]  this was, but it was in the past few days, saying when Mutalab was still in first class,
[3:13:43.520 --> 3:13:47.360]  being arrested by the police, he kept telling them that there was another bomb on board.
[3:13:49.120 --> 3:13:53.120]  Again, this backs up my story that another man was arrested after he landed with a bomb
[3:13:53.120 --> 3:13:58.400]  and it's carrying it back. That doesn't appear in the news anywhere that I know of,
[3:13:59.280 --> 3:14:01.600]  you know, up until I read the story a couple days ago.
[3:14:01.600 --> 3:14:04.160]  And Mutalab is pleading not guilty.
[3:14:04.160 --> 3:14:11.120]  I don't know anything about that. I don't know how he could be found not guilty.
[3:14:12.720 --> 3:14:15.040]  You saw that headline that he pled not guilty, didn't you?
[3:14:15.600 --> 3:14:20.000]  Yeah, but that's the typical stance you take when you want to make a plea deal.
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:21.520]  So I'm really not surprised at that.
[3:14:22.160 --> 3:14:29.040]  Well, my whole issue is studying black ops. This is classic. In case after case,
[3:14:29.040 --> 3:14:34.240]  even one day in September about the Munich bombing and the Olympics, at the end,
[3:14:34.240 --> 3:14:37.840]  they have the former head of German intelligence just go, oh, by the way,
[3:14:39.200 --> 3:14:47.920]  to free the Palestinian terrorist, we staged a hijacking of our own aircraft to exchange.
[3:14:47.920 --> 3:14:55.760]  I mean, they just admit false flag terror at the end of the film narrated by Michael Douglas.
[3:14:55.760 --> 3:14:59.360]  I mean, it won an Academy Award. They just put it out there at the end.
[3:14:59.360 --> 3:15:02.960]  Like it's no big deal. I've seen this so many times. It makes my head spin.
[3:15:02.960 --> 3:15:07.520]  The guy probably he acted like a mental deficient. Everybody said that his dad's saying,
[3:15:07.520 --> 3:15:10.880]  you know, he's going to attack. He's at these training bases, stop him.
[3:15:10.880 --> 3:15:14.720]  He doesn't get on the terror list. There's other people on board video taping.
[3:15:14.720 --> 3:15:21.760]  He says there's another guy with a bomb. They cover up all these different facets and angles.
[3:15:21.760 --> 3:15:26.160]  Somebody gets him through security. I believe from past operations,
[3:15:26.160 --> 3:15:31.360]  the only thing that fits as a Sherlock Holmes here is he was told he was taking part in a drill.
[3:15:31.360 --> 3:15:35.680]  And that's why we're videotaping it. It's okay, young man. And whatever they put in
[3:15:35.680 --> 3:15:39.280]  his pants, he didn't know what it was going to do. We know when seven, seven,
[3:15:39.280 --> 3:15:43.200]  they'd hired some of the guys to be part of drills. There was a drill of the exact same
[3:15:43.200 --> 3:15:47.600]  location, exact same time, exact same place being attacked. That's, that's 20 something
[3:15:47.600 --> 3:15:52.800]  tractor Gillian. We had an actuary done on it. One out of 20 something tractor Gillian.
[3:15:52.800 --> 3:15:58.240]  I forget the exact numbers. One out of 23 tractor Gillian. It's trillions of times all the grains
[3:15:58.240 --> 3:16:04.080]  of sand in all the world. It's nearing infinity. But I know, Kurt, you like to stick to the facts,
[3:16:04.080 --> 3:16:08.480]  being vindicated, vindicated, vindicated, vindicated, but this is stinking to high heaven.
[3:16:09.040 --> 3:16:13.040]  Well, you're right. You know, I can't draw any conclusions from it, but you're right. It does
[3:16:13.040 --> 3:16:19.280]  stink. Wouldn't it make more sense for the FBI to have come out and said, look, we're investigating
[3:16:19.280 --> 3:16:24.320]  Mr. Haskell's claims. We'll let you know after we've taken a look at them. That's not what they did.
[3:16:24.320 --> 3:16:28.880]  They came out and said, basically, I'm a liar, refused to show me the video. To me,
[3:16:28.880 --> 3:16:31.920]  they should have showed me the video from the start so I could identify this man
[3:16:32.480 --> 3:16:38.240]  and taken the investigation from there. They didn't do that either. Why not? And, you know,
[3:16:38.240 --> 3:16:44.000]  there was another article, Alex. I think it was from January 18th in the New York Times,
[3:16:44.880 --> 3:16:53.040]  where it's indicated that government officials had wiretaps in Yemen, and they found out that
[3:16:53.040 --> 3:16:59.280]  someone named Umar Farouk would be attacking the U.S. And I believe it even named a day on
[3:16:59.280 --> 3:17:05.360]  Christmas Day this year. Now, why isn't that coming out more in the public? And if you had
[3:17:05.360 --> 3:17:12.640]  this information, why wasn't he stopped? How did he get on her flight? I don't know. Something
[3:17:12.640 --> 3:17:19.520]  doesn't make sense here. Well, Kurt, take care of yourself and your wife. Be safe. Incredible
[3:17:19.520 --> 3:17:24.960]  bombshells. We'll get reports up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. There's so many government
[3:17:24.960 --> 3:17:31.920]  hoaxes and coverups. I'm like somebody in a batting cage with 15 batting machines shooting
[3:17:31.920 --> 3:17:37.520]  balls at me. And I don't even know where to swing now. My head is spinning. But we appreciate your
[3:17:37.520 --> 3:17:45.040]  courage and your observance of what was happening, the fact that you were so observant. In the last
[3:17:45.040 --> 3:17:51.120]  three minutes we've got left. Anything else you think you should add? Just one other thing that
[3:17:51.120 --> 3:17:57.360]  happened since I was on your show last time. I got an email from a Dutch woman confirming my account
[3:17:57.360 --> 3:18:03.600]  of the sharp-dressed man. Now, she couldn't identify him, but she did indicate Abdul Muthalab
[3:18:04.400 --> 3:18:11.040]  was in the area that I stated and was escorted to the desk by another person, but she couldn't
[3:18:11.040 --> 3:18:17.200]  identify him. But she is the only other person to come out and verify my claim of what happened
[3:18:17.200 --> 3:18:23.280]  before we got on the plane. And to me, that made me feel vindicated even more that someone
[3:18:23.280 --> 3:18:28.320]  else saw what I did because I didn't think anyone else did to that point. But she's afraid to come
[3:18:28.320 --> 3:18:35.600]  out in the public because of the backlash that has happened to me. So I did get an email from her
[3:18:35.600 --> 3:18:41.360]  and I called her back and discussed it with her personally. And she does seem very credible to me.
[3:18:43.840 --> 3:18:50.240]  Well, they staged these backlashes against anybody who is taking action and telling the truth.
[3:18:50.240 --> 3:18:56.400]  And you've been vindicated just over and over and over again, but we will get some reports up on
[3:18:56.400 --> 3:19:01.440]  infowars.com and prismplanet.com with all these huge new developments that you just dropped on us
[3:19:01.440 --> 3:19:06.240]  because it's always worse than I even know. Amazing. Now, give us your blog.
[3:19:07.440 --> 3:19:14.480]  Yeah, my blog is my last name, Haskell, H-A-S-K-E-L-L. And then family, all one word.
[3:19:14.480 --> 3:19:22.800]  Haskellfamily.blogspot.com. And it's really my wife's blog, but I post on there too. And we're
[3:19:22.800 --> 3:19:28.800]  always putting updates on the stories. Great. Continually. Great. Well, we'll grab some of the
[3:19:28.800 --> 3:19:32.640]  info off that and post it in the article we're writing. Have you posted this information there
[3:19:32.640 --> 3:19:40.400]  yet? I believe we have. We're continually putting updates on the page. So I think everything I said
[3:19:40.400 --> 3:19:46.720]  in the show today, you can go back on the blog and read. Kurt Haskell, great job, my friend.
[3:19:46.720 --> 3:19:50.960]  God bless you. We'll talk to you again soon. Anytime, Alex. Thanks for having me. Thanks
[3:19:50.960 --> 3:19:55.040]  for coming on. There goes Kurt Haskell. We'll be right back with a brief news blitz. And then
[3:19:55.040 --> 3:20:01.200]  Debra Medina scheduled to be live on air with us one day ahead of the historic gubernatorial debate.

[3:20:12.160 --> 3:20:16.960]  right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy. If we the
[3:20:16.960 --> 3:20:22.720]  people do not diligently assert these rights, they may be taken away and lost forever. Utopia

[3:21:09.840 --> 3:21:15.040]  finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. We have
[3:21:15.040 --> 3:21:20.800]  turned an innocent influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[3:21:20.800 --> 3:21:27.040]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic
[3:21:27.040 --> 3:21:33.600]  identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[3:21:33.600 --> 3:21:38.400]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists,
[3:21:38.400 --> 3:21:42.480]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to?
[3:21:42.480 --> 3:21:48.800]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the
[3:21:48.800 --> 3:21:56.080]  Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right
[3:21:56.080 --> 3:22:03.920]  now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. On the average Americans work between 45 to 50 years
[3:22:03.920 --> 3:22:08.880]  hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately with tax
[3:22:08.880 --> 3:22:14.320]  station, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live
[3:22:14.320 --> 3:22:18.960]  below the poverty line. Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the
[3:22:18.960 --> 3:22:23.920]  Federal Reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[3:22:23.920 --> 3:22:27.920]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book The Creature
[3:22:27.920 --> 3:22:32.640]  from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about
[3:22:32.640 --> 3:22:38.480]  central bank power. A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[3:24:26.160 --> 3:24:33.600]  Man, I just did a 4-minute interview on Dallas Radio. It's starting to be an everyday occurrence
[3:24:33.600 --> 3:24:41.840]  where I'm like, during the breaks on radio shows, I did Russia Today last night on the
[3:24:41.840 --> 3:24:49.440]  Davos Bilderberg group situation going on. You know, they say no rest for the wicked,
[3:24:49.440 --> 3:24:53.760]  but I don't feel very wicked. I feel like a pretty good guy and I'm like, there's no rest because
[3:24:53.760 --> 3:24:58.960]  I morally have to take every, almost every opportunity I've got to expose these people.
[3:25:01.680 --> 3:25:06.400]  On the news front, we do have Debra Medina coming up and I know she's very busy,
[3:25:06.400 --> 3:25:11.520]  so let's try to call her about 28 after I want to try to get on her as early as possible when we
[3:25:11.520 --> 3:25:16.400]  come back because I want to talk to her during the break so I can find out exactly what she
[3:25:16.400 --> 3:25:20.800]  thinks is most important for me to bring up. And I do have with our new Twitter account,
[3:25:20.800 --> 3:25:26.080]  and we have the info wars newsfeed Twitter info war stories. We have the prison planet.
[3:25:26.080 --> 3:25:34.480]  That's the name of the Twitter, you know, Twitter, www.twitter.com forward slash info war stories
[3:25:35.200 --> 3:25:42.880]  forward slash prison planet. We've got those two. Now we have the Twitter slash real Alex Jones
[3:25:43.600 --> 3:25:49.840]  that what 500 people have signed up in 45 minutes. That's pretty neat. But I really,
[3:25:49.840 --> 3:25:57.040]  we are making an attempt to actually use this and for me to use it at night for me to, you know,
[3:25:57.040 --> 3:26:02.640]  really, really get involved with it and really because I'm beginning to realize the power of it.
[3:26:02.640 --> 3:26:07.040]  That's why the CIA, the evidence shows in the State Department of Mitz, they fund it and they give
[3:26:07.040 --> 3:26:12.320]  Twitter special treatment because the government wants to use this like an Iran because they can
[3:26:12.320 --> 3:26:17.760]  coordinate and get flash mobs going and do what they want. But so we need to invade Twitter,
[3:26:17.760 --> 3:26:23.040]  which we've already done obviously with all the other fan accounts, but we need to invade Twitter
[3:26:23.600 --> 3:26:28.320]  because if we really use it for what it's meant to do, but it back against the New World Order,
[3:26:29.040 --> 3:26:32.640]  I mean, I can be when we have 50,000, 100,000 members in a few months,
[3:26:33.920 --> 3:26:39.840]  I could be at a protest or at a news story or I could be somewhere doing an interview and,
[3:26:39.840 --> 3:26:43.920]  and if we get in trouble or something's happening, I could fire a Twitter out and we've got so many
[3:26:43.920 --> 3:26:48.640]  listeners that they'll be people down the block that can respond with video cameras. And also,
[3:26:48.640 --> 3:26:52.960]  I'm going to have my staff, which they're doing now, looking at the Twitter, giving us stories,
[3:26:52.960 --> 3:26:59.200]  giving us ideas, giving us information. So the real Alex Jones. So again, ladies and
[3:27:01.200 --> 3:27:03.440]  absolutely will come in here and give them the full address. Okay.
[3:27:04.400 --> 3:27:10.880]  It's twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones, twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones.
[3:27:10.880 --> 3:27:15.600]  And I'll have that committed to memory very, very soon. You're going to say something else, Matt Ryan.
[3:27:16.880 --> 3:27:22.160]  Oh, yes. Just mentioning basically during the, during the break, you know, we've got a lot of
[3:27:22.160 --> 3:27:26.800]  things going on. I'll give you kind of a behind the scenes look at what goes into the show. I know
[3:27:26.800 --> 3:27:31.840]  a lot of stuff goes on during the commercials. A lot of people don't get to see. So this Twitter is
[3:27:31.840 --> 3:27:37.680]  a way you can, you can kind of find out what's going on during this, this crazy show sometimes.
[3:27:37.680 --> 3:27:44.880]  But it's a twitter.com slash real Alex Jones. Also, if you wanted to keep up with the stories,
[3:27:44.880 --> 3:27:51.680]  also going out on info wars.com, prison planet.com. It's twitter.com slash info wars stories
[3:27:52.320 --> 3:27:56.720]  for info wars. And for prison planet, it's twitter.com slash prison planet.
[3:27:56.720 --> 3:28:00.560]  Okay. Thank you so much. I just plug it on Dallas radio too. So,
[3:28:00.560 --> 3:28:10.880]  uh, oh boy, I'll tell you, I, um, I wanted to point something out.
[3:28:12.160 --> 3:28:18.480]  Ford isn't a perfect corporation to say the least, but they're the only company that didn't take
[3:28:18.480 --> 3:28:26.480]  bank or bailout money. The only big one. And they're the only ones still actually building
[3:28:26.480 --> 3:28:33.040]  plants on a routine basis here in the U S remember billions and billions of the
[3:28:34.400 --> 3:28:37.600]  over 50 billion total paid out to several big automakers.
[3:28:38.560 --> 3:28:44.720]  Billions of that went to move whole plants to Brazil, Eastern Europe, Russia and China.
[3:28:45.680 --> 3:28:52.160]  That's the new world order. Just like Puchari, the head of the IPCC,
[3:28:52.160 --> 3:28:58.480]  a multi hundred million dollar deal that he profited from, he owns it, part of it,
[3:28:59.600 --> 3:29:07.840]  to move steel mills from England to India, the same system. See, that's what globalism is,
[3:29:07.840 --> 3:29:16.160]  is not just taxing you. It's that they get to decide who gets to operate,
[3:29:16.160 --> 3:29:20.240]  who gets to have a business, who gets to survive. And these are multinational
[3:29:20.240 --> 3:29:27.520]  globalist corporations. But I'll tell you, Ford earns 2.7 billion in 2009. They ended up making
[3:29:27.520 --> 3:29:37.920]  money without being part of the scam. So if there's any U S auto maker left, if there's any auto
[3:29:37.920 --> 3:29:46.000]  maker that's got any patriotism, it's Ford and I don't drive or own a Ford. I've got a Chrysler,
[3:29:46.000 --> 3:29:50.880]  but good news there. We'll be right back with every Modena.
[3:29:51.600 --> 3:29:58.320]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:02.240 --> 3:30:06.240]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:30:06.240 --> 3:30:12.080]  This is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[3:30:12.080 --> 3:30:17.520]  pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president
[3:30:17.520 --> 3:30:23.440]  in Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[3:30:23.440 --> 3:30:29.120]  as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[3:30:29.120 --> 3:30:34.480]  the criminal offshore cartel, hell bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes
[3:30:34.480 --> 3:30:38.960]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for
[3:30:38.960 --> 3:30:43.600]  more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody
[3:30:43.600 --> 3:30:50.560]  does care. And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy

[3:31:35.520 --> 3:31:40.240]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches,

[3:32:08.880 --> 3:32:13.440]  Gun prices are going through the roof, and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want
[3:32:13.440 --> 3:32:18.880]  your guns and will do anything to get them. Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding

[3:33:21.200 --> 3:33:35.920]  All right, she's doing back-to-back-to-back interviews. She's going to join us Sunday
[3:33:36.560 --> 3:33:42.640]  at 5.30 on the Sunday edition to give us in hindsight what happened at the debate coming
[3:33:42.640 --> 3:33:47.920]  up tomorrow night. Deborah Medina running for the Republican primary that's coming up very,
[3:33:47.920 --> 3:33:53.120]  very soon. We put pressure on them, our great listeners, other people across the state. She's
[3:33:53.120 --> 3:33:58.320]  an in-the-fetter, and she's running against Kay Bailey Hutchinson, and of course, good old Rick
[3:33:58.320 --> 3:34:03.520]  Perry. We need her. She's surging in the polls. Deborah, give us a report from inside the campaign.
[3:34:03.520 --> 3:34:09.040]  What's happening? Well, we are doing debate prep today. I got into Dallas this morning,
[3:34:09.040 --> 3:34:14.320]  and the team is here. We're working to make sure our numbers and our data are good. I think
[3:34:14.320 --> 3:34:19.360]  that that was one of the things that I've heard since the debate. Boy, you would answer a question.
[3:34:19.920 --> 3:34:25.200]  I'm able to answer those questions because I made the commitment to Texans that I was preparing
[3:34:25.200 --> 3:34:31.360]  to be our governor beginning in February when I started this race over a year ago. I'm continuing
[3:34:31.360 --> 3:34:38.720]  that work today. We've got lots of opportunity in Texas, lots of places where the bar has been
[3:34:38.720 --> 3:34:43.280]  really placed pretty low for excellence in government service. We're looking at raising
[3:34:43.280 --> 3:34:48.560]  that bar, making sure we're using the tax dollars that we're taking for moms and dads and business
[3:34:48.560 --> 3:34:53.200]  people across the state of Texas. We're using them frugally. We're using them wisely. We're
[3:34:53.200 --> 3:34:58.400]  going to use them transparently, and we're going to demand excellence in government service by
[3:34:58.400 --> 3:35:03.840]  and looking forward to an opportunity to share that vision. Talk with Texans tomorrow night at seven
[3:35:03.840 --> 3:35:08.880]  o'clock. Well, I told the story of my grandmother. My mom was driving her to physical therapy
[3:35:08.880 --> 3:35:13.600]  last week, and she said, who are you going to vote for? And she said, Medina, because I like her
[3:35:13.600 --> 3:35:19.440]  straight talk and the fact that you are calling for getting rid of the property tax. You are calling
[3:35:20.080 --> 3:35:27.360]  for true freedom in this state. But I got a Twitter message from a listener.
[3:35:28.080 --> 3:35:33.600]  It's Oprah's heart is the Twitter question to the real Alex Jones Twitter account. It says,
[3:35:33.600 --> 3:35:40.000]  can Debra Medina address the EO forming a council of governors in its implication to subverting
[3:35:40.000 --> 3:35:44.320]  posse commentators? Obama signed that executive order. He says he's going to let 10 governors
[3:35:44.320 --> 3:35:49.440]  speak for the state. I mean, what are you going to do against the federal takeover of the states?
[3:35:49.440 --> 3:35:54.720]  Well, you're going to stand. We're going to stand real hard using nullification and interposition.
[3:35:54.720 --> 3:36:00.800]  The governor has unilateral authority on interposition. I hope to be able to create a good
[3:36:00.800 --> 3:36:06.160]  working relationship with this legislature to get them to nullify where they need to.
[3:36:06.160 --> 3:36:10.640]  But I believe that when we have a champion of the people in the governor's office,
[3:36:10.640 --> 3:36:17.040]  we will also see an attorney general who is more active in going to federal court and fighting
[3:36:17.040 --> 3:36:22.560]  against the overreach of the federal government. You'll see a governor who's instructing state
[3:36:22.560 --> 3:36:28.160]  agencies that they are only going to enforce state law. They are not going to be the puppet on the
[3:36:28.160 --> 3:36:34.160]  end of the strings of Washington DC dancing whatever to Washington decides to whistle today.
[3:36:34.160 --> 3:36:41.760]  We are going to make sure that Texas is regulating Texas and not Washington DC. Those two things
[3:36:41.760 --> 3:36:46.720]  happen through the executive branch of the government. And then if we work closely with the
[3:36:46.720 --> 3:36:52.160]  legislature, we should see them not just passing sovereignty resolutions that have the equivalent
[3:36:52.160 --> 3:36:58.320]  of saying, you know, dirt's wet and the sky's blue, but passing law that has teeth in it to stop
[3:36:58.320 --> 3:37:02.800]  this overreach, this illegal federal action. These things are not federal laws. They're in
[3:37:02.800 --> 3:37:07.840]  constitutional. They do not rise to the level of law. They are illegal federal action. They
[3:37:07.840 --> 3:37:12.240]  need to be stopped by state legislatures. Texas ought to be leading on that front.
[3:37:12.800 --> 3:37:17.120]  What would your position be? There's open calls from Congress for guidance or resign
[3:37:17.120 --> 3:37:22.080]  for criminal indictments. The Federal Reserve does come into Texas. What they do does
[3:37:22.080 --> 3:37:27.040]  affect Texas. We could have a state investigation. Ron Paul has said that that could be one of
[3:37:27.040 --> 3:37:32.880]  the places against the banks and others would be grand juries. As governor, would you call for
[3:37:32.880 --> 3:37:39.440]  investigations of the private banking cartel? Absolutely. Now, shifting gears in the time
[3:37:39.440 --> 3:37:44.080]  we have with you, obviously you've seen the media make the point in the parallel that,
[3:37:44.720 --> 3:37:50.480]  just like Brown took that Democratic seat in Massachusetts, the people of Texas are sick of
[3:37:50.480 --> 3:37:56.080]  big government, fake Republicans like Hutchinson and, of course, Perry, and that you're surging in
[3:37:56.080 --> 3:37:59.920]  the polls. Even if you don't win and you have a good chance, people get behind you right now and
[3:37:59.920 --> 3:38:06.240]  spread the word, that this is a message to other libertarians, constitutionalists in the Fedders,
[3:38:06.240 --> 3:38:13.360]  true constitutionalists, that this race has national import just like the situation in
[3:38:13.360 --> 3:38:19.200]  Massachusetts. It absolutely has national import. Alex, we've got a lot of work to do. This is about
[3:38:19.200 --> 3:38:26.720]  more than just showing up somewhere in a rally. You've got to go vote. And so many people say,
[3:38:26.720 --> 3:38:33.440]  oh, yeah, I'm voting or oh, yeah, I've voted when, in fact, they did not vote. Please, please,
[3:38:33.440 --> 3:38:39.280]  make a list of people that you know that are supporting this campaign and then go to your
[3:38:39.280 --> 3:38:44.880]  courthouse during the early voting period and look to see if those people have voted or not. And if
[3:38:44.880 --> 3:38:51.600]  they haven't voted, call them, make sure they get to the poll. We have got to vote. When we vote,
[3:38:51.600 --> 3:38:56.480]  we're going to win this race. We're not going to cause a runoff. We are going to win this race.
[3:38:56.480 --> 3:39:02.160]  Well, Perry won the primary before with 500,000 votes. I mean, we've got a couple million Ron
[3:39:02.160 --> 3:39:07.440]  Paul supporters and true patriots in Texas. But they've got to vote. And so many people say,
[3:39:07.440 --> 3:39:12.560]  yes, I will. And then it gets right down to the wire and they do not vote. We've got to vote.
[3:39:12.560 --> 3:39:17.920]  We've got to hold one another accountable. Tell folks election day, Debra. Tell folks election
[3:39:17.920 --> 3:39:28.320]  day. Early voting starts February 16th. It runs for 12 straight days Monday through the following
[3:39:28.320 --> 3:39:33.040]  Friday, Friday, two weeks after Monday through Monday through Friday, Saturday, Sunday and the
[3:39:33.040 --> 3:39:38.560]  next Monday through Friday, Friday afternoon at five o'clock. Early voting is over. Election day
[3:39:38.560 --> 3:39:45.840]  is March 2nd from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Please do not wait until March 2nd. Go vote during that early
[3:39:45.840 --> 3:39:51.600]  voting period. You can vote at any polling location in your county. Go vote. Make sure your family
[3:39:51.600 --> 3:39:56.400]  votes. Make sure your neighbors vote. We'll win this race in Texas. All right. Moving quickly,
[3:39:56.400 --> 3:40:00.480]  because we've only got about six, seven minutes left with you, Debra Medina. And we'll have you
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:06.720]  back Sunday at 5.30 central for the aftermath of the debate. But obviously, I'm sure you've
[3:40:06.720 --> 3:40:13.040]  heard about the old Austin gun show got shut down with no law. And the police was went on the news
[3:40:13.040 --> 3:40:18.240]  and said, Hey, you can't have private sales and basically intimidated H E B to shut it down.
[3:40:18.240 --> 3:40:24.640]  They've gotten a new center, the target center, the Perry said that if the feds try to shut that
[3:40:24.640 --> 3:40:29.280]  down, it will be harassment. What about the harassment, the racketeering that just happened,
[3:40:29.280 --> 3:40:35.200]  the violation of the 10th amendment as governor? What would you do when the city of Austin and
[3:40:35.200 --> 3:40:41.360]  the B A T F E the ATF try to shut down legal lawful gun shows? I think when you have a governor
[3:40:41.360 --> 3:40:49.200]  who sets the tone and reminds us that this is a republic, we follow law and hold our elected
[3:40:49.200 --> 3:40:53.840]  officials and our agencies accountable to following that law. You wouldn't have that kind of thing
[3:40:53.840 --> 3:40:59.360]  happening in the first place. This is not a democracy. We don't operate under popular public
[3:40:59.360 --> 3:41:04.720]  opinion. We follow the law. And when the law is not followed in Texas, it doesn't matter whether
[3:41:04.720 --> 3:41:09.600]  it's the first time. I mean, we shouldn't have to wait for it to be the 500th time that the law
[3:41:09.600 --> 3:41:12.800]  was broken. And that's essentially what the governor said. I will let them get away with it
[3:41:12.800 --> 3:41:16.240]  this time. If they do it again, we'll get we'll get after them. Then we're going to follow the
[3:41:16.240 --> 3:41:22.720]  law. Are we not going to follow the law that laws that are are just and proper and then follow
[3:41:22.720 --> 3:41:29.920]  those laws? I have, as you know, advocated less restriction on the sale of guns, not more. It's
[3:41:29.920 --> 3:41:37.200]  a shame that the governor who professes to be a second amendment guy doesn't stand up for gun
[3:41:37.200 --> 3:41:42.880]  sales in Texas. Debra Medina running for governor in the Republican primary. Get out there and vote
[3:41:42.880 --> 3:41:48.960]  for hers coming up in just a few weeks in early voting. I have another Twitter question here
[3:41:48.960 --> 3:41:54.800]  that came into the real Alex Jones Twitter account. Tommy Daniels, Jr. asked a question
[3:41:54.800 --> 3:42:00.160]  for Debra Medina. What is your position on the campaign for open carry of firearms in Texas?
[3:42:01.280 --> 3:42:06.560]  I think that it's another diversion for us. We should not have to have law. What do we not
[3:42:06.560 --> 3:42:14.080]  understand about shall not be infringed? Let's remove the restrictions to gun ownership and gun
[3:42:14.080 --> 3:42:21.840]  possession. Make sure that people are able to keep buy a gun, learn to use it and keep it with them
[3:42:21.840 --> 3:42:30.560]  without regulation by the state, without regulation by the Fed. If someone uses that gun in a way that
[3:42:30.560 --> 3:42:38.640]  causes harm to people or property, we have laws on the books to address that and we should use
[3:42:38.640 --> 3:42:44.960]  those laws. But we ought not be infringing on people's right. We cannot take away the God
[3:42:44.960 --> 3:42:51.920]  given inalienable right to protect my own life. People need to buy guns, learn to use them, keep
[3:42:51.920 --> 3:42:56.160]  them with them, shouldn't have to be jumping through hoops, shouldn't have to have special
[3:42:56.160 --> 3:43:01.920]  legislation to open carry, shouldn't have to take a CHL class, ought to be able to buy the gun and
[3:43:01.920 --> 3:43:06.080]  keep it. We already have open carry. The police will just arrest you without a law. Just like you
[3:43:06.080 --> 3:43:10.080]  can't put a rifle in your gun rack, they'll arrest you. There's no law. They're lawless.
[3:43:10.080 --> 3:43:15.120]  One last Twitter question from Jay Long. He asked, would you please ask Deborah what she's doing
[3:43:16.240 --> 3:43:20.000]  going to do about the superhighway plans in Texas if elected?
[3:43:21.040 --> 3:43:26.960]  There won't be the superhighway, certainly in the way that it's been proposed, either as the
[3:43:26.960 --> 3:43:31.920]  Trans-Texas Corridor, the Port De Plains Highway, the North American Super Corridor by any other
[3:43:31.920 --> 3:43:39.520]  name. It is an abuse of private property in Texas. It is a dismantling of our sovereignty as a
[3:43:39.520 --> 3:43:44.960]  nation and as a state. It is an allegiance and an alliance with the North American Union. Another
[3:43:44.960 --> 3:43:52.560]  one world order agendas. It is bad for Texas. We've got to have an audit of TextDOT. We've
[3:43:52.560 --> 3:43:58.000]  got to have studies of transportation from independent people, not people aligned with
[3:43:58.000 --> 3:44:04.720]  this big transportation machine. We've got to have transparency with the use of tax dollars.
[3:44:04.720 --> 3:44:07.920]  Man, we're almost out of time. We've only got two minutes, Deborah, because you've
[3:44:07.920 --> 3:44:12.880]  got to go. But I just love for you to be our governor. You are so good. You are so right.
[3:44:12.880 --> 3:44:17.680]  I mean, it reminds me that TextDOT told the legislature, you can't audit us and see our
[3:44:17.680 --> 3:44:24.160]  books with foreign companies in Spain like Centra and Zachary of Australia. But in closing,
[3:44:24.160 --> 3:44:30.560]  in the two minutes we've got left with you, I've got two questions for you. A, well, one statement.
[3:44:30.560 --> 3:44:36.000]  I think you should go on the attack as you did, but really forcefully and say, Texas has a choice.
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:41.520]  If you want more of the same or true freedom, go with Deborah Medina. Please be even more
[3:44:41.520 --> 3:44:48.320]  aggressive. People are ready for you to do it. That's my advice. We need a big bomb politically
[3:44:48.320 --> 3:44:55.680]  to go off in their face in the Info War. A, how are you going after Perry and K-Baby?
[3:44:55.680 --> 3:45:02.160]  And then, secondarily, how do we support you going in to next month with the early voting
[3:45:02.160 --> 3:45:06.560]  and then into the election at the end of the month? Well, I'm going to go after both of them on
[3:45:06.560 --> 3:45:12.080]  their record and on their failure to articulate a plan to restore freedom and prosperity for Texas.
[3:45:12.080 --> 3:45:16.560]  And you're absolutely right. I'm hitting both hard. We're drawing votes from both camps. We're
[3:45:16.560 --> 3:45:22.000]  drawing votes from all over Texas. We're going to continue to do that. We need elbow grease,
[3:45:22.000 --> 3:45:27.840]  shoe leather, and dollars. If you can help us with any of those things, prayer cover is great.
[3:45:27.840 --> 3:45:33.360]  You know, any of the four and all that you can apply to this campaign, we have a real opportunity
[3:45:33.360 --> 3:45:40.160]  here in Texas. We can win this race, win it, fair and square, win it, clean away, just like we won
[3:45:40.160 --> 3:45:48.320]  the last debate. We won that debate hands down. Hands down every poll said Medina won that debate.
[3:45:48.320 --> 3:45:53.440]  That's we Texans advocating the message of freedom that our founders stake their life,
[3:45:53.440 --> 3:45:59.680]  their liberty, their sacred honor for the freedom that those kids in Tenement Square died for.
[3:45:59.680 --> 3:46:05.520]  We can win in Texas elbow grease, shoe leather, dollars, prayer cover. Let's get it done.
[3:46:06.640 --> 3:46:11.600]  And regardless, resistance is victory. You're out there injecting real issues
[3:46:12.160 --> 3:46:16.640]  into the debate at the state level, like Ron Paul did nationally and internationally.
[3:46:16.640 --> 3:46:21.120]  Standing up, we win. Now look at the banks about to get audited. Look at the private
[3:46:21.120 --> 3:46:26.800]  fellow reserve on the run. Look at the flu hoax exposed. Look at the carbon tax and Copenhagen
[3:46:26.800 --> 3:46:31.680]  falling apart. The whole new world order is out in the open now and the peasants are getting
[3:46:31.680 --> 3:46:37.120]  their pitchforks, Deborah. Hallelujah. All right, we'll talk to you. I'm going to hand you over to
[3:46:37.120 --> 3:46:42.720]  my producer right before you go. Deborah, we'll talk to you Sunday during the four to six p.m.
[3:46:42.720 --> 3:46:47.120]  program. Thank you for joining us on Sunday. Perfect. Thank you. And good luck tomorrow night.
[3:46:47.120 --> 3:46:53.040]  Everybody pray for her very, very exciting that that is going on and happening. And look,
[3:46:53.600 --> 3:46:58.640]  I got your Twitter questions in and starting tomorrow. I kind of forgot about it for a few
[3:46:58.640 --> 3:47:02.480]  weeks. We're calling the problems. We forgot for a few weeks and then there's over a thousand phone
[3:47:02.480 --> 3:47:08.560]  calls in the comment line. We're going to continue to play some of those on the show.
[3:47:09.440 --> 3:47:16.240]  So definitely look forward to that. But again, one minute comment line where you can go in and
[3:47:16.240 --> 3:47:20.560]  make your quick comment. Problem is we have to wade through people that go in there and make
[3:47:20.560 --> 3:47:26.640]  like 30, 40, 50 a day. And that's most that there's probably 300 people that called, but
[3:47:26.640 --> 3:47:34.080]  20 or 30 of them left like 100 messages. So it's crazy. Oh man. I mean, having this much
[3:47:34.080 --> 3:47:38.160]  grassroots support, having these many tens of millions of listeners in the aggregate,
[3:47:38.160 --> 3:47:43.280]  millions that tune in every week, we look at the numbers for prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[3:47:43.280 --> 3:47:51.040]  Um, there were over 5 million different IP addresses that came into infowars.com the last
[3:47:51.040 --> 3:48:00.160]  month, 5 million, just over 4 million for, um, for prisonplanet. That's 5 million different people
[3:48:01.200 --> 3:48:10.160]  at one, 4 million on the other. Uh, infowars had over 50 million page views. That's not hits,
[3:48:10.160 --> 3:48:13.760]  folks. A hit, they trick you with that number. That's every graphic or whatever on the page,
[3:48:13.760 --> 3:48:17.360]  you know, five people visit your site, you get 100 hits. No, no, we're talking about
[3:48:17.920 --> 3:48:22.640]  devastating amounts of traffic against the new world order. I mean, everything we write,
[3:48:22.640 --> 3:48:27.760]  everything we post, everything we do just has huge effect. And I believe me, I know
[3:48:27.760 --> 3:48:32.080]  the responsibility of that and I'm not perfect and I'm trying to step up to the plate in this
[3:48:32.080 --> 3:48:36.640]  position we're in. Just remember though, there's a lot of dirty tricks, a lot of dirty tricks
[3:48:36.640 --> 3:48:40.800]  getting run against myself, Deborah Medina, Ron Paul, everybody else because we're on the right
[3:48:40.800 --> 3:48:45.760]  side of history, because we're telling the truth, because we're getting involved. I want to come
[3:48:45.760 --> 3:48:51.360]  back with a really serious news blitz at the very end of the show. Very, very serious news blitz.
[3:48:51.360 --> 3:48:58.000]  But before I do that, I also want to encourage everybody, uh, to support us. We have shadow
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:49:02.640]  government that is really a hot video. I saw it. We only carry what I think is the best.
[3:49:02.640 --> 3:49:10.160]  Uh, it's got, uh, Daniel Estolin, uh, it's got, um, you know, so many other G Edward Griffin's in it.
[3:49:10.880 --> 3:49:15.120]  It's got Catherine Albrick and so many others and it really exposes the new world order,
[3:49:15.120 --> 3:49:20.160]  the casual society tracking grid, the RFID, obviously fall the republic. This is the film
[3:49:20.160 --> 3:49:23.920]  to shadow the left, right paradigm to wake up fake, right wingers, left wingers to really
[3:49:23.920 --> 3:49:28.320]  know who the enemy is, the big offshore banks, the carbon tax fraud. It's, it's all in here.
[3:49:28.320 --> 3:49:34.560]  Obviously, uh, the Obama, uh, deception and there's a new video I consulted on that exposes the drug
[3:49:34.560 --> 3:49:40.640]  war, the government drug dealing. It's a lot more hardcore than American drug war. That just
[3:49:40.640 --> 3:49:45.120]  exposes how immoral it is and how it puts money into the drugs. I'm making them illegal and makes
[3:49:45.120 --> 3:49:52.240]  more people use them. This is a hardcore film that Kevin Booth has made and it ships the 15th
[3:49:52.240 --> 3:49:58.480]  of next month at 17 days. It's being mass manufactured right now. Um, I'm paying for
[3:49:58.480 --> 3:50:03.920]  to be manufactured. I'm actually the one manufacturing. Uh, so how weed won the west
[3:50:04.720 --> 3:50:09.040]  and it explains how it's the state's rights issue, how the government's caught dealing the drugs,
[3:50:09.040 --> 3:50:13.520]  how they don't want people to have medical access to it, but how this is really setting the precedent
[3:50:13.520 --> 3:50:17.440]  for states rights because if, because if the states can decide their own marijuana laws,
[3:50:17.440 --> 3:50:22.320]  you want to ban it, want to legalize it, want to decriminalize it, that's, that's the people of the
[3:50:22.320 --> 3:50:29.280]  state. They elect the legislature. Um, it's a law, but now other states are saying, well, we'll
[3:50:30.000 --> 3:50:35.280]  have our own manufacturing of guns, Montana and now others, or, you know, we'll have our own gun
[3:50:35.280 --> 3:50:39.040]  laws. Uh, we're, we're, some states are saying we're just going to ignore your federal gun laws
[3:50:39.040 --> 3:50:42.720]  because that's what the constitution says. This is the rebellion at the state level.
[3:50:42.720 --> 3:50:49.760]  Pre-order how weed won the west. Absolutely amazing documentary available at info wars.com
[3:50:50.320 --> 3:50:55.840]  right now on the trailers up on the Alex Jones channel, uh, at YouTube or just Google how we'd
[3:50:55.840 --> 3:51:00.240]  won the west trailer Alex Jones. We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break with
[3:51:00.240 --> 3:51:04.560]  a key news. Let's stay with us. Americans have heard much about change in recent times and are
[3:51:04.560 --> 3:51:09.360]  now waking up to the truth. Well, here's a few facts about your food you may want to change.
[3:51:09.360 --> 3:51:14.160]  Did you know that nearly 100% of the food on store shelves comes from a few corporations
[3:51:14.160 --> 3:51:19.120]  and that most is genetically engineered, chemically sprayed and transported great distances? Baker
[3:51:19.120 --> 3:51:23.920]  Creek heirloom seed company like you wants to see Americans change and take control of their own
[3:51:23.920 --> 3:51:29.680]  food supply one seed at a time. Over 12 years, we've become America's premier supplier of pure

[3:52:00.720 --> 3:52:09.040]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not
[3:52:09.040 --> 3:52:14.720]  relive history. Is it finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[3:52:14.720 --> 3:52:20.720]  at home? I've turned an innocent influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[3:52:20.720 --> 3:52:26.640]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:26.640 --> 3:52:32.400]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal off-short cartel held
[3:52:32.400 --> 3:52:37.520]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[3:52:37.520 --> 3:52:41.840]  Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[3:52:41.840 --> 3:52:46.480]  who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington,
[3:52:46.480 --> 3:52:53.520]  D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD

[3:53:10.240 --> 3:53:16.080]  Have you ever needed something but you forgot? You know, some of our life change tea customers
[3:53:16.080 --> 3:53:22.320]  forget to order and then they ask us for some rush shipping. What if it was automatic? You know,

[3:53:49.680 --> 3:53:57.280]  so call us. There's no better way to jump start your health. Look us up at getthetea.com. That's
[3:53:57.280 --> 3:54:20.480]  getthetea.com. I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio. George Strait was singing Seashore's
[3:54:20.480 --> 3:54:30.800]  Beautiful Mexico. It sounded so good. I've got an idea. We are back live. Ladies and gentlemen,
[3:54:30.800 --> 3:54:39.120]  final segment news blitz. Gag order on David Kelly records could be lifted. London Guardian.
[3:54:39.120 --> 3:54:45.840]  Remember, they suicided him. The police walked up. Five men in black uniforms ran away. There was no
[3:54:45.840 --> 3:54:55.360]  blood from his slit wrist. No dissolved pills. They killed him. And then after that happened,
[3:54:55.360 --> 3:55:00.320]  they covered it up and put a 70-year gag order. But all these doctors and lawyers are suing
[3:55:00.320 --> 3:55:03.280]  and demanding it be open and they're saying, okay, we may do that.
[3:55:05.920 --> 3:55:12.560]  Obama likely to rebrand climate bill. Just like they've got a new banker looting robbery bill,
[3:55:12.560 --> 3:55:17.120]  they falsely branded it as a bailout. They weren't in trouble. It was just more thieving.
[3:55:17.680 --> 3:55:23.760]  Now they're going to call it a jobs bill despite the obituaries being written for Senate passage
[3:55:23.760 --> 3:55:28.400]  of the cap and trade bill this year. President Obama is expected to reiterate his call for
[3:55:28.400 --> 3:55:33.840]  comprehensive clean energy, but it's not clean energy. It's a tax. And climate change legislation
[3:55:33.840 --> 3:55:40.320]  and to rebrand it as part of his job creation agenda. So that's going on. Continuing here,
[3:55:40.320 --> 3:55:47.600]  mad scientists want to stimulate volcanoes to block sun because the earth is too hot when
[3:55:47.600 --> 3:55:50.960]  the earth has been getting colder for at least a decade. And that's a normal cycle.
[3:55:51.520 --> 3:55:57.520]  Paul Joseph Watson, key article there. Continuing the mail newspaper, climate
[3:55:57.520 --> 3:56:02.000]  gate scandal. Scientists broke the law by hiding data from government skeptics.
[3:56:03.440 --> 3:56:07.600]  Researchers at the University of East Anglia breached the Freedom Information Act,
[3:56:07.600 --> 3:56:11.360]  refusing to comply with requests for the data and the email show they colluded.
[3:56:11.360 --> 3:56:15.360]  That's the big crime. I told you a couple months ago and now it's coming out. It's
[3:56:15.360 --> 3:56:19.360]  obvious what crimes are, how they brag. We've talked to the government. We're going to suppress
[3:56:19.360 --> 3:56:28.080]  it illegally. So that is continuing compulsory perv scanners upset everyone. The registered
[3:56:28.080 --> 3:56:33.760]  the European Union court of human rights is going to love this. The debate over the use of
[3:56:33.760 --> 3:56:39.440]  scanners in the UK airports is rapidly turning into a knockabout farce as the equity and human
[3:56:39.440 --> 3:56:43.600]  rights commission takes a firm stand on some people's right to privacy while government
[3:56:43.600 --> 3:56:49.040]  disrespects everyone's right and prepares to hand over loads more when it doesn't essentially lose
[3:56:49.040 --> 3:56:52.800]  the argument at the European court. And they're saying you will not be allowed to refuse the
[3:56:52.800 --> 3:56:57.360]  naked body scanner if you fly in or out of England. So that'll be a big boycott of that country
[3:56:57.920 --> 3:57:02.640]  going on on that front. Ron Paul tells Neil Cavuto, the government wants inflation,
[3:57:02.640 --> 3:57:07.760]  devaluation of the dollar. And he talks about why they want to do that. We have that video up
[3:57:07.760 --> 3:57:13.040]  at a key article at info wars.net by Steve Watson. This is a very important article.
[3:57:13.680 --> 3:57:18.560]  Ron Paul agrees they're doing this by design. Well, of course they are Pentagon calls for
[3:57:18.560 --> 3:57:22.960]  office of strategic deception from raw story. And then it gets into how they admit how they're
[3:57:22.960 --> 3:57:28.960]  specifically lying internationally and domestically through the media and blogs and putting out
[3:57:28.960 --> 3:57:34.640]  this information. Wired magazine is also reporting on that. In the first hour, I covered little
[3:57:34.640 --> 3:57:39.200]  tenemy Geithner and how much trouble he's in open talk of criminal indictments and demands on the
[3:57:39.200 --> 3:57:44.880]  dais that he resigned. So again, more good news there. But again, the new owners here, they're
[3:57:44.880 --> 3:57:48.800]  oppressing us, but people are waking up and getting angry at all their criminal activity.
[3:57:48.800 --> 3:57:53.120]  It's our jobs just saying, no, I'm not going along with your criminal activity.
[3:57:53.120 --> 3:57:59.440]  So that is just some of what we covered. I'll play more of this State of the Union to Mara and
[3:57:59.440 --> 3:58:05.200]  more of the grilling of Paulson. We didn't even get to that and what that swindler did, call them
[3:58:05.200 --> 3:58:10.640]  out for what they are. Crooks like I do and follow the Republican Obama deception. Now,
[3:58:10.640 --> 3:58:16.800]  mainstream accepted because the facts are the facts. Well, that was an incredible show today.
