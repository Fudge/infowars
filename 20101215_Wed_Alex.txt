[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:33.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.000 --> 00:40.680]  obviously everyone is talking about the school board shooting with Clay Duke the
[00:40.680 --> 00:45.760]  56 year old gunman who opened fire on school board members in protest against
[00:45.760 --> 00:51.640]  his wife being fired in his unemployment benefits running out and of course we
[00:51.640 --> 00:56.800]  have the footage of the security guard shooting him after he was randomly
[00:56.800 --> 01:02.560]  shooting at the school board and missing all eight shots that he fired then the
[01:02.560 --> 01:07.560]  security guard is able to shoot him and mr. Duke then turns his gun on himself
[01:07.560 --> 01:11.240]  we're not going to show you the snuff film part of it if you're watching on
[01:11.240 --> 01:17.040]  prisonplanet.tv but it is up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com that is
[01:17.040 --> 01:21.600]  video links to footage that does not have him you know going ahead and
[01:21.600 --> 01:25.560]  shooting himself in the head but up until that point what an incredible story
[01:25.560 --> 01:29.480]  he's just got so many different angles to it you have the school board female
[01:29.480 --> 01:33.760]  member coming up behind him with a big baggy purse like something out of a
[01:33.760 --> 01:37.280]  pillow fight but she had amazing courage and hitting him on the back of the head
[01:37.280 --> 01:44.200]  you've got the school board superintendent very calmly trying to talk
[01:44.200 --> 01:48.960]  the guy out of it you've got the dynamic of someone being armed stopping him
[01:48.960 --> 01:53.720]  you've got the dynamic of why is it almost always government employees or
[01:53.720 --> 01:58.800]  the husbands or wives of them in the classic cliche of going postal that go
[01:58.800 --> 02:03.760]  out and do things like this and what's gonna happen as people lose their jobs
[02:03.760 --> 02:08.440]  and as the country goes bankrupt what did Gerald Salente say yesterday he said
[02:08.440 --> 02:14.560]  that when people lose everything they lose it and he said it's gonna be off
[02:14.560 --> 02:20.360]  with their heads it's gonna be off with the heads in 2011 he's been saying that
[02:20.360 --> 02:29.440]  for the last year what did they chant in London attacking the car of the Prince
[02:29.440 --> 02:34.480]  of Wales and his wife the Duchess of Cornwall or whatever it is I mean this
[02:34.480 --> 02:40.360]  is incredible and I want to walk through the psychology and the sociology and
[02:40.360 --> 02:45.000]  really the anthropology of what happens when societies begin to shut down and
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  go into serious depressions crime exploded there were a lot of problems back
[02:49.000 --> 02:58.480]  in the 1920s during the Great Depression into the 1930s 1929 through 1940 but if
[02:58.480 --> 03:02.640]  you look at the social makeup of society if you look at the fact that people on
[03:02.640 --> 03:08.000]  average are not self-sufficient most of us are it's some way or another
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.720]  decadent compared to our ancestors just because they were living closer to the
[03:12.720 --> 03:19.960]  land closer to reality this is an explosive situation that we are facing
[03:19.960 --> 03:26.600]  and so I'm gonna be walking through all of it today but the security guard Mike
[03:26.600 --> 03:32.400]  Jones went in and shot the guy thank God he had firearm training thank God that
[03:32.400 --> 03:40.200]  this mainline liberal Mr. Clay Duke did not know how to shoot or didn't want to
[03:40.200 --> 03:43.320]  follow through with it a lot of soldiers they found up until World War two and
[03:43.320 --> 03:51.960]  after up close couldn't shoot other soldiers in a battle they would they
[03:51.960 --> 03:56.000]  would you know purposefully miss that's why they did instinctive shooting with
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.120]  paper targets and then video games in the 80s and 90s to where now over 90% of
[04:01.120 --> 04:05.160]  troops will sit there and blow people's brains out at point-blank range of their
[04:05.160 --> 04:09.760]  order to because they've been trained to instinctively shoot someone who's not
[04:09.760 --> 04:15.560]  been trained to be a killer has a lot of trouble unless you're basically
[04:15.560 --> 04:19.040]  protecting yourself then a lot of people don't have trouble so that could also be
[04:19.040 --> 04:23.720]  the psychology but he was a big supporter and big fan on his website of media
[04:23.720 --> 04:27.600]  matters who's always trying to imply that I'm calling for violence that I want
[04:27.600 --> 04:32.560]  violence when it's the complete opposite so George Soros funded media matters this
[04:32.560 --> 04:36.560]  guy I reportedly have Paul Watson as an article about it at prison planet comm
[04:36.560 --> 04:40.880]  it's also up on info wars dot com when Americans lose everything they start to
[04:40.880 --> 04:44.520]  lose it that's the article we're gonna play the video on the audio coming up in
[04:44.520 --> 04:48.560]  the next segment we've got Lindsay Williams his mr. Rex oil company

[04:52.440 --> 04:56.880]  allowed to talk about previously because mr. X has officially died of cancer

[07:55.400 --> 07:57.920]  Alex
[08:00.880 --> 08:06.680]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[08:06.680 --> 08:13.240]  war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[08:19.320 --> 08:26.560]  when people lose everything they lose it well that wasn't really the case during
[08:26.560 --> 08:31.520]  the decade-long engineered great depression upwards of 90% of the
[08:31.520 --> 08:37.040]  population and I know I hammer this point home a lot was rural and was
[08:37.040 --> 08:41.680]  somewhat self-sufficient or completely self-sufficient they knew how to skin a
[08:41.680 --> 08:46.760]  buck run a trot line how to grow corn how to grow wheat how to grow vegetables
[08:46.760 --> 08:51.960]  in the backyard they knew how to hunt squirrels and white-tailed deer and elk
[08:51.960 --> 08:57.200]  they knew how to eat possums and let me tell you something where my family's
[08:57.200 --> 09:01.160]  from on my dad's side in East Texas all those old World War two vets that I
[09:01.160 --> 09:04.520]  went deer hunting with every year that hunted on our property they're all dead
[09:04.520 --> 09:08.960]  now great guy so actually I think one of them still alive they would tell stories
[09:08.960 --> 09:13.000]  about the Great Depression and how there were almost no deer left no squirrels
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.400]  left no rabbits left hardly any quail or dove and people were hunting out a
[09:17.400 --> 09:23.680]  season 24 7 because that was their grocery store that was their grocery
[09:23.680 --> 09:28.280]  store people make fun of all those hillbillies they'll eat a possum they'll
[09:28.280 --> 09:33.680]  eat a raccoon they'll eat an armadilla well that's because they had food on the
[09:33.680 --> 09:39.320]  table every night major universities have estimated that seven million people
[09:39.320 --> 09:45.880]  died of starvation or from illnesses relating to their malnutrition during
[09:45.880 --> 09:51.680]  the decade-long Great Depression that's what 700,000 people or so every year
[09:51.680 --> 09:57.080]  dying of starvation related illnesses during that decade-long depression and
[09:57.080 --> 10:03.200]  that's with a population that 90% of them lived in rural areas now today the
[10:03.200 --> 10:08.800]  numbers are exactly reversed right at 90% are urban of the 10% that live in
[10:08.800 --> 10:19.360]  rural areas only half of them are self-sufficient 5% versus 90% of this
[10:19.360 --> 10:25.160]  country is self-sufficient I've got a couple years store of food I've talked
[10:25.160 --> 10:29.320]  about on the radio if society collapses the government's gonna come confiscate
[10:29.320 --> 10:34.920]  that but at least I'm trying at least I try to have a garden the issue is the
[10:34.920 --> 10:39.880]  globalist have done this to Argentina to Brazil they've done it to hundreds and
[10:39.880 --> 10:44.160]  hundreds of other countries in Africa Asia Eastern Europe don't think for a
[10:44.160 --> 10:49.920]  minute they won't pull this on us to consolidate power and to train us how to
[10:49.920 --> 10:54.200]  submit to them now what did Gerald Salente say here yesterday he said this
[10:54.200 --> 10:58.960]  is gonna be the year of off with their heads and it's gonna be the year of when
[10:58.960 --> 11:07.040]  people lose everything they lose it now most of these videos and audio we're
[11:07.040 --> 11:11.240]  about to play have profanity we've cut most of it out there's a mild you know
[11:11.240 --> 11:15.320]  stuff but this is this is news this is happening and if you're watching it on
[11:15.320 --> 11:18.400]  you know prison planet on TV and don't want to see somebody getting shot and
[11:18.400 --> 11:22.640]  then turn away but they but you notice people don't get upset by all the
[11:22.640 --> 11:26.600]  violence on TV that simulated when they see real stuff it's upsetting and it
[11:26.600 --> 11:32.080]  should be upsetting but the issue here is there's a lot of different facets to
[11:32.080 --> 11:36.880]  this but you've got the school board lady coming up behind him with her bag
[11:36.880 --> 11:43.920]  hitting him in the back of the head first he goes up and sprays V for vendetta on
[11:43.920 --> 11:48.920]  the wall which is kind of a liberal style revolution movie mainly about I
[11:48.920 --> 11:54.040]  guess rebellion of gay people against oppression or whatever but and it's a
[11:54.040 --> 11:58.400]  surveillance state and the Wachowski brothers who made the matrix basically
[11:58.400 --> 12:02.840]  put it out so he sprays V for vendetta are they gonna call to ban the movie
[12:02.840 --> 12:08.480]  V for vendetta because the this guy was touched by it you see there's real
[12:08.480 --> 12:13.640]  tyranny going on real oppression but this poor guy wasn't given real avenues
[12:13.640 --> 12:18.440]  to take his country back he was a big fan of media matters and George Soros
[12:18.440 --> 12:23.880]  you know he's a liberal basically but you better believe the Southern
[12:23.880 --> 12:27.640]  Poverty Law Center the ADL right now I've got his computer and if he ever
[12:27.640 --> 12:31.680]  visited info wars.com or prisonplanet.com they're gonna say it's my fault
[12:31.680 --> 12:36.000]  even though Paul Watson's gone to his websites and blogs and where the guy
[12:36.000 --> 12:42.120]  posted and he appears to be a liberal and I'm not saying liberals you know are
[12:42.120 --> 12:46.960]  inherently evil or they deserve to have their speech shut down it's just you
[12:46.960 --> 12:51.240]  know there's gonna be this angle this push and as there's more people going
[12:51.240 --> 12:56.000]  postal and his wife work for the government work for the school district
[12:56.000 --> 13:02.480]  and he'd been kicked off his government unemployment insurance and again I'm
[13:02.480 --> 13:05.560]  against socialism and dependency because it causes things like this where
[13:05.560 --> 13:10.600]  people don't know how to skin a buck or run a trot line but at least that
[13:10.600 --> 13:15.200]  stimulus money at least goes back to the people and they go out and buy things
[13:15.200 --> 13:20.760]  that's better than tens of trillions going offshore to shadowy banks so this
[13:20.760 --> 13:25.040]  is a very very sophisticated issue but then you've got the point of a woman
[13:25.040 --> 13:29.080]  charging in we see this so often old ladies are you know fighting off
[13:29.080 --> 13:33.440]  attackers with umbrellas or with their cane here comes the old lady looks like
[13:33.440 --> 13:39.720]  she's about 69 70 71 years old she comes up and hits him with a big old coach
[13:39.720 --> 13:45.400]  bag that probably felt like a you know pillow fight when you were eight years old
[13:45.400 --> 13:47.880]  and he just turns around and knocks her to the ground he looks like he weighs
[13:47.880 --> 13:56.160]  about 350 pounds he's a big guy and if the issue is that woman should have had
[13:56.160 --> 14:02.400]  a revolver in her purse and she should have walked up and shot him in the back
[14:02.400 --> 14:10.640]  now I'm not a macho guy I'm not waving guns around but I do and I have on air
[14:10.640 --> 14:14.200]  showed people the fact that if somebody came in here and started shooting there
[14:14.200 --> 14:17.600]  are multiple people with concealed carries I don't have a concealed carry
[14:17.600 --> 14:23.840]  it's my office my operation I've got a 357 Magnum with seven shots in it right
[14:23.840 --> 14:28.080]  here sure I could have a gun with 40 rounds in it but I like the safety of a
[14:28.080 --> 14:32.960]  revolver that under stress it's easy to use doesn't you know jam compared to
[14:32.960 --> 14:37.360]  other type firearms I've got a reliable firearm right here and if somebody ever
[14:37.360 --> 14:40.600]  tries something like that I will just cold-bloodedly get up against the side
[14:40.600 --> 14:43.440]  of the wall wait for him to come along and I will shoot them in the back I
[14:43.440 --> 14:49.160]  won't macho stand out like a gun slinger I will maybe get on the floor and wait
[14:49.160 --> 14:54.200]  for him and I'm gonna shoot him you come to my house I'm gonna shoot you try to
[14:54.200 --> 14:59.480]  break in my house you're dead okay we and more guns less crime is the answer
[14:59.480 --> 15:04.440]  we're an armed society we've got a bunch of spoiled brats in this country who
[15:04.440 --> 15:08.360]  don't know how to take care of themselves and who are flipping out and
[15:08.360 --> 15:11.760]  who expect everything for free you saw what happened on Black Friday a few
[15:11.760 --> 15:17.080]  weeks ago with people stampeding each other going crazy fighting over you
[15:17.080 --> 15:23.640]  know discounts because there was no sales tax that day this country and and
[15:23.640 --> 15:28.280]  myself included to a certain extent I mean it's all by degrees is extremely
[15:28.280 --> 15:36.640]  decadent and slovenly and it's a time bomb but the military's done
[15:36.640 --> 15:41.240]  actuaries and societal studies on it so has homeless curie they know full well
[15:41.240 --> 15:46.200]  as things break down the police just like in Katrina or just like in the LA
[15:46.200 --> 15:51.120]  riots or any other big event they're gonna sit down the road the firemen who
[15:51.120 --> 15:56.040]  are the heroes are gonna come in and get shot at by the scum and then the
[15:56.040 --> 16:00.600]  police are gonna come and try to arrest Korean shopkeepers it doesn't matter
[16:00.600 --> 16:04.440]  who try to protect their property but a big crowd comes down the road wanting
[16:04.440 --> 16:07.120]  to burn down my neighborhood I'm gonna go out and shoot them all I mean it's
[16:07.120 --> 16:10.520]  real simple you start coming towards my family where my wife and kids are at
[16:10.520 --> 16:14.000]  with torches and you're setting stuff on fire I'm gonna get into prone position
[16:14.000 --> 16:18.800]  with a tripod a 308 rifle with a backpack full of 30 round magazines and
[16:18.800 --> 16:23.360]  I'm gonna take you out you see that's the answer here I'm not looking for a
[16:23.360 --> 16:27.280]  fight but I'm here to tell people every one of those people on that school board
[16:27.280 --> 16:32.520]  should have had a gun and not been victims okay and the minute that guy
[16:32.520 --> 16:36.720]  pulled a gun out and was pointing it at somebody else you just calmly reach up

[24:09.480 --> 24:14.800]  on liberal sites conservative sites thank heavens it hasn't come out he was on
[24:14.800 --> 24:18.720]  my sites yet but info wars dot com and prison blood.com are huge but this is
[24:18.720 --> 24:22.740]  this guilt by association are they gonna blame V for vendetta and the
[24:22.740 --> 24:29.080]  Wachowski brothers film for him spraying a V on the wall which is just his
[24:29.080 --> 24:35.680]  archetypal image of rebellion if he would have sprayed a revolutionary war
[24:35.680 --> 24:39.440]  flag on the wall would they have you know blamed America for it no these are
[24:39.440 --> 24:46.360]  angry desperate people and here's the article when Americans lose everything
[24:46.360 --> 24:51.520]  they start to lose it falling down gunman opens fire on school board over
[24:51.520 --> 24:55.520]  economic woes as Gerald Solendi is often warned when Americans lose
[24:55.520 --> 24:59.680]  everything they start to lose it and nowhere was this more apparent than in
[24:59.680 --> 25:03.920]  the case of Clay Duke a 56 year old gunman who opened fire on a school board
[25:03.920 --> 25:08.280]  members in protest against his wife being fired and his unemployment benefits
[25:08.280 --> 25:11.960]  running out. Duke spray painted V for vendetta sound on the wall before
[25:11.960 --> 25:16.360]  brandishing a gun and telling everyone apart from the school board members to
[25:16.360 --> 25:21.680]  leave the room. Watch what happened next in the video below the response is to the
[25:21.680 --> 25:25.520]  tragic series of events from both the establishment left and the establishment
[25:25.520 --> 25:29.880]  right will undoubtedly be to try and portray Duke as a nutcase conspiracy
[25:29.880 --> 25:34.480]  theorist whose views are an example of wise free speech on the internet needs to
[25:34.480 --> 25:39.480]  be curtailed despite the fact that both on his Facebook page another website he
[25:39.480 --> 25:43.960]  recommended Duke promoted websites from across the political spectrum including
[25:43.960 --> 25:48.600]  media matters who are usually the first to exploit tragic events like those to
[25:48.600 --> 25:53.520]  sling mud and their political adversaries and I've called Watson up he says he saw
[25:53.520 --> 25:57.240]  some of those he's gonna link to those and to some of the other scans and I've
[25:57.240 --> 26:01.960]  got some of the reported comments by this guy it looks more like he was
[26:01.960 --> 26:06.120]  against the entire system like most Americans are it's come out today
[26:06.120 --> 26:10.600]  Congress has the lowest approval rating ever reported by Gallup poll they want
[26:10.600 --> 26:14.040]  to divide us into Republicans and Democrats Limbaugh divides us into
[26:14.040 --> 26:17.680]  Republicans media matters and others into Democrats that have us fight with
[26:17.680 --> 26:21.600]  each other when it's the ruling class robbing the daylights out of us and I
[26:21.600 --> 26:24.600]  want to point out I'm against violence but this guy was going after the wrong
[26:24.600 --> 26:30.640]  target a school board and I got a hand it to the one of the school board members
[26:30.640 --> 26:34.200]  you know saying well I'm the one that did it let the others go I mean that is
[26:34.200 --> 26:39.600]  that is that's the way to do it I mean just really you know good people it
[26:39.600 --> 26:43.120]  appears and and that's what we're made up of in this country we're just
[26:43.120 --> 26:46.640]  compartmentalized to where most people don't see the big picture of what's
[26:46.640 --> 26:51.680]  going on continues here the fact that no one was injured and that Duke
[26:51.680 --> 26:56.160]  ultimately claimed his own life after he'd been shot he shot himself has
[26:56.160 --> 27:00.920]  contributed to him becoming a martyr in the Michael Douglas falling down mold
[27:00.920 --> 27:05.960]  yeah shouldn't be a martyr rather than being considered a deranged lunatic and
[27:05.960 --> 27:10.680]  Facebook pages in his honor are already attracting members Duke was stopped when
[27:10.680 --> 27:15.800]  shots from a security guard named Mike Jones wounded him before he took his own
[27:15.800 --> 27:20.400]  life despite the fact that it was a gun that stopped the rampage time magazine
[27:20.400 --> 27:25.320]  and others are already blaming the tragedy on the second amendment no it
[27:25.320 --> 27:29.680]  was a deranged mind it was a second amendment that's stopping in a de facto
[27:29.680 --> 27:34.440]  online suicide note posted on Facebook Duke railed against the financial
[27:34.440 --> 27:39.920]  terrorist that prompted him to take such a drastic course of action I was just
[27:39.920 --> 27:44.800]  born I was just born poor in a country where the wealthy manipulate use abuse
[27:44.800 --> 27:49.160]  and economically enslaved 90% of the population rich Republicans rich
[27:49.160 --> 27:57.040]  Democrats same same rich they take turns fleecing us no there's a tiny banking
[27:57.040 --> 28:01.320]  elite that's very corrupt and the military industrial complex that
[28:01.320 --> 28:05.040]  manipulate the society it's not the guy down the street that owns a restaurant
[28:05.040 --> 28:10.400]  buddy that's your enemy rich Republicans rich Democrats same same rich they take
[28:10.400 --> 28:15.000]  turns fleecing us our few dollars pyramiding the wealth for themselves he
[28:15.000 --> 28:23.720]  wrote the 95% of the US of a our neo slaves of the global south see that's
[28:23.720 --> 28:28.880]  kind of a liberal thing there our masters the wealthy do as they like to us
[28:28.880 --> 28:33.960]  and it just goes on from there this goes far deeper than someone violently
[28:33.960 --> 28:39.520]  acting upon political grievances Duke's actions were solely guided by his
[28:39.520 --> 28:43.440]  economic woes the fact that his wife had lost her job that the unemployment
[28:43.440 --> 28:47.520]  benefits had run out and that the future offered no hope whatsoever no he'd be
[28:47.520 --> 28:51.480]  homeless this is a future that millions more Americans will have to face in the
[28:51.480 --> 28:56.800]  coming years is the unemployment rate which is really around 20% level
[28:56.800 --> 29:02.000]  continues to accelerate as we warn back in June we are in the early stages of a
[29:02.000 --> 29:06.880]  new age of rage wrote an article about it which will be characterized by riots
[29:06.880 --> 29:10.680]  revolutions and widespread backlash against the economic Holocaust that has
[29:10.680 --> 29:14.640]  been unleashed by the global elite by design or unfortunately there will be
[29:14.640 --> 29:18.360]  many more clay dukes over the coming years there will be more Americans who
[29:18.360 --> 29:24.360]  lose everything and decide that the best way is to simply lose it all together
[29:24.360 --> 29:30.080]  well done Watson on that article but we're again I mean it's clear I've got
[29:30.080 --> 29:33.960]  more quotes here from him he quotes Warren Buffett who was a few weeks ago
[29:33.960 --> 29:39.960]  on this week on ABC sickening people on the red saying you know tax every you

[32:53.360 --> 33:06.640]  com from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[33:06.640 --> 33:25.360]  by the way Paul Watson is beefing up adding more intel to his article when
[33:25.360 --> 33:29.880]  Americans lose everything they start to lose it we've confirmed on his Facebook
[33:29.880 --> 33:37.840]  and other sites that his favorite websites were media matters and other
[33:37.840 --> 33:45.120]  mainstream news but also we are change which of course I helped spawn with
[33:45.120 --> 33:48.960]  Luke Radowski that is all about be the change you want to see in the world
[33:48.960 --> 33:54.440]  nonviolent and on the front page there's a giant image of Mahatma Gandhi and
[33:54.440 --> 34:00.280]  Martin Luther King and you know media matters has been so wicked towards us
[34:00.280 --> 34:05.000]  and and tried to claim that we're calling for violence I that they'll
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.680]  probably just excise out we are change and won't even care and just ignore that
[34:09.680 --> 34:19.320]  they're listed as well just outrageous very very outrageous so I clearly this
[34:19.320 --> 34:29.040]  was a freaked out upset guy who was just at the end of his road and I want to
[34:29.040 --> 34:33.480]  explain this psychological profile for you right now because I discovered this
[34:33.480 --> 34:39.000]  doing research over the last 15 years there was a 2020 special about it in
[34:39.000 --> 34:47.200]  1991 within one year in 1989 of public schools including Littleton, Colorado
[34:47.200 --> 34:53.000]  implementing what is called death education and suicide prevention they
[34:53.000 --> 34:59.440]  teach the kids how you die you get in a simulated coffin it's very bizarre it's
[34:59.440 --> 35:02.880]  it's mind control it's meant to make them depressed and that's come out with a
[35:02.880 --> 35:06.480]  big drug makers they actually put this in the name of making kids not commit
[35:06.480 --> 35:10.840]  suicide but they know then that it introduces to the children the idea of
[35:10.840 --> 35:15.640]  committing suicide and they've had just countless cases where particularly 11
[35:15.640 --> 35:22.080]  12 13 year old girls will hear about this and they'll teach them oh did you know
[35:22.080 --> 35:25.520]  little girls hang themselves with shoelaces or belts and they'll go into
[35:25.520 --> 35:34.560]  the public school bathroom and hang themselves on the coat hanger point
[35:34.560 --> 35:38.640]  that's on the inside of the stall and and you can search this and pull it up
[35:38.640 --> 35:43.920]  school districts nationwide the last five six years have pulled out the coat
[35:43.920 --> 35:49.800]  hanger areas inside the stalls because people were killing themselves mainly
[35:49.800 --> 35:54.520]  little girls then once the little girls say they're depressed because it's been
[35:54.520 --> 35:57.760]  introduced to them that they should be depressed that it's a big you know big
[35:57.760 --> 36:02.520]  drama queen thing then it's trendy for mommy and daddy to put them on Prozac or
[36:02.520 --> 36:07.200]  one of those other variants of serotonin reuptake inhibitors then but it's
[36:07.200 --> 36:13.600]  trendy to put little Johnny on the and Federman class drugs like of course Ritalin
[36:13.600 --> 36:18.880]  Adderall and others that cause the heart to swell the brain to shrink they
[36:18.880 --> 36:23.560]  retard growth they cause brain damage and a parents just sadly go well the
[36:23.560 --> 36:27.520]  school said so and boy my daughter sons a lot better now yeah because they're
[36:27.520 --> 36:31.600]  burnt out you were giving them coke you were giving them sweets they were
[36:31.600 --> 36:36.960]  having sugar crashes they had bad nutrition and so you just burned their
[36:36.960 --> 36:41.440]  brain out I'm sorry if you don't want to hear this this is a fact I've talked to
[36:41.440 --> 36:45.040]  medical doctors nutritionists you name it they've they've done major studies
[36:45.040 --> 36:49.200]  where getting real nutrition and not drinking fluoridated water and not
[36:49.200 --> 36:53.960]  drinking processed you know sugar drinks that are in vending machines all over
[36:53.960 --> 36:58.080]  the schools or chocolate milk like we had in school I remember always like an
[36:58.080 --> 37:01.080]  hour after lunch I got a headache and feel groggy because I was going to eat
[37:01.080 --> 37:07.360]  pizzas to chocolate milks I like salad so I'd go ahead and eat a salad too but
[37:07.360 --> 37:11.520]  well I love that school food you know the mashed potatoes the chicken fried
[37:11.520 --> 37:18.920]  steaks I was in there getting double helpings it's unhealthy but but again
[37:18.920 --> 37:24.360]  I'm trying to cover the whole spectrum of this they introduced the idea of how to
[37:24.360 --> 37:28.960]  commit suicide so now since they introduced death education in the late
[37:28.960 --> 37:33.120]  80s and it's gone nationwide since then you look at the charts for teenage
[37:33.120 --> 37:38.680]  suicide it's just going straight up and it's the same thing with the media
[37:38.680 --> 37:44.400]  advertising and hyping people going postal in the 80s it was always
[37:44.400 --> 37:53.120]  military veterans in almost every case who had lost their their governors to
[37:53.120 --> 37:56.480]  not want to shoot and kill people most of them had been in combat they'd shot
[37:56.480 --> 37:59.840]  and killed people that's how they deal with stress they've been trained to be
[37:59.840 --> 38:06.880]  killers I'm not saying they're bad people and then they go in to work at the
[38:06.880 --> 38:10.160]  government building mainly the post office it's a stressful job they got
[38:10.160 --> 38:15.640]  some boss bossing them around make some angry they don't go commit suicide or
[38:15.640 --> 38:18.960]  they don't go sell their house and you know go moving with family or go you
[38:18.960 --> 38:23.120]  know travel the country or whatever as they should just enjoy life even they
[38:23.120 --> 38:27.880]  become homeless they go in and they shoot their boss and they shoot a couple
[38:27.880 --> 38:35.840]  other co-workers the media hypes it up they play it up they constantly put
[38:35.840 --> 38:40.520]  that idea out there they have all these drills for mass shooters all over the
[38:40.520 --> 38:47.600]  place introducing the idea and then it begins to happen so there's also that
[38:47.600 --> 38:53.000]  facet to all of this but I wanted to get in to some more of the points that
[38:53.000 --> 39:00.320]  I made dealing with this when Americans lose everything they start to lose it
[39:00.320 --> 39:04.640]  and I wrote some notes here number one Mike Jones the security guard did his
[39:04.640 --> 39:11.240]  job he's a hero he went in there fired one time and shot mr. Duke mr. Duke fell
[39:11.240 --> 39:14.720]  to the ground realize what was happening that he was about to go to prison for
[39:14.720 --> 39:20.240]  life and killed himself showing what a desperate person he was we don't know if
[39:20.240 --> 39:26.400]  Duke again didn't want to kill people and so was aiming above him or beside them
[39:26.400 --> 39:30.280]  which is common if you're not a trained killer who's been you know trained
[39:30.280 --> 39:34.240]  instinctively kill and not think like the police are with instinctive shooting
[39:34.240 --> 39:39.440]  and the military we have the whole issue of the second amendment stopped this
[39:39.440 --> 39:45.240]  guy and I've made the point you come in my house my business my car you know some
[39:45.240 --> 39:49.040]  there was some nuts shooting people next door I'd go out there and deal with
[39:49.040 --> 39:55.560]  them because that's how we respond to this you don't respond by disarming or
[39:55.560 --> 39:58.960]  trying to disarm people because a nuts always going to be able to get a gun a
[39:58.960 --> 40:02.760]  nut could walk up and hit a cop on the head with a baseball bat and take their
[40:02.760 --> 40:07.960]  gun away from them then the nanny states answer is RFID and all the guns and then
[40:07.960 --> 40:11.640]  they want to ban steak knives in England because people are stabbing people no
[40:11.640 --> 40:16.200]  it's the human mind that's the issue not the car that can be used as a weapon
[40:16.200 --> 40:22.960]  or the aeroplane it's the human mind it's the individual again I make the
[40:22.960 --> 40:27.520]  point that I'm totally against what happened here this is horrible they
[40:27.520 --> 40:32.160]  will use this to clamp down on everybody this is not the response we need but if
[40:32.160 --> 40:35.920]  he's gonna go after the government why the school board well they fired his
[40:35.920 --> 40:43.520]  wife you know they're laying people off for whatever reason so that's why he
[40:43.520 --> 40:51.440]  went there but if he's writing in his Facebook blogs and other places my
[40:51.440 --> 40:55.360]  testament some people the government-sponsored media which it is
[40:55.360 --> 41:01.440]  will say I was an evil monster no I was just born poor in a country where the
[41:01.440 --> 41:06.120]  wealthy manipulate use abuse and economically enslaved 95% of the
[41:06.120 --> 41:12.680]  population rich Republicans rich Democrats same same rich they take turns
[41:12.680 --> 41:17.360]  fleecing us are few dollars pyramiding the wealth for themselves the 95% of us
[41:17.360 --> 41:24.280]  in the US of a are the neo slaves of the global south our masters the wealthy do
[41:24.280 --> 41:28.520]  as they like to us and then he quotes Warren Buffett who skillfully plays
[41:28.520 --> 41:33.720]  class warfare the very you know top of the pyramid you know a guy worth hundreds
[41:33.720 --> 41:37.800]  of billions of dollars he claims it's 40 something billion he puts his billions
[41:37.800 --> 41:43.640]  in attacks free operations and tells you it's it's it's philanthropy something
[41:43.640 --> 41:52.600]  the Rockefellers invented philanthropy is not charity totally different and it
[41:52.600 --> 41:58.280]  continues there's class warfare all right but it's my class the rich class
[41:58.280 --> 42:03.760]  that's making war and we're winning Warren Buffett so he quotes Warren Buffett
[42:03.760 --> 42:10.200]  he goes on rise like lions at the slumber in unvanquishable number shake
[42:10.200 --> 42:17.720]  your change to earth like do which in sleep has fallen on you you are many
[42:17.720 --> 42:24.000]  they are few so V for vendetta the image of people marching in mass past the
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.840]  corrupt military and taking down the bankers who were surveilling everyone
[42:28.840 --> 42:33.800]  and propagandizing and the government's running the dominant media it's the
[42:33.800 --> 42:37.720]  corruption that makes V for vendetta so powerful because it's telling a true
[42:37.720 --> 42:42.280]  story about oppression on so many levels it is the bank stealing trillions and
[42:42.280 --> 42:45.920]  robbing the nation and they haven't even gotten done we're a year or two behind
[42:45.920 --> 42:50.960]  Ireland and Greece and others it's just now getting ready to come here crime is
[42:50.960 --> 42:56.120]  exploding I mean I've got stacks of news here where it's just expanding police
[42:56.120 --> 43:00.600]  departments and sheriff's departments are laying off in some cases 60% of their
[43:00.600 --> 43:07.320]  deputies are police and announcing they're only going to respond they're
[43:07.320 --> 43:16.520]  only going to respond to things like shootings and that they're the rest of
[43:16.520 --> 43:22.040]  the time going to be out there engaged in revenue generation well I discovered
[43:22.040 --> 43:28.760]  that 15 years ago my car got stolen Dallas I discovered that I had a
[43:28.760 --> 43:32.200]  girlfriend up there as I grew up in Dallas and I had a old sweetheart I
[43:32.200 --> 43:35.800]  used to go visit and then my car got stolen the second time and she lived in
[43:35.800 --> 43:40.800]  a middle-class area and wasn't even that nice of a car stolen twice cops wouldn't
[43:40.800 --> 43:44.600]  come second time I guess it happened like 16 years ago then about a year
[43:44.600 --> 43:50.320]  later 15 years ago made them in 17 years ago and then 16 years ago you know
[43:50.320 --> 43:56.920]  they got a show yet the point is I'm up in Dallas visiting with her and they
[43:56.920 --> 44:01.880]  steal my car twice and the second time the police said well we're not going to
[44:01.880 --> 44:05.720]  help you and it might show up at an impound yard and I said okay and hung up
[44:05.720 --> 44:10.520]  cops show up arrogantly forced their way into the apartment looking around for
[44:10.520 --> 44:17.960]  you know drugs or whatever and tell me you don't hang up on 9-11 okay on 9-1-1
[44:17.960 --> 44:22.520]  you don't hang up so it's the old joke of like a third-world country don't call
[44:22.520 --> 44:25.160]  the police for something because they'll end up just shaking you down we're
[44:25.160 --> 44:29.720]  becoming a third-world country take the Dallas police they got caught what five
[44:29.720 --> 44:33.840]  years ago framing thousands of people they just randomly pull over a nice car
[44:33.840 --> 44:40.000]  throw a bag of cocaine in the back on record then they got lazy because it was
[44:40.000 --> 44:43.040]  hard to get cocaine out of the evidence locker they just throw a chalk in the
[44:43.040 --> 44:46.840]  back of your car they took sheetrock and busted it up and they just take your
[44:46.840 --> 44:52.640]  car go take your house and you know I was listening to the news yesterday in
[44:52.640 --> 44:58.120]  Austin and a cop ran a red light excuse me a stop sign and hit a guy on a
[44:58.120 --> 45:02.200]  motorcycle and the police was saying well motorcycles aren't safe it's your
[45:02.200 --> 45:07.280]  fault you lost your leg and the callers were calling in to 590 and Jeff Ward the
[45:07.280 --> 45:10.480]  local host was blown away going you guys are defending the police they're like
[45:10.480 --> 45:15.200]  yes it's you know police can do no wrong it's like a mental illness or
[45:15.200 --> 45:19.800]  something when you start saying police can do no wrong that allows the criminals
[45:19.800 --> 45:24.920]  to take it over they've turned this this this government worship into a
[45:24.920 --> 45:29.360]  religion so the government is completely out of control and they're getting
[45:29.360 --> 45:33.240]  ready to start laying off most the state level government people and they're
[45:33.240 --> 45:37.360]  gonna be going postal and then the government's gonna go in you know it
[45:37.360 --> 45:41.040]  turned out Richard Poplowski who shot and killed three cops in Pittsburgh a
[45:41.040 --> 45:47.520]  year and a half ago he was a Fox News fan CNN visited that visited Glen Beck was
[45:47.520 --> 45:51.400]  was really a Nazi visited all the big Nazi sites and posted how much he loved
[45:51.400 --> 45:56.800]  them posted on those sites and my sights how much he hated me within two
[45:56.800 --> 46:01.040]  hours of him being arrested after killing three cops at his house his
[46:01.040 --> 46:05.480]  mommy's house the Marines trained him how to kill by the way but not blaming
[46:05.480 --> 46:08.000]  them that's just you know you want to point the finger that's the instinct of
[46:08.000 --> 46:12.400]  killing he thought it was a video game you know pop goes the weasel three times
[46:12.400 --> 46:16.440]  in a row three men he killed in cold blood he responded to his mommy calling
[46:16.440 --> 46:19.360]  to throw him out because his pit bulls were defecating all over the floor
[46:19.360 --> 46:26.400]  spoiled brat within two hours of him in custody headline Alex Jones told him to
[46:26.400 --> 46:31.000]  do it Alex Jones and I made five newspapers retract and then we got his
[46:31.000 --> 46:36.160]  quotes he was a white supremacist who hated me doesn't matter to the Southern
[46:36.160 --> 46:40.400]  Poverty Law Center and ADL controlled newspapers in that city they got into
[46:40.400 --> 46:46.120]  those computers they found he visited my websites and it was my fault and they're
[46:46.120 --> 46:51.200]  going to continue to do that they're going to continue they're not going to
[46:51.200 --> 46:56.240]  stop now this guy recommended his favorite websites media matters along
[46:56.240 --> 47:01.880]  with we are change and you know and and and V for vendetta it's not media
[47:01.880 --> 47:07.600]  matters fall it's not we are change fault it's not V for vendetta's fault it's
[47:07.600 --> 47:13.680]  the fault of this overall out of control culture that he was domesticated that he
[47:13.680 --> 47:17.440]  didn't have strong family that he didn't have people to stick together with but
[47:17.440 --> 47:21.840]  that wasn't his fault that's a nature of this advanced civilization that it's
[47:21.840 --> 47:26.320]  turned us basically into like domesticated animals that don't even
[47:26.320 --> 47:30.440]  know how to forage for ourselves now there's some other facets to all of this
[47:30.440 --> 47:40.520]  too that I want to hit on but at the end of the day the largest point I want to
[47:40.520 --> 47:47.120]  make is that we're sitting on top of a powder keg and the system 11 years ago
[47:47.120 --> 47:51.680]  when they got rid of Glass-Steagall and allow the trillions of derivatives to be
[47:51.680 --> 47:57.000]  created that are impossible to pay back on record the Rand Corporation I read
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.640]  the reports on there at the time they were even in the news is how I learned
[47:59.640 --> 48:03.320]  about it saying we're gonna our society is gonna change troops are gonna be on
[48:03.320 --> 48:08.480]  the street our new economy is gonna be surveillance and we're gonna have one
[48:08.480 --> 48:12.840]  child policies and America is gonna implode and because of economic
[48:12.840 --> 48:20.520]  degradation we're gonna have a totally authoritarian society and now the middle
[48:20.520 --> 48:26.200]  class as crime explodes as the shootings explode as the problems expand as people
[48:26.200 --> 48:30.800]  get desperate they're going to offer homeland security and the threat fusion
[48:30.800 --> 48:34.320]  centers and that if you see something say something that's designed to make you
[48:34.320 --> 48:38.440]  not trust your neighbors even more we should all be coming together to help
[48:38.440 --> 48:42.280]  each other we should all be coming together to also politically get together
[48:42.280 --> 48:46.440]  and instead of going and shooting a cop down the street or shooting somebody at
[48:46.440 --> 48:51.640]  a school board meeting well no we should be getting together with grand juries and
[48:51.640 --> 48:55.360]  and taking back our legislatures and kicking out the electronic voting
[48:55.360 --> 48:59.120]  machines and taking Congress back Congress now has the lowest approval
[48:59.120 --> 49:07.400]  rating in its history we should be doing that we should be taking our system
[49:07.400 --> 49:11.160]  back and pointing out it's the mega central banks that have created a debt
[49:11.160 --> 49:16.600]  black hole and fostered and financed carbon tax moves to fund themselves and
[49:16.600 --> 49:21.360]  shut down the real economy who have financed all the federalization moves
[49:21.360 --> 49:27.320]  worldwide so they can centralize control this is the system that we're facing and
[49:27.320 --> 49:32.000]  dealing with and it's us or them it's in the IMF World Bank documents that got
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.280]  leaked in 2002 it's in the last chapter in my out-of-print book it's online at

[53:54.720 --> 54:01.040]  seeds are the ultimate barter item this is alex jones for survivalseedbank.com
[54:01.040 --> 54:25.040]  okay you know about a month ago Lindsey Williams revealed who mr. X was former
[54:25.040 --> 54:29.240]  head of operations for Atlantic Richfield he has unfortunately died of the
[54:29.240 --> 54:36.840]  cancer and he's going to be joining us coming up to about 35 minutes I don't
[54:36.840 --> 54:47.800]  want to get too much into this but we have a white hack a white hat hacker who
[54:47.800 --> 54:54.280]  goes by Winston Smith of federaljack.com he's associated with that great we
[54:54.280 --> 54:58.720]  are change type spinoff down in Florida also expanding across the country
[54:58.720 --> 55:05.720]  they do great work and he's an amazing hacker and I'm just gonna leave it at
[55:05.720 --> 55:10.320]  that I mean he has sat there in real time and shut down major websites right in
[55:10.320 --> 55:14.080]  front of me like watch I'll turn this major website off for two minutes now
[55:14.080 --> 55:20.800]  just turn it off okay I'll just leave it at that I probably shouldn't even look
[55:20.800 --> 55:30.120]  the issue here is the the issue here is that he concurs with my analysis of
[55:30.120 --> 55:38.520]  what's going on with anonymous and the attacks on WikiLeaks and that it is a
[55:38.520 --> 55:42.200]  government infiltration operation if they are on the major hacking sites
[55:42.200 --> 55:48.560]  trying to recruit people to attack news outlets credit card companies as the
[55:48.560 --> 55:54.160]  pretext to bring in the homeland security takeover of the internet which
[55:54.160 --> 55:59.600]  they're openly announcing and this just came in when I was in England five years
[55:59.600 --> 56:04.960]  ago I was there three days before they banned protesting within several miles
[56:04.960 --> 56:09.080]  of parliament and the cops came over and said well it's gonna be banned later in
[56:09.080 --> 56:13.120]  the week they've passed the law but it isn't in effect yet but go ahead and
[56:13.120 --> 56:16.040]  turn your bullhorn off and get out of here we don't care of it in the law
[56:16.040 --> 56:25.040]  we're gonna arrest you and that's in Terror Storm but police mole banning all
[56:25.040 --> 56:30.080]  UK protest oh see I remember it came out a few years ago that the entire
[56:30.080 --> 56:34.800]  parliament is spied on by MI5 and MI6 the parliament is supposedly the
[56:34.800 --> 56:38.080]  government but you've got the intelligence agencies you've got the
[56:38.080 --> 56:44.480]  security services I mean England is becoming like Venezuela they announced
[56:44.480 --> 56:49.720]  today that Hugo Chavez is gonna rule by decree what does Obama do they pass
[56:49.720 --> 56:54.320]  health care and then he rules by decree and says these 500 plus major
[56:54.320 --> 56:59.160]  businesses are exempt but everybody else has got to pay it that goes on long
[56:59.160 --> 57:04.080]  they'll only be government approved corporations that's how royalty always
[57:04.080 --> 57:09.640]  operated you had to have the seal as an approved operation to have a shipping
[57:09.640 --> 57:18.400]  company or to brew beer or to grow wheat this is a planned economy this is
[57:18.400 --> 57:22.400]  what they admit they're building and look at this article this is how to press
[57:22.400 --> 57:27.880]  TV police mole banning all UK protest the British police chief says he's
[57:27.880 --> 57:32.920]  weighing up an option to ask the Home Secretary to enforce a ban on any future
[57:32.920 --> 57:39.120]  protest gatherings all together across the UK see as I said five years ago it's
[57:39.120 --> 57:47.800]  the parliament area today all of England Amara the world next week tens of

[1:00:40.160 --> 1:00:44.600]  want to imply he did something wrong we authorized him to run attacks against
[1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:49.600]  our sites to show us all the problems and vulnerabilities and it's just
[1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:54.960]  amazing and I know some people that know him he's really a security consultant
[1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:59.640]  but you could call him a hacker a white hat hacker and he concurs with my
[1:00:59.640 --> 1:01:06.200]  analysis and the government is out there openly recruiting on the hacker sites to
[1:01:06.200 --> 1:01:11.240]  try to attack patriot groups and organizations and obviously yours truly
[1:01:11.240 --> 1:01:16.440]  and they've you know the issue is that this is an attack against free speech

[1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:05.760]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet
[1:07:05.760 --> 1:07:09.160]  many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has
[1:07:09.160 --> 1:07:14.000]  been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:17.560]  name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator
[1:07:17.560 --> 1:07:21.840]  not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic
[1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:25.720]  silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and
[1:07:25.720 --> 1:07:30.600]  devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas

[1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:33.520]  well we're live ladies and gentlemen eight minutes now into this second hour
[1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:40.260]  of this live December 15th 2010 Wednesday edition and we've got Lindsey
[1:08:40.260 --> 1:08:47.400]  Williams joining us coming up here in about 23 minutes from now his former
[1:08:47.400 --> 1:08:51.840]  oil company executive source has died he's already revealed his full name here
[1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:56.200]  on air but now he can give you the full data dump that he was authorized to give
[1:08:56.200 --> 1:09:02.200]  you after Mr. X died and that's now happened so we'll give you again for
[1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:07.800]  those that don't know his full name and exactly what Lindsey Williams is able to
[1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:13.080]  tell us now because he worked for many years with the head of operations for
[1:09:13.080 --> 1:09:18.840]  Atlantic Richfield and he's now able to talk about that and what this insider
[1:09:18.840 --> 1:09:22.920]  said the globalists were planning now it's very evident they're accelerating
[1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:27.200]  global collapse to destroy all the major economies and currencies and set up
[1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:33.240]  their new SDR based on carbon taxes and global VAT they are slashing pension
[1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:38.160]  funds military medical treatment they are going after the most outrageous
[1:09:38.160 --> 1:09:42.600]  things first because if they can take veterans health care they can do
[1:09:42.600 --> 1:09:47.720]  anything Europe the United States taxing pension funds taking pension funds
[1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:52.560]  it's all happening they're openly talking about shutting down free speech on
[1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:57.240]  the web tracking everyone here in the United States Australia has announced
[1:09:57.240 --> 1:10:01.640]  it headline Australia to implement Chinese style net censorship again
[1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:06.040]  they're just thrown at your face going all the way now and it's being reported
[1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:14.320]  all over UK news very dryly they have the UK Metropolitan Police Commissioner
[1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:19.960]  being quoted as saying police mulling banning all UK protest and Watson's
[1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:23.320]  getting an article out with a proper headline when you hear about Indonesia
[1:10:23.320 --> 1:10:30.240]  going under martial law or Nigeria or you know Venezuela it's always protester
[1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:35.000]  banned and then there's curfews and you notice in towns all over the US they
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:39.800]  now have curfews even in the daytime in Arkansas and weird places that you
[1:10:39.800 --> 1:10:42.760]  wouldn't expect it fact people don't believe it just type Arkansas town has
[1:10:42.760 --> 1:10:51.800]  daytime curfew you know clover port Kentucky daytime nighttime curfews
[1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:55.920]  off and on in the past they're just training you to line up have the
[1:10:55.920 --> 1:10:58.920]  government put their hands down your pants they've now announced first it
[1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:04.840]  was 800 Walmart's now 9,000 retail stores to have giant telescreens see a
[1:11:04.840 --> 1:11:10.280]  week ago it's 800 a week later it's 9,000 a month later it's gonna be a
[1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:15.520]  hundred thousand every license plate in California they're announcing is gonna
[1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:19.520]  have a computer screen as a license plate giving you messages and orders and
[1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:24.560]  tracking you I mean they are rolling out a hellish takeover the same retina
[1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:29.320]  scanning thumbprinting they do to people in Fallujah or Afghanistan or Iraq it's
[1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:34.440]  coming here total control grid they got the threat fusion center CIA run here in
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:38.720]  Austin I knew they had it in six seven years ago license plate reading face
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:43.440]  scanning they now announced on the news they've got microphones the feds have
[1:11:43.440 --> 1:11:46.840]  got microphones mounted on poles everywhere that it hundreds of yards
[1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:50.280]  away shoot a laser that you can't even see at your window they get full
[1:11:50.280 --> 1:11:55.840]  acoustic audio inside your house with that laser a coupling I mean it is just a
[1:11:55.840 --> 1:12:00.800]  hell grid and they've built this giant overarching system they've got all their
[1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:05.360]  weapons and control and spies aimed and now they're rolling out yeah
[1:12:05.360 --> 1:12:10.200]  censorship is good banning protests is good free speech zones yeah your
[1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:15.640]  neighbors need to spy on you don't trust other shoppers only trust the
[1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:21.560]  government now for the for the next 20 minutes or so we are joined by Winston
[1:12:21.560 --> 1:12:28.680]  Smith and he works some with federal jack.com I'd call it kind of a spin-off
[1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:33.560]  but just as effective and great as we are change do a lot of great you know
[1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:38.800]  confronting Al Gore, George W. Bush, other globalists just amazing patriots
[1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:43.400]  exposing the global warming fraud you name it and he joins us because he
[1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:48.040]  concurs with my analysis and he's seeing it now in the hacker community and this
[1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:52.920]  guy's good folks he's very good he's a he's really a security consultant aka
[1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:57.920]  white hat hacker and so Winston Smith it's good to have you here tell folks
[1:12:57.920 --> 1:13:03.360]  your intel on what they're planning and how they're using all of this hacking
[1:13:03.360 --> 1:13:08.760]  to try to pass their internet kill switch thanks for having me on well
[1:13:08.760 --> 1:13:14.480]  basically the the group anonymous itself it's not it's not a government
[1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:19.560]  operation it's not run by the government it's just basically citizens on the
[1:13:19.560 --> 1:13:23.880]  internet there's there's not really controlled or run by anyone but because
[1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:29.160]  it's so decentralized like that anyone can jump on and and make suggestions and
[1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:32.640]  basically stand the flames in whatever direction they want so there are there
[1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:37.840]  definitely operatives within within the anonymous community and they're all
[1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:40.920]  there and they're definitely on their fanning the flames to promote
[1:13:40.920 --> 1:13:46.000]  infrastructure attacks and Nila service attacks on on financial systems and
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:52.040]  other systems that end up affecting on average people that the power
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:54.960]  that be they don't really they're not really too concerned about they'll
[1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:58.000]  they'll lose service for a bit but then they'll come right back on with
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:02.480]  everyone gets tired and this is the false flag on the web that I
[1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:07.680]  been predicting yes the reason they're the reason they're doing that is they
[1:14:07.680 --> 1:14:12.400]  want to they want to implement the government IDF sensors in front of
[1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:16.080]  things that they deem critical infrastructure of Google's already
[1:14:16.080 --> 1:14:21.400]  deployed in Einstein does their pillar system and the Einstein IDF was
[1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:24.680]  developed by the NSA and they're they're really pushing that to have that put
[1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:28.280]  in front of all in front of a private business networks that are deemed
[1:14:28.280 --> 1:14:32.160]  critical infrastructure so that's the whole homeland security takeover with
[1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:36.720]  infraguard clergy response basically everything is critical infrastructure
[1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:43.240]  that's in the homeland security cybersecurity act where any ISP that
[1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:47.360]  has over a hundred customers has to be government approved and have
[1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:53.040]  government snoop hubs in it so it is literally internet to going out and
[1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:57.920]  making companies pay for internet to be put in that's a parallel web to start
[1:14:57.920 --> 1:15:02.480]  absorbing the old internet and tracking everyone is that a correct
[1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:06.920]  statement yes and they're telling it that it's going to protect you from
[1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:10.480]  hackers that on the sensors will be able to look for malicious traffic and
[1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:15.320]  look for attacks and be able to block them at the source and report it but in
[1:15:15.320 --> 1:15:18.680]  reality it's going to be able to do much more than that I'd be able to have a
[1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:21.440]  deep packet inspection or it's gonna be able to pretty much examine all the
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:24.400]  content of what's coming over the wire and they're gonna be looking for
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:28.680]  business communications that's nature of government that's what they do they're
[1:15:28.680 --> 1:15:33.160]  not really interested in protecting anything absolutely that's admitted I
[1:15:33.160 --> 1:15:36.360]  saw two years ago curtain I wrote an article with bizarre statements by
[1:15:36.360 --> 1:15:39.360]  cyber command that's already fully operating they're trying to get
[1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:43.640]  legislative authority now to do it in the open and they said that they were
[1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:49.480]  already attacking themselves and quote attacking enemies of their agenda which
[1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:54.560]  Cass Sunstein and others admit is people like yours truly or anyone who
[1:15:54.560 --> 1:15:59.280]  disagrees with man-made global warming where do you see this going and do you
[1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:06.280]  agree with my analysis that Assange is a patsy they're trying to use him to make
[1:16:06.280 --> 1:16:11.880]  this Cass Sunstein connected George Soros connected movement look legitimate
[1:16:11.880 --> 1:16:17.480]  and that they're basically persecuting him to give a overall cover story to
[1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:24.680]  their larger takeover from what I know about Assange he seems legit and because
[1:16:24.680 --> 1:16:28.640]  because they're going after him so hard and so many different ways he I do
[1:16:28.640 --> 1:16:34.280]  believe he's a he's a legitimate you know researcher he's from the old
[1:16:34.280 --> 1:16:39.080]  school hacker ethos from back in the they know back in the 90s and ladies from
[1:16:39.080 --> 1:16:45.000]  Australia he's definitely he seems to have the right hacker ethos and the
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:49.160]  way they're the way they're attacking just kind of lends credibility to what
[1:16:49.160 --> 1:16:52.440]  he's doing and but the way that mainstream media is seizing on a lot of
[1:16:52.440 --> 1:16:56.360]  the document dumps and just reporting on stuff that's promoting their their
[1:16:56.360 --> 1:16:59.940]  agenda such as invading Iran and stuff like that I think that since there's
[1:16:59.940 --> 1:17:04.720]  250,000 cables they're just digging through and cherry picking what's
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:08.520]  going to benefit them in order to do damage control but from from what I
[1:17:08.520 --> 1:17:14.640]  can tell Assange does seem to be he does seem to be legit you know there's a
[1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:19.080]  lot of questions I could raise here or or bring up to you but but but clearly
[1:17:19.080 --> 1:17:24.360]  the good news is when you're looking at all the big hacker sites and forums to
[1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:28.680]  paraphrase what you said or correct me if I'm wrong 99% of the time nobody is
[1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:34.040]  biting on joining with these provocateurs to go after alternative media
[1:17:34.040 --> 1:17:41.240]  patriot groups but also a key infrastructure and individuals to create
[1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:47.600]  a pushback and a and a really corporate and grassroots support for do
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:52.880]  something about these hackers you know put a muzzle on the internet right the
[1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:57.480]  the attacks on um but the anything beyond really attacks on the financial
[1:17:57.480 --> 1:18:01.360]  sector aren't really gaining much steam they just not kind of seem to be
[1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:03.940]  puttering out because of the way it works is a post will be made or
[1:18:03.940 --> 1:18:09.000]  suggest will be made and if the and the the group of people who are monitoring
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.760]  at the time or participating at the time don't get behind it the idea just
[1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:15.480]  flutters out so you'll you'll see destructive things being suggested
[1:18:15.480 --> 1:18:18.320]  every now and then but they'll you know thankfully there's so far just
[1:18:18.320 --> 1:18:23.000]  petering out and when they do take place like the attacks on the financial
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:27.120]  industry um they're they're arresting kids and low-hanging fruit on the the
[1:18:27.120 --> 1:18:31.440]  honest uh the groups they're using something called the low-impact ion
[1:18:31.440 --> 1:18:36.720]  low orbit low orbit ion cannon the LOIC and it's basically an opt-in botnet
[1:18:36.720 --> 1:18:40.280]  where you just run it from your computer and it'll start opening opening
[1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:43.200]  connections on a website and they'll get a few thousand people to do this and
[1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:47.280]  it'll take the website down but the program by default doesn't offer any
[1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:51.960]  any proxying support so you get it traces directly back to your computer and
[1:18:51.960 --> 1:18:56.280]  they're arresting 15 to 17 year old kids I think they just arrested a 19 year old
[1:18:56.280 --> 1:19:01.080]  kid who was running the software needle pinning yeah we've seen operatives we've
[1:19:01.080 --> 1:19:05.280]  seen operatives openly on YouTube recruiting people to run these attacks
[1:19:05.280 --> 1:19:09.560]  on info wars and prison planet and we've tracked it back and are pretty sure
[1:19:09.560 --> 1:19:15.600]  that it's homeland security doing it posing as hackers and it's just
[1:19:15.600 --> 1:19:20.280]  ongoing so that's important for people to know that they're just busting a few
[1:19:20.280 --> 1:19:24.800]  kids and not going after you know the really malicious stuff which in every
[1:19:24.800 --> 1:19:28.840]  case we've looked at as a staged event and there's some other
[1:19:28.840 --> 1:19:33.120]  campaigns that uh that different anonymous groups are doing and they
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:36.840]  actually seem to be very uh there's actually productive say they're
[1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:40.760]  encouraging people to to read the WikiLeaks document and actually
[1:19:40.760 --> 1:19:43.960]  I'm sorry that's the music line I can't hear that yeah stay there because you
[1:19:43.960 --> 1:19:47.880]  exactly that's the big news coming up you say there's about to be some real
[1:19:47.880 --> 1:19:52.640]  WikiLeaking going on and instead of just cherry picking really getting into
[1:19:52.640 --> 1:19:56.400]  those documents and getting stuff out there like Dinecore running little kids

[1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:29.520]  minutes in the next segment then get Lindsay Williams on you've got a lot to
[1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:35.480]  say you say the real people involved with anonymous are doing some really
[1:24:35.480 --> 1:24:42.400]  exciting things and there's a lot more to come you've got the floor movement
[1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:45.800]  from some factions of anonymous that are encouraging people to actually read
[1:24:45.800 --> 1:24:49.520]  the WikiLeaks documents and look for stuff that's not being discussed in any
[1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:53.480]  media like the latest thing with the Dinecore sex scandal where there are
[1:24:53.480 --> 1:24:57.200]  seven boys to ask them police forces that was that came out in a Houston
[1:24:57.200 --> 1:25:01.160]  Houston Chronicle blog so and so basically they're encouraging people to
[1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:05.280]  go start coming through the cables there's 250,000 there's gonna be plenty
[1:25:05.280 --> 1:25:08.760]  that mainstream media is not touching and then put up a YouTube video put up a
[1:25:08.760 --> 1:25:13.160]  put up a free blog page right one or two paragraphs about it and then start
[1:25:13.160 --> 1:25:16.600]  spamming it around and then that way the information will go viral because the
[1:25:16.600 --> 1:25:20.480]  new order doesn't really fear 16 year olds doing denial of service attacks
[1:25:20.480 --> 1:25:24.680]  but they do fear the information from those cable leaks getting out and I
[1:25:24.680 --> 1:25:29.680]  also want to put out a call for programmers so I guess contact contact
[1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:35.920]  either federaljack.com or infowars.com directly and we basically want to we
[1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:40.760]  should we put together an opt-in botnet that's similar to the LOIC but that is
[1:25:40.760 --> 1:25:44.320]  not that one it's not destructive so instead of doing denial of service
[1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:48.920]  attacks they do things like do Google searches or update up the upvote YouTube
[1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:54.080]  videos and upvote dig articles and in that way when important information
[1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:59.040]  comes out everyone can dedicate their resources to to getting to make the
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:02.880]  information as viral as possible as possible and with the success of the
[1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:06.200]  Googlebomb campaign that's been going on right now if it could be automated with
[1:26:06.200 --> 1:26:10.040]  some kind of a client software I think they would have a real big impact and
[1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:15.040]  so basically we just we need to you find programmers you can help do that while
[1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:20.600]  expanding on that the globalists are masters of creating the type of fake
[1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:26.000]  revolution they want because they can look at a trend societally of what
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:32.800]  they're doing and know that people are going to resist it so ahead of time they
[1:26:32.800 --> 1:26:36.680]  will go out and frame the debate so they're always promoting hacking that's
[1:26:36.680 --> 1:26:42.480]  just denial of service or things that are destructive to demonize people being
[1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:48.600]  activist with technology so that being an activist with technology is seen as
[1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:53.640]  inherently dirty you go back to the 1940s and 50s with the British this has
[1:26:53.640 --> 1:26:59.600]  been declassified but they use a similar model today in Kenya and the
[1:26:59.600 --> 1:27:03.440]  government wanted to crack down and take over society and so they went and
[1:27:03.440 --> 1:27:09.040]  financed rebel groups and then use those groups as the foggy scary enemy to take
[1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:12.880]  over and steal people's property and enslave people and it's the same thing
[1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:19.120]  they're there setting up a Sange burning him he's being used to then get
[1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:23.720]  everybody angry and then get folks to go out and vandalize the web as a pretext
[1:27:23.720 --> 1:27:27.160]  to come control it I know I've already said that several times but that's a
[1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:31.360]  different way of saying it this is really important and it's just like the
[1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:36.120]  feds got caught in the early 90s going out and creating militia groups making
[1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:42.160]  them violent to demonize real militia groups this is how they do it any
[1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:47.720]  comments on that yes that's exactly what they're doing and real real coming up
[1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:54.240]  soon as a United Nations meeting on on on internet security around the world so
[1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:57.120]  it's real convenience that's being scheduled right after all of this and
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:03.760]  notice right now Winston they are trying to pass the cyber security they've got
[1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:08.280]  these new bills where you could be given life in prison or executed if you put
[1:28:08.280 --> 1:28:13.320]  anything classified out the government's classifying everything now this is how
[1:28:13.320 --> 1:28:18.400]  you disappear to prison in the new Nazi Germany is they say national security it
[1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:22.760]  was the same thing in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia now in England they're
[1:28:22.760 --> 1:28:28.080]  saying we may ban all protest that's martial law I mean notice right as the
[1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:32.360]  economic implosion happens they're announcing all of this just as we warned
[1:28:32.360 --> 1:28:36.800]  people because we've read the Rand Corporation documents we know what their
[1:28:36.800 --> 1:28:44.000]  next move is and talking on what on that bill that thing in Congress not only
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:48.280]  they're making it illegal to publish any classified information basically they
[1:28:48.280 --> 1:28:52.680]  want to make it illegal to revealing revealing the source documents of
[1:28:52.680 --> 1:28:58.040]  anything that they deem as national security and they're um and you know
[1:28:58.040 --> 1:29:01.080]  naming an informant even if that informant's name is publicly known has
[1:29:01.080 --> 1:29:04.080]  been reported in the media if you utter that person's name you can be charged
[1:29:04.080 --> 1:29:09.320]  with felony and it's crazy and folks I've read sections of the bill this is
[1:29:09.320 --> 1:29:14.160]  really happening and they had all this stuff already written they've already
[1:29:14.160 --> 1:29:18.600]  proposed it before and failed and and this is the new tyranny oh you don't go
[1:29:18.600 --> 1:29:23.000]  to a camp because you're Jewish or because you're a seventh-day Adventist
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:29.240]  you go to a camp because you release the Mayak or homeland security report you
[1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:33.360]  can see where this is going and as usual they've got mindless fake
[1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:39.440]  conservatives leading the charge to execute Julian Assange what a barrel of
[1:29:39.440 --> 1:29:44.320]  idiots I got a few final questions for you our white hat hacker security expert

[1:33:07.040 --> 1:33:13.800]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[1:33:13.800 --> 1:33:23.880]  network I was talking to a real estate broker who's a friend of mine last
[1:33:23.880 --> 1:33:28.920]  night and she's a listener of the show but I guess it never clicked she was
[1:33:28.920 --> 1:33:33.360]  watching Nightly News and they were announcing that your credit report
[1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:39.200]  everything you're doing in business your online activity is all being now sent
[1:33:39.200 --> 1:33:42.800]  to the government starting next year that's already been the case for a long
[1:33:42.800 --> 1:33:48.120]  time but in live time they announced three weeks ago in Wired Magazine the
[1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:52.600]  government admits we're watching all your credit card purchases your loyalty
[1:33:52.600 --> 1:34:00.080]  cards they're just getting rid of any denial they're just coming right out and
[1:34:00.080 --> 1:34:06.040]  saying there's no pretense of privacy and and these are felonies they're
[1:34:06.040 --> 1:34:11.480]  committing I mean just five years ago people would go to jail for this in
[1:34:11.480 --> 1:34:15.880]  government now they just say look we're doing it and then we get their
[1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:20.600]  internal documents and it's all about us and stealing from us nothing to do with
[1:34:20.600 --> 1:34:23.840]  the men in turbines who by the way on record have been caught working for them
[1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:28.000]  or who are provocateur by them over and over again Lindsey Williams is coming up
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:33.520]  here in a few minutes but I wanted our white hat hacker again we'll just call
[1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:38.160]  him Winston Smith from federaljack.com Winston any other tidbits you want to
[1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:42.560]  add and then some of the guys and their Matt Ryan and others they wanted to
[1:34:42.560 --> 1:34:45.520]  talk about the fact that you know Microsoft routinely goes to hacker
[1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:50.000]  conferences and gives the source code out to new Windows versions and says try
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:54.760]  to break it if you can and that the government has and Google and others
[1:34:54.760 --> 1:34:58.680]  which is basically the government really tries to recruit all the hackers they
[1:34:58.680 --> 1:35:03.480]  can to then work for them I guess on the dark side what percentage of hackers
[1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:07.720]  out there are awake now to this whole new world order system your comments on the
[1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:13.160]  general points I just made. The government and military industrial
[1:35:13.160 --> 1:35:17.120]  conflict contractors are definitely at hacker conferences recruiting pretty
[1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:21.320]  fine at any at any one of these major conferences you find Booz Allen
[1:35:21.320 --> 1:35:25.960]  Hamilton Lockheed Martin Raytheon they're all out there looking for people on
[1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:33.040]  NSA gives away scholarships at another one I know of. A lot of hackers are
[1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:38.480]  aware of what's going on but they're they're still kind of getting the
[1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:41.960]  jobs doing this stuff because they you know they're very lucrative paying jobs
[1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:47.040]  and so they're whether or not you know they're they're keeping their their
[1:35:47.040 --> 1:35:50.880]  original ethics when they're taking these jobs I don't know but a lot of hackers
[1:35:50.880 --> 1:35:55.440]  are aware of what's going on but they're also getting jobs within within
[1:35:55.440 --> 1:36:02.720]  the system so that they can basically live and you know that might be a good
[1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:07.760]  thing that might be a bad thing it's pretty much from what I when people I
[1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:11.400]  talked to while I'm out there a lot of people know what's going on and they're
[1:36:11.400 --> 1:36:14.720]  in agreement but they are but they'll still work at you know they'll still work
[1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:20.280]  for the government or for a defense contractor. Well it's clearly that old
[1:36:20.280 --> 1:36:25.840]  double-edged sword of it's good because as long as the hackers are into
[1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:30.640]  liberty and freedom it's great to have them inside the system the problem is
[1:36:30.640 --> 1:36:34.880]  that system is so corrupt and murderous that many times they go ahead and just
[1:36:34.880 --> 1:36:39.520]  set people up even if you haven't betrayed the system just because they
[1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:45.240]  want to have a conviction on you so it's very destructive and overall we need
[1:36:45.240 --> 1:36:49.160]  people that have knowledge of all these systems to be out there exposing the
[1:36:49.160 --> 1:36:54.880]  globalist as much as they can but it is creepy to have you and many others
[1:36:54.880 --> 1:36:58.440]  confirmed to us and send us the data that you know the government is out
[1:36:58.440 --> 1:37:02.520]  there trying to move against what we're doing the alternative media and then the
[1:37:02.520 --> 1:37:06.240]  great thing for the globalist is they can engage in these activities and then
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:12.760]  blame it on the rest of the hacker community. And a lot of a lot of the
[1:37:12.760 --> 1:37:16.760]  hackers that they're using for that are criminal informants like in the with the
[1:37:16.760 --> 1:37:20.640]  DJX breach the main hacker that was behind that was with a secret service
[1:37:20.640 --> 1:37:25.360]  informant getting paid $8,000 a year and at the same time he was the same guy
[1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:28.640]  who's doing all these big credit card breaches getting millions of credit card numbers and
[1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:35.640]  then they use that as a as you start clapping down on you know on basically
[1:37:35.640 --> 1:37:41.080]  internet freedoms and then monitoring financial transactions looking looking
[1:37:41.080 --> 1:37:44.320]  for fraud because your credit card is probably compromised by this guy but he's
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:47.640]  working for the secret service at the same time getting paid $80,000 a year and that was in
[1:37:47.640 --> 1:37:53.040]  Wired Magazine. So once you work for the government it's also just a license to
[1:37:53.040 --> 1:37:59.840]  engage in criminal activity. That seems to be the trend. They burned him
[1:37:59.840 --> 1:38:04.320]  pretty bad though for when they caught him. He got sent to 25 years for credit
[1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:09.880]  card theft which is unheard of. If you kill someone you can get
[1:38:09.880 --> 1:38:14.840]  ten years but if you steal their credit card you get 25. Well that could bring
[1:38:14.840 --> 1:38:18.920]  down the entire system all of this fraud that's going on and so many times it's
[1:38:18.920 --> 1:38:22.600]  come out the big banks are actually releasing this themselves and then
[1:38:22.600 --> 1:38:26.720]  using it as a pretext to try to bring in even more control because they can then
[1:38:26.720 --> 1:38:30.800]  put regulations in that are so strong only mega banks will be able to comply
[1:38:30.800 --> 1:38:36.160]  with all of it. Winston Smith good talking to you and appreciate all of your
[1:38:36.160 --> 1:38:40.320]  help and continue the great work there at Federal Jack and we are changed and
[1:38:40.320 --> 1:38:46.360]  we'll talk to you again soon. Thanks for having me on. You bet. Now for the rest of
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:50.240]  this hour and much of the next but I do have some other economic news, world news,
[1:38:50.240 --> 1:38:55.120]  police state news I've got to get to and we probably should just have open phones
[1:38:55.120 --> 1:39:00.560]  today talking about the shooting. It's so dramatic to have the footage of it that
[1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:07.840]  deranged person there in Florida. I mean just so many acts of heroism by the
[1:39:07.840 --> 1:39:12.800]  lady hitting him with the bag in the back of the head with the purse and one
[1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:15.880]  of the school board people saying well if I'm the bad guy go ahead and kill me
[1:39:15.880 --> 1:39:26.760]  just let everybody else go and it's just all wild and the roller coaster is
[1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:34.320]  just getting going. I mean society is gonna get crazier and crazier from here
[1:39:34.320 --> 1:39:42.440]  on out. We're gonna look back on 2010 and see it as tame good old days but the
[1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:48.120]  the fact is we're going into this. The question is will we come out on the other
[1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:52.840]  side totally enslaved or will we come out on the other side rediscovering
[1:39:52.840 --> 1:39:57.040]  liberty and freedom and rediscovering independence and rediscovering real
[1:39:57.040 --> 1:40:01.520]  community and discovering real values of liberty and freedom because liberty is
[1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:06.080]  the engine of wealth but with liberty comes wealth then comes decadence then
[1:40:06.080 --> 1:40:09.640]  comes enslavement because people stop standing up for freedom. We're gonna go
[1:40:09.640 --> 1:40:16.200]  to Lindsay Williams with a giant data dump of information unfortunately Mr. X
[1:40:16.200 --> 1:40:18.880]  who he can now reveal his name he revealed it a month ago here on air but
[1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:22.920]  now the poor fellow has died of cancer former Atlantic Richfield head of
[1:40:22.920 --> 1:40:28.120]  operations and a lot of it he couldn't talk about with his inside information
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:34.240]  until this gentleman had passed now he can but we're gonna go to him in just a

[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  couldn't believe this stuff 10 years ago when I was telling them now it's all
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:25.440]  coming true it's out in the open and we've just got to have the will to face
[1:44:25.440 --> 1:44:30.680]  it and do something about it I mean you think it's scary to come out and expose
[1:44:30.680 --> 1:44:34.200]  Dying Corps for running giant child kidnapping rings worldwide they run the
[1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:38.600]  local CPS right here in Texas I mean I think about the ramifications of that
[1:44:38.600 --> 1:44:42.360]  but it's in the WikiLeaks documents has been in mainstream news for years
[1:44:42.360 --> 1:44:46.360]  there's new stuff I mean you know you it's got to be done like I'm getting a
[1:44:46.360 --> 1:44:52.240]  sick feeling just thinking about it but folks this is so real that's why new
[1:44:52.240 --> 1:44:55.440]  listeners tune in and they think there's no way this could be real because it's
[1:44:55.440 --> 1:45:01.560]  so shocking it's much worse than I can even tell you okay alright folks I want
[1:45:01.560 --> 1:45:05.920]  to shift gears he'll be with us until the last 15 minutes the next hour we
[1:45:05.920 --> 1:45:09.560]  appreciate him joining us but I got a news blitz coming up then plus this
[1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:13.040]  incredible news they're announcing they may have full bore martial law in England
[1:45:13.040 --> 1:45:16.640]  that's what this announcement means saying no protest nationwide Watson's
[1:45:16.640 --> 1:45:21.720]  getting an article out on that right now at prisonplanet.com but things are
[1:45:21.720 --> 1:45:28.320]  just getting crazier and crazier by the minute but going to Lindsey Williams he
[1:45:28.320 --> 1:45:33.160]  was a pastor and was in the board meetings as their official chaplain for
[1:45:33.160 --> 1:45:37.440]  many years on the trans Alaska pipeline it's got more oil than Saudi Arabia he
[1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:41.360]  was there and watched him shut it off and not let him ship it out he was
[1:45:41.360 --> 1:45:46.120]  privy to all of that and decades after he wrote his book that's all mainstream
[1:45:46.120 --> 1:45:49.880]  knowledge now again people are like this stuff's wild what Williams is saying
[1:45:49.880 --> 1:45:53.720]  well I happen to know that everything he talked about 25 years ago came true
[1:45:53.720 --> 1:45:58.400]  because it was already real and he predicted that gas would go from $60
[1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:03.720]  a barrel to 150 in six months it happened he you know he's predicted so
[1:46:03.720 --> 1:46:06.960]  much here because of his sources he's got two former oil company executives
[1:46:06.960 --> 1:46:10.600]  one of them has just died and completely spilt his guts before he died
[1:46:10.600 --> 1:46:16.400]  Mr. Rex we gave his name out a month ago when Williams was here but but William's
[1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:19.360]  just a briefly recapping sir and I appreciate you joining us to coming on
[1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:22.920]  a little bit late I had to finish up with that wiki leaks hacker insider
[1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:29.800]  information but just I just recap Mr. Rex's name what the family said when he
[1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:34.800]  passed and then the stuff that you couldn't talk about until he had died
[1:46:34.800 --> 1:46:40.760]  well Alex thank you for allowing me to be on your show today because that's
[1:46:40.760 --> 1:46:45.320]  correct the Mr. Rex of my book energy non crisis there were actually two of them
[1:46:45.320 --> 1:46:51.400]  one of them just passed away days ago his name is Ken from now if any of you
[1:46:51.400 --> 1:46:55.760]  would like to do what Alex has done you can go and find it for yourself find out
[1:46:55.760 --> 1:47:01.440]  his position find out his place realize that he positively one of was one of the
[1:47:01.440 --> 1:47:07.440]  elitist of the world and before this man passed away he told me everything and
[1:47:07.440 --> 1:47:11.840]  you're going to hear some things today for the very first time because out of
[1:47:11.840 --> 1:47:17.040]  respect for the family until after the funeral I did not want to say certain
[1:47:17.040 --> 1:47:21.560]  things now Alex I know on the last show I did with you back oh probably a month
[1:47:21.560 --> 1:47:26.400]  ago you were pushing real hard to get me to say what might have been told me but
[1:47:26.400 --> 1:47:30.960]  out of respect for the family I felt that I had to hold back certain things
[1:47:30.960 --> 1:47:36.600]  until after he did who died now he is dead therefore I'm going to give you
[1:47:36.600 --> 1:47:42.160]  today many of the things that he told me now Alex I feel so fortunate though
[1:47:42.160 --> 1:47:47.440]  because you've heard me say many times that by the providence of God all of
[1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:52.520]  these things that happened the fact that I was the chaplain on the trans elastic
[1:47:52.520 --> 1:47:57.960]  oil pipeline literally lived with the elite of the world for three years had
[1:47:57.960 --> 1:48:01.600]  the opportunity to sit across the dinner table from the living the same dorms
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:05.720]  with the people that you hear about in the World Bank the IMF the top oil
[1:48:05.720 --> 1:48:10.480]  company officials of the world I take no credit for any of that all of that is
[1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:15.920]  by the providence of God and something else has just happened that I think has
[1:48:15.920 --> 1:48:22.880]  got to be the providence of God after Ken from died the second misdirection my
[1:48:22.880 --> 1:48:27.480]  book energy non-crisis was kept in touch with me on a very regular basis for the
[1:48:27.480 --> 1:48:33.000]  past 35 years he said on the phone one day he said chaplain Williams I know now
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:37.520]  that Ken has been giving you a lot of information and has passed away he said
[1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:43.800]  would you like for me to continue to fill his shoes and you give you the
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:48.560]  information I did not ask for that he volunteered it and again Alex I think it
[1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:53.640]  is by the providence of God so that hopefully I will be able to continue to
[1:48:53.640 --> 1:48:59.360]  wand the world of things that these elitist had planned on an ongoing basis now
[1:48:59.360 --> 1:49:04.280]  now why you know who the second person is sure even more high level than Mr.
[1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:10.280]  Fromm but we won't give out that name but but but going back here Fromm began to
[1:49:10.280 --> 1:49:14.520]  repent correct me if I'm wrong what is the position of this other guy I mean is
[1:49:14.520 --> 1:49:20.400]  he not liking what's happening or is he just enjoying telling us about our
[1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:26.360]  fate well this gentleman who wants the information to get out he's retired he's
[1:49:26.360 --> 1:49:32.800]  69 years of age he's the one that was cured of cancer he has a very close
[1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:39.360]  relationship with me and as a result he would like to see everything known in
[1:49:39.360 --> 1:49:45.040]  fact he gave me just the other day this is so startling would you like to know
[1:49:45.040 --> 1:49:50.280]  exactly what's going to happen so that you can spare your assets now this I
[1:49:50.280 --> 1:49:56.160]  mean this is just days ago it was said to me watch the European Union they said

[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:13.200]  and he gave it to me as a sign that I could spare my household he said to me
[1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:19.040]  the European Union they're going to have a major problem and he said the Euro

[1:55:01.360 --> 1:55:06.040]  Lindsey Williams Lindsey recapping the other oil company former CEO the other
[1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:13.120]  guy was a another company the the head of operations mr. X mr. Fromm was
[1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:16.840]  talking about euro collapse now that's been in the news lately but you're
[1:55:16.840 --> 1:55:22.240]  saying as an insider he's been told by his friends by his associates by his
[1:55:22.240 --> 1:55:27.640]  fellow you know members of I guess the Senate you know synagogue of the New
[1:55:27.640 --> 1:55:31.640]  World Order or the Church of the New World Order or the mosque of the New
[1:55:31.640 --> 1:55:36.160]  World Order or the whatever you want to call it the meeting place of the New
[1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:42.000]  World Order that they're going to implode it the name of the game is
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:47.520]  control Alex you remember back about two and a half years ago on your program I
[1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:52.320]  said that mr. Fromm had called me at the time I couldn't give his name I said he
[1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:56.520]  just called me today and said that the price of crude oil is going from a hundred
[1:55:56.520 --> 1:56:00.160]  and forty seven dollars a barrel to fifty dollars a barrel at the time you
[1:56:00.160 --> 1:56:03.800]  were paying four dollars a gallon at the gas pump two and a half years ago now
[1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:09.800]  within two months exactly what this man had told me it happened folks I am
[1:56:09.800 --> 1:56:15.200]  pleading with you today I am going to give you some signs that mr. Fromm and
[1:56:15.200 --> 1:56:20.480]  others have given to me and if you want to spare your household some heartaches
[1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:26.160]  you can do it but you've got to make certain preparations and and do certain
[1:56:26.160 --> 1:56:30.800]  things as far as your mindset is concerned and do it right now now I was
[1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:35.240]  told by mr. Fromm before he died that certain things were going to happen
[1:56:35.240 --> 1:56:39.600]  again with oil you remember I told you that they were going to keep
[1:56:39.600 --> 1:56:44.320]  the price of crude oil about seventy dollars a barrel for a period of time
[1:56:44.320 --> 1:56:49.320]  at least a year will it get that way for two and a half years and then on the
[1:56:49.320 --> 1:56:53.520]  previous show that I did with Alex I said Alex the price now is going to
[1:56:53.520 --> 1:56:57.000]  change he's going up well it's going up to ninety dollars a barrel and it's
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:59.960]  going to continue to go I'll tell you where it's going you said in the next
[1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:04.080]  six to eight months it would rise massively and as soon as you were on it
[1:57:04.080 --> 1:57:08.280]  began rising go ahead well that's what they told me I mean I had no way of
[1:57:08.280 --> 1:57:12.000]  knowing this just like I had no way of knowing that it was going to go down to
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:16.360]  a dollar and fifty cents a gallon at the gas pump back two and a half years ago I
[1:57:16.360 --> 1:57:20.000]  had no way of knowing it was going to go back up to a hundred fifty to two hundred
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:26.760]  dollars a barrel now right now right here in Phoenix Arizona today we are over
[1:57:26.760 --> 1:57:32.040]  three dollars a gallon for regular the cheap stuff in California it's four
[1:57:32.040 --> 1:57:36.880]  dollars a gallon right now you haven't seen anything yet I have been told it is
[1:57:36.880 --> 1:57:43.600]  going to $150 a barrel to $200 a barrel depending on how far they can push the
[1:57:43.600 --> 1:57:49.040]  American people it is going to drastically impact our economy it is
[1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:54.000]  already three dollars a gallon here in Phoenix Arizona you are going to see four
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:58.480]  to five dollars a gallon at the gas pump in the very near future six to nine
[1:57:58.480 --> 1:58:02.840]  months they'll take it as high as they can and they want it to go to $200 a
[1:58:02.840 --> 1:58:07.160]  barrel now let me get back to what Alex just mentioned the Euro folks this is
[1:58:07.160 --> 1:58:11.320]  more important I mean yes you're right this has been on the media but the the
[1:58:11.320 --> 1:58:15.480]  elite knew this before the media ever knew it because all the media is doing
[1:58:15.480 --> 1:58:19.800]  is forcing what the elite want them to say the European Union is going to have
[1:58:19.800 --> 1:58:24.920]  a major problem the Euro will see a collapse first before the American
[1:58:24.920 --> 1:58:30.960]  dollar whenever the you see the Euro collapse you have two to three weeks
[1:58:30.960 --> 1:58:37.080]  that's all you've got you must take certain action stay there back in 60
[1:58:37.080 --> 1:58:50.160]  stay there thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today hundreds of
[1:58:50.160 --> 1:58:54.360]  nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last

[1:58:59.360 --> 1:59:02.960]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this
[1:59:02.960 --> 1:59:08.040]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[1:59:08.040 --> 1:59:13.400]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[1:59:13.400 --> 1:59:18.320]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short cartel
[1:59:18.320 --> 1:59:22.720]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[2:00:00.240 --> 2:00:08.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:00:08.080 --> 2:00:15.600]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:15.600 --> 2:00:19.080]  Alex Jones
[2:00:20.200 --> 2:00:26.400]  ladies and gentlemen Lindsay Williams has got the sources from his years working
[2:00:26.400 --> 2:00:31.320]  with the CEOs and directors of several major oil companies as their official
[2:00:31.320 --> 2:00:34.840]  chaplain in their board man board meetings he was their buddy they took
[2:00:34.840 --> 2:00:39.080]  fishing he was the guy that hung out with him and he kept these contacts
[2:00:39.080 --> 2:00:43.560]  through the years and it's it's always been a great boon to our intelligence to
[2:00:43.560 --> 2:00:49.920]  see what's happening now if you just joined us his source dropped major bomb
[2:00:49.920 --> 2:00:56.760]  shells both the former CEO of a company and then the other former director of
[2:00:56.760 --> 2:01:02.400]  another company who just died mr. Fromm everything they talk about dealing
[2:01:02.400 --> 2:01:08.560]  with energy prices has been a hundred percent on and Lindsay this is a sort
[2:01:08.560 --> 2:01:12.880]  segment but but please get into it for people right now without the break
[2:01:12.880 --> 2:01:17.320]  interrupting you specifically what he said about the euro is going down did he
[2:01:17.320 --> 2:01:22.440]  give time frames and he said two to three weeks to quote do what once it goes
[2:01:22.440 --> 2:01:29.840]  down I am trying my best to spare you hearty by giving you these things that
[2:01:29.840 --> 2:01:34.080]  they've given to me and people oftentimes ask me why do the elite tell you
[2:01:34.080 --> 2:01:37.320]  these things well there's only two of them there's not others that have been
[2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:41.760]  willing to confide in me and I think the reason that doing it is because years
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:46.360]  ago I was willing to give three years of my life to be their chaplain and that's
[2:01:46.360 --> 2:01:50.000]  the reason they're telling me some very startling things now you have never
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:55.960]  heard me say this before I actually recorded the words of some of the elite
[2:01:55.960 --> 2:02:01.920]  and that's what people I actually recorded them when we were together I
[2:02:01.920 --> 2:02:06.560]  actually recorded them now I know people have had trouble believing some of the
[2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:10.440]  things I've said over the years but then what the elite have told me has taken
[2:02:10.440 --> 2:02:15.320]  place that way every single time so if you have any doubts whatsoever about
[2:02:15.320 --> 2:02:19.800]  believing Lindsay Williams don't believe me I'm just by the providence of God
[2:02:19.800 --> 2:02:25.080]  this spoken person that that is allowed to give this information out then you
[2:02:25.080 --> 2:02:30.600]  will be able to hear the voices of them themselves incredible so you're breaking
[2:02:30.600 --> 2:02:35.840]  this here first time this has ever been told Alex I have never said this on any
[2:02:35.840 --> 2:02:40.880]  radio show anywhere in the world I said to your producer when he called me two
[2:02:40.880 --> 2:02:44.840]  to three days ago I said I want to give this for the first time on the Alex
[2:02:44.840 --> 2:02:49.520]  show because I know you've got so much coverage I must get this information
[2:02:49.520 --> 2:02:54.280]  is this stuff you recorded back in the 70s and 80s or is this new stuff well
[2:02:54.280 --> 2:02:58.520]  some of it is new some of it is back then some of it goes back two years ago
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:04.880]  some of it is up to right now and then also what they're going to do I'm
[2:03:04.880 --> 2:03:09.280]  actually going to give you you will hear their words as to what they're going to
[2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:13.520]  do and you'll hear the words of their spoken person telling what they're going
[2:03:13.520 --> 2:03:18.800]  to do and I was told to listen to these things because in them I would find the
[2:03:18.800 --> 2:03:23.840]  buzz words now keep in mind one of the first things that I learned when I live
[2:03:23.840 --> 2:03:29.480]  with the elite of the world was to listen to that buzz words and I found I
[2:03:29.480 --> 2:03:33.840]  wrote three books about this and I said they have a code of ethics and in their
[2:03:33.840 --> 2:03:38.160]  code of ethics and they don't have the same code of ethics you and I have they
[2:03:38.160 --> 2:03:41.760]  don't have the Bible they don't believe the word of God they don't trust Jesus
[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:46.520]  Christ as a savior but they have a code of ethics and that code of ethics says
[2:03:46.520 --> 2:03:50.880]  that they must tell you what they're going to do before they do it and I have
[2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:56.480]  been told to listen to certain buzz words that they were giving and I know
[2:03:56.480 --> 2:04:00.720]  we're coming up on a break here so I am the next okay so what you're saying we
[2:04:00.720 --> 2:04:04.880]  give you some of that buzz words okay but I want to go back and and and recap
[2:04:04.880 --> 2:04:09.440]  where the oil prices are going the other intel that mr. Fromm gave you that you
[2:04:09.440 --> 2:04:12.800]  were allowed to give out after he passed and then I want to get into the
[2:04:12.800 --> 2:04:17.680]  specifics of you're saying two to three weeks they told you when the euro goes
[2:04:17.680 --> 2:04:23.640]  down I want to talk about when it's going down I want to talk about what
[2:04:23.640 --> 2:04:27.000]  they mean by you got two to three weeks two three weeks till total collapse
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:30.880]  bank shut down I mean let's get specifics on this long statement coming up
[2:04:30.880 --> 2:04:34.640]  plenty of time Lindsey and then did I mean did you record these guys do you
[2:04:34.640 --> 2:04:38.040]  have their authorization or did they tell you go out and find this press
[2:04:38.040 --> 2:04:41.360]  release that's where it's been admitted in plain view I know that's one of their
[2:04:41.360 --> 2:04:45.480]  favorite little tricks it's like one of their rules this is all breaking I I
[2:04:45.480 --> 2:04:50.760]  just knew that mr. Fromm was about to die of cancer and then he and then we
[2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:54.280]  called and he has died they have had the funeral so Lindsey's giving it all to us

[2:08:03.400 --> 2:08:05.920]  your mind
[2:08:05.920 --> 2:08:26.960]  Lindsay Williams the biggest data dump you've ever gotten from him and just
[2:08:26.960 --> 2:08:32.600]  thank God for him Pastor Williams again 20 plus years ago wrote a book the
[2:08:32.600 --> 2:08:37.520]  energy non-crisis laying out how there were more oil reserves that have been
[2:08:37.520 --> 2:08:41.600]  discovered in Alaska much of its sweet crude than all the Saudi Arabia but
[2:08:41.600 --> 2:08:45.480]  we're not allowed to have it they could have dozens of pipelines coming down our
[2:08:45.480 --> 2:08:51.160]  gas would be incredibly cheap but it's a rigged system and that has now all come
[2:08:51.160 --> 2:08:55.520]  out mainstream news making you know really his original stuff passé but
[2:08:55.520 --> 2:09:02.520]  people couldn't believe it 25 years ago now Mr. Fromm I knew that Dr. Mon
[2:09:02.520 --> 2:09:06.640]  teeth loves to dig around and he figured out who he was called him he
[2:09:06.640 --> 2:09:10.080]  figured out who the other guy was I'd figured it out it was all hidden in
[2:09:10.080 --> 2:09:14.760]  plain view and so I knew Williams was telling the truth and people here and
[2:09:14.760 --> 2:09:18.000]  they're like this can't be true that you know that the elite are actually
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:21.880]  talking to each other and know what's coming know what's gonna happen folks I
[2:09:21.880 --> 2:09:27.680]  don't know any billionaires I've met a few and and and a billionaire I ran into
[2:09:27.680 --> 2:09:32.360]  through a another person I know and then afterwards after I'd met with her
[2:09:32.360 --> 2:09:35.880]  I looked her up online and found that it was on was just blown away this is one
[2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:39.080]  of the richest women in the United States which didn't live her now and she
[2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:44.320]  said this was this was about three years ago three and a half years ago and
[2:09:44.320 --> 2:09:48.600]  she said in three years so I guess she's a little behind on the time there
[2:09:48.600 --> 2:09:52.240]  won't be a United States and I said what does that mean she just said I'm
[2:09:52.240 --> 2:09:57.480]  getting out of here and she said you'll see then I'm out in the Hill Country at
[2:09:57.480 --> 2:10:00.920]  an event with some people that my kids are friends with and there's John Wayne's
[2:10:00.920 --> 2:10:06.320]  you know you know one of his kids living out there and they're like yeah and I
[2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:09.720]  went and looked them up later and it is one of John Wayne's kids I'm leaving I'm
[2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:14.200]  leaving the country you know because of all these new rules I mean they all know
[2:10:14.200 --> 2:10:20.080]  folks they all know what's going on every time I run into some elitist or
[2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:24.160]  wealthy person they're like either laughing at everybody or like abandon
[2:10:24.160 --> 2:10:28.240]  ship because they have well let's go to Lindsay Williams Lindsay in the interest
[2:10:28.240 --> 2:10:33.640]  of time because I mean we're running out here and there's so much to tell let's
[2:10:33.640 --> 2:10:38.160]  go through through it piece by piece your other Mr. Rex not Ken from but the
[2:10:38.160 --> 2:10:41.920]  other Mr. Rex it was even more high level than him he told you specifically
[2:10:41.920 --> 2:10:45.640]  what about the euro collapsed did he give you timeframes and then you got cut
[2:10:45.640 --> 2:10:49.880]  off by the break you said you'll only have two or three weeks to get out what
[2:10:49.880 --> 2:10:56.560]  does that mean quantify that question okay the again let me say that only by
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:11:00.320]  the providence of God could I have never known any of these things don't give
[2:11:00.320 --> 2:11:06.040]  Lindsay Williams credit for this all right he said to me the other day he said
[2:11:06.040 --> 2:11:10.120]  Lindsay I want to show you how to listen to up some buzzwords and I'm gonna give
[2:11:10.120 --> 2:11:13.520]  them to you right now Alex wants me to give them quick I'll try my best to do
[2:11:13.520 --> 2:11:20.120]  it I want to train you I want to teach you right now how to listen to the buzzwords
[2:11:20.120 --> 2:11:26.160]  of the elite he gave me a few of them and he said you listen to these and then
[2:11:26.160 --> 2:11:29.480]  figured out for yourself here's one right here you probably saw it in the
[2:11:29.480 --> 2:11:34.280]  national media he told me to listen to it the International Monetary Fund it
[2:11:34.280 --> 2:11:39.200]  was only a few days ago that they said now now pick out the buzzwords and then
[2:11:39.200 --> 2:11:44.040]  I'll give them to you and explain them he said 15 major developing country
[2:11:44.040 --> 2:11:50.320]  governments including the US Japan and the UK Spain and Greece must raise 10.2
[2:11:50.320 --> 2:11:55.560]  trillion and that's correct you did not hear me say million or billion said they
[2:11:55.560 --> 2:12:02.240]  must raise 10.2 trillion dollars to repay nothing but the interest interest only
[2:12:02.240 --> 2:12:07.640]  on the indebtedness of these countries and then he said to me he said can they
[2:12:07.640 --> 2:12:14.040]  do that and I said no I said it's a total impossibility he said now listen to
[2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:18.520]  the rest of this he said this 10.2 trillion that they must raise in order
[2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:24.640]  to pay the interest just on the debt alone is 27% of their combined annual
[2:12:24.640 --> 2:12:30.560]  economic output he said chaplain you cannot repay that he said all right now
[2:12:30.560 --> 2:12:35.880]  he's training me to listen and I did this years ago I trained myself to listen
[2:12:35.880 --> 2:12:39.720]  to that buzzwords but he's kind of helping me understand their very latest
[2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:44.000]  buzzwords and I'm trying to help you understand them okay now he said if this
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:48.560]  can't be done then what are they going to do about that debt I said they can't
[2:12:48.560 --> 2:12:52.440]  pay it he said that's right he said then what happens to the currency of the
[2:12:52.440 --> 2:12:57.800]  unit of the United States and Japan and the UK and Spain and Greece I said it
[2:12:57.800 --> 2:13:02.880]  it's got to collapse he said now you're getting the message he said we told you
[2:13:02.880 --> 2:13:07.200]  all the time what was going to happen but he said the average American hasn't
[2:13:07.200 --> 2:13:10.600]  got sense enough to understand what we're trying to say let me give you some
[2:13:10.600 --> 2:13:16.040]  more buzzwords take the comic silver exchange he said listen to what they
[2:13:16.040 --> 2:13:20.040]  told you last week are you ready you know what the comic silver exchange is
[2:13:20.040 --> 2:13:25.240]  they're the ones that hold the silver in their vaults for the richest people in
[2:13:25.240 --> 2:13:30.720]  the face of the earth the people in China and Japan and Russia and the wealthy
[2:13:30.720 --> 2:13:35.120]  people of the world and then they give them a piece of paper saying we are
[2:13:35.120 --> 2:13:39.760]  holding this silver for you now you said the comic silver exchange announced
[2:13:39.760 --> 2:13:45.080]  just the other day that they have a hundred and seven million ounces of
[2:13:45.080 --> 2:13:50.840]  silver on hand now you folks you listening they've got a hundred seven
[2:13:50.840 --> 2:13:57.120]  million ounces of silver on hand but they have contractual obligations in the
[2:13:57.120 --> 2:14:03.720]  amount of 720 million ounces of silver that they've given out pieces of paper
[2:14:03.720 --> 2:14:10.240]  saying we have this on hand and we can deliver it to you upon your request now
[2:14:10.240 --> 2:14:15.640]  he said chaplain whenever they people start to ask for delivery of that
[2:14:15.640 --> 2:14:20.800]  physical silver he said what is going to happen to the price of silver he said
[2:14:20.800 --> 2:14:25.800]  Mr. Fromm told you back about a year or two ago that the only thing you could
[2:14:25.800 --> 2:14:30.560]  spare your assets in is silver and go now folks I don't sell silver and go
[2:14:30.560 --> 2:14:34.400]  you listen to Alex Jones he'll tell you what to go and buy that I'm just trying
[2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:40.000]  to tell you that they told me two years ago chaplain is only one way you're
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:44.240]  going to spare your assets and that's silver and gold the price is going so
[2:14:44.240 --> 2:14:47.680]  high most people can't buy it but I want you back when you could get it for six
[2:14:47.680 --> 2:14:51.480]  and seven hundred dollars about that you ought to buy it immediately let me go
[2:14:51.480 --> 2:14:55.200]  back Lindsay let me go back I mean do people say to me well why are you
[2:14:55.200 --> 2:14:58.640]  promoting silver and gold and I've had national media asking that and I look at
[2:14:58.640 --> 2:15:05.280]  them like they're crazy and I say I was promoting gold when it was $300 an
[2:15:05.280 --> 2:15:09.960]  ounce I was promoting silver when it was $5 an ounce because I knew they were
[2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:13.760]  devaluing the currency and it would come to a head and that they got rid of
[2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:19.760]  Glass-Steagall I mean it'd be kind of like if I moved to a resort town in
[2:15:19.760 --> 2:15:24.000]  Colorado and set up a canoe shop by a river well why did you set up a canoe
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:29.480]  shop because there's tourists around here I mean I mean it's like the the
[2:15:29.480 --> 2:15:34.440]  George Soros media they make it like bad to promote silver and gold when it's
[2:15:34.440 --> 2:15:40.600]  like common sense I mean it's it's it's just crazy that I believe in silver and
[2:15:40.600 --> 2:15:46.200]  gold I've got guns I've got storable food I've got water filters I'm trying to
[2:15:46.200 --> 2:15:50.240]  move right now to the countryside I'll just be honest with folks it's been
[2:15:50.240 --> 2:15:54.200]  better than just leaving the country every people I know that are smart have
[2:15:54.200 --> 2:15:57.760]  moved out of Austin far out in the country and people that are smarter
[2:15:57.760 --> 2:16:01.280]  getting ready because let me tell you when they tell you the economy is going
[2:16:01.280 --> 2:16:05.840]  to turn around it's a lie ladies and gentlemen they've designed this they're
[2:16:05.840 --> 2:16:10.080]  just stalling you long enough so they can make sure they're all prepared and
[2:16:10.080 --> 2:16:15.440]  got their grid in place I'm sorry Lindsay it's just it's just my jobs easy I'm so
[2:16:15.440 --> 2:16:20.360]  glad to hear you say what you just said I want to congratulate you you know where
[2:16:20.360 --> 2:16:25.080]  Mr. Swartzman you know who Swartzman is he's the head of the Blackstone group
[2:16:25.080 --> 2:16:30.600]  yes I keep up with these elite and I have made a survey as to where the elite
[2:16:30.600 --> 2:16:35.760]  lived where did Mr. Farmer live he lived in the middle of nowhere he lived the
[2:16:35.760 --> 2:16:40.320]  way out in a little pulled up place called salt on Alaska before he died
[2:16:40.320 --> 2:16:44.440]  he moved to the middle of nowhere where does this other Mr. X or my book
[2:16:44.440 --> 2:16:48.560]  energy not crisis live he lives back further than what Mr. Farmer lived now
[2:16:48.560 --> 2:16:55.160]  what is Swartzman of the Blackstone group which is the he is probably the
[2:16:55.160 --> 2:16:59.680]  biggest financier of financial instruments in the United States of
[2:16:59.680 --> 2:17:03.360]  America he said last week he said I'm leaving the country now I'm not leaving
[2:17:03.360 --> 2:17:06.720]  the country Alex you're not leaving the country wait that's a bombshell he told
[2:17:06.720 --> 2:17:11.920]  you he's leaving the country himself well yeah but you and I not leaving the
[2:17:11.920 --> 2:17:15.640]  country we're staying here we're gonna fight this thing out and see it through
[2:17:15.640 --> 2:17:19.400]  and I want to continue to be able to be here to get information from these
[2:17:19.400 --> 2:17:23.200]  people and to give it out to you on the Alex Jones show at every place I could
[2:17:23.200 --> 2:17:26.320]  possibly give it in order to help spirit listen I don't know how long we're
[2:17:26.320 --> 2:17:30.520]  gonna be here the stuff going on behind the scenes is just I'm glad you're
[2:17:30.520 --> 2:17:33.720]  moving out though Alex moving out to the country moving out in the wild open
[2:17:33.720 --> 2:17:37.720]  spaces I did the same thing I live in the middle of nowhere and you've got to
[2:17:37.720 --> 2:17:42.240]  you've got to make preparations right now okay let me go back to their buzzwords
[2:17:42.240 --> 2:17:47.200]  again because this fits right in with the European Union and I'm not playing
[2:17:47.200 --> 2:17:52.720]  games I just want to teach you how to listen to the buzzwords of the elite so
[2:17:52.720 --> 2:17:56.120]  you can do this for yourself because I only have the privilege of being on Alex
[2:17:56.120 --> 2:18:02.040]  Jones show maybe every once a month or two but okay European Union the Euro
[2:18:02.040 --> 2:18:05.720]  European Union is gonna have a major problem I've already been told that the
[2:18:05.720 --> 2:18:11.160]  Euro will collapse before the American dollar and whatever it does you have two
[2:18:11.160 --> 2:18:14.680]  to three weeks to get out of paper do you remember what I told you that Mr.
[2:18:14.680 --> 2:18:18.680]  Fromm said to me back about two years ago he said Chaplin if it's written on a
[2:18:18.680 --> 2:18:23.440]  piece of paper it's worth the paper it's written on he said get out of anything
[2:18:23.440 --> 2:18:28.120]  that is paper now do you realize what that means that means get out of your
[2:18:28.120 --> 2:18:35.520]  IRAs get out of your 401ks get out of your retirement funds cash in at any cost
[2:18:35.520 --> 2:18:39.840]  I don't care what it may be you're gonna lose them anyway if you don't your
[2:18:39.840 --> 2:18:44.120]  social security you cannot depend on it I know you've got it right now but you
[2:18:44.120 --> 2:18:47.280]  not gonna be able to depend on it for that long you think your insurance
[2:18:47.280 --> 2:18:52.120]  policy is gonna be worth anything whenever paper becomes worthless and what
[2:18:52.120 --> 2:18:57.680]  is it that you and I use every day we use the Federal Reserve note and I have
[2:18:57.680 --> 2:19:03.880]  been told that when you see the Euro collapse you have two to three weeks to
[2:19:03.880 --> 2:19:07.920]  get out of every piece of paper you've got including your bank account if you
[2:19:07.920 --> 2:19:11.880]  don't you're going to lose it Alex I don't know how any planer I can put it
[2:19:11.880 --> 2:19:15.960]  and they've said to me okay the other day one of them said to me he said the
[2:19:15.960 --> 2:19:22.160]  Federal Reserve is borrowing one hundred billion dollars every 30 days does this
[2:19:22.160 --> 2:19:27.480]  scare you you know to secure the pants off of you and Mr. Fromm told me two
[2:19:27.480 --> 2:19:32.200]  years ago and I said it over your program Alex and that was before the
[2:19:32.200 --> 2:19:37.040]  Federal Reserve started buying their own debt he said to me Chaplin whenever the
[2:19:37.040 --> 2:19:42.320]  Federal Reserve begins to buy their own debt he said it's practically all over
[2:19:42.320 --> 2:19:47.200]  now the Federal Reserve is buying their own debt because China and Japan and
[2:19:47.200 --> 2:19:51.400]  other countries aren't buying it like they did before and last week the
[2:19:51.400 --> 2:19:57.200]  Federal Reserve borrowed 100 billion dollars every 30 days and by the way
[2:19:57.200 --> 2:20:02.960]  that's only QE2 they've now announced QE3 they're gonna start borrowing 200 to
[2:20:02.960 --> 2:20:13.400]  250 bill a month yes and where is the 10-year note now most people are not
[2:20:13.400 --> 2:20:17.040]  necessarily financially minded but they're dumping treasuries all over the
[2:20:17.040 --> 2:20:20.840]  world Russia and China two weeks ago announced that they were gonna stop
[2:20:20.840 --> 2:20:24.720]  using the dollar between trade now they have officially in fact that's in my
[2:20:24.720 --> 2:20:29.240]  stack I didn't get to it today Russia to use China currency so we were wondering
[2:20:29.240 --> 2:20:33.600]  what it would be it's gonna be the Chinese currency for all their trade
[2:20:33.600 --> 2:20:38.400]  between each other which is massive they border each other I mean it's
[2:20:38.400 --> 2:20:45.960]  happening I'm sorry I'm interrupting you did your source the former CEO not Mr.
[2:20:45.960 --> 2:20:51.240]  Rex the other Atlantic Richfield former head did he say what the time frame was
[2:20:51.240 --> 2:20:56.120]  he said the time frame on oil a month ago and suddenly it's gone up 15 20 bucks
[2:20:56.120 --> 2:21:02.800]  since then and racing up did he say the time frame on the euro default he did
[2:21:02.800 --> 2:21:06.200]  not say when the euro is going to collapse email he said it's going to
[2:21:06.200 --> 2:21:11.200]  he said let this be assigned to you whatever it happens he said you've got
[2:21:11.200 --> 2:21:14.600]  two to three weeks to make some very definite preparations if you haven't
[2:21:14.600 --> 2:21:18.920]  already done it now many things that in your life you will begin to need to make
[2:21:18.920 --> 2:21:23.040]  those preparations right now because for instance you can't get out of your IRA
[2:21:23.040 --> 2:21:29.200]  in two weeks well Lindsay here's an example with yours truly all the money
[2:21:29.200 --> 2:21:33.280]  almost all the money I've got is just sitting there in a bank to run this
[2:21:33.280 --> 2:21:39.360]  this operation because it costs so much to run it you know it takes I mean it
[2:21:39.360 --> 2:21:43.440]  takes a million dollars to run it for six months anybody who's got employees and
[2:21:43.440 --> 2:21:47.800]  buildings and payroll and taxes and insurance knows that so we don't have a
[2:21:47.800 --> 2:21:51.120]  you know a big reserve but we've got something because our mission so I mean
[2:21:51.120 --> 2:21:56.760]  what do I even do with that that's what's so crazy about this situation is I
[2:21:56.760 --> 2:22:00.840]  have to leave it in the bank to pay the bills and run the operation so I guess
[2:22:00.840 --> 2:22:08.280]  it makes my head hurt Lindsay well yes it does it'll make your head spin and
[2:22:08.280 --> 2:22:12.000]  those are things that we all need to think about in advance now why am I
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:16.400]  saying this and why does Alex say these things day after day I'm not saying this
[2:22:16.400 --> 2:22:22.080]  to scare you quite to the contrary I want you to prepare and spare yourself
[2:22:22.080 --> 2:22:25.800]  heartache and save your dinner table that's the only reason I'm telling you
[2:22:25.800 --> 2:22:29.840]  these things not to keep you awake at night but to make preparations right
[2:22:29.840 --> 2:22:34.400]  now because if you prepare for the inevitable then when it does happen
[2:22:34.400 --> 2:22:38.240]  there'll be very little effect on you while the rest of the world is totally
[2:22:38.240 --> 2:22:41.640]  collapsing around you well Lindsay you're absolutely right people say oh the
[2:22:41.640 --> 2:22:45.480]  government fear mongers Alex you fear monger the government fear mongers about
[2:22:45.480 --> 2:22:49.600]  boogie men with turbines on their head and we all know 9-11 was an inside job
[2:22:49.600 --> 2:22:53.840]  used to set up the police state grid anybody in denial about that is starting
[2:22:53.840 --> 2:22:58.520]  to wake up as they admit it's for the American people I'm saying be concerned
[2:22:58.520 --> 2:23:03.600]  about dollar devaluation be concerned about globalism be concerned about
[2:23:03.600 --> 2:23:10.080]  carbon taxes and it's all happening now California's got over 30% unemployment
[2:23:10.080 --> 2:23:15.280]  even 60 minutes admits that and what do they do Lindsay they slapped a carbon
[2:23:15.280 --> 2:23:21.720]  tax at 20% on them they want to run that economy down on the ground the elite
[2:23:21.720 --> 2:23:26.920]  won't America to collapse I have been told this and you say why would they
[2:23:26.920 --> 2:23:33.600]  want to collapse their own economy their own country very simple you never buy
[2:23:33.600 --> 2:23:38.800]  something when it's at its peak and making great money instead you bankrupt
[2:23:38.800 --> 2:23:44.280]  it get it on pennies on the dollar it's like they did Chrysler and GM general
[2:23:44.280 --> 2:23:48.360]  motors they waited until they first collapsed them then they took them over
[2:23:48.360 --> 2:23:52.400]  at taxpayers expense through the federal reserve because the federal reserve is
[2:23:52.400 --> 2:23:56.440]  no more federal than federal express and the federal reserve basically all the
[2:23:56.440 --> 2:24:01.320]  elite and some others along with them now if whatever you collapse these
[2:24:01.320 --> 2:24:05.040]  corporations then you can take a mobile for nothing that's what they go to do
[2:24:05.040 --> 2:24:10.240]  with the mortgage back securities and your house payment yeah first they sell
[2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:14.560]  it though first they sell it when it's all hot as hotcakes up front to
[2:24:14.560 --> 2:24:19.320]  everybody then when it implodes they go give us bailouts to fix it and they
[2:24:19.320 --> 2:24:23.200]  keep the bailout money and the derivatives are still there then they say
[2:24:23.200 --> 2:24:26.920]  give us more bailout money will fix it then they don't then everything
[2:24:26.920 --> 2:24:30.600]  implodes they're flush with all the money they come in and buy it all up for
[2:24:30.600 --> 2:24:34.120]  pennies on the dollar and if you don't like it they got the National Guard the
[2:24:34.120 --> 2:24:39.960]  CIA the FBI and paramilitary squads ready to come and take you out I mean they've
[2:24:39.960 --> 2:24:45.000]  set this whole thing up they did set it up and I was told this for the past 35
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:49.440]  years what they were doing Alex and I've had the privilege of from time to time
[2:24:49.440 --> 2:24:52.920]  being on your show and telling people this was going to happen and I wasn't
[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:56.520]  doing it to scare you I was doing it because the elite told me this and
[2:24:56.520 --> 2:25:02.240]  every single thing folks please every single thing you hearing Alex Jones say
[2:25:02.240 --> 2:25:07.600]  is the truth you've got to listen to him every day and take to heart what he's
[2:25:07.600 --> 2:25:14.000]  saying now mr. Trump told me two years I'm sorry a year and a half ago you're
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:17.760]  ready yes give you the expressions again I've given them a full but I think you
[2:25:17.760 --> 2:25:23.760]  must hear these again he said within two years you will not recognize America
[2:25:23.760 --> 2:25:28.680]  well folks you better believe that we already beginning to see that take
[2:25:28.680 --> 2:25:34.720]  place again he said after two years you will be so poor I couldn't understand a
[2:25:34.720 --> 2:25:39.280]  year to a year and a half ago while this man was saying this he said within two
[2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:44.560]  years you'll be so poor you will not be able to do anything about it folks if
[2:25:44.560 --> 2:25:49.120]  we're going to turn America around we've got to have massive move but
[2:25:49.120 --> 2:25:54.560]  immediately and it can be done believe me it can be done he said again one day
[2:25:54.560 --> 2:26:00.080]  he said by 2012 the dollar will be dead well they may have accomplished that a
[2:26:00.080 --> 2:26:04.640]  little bit before 2012 but the rate they're going to euro that looks will
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:08.720]  have that happen before 20 now even Wall Street Journal and Der Spiegel are
[2:26:08.720 --> 2:26:13.040]  saying the euro could go belly up any time well I don't think you're going to
[2:26:13.040 --> 2:26:18.320]  see it this week or next week from what I was told by the other gentlemen or
[2:26:18.320 --> 2:26:22.280]  mr. from past no they're gonna suck all the little countries dry first in the
[2:26:22.280 --> 2:26:27.240]  name of propping it up and then bring down Germany France in England yes they
[2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:30.680]  are and you're seeing some things happen in England you said you were going to
[2:26:30.680 --> 2:26:34.920]  give it on the program yet today so watch these things because these are
[2:26:34.920 --> 2:26:39.800]  buzzwords again he said to me back about a year year and a half ago he said
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:44.520]  within two years nearly everyone will be working for the government could we
[2:26:44.520 --> 2:26:49.640]  have possibly imagined General Motors and Chrysler and the banks being taken
[2:26:49.640 --> 2:26:54.120]  over nine to ten of them almost every week the health care program bringing
[2:26:54.120 --> 2:26:58.080]  every doctor dentist and everybody in as employees for the government of the
[2:26:58.080 --> 2:27:01.880]  United States of America we could not have imagined this at the time of this
[2:27:01.880 --> 2:27:06.320]  that this man told me this but it's taking place today exactly like he told
[2:27:06.320 --> 2:27:11.480]  me it would happen now he's saying that things are gonna happen in Europe and
[2:27:11.480 --> 2:27:14.800]  whatever they happen you've got two to three weeks if you haven't already made
[2:27:14.800 --> 2:27:19.280]  certain preparation and then Alex he told me something else recently all this
[2:27:19.280 --> 2:27:24.080]  all you give us the new Intel what you couldn't tell us until he'd passed for
[2:27:24.080 --> 2:27:29.840]  cancer tell us the new Intel well first of all the Devil's Messiah I know that
[2:27:29.840 --> 2:27:34.120]  this might seem insignificant to some but it's very important to me having
[2:27:34.120 --> 2:27:37.240]  been a minister of the gospel for over 50 years that's what they call it they
[2:27:37.240 --> 2:27:41.440]  call it Devil's Messiah what is it yeah the Devil's Messiah is that plan
[2:27:41.440 --> 2:27:45.880]  whereby they could bring in the new war order in America and they knew that there
[2:27:45.880 --> 2:27:50.240]  was no way that they could do it until they first removed the God and the
[2:27:50.240 --> 2:27:54.560]  foundation upon which America was built and in order to bring that about they
[2:27:54.560 --> 2:27:59.680]  had to bring in the evolution they had to bring in control of churches by 501
[2:27:59.680 --> 2:28:03.040]  C3 organization yeah even if you're not a Christian you have to understand
[2:28:03.040 --> 2:28:08.040]  social engineers have to get rid of the old order to bring in the new so they've
[2:28:08.040 --> 2:28:11.840]  done that they've dumbed us down they've taught us to not have morals so we
[2:28:11.840 --> 2:28:17.160]  couldn't recognize tyranny and resisted let me give you an example this was
[2:28:17.160 --> 2:28:21.480]  just so startling the other day the European Union you remember when the
[2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:27.080]  European Union was first set up and so many Bible teachers and ministers all
[2:28:27.080 --> 2:28:33.520]  over the country said the European Union is the 10th whole kingdom of the book of
[2:28:33.520 --> 2:28:38.840]  Daniel and we finally have all of these prophetic scriptures of the book of
[2:28:38.840 --> 2:28:47.400]  Revelation by the 10 nations formation in Europe no way this was deception they
[2:28:47.400 --> 2:28:52.240]  were trying to make fools out of the ministers of America I didn't know it
[2:28:52.240 --> 2:28:56.520]  at the time I even used to talk about this and then it went up to 11 nations
[2:28:56.520 --> 2:29:02.080]  and 12 nations and 13 nations it went past 10 and utterly embarrassed some of
[2:29:02.080 --> 2:29:05.560]  the biggest Bible scholars in the early study the Bible it says there's many
[2:29:05.560 --> 2:29:10.880]  antichrist there's models of it building I mean the globalist always be going
[2:29:10.880 --> 2:29:15.000]  back thousands of years the illuminous they build similar models towards their
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:21.400]  final system you know and they had this devil's devil's Messiah as it was
[2:29:21.400 --> 2:29:25.480]  actually called the visual is dark orange if the man used he said devil's
[2:29:25.480 --> 2:29:31.080]  Messiah and part of it I found out was this European Union sure it's all set
[2:29:31.080 --> 2:29:35.440]  up by the elitist but they didn't they didn't stop at 10 toes as Daniel talks
[2:29:35.440 --> 2:29:40.800]  about in his image stay there we come back give us a deception Lindsay stay
[2:29:40.800 --> 2:29:43.760]  there when we come back tell us all the other things he told you we'll be right

[2:33:36.520 --> 2:33:42.840]  through ladies and gentlemen this is an illegitimate banking takeover of our
[2:33:42.840 --> 2:33:47.360]  society and for the globalist world government is just the beginning then
[2:33:47.360 --> 2:33:51.720]  they can carry out the forced one-child policies the forced abortions that Ted
[2:33:51.720 --> 2:33:57.440]  Turner chairing a U.N. meeting called for last Monday not this Monday but last
[2:33:57.440 --> 2:34:02.080]  Monday eight nine days ago and we had word moncted on from there the

[2:34:06.800 --> 2:34:10.200]  to Lindsay Williams here in just a moment but I want to just state the fact
[2:34:10.200 --> 2:34:14.080]  this is illegitimate this is criminal that's why they've set up these
[2:34:14.080 --> 2:34:18.800]  paramilitary police forces it's illegal to spy on our credit card purchases in
[2:34:18.800 --> 2:34:23.320]  real time they do it it's illegal to have our neighbors spying on us they do
[2:34:23.320 --> 2:34:30.560]  it it's tail tail I cannot stress this enough tail tail oppression it's
[2:34:30.560 --> 2:34:36.400]  hardcore brazen certified tyranny it'd be like if you drove down to a country
[2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:43.400]  lane and saw a giant Charley bull big white bull and you said there's a big
[2:34:43.400 --> 2:34:48.800]  bull and some idiot says I don't see a bull and I mean this this is like
[2:34:48.800 --> 2:34:53.200]  watching a train coming towards you a big locomotive a speed train going 200
[2:34:53.200 --> 2:34:57.640]  miles an hour and people are denying that either on a train track and that be
[2:34:57.640 --> 2:35:02.120]  a big lights coming toward them and that's what's so frustrating about this
[2:35:02.120 --> 2:35:05.560]  but I want to show a document cam shot because this is big breaking news
[2:35:05.560 --> 2:35:13.720]  martial law UK police chief moles banning protest this is big news I want to

[2:38:46.560 --> 2:38:51.000]  the British government to ban protest marches all together in response to last
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:54.680]  week's student riots a move that would place Britain under a de facto state of
[2:38:54.680 --> 2:38:58.120]  martial law whenever you hear about a country going under martial law they
[2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:02.600]  always say protest or banned first they train you to be in a free speech zone or
[2:39:02.600 --> 2:39:06.000]  you can't protest in this area you got to have a permit then they just say no
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:10.800]  protest it is one of the tactics we look at and something we will keep under
[2:39:10.800 --> 2:39:15.200]  review and if we think it's the right thing to do we'll do it he told the

[2:39:20.800 --> 2:39:24.640]  protest is an integral part of our heritage and it is the responsibility
[2:39:24.640 --> 2:39:29.280]  the police to help facilitate that and it goes on to document that the police
[2:39:29.280 --> 2:39:32.800]  actually have staged many of the events as they've been caught not just in

[2:40:17.040 --> 2:40:20.760]  long as they're going to take me through a machine that's the same as putting me
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:25.080]  in a microwave for so many seconds I said I will not do it you realize when
[2:40:25.080 --> 2:40:28.400]  you go through those body scanners that it's the same as putting you within the

[2:41:08.440 --> 2:41:13.400]  than just greed it's a spirit of pure evil everybody can feel it I can't even
[2:41:13.400 --> 2:41:17.000]  go to Los Angeles now because I feel the evil so strong and I've ever said
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:20.640]  that on air but I was talking to Jaren he's the same way got a lot of friends
[2:41:20.640 --> 2:41:24.680]  there the other night we went out and had dinner I mean I literally LA is so

[2:41:29.280 --> 2:41:33.040]  oppression and now I'm starting to feel it in other areas do you know what I'm
[2:41:33.040 --> 2:41:37.240]  talking about in your spirit yes the cancer rate by the way because of these
[2:41:37.240 --> 2:41:40.840]  new body scanners at the airport to cancer rate six months a year from now
[2:41:40.840 --> 2:41:45.360]  it's going to go up so high you can't even comprehend what's that I will not
[2:41:45.360 --> 2:41:51.360]  fly a commercial airline except in a diary emergency anymore no way am I
[2:41:51.360 --> 2:41:55.240]  going to subject myself to that and then to go through the embarrassment of a
[2:41:55.240 --> 2:42:00.960]  pat down come on give me a break this is contrary to the constitution of the
[2:42:00.960 --> 2:42:03.760]  United States of America okay very quickly I know we're running out of
[2:42:03.760 --> 2:42:08.160]  time here Alex Alex but let me give you a few statements it was yes and then I
[2:42:08.160 --> 2:42:11.800]  know you're working on an audio or a video you haven't mentioned that yet so
[2:42:11.800 --> 2:42:15.360]  I want to make sure you do that but yeah data dumping quick statements what
[2:42:15.360 --> 2:42:20.480]  else can you now say that that Mr. Frum has now died told you versus the other
[2:42:20.480 --> 2:42:25.160]  Mr. X who's still alive the former CEO of a major big three okay I'll give you
[2:42:25.160 --> 2:42:28.760]  these in one liners because they don't have time to explain any of them he said
[2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:34.160]  America this is the elite's most difficult challenge now folks that means
[2:42:34.160 --> 2:42:39.040]  that if they think this is their biggest challenge and this was said to me it's a
[2:42:39.040 --> 2:42:43.280]  biggest challenge that means we can turn this thing around if you want to
[2:42:43.280 --> 2:42:48.000]  rebel enough we can see it turn around another expression oh that's hold on we
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:51.160]  have to go into overdrive Lindsay but I've got all these meetings I gotta have
[2:42:51.160 --> 2:42:56.800]  after the show that is such good news I mean this is going for broke they're
[2:42:56.800 --> 2:43:01.240]  in danger because they're exposing themselves and uncloaking to try to get
[2:43:01.240 --> 2:43:04.720]  away with this that's why they're trying to parade in the open with fake
[2:43:04.720 --> 2:43:09.040]  confidence so so the globalists don't think they're invincible that's key
[2:43:09.040 --> 2:43:13.440]  information finish the devil Messiah system I mean it what is the devil
[2:43:13.440 --> 2:43:18.000]  Messiah just the total spiritual takeover the devil's Messiah is their
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:22.640]  method and the latest one that was given to me was the European Union and the
[2:43:22.640 --> 2:43:27.400]  fact of the 10 toes and it they embarrass so many ministers I mean big name
[2:43:27.400 --> 2:43:32.520]  to cross America who said this was the fulfillment of the book of Daniel and
[2:43:32.520 --> 2:43:37.440]  Revelation and all the world they were doing was an intentional program of
[2:43:37.440 --> 2:43:41.400]  embarrassment of the ministers of America another expression that we used
[2:43:41.400 --> 2:43:45.760]  him recently he said the elite planned on everything in America or you can
[2:43:45.760 --> 2:43:50.120]  readily understand how this can be if we bail out the mortgage back security
[2:43:50.120 --> 2:43:56.560]  problem and the elite takeover every piece of mortgage real estate in America
[2:43:56.560 --> 2:44:00.760]  whether it commercial or residential and you'll be making your payment to the
[2:44:00.760 --> 2:44:05.080]  Federal Reserve you'll see this happen shortly again I can't stress enough to
[2:44:05.080 --> 2:44:10.240]  you folks I plead with you get every piece of gold and silver you can get
[2:44:10.240 --> 2:44:16.760]  your hands on you haven't seen anything yet if you think gold at $1,400 an ounce
[2:44:16.760 --> 2:44:21.200]  is high what are you gonna say when it's $3,000 an ounce let's continue what are
[2:44:21.200 --> 2:44:25.040]  the other bullet points people need to know okay gasoline we already three
[2:44:25.040 --> 2:44:29.040]  dollars a gallon in Phoenix Arizona you go to go to $4 a gallon as quick as they
[2:44:29.040 --> 2:44:34.600]  can get it there again Russia and China this is America's greatest threat
[2:44:34.600 --> 2:44:40.480]  before Mr. Dodd Mr. Fromm died he went into details on this with me and I
[2:44:40.480 --> 2:44:44.160]  plan to make an entire presentation just of this sometimes in the future he
[2:44:44.160 --> 2:44:50.600]  said China is the big ones again and it lead us to knows how to be cured of
[2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:54.760]  cancer Mr. Fromm wouldn't build that route because he had a son who was a
[2:44:54.760 --> 2:44:59.560]  medical doctor he convinced him to take the okay so that's another issue what
[2:44:59.560 --> 2:45:03.400]  else what else was there that you couldn't tell folks that you can now tell
[2:45:03.400 --> 2:45:10.200]  them okay this basically all that the both of the points but the buzzwords of
[2:45:10.200 --> 2:45:14.240]  what are so important because they tell you everything of what the elite are
[2:45:14.240 --> 2:45:22.880]  going to do and because of that I have I have listed 12 things that you
[2:45:22.880 --> 2:45:27.720]  positively must do immediately in order to spare yourself in light of what
[2:45:27.720 --> 2:45:33.000]  these people have told me you've got to watch inside of trading oh my goodness
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:36.120]  people have you seen what's been happening there in the last few days of
[2:45:36.120 --> 2:45:41.280]  how inside of trading is going up so much the elite the CEOs the corporate
[2:45:41.280 --> 2:45:47.360]  heads they know what's coming and as a result inside of trading has just gone
[2:45:47.360 --> 2:45:52.760]  to unbelievable heights that the very latest one that was recorded here was
[2:45:52.760 --> 2:45:57.920]  November the 15th through the 19th inside of trading went to 8,280 to
[2:45:57.920 --> 2:46:02.760]  1 do you realize they have the CEOs of the corporate heads are bailing out because
[2:46:02.760 --> 2:46:06.080]  they know what mr. prom told me back a year or two ago and they're just
[2:46:06.080 --> 2:46:09.800]  beginning to see it and they're cashing out for everything they're worth but
[2:46:09.800 --> 2:46:14.560]  yet you'll you'll poker will still try to get you into the New York stock
[2:46:14.560 --> 2:46:21.160]  bucket that's right and and Lindsay again this is important what because you
[2:46:21.160 --> 2:46:25.160]  know think there's so many points we're moving fast here what else because you
[2:46:25.160 --> 2:46:30.440]  said there was a lot of stuff what else did Ken from tell you that you couldn't
[2:46:30.440 --> 2:46:35.240]  talk about until he was dead and buried okay I'll give you a few pointers and
[2:46:35.240 --> 2:46:41.280]  each one of these could at least take an hour on the Arab world he went into
[2:46:41.280 --> 2:46:47.640]  depth into the Muslims she had and the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia
[2:46:47.640 --> 2:46:52.560]  again he has gone into depth with me in the lengthy conference what is he saying
[2:46:52.560 --> 2:46:56.080]  briefly is going to happen there and we'll have you back soon but what did he
[2:46:56.080 --> 2:47:01.640]  say briefly that's going to happen there in where now in the Arab world what was
[2:47:01.640 --> 2:47:06.360]  the big key thing there well of course they brought the price of crude oil down
[2:47:06.360 --> 2:47:10.080]  and he told me why they did that and it was in order to put some of these
[2:47:10.080 --> 2:47:14.400]  countries into a certain position where they wanted them and now of course they
[2:47:14.400 --> 2:47:18.480]  have lowered the value of the dollar to the point that even though they may get
[2:47:18.480 --> 2:47:22.960]  a hundred two hundred fifty dollars a barrel for their oil they're still getting in purchasing
[2:47:22.960 --> 2:47:26.720]  power as far as the American dollar which they're locked into and they can't get
[2:47:26.720 --> 2:47:30.800]  out of it Russia and China can get out of use of the American dollar but Saudi
[2:47:30.800 --> 2:47:35.960]  Arabia the and the of those countries over there they can't get out of this
[2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:39.160]  because they were locked into it according to Henry Kissinger back many
[2:47:39.160 --> 2:47:42.880]  years ago and the agreement that he made with them so as a result even though
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:46.760]  they may get a hundred fifty dollars a barrel for their oil they'll still only
[2:47:46.760 --> 2:47:50.000]  be getting about fifty dollars in purchasing power of the American
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:55.800]  dollar I mean this is so startling to understand the inside workings of all
[2:47:55.800 --> 2:48:01.360]  of this as to how they're doing it amazing any other bullet points well
[2:48:01.360 --> 2:48:07.040]  yes he's going into Iran Iraq and Afghanistan he made it very plain that
[2:48:07.040 --> 2:48:12.280]  why we in Afghanistan and the agreement that was made by Henry Kissinger with
[2:48:12.280 --> 2:48:17.200]  back in years ago and Iran and Iraq wouldn't go along with it and as a
[2:48:17.200 --> 2:48:22.360]  result of it was intentionally done that we went and they did what we did to our
[2:48:22.360 --> 2:48:30.480]  rack we just haven't been able to do it to Iran yet let's see he's going into
[2:48:30.480 --> 2:48:37.200]  into depth about the world order and George Herbert Bush daddy Bush again
[2:48:37.200 --> 2:48:41.800]  he's going into depth about the devil's Messiah again he went into some depth
[2:48:41.800 --> 2:48:45.840]  with me about America and the elitist and their most difficult challenge which
[2:48:45.840 --> 2:48:50.200]  is the United States of America surprising how much trouble they've had
[2:48:50.200 --> 2:48:55.480]  with America and with our presidents and of course they I know that well anyway
[2:48:55.480 --> 2:48:59.200]  I'll go into this president president because that's subject within itself
[2:48:59.200 --> 2:49:05.120]  Gull Island the audit wildlife refuge the back and reserve and how that we would
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:10.160]  not have to take one drop of oil from any foreign country if we would just use
[2:49:10.160 --> 2:49:13.760]  what's on our own soil and of course he was the one that gave me the
