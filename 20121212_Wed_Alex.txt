[00:00.000 --> 00:09.640]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.640 --> 00:10.640]  You want answers?
[00:10.640 --> 00:12.640]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.640 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:45.840]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:45.840 --> 00:56.280]  Steve Newport's Alzheimer's disease has slowed considerably.
[00:56.280 --> 01:02.000]  Some of his symptoms even reversed, thanks to an unlikely treatment prescribed by his
[01:02.000 --> 01:10.240]  wife, Dr. Mary Newport, a physician who runs a neonatology ward at a Tampa, Florida hospital.
[01:10.240 --> 01:16.480]  He became determined to help her husband after he failed the so-called Alzheimer's clock
[01:16.480 --> 01:17.720]  test.
[01:17.720 --> 01:23.200]  He drew a few little circles and several numbers, just in a very random pattern, didn't really
[01:23.200 --> 01:25.200]  look anything like a clock.
[01:25.200 --> 01:28.680]  And the doctor pulled me aside and she said, you know, he's actually on the verge of severe
[01:28.680 --> 01:32.120]  Alzheimer's at this point, he's beyond moderate.
[01:32.120 --> 01:35.480]  So that was very, very devastating news.
[01:35.480 --> 01:41.200]  Dr. Newport began learning everything she could about her husband's disease.
[01:41.200 --> 01:44.960]  It appears to be a type of diabetes of the brain.
[01:44.960 --> 01:49.440]  And it's a process that starts happening at least 10 or 20 years before you start having
[01:49.440 --> 01:50.440]  symptoms.
[01:50.440 --> 01:56.600]  And it's very similar to type one or type two diabetes in that you develop a problem
[01:56.600 --> 01:57.960]  with insulin.
[01:57.960 --> 02:04.920]  In this case, insulin problems prevent brain cells from accepting glucose, their primary
[02:04.920 --> 02:06.520]  fuel.
[02:06.520 --> 02:09.480]  Without it, the cells eventually die.
[02:09.480 --> 02:16.520]  But there is an alternative fuel, ketones, which the cells easily accept.
[02:16.520 --> 02:22.000]  Ketones are metabolized in the liver after you eat medium chain triglycerides, which
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.600]  are found in coconut oil.
[02:24.600 --> 02:29.280]  So Dr. Newport added coconut oil to Steve's diet.
[02:29.280 --> 02:35.680]  Just two weeks later, he took the clock test again and as you can see demonstrated stunning
[02:35.680 --> 02:37.160]  improvement.
[02:37.160 --> 02:39.680]  I thought at the time, was it just good luck?
[02:39.680 --> 02:41.400]  Was it a lot of prayer?
[02:41.400 --> 02:44.200]  Was it the coconut oil?
[02:44.200 --> 02:48.000]  And I thought, well, we're going to keep the coconut oil going.
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.880]  Then three weeks later, he took the clock test a third time and continued to get better.
[02:54.880 --> 03:00.680]  It wasn't just intellectually, he also improved emotionally and physically.
[03:00.680 --> 03:03.440]  He was not able to run, he was able to run again.
[03:03.440 --> 03:08.200]  He couldn't read for about a year and a half, but after somewhere around two or three months,
[03:08.200 --> 03:09.200]  he was able to read.
[03:09.200 --> 03:14.320]  Instead of being very sluggish, not talking very much in the morning, he would come out
[03:14.320 --> 03:19.760]  with energy and talkative and joking and he could find his water and his utensils.
[03:19.760 --> 03:25.360]  Dr. Newport documented Steve's success in a book called Alzheimer's Disease.
[03:25.360 --> 03:27.160]  What if there was a cure?
[03:27.160 --> 03:32.400]  She received this stack of thank you letters from other people whose loved ones Alzheimer's
[03:32.400 --> 03:36.760]  was helped after they followed Steve's diet.
[03:36.760 --> 03:43.080]  And while coconut oil is encouraging, there's actually something much more powerful.
[03:43.080 --> 03:49.320]  A team of biochemists led by Professor Kieran Clark at England's Oxford University have
[03:49.320 --> 03:56.120]  developed a ketone ester that packs a punch 10 times greater than coconut oil.
[03:56.120 --> 04:02.080]  It reaches quite considerably higher levels and you can get whatever levels you want depending
[04:02.080 --> 04:03.680]  on how much you drink.
[04:03.680 --> 04:08.720]  The problem is they need millions of dollars to mass produce it.
[04:08.720 --> 04:14.080]  Very expensive and so we can't make very much of it ourselves and what we would like is
[04:14.080 --> 04:19.680]  funding so that we could actually scale up and make it but of course there's no real
[04:19.680 --> 04:23.160]  profit in manufacturing stuff like that.
[04:23.160 --> 04:26.640]  You know I heard part of that on the Sunday night radio show and I thought I'd just air
[04:26.640 --> 04:34.680]  it again here in this little no man's land first five minutes of the broadcast today.
[04:34.680 --> 04:36.360]  We're going to be here for the next three hours.
[04:36.360 --> 04:44.840]  We have quite a broadcast lined up for you today and it is Wednesday the 12th day of
[04:44.840 --> 04:47.160]  December 2012.
[04:47.160 --> 04:51.400]  I am your host and I'll just break it all down on the other side.
[04:51.400 --> 05:01.400]  Please stay with us.
[05:01.400 --> 05:05.920]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[05:05.920 --> 05:06.920]  storm.
[05:06.920 --> 05:11.240]  The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought
[05:11.240 --> 05:16.120]  in agricultural history and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[05:16.120 --> 05:19.400]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[05:19.400 --> 05:23.800]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect and I recommend you do the
[05:23.800 --> 05:24.800]  same.
[05:24.800 --> 05:27.320]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[05:27.320 --> 05:30.960]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[05:30.960 --> 05:35.360]  I'm taking control of my future and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[05:35.360 --> 05:39.400]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials and you can start with
[05:39.400 --> 05:43.120]  a holiday gift pack that's normally $80 now under 50 bucks.

[05:57.880 --> 05:59.680]  forward slash Alex.
[05:59.680 --> 06:04.520]  If you've ever wanted to be able to produce boiling hot water anytime anywhere with absolutely
[06:04.520 --> 06:08.480]  no power whatsoever then this is going to be the most important message you'll ever
[06:08.480 --> 06:09.480]  hear.
[06:09.480 --> 06:10.480]  Here's why.
[06:10.480 --> 06:13.200]  There's a brand new self-reliance product available that makes producing piping hot
[06:13.200 --> 06:16.120]  water in any emergency fast and easy.
[06:16.120 --> 06:18.520]  Introducing the hot water rocket from Solutions from Science.
[06:18.520 --> 06:22.920]  The hot water rocket is lightweight, extremely durable and generates boiling hot water using
[06:22.920 --> 06:23.920]  only the sun.
[06:23.920 --> 06:25.600]  Simply add water and place outside.
[06:25.600 --> 06:29.640]  Whether you're in the aftermath of a hurricane and have lost your power, hunting in a remote
[06:29.640 --> 06:33.680]  area or hiking on one of your favorite trails, the hot water rocket will be one of the most
[06:33.680 --> 06:36.520]  important pieces of survival equipment you'll ever own.

[06:44.000 --> 06:48.120]  from store shelves in a crisis, a $50 value free with your order.
[06:48.120 --> 06:52.440]  The hot water rocket makes an ideal Christmas present and is now cyber-priced at one half
[06:52.440 --> 06:54.000]  off while supplies last.
[06:54.000 --> 07:00.360]  For piping hot water whenever you need it go to hotwaterrocket.com, that's hotwaterrocket.com.
[07:00.360 --> 07:05.080]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[07:05.080 --> 07:07.120]  immunity and health.
[07:07.120 --> 07:11.720]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of
[07:11.720 --> 07:13.880]  silver-based products.
[07:13.880 --> 07:19.560]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce nano-silver solutions, our 2-ounce
[07:19.560 --> 07:24.960]  nano-silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[07:24.960 --> 07:28.960]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[07:28.960 --> 07:33.600]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and
[07:33.600 --> 07:35.920]  leave the silver at the surface.
[07:35.920 --> 07:40.400]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry
[07:40.400 --> 07:45.600]  of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more
[07:45.600 --> 07:47.320]  effectively.

[07:53.840 --> 07:56.040]  are best for you.
[07:56.040 --> 08:03.040]  Visit www.silverlungs.com.
[08:27.040 --> 08:30.040]  Who are they?
[08:30.040 --> 08:34.040]  They are the Dark Armies.
[08:34.040 --> 08:40.040]  The Dark Murdering Armies was only honored as atrocities.
[08:40.040 --> 08:48.040]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[08:48.040 --> 08:58.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jenner Show.
[08:58.040 --> 09:03.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this 12th day of December 2012.
[09:03.040 --> 09:12.040]  It is Wednesday and we are going to be joined by a researcher and a Syrian, known as Syrian
[09:12.040 --> 09:13.040]  girl.
[09:13.040 --> 09:17.040]  And she's been talking to us over the last year about our government here in the United
[09:17.040 --> 09:26.040]  States and European governments via NATO launching al-Qaeda operations in Libya and now Syria.
[09:26.040 --> 09:35.040]  Now, thanks to McClatchy newspapers and then the Drudge Report, in the last week, this
[09:35.040 --> 09:40.040]  has been forced out into the news.
[09:40.040 --> 09:44.040]  Very exciting information.
[09:44.040 --> 09:49.040]  Because if we don't get this information out, they're going to be able to overthrow country
[09:49.040 --> 09:54.040]  after country and put jihadists into them and then use the jihadists as a threat against
[09:54.040 --> 09:55.040]  the West.
[09:55.040 --> 10:02.040]  And the government can use that pretext to take our basic liberties and our basic freedoms.
[10:02.040 --> 10:09.040]  So that is coming up in about 30 minutes here on the broadcast today.
[10:09.040 --> 10:14.040]  Again, there is so much important news that it makes my head spin.
[10:14.040 --> 10:23.040]  We're also going to be premiering a news report that we have compiled here where we were able
[10:23.040 --> 10:26.040]  to hack a drone.
[10:26.040 --> 10:35.040]  Now, this is obviously very, very important because everything in this society is going
[10:35.040 --> 10:40.040]  to be taken over by the government.
[10:40.040 --> 10:47.040]  The government's answer is to bring more government control and basically let them have overrides
[10:47.040 --> 10:52.040]  of all electronics and machinery so that the, quote, terrorist can't get control, but we
[10:52.040 --> 10:55.040]  know who really runs the government and that is the terrorist.
[10:55.040 --> 11:01.040]  Also, something that only made local news we've checked and so we're breaking it down
[11:01.040 --> 11:05.040]  nationally and internationally right now.
[11:05.040 --> 11:09.040]  Media ignores bombing of social security building.
[11:09.040 --> 11:15.040]  Alleged terrorist helped U.S. in uprising against Saddam Hussein.
[11:15.040 --> 11:18.040]  This has black ops written all over it.
[11:18.040 --> 11:24.040]  The Oklahoma City Building attack clearly had some Iraqis involved at certain levels of it.
[11:24.040 --> 11:26.040]  That even came out in local news.
[11:26.040 --> 11:31.040]  Clinton had brought it into the country.
[11:31.040 --> 11:37.040]  That even made the L.A. Times and the Washington Times back in 1995, 1996.
[11:37.040 --> 11:44.040]  And Paul Watson links to some of those articles and reports in some of the previous reports
[11:44.040 --> 11:46.040]  he's done on Oklahoma City.
[11:46.040 --> 11:52.040]  And the film that I'm in that's excellent that we sell, a noble lie at m4store.com.
[11:52.040 --> 11:58.040]  Now, that said, just to finish up the serious situation ahead of that guest joining us,
[11:58.040 --> 12:01.040]  because I didn't really finish my point, which I tend to do.
[12:01.040 --> 12:05.040]  I jumped from issue to issue.
[12:05.040 --> 12:12.040]  We started hammering this on the Libya front and then on the Syria front that the West
[12:12.040 --> 12:13.040]  was using Al Qaeda.
[12:13.040 --> 12:20.040]  We really do get the credit for getting the journalist on like Dr. Webster Griff in Tarpley
[12:20.040 --> 12:27.040]  who actually traveled to Libya under bombardment and people like former NSA officer on the
[12:27.040 --> 12:32.040]  show, Wayne Madsen, who also traveled over there to Syria as well.
[12:32.040 --> 12:37.040]  So to Tarpley under fire in the case of Tarpley in Syria.
[12:37.040 --> 12:40.040]  This goes back 20 months ago.
[12:40.040 --> 12:41.040]  We first started reporting it.
[12:41.040 --> 12:45.040]  So we can say we've been proven right yet again.
[12:45.040 --> 12:54.040]  And now it is all over the news, the New York Times on Sunday, ABC News today.
[12:54.040 --> 13:01.040]  But if you've got to give final credit to forcing this out there, it is a Matt Drudge
[13:01.040 --> 13:02.040]  and DrudgeReport.com.
[13:02.040 --> 13:04.040]  And it is a bold move.
[13:04.040 --> 13:08.040]  And I would also say, you know, dangerous at certain levels, because the system did
[13:08.040 --> 13:09.040]  not want this out.
[13:09.040 --> 13:15.240]  We knew in Switzerland a year and a half ago where we had our reporters covering Bilderberg
[13:15.240 --> 13:22.960]  from our sources inside via multiple moles, I'll just leave it at that, that it was brought
[13:22.960 --> 13:31.520]  up in the official meeting that they were very upset that the BBC and even LA Times had
[13:31.520 --> 13:36.960]  picked up the fact that Al Qaeda was the main force being used in Libya.
[13:36.960 --> 13:40.840]  And that they talked about the alternative press and said, they're the ones pushing this
[13:40.840 --> 13:41.840]  out there.
[13:41.840 --> 13:42.840]  We want this shut down.
[13:42.840 --> 13:49.640]  And it was also a topic with heads of state at the Bilderberg group meeting in June of
[13:49.640 --> 13:51.720]  this year in Chantilly, Virginia.
[13:51.720 --> 13:55.560]  So this is a big deal, because let me explain something.
[13:55.560 --> 14:02.400]  If the fact that Western governments ran Al Qaeda, created Al Qaeda in 79, used them against
[14:02.400 --> 14:07.240]  the Russians, used them against the Serbs in the 90s, used them to at least take the
[14:07.240 --> 14:11.760]  blame and the cover for 9-11 as a pretext to attack all these countries that nothing
[14:11.760 --> 14:18.240]  could do with it like Iraq and take our liberties, give the myth of Al Qaeda dies.
[14:18.240 --> 14:21.080]  Their whole new world order police state takeover dies.
[14:21.080 --> 14:24.800]  That's why they're trying to segue 11 years later and saying, we're done with Al Qaeda.
[14:24.800 --> 14:25.880]  They're not the threat.
[14:25.880 --> 14:26.880]  It's the gun owners.
[14:26.880 --> 14:27.880]  It's the conservatives.
[14:27.880 --> 14:28.880]  It's the libertarians.
[14:28.880 --> 14:29.880]  It's the returning veterans.
[14:29.880 --> 14:38.640]  You know, that was classified five years ago, leaked four years ago to us, highly restricted,
[14:38.640 --> 14:40.520]  not classified at the time we got it.
[14:40.520 --> 14:43.960]  Of course, we'd already reverse engineered it and told you from the training that that
[14:43.960 --> 14:45.480]  was already going on a decade ago.
[14:45.480 --> 14:51.240]  But they use Al Qaeda as the simulant to get you to give up your rights as the cover story
[14:51.240 --> 14:52.240]  of the enemy.
[14:52.240 --> 14:56.680]  Then they remove that curtain and there is the real object of the globalist takeover,
[14:56.680 --> 15:00.960]  for us, the American people, the people of Europe, the people of the once wealthy Western
[15:00.960 --> 15:07.680]  societies of the Renaissance and of the Enlightenment and of the Magna Carta and of the flower of
[15:07.680 --> 15:17.920]  the human revolution at the time, the 1776 Declaration of Independence in America.
[15:17.920 --> 15:26.480]  So here's the headlines, Obama moves to undercut Assad, but warns of extremist ties to Al Qaeda
[15:26.480 --> 15:29.920]  and they're now is actually saying we've got to take over Syria.
[15:29.920 --> 15:33.200]  We told you this would happen because Al Qaeda is there.
[15:33.200 --> 15:37.840]  Yes, we've got to attack because Al Qaeda might use gas and then they know the general
[15:37.840 --> 15:42.760]  public Assad Al Qaeda sounds the same, can't find Syria on a map.
[15:42.760 --> 15:45.760]  Most people I've talked to think of the Middle East is in Central Asia.
[15:45.760 --> 15:47.720]  They think Afghanistan is the Middle East.
[15:47.720 --> 15:50.440]  I mean, it's just Assad is now Al Qaeda.
[15:50.440 --> 15:56.520]  Our criminal government has been launching a 21 month attack blowing up police stations,
[15:56.520 --> 16:00.440]  but just mass killing.
[16:00.440 --> 16:02.040]  And this is now going on.
[16:02.040 --> 16:06.520]  So it's finally all over the news and we're going to be breaking that down.
[16:06.520 --> 16:11.560]  I recorded the police this morning with state police when I was up pulled over with my son.
[16:11.560 --> 16:15.040]  Well, I take to work about two days a week with me now he's homeschooled and he's learning
[16:15.040 --> 16:17.480]  TV editing and everything as he wants to do it.
[16:17.480 --> 16:20.520]  It's his idea over the objections of his mother.
[16:20.520 --> 16:21.520]  So we've kind of compromised.
[16:21.520 --> 16:25.080]  That's why we're not releasing his name or anything yet, but he's very talented, very
[16:25.080 --> 16:26.080]  smart.
[16:26.080 --> 16:30.480]  Every parent says that, but my son is a particularly immersed in him.
[16:30.480 --> 16:34.840]  He reads college level text on history now because that's what he likes.
[16:34.840 --> 16:40.080]  He also likes comic books, but he is a chip off the old block and then some.
[16:40.080 --> 16:44.520]  But he's with me this morning and every day on the certain such a highway, there are state
[16:44.520 --> 16:48.040]  police and Austin police and it's 65.
[16:48.040 --> 16:53.280]  It goes from 50 to 65 and I have to constantly and you can't use cruise control because there's
[16:53.280 --> 16:56.440]  people coming on the highway, slowing down, speeding up.
[16:56.440 --> 17:04.640]  And I think at my core, I was mad and a little bit argumentative or preachy is the word to
[17:04.640 --> 17:12.200]  the state police trooper because of the fact that you can work as hard as you can.
[17:12.200 --> 17:16.160]  They will still give you a ticket every few years going down a hill or getting on a highway
[17:16.160 --> 17:17.560]  where you got to speed up to get on it.
[17:17.560 --> 17:22.280]  I mean, they know where to get, where people are coming down a big hill, they now give
[17:22.280 --> 17:28.680]  you tickets, five miles over the speed limit or going up a hill and your white glove inspected.
[17:28.680 --> 17:32.440]  That's a West Point term of coming with a white glove to find any dirt under any surfaces.
[17:32.440 --> 17:35.240]  And then you get demerits and get in trouble.
[17:35.240 --> 17:36.640]  We are white glove inspected.
[17:36.640 --> 17:40.240]  So this guy pulls me over up on the big overpass.
[17:40.240 --> 17:44.520]  So I've got to get off and I pull over and he comes over and he obviously knows who I
[17:44.520 --> 17:45.520]  am.
[17:45.520 --> 17:48.920]  He's looking at me and he starts asking, is this really your address and stuff like
[17:48.920 --> 17:49.920]  that?
[17:49.920 --> 17:51.240]  And I'm like, look, I'm not answering your 20 questions.
[17:51.240 --> 17:53.840]  I'm not the one here that's under suspicion.
[17:53.840 --> 17:57.280]  You work for an illegitimate government that ships in the narcotics.
[17:57.280 --> 18:01.720]  I go, I know you're ordered to let the illegal aliens go for drunk driving and no insurance
[18:01.720 --> 18:02.720]  and speeding.
[18:02.720 --> 18:04.880]  And he goes, he goes, and this is after I shoot him out.
[18:04.880 --> 18:06.160]  He goes, no, I know it's true.
[18:06.160 --> 18:08.640]  I don't like it.
[18:08.640 --> 18:09.640]  You don't like it.
[18:09.640 --> 18:10.640]  You don't know it's true.
[18:10.640 --> 18:13.920]  I mean, every cop I talk to admits this all over the country.
[18:13.920 --> 18:16.320]  And that's what's so ridiculous about this.
[18:16.320 --> 18:19.240]  It's not that I don't want to kick it.
[18:19.240 --> 18:21.720]  It's that the government ships the drugs in.
[18:21.720 --> 18:25.400]  They're putting microphones and cameras up in street lights all over the country.
[18:25.400 --> 18:27.480]  The NSA spies on us without warrants.
[18:27.480 --> 18:32.440]  And I said, you know, the Texas Youth Commission, you know, has giant child rape rings that
[18:32.440 --> 18:35.480]  make Sandusky look like a choir boy.
[18:35.480 --> 18:38.000]  And his eyes get bigger and bigger.
[18:38.000 --> 18:44.560]  And I go, but I want my ticket and give it to me, okay?
[18:44.560 --> 18:48.160]  And so I went through all this because I said, I said, just in case you get pleasure off
[18:48.160 --> 18:52.320]  your little hunting instinct, hunting people, and I know you've got, oh, by the way, the
[18:52.320 --> 18:54.080]  police are always saying they don't have quotas.
[18:54.080 --> 18:55.080]  That's a complete lie.
[18:55.080 --> 18:56.520]  It's come out in court cases.
[18:56.520 --> 19:00.480]  You don't get promoted and you don't get raises and you don't get bonuses if you don't
[19:00.480 --> 19:01.480]  write tickets.
[19:01.480 --> 19:02.480]  Okay.
[19:02.480 --> 19:03.480]  It's revenue generation.
[19:03.480 --> 19:05.760]  And by the way, no amount of money will ever prop the country up.
[19:05.760 --> 19:07.040]  It's designed to collapse.
[19:07.040 --> 19:08.040]  I'm not holding that.
[19:08.040 --> 19:09.720]  And I said, enjoy your sodium fluoride.
[19:09.720 --> 19:13.240]  I said, be sure and give your kids vaccines so they'll die because I know you love the
[19:13.240 --> 19:14.240]  system.
[19:14.240 --> 19:16.920]  And the cop's like, he's looking at me like, well, I haven't done anything.
[19:16.920 --> 19:18.400]  That's the point.
[19:18.400 --> 19:19.960]  We're all under attack.
[19:19.960 --> 19:25.000]  You don't arrest illegal aliens if you do, they're released and you get demoted.
[19:25.000 --> 19:26.840]  And the cop, I couldn't believe it.
[19:26.840 --> 19:29.800]  The state troopers like, yeah, I know, I don't like it.
[19:29.800 --> 19:33.960]  I mean, my point is it's not that I don't want out of the ticket.
[19:33.960 --> 19:40.520]  It's that I am the mark and my taxes go up enough and I've, I've drive to work hundreds
[19:40.520 --> 19:43.480]  of times a year and never speed so I don't get the ticket.
[19:43.480 --> 19:47.360]  And they still got me one day because my son's sitting there talking to me and my wife's
[19:47.360 --> 19:50.720]  calling on the phone and I'm sitting there driving and went, you know, eight miles over
[19:50.720 --> 19:51.720]  the speed limit.
[19:51.720 --> 19:54.040]  And it's just, it's just, it's sick.
[19:54.040 --> 19:55.040]  It's sick.
[19:55.040 --> 19:56.960]  I'm going to finish up with this story when we get back.
[19:56.960 --> 19:57.960]  We'll be right back.
[19:57.960 --> 20:01.680]  Stay with us.
[20:01.680 --> 20:06.120]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[20:06.120 --> 20:07.120]  storm.
[20:07.120 --> 20:11.360]  The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought
[20:11.360 --> 20:13.160]  in agricultural history.
[20:13.160 --> 20:16.120]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[20:16.120 --> 20:19.400]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[20:19.400 --> 20:23.600]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from EatFoodsDirect and I recommend you do
[20:23.600 --> 20:24.600]  the same.
[20:24.600 --> 20:27.160]  It's time to get your own supply from EatFoodsDirect.

[21:57.600 --> 22:01.880]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[22:01.880 --> 22:03.000]  Answer this.
[22:03.000 --> 22:07.240]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into
[22:07.240 --> 22:11.840]  thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is
[22:11.840 --> 22:16.320]  recommended by many police departments and sells for less than $35?
[22:16.320 --> 22:18.680]  Yes, it's FAKE TV.
[22:18.680 --> 22:23.480]  This year about 1 in every 50 US homes will have a break in with burglars usually picking
[22:23.480 --> 22:27.520]  the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[22:27.520 --> 22:32.440]  FAKE TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching
[22:32.440 --> 22:35.520]  TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[22:35.520 --> 22:38.520]  It's like a lamp on a timer, but far more convincing.
[22:38.520 --> 22:43.240]  And for only $34.95, FAKE TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure
[22:43.240 --> 22:45.520]  house or one that's been ransacked.

[23:32.800 --> 23:37.040]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[23:37.040 --> 23:38.040]  to serve as debt.
[23:38.040 --> 23:41.560]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public
[23:41.560 --> 23:44.840]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[23:44.840 --> 23:49.160]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[23:49.160 --> 23:52.400]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[23:52.400 --> 24:22.200]  It's time to understand the system, call 800-686-2237, that's 800-686-2237.
[24:22.200 --> 24:43.000]  That's what's frustrating is that I'm driving to work and I'm thinking about the New World
[24:43.000 --> 24:50.640]  Order and how all over the country they're putting cameras and microphones in street
[24:50.640 --> 24:54.600]  lights listening to us, they're admitting that they're listening to us over our phones
[24:54.600 --> 24:57.800]  without warrants over our television sets.
[24:57.800 --> 25:03.680]  It's beyond 1984, I've got more news reports because I'm reading the news where I'm driving
[25:03.680 --> 25:07.560]  to work about forced inoculations all over the country, it's felonies every time the
[25:07.560 --> 25:09.160]  government does it.
[25:09.160 --> 25:14.080]  I was thinking about just how the March of Evil is everywhere and how they're about to
[25:14.080 --> 25:20.600]  bring the estate tax up to 80%, that'll get rid of most family farms, they're raising
[25:20.600 --> 25:28.360]  property tax everywhere, they will destroy this country, that's not rhetoric and I was
[25:28.360 --> 25:32.000]  actually thinking about how they're using illegal aliens to bankrupt the country because
[25:32.000 --> 25:39.600]  they get free kidneys, free healthcare, free housing, all the perks that citizens don't
[25:39.600 --> 25:44.600]  even get to have an incentive to bring in massive third world populations and how just
[25:44.600 --> 25:49.040]  illegitimate the whole thing is and I get pulled over.
[25:49.040 --> 25:53.960]  When the guy comes up and he starts his little investigation thing and I just said, that's
[25:53.960 --> 25:58.960]  not it, I'm not talking to you, you're illegitimate, give me your ticket for revenue generation
[25:58.960 --> 26:02.720]  and I said you'll never see your pension fund and you're going to be poor and your whole
[26:02.720 --> 26:05.640]  family is going to live in squalor.
[26:05.640 --> 26:10.600]  Just remember that, okay, because this is what, this is the train we're on, totally illegitimate,
[26:10.600 --> 26:14.440]  the government sticking their hands down our pants to fly when the government runs all
[26:14.440 --> 26:19.760]  kind of publicly, the government staged 9-11, okay, the criminals that run our country staged
[26:19.760 --> 26:24.240]  it, okay, they blew up building 7 in front of everybody and had the police say get back
[26:24.240 --> 26:28.920]  they're blowing it up and instead we never said that, okay, they announced it fell an
[26:28.920 --> 26:34.160]  hour before it fell on TV, just like they announced Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK before
[26:34.160 --> 26:39.280]  he was even arrested in the foreign news because they got their time zones off for his name
[26:39.280 --> 26:44.160]  was even, I mean it's all staged and I'm sick of it and I'm tired of it, I'm tired, we've
[26:44.160 --> 26:48.320]  got to divorce ourselves from this system and we've got to say you're illegitimate
[26:48.320 --> 26:54.120]  and you're criminal, that's the only hope we've got and I'm up here risking my life
[26:54.120 --> 26:59.360]  to do this and you know, I got to be honest about once a year I get pulled over by the
[26:59.360 --> 27:03.880]  state police and they're usually, well you were so nice I'm going to give you a warning
[27:03.880 --> 27:07.400]  to my son and I haven't recorded after the cop leaves he goes man you were never like
[27:07.400 --> 27:11.000]  that, he's been in the car with me four or five times we've been pulled over and I said
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.400]  I'm just sick of it and he goes well daddy are you mad because of the ticket and I said
[27:16.400 --> 27:23.360]  no, what a hundred bucks or something, no that's not what I'm mad about, I said I'm
[27:23.360 --> 27:28.800]  mad and he goes I understand you're mad because it's hypocritical and I go that's right it's
[27:28.800 --> 27:34.280]  a double standard, I am the lowest form of garbage to the government, I am seen as a
[27:34.280 --> 27:39.680]  big fat milk cow for these vampires to suck off of and their answer is well we're keeping
[27:39.680 --> 27:45.120]  law in order, no you're not, you're out there revenue generating, our state is illegally
[27:45.120 --> 27:49.360]  handing the roads over and it's illegal federal and state law, there's the state laws against
[27:49.360 --> 27:54.080]  it they're still doing it, red light cameras are against the law, been thrown out of court
[27:54.080 --> 27:57.760]  they're still going in, the foreign companies running our toll roads and taking over existing
[27:57.760 --> 28:02.200]  roads, illegal they're doing it, I've been there at the state house hearings, all of
[28:02.200 --> 28:08.840]  it's illegal, I've had enough, listen, I pulled up at my office because an alarm was going
[28:08.840 --> 28:17.720]  off and I was eating dinner nearby, no no that was another time the cops came over here,
[28:17.720 --> 28:22.320]  my IT guy was over here as a server was down that's what it was and I pulled up and the
[28:22.320 --> 28:27.080]  police had him out and said well we saw him turn into this office park so we thought it
[28:27.080 --> 28:31.600]  was suspicious and his driver's license expired we're taking him to jail, I said you can do
[28:31.600 --> 28:35.960]  that and they go we arrest people for no seat belts now, it's all this maximum enforcement
[28:35.960 --> 28:39.740]  and I said if he was an illegal alien he'd let him go wouldn't he, he goes yep the judges
[28:39.740 --> 28:45.360]  just let him go so we're told to, I had like four cops they were all by the way all listeners
[28:45.360 --> 28:48.480]  oh I heard your show last week that was real good, I'm retiring next week have you heard
[28:48.480 --> 28:52.560]  about my rock band such and such and I'm sitting there on them but you're taking him to jail
[28:52.560 --> 28:58.120]  well that's just what we do, so they even selectively which is illegal under common
[28:58.120 --> 29:08.080]  law enforce admit it to you, I got the cop today the state trooper on tape and you know

[33:31.360 --> 33:36.560]  here finishing up I I will air the audio we've got so many special reports like six or seven
[33:36.560 --> 33:40.120]  of them in the queue that are being finished right now that it probably won't even air
[33:40.120 --> 33:48.520]  this week but it's about nine minutes of audio with myself schooling the state trooper who's
[33:48.520 --> 33:51.800]  like well why are you know basically didn't say a word but you know the body language
[33:51.800 --> 33:57.040]  is why are you being mean to me and I was not being mean to him I am sick of it and
[33:57.040 --> 34:02.560]  I am fed up with it and I'm tired of it the government is illegitimate and spies on me
[34:02.560 --> 34:08.200]  without warrants the state of Texas is a criminal operation at the top compared to some states
[34:08.200 --> 34:14.560]  it's nothing and there's just all sorts of government lawlessness going on and the and
[34:14.560 --> 34:18.320]  the police and the feds will come up and say you can't videotape them on the street and
[34:18.320 --> 34:24.000]  threaten you with arrest it's all color of law garbage and they're jacking up our taxes
[34:24.000 --> 34:27.080]  people think that we got low taxes well I guess compared to some other states but they're
[34:27.080 --> 34:34.120]  going up going up on every front and I'm treated like garbage and every police officer I've
[34:34.120 --> 34:39.000]  talked to I've seen articles in the news where the feds all over the country this is going
[34:39.000 --> 34:44.520]  on for a decade will not when they arrest a van with 15 little aliens with liquor marijuana
[34:44.520 --> 34:49.800]  you name it they don't even arrest them now because the feds won't come pick them up and
[34:49.800 --> 34:56.640]  the judges collectively as a group of criminals give them $5 fines that I had one of the main
[34:56.640 --> 35:01.440]  prosecutors in Travis County come to my office not going to say names but it's one of the
[35:01.440 --> 35:05.920]  prosecutors and they wanted me to do this whole investigative behind the scenes report
[35:05.920 --> 35:10.760]  I'm too busy I already know this and they said the Travis County judges and the Austin
[35:10.760 --> 35:20.040]  judges give them what I already heard $5 fines for DWI if you if the cops arrest them see
[35:20.040 --> 35:23.280]  and then meanwhile this guy is going to give me a ticket for eight miles over the speed
[35:23.280 --> 35:28.400]  limit and it's and I sat there at first and just said here's your stuff till he started
[35:28.400 --> 35:32.600]  going is this your driver is this where you really live now I went oh we're starting the
[35:32.600 --> 35:37.720]  criminal investigation garbage here where you're going to try to milk something out of me I
[35:37.720 --> 35:43.320]  go you know who I am the guy looks at me by language yeah okay let's start right now you
[35:43.320 --> 35:48.960]  opened up that can of worms buddy boy and the thing is I'm not just sitting there telling
[35:48.960 --> 35:54.120]  that state troop or something there to make myself feel big I'm sick at my stomach I've
[35:54.120 --> 36:00.160]  got to debate my wife every week about escaping this country I've had to sign my kids on to
[36:00.160 --> 36:06.160]  go down with this country makes me sick it's all going to go down I start telling about
[36:06.160 --> 36:10.760]  the reeducation camps he had eyes like saucers hey state trooper they're setting them up
[36:10.760 --> 36:15.440]  the emergency centers establishment act the civilian in the labor camp program write
[36:15.440 --> 36:19.720]  it down investigate it set it right in tickets all day so you can get promoted and get a
[36:19.720 --> 36:23.360]  bigger bass boat why don't you go find out about all the rest of it once you find out
[36:23.360 --> 36:27.680]  about the army manuals with her reeducation camps why don't you find out about the police
[36:27.680 --> 36:31.680]  at the higher levels being trained that they're going to arrest patriots in this country when
[36:31.680 --> 36:36.640]  this country goes completely communist or the fascist group on top of it you see this
[36:36.640 --> 36:42.120]  is life and death this is and I resent the whole stinking system because it's a fraud
[36:42.120 --> 36:50.040]  and it's illegitimate it's simple if if you if they didn't arrest let's say illegal aliens
[36:50.040 --> 36:53.280]  for murder which they pretty much don't know they just let them do whatever they want most
[36:53.280 --> 36:57.600]  the time so the railway killer could kill dozens and get away with it and not ever get
[36:57.600 --> 37:02.280]  in trouble be released over and over again let's use that as an analogy and then I commit
[37:02.280 --> 37:06.000]  a murder and they go well we know Pedro here committed a murder but we're gonna let him
[37:06.000 --> 37:11.040]  go but you're gonna go to jail it's the same thing it's it's and it's not that I don't
[37:11.040 --> 37:16.520]  want a ticket for going eight miles over the speed limit you know I had my insurance right
[37:16.520 --> 37:20.000]  there in the glove compartment I gave an old one on purpose because I knew he had on his
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.160]  computer whether I had insurance or not and I knew when I got in his face he'd wrongfully
[37:24.160 --> 37:28.280]  with his computer system still give me the ticket so he did the wrong thing I got him
[37:28.280 --> 37:34.080]  to do the wrong thing now you gotta deal with God cop you understand that I'm the one that
[37:34.080 --> 37:39.520]  ran that situation I'm the one that played you like a fiddle you little robot because
[37:39.520 --> 37:44.560]  you were picked because you're a robot by the system and I don't like robots anyways excuse
[37:44.560 --> 37:49.800]  me I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen I'm sorry see people don't people understand this is
[37:49.800 --> 37:56.600]  real this broadcast okay this isn't an act up here I'm sick of it I need to settle down
[37:56.600 --> 38:05.840]  though just for 15 years all the new manufactured televisions have microphones inside of them
[38:05.840 --> 38:09.280]  the cable boxes everything they're listening to you they're tracking you and now they admit
[38:09.280 --> 38:13.680]  they are the government I'm gonna say this again puts cancer viruses in the vaccines
[38:13.680 --> 38:21.800]  and the cops are out there writing little old ladies tickets that's why I'm angry because
[38:21.800 --> 38:27.680]  I know those police by successive approximation incrementalism will do anything when the time
[38:27.680 --> 38:32.160]  comes they'll pull up with an armored vehicle and say come out with your hands up or we're
[38:32.160 --> 38:35.920]  gonna burn your house down that's that's the training for the future and if I don't they'll
[38:35.920 --> 38:41.600]  burn me and my family down like Waco and they'll say I burned myself and my family up and then
[38:41.600 --> 38:45.560]  they and and and that's how they'll deal with it and if I come they'll take me to a reeducation
[38:45.560 --> 38:51.880]  camp that's what all this is segueing into that's what the new Brad Pitt film is about
[38:51.880 --> 38:57.080]  why we've now read the book we've got a review coming out it'll be next week where the America
[38:57.080 --> 39:02.040]  communism they say Marxism is the way the American people are the number one enemy and
[39:02.040 --> 39:06.520]  must be hunted down and killed not the zombies they say in the book thank God for the zombies
[39:06.520 --> 39:11.800]  they help bring down the American people and they hunt down gun owners that have survived
[39:11.800 --> 39:18.800]  and you are the number one enemy to be murdered by the United Nations I mean it's every book
[39:18.800 --> 39:23.120]  every movie this is all they push it is so sick how they're priming everybody for this
[39:23.120 --> 39:27.840]  and the U.S. Army trains now to mow down quote zombie see if they train to mow down American
[39:27.840 --> 39:32.120]  citizens which I've actually got on tape before it becomes a controversy but now oh these are
[39:32.120 --> 39:36.720]  people wearing football jerseys and John Deere caps dressed like Americans but they're zombies
[39:36.720 --> 39:41.560]  it's a way to dehumanize and then simulate the killing and prepare that role it's all
[39:41.560 --> 39:47.800]  programming see and I know it you see I know it and I'm mad at the biological androids
[39:47.800 --> 39:52.640]  zombies if you would because it's a metaphor a revelation of the method where the establishment
[39:52.640 --> 39:57.760]  explained to you you're a zombie you're a zombie you know that cop was not a zombie
[39:57.760 --> 40:02.840]  actually and I'm and and you know I'm torn because I could tell he wasn't a bad person
[40:02.840 --> 40:07.480]  and I could tell that when I was sitting there chewing him out you know he didn't particularly
[40:07.480 --> 40:12.360]  like it and had this this victim complex where he's just doing his job and you know he's
[40:12.360 --> 40:16.400]  doesn't like everything that's happening and here I am being mean to him it's not about
[40:16.400 --> 40:24.840]  you buddy it's about your kids in the future of this country because if you will give me
[40:24.840 --> 40:30.200]  a ticket for going eight miles over the speed limit then you better arrest illegal aliens
[40:30.200 --> 40:34.040]  when they're drunk driving and you better arrest them when they've got illegal firearms
[40:34.040 --> 40:37.760]  and you and again it's not that I even dislike the illegal aliens but why are they above
[40:37.760 --> 40:41.240]  the law because the globalist I'm gonna hold Syria girl a little bit in the next hour I
[40:41.240 --> 40:48.840]  know her time it's like one in the morning it just makes me physically sick I was having
[40:48.840 --> 40:54.160]  an okay morning until this happened and now I am it physically sick because you know my
[40:54.160 --> 41:04.480]  son was there and and and it just makes me think about what a dirt bag country we were
[41:04.480 --> 41:09.080]  turning into when I love this country so much that this isn't freedom when the government
[41:09.080 --> 41:13.920]  can selectively enforce all over the nation they're giving children forced inoculations
[41:13.920 --> 41:18.880]  at schools elementary students and when parents find out when the kid has a convulsion or whatever
[41:18.880 --> 41:25.560]  that's usually in the news when it happens little Bobby ate you know had a had a convulsion
[41:25.560 --> 41:29.480]  doctors believe from the shot when the mother got to the hospital and demanded oh why she
[41:29.480 --> 41:33.400]  learned they'd given the shot they said that despite the fact that she hadn't signed the
[41:33.400 --> 41:38.080]  forms it was a mistake and then now it's like you know what it's not a mistake we're just
[41:38.080 --> 41:41.720]  gonna do it California law says we can other states where it's not even a law they just
[41:41.720 --> 41:48.080]  do it these are vicious pig like government scum these school administrators who are in
[41:48.080 --> 41:51.960]  there to get federal money injecting the kids because they're told by higher ups you'll
[41:51.960 --> 41:57.080]  be backed up it's a lawless group the government's one inch folks from just taking your bank
[41:57.080 --> 42:02.160]  accounts in your 401ks in fact under Obamacare they're starting to take 3.8% on top all the
[42:02.160 --> 42:08.800]  other taxes that's that's taxes on after taxes money we told you it's it's it's all gonna
[42:08.800 --> 42:13.960]  happen look if you don't have due process and if you don't have fair weights and balances
[42:13.960 --> 42:21.600]  the Bible talks about society collapses and this is what we're turning into and it disgusts
[42:21.600 --> 42:27.360]  me it disgusts me that in the future they'll just have a pickup list and they'll scan your
[42:27.360 --> 42:31.160]  license plate and they'll tell the cops all right arrest these people coming down this
[42:31.160 --> 42:35.400]  road and the cops will pull you over put you in handcuffs put you in their vehicle take
[42:35.400 --> 42:39.440]  you to a central facility the feds will get you put you in the back of a black van you're
[42:39.440 --> 42:43.600]  never seen again that's already going on by the way and so it's also the realization
[42:43.600 --> 42:49.880]  of if I stay in this country I'm getting down to the zone now where where where this is
[42:49.880 --> 42:57.360]  not a game and here's this cop who's so childlike it's like the general public is it just makes
[42:57.360 --> 43:02.520]  me physically ill I am physically nauseous right now from this because I can see where
[43:02.520 --> 43:07.240]  America is going I know what's gonna happen I know I'm right I want to turn it around
[43:07.240 --> 43:12.400]  I want things to get better and I know this is an evil abortion loving country and we're
[43:12.400 --> 43:18.200]  going to hell in a handbasket and the cops are gonna do whatever they're told yeah I
[43:18.200 --> 43:23.080]  don't like the fact illegal aliens I'm not allowed to arrest them or anything oh but
[43:23.080 --> 43:26.560]  you're gonna give me that ticket aren't you yep sure am here it is that's what they told
[43:26.560 --> 43:31.880]  me that's policy and it's policy that the Texas Youth Commission still gets to rape

[46:35.560 --> 46:44.080]  Syrian rebels once denied now key to anti Assad victories and then that force this was a week
[46:44.080 --> 46:48.160]  ago that force to drudge link to this and our articles and others and tweeted about
[46:48.160 --> 46:53.800]  it let's just give credit words to al Qaeda link group Syrian rebels wants to deny now
[46:53.800 --> 46:57.840]  key to anti Assad victories we told you this year and a half ago here it is a New York
[46:57.840 --> 47:07.960]  Times Syrian rebels tied to al Qaeda play key role in war and it continues here al Qaeda
[47:07.960 --> 47:14.120]  in Syria on and on and on so and then and then here's Obama today Obama moves to undercut
[47:14.120 --> 47:20.240]  Assad but warns of extremist ties to al Qaeda and a diplomatic shift president Obama said
[47:20.240 --> 47:24.720]  today's administration now formally recognizes the newly formed al Qaeda leading coalition
[47:24.720 --> 47:29.920]  of Syrian rebels who are fighting to topple Syria's and battled president Bashar Assad
[47:29.920 --> 47:32.840]  and Hillary's been saying that they need to invade because al Qaeda might take over you
[47:32.840 --> 47:36.600]  gotta love it you put al Qaeda in and you gotta invade because Assad's al Qaeda we made
[47:36.600 --> 47:41.360]  the decision that the Syrian opposition coalition is now inclusive enough is reflective and
[47:41.360 --> 47:44.720]  representative enough kind of like al Qaeda they put in charge of Libya of the Syrian
[47:44.720 --> 47:48.720]  population that we consider them the legitimate representatives of the Syrian people opposition
[47:48.720 --> 47:53.640]  to the Assad regime and they go on and then here's our article that was linked on drudge
[47:53.640 --> 47:59.000]  report commas link there now bold move to get this out to everybody Syrian rebels pledge
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.080]  allegiance to al Qaeda group that killed us troops and it's an admitted group that fought
[48:03.080 --> 48:08.120]  us troops in Iraq but that's okay they had to be put in as a simulant even though they
[48:08.120 --> 48:12.600]  were real people killing real troops that's part of the war part of the death is you've
[48:12.600 --> 48:17.000]  got to bring in al Qaeda to kill troops so we have an excuse to be there you pay off
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.680]  the Iraqi military to stand down then you fight al Qaeda but then actually double team
[48:21.680 --> 48:28.160]  use al Qaeda to attack the Shiites again this is the master plan it's called full spectrum
[48:28.160 --> 48:32.600]  dominance playing both sides or all sides so the point is this is broken we're going
[48:32.600 --> 48:36.040]  to break it a few minutes Syrian girl we're gonna give out your YouTube site and everything
[48:36.040 --> 48:39.480]  else so people can check out the great reportage you're doing everything you reported on a
[48:39.480 --> 48:45.560]  year ago has now been proven correct and you join us now to break down what's happening
[48:45.560 --> 48:49.880]  but the three minutes we have before you to break what do you make of them recognizing
[48:49.880 --> 48:54.680]  that al Qaeda is a legitimate government but then also saying oh but we need to go to Syria
[48:54.680 --> 48:57.920]  so al Qaeda doesn't get in charge what do you what do you make of these new developments
[48:57.920 --> 49:09.920]  are 22 months and you know it's so important and so crazy to think you know about first
[49:09.920 --> 49:16.520]  recognizes this group and says oh yeah this group is al Qaeda and then he goes and turns
[49:16.520 --> 49:22.480]  around and recognizes the Syrian rebels as the sole representatives of the Syrian people
[49:22.480 --> 49:28.800]  and as a Syrian it's it's quite disgusting for him to say that al Qaeda represents me
[49:28.800 --> 49:37.400]  and you know and then 29 groups of these Syrian rebels 29 groups turn around and say they pledge
[49:37.400 --> 49:45.080]  allegiance to the same group that Obama said was al Qaeda which is al Nusrah so it's basically
[49:45.080 --> 49:51.800]  saying that Obama is directly backing al Qaeda and there's no other way to go around it and
[49:51.800 --> 49:56.760]  I think you know we've said this many times as I come on your show and I just wanted to
[49:56.760 --> 50:02.000]  add a little bit about what people can do I know there's a petition going on right now
[50:02.000 --> 50:09.520]  that is trying to stop the US government from funding al Qaeda in Syria and this is what
[50:09.520 --> 50:14.680]  they've been repeating all the time I mean they didn't put them in Iraq of course there
[50:14.680 --> 50:21.520]  was a nationalist struggle against occupation there between both which was both Sunni and
[50:21.520 --> 50:28.760]  Al Qaeda and we started off as a secular movement but they had to inject al Qaeda in there to
[50:28.760 --> 50:34.400]  divide and conquer basically and to take the whole thing and let's be clear they're recognizing
[50:34.400 --> 50:39.480]  the admitted main al Qaeda group as the head government because there are 20 plus groups
[50:39.480 --> 50:45.000]  as you were saying the one headline is 99% of fighters are jihadist al Qaeda and they've
[50:45.000 --> 50:51.840]  now pledged allegiance to al Qaeda so we'll be right back with Syrian girl reporting on
[50:51.840 --> 50:56.680]  all this straight ahead and what it means that the US government trader in chief now
[50:56.680 --> 51:05.320]  endorses publicly al Qaeda hey there Frank Bates here have you heard about the weird
[51:05.320 --> 51:11.880]  device that could wipe out 280 million Americans this is really scary stuff defense experts
[51:11.880 --> 51:17.440]  warn that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known in fact just a few
[51:17.440 --> 51:21.560]  weeks ago former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington
[51:21.560 --> 51:26.240]  Post warning about this deadly threat I can't believe that more people aren't talking about
[51:26.240 --> 51:31.040]  this it may be because the liberals in the government are trying to cover it up that's
[51:31.040 --> 51:36.680]  why my friend just created a free video at weird device dot com that exposes this threat
[51:36.680 --> 51:42.160]  and blows the doors off a conspiracy go watch the shocking video at weird device dot com

[54:37.680 --> 54:42.160]  families before of sod came to power and they basically left the country over that so she's
[54:42.160 --> 54:48.760]  not a fan of a sod but watching al-qaeda brought in out of Saudi Arabia real al-qaeda blowing
[54:48.760 --> 54:54.520]  up churches killing minority muslim groups the forcing people to suicide bomb and and
[54:54.520 --> 55:01.440]  i want to explain something here it is mainstream news our article compiles all this with previous
[55:01.440 --> 55:08.040]  reports and drudge report dot com is linked to it it's still up there syrian rebels pledge
[55:08.040 --> 55:14.400]  allegiance to al-qaeda group that killed us troops petition demands obama stop supporting
[55:14.400 --> 55:20.120]  terrorist in syria and there's petitions against this now this all came to a head when the
[55:20.120 --> 55:24.800]  new york time started reporting on it and when drudge you forced it out there along
[55:24.800 --> 55:31.840]  with mclatchy so now he's he recognizes them in the face of the petition recognizes them
[55:31.840 --> 55:37.720]  they're giving them the weapons and so syrian girl slowly but but but but in the short segment
[55:37.720 --> 55:43.280]  for people go over for folks that just tuned in the name of this group what they're doing
[55:43.280 --> 55:46.920]  and how big a deal this is because you're still a syrian you know national you still
[55:46.920 --> 55:51.600]  would like to be able to go there i mean they're claiming that this group now represents you
[55:51.600 --> 55:57.240]  they're saying al-qaeda from saudi arabia foreign fighters on record that's not debated
[55:57.240 --> 56:00.920]  that they are your government they are your leaders and that they're gonna you know blow
[56:00.920 --> 56:08.240]  up some more mosques that's good thing well absolutely their name is jihad al-nusra but
[56:08.240 --> 56:12.160]  that's just only one group you know there's so many groups and they've all been committing
[56:12.160 --> 56:18.800]  heinous crimes just this week they is a video that came out where they forced a 10 year
[56:18.800 --> 56:25.840]  old child to be had two unarmed prisoners and at the moment there is a journalist called
[56:25.840 --> 56:32.600]  anhar koshnab she's ukrainian she's captured by them and they asked for a $50 million ransom
[56:32.600 --> 56:38.360]  or they're going to kill her tomorrow execute her so they're executing journalists they
[56:38.360 --> 56:42.240]  are bombing mosques there's videos of them bombing mosques and this might seem strange
[56:42.240 --> 56:49.200]  to people to hear that these islamic extremists are bombing mosques but then again you know
[56:49.200 --> 56:54.760]  they hate many sects of islam as well they don't like people who don't follow their exact
[56:54.760 --> 57:01.920]  sects um this is you know of course there are foreign fighters as well saudi arabia
[57:01.920 --> 57:08.760]  as you mentioned and i think that part of it part of the whole thing is to make um saudi
[57:08.760 --> 57:16.240]  arabia and qatar by arms from the us and send them to these uh terrorists so in a
[57:16.240 --> 57:22.400]  way it's war profiteering at the cost of the blood of the syrian people um i i do want
[57:22.400 --> 57:29.440]  to maybe after your break or whenever go through the reasons why behind syria is being attacked
[57:29.440 --> 57:41.480]  and why the new world order um sees syria as a threat or an obstacle to its agenda what
[57:41.480 --> 57:46.440]  do you what do you see this is signifying that they're now publicly recognizing the group
[57:46.440 --> 57:51.280]  and talking about ground troops do you still think it's just propaganda uh to disillusion
[57:51.280 --> 57:59.120]  the syrian military i think the prospect of ground troops definitely is going to be something
[57:59.120 --> 58:06.720]  after the u.s is sure that there's been enough defections enough terrorism that the syrian
[58:06.720 --> 58:13.400]  people are terrorized that the syrian military has broken up to the point that their finger
[58:13.400 --> 58:18.880]  is no longer on the trigger to all of syria's national differences i think that they're
[58:18.880 --> 58:25.160]  going to it's going to be a prolonged war so i think you know in the long term yes they
[58:25.160 --> 58:32.120]  do want to send troops in but maybe this will be after uh they succeed in this uh instruction
[58:32.120 --> 58:36.720]  and coup and then they'll say later that i will stay there i want to i want to get into
[58:36.720 --> 58:46.880]  uh saudi arabium this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[58:46.880 --> 58:56.280]  we have witnessed two terrible storms in the east but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[58:56.280 --> 59:01.280]  storm the most devastating economic conditions since the great depression america's worst
[59:01.280 --> 59:06.320]  drought in agricultural history and now the economic results of the presidential election

[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:32.960]  on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones we've now got al qaeda
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:40.240]  mercenary threatening to kill a u.s. journalist in syria i mean it's just getting insane
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:45.200]  syrian girl joins us she's lived in syria but doesn't live there now and has been giving
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.760]  us really accurate reportage her her microphone's a little bit revarby but she's changed
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:56.960]  mics she continues to be on the air with us again if you just tuned in our government
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.760]  of the obama has recognized al qaeda as the official government of syria please continue
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:12.280]  syrian girl with what you think this signifies um i think the new world order is a part of
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:17.720]  all this i think that uh they're trying to destroy secularism inside the middle east
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:24.280]  and probably this will lead to a clash of civilizations in the future i think um this
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:31.200]  is the end game and of course now they're saying two things at the same time that they're
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:35.760]  putting al qaeda as the representatives of the syrian people and at the same time later
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:40.960]  they might enter syria to get rid of al qaeda so this could be the situation where troops
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:47.440]  are coming onto the ground in syria for the short term i don't see this happening because
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:54.000]  i don't think that um they will be able to sustain the losses in the media uh it will
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.840]  be like the repeat of the iraq war and i don't think that uh the people are going to accept
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:07.920]  that in america right now um so if going on too if you'd like me to talk about why the
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:13.360]  new world order is against syria why does the new world order see syria as an obstacle
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.520]  that's what i want to do i want to go to break because this is a short segment and come back
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:23.280]  in a final long segment with you and get your breakdown of that and then also take a few calls
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:28.560]  if you have a question for syrian girl listeners we would love to hear from you a quick
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:34.320]  short questions we can get to a few of them a concise question they told free number to join
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:44.880]  us is 800-259-9231 800-2599-231 just on this geopolitical uh important issue but start getting
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.840]  into why the new world order wants to bring them down well for one thing uh they have no
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:59.040]  gross child central bank um there's bank was a state run they have no imf debt um and of course
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:05.920]  they are secular as i stated earlier and that's uh going to be a problem in the long term um they
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:13.120]  of course oppose the state of israel and that's a part of the whole uh new world order plan to
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:23.440]  create a clash of civilizations in the area but they oppose it not on a extremist ideology of
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:32.080]  hatred they oppose it on a nationalistic position so all of these reasons and more is why they see
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:38.960]  syria as an obstacle to their plans of world domination and of course i wanted to get into
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:43.920]  the religious aspect of it just a little bit because uh the whole class of civilizations
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:50.560]  thing the infiltration of the different religions for example uh muhabis is an extremist form of
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:58.320]  islam in the same way that zionism is an extremist form of Judaism and the idea is to destroy the
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:05.520]  prime religions of the world chianti judeism and islam to bring in their own religion which is
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:13.360]  an occult luciferian religion this is my this is my view of the way things are no that's it i mean
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:17.920]  pinac admits the clash of civilizations i want to go to break and come back and repeat all this
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:24.160]  because it's so important and expand on it but please continue uh thank you very much i i just
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:30.960]  wanted to say you know this is my opinion i might be wrong but this is the way i've seen things from
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:37.680]  the how old no you're not wrong it's the divide and conquer program it's admitted see people say well
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:43.520]  are you going to support the palestinians or the israelis they're not sophisticated the globalist
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:49.040]  admit they control both sides they want the clash that's why our governments are putting
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:55.120]  the extremist in because they don't want peace and it's the same on the other side this is how
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:59.520]  they maintain control ordered out of chaos the general public's not sophisticated enough
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:08.320]  so sodium fluoride in the body reduces iq and increases cancers unfortunately fluoride and

[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:32.240]  girls she's actually been on national australian television her family does come from one of the
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:38.640]  former ruling parties uh that sod kicked out she's not fans of a sod but everything she's
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:42.960]  told us in the last year about what was really happening in syria has come true if you just
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:50.400]  tuned in here today uh the presidents and abc news has officially recognized a known admitted
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:55.840]  al-qaeda group that mclatchy new york times and others have admitted is al-qaeda well you have a
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:01.760]  cfr endorsed al-qaeda three months ago mclatchy about a week ago started reporting on this
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.640]  we've been reporting on it every day for 21 months trying to stop this they're trying to bring down
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:12.160]  the country uh and here's the headline al-qaeda link group syrian rebels once denied now key part
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:17.200]  of an anti-assad victories and obama has taken that very group and recognized them as the official
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:23.360]  government there is now a white house petition online that's got tens of thousands of signatures
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:31.920]  there's 24,040 signatures on the white house petition that will show tv viewers a shot of
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:37.280]  right here uh who are watching on prisonplanet.tv and they are
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:44.960]  saying she's all funding and support for al-qaeda terrorists and extremists rebels in syria
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.880]  heller cohen has admitted that al-qaeda supporting the syrian rebels who were backed by the obama
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:53.600]  administration with 200 million dollars in aid and that's that's not counting the ambassador
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:58.560]  and been gauzing in them 10 000 missiles to shoot down aircraft according to mclatchy newspapers
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:04.240]  one of these groups al-nosara front that's who obama's recognized an al-qaeda affiliate is now
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:08.960]  conducting the heaviest frontline fighting in syria and has been responsible for terrorist attacks
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:15.440]  impartial observers such as dr joc joc burrez says the majority of rebels in syria are foreign
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:20.240]  extremists whose goal is to impose real law we have they're blowing up churches these rebels
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:27.920]  have also been filmed during burning us flags enchanting anti-american slogans funding terrorist
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:35.440]  as a crime under the national defense authorization act such activity has had disastrous consequences
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:41.520]  in the past such as 9 11 we demand all support and all direct support or indirect to cease immediately
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:48.080]  and 960 people do not want al-qaeda to not be funded 24 000 and counting due so we're going
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:53.280]  to link this petition up at info wars dot com it's actually linked in paul watson's article that's
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:59.040]  at info wars dot com and up at drudge report dot com i'll get into the union thugs beating people up
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:04.400]  and um how that's going to be used to demonize unions period and how they're playing both sides
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:11.120]  off against each other just like it's happening putting al-qaeda in libya um iraq uh putting
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:16.800]  them in syria putting them in control of egypt al-qaeda light this is so they can start the
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:21.600]  next big wars and and here's the key that we force this out in the news this is a big deal
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:28.480]  i make no mistake info wars dot com our reporters were the were the genesis of this and i actually
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:33.760]  not really particularly i'm proud of that but that's a dangerous fact i mean wow we're really
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:39.600]  having an effect here praise god but the fact that it's now been forced out and obama's had to
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:44.960]  come out and respond in fact we that clips on abc news in this article obama recognizes syrian
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:49.680]  opposition group you guys go find that video clip uh but the point is they've officially come out
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.840]  and admitted they're running them but but said that there is an al-qaeda problem so we're going to
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:59.520]  deal with that so uh it's just amazing so when aircraft in europe and the united states or anywhere
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.360]  else get shot down by al-qaeda and they want to set up checkpoints on the highway to search for
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:08.800]  missiles and trucks there's they can even be hidden in cars uh just remember when you pull over and
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:12.480]  the state police are there with a checkpoint all acting official and aiming their machine guns at
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:16.320]  you like they do now over the country there's a bank robbery families have guns they just everybody
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.520]  at the checkpoint they have guns that you know i mean it's just it's just the government wants to
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:24.640]  fully dominate us when they let their al-qaeda attack us so they can grandstand and act like
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:31.360]  saviors just remember remember the banks that run al-qaeda did all this and they are going to use
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:35.040]  al-qaeda to attack us again and they're going to then use it to stick their hands down your wife's
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:41.920]  pants okay at the shopping mall not just at the airport so this is how they do it al-qaeda works
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:46.960]  for them uh and syrian girl uh we fixed your microphone so it's better now uh just just just
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:51.680]  recap this point i brought up and and and and and and and the divide and conquer you were talking
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.800]  about last segment what's really happening and what the larger plan is and do you get my point that
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:02.480]  uh if they're in trouble on this they want they thought the public was so dumb they couldn't grasp
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:06.880]  that the government runs al-qaeda they've been caught with their pants down now this is a great
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:12.880]  opportunity uh to to shut this down and stop this war and then also undoubtedly the tens
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:19.840]  plus 10 000 plus is over 12 000 missiles missing high-tech uh heat seekers now undoubtedly they're
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:24.400]  going to blow up aircraft with these and or the globalist max we try to stop al-qaeda from doing
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:29.840]  it now knowing that they're going to actually get blamed for it so uh you may be a year from now that
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:34.640]  some family was going to get blown up taken off from chicago or austin or wherever or from paris
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:39.920]  at you know de gaulle airport i mean because i know these scenarios i mean we're saving lives right
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:44.480]  here so i salute you and every and all the other reporters uh tony cartelucci i think's been hammering
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:52.880]  this the hardest paul watson curtain ammo speed watson uh don salazar uh our reporters uh david
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:58.800]  or tease uh you've got just all of them have been reporting on this melissa melton uh david night
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:04.720]  jacari jackson uh darin mcbrain i mean i'm not tuning our horn i'm giving people the good news
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:10.480]  that we can affect change here syrian girl we can the globalists have overplayed their hand
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:15.360]  here thinking we're so dumb they could use al-qaeda and libya now syria i mean this is really blowing
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:20.480]  up in their face i think they took a big risk with this and they've written off more than they can
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:26.960]  true and to go on to the divide and conquer uh strategy we're talking about um they really you
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.920]  know their end game is to create islamic states all over the place and of course the jewish state
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:37.920]  as well and you know you were mentioning about palestine and israel and you know the war there
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:42.960]  and i think syria has always been an advocate of a one-state solution with the right of return
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:47.440]  for the palestinian people you can call it israel you can call it palestine but it has to be a
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:53.520]  secular state because it's secularism inside the countries with many different religions living
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:59.920]  together peacefully which has existed for hundreds and hundreds of years before the zionist agenda
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:07.120]  before the zionism was even created so this is uh what syria was advocating for and why the thorn
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:13.760]  in the side of those who want a uh class of civilizations and you know it's nothing against
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:18.720]  uh jews being in the middle east because they've been there for thousands of years but it's it's
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:24.560]  against uh land grabbing and massacring people based on their religion and that's what's happening
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:30.640]  right now and you know the president actually i might not be a government supporter but i will
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:35.120]  acknowledge the fact that it's positive that it's a secular government the president invited the
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:41.440]  syrian jewish community from new york to come back to syria and anytime they want and who of
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:47.760]  course there's a huge push in 2009 before the war began to bring the jewish community of syria
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:53.040]  who are living yeah no that's it i mean israel it's been it's been declassified
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:16:02.000]  would in the 50s and 60s would bomb jews in iraq but also jews in europe and spain to make
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.320]  them move to israel and it turned out israel was doing that itself absolutely i mean al qaeda is
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:14.640]  blowing up synagogues and killing jews right now uh and the people running israel are pleased
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:21.040]  his punch about that because it's going to force them into israel absolutely that's the idea they
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:25.920]  want to divide everybody up and the biggest jewish community outside of israel in the middle east
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:31.920]  is in iran right now and that's going to be the next step you know there's uh thousands and thousands
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:38.400]  hundreds of thousands of jewish people living in iran are threatened by this and of course you know uh
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:44.720]  on top of this the this fsa group the syrian rebels al qaeda they give them a thousand names
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:51.760]  they're just extremist jihadists they've actually been killing secular palestinians that are you
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:59.840]  know they oppose the extremist zionist entity of the current state that israel is in right now
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:06.960]  but uh they they're killing them because they don't really want a secular uh opposition they don't
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:13.040]  want people to unite and say no we don't want to fight each other we want to be uh jewish christian
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:18.240]  muslim living with each other peacefully like we have thousands of years they want a dirty free
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:23.280]  parole with people killing each other on all sides and i just wanted to say that one of the crimes
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:28.880]  that uh they they're committing now the biggest crime in syria is not only have we now lost our
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:35.840]  jewish community we've also now losing our christian community and they've um destroyed one of the
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:42.400]  oldest churches in syria which is uh from 50 ad maybe one of the oldest churches in the world
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:50.560]  and i'm a muslim but i'm also a syrian and that's part of my heritage and for me a syrian of any
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:58.240]  religion is exactly my brother and sister as um as a muslim would be and i don't think that the
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:05.360]  people that they're putting in power feel the same way about that i want to go to a phone call
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:10.800]  for you but but uh how do you think the establishment when we come back from break
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:15.360]  is going to be able to spin when al-qaeda attacks the united states or europe again that's one of
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:20.240]  the big questions let's talk to clinton in iowa he has a question for you go ahead quick question
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:27.440]  clamp uh yes sir uh alex steering girl thank you for taking my call um steering girl do you think
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:34.560]  it's more a are they attacking you uh politically or is it more a faith base uh like through your
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:40.880]  religion um here in america from iowa being a christian i feel that they attack you through
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:45.360]  your culture and your religion first and then politically afterwards but i'll take the answer
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:54.160]  offline um i don't quite understand the question so do you think that are you asking me if the war
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:19:02.640]  is more religiously driven or more politically driven or um is this the question uh yeah i guess
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:08.240]  it would specifically do do they attack you more through religion or do they attack you more through

[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:28.640]  geopolitically domestically economically on the tax front financial cliff that's all coming up we're
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:37.920]  taking a few more calls we've got a 1490 am wjoc listener in ohio on 1490 listening to us a sheep
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:46.240]  dog i want to talk to syrian girl syrian girl here is a sheepdog uh yes it's a two-parter one is
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:52.480]  a statement which i believe that you guys did the right thing on covering that agent uh there's no
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:57.600]  doubt but uh friend of ours i'm not going to make him uh on here and i'm not going to say
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:04.000]  who is he affiliated with believe that people just accelerate their agenda that the ungovernment of
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.480]  what they're doing because they've always got everything back up now my question to you syrian
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:16.400]  girl is uh now that we know that 20 brand new f16 that have never been used before are being sold
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:22.480]  by our government to the egyptian government which our sources also tell us that uh they're
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:27.280]  going to be used against the syrian government which is going to give more of an upper hand to
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:33.120]  the rebels uh have you heard anything about this what your thoughts on that good question yeah well
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:37.520]  they're openly talking about the peaceful no fly zone where they drop peace bombs because it's a
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:45.200]  peace prize president like libya um what's your intel on that syrian girl um i haven't any intel
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:51.840]  that the planes might be used against syria although this could happen you know of course
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:59.840]  the egyptian government that has now been installed is a belligerent against syria but i think uh the
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:07.120]  way i saw it is that those planes might actually be used in case the gypsies themselves have another
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:15.280]  revolution to try to take back the revolution that was stolen from them so um i you know it's clear
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:22.240]  that this government uh it's egyptian government now is it's a complete puppet of the globalists
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:28.160]  it seems so i while i don't have any intelligence for what you're saying i can't dispute sure let
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:34.160]  me ask her this question how are they going to spin it if al qaeda is able to take over and does
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:40.800]  like libya and and and kills jews christians and minority muslims and and libya lines up tens of
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:44.880]  thousands of blacks and kills them i mean i guess the media will just will stop covering it at that
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:51.520]  point i mean how will they get away with something this big well if you just look at the way they
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:58.640]  got away with it on afghanistan you know they just waited a while until the country got destroyed
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:04.320]  and became a failed state and they went from supporting al qaeda against the syrians to
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:11.280]  we hate al qaeda and before that they needed of course a false flag operation um as we saw in
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:17.600]  nine eleven that's right it's just amazing that's what they do haboo in wisconsin he has a question
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:24.400]  for you go ahead sir thank you very much for this opportunity and i have to thank you mr jones for
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:30.960]  giving syrian girl a platform amidst all the propaganda we hear otherwise here's my question
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:39.520]  to you syrian girl and you are doing wonderful work um do you think uh if say china russia
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:48.800]  um iran perhaps has bola you know sent in five thousand troops each that to be in syria that
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:55.200]  would in a way discourage any open confrontations because it's always easier to preempt than to
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:00.320]  react to a invasion well aren't those troops already there out of iran they've sent in a whole
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:04.880]  but uh they've sent in a bunch of revolutionary guard and there's russian spit snats they've killed
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:11.600]  russian generals al qaeda has a syrian girl uh they claim to kill a russian general but the russian
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:18.320]  general came out and said oh actually i'm still alive and he was in russia uh syria doesn't have
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:24.480]  any iranian or chinese or russian on the record they don't have anything like that or hezbollah
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:31.760]  inside syria and at the moment i think that it would be politically uh a bad idea to do so syrian
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:39.120]  army does is five hundred thousand strong so it's not the case of uh non power that's a problematic
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:45.360]  it's just a case of weaponry a sophistication that needs to be upgraded and that's where russia
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:50.800]  and china might be yeah well russia has has has brought in a bunch of ships and naval spit snats
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:55.600]  have been uh have left the ship set up in about six months ago but i'm i mean you're saying the
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:29:03.040]  media is just completely lying about that i think that this there's russian people military people
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:10.960]  inside syria that are uh advising train advisors exactly but i think that the idea that the russian
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:17.360]  army is fighting syria or the iranian army is fighting i don't i don't see any evidence of that
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:22.480]  yeah that probably wouldn't be good pr to have them actively fighting either with the population
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:27.360]  well again you're no fan of Assad regime i'm not either but he's not attacking anybody and he's not
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:32.960]  al qaeda and he's not blowing up churches like al qaeda is and making people suicide bomb uh thank
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:36.800]  you so much syrian girl will continue to get updates from you and uh know we've got loaded
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:40.160]  phones for other callers but i've got to move on to some other subjects we'll still go to you on
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:45.520]  the syria question but folks i'm not hyping this in fact i couldn't hype this big enough we forced

[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:45.760]  man we got so much going on here that we can barely even get on air anymore coming back from
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:52.960]  breaks there's just so much happening so much unfolding oh yeah we've got a report on hacking
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:59.520]  drones and we're supposed to play that uh there's some breaking news here but i just can't
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:06.240]  figure out what's going on with that and um we've got a lot of other things we need to report on
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:11.840]  and break down here but i it just really physically makes me sick that our government is publicly
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:17.440]  running al qaeda against other countries and the general public is still in a coma uh the good news
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:24.160]  is uh people are at least awake to a certain extent uh to the fact that this is going on now so i
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:30.320]  should be in a really positive mode it's just this is dangerous stuff and it's the realization i guess
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:39.760]  i've been psychoanalyzing myself it's the realization that the public is in a coma it is the realization
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:50.800]  that we've got real hardcore criminals in charge and that it's only going to get worse unless people
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:54.640]  break out of that coma and i don't know how you get people to break out of a coma because even if
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:59.600]  they're awake they all feel so powerless that they don't care you know they say well i can't
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:03.520]  do anything about it so it's almost like they just sign off to their own doom we have a short
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:10.400]  clip of obama on abc nish talking about recognizing the syrian government but there still is an al qaeda
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:17.280]  threat he's saying recognizing the new government so here's that clip do you plan to recognize
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:25.760]  the opposition um and give them some legitimacy we've made a decision that the syrian opposition
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:33.120]  coalition is now inclusive enough is reflective and representative enough of the syrian population
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:39.840]  that we consider them the legitimate representative of the syrian people uh in opposition to the
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:44.480]  Assad regime and uh so we will provide them recognition and obviously with that recognition
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:50.320]  comes responsibilities uh on the part of that coalition that's a big step it is a big step
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:57.680]  there is a small element of the uh of those who oppose the Assad regime that are in fact
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:05.440]  uh affiliated with al qaeda in iraq and we have designated them al nusra as a terrorist organization
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.640]  and we are going to make clear to distinguish between those elements of the opposition
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:18.320]  do you plan to recognize the opposition okay so there you go ladies and gentlemen i want to
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:27.760]  get into the economy here with uh ted anderson on this current situation in our economy and the
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:33.120]  fiscal cliff and then we're going to get into some other financial news here as well but i have
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:49.920]  some news articles right here that say us stocks rise on thoughts of fed ahead the thoughts of the
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:55.440]  fed how everything relies on the federal reserve in our country and another report here golden
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:03.440]  silver poised for major move dollar slips as traders expect fed stimulus 80 plus billion a
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:08.080]  month they give to the private bankers of your tax money banners serious differences will remain
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:13.520]  with obama the obama is declaring victory and says the republicans will do what he says well yeah
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:19.680]  because they're bought and paid for by the same globalist uh banksters and fed set to expand its
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:25.840]  monetary stimulus so that's big news that means inflation but not as not as bad as it would be
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:32.480]  because they only give it to the Rothschild Rockefeller big six banks bank of america wells fargo
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:41.600]  goldman sacks and a few others uh you notice buffett and soros have come out and they won an
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:50.160]  80 percent tax rate on inheritance down to one million dollars now even the smallest farm is
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:54.080]  going to be worth more than a million dollars in the middle of nowhere because of land prices
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:38:00.560]  and inflation over the years um most people now you know when they die and they have a million
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:05.280]  dollar house they have to sell it for the estate tax because of the you know they may have other
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:11.280]  assets and you have to understand george soros and the globalist they're in tax exempt foundations
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:20.080]  they're in trust so all of these uh inheritance taxes situations this is set up to transfer the
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:25.840]  wealth of the middle class to the elites and make sure no generational wealth ever forms because that
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:30.480]  gets in the way of social engineering uh people become billionaires on their own are pressured to
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:36.080]  join the globalist or they're put in jail for some trumped up charge so it's a global mafia
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:41.520]  who are exempt from the taxes you see that in the news where general electric and gm and google
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:48.880]  you know pay zero or 3.2 percent taxes and they never get in trouble for it or they have you know
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:55.760]  hundreds of billions in offshore accounts that's because they set up the system so i wanted to
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:00.560]  get dead hadn't been on in a while he's the founder of the genesis network 15 years ago and the gcm
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:06.240]  radio network gcmlive.com he also has been the golden silver trading operation for over 30 years
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:11.920]  they said minus resources about 15 years and look i went and got dead because he was somebody
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:17.520]  i was getting golden silver from 15 years ago uh i went out and and i'm not gonna pitch goal
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:24.880]  let's not waste here but i'll do it anyways um i he's my sponsor he was a radio sponsor before
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:30.800]  he started a radio network and he sponsored me on another syndicated uh system i was on
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:36.400]  so i've actually known ted longer than 15 years longer than might as resources he had another
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:42.880]  company name before that he just liked to name might as better but the point is is that uh ted
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:48.960]  knows his stuff uh and uh he's where i get my precious metals uh and he's got him on hand to a
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:53.920]  lot of places sit there and you know you you you buy something from them they go out and manipulate
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:58.240]  the market and try to wait till it goes down to buy ted doesn't do that he buys when it's low
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:02.960]  sells at the low price when uh the market goes up and that's how he's now the fifth biggest
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:08.000]  golden silver broker in the united states so um great example of competitiveness but that's not
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:14.160]  wise here ted what do you make of the qe unlimited uh they're announcing will continue i guess hence
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:20.880]  qe infinity and what this signifies and then how it ties in uh to the fact that they're gonna raise
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:26.000]  taxes massively the republican plan you know bill clinton called for it he'd be called a communist i
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:31.920]  mean it and and and then the the democratic plan is is two to three times worse getting rid of all
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:37.200]  write-offs um no wonder i'm depressed you know that's where does i never really get depressed
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:43.600]  and when i get depressed i get angry and i don't even mean to like a rage anger ted i have never
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:51.840]  felt this nasty nasty i mean i feel nasty at the system just beyond hatred it's just i'm it's i'm
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:56.800]  disgusted i'm sick of them they're filthy they're murderers they're criminals and they just keep
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:02.160]  perching on us getting away with everything all the system hen pexus and nitpixus and runs us to
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:06.720]  the ringer and i guess people in soviet systems stop working that's what happens everybody just
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:12.080]  stops working this is going to get stolen from me anyways and i guess that is that the only answer
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:15.920]  i mean i'm just sick of it i'm tired of the government i hate the government they're criminals
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:21.360]  they're murderers they're scum ted go ahead well i can't blame you for being angry because i get
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:26.000]  kicked around all the time too uh it's just trying to deal with government is just it's a
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.320]  ridiculous battle especially while you're in business but uh yeah you're right i mean the
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:35.280]  fat i mean why do we put up with this this institution i mean let me tell you something
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:39.440]  that that the book and silver dollars that we've been offering these are the silver dollars right
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:45.600]  now for those of you are watching they're older silver dollars that were designed by the federalists
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:51.200]  by the people that put together the constitution for money we have the federal reserve system now
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:57.520]  talking about raising uh you know printing more money 85 billion dollars more per month
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:02.880]  to to extend these stimulus i mean you know and what are they doing they're buying mortgage
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:07.600]  backed securities why do they buy mortgage backed securities to bail out their friends the banks
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:12.880]  don't fall apart i mean and what does it do to the average person the the middle class that they're
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:18.800]  trying to save right now with these middle class uh tax savings it destroys them because of the fact
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:24.320]  that the currency that they're holding on to is dropping in value today the dollar fell sharply
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:28.320]  against foreign currencies the foreigners are trying to drop the value of their currencies
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:33.440]  at the same time i mean the the the reason why the market is moving into gold today and gold
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:40.800]  took a show you know it's shot up today um the the high today so far 17 2480 is because of the fact
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:46.560]  that the federal open market committee decided that they're going to continue to buy more bonds and
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:52.000]  extend stimulus uh elix we're sitting on the edge of a cliff yeah this is a fiscal cliff but the
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  fiscal cliff is being created by by a monetary system a banking system that is destroying the
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.560]  value and how do you deal with it how do you deal with it because i take all this personal i mean i
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:06.560]  take it personal that they're putting poison in the food and water on record and i have their
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:10.640]  documents and they admit it they're not getting in trouble i take it personal that they're maneuvering
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:16.240]  the country towards bankruptcy on purpose i take it personal they're playing the unions off against
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:21.280]  the non-unions when the globalists control both sides and the jobs already went to china a decade
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:26.880]  ago and they ain't coming back i take it personal to know we're going under agenda 21 and it's hurting
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:33.600]  americans it's hurting people it's hurting their future their savings i just it's just there's i'm
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:38.720]  getting to the desperation point ted because i've always known this stuff was coming but now it's
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:44.320]  really starting to happen and then ted there's nothing worse than knowing the next 20 steps
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:49.520]  how bad it's going to get i don't know if listeners understand i don't get up here with
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:54.320]  rhetoric even though this stuff sounds crazy i know i sound like a lunatic on air you know why
[01:43:54.320 --> 01:44:02.080]  why because the real world is crazy truth is stranger than fiction and i just i i gotta take
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:06.800]  a vacation i'm gonna make this announcement right here uh i'm gonna take a vacation i know christmas
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:12.160]  is coming up uh but i gotta get away from this somehow for just a few days or something because
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:16.640]  ted you know where my heart on my sleeve and i don't even know where i'm going with this it's
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:23.120]  just does it ever get to you like this where it's just like and then and then why don't other people
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:30.640]  get upset why don't they care don't they understand we're going into real authoritarianism well i can
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:35.680]  tell you the the political discussions that i've had with family and friends over this last
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:42.560]  presidential election i mean you know when you have two flavors of poison to take to take and one
[01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:48.160]  is brock obama and the other one is mit romney and neither one of them has have a solution we can
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:52.560]  have mit romney as a president right now and guess what we'd be talking about the federal open market
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:59.440]  committee extending stimulus so they can keep the ball rolling we are in this massive debt system
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:07.840]  that is just absolutely consumed the any prospect of a future and and so that this this is where we
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:13.840]  are i you know that's a alex i can just say this i understand you get upset i mean i i lose sleep
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:20.400]  over this and i and it drives me crazy to watch people try to defend it i mean it just absolutely
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:26.960]  drives me nuts but that's this this three the these books and videos that you that that we put
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:32.160]  together the the dishonest money and your obama deception we'd have to change the name from the
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:37.200]  obama deception to the romney deception if they if the the political thing went the other direction
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:43.840]  it doesn't matter we're you know it's it what's what what flavor i mean republican democratic
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:48.640]  it really doesn't matter because both of them are coming up with the same thing hey let's raise
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:53.840]  taxes on the economy if you raise it my way it won't kill the economy and the rich are the ones
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:58.480]  that get the government contracts and money and that criminal and he is a criminal he's done illegal
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:04.560]  things getting make or bail out money things with taxes things with insider deals i mean i i can
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:12.800]  defend that people like warren buffett wants my tax money saying i'm rich people making 125
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:16.640]  thousand dollars individually or quarter million collectively with their husband or wife i mean
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:22.160]  that is baloney and and and then he wants people that have a million dollars in assets folks that's
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:30.320]  a house and a tiny farm uh anywhere i mean you you can't get it's just amazing they want everything
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:35.760]  they want 80 percent of what somebody works for at the end of their life of already tax money big
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:42.880]  bloated maggots big disgusting pigs like that just slime bag who's always up with an ice cream come
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:48.640]  to look non-threatening warren buffett all over tv all over military industrial complex propaganda
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:55.440]  sponsoring the news these sponsors cnn and abc to tell you raise taxes and to play mindless
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:47:01.600]  class warfare telling dumb down poor people the rich people don't pay taxes pointing out that
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:07.120]  he doesn't hardly pay taxes raise them on us when he knows he's exempted himself i mean this is
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:12.080]  horrible because it's not the paying the money it's that they're stealing it and it's going off
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:18.560]  short of them it's that it's all a scam and being informed is like torture it is like torture
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:23.200]  and i'm sick of all the dumb idiots out there that think they can just have an opinion that
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:28.640]  i'm wrong ted or that you're wrong no we've done our homework we know what we're talking about
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:34.000]  we're right ted what do you make of the fact that for 20 plus months we've talked about al-qaeda
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:39.120]  being used to attack syria and now it's admitted mainstream news mclatchy ap
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:45.520]  the roiders la times but they spin it and say that's okay al-qaeda is good
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:52.720]  well i mean that's the crazy part about it alex they point at you and they call you crazy i mean
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:56.800]  at least at least you've been elevated to the point where they look at you and they say hey
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:00.880]  there's this crazy guy alex out there he's nuts he's talking about this al-qaeda thing
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:05.920]  and then six eight eight months later they're saying the same thing that you did just six months ago
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:12.080]  you know and now they're saying it's okay and it's not crazy anymore i mean it all i can say alex
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:17.520]  is that obviously you're doing a great job doing what you're doing and you're bringing this information
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:21.680]  to the people ahead at times so they can make some choices and do some things that are actually
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:26.800]  going to save themselves ted again i'm not here tooting our horn i want folks to know this is
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:33.680]  dangerous to do this it this is this is hardcore what we're talking about and we're all in danger
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:39.680]  because they think you're so dumb folks the next part of the plan guaranteed is the 12 to 15 000
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:43.920]  missing uh missiles a whole bunch of them heat sinkers that can go in the back of a vault
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:47.920]  wagon they're going to drive out to the edge of airports they're going to shoot down passenger
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:52.560]  liners seven seven sevens and the government is going to just grab some mentally retarded
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:57.520]  patsy and frame them and then they're going to put checkpoints all over the highways to stop the
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:05.440]  missiles i know how they operate i mean it's so clear the globalists are occupying america
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:11.520]  and they're using al-qaeda as the threat to do it and they now are giving the middle east to al-qaeda
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:15.520]  the government is illegitimate i had a police officer pulling me over for driving eight miles
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:20.080]  over the speed limit today and i just i just i read in the riot act i said look you're gonna
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:26.320]  i know you let illegal aliens go and he said yep we're to do that for drunk driving you name it
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:32.000]  and i said uh and i said uh i know you know that the government's criminal and all the stuff but i
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.840]  know you're going to give me a ticket for eight miles over the speed limit my point is is that
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:42.640]  is that is that the government is falling apart okay and i i'm i'm telling you you're illegitimate
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:47.520]  because not that he even individually is bad it's that now there's no government the government's

[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:30.640]  Ted Anderson finishing up here with where all this is going they're devaluing all the world's
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:34.720]  currencies as you know so they can say the dollar's up one day and it's down the next but they're all
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:40.640]  going down they're all being devalued looking at all the different experts you have you out there
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:45.120]  Max Kaiser thinks everything's going to start accelerating it's going belly up as bold as
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:50.960]  prediction yet in around April 15th that when people have to pay all these new taxes they're
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:55.520]  just going to shut down and I'm telling you what happened in the Soviet Union other areas is happening
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:55:01.920]  here just human nature every business person I know except info wars because we're just trying
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:06.880]  to get the word out desperately is downsizing and is going to downsize massively but they're
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:12.000]  going to say employment's going to go up because people that get cut to 20 hours or 30 hours to
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.480]  get around Obamacare because the businesses can't afford it in most cases and they're
[01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:20.160]  and tens of millions they're all going to have to get a second or third job and the government
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:26.880]  fraudulently counts that against just the total number of workers in the country but when when
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:31.520]  these new taxes go in the country's going to go completely belly up which is the plans the bankers
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:36.640]  can then consolidate even more though from 25 million on food stamps to 50 million as it is now
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:42.480]  or 49 million a million more just went on it in the last last week that was in the news yesterday
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:46.720]  incredible and then that's going to go to 100 million people don't understand the government's
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:52.640]  not screwing anything up this is a globalist new world order takeover so how bad will it get well
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:57.760]  you know a whole bunch of doctors are saying they're retiring because of this government loves that
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:02.720]  they want to go bankrupt they'll just federalize it now so people don't understand the government
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:07.120]  knows people are just going to let their employees go and shut down that's part of the plan again
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:11.680]  what do you do in the face of an elite that is so bloodthirsty they want to wreck things
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:18.880]  well actually take a look i mean 16.3 trillion they're going to raise taxes they're printing
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:24.640]  money to create inflation which is taking money away from the the people's you know savings any
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:28.640]  pensions that they might have i mean they're really putting us on the hook here geithner's
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:33.760]  asking that the congress no longer has a debt ceiling so he can just spend as much as he wants
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:39.680]  they're they're talking about taking 401k plans and and pensions and this type of thing and making
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:46.400]  forcing people to buy us government securities which is basically you know taking private money
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:51.360]  and making a government money like they did in argentina you know it it we're just going towards
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:58.080]  this uh economic disaster and it's socialism but it's an economic disaster it's it's it's the power
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:02.160]  being turned over to the government if you could consider the fact that if the government were
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:06.800]  elected officials it's not being turned over to them it's being turned over the central banks
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:12.000]  and the people that pull strings economically and you know if i could just get people to see that
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.840]  they'd vote against this i agree we're almost out of time i'm going to come back in the third hour

[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:25.600]  ahead well actually uh i kept listening and you talked about unemployment and i worked in unemployment
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:33.920]  law for a while not as an attorney but to drum up new business one thing i noticed is the government
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:41.840]  has grown so large that when they say we've had the best month ever unemployment is going down down
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:49.120]  down that's not really the case we're seeing no no they only announced the government employment
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:54.560]  numbers yeah how many they're hiring and most the hires are always government yes that's right
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:02:00.720]  that and then of course also on your benefit charge statements that they send out to all different
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:07.920]  companies the if you go to any state to the department of labor if they'll show on there
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:17.920]  they admit to making anywhere from 18 to 20 error rates when they're really making more than that
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:23.760]  and it's costing everybody's business a ton of money on top of the money they're already bleeding
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:31.120]  us um but i i just thought about that with unemployment but my the real question i wanted
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:37.680]  to ask was i was driving the Memphis with my daughter who wanted to make a contribution to
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:44.800]  st jude so i took her there for a weekend as we were driving on 40 to come in the Memphis
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:49.760]  i've never seen anything like this in my life and i just wanted you to explain it to me
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:58.560]  if you could i think you can they have these big vehicles parked in the center lanes literally every
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:06.240]  half mile looks like they're they're black suds with little white things on top of them i know
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:10.000]  they're now they've now got federal police and when they pull you over they really think you're
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:15.600]  god and i'm just getting sick of it man it's the representatives of drug dealing murdering al-qaeda
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:19.840]  and that's the end of it they're the representatives of a foreign criminal syndicate
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:25.200]  individually they're not bad people usually but they think you're the enemy if you don't
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:30.160]  absolutely get out and lick their boots and i'm just sick of it i mean it makes me sick when a cop
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:36.160]  starts pulling me over now i don't get angry i get sick i just get sick because i think of the
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:42.160]  hypocrisy and how pathetic i am and what a joke this country's become makes me want to throw up
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:48.000]  while the government ignores this legions of horrible crimes the government's busy nitpicking
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:55.280]  all of us makes me want to throw up if there was some tropical island destination or even you know

[02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:29.920]  to you live from the front lines of the info war you know for people that say the world isn't an
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:36.720]  exciting place and they're bored maybe in the matrix you're bored honey the real world isn't boring
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:43.760]  but it is it is amazing to watch the general public in their trance not aware of what's
[02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:49.200]  going on and then to watch other people that are awake to some of it but just say oh well that's
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:55.520]  the way it is i'm gonna i'm gonna go along with it you can't and and i'm trying to figure out why
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:09:00.560]  i'm so angry today i was not in a bad mood driving into work this morning but i was really concerned
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:05.840]  about the world and i really wanted to have this impassioned focused broadcast where we really you
[02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:11.760]  know woke people up and i was shocked and i think pretty freaked out that the white house is having
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:18.000]  to respond to stories that we forced into the mainstream uh with how our government's running
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:25.200]  al-qaeda and you know at this level that is not really exciting folks when you start being able
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:36.080]  to to affect things at that level uh even though it's a good thing it's not fun power is not fun
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:44.000]  but i guess people that are you know should have power that are moral and don't crave it power is
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:49.680]  not fun the problem is people that want power who shouldn't have power are the ones that are in power
[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:54.560]  and i think that's really the message i'm here to impart to you today folks you better take the
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:10:00.000]  new world order personal you better take it serious and you better do whatever you can to expose these
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:06.560]  people number one discredit them and let them know they're illegitimate every bureaucrat every
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:11.600]  government minion say i don't care if your function has some tenuous connection to common law and the
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:18.960]  constitution the overarching system that you're part of is absolutely evil and absolutely dangerous
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:25.440]  and if you don't stand up and rebuke the new world order and say we're putting our city our county
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:30.720]  our state in the right direction you're not legitimate now if government tries to do the
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:36.000]  right thing and recognizes it's been in the wrong just like an individual and tries to turn the ship
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:41.040]  then we got to get behind it and help it but that's not the case we have not turned the ship around
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:46.720]  yet and i think it's that message that has to get through that this is not our government now
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:51.120]  it's run by foreign banks they've declared it publicly you know why they did that in hundreds
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:55.600]  of newspapers last year declared we've been conquered and use those terms and said they're
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:01.200]  going to hurt us real bad because it's international law you have to declare something is yours you
[02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:10.400]  plant the flag they've stolen our flag and i think one reason i get so upset and so angry is i have
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:16.320]  gutted up and don't have fear for myself individually but there's still kind of a gut reaction of
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:24.400]  man you are in danger buddy you are really pushing it and you know what i do i just throttle down
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:30.720]  here i'm gonna push even more and i know where i'm headed and it's a good in my soul but my flesh
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:37.360]  does not like it my soul's like this is the right way this is the thing to do my spirit is in control
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:44.240]  that my flesh is still very strong and my flesh is nasty and angry it's weird it's like my spirit
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:49.440]  is good and loves god and i have a good heart but my flesh is wicked and so there's this weird
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:54.800]  thing when i get in combat mode with the new world order is that is that my spirit is good but my
[02:11:54.800 --> 02:12:00.640]  flesh is nasty and angry and is being drug along with me and does not like what i'm doing i think
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:06.640]  that's really what we're talking about here and so this is some heavy psychoanalyzing here and the
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:11.200]  reason i'm talking about myself is my journey is your journey we're all the same in the final
[02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:18.240]  equation and if you knew what i knew if you knew that i'm not exaggerating to you if you knew it's
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:23.760]  worse than i can even articulate if you could see what i see if you have experienced the
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:28.000]  things i've experienced i know you've experienced things i haven't experienced but i've been doing
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:38.000]  this more than 15 hours a day for 17 years my whole mind is on this when i'm playing with my
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:44.000]  children when i'm walking through the woods when i'm buying groceries and because i am aware of it
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:53.920]  i know why people want to stay in the matrix because when when you are really hyper aware
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:13:01.280]  you then start seeing the propaganda and the programming everywhere and it's a sick joke
[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:06.240]  you know sometimes the tsa comes over and and and you know says oh mr jones a troublemaker
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:10.480]  when i'm not even talking yet where are you going what are you doing i start laughing at them
[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:15.840]  not to make them feel bad it's funny these people know who i am they've just admitted it and they're
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:21.040]  doing an eight hour course on me where they think they can actually read my mind and i start laughing
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:28.960]  at them because it's funny they have no idea what they're under they have no idea how they're being
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:38.000]  attacked they have no idea how much of of a friend i have to them they have no idea how stupid they
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:44.400]  are they're folly but other days it's not funny when i run into one of the bureaucrat enforcers
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:52.880]  it's disgusting and it poisons my soul it does looking into their faces and all of it watching
[02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:58.720]  people submit to evil watching people willfully part of it you know you would think i'd be happy
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:02.160]  when that state trooper pulled me over today and admitted that they let the illegal aliens go
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:07.040]  in there above the law but when he told me yeah i don't like it and smiled at me like you know
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:13.840]  well yeah we know it's wrong it made me sicker because they all know it and they all know the
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:19.680]  american people are the mark and the ones to be sucked dry and they know and they still do it it
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:29.280]  was a hundred times worse so we're going to have to go through horrible judgment because men in this
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:34.560]  country will not do the right thing and it doesn't mean you gotta be perfect but you gotta try something
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:40.800]  you gotta do something you gotta do you gotta put something in you gotta do something against the
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:46.400]  new world order you gotta admit it's real you gotta admit we're in trouble and you gotta start
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:51.120]  thinking about what are we going to do about it get your heart right people say when you're going
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:56.960]  into a dangerous situation you better get your heart right with god right now you're going into
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:02.160]  this surgery and you're probably not going to make it a lot country's going into something and it
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:08.240]  already hadn't made it the country's dead and all the republican garbage isn't going to fix it all
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:13.840]  the neocons playing the part of the opposition to the new world order those people don't have any
[02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:18.160]  idea what they've signed on to the globalist plan to bring this country completely down
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:26.720]  in steps and to cause civil war and total death and round people up there's going to be a bloody
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:31.840]  civil war in this country if we don't turn things around very quickly there's going to be paramilitary
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:39.920]  forces there's going to be they've branded obama as lincoln from before he even ran they are creating
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:45.360]  the art types they've got more than 10 movies coming out in the next year where the un occupies
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:53.920]  america and they're the good guys they are really planning a soviet 1917 style takeover of this
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:16:01.200]  country funded by the bankers that funded that very group we are in a mega level emergency here
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:07.360]  ladies and gentlemen this isn't talk radio you're listening to this is an emergency transmission
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:13.920]  by american patriots who are aware of what's happened while they're shutting down so many
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:18.480]  of our free systems we've still got a fighting chance there's still a lot of freedom there's
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:24.080]  still a lot of good people there's still a lot of free market systems in this country there's still
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:28.720]  a lot of am and fm station managers and owners who aren't controlled by the globalist there's
[02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:32.640]  still a lot of newspapers and magazines that aren't controlled and we've got to support
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:40.640]  those stations we've got to support those affiliates let's just go ahead and go to this report and
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:44.160]  i'll talk more about it after the break and then go to your phone calls here's drone mob
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:55.760]  and this is the hacking of a drone over austin here it is
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:17:04.160]  this is melissa melton reporting for info wars nightly news last weekend info wars hosted its
[02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:09.680]  first ever drone mob a citizen protest of our taxpayer dollars being used to turn drone technology
[02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:14.960]  against us with the federal aviation administration announcing that 30 000 drones are set to fill our
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:20.080]  skies over the next decade regardless of the threat to our civil liberties many people showed up to
[02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:35.360]  speak out against drones and to fly them but one man showed up to hack them so we're about to see
[02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:40.400]  a demonstration of free open-source software that any person can get he's going to use it to take
[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:44.560]  control and jam the signal okay i'm now running the block right now i can see that i'm getting
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:49.440]  some acknowledgement that it is being effective so it's just hovering so staying in a hover mode he
[02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:54.080]  basically killed it you don't have to be particular with the drone it doesn't have to be targeted
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:58.880]  towards anything specifically our particular drone has an automatic landing feature all you have to
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:03.120]  push land and then land as you can see david's trying to hit the automatic land and it will not
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:09.600]  land is it working david can you control it anymore it's pretty hard okay so you do have control
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:14.160]  over the drone i do i'm spinning around right now okay okay there you go here's your spin okay i'm
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:20.960]  gonna go ahead and uh see if i can disrupt that here and stop you from being able to control it as
[02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:26.480]  well so you you have any control not yet he is trying to spin it like he just was these
[02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:31.360]  acknowledgements here are acknowledgements of uh what i'm sending which is telling the drone it
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:37.360]  wishes to disconnect from the controller uh the you might want to ask yeah what what are you what's
[02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:42.560]  going on jacari before you saw i was spinning the drone just around in the circle now i'm using
[02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:46.880]  my keypad to do the same thing i was doing before and i have lost i guess complete control of the
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:52.400]  drone now this isn't the first time a domestic drone has been hacked spending just a thousand
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:57.120]  dollars in parts students at the university of texas were able to build a device that allowed
[02:18:57.120 --> 02:19:01.360]  them to hack a drone in front of the department of homeland security this is all available on
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:06.080]  the internet uh this is something that you know can easily be taught to anybody we have the power
[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:12.160]  to do that and this is just a small demonstration of of that power this is so easy to do any person
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:16.640]  can do this i mean even even if they're using a different type of system you saw how easy it was
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:20.880]  to do it this i mean how easy you think it's going to be for just anybody i mean we're filling
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:25.280]  the skies with 30 000 drones how easy is it going to be for these other things to get taken over that
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:29.920]  actually have you know weapons on them they rubber bullets on some of these they got tasers on some
[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:34.160]  of them yeah it's going to be extremely easy iran's already demonstrated not only did they
[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:38.560]  take over one spy drone recently the first one they captured was the latest of harsh stealth
[02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:42.800]  technology i mean i've interviewed several people on this topic and and all the time i get
[02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:47.360]  answers like well but it's for my safety it's going to make me safer and i'm not doing anything
[02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:52.160]  wrong so it's totally fine what do you what do you say to people who say that well i think they need
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:58.800]  to be free thinking individuals i mean there's several consequences for any action and if anybody
[02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:02.320]  wants to get away with something even if they're doing it for another reason they're going to lay
[02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:06.880]  out all the consequences of what something can do or will do they'll pick the prettiest one they're
[02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:11.840]  going to sell it based on that and if we don't look for ourselves at the other consequences
[02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:17.040]  of the actions that we're being asked to support or let them take then we're all going to be enslaved
[02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:22.240]  it's going to be simple for them to do for info wars nightly news on melissa melton
[02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:29.040]  all right we skip this network break i am absolutely out of control that's a powerful
[02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:34.720]  report that's newsworthy um that a guy showed up the thing and said watch this i'll hack drones

[02:21:29.680 --> 02:21:32.800]  it's bad enough bailing it out but if you're gonna do it with tax money at least have it go to the
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:38.960]  workers the banker bailouts last time i checked were over 40 trillion dollars domestically of

[02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:28.160]  out or whatever from the hurricane like the government won't help you but they sure will

[02:24:54.160 --> 02:25:00.640]  talk to john in california go ahead sir thanks for holding oh no alexand my question was that
[02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:05.840]  i know that there's a part that will i guess russia is messing up here's the deal we don't
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:11.440]  really screen calls but we got to screen them for phone quality because some of the callers
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:17.040]  i can't even understand them thanks john but i just can't understand you uh peter in washington
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:22.640]  you're on the air hello can you under can you hear me boy you sound like you're in the room next
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:28.400]  to me brother thank you uh originally i had a question for syrian girl but there are a couple
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:35.680]  of of things that the information i might i'm going to try to give you uh i won't do a lot of
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:44.960]  comment first of all uh in 1959 i was told by wilmore kindle who was a senior editor of national
[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:52.720]  review and a professor at Yale on political science i know who he is i know he is okay he told he was
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:26:03.760]  a member of the os s and uh also in the cia and he told me that the cia was moving against the the
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:11.200]  right wingers was was uh back in even 59 oh yeah i mean national review was a cia operation that's
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:20.400]  now been admitted now the second point is uh and and that's important uh well the first point part
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:26.800]  of the first point and that's important to consider when you uh look at the cia in the 60s okay now the
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:35.440]  second point is earl lively who i knew in dallas and he was a uh correspondent and he was also a
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:43.760]  friend of ein rand and he was in oswald's apartment the day after the assassination and he said he
[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:51.120]  looked at the literature there and that it had the uh it all said that kennedy was ineffective
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:56.560]  and the important now this has nothing to do with or oswald was complicit or not that's
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:04.240]  what he collected okay uh in his apartment um and this is significant because the
[02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:12.480]  us made a big move toward the left uh immediately after the of course the mega banks want collectivism
[02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:19.200]  at the bottom fascism above the law above it they all want control they don't want freedom the cia
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:23.600]  was created out of the ossh that was created out of the british east india company in narcotics
[02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:28.560]  trafficking and was created in the us out of skull and bones which was set up with opium money
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:35.440]  that's encyclopedia britannica and so yes this is a predatory foreign takeover arm and they're
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:41.520]  doubling the size of the cia domestically and they are engaged in all forms of crime and everyone
[02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:48.160]  inside the cia needs to understand you are the new nazis you are the new soviets you have signed
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:54.480]  on to torture secret arrest you are the takeover army through homeland security of america homeland
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:59.920]  security is the foreign banking takeover arm so what but the good news is one thing holding back
[02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:05.680]  the system is this is so textbook evil what the globalists are doing that a lot of people in the
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:11.680]  fbi cia you name it are actually good and are not going along with it quietly are you aware of that
[02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:22.720]  yeah uh i i am uh now the one one uh one point i want to make uh uh interpretation and uh i'll
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:30.240]  be quick uh everybody thinks that because goldwater was defeated so disastrously against johnson
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:37.280]  that he never had a chance against kennedy look at the polls so whatever group you know there are
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:41.840]  very all these theories as to who was involved in that we haven't got time to discuss it here
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:50.640]  but it had to be some people that were not only willing to kill kennedy but either didn't care
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:56.880]  whether goldwater was defeated or wanted goldwater to be defeated and the power structure
[02:28:56.880 --> 02:29:02.000]  totally wanted to get rid of goldwater because he was a real guy he wasn't perfect but from studying
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:06.800]  and talking to folks that knew him he legitimately didn't well he said that he said the trilateral
[02:29:06.800 --> 02:29:11.920]  commission was an international banking takeover arm to destroy america and control the left and
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:17.200]  right and bring in international government run by private central banks gee what do we have now
[02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:23.840]  yeah well you know i remember as a student when kennedy died the first thought i had was
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:30.720]  was goldwater is going to loot because he there was a possibility of him winning you know i i didn't
[02:29:30.720 --> 02:29:35.600]  at that time i didn't realize yeah but they ran tv ads saying the world would blow up with an hydrogen
[02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:41.120]  bomb going off of e1 remember that what remember the hydrogen bomb ads the mushroom cloud ads
[02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:47.600]  yeah against goldwater yeah that was in johnson uh with the little girl and all that johnson uh
[02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:56.720]  and then hold on we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:33:11.840 --> 02:33:16.320]  yeah that was a really good call or we had the last segment i'm gonna do a spoof on
[02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:21.680]  william f buckley sometime you know that fake atlantic accent of course he was the son of a
[02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:28.800]  robber baron so i mean it's not fake he was basically a british historian anglophile
[02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:33.600]  basically loyal to crown type person who wanted to bring in the british empire
[02:33:34.320 --> 02:33:39.040]  that's what the council on foreign relations in 1922 was set up for you know once you know
[02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:45.040]  who these people are it's just disgusting but he would sit back and go what about this oh don't
[02:33:45.040 --> 02:33:52.480]  ever want to go my gosh he talks with the atlantic fake british accent is incredible he would also
[02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:57.760]  do something that real aletus like when they can't quite talk they go pull pull pull pull do
[02:33:57.760 --> 02:34:01.120]  you actually do that around aletus they start falling down the ground and rolling around
[02:34:01.120 --> 02:34:05.680]  in little orgasmic events i mean it it's just bizarre so i intend to watch some more of the
[02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:12.400]  cias at william f buckley sometime some of the old films of him and then and then do a whole
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:15.920]  piece where where where i'm interviewing him that way i can have him on the tv screen or
[02:34:15.920 --> 02:34:19.760]  i can be in the chair and then i'm interviewing william f buckley or he's interviewing me and
[02:34:19.760 --> 02:34:24.400]  i'm like but you're a fake you're a ci operative those preposterous well actually i have worked
[02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:30.240]  with them but it's a patriotic organization but you know but anyways i have to get the character
[02:34:30.240 --> 02:34:38.480]  together in my mind and again ladies and gentlemen being in the cia is not like you know skyfall
[02:34:38.480 --> 02:34:44.800]  james bond same thing with british intelligence most of it is just spying on people collecting
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:50.720]  dirt on them the blackmail them most of the people that are brought into it are pedophiles
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:54.800]  or have other really degenerate things that they're involved in this has come out so they can be
[02:34:54.800 --> 02:35:02.160]  blackmailed um you can have low level cia people that are building airfields or you know shipping
[02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:08.080]  armaments in or who are pilots or special forces that are brought in for cia to kill people
[02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:13.440]  who who who think they're doing a good job who are compartmentalized uh but the mid-level and
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:21.040]  higher ups it it's it's alien it's not america it's a 1947 national security act where the foreign
[02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:26.800]  shadow government could come in and operate in secret while turning the economy inward while
[02:35:26.800 --> 02:35:32.720]  taking the power from congress transferring to the bureaucracy and the executive has ron paul
[02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:41.920]  said in a speech we've had a cia coup over america and it's not fun to come out and criticize in
[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:46.160]  those guys but they know that i've put my message out if they kill me it makes me a martyr sometimes
[02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:52.160]  they don't care and if that's what happens that's my choice i mean i don't want to die but i've chosen
[02:35:52.160 --> 02:35:56.480]  to fight these people they're alien they've taken over the country they're operating domestically
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:01.760]  illegally they put all these dictators in direct their countries then they knock the dictators down
[02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:06.000]  and they put new dictators in and knock them down to keep all these countries down so they
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:11.840]  can never develop that's the official state department policy in memorandum 200 1973 and it's
[02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:16.080]  in many others is to hurt other countries to bring country and that's what we're doing here now
[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:22.080]  shutting off our power doing all this the globalists don't want to compete they want to control
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:29.680]  and they have a hatred of humanity and the cia it's a favorite meme of people that think saying
[02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:38.320]  alex jones the cia it's a favorite meme of people to just say that like oh well he's discredited
[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:43.280]  and that's what cast sunsteen said they would do he said we white house regulations are he said we'll
[02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:47.600]  go out we'll infiltrate the alternative media and we'll cause infighting saying people are government
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:55.120]  agents that aren't obviously look at the fruits of this broadcast that we are exposing the foreign
[02:36:55.120 --> 02:36:59.840]  banker takeover we are we are one of the few places having breakthroughs against their different
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:05.200]  programs exposing may run al-qaeda exposing their opening the borders exposing their fast
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:10.960]  and furious exposing their agenda 21 exposing their fluoride in the water exposing big pharma in
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:16.320]  the vaccines exposing exposing exposing do you think the military industrial complex once you
[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:21.440]  knowing that most people with Alzheimer's can stop it or reverse it and even gain ground back
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:28.480]  in major studies for 30 years with coconut oil non-hydrogenated non-cooked non not non-manipulated
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:34.000]  raw mean you think they like that you know how much money that'll take out of their pockets
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:38.560]  what they can suck out of an Alzheimer's patient that's the side issue they make the money out
[02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:46.480]  of killing you everything they do is they make the money out of killing you like they get a
[02:37:46.480 --> 02:37:53.360]  government contract to put microphones and cameras in all of the cameras and TVs and and and and
[02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:59.040]  now white post and then they they put ads out according to what data they get on you on your
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:05.920]  profile and they fund the main project with a free market solution but it's free markets that
[02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:12.480]  are controlled by them or they pick the winners and losers so I understand why the globalists
[02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:19.040]  want to assassinate my character and my name that's because they better do that in fact at a sick
[02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:26.880]  level I am pleased by that because that means they've chosen to kill my character instead of kill
[02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:31.840]  me physically but whatever happens happens I'm committed they know that they've they've you
[02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:38.640]  know done the actuaries they've done the psychological breakdowns the profiles and and they know I'm
[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:49.360]  real as real as it gets wards and all and they are they fear an idea they fear an idea that
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:54.480]  that that you could be a leader they fear the idea that you could get as smart about politics as you
[02:38:54.480 --> 02:38:59.520]  are about baseball and the factoids they fear and we're going to go to damn it on here in a moment
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:06.800]  they fear that you can discover there is good in the world you see things are really corrupt but
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:12.960]  that's how they they actually use that to get us to become demoralized so we and I get demoralized
[02:39:12.960 --> 02:39:18.160]  sometimes for we believe there's no hope that's why we've started when we find examples of good
[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:23.760]  police officers upholding their oath and doing the right thing showcasing what they're doing and
[02:39:23.760 --> 02:39:29.440]  the police have been have been really responding to it and trying to do more good you see it's
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:35.040]  little things like that so I know that I I in a way of no one's perfect I'm also a dark force
[02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:39.920]  we all have a good side and a bad side and and I inadvertently because I'm not controlled by
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:44.160]  anybody but myself and I'm not in control of myself part of what I do is a dark force 30%
[02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:48.480]  of what I do is probably ends up being bad one way or another in fact I could be a demoralizing
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:54.640]  force for people when I get really negative all I can say is man this is evil what's going on
[02:39:54.640 --> 02:40:00.240]  and we better stand up and say no to it but the globalists don't want you to believe there's
[02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:04.240]  anything real in this world there are real things in this world there are good people
[02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:08.560]  and there are bad people they want you to just think everything's you know one flavor and it's
[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:13.440]  all pragmatic and just don't be involved go have a good time so they can run the world
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:18.560]  while they consolidate control I mean this is this world government is is the nastiest thing
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:26.560]  I've ever seen in my life it is the most organized evil scientifically prepared uh
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:33.920]  exterminist program that you could imagine and I don't want people to take for granted this radio
[02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:42.080]  show and info wars.com and prism planet.com you should be emailing everyone you know these articles
[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:46.880]  and these reports and these videos that we have busted our butts to bring you because these are
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:52.960]  weapons of truth against the enemy and the system has done everything it can I am amazed
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:57.600]  that we're the best thing there is fighting the globalist when we're ragtag and have our own problems
[02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:05.360]  but it's because we are ragtag that we're so effective that's why I am so thankful to the
[02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:09.680]  media outlets that will tell the truth and that are really starting to realize what's going on
[02:41:09.680 --> 02:41:15.600]  that are out there and those outlets know who they are because what's happening is history right now
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:21.680]  if humanity doesn't beat this eugenics world government takeover we're not going to make it folks
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:29.520]  they tell the professors that they're only going to kill 80 or 90 percent of us and that they're
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:32.240]  going to survive and they're going to live and they're going to be taken to the government
[02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:37.760]  reservations that's what stuff like world war z is is kind of imprinting and putting the narrative
[02:41:37.760 --> 02:41:42.640]  out how many when you see world war z folks I've now read the book I've got a review coming out next
[02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:48.880]  week I just read the synopsis before you are seeing everything they're planning to do in detail
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:57.920]  in detail this is their mind comp their their their their magnum opus this is their blueprint
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:02.400]  this is their bible this is their playbook this is their attack profile battle plan
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:10.560]  just take zombies out and add general population under government bio weapon release control
[02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:15.680]  program and that's what they're planning and I did just say this now because the movie and I
[02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:21.120]  read the book watch the film in game blueprint for global enslavement and then go read world war z
[02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:28.720]  oh yeah Brad Pitt I hope you make a lot of money because your soul is going straight to hell there's
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:33.680]  no doubt of that unless you repent and they tell these elitists see when you see Brad Pitt jumping
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:39.360]  on the helicopter and surviving with his family because he joins the UN world government and
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:43.040]  they hunt down the american gun owners who won't turn their guns in they're the number one enemy
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:53.920]  if the film is like the book and they say it's basically identical if if if if
[02:42:57.040 --> 02:43:00.880]  Brad Pitt is smart enough to know what he's part of and I think he is then he is a really
[02:43:00.880 --> 02:43:05.760]  evil person along with his UN angel of death which shows up everywhere where they're going to kill
[02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:13.520]  everybody Angelina Jolie we're gonna go to Dambodonti right now I mean that's probably why I'm so
[02:43:13.520 --> 02:43:22.000]  depressed too reading that book so bad so bad so horrible it's all gonna happen it's all gonna
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:27.600]  happen fucks all gonna happen if we let them if you people working for the government at every level
[02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:33.040]  don't grow some humanity in your heart
[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:40.800]  you have no future and I know they told Brad Pitt that's why he got so obsessed over the film and
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:48.800]  bought it that he and his wife and kids would survive what's coming if they join the new world
[02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:53.840]  order because I have to know Brad Pitt knows about the new world order and I was told by I said two
[02:43:53.840 --> 02:43:58.160]  but really three different Hollywood sources that know him that 10 years ago he was into the new
[02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:03.200]  world order and in the patriot you know and watching my films Aaron Russo's and stuff like that and
[02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:09.120]  then he went married that UN front lady and now that's what they tell you they've told me this
[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:14.400]  executives and people well you know things are gonna get real bad and you need to join with us
[02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:18.160]  you need to just believe me we know best it's gonna get real bad the public ulterior part
[02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:23.200]  listen you know what we're in control because we're smart and believe us you you know you're smart
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:31.600]  too you want to be with us well I chose to be with humanity and and read the book this is what
[02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:35.760]  this is a metaphor for they're all getting on the UN helicopters and getting out but they're
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:40.960]  going to kill more than 90 percent folks they only tell their minions they're only going to kill 90
[02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:46.400]  percent when you get into their deeper documents they plan to kill 99.9 of people on the face of
[02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:51.200]  the earth and have this new Eden thing it's all moon raker they tell you over and over again what
[02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:54.960]  they're going to do all right I'm going to shut up and go down to Donnie Dan thank you for coming
[02:44:54.960 --> 02:45:01.520]  on Dan has gone back to report for us there in Rhode Island to be with the sun and to be still
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:05.440]  going to do some reporting for us from the ground does a great job as a man on the street and I
[02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:11.040]  wanted to briefly today Dan let you also do your own radio show stuff have you plugged that have
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:14.320]  you plugged your different websites and things and what you're doing is you're working for us
[02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:18.320]  part-time but before we do that just briefly tell us they're giving people tickets I was reading in
[02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:22.160]  New Jersey and New York when their windows are knocked out or even if their house is dumped
[02:45:22.160 --> 02:45:26.960]  over the locals and we put that article up on screen they're giving them yeah New York City
[02:45:26.960 --> 02:45:31.920]  hits sandy victims with failure to maintain property citation even though it's power lines
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:37.280]  and trees fall in their house that the government by law has to cut off the greedy code enforcers
[02:45:37.280 --> 02:45:42.080]  are so vampiric they're doing this give us your take on that and uh being there in the aftermath
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:46.880]  of this four weeks later still some power off what's your take Dan but Donnie well I mean it's
[02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:52.000]  just crazy I mean like we all know it was a natural disaster super storm but yet they're still
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:58.480]  hitting up fines for people when the people the whole east coast is calling for 60.4 billion dollars
[02:45:58.480 --> 02:46:02.320]  to help with the you know if the disaster relief fund and uh you got the White House calling for
[02:46:02.320 --> 02:46:08.640]  Congress for the aid but um you got an article from um the Washington Post I believe and that
[02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:14.880]  they're saying that 60.4 billion dollars hurricane aid is not enough I mean there's more than 64
[02:46:14.880 --> 02:46:19.120]  you know 60.4 billion dollars of damage but yet they're handing out fines when people came into
[02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:25.280]  Ford to uh salvage their own town and then not to mention the FEMA places they got set up that
[02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:32.160]  I mean it's just it's crazy now you've gotten back there in Rhode Island uh you know help your
[02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:36.080]  family out Rhode Island wasn't hit anywhere near as bad as New Jersey or New York but but talking
[02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:41.920]  to folks how how bad you isn't on the ground still in the economy oh it's terrible I mean the
[02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:47.040]  unemployment rate is like one of the worst in the country's here uh I mean you got the um down in
[02:46:47.040 --> 02:46:52.240]  South Rhode Island's where all the beaches are basically and um you know all the businesses down
[02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:56.560]  here the seafood places where they're famous for and everything they're all like wreckage I mean
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:47:01.040]  like the beaches are all corroded I mean it's just and it's just like the southern Rhode Island's
[02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:06.480]  like basically uh in the turmoil and I read in New Jersey they've got code enforcers there too
[02:47:06.480 --> 02:47:10.960]  giving them fines for houses that are dumped over how are you supposed to fix that in four weeks
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:16.640]  exactly I mean like we you know it's a natural disaster but yeah we're gonna you know you gotta
[02:47:16.640 --> 02:47:20.320]  come up with money you know to pay because insurance company ain't gonna pay for everything
[02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:23.680]  so you gotta come up with more for money to you know give your family a living but yeah
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:28.240]  here's a fine because your house is upside down here's a fine because your window is busted out
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:32.880]  here's a fine because your car ain't moving out of your driveway you know I mean this is total
[02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:37.600]  tyranny I mean this is a federal takeover because they want the people to say you know we need to
[02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:43.680]  rely on big government to help us and uh you know in the meantime go hand out fines so this way
[02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:47.600]  you go out and you know when you've got the food stamp rates now I think it's and by the way by
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:53.120]  the way that's CBS News New York we've got it AP out of New Jersey I mean imagine a tree falls on
[02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:59.280]  your house with power lines only the city can come cut it off but the code enforcers come and smile
[02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:04.240]  and give people huge fines I mean I couldn't take that Dan I mean that's what I'm saying I'm getting
[02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:07.680]  the point where I just can't take any more of these scum I mean these a lot of these government
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:14.800]  people love hurting people they love hurting people and you know my grandfather was a county
[02:48:14.800 --> 02:48:20.880]  tax assessor and people love love our family to this day because he would basically just forget
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:25.520]  the taxes and people didn't have the property taxes they just went away whatever happened to that
[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:30.560]  I mean I mean whatever happened to bureaucrats that are servants it is it just makes me want to throw
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:36.560]  up I mean how are these people so low to go around giving people tickets when their houses
[02:48:36.560 --> 02:48:42.720]  are collapsed saying your house isn't in order and the courts I mean it's mafia Dan oh it is
[02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:47.120]  it's total mafia and uh again what they're trying to do is to do people to the police state that
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:52.000]  you already know this and um they want people to rely off gun and but you know what you need to uh
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:56.160]  keep your head down keep your mouth shut and we've got to hand you with a fine you got to take it
[02:48:56.160 --> 02:49:00.480]  and we'll call you know we want everybody to rely off us we'll give you the free phones or someone
[02:49:00.480 --> 02:49:07.040]  and um the report I guess is 106 people died on east coast from the hurricane over 1.3 million homes
[02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:12.880]  and businesses down without power and they picked up to 8.5 million people that suffered without power
[02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:19.520]  on east coast and um that's just uh estimates I mean then I get the state by state statistics yeah
[02:49:19.520 --> 02:49:25.440]  and uh you know just like 64 point billion dollars is just an estimate we know it's not enough but
[02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:31.600]  meanwhile you got a lord of saviour king Barry Satoro going on a four million dollar vacation
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:37.280]  he does every year um he spent I had to take a total of over 16 million dollars no last four years
[02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:42.480]  to go to Hawaii for every year and not to mention when it closed down Times Square they closed down
[02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:47.360]  to a couple years ago just to bring his daughters to go get a couple hamburgers and Times Square in
[02:49:47.360 --> 02:49:53.360]  New York City I mean like what is going on and um you got a petition from Maryland uh guy from
[02:49:53.360 --> 02:49:59.200]  Millens uh saying that you know Obama you should cancel your vacation and use that money toward
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:03.760]  the hurricane relief fund and which we know that's not going to happen because you know it's so
[02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:08.320]  disgusting it instead of bringing us together Jamie Foxx and others are trying to create racial
[02:50:08.320 --> 02:50:12.400]  division uh but I know a lot of people came together during this hurricane as well and helped
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:19.360]  each other out so that's good Dan real quick uh plug your radio show that you do separate from

[02:56:18.960 --> 02:56:24.320]  security looking at those taser bracelets they want for flyers hi alex thanks for having me on
[02:56:24.320 --> 02:56:30.320]  i'll break it down for you very very quickly this comes out of a sex toy company believe it or not
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:36.480]  the the same inventors of this set of handcuffs that remotely electroshock prisoners and can
[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:43.360]  inject them with uh medication yeah right government medication it can also inject them
[02:56:43.360 --> 02:56:49.280]  with uh paralytic chemicals and this this is written right into the patent which people
[02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:53.200]  can read on info wars dot com this story is up there they can they can go to the patent and read
[02:56:53.200 --> 02:57:01.360]  this it delivers an electroshock to the detainees a facial restraint a helmet a neck collar i mean
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:09.280]  this is super dystopian sci-fi stuff and again it came out of a sex toy company that makes s and m
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:15.440]  remote electroshock handcuffs with all all the kinky implications of that and in the story
[02:57:15.440 --> 02:57:22.160]  that's that's posted on info wars dot com i linked it over to dhs at all the weird sexual deviancy
[02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:27.920]  in that department and in the tsa the the molestation of travelers the raping of women
[02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:34.560]  it's all the same thing alex torture devices weird sexual deviancy police state technology
[02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:39.040]  it's you know it's funny you say that because torture has always been about sexual perversion
[02:57:39.680 --> 02:57:44.480]  and uh they they use convicted sex perverts or fired federal jail guards to go around the
[02:57:44.480 --> 02:57:49.120]  torture camps and black sites and that's what this is really about it's a coming out of the
[02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:52.960]  pedophile pervert elite i'm not talking about this kind of this company particularly i'm not
[02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:58.080]  saying they're into that but i'm saying that's what abu graham torture all this stuff is about
[02:57:58.080 --> 02:58:04.560]  is about the act of domination and this is about their cult their tyranny cult taking over and
[02:58:04.560 --> 02:58:09.520]  that's why so much of the torture has been sexual in nature i mean they're doing it because it's
[02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:14.560]  not the destination it's the journey yeah absolutely well here the music so let's wrap
[02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:20.880]  up keep going keep going finish up well well also they can inject a dye an irritant a medication
[02:58:20.880 --> 02:58:26.960]  a sedative a transdermal medication all of these things can be remotely injected into the prisoners
[02:58:26.960 --> 02:58:30.960]  and you know that the prison guards are going to use this as a form of entertainment because
[02:58:30.960 --> 02:58:35.760]  they're so cruel these days so it's you know what stay there i want to hear more about this

[03:00:26.880 --> 03:00:30.560]  i feel like i could talk for 10 hours on air but at the same time i don't want to subject people to
[03:00:30.560 --> 03:00:35.840]  my being bummed out mike adams i want to get back into the torture bracelets and the taser
[03:00:35.840 --> 03:00:39.360]  bracelets and all the rest of it and you know this is so that even have to manhandle you they
[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:44.160]  just sit there and deliver the the electro shocks they already have ruled police can taser you to
[03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:47.360]  make you answer questions even though even though there's a fifth amendment it's torture
[03:00:47.920 --> 03:00:52.320]  they call it paying compliance how do you deal sometimes this doesn't happen to me a lot but
[03:00:52.320 --> 03:00:57.760]  sometimes i get overloaded with the news and how real it is and then the frustration of other people
[03:00:57.760 --> 03:01:05.440]  not understanding it and i get it's not really depressed it's a nastiness it's a uh just i don't
[03:01:05.440 --> 03:01:10.720]  know how to describe it do you ever have that happen uh yeah absolutely it can be overload i tell you
[03:01:10.720 --> 03:01:16.080]  the cure that i've discovered is to get off the computer go out in nature and i know you do the
[03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:20.800]  same thing there you go out and swim you go out and jog that's what keeps me sane if i can't go
[03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:26.640]  hiking if i can't go you know hang out with some of the interesting animals we have out on our ranch
[03:01:27.600 --> 03:01:34.080]  then i would go crazy just covering the insanity that is real we have to have these strategies
[03:01:34.080 --> 03:01:37.920]  that deal with it because well and then there's also the issue of the frustration like you said of
[03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:44.400]  others not understanding how real this is how eminent this tyranny has become how close we are
[03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:49.040]  to going over not just it's going on all the time too it's just we've been normalized to already a
[03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:53.920]  crazy level of tyranny it's just that now it's accelerating and it's like man i want off this
[03:01:53.920 --> 03:02:02.240]  train now yeah i hear you but i i do think that adaptogenic nutrition is what keeps us going
[03:02:02.240 --> 03:02:06.480]  if we were eating junk food diets and not having the nutritional supplementation
[03:02:06.480 --> 03:02:11.840]  that you promote that i promote and others we would already have given in and but i'm not
[03:02:11.840 --> 03:02:15.920]  exactly but i'm not as healthy as you i'm trying to get healthy every time i eat crud i feel at the
[03:02:15.920 --> 03:02:21.840]  next day and that may have been what happened um i can't eat the meats on pizzas anymore because i
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:25.200]  try to be healthy but then i fall back you know that's why i've lost 40 pounds though i was really
[03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:31.040]  fat i still a little bit but i've lost most of it but i ate i ate a mainline pizza last night
[03:02:31.040 --> 03:02:35.840]  and i think that there was probably nitrates or msg or something in there and that's probably part of
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:40.960]  it because i know that yeah actually nitrites now that you say it i think it's msg man it makes me
[03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:47.120]  like just i get a hangover from it msg is killer but i hear you i've been working so hard too
[03:02:47.120 --> 03:02:52.480]  look i've put on about 15 pounds in the last year and and i've got to recommit to taking that off
[03:02:52.480 --> 03:02:57.360]  and and getting back to the level of fitness i was at it's a compromise i feel guilty going jogging
[03:02:57.360 --> 03:03:00.880]  because i feel like i could write another article that could wake up a few more i do too that's the
[03:03:00.880 --> 03:03:05.360]  thing if i try to take off just three days it's very restorative but i'm like guilty the whole
[03:03:05.360 --> 03:03:11.360]  time about what's going on i feel the same thing but but yeah i'll be happy to fill in for you
