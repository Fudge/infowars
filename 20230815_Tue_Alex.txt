[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000]  Survivors of the Maui Fire say that they received no warning and that the flames appeared so quickly that escape was difficult.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:28.000]  Everything was suddenly in flames and many found refuge in the ocean for hours while their homes burned to the ground and into the same powdery ash footprint we've seen in recent years.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:40.000]  So far, it is estimated that nearly a thousand people have died. Locals are worried this includes hundreds of children who were home due to school being canceled that day.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:55.000]  Several people are reporting that the government is not only doing little to help, but they are blocking local efforts to do so and are not allowing local donations through, and that they are blocking life-saving medicine because it isn't federally approved.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000]  They are denying people access to bring in supplies, just supplies for people to live.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:17.000]  The government withholding every single one of our donations because we are not a part of FEMA and Red Cross, so none of this is eligible for giving out. Tell me why? I have no freaking clue.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000]  The people of Maui are on their own for now, and aside from the federal government's bureaucratic failure, they have good reason to be suspicious.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:37.000]  Just like what we saw five years ago in Paradise, California, there was nothing normal about these fires. Within a day of burning, it was like a bomb went off.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:54.000]  When you see the full extent of the destruction of Lahaina, it will shock you. It does appear like a bomb and fire went off, if I may, and all of those buildings virtually are going to have to be rebuilt. It will be a new Lahaina.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:04.000]  Local residents have been reporting bright flashes of light. One was captured by a home security camera that appears to have been the start of the Olinda fire.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:22.000]  Many people are saying that it was directed energy weapons. We know that most major governments already have them, and during the California fires, online weather maps recorded what looks like a laser from above, striking an area just before it bursts into flames.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:36.000]  In his research, Dennis Mills discovered that the incendiary aluminum and barium nanodust from chemtrails is most likely fueling the ferocity of today's so-called super wildfires.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.000]  And on the day before the Maui fires broke out, locals were reporting a heavy overcast from chemtrailing that they'd never seen before.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000]  It's also interesting to note that the Maui police chief was the incident commander for the Las Vegas mass shooting in 2017.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.000]  Lahaina is considered to be a historic and sacred land. It was the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii before it was taken by the United States.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:15.000]  It's been occupied by native Hawaiians ever since, who are defiantly opposed to the mainland outsiders who have been buying up land with no respect for local culture.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.000]  Not just Black Rock and Vanguard, but billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, who owns more land on Kauai than what the government of Kauai owns.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:35.000]  And Oprah Winfrey, who has bought over a thousand acres of land in Hawaii, including a new 870 acres in Maui she just bought this spring.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:45.000]  In 2018, the Paradise wildfires broke out exactly where the United Nations have plans to somehow make off-limits to humans.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000]  And that same year, a report on wildfire prevention was published that was focused on the exact same areas in Maui where the fires just broke out.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000]  All the historic downtown, all of it is demolished and all the houses gone. But those commercial big box stores are still there.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000]  Hawaii Governor Josh Green has been putting the World Economic Forum's great reset agenda ahead of Hawaiian interests.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:24.000]  Just weeks before the fire, he unveiled an emergency proclamation on housing that eliminates the traditional Land Use Commission, allowing the government more leeway to build as they see fit.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.000]  Such as building 15-minute smart cities run by artificial intelligence, just like they've been planning to do in Hawaii for years.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000]  At some point, I will make a major donation after all of the smoke and ashes have settled here.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000]  And we figure out what the rebuilding is going to look like. This is going to be a long and difficult process.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]  You're going to see a lot of Phoenix stories rising from the ashes here.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:04.000]  Alex Jones here in the next 60 seconds with some very exciting announcements.

[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:10.000]  To the people of Hawaii and specifically all of those who have been so gravely and irreparably hurt by the tragedy of the wildfires in Maui,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000]  something the likes of which have seldom been seen anywhere at any time.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:26.000]  The death caused by this catastrophic event will be far worse than ever expected now that houses and cars and other areas are being inspected.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]  The sad thing is it should never have happened.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]  Our government was not prepared.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:45.000]  And very importantly, the aftermath is going very poorly with the governor of the island wanting to do nothing but blame it on global warming and other things that just happened to pop into his head.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:57.000]  When asked about it today as he was getting into a car, perhaps coming home from the beach where he has been spending a great deal of time.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:06.000]  Crooked Joe Biden, the most incompetent president in the history of our country, with a laugh and a smile, said he had no comment on the death and the tragedy.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  To say no comment is oftentimes fine, but to be smiling when you say it, especially against such a tragedy as this, is absolutely horrible and unacceptable.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:38.000]  It is a disgraceful thing that Joe Biden refuses to help or comment on the tragedy in Maui, just as he refused to help or comment on the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, for a very, very long time.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000]  In any event, hopefully everyone will be able to pull together so that a horrible situation does not get even worse.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:58.000]  Through the families affected, I give you my love and sympathy. Nothing can ever replace your loved ones, but you will always have the memories and will feel their great love surrounding and embracing you.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:06.000]  Together, we will continue to carry their legacy forward, and I love you all very much. Thank you.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]  Heartfelt, powerful presidential message from our real president.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:20.000]  Biden was asked about it and said, no comment, not our hearts go out to people or we're sending aid. In fact, they're blocking aid coming in from private citizens and not bringing in federal aid.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000]  The governor on video announced they're going to steal the property and turn it into a smart city with Bill Gates.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.000]  63 percent of Hawaii voted for Biden. And how does he reward the people burning and losing everything and dying over a thousand now for helping elect him?
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  He gives them nothing and gives 80 plus billion. It's up to 170 billion to Ukraine.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]  And Hawaii victims get seven hundred dollars per household to get your life back together.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]  Don't spend it all in one place. Biden actually put out a tweet saying, I'm helping you.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]  Seven hundred dollars.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]  Legal aliens are given in New York ten thousand dollars a month and free housing while veterans ride on the street.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]  Footage I haven't gotten to for some reason the last two weeks we keep seeing pop up.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:19.000]  Didn't really make national news, but it's in local news in California and Kentucky and New York and other places.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]  Like Louisville, controlled by Democrats, they throw old people and others that are sick in stretchers.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]  They throw them out on the side of the road.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]  I mean, this is just road warrior collapse.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]  We're in the middle of the collapse. I've got so much to cover today. It's a jam packed transmission.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]  Roger Stone's coming on. Dr. Judy Mikovits, Mike Adams.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]  It's just the entire four hours jam packed.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]  But I'm not like corporate media.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000]  That says people say things and they don't play the clip. We like to show you something if we say it happened.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000]  Here's Biden when asked about a thousand plus dead, some say fifteen hundred and two thousand.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]  The state of Hawaii is famously corrupt.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000]  Never really stopped being a military zone since it was seized by the U.S. government.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.000]  Doesn't even really have the rights of territories out west that famously didn't have the same rights as eastern states.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000]  And even after a lot of the territories became states, they still are some cases 80 percent federally controlled.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]  But Hawaii is really a special case. Great people. Wonderful culture.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000]  Amazing vibe. But the government is totally, totally new world order.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]  Here's here's Biden who couldn't give a rat's ass about the Hawaiian people.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:48.000]  Will you come talk about the Hawaii response, Mr. President?
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]  Nothing there.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]  Nothing there. No comment.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.000]  Now, I was just in Hawaii for two weeks in Kauai and also in Oahu.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]  And obviously I'm well known.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:12.000]  So I got invited out by the Hawaiians several times and got a chance to hang out with some of the leaders.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:22.000]  And they've all got little ancestral pieces of property right on the beach where they're being offered 20 million, 100 million for even two, three, four acres.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]  And there's dozens, I said dozens, more than 100 millionaires that have moved out there.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]  And that's all the locals told me about.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000]  But I went on a fishing trip and things like that was how horrible they are and how they're stealing all the property.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000]  And how they're waging war on them and how they burn them out.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:53.000]  And so the governor now said, oh, we're not giving the people their property back, which is the cultural center.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:01.000]  That is where the fire happened. That's where the Hawaiian royal family lived for thousands of years.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]  Thousands of years.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000]  It's Tahitian culture that arrived there about 2,000 plus years ago.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.000]  Talk about incredible mariners, seamen, and they're just taking it.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000]  The most valuable real estate on earth other than the city of London.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]  I don't mean the main city of London. There's the city of London within London, the financial district.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]  That is the most expensive per square inch land on the planet.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]  Next is where the fires happened in Maui.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]  We're going to be laying this out a lot.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]  Emergency services stood down.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000]  Dozens of fires started instantaneously, just like we've seen in California and all over Canada.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:57.000]  We have satellite footage of California, Canada, and other areas where you just see instantly over miles, sometimes 200 miles long, just instantly fires start everywhere.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000]  There's some of the satellite footage of Canada just in the last few months that happened within 30 minutes.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000]  So you need to understand, ladies and gentlemen, that people are saying it's lasers.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]  They're saying it's things like that without proof.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]  I'm not attacking people that say that. I believe it is arson.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000]  But the old-fashioned thing to use is a road flare, a lighter with kerosene or gasoline.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]  You wait until the winds are high.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000]  It was a dry hurricane. You've seen the high winds, 50, 60, 70 miles an hour that blew in.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000]  And then all over the rest of Hawaii because it hit the Big Island, Kona right next to it, and then it hit Maui.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:43.000]  Kona is the most easterly, most westerly is Kauai, but it's really in the middle of that zone turning over.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000]  So you can see it as the perspective of it's the most westerly, but it depends on your perspective.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000]  But it's the island second closest to the mainland west coast.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:03.000]  It goes Kona, and then it goes Maui, and then it goes Oahu, and then it goes out to Lanai and Kalaya.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:11.000]  And then, of course, there's a Forbidden Island that literal seafaring Amish bought from the king hundreds of years ago.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:21.000]  And then there's an Amish Hawaiian community with no electricity out on the other island that you can only go to on day hunting trips by a helicopter.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:30.000]  If I ever get a chance to go out there, I'll do it just to be able to talk to those folks.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.000]  But I'm just stunned right now because this is just insane.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:48.000]  Now, what's just as bad because they're stealing our right to vote for who we choose, the Georgia incompetence of the Soros DA has completely blown up in their face.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:59.000]  They have been caught red handed committing a serious crime and trying to cover it up when they published the indictments before the grand jury voted.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:09.000]  I beg you to think about how important your word of mouth is and you sharing the articles and sharing the videos and telling people get the forbidden truth.

[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:19.000]  When we talk about the crew at info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]  It's really just incredible.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]  So for myself, the whole info wars crew, I thank you for your past support.

[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]  I know that less than one percent of our listeners actually go buy products at info war store dot com.

[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]  Please take action now.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:19.960]  I shot the sheriff, but I swear he wasn't selfishness.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:30.960]  I shot the sheriff, and they say he's a cat with turtle face.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:41.960]  Sheriff John Brown always hated me for what I don't know.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:51.960]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen to this live Tuesday, August 15th, 2023 transmission with a raft of incredible guests and information.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:59.960]  Ryder Stone joins us in 30 minutes to talk about the indictment. I've read the indictment this morning.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:08.960]  And all I can say is, whoa, this is the globalists cementing their coup over the United States.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:17.960]  That's why George Soros has put in over 900 district attorneys and county attorneys, thousands of judges and jurisdictions where they're elected, like Texas.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:26.960]  He has 22 of the state attorney generals and the globalists have control of the federal justice department.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:41.960]  This is total next level election stealing by indicting four times the leading candidate who would win in a landslide today if the 2024 elections were held.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:57.960]  And the sickest part of this is having to watch them criminally leak over and over again in federal and state cases and not get in trouble because they control the justice department.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:04.960]  And to watch the complete lawlessness and to know that these people know exactly what they're doing.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.960]  Several big points. They listed the indictment and I'll show it to you.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:21.960]  That one of the reasons these people are being charged, including Rudolph Giuliani and President Trump, is that they claim that the county where Atlanta is based,
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:31.960]  where they famously blocked the windows and set a water pipe that broke and it wasn't true and then the surveillance footage showed them cramming the same ballots over and over again in the machines.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:42.960]  They say Trump lied and put out tweets saying that they kicked everybody out and kept counting ballots. They're on record, they did.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:49.960]  And it goes on and on. This is criminalizing challenging a stolen election.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.960]  We've all seen the Democrats challenging them. It's completely illegal.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:23:02.960]  They're indicting him for organized crime, racketeering for trying to create alternate delegates, something Democrats have done over and over again.
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:25.980]  Barack Obama did it the second time he ran for president, in Hawaii. JFK did it. Was getting ready to do it. This is just simply amazing. Democrats did this and attempted to do this when Al Gore lost. Probably had it stolen. I don't like Al Gore. Looks like they did steal it.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:44.980]  So, there's that. But there's a big smoking gun in the middle of this. It'd be like if your neighbor at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, you're out watering your plants and you see your neighbor arguing with his wife and he pulls a gun out and shoots her in the head.
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:24:09.980]  I mean, it's smoking gun. There's got a gun. There's smoke coming out of the barrel. You just saw him shoot her in the head. So, what is that? Yesterday, at about 1130 Central, 1230 Eastern, they published on the county clerk's office there in Georgia, where this happened in Atlanta.
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:30.980]  The indictment index enlisted who was being indicted and what they were being indicted for, and it matched. And it was the front pages to the indictment. And they responded by saying, and I have the news articles and reports, that it's fake.
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:50.980]  And the press did ask him about this yesterday, about the prosecutor and the DA. And they said, oh, that's fake. And they said, well, why does it match it? And why is the grand jury's names on it that was secret to that point? No, it's real. They did it before the grand jury voted.
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:25:07.980]  I wonder if they'll have the convictions for Trump federal and state in New York and Georgia and Miami and DC. I wonder if they'll have the verdicts leaked too. I mean, that's how big this is.
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:23.980]  So, first, let's play the surreal clip of the sheriff's department saying that they are going to perp walk Trump. You'll have him do a mug shot, which we put out a fake mug shot if people wanted the shirt.
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:42.980]  They have a few of them left. It says political prisoner, but we'll put a new one out with the real iconic image of President Trump. They have until, what, the 24th or 22nd, I have right here, to, quote, turn themselves in.
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:26:00.980]  So it's Friday the 25th. Trump, Georgia probe. Court clerk calls charging document fictitious. These people are a joke. They're all self-important Soros-funded criminals, in my view.
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:09.980]  So they're trying to block who we want to be able to run, who's in the lead. That's stealing elections. They're trying to say it's illegal to challenge or say they steal elections.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:36.980]  They'll have Obama and Hillary and all them saying the voting machines are rigged when they lose. And they published the indictment or the cover pages of it and filed it as if it was an indictment before the grand jury even met hours later and did the whole rigamarole, marching it in and showing the indictment.
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.980]  Wow. So here they are announcing they're going to mug shot the president. Here it is.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:51.980]  We are following our normal practices. And so it doesn't matter your status. We have mug shots ready for you.
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:27:07.980]  Okay. Let's go ahead now and go to reporter asks Fannie Willis, the prosecutor about the supposed fictitious Trump indictment posted online before they voted and why it matched.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:39.540]  The official charges. Yeah. Whoever made this up just got it exactly right. And had the secret grand jury's name on. Yeah, right. And I think you believe Santa Claus comes down the chimney right on Christmas Eve. Here it is.
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:28:09.540]  This is a serious problem with your office. No, I can't tell you anything about what you refer to. What I can tell you is that we had a grand jury here in Fulton County. They deliberated till almost eight o'clock, if not right after eight o'clock and indictment was returned. It was true build and you now have an indictment. I am not an expert on clerk's duties.
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:39.540]  Or even administrative duties. I wouldn't know how to work that system. And so I'm not going to speculate. Next question. So they didn't even start meeting. I think they said until like two and you heard her say they deliberated until eight o'clock. So at 1230 it's marked here. I'll show it to you and come back in the afternoon Eastern. The thing is filed before the grand jury supposedly liberating came and handed it down. That's like an NFL game hadn't started.
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:56.540]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. The Cowboys win or the 49ers win. You're like, you haven't even played a game yet. Or you're watching a Yankee Red Sox game and they go, whoa, no need to have the nine innings. The Yankees win. You'd be like, this is rigged as hell. This is next level.

[00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:26.190]  Coming at you live, it's your source of powerful information from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:44.910]  All right, I don't think you need me to tell you, if you're a regular listener, get your
[00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:53.150]  head screwed on straight, that this country's got cancer. The world has it, but I've got
[00:33:53.150 --> 00:34:04.910]  a very important group of articles here today dealing with the globalist and with world government.
[00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:08.350]  And this story ties into what's happening in Georgia and all over the United States with
[00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:21.150]  these weaponized judiciary law enforcement prosecutory systems. See this headline? George
[00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:27.510]  Soros, which is again one of the top globalist generals in the attack on pre-humanity, has
[00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:31.870]  shifted all of his funding out of Europe because it's basically captured.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:45.840]  They are massively banning free speech. They are setting up future lockdowns. They've gotten rid of the borders.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:59.840]  Soros came out and said that they are killing their funding to the EU, basically declaring victory, turning that continent into a total tyranny.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:07.840]  They are going to focus on the United States and on China because China isn't following the globalist orders.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:15.840]  Then I've found a C-SPAN club with David Rockefeller admitting how they recruit people and how they control things.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:21.840]  It's very interesting. We'll be getting to that later in the broadcast.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:45.840]  But obviously the judicial takeover and weaponization in Georgia is front and center in the fact that any other free country screwed the pooch by criminally leaking the indictment before the grand jury had finished its, quote, deliberations.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.840]  Let me explain that again.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:36:01.840]  Yesterday in the early afternoon in Georgia, they published in the county registry.
[00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:14.890]  The indictment cover pages and the charges against Trump and dozens of others.
[00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:18.610]  When they got caught, they said, no, that's fake.
[00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:19.610]  That's not real.
[00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:23.970]  So a fake indictment got published in the county clerk, okay.
[00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:31.210]  And then when they released the quote deliberations that they claim went until eight o'clock at
[00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:36.970]  night and were not complete, so the grand jury's out, just like a regular jury.
[00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:43.610]  So the jury is still deliberating in a murder case and at noon, it's published on the county
[00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:50.530]  clerk that an individual's guilty and it matches the exact charges, you'd say, this is rigged,
[00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:51.530]  this is set up.
[00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:55.870]  There wouldn't just be an investigation, the whole trial would be thrown out.
[00:36:55.870 --> 00:37:01.450]  But the prosecutors, the Soros criminals run this, just like they stole the election.
[00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:05.870]  And they say in the indictment, you're not allowed to say it's stolen, that's a fraud.
[00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:10.790]  We've indicted the former president, and whether he was right or wrong about that,
[00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:15.150]  he had the right to say that and to investigate it, of course he was right.
[00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.150]  So I'm gonna say it again.
[00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:24.110]  They have been caught red handed publishing that he's been indicted and what charges
[00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:25.190]  it was for.
[00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:30.750]  And the others that were indicted with the grand jury's name, eight hours or seven
[00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:37.030]  and a half hours before they came out and said we've reached our verdict, he's indicted.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:53.240]  That's what they have. They have a vote on indictment. Just like an impeachment, they vote to start the Senate investigation. So the House of Representatives in impeachment acts like a grand jury, the Senate as the jury at the trial.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:38:09.240]  Now imagine in any criminal case, or even a civil case, if the exact verdict was published before the jury said we have come to a decision.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:17.240]  You know, you saw in my Sandy Hook show trials where the judge defaulted me in both Texas and Connecticut,
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:26.240]  said we gave him no discovery, selectively used the discovery, wouldn't let me put on a defense, had a show trial, what they told people was a trial,
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:37.240]  let the people run on for hours, saying just things that were just over the top, not based in reality, with no evidence or no proof.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:48.240]  Now if you think a judge telling a jury that man's a liar and he's guilty and I've already found him guilty, you are here to decide how guilty he is.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:39:03.240]  And the juries are so weaponized and so hand selected that they then say, okay, we're going to give a billion and a half dollars to these people when I only said the name of one person.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:16.240]  And an FBI agent who I never said his name and never showed a picture of him, didn't even know who he was until he sued me, they gave him 95 million dollars that doesn't exist.
[00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:46.450]  Now you're like, that is just over the top, that doesn't sound real, but you saw it happen. On national television, massive coverage, thousands of articles a week, hundreds of programs a day, conservatively. Every local news station in the country are lying about me and attacking me, saying I sent people to pee on graves. No footage, no witnesses, no nothing, just people saying it with no proof. And I'm the bad guy.
[00:39:46.470 --> 00:40:02.319]  And the Soros DA that dates a gang member in case she's over, yeah she's mobbed up, violent gang leader, thug, she's a thug.
[00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:23.370]  They publish the grand jury guilty verdict and it matches exactly on the county clerk website and they say it's fake with no evidence and then they don't even wait around to change the indictment around.
[00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:35.370]  Seven and a half hours later they say we've reached our verdict. Bring in the grand jury. The judge, I have the verdict. It's a sealed indictment. I don't know what this is.
[00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:43.370]  The whole world's already got it and they do this whole dog and pony show up there. What is this, Captain Kangaroo?
[00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:56.370]  Hmm, I wonder. I'm the great Karnak. What is in this envelope? Oh, indicted on all counts. Look at this show they put on.
[00:40:56.330 --> 00:41:01.410]  This is beyond third world.
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:12.100]  And you got this guy up there, and he also got caught on a hot mic, isn't this everything
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.100]  we dream?
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.860]  Great job.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.940]  We're powerful.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.480]  We can take away who the people want to vote for.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.480]  We run this country now.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.180]  Oh, we don't steal elections.
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:26.580]  We just indict the people that are 20, 30, 40, 50 points ahead in the polls.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:33.420]  Oh, we just had, in the same state, Georgia, in the same county, attempts last year to keep
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:34.420]  Marjorie Taylor green.
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:38.100]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that was in January of this year, it was this year.
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:41.740]  And a bunch of other Congress people, they tried to disqualify them from being able
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.900]  to run because they were at the Capitol, yeah, where they were elected to be on
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:45.900]  January 6th.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:51.220]  And of course they couldn't get it done because it's totally not in the law, but they'll figure
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:53.620]  it out.
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:55.980]  Judges say you're guilty, tell juries how guilty you are.
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.500]  You think, well that's as bad as it can get.
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:02.540]  Nope, hold my beer, says the Soros DA, the Soros prosecutor.
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:10.300]  Hold my beer, watch this, we will publish the indictments seven and a half hours before
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:14.020]  they're through deliberating, put on a whole show and say, ladies and gentlemen, they
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:17.620]  have their verdict, I wonder what it will be.
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:21.380]  And the judge is like, is this everything you wanted, I got the clue, isn't this everything
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:28.300]  you dreamed, maniacs, lunatics, crazy people.
[00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:51.470]  So, here's clip 7 of the faulty county superior court judge Robert McBurney receives a sealed indictment from the grand jury at 8 o'clock at night, hearing evidence of efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.
[00:42:52.470 --> 00:43:01.470]  And then I'm going to play the clip where the reporter asks, well, why the hell then did you publish the exact indictment? Well, that wasn't real. We just published it on the county website.
[00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:12.470]  Smoking gun. Roger Stone's coming up in two minutes. Play the clips back to back. Play clip 7, 9, and 8 back to back.
[00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:25.470]  This is a total circus. Is it evening or night?
[00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:42.470]  Hello, ma'am. Thank you. And the judge has got a big re-election sign up. The prosecutor's running ads for herself campaigning, raising money off the president.
[00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:52.470]  He goes, hmm, we don't know who. Have you got indicted? Let me open the sealed indictment. Meanwhile, it's been published seven and a half hours before.
[00:43:52.470 --> 00:44:18.470]  I know this is boring, folks, but it's important to put this on record. They already know it. They've already done it. Seven and a half hours before the deliberations were over. Total crime, in my view, in front of everybody. This is a smoking gun of kangaroo courts. This is Monty Python-esque.
[00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:35.470]  Oh, he has no idea what's about to happen. He's just now learning it. He'll do this whole show for everybody. Then he's caught on a hot mic saying, this is not everything you dreamed of. Oh, this is for so powerful. We're lawyers. We rule everyone now. It's our country now, not yours.
[00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:37.470]  Just making sure.
[00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:39.470]  Just making sure. Okay.
[00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:45.470]  Mr. Royals, everything went as it should have in front of the grand jury?
[00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:47.470]  Yes, sir.
[00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:53.470]  All right. Ms. Alexander, you're prepared to take this. I guess I'm delivering it to the clerk. You'll maintain custody of it from here?
[00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:55.470]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:04.470]  This is them trying to steal your right to vote for Trump. This is election theft right in front of you.
[00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:07.470]  Can you take the certification or does it go with Madam Clerk?
[00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:10.470]  Oh, now they're going to certify it and file it with the clerk.
[00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:12.470]  Oh.
[00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:15.470]  How did you guys make way?
[00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:17.470]  Clear path, please.
[00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:36.470]  According to the Fulton County Clerk's Office that was circulated online with charges against former President Donald Trump, that fictitious document matched exactly the charges that we now see in this indictment.
[00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:46.470]  Can you tell us more about that document leak? Because now you have the former president's lawyers who are saying this is emblematic of a serious problem with your office.
[00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:53.470]  No, I can't tell you anything about what you refer to. What I can tell you is that we had a grand jury here in Fulton County.
[00:45:54.470 --> 00:46:01.470]  They deliberated till almost 8 o'clock, if not right after 8 o'clock. An indictment was returned. It was true billed and you now have an indictment.
[00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:11.470]  I am not an expert on clerk's duties or even administrative duties. I wouldn't know how to work that system and so I'm not going to speculate. Next question.
[00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:14.470]  Have you had any contact with President Trump?
[00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:26.470]  Yeah, let's just sweep that under the rug. Did you notice this isn't just about a leak? They were still deliberating seven and a half hours later and this matches, but they're saying it's fake. They're lying?
[00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:32.470]  The grand jury had already made its decision or been told what to do. They jumped the gun.
[00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:40.470]  Roger Stone is a former political president, pardoned by the president for crimes he did not commit.
[00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:46.470]  There's really no one out there that's going to persecute as much as him except for a few other people, namely the president.
[00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:54.470]  So he is uniquely endowed by experience and persecution to be able to speak to this nightmare.
[00:46:54.470 --> 00:47:05.470]  But I have to tell you, Roger, I feel a real pain and sadness for our republic. I've never felt that the republic's closer to death. I am saddened right now. I'm grieving.
[00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:18.470]  It's absolutely shocking, Alex. In the 45 years I've been in the public arena, in the 45 years plus I've been in American politics, I've never seen anything quite like this.
[00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:44.470]  Does anyone anywhere think that if Donald Trump was not leading by double digits for the Republican presidential nomination, if he wasn't leading the incumbent, Joe Biden, who is mired up to his hips in epic scandal in every swing state and in national trial heats, that they would be bringing any of these essentially fabricated charges against him?
[00:47:45.470 --> 00:48:03.470]  I have listened to the entire audio tape of the phone call that is the centerpiece of District Attorney Willis's indictment of Donald Trump. I've read the transcript. By the way, it's ponderous. There were six other lawyers on the phone at the time participating.
[00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:12.470]  It is absolutely clear that the president does not instruct the Secretary of State to go out and find 11,870 ballots.
[00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:32.470]  What he says is you have illegally counted 11,870 votes that are illegal, a certain number of them being convicted felons, a certain number of them being people who are deceased, a certain number of them being people who illegally registered to vote from post office boxes, and so on.
[00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:51.470]  So that is a complete bastardization of what he says. And then beyond that, if you read some of these charges, and I'm not an attorney, there actually counts against him for him going online and urging people to watch OAN or right side broadcasting or in connection with a tweet.
[00:48:52.470 --> 00:49:13.470]  This turns our entire system upside down. There is a hysteria about the fact that unimpeded, Donald Trump will return to the White House and he will put America first. And they are, I think, vexed by the fact that no matter what they throw at him, it just seems to make him stronger.
[00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:30.470]  The real issue here is the state indictments in New York. And by the way, yesterday, the judge in the New York Business Records case, which should be a civil case but has been elevated to a felony because it targets Donald Trump.
[00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:39.470]  The judge in that case, despite being a contributor to Joe Biden, declines to recuse himself. No big surprise there.
[00:49:39.470 --> 00:50:00.470]  The state charges are actually technically, I think, more problematic because when he returns to the White House, which I believe he will do, he would have the power to pardon himself of these bogus fabricated federal crimes pertaining to his handling of records or in the matters in DC.
[00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:18.470]  But he has no such ability if he is convicted in any of the states. I would hope that his attorneys would move immediately to remove the Georgia matter to federal court where he would have a broader jury pool and at least have some chance of having a fair trial.
[00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:39.470]  Roger, if you look at page 26, and we can pull that up, they say he lied and charges him with fraud and making false statements that the Fulton County election workers at State Farm Arena ordered poll watchers and members of the media to leave the tabulation area on the night of November 3, 2020, and continue to operate after ordering everyone to leave.
[00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:57.470]  Guys, pull up that footage. They admittedly put up the signs, blocked the windows, kicked everybody out, and we have the surveillance footage of them continuing for hours while they claimed a water main broke that didn't break, they now admit, jamming ballots into the machines. I mean, they're indicting him for something that's on video.
[00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:19.470]  Yeah, it's really extraordinary. It'd be great if we could pull that up. This entire indictment is a travesty. It's a miscarriage of justice. It's a politically motivated vendetta. But let's not lose sight of the fact that it is the centerpiece of Fannie Will's campaign to be reelected.
[00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:44.470]  She's actually out through emails raising money for her reelection based on her vow to get Donald Trump and now against these charges. So the county of the indictment, she then says it's a counterfeit. It's not real except for it completely and totally matches the ultimate indictment. It proves that this cake was baked from the beginning.
[00:51:44.470 --> 00:52:09.470]  Anybody who understands the grand jury process understands it is a totally one sided process. The accused is never allowed to present any evidence to prove their innocence or to counteract claims of their guilt. It's a one sided process. As they say, a grand jury can indict a ham sandwich. And in this case, they have done so.
[00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:35.470]  And Roger, there's unity in the operations in Michigan and in Georgia and in Arizona and Pennsylvania. They kick everybody out, they block the windows so the press can't see, trucks pull up, more ballots come in, and they start cramming them in the machines and then running the same batches. And then they've charged Trump for talking about that in his tweets about it. I've got it right here. I mean, this is just next level.
[00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:56.470]  Just last week, you had breaking news documenting more election irregularities and anomalies in Wisconsin, in Michigan, and in Georgia. The Haldeman report, which everybody should examine, absolutely documents the election fraud in Georgia.
[00:52:56.470 --> 00:53:24.470]  I don't recall Stacey Abrams being prosecuted when she denied the outcome of the 2018 election in Georgia, when she saw evidence to overturn that result. So I guess the way to put this is, if you question the outcome of an election, that's an egregious crime for which you should be incarcerated and most probably banned for running for public office.
[00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:49.470]  Unless, of course, you're Kamala Harris, or Nancy Pelosi, or Congressman Jerry Nadler, or Congressman Jamie Raskin, or Stacey Abrams, or Chuck Schumer, or any of the hundred plus House Democrats who signed on to a bill to overturn the 2016 election. This is the two-tier justice system writ large.
[00:53:50.470 --> 00:54:14.470]  Roger, just on Act 25, again, they say right here that the Fulton County election workers at the State Farm Arena ordered poll watchers and members of the media to leave the tabulation area. It was on TV they did it. We have a video. We're just showing it. On the night of November 3, 2020, and continued to operate after ordering everyone to leave. Well, that's admitted when they said it was shut down from a water main. They kept going.
[00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:34.470]  Then, Act 26, like you mentioned, on or about the third day of December 2020, Donald Trump caused to be tweeted from the Twitter account, real Donald Trump, wow, blockbuster testimony taking place right now in Georgia. People were talking. Ballot stuffing by Dems when Republicans were forced to leave the large counting room.
[00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:57.470]  Plenty more coming out, but this alone leads to an easy win for the state. This was an overt act of furtherance of the conspiracy. I mean, and now, Roger, they're not just trying to say we can't vote for Trump. They're trying to say it's illegal to question elections and make public statements. This is unbelievable.
[00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:18.470]  Well, Alex, don't believe what you see with your own eyes. I believe what they say right there in that paper. This is a highly politicized jurisdiction. You notice the indictments against Trump and where they take place. New York County, New York, that's Manhattan. Fulton County, Georgia, that's Atlanta. Washington, D.C.
[00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:40.470]  In the one jurisdiction where the president, I believe, will actually get a fair trial, the Southern District of Florida, I'm actually optimistic that the judge and the jury in that case will recognize it under the 1977 Presidential Records Act as upheld by Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who just happened to be the judge in my case.
[00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:58.470]  A president of the United States can do anything he wants with his document. But in those other jurisdictions, I think that the president and his lawyers are going to learn that the Constitution, the law, the facts, the evidence, the rules, these things literally do not matter.
[00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:10.470]  All right. Roger, sad day for America. We've got to go to break. And I've got news that I haven't announced yet that is as big or bigger than all of this with not just election meddling here, but worldwide by the U.N.
[00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:24.470]  They're not just setting up a medical treaty. They've made a huge announcement, partnered with Google to ban all uncertified government or fact check, quote, news, banning it from search engines.
[00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:33.470]  The next move will be banning you or else we're going to start the next hour. Roger Stone is with us right now. We'll give you his website and more on screen.

[00:58:58.470 --> 00:59:04.470]  You are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high quality, horrible food and water filtration and self-defense.
[00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:08.470]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo. That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:15.470]  And I'm preaching the choir on that. But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough durable food or water filtration.
[00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:21.470]  This is something you need now. And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.

[00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:46.470]  It's an insane deal for a limited time. Go to info war store dot com and get prepared while you still can.
[00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:56.470]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:57.470 --> 01:00:11.470]  This is a short segment. Rogers with us for another segment after this will get into the unbelievable U.N.
[01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:16.470]  announcement that's getting almost no coverage. It is staggering.
[01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:25.470]  We're posting it right now to info wars dot com. Google announces worldwide ban on all independent media from search results.
[01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:31.470]  Period. You will be blacked out of the search engine against 92 percent of world searches.
[01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:36.470]  But first, Trump faces seventy six point five years in prison.
[01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:42.470]  Ninety one counts. Seven hundred and twenty seven point five years overall, plus death penalty.
[01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:47.470]  That's new. I didn't know that. Roger Stone responds.
[01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:51.470]  Look, Alex, this whole thing is completely out of control.
[01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:56.470]  If they could lock the president up for 100 years, believe me, they would do so.
[01:00:56.470 --> 01:01:03.470]  But their more immediate goal is to stymie his campaign for president completely counterintuitive.
[01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:12.470]  With every one of these attacks, the president has gotten stronger and he's raked in more in small and medium sized campaign contributions.
[01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:19.470]  Meanwhile, in the latest national polls, Governor Ron DeSantis has actually slipped behind Chris Christie,
[01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:24.470]  both of them in single digits and with Donald Trump with a 40 point lead.
[01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:33.470]  So you're getting increasing hysteria. Their goal is to derail his presidential campaign because an awakened Donald Trump,
[01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:42.470]  who now completely understands the game plan of the globalists and those who would move us to the new world order, is their worst nightmare.
[01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:50.470]  And they know it. The president has announced that he will have a public remarks from Bedminster later today.
[01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:59.470]  This is a very, very dangerous situation. The judge in the District of Columbia, evocative of my own trial,
[01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:07.470]  has made it very clear that if the president defends himself in public pertaining to the indictment in D.C.,
[01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:14.470]  she's prepared to do anything necessary, including, I think by implication, incarcerating him.
[01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:21.470]  So the gag order, which they call a protective order, is now in place.
[01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:31.470]  And when the president's lawyers argued that there was a political motivation and that his free speech rights should be maintained because he's a candidate for president,
[01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:38.470]  the judge openly rolled her eyes and said, no, he will not be allowed to say certain things.
[01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:43.470]  And that's, as she put it, just the way it is. It boggles the mind.
[01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:46.470]  Roger, let's in the short time we have in this segment get to this.
[01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:50.470]  To me, it's a smoking gun that seven and a half hours before they completed deliberations,
[01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:55.470]  they published that the indictment had happened and it matched what then later happened totally.
[01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:59.470]  So now they say it's fake. They're caught lying about that.
[01:02:59.470 --> 01:03:02.470]  It's a huge scandal, not just the leak. That's a side issue.
[01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:10.470]  The fact that they already knew he was guilty from the grand jury before they completed deliberations, that proves this is kangaroo shell operation that's got to be thrown out right now.
[01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:12.470]  What's the avenue to do that?
[01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:20.470]  Well, unfortunately, Alex, CNN had a copy of my sealed indictment four hours before it was unsealed by a federal magistrate.
[01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:28.470]  Again, unfortunately, the judge and a court in Fulton County is unlikely to be sympathetic to that motion to dismiss.
[01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:34.470]  I would expect the president's lawyers will probably mount it anyway as they should.
[01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:41.470]  I've got so many questions and points, but you're always got a lot of key issues I don't think to bring up.
[01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:43.470]  What else is front and center, Roger?
[01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:48.470]  Look, I think the most important thing now for all of us is to pray.
[01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:55.470]  I know people don't think that's much of a political strategy, but it has worked extraordinarily well for me and my family.
[01:03:55.470 --> 01:04:03.470]  This is the dark period, the troubled times that the Bible predicts that we were going to go through.
[01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:08.470]  So you can laugh at this if you're an elitist. You can scoff about our belief in Jesus Christ.
[01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:17.470]  The most important thing every American can do right now, every person can do, is to pray for our nation and pray for our president.
[01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:22.470]  Donald Trump doesn't pray for himself. He prays for the country. We should all join him in that.
[01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:30.470]  You've been spending a lot of time with the president and a lot of Laura Loomis, but mostly with him yesterday. She says he's just energized.
[01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:41.470]  He's just extraordinarily resilient. I mean, he is resolute. He's determined. He's in good humor. He's in fighting mode.
[01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:49.470]  Is he angry? Yes, I could understand why he might be angry. No other American president has been treated this way.
[01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:57.470]  Bill Clinton actually sold some of our most sensitive military secrets for missile targeting to the communist Chinese.
[01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:59.470]  Hold on, we'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[01:04:59.470 --> 01:05:08.470]  I beg you to think about how important your word of mouth is and you sharing the articles and sharing the videos and telling people,

[01:05:57.470 --> 01:06:23.470]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:31.470]  All right, we are watching a deep state coup to the judiciary through weaponized prosecutors controlled by George Soros.
[01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:37.470]  We're not just letting people that shoot up nightclubs out of jail, we're not just letting rapists out of jail.
[01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:42.470]  California is moving to legalize domestic violence. You cannot make that up.
[01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:48.470]  Saying police won't respond to calls of domestic violence. California is basically legalizing pedophilia.
[01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:53.470]  I mean, it's just insane. And now this, ladies and gentlemen, and I've seen the UN announcing this.
[01:06:53.470 --> 01:07:01.470]  I've seen the head of the EU, Ministry of Truth, come out and say we're going to sue Elon Musk.
[01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:09.470]  We're going to shut down free speech in America. And now Google, Sundar Pichai, has announced that they're partnered with the UN,
[01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:18.470]  which they already were, but now it's out in the open, and that they are going to, get this,
[01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:25.470]  follow the directives of the United Nations to give them an approved list of news sites and organizations
[01:07:25.470 --> 01:07:32.470]  that are allowed to be searchable by Google that is 92% of world searches.
[01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:36.470]  Google announces worldwide ban on independent media from search results.
[01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:41.470]  Google has announced plans to completely ban all independent media outlets from appearing in their search results.
[01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:47.470]  Google has partnered with the UN, the World Health Organization, that has censored us already on COVID,
[01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:54.470]  and other globalist organizations in a new censorship tool, according to Leitola Drake, head of Google News Lab.
[01:07:54.470 --> 01:08:03.470]  Google News Lab is, quote, a team within the Google News Initiative whose mission is to collaborate with journalists to fight misinformation.
[01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:12.470]  That means people resisting them and other things. And the Google News Initiative, CNI, works with publishers and journalists to fight misinformation.
[01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:21.469]  So it's dinosaur media with the UN, with the WHO, which they now admit they've been doing, to come in and tell them what to ban.
[01:08:21.469 --> 01:08:26.469]  I played the clip four months ago by the head of this Ministry of Truth at the UN saying,
[01:08:26.469 --> 01:08:35.469]  oh, we partnered with big tech around the world, Google, Facebook, Twitter, to tell them what to ban on misinformation on the pandemic.
[01:08:35.469 --> 01:08:44.469]  But they were the ones lying. And they're also saying, oh, Bolsonaro's banned from running for office again for eight years because he challenged an election.
[01:08:44.469 --> 01:08:52.469]  Their controlled court has said, so this is a unified worldwide technocracy, Roger, the same program of these technocrats,
[01:08:52.469 --> 01:08:58.469]  of these billionaires, of BlackRock, of Vanguard, of State Street, admittedly doing this.
[01:08:58.469 --> 01:09:02.469]  Congress must act. Your response to this, Roger Stone?
[01:09:02.469 --> 01:09:10.469]  Look, Google is the centerpiece of all evil. Google is deeply involved in the manipulation of the last presidential election.
[01:09:10.469 --> 01:09:18.469]  Oh, Google's manipulating their search results? This isn't surprising. Try to look up my unconditional presidential pardon.
[01:09:18.469 --> 01:09:25.469]  It's buried. In fact, anything positive about me or my family or anything I've ever done is buried.
[01:09:25.469 --> 01:09:30.469]  So all they're doing is stepping up the level of censorship.
[01:09:30.469 --> 01:09:40.469]  I personally hope that Elon Musk goes out and develops a new search engine that will not take directives from the UN or any other globalist outfit.
[01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:48.469]  In all honesty, if you were a donor to my legal defense fund, for example, and you use Gmail.
[01:09:48.469 --> 01:09:55.469]  When I try to email you back, whether you've whitelisted it or not, it's going to spam whether I like it or not.
[01:09:55.469 --> 01:10:02.469]  Google would classify Hillary Clinton's press releases very differently than Donald Trump's.
[01:10:02.469 --> 01:10:09.469]  Therefore, all of Trump's outgoing emails to anybody with a Google address ended up in spam by Hillary Clinton.
[01:10:09.469 --> 01:10:16.469]  And that's what Professor Epstein testified to Congress for, that that is election stealing alone.
[01:10:16.469 --> 01:10:23.469]  Absolutely. Google is the epicenter of all evil. We know this. It's not surprising.
[01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:34.469]  All they've really done in this announcement is confirm it publicly. It is pathetic, but censorship is the single most dangerous problem in the country today.
[01:10:34.469 --> 01:10:39.469]  It is what prevents us from having a free, fair, honest and transparent election.
[01:10:39.469 --> 01:10:44.469]  It is what is what prevents us from being able to make a living.
[01:10:44.469 --> 01:10:56.469]  It's what prevents us from being able to get out any narrative that is alternative to the official narrative of the two party duopoly that is busy running this country into the ground.
[01:10:57.469 --> 01:11:08.469]  It's so incredible to see this, but this really is desperation, because if we, by text message and word of mouth, promote radio shows, podcasts, news articles, we're still going to win.
[01:11:08.469 --> 01:11:18.469]  Look at how Trump is 40 points ahead of all the other candidates combined against him running as Republicans, massively ahead of Biden as well.
[01:11:18.469 --> 01:11:21.469]  It's only backfired, but they only double down, double down.
[01:11:21.469 --> 01:11:31.469]  So you're a smart guy when the smartest political analyst out there extrapolate out the timing of all these indictments and Trump's resoluteness and how you see all this coming together.
[01:11:31.469 --> 01:11:41.469]  I think it relates. This is kind of a carbon copy of the Russian collusion hoax. In other words, the actions of the deep state against Donald Trump are both offensive and defensive.
[01:11:41.469 --> 01:11:59.469]  First of all, when it comes to the Bidens, we have evidence now of extortion, bribery, money laundering, influence peddling, illegal lobbying, multimillion dollar payments from Russia, from China, from Ukraine, from Romania.
[01:11:59.469 --> 01:12:11.469]  Yet you have talking heads on MSNBC like the decrepit Andrea Mitchell saying, oh, all of that is unfounded. No, the House Republicans have actually produced banking records.
[01:12:11.469 --> 01:12:22.469]  There are whistleblowers who are not conservative Republicans, whistleblowers who are veteran civil servants who have come forward to expose this entire fraud.
[01:12:22.469 --> 01:12:39.469]  The attorney general appoints the U.S. attorney in Delaware, who's already done his best to cover for Hunter Biden as a new special counsel, despite a specific regulation, which I think is regulation 6-300.
[01:12:39.469 --> 01:12:48.469]  This specifically prohibits anyone in the Justice Department or for that matter, anyone inside government for serving as a special counsel.
[01:12:48.469 --> 01:12:58.469]  The purpose of this, Alex, is threefold. One, it withdraws the charges in Delaware. They'll never have to go in front of that honest, hard-nosed judge again.
[01:12:58.469 --> 01:13:06.469]  Secondarily, they can stretch out the investigation into Hunter Biden for two plus years, well beyond the next presidential election.
[01:13:06.469 --> 01:13:16.469]  And law enforcement and the federal government can consistently say to House Republicans when they demand documents which under law they're entitled to see.
[01:13:16.469 --> 01:13:26.469]  I'm sorry, that's an ongoing investigation. We can't divulge any of this. This is the epitome of a cover-up. This makes Watergate look like small potatoes.
[01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:39.469]  But we know that Homeland Security was shut up to the American people all along. Now the talking point by the White House and by their talking heads is we need to use Homeland Security against Trump's supporters.
[01:13:39.469 --> 01:13:46.469]  You've already been a SWAT team. You've already experienced it. This is a real tyranny. They know we're awakening. They know they've committed crimes.
[01:13:46.469 --> 01:13:53.469]  They have nothing to lose but to go for everything. I don't want violence. That's not the way to go. They're trying to stir that up.
[01:13:53.469 --> 01:14:12.469]  That would only help them. But it is time for civil disobedience and it is time for very serious legal and lawful action because they're putting intelligence operatives, like the guy you see on screen, on TV saying we need to use Homeland Security on the American people.
[01:14:12.469 --> 01:14:25.469]  Again, they set a police state up during the Cold War. Then they said it was for the Muslims. But it's really always been for us. Joe Biden even admitted that 20 years ago that he tried to get the Patriot Act passed previously against right-wing extremists.
[01:14:25.469 --> 01:14:31.469]  So this has been their plan all along. They're a ruling class. Here's a short clip. I want Roger Stone's response.
[01:14:32.469 --> 01:14:42.469]  What does that look like in action? Because I know you sort of sit at the fulcrum of peering over into two abysses, if you will. What does that sound like?
[01:14:44.469 --> 01:14:54.469]  Well, I think there's a core point here, which is a lot of Americans are up for grabs. I wouldn't dismiss it as just something that only people on the right or watching Fox News can latch onto.
[01:14:54.469 --> 01:15:10.469]  I mean, we're in a battle for hearts and minds. And there are people who are on the fence. You've got to have leaders and messages and messengers and programs that get to those people, that bring them over into community organizing and into nonprofit organizations and away from the Patriot front and the Oath Keepers.
[01:15:10.469 --> 01:15:20.469]  And I think the parallels with 9-11 are important. We've talked about this before. After 9-11, the laws didn't work. They made massive changes to respond to a new threat.
[01:15:20.469 --> 01:15:36.469]  And I think we have to face the fact that many of our structures, laws and policies may not work. After 9-11, we created the Department of Homeland Security. There was the Patriot Act. There was massive change in our entire society to face the number one threat, or at least what was communicated as the number one threat.
[01:15:36.469 --> 01:15:49.469]  I think we need the same kind of tectonic shift. It's got to be much more than see something, say something. But maybe our laws need to change to respond to the fact that someone like Mike Flynn, the former national security director, is openly calling for violence consistently.
[01:15:51.469 --> 01:16:19.469]  So, they are trying to set up a paramilitary confrontation with American people. R.F.K. Jr. just did an hour-long interview with Tucker. And it's all, what he said is all true. It's been on record that 300 scientists in government and in universities signed a letter saying, and we're going to play it after Roger leaves, saying, please move, stop this illegal gain of function going on at university attack.
[01:16:20.469 --> 01:16:40.469]  Galveston and Chapel Hill, North Carolina and other places. And so, Fauci is over U.S. bio-weapon program, and that's in the documents. R.F.K. talked about it. So, they moved it to China. And then, now we have Senator Johnson and we have EU leaders coming out saying, no, we know they released it on purpose. We know it's a U.N. power grab.
[01:16:40.469 --> 01:16:53.469]  So, the good news is, even a lot of our populist leaders get this now, but the full horror that there are hundreds of labs in the U.S., R.F.K. Jr. talked about, that are making level four bio-weapons that could kill everybody.
[01:16:54.469 --> 01:17:02.469]  Doesn't the average moron federal prosecutor or the average moron FBI agent or the average moron leftist realize this is insane and madness?
[01:17:03.469 --> 01:17:17.469]  I mean, don't they understand cutting off the energy and opening the borders and doing all this is a suicide pact. It's a death cult, and it's incredibly dangerous, and I just don't know how we respond to a group of lunatics like this that are waging war on life itself.
[01:17:18.469 --> 01:17:25.469]  I know that's a mouthful, Roger, but you're either declaring war on us, they've got bio-weapons everywhere designed for the general public, they're leaking them on purpose.
[01:17:25.469 --> 01:17:32.469]  I mean, my God, I guess pray is right, because these people ought to pray for themselves. They're going to kill everybody.
[01:17:33.469 --> 01:17:47.469]  Well, let's correct the record on one important point. General Michael Flynn has never openly advocated violence, not even once. That is a vile lie, and they lie to try to justify their heavy-handed tactics.
[01:17:48.469 --> 01:18:01.469]  It is vitally important that the average patriot not be goaded into some stupid act of violence. That is exactly what they want, some kind of false flag that will cause people to put themselves in harm's way.
[01:18:02.469 --> 01:18:16.469]  But this vilification of General Flynn is absolutely outrageous, and it is a repugnant lie. There is no greater patriotic American and no other greater proponent for the rule of law than General Michael Flynn.
[01:18:17.469 --> 01:18:25.469]  The more they scream about the rule of law, the more they try to goad us into breaking it. Nobody should go for that bait. Thank you, Alex, and God bless you.
[01:18:26.469 --> 01:18:40.469]  All right, Roger, I know you've got to go. I really appreciate you. We'll talk to you again soon, but you're right. Pray for America, pray for President Trump, pray for us, and spread the word and share the articles and videos and share your show and so much more. Roger, thank you.
[01:18:41.469 --> 01:18:42.469]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:47.469]  That's a great idea that he had, that Elon Musk needs to launch a free open search engine.
[01:18:48.469 --> 01:19:01.469]  You know, there's some other so-called independent ones out there, but I noticed what happened with people like DuckDuckGo is they were really open and free for a while, and then it kind of shifted away again to the model.
[01:19:01.469 --> 01:19:20.469]  And, you know, that's really the problem is so much money continues to come in to buy up all of our infrastructure. So I hope, you know, once rumble continues to grow and it's really kicking butt, it's the biggest viable alternative out there right now that's truly not censoring.
[01:19:21.469 --> 01:19:34.469]  And the question is, will they get bought? I mean, maybe we need foundations that are set up by the people that in their bylaws say they can't be sold or bought, and it really is a utility.
[01:19:35.469 --> 01:19:44.469]  How about the U.S. Postal Service that doesn't really have very good use these days is being made obsolete by design. How about one of America's greatest inventions duplicated around the world?
[01:19:45.469 --> 01:20:00.469]  How about they come out with a search engine that just goes back to the say the year 2010 when the web was pretty open and free, couldn't call for violence, couldn't, you know, promote child porn, couldn't organize crimes on it, because that's not free speech.
[01:20:00.469 --> 01:20:22.469]  That's illegal. They're utilities. That's what they are. That's in the law. But nobody's following the utility rules. So I and I'm not even in the government services, but the UN and the IMF and the World Bank and BlackRock are bigger than even the U.S. and Chinese GDP together. Did you know that?
[01:20:22.469 --> 01:20:37.469]  They're bigger than the GDP. They're the government's now. That's what the ESG's are, is their unelected systems and their unelected laws. Things you didn't vote for. Unrepresentative.
[01:20:37.469 --> 01:20:53.469]  So the libertarian think tanks are like, oh, government's the problem. Well, yeah, when it gets big and out of control. But now the corporations are the government. Global corporate governance.
[01:20:54.469 --> 01:21:03.469]  And you look at the Heritage Foundation, the rest of them that do some good work. They just parrot all day long about, oh, well, let's just get rid of public schools.
[01:21:03.469 --> 01:21:14.469]  Yeah, they're horrible. They're cesspools. They're leftists. They're brainwashing. They're terrible in most areas. But in some rural areas, they're pretty good. And they are autonomous and they are independent school districts, but not in the big cities.
[01:21:15.469 --> 01:21:24.469]  But then you look at the private schools now, most of them are getting accredited and getting grants and are just as bad as the public schools.
[01:21:25.469 --> 01:21:36.469]  And so now they're trying to say, we can't get a job if you're homeschooled or whatever, because you don't have an accredited system. So it's like getting rid of apartheid and then bringing something in 10 times worse, communism.
[01:21:37.469 --> 01:21:49.469]  We're not for apartheid. We're not defending it. But it's like saying, would you rather have gonorrhea or brain cancer? You can get rid of gonorrhea. Does it kill you? Brain cancer does.
[01:21:49.469 --> 01:22:11.469]  Apartheid is gonorrhea. Communism in South Africa is terminal brain cancer. And I'll take gonorrhea all day. I'm not saying go back to gonorrhea. I'm saying don't just think, oh, they're reforming. When you tear a building down, you've reformed it. That just means you change it.
[01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:27.469]  The U.S. Army Air Corps reformed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, flattened it like a pancake. If I walk up to you with a machete and chop your head off, I've reformed you.
[01:22:28.469 --> 01:22:51.469]  So when we hear the word reform, we always think, oh, it means it's better. No, it doesn't mean it's better most of the time. And if it's being funded by BlackRock, who said, we're going to control your behavior. Larry, think. We're going to run your life with computers and with a social credit score that is now operational for six years in China and now being brought to your town, your city, run by these people.
[01:22:52.469 --> 01:23:12.469]  Oh, but Google's a private corporation taking orders from the United Nations. In fact, let's play a clip of Melissa Fleming, the undersecretary of the United Nations a few months ago, admitting that they are interfacing and controlling with big tech, with Google, what you can see and read. Here it is.
[01:23:12.469 --> 01:23:16.469]  It's educating. It's hopefully.
[01:23:17.469 --> 01:23:28.469]  And that, you know, we partnered with Google, for example, if you Google climate change, you will at the top of your search, you will get all kinds of U.N. resources.
[01:23:28.469 --> 01:23:39.469]  We started this partnership when we were shocked to see that when we googled climate change, we were getting incredibly distorted information right at the top.
[01:23:39.469 --> 01:23:49.469]  So we're becoming much more proactive. You know, we own the science and we think that the world should know it. And the platforms themselves also do.
[01:23:50.469 --> 01:24:05.469]  We own the science. Science is questioning. Science is trial and error. Science is about debate. No, we're not going to let you debate. We own the science and everything they told us we now know was a lie on top of it.
[01:24:05.469 --> 01:24:11.469]  If they were telling the truth and said they were going to censor you, it would still be dangerous. But it's a lying criminal group.
[01:24:11.469 --> 01:24:23.469]  The Rockefellers set up the U.N. with the Rothschilds on record. You're now seeing their takeover. So how do we deal with this transhumanist depopulationist psycho group?
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:40.520]  What do we do? We have to abolish the FBI. The Justice Department is in the Constitution.
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:46.200]  Congress must impeach Merrick Garland. They've got plenty of reasons to do it. They've got
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:52.960]  to impeach Biden. They've got to put them on trial now. And the Republicans act like
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:56.880]  they're fighting Google and the Globalists and Huawei and the rest of them, but they play
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:03.960]  patty cake with it and act like they're fighting it and play dumb. When Google is run by the
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:09.920]  NSA and the Globalists, government privatized itself and set up a privatized global government
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:14.560]  to run our lives. And they set up communist China to control the rare earth minerals
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:19.840]  and to have a slave system that would lower the standard of living worldwide so that
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:25.720]  we couldn't compete with them. This has been a long term project of the Rockefellers,
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:29.460]  of the Rothschilds. We're going to go to break. I have a clip of that I'm going to
[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:37.040]  play for you and so much more. But this is a premeditated, scientific takeover, one
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:44.000]  hundred and ten percent period. End of story. And every man, woman and child, whether
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.920]  you're black, whether you're gay, whether you're straight, whether you're brown, whether
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:51.660]  you're pink, whether you're an Eskimo or whether you're a Mexican or whether you're
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:57.980]  a German or whether you're Chinese or whether you're a Conganese African, everyone is under
[01:25:57.980 --> 01:26:03.480]  attack by this, whether you're Indian or whether you're Russian, whether you're German
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:09.600]  or whether you're Swiss. It's the end of the world as we know. That's why they
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:15.320]  tell you the world's ending in 2030. And I got Prince Charles. We come back to everybody
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:19.880]  laughs at him and Snykon doing the clock countdown. The earth's going to end. Everything's
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:24.480]  going to collapse by 2030. We don't do what we say. They're the ones collapsing it,
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:27.840]  being the heroes while they turn off the energy, get rid of the borders, turn
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:35.480]  off the security, shut down the food industries. And then say we've only got six years and
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:41.960]  a few days to save you. And then we're all dead while they are creating the catastrophe.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:44.080]  This is so simple once you see it.
[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:52.220]  They're telling you it's the end of the world as you know it, so you accept that as a foregone conclusion.
[01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:56.220]  So you accept that as...
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:03.160]  ...a prophecy that you then self-fulfill.
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:08.160]  All right, we're going to go to break. We're going to come back with all of this.
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:13.160]  Folks, I'm taking on the New World Order. I'm taking them on point blank range. So is this crew.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:17.160]  And, you know, quite frankly, I'm not complaining because it's up to you what you want to do in support.
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:23.160]  But everybody should be sharing the articles and videos. Everybody should be sharing things via word of mouth.

[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:33.160]  And I don't say that with pleasure, because it makes me a big target. But we're the best there is. Full spectrum.

[01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:11.160]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:15.160]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:24.160]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:27.160]  Look it up. Don't let them do this to your family.

[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:31.160]  The big July 4 sale's going on right now.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:34.160]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:35.160]  The enemy's out in the open.
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:36.160]  We're vindicated.
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:37.160]  People are listening more than ever.
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:42.160]  But in this major recession going into depression and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:44.160]  I know times are tough.
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:45.160]  So thank you for your support.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:49.160]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.

[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:55.160]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:57.160]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:58.160]  God bless you.
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:04.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:06.160]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:17.160]  When castles towered over vast landscapes and knights championed honor and valor, there came an unforeseen darkness.
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:25.160]  Amidst this impending doom stood a knight called Alex Jones, a brave and outspoken herald known as the Truth Sayer.
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:27.160]  Sir Alex Jones was not alone.
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:33.160]  In his most desperate hour in the battle against evil, a radiant light descended from the heavens.
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:38.160]  God, in all his glory and his legion of angels, stood by Alex's side.
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:43.160]  The battle raged on, but with every blow, Alex Jones' conviction grew stronger.
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:47.160]  With every truth he proclaimed, the demonic forces faltered.
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:55.160]  When the enemy was vanquished, Alex Jones swore a solemn oath that should the realm need him again, he would return.
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:34:01.160]  And now it's Alex Jones leading a full frontal assault on the satanic new world order.
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:06.160]  Tune in at infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:17.160]  Alright, let me read you some headlines here and then we're going to plunge into the UN documents.
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:20.160]  We'd like to show you the actual documents, not just a news article.
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:29.160]  Up on infowars.com by the great Ben Warren, Biden's set to announce climate lockdowns, rationing of energy and food.
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:33.160]  It's already begun as they cut off the systems.
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:36.160]  Here's another one.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:42.160]  King Charles and Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, activate a climate clock today.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.160]  Total theater.
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:48.160]  Al Gore would be proud, says the Citizens Free Press of Canada.
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:57.160]  Until you realize that it is a military operation, King Charles has announced, with John Kerry and the rest of the criminals,
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:00.160]  to cut off the farms, the resources, the fertilizer.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.160]  It's already begun. It's already accelerated.
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:09.160]  If you thought the lockdowns of the first few years of their attack that they launched in 2020 were bad, this is just the beginning.
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:15.160]  They are putting out to the school children and all through the culture that most of us will be dead by 2030,
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:21.160]  but they're trying to save us if we do what they say and cut the food off, as John Kerry's been saying the last few months,
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:23.160]  that will stop starvation.
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:26.160]  Would you like to see the videos? I've played it about 15 times.
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:28.160]  He did say it. Look it up.
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:33.160]  John Kerry says we must cut farming by 30 percent to stop global warming at least.
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:37.160]  And they're going to ban 90 percent of the farms in the Netherlands in the next seven years.
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:40.160]  They already banned 20 percent, more than 10,000 farms.
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:43.160]  They're the third largest food producer in the world in one year.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:47.160]  Mass starvation. Hundreds of millions dying as we speak.
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:51.160]  And the UN says, oh, everybody's dying. Give UNICEF more money.
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:54.160]  While they kill us.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:59.160]  So let's play the clip from yesterday of them hitting the countdown to doom.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:02.160]  Only six years and a few months and a few days.
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:09.160]  If you don't do exactly what they say, which cut off all the resources that will cause the societal collapse.
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:11.160]  Because people aren't just going to starve to death quietly.
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:16.160]  Cities and the world will collapse and burn.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:20.160]  An angrier world, Klaus Schwab talked about.
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:22.160]  So go to the clip.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:25.160]  Three, two, one.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:29.160]  King Charles helped turn on a climate clock at a summit in London this afternoon.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:36.160]  It triggers 150 similar clocks across the major cities of the UK, counting down the seconds to 2030.
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:43.160]  The estimated deadline for limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:48.160]  But the UK's climate watchdog had a stern warning for the government today.
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:59.160]  The climate change committee said it's confident that the government would meet its own legally binding targets for cutting emissions by the end of the decade had fallen markedly.
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:02.160]  Like the emissions from cows?
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:07.160]  What do cows put out that the coal power plants put out?
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:09.160]  Water vapor and carbon dioxide.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:12.160]  Something else puts out carbon dioxide.
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:28.160]  Whales and dolphins and birds and turtles and fish and bunny rabbits and humans and deer and possums and mice and plankton.
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:30.160]  But they're all bad.
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:33.160]  Carbon is evil.
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:41.160]  Here's a clip of David Rockefeller in the 90s.
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:44.160]  Admits he recruited Kissinger.
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:49.160]  Klaus Schwab then admits he was recruited by Henry Kissinger.
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:57.160]  And Klaus Schwab, the W.F.F. are the puppets of the Rockefeller dynasty recruiting the other leaders as they, quote,
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:01.160]  penetrates the cabinets and takes control of the governments.
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.160]  And what else do we do?
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:07.160]  We set up basic dictatorships.
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:15.160]  My protégé, Justin Trudeau, tell the national TV what you admire.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:26.160]  Oh, you admire basic dictatorship and Xi Jinping and what Klaus Schwab said many times.
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:32.160]  Well, China is the best model and we would like to have it here.
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:34.160]  And you're going to have it.
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:43.160]  Drones giving you orders, forced conscription and forced labor camps, as well as harvesting the organs.
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:54.160]  Liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, happy fun, la, la, la, human smuggling,
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:39:04.160]  forced government euthanasia, chopping up children's genitals, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:14.160]  And a bunch of rich people and kings putting us back under feudalism, telling us it's good for us.
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:16.160]  Okay.
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:18.160]  All righty then.
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:29.160]  Here's the clip from Book TV on C-SPAN with the scion of the New World Order, David Rockefeller.
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:32.160]  And you mentioned David Henry Kissinger.
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:42.160]  And I think he first was noticed by the Rockefeller family after he wrote a very erudite work on nuclear weapons
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:45.160]  and nuclear war back in the late 1950s.
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:46.160]  And foreign policy.
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:47.160]  Right.
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:48.160]  And then published.
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:52.160]  And from that time on, he became pretty close to the Rockefeller family.
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:54.160]  Well, he did.
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:40:03.160]  Actually, I guess I was the first one who got to know him because he was a member of an organization called the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:14.160]  And there was a study group at that time that he, as then a young instructor at Harvard, presided at.
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:21.160]  I was so impressed by him that I introduced him to my brother Nelson, who was then governor in New York,
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:28.160]  and was then considering seeking the presidency of the United States.
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:30.160]  They became great friends.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:38.160]  And actually, Henry became Nelson's foreign policy adviser as long as he was in public life.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:45.160]  And I think is one of the remarkable international statesmen in the world today.
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:55.160]  Even 30 years after he was secretary of state, he is still asked by heads of state when he travels the world for his advice.
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:41:00.160]  Let me go back to the time you said when you came here, it transformed your life.
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:05.160]  Was there a course, a professor, who really made that difference for you?
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:06.160]  Yes.
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:16.160]  There was one course, one seminar of Henry Kissinger, which really opened my eyes.
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:19.160]  I wasn't accepted to the seminar, but I sat in.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:22.160]  I think he let me in because I was German.
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:27.160]  And it was relatively shortly after the war.
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.160]  There were not too many Germans here.
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:36.160]  And this created a friendship which has endured until today.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:40.160]  And you know, Henry has been several times in Davos.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:49.160]  And I think it was mainly participating in his seminars that I developed my interest for geopolitical affairs.
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:52.160]  So let's give you the real fact of history. We'll go to break.
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:56.160]  Klaus Schwab's father and grandfather were top Nazis.
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:59.160]  They come from royalty in Germany.
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:03.160]  And they owned the third largest weapons manufacturer in World War II.
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:09.160]  And his father was at the Bilderberg Group meetings early on.
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:13.160]  And Henry Kissinger was in OSS with David Rockefeller.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:18.160]  And they knew each other in World War II, in the OSS, and that's all on record.
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:25.160]  Oh, I just happened to come to the meeting and he just let me in.
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:28.160]  I met him at Harvard. I just happened to be there.
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:31.160]  And now look all the fun things we've done to you.
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:36.160]  Of course, Henry Kissinger put out State Department Random 200.
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:44.160]  You might want to read our plan to depopulate you forcibly with toxic waste and cutting off the resources.
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:46.160]  Hail Hitler!
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:49.160]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, Infowars.com.
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:53.160]  Tomorrow's news today. Remember, Nazism is brought to you by the ADL.
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:12.160]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:18.160]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of Omega-3s.
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:23.160]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:30.160]  Your best option is our Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil at InfowarsStore.com.

[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:02.160]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:04.160]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:10.160]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mikovitz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones.
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:14.160]  That's because I use Brain Force every day.
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:18.160]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:22.160]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:27.160]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is Brain Force.
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:35.160]  I'll take Brain Force in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:41.160]  So it really is true that Brain Force is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:43.160]  Alright, we love you. We'll be right back.
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:48.160]  Get your Brain Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra, and Turbo Force at Infowarsstore.com.

[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:18.160]  By purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with and you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:20.160]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:23.160]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:28.160]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:30.160]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:33.160]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price for a limited time.
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:40.160]  Ten percent off on top of that exclusively at Infowarsstore.com on the Alexa Pure water filtration system.

[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:46.160]  Get it today and it funds the Infowars.
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:54.160]  Don't procrastinate. This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:57.160]  In some cases they add to the water supply like fluoride.
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:06.780]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:08.180 --> 01:47:23.620]  So, one person a year at Harvard University that really is the heart of the New World
[01:47:23.620 --> 01:47:24.620]  Order.
[01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:25.620]  That's where G.B.
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:28.360]  Pink sits, his daughter.
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:36.180]  One person a year is given a special Ph.D. that Henry Kissinger was the first to be
[01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:43.020]  trained by the globalist in Gibbon, and then he would train, like a Sith Lord, one apprentice
[01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:45.260]  every few years.
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:48.540]  And Klaus Schwab was one of those apprentices.
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:53.940]  Francis Boyle was given Henry Kissinger's office.
[01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:59.220]  He was top scores in the country, became a top UN prosecutor, and he's a lawyer, people
[01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:00.940]  know that.
[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:03.240]  But he never joined them.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:05.780]  They just figured that he was there.
[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:09.440]  They chose him and that he would be one of their people.
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:14.620]  And then when he got the degree and the knowledge, he said, now I'm going to fight you.
[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:20.100]  And we have him on and people don't even know how important he is or what a whistle
[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:21.860]  blower he is.
[01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:25.060]  And he didn't like him from the beginning and was that smart and went through the system
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:29.540]  and got the degrees he was supposed to get to then be brought in and given that
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:30.540]  special Ph.D.
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:31.540]  He had to get what?
[01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:32.540]  Like a whole bunch.
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:33.540]  It was like a Harvard degree.
[01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:34.540]  What was it?
[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:40.740]  It was a Chicago business school which teaches a Straussian philosophy that basically Hitler
[01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:42.820]  followed as well.
[01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:47.300]  So when we say they're Nazis, they're not Nazis with red armbands and they're saying
[01:48:47.300 --> 01:48:49.420]  how Hitler and the Aryan race.
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:51.020]  The end justifies the means.
[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:52.020]  Everybody's dumb animals.
[01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:53.020]  They're going to take over.
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:54.020]  They're going to be gods.
[01:48:54.020 --> 01:48:55.020]  They're the supermen.
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:56.580]  They're the ubermenschens.
[01:48:56.580 --> 01:49:01.260]  And you are the undermenschens.
[01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:02.060]  You're the little people.
[01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:09.060]  And I'm going to explain this to you because it's important. I'm not bragging about it.
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:16.100]  There was one time in meetings I've had with these people, and I've had at least 15 meetings
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:21.660]  with globalists over the years. Fox News tried to hire me. Roger Els tried to hire
[01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:28.280]  me. That was the lower level stuff. Clear Channel tried to hire me 18 years ago. Stuff
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:32.000]  like that. But those were private meetings off record, so I've never given the details
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.780]  of those. Because as a journalist and as somebody, when somebody says it's a private meeting,
[01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:42.460]  unless they discuss crimes, it's a private meeting. And I've had dinner with Bilderberg
[01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:47.340]  Group members, and I've had dinner with billionaires that are household names, okay? And those
[01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:57.340]  are private meetings, and that's that. But 15, 16 years ago, John Harman, the oldest
[01:49:57.340 --> 01:50:04.700]  employee here, used to be my producer. Now he's an affiliate relations head. I told the
[01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:09.700]  producer, I said, I want Rothkop, who's the head of the Kissinger Group, Kissinger's right
[01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:13.660]  hand man. You've all heard the story, but for new listeners, I'll tell it again, an
[01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:18.060]  abbreviated version. I said he's written a new book that I just read about how there's
[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:21.480]  only a few thousand globalists and how they run the planet and how they're a superclass
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:25.300]  and how they know best, which is basically a coming out of the closet event for the
[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:30.860]  New World Order, as you see them now doing times 10. And so we get him on for an hour
[01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:38.420]  interview. And during the first break, he says, Listen, I may leave. So I'm talking
[01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:44.060]  to him during the break. I can punch up guest. And Harman is sitting in the control
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:49.220]  room at a different office in but just like this smaller studio. He's listening
[01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:52.620]  to it. So I have a witness to this. And he says, Listen, Alex, you are going to
[01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:56.980]  be part of the superclass. I came on here to be friendly. I came here to be nice. We
[01:50:56.980 --> 01:51:01.740]  know who you are. We know that you basically are the patriot leader. We have big things
[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:06.420]  in store. And I'd already been offered big jobs. They'd already other groups under
[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:10.220]  them had already come and tried to hire me at that point. They could tell I was
[01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:14.820]  a talented, smart broadcaster. I understood things. And he starts saying, it's always
[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:18.300]  the same speech from these guys. You're talented. You understand things the public
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:21.940]  doesn't need to see the table with us. You could be a star and actually have
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:29.220]  some of your views. Listen to but you'll go nowhere. On your little crusade. Why
[01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:33.740]  don't you come to New York? Oh, we're going back to break. Go back live. So
[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:37.900]  let's have a friendly interview. And I'm like, Well, we'll come right back. So
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:44.580]  we do a second segment, somebody find the Rothkopf interview. It's 2005 2006.
[01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:48.260]  Whenever superclass came out is the year that we had amongst it just come
[01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:53.500]  out. It was the best seller. I do another 10 minutes segment. We go to break
[01:51:53.500 --> 01:52:01.820]  and he goes now. Yeah, there he is. He goes, he goes, I'm leaving. And I
[01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:08.140]  said, Why? And I said, he said, Well, you're just not listening. You just
[01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:12.780]  don't get it. And you're silly. And you're going nowhere with this. If you
[01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:15.940]  come back and are friendly, I'll do the rest of the hour. But it's just
[01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:18.500]  you're not listening to me. And you don't understand this is something
[01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:24.780]  we got to do. And it's for everybody's best interest. And I got the
[01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:27.820]  same speech one time when I was flying to be on the view. I think
[01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:32.500]  like a year later. And I'm in first class American Airlines. And
[01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:35.180]  there's the head of the third largest bank in the US sitting next to
[01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:42.740]  me. This isn't his data retired general in San Antonio. And I got
[01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:45.380]  we talked to him for three hours. We didn't talk the first 30
[01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:48.840]  minutes. I got the same speech. Look, corporations know how to
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:50.940]  run things. The public's too stupid. You need to get on board,
[01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:54.180]  Alex just laughing at me. And I'm at my hair sticking up. It's
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:56.380]  early in the morning. And I'm sitting there and he gets up in
[01:52:56.380 --> 01:52:59.260]  his perfect suit on his perfect black trench coat just laughs at
[01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:03.980]  me at the end of it. And I can tell you now and I've had
[01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:08.100]  meetings with these people, other ones, very high level. They're
[01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:10.980]  not laughing anymore. They're like, Yeah, there's a good chance
[01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:12.740]  it's gonna get out of control. The planet's gonna be destroyed.
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:15.780]  Yeah. So what do you think about this? What do you think
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:19.880]  about that? Three, four hour meetings? No, we want to hire
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:22.900]  you. We want to get you on board. Now they're like, Yeah,
[01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:28.580]  this this looks like it's gonna go bad. So they've tried to
[01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:34.540]  recruit me. I've named names here. Okay. Now my father, 14
[01:53:34.540 --> 01:53:39.500]  years old, genius, top of his class, top of everything. His
[01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:43.260]  mother was a school administrator and my grandmother
[01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:54.780]  really into education. Patty Jones. And she and put him in
[01:53:54.780 --> 01:53:57.180]  all these science fairs and contests and kept winning him.
[01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:06.460]  And at 14, Union Carbide says out of Houston, David Jones
[01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:11.100]  has just won this one contest. We've got another contest for
[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:15.260]  him. And if he can pass this, he should be given a very
[01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:19.980]  special offer. And he's got five days to complete the task.
[01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:25.140]  A truck is arriving in three days at their ranch, their
[01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:31.100]  farm, working farm in East Texas. An 18 Wheeler pulls up
[01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:38.780]  and lowers a big crate in the front yard with no plans or
[01:54:38.780 --> 01:54:45.660]  no designs. My dad tears it apart and in two days, builds
[01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:50.900]  a high powered ruby laser that was some type of
[01:54:50.900 --> 01:55:06.100]  cyclotronic particle beam and starts frying metal. He was
[01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:08.180]  wearing three pairs of sunglasses. He was blind for a
[01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:11.940]  month, burned his eyes. They thought he'd never see again.
[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:17.020]  They came back and they said, Mr. Jones, you're being
[01:55:17.020 --> 01:55:26.980]  recruited by NASA. You're going to be put in Plan 2 in six
[01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:30.780]  months when you're 15 years old, and you're going to be
[01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:35.620]  part of NASA. It's not NASA. He gets sent to UT, gets
[01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:38.380]  evaluated by all these guys. And they go, okay, David, we
[01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:44.220]  got your first job. They send him to MD Anderson Cancer
[01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:51.060]  Research in Houston. And at 15 years old, my father for a
[01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:55.700]  year was part of secret medical experiments on cancer
[01:55:55.700 --> 01:56:02.900]  patients. Then they bring him back to UT and he never told
[01:56:02.900 --> 01:56:07.500]  me this until he saw Endgame before it was finished. And
[01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:09.060]  he went ahead. I knew all about it. I heard about it
[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:11.220]  from his mom. He built the laser and was at the UT and
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:15.820]  then whatever he did after that for a while, he won't talk
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:21.700]  about. But by his late 20s, after I was a couple years
[01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:29.260]  old, he got out of it and said, it's bad. Now, that's
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:33.460]  just my dad, folks. Do you have any idea how many
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:39.820]  people they have recruited for this thing? Because the
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:43.060]  head of the UT botany department that ran the Plan 2
[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:52.340]  program, it's what it's called. Professor Strauss
[01:56:54.740 --> 01:57:02.700]  called my dad in and said, David, we've searched the
[01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:05.700]  whole country of the six finalists. You're the number
[01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:08.900]  one finalist. We're now going to reveal to you what this
[01:57:08.940 --> 01:57:12.260]  project is. And it's basically everything you see now.
[01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:17.100]  Worldwide government, worldwide eugenics, the whole
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:23.380]  shooting match. And then they gave him some other
[01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:25.020]  mission he won't tell me about. And he got out of
[01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:30.460]  it. That's the real world, folks. That's how things
[01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:34.020]  really work. Grow up. These people are going to kill
[01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:37.860]  every damn one of us. Now, I didn't join them. And
[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:40.340]  my dad didn't join them. But I want you to
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:43.900]  understand this is as real as anything on earth.
[01:57:44.380 --> 01:57:44.940]  We'll be right back.

[02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:21.860]  We can listen to the engine morning is one
[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:26.420]  note song. You can think about the woman or
[02:00:26.420 --> 02:00:30.660]  the girl you knew the night before, but your
[02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:37.260]  thoughts soon. But your thoughts will soon be
[02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:41.940]  wandering the way they always do. When you're
[02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:46.060]  riding 16 hours and there's nothing much to
[02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:50.500]  do. And you don't feel much like riding. You
[02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:52.140]  just want to do the makeup. It's been joining
[02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:53.780]  us for the rest of the hour starting in six
[02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:57.100]  minutes. But I mentioned this show on another
[02:00:57.100 --> 02:01:04.940]  show to you. See you on the road again. Here I
[02:01:04.940 --> 02:01:14.900]  am up on stage on the stage. Here I go. Plan
[02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:20.940]  star again. There I go. Turn the page. Turn
[02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:25.540]  the page. All right. So we're under UN world
[02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:27.500]  government with an endgame to slowly collapse
[02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:30.180]  society while the collapses poses the saviors as
[02:01:30.180 --> 02:01:33.540]  they kill seven and a half billion people at
[02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:47.740]  least. We are at the verge of oblivion. But
[02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:52.820]  you just want to explode. Yeah, I see the
[02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:55.020]  unwashed masses. I see other lazy and dumb
[02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:57.500]  down. I see other systems on everything they
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:00.700]  can to make them that way. But I see the
[02:02:00.700 --> 02:02:04.220]  globalist, the inbred scum, the self appointed
[02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:08.860]  arrogance. They're the disease. They all
[02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:13.140]  killed themselves. Then I might respect them a
[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:19.540]  little. Then I might listen to their plan. But
[02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:23.100]  they're not in a position to play God. And
[02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:27.940]  God is going to destroy them. And if we don't
[02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:29.860]  stand up against them, God's going to destroy
[02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:33.580]  us and say, I don't know you. I don't need
[02:02:33.580 --> 02:02:36.660]  to intellectually comprehend their operation
[02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:38.060]  and decide whether I want to join them or
[02:02:38.060 --> 02:02:44.100]  not. Because my cells, my soul, my guts tell
[02:02:44.100 --> 02:02:48.180]  me it's evil. My maker tells me to fight
[02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:51.580]  them. My maker commands me to resist them.
[02:02:52.420 --> 02:02:55.540]  What does your maker tell you to do? Because
[02:02:55.540 --> 02:02:58.660]  if you side with these people, God is not your
[02:02:58.660 --> 02:03:02.540]  father. Your father is the devil.
[02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:17.620]  Google announces worldwide ban on independent
[02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:21.100]  media from search results. But let's not just
[02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:27.300]  believe the news article. Let's look at this.
[02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:30.380]  Sweden's psychological defense agency. Oh, that's
[02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:33.540]  a better name than the Ministry of Truth. They
[02:03:33.540 --> 02:03:37.220]  were setting up here the government office of
[02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:38.980]  fact checking. Remember that? Which is
[02:03:38.980 --> 02:03:43.060]  operating. No, the psychological defense agency
[02:03:43.060 --> 02:03:45.380]  will cover up medical disinfo. It'll tell you
[02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:47.780]  the COVID shot works when it's not true. Or
[02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:49.540]  the mask work when it's not true. Yeah,
[02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:50.460]  that's what they're setting up that
[02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:52.900]  interfaces with the UN. And here is the UN
[02:03:52.940 --> 02:03:56.820]  website. UN.org contributions the online
[02:03:56.820 --> 02:03:59.620]  consultations of the global digital compact, a
[02:03:59.620 --> 02:04:05.060]  global compact, a global ruling government of
[02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:08.980]  the UN and the corporations of programming. A
[02:04:08.980 --> 02:04:11.340]  global digital compact on open, free and secure
[02:04:11.340 --> 02:04:13.420]  digital future for all, which is the complete
[02:04:13.420 --> 02:04:17.620]  opposite. Might want to go read it. It's got
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:25.740]  sun symbol here. It's rainbow sivastica. All how
[02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:28.020]  the UN is interfacing running the censorship.
[02:04:28.180 --> 02:04:30.220]  But I just showed you the Undersecretary
[02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:35.620]  General, the Deputy Secretary General, telling

[02:04:43.420 --> 02:04:47.660]  going to shut off our communications and
[02:04:47.660 --> 02:04:50.580]  they're going to shut off our hearts. Dr. Judy

[02:06:20.290 --> 02:06:28.930]  From the mfullwars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:28.930 --> 02:06:38.370]  Well many years ago, Dr. Judy Megovitz was set up and arrested by Fauci for exposing
[02:06:38.370 --> 02:06:44.650]  that human simian virus 40 amongst other things is being put in the vaccine supply.
[02:06:44.650 --> 02:06:50.410]  I was thinking about her last week when we spent five days, large parts of those broadcasts
[02:06:50.410 --> 02:06:55.450]  showing the FDA website admitting that simian virus 40 is in many of the vaccines, that
[02:06:55.450 --> 02:07:00.290]  it's in the COVID shot, major studies that it's there, but then Snopes and the fact
[02:07:00.290 --> 02:07:06.570]  checkers and Google telling you it's not and the UN running that censorship.
[02:07:06.570 --> 02:07:12.010]  Also alpha-gal and the bovine protein that they admit causing many of the allergies,
[02:07:12.010 --> 02:07:16.490]  that's in the FDA documents and I left that stack of documents on my desk at home that
[02:07:16.490 --> 02:07:17.490]  I covered last week.
[02:07:17.490 --> 02:07:21.530]  You all saw it so I have Rob Dew who's really on this printing it all for me so I'll have
[02:07:21.530 --> 02:07:22.530]  that by next segment.
[02:07:22.530 --> 02:07:26.450]  I had them all highlighted, you saw it like five times last week, but she's written
[02:07:26.450 --> 02:07:27.450]  books on it.
[02:07:27.450 --> 02:07:31.370]  She's made films on it with the great Mickey Willis who's going to be on with me Friday
[02:07:31.370 --> 02:07:35.050]  on the new special show that I'll tell you about in a moment.
[02:07:35.050 --> 02:07:40.770]  But breaking horrific update HIV infected green monkey DNA found in COVID-19 vaccines,
[02:07:40.770 --> 02:07:45.670]  the human genome is permanently altered, plague of corruption, the subsections of our New
[02:07:45.670 --> 02:07:49.770]  York Times bestseller that gets into all that.
[02:07:49.770 --> 02:07:52.250]  She is beyond vindicated.
[02:07:52.250 --> 02:07:57.690]  So we'll look at alpha-gal, we'll look at simian virus 40 and again we'll reprint
[02:07:57.690 --> 02:07:59.570]  all those and do real fast highlight them.
[02:07:59.570 --> 02:08:04.010]  Right up to him I go, oh where's my folder, oh it's, I've been so obsessed with it
[02:08:04.010 --> 02:08:08.830]  it's on my desk at home I was reading it yesterday and I forgot it.
[02:08:08.830 --> 02:08:11.910]  But anybody can look this up and it's well I guess you try to go to Google though that
[02:08:11.910 --> 02:08:15.590]  says they're delisting all alternative media that's not certified by the UN cover that
[02:08:15.590 --> 02:08:16.750]  last hour.
[02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:21.070]  It's on the FDA website they admit SV40 contaminated it's in the studies but you
[02:08:21.070 --> 02:08:27.310]  type in SV40 COVID vaccine all the fact-checkers doesn't exist doesn't exist doesn't exist
[02:08:27.310 --> 02:08:32.190]  just like ivermectin doesn't help and vitamin D doesn't help and vitamin C doesn't help
[02:08:32.190 --> 02:08:38.030]  all the things they knew did work that they lied about.
[02:08:38.030 --> 02:08:44.510]  So she is a top scientist, virologist, worked at the top labs an incredible whistleblower
[02:08:44.510 --> 02:08:52.050]  just a true hero and she joins us here in just a moment look at that Rob new has a
[02:08:52.050 --> 02:08:56.230]  whole stack separately whoa got it quick I just had another highlighted stack I got
[02:08:56.230 --> 02:09:00.630]  so many of these okay and then tell Rob the stack I have at home is about twice
[02:09:00.630 --> 02:09:03.830]  as thick so give me everything else you got because I'm gonna I'm gonna show everybody
[02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:10.630]  this look at that FDA, CDC overhead shot not pulling this out of my rear end here okay
[02:09:10.630 --> 02:09:15.590]  on the alpha gal on the SV40 on it all okay we're gonna get to it all yeah I need
[02:09:15.590 --> 02:09:21.350]  all the SV40 stuff okay there's the SV40 stuff so we're gonna be getting into all
[02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:26.990]  of this coming up we got that quick sorry I dropped the ball guys so we're gonna go
[02:09:26.990 --> 02:09:29.870]  to Judy here in a moment we're gonna skip this break she has more time but let me
[02:09:29.910 --> 02:09:35.470]  just say this here right now so many listeners have called the show so many people on the street
[02:09:35.470 --> 02:09:42.070]  have said hey why did you get rid of present planet TV in 2016 it had a hundred thousand
[02:09:42.070 --> 02:09:48.550]  subscribers it was bringing in lots of money and it's because it was the archive of our show
[02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:52.750]  they were starting to censor us and take our videos down that were free and so listeners
[02:09:52.750 --> 02:09:57.390]  knew they were members so we they fund this they get first access to stuff it would be an
[02:09:57.390 --> 02:10:02.110]  archive but then we put it all out for free as well was truly a way to donate now the backup
[02:10:02.110 --> 02:10:07.270]  then we were bringing in plenty of money in 2016 I was getting the money in hiring more
[02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:12.910]  people didn't need more money myself so I said prison planet TV is now free and now it's an
[02:10:12.910 --> 02:10:20.670]  archive of the world people are going through it it's incredible but over the years the
[02:10:20.670 --> 02:10:24.550]  lawsuits the attacks I've not been as persecuted as she has they tried to criminally charge me
[02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:28.990]  that's come out in the news a bunch of grand jury's been in panel but by the grace of God knock
[02:10:28.990 --> 02:10:34.870]  on wood that hasn't happened yet hope it doesn't happen but this is serious we're risking our lives
[02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:42.190]  here in our bodily autonomy for freedom so it's not a risk at all people say hey if you want
[02:10:42.190 --> 02:10:48.070]  us to support you why don't you start a subscription show well I do three four hours a day this is
[02:10:48.070 --> 02:10:53.070]  on a lot of radio stations we reach millions I don't want to do that but Steven Crowder is
[02:10:53.070 --> 02:10:57.910]  really good at subscription he reaches millions and millions a day and so I do want to start
[02:10:57.910 --> 02:11:01.230]  doing the fourth hour of the future commercial free with special guests and things that
[02:11:01.230 --> 02:11:05.190]  subscription I'm starting a three-hour show that we tape every week that airs Friday
[02:11:05.190 --> 02:11:10.470]  through a deep dive on Bill Gates unlike anything ever seen for two hours with Mickey
[02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:17.070]  Willis that's gonna go out Friday we're gonna shoot it tomorrow so you don't just get my
[02:11:17.070 --> 02:11:21.990]  new show I'm doing you don't just get all of Steven Crowder shows and all his other talk
[02:11:22.030 --> 02:11:28.030]  shows like ten different shows now you get my new show and you're funding us so it's a straight
[02:11:28.030 --> 02:11:31.990]  up way to build infrastructure as the money comes in I'm gonna hire some reporters and other people
[02:11:31.990 --> 02:11:37.350]  in a whole new system around that and it's not just give me the fourth hour there'll be
[02:11:37.350 --> 02:11:42.510]  subscriber in the future in a few months if we get this done but I'm gonna start events
[02:11:42.510 --> 02:11:45.750]  and special reports all the things that I want to do I always do what I say I'm gonna do
[02:11:45.750 --> 02:11:50.230]  it just takes me longer so I'm asking you you want me to fight you want me to bust my
[02:11:50.270 --> 02:11:55.030]  ass even harder I want to do it but I need funds to do it should go to Jones Crowder
[02:11:55.030 --> 02:12:00.670]  calm Jones Crowder calm and you get a year membership you get one month free right there
[02:12:00.670 --> 02:12:05.550]  it's like 80 bucks and then that pays for the bandwidth the infrastructure and then with the
[02:12:05.550 --> 02:12:11.710]  money that comes in we are gonna expand info Wars and a whole separate operation as well
[02:12:11.710 --> 02:12:15.190]  so part of the money goes to info Wars partners to rumble great platform Steven Crowder
[02:12:15.190 --> 02:12:19.510]  like 20% and then the rest goes to build the new infrastructure so if you want to
[02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:22.110]  fight the new world order do you want to see more guests like this and you want to save
[02:12:22.110 --> 02:12:28.150]  lives you want to do all you can don't wait don't procrastinate your destiny my destiny
[02:12:28.150 --> 02:12:32.710]  our children's destiny is in your hands go to Jones Crowder calm use promo code Alex
[02:12:32.710 --> 02:12:37.990]  and get a free month and do it now and tell everybody you know do it now it takes money
[02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:42.390]  to win wars it takes money to fund infrastructure we're doing everything we can to fix this
[02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:46.470]  peacefully we're trying to put all of us in prison but they're putting the whole
[02:12:46.470 --> 02:12:50.110]  planet under a medical tyranny prison if we don't stop them so this is history
[02:12:50.110 --> 02:12:56.830]  self-preservation I don't even see a question of you doing this everyone listening must go to
[02:12:56.830 --> 02:13:00.230]  Jones Crowder calm and get a membership and if you got the money by 10 of them and give
[02:13:00.230 --> 02:13:05.550]  them away to friends and family this is a war and then obviously have highlights and clips
[02:13:05.550 --> 02:13:10.110]  from a subscription site and if it's successful which I believe it is gonna be it's already
[02:13:10.110 --> 02:13:14.830]  somewhat successful then we will take most of it and make it free after you get first access to
[02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:19.750]  it but this is about funding and resistance you've already seen we're not playing games we don't
[02:13:19.750 --> 02:13:29.430]  back down but we can't do it without you all right dr. Judy Megalovitz dr. Judy a-m-i-k-a-v-i-t-s

[02:13:36.790 --> 02:13:41.790]  support what she's doing out of all the medical doctors and scientists she has been persecuted
[02:13:41.790 --> 02:13:45.590]  the most that she's been the most hardcore and over the target telling you tomorrow's news
[02:13:45.590 --> 02:13:49.910]  today while the globalists lie to you about what's happening now she tells you the truth
[02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:55.190]  about what's coming next truly tomorrow's news today so doctor we salute you I'm gonna
[02:13:55.190 --> 02:14:02.990]  skip the break I'm gonna try to shut up you've got 16 minutes till break hosting the show
[02:14:02.990 --> 02:14:18.310]  okay well simian virus 40 is an XMRV it's actually manufactured in the Vero monkey kidney cell line
[02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:30.790]  this is the same African green monkey cell line that actually also houses HIV at the GP 120
[02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:36.030]  remember last time we talked it was the realization in this discovery in the movie
[02:14:36.030 --> 02:14:46.550]  plandemic originally plandemic from May 4 2020 that in fact the the polio vaccines
[02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:55.750]  there's a typo there but that's all right the polio vaccine is comes is made in Vero
[02:14:55.870 --> 02:15:05.230]  monkey kidney cell lines so the SV 40 that's hitting the news was known to us in the 1980s
[02:15:05.230 --> 02:15:14.550]  the Vero monkey kidney cell line has been used to grow viruses since 1960s when it was first
[02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:24.630]  made and so I've made sub clones of that in 1990 called Vero e6 so of course the DNA virus
[02:15:24.630 --> 02:15:32.950]  is found in the shot because the cell line is where you grow the plasmid the expression vector
[02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:38.950]  and of course we knew this not from our book plague of corruption but from our book plague
[02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:48.190]  and what I'm showing you is the Ventura County Star newspaper article from 2011 when I was
[02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:58.030]  kidnapped as a felony fugitive from justice and we all know now that justice is Tony Fauci oh I was
[02:15:58.030 --> 02:16:04.990]  never arrested and held in that jail I was kidnapped and held there and attempted to be you
[02:16:04.990 --> 02:16:17.550]  know tortured and made and attempted to get me to lie about the facts that XMRZRVs SV 40
[02:16:17.550 --> 02:16:27.550]  is the first XMRV it's the 40th virus isolated from the monkeys it's an African green
[02:16:27.550 --> 02:16:37.590]  monkey we have simian immunodeficiency virus which is SIV from the same monkey cell line
[02:16:37.590 --> 02:16:45.070]  that we grow the polio vaccines so we of course it's there it's an effort it's the cell
[02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:51.190]  line that's been in our lab this is all a smokescreen in a red herring so that you
[02:16:51.190 --> 02:17:02.110]  don't know that in fact SARS-CoV-2 is an XMRV xenotropic the M stands for manufactured
[02:17:02.110 --> 02:17:10.270]  synthetic RNA yeah they've all been manufactured gain-of-function since the 80s SARS-CoV-2 was
[02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:20.990]  made in 2004 and injected in every polio vaccine grown manufactured from that same
[02:17:20.990 --> 02:17:30.830]  Vero E6 go back to Tony Fauci's paper of 2014 this is all exactly that comes straight
[02:17:30.830 --> 02:17:37.990]  from Bobby Kennedy's foreword of our book all of these things that monkey viruses we
[02:17:37.990 --> 02:17:46.190]  all now know beyond a shadow of a doubt not a single vaccine had a placebo control why
[02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:52.930]  do you think Bill Gates in 2020 said everybody go get a polio shot why do you think people
[02:17:52.930 --> 02:18:00.810]  are testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 because it's grown and manufactured oh and they tried
[02:18:00.810 --> 02:18:07.850]  to make me do it in 1980 with the deadly HTLV-1 oh in an open-air centrifuge in Fort
[02:18:07.850 --> 02:18:16.450]  Detrick this isn't a China virus at all they never ever filtered never ever did a placebo
[02:18:16.450 --> 02:18:23.930]  control you know so this is all rewriting the literature criminally fraudulent literature
[02:18:23.930 --> 02:18:34.170]  to cover up why is my pen on my microscope a picture taken in 2006 in a local newspaper
[02:18:34.170 --> 02:18:40.410]  where they murdered my husband in 2021 you know and called it COVID no there never was
[02:18:40.410 --> 02:18:53.370]  a COVID folks HIV is Lyme disease GP 120 they changed the name of CCR5 had a had a
[02:18:53.370 --> 02:19:00.450]  cure called peptide T and it's in our book ending plague where Frank Garcetti and Luke
[02:19:00.450 --> 02:19:05.970]  Montagier talked in great detail before Luke Montagier was murdered too February
[02:19:05.970 --> 02:19:13.330]  8th of 2022 so these and they killed the Nobel Prize winner he was as well who said
[02:19:13.330 --> 02:19:19.770]  the PCR test was a fraud who invented it correct and and this it never was an infectious
[02:19:19.770 --> 02:19:29.450]  virus this is COVID syncytia this was a picture taken in 2006 from my work 2006
[02:19:29.450 --> 02:19:36.090]  why is it in a Ventura County newspaper talking about our first book plague of corruption
[02:19:36.090 --> 02:19:46.850]  I'm sorry plague which came out November 16th the other book plague November 16th 2014
[02:19:46.850 --> 02:19:57.370]  why is COVID in Ventura County California in 2014 COVID is premeditated murder of all
[02:19:57.370 --> 02:20:03.210]  the people you injected sorry I threw that across the room of all the people that you
[02:20:03.210 --> 02:20:12.850]  murdered you injected with SV40 with HIV with simian immune deficiency vials with Ebola
[02:20:12.850 --> 02:20:20.410]  every one of those viruses the paper was published in 2011 after I was locked
[02:20:20.410 --> 02:20:29.050]  down out of my lab three and Tony Fauci took control of all the samples of all the solutions
[02:20:29.050 --> 02:20:37.730]  of all the cures and then between 11 and 14 while I was held science that's it intrepid
[02:20:37.730 --> 02:20:46.730]  search what is chronic Lyme disease it's HIV Adam Lanza killed what had Lyme disease
[02:20:46.730 --> 02:20:55.690]  psyche psychotropic neurotropic it's not mass formation it's causing these brain injuries he
[02:20:55.690 --> 02:21:02.530]  shot those kids because Fauci first shot him if you want to use a little um yeah people are
[02:21:02.530 --> 02:21:10.050]  being shot Fauci knew women and children got xm RVs breast cancer oh talking about Mickey
[02:21:10.050 --> 02:21:16.530]  Willis's mom and brother they were forced on a hepatitis B vaccine HIV is the first gain of
[02:21:16.730 --> 02:21:22.770]  function it never was lab that's what Luke Montagnier isolated none of us ever said
[02:21:22.770 --> 02:21:28.370]  cause any disease because look how good our god-given immune system is any one of these
[02:21:28.370 --> 02:21:33.450]  doesn't have to cause disease if you don't keep injecting these kids if you don't keep
[02:21:33.450 --> 02:21:39.970]  poisoning these people with drugs that drove your diagnostic strategy antibody positive means
[02:21:40.170 --> 02:21:48.090]  immune and we're done done with Fauci and the media coverage look at that you know I'm held
[02:21:48.090 --> 02:21:53.770]  in jail my husband's killed killed my daughter-in-law's killed you know denied
[02:21:53.770 --> 02:22:01.410]  drugs that could save their lives and that's 2014 and every medical personnel in Ventura was
[02:22:01.410 --> 02:22:10.330]  lied to that's five years to six years before COVID Bobby knew all of this when he wrote the
[02:22:10.330 --> 02:22:18.170]  foreword of our book that book was finished in the summer of 2019 I started that book August
[02:22:18.170 --> 02:22:29.090]  31st 2014 that was the day I met Brian Hooker and read the little CDC from William Thompson's
[02:22:29.090 --> 02:22:35.810]  notebook what are we gonna do about the problem with the blacks to Julie Gerberding to the whole
[02:22:35.810 --> 02:22:43.490]  head of the CDC what was the problem with the blacks that when you injected MMR three RNA
[02:22:43.490 --> 02:22:51.250]  mRNA viruses never cleaned out of those monkey cells never cleaned away from any one of those
[02:22:51.250 --> 02:22:59.890]  other viruses recombining chimeras Oh put a little HIV head the simian virus the monkey
[02:22:59.890 --> 02:23:05.170]  virus didn't kill anybody except those poor little black boys who were injected under the
[02:23:05.170 --> 02:23:09.450]  age of three and people hate it when I talk about this but they're going out right by the
[02:23:09.450 --> 02:23:13.330]  way Judy I said you got the floor you're doing a great job but we forget Fauci and before the
[02:23:13.330 --> 02:23:17.890]  media was totally controlled was even in the New York Times in the in the late 80s early 90s
[02:23:17.890 --> 02:23:23.050]  they took tens of thousands of black children from poor black mothers and then put them in
[02:23:23.050 --> 02:23:28.570]  secret HIV testing with drugs and more Fauci ran that he didn't just take German shepherds
[02:23:28.570 --> 02:23:34.050]  and beagles and remove their vocal cords and torture them with flesh-eating worms they
[02:23:34.050 --> 02:23:40.290]  literally tortured tens of thousands of black children to death absolutely and gave them
[02:23:40.290 --> 02:23:49.130]  four times the dose of flu vaccine and and as I was standing on the curb with RZA from RZA Islam
[02:23:49.130 --> 02:23:56.250]  at the CDC in 2018 and this is on our website the real Dr. Judy we just tweeted it today my
[02:23:56.250 --> 02:24:02.570]  talk saying the flu vaccines are killing everybody it never was COVID that was premeditated
[02:24:02.570 --> 02:24:08.530]  murder of everybody they injected and injured and experimented on without informed consent
[02:24:08.650 --> 02:24:14.290]  without informed consent for 40 years not a single safety study we're following Aaron
[02:24:14.290 --> 02:24:20.410]  Syria and his brilliant work on the high wire last week where he showed you again the interview
[02:24:20.410 --> 02:24:25.770]  from years ago yeah we've all been on the ground fighting this for a really long time and
[02:24:25.770 --> 02:24:32.370]  somehow now Bobby Kennedy's a racist and and and and somehow his statements he knows all the
[02:24:32.370 --> 02:24:36.970]  truth you know and so does so does President Trump they know all the truth and look how
[02:24:37.010 --> 02:24:44.410]  they're going after him Oh racketeering that's the lawsuit I filed yeah in in November November
[02:24:44.410 --> 02:24:52.610]  18th of 2011 right when they publish that in the newspaper article oh and the 9th circuit
[02:24:52.610 --> 02:25:02.650]  court the FBI and the DOJ the FBI and the DOJ left literally that case my RICO case
[02:25:02.650 --> 02:25:11.530]  key Tam you died by submitted it pro se with the help of lawyer dr. Ma I sorry Michael R Hugo
[02:25:11.530 --> 02:25:17.370]  who helped Barbara low Fisher write the compensation program from the injured as they
[02:25:17.370 --> 02:25:22.530]  experimented among in our book plague of corruption is the corruption that is the the
[02:25:22.530 --> 02:25:29.610]  so-called vaccine court where the vaccine is presumed innocent at all costs we were right
[02:25:29.650 --> 02:25:38.650]  there in Atlanta February 27th and 28th of 2019 as they tried to give you a Japanese
[02:25:38.650 --> 02:25:44.610]  encephalitis vaccine and I wasn't allowed to comment but I I sit in every meeting and I
[02:25:44.610 --> 02:25:50.050]  heard them and they said get written comments those written comments are right there where dr.
[02:25:50.050 --> 02:25:55.130]  Resetti and I talk it's on our website at all it's in our crimes against humanities
[02:25:55.130 --> 02:26:02.570]  to her for two years ago they Fauci killed the women and children remember I are thrash
[02:26:02.570 --> 02:26:11.170]  remember why and why remember never forget the people who died in the laws act up gave us you
[02:26:11.170 --> 02:26:19.050]  can't ask if somebody's HIV infected may give out oral immunization oral immunizations I've got
[02:26:19.050 --> 02:26:26.130]  that in my room right now they're called Jen boy a disco be Truvada oh those are AIDS drugs and
[02:26:26.130 --> 02:26:32.530]  you can the media shows you every night highly active antiretroviral therapy after they
[02:26:32.530 --> 02:26:39.410]  poisoned everybody after they poisoned everybody oh they made oral immunization strategy so you
[02:26:39.410 --> 02:26:46.930]  can live your lifestyle and they give it away to every single HIV infected person in this
[02:26:46.930 --> 02:26:52.570]  country at the cost of the taxpayers of three to ten thousand dollars and they aren't even
[02:26:52.570 --> 02:27:00.050]  residents they aren't even they aren't even citizens the taxpayers are paying are paying
[02:27:00.050 --> 02:27:05.890]  for the crimes Fauci committed in the doctor you listen I've studied this for years and so I
[02:27:05.890 --> 02:27:12.970]  could follow you but you're moving so fast here doc just give us a big picture there's
[02:27:12.970 --> 02:27:17.730]  clearly an operation Fauci's been running it for forty-something years to to to to to put
[02:27:17.730 --> 02:27:21.210]  these viruses into people and as you said last time that nobody else is saying and I agree
[02:27:21.210 --> 02:27:27.250]  with you they then use this five virus chimera to cover up the fact that it's coming out that
[02:27:27.250 --> 02:27:31.450]  they'd infected the entire vaccine supply they'd had c-span talks about what are we gonna
[02:27:31.450 --> 02:27:37.170]  do as it comes out that we've given billions cancer and an autoimmune issues and and done
[02:27:37.170 --> 02:27:41.090]  all this as if it was an accident and then they give you a new shot that has all of it
[02:27:41.090 --> 02:27:45.490]  that pollutes everybody even more so they can later point back to that which they then have
[02:27:45.490 --> 02:27:50.650]  liability protection for is that what you're saying yeah and not new shots but most importantly
[02:27:50.650 --> 02:27:55.690]  here's how easy it is to fix it never again get another shot don't walk anywhere near a
[02:27:55.690 --> 02:27:59.690]  grocery store with a pharmacy and if they're shooting the poison around the room and they
[02:27:59.690 --> 02:28:07.210]  always had in every flu shot they knew it it wasn't COVID it was influenza four thousand
[02:28:07.210 --> 02:28:14.090]  people a week dying from the ones they cloned from the 1918 Spanish flu the first author is
[02:28:14.090 --> 02:28:21.250]  read the paper in Journal of Virology 2004 the same time within the same few months that
[02:28:21.250 --> 02:28:28.770]  more paper in Journal of Virology was was published showing every polio vaccine and so
[02:28:28.770 --> 02:28:33.090]  what you're saying is we're gonna break is this is part of a long-term plan I want to ask
[02:28:33.090 --> 02:28:37.850]  you how it's going for them they're saying new viruses are coming new pandemics more lockdowns

[02:33:22.370 --> 02:33:29.890]  front lines of the info war talking to dr. Judy Mikovits really upsets me because I've
[02:33:29.890 --> 02:33:35.970]  been on air 29 years and I remember all the different sometimes lethal medical experiments
[02:33:35.970 --> 02:33:42.050]  in Africa in Latin America and in poor white areas of Appalachia here's some of those headlines
[02:33:42.050 --> 02:33:50.850]  but this is really eugenics this is mad scientist government tested age drugs on foster kids NBC
[02:33:50.850 --> 02:33:59.770]  news NIH tested age drugs lethal ones on foster children mainly black government concludes some
[02:33:59.770 --> 02:34:01.810]  age drug experiments on foster children
[02:34:02.250 --> 02:34:06.930]  even the New York Times said it was horrible
[02:34:06.930 --> 02:34:10.130]  you click images it shows a little black children particularly they would
[02:34:10.130 --> 02:34:13.890]  in cases they would you know the one would have a two-year-old they were
[02:34:13.890 --> 02:34:16.370]  going to take that child too unless you shine off on your eight-year-old
[02:34:16.370 --> 02:34:20.170]  and they would take them and slowly kill them and sometimes the kids would escape
[02:34:20.170 --> 02:34:23.930]  they'd send them back and still kill them
[02:34:23.930 --> 02:34:28.010]  and Al Fauci blocked what was really happening with HIV and gave them
[02:34:28.010 --> 02:34:32.330]  AZT and killed people. Judy you've you've moved over a big waterfront here and I
[02:34:32.330 --> 02:34:33.930]  want you to speak about the history of this
[02:34:33.930 --> 02:34:37.290]  but first what do you think the globalists are going to pull
[02:34:37.290 --> 02:34:40.650]  next? They see a new deadly things coming, more lockdowns
[02:34:40.650 --> 02:34:44.010]  they've tried the monkey pox, they've tried Marburg, fair mongering
[02:34:44.010 --> 02:34:48.930]  even the UN has admitted and the head of the Clinton Foundation
[02:34:48.930 --> 02:34:52.890]  has admitted that now the public and statistics show it don't trust these shots
[02:34:52.890 --> 02:34:53.770]  even more than ever
[02:34:53.770 --> 02:34:57.810]  so there's a lot of positive things happening. Millions now killed, 20 million
[02:34:57.850 --> 02:34:59.210]  around the world from the shots
[02:34:59.210 --> 02:35:02.850]  top European doctors are breaking down the numbers, insurance actuaries show this
[02:35:02.850 --> 02:35:07.050]  I mean this is the greatest crime in history, it's ongoing
[02:35:07.050 --> 02:35:12.850]  but what were they planning to do, what's the ultimate goal of this
[02:35:12.850 --> 02:35:13.730]  from your deep research
[02:35:13.730 --> 02:35:17.210]  and then how is it going for them?
[02:35:17.210 --> 02:35:20.570]  Well the ultimate goal is to destroy
[02:35:20.570 --> 02:35:25.410]  all the evidence of this, destroy all the evidence
[02:35:25.610 --> 02:35:30.290]  of, you know, here. I spoke up about what Fauci's doing
[02:35:30.290 --> 02:35:35.330]  and remember one of the radio stations, a lot of folks listen to me on podcasts or audio
[02:35:35.330 --> 02:35:36.930]  so talk about those news articles
[02:35:36.930 --> 02:35:40.530]  of where you exposed them so they came and arrested you, I mean
[02:35:40.530 --> 02:35:45.050]  you've been totally vindicated. Correct, so this news article is from the
[02:35:45.050 --> 02:35:47.170]  Ventura County Star
[02:35:47.170 --> 02:35:50.610]  and it was the Sunday after Thanksgiving
[02:35:50.610 --> 02:35:53.970]  which was one week after that book Plague
[02:35:54.130 --> 02:35:57.210]  came out, I was kidnapped
[02:35:57.210 --> 02:36:01.090]  felony fugitive from justice, the fugitive was Fauci
[02:36:01.090 --> 02:36:04.530]  police in actors, actors in uniforms
[02:36:04.530 --> 02:36:08.610]  actors, bad actors but good enough to fool the Ventura County
[02:36:08.610 --> 02:36:14.290]  sheriff, oh yeah they held me in that jail and tried to get me to say I
[02:36:14.290 --> 02:36:15.530]  made a mistake
[02:36:15.530 --> 02:36:18.770]  about the XMRVs again, XMRVs
[02:36:18.770 --> 02:36:21.890]  look at the mechanism he's showing you on the wall
[02:36:22.010 --> 02:36:28.090]  we know exactly how HIV caused AIDS, that was my PhD thesis in 1991
[02:36:28.090 --> 02:36:31.770]  so why did you inject an HIV GP 120
[02:36:31.770 --> 02:36:35.530]  and change the name, you know, change the name
[02:36:35.530 --> 02:36:40.010]  of Lyme disease, why did you inject women and children with contaminated
[02:36:40.010 --> 02:36:41.730]  hepatitis B vaccines
[02:36:41.730 --> 02:36:45.210]  giving them breast cancer causing XMRVs
[02:36:45.210 --> 02:36:49.770]  SARS-CoV-2 again, all of these viruses were made
[02:36:49.770 --> 02:36:54.330]  in 2004 and manufactured so their next move they played next week
[02:36:54.330 --> 02:36:57.650]  your last week your DOJ and your FBI
[02:36:57.650 --> 02:37:01.650]  oh we found this lab, a bioweapon lab and we blame China
[02:37:01.650 --> 02:37:04.650]  and it was in Northern California and Fresco California
[02:37:04.650 --> 02:37:09.050]  oh no maybe that was the freezers in the laboratory and the material
[02:37:09.050 --> 02:37:12.690]  that we show you in the last chapter of Plague of Corruption
[02:37:12.690 --> 02:37:15.690]  maybe there's a one last chapter I should show you
[02:37:15.690 --> 02:37:19.210]  because we saved all the samples, we have all the proof, we have all the
[02:37:19.210 --> 02:37:21.210]  freezers, we have all the hard drives
[02:37:21.210 --> 02:37:25.370]  Bobby and Trump both know where they are, where all the cells are
[02:37:25.370 --> 02:37:28.370]  where all the contaminants, we're catching rats
[02:37:28.370 --> 02:37:31.850]  they knew, they knew, read the last chapter
[02:37:31.850 --> 02:37:35.730]  read the last chapter, we have the cures, we have the cures
[02:37:35.730 --> 02:37:39.810]  they're all in those freezers too, so they're gonna try to scare you with
[02:37:39.810 --> 02:37:41.850]  Ebola or whatever else
[02:37:41.850 --> 02:37:46.090]  Ebola was made in the 1990s and injected
[02:37:46.290 --> 02:37:51.010]  by way of Obama and his little game to cover up 2014
[02:37:51.010 --> 02:37:54.050]  William Thompson's confession
[02:37:54.050 --> 02:37:57.730]  let's stop right there then, you're totally on target, let me just illustrate what you're
[02:37:57.730 --> 02:37:58.490]  talking about
[02:37:58.490 --> 02:38:03.490]  here is pubmed dot NCBI dot
[02:38:03.490 --> 02:38:06.570]  NIM dot NIH
[02:38:06.570 --> 02:38:10.130]  National Institutes of Health immunization safety review
[02:38:10.130 --> 02:38:13.690]  SV40 contamination of polio vaccine cancer
[02:38:14.010 --> 02:38:18.690]  now they admit that over 100 million people died of cancer
[02:38:18.690 --> 02:38:23.370]  by the time they put this report out in the 90s, so this is on their site
[02:38:23.370 --> 02:38:26.850]  now I have the main line reports in this epic times that link to the US
[02:38:26.850 --> 02:38:28.690]  government scientists
[02:38:28.690 --> 02:38:32.810]  and the studies that they found what you said three years ago would be in there
[02:38:32.810 --> 02:38:36.490]  the, because they already made it as you said in 2004
[02:38:36.490 --> 02:38:41.410]  the COVID shots with the SV40 that again causes cancer
[02:38:41.410 --> 02:38:45.010]  now look at Google, let me show them this, look at the evil Google
[02:38:45.010 --> 02:38:48.650]  if you type in monkey virus
[02:38:48.650 --> 02:38:52.850]  DNA COVID vaccines, it says there
[02:38:52.850 --> 02:38:56.170]  is no monkey virus, there is no RNA, no DNA
[02:38:56.170 --> 02:38:59.330]  it doesn't exist, even though I just showed you the government websites
[02:38:59.330 --> 02:39:02.450]  admitting it, so this is Google
[02:39:02.450 --> 02:39:07.250]  not just saying mask work when they don't, give you bacterial pneumonia, not just saying
[02:39:07.250 --> 02:39:10.850]  ivermectin doesn't work and get people killed, not just telling you the vaccine works
[02:39:10.850 --> 02:39:11.930]  when it's not a vaccine
[02:39:11.930 --> 02:39:16.330]  and it hurts you, but literally blocking this in live time they admit
[02:39:16.330 --> 02:39:19.730]  for the UN and for the WHO
[02:39:19.730 --> 02:39:22.730]  and this whole UN treaty, so I understand what you're saying
[02:39:22.730 --> 02:39:26.330]  you were the big whistleblower, you've done an incredible job
[02:39:26.330 --> 02:39:28.690]  my question here is doctor
[02:39:29.170 --> 02:39:34.010]  they tend to cover up one crime with a bigger crime
[02:39:34.010 --> 02:39:38.830]  and we now have RFK Jr. pointing out that there are hundreds of these labs in
[02:39:38.830 --> 02:39:40.350]  the US not just in China
[02:39:40.350 --> 02:39:43.970]  it was already a big controversy in 2015 when they moved it to China
[02:39:43.970 --> 02:39:47.210]  we've covered it but now RFK Jr. is reaching tens of millions
[02:39:47.210 --> 02:39:53.090]  saying it and laying it out so my issue here is with Rand Paul criminally
[02:39:53.090 --> 02:39:54.210]  referring Fauci
[02:39:54.850 --> 02:39:59.730]  these guys tend to double down you've already been falsely imprisoned and totally vindicated
[02:40:00.370 --> 02:40:03.570]  what do you gut level because you're a smart lady think they're going to pull
[02:40:03.570 --> 02:40:05.010]  now and how do we bring them to justice
[02:40:07.330 --> 02:40:11.250]  again SARS-CoV-2 is the other monkey virus
[02:40:11.250 --> 02:40:17.970]  SV40 means the 40th virus they isolated out of there in the 60s 70s
[02:40:17.970 --> 02:40:26.610]  the work is Adi Ghazdar and he was the one that showed in 2011
[02:40:26.610 --> 02:40:31.970]  these things went through the air from one flask to another contaminating
[02:40:31.970 --> 02:40:37.570]  uninfected cultures always they're trying to put you back in a mask
[02:40:37.570 --> 02:40:42.530]  the mask will drive the lung cancer from SV40 that's what it did that's this
[02:40:42.530 --> 02:40:47.330]  explosion in cancer they're going to try to tell you they're going to release something
[02:40:47.330 --> 02:40:53.090]  I'm telling you they've injected it into all of us unchecked since 1986
[02:40:53.090 --> 02:40:57.970]  and all we need to do to bring them to justice is never get another shot
[02:40:57.970 --> 02:41:02.050]  okay so let's slow down let's slow down how do these shots affect people differently
[02:41:02.050 --> 02:41:05.250]  let me ask you why would they inject roughly the studies are out of Sweden
[02:41:06.290 --> 02:41:11.570]  50% of people with saline 40% with a watered down small kill dose
[02:41:11.570 --> 02:41:15.090]  and 10 to 5% depending on the country with a strong kill dose
[02:41:15.650 --> 02:41:21.570]  they call that range finding I'm not a scientist a top expert like you but I do read the reports
[02:41:21.570 --> 02:41:25.970]  what is that about and it looks and we also know from studies they bombed
[02:41:25.970 --> 02:41:30.850]  conservative in rural areas more with the more deadly shots is that from your research true
[02:41:31.570 --> 02:41:37.890]  so cover that and then as you said why does it give some people myocarditis some blood clots
[02:41:37.890 --> 02:41:43.570]  some heart attacks some cancer because I guess it's a cocktail and depending on our physiology
[02:41:43.650 --> 02:41:48.050]  it hits us different ways so they cover up all the stuff they already polluted us with and flooded
[02:41:48.050 --> 02:41:51.890]  with a new even bigger system they sign governments on liability protection
[02:41:51.890 --> 02:41:55.170]  and then I guess get local governments and doctors to sign on with bioethicists to the
[02:41:55.170 --> 02:41:58.850]  crimes they're committing to fully corrupt the medical system to cover up the crimes
[02:41:58.850 --> 02:42:06.530]  they've already committed correct if you get a second shot a third shot you already have
[02:42:06.530 --> 02:42:12.770]  antibodies gert van den Bosch antibody dependent enhancement pathogenic priming
[02:42:12.770 --> 02:42:20.130]  when magic johnson tested positive in 1991 he had an antibody he was immune what didn't you do
[02:42:20.770 --> 02:42:28.450]  inject any other shot or you would activate the XMR I sorry the HIV there was a tooth
[02:42:29.650 --> 02:42:34.850]  paper it's shown on my slide that I always show at these various events and in these crimes
[02:42:34.850 --> 02:42:44.450]  against humanity standard vaccines increase the production of HIV MRNA standard vaccines
[02:42:44.450 --> 02:42:53.010]  2016 never get another shot and we can heal with our own god-given immune systems and clean
[02:42:53.010 --> 02:42:59.890]  out these things this is my focus oral immunization highly active anti-retroviral
[02:42:59.890 --> 02:43:06.450]  therapy our pills we give it away on the streets of san francisco thanks to the work
[02:43:06.450 --> 02:43:13.410]  of act up laws were passed people have forgotten we must remember those and let me
[02:43:13.410 --> 02:43:17.090]  raise that because you you were there a lot of listeners don't know the history of this
[02:43:17.090 --> 02:43:21.490]  they're smart but they don't remember or they never heard about it for those that don't know
[02:43:21.490 --> 02:43:26.050]  my dad is an oral surgeon smart guy heavily in the medical literature I remember him
[02:43:26.050 --> 02:43:33.010]  in the 80s saying son HIV is a manufactured situation it's the drugs that kill you
[02:43:33.570 --> 02:43:36.450]  uh the people that are dying from it already destroyed their immune systems with
[02:43:36.450 --> 02:43:40.450]  methamphetamines and stuff he was involved with doctors that were in the dallas virus club
[02:43:41.170 --> 02:43:45.090]  I mean he was actually involved in it helping people get the drugs they needed I'm trying to
[02:43:45.090 --> 02:43:49.810]  make my dad a hero he was he didn't let me say that and so he owned a hospital so all that
[02:43:49.810 --> 02:43:55.090]  was going on all that was happening so fauci's been defeated before that's why suddenly
[02:43:55.090 --> 02:44:00.130]  magic johnson and all and suddenly we don't hear about HIV so much because if they're not somebody
[02:44:00.130 --> 02:44:04.770]  they can target like the africans with quote HIV drugs they're unable to kill you give us the
[02:44:04.770 --> 02:44:09.650]  science and when you keep bringing up act up and the and the activists the good gay act is
[02:44:09.650 --> 02:44:13.570]  a great job going and exposing they were being murdered they figured it out explain
[02:44:15.170 --> 02:44:21.010]  yeah right there that last sign release peptide t read our last book ending plague or better
[02:44:21.010 --> 02:44:27.410]  yet listen to it frank rissetti talked for the first time ever it was published august 1st 2021
[02:44:27.410 --> 02:44:37.730]  and he showed you peptide t is a cure for hiv gp120 and lyme disease and myalgic and
[02:44:37.730 --> 02:44:41.730]  cephalomyelitis so magic johnson's worth a billion bucks he he gets the real treatment
[02:44:43.010 --> 02:44:47.570]  he gets that yeah there are hot lots that was your question yeah when you run a phase
[02:44:47.570 --> 02:44:54.130]  three clinical trial it's not an it it's a them they're not one manufacturing plant
[02:44:54.130 --> 02:45:00.530]  was ever checked well how dirty were there how contaminated every time you add that's it
[02:45:00.530 --> 02:45:07.730]  release peptide t 1980s in in the biological response modifiers program that i worked as a
[02:45:07.730 --> 02:45:15.730]  technician 25 years old until i got my phd in 1992 showing hiv didn't cause aids doesn't
[02:45:15.730 --> 02:45:21.650]  matter if these gain of functions don't inject them and don't ingest gmo and you'll live a
[02:45:21.650 --> 02:45:28.370]  really long time i got i'm immune to everything antibodies immunity stop folks you're fine no
[02:45:28.370 --> 02:45:33.410]  matter what they released last fall they already released it before the ebola that killed
[02:45:33.410 --> 02:45:40.930]  21 000 liberians came straight from the virile monkey cell line by way of bob oma and fauci
[02:45:40.930 --> 02:45:48.690]  to cover up william thompson's confession if we don't remember the people that were killed
[02:45:48.690 --> 02:45:56.770]  before if we don't remember if we don't stop all of this and peacefully no thank you no more
[02:45:56.770 --> 02:46:04.530]  shots sv40 is because you will cause lung cancer if you wear a mask not another mask ever
[02:46:04.530 --> 02:46:11.490]  again we will never tolerate this again i'm in an office where i have every one of these cures
[02:46:11.490 --> 02:46:17.090]  i have the oral highly active director viral therapy they give away and i have lots of it
[02:46:17.090 --> 02:46:23.250]  and i will give it and let's be clear you you said this in 90 and in 2004 you wrote a book
[02:46:23.250 --> 02:46:28.850]  you've been totally vindicated they instantly deep stated you because you were the an insider
[02:46:28.850 --> 02:46:33.730]  and it just blown their whole operation this is so incredible and so let me ask you this how
[02:46:33.730 --> 02:46:40.130]  is their program how is their program going and what do you think again of rfk jr what he's saying
[02:46:40.130 --> 02:46:47.810]  and the admitted labs and of the criminal referrals for fauci um he's robert f kennedy jr
[02:46:47.810 --> 02:46:55.010]  hasn't always been on site since 2019 when he wrote that for it's not a it's not a forward
[02:46:55.010 --> 02:46:59.810]  it's a chapter when he finally realized what i was saying that's the last chapter
[02:47:00.450 --> 02:47:05.090]  tell i he's bobby he said i called him and i said bobby you better hurry up get this out
[02:47:05.090 --> 02:47:09.090]  they're going to kill a lot of people and he's like judy there's something missing and i said
[02:47:09.090 --> 02:47:14.130]  i know you're busy bobby read the last chapter because the last chapter of plague
[02:47:14.130 --> 02:47:20.690]  of corruption when he drafted the forward was the way forward how do we cure it i'm always
[02:47:20.690 --> 02:47:27.010]  an optimist there was a way forward page all the way through that and you'll see the last chapter
[02:47:27.010 --> 02:47:30.290]  and we're going to talk about that we're going to talk about that but so let's talk about
[02:47:31.090 --> 02:47:35.250]  the number one question i get is we know it's shedding that's in the major studies a new
[02:47:35.250 --> 02:47:40.050]  one came out of colorado university two weeks ago we know the actuaries from insurance companies
[02:47:40.050 --> 02:47:45.170]  show 20 million dead not from coven from the shots what do people that have been shed on
[02:47:45.890 --> 02:47:50.450]  and people that have taken the shots what do they do to protect can they can they repair
[02:47:50.450 --> 02:47:55.970]  it can they reverse it what do we do absolutely i have like i said i have an office full
[02:47:55.970 --> 02:48:02.450]  um on and we created the website the real dr judy.com because i was i was one of those
[02:48:02.450 --> 02:48:07.090]  people in the dallas buyers club straight from the biological response model cards program
[02:48:07.090 --> 02:48:14.610]  i la i led the lab of antiviral drug mechanisms i know how the drugs work the healing is right
[02:48:14.610 --> 02:48:22.130]  there the courses are right there that pre-bundled solution cardiomerical proline greens and and is
[02:48:22.210 --> 02:48:29.330]  in pro-immune solutions right there all we need to do is nourish ourselves drink real clean water
[02:48:29.330 --> 02:48:38.130]  do not eat gmo they're all right there all we have to do is is learn what we learned in
[02:48:38.130 --> 02:48:45.650]  the 80s that's why the book ending plague is the highest censored um most censored book
[02:48:45.650 --> 02:48:52.370]  really of all times nobody even knew about it it didn't come out in audio to march of 2023
[02:48:52.370 --> 02:48:58.690]  it came out in 2021 bobby kennedy in the book the real anthony fauci described every
[02:48:58.690 --> 02:49:04.050]  one of those horrific experiments on children when the hot lots went to the inner cities
[02:49:04.050 --> 02:49:11.250]  in la we we know down explain what a hot lot is we we know from studies early on they bombed
[02:49:11.250 --> 02:49:16.610]  rural and conservative areas but notice no black activists talk about this that are controlled
[02:49:16.610 --> 02:49:21.330]  because they're so controlled but in particular they targeted blacks though in the 80s and
[02:49:21.330 --> 02:49:25.890]  90s now they've moved on to rural and conservative areas we know that explain what
[02:49:25.890 --> 02:49:31.970]  a hot lot is yeah stop it agency heads are scared to death of xmr he works out
[02:49:31.970 --> 02:49:38.530]  oh why because in 19 a hot lot means you sent to the inner cities in those countries exactly
[02:49:38.530 --> 02:49:43.810]  what you said the highest dose that you'd not you know the highest dose to and and you gave
[02:49:43.810 --> 02:49:49.890]  it to the poorest who were eating the glyphosate and the manufactured food and the it's not gmo is
[02:49:49.890 --> 02:49:55.810]  not real food the kids who are forced to in those head start programs before they're three
[02:49:55.810 --> 02:50:00.930]  years old oh we get a head start on killing you because uh little white children stay home
[02:50:00.930 --> 02:50:05.730]  with their mom and i'm not trying to be mean here because i stayed home with my mom until i was
[02:50:05.730 --> 02:50:11.410]  five years old and i thank god i didn't get shot before that um because it's not these parents
[02:50:11.410 --> 02:50:16.690]  faults they were lied to and the inner cities were where they sent the deadliest the highest
[02:50:16.690 --> 02:50:21.970]  doses they experimented and it's all in bobby kennedy's book the real anthony fauci and
[02:50:21.970 --> 02:50:29.410]  interestingly enough you won't even see the word you won't even see xmrv because robert
[02:50:29.410 --> 02:50:36.210]  malone and the editors of that book i had been so heavily censored they didn't even know and i
[02:50:36.210 --> 02:50:41.570]  believe them when they said it because i talked to them personally and that's you know the gift
[02:50:41.570 --> 02:50:47.650]  of mickey willis in plandemic 3 is talk have a conversation when we talk to each other
[02:50:47.650 --> 02:50:52.530]  we're like yeah we were lied to we have to forgive each other we have to forgive each other
[02:50:52.530 --> 02:50:56.690]  doctor i totally agree so here's the bottom line i think it's fair to say disagree because
[02:50:56.690 --> 02:51:00.610]  you're the expert the wheels have come off the globalist program they're in total fear
[02:51:00.610 --> 02:51:05.170]  fauci got caught with illegal federal protection forces even though he's supposedly
[02:51:05.170 --> 02:51:10.290]  retired i think they're on their heels how do we bring them fully to justice before they
[02:51:10.290 --> 02:51:15.970]  release a new bio weapon well it's all again they cannot release another one they've already
[02:51:15.970 --> 02:51:21.330]  been injected we've already been injected with all of it it's all a psy-op you just changed
[02:51:21.330 --> 02:51:27.170]  the pcr test to find the strain du jour the papers are all right there on our website showing
[02:51:27.170 --> 02:51:34.450]  they're all there how did we get mouse viruses into bat cave in china in bat feces in
[02:51:34.450 --> 02:51:40.530]  2011 shea xing li that's the paper the meta analysis is right there on our website we've
[02:51:40.530 --> 02:51:46.130]  educated you all we've shown you tens of hours of classes to show you this all you have to do
[02:51:46.130 --> 02:51:53.330]  is take away your money don't pay taxes don't buy go in a grocery store with a pharmacy
[02:51:53.330 --> 02:51:59.010]  they're poisoning you they're shedding on you the food is contaminated from the outside they're
[02:51:59.010 --> 02:52:05.090]  spraying the food they're injecting the animals eat clean eat in your community stay in your
[02:52:05.090 --> 02:52:10.290]  farmers markets here if you're anywhere near god speak church in thousand oats come see me i'll
[02:52:10.290 --> 02:52:14.290]  give you so what you're saying is and we say admit they are bombing the food they're bombing
[02:52:14.290 --> 02:52:18.850]  the water and that brings us to alpha gal we got to get you back again soon i have the fda and
[02:52:18.850 --> 02:52:23.170]  cdc website admitting that a whole bunch of the so-called vaccines have alpha gal they cause
[02:52:23.170 --> 02:52:26.850]  meat allergies they claim it's a tick but countries that don't have the tick are having
[02:52:26.850 --> 02:52:31.730]  alpha gal meat allergy explode and then we have the wf un saying we're going to put stuff
[02:52:31.730 --> 02:52:36.850]  in vaccines to make you allergic to meat in 2012 so that's an ongoing project give us your
[02:52:36.850 --> 02:52:45.090]  breakdown on alpha gal it well it's always there you know alpha it's it's a it's something
[02:52:45.090 --> 02:52:51.810]  we uh chemical we use in manufacturing detection and they're just like uh just like
[02:52:51.810 --> 02:52:57.010]  luciferase is you know alpha gal is just one of the things we use when we manufacture
[02:52:57.010 --> 02:53:02.290]  and we make these cell lines and we stabilize them it's always been in them because they never
[02:53:02.290 --> 02:53:09.970]  tested another they're not releasing it nothing under the sun is new not one single shot since
[02:53:09.970 --> 02:53:20.050]  1986 was tested or cleaned up or filtered they could have done this and in the summer of 2011
[02:53:20.050 --> 02:53:25.730]  when adi gosta approved yeah there you are we put them in all of it they're in all of read the
[02:53:25.730 --> 02:53:36.050]  2017 gotti paper and twinette gotti 2017 it's on our website look at all the garbage in all the
[02:53:36.050 --> 02:53:43.170]  shots they're just making it up now and saying covet 19 there's no such thing as covet 19
[02:53:43.170 --> 02:53:49.170]  it's chronic lyme disease it's all the cancers caused by not only simian virus 40 that was the
[02:53:49.170 --> 02:53:57.090]  40th how many new viruses have we created yeah look mrc file those came straight from our website
[02:53:57.090 --> 02:54:01.890]  and class is not that yours in your hands but look at the monkey kidney cell line look at the
[02:54:01.890 --> 02:54:07.490]  i'm showing fda cdc websites admitting that they're giving you meat allergy in the shot
[02:54:08.370 --> 02:54:16.530]  correct and they always have 2012 2011 that's the importance in our chapter in vaccine core
[02:54:16.530 --> 02:54:23.890]  and i'm going to start today releasing the cases we did and showing you they knew exactly how to
[02:54:23.890 --> 02:54:29.490]  cause what we're seeing now that they're calling covet they knew exactly the molecular mechanisms
[02:54:29.490 --> 02:54:33.890]  that's why when you were showing fauci drawn on the blackboard and f kappa b that was my
[02:54:33.890 --> 02:54:43.490]  phd thesis yeah 1991 we cured all of this and the answer was don't inject anything any mrna
[02:54:43.490 --> 02:54:47.490]  and by the way they admit that they gave all these different military quote shots
[02:54:47.490 --> 02:54:52.130]  were full of all the viruses and gulf war syndrome so this is depopulation it's them
[02:54:52.130 --> 02:55:02.530]  playing god there's no such thing as lyme disease it's hiv it's hiv gp120 the game was
[02:55:02.530 --> 02:55:07.810]  to kill them cover let me raise this i i worked off and on for four years for a large animal
[02:55:07.810 --> 02:55:15.410]  that who was very successful and i think still practicing and he would tell because he did large
[02:55:15.410 --> 02:55:19.410]  animal and small animal you know in two clinics he would tell people you don't need these shots
[02:55:19.410 --> 02:55:23.890]  and they knew that cats and dogs were dying and i've seen testimony of other veterinarians
[02:55:23.890 --> 02:55:29.650]  that it's also the animals and so now why are they injecting pigs and cows with the covet shot
[02:55:31.810 --> 02:55:35.810]  um to cover up all the things you just showed there on that thing so that
[02:55:35.810 --> 02:55:40.770]  so that our meat becomes contaminated because we're going to blame this all on global warming
[02:55:40.770 --> 02:55:45.970]  and it's really pollution and poisoning of our food supply and that is the goal that is
[02:55:45.970 --> 02:55:50.450]  absolutely the goal if you can't eat anything other than processed food and nobody should
[02:55:50.450 --> 02:55:56.610]  be in those stores don't go that's right the headlines everywhere uh washington post
[02:55:56.610 --> 02:56:01.730]  usa today global warming will soon poison the meat global warming will make viruses come out
[02:56:01.730 --> 02:56:06.290]  of the jungle no they're poisoning the meat and they're creating the viruses on record they just
[02:56:06.290 --> 02:56:10.530]  say oh and the countdown clock you're all dead within seven years because they're trying to
[02:56:10.530 --> 02:56:20.130]  trigger a catastrophe exactly and all you need to do is don't use present tense created they
[02:56:20.130 --> 02:56:28.210]  already injected it since 2004 and most of us are fine only the heaviest vaccinated are dying
[02:56:28.210 --> 02:56:36.850]  with those shots but berks and redfield used to jnj style gene therapy hiv vaccine on the
[02:56:36.850 --> 02:56:43.490]  military in the mid 90s and we have absolute proof oh in those freezers of mine they just
[02:56:43.490 --> 02:56:48.850]  happened to find some of those in northern california after they after they kidnapped me
[02:56:48.850 --> 02:56:53.010]  and held me and tried to get well let's elaborate on that and do five more minutes and then mike
[02:56:53.010 --> 02:56:57.090]  adams is loaded for bear taking over i know you've said on the show and written in your book

[02:57:02.850 --> 02:57:09.250]  you're part of that no i'm saying that the fbi made it up they knew about it when i was arrested
[02:57:09.250 --> 02:57:14.370]  in 2011 i got it so you told you told them that stuff was all there being saved
[02:57:14.370 --> 02:57:19.090]  and now they're raiding something they knew was there correct well they put it in a different

[03:00:27.570 --> 03:00:33.730]  minus six minutes dr judy minkovich author of plague of corruption is our guest uh
[03:00:35.010 --> 03:00:39.890]  elaborating this is big news making information you're exposing fauci his program
[03:00:39.890 --> 03:00:43.570]  it's all come out running into function and you're saying they just moved everything
[03:00:43.570 --> 03:00:47.890]  to a warehouse to make that a distraction to then blame it on the chinese elaborate on that
[03:00:47.890 --> 03:00:57.970]  that's turn her up okay start over go ahead who came after me the fbi and doj
[03:00:58.530 --> 03:01:05.570]  tony fauci doesn't do anything he just sends out his minions he paid off the owners of the
[03:01:05.570 --> 03:01:10.530]  institute who had committed oh little tax fraud some medicare fraud where they're sold an
[03:01:10.530 --> 03:01:18.290]  unvalidated pcr test you know who owns the patent tests the patent for the variants on all of covid
[03:01:18.290 --> 03:01:25.650]  me frank rissetti the national cancer institute not the niaid you know the game what
[03:01:25.650 --> 03:01:30.690]  is the game the game's been all about patents as we said in the beginning you can't patent
[03:01:30.690 --> 03:01:38.210]  nature hiv never was lav how many other than the 40 the hundreds the thousands of viruses
[03:01:38.210 --> 03:01:43.010]  that are in all these dirty cell lines we need to clean up all of these and our government is
[03:01:43.010 --> 03:01:48.210]  selling them and they're having debates who owns whose intellectual property is it
[03:01:48.930 --> 03:01:54.610]  whose intellectual property our cell lines where the tumor was transformed by the chimeric
[03:01:54.610 --> 03:01:58.850]  virus is it the maker of the chimeric virus well that's what we're all talking about
[03:01:58.850 --> 03:02:05.330]  who owns me now if i got injected by that stuff you know who owns whose property are you
[03:02:05.890 --> 03:02:12.770]  and that's what we're talking about people must wake up do not allow anybody near you with and
[03:02:12.770 --> 03:02:16.690]  that's like henrietta lax who they use her immortal cell line they say they own her
[03:02:17.970 --> 03:02:21.650]  well we're all right and they concluded all of this so what did we do
[03:02:21.650 --> 03:02:28.770]  i developed these cell lines who owns them who owns them i work for the federal government you
[03:02:28.770 --> 03:02:34.130]  do and you own the cures too because i developed the cures i didn't develop the cause the bio
[03:02:34.130 --> 03:02:38.930]  weapons were made by darpan barter barter under the capture manager of robert malone
[03:02:38.930 --> 03:02:43.570]  which that's what rfk jr just pointed out fauci runs the whole covert bio weapon program
[03:02:44.370 --> 03:02:50.130]  correct that's what sars-cov-2 means it's a monkey virus a kidney coming from the mid you
[03:02:50.130 --> 03:02:57.730]  know it's call it the 41st or the 42nd or the 4000 there are zillions of them in there
[03:02:57.730 --> 03:03:03.250]  don't inject them our god gave us the immune system we need and all those products you just
[03:03:03.250 --> 03:03:07.970]  showed and doc let me back you up here's a short clip of ran paul a few days ago bringing up the
[03:03:07.970 --> 03:03:11.250]  fauci and fauci said i don't have to tell you i want to ask you how much money you
[03:03:11.250 --> 03:03:19.490]  think he's actually been paid there's a club here's what i want to know it's not just about
[03:03:19.490 --> 03:03:24.130]  you everybody on the vaccine committee have any of them ever received money from the people
[03:03:24.130 --> 03:03:29.090]  who make vaccines can you tell me that can you tell me if anybody on the vaccine approval

[03:11:36.690 --> 03:11:42.210]  all right hello alex uh thank you for having me on i apologize for the delay technical issues
[03:11:42.210 --> 03:11:46.690]  but it's it's part of what's happening in our world right now i've been doing a deep dive
[03:11:46.690 --> 03:11:51.170]  for the last several months into a lot of the science behind the climate change fraud
[03:11:51.810 --> 03:11:56.770]  which i now am characterizing as a terraforming operation this is part of the evolution of
[03:11:56.770 --> 03:12:02.530]  genocide against humanity where governments have evolved more and more deadly weapons against the
[03:12:02.530 --> 03:12:09.410]  human race over the decades that they started out with weapons of kinetic death such as the
[03:12:09.410 --> 03:12:17.410]  holocaust rounding people up by gassing them to death with zyclone b they then migrated to
[03:12:18.050 --> 03:12:25.410]  food engineered famine death math mass starvation the holodomor for example that killed millions
[03:12:25.410 --> 03:12:32.050]  of ukrainians and was a weapon system then they've advanced now into geoengineering and
[03:12:32.050 --> 03:12:39.010]  weather control systems that cause droughts and floods and crop failures leading to famine
[03:12:39.650 --> 03:12:45.810]  and then now we have the most advanced weapon of genocide or democide of all and that weapon
[03:12:45.810 --> 03:12:53.170]  is terraforming and the terraforming operation is sucking co2 out of the atmosphere in order
[03:12:53.170 --> 03:12:58.370]  to shut down photosynthesis that drives the entire global crop yield
[03:12:59.570 --> 03:13:05.170]  operation without photosynthesis of course you don't have rainforests you don't have grasslands
[03:13:05.170 --> 03:13:11.490]  you don't have aquatic ecosystems ocean life plunges towards zero and you also don't have
[03:13:11.490 --> 03:13:16.450]  animals and insects and humans and then you don't have oxygen in the atmosphere because
[03:13:16.450 --> 03:13:22.530]  oxygen is created as a byproduct of photosynthesis so what we're really looking at right now alex
[03:13:22.530 --> 03:13:29.170]  is a terraforming operation now with a new announcement by joe biden that 1.2 billion
[03:13:29.170 --> 03:13:36.290]  dollars will be funding a new pilot project in texas and louisiana in order to again to pull
[03:13:36.290 --> 03:13:42.930]  co2 out of the atmosphere to sequester it and deprive the plants of planet earth access to the
[03:13:42.930 --> 03:13:48.530]  co2 that they need in order to function physiologically and to produce oxygen and food
[03:13:48.530 --> 03:13:56.130]  for the human race so this is the the the dark genesis of genocide against humanity is being
[03:13:56.130 --> 03:14:01.890]  able to pull co2 out of atmosphere in one place but to affect the entire atmospheric
[03:14:01.890 --> 03:14:08.450]  chemistry of the planet this way the globalists who are in let's say the united states or europe
[03:14:09.010 --> 03:14:18.130]  they can mass murder people in india or china or nigeria or syria anywhere on the planet
[03:14:18.290 --> 03:14:22.930]  they will all be impacted by this and the pilot program right now that's just been announced by
[03:14:22.930 --> 03:14:30.930]  biden is designed to be scaled up to a a mega operation multiple machines large scalability
[03:14:31.650 --> 03:14:38.369]  hundreds of billions of dollars behind this in order to drive earth's atmosphere into a state
[03:14:38.369 --> 03:14:46.610]  that will produce a cold dead lifeless planet a post-human future for planet earth that is what
[03:14:46.610 --> 03:14:52.369]  is being planned and deployed right now this is no longer a theory and it's certainly not
[03:14:52.369 --> 03:14:56.610]  a conspiracy theory it's a white house announcement it's a press release from the
[03:14:56.610 --> 03:15:04.050]  white house they are 100 behind this and unlike in other examples of democide or genocide
[03:15:04.050 --> 03:15:09.650]  against humanity where the people fought back you know some people resisted the holocaust
[03:15:10.290 --> 03:15:16.130]  some people fought back jews with firearms for example fought back and some people fought back
[03:15:16.130 --> 03:15:20.850]  against the starvation and tried to grow their own food this genocide that's being carried out
[03:15:20.850 --> 03:15:28.050]  on a global scale has recruited the people who have been brainwashed into believing
[03:15:28.850 --> 03:15:36.530]  in the climate change agenda these people have been brainwashed to go along with the death cult
[03:15:37.650 --> 03:15:44.770]  and so they demand their own deaths as part of this operation to quote save the planet
[03:15:45.490 --> 03:15:53.730]  it's all disguised as a planet saving operation when it is in fact a planet killing operation
[03:15:53.730 --> 03:15:58.530]  and a humanity killing operation but never before never in the history of genocide
[03:15:58.530 --> 03:16:02.930]  were the governments of the world able to recruit people to say hey line up and agree
[03:16:02.930 --> 03:16:10.210]  to be killed nobody did that until now now the climate change cultists they line up and they
[03:16:10.210 --> 03:16:16.930]  agree to take co2 out of the atmosphere that will kill them all so that's where we are right now
[03:16:17.970 --> 03:16:26.210]  in history now it's going to take some time for the globalists to achieve the co2 sequestration
[03:16:26.210 --> 03:16:30.930]  and alter the atmosphere to the point where it will shut down photosynthesis and kill most life
[03:16:30.930 --> 03:16:36.450]  as we know it on planet earth so they have other plans in the interim one of those plans as
[03:16:36.450 --> 03:16:40.290]  dr mike was just speaking about is of course the vaccine bioweapon
[03:16:40.500 --> 03:17:10.500]  and additional plandemics as micky willis talks about in his films so long term is to alter the atmosphere shut off sunlight block photosynthesis medium term is to deploy vaccine jabs depopulation jabs infertility jabs and also additional plandemics but short term how are they killing people now today
[03:17:10.500 --> 03:17:38.500]  Laha'aina many people believe was hit with directed energy weapons or DEWs or many people believe that maybe the fire started naturally and then the authorities were called off the fire department was called off they said oh it's under control and they left knowing that 70 mile an hour winds were approaching
[03:17:39.500 --> 03:17:49.500]  knowing that hundreds of children who were sent home from school would be home alone as their parents were still at work and that those children would be engulfed in the flames of death
[03:17:49.500 --> 03:18:02.500]  just like children thrown into the mouth of Molok child sacrifice operation hundreds of children burned alive many of those indigenous Hawaiian children
[03:18:03.400 --> 03:18:33.400]  they their ancestors were the Polynesians that originally settled Hawaii which was then of course annexed by the Empire of the United States to take the land the resources to pillage and then to control just as the US has been doing all over the world with many other countries to pillage and to control and if you don't go along with it well they destroy you they bomb you they kill you they destroy your infrastructure
[03:18:33.400 --> 03:19:02.670]  this is what the US did to Libya this is what the US did to Afghanistan and to some degree Syria this is what the US Empire again run by the the current Satanists in charge this is not the real spirit of America but this is who's in charge right now they've run around the world bullying and destroying everything in sight and now they've turned those weapons against the American people and recently against the people of Lahaina in Maui
[03:19:02.700 --> 03:19:13.700]  if they can do that to that town if they can burn those children alive and stand back and watch it happen they can do it to any of us
[03:19:13.700 --> 03:19:21.700]  now through the combination of geoengineering and direct energy weapons they can first create the conditions of mass fires
[03:19:21.700 --> 03:19:28.700]  you know Dane Wiginton speaks about this quite a bit and he's right they can control the flow of moisture in the atmosphere
[03:19:28.700 --> 03:19:36.700]  in order to have extra moisture in some areas to cause floods i.e. certain parts of China right now in order to deplete the food supply there
[03:19:36.700 --> 03:19:45.700]  and in other areas to deprive those areas of water to cause droughts to create fire conditions to create those conditions
[03:19:45.700 --> 03:19:50.700]  where everything is a tinderbox where there's no moisture left in the plants or the trees
[03:19:50.700 --> 03:19:56.700]  and then once those conditions are created they can use DEWs, direct energy weapons
[03:19:56.700 --> 03:20:05.700]  which there's no doubt in my mind that those are orbital platforms that can fire these direct energy weapons to set grass on fire
[03:20:05.700 --> 03:20:12.700]  to just all they need is a few sparks they can set fire in almost any location they want
[03:20:12.700 --> 03:20:17.700]  and then because they've created those conditions those fires can burn they can call off the fire department
[03:20:17.700 --> 03:20:23.700]  and get the cooperation of local law enforcement and local government to back down and back off and block the roads
[03:20:23.700 --> 03:20:27.700]  did you know they blocked the roads so that people could not evacuate Lahaina?
[03:20:27.700 --> 03:20:33.700]  you know people burned alive because the roads were blocked and children burned alive because they were sent home from school to be alone
[03:20:33.700 --> 03:20:42.700]  so this is an engineered operation as a demonstration and also i think a warning against any indigenous populations in Hawaii
[03:20:42.700 --> 03:20:49.700]  who might be thinking about you know perhaps reclaiming their nation or seceding from the United States occupying force
[03:20:49.700 --> 03:20:57.700]  because Hawaii is an occupied nation occupied by the US Empire and its military bases and its military presence
[03:20:57.700 --> 03:21:05.700]  and its fraudulent senators who claim to represent Hawaii but only represent death and destruction as we are now seeing
[03:21:05.700 --> 03:21:11.700]  so this tragedy as horrible as it is is also waking a lot of people up to the reality of what's happening
[03:21:11.700 --> 03:21:18.700]  a lot of native Hawaiians are waking up right now like never before and some of those people probably voted for Biden
[03:21:18.700 --> 03:21:23.700]  and are now realizing what a horrible mistake that is because you know Hawaii tends to vote Democrat
[03:21:23.700 --> 03:21:30.700]  but that's sadly in a horrifying way you often get the tyranny that you voted for
[03:21:30.700 --> 03:21:36.700]  and that's exactly what they are experiencing right now and i think many of them are realizing they have to put a stop to this
[03:21:36.700 --> 03:21:45.700]  they cannot tolerate this, they cannot tolerate the destruction of their land, their family, their towns, their communities, their cultures
[03:21:45.700 --> 03:21:51.700]  by this occupying force which has now engaged in war against we the people
[03:21:51.700 --> 03:22:01.700]  and as a backdrop to all of this of course you have elements of the Biden regime now filing additional criminal charges against Trump
[03:22:01.700 --> 03:22:10.700]  and you know many other people Sidney Powell and others Rudy Giuliani completely falsified charges
[03:22:10.700 --> 03:22:19.700]  the most ridiculous charges claiming it's a felony to tell people to tune into TV or that it's a felony to schedule a meeting room
[03:22:19.700 --> 03:22:26.700]  if they can level these felony charges against Trump and his team what can they do to you
[03:22:26.700 --> 03:22:32.700]  if they can burn the children alive in Lahaina what can they do to your town, to your state, to your country
[03:22:33.700 --> 03:23:03.700]  At the same time all of this is going on the Biden regime is asking for I believe it's 40 billion dollars to build cities in America in order to house illegal immigrants building them cities while the American people go homeless, while the American people face food scarcity, while the American people are taxed to death and their dollars losing value every single day because of the Federal Reserve money printing that has no end
[03:23:03.700 --> 03:23:26.700]  No end in sight, they have to print more money to send more weapons to Ukraine and more kickbacks to the weapons manufacturers while they build cities for the invading illegal force that is occupying this country there's no money to protect the border seemingly there's almost no money for the victims of the fires in Lahaina
[03:23:26.700 --> 03:23:42.700]  there's no money for veterans and VA hospitals there's no money for housing of the American people who have lost their homes because of the shenanigans of the central banks playing havoc with interest rates but there's money to build cities for illegal invaders
[03:23:42.700 --> 03:24:12.700]  I recently interviewed Michael Yon I know he's been on with Infowars here I'll be interviewing him I think on Friday as well and he has witnessed and photographed a city north of Houston Texas that is being constructed on private land to house tens of thousands of illegals once it is completed this is a private ghost city of sorts where Texans are not welcome Americans are not welcome
[03:24:12.700 --> 03:24:42.700]  only illegal aliens will be housed there and it will only be a staging area and FOB for those of you in the military forward operating base this is the beachhead for the invasion of the United States in Texas and at the same time New York City mayor Eric Adams is taking over children's soccer fields in order to build migrant camps in New York City and there's a petition
[03:24:42.700 --> 03:25:12.700]  among parents there who are complaining about that saying oh my gosh how could this mayor take away our children's soccer recreational activity to build migrant camps you want to know the honest answer because you voted for Democrats that's why because you voted for a Democrat mayor because you voted for Democrat legislature to run the state and you the American people the New Yorkers the local real New Yorkers third fourth generation
[03:25:12.700 --> 03:25:42.700]  New Yorkers you are considered expendable by Mayor Eric Adams and Kathy Hochul and others right the governor the mayor the legislators they consider you to be expendable you're being replaced they're building cities and camps for the illegals while you can't afford to pay rent why because again they're printing the money to build the camps and that causes a theft of the purchasing power of your dollars
[03:25:42.700 --> 03:26:12.700]  so you will go broke the migrants will get free housing and free health care and free education and free everything see what's happening this is no longer a theory Alex was warning about this more than a decade ago repeatedly and was called a conspiracy theorist oh there's no plan to replace the American people they said oh there's no plan for an invasion oh that would be crazy nothing like that is ever going to happen they're not going to build cities for illegals no the American people just
[03:26:12.700 --> 03:26:42.700]  you'll be fine you know sit down shut up be quiet and you know keep taking your vaccines and keep taking your psychiatric medications and you'll be fine and for far too long the American people slept or they were sleepwalking through life and they believed that oh yeah must be all the conspiracy theory none of this could possibly be true no one would be that evil no one want to get rid of Americans no one would allow the border to be invaded no one would actually use the powers of government to build weapons of mass destruction to carry out
[03:26:42.700 --> 03:27:12.700]  against our own children and burn them alive and it turns out that Alex was right it turns out that your government is a terrorist organization that your government wants you dead now I'm not calling for any violence or any uprising or anything of that kind I'm calling for an end of violence an end of government violence against the people and if there is a way to vote our way out of this
[03:27:12.700 --> 03:27:42.700]  should be option number one and we do have a vote coming up if we can make it that far if we can get there and even if Donald J. Trump is in prison because that's where they want to put him I think as of what just happened over the last 24 hours I think we the American people we need to come out in droves and we need to vote for Donald J. Trump simply as a way to push back against the lawlessness and the evil and Satanism that has infiltrated and taken over the government of this country
[03:27:42.700 --> 03:28:12.700]  which has been weaponized as a terror weapon against the American people Donald J. Trump after being thrown in prison might have the presence of mind I think he will to be able to take office and do what finally needs to be done what many of us hoped he had done in his first term and that is to use the executive power of the office of the presidency to gut the corruption the filth the Satanism the evil
[03:28:12.700 --> 03:28:42.700]  that has taken over the bureaucracy of the United States federal government this may be our absolute last chance and Trump can win the election even if he is behind bars by the way and we have a duty to help him do that because that may be the last remaining option to turn this around before it goes into the final totalitarian kill phase the kill phase has begun we have to stop it before it claims even more lives

[03:33:11.160 --> 03:33:17.560]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:33:17.560 --> 03:33:24.119]  All right, welcome back, folks, to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.119 --> 03:33:29.720]  Mike Adams stepping in here. It's been a while since I've been on the show and I'm happy to be
[03:33:29.720 --> 03:33:33.880]  back. I've been doing a deep dive into many areas and one of which I want to share with you.
[03:33:34.920 --> 03:33:40.679]  In my food science lab, we have acquired now dioxin testing equipment, which is another mass
[03:33:40.679 --> 03:33:49.400]  spec instrument with a dioxin gas chromatography or GC interface. And that's it took a lot longer
[03:33:49.400 --> 03:33:57.000]  than we thought. But after the so-called accident in East Palestine where they released dioxins onto
[03:33:57.000 --> 03:34:05.960]  the farmlands of Ohio and Pennsylvania and also the Amish farmlands there, we decided to go ahead
[03:34:05.960 --> 03:34:09.960]  and invest in that and we will be up and running in a couple of months to be able to
[03:34:09.960 --> 03:34:15.960]  conduct those tests. We've got some people including the resistance chicks who live in Ohio
[03:34:16.039 --> 03:34:21.720]  have provided us with some soil samples and we have connections with some of the farmers in
[03:34:21.720 --> 03:34:26.599]  that area and we're going to be conducting free testing for those farmers of their food
[03:34:27.160 --> 03:34:33.480]  in order to help those farmers if their food is clean so that they can certify that their food
[03:34:33.480 --> 03:34:38.599]  is clean and they can still sell their meat and their cheese and their milk or whatever
[03:34:38.599 --> 03:34:44.359]  they're selling from their animal farms there. And then for those who have a contamination
[03:34:44.359 --> 03:34:50.359]  issue we'll be able to help them pinpoint that so they can you know deal with it and resolve it.
[03:34:50.359 --> 03:34:55.240]  And I want to mention that in the last segment you know I talked about the government running
[03:34:55.240 --> 03:35:00.840]  terrorism operations against we the people of the United States and I believe that that train
[03:35:00.840 --> 03:35:07.160]  so-called accident in East Palestine was no accident as well. You look at the pattern
[03:35:08.119 --> 03:35:15.400]  of the sabotage of the food facilities. Look at the pattern of the fires and explosions affecting
[03:35:15.400 --> 03:35:20.840]  refineries and natural gas export hubs. You look at the pattern of what just happened in
[03:35:20.840 --> 03:35:28.920]  Lahaina. You look at even this so-called train derailment releasing dioxins which are extremely
[03:35:29.000 --> 03:35:35.640]  toxic at very very low concentrations I mean femtograms which is extremely
[03:35:36.679 --> 03:35:43.960]  tiny unit of mass by the way femtograms. Now that was designed to destroy more farming
[03:35:43.960 --> 03:35:48.920]  operations in the United States and to make the food supply even more scarce.
[03:35:50.119 --> 03:35:54.840]  So we are fighting back against that with this lab testing again we're going to be donating
[03:35:54.840 --> 03:35:58.199]  the lab test to the farmers there so that they can still sell their food without people
[03:35:58.199 --> 03:36:03.080]  questioning whether it's contaminated because a lot of farms even though they may be in close
[03:36:03.080 --> 03:36:08.840]  proximity to that so-called accident they were not downwind from it. So we'll be able to help
[03:36:08.840 --> 03:36:13.800]  them you know certify their foods as being dioxin free. At the same time we're also going to be
[03:36:13.800 --> 03:36:18.840]  able to spot dioxins that are in the food supply in grocery stores which I'm told it's
[03:36:18.840 --> 03:36:24.199]  going to be present at some level in many many animal derived products so we're going to start
[03:36:24.199 --> 03:36:30.039]  to create a baseline. Notice that the FDA did not conduct this testing nor did the EPA.
[03:36:31.480 --> 03:36:38.199]  The government agencies care nothing about your safety or your health. Literally they are trying
[03:36:38.199 --> 03:36:45.080]  to kill you that's what their goal is now they're trying to kill you and it's up to us
[03:36:45.080 --> 03:36:52.039]  we the people with our own media operations like this one infowars or with our own labs like my
[03:36:52.039 --> 03:36:56.920]  lab we're going to be doing the job the FDA should be doing and we're doing it you know at
[03:36:56.920 --> 03:37:01.720]  no charge to the farmers we're going to be telling the truth in a way that the government
[03:37:01.720 --> 03:37:10.199]  would never state because they have to cover up and lie about all of this. Now there's
[03:37:10.199 --> 03:37:15.400]  something else I want to share with you that also explains a little bit of my absence from
[03:37:15.400 --> 03:37:21.800]  this show and I did share this with my audience but I'm going to go ahead and share it with you
[03:37:21.800 --> 03:37:31.720]  now. Almost three months ago I nearly severed my finger I nearly lost my index finger
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:37.640]  this finger right here I hope it's in focus and you wouldn't you wouldn't be able to
[03:37:37.640 --> 03:37:43.880]  believe that by looking at it now but I showed the photos of it almost being cut off I severed
[03:37:44.599 --> 03:37:50.439]  ligaments I severed blood vessels and nerves temporarily lost nerve feeling in the fingertip
[03:37:51.800 --> 03:37:59.480]  course it was bleeding all over it was it was a horrible ranch accident okay and I did not
[03:37:59.480 --> 03:38:05.080]  sever the main ligament underneath here but I severed all the lateral ligaments and it was
[03:38:05.080 --> 03:38:11.640]  it was a mess and I was told by some people you know you're you're lucky you have your finger
[03:38:11.640 --> 03:38:17.560]  number one and and and by the way this will matter to you just just stay tuned in I'm going
[03:38:17.560 --> 03:38:22.519]  to tell you something really powerful here but a lot of people said there's no way you're like
[03:38:22.519 --> 03:38:25.560]  you're not going to get your your feeling back you're not going to get the the use of
[03:38:25.560 --> 03:38:29.640]  your finger back and they said oh you're never going to be able to you know fire a gun again
[03:38:30.599 --> 03:38:35.320]  I'm like no way that I can't deal with that I'm definitely going to be able to fire
[03:38:35.320 --> 03:38:40.119]  firearms whatever it takes I'm going to retrain this finger I'm going to regrow the nerves
[03:38:40.119 --> 03:38:44.199]  I'm going to do whatever it takes okay and I'm happy to say that as of right now
[03:38:45.160 --> 03:38:52.519]  over the weekend I think I I did like 300 rounds through a Glock 19 and it's all working just fine
[03:38:52.519 --> 03:38:54.599]  but how did I do that I want to share that with you
[03:38:54.800 --> 03:39:11.800]  One of the secrets that's been kept from us is that we can regenerate nerve tissue and we can regrow blood vessels and we can rebuild our bodies using natural medicine and molecules in nature.
[03:39:11.800 --> 03:39:17.800]  That information has been kept from us in exactly the same way that the truth about ivermectin was kept from us.
[03:39:18.800 --> 03:39:25.800]  The establishment wants you to die from a lack of ivermectin and so the FDA attacked it.
[03:39:25.800 --> 03:39:32.800]  Doctors refused to prescribe it and there are many other substances like that that can be life saving.
[03:39:32.800 --> 03:39:45.800]  And what I found after I nearly cut off this finger I found that and this is not something that I'm selling here and I'm not I'm not plugging a particular brand or anything I don't I don't think Infowars carries this and I don't either.
[03:39:45.800 --> 03:39:54.800]  But I found there's a medicinal mushroom that you can grow yourself called lion's mane lion's mane mushroom and lion's mane rebuilds nerve tissue.
[03:39:55.800 --> 03:40:08.800]  And with other nutraceuticals and good nutrition and vitamin C rebuilds tendons by the way did you know that and with zinc which helps rebuild skin injuries you know skin tissue.
[03:40:09.800 --> 03:40:14.800]  And with many other natural substances some of which boost immune function and so on.
[03:40:15.800 --> 03:40:27.800]  In a little over eight weeks I was able to rebuild the nerve tissue to where I not only got back normal sensitivity of my fingertip.
[03:40:27.800 --> 03:40:32.800]  I got back a hundred and fifty percent to two hundred percent sensitivity.
[03:40:33.800 --> 03:40:35.800]  I now have I mean this is going to sound strange.
[03:40:36.800 --> 03:40:43.800]  I have a fingertip that is like double double sensitive like I feel like I could read Braille at this point.
[03:40:44.800 --> 03:40:50.800]  Because it actually had to regrow the nerves that carry those sensations and those nerves are now brand new.
[03:40:51.800 --> 03:40:53.800]  And doctors say that you can't do that.
[03:40:54.800 --> 03:40:56.800]  You can't rebuild your nerves.
[03:40:57.800 --> 03:40:58.800]  You can't regrow the ligaments.
[03:40:59.800 --> 03:41:01.800]  You can't you can't regain that kind of function.
[03:41:02.800 --> 03:41:09.800]  Well folks I did it and I'm a speed cuber now and I'm doing Rubik's Cube all day and I'm doing you know Cube solves and all of this.
[03:41:10.800 --> 03:41:12.800]  And I'm shooting Glocks and rifles and everything.
[03:41:13.800 --> 03:41:22.800]  So I came back from the near loss of my finger and folks I never once went to a doctor at least not at first.
[03:41:23.800 --> 03:41:27.800]  I went later to check like five weeks in I went to check is everything looking good and that doctor was amazed.
[03:41:28.800 --> 03:41:29.800]  But I didn't go to an emergency room.
[03:41:30.800 --> 03:41:31.800]  I didn't get any stitches.
[03:41:32.800 --> 03:41:34.800]  Okay and now I can't say that that's right for you.
[03:41:35.800 --> 03:41:36.800]  You got to make your own decision or I'm not your doctor.
[03:41:37.800 --> 03:41:41.800]  But I decided to have no stitches, no x-rays, no emergency room, nothing.
[03:41:42.800 --> 03:41:46.800]  When I turned to natural medicine I was able to stop the bleeding because I know how to stop bleeding.
[03:41:47.800 --> 03:41:52.800]  That's not that difficult you know apply pressure and put on blood stop and you can stop the bleeding.
[03:41:53.800 --> 03:41:55.800]  But I decided I did not want to go get stitches.
[03:41:56.800 --> 03:41:57.800]  I did I do not trust the doctors.
[03:41:58.800 --> 03:42:01.800]  I don't want to go catch some horrible super bug at the emergency room.
[03:42:02.800 --> 03:42:03.800]  That was my decision again I can't say that's the right decision for you.
[03:42:04.800 --> 03:42:05.800]  You probably should go to the emergency room.
[03:42:06.800 --> 03:42:07.800]  But I decided not to.
[03:42:08.800 --> 03:42:11.800]  I decided to heal it with nutrition and medicinal herbs and mushrooms.
[03:42:12.800 --> 03:42:17.800]  And as a result here now almost 12 weeks later I almost have 100% recovery.
[03:42:18.800 --> 03:42:20.800]  Which mainstream doctors would say is impossible.
[03:42:21.800 --> 03:42:22.800]  Not impossible.
[03:42:28.800 --> 03:42:30.800]  And this this is the kind of stuff that I drink every day.
[03:42:31.800 --> 03:42:36.800]  Avocados and turmeric you know flax seeds and super foods and anthocyanins all kinds of stuff in here.
[03:42:37.800 --> 03:42:40.800]  This is what works folks.
[03:42:40.800 --> 03:42:43.800]  So you know I didn't say this to plug in for war store.
[03:42:44.800 --> 03:42:46.800]  And I'm not trying to plug in a particular product.
[03:42:47.800 --> 03:42:49.800]  But I'm just saying as a general principle I want you to know something.
[03:42:50.800 --> 03:42:52.800]  Nutrition absolutely works.
[03:42:53.800 --> 03:42:56.800]  Now I'm not saying that nutrition is a replacement for a real medical emergency.
[03:42:57.800 --> 03:43:01.800]  If you're bleeding out you know you should obviously seek medical assistance.
[03:43:02.800 --> 03:43:05.800]  But I'm talking about situations here when there is no doctor.
[03:43:05.800 --> 03:43:10.800]  When you're in a collapsed society which is probably coming because of the financial collapse.
[03:43:11.800 --> 03:43:15.800]  I'm talking about situations where you can't get to a doctor or you're way out in the country.
[03:43:16.800 --> 03:43:20.800]  Or you don't have a you know a functioning system power grids down or what have you.
[03:43:21.800 --> 03:43:22.800]  And then you have an emergency.
[03:43:23.800 --> 03:43:25.800]  There are things that you can do that work.
[03:43:26.800 --> 03:43:28.800]  And I just went through hell and back with this finger.
[03:43:29.800 --> 03:43:31.800]  I mean I couldn't type for three weeks I think.
[03:43:31.800 --> 03:43:36.800]  I couldn't even you know I mean imagine I couldn't unzip my fly folks.
[03:43:37.800 --> 03:43:39.800]  I mean you know you lose your finger it's tough.
[03:43:40.800 --> 03:43:44.800]  And I have a lot of compassion for people who have you know physical impairments and disabilities at this point.
[03:43:45.800 --> 03:43:47.800]  Because life was hard just not being able to use one finger.
[03:43:48.800 --> 03:43:52.800]  I can't imagine not having a hand or an arm or you know the combat veterans who've lost a leg.
[03:43:53.800 --> 03:43:55.800]  I really feel for them more than I ever did because I went through this.
[03:43:56.800 --> 03:43:58.800]  But I want you to know that you can heal.
[03:43:59.800 --> 03:44:00.800]  That your body can regrow nerves.
[03:44:01.800 --> 03:44:03.800]  Even blood vessels and tissues and muscles.
[03:44:04.800 --> 03:44:06.800]  Even in ways that doctors do not believe is possible.
[03:44:07.800 --> 03:44:08.800]  And I'm living proof of it.
[03:44:09.800 --> 03:44:10.800]  I'm living proof of it right here and I have the photos.
[03:44:11.800 --> 03:44:12.800]  I'm not going to publish them right here.
[03:44:13.800 --> 03:44:14.800]  I mean number one they're bloody and gross.
[03:44:15.800 --> 03:44:20.800]  But if you look at my finger right now you almost can't see any scar tissue at all.
[03:44:21.800 --> 03:44:22.800]  You almost can't see a scar.
[03:44:23.800 --> 03:44:24.800]  And it's unbelievable to people.
[03:44:25.800 --> 03:44:26.800]  So I just want to share that with you.
[03:44:27.800 --> 03:44:29.800]  That's one reason why I wasn't even writing stories for a while.
[03:44:29.800 --> 03:44:30.800]  I was focused on healing.
[03:44:31.800 --> 03:44:32.800]  I was focused on this injury recovery.
[03:44:33.800 --> 03:44:37.800]  I was focused on physical therapy to be able to shoot again.
[03:44:38.800 --> 03:44:39.800]  And now I'm back.
[03:44:40.800 --> 03:44:41.800]  Alright.
[03:44:42.800 --> 03:44:44.800]  That said let's move on to a couple other stories about the EPA.
[03:44:45.800 --> 03:44:51.800]  But thank you for your understanding and thank you for allowing me to share that kind of personal trial with you.
[03:44:52.800 --> 03:44:53.800]  That was difficult for me to go through.
[03:44:55.800 --> 03:44:56.800]  But God and Mother Nature.
[03:44:57.800 --> 03:44:58.800]  Oh yeah I prayed a lot too.
[03:44:59.800 --> 03:45:00.800]  God and Mother Nature provide the solutions.
[03:45:01.800 --> 03:45:02.800]  Alright here we go.
[03:45:03.800 --> 03:45:04.800]  Check out this headline.
[03:45:05.800 --> 03:45:06.800]  Guys you can probably bring it up there in the control room.
[03:45:07.800 --> 03:45:12.800]  Young environmental activists prevail in first of a kind climate change trial in Montana.
[03:45:13.800 --> 03:45:27.800]  And this story talks about a decision by a judge in Montana who has decided that the state of Montana is responsible for protecting the imaginary delusional climate fears of children.
[03:45:27.800 --> 03:45:29.800]  That's essentially what this case has decided.
[03:45:30.800 --> 03:45:40.800]  So because these children, the youngest of whom I believe was nine years old, because these children have been psychologically terrorized by the climate cult media.
[03:45:41.800 --> 03:45:44.800]  By the climate death cult establishment.
[03:45:45.800 --> 03:45:51.800]  Because these children wake up terrified that the planet is going to be destroyed if they don't stop combustion engines or something.
[03:45:51.800 --> 03:45:58.800]  This judge has ruled that the state has to halt the fears of these children.
[03:45:59.800 --> 03:46:06.800]  Absent any real evidence that carbon dioxide is any kind of a threat to the planet whatsoever.
[03:46:07.800 --> 03:46:08.800]  Or that fossil fuels are any kind of a threat.
[03:46:09.800 --> 03:46:17.800]  So now the question becomes, well what other childhood fears will the state be compelled to protect against?
[03:46:18.800 --> 03:46:21.800]  If a child is afraid of, you know, Chucky the doll.
[03:46:22.800 --> 03:46:30.800]  Oh my gosh, Chucky, the nightmare Chucky, I thought I saw Chucky in my room, under my bed, in my closet, eating waffles in the kitchen.
[03:46:31.800 --> 03:46:37.800]  Is the state going to be compelled to protect children from Chucky the doll delusions or other delusions?
[03:46:38.800 --> 03:46:43.800]  Some children might be afraid of fairies or mermaids or garden gnomes.
[03:46:43.800 --> 03:46:51.800]  Are states going to be compelled to deal with every delusional fear that has been propagandized and injected into the minds of these children?
[03:46:52.800 --> 03:46:53.800]  Because that's what this looks like right now.
[03:46:54.800 --> 03:47:08.800]  So we are now living in a nation where lawsuits are compelling governments to appease delusions of the masses who have been propagandized.
[03:47:09.800 --> 03:47:14.800]  Now this gets right into transgenderism because transgenderism is also a delusion.
[03:47:15.800 --> 03:47:18.800]  There's no such thing as transgenderism and can't become a woman.
[03:47:19.800 --> 03:47:26.800]  You know, despite what Neil deGrasse Tyson believes now as a quote scientist, that's, oh my gosh, how hilarious is that?
[03:47:27.800 --> 03:47:28.800]  A man can't become a woman.
[03:47:29.800 --> 03:47:36.800]  But if children think it's possible, then I suppose the state has to be compelled to somehow go along with the delusion.
[03:47:36.800 --> 03:47:37.800]  That's where we are in this nation.
[03:47:38.800 --> 03:47:43.800]  It's a very dangerous place to be because children are often, of course, irrational.
[03:47:44.800 --> 03:47:50.800]  They're not well informed at nine years old, nor 15, nor even, you know, 20 in most cases.
[03:47:51.800 --> 03:47:54.800]  There are a few exceptions, but most young people are not that well informed.
[03:47:55.800 --> 03:48:10.800]  And so they're easily subjected to propaganda to be brainwashed and swept into these movements, these delusions, these cult-like, you know, bandwagon operations, which is what climate change is.
[03:48:11.800 --> 03:48:12.800]  It's a complete hoax.
[03:48:13.800 --> 03:48:14.800]  There's not a shred of scientific truth to it.
[03:48:15.800 --> 03:48:23.800]  But this kind of lawsuit is going to be filed now in more states across the country and at the federal level as well.
[03:48:24.800 --> 03:48:39.800]  It's compelling the EPA to protect children from their delusional fears, which means that the national policies of the United States of America will now have to adhere to the delusions of teenage girls.
[03:48:40.800 --> 03:48:41.800]  I mean, think about that for a moment.
[03:48:42.800 --> 03:48:55.800]  If you've ever raised teenage girls or if you've ever known teenage girls or perhaps dated one in high school or whatever, or maybe some of you listening, maybe you are a teenage girl or a boy, it's not just about girls.
[03:48:56.800 --> 03:49:02.800]  But can you imagine national policy being set by the whims of teenagers?
[03:49:03.800 --> 03:49:04.800]  Because that's where we are.
[03:49:05.800 --> 03:49:15.800]  Now, there was a story in the Epoch Times, this has also been covered by David Icke here, two Princeton and MIT scientists say the EPA climate regulations are based on a hoax.
[03:49:16.800 --> 03:49:18.800]  And here it is from David Icke's website.
[03:49:19.800 --> 03:49:31.800]  And it talks about these prominent climate scientists that are saying that the EPA's new rules, quote, will be disastrous for the country for no scientifically justifiable reason.
[03:49:32.800 --> 03:49:43.800]  And they go on and say that the models are wildly exaggerated and that in truth there is no risk that fossil fuels and carbon dioxide will cause catastrophic warming and extreme weather.
[03:49:44.800 --> 03:49:46.800]  You see? That's the truth.
[03:49:47.800 --> 03:49:48.800]  And that's what I've been saying as well.
[03:49:49.800 --> 03:50:00.800]  And in fact, if you continue to read this story at the Epoch Times, it goes on where the scientists are saying that the rise in carbon dioxide from 280 parts per million to about 420 ppm, which is the current level,
[03:50:01.800 --> 03:50:06.800]  has resulted in a 20% increase in crop production globally.
[03:50:07.800 --> 03:50:09.800]  Increase, not a decrease.
[03:50:10.800 --> 03:50:20.800]  And that rise in carbon dioxide has resulted in the greening of the planet, which is something that NASA satellite photos have also proven to be true.
[03:50:21.800 --> 03:50:28.800]  As carbon dioxide has risen, and it's still very low historically compared to the history of the planet by the way, it was many times higher in the past.
[03:50:28.800 --> 03:50:30.800]  I mean, a hundred times higher.
[03:50:31.800 --> 03:50:32.800]  It's still very, very low.
[03:50:33.800 --> 03:50:44.800]  But as it rose from 280 to 420 ppm, which again is very minuscule, crop yields increased by 20% and the planet became more green.
[03:50:45.800 --> 03:50:50.800]  We also know from published scientific studies that rainforests have more flowers.
[03:50:51.800 --> 03:50:52.800]  More flowers means more pollinators.
[03:50:52.800 --> 03:51:02.800]  We also know that higher levels of CO2 can convert arid regions into farmable lands, where you could plant more crops and you could have more food production for the planet.
[03:51:03.800 --> 03:51:15.800]  And that many marginalized developing nations that are just barely getting by on the verge of mass starvation at any given moment, with higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, they could feed their populations.
[03:51:16.800 --> 03:51:17.800]  They could do well.
[03:51:18.800 --> 03:51:20.800]  They would not have to starve and suffer and die.
[03:51:20.800 --> 03:51:26.800]  So the truth is that higher levels of CO2 help set humanity free.
[03:51:27.800 --> 03:51:32.800]  Higher levels of CO2 create abundance for humanity, and they end human suffering.
[03:51:33.800 --> 03:51:36.800]  Higher levels of CO2 make populations more sustainable.
[03:51:37.800 --> 03:51:42.800]  And that is exactly why the Biden regime is at war with higher levels of CO2.
[03:51:43.800 --> 03:51:52.800]  They want to reduce CO2 down to almost nothing, because that would be disastrous for the planet, disastrous for humanity, disastrous for food production.
[03:51:53.800 --> 03:51:54.800]  You see what this is?
[03:51:55.800 --> 03:52:05.800]  So if we want to have a future, then we have to actually increase CO2 levels in the atmosphere rather than decreasing them.
[03:52:05.800 --> 03:52:14.800]  And the way to increase CO2 levels in the atmosphere is to drive a combustion engine vehicle, not an electric vehicle.
[03:52:15.800 --> 03:52:26.800]  Electric vehicles actually deprive the planet of the release of CO2 that would make it available to the plants that produce food and that produce flowers for pollinators.
[03:52:26.800 --> 03:52:27.800]  Understand?
[03:52:28.800 --> 03:52:42.800]  Driving a combustion engine vehicle as you need transportation anyway actually makes essentially fertilizer available for food crops all over the world and helps developing nations not starve to death.
[03:52:43.800 --> 03:52:45.800]  No one in the media will ever tell you that.
[03:52:46.800 --> 03:52:52.800]  They will say that driving a car or especially an SUV, oh, it's a horrible thing, horrible for the planet, oh, you're using fossil fuels.
[03:52:52.800 --> 03:53:02.800]  Yeah, we're releasing carbon to make it available to the food crops that feed marginalized populations in Africa and all over the world.
[03:53:03.800 --> 03:53:08.800]  By driving a combustion engine vehicle, you are actually helping to feed starving children.
[03:53:09.800 --> 03:53:10.800]  It's a scientific fact.
[03:53:11.800 --> 03:53:16.800]  It's absolutely true, once you understand carbon dioxide and photosynthesis.
[03:53:17.800 --> 03:53:23.800]  Of course, the Biden regime wants to block the sun as well, which is one of the three inputs required for photosynthesis.
[03:53:24.800 --> 03:53:27.800]  The three inputs are, of course, carbon dioxide, sunlight, and water.
[03:53:28.800 --> 03:53:30.800]  So carbon dioxide is being pulled out of the atmosphere.
[03:53:31.800 --> 03:53:40.800]  Sunlight is being blocked with the stratospheric aerosol injection and also basically polluting the skies, which is something that the White House is openly talking about now.
[03:53:40.800 --> 03:53:53.800]  It's a special kind of geoengineering operation to darken the sun, block sunlight from reaching the surface of the earth, which is where photosynthesis takes place because plants are on the surface of the earth and not floating in the skies, by the way.
[03:53:54.800 --> 03:54:00.800]  Hopefully that should be obvious, but I'm explaining that for the mainstream media journalists who are scientifically illiterate.
[03:54:01.800 --> 03:54:03.800]  So they don't even know how photosynthesis works.
[03:54:03.800 --> 03:54:12.800]  I mean, I learned that I think in the ninth grade in high school, photosynthesis, but today's New York Times science writers have no idea how photosynthesis works.
[03:54:13.800 --> 03:54:15.800]  But then again, they don't understand what money is either.
[03:54:16.800 --> 03:54:19.800]  They think dollars are money instead of fake fiat counterfeit currency, but there you go.
[03:54:20.800 --> 03:54:23.800]  We have really no education among the journalist class in America today.
[03:54:24.800 --> 03:54:29.800]  But if you block two out of the three of the inputs of photosynthesis, you're not going to get plants.
[03:54:30.800 --> 03:54:31.800]  You're not going to get food crops, folks.
[03:54:31.800 --> 03:54:37.800]  You're going to get mass global starvation and all by design, all by design.
[03:54:38.100 --> 03:54:47.100]  Now at the same time all of this is happening, you saw the story recently about China developing a new laser technology.
[03:54:47.100 --> 03:54:51.100]  And I've got a headline here for you from, I think this is a South China Morning Post.
[03:54:51.100 --> 03:54:56.100]  Chinese military scientists claim to have achieved a huge breakthrough in laser weapon technology.
[03:54:56.100 --> 03:55:00.100]  Now this relates to everything we're talking about.
[03:55:00.100 --> 03:55:09.100]  The difficulty with laser weapons is that they produce a tremendous amount of heat so they have to be cycled on and off in order to be used in battle.
[03:55:09.100 --> 03:55:22.100]  The advantage of lasers is that of course they fire mostly in a straight line because although light is affected by gravity it's not noticeable at battlefield ranges.
[03:55:22.100 --> 03:55:28.100]  And so you don't have to account for ballistic curves like you do with artillery and bullets and things like that.
[03:55:28.100 --> 03:55:31.100]  You basically just point at the target and you fire.
[03:55:31.100 --> 03:55:41.100]  Lasers require an enormous amount of energy in order to penetrate things like steel armor for example and thus they produce a tremendous amount of heat.
[03:55:41.100 --> 03:55:49.100]  Well China has figured out how to dump that heat so rapidly that the lasers that they produce now can fire on an ongoing basis.
[03:55:50.100 --> 03:55:52.100]  They never have to be cycled off.
[03:55:52.100 --> 03:56:03.100]  Which means that a laser, a military laser built by China can track the motion of let's say a target point on a US aircraft carrier at sea.
[03:56:03.100 --> 03:56:14.100]  The laser can just pinpoint an area like oh here this five inch diameter just like melt a hole through the hole of that ship.
[03:56:14.100 --> 03:56:21.100]  Right into the, I don't know, the ammo storage area or the nuclear power plant on board the aircraft carrier.
[03:56:21.100 --> 03:56:26.100]  They can just burn a hole through there because they can keep that laser going constantly.
[03:56:26.100 --> 03:56:28.100]  They never have to turn it off.
[03:56:28.100 --> 03:56:35.100]  This is such a game changer in war that it's going to make America's current military even more obsolete than it already is.
[03:56:35.100 --> 03:56:40.100]  And America is behind the curve in terms of not having hypersonic missiles like Russia has.
[03:56:40.100 --> 03:56:44.100]  And America's ICBMs are ancient compared to Russia's.
[03:56:44.100 --> 03:56:49.100]  Russia has hyper glide reentry vehicles for example on their ICBMs.
[03:56:49.100 --> 03:56:51.100]  America does not have that.
[03:56:51.100 --> 03:56:56.100]  So now with Russia having hypersonic missiles that can deliver nuclear weapons that America has no defense against.
[03:56:56.100 --> 03:57:03.100]  And then China building these military lasers that can burn holes in American ships once they're deployed.
[03:57:04.100 --> 03:57:10.100]  We are finding ourselves in a place where the United States military is obsolete on the world stage.
[03:57:10.100 --> 03:57:23.100]  And it's being run by a bunch of woke people that are trying to push transgenderism and culture wars in the military instead of building men who can fight and defend this country.
[03:57:23.100 --> 03:57:29.100]  So not only is our government at war with us, the American people, our government is now incapable of fighting a war against America's enemies.
[03:57:29.100 --> 03:57:31.100]  Think about that.
[03:57:31.100 --> 03:57:33.100]  That's all I have time for today.
[03:57:33.100 --> 03:57:38.100]  But I'll be back now that I've got my fingers back and functioning.
[03:57:38.100 --> 03:57:40.100]  And I'll be back here again in the future.

[03:58:46.100 --> 03:58:52.100]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[03:58:53.100 --> 03:59:02.100]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:59:02.100 --> 03:59:08.100]  And there are two things we need to do about it. We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:59:08.100 --> 03:59:16.100]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:59:16.100 --> 03:59:21.100]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[03:59:21.100 --> 03:59:33.100]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:59:33.100 --> 03:59:42.100]  Pure nascent iodine stabilized in an activated triiodine form for a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism.
