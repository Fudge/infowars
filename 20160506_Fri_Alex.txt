[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:10.000 --> 00:18.000]  Already the 6th day of May 2016, thank you for joining us on this live, original Friday global transmission.
[00:18.000 --> 00:21.000]  As we move towards Mother's Day this Sunday.
[00:21.000 --> 00:28.000]  Huge 2016 election news, big news on the front with Hillary and the emails and the FBI.
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.000]  Huge economic and military developments as well around the world.
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  It's all coming up today on this Friday edition and several very informative guests.
[00:38.000 --> 00:42.000]  But first, are you awake or are you asleep?
[00:44.000 --> 00:49.000]  I feel like this all the time trying to politically awaken people that they're being lied to, that there's an agenda.
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  It's not left or right, it's hey, there's mind control going on.
[00:53.000 --> 01:00.000]  The signals broadcast 24 hours a day, they're all this media just become aware of it and they'll say there's nothing going on.
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.000]  And I want to say put on these glasses or start chewing concrete.
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  They have recruited the rich and the powerful and they have blinded us to the truth.
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.000]  The question is, do we all work for central bankers? That's what I want to address to our guests tonight.
[01:25.000 --> 01:34.000]  Our impulses are being redirected. We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[01:34.000 --> 01:40.000]  An estimated 50 to 70 million Americans suffer from a sleep disorder or sleep deprivation.
[01:40.000 --> 01:50.000]  Outside the limit of our sight, the big office, pitched on top of us from bright to death, are our owners.
[01:50.000 --> 01:57.000]  Latest census numbers prove the United States has the biggest gap between rich and poor compared to all westernized countries today.
[01:57.000 --> 02:08.000]  Our projections show that by the year 2025, not only America, but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance.
[02:08.000 --> 02:16.000]  The gains have been substantial both for ourselves and for you, the human power elite.
[02:20.000 --> 02:31.000]  And for the first time in all of human history, mankind is politically awakened. That's a total new reality.
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.000]  I've got one that can see.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  We can't be the only ones who can see.
[02:37.000 --> 02:47.000]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's got them at the root of all our problems.
[02:47.000 --> 02:56.000]  It's a new morning in America. Fresh, vital. The old cynicism is gone. We have faith in our leaders.
[02:56.000 --> 03:07.000]  We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all. It really boils down to our ability to accept. We don't need pessimism.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  I have two words for you. Predator drones.
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  And who are you, little fella?
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.000]  We will never see it coming.
[03:19.000 --> 03:27.000]  And I'm predicting the first guy who uses a Second Amendment weapon to bring a drone down that's been hovering over his house is going to be a folk hero in this country.
[03:27.000 --> 03:35.000]  Guys, there is a single broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
[03:35.000 --> 03:43.000]  I'm just trying to warn you folks, the television is a giant LED weapon system. It's so advanced.
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  They got a monkey farm in Bastrop, folks. They do all sorts of testing on great apes, racist monkeys, the whole nine yards.
[03:49.000 --> 03:56.000]  And they go, oh, you didn't see this and punch a button into me. Hundreds of monkeys, wires in their brains with television sets brainwashing them.
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.000]  All I ever have to do is be famous. People watch me and they love me.
[04:03.000 --> 04:10.000]  You can have a little taste of that good life, too. Now, I know you want it. Hell, everybody does. Do it to your own kind.
[04:10.000 --> 04:16.000]  What's the threat? We all sell out every day. Might as well be on the winning team.
[04:16.000 --> 04:25.000]  The real men of the world have to stand up and say, I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  And I'm all out of bubblegum.
[04:28.000 --> 04:36.000]  Time to take a stand, boys. You know what? You got a little courage. Stand up for yourself.
[04:36.000 --> 04:45.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[04:45.000 --> 04:50.000]  The Oscar winners give a press conference and how to buy a sailboat as...
[04:50.000 --> 04:57.000]  Long live the Republic! Yes to the new world!
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  We'll be back. Stay with us.
[04:59.000 --> 05:07.000]  To launch Anti-Federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution fearing it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it,
[05:07.000 --> 05:13.000]  but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty. His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[05:13.000 --> 05:19.000]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you were to become a great and powerful people,
[05:19.000 --> 05:24.000]  but how your liberties can be secured. For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[05:24.000 --> 05:32.000]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  Today, everything the government does at every level is concealed from us.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[05:41.000 --> 05:47.000]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different.
[05:47.000 --> 05:53.000]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object. Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort.
[05:53.000 --> 05:56.000]  Well, we should be demanding liberty.
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  Renfowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[05:58.000 --> 06:05.000]  Uh, yeah, first of all, I want to say, secret 12-act two, supermale, brain, force, prostigar, silver bullet.
[06:05.000 --> 06:08.000]  I use them all. They're phenomenal. They work. Buy info.
[06:08.000 --> 06:09.000]  Thank you, brother.
[06:09.000 --> 06:11.000]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[06:11.000 --> 06:17.000]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[06:17.000 --> 06:19.000]  Welcome to the info war.
[06:19.000 --> 06:25.000]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the info war at the same time.
[06:25.000 --> 06:30.000]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, Nathan I-
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.000]  Right, God, let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  What products are you taking?
[06:36.000 --> 06:44.000]  Everything from supermale to brain force to winter sun, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[06:44.000 --> 06:48.000]  So when I just re-upped everything and I just went to auto-fill.
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.000]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[06:53.000 --> 07:00.000]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[07:04.000 --> 07:12.000]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[07:12.000 --> 07:20.000]  Many years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.000]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water, the aligning of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[07:34.000 --> 07:49.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[07:52.000 --> 08:08.000]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[08:08.000 --> 08:13.000]  It's 1159 at Radio Free America and this is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth Until Dawn.
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.000]  Right now, I got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[08:17.000 --> 08:21.000]  The chair is against the wall. The chair is against the wall.
[08:21.000 --> 08:25.000]  John has a long mustache. John has a long mustache.
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  It's 12 o'clock American, another day closer to victory.
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.000]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.000]  But they took a lot of people away. People that they thought were going to make trouble for them.
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  People that had guns and things they wanted, they just took them away.
[08:45.000 --> 08:46.000]  Where?
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents
[08:54.000 --> 08:57.000]  or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.000]  And we need the type of camps that you all run. I mean, really.
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[09:12.000 --> 09:17.000]  Now they were taken to race tracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[09:17.000 --> 09:21.000]  I'm a sorry citizen. I refuse to recognize you guys.
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening?
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitution lists and a lot of people that start power weapons.
[09:28.000 --> 09:34.000]  Plus, you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[09:38.000 --> 09:42.000]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  and they're disloyal to the United States. It's our right and our obligation
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  to segregate them from the normal community.
[09:51.000 --> 09:58.000]  It's what we're doing here and let's not kid about it.
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[10:03.000 --> 10:06.000]  Put your gun down, really?
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.000]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[10:26.000 --> 10:33.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[10:33.000 --> 10:38.000]  It's Friday, the 6th of May, 2016, on your host Alex Jones.
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  We're going to be here for the next four hours today, broadcasting worldwide.
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.000]  Roger Stone normally only comes on once a week.
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.000]  Again, the Trump confidant, former head of his campaign,
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.000]  he's in New York right now with Trump.
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.000]  He says that he is again going to drop gigantic bombshells
[10:57.000 --> 11:04.000]  when he comes on at the middle of the third hour, two and a half hours from now.
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  We also have a medical doctor who's testified to the U.S. Senate and others
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  who is an expert on vaccines, highly recommended by Billy Corgan
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  to come on, it's his personal doctor, but she's also very well known,
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.000]  to come on and discuss what they're covering up about vaccines
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  and what's in the mainline medical literature
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.000]  and how they have the secretive federal vaccine damage fund.
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  So she's going to be joining us for about 30, 40 minutes.
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  Part of the second hour today will also have open phones
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  throughout this Friday broadcast to cover all the different things
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  that are happening in the world.
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  And David Knight will host the fourth hour today.
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.000]  And then, of course, I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  with that transmission, even though it's Mother's Day,
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  I'm intending to come in and do the broadcast live,
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.000]  where I'm thinking about coming in Saturday and taping it.
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  I got to talk to my mom. She's coming over to the house and stuff.
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  We're going to see what happens.
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  But this Sunday, an original transmission, regardless, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  Then, of course, there's M4's Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central weeknights.
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  Wow. We're to start here.
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  We've got Hillary and big developments on the e-mail front
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  and NBC News caught basically covering up the story they've had that's bombshell.
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.000]  We have three of her confidants now being interviewed by the FBI.
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  So that cover-up is starting to unravel.
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  We're going to cover some of that.
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  She is the presumptive nominee now pulling ahead of Sanders in real elections.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  First, she stole a bunch of primaries from him.
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.000]  That was quite the education for a lot of people, where they just steal things openly.
[12:43.000 --> 12:50.000]  But since then, she has begun to get the lead in other primaries without having to steal it,
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.000]  because it creates the perception that she's a winner.
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.000]  But regardless, she is and has stolen what appears to be the Democratic nomination via theft.
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.000]  Donald Trump and the Patriot Movement, the Liberty Movement,
[13:02.000 --> 13:09.000]  overrode the globalist media, overrode the party officials and the disinformation armies.
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  And it appears they are not going to contest him.
[13:12.000 --> 13:20.000]  But Bill Crystal and Jeb Bush and George Bush,
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.000]  and all of them are in the news today saying never Trump.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  Here's the headline, Bush 41-43 won't be endorsing Trump.
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  If they endorse Trump, I would have a big problem with Donald Trump.
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  If John McCain, who says he's not going to the convention,
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  was endorsing him tacitly or with his nose held, something would be wrong.
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  Trump is coming into a criminal system with a bunch of out-of-control,
[13:47.000 --> 13:54.000]  larcenous hijackers that have taken over the country and taken over the Republican Party.
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  And he says, that's not how this is going to work anymore.
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  If we're not going to base this on lobbyists and on foreign countries buying us off,
[14:01.000 --> 14:06.000]  we are going to base it on America first.
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.000]  And that's why everybody from the ADL to the Southern Poverty Law Center,
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  to the Pope, to the Communist Chinese, to the Republican and Democratic establishment
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  are running around, well, you know what, in their britches,
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  because they know Trump is a nationalist.
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  And I know I've stated that a hundred times, but man, they really are scared of him.
[14:27.000 --> 14:36.000]  And for anybody that says that they could ever be bored right now, what planet are you living on?
[14:36.000 --> 14:41.000]  This election cycle is the most exciting, none of my lifetime, but clearly looking back over history,
[14:41.000 --> 14:46.000]  one of the most exciting in our history since George Washington.
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  Our first president, this is incredible what's happening.
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  It's epic and Trump and his success is only a manifestation.
[14:54.000 --> 15:01.000]  I'm not taking away from the man's courage or his tenacity or his, his wit, I totally admire him.
[15:01.000 --> 15:08.000]  But still, he would tell you, he is a focal point of what's happening historically right now
[15:08.000 --> 15:16.000]  and riding this incredible wave, a wave against globalism in Europe, in Eastern Europe,
[15:16.000 --> 15:22.000]  in Asia, in Eurasia, in Africa, in Latin America, in the Pacific Islands.
[15:22.000 --> 15:28.000]  All over the world, people are waking up to the fact that decades ago,
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  big multinational corporations came in and bought off their leaders, their presidents,
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.000]  their prime ministers, their parliamentarians.
[15:36.000 --> 15:42.000]  And that they had already transferred most of our sovereignty and our money and our laws
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  and our power offshore.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  To the point now, they look at us with straight faces and go,
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  you can't read the TPP, but it does make all your laws.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  You'll find out soon enough.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  You can't read Obamacare, you can see it after we pass it.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  You can't, we're not going to tell you the new party rules,
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.000]  but put it to you this way, even if he gets 1237, we're not going to give it to him.
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  Well, notice they're backing off that now because people are finally going,
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.000]  what, what some foreign secret group runs things in a,
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  the party says my vote doesn't count, but always said it did.
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  There's that big elephant in the room moment when people finally see it.
[16:21.000 --> 16:29.000]  You ever seen children or adults that matter when you're at a exhibit at a hotel
[16:29.000 --> 16:34.000]  or an exhibit at a museum and they'll have the big pictures on the wall that say,
[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  find the hidden image.
[16:36.000 --> 16:40.000]  One last week of the news saying, can you find the man standing in the grocery store aisle?
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.000]  I meant to show it on, on air, we probably do it now.
[16:43.000 --> 16:46.000]  But the headline was, can you see the man standing in the grocery store aisle
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.000]  and took me about a half a second to see him.
[16:50.000 --> 16:56.000]  But they put on a uniform that matched a photo they'd already taken
[16:56.000 --> 17:02.000]  so that he was basically wearing wallpaper that blended into the background
[17:02.000 --> 17:07.000]  so he was almost invisible until you just saw some of the surface contours
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  that weren't completely flat.
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  That's the same thing.
[17:11.000 --> 17:15.000]  When you can't see it, you can sit there with other ignorant people
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  and argue that maybe it doesn't exist.
[17:17.000 --> 17:21.000]  There's not a man standing there against that wall.
[17:21.000 --> 17:26.000]  But as soon as you do see the hidden image, how could you not have seen it before?
[17:26.000 --> 17:30.000]  That's a good parallel or a good analogy of what we're dealing with here.
[17:30.000 --> 17:35.000]  So the reason the system is trying to come in and further dumb people down,
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  the reason the globalists are accelerating their takeover,
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  has everything to do with the fact that they stole civilization in the last 100 years
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  with the advent of mass media, sophisticated propaganda.
[17:46.000 --> 17:53.000]  There were a lot of great developments that humanity saw popularized.
[17:53.000 --> 17:58.000]  And so the population kind of thought the government and science had provided it,
[17:58.000 --> 18:01.000]  not that humanity had provided it through science and culture.
[18:01.000 --> 18:04.000]  And so there was kind of a moment by the end of World War II
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.000]  when people just capitulated to whatever media and government said like children
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  and decided what we're being told is completely kosher and completely trustworthy.
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  And the old ideas with the Renaissance not trusting big combines,
[18:17.000 --> 18:23.000]  not trusting centralized power, but trusting real diversity and local power,
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  those ideas got thrown out as old hat.
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.000]  But we're now rediscovering the common sense very, very quickly
[18:30.000 --> 18:36.000]  because it's like if you're in a Jim Jones cult and he tells you everything's fine
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  and you buy whatever he says because of the peer pressure,
[18:38.000 --> 18:41.000]  but finally he says drink the Kool-Aid and you're going to live forever,
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  but suddenly everybody starts dying and you haven't drunk yours yet.
[18:44.000 --> 18:49.000]  You're going to run into the bushes even if it means they're going to shoot you in the back.
[18:49.000 --> 18:54.000]  You're going to try to take control of your own life because you know drinking that cherry flavored Kool-Aid
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  laced with cyanide is going to kill you.
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  So you run, you run, you run.
[18:58.000 --> 19:03.000]  And we're reaching that point where people realize they don't have any hope
[19:03.000 --> 19:07.000]  but to admit the facts and take action and say no and run for the bushes.
[19:07.000 --> 19:12.000]  But we're in better shape than people in a Jim Jones cult.
[19:12.000 --> 19:15.000]  Oh, they've got armored vehicles and they're training troops for domestic takeover
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  and governments are trying to ban free speech.
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.000]  They're trying to bring authoritarianism in so we can't get away or can't change the system.
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  But it's too little, too late.
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  There's too many alternative media systems.
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  People already know the genies out of the bottle.
[19:28.000 --> 19:38.000]  There's too many books and videos and information laying around now that people value the genies out of the bottle.
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  And so globalism is in deep trouble.
[19:40.000 --> 19:46.000]  The problem is there's been about a 200 year project through British intelligence and others
[19:46.000 --> 19:53.000]  to take over the Christian church and to teach an end of the world philosophy so people lie down and don't fight corruption
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  because the end of the world is always around the corner.
[19:56.000 --> 20:17.000]  So why should you stand up and do anything?

[20:59.560 --> 21:03.240]  When fresh liquid whey is processed into a dry powder, the special proteins that make
[21:03.240 --> 21:05.200]  up the whey lose their original shapes.
[21:05.200 --> 21:08.080]  They fold in on themselves and lose their functional value.
[21:08.080 --> 21:12.800]  One world whey undergoes a technological enhancement that we believe restores these potent proteins
[21:12.800 --> 21:15.000]  back to their original shapes the body can use.
[21:15.000 --> 21:21.000]  I chose to try one world whey first before going to a doctor who would likely only prescribe
[21:21.000 --> 21:28.000]  drugs to my delight it worked after stabbing pain for years to have it completely gone
[21:28.000 --> 21:29.000]  as a miracle.
[21:29.000 --> 21:34.560]  I'd like to also stress that for me, it took several months of taking one world whey before
[21:34.560 --> 21:39.400]  I had improvement and then an entire year for my gut to feel 100% healed.
[21:39.400 --> 21:46.960]  So now I tell my friends, give your body time to make use of the healing power of one world
[21:46.960 --> 21:47.960]  whey.

[22:32.520 --> 22:37.080]  has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from
[22:37.080 --> 22:38.080]  these devices.

[22:58.160 --> 23:02.440]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[23:02.440 --> 23:07.200]  It's true, some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[23:07.200 --> 23:09.680]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[23:09.680 --> 23:14.320]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[23:14.320 --> 23:21.120]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals,

[23:53.560 --> 23:56.960]  Big Berkey water filters for the love of clean water.
[23:56.960 --> 24:08.640]  Yeah, I could see for miles and miles and miles and miles 25 years ago when I got politically
[24:08.640 --> 24:09.640]  involved.
[24:09.640 --> 24:13.120]  And that's what was so frustrating.
[24:13.120 --> 24:18.640]  They admitted the Federal Reserve was private, predominantly owned by foreign families.
[24:18.640 --> 24:23.160]  It was in the Federal Registry, it was in the Congressional Record.
[24:23.160 --> 24:28.840]  They were admitting a plan to establish a planetary corporate world government that would find
[24:28.840 --> 24:35.000]  independent nation states and individuals and companies that didn't comply with the
[24:35.000 --> 24:43.360]  bureaucracies and the regulations written by secretive global corporate tribunals that
[24:43.360 --> 24:51.320]  would then be handed down to the American Union, the Asian Pacific Union and the European
[24:51.320 --> 24:58.280]  Union and each of those unions would have sub-directorate unions under it, like the
[24:58.280 --> 25:05.000]  Middle Eastern Alliance, the African Union and other sub-districts.
[25:05.000 --> 25:10.600]  This is all official and we go and cover the UN documents and show the New York Times and
[25:10.600 --> 25:20.000]  show State Department memorandum 7277 and the public laws.
[25:20.000 --> 25:26.240]  But no, people would just say, that crazy Ron Paul, that crazy Alex Jones, that crazy
[25:26.240 --> 25:29.120]  Pat Buchanan, that crazy.
[25:29.120 --> 25:31.520]  But back then, we weren't the dominant media.
[25:31.520 --> 25:32.520]  They were.
[25:32.520 --> 25:37.480]  Now, this information is dominant, so they just come out and go, okay, it's real.
[25:37.480 --> 25:40.680]  What are you going to do about it?
[25:40.680 --> 25:42.080]  But the con game isn't working.
[25:42.080 --> 25:45.280]  Look at these three stories in front of me today, three of them.
[25:45.280 --> 25:54.760]  This is out of French news agency, AFP, Pope Francis tells EU to tear down migrant walls.
[25:54.760 --> 25:58.360]  You see, that's the inverse psychology.
[25:58.360 --> 26:02.840]  The founder of the European Union with the Rothschilds, Peter Sutherland, is the head
[26:02.840 --> 26:10.520]  of the quote, UN Migration Committee, just like Saudi Arabia and others head up the Human
[26:10.520 --> 26:11.520]  Rights Committee.
[26:11.520 --> 26:18.800]  It's all about a sick joke, like having Hitler over the Jewish organization or something.
[26:18.800 --> 26:24.560]  And he comes out and says, how dare you EU not open up more to create the illusion in
[26:24.560 --> 26:30.360]  the Overton window that from his perspective, Europe is bad and guilty for only taking in
[26:30.360 --> 26:38.200]  five million the last three years, conservatively, 80% of a military aged man without real passports,
[26:38.200 --> 26:42.440]  fake IDs, raping, robbing and killing with France and other countries saying they're
[26:42.440 --> 26:47.040]  on the verge of quote, total collapse in their highway systems.
[26:47.040 --> 26:52.280]  It's like a road warrior, just hordes of people just running around robbing, stealing, killing,
[26:52.280 --> 26:53.280]  raping.
[26:53.280 --> 26:56.200]  The police are told don't even follow a report, murders or skyrocketing.
[26:56.200 --> 27:06.000]  People are fleeing in mass and the Pope is giggling and laughing from South America.
[27:06.000 --> 27:07.000]  It's incredible.
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.320]  They're going to use the collapsing third world that they've engineered the collapse
[27:09.320 --> 27:14.480]  of with their own IMF World Bank policies on record to now weaponize these populations
[27:14.480 --> 27:19.720]  and bring what's left down to the West, just like the big money targets the middle class.
[27:19.720 --> 27:21.520]  They target anything independent.
[27:21.520 --> 27:22.520]  This is economic warfare.
[27:22.520 --> 27:26.360]  Now, let's go to the next article.
[27:26.360 --> 27:27.360]  Get ready for this.
[27:27.360 --> 27:30.360]  This is Fox News Associated Press and Sunday Express all reporting this.
[27:30.360 --> 27:35.120]  Here it is, EU border threat, Brussels.
[27:35.120 --> 27:37.840]  It's the unelected bureaucracy that runs the EU.
[27:37.840 --> 27:40.600]  They have a parliament, but it's advisory.
[27:40.600 --> 27:42.520]  The EU created itself.
[27:42.520 --> 27:46.160]  Most of the countries didn't vote to enter it, almost all of them didn't vote.
[27:46.160 --> 27:51.200]  Their ministers just signed them on to the EU 50 something years ago calling it the Treaty
[27:51.200 --> 27:54.920]  of Rome, a so-called steel deal.
[27:54.920 --> 27:58.080]  Then it was the European economic community, just a trade deal.
[27:58.080 --> 28:02.040]  And then in 2000, they said, you know what, it's a government.
[28:02.040 --> 28:05.280]  And now they say, criticizes will arrest you.
[28:05.280 --> 28:08.120]  Oh, by the way, the EU bureaucracy, guess what?
[28:08.120 --> 28:14.760]  They have exempted themselves from EU federal taxes and national.
[28:14.760 --> 28:15.760]  Look it up.
[28:15.760 --> 28:17.960]  People go, that's outrageous.
[28:17.960 --> 28:21.400]  Congress five years ago exempted itself from insider trading when members of Congress got
[28:21.400 --> 28:22.400]  caught doing it.
[28:22.400 --> 28:24.240]  That was the CBS headline.
[28:24.240 --> 28:26.760]  Congress exempts itself from insider trading.
[28:26.760 --> 28:28.800]  Let them eat cake.
[28:28.800 --> 28:38.960]  The new royalty, EU border threat, Brussels to fine countries, 250,000 pounds.
[28:38.960 --> 28:43.960]  That's about $280,000 for every, no, no, that's euros.
[28:43.960 --> 28:45.800]  Yeah, so I calculated that right.
[28:45.800 --> 28:49.800]  That's about $260,000, $270,000.
[28:49.800 --> 28:58.000]  EU border threat, Brussels to fine countries, 250,000 euros for every refugee refused entry.
[28:58.000 --> 29:00.600]  All military aged men, look at them in that photo.
[29:00.600 --> 29:03.520]  And they just show up and they say, I'm here for my welfare.
[29:03.520 --> 29:04.520]  I'm here for my house.
[29:04.520 --> 29:05.520]  I'm here for my woman.
[29:05.520 --> 29:07.600]  I'm here to rape and steal and do whatever I want.
[29:07.600 --> 29:13.880]  I come from the most dangerous third world hell pits on earth where will hobbyist rule
[29:13.880 --> 29:17.760]  and if your wife's caught without a hood over her head, she's killed and so are you.
[29:17.760 --> 29:20.680]  We're here to run your country.
[29:20.680 --> 29:29.520]  And the EU unelected bureaucracy, conchowed by Merkel, looks at everybody and says, listen,
[29:29.520 --> 29:34.560]  you are going to be fined unless you let in unlimited more numbers.
[29:34.560 --> 29:37.680]  And by the way, Germans and French and Swedes, have you protest?
[29:37.680 --> 29:42.360]  We're going to call you racist and have you arrested even if you're a presidential front
[29:42.360 --> 29:45.960]  runner contender in France.
[29:45.960 --> 29:48.440]  Now if that isn't tyranny, I don't know what is.
[29:48.440 --> 29:59.160]  Here on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:59.160 --> 30:03.760]  The Constitutional Convention 1787 was held strict secrecy and at the end of the preceding
[30:03.760 --> 30:07.640]  citizens gathered outside Independence Hall to learn what had been produced behind closed
[30:07.640 --> 30:08.640]  doors.
[30:08.640 --> 30:12.040]  While Benjamin Franklin was leaving the hall, a lady asked him, well, doctor, what have we
[30:12.040 --> 30:13.040]  got?
[30:13.040 --> 30:17.160]  A republic or a monarchy to which he responded, a republic if you can keep it.
[30:17.160 --> 30:21.000]  But today, not only have we lost a republic, but most people don't even know what a republic
[30:21.000 --> 30:22.000]  even is.
[30:22.000 --> 30:24.480]  For one thing, a republic is not a democracy.
[30:24.480 --> 30:27.920]  A republic operates under the rule of law, which protects individual liberties so that
[30:27.920 --> 30:30.640]  the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority.
[30:30.640 --> 30:34.680]  Under a republic, the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws regardless of political
[30:34.680 --> 30:36.000]  power or lack thereof.
[30:36.000 --> 30:39.680]  A democracy, on the other hand, only leads to mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims
[30:39.680 --> 30:40.680]  of the public.
[30:40.680 --> 30:44.440]  In a democracy, the individual or any groups of individuals composing the minority have
[30:44.440 --> 30:48.320]  no protection against the unlimited power of the majority, it is a case of majority
[30:48.320 --> 30:49.320]  over man.
[30:49.320 --> 30:52.760]  In other words, under democracy, two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner, but
[30:52.760 --> 30:56.160]  under a republic, the sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law.

[32:07.560 --> 32:10.840]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[32:10.840 --> 32:16.120]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[32:58.360 --> 33:08.360]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star.
[33:08.360 --> 33:34.360]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[33:34.360 --> 33:41.360]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:41.360 --> 34:02.600]  We came into the intro of this segment and I heard that epic music blasting out.
[34:02.600 --> 34:15.000]  And it just reminded me about how epic the real times are that we live in today.
[34:15.000 --> 34:21.760]  And to see the United States as an American band in a death struggle with this giant globalist
[34:21.760 --> 34:33.000]  Ataconda trying to squeeze the life out of us and to see humanity attempt to get out
[34:33.000 --> 34:44.880]  of its clutches because only a small percentage of us understand we're under attack and that's
[34:44.880 --> 34:50.400]  still giving us enough strength to be almost struggling the coils of the snake off of us
[34:50.400 --> 34:58.040]  and we're getting our hands now around its neck and its little slit eyes have a glimmer
[34:58.040 --> 35:09.280]  of fear in them as we begin to cut the oxygen off and tear its stinking head clean off.
[35:09.280 --> 35:15.320]  All right, I was sitting here during the break and I was asking myself, why am I in
[35:15.320 --> 35:23.640]  such a really nasty mood right now?
[35:23.640 --> 35:30.680]  And it's because I've kind of psychoanalyzed myself and it's because I feel like I don't
[35:30.680 --> 35:39.800]  have the energy or the focus or even the right words to describe how incredible a time we
[35:39.800 --> 35:41.600]  are all in.
[35:41.600 --> 35:50.560]  Just how incredible, how amazing, how over the top, how dangerous, how thought provoking,
[35:50.560 --> 35:56.280]  how thrilling a time it is to be alive with all of the developments that are going on.
[35:56.280 --> 36:01.160]  It is just crazy.
[36:01.160 --> 36:03.840]  And so I'm going to briefly, before I plunge into all this news and give the number out
[36:03.840 --> 36:11.520]  and take your calls, I'm going to briefly try to go through a summation here.
[36:11.520 --> 36:21.360]  Of why I'm frustrated, but in a very positive way.
[36:21.360 --> 36:28.520]  And then hopefully my personal experience from someone totally immersed in researching
[36:28.520 --> 36:32.320]  the globalist and who they are, what they stand for, what their goals are and how to
[36:32.320 --> 36:33.320]  stop them.
[36:33.320 --> 36:36.600]  But also who we are.
[36:36.600 --> 36:38.040]  We've forgotten who we are.
[36:38.040 --> 36:41.240]  That's the only reason the enemy could be getting away with what they're doing at this
[36:41.240 --> 36:44.000]  point.
[36:44.000 --> 36:45.000]  And it comes down to this.
[36:45.000 --> 36:52.960]  I'm a very frustrated person because I've not been able to properly telegraph to folks.
[36:52.960 --> 37:02.240]  Just how incredible this struggle is.
[37:02.240 --> 37:05.240]  And just how real it is.
[37:05.240 --> 37:12.240]  Now, I've done a better job than probably anybody else, quite frankly.
[37:12.240 --> 37:20.480]  But that's not saying much because this thing's snuck up on us and it's here now and it wants
[37:20.480 --> 37:25.920]  to kill every man, woman and child of us and is not going to make deals and is not going
[37:25.920 --> 37:28.480]  to play games.
[37:28.480 --> 37:32.320]  And most of the people you see on TV, most of the pundits, most of the analysts, most
[37:32.320 --> 37:44.360]  of the quarterbacks don't know what they're involved in and don't understand the overall
[37:44.360 --> 37:55.560]  continuum and compendium of exactly what field they're playing on.
[37:55.560 --> 38:03.160]  So let me just recap briefly because it's a crime for me to just have an entertaining
[38:03.160 --> 38:09.400]  show here for you and play clips and go over different short attention span, theater information
[38:09.400 --> 38:13.560]  and cover this little factoid and that little factoid.
[38:13.560 --> 38:16.360]  I can do that better than anybody else.
[38:16.360 --> 38:20.520]  I can fill every two minutes with a new topic and a new issue and put a nice little bow
[38:20.520 --> 38:23.920]  on it, teleprompter free like nobody else can.
[38:23.920 --> 38:36.720]  Quite frankly, I can't, but I refuse to do that because if you just look at all these
[38:36.720 --> 38:41.560]  separate pieces, you're not going to get the answer, but if you pull back and study the
[38:41.560 --> 38:45.800]  white papers written by the technocrats and the controllers, they're very, very clear
[38:45.800 --> 38:48.640]  about what they're doing.
[38:48.640 --> 38:55.440]  And it's a story.
[38:55.440 --> 38:56.920]  It's a blueprint.
[38:56.920 --> 39:01.480]  It's a plan that everybody needs to know, but this is what it comes down to.
[39:01.480 --> 39:05.160]  The globalists, as we've talked about, are eugenicists.
[39:05.160 --> 39:08.000]  They believe that they are taking control of human development and evolution.
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.600]  In their words, they're playing God.
[39:11.600 --> 39:16.600]  They're mad scientists and they have an excuse that they kill us and dumb us down for our
[39:16.600 --> 39:27.880]  own good because we're a big, giant, dangerous, out-of-control infestation on the earth likened
[39:27.880 --> 39:39.800]  to high-tech army ants in the Brazilian rainforest that can clear dozens and dozens and dozens
[39:39.800 --> 39:50.320]  of acres a day, eating every piece of foliage down to the bone before the New York Times
[39:50.320 --> 39:53.960]  writes an article saying that I don't know that plants don't have bones.
[39:53.960 --> 40:02.320]  It's a figurative statement down to the bark.
[40:02.320 --> 40:08.360]  And they're doing all this in an emergency procedure to try to take control of humanity
[40:08.360 --> 40:13.480]  and direct its development to reduce us down to a manageable 200 million people.
[40:13.480 --> 40:14.480]  That's the official U.N.
[40:14.480 --> 40:15.480]  program.
[40:15.480 --> 40:21.520]  In the summer saying, yeah, we know this, we've been to the U.N.'s website, we've heard
[40:21.520 --> 40:24.840]  Ted Turner, we've heard Prince Philip, we've all gone to college, we've all heard this,
[40:24.840 --> 40:25.840]  we know this.
[40:25.840 --> 40:27.120]  Tell us something we don't know.
[40:27.120 --> 40:36.160]  I'm just restating to you what their goal is.
[40:36.160 --> 40:41.840]  I mean, that's pretty darn important to understand that they've got a cosmology where they can
[40:41.840 --> 40:47.080]  absolutely target every man, woman, and child on earth and incrementally dumb us down and
[40:47.080 --> 40:53.760]  poison us and use cultural warfare systems on us to hamstring our species and to shut
[40:53.760 --> 41:06.320]  down our life force prime programming and then turn us inwardly as a civilization against
[41:06.320 --> 41:07.320]  each other.
[41:07.320 --> 41:10.960]  And first they set up the first world against the third world, but internally they set up
[41:10.960 --> 41:16.600]  the family against each other and the cultures against each other and at every level it's
[41:16.600 --> 41:25.000]  about siphoning off productivity to get everyone in a position where they're completely unnatural,
[41:25.000 --> 41:31.120]  completely disconnected from reality, completely confused, and fighting with each other so
[41:31.120 --> 41:37.880]  that there's not enough resources to go around to create a negative economy that begins to
[41:37.880 --> 41:41.240]  implode like a black hole.
[41:41.240 --> 41:46.200]  Well, number one, then you study the globalists, they're some of the most wicked, hateful,
[41:46.200 --> 41:51.280]  evil people who actually enjoy what they're doing and they're releasing the most dangerous
[41:51.280 --> 41:56.040]  technologies you could imagine that are killing the earth itself while they claim they're
[41:56.040 --> 42:01.000]  preparing to call humans in the name of saving the earth.
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.120]  But then when you study what they're actually doing, they block programs that would reduce
[42:06.120 --> 42:12.360]  population in areas that should be released and should be reduced because it's untenable.
[42:12.360 --> 42:24.320]  They will block clean industrial movements that would cause the 1.5 child model.
[42:24.320 --> 42:28.160]  And then you can say, well, that's just because they're not coordinating this properly, no,
[42:28.160 --> 42:33.560]  you read deeper into their actuaries like the Royal Commission and 59 and others and
[42:33.560 --> 42:35.000]  they admit that's their plan.
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.760]  And then you pull back from it and you realize, oh my God, it's a plan to kill humans and
[42:38.760 --> 42:44.040]  kill plant animals and kill the oceans and kill the atmosphere and whoever these people
[42:44.040 --> 42:49.960]  are, whatever they're doing, wherever they came from, whatever it is, it's anti-life
[42:49.960 --> 42:54.920]  on this planet and it's rewriting and taking everything over.
[42:54.920 --> 42:59.120]  So that's what it comes down to.
[42:59.120 --> 43:05.720]  And so I can't just sit here and cover the window dressing of things and make jokes
[43:05.720 --> 43:10.680]  about this commentator and jokes about that commentator and just make fun of the social
[43:10.680 --> 43:19.920]  justice warriors who are just a few stages brainwashed and brain damaged down the room
[43:19.920 --> 43:21.560]  as we are.
[43:21.560 --> 43:25.760]  And I can't make fun of the people that are in fantasy land and only care about movies
[43:25.760 --> 43:31.640]  and comic books and video games because those are a lot of intelligent people who subconsciously
[43:31.640 --> 43:36.000]  have just decided to punch out because they don't believe they can change anything and
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.520]  have just given up on life.
[43:38.520 --> 43:42.680]  And that's another fundamental truth is that when you're given enough food, even if it's
[43:42.680 --> 43:48.120]  tainted and enough water, even if it's tainted and you're not physically under attack at
[43:48.120 --> 43:53.480]  a level that's completely clear to you, a lot of people will just basically go into a
[43:53.480 --> 43:59.640]  morass and put up with it and shut off and basically decide that they don't have any
[43:59.640 --> 44:03.400]  power and they can't have any effect.
[44:03.400 --> 44:10.920]  The reason we're dying is the entertainment television unnatural culture.
[44:10.920 --> 44:12.560]  And people say, well, why are you on television?
[44:12.560 --> 44:18.080]  Well, I mean, why were they jacking into the matrix and sending Morpheus and Neo in if
[44:18.080 --> 44:19.320]  they were against the matrix?
[44:19.320 --> 44:21.120]  That's a stupid question.
[44:21.120 --> 44:26.200]  If I'm against someone who's fallen into the ocean in the North Atlantic and they're
[44:26.200 --> 44:36.240]  going to freeze up at about 45 seconds and drift to the bottom and I throw them in a
[44:36.240 --> 44:43.920]  rescue buoy so that they can grab on and be hauled up to the side of the ship.
[44:43.920 --> 44:47.120]  I'm not agreeing with the ocean.
[44:47.120 --> 44:53.160]  I'm injecting something into the ocean that the people can grab a hold of to hopefully
[44:53.160 --> 44:58.880]  collectively help us all drag ourselves out of this.
[44:58.880 --> 45:03.240]  But that's really where my frustration comes from and it's why I get upset because I get
[45:03.240 --> 45:04.240]  prepared.
[45:04.240 --> 45:05.240]  I look at all the news.
[45:05.240 --> 45:07.000]  I have more stuff than I could ever cover.
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.520]  It's all extremely interesting, extremely informative.
[45:10.520 --> 45:17.280]  Just three articles out of my stack are just over the top important.
[45:17.280 --> 45:21.200]  The Pope lecturing Europe on opening your borders when they've already opened their
[45:21.200 --> 45:27.120]  borders when he has 200-foot walls.
[45:27.120 --> 45:35.160]  The EU saying we're going to have a quarter million euro fine on countries, on taxpayers,
[45:35.160 --> 45:41.000]  for every refugee who's refused entry, even if they're a terrorist or a criminal.
[45:41.000 --> 45:42.400]  That's global government.
[45:42.400 --> 45:43.400]  That's in your face.
[45:43.400 --> 45:47.960]  EU to find countries, hundreds of millions of pounds who are refusing to take refugees.
[45:47.960 --> 45:50.080]  The Telegraph.
[45:50.080 --> 45:54.520]  And I've got over 200 other articles and video clips and things that are just as interesting
[45:54.520 --> 45:55.520]  and just as informative.
[45:55.520 --> 45:59.600]  And we'll cover a lot of it in the next three hours after this hour.
[45:59.600 --> 46:02.200]  It's just that it's not my opinion.
[46:02.200 --> 46:08.520]  They put hydrofluorosalic acid known as fluoride in the water to brain damage you.
[46:08.520 --> 46:10.560]  It's a fact it reduces fertility.
[46:10.560 --> 46:12.640]  It's a fact it reduces IQ.
[46:12.640 --> 46:16.920]  It's a fact it causes massive increases in cancer.
[46:16.920 --> 46:22.040]  But still, the yuppies and the academics sit around and laugh because if they go pull
[46:22.040 --> 46:25.720]  up the Harvard studies and the rest of it and admit it to themselves, then they might
[46:25.720 --> 46:27.800]  have to actually do something about it.
[46:27.800 --> 46:33.400]  Instead, they've made the decision to fool themselves like delusional cult members and
[46:33.400 --> 46:37.640]  sit here and make a joke and say, oh, that's that silly Texan.
[46:37.640 --> 46:40.520]  He doesn't talk with an affected Atlantic accent.
[46:40.520 --> 46:42.040]  We're not going to listen to him.
[46:42.040 --> 46:50.240]  We're pseudo-intellectuals like George Will saying the Republican Party is sovereign,
[46:50.240 --> 46:51.240]  close quote.
[46:51.240 --> 46:56.520]  We decide who's president, not the mere plurality of voters.
[46:56.520 --> 47:01.920]  He thinks that's powerful to declare himself the new royalty.
[47:01.920 --> 47:09.440]  That's intellectual after they've held out that our vote counts.
[47:09.440 --> 47:11.520]  That's all a con artist has is the confidence came.
[47:11.520 --> 47:18.920]  That's why they're called con men, confidence men, and that's all this is a giant facade
[47:18.920 --> 47:25.480]  and almost everyone working for the system isn't even aware of its full import.
[47:25.480 --> 47:31.440]  That's the sickest part of it.
[47:31.440 --> 47:35.720]  George Will says GOP must stop Trump even if he wins the nomination.
[47:35.720 --> 47:39.440]  And now they've got all these Republicans coming out and Paul Ryan coming out saying
[47:39.440 --> 47:46.200]  he supports Hillary over Donald Trump because it's all about the lobbyist.
[47:46.200 --> 47:47.440]  It's all about the foreign interest.
[47:47.440 --> 47:48.720]  It's all so sick.
[47:48.720 --> 47:53.280]  This is the blue-eyed darling that all these conservative hosts tell you is so conservative,
[47:53.280 --> 47:56.000]  the architect of amnesty.
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.640]  What a giant joke.
[47:58.640 --> 48:03.840]  And what does Paul Ryan and Hillary Clinton and George Will, the Communist Chinese and
[48:03.840 --> 48:09.200]  the Pope and the unelected commissars of the E, what do they all have in common?
[48:09.200 --> 48:11.240]  They all have disdain for the American people.
[48:11.240 --> 48:12.240]  And you know what?
[48:12.240 --> 48:15.480]  We were feared 60 years ago.
[48:15.480 --> 48:20.800]  Highest IQs, most inventions, most vicious in average in battle.
[48:20.800 --> 48:26.240]  Now we're the most unhealthy, the stupidest because we've been under 60 years of high
[48:26.240 --> 48:32.240]  tech globalist warfare in the culture, in the food, in the water, in everything we do,
[48:32.240 --> 48:36.520]  we have been taught not to work hard, we have been taught to be lazy, we have been taught
[48:36.520 --> 48:42.280]  to be stupid and we lay around wondering what the next movie is or the next rock concert
[48:42.280 --> 48:46.360]  or the next TV show because reality's so boring to us.
[48:46.360 --> 48:47.880]  You know why reality's so boring?
[48:47.880 --> 48:49.600]  Because you're not in reality.
[48:49.600 --> 48:55.480]  You believe what the nightly news says and you believe the stuff you watch on Netflix
[48:55.480 --> 49:01.960]  is real at a subconscious level when every study and every actuary and every common-sense
[49:01.960 --> 49:09.080]  realization shows that all you gotta do is go out in nature.
[49:09.080 --> 49:10.920]  All you do is gotta go out and exercise.
[49:10.920 --> 49:14.840]  All you gotta do is go out and sit on top of a mountain top or down in a creek bed and
[49:14.840 --> 49:21.640]  just open your heart up and say, God, I know you're there coming to my life right now.
[49:21.640 --> 49:27.160]  Not the fallen evil on this planet, but the God of the universe and you know what happens?
[49:27.160 --> 49:32.360]  You're free right then at that moment and you will become addicted to something that
[49:32.360 --> 49:38.600]  actually makes you healthy and strong and happy, except for one thing as the Bible says,
[49:38.600 --> 49:47.960]  the beginning of knowledge is the coming of sorrow or with great knowledge comes sorrow
[49:47.960 --> 49:50.600]  because then you're gonna know how things really work and you're gonna see all these
[49:50.600 --> 49:56.560]  zombies around you in their little self-affected la-la land delusions that they're in charge
[49:56.560 --> 50:00.920]  and they're powerful because they're cynical and they're weird and they kind of diss other
[50:00.920 --> 50:05.280]  people and they don't talk to their co-workers and they're all about themselves and all about
[50:05.280 --> 50:11.080]  their fake righteousness, whether it be leftist garbage or right-wing garbage, they are in
[50:11.080 --> 50:12.080]  a program.
[50:12.080 --> 50:19.640]  They are in a mentally ill, narcissistic, false paradigm loop because they've been completely
[50:19.640 --> 50:21.320]  overtaken by the system.
[50:21.320 --> 50:28.000]  Two big study out in the latest issue of environment and behavior finds that walking in the woods
[50:28.000 --> 50:36.480]  particularly massively causes brain activity to increase in areas of pleasure, enlightenment,
[50:36.480 --> 50:38.440]  satisfaction, you name it.
[50:38.440 --> 50:43.680]  You mean humans actually in their normal environment at a genetic level we resonate?
[50:43.680 --> 50:46.080]  That's right, the iPads, the TVs, all of it.
[50:46.080 --> 50:49.360]  This false culture is killing us.
[50:49.360 --> 50:57.440]  This artificiality is destroying us and it's being designed by design to take us down.
[34:38.220 --> 51:35.440]  the best for you and your family.
[51:35.440 --> 51:39.560]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey purified water.
[51:39.560 --> 51:45.480]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size for incredibly delicious
[51:45.480 --> 51:58.640]  water now and in an emergency, get to goberkey.com or call 877-886-3653, 877-886-3653, goberkey.com.
[51:58.640 --> 52:03.360]  Are you concerned about the power grid, about the new war on the power grid?
[52:03.360 --> 52:09.000]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear and the most valuable.
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.000]  Here's why.
[52:10.000 --> 52:14.560]  An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the power grid has just
[52:14.560 --> 52:15.560]  been written.
[52:15.560 --> 52:20.740]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies, but only for a limited
[52:20.740 --> 52:22.920]  time to GCN listeners.
[52:22.920 --> 52:27.720]  He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[52:27.720 --> 52:32.680]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book
[52:32.680 --> 52:33.680]  to you.
[52:33.680 --> 52:34.680]  Why do this?
[52:34.680 --> 52:38.200]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[52:38.200 --> 52:39.800]  The answer is simple.
[52:39.800 --> 52:43.840]  America's power grid is in grave danger and most Americans are clueless.
[52:43.840 --> 52:46.120]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes.
[52:46.120 --> 52:50.560]  And why the most common question this author gets is, do you fear for your life?

[52:56.960 --> 53:02.040]  Think body armor is just for commandos.
[53:02.040 --> 53:03.040]  Think again.
[53:03.040 --> 53:06.480]  In a co-op situation, you need to protect your entire family.
[53:06.480 --> 53:12.680]  Infidel Body Armor has created lightweight armor that repels AR-15 and AK-47 rounds and
[53:12.680 --> 53:14.560]  priced at around $500.

[53:57.840 --> 54:10.960]  We're being inducted into strange days into artificial systems and I pledged to do this
[54:10.960 --> 54:16.480]  years ago but I'm going to start and I'm going to encourage my crew to start every week having
[54:16.480 --> 54:23.320]  like an hour cooking show where we show where the food came from, we have a chef or somebody
[54:23.320 --> 54:29.280]  tear it apart, cook it, discuss what's in it and then sit around and eat the food and
[54:29.280 --> 54:35.240]  talk about being human around a fire, even if it's indoors with a fire pit and that activates
[54:35.240 --> 54:40.880]  all the archival, race memories, the studies are out, all the epigenetics, you've got to
[54:40.880 --> 54:41.880]  do that.
[54:41.880 --> 54:46.720]  Gardening, getting your hands in the mud, planting it, then tending it, pulling the insects off
[54:46.720 --> 54:51.640]  it by hand, then picking it, then slicing it, then cooking it.
[54:51.640 --> 54:56.640]  All of that releases the chemicals in your brain to make you healthy, to make you satisfied,
[54:56.640 --> 55:01.040]  to make you know how to make the right decisions, to make you centered.
[55:01.040 --> 55:04.560]  I'm going to start going out where I just sit in the woods at night for like an hour
[55:04.560 --> 55:12.320]  or two, cross legged around a fire with some low light HD cameras and literally just cook
[55:12.320 --> 55:19.680]  a chicken over it myself and just basically eat it with nothing else.
[55:19.680 --> 55:25.280]  Things like that because I'm telling you, when you do it, you get high and I've always
[55:25.280 --> 55:29.040]  known that since I was a kid, all I wanted to do was camp, camp, camp, can we camp, can
[55:29.040 --> 55:33.640]  we camp, can I camp in the backyard, can I go to my friend's house that's camping, can
[55:33.640 --> 55:37.080]  I camp and back then it wasn't in any state, I was like nine years old, we lived on the
[55:37.080 --> 55:40.520]  edge of Dallas but there was a rural area nearby on a big railroad track and a bunch
[55:40.520 --> 55:45.160]  of no man's land property and my dad went and talked to one of the farmers and would
[55:45.160 --> 55:47.760]  let us go over there and camp on their property.
[55:47.760 --> 55:50.280]  The cops didn't come over there and ask what are you doing camping when you're nine, ten
[55:50.280 --> 55:51.280]  years old.
[55:51.280 --> 55:55.120]  I mean, I used to sometimes go get dropped off in the woods at, you know, somebody's
[55:55.120 --> 55:59.480]  farm or ranch and get dropped off with our stuff and I was ten years old with our tents,
[55:59.480 --> 56:00.480]  our food and everything.
[56:00.480 --> 56:05.240]  We'd just go march off into the woods on a long weekend for three days and man, my brain
[56:05.240 --> 56:08.240]  would turn on, I would just have such understanding.
[56:08.240 --> 56:15.360]  I would be basically on the best drug of my life for those three days and then the car
[56:15.360 --> 56:19.960]  would pull up, we'd all pile in and get driven back into town.
[56:19.960 --> 56:23.240]  There's a reason they arrest parents all over the world that let their kids play in the
[56:23.240 --> 56:24.720]  backyard now.
[56:24.720 --> 56:27.760]  There's a reason they're going after the Amish, there's a reason they're going after
[56:27.760 --> 56:31.240]  local farms, there's a reason it's human activity.
[56:31.240 --> 56:34.240]  You want to defeat the globalist?
[56:34.240 --> 56:39.680]  Start turning the cell phones off, only use them as a tool, realize it's literally a radioactive
[56:39.680 --> 56:40.680]  weapon.
[56:40.680 --> 56:47.360]  It's sending off radioactive waves, cell phone waves or microwaves, it is hurting you, it
[56:47.360 --> 56:53.200]  is tracking you, it is built by slaves in the most horrible slave pits on earth with
[56:53.200 --> 56:58.080]  suicide nets and forced drugging and forced abortion in death pits with mobile execution
[56:58.080 --> 57:04.160]  vans waiting outside to harvest organs if you cause a revolt.
[57:04.160 --> 57:14.520]  There's a demonic weapon forged in a satanic furnace by the servants of a twisted Vulcan
[57:14.520 --> 57:17.040]  with Festus leering over the slaves.
[57:17.040 --> 57:23.040]  I'm going to talk about Festus on Gunsmoke if you're a new listener, look it up.
[57:23.040 --> 57:27.720]  And it's just all, you're in a fantastical science fiction movie, that's what I'm trying
[57:27.720 --> 57:28.720]  to tell you.
[57:28.720 --> 57:31.160]  And the enemy knows exactly what they're doing.
[57:31.160 --> 57:35.200]  They brag about it.
[57:35.200 --> 57:39.680]  You think I'm like Chris Matthews, that'd be a cute clip to play and him going, look
[57:39.680 --> 57:44.160]  at Melania Trump, look at that walk, she's so gorgeous, oh my gosh, look at that.
[57:44.160 --> 57:50.840]  Sure that's an entertaining clip to play yesterday, but I didn't play it because I could admire
[57:50.840 --> 57:54.680]  a good looking woman like anybody else, but I really admire women and children and men
[57:54.680 --> 57:55.680]  as well.
[57:55.680 --> 57:57.560]  I want them to live and be free.
[57:57.560 --> 58:02.320]  I love them so much, I want to break the matrix, but that's not loving them at all.
[58:02.320 --> 58:03.520]  We're all in this together.
[58:03.520 --> 58:08.000]  Why should we want to be slaves inducted into some type of high tech meat grinder?
[58:08.000 --> 58:09.640]  An incremental kill switch?
[58:09.640 --> 58:15.560]  Folks, I need your support, plus you need the items and the products we've got in FullWarsLife.com.

[59:51.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:21.320]  You're watching us on television, there's two things on screen that say a lot.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:26.040]  Infowars.com reports central bankers moving to ban cash.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:32.000]  That means moving to ban barter, moving to ban to underground normal human economies,
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.120]  moving to bring in systems where they can find, fee, and tax you for not following their
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:44.160]  political directives like they're moving in Europe, saying 250,000 euro fines for every
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:49.560]  invader immigrant from the Middle East brought in that a country refuses to take in.
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.680]  And then something here on screen if you're watching us on television, I'll describe it
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.280]  for radio listeners, also describes what's happening, an iPhone.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.880]  I was pointing out these are built in the worst conditions on earth.
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.280]  You say, why do you have one?
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.640]  Well, the others are built just as bad as well, that it's all horrible.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:11.520]  And I point out constantly that it is a device that can be used for good to expose the device.
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:17.280]  But it radiates you with cell phone radiation, microwave radiation, it tracks you, it games
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.000]  you, it gives data to the big corporations to create actuaries to rip you off.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.840]  That's all admitted.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.840]  But what about the symbol?
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:29.320]  The devil has a metaphysical rule that God laid down that he has to give warning.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:34.000]  There has to be a, you know, like on the drugs, they'll tell you they can kill you.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.280]  The different medications and they say that this medication can kill you though.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.720]  Look at the apple.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.600]  It has a bite out of it.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.680]  And what does that represent?
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:51.800]  The fall of humanity, from grace, when we have the knowledge of good, we have technologies
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:56.920]  of good, ideas of good, ideas of wholesomeness, ideas of straightforwardness, like I'll sell
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:00.800]  a high quality products that's the best I can develop with the best research ever.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.600]  And as I learn more, I upgrade them and make them even better.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:08.080]  And then I sell it at a very competitive low price because that's how I want to be treated.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.800]  Plus then people get that it is high quality, has a lower price.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:16.080]  It starts taking over the market and then I become very successful.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.720]  That's knowledge of good.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.720]  That's how I operate.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:25.080]  I'll be honest with you though, I am exceedingly wicked because I've been brought up and my
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.520]  many generations before me have been brought up since the fall.
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:32.040]  And believe me, there was one.
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.840]  And I have knowledge of evil.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.400]  It doesn't mean I like it, doesn't mean I execute it, doesn't mean I enjoy it.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:42.520]  But I can sit there and look at a problem and I have the knowledge of good comes up
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.440]  and I can make choices off that menu or the knowledge of evil comes up and then I have
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:50.520]  to look into evil and all the crimes and all the sins and all the, and I'm very good at
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.520]  it by the way.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:56.760]  If I wanted to be evil, I'm like Michael Jordan compared to a lot of these globalists.
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:57.760]  That's why I'm able to expose them.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:58.760]  I'm not bragging.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:07.320]  It's my sinful side is not executed but just ginormous, this huge story of all the ancestors,
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:12.320]  all the ancestral sin, which is biblical, but is genetic, all the compressed data in
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:18.400]  my genes, all of it, all the good, the bad and the ugly, they're all right there.
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:23.200]  And I see how it all works and how the scams all work and all I have the knowledge of evil.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:30.000]  So I'm falling, but a lot of people don't even know there's knowledge of good and evil.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.520]  They just think, what gets me ahead?
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.520]  What's fun?
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.680]  Like liars think it's cute and funny to constantly lie.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:43.920]  They think it's like a new technology they've developed and again, it's twisted logic.
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.600]  Steve Jobs said, I don't let my children have iPhones or iPads or anything or ever let them
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.600]  on the computer.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.600]  They said, why?
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.840]  And he said, because it brain damages them.
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:56.280]  And they said, why would he admit that?
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.520]  Because he metaphysically has to.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:02.360]  Hello, my name is Council Dracula.
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.280]  I live right up the hill there at the cat.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.160]  Yes, the castle.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.040]  Young lady, I would like to come by some night.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.040]  Not tonight.
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.040]  I'm busy.
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.040]  I have to go.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.040]  I have things to do.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.040]  But might I come by sometime?
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.040]  Well, sure.
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.040]  Come on in now.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.040]  Oh, sure.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.040]  Oh, thank you.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.040]  I can't stay long.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.040]  Would you like a glass of wine?
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.040]  No, no, no.
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.040]  I'm not a drinker.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.680]  Not of that vintage.
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:23.840]  But thank you for inviting me.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.040]  We're friends now.
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.040]  I'll be coming back.
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.040]  Right?
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.040]  You want me to come back?
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.800]  Yes, I told you, didn't I?
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:38.800]  Right on there, a symbol far more evil than an upside-down cross or a pentagram, the
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:43.960]  seal of Satan, the fall of man.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.480]  And there's another symbol.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.040]  He told it's the star of David.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.600]  No, it's not.
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:53.760]  It's the seal of Solomon, two triangles.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.000]  Why don't you look into what that symbol really means?
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.800]  A staunch anti-Federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution fearing it would
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.720]  become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.000]  it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.960]  His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:17.280]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you were to become
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:21.520]  a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.400]  For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.840]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:32.480]  when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:36.920]  Today, everything the government does at every level is concealed from us.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:40.640]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:41.640]  are allowed to see.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:45.400]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.280]  its youth, the language of America was different.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.120]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:56.120]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort, when we should be demanding liberty.
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.920]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:03.440]  You're investing in your health and supporting the Infowar when you visit InfowarsLife.com
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:07.960]  and purchase your supply of survival shield x2, nascent iodine, and all the great products
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.960]  at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:13.560]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists,
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:19.400]  and the answer is clear, iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still so much new information
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:22.480]  coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:27.880]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:31.400]  purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:35.320]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:38.240]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:42.400]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine,
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:46.800]  that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:51.120]  and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:58.920]  It is exclusive to InfowarsLife.com and the InfowarsLife family of incredible products.
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:03.160]  Clean pure drinking water, you can't survive without it, but where do you get it?

[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:39.000]  And I just mentioned in the last hour, I have incredible Donald Trump clips in incredible
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:45.200]  news about what the globalists are up to, huge earthquake reports, and Mount St. Helens
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.520]  basically becoming active again and having a bunch of earthquakes yesterday.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.240]  So many important things are going on, the world is changing, we're entering an amazing
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.240]  time right now.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.760]  There's huge awakenings happening, but also evil is coming out in the open.
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:02.960]  There's another article here that dovetails with this today.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:09.640]  New Holocaust study, medical errors, third leading cause of death in the U.S., and that's
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.960]  when they admit it's a medical error.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.160]  Now MD medicine is a wonderful thing, you've got a broken leg or a gunshot wound has been
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:22.360]  said, but the big medical combines, the overuse of antibiotics, so many of these other systems
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:30.320]  are causing giant problems, and more and more, like vaccine makers, they're being given economic
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:38.440]  immunity from the things that they're engaged in, not the doctors themselves, but the system.
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:41.840]  Why is it becoming one of the top causes of death in the country?
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:45.960]  Well, a lot of it is also the drugs and the procedures that are being authorized, and
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:51.080]  now more and more computers are making the decisions of what surgeries or what treatments
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:58.200]  are available, and nothing's being talked to people about what vitamin B12 can do.
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.720]  There was big studies out even in the New York Times a few weeks ago in live science
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:07.520]  about most depression, mental illness, schizophrenia, link to the gut, not being able to absorb
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.320]  vitamin B12, but see, big pharma doesn't want you to know why you're depressed because
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:15.000]  you're not out in the sun, you're not eating good food, your gut floor has been killed
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.560]  by all the pesticides in the food.
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.040]  They want to treat the illnesses.
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:27.600]  They don't want to take you back to the basics of why you're ill and try to stop it.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:32.120]  The Washington Post reports medical errors, now third leading cause of death in the United
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:37.920]  States, reports the new John Hopkins study, and then we break it down and show it's actually
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:41.120]  the number one cause in John Rappaport's article, rimfallwars.com.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:45.680]  Of course, I mentioned this, scientists explain why it's inevitable that America will be hit
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:49.240]  by absolutely monstrous earthquakes because we're overdue, everybody else has already
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.240]  had it.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:55.960]  So, we've got some of that news coming up today, but before I go any further, we will
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:01.360]  get about 45 into the shower, into the Trump news and the election news, into all the things
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:06.800]  that are unfolding on that front, 27 lawmakers warn Obama against transferring service to
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.120]  air missiles to Syrian rebels.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:14.360]  Now, that's in the Associated Press, that is in Breitbart, you name it.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.560]  I told you four years ago when Benghazi happened, when they transferred the service to air missiles,
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:24.040]  the M-pads, that when you started hearing the mainstream media warn about M-pads and
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:29.120]  say that they'd been transferred by Obama, which they'd been openly doing, get ready
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:32.280]  for the airlines to start getting shot down.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:37.960]  So, that's coming up as well here today.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:42.160]  We also have politically Paul Ryan coming out and saying he will not support Trump,
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.760]  he would support even Hillary, Paul Ryan, architect of open borders says he won't back
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:53.240]  Trump over Hillary, and all Trump is doing is pushing nationalism.
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:57.720]  That's why they're so scared of him because whether he's good or bad, he is somebody
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:02.560]  who they do know is an outsider from their system and the lobbyists are in an open panic
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:08.360]  and it shows how the two-party system at the top is so controlled that we're being lectured
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:12.880]  by these people and we're being lectured by the Communist Chinese dictatorship, we're
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:18.240]  being lectured by the Pope, the very same Pope that has praised quarter million pound
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:24.200]  or quarter million euro fines for every refugee refused entry into Europe.
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:29.160]  I mean this is global government, an unelected EU gets set up, it takes over your country
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:33.040]  without the nation's voting, France didn't vote, Germany didn't vote, England didn't
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:39.040]  vote, the UK didn't vote, it's making your laws, they bring in 5 million refugees, they're
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:43.280]  running around murdering and killing and raping out of war torn zones and then they say we're
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:48.520]  going to find you if you don't bring more in.
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:51.320]  That's the TPP that they ratified the secret and say we're now under and all the rest of
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:56.080]  it globally and Congress couldn't even see a copy of it and now we're told that makes
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:01.160]  our decisions and when the UK says we might leave the EU, Obama says hey you're under
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.600]  treaties with us, you're not allowed to.
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:07.360]  See we're already in global government and there are other little agreements.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:13.000]  In the 1980s billions of dollars was put in a secretive fund with a secret court.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:20.040]  The Vaccine Damage Fund, you see other drugs supposedly can be sued, if Fin Fin makes you
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:26.200]  have heart valve disintegration, well you can then sue them but see not the vaccine makers
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.640]  and back when they did that there were 15 or 20 they were trying to push, now it's hundreds
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:36.240]  they want to push on the people of the planet and they're given a secret court and then
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.520]  taxpayer money secretly pays out all the dead and dying.
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:45.520]  The inserts though still admit that they can kill you or cause neurological disorders
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:50.760]  or problems and now this year they've got bills introduced to the Congress to even get
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:55.960]  rid of the inserts with vaccines you see just like they don't want labeling on GMO.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:59.960]  Now the lady we've got on with us till about 45 after and I really appreciate her coming
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:09.960]  on is Dr. Tony Bark and I really appreciate her coming on disease-reversal.com is her
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:15.840]  website she is a prestigious medical doctor testified before Congress the Senate and I'd
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.960]  already knew who she was read some of her articles over the years but I was glad we
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:23.880]  were able to get in contact with her because she's also the medical doctor for the founder
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:27.240]  of Spanish and Pumpkins and a big listener of the show and a great great mind when it
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:31.320]  comes to deciphering what's happening of course Billy Corgan who was here with us in studio
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.960]  a few weeks ago and she received her medical doctorate from Rush University in 1986 studying
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:41.120]  psychology University of Illinois and University of London she immediately took the position
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:47.440]  of director of pediatric emergency room at Michelle Reese Hospital in Chicago so boys
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.400]  she's seen it all after two years she began her studies in alternative medicine practices
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:55.960]  such as nutrition and classical homeopathy all while keeping her hands in emergency
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:01.960]  and urgent care medical work as well as starting her private practice in 1993 2010 Dr. Bark
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:05.960]  also began a master's program in healthcare emergency medicine at Boston University where
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:11.880]  she focused on vaccine safety efficacy and ethics issues she worked as an adjunct professor
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:18.200]  at the Boston graduate program teaching and the effects of disaster on psychology Dr.
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:23.840]  Bark also co-produced the documentary bought the feature in the documentary silent epidemic
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:29.480]  vaccine wars and food choices she is an alternative and active in legislative issues and has given
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:36.920]  testimony for senate health committee disease-reversal.com and Dr. Bark thank you so much for coming
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:41.520]  on with us you heard me kind of set the table there for folks that just tuned in some of
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:46.280]  the news we're going to break in five minutes but first off thank you for coming on with
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:52.920]  us but but but what is front and center for you today with all the changes that are happening
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:59.440]  well I do see the tide turning somewhat yesterday I was an expert witness in a midwestern state
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:04.400]  in family court this is something that I've done many times this is on regarding vaccine
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:10.800]  custody issues I've done it in Australia as well I've worked on cases in in Canada and I have a
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:17.040]  case in the vaccine court itself right now as well but I do feel that the tide is turning I mean
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:23.600]  the judge yesterday was fascinated with hearing what I had to say about the lack of vaccine safety
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:32.400]  about the court and the opposing physician was unaware of the vaccine court unaware of
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:37.920]  there's reporting was not aware of what how to recognize a vaccine damage and this is exactly
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:43.680]  what we see is that while the government set up the system in 86 and it was 14 shots we were
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:49.760]  pushing at that time 14 we are up to by the age of five we are up to you know 49 doses in some
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:55.920]  states in some states it's 63 in some states it's more if they push an annual flu shot or the
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:00.720]  the nasal inhalant for under six years of age and then in some states it's even more because
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:08.480]  we're seeing Gardasil while it's not on any state mandate other than Rhode Island it is being pushed
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:14.080]  heavily at the doctor's office so I see more bills coming on the road we know there's something
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:20.000]  called Healthy People 2020 which is for adults and it's tied to the Department of Transportation
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:26.960]  that's really frigging scary that means oh you know Mr. Jones you haven't we're we don't know
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:31.760]  that you've been vaccinated in the last 10 years you can't get on this flight you need to step out
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:40.000]  of the line and go get MMR, OPV, IPV, DPT that's right God knows what else that's what's going on
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.320]  as as dystopic a face I try to put on things I get an expert like you on Dr. Bark and then I
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:52.240]  start realizing all the horrible stuff I forgot to say they want this as a right to travel to
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:57.920]  supposedly medicalize us and this is a whole military industrial big pharma complex that's
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:04.240]  been caught in thousands of in many cases lethal secret testing on the general public why would
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:10.560]  we trust anything that big pharmaceutical companies like Bayer who for a decade knowingly
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:16.640]  had HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C in their factor 8 blood product and in their own court
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:21.760]  cases it mainstream news even NBC news came out and said they said screw it keep selling it who
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:27.760]  cares if we kill people I mean you talk about an arrogant group of evil folks Congress allowed them
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:32.960]  so Congress passed you know it was illegal for them to sell that factor at the HIV tainted factor
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:37.920]  8 in the States but Congress passed something at the 11th hour literally at the 11th hour it was
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:45.920]  like midnight on a Christmas Eve and yeah and they were allowed to um sell it to Spain, Portugal,
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:53.040]  and I believed um France or Japan and then about 15,000 people developed HIV from the tainted factor
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:57.040]  8 and there were lawsuits but you know it's the price of doing business I mean the amount they
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:02.000]  had to pay out is nothing compared to what they made and let's be clear the executives minutes
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.360]  have been public from the criminal trials in France and Australia and other areas it came out
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:12.160]  that they knew it had HIV and hepatitis was a death sentence to basically anyone that took
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:18.400]  it with the HIV and they did it folks these are sick people please continue doctor yeah so I mean
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:25.440]  that's one example you know there's many examples like the sv-40 tainted polio vaccine cancer virus
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:30.560]  exactly and that was the 40th simian virus you know we don't even talk about the other 39
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:37.440]  um but you know the government knew that they were aware that sv-40 was was contaminating that
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:41.520]  polio vaccine and what they said to the two I believe it was cutter that was first making it
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:46.400]  and then a few other companies was that you know will allow you to sell off this lots you've got
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:52.320]  till you've got a few more years to sell this off and then we want you to start over well there's
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:57.280]  actually so first of all that's egregious and nefarious and then there's evidence that it was
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:04.400]  in changing the vaccines as late as is 1997 well well you've done so much amazing work when you
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:08.720]  testified to congress or the senate I mean I know you try to crystallize the info down but
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:13.920]  we've got the cdc documents as you know from 2000 where they have the cdc's like I'm not gonna let
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:19.440]  my grandkids have this what are we gonna do we gotta cover this up but they never fixed it it's
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:25.360]  only gotten worse now there's more vaccines they want to take I mean as autism goes from you know
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:30.480]  one in 30 000 to one in 58 they're talking about one in three within a decade there's gotta be a
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:35.120]  point where they know the epidemic's going to be so bad that they're going to end up getting
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:40.160]  brought down or they just kick on the can down the road doctor no I mean if you think about it the
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:47.120]  healthcare system the whole system in the United States is the largest growing business it's a
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:53.200]  large growing field in the whole world I mean exponential you know between cvs's on every corner
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:59.840]  between hospitals growing and new medical centers and urgent cares everywhere this is an exploding
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:06.160]  field and so they see it as a win-win I mean if more people are sick you know if we can manage to
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:11.360]  not kill people but just really damage them so they have chronic illness then the drug companies
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:16.720]  make a lot of money the hospitals make a lot of money you know these non-profit quote-unquote
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:22.080]  hospitals they get away with so much bullshit I mean as far as I'm concerned it's worse than the
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:27.600]  for-profits because they get federal tax money they they sell a can of coke for ten dollars only
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:31.760]  get a dollar from insurance so then they get federal funding for the nine dollars or you know
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:37.280]  an aspirin for a hundred dollars or pap smear for 300 and the insurance company only pays 14
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:41.280]  and then the rest the federal government gives so it's just like the military industrial complex
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:46.160]  700 billion a year here alone of course they're funding al-qaeda of course they're funding terror
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:50.400]  groups because when the terror groups that attack they then have an excuse to go into those countries
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:54.560]  and half the time don't even target the actual group they'll target somebody totally innocent
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:22:00.240]  like the iraqi people well it you know so this is a good example so yesterday or the day before
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:04.480]  yesterday I was testifying all day so I was driving and testifying but the day before
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:09.680]  I was posting something and I saw somebody was talking about how great carbs and he studies
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:14.880]  cardiovascular disease and he's saying the benefit of eating a carb diet and I talked about ketogenic
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:19.920]  diets you know that I put a lot of my patients into ketosis that reverses cancer reverses diabetes
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:26.400]  it reverses heart disease even Alzheimer's and he immediately attacked me and said patients can die
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:32.400]  it's deadly dangerous I mean this is coming out the same day that you know the the whole industrial
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:36.800]  complex is admitting that pharmaceuticals is the third leading cause of death and I by the way
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:40.640]  think it's probably second or first leading cause of death and we can talk about that but
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:45.840]  you know to say that it's dangerous deadly dangerous to go into ketosis this is one of the most
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:52.720]  out of control mass killing industries ever it's like satan telling you if you read a playboy
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:56.720]  you might become satan I mean it's just it's just it's totally insane it's it's it's like
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:01.040]  hitler saying don't be mean to the jews in fact get into that doctor let's talk about the numbers
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:06.880]  because we find the same thing it looks like medical neglect medical problems you know mistakes and
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:11.600]  drugs are probably together the number one cause of death well I see it a little differently those
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:17.120]  are very high numbers that cause death but actually if you really think about it you know I'll see a
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:20.480]  breast cancer patient right and then I take the history because I spend two hours with all my
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:25.760]  patients and the history could be that they were in rounds and rounds and rounds of antibiotics
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:31.040]  rounds of antibiotics so you know we know that when you're on a lot of antibiotics
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:38.560]  it alters your bowel flora it also reduces your intrahepatic it increases intrahepatic circulation
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:44.080]  of hormones without degrading them and detoxifying them so it's possible that patient would have
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:48.640]  never had breast cancer if they weren't thrown antibiotics for every friggin sinus complaint
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:53.360]  every friggin cold you know so it's worse than that and then look at the vaccines that can possibly
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:58.320]  be contaminated with retroviruses we know that I mean we know that there's contamination prions
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:03.040]  retroviruses passages you know they put the vaccines through passages through these varro
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:07.920]  cells and these these longevity cell lines and at certain passages they're carcinogenic
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:13.600]  they're oncogenic so how do we know that a polio vaccine that somebody got when in the 60s when
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:19.200]  they were a child and now they're eating glyphosate you know on their food um that the combination
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:24.080]  is not increasing their risk for cancer you know especially then if they've had antibiotics thrown
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:29.920]  at them so a lot of times when you hear patients die from complications of their disease um I believe
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:33.840]  that they actually died from the medications you know another absolutely doctor stay right there
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:39.040]  I've got to say I am so impressed with you because I've done read so much literature
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:42.560]  mainline studies this stuff's really hidden out there but I've never heard somebody
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:47.760]  move as fast as you and bring up so many key things so hopefully maybe stay the whole hour if
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:51.440]  you can because I want to get more into this with you and and obviously have you back a lot
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:25:00.080]  but to dr uh Tony Barker's our guest disease-reversal.com back up a little bit and get into the viruses
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:04.320]  the prions folks that's what is connected to Alzheimer's and other things that we know are in
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:11.120]  the vaccines you got into immortal cell lines this is all mainline science but no one even knows this
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:17.600]  where they're getting these vaccines from is like these zombie cell lines and and just drill into
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:21.760]  then where you think this is really all going because you're absolutely right the average doctor
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:28.000]  isn't evil no but but but they're a priest of a cult that's run by the Rockefellers on record
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:33.920]  that wants you sick to basically take all your money from your whole life into their system
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:38.400]  and to control it because they don't just want the money they print the money they don't want
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:44.000]  you having your own discretionary income to build anything that could ever competes with them it's
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:51.040]  all about competition being a shin a total final takeover so please continue well okay so I you
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:56.560]  know I trained in pediatrics and rehab I ran a piece emergency room right and I knew that many
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:01.760]  kids reacted very badly to vaccines that was clear but when I trained we didn't vaccinate
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:06.960]  pregnant women we didn't vaccinate newbie you know newborns that were premature or sick we didn't
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:11.120]  even vaccinate women who are thinking of getting pregnant and again it was 14 shots by the age of
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:17.280]  five that was the 80s before this court so things were you know a vaccine could be risky but I was
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:21.760]  actually told oh we'll never mandate chickenpox vaccine because with every vaccine comes a risk
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:27.440]  of serious injury and it's not worth it for chickenpox right well that's all you know that's gone
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:31.920]  now all that's gone so as soon as they lost liability things went crazy but what I didn't
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:38.880]  know until I started doing my masters in 2010 was that you know these policies are based on nothing
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:44.880]  but lobbyists you know the lobbyists write these bills clearly um and then we've got regulatory
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:54.800]  capture to the nth degree I mean the committees at the CDC at the FDA are 100% with one exception
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:02.800]  of the consumer rep are people who work for the main manufacturers of the vaccines the CDC actually
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:07.520]  there is something called FACA which is federal advisory committee act which says you can't have
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:13.120]  undue conflict of interest financial or otherwise with the industry you're regulating and the CDC
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:18.400]  on their website says is a matter of policy they weigh that for people on that on the vaccine
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:24.480]  committees because they want specialists so we've got so that's a problem right there but
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:30.000]  when I was writing my papers I interviewed people that were the consumer reps at the time or had
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.440]  been consumer reps at the ASA committee at the HHS flu vaccine committee at the verbat committee
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:40.240]  and they all told me especially the one at the verbat committee that it's that they're very aware
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:44.960]  that there's contamination and if you go on to websites like Viruses which is a journal for
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:49.920]  people in the industry they'll say you know they'll advertise counters new counters that you know
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:55.280]  can test better sensitivity for prions in the bovine theorem you know these are the kind of ads so
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:59.840]  I started going on to Viruses and looking at the ads for the counters and you're talking about inside
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:06.240]  baseball inside the big plants what they're up to but again there's a this is all from my research
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:12.000]  a cover story even for the people working in the plants and the engineers and chemists and
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:17.760]  and virologists because there's a larger program above it just like our phones are full of hack
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:22.560]  tech and things for the whole shadow government that's now admitted vaccines are really overall
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:29.760]  just the cover for a larger binary weapons program I mean it it very well could be all I know
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:34.320]  is the the facts that I know is that it is contaminated and they're covering it up oh yeah
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:38.560]  I mean it that that's very clear and I don't believe that it started out with that intention
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:42.880]  I really don't believe that I think if you read the virus and the vaccine it's a book on the race
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:47.120]  to develop between soft and save it and the government to develop the polio vaccine but
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:51.120]  bring it back sure the monkey kidneys had the cancer virus I get it exactly but they're still
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:55.840]  giving stuff off the same you know batch they're still still having to recall it today because
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:00.640]  of it absolutely so we have a lot yeah it's a great that that's such a great book there's
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:04.480]  so many really good books out there but then meanwhile you have all this knowledge all these
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:08.640]  other great people have the knowledge it's a fact we raise it mainstream media goes there was never
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:14.160]  a cancer virus there's no secret fund none of it there's no side effects safe and effective
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:19.440]  safe and effective it's the law take the shots when there is no law but now they're trying to make
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:24.400]  laws we're gonna talk about forced inoculation and intimidation and colorado wanting to make you
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:29.040]  be in databases when we come back with our amazing guest boy you can tell us he's gonna be here a lot
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:36.960]  if she'll join us what a what an informed dynamic lady disease dash reversal dot com
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:43.200]  dr tony bark amazing lady i'm so glad uh that billy corgan uh said that i should get her on
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:51.040]  thank you billy we'll be back straight ahead stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:30:01.600]  alex jones and the gcn radio network the constitutional convention 1787 was held strict
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:06.160]  secrecy and at the end of the preceding citizens gathered outside independence hall to learn what
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:10.640]  had been produced behind closed doors while bitumen franklin was leaving the hall a lady asked him
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:16.160]  well doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy to which he responded a republic if you
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:20.320]  can keep it but today not only have we lost a republic but most people don't even know what
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:25.440]  a republic even is for one thing a republic is not a democracy where republic operates under
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:29.520]  the rule law which protects individual liberties so that the majority cannot take away the rights
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:33.920]  of the minority under a public the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws regardless
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:38.480]  of political power or lack thereof democracy on the other hand only leads to mob rule fueled by
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:42.480]  the unrestrained whims of the public and a democracy the individual or any groups of
[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:46.160]  individuals composing the minority have no protection against the unlimited power of the
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:51.200]  majority it is a case of majority over man in other words under democracy two wolves can vote
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:55.200]  to eat the sheep for dinner but under a republic the sheep's right to life is protected by the

[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:28.240]  kids don't because they see the reactions the nurses at the hospital all three of my kids tried
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:33.280]  to pressure and they said we don't have ours either but you know yeah we see it we've had nurses on
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:40.160]  to the heads of er's and the heads of premium uh floors and they come in the bioethics board
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:46.160]  and says vaccinate them six month old baby and they go but they they have breathing problems and
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:51.120]  die and they say do it so they get the paddles ready and they get the defibrillators and they
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:54.720]  and then they give them the shots and watch which ones start dying and they they save them they
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:01.040]  give the shots and then they save them but some die we've had them on whistleblowers it's been
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:07.680]  in the news and then it came out in newspapers after we had them on yeah see you still you knew

[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:59.920]  that we have left in the broadcast here Dr. Tony Bark disease-reversal.com and again she's a medical
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:04.320]  doctor and she is uh Billy Corgan's personal physician he said this lady knows more than
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:08.240]  anybody I know and I when I looked her up I said oh I've seen her on c-span I've seen her I know
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:12.400]  I've seen her website she's a really you know smart lady yeah let's get her on but wow blowing
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:18.880]  us away breaking down vaccines we were getting to forced inoculation we were getting to having
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:24.080]  to get shots to get on a plane or to get your driver's license Bill Clinton signed an executive
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:31.280]  order they never implemented it but they started it uh the ball rolling back in 1997 it's in my
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:37.680]  first film America Destroyed by Design to take urine and blood to get a driver's license now
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:44.480]  DC started a few years ago free driver's license if you give them a blood sample so it's begun
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:51.040]  let's get into how they're trying to force us to have the government and corporations make us
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:58.000]  put things in our body the final frontier and then we have convulsions and die a secret tribunal
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.800]  if we jump through 10 years of hoops might give a half million dollars of taxpayer money
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:08.320]  quietly to our families doctor well okay so first of all all of the health sciences have been
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:13.040]  completely corrupted but as far as I'm concerned the vaccine issue is the worst one because that's
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:18.400]  the only time we see mandates for public school for certain jobs so that's why it's the most
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:24.000]  egregious in my mind but you know in my film and bought you know one of the whistleblowers I
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.240]  interviewed was a straight a state fraud investigator who was fired for investigating state fraud
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:35.600]  because it it had to do with pharma and he was told you know pharma pays both sides of the aisle
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:41.280]  back off of this and he didn't so he was fired of course you know many many years later about a
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:45.440]  decade later got settled he got a lot of money from the EOC just from being fired and then of
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:50.800]  course the whole thing was settled for about five billion dollars but there was an organization or
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:56.560]  ring of seven states where the director's mental health for those states were trying to implement
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:03.600]  team app which was a texas it was a test that you would implement to kids in junior high
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:11.920]  and it would it would point out the risk of kids who were maybe bipolar you know or difficult you
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:17.760]  know had behavior issues and it was in order to push drugs on kids and they were pushing drugs
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:21.760]  that were not even they were off-label that weren't even approved for kids I mean this was the whole
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:27.040]  goal and bush push that is the new freedom and it's nationwide yes yes that was bush pushing that
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:34.320]  exactly I mean it's it's it's so frightening that you know so they start with vaccines and by the
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:39.680]  way I recently ran into a priest high up in the catholic church internationally who told me that
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:45.840]  he knows what's going on that he has seen many people vaccinated at gunpoint in third world country
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:52.160]  oh yeah and that he knows that if you're high up in the in the Vatican you know the WHO is a problem
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:58.480]  I mean he was aware of what was going on in Kenya I mean in Ghana I think it was oh yeah the Africans
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:01.920]  used to love the white witch doctors 100 years ago that shut up because they knew they had good
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:06.400]  medicine right the last 50 years they run I mean this is in the news because they know
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.680]  because they they go they come to a village find pregnant give shot my baby die everyone and then
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:16.000]  I mean these are people been interviewed all over the world they just are killing them well look
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:21.760]  what happened in Africa with the swine flu shot so in Europe and in Australia they recognize that
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:27.680]  some kids get narcolepsy from that shot right and they got paid out but not but we had an epidemic
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:33.760]  of nodding disease in Africa oh yeah interesting right and if you look at where it was it was
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:37.680]  where that swine flu shot was sorry don't rub you're just too incredible hey bring up all these
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:43.520]  points I forgot about remember in 96 and again a few years ago they officially got caught the UN
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:49.520]  adding a hormone to the tetanus shot to cause a second trimester that was in the Philippines
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:54.240]  and it was a late 90s it was htg and that's what was going on in Kenya last year and the Catholic
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:59.760]  doctors and the Catholic bishops pointed it out so it happened in the Philippines in the late 90s
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:04.720]  and it happened again in Kenya so it's htg which is a hormone that your placenta makes when you're
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:09.040]  pregnant and so if you have antibodies to it every time you're pregnant you're gonna attack your own
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:13.760]  placenta and what was so sick you're the doctor but I would remember reading an article it wasn't
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:18.400]  just that would kill the baby it would cause autoimmune disease in the women's uteruses where
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:23.040]  your body attacks itself and if they were doing this in the 90s and the UN got caught they said
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:28.000]  it was an accident that got added but turned out they had over a hundred makers around the world
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.880]  all accidentally adding this well I didn't know how many makers but I did know what happened in
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:36.880]  the Philippines and it was called out and I think again by the Catholic was all over the country
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:41.360]  yeah all the world sorry yeah I mean you know so I don't know if you know this one this is also
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:46.000]  brilliant because people think Tuskegee was so long ago but when I was speaking at rallies in
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:52.800]  Sacramento last year I brought up that in early 1990s the CDC along with Kaiser Permanente Kaiser
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:58.800]  Permanente which is huge in California was conducting experiments on infant inner-city
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:04.240]  black and hispanic kids under the months of 18 months of age in order to oversee if they could
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:08.000]  overwhelm maternal field antibodies and what were they doing they were giving an experimental
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  measles shot a 10 to 500 times the dose now the you went yeah the CDC was doing this with
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.320]  John you just blew me away that you just told me something I didn't know now I'm impressed I was
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:23.760]  aware of secret vaccine and pesticide testing on inner-city youth mainly black but but that's
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:27.840]  because no one would stand up for them but there's other groups as well
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:34.240]  including killing children with pesticides I'm sorry it's just so insane look you found the LA Times
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:42.000]  wow CDC says it messed up it aired in measles study whoa yeah aired how tried it was criminal
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:47.440]  okay and it wasn't just there in LA the CDC at the same time simultaneously was doing it with
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:52.960]  Johns Hopkins in West Africa Haiti and there were deaths and they had to stop it because of the deaths
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:58.640]  but listen to this so we've got now a cohort a kid who are in their late 20s who were given
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:03.680]  measles shots at 10 to 500 times the dose and nobody's following up on them because they were
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:08.800]  probably given $100 and a pizza it's worse though I just thought of this it's the measles vaccine
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:14.560]  that we found the antibodies in the guts of mostly autistic children oh my god and then I keep wondering
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:18.800]  why does fluoride hit blacks double bad or vaccines but then I see some of the studies
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:22.800]  that they're actually giving more vaccines or special vaccines for the blacks that are even
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:27.760]  worse then I learned in mainstream news that the rich and the elites quote get the clean vaccines
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:33.440]  I bet this rabbit hole goes a lot deeper I'm sorry doctor I'm shut up go ahead well okay so people
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:38.880]  when I when I said this at one of the rallies people were going crazy because nobody had nobody
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:43.440]  had heard of this you know it was a little article in the LA Times like oh no big deal you know
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:50.800]  we aired we aired how do you air by not disclosing it's an experiment by not by not letting parents
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:56.640]  know you're giving 10 to 500 times the recommended dose of a new experimental vaccine I mean that's
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:02.880]  not an error that is criminal behavior and it was one article in the LA Times and I think there was
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:09.040]  one article somewhere out east and that was it and then it was dropped I mean this is unbelievable
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:14.400]  can you imagine it can it was kind of like when Baxter had the the flu shots and it had
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:21.600]  H1N1 or H1N5 in it and all the hummus died well no this was the one that got to the Ukraine and
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:26.000]  they tested it on ferrets and so they were all dying and somebody at the Ukraine at the testing
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.880]  station caught it but Baxter said it was a mistake and didn't want to I remember that when it killed
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:35.360]  all the ferrets but look at this one the telegraph hummus diet or bird flu vaccine trial in Poland
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:39.440]  and they said it usually only kills a couple people out of 30 but this one killed most of them
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:46.160]  oh I mean it is so it's really crazy but I'll tell you that most doctor this is a religious
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:51.120]  belief you know I mean I was guilty too I was inculcated no I know doctors will tell you there's
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:55.760]  no problems that's made up and I'm like I have 500 mainstream news articles and the inserts saying
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:47:01.440]  it and they go no you don't yeah it's so it's so it's really akin to a religious belief in the
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:07.840]  system you know you believe that the CDC tells you good information most doctors are kind of not
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:14.400]  not aware of how the world works in terms of how business works right they're not business minded
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:19.360]  in general and so they don't understand just like with mainstream media I mean 70% of their
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:24.400]  advertising money in a non-election year is pharma you're gonna bite the hand that feeds you I don't
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:30.080]  think so and the CDC has a revolving door you know it's kind of like what the FDA whistleblower who
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:35.920]  who exposed the viacs issue he said that he was taken aside and said who do you think you work for
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:41.760]  you work for the people or you work for the industry you work for the industry that's what's
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:46.880]  going on I tell you I get somebody like you on because I read hundreds of news articles a day
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:51.120]  you start reminding me of stuff I read years ago and we pull it up and then I and then you bring
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:55.840]  up stuff I didn't even know about and I'm just wondering I wonder what else has never come out
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:00.960]  I mean I'd imagine it's probably 10 times what we know doctor oh you know it's so it's a rabbit hole
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:05.440]  this is what I when I spoke in Rhode Island when the Department of Public Health which was allowed
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:11.120]  to make legislation without legislators approval and mandated Gardasil for all six graders boys and
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:15.760]  girls in the fall I was immediately flown out with Diane Harper who was one of the key architects
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:23.200]  of that vaccine and consulted for Merck and it's it's unbelievable because most doctors are just
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:29.360]  unaware and what I think is that it's it's a rabbit hole so the doctors that came heard it and
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:35.600]  got incensed not at me at at the system you know they're like wow I had no idea and I understand
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:39.920]  like they start falling down that rabbit hole so that's the good news is this is coming out because
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.400]  I had a pediatrician one of the biggest pediatricians in Austin about five years ago grabbed me and go
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:49.920]  listen I volunteer for free clinics you know and he goes they were giving the old sv-40 to the kids
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:53.920]  and he's tossed it I can't believe he said but don't quote me you can say your doctor said it
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:59.120]  just don't say my name he's since retired but again there's this fear too that's an illegal
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:05.600]  vaccine what what are they doing giving it to black youth again I mean this is getting really
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:09.840]  weird I mean this is and then and then where's the black leaders where are the Hispanic leaders
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:14.960]  as they're trying to give every girl in Mexico Gardasil that we know has been banned in all these
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:21.120]  countries and linked directly to sterilizing women and autoimmune disorders where are the
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:26.560]  Mexican flag waving Ford Foundation you know people that are beating up folks at Trump rallies
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:30.720]  I mean we really don't want you to kill your children I mean we really care about you you're a human
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:35.360]  put down the Mexican flag for a minute and actually listen to us well I actually called
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:43.200]  the lawyer for the NAACP in DC right so I made him aware he was aware he was disturbed by it but he
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:50.240]  wouldn't do anything about it he wouldn't say anything special place in hell yeah and he's
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:54.080]  probably not even one of the worst because he is like no I know but they know and then they're
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:50:00.160]  afraid they're hurting children folks they're afraid for real reason um you know like and you
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:04.720]  know Andy Andy Wakefield who's brilliant and I can't say enough good things about that man
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:10.880]  him he's a true gentleman and renaissance man and I've been proven right yes many times over
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:17.440]  in fact but you know they ruined his life I mean thank god he and his wife they are amazing
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:21.840]  and go through life in a positive way I don't know how they did it I don't think I could do it with
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:27.120]  all the vilification that he's suffered um but you know look what happens I mean and worse things
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:30.640]  happen I mean we know that I mean remember the Australian government and there's nothing you
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:33.920]  don't seem to know remember when they had the vaccine maker and the internal email in the lawsuit
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:38.800]  say we need to start killing these people the anti-vax folks well in viacs when they when they
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:44.160]  got things through discovery the emails the internal emails at merc for viacs was we need to
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:49.440]  neutralize physicians here's the list of physicians that need to be neutralized and you need to go
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:54.720]  to their homes if necessary yeah and then strangely enough some of them had been killed mysteriously

[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:33.040]  i had a fever for four or five days and then never talked again but they say there's no vaccine
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:37.520]  connection well in the old days like when my uncle took a tetanus shot and almost killed him his whole
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:43.200]  body swelled up no the doctor said no it's a bad reaction the tetanus shot the insert says it now
[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:48.080]  they're trying to say none of this exists and i would just want to encourage dr tony bark disease
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:53.360]  dash reversal dot com you can check out the books the films the information they're on her site the
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:59.680]  news articles it's excellent i just want to ask her in condensing all this where we go from here
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:04.400]  because you know she speaks to big groups of doctors and they're waking up they see it a lot
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:08.560]  of members of congress have children or grandchildren that are fine at their house one week the next
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:12.400]  week brain damage never talking again they're not going to get away with this they think they're just
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:16.880]  going to keep propagandizing it you know why his breast cancer up a couple thousand percent in every
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:22.080]  western country they never ask why it's up they say find the cure well we know it's glyphosates and
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:27.280]  other things and the antibiotics like she said that turn off the immune system and kill our guts
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:32.640]  just like the new york times admitted a month ago wow most cancers communicable and most of it passes
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:40.240]  through the gut everything dr blalock a brain surgeon said 25 years ago what wakefield said
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:47.760]  we know turns out the rockefeller foundation the bill among the gates foundation well since the
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:52.800]  20s the rockefellers have been obsessed with gut flora turns out they were way ahead of the curve
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:58.960]  turns out there's some evil people dr enclosing other points for folks here just want to appreciate
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:03.920]  your work thank you what other points you want to impart to people about what they should know
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:09.040]  yeah so you know when i tell people after a large lecture everyone's like what can we do and i
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:14.000]  think you have to start locally with your legislators because they truly don't know anything so in
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:19.280]  illinois there's a j car committee it's a joint commission and they so it's it's congress it's the
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:24.160]  house i mean it's the house it's the senate and it's right and it's left and they vote on things
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:29.920]  like mandates like like rules for the id for the department of public health you need to go everyone
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:37.680]  needs to go to their rep and educate them because they're okay i mean honestly after doing this work
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:43.360]  politically i can tell you that most legislators don't know don't know much sorry i have a potty
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:49.360]  mouth um they they really don't know and they're spending all their time canvassing for money for
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:54.560]  their next election that is their main concern totally self-centered narcissistic people that
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:58.400]  don't give a damn about anybody including their own kids are all committing suicide well i don't
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:02.160]  know about that but i can tell you that they don't say on average a lot of these globalists
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:06.640]  are totally self-centered they just can't care less well so the local but we have to start
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:11.040]  locally because they're making the the mandates at your state right you need to let them know you're
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:15.680]  not going to vote for them you will get other people to vote in power if they don't really
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:20.080]  represent you and you need to educate them because many of them are actually a guest
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:24.000]  when they find out they don't know about the vaccine court they don't know about the lack of
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.400]  liability they don't know that there's a table of injuries that hasn't been updated since the
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:33.680]  vaccine court started and we added another 45 vaccines they don't know any of this and when
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:39.120]  they hear it they actually become yeah they're shocked so you know that's the good news is the
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:44.240]  globalists are doing all this arrogantly they're just forcing us to go out and be bigger activist
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:49.280]  and take our government back absolutely and you know the more they push the more we find out i mean
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:55.680]  vacs would have never afforded this kind of a pr campaign and i immediately you know email dawn
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:58:01.280]  on delo i was like wow you have gotten such free pr this is brilliant i was the fed wouldn't have
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:06.080]  threatened uh the the the places where they were going to show it if there hadn't been pressure put
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:11.680]  on robert inero it wouldn't have a strizan effect oh yeah what it would have like 150 people seeing
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:17.280]  it a try back on the 24th you know that's sunday afternoon it would have been it and in the meantime
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:22.560]  man it's gotten major exposure because me thinks she does protest too much right i mean it piqued
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:26.960]  interest of people who had never even heard of this and would never have heard of it except
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:30.240]  they made it into sure it shows their arrogance doctor do five more minutes whether something

[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:16.560]  ago with us in studio did a tape interview with leon macadoo i want to promote that properly so
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:22.080]  that's going to air next wednesday during my show it's about a 29 interview very powerful
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:26.320]  he said even more controversial stuff during that and people say oh he's a rock star who cares
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:31.760]  he's a super smart guy who knows what he's talking about has a great spirit and has the courage to
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:36.080]  speak out but let me tell you i have other big movie stars and folks on here you think robert
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:39.760]  deniro had him go after him and the feds went after folks in texas and high-level government
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:46.480]  officials not to show facts the stuff they do when you're in entertainment you've sold 50 million
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:52.240]  records the way they come after you is scary and he's got the courage so it's that courage i admire
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:57.680]  not just the fact he's a smart guy and has great music so finishing up with other solutions dr bark
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:03.040]  get out there get involved force them to act like thugs don't be scared we're fighting for
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:07.920]  children to not be brain damaged here exactly and we're fighting for children and for ourselves
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:13.040]  for our lives because remember the vaccines are coming for you for the adult and if we don't if we
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:16.880]  don't you know if we just take this lying down that's going to happen but i want to say that
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:22.240]  underneath well first of all i want to say that billy corgan is incredibly brilliant and i was
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:26.960]  going to use a different word than incredibly but i can't say that on your show but he is one of the
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:33.120]  most brilliant minds i i know and and wickedly talented aside from that though let me tell
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:38.720]  you that underneath all vaccine injury and all chronic disease and all chronic pain syndromes
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:44.960]  is what i would call a dysautonomic syndrome so the autonomic nervous system perceives itself
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:49.840]  to be an attack and it's it can be an emotional attack it can be a physical attack but it can
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:55.760]  be this environmental chemical attack and the body goes into protect itself which is
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:01.440]  chronic sympathetic tone fight and flight all the time and you can't heal in that tone
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:05.760]  so the work that i did in my graduate school in addition to looking at vaccines was looking at
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:10.240]  first responders that are damaged because we we had first responders coming back from war
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:17.360]  over 30 of them are chronically damaged and there's ways of reversing all chronic disease
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:22.640]  and damage which is to deal with that excessive fight and flight and to get the autonomic nervous
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:28.160]  system working first and say it those that us that engage evil all the time taken on i know i do
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:32.560]  we kind of get ptsd what are some of those techniques to get this stuff off of a stock
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:38.560]  well okay so i use a handheld device that oddly enough was created in russia in the cosmonaut
[02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:43.360]  program about 35 years ago and it measures electrical impedance it's very scientific
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:47.120]  it's actually approved in this country for you know pain and injury i'm using it off label for
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:52.400]  many things but i can measure impedance and see where along the sympathetic chain and acupuncture
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:59.120]  points there is still excessive sympathetic tone and i can dialogue with an electrical frequency
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:04.320]  into the anterior hypothalamus to convince the anterior hypothalamus which is the master control
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:08.560]  of everything in your body that you're not by the way but there's a there's real science and there's
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:12.640]  kooks that misuses but i've got dr nick megachom of the thousands of government patents on this
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:17.120]  that's on the subject the globalists know about this and they admit even darpa has been in major
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:22.560]  news yes they're quote testing waves to control us so this stuff's going on yeah electrical
[02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:26.480]  frequency so that a body is electrical we're electrical the difference between something
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:31.280]  alive and dead is actually the electricity the chemistry comes second and so our whole system
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:35.680]  our autonomic nervous system is electrical it has to be addressed aside from visiting somebody who
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:40.480]  knows how to deal with these devices acupuncture electrical acupuncture homeopathy breathwork
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:45.120]  meditation you know these things can help a lot well we are electrochemical and i want to have
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:49.680]  you back about that that is intriguing i know about the russian studies thank you so much you're
[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:55.280]  amazing disease-reversal.com you're awesome dr bark thank you thank you thank you it was fun
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:59.920]  loved it you've had incredible lady all right we got uh stone coming up start your antifederalist
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:04.160]  patrick kenry was opposed to the constitution fearing it would become a monster that would take
[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:08.240]  over not only the sovereign states that had created it but that it would become a tool to
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:13.680]  destroy individual liberty his warnings ignored have now come to pass he said you're not to
[02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:18.880]  inquire how your trade may be increased nor how you were to become a great and powerful people
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:24.160]  but how your liberties can be secured for liberty ought to be the direct end of your government
[02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:28.960]  patrick kenry warned us the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:34.160]  transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them today everything the government does
[02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:39.280]  at every level is concealed from us we have trade deals to manage our economy that not even
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:43.760]  our elected representatives are allowed to see later in life patrick kenry looked back and said
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:48.560]  when the american spirit was in its youth the language of america was different liberty sir
[02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:55.280]  was the primary object today our primary concern is safety and comfort when we should be demanding

[02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:05.520]  thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums
[02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:12.720]  of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago
[02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:19.120]  when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid
[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:26.000]  sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:32.320]  and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate

[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:38.960]  there are many times when i'm with my children at the beach
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:45.040]  and it's one of those days that seems to go on forever everything is just completely perfect
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:52.080]  and you catch yourself about three hours into the experience not even talking
[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:58.080]  your little daughter walks over with sand all over her arms and face she's smiling at you with
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:03.280]  that shovel in her hand and just looks at the water with you and you know she wants you to
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:11.680]  go get the pail and dump water into the moat at her castle you're clicked or synced words like
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:26.960]  violence break the silence song like that says it all right vows are broken
[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:30.720]  i think only when they've been spoken
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:38.160]  real vows aren't spoken my friends in my experience they happen in your heart
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:45.440]  i'm just glad i have feelings and care about humanity and myself
[02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:51.520]  i'm an old sap you could say in the modern world i i care about trying to be good to people i notice
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:56.240]  a lot of people take being nicer caring about them as weakness like why is this person being nice to me
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:10:02.880]  why is this person rewarding me why is this person empowering me they must be weak let me try to push
[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:08.960]  them around but folks like that who've been brought up in the modern system quickly find out that's
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:19.600]  not why i was trying to be nice to them i don't know it's just that the globalists are so evil
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:27.120]  they're so out of control and they're so cold-blooded they don't have any empathy for anyone they really
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:34.160]  are sociopathic slash psychopathic but so many others that serve the corrupt systems
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:41.120]  are simply afraid and they want power they want status they live in denial about what they're doing
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:47.920]  and they engage in their activities because they think they'll get temporal success out of it
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:51.680]  the problem is your subconscious mind is
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:11:03.200]  debated but it's it's it's agreed upon that it is many orders of magnitude stronger
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:12.160]  and more intuitive than your conscious mind which is your limited cerebral cortex
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:22.800]  ocular focus it's like the surface of the ocean versus the continuum of the entire body
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:30.960]  in fact that's one of the deepest quotes ever by donald trump
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:37.920]  i don't really plan any of this but will you guys search engine donald trump
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:45.360]  on shallowness donald trump's shallowness quote because donald trump is is is self-deprecating
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:51.120]  he's funny he does some things that disagree with he's a classic alpha male just in all of his
[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:59.520]  ridiculous golden toadness uh it's it's it's it's it's fun i mean i make fun of myself all day as
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:08.240]  well that's that's a good sign but some of his quotes that he says off the cuff are like philosophy
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:15.120]  2.0 and he has this quote about one of the deepest moments i ever had was when i learned
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:20.160]  to not sit there and overthink stuff and just be shallow when i began to look at things on
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:25.360]  their surface it was a very deep moment for me now i'm paraphrasing the quote if you guys can find it
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:40.480]  but your first approximation is generally your best because it's the giant subconscious brain
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:46.320]  and all of your accrued life knowledge and all your genetic memory all your instincts everything
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:54.800]  focused in in that snapshot just like a woman's first intuitions or or your first impression
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:00.880]  is so important now the globalists and everybody else try to have the glitzy car and the suit and
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:05.040]  it's all leveraged to the hill so that people think you're more successful than you are there's
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:10.480]  certainly camouflage coloration manipulation within that paradigm but everybody knows
[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:17.600]  quotes that first impressions are incredibly important and the media runs that quote constantly
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:26.080]  making fun of donald trump like he's the biggest buffoon in the galaxy because he said that
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:39.120]  and it's a profound statement there it is and to make creative choices i try to step back and
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:45.840]  remember my first shallow reaction the day i realized it can be smart to be shallow was for me
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:53.520]  a deep experience now what did donald trump just say right there he just said i go with my gut
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:04.640]  he just said i i go with my instincts what does a woman tell you it's well no women have
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:08.640]  better intuition than men they better they have three times the connections between less and around
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:12.320]  hemisphere than men do and have parts of their brains men don't even have
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:19.680]  so the whole system's about telling women what to think all day this advertisement that
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:22.720]  everywhere look at this look at that because see women actually guide and run the society
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:28.560]  women have the kids women women are the civilization they're everything men are a
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:35.600]  production in the female womb of i need warriors i need men like this this is what i need to push
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:40.400]  the species this is what i need to go out and do things for me and go out and and and and take care
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:48.320]  of me and and take care of the children i'm gonna have it's like a queen aunt or b sitting in the
[02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:53.120]  middle of a hive but instead you look what they do to women telling women they're gonna empower them
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:58.080]  have they empowered women no they haven't they've done the opposite they've taken women off the
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:04.640]  pedestal and put them in the gutter because they don't want women with that first approximation
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:10.320]  with all that genetic knowledge going around and going what's my first shallow thing on this
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:17.280]  it's not a shallow analysis it's the entire race consciousness of the species and a whole
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:29.920]  another set of dna men don't even have what does that tell you and that's why hitler said first you
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:44.560]  get the women then you have the children so follow the men first you get the women then
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:53.760]  you've got the children so follow the men like dominoes falling over right into their hands
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:59.680]  let's play some trump clubs and i'm gonna get more into this another little delicious
[02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:05.120]  jewel from trump remember the eu has come out unelected uk didn't vote to enter it
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:09.760]  no just all these weird prime minister signed deals treaties didn't get ratified they're under
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:15.280]  they just say you're under it nato stands by with jump jets to attack you if you don't go along with
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:25.040]  it for every refugee you don't let in for the Islamification quarter million euro fine
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:31.040]  and then what does trump say another horrible evil radical statement from him
[02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:43.040]  him he backs the european union leaving or he he backs the the uk leaving the european union
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:47.680]  but that's just a common sense thing they make almost 90 percent of their laws
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:53.440]  the eu bureaucracy is unelected it's involved in all this corruption it's a sick joke
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:57.760]  why would you want to be part of it let's play that clip i think the eu with what's happened
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:02.400]  with the migration and a lot of people are saying that the eu is sort of the one that you know the
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:07.120]  ones that are pushing it i think the migration has been a horrible thing for europe i looked at
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:10.880]  germany i looked at different countries even parts of sweden where they never had a problem
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:15.360]  in their life and they're going through hell right now you look at what's going on with that a lot
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:20.000]  of that was pushed by the eu i would say that they're better off without it personally but
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:25.680]  i'm not making that as a recommendation just my feeling i know great britain very well i know
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:30.320]  you know the country very well i have a lot of investments there i would say that they're better
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:36.560]  off without it but i want them to make their own decision and of course they're better off
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:41.040]  not having a giant bureaucracy sitting on top of them that's from the wall street journal
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:46.480]  of course they're better off not having a group that wants to undermine them and social engineer
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:53.440]  with with the head of the eu migration program saying europe is racist because it's white let's
[02:17:53.440 --> 02:18:00.160]  get rid of it peter southerland no you just want to get rid of it because once you've sunk it
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:04.720]  everybody else will be poor you can rule over us because your tax exempt you criminal
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:14.560]  he is a criminal let's go to trump uh responds to the never trumpers the bushes and the and the
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:21.920]  and the the the trotsky eye crystals and everybody i mean what a joke it's a badge of courage that this
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:27.120]  collection of scum is against trump the bushes and william christle we're endorsing trump i'd be
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:33.120]  against him let's go to it never trump you know why it's never trump because i'm gonna stop the
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:38.400]  gravy train for all these consultants and all of these people that are ripping off our country
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:46.560]  it's called the gravy train so never trump by the way a lot of these never trumps are calling
[02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:52.480]  up but mr trump i admire you greatly sir we'd love to join the campaign i said didn't you do a
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:58.560]  horrible enemy two weeks ago and why do you want to show we said horrible things i said how do you
[02:18:58.560 --> 02:19:04.080]  pivot from that to say you think i'm a wonderful person he said no problems sir you know why
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:10.640]  politicians they could do that i have a hard time doing it they can do it it's a hard time doing it
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:16.240]  doesn't me uh they're just so scared of him folks because for all of his aggressiveness and there's
[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:19.200]  a little bit of gangsterish stuff in there i don't mean literal gangster but you know that
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:24.320]  that's a male attribute is like a rhinoceros trump just doesn't like america being screwed over
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:29.200]  he's like why why should we make these weird deals because that's globalism trump and he knows that
[02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:36.080]  and he's exposing that we have another clip coming up after break the coal miners endorse trump
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:39.840]  over hillary's incredible eyes he will destroy hillary they've been wrong about everything
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:44.240]  else about trump but they say oh he's gonna lose big to hillary some made-up polls said let me tell
[02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:52.160]  him all we do is win with trump even if he loses because he's injecting real issues and promoting

[02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:11.600]  body my sunny disposition turned to depression and low energy many years later i understood what
[02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:17.040]  had happened and in 1991 i replaced these mercury fillings with white composite in 1997 i learned
[02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:22.000]  that the homeopathic mercury detox i did years earlier did not remove the mercury from my body
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:26.720]  i began an effective means of removing mercury from my body my digestion and elimination returned

[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:26.120]  the globalists don't want people to be aware of it. Hillary came out with
[02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:29.200]  Obama and said we're gonna bankrupt coal, we're gonna get rid of it. And the coal
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:31.680]  miners said you said you were gonna bankrupt this. She goes, I never said
[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:35.760]  that, sweetie pie. I'm sorry what you heard me say sounded like that. I love
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:40.560]  you. Well, they're not buying it. They've come out as a national union and
[02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:46.320]  endorse Trump. Let's go ahead and play that clip. Coal miners endorse Donald
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:57.520]  Trump. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. On behalf of the best coal miners on
[02:24:57.520 --> 02:25:02.160]  behalf of the best coal miners in the world, to mine the cleanest and
[02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:07.840]  safest amongst environmentally sound coal in the world, we're so pleased to
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:11.640]  introduce to it and endorse you today. We wish you the best of luck and
[02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:15.840]  vital support to the best we can. Thank you so much.
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:23.680]  There's this whole globalist agenda to screw everyone over and all Donald
[02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:27.880]  Trump wants to do is stop the policies that admit the deindustrializes. That's
[02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:34.560]  all he's doing. He just has to not be our enemy and we'll do great. By the way,
[02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:44.400]  that's the same for every other country. Multinationals have come in and gotten
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:49.000]  countries to do things that are against their people's interest.
[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:57.400]  That's all a nation state is. Is a group to defend that another group doesn't
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:00.360]  come in and take over what you've developed and what you've built? Because
[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:04.200]  I'm an anarchist, you know, down at bottom, but in a complex world with seven
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:09.160]  and a half billion people, you've got to have something to protect what you've
[02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:13.120]  built. And I like the Swiss model where everybody's armed and got grenade
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:16.480]  launchers and they've got armored fortresses every few miles that if the
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:20.480]  citizens need to go in with a key and open it up, they got missile launchers and
[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:25.600]  anti-aircraft guns and 50 caliber rifles. Of course, you know Switzerland has the
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:30.200]  lowest crime rate in the world. Next to Japan, no one's sure who's got a lower
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:34.200]  crime rate in the world. It's probably Switzerland. And every citizen just has
[02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:40.200]  access, who doesn't have a criminal record, they have a very low crime rate, to
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:47.400]  armored redoubts, whether you're in a valley or a mountainside, and just full
[02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:53.200]  of weapons. One time Rob do when he lived in Switzerland for a year, a couple
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:56.200]  seasons there and there's snow seasons. A lot of Americans go over there that
[02:26:56.200 --> 02:26:59.800]  are into skiing and, you know, work there for basically to just be paid for the
[02:26:59.800 --> 02:27:04.000]  ski after college he did that. And he talked about one time he was coming down
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:08.600]  with some locals. They said, let's go over here get something to eat. And they pull
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:12.920]  in, they open the big door, big iron door, and it's like all these weapons locked
[02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:17.920]  up and all these explosives, but also food. The local said, let's have some soup.
[02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:21.000]  I'm going from memory, but he told me that story like five years ago, but he ought
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:26.040]  to come in here sometime and talk about that. But, oh, trusting your citizens with
[02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:30.720]  grenade launchers and they have the lowest crime rate and nobody's invaded
[02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:36.040]  them for 400 years. It all happened because of William Tell, you know, the guy
[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:39.440]  that had to put the apple on his kid's head and shoot it with a crossbow, that's
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:45.200]  true story. They'd sent in basically an Austrian-Hungarian Empire, it predated
[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:49.440]  that, but a Germanic group had come in and taken over Switzerland. They were
[02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:53.480]  taking people's women, they were putting kids into slavery, they were taking
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:59.840]  people's property and William Tell had to go back and get his kid away from him
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:03.240]  and they said, oh, shoot the apple off his head. This true story, you can have
[02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:07.320]  your kid back. You know what happened after he got his kid back? He slaughtered
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:15.680]  a whole bunch of them. See, that's the ethos of Switzerland. We need to get back
[02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:20.680]  to that, folks. And what do they have? Higher standard of living in the world,
[02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:25.560]  beautiful country, sovereign run by their cantons, their states come together
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:28.960]  once a year and run the federal government. Nobody dares invade them and
[02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:33.640]  every mile there's a cave with rocket launchers and weapons ready. The
[02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:37.840]  citizens are the government, they are the force, they don't need some big giant
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:43.880]  army because anybody that came in there would be dead in a hammer. The United
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:49.360]  States copied Switzerland and the Netherlands. The Netherlands got rid of
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:55.760]  their Swiss model. The Swiss had their model set up because William Tell's
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:05.160]  experience, but after that the Dutch continually had pirates basically robbing
[02:29:05.160 --> 02:29:12.000]  their ports and so they said we're going to have what we call night watches so
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:15.160]  all the different ports built their own private little castles with cannons and
[02:29:15.160 --> 02:29:19.000]  weapons and everything else and had militias and the piracy stopped within a
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:23.840]  few decades. So after a hundred years they got along with everybody pretty good
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:28.280]  so they got rid of it. You can Google a Rembrandt called Night Watch and it
[02:29:28.280 --> 02:29:31.800]  shows the Night Watch like 50 guys with a little kid, he's got a weapon as well.
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:35.000]  They're all sitting with their blunderbuss, their cannons, the rest of it,
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:38.200]  sitting right out front the Night Watch right there at the dock, their little
[02:29:38.200 --> 02:29:42.040]  castle, all their weapons, drinking beer, sitting back waiting for any pirates to
[02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:47.320]  try to come in. The answer is arm the good people and watch tyranny evaporate.
[02:29:47.320 --> 02:29:56.760]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:57.960 --> 02:30:03.040]  The Constitutional Convention 1787 was held strict secrecy and at the end of
[02:30:03.040 --> 02:30:06.320]  the preceding citizens gathered outside Independence Hall to learn what had been
[02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:09.680]  produced behind closed doors. While Benjamin Franklin was leaving the hall a
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:14.320]  lady asked him, well doctor what have we got? A republic or a monarchy? To which he
[02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:18.600]  responded, a republic if you can keep it. But today not only have we lost a
[02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:22.240]  republic but most people don't even know what a republic even is. For one thing a
[02:30:22.240 --> 02:30:26.240]  republic is not a democracy. A republic operates under the rule of law which
[02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:29.520]  protects individual liberties so that the majority cannot take away the rights
[02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:32.840]  of the minority. Under a republic the government and its citizens all abide by
[02:30:32.840 --> 02:30:36.640]  the same laws regardless of political power or lack thereof. Democracy on the
[02:30:36.640 --> 02:30:39.720]  other hand only leads to mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims of the
[02:30:39.720 --> 02:30:43.560]  public. In a democracy the individual or any groups of individuals composing the
[02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:47.120]  minority have no protection against the unlimited power of the majority. It is a
[02:30:47.120 --> 02:30:51.360]  case of majority over man. In other words under democracy two wolves can vote to
[02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:54.480]  eat the sheep for dinner. But under a republic the sheep's right to life is
[02:30:54.480 --> 02:30:59.360]  protected by the rule of law. This is Kit Daniels with infowars.com. For a limited
[02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:04.520]  time info wars select storable foods that are the highest quality longest
[02:31:04.520 --> 02:31:09.040]  lasting produced right here in the US foods are 30 to 40 percent off retail.
[02:31:09.040 --> 02:31:12.360]  Now let me tell you why that's so important. We only do this special twice a
[02:31:12.360 --> 02:31:17.520]  year and we are contractually allowed to offer prices even lower than the prices
[02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:20.840]  that my patron supply offers and that's who produces this food. They're our
[02:31:20.840 --> 02:31:25.800]  sponsor we sell their food infowars store.com. It's incredibly good deal but
[02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:30.840]  right next to it is our food the same food private labeled and it's a contract
[02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:34.960]  loophole where we can offer it lower than anyone else including their other
[02:31:34.960 --> 02:31:39.440]  distributors. I did this because of info wars power in the market to leverage
[02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:44.360]  in free market to bring you the very best deals and quite frankly that helps
[02:31:44.360 --> 02:31:49.600]  us then sell even more food and help fund this operation. So for a limited time

[02:33:19.920 --> 02:33:28.800]  lines of the info war. Rob Dew we're waiting for Roger Stone is getting his
[02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:32.360]  computer came in and he said no yeah no I'll finish the story you forgot part
[02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:35.840]  was better than that when they ended up staying the night I guess they've been
[02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:41.440]  up skiing when he was in Switzerland in one of the armored redoubts. So Rob
[02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:46.680]  briefly we're talking about William Tell the situation going on there in
[02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:50.320]  Switzerland lowest crime rate in the world totally sovereign never invaded
[02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:55.400]  in 400 years all because they had an uprising against basically a nearby
[02:33:55.400 --> 02:33:58.720]  country coming in and taking them over they said never again we're gonna arm
[02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:02.920]  ourselves and they watched tyranny disappear like phantoms at dawn Rob do
[02:34:02.920 --> 02:34:07.720]  that's it that's right Alex and so I stayed in a small village where a ski
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:12.400]  resort was and if we went out at night down to the town we would have to stay
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:16.360]  overnight in it was basically in a basement underneath I'd say a four
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:21.040]  plex there was some apartments on top but you go in it was a giant bomb shelter
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:26.200]  you to open the doors about this thick and they had some beds set up and some
[02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:30.080]  storable food there which you know we just kind of left that alone we used the
[02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:34.480]  beds there was three rooms and then they had a hallway next to that and then
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:38.920]  there was little cages that were locked up and in each cage we was me and my
[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:42.200]  buddy he's we were both from Louisiana so we're you know into hunting and all
[02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:45.320]  that he goes check this out because he had been there a couple weeks before I
[02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:48.680]  was he goes look at this and each one had a machine gun and a helmet I guess a
[02:34:48.680 --> 02:34:55.400]  vest with you know clips or magazines I guess that's the correct term but every
[02:34:55.400 --> 02:34:59.480]  single one of them had one in it and that was and and we asked one of the
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:02.480]  locals what's that for they said well if anybody comes in and tries to attack us
[02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:05.720]  we just go get our guns and are ready to you know we've all gone to the army
[02:35:05.720 --> 02:35:10.960]  everybody goes and serves I think it when they turn 18 at least one or two
[02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:15.080]  years in the army so they can be prepared for civilian defense of
[02:35:15.080 --> 02:35:19.200]  anything's ever gonna happen and that's the best civilian defense is you know
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:22.520]  training people and then sending them back out in the world with their arms so
[02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:26.040]  they can be ready if anything ever happens especially before that maybe a
[02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:30.200]  tax exemption or tax credits to be able to go and have like free training for
[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:32.840]  everybody I don't want to have it organized they'll turn it into social
[02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:36.640]  justice warrior globalism now they're trying to push that but the Swiss model
[02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:40.640]  really is part of where we got our model we should go back to it it's the way to
[02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:43.440]  go and I've talked to families been over there and then in some of their bigger
[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:47.040]  redoubts where you'll have like the local who's in charge of it you go in there
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:51.420]  it's like you know armored vehicles rockets missile launchers I mean they
[02:35:51.420 --> 02:35:55.560]  are ready yeah this was a small village I was in called Sorenberg not you know
[02:35:55.560 --> 02:36:00.240]  they had a grocery store three three bars and a lot of happy Swiss people and
[02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:06.160]  you know no crime that I could see no poverty what you know is interesting
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:08.440]  you were talking about being natural and getting out as I was taking the train
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:13.880]  from Zurich into that area they had little little garden houses alongside
[02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:17.760]  where people would go on the weekends and garden and do things out in nature so
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:20.840]  they had those all along and I thought that was really interesting that you
[02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:24.120]  know we don't really have anything like that here in this country you know people
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:27.840]  I guess go out to their camps or whatnot but everybody had these set up and it
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:30.080]  was just their little plot of land where they can garden they they were all
[02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:33.520]  beautiful it looks like little hobbit houses just on this you know right next
[02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:38.040]  to the train tracks well we're gonna be focusing more on this big study out we
[02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:44.760]  have stone yet almost a big study out by psychology posts this is out of the
[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:49.640]  environmental and behavior journal big study that just walking in the woods a
[02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:53.480]  little bit makes you happy releases a lot of key chemicals in your brain lower
[02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:57.840]  stress just it's amazing and look the globalists know this that's why they're
[02:36:57.840 --> 02:37:01.400]  trying to keep us from doing this it's total control we're here to expose it
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:04.800]  it's that simple what we're bringing back is not rocket science folks this is
[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:09.620]  normal human activity this broadcast okay thanks Rob did yep appreciate that

[02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:55.120]  joins us he doesn't normally come on it once a week a very very busy man but he
[02:38:55.120 --> 02:38:59.400]  has traveled to New York to ferret out more info to find out the campaign what's
[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:04.600]  going on the devastating victory for populism and nationalism in Indiana a
[02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:09.000]  few days ago the Bush is coming out saying they won't endorse him wow that
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:12.400]  be like Satan saying they won't endorse him all these wonderful things
[02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:17.520]  happening such an exciting time right now Donald Trump doubling down saying
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:23.120]  Britain should leave the EU promising to not shut off our coal mines saying he'll
[02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:28.400]  repeal Obamacare I've never been more proud of supporting Donald Trump we're
[02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:32.600]  gonna cover all the latest developments he says some big breaking bombs he's
[02:39:32.600 --> 02:39:37.120]  gonna drop right now we'll also ask about a report I got from other insiders
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:41.160]  that we know in the campaign that without Trump knowing they may have snuck
[02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:44.360]  in a guy connected to Goldman Sachs but who isn't connected to Goldman Sachs when
[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:48.560]  it comes to finance we're gonna look at that as well with Roger Stone of Stop
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:53.280]  Steel dot org and congratulations everybody they may still try to steal it
[02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:58.760]  but that's now a very remote option I'd say maybe five percent chance when they
[02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:03.320]  were guaranteed to do it he was the first guy 11 months ago on the show with
[02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:07.040]  Richard Reeves Roger Stone was raised the alarm because you got organized because
[02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:10.720]  you got involved because you pointed out it was wrong to do the arrogant
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:14.360]  premises of the world have now been backed into a corner but the fight is
[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:19.880]  continuing let's now go to Roger Stone with breaking Intel thank you sir for
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:24.040]  joining us in your busy schedule on this Friday Alex I'm delighted to be here it
[02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:29.840]  is a it's a whirlwind day it is incredible to me to watch the mainstream
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:36.600]  media continue to focus on the never Trump group a handful of people less than
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:41.240]  10% of the Republican Party and then they completely missed the story of the
[02:40:41.240 --> 02:40:47.960]  millions of new voters new donors new workers people who've never been involved
[02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:54.840]  in the process before who are flocking to the Trump banner you know I was
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:59.560]  fortunate to speak to Donald today and you know those conversations are private
[02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:05.920]  and proprietary but I must tell you he is really pumped up he is really excited
[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:10.880]  he had a phenomenal crowd in West Virginia yesterday now he makes a very
[02:41:10.880 --> 02:41:15.840]  good point the West Virginia primary is over the nomination phase is over and
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:20.800]  still there are thousands of people turning out to give voice to this
[02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:25.760]  revolution so I have never seen anything like this in the 40 years that I have
[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:32.520]  been involved in American politics Alex this is a Trump is a force of nature he
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:39.400]  is an unabashed nationalist he believes in America in terms of sovereignty and
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:46.040]  American power and I have concluded after yesterday that while he is more
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:51.040]  than happy to take money from Wall Street while he is more than happy to
[02:41:51.040 --> 02:41:55.640]  recognize that Wall Street will play both sides of the street that they'll
[02:41:55.640 --> 02:42:02.640]  fund Hillary at the same time they fund Trump Trump is a bubble a businessman he
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:07.720]  would be foolish to turn down that money but given that I have known him for
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:13.600]  almost 40 years anybody who thinks Donald Trump can be bought is killing is
[02:42:13.600 --> 02:42:19.880]  kidding themselves he is his own man his views have been set for 30 years on
[02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:27.240]  trade on immigration on our absurd fiscal policies he is still absolutely I
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:34.000]  think in the camp of those who recognize the country needs radical reform and
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:37.960]  you're not going to get it from the current two-party leadership Roger Stone
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:42.320]  you said it the populism the almost three million new voters coming in even
[02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:46.480]  better than Reagan at this point they are so scared of his populism they've
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:49.880]  lied about him every step of the way they've been proven totally wrong and
[02:42:49.880 --> 02:42:53.400]  now these arrogant people that ran the Republican Party in the ground that
[02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:58.840]  launched all these evil wars they tell us that they say we can't have him what
[02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:02.920]  an arrogant group and look at how their attempt to steal blew up in their face
[02:43:02.920 --> 02:43:10.320]  that con game didn't go well I smell the death politically of the hijackers of
[02:43:10.320 --> 02:43:14.080]  the Republican Party Beck and others are trying to say he spells the death of
[02:43:14.080 --> 02:43:20.320]  the party no Trump and populism spells the resurrection of it in my view the
[02:43:20.320 --> 02:43:24.960]  smart people in the Republican Party have recognized millions were coming to
[02:43:24.960 --> 02:43:31.360]  our banner there have been nine million people have voted for Donald Trump for
[02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:36.200]  the Republican nomination that is the largest number of voters ever garnered
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:40.720]  by any Republican nominee for president in history including the great Ronald
[02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:49.680]  Reagan this is this is a groundswell and I think it is interesting that that
[02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:56.840]  speaker Ryan allows today that he may not support Trump the manifestation of
[02:43:56.840 --> 02:44:02.240]  that which I can report directly is Alex there's an insurrection today in the
[02:44:02.240 --> 02:44:07.200]  house among the back benchers who want to support Trump we're trying to figure
[02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:11.960]  out what's wrong with their leader Trump was fielding phone calls from
[02:44:11.960 --> 02:44:18.400]  congressmen all morning who are coming on board who are who want Trump to visit
[02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:23.800]  their districts and their states and who are turbo charge them all but Ryan and
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:29.320]  the rhinos do not want access to the other Republicans of this superstar
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:33.360]  because Trump with populism and the libertarians could take the whole party
[02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:41.200]  over oh what a dream yeah I mean one major plus today as you know George Bush
[02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:48.080]  43 and born George Bush 41 announcing that they will not support Trump this
[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:53.760]  idea is a major plus those are two failed presidencies George W. Bush crashed
[02:44:53.760 --> 02:45:00.400]  our economy and wasted money and blood on a pointless war in which America's
[02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:04.600]  new world order minions let me ask you this then what are the threats that
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:08.240]  listeners should be aware of what should we do to continue moving this forward
[02:45:08.240 --> 02:45:11.800]  what do you expect Hillary to do you know what's the next hurdles to get over
[02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:16.480]  here well let's first let's talk about the convention because I have as I'm
[02:45:16.480 --> 02:45:21.680]  sure you have Alex been contract contacted by many patriots who are
[02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:26.440]  saying are you sure we should stand down are you sure we aren't going to be
[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:33.940]  subject to some sneak attack by Ted Cruz and his Bush family patrons Mitt
[02:45:33.940 --> 02:45:40.240]  Romney Paul Ryan Paul Singer and the rest of the answer is let me guess do not
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:45.480]  stand down there's a sneak attack will be sorrows people trying to dominate and
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:49.440]  control when you totally overwhelm them with Patriot numbers as a show of
[02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:54.120]  support is that a good statement that is exactly right and I spoke to the
[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:59.640]  organizers of what was the stop the steel rally which is now going to become a
[02:45:59.640 --> 02:46:05.280]  unity and victory rally and Alex they're very very excited about your
[02:46:05.280 --> 02:46:10.560]  speaking there in Cleveland and there's no evidence that the groundswell of
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:14.360]  people coming to Cleveland has been abated oh no this is where we're going
[02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:18.120]  to face the goblins of sorrows that more than ever folks now that he has
[02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:22.360]  clearly dominated ahead of time your numbers need to be bigger in my gut
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:28.480]  level analysis now more than ever it's certainly possible and I think it's
[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:33.720]  important for patriots to show up and to turn out let's take nothing for granted
[02:46:33.720 --> 02:46:39.960]  now I do think based on meetings I was in today that the key committees of the
[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:46.280]  convention rules credentials platform are going to fall into the hands of the
[02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:51.600]  Trump operation I think it gets harder and harder to pull some back room steel
[02:46:51.600 --> 02:46:56.120]  the platform now becomes more important because we want that to be a
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:47:02.680]  nationalist document that reflects the views of Donald Trump not a neocon
[02:47:02.680 --> 02:47:09.940]  document that represents the failed policies of the bushes beautiful what
[02:47:09.940 --> 02:47:15.760]  about VP so many folks are saying get the governor of the former governor of
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:19.120]  Oklahoma who's a woman I'm not for gimmicks but she's a great lady wouldn't
[02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:24.960]  that be a good coup against Hillary's you know female vote claim well you know
[02:47:24.960 --> 02:47:29.240]  once one thing that president Richard Nixon once told me was when looking for
[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:34.160]  a running mate don't try to find somebody who can help you you'd be lucky to
[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:38.560]  find somebody who doesn't hurt you that is of course ironic in view of the fact
[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:43.120]  that both of the running mates that he chose Spiro Agnew and Henry Cabot Lodge
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:49.760]  turned out to be disasters that hurt him in the 68 in the 1960 campaigns I think
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:55.560]  you can get too clever here the good news is that that Donald Trump without the
[02:47:55.560 --> 02:48:01.680]  prospect of a contested convention has much much broader latitude in who he
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:07.880]  chooses he doesn't have to go check the boxes pick a woman pick a Hispanic pick
[02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:13.320]  a career politician and therefore I got the impression and he holds this very
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:17.640]  close to his vest that he is going to look at a broad cross-section of people
[02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:24.200]  that perhaps we haven't considered yet now you do have to be cognizant of the
[02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:29.160]  need for vetting the only advantage of taking somebody who has run for
[02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:35.040]  president in the most recent cycle a John Kasich a Marco Rubio is that they're
[02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:39.280]  fully vetted I really don't get the impression that that is where he's
[02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:43.320]  headed so when you say because why I'm salivating here for the exclusiveness of
[02:48:43.320 --> 02:48:46.840]  this when you say he's looking into a section no one ever looked into is that
[02:48:46.840 --> 02:48:51.000]  military is that industry I mean please tell us what that section is well I
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:55.480]  think it could be military because when he said I want somebody from the
[02:48:55.480 --> 02:48:59.360]  political system I think what he actually meant was I need somebody who
[02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:03.520]  knows how the government runs that didn't necessarily mean an elected
[02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:09.120]  politician so it could be somebody from the military I think that the Trump is
[02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:14.880]  very very shrewd he understands that two business people on a ticket with with
[02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:19.440]  no government experience is probably not the best prescription for government
[02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:25.160]  and he wants somebody sure can navigate the walls of government to implement his
[02:49:25.160 --> 02:49:29.160]  program over the objections are isn't Chris Christie geographically too close
[02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:34.800]  though I don't I think Chris Christie is would be the wrong choice for a couple
[02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:38.880]  reasons first of all the George Washington Bridge scandal is probably not
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:43.200]  over the people charged in that scandal we're gonna go to trial shortly there's
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:48.760]  also a very significant civil trial and it remains to be seen until those two
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:53.600]  trials are over what Chris Christie's vulnerabilities may or may not be
[02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:59.400]  geographically it doesn't make sense I think it would send the wrong signal I
[02:49:59.400 --> 02:50:04.000]  think Trump is thinking much broader than that now we could all be surprised
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:08.680]  only he is going to make this choice he's not a man who tips his hand in
[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:13.240]  advance but I think he's looking at a broad cross-section of people not
[02:50:13.240 --> 02:50:18.640]  necessarily elected politicians well if I had to give Trump advice I would
[02:50:18.640 --> 02:50:23.720]  tell him go into areas where the social justice warriors are attacking that
[02:50:23.720 --> 02:50:28.200]  continues to discredit them and to go where folks are waving foreign flags and
[02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:32.800]  screaming you know kill Donald Trump I mean undoubtedly our footage and other
[02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:36.340]  people's footage of that I think pushed him way over the edge to have the
[02:50:36.340 --> 02:50:40.160]  communist Chinese and the Pope and all these foreigners just screaming and
[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:44.280]  yelling and telling us what to do and our own president telling the UK you've
[02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:49.200]  got to stay in the EU I mean people are sick of our countries being run by
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:54.320]  outside interest well I also have to tell you that a major concern for the
[02:50:54.320 --> 02:50:58.960]  overall Trump campaign is of course that Hillary has a well-oiled financial
[02:50:58.960 --> 02:51:04.160]  machine she is drowning in Soros money and other illicit and in some cases
[02:51:04.160 --> 02:51:09.160]  illegal money and Trump has run a completely grassroots campaign that as
[02:51:09.160 --> 02:51:14.640]  you know he's largely funded out of his own wallet so they must very quickly
[02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:20.720]  ramp up a financing operation now there's even more news about this group the
[02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:26.860]  great America pack and I want to warn Trump financial donors and those who
[02:51:26.860 --> 02:51:34.480]  want to help this pack is a scam yesterday Jesse Benton former aid to
[02:51:34.480 --> 02:51:41.320]  Ron Paul and Rand Paul was convicted of bribery in Iowa for bribing voters and
[02:51:41.320 --> 02:51:44.880]  bribing elected officials well I didn't know that he was convicted he was
[02:51:44.880 --> 02:51:48.240]  convicted you can find that in the Washington Post well he's involved in
[02:51:48.240 --> 02:51:55.840]  this well and I can and Rollins who recently signed on your viewers may not
[02:51:55.840 --> 02:52:03.280]  know this but his daytime job is working for Tanao Tanao is the bill in
[02:52:03.280 --> 02:52:10.000]  Hillary connected lobbying for how run by Doug van who is you know essentially
[02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:15.240]  Bill Clinton's bad man so the chairwoman of this organization the great
[02:52:15.240 --> 02:52:22.080]  America pack Amy Kramer resigned today over what she said were financial
[02:52:22.080 --> 02:52:26.720]  shenanigans and the fact that I know you've been criticizing it for weeks and
[02:52:26.720 --> 02:52:30.680]  Trump's people have so so that looks to be sinking now I know Trump doesn't do
[02:52:30.680 --> 02:52:34.680]  real packs he needs some to protect himself you've done want to promote free
[02:52:34.680 --> 02:52:38.720]  speech not really a pack but so where do people support Trump's by the the ball
[02:52:38.720 --> 02:52:43.160]  capture well it look it remains to be seen this morning he gave an interview
[02:52:43.160 --> 02:52:48.080]  in which he basically conceded super packs are a necessary evil and that he
[02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:51.680]  has a lot of people out there that want to support him and that he really can't
[02:52:51.680 --> 02:52:57.480]  tell them what to do to me that means that that individual citizens need to
[02:52:57.480 --> 02:53:02.720]  move forward and act so simple if you like sovereignty if you like lower taxes
[02:53:02.720 --> 02:53:06.880]  if you like getting off the coal mines back if you like cheaper energy if you
[02:53:06.880 --> 02:53:10.280]  want to put America first or at least on the equal playing field support Trump
[02:53:10.280 --> 02:53:13.480]  and he says I'm gonna do whatever I'm gonna do as long as he doesn't go back
[02:53:13.480 --> 02:53:19.480]  on his pledges I don't see that as an issue rock solid Alex rock solid
[02:53:19.480 --> 02:53:26.040]  Donald Trump is not going to abandon Trump is anybody on Wall Street who
[02:53:26.040 --> 02:53:29.960]  thinks that Trump can be bought or no no that's why they're so scared of them I
[02:53:29.960 --> 02:53:32.800]  get it they're they're more scared than ever so let me ask you this then what
[02:53:32.800 --> 02:53:35.400]  about the story I called you yesterday you were going to New York you didn't
[02:53:35.400 --> 02:53:38.560]  know yet but I have my sources and I looked it up the guys connected to
[02:53:38.560 --> 02:53:42.200]  Goldman Sachs the Koch brothers George Soros man I know when you get in
[02:53:42.200 --> 02:53:45.160]  politics they're all connected to it and Trump's never has been that's why he's
[02:53:45.160 --> 02:53:48.480]  such an outsider but what about this new finance head you weren't sure at the time
[02:53:48.480 --> 02:53:53.120]  an hour later it turned out that was his new finance had exclusive Koch Soros
[02:53:53.120 --> 02:53:56.440]  insiders attempt to take over Trump campaign do you know anything about this
[02:53:56.440 --> 02:54:02.240]  well I learned about it as you did but as I say now that I have been over to
[02:54:02.240 --> 02:54:06.600]  Trump Tower and had a number of conversations I'm entirely comfortable
[02:54:06.600 --> 02:54:10.800]  Trump is using them they're not using him Trump is going to take the Wall
[02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:14.760]  Street money but if the boys on Wall Street think they're buying anything they
[02:54:14.760 --> 02:54:19.680]  don't understand Donald Trump he is not a guy you can buy so hedge fund
[02:54:19.680 --> 02:54:23.840]  managers are going to pay a higher tax rate Alex he's not going to give up his
[02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:27.200]  opposition to the that's why he's so mad at him because they've already had it
[02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:31.080]  basically tax exempt with this with this Irish shuffle or whatever that stuff is
[02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:35.120]  where they go offshore I mean that is fair they pay taxes if they mean yeah
[02:54:35.120 --> 02:54:40.000]  well and the treatment of carried interest for the hedge fund donors these
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:47.200]  guys gave Jeb Bush $100 million to stop Trump and they failed and in the end Jeb
[02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:52.360]  Bush ended up emulating Donald Trump's position on how hedge fund managers
[02:54:52.360 --> 02:54:56.440]  should be taxed that is great irony I've never seen them not give to both sides
[02:54:56.440 --> 02:55:00.240]  I mean and now if they get forced to go give to Trump that is going to be sick
[02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:05.880]  you know the great part is they think they're conning him he's conning them
[02:55:05.880 --> 02:55:09.880]  Donald Trump can't be conned he's too smart for that so you talked to him and
[02:55:09.880 --> 02:55:12.960]  he said yeah I've got some of the best managers I'm gonna open the floodgates
[02:55:12.960 --> 02:55:15.840]  up but he's not even look at the donations then there's gonna pour in he's
[02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:20.240]  gonna use them yeah I don't think he has any choice we're up against a multi
[02:55:20.240 --> 02:55:24.880]  billion dollar effort by Hillary and Bill Clinton and there and there are
[02:55:24.880 --> 02:55:30.120]  many financial tentacles so I think he has to operate within the law he's
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:35.080]  going to have to take campaign funds which now by the way all go to the
[02:55:35.080 --> 02:55:39.520]  Republican Party they all go to the victory fund but any special interest
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:44.080]  who thinks you can buy a piece of Donald Trump by donating they're gonna be very
[02:55:44.080 --> 02:55:47.480]  very I was about to say what about that problem with the leadership still saying
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:50.680]  they want to kill you know kill them politically and then money people give
[02:55:50.680 --> 02:55:57.640]  go to them I mean Paul Ryan just I'm so sick of him yeah I agree we've only got
[02:55:57.640 --> 02:56:00.520]  we've only got two minutes left I appreciate you popping in with us and
[02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:04.160]  giving us these exclusives what are the other bombshells any other big Ted
[02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:10.280]  Betts mr. Stone well it's interesting that new polling we have looked at shows
[02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:15.400]  that the gap between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump just within the last
[02:56:15.400 --> 02:56:21.200]  week has closed to single digits so the mainstream media claimed that Trump is
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:25.840]  hopelessly behind you can't possibly make up this ground that narrative is
[02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:31.260]  entirely false supporters of Trump patriots free thinkers don't be
[02:56:31.260 --> 02:56:36.560]  daunted by these by these poll numbers Trump is well in range and he has gained
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:41.880]  substantially since the Indiana primary so I'm more bullish than ever here's the
[02:56:41.880 --> 02:56:46.000]  things I like the polling that I have looked at Trump is running
[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:50.880]  substantially ahead of where Romney and McCain ran among Africa but if he attacks
[02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:55.400]  her she's weak it'll destroy her no one ever does ask her I don't think we have
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:56:59.520]  to worry about that whatsoever Donald Trump completely understands your great
[02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:04.880]  vulnerabilities her abuse of women her disastrous tenure as Secretary of State
[02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:10.240]  and I see that's going Benghazi the whole the entire opposing of Gaddafi and
[02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:16.440]  Libya and then then there's the the Clinton Foundation a flush fund for
[02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:20.240]  grifters sure when you talk to him though I would caution him people know she was
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:23.800]  with Obama and they created him to a certain extent go after fast and furious
[02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:27.720]  go after IRS persecution just hit her with everything it's all her fault the
[02:57:27.720 --> 02:57:32.840]  derivatives the scams of the 90s destroy them just hit her on every front bring
[02:57:32.840 --> 02:57:36.960]  her down and I tell you it's good news the FBI is getting closer to her what's
[02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:40.920]  your word on that I mean they're talking to all her girlfriends right now yeah I
[02:57:40.920 --> 02:57:46.160]  mean the real question here is do Huma Abedin and and Cheryl Mills take the
[02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:49.880]  fall now if you listen to Hillary's operation they'll tell you she's not
[02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:55.160]  even under investigation that we must be delusional when my friend judge Napolitano
[02:57:55.160 --> 02:58:00.080]  who is a great fan of yours Alex goes on and lays this out the clowns that media
[02:58:00.080 --> 02:58:04.360]  matters for America insist that she's not even our investigation what what
[02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:08.280]  planet do these fellows live on so you know I think justice is going to be
[02:58:08.280 --> 02:58:12.440]  served one way or another and that's a steamer trunk on her back let me just
[02:58:12.440 --> 02:58:17.480]  say this Trump completely understands her vulnerabilities he knows that he has
[02:58:17.480 --> 02:58:22.160]  gotten embarrassment of riches when it comes to issues that he can raise about

[03:00:48.280 --> 03:00:52.720]  that you know I covered a lot of the news today I didn't get to some of it but
[03:00:52.720 --> 03:00:56.840]  I'll tell you this whole thing with Paul Ryan
[03:00:56.840 --> 03:01:05.440]  uh-huh sorry I'm singing along with the song Paul Ryan how Ryan decided to ditch
[03:01:05.440 --> 03:01:11.240]  Trump Politico and Paul Ryan's not gonna support him and Bush didn't gonna
[03:01:11.240 --> 03:01:14.240]  support him and Bush senior isn't gonna support him everybody knows I love Ron
[03:01:14.240 --> 03:01:18.240]  Poland I get his purest views so I respect him saying he doesn't support
[03:01:18.240 --> 03:01:22.240]  Trump because of some of the policies Trump stands for that I disagree with as
[03:01:22.240 --> 03:01:26.240]  well just for integrity and elections and the fact the power structure is totally
[03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:30.240]  against him I really do think Ron Paul should come out and just for the
[03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:34.240]  populist views to audit the Federal Reserve say I support Trump on these
[03:01:34.240 --> 03:01:38.240]  points and just have basically limited endorsement
[03:01:38.240 --> 03:01:43.240]  that would be so good for Ron Paul to do I understand if Trump goes sideways on
[03:01:43.240 --> 03:01:48.240]  his thing sale Ron Paul wasn't perfect nobody's perfect people but we're in
[03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:54.240]  the arena here this is death battle with the globalist Trump is only exposing
[03:01:54.240 --> 03:01:59.240]  tyranny anti-nationalist garbage globalist garbage and then if he goes
[03:01:59.240 --> 03:02:05.240]  sideways on us we throw in the ditch like an old shoe he's only popular
[03:02:05.240 --> 03:02:09.240]  because he's promoting things that are common sense that have been shuttered
[03:02:09.240 --> 03:02:17.240]  and demonized and ignored and bastardized the the tyrants hate his guts
[03:02:17.240 --> 03:02:21.240]  because of what he's saying someone at that stature with this level of media
[03:02:21.240 --> 03:02:32.240]  coverage it is coffin nails to their agenda it is unprecedented on so many
[03:02:32.240 --> 03:02:39.240]  fronts and that's all I'm saying it is a great time to be alive when the EU
[03:02:39.240 --> 03:02:45.240]  unelected bureaucracy wants to find the citizens a quarter million euros that's
[03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:48.240]  what the government's have to pay if they don't take in an unvetted refugee
[03:02:48.240 --> 03:02:53.240]  from some war-torn hellhole in an old part of the plan to vulcanize Europe
[03:02:53.240 --> 03:02:58.240]  meanwhile this is in Breitbart 27 lawmakers warn Obama against transferring
[03:02:58.240 --> 03:03:02.240]  impacts he already did too late to Syrian rebels Jerusalem on Wednesday
[03:03:02.240 --> 03:03:08.240]  representative John Conyers and representative Ted Yoho Yoho Yoho
[03:03:08.240 --> 03:03:14.240]  it's off to work we go sorry that's no white and 25 other members of
[03:03:14.240 --> 03:03:19.240]  Congress sent a bipartisan letter to President Obama stating their
[03:03:19.240 --> 03:03:24.240]  opposition to the transfer of man portable air-conditioning
[03:03:24.240 --> 03:03:29.240]  systems to the Syrian rebels they've already been transferring the letter
[03:03:29.240 --> 03:03:34.240]  was direct response to Wall Street Journal article last month reporting on
[03:03:34.240 --> 03:03:38.240]  CIA plans to possibly aren't moderate Syrian rebels with more advanced
[03:03:38.240 --> 03:03:43.240]  weaponry they already did it and they already got them and they've already
[03:03:43.240 --> 03:03:47.240]  been shooting down Syrian aircraft and Russian aircraft but the Russians
[03:03:47.240 --> 03:03:52.240]  have got flares and other stuff that defeats it and they've already
[03:03:52.240 --> 03:03:56.240]  got flares and other stuff that defeats it so they want to move in even
[03:03:56.240 --> 03:04:00.240]  beggar systems they tried to cover this four or five months remember the
[03:04:00.240 --> 03:04:05.240]  headline was like somehow ISIS built stinger missiles aren't they geniuses

[03:08:06.240 --> 03:08:25.240]  welcome to the fourth hour of the alex jones radio show i'm david night and we're gonna be taking your calls this hour because i'd like to get some of your feedback on what's developing in the aftermath of trump being the presumptive nominee and as we see the
[03:08:25.240 --> 03:08:41.240]  elite hardening its position the number is 800 259 9231 that's 800 259 9231 before we get into the news i want to pass on something that could be very very valuable to you if you've just been given a pain
[03:08:41.240 --> 03:08:57.240]  prescription this is a very in-depth report from the elite times i haven't had time to read the entire thing this is like 30 pages printed out folks they go into a very in-depth investigation of oxycontin and a lot of people have become addicted
[03:08:57.240 --> 03:09:14.240]  a lot of people have died we had chris christie talk about the most successful guy in his law school class the guy with a lot of charisma success became a partner he lost everything because he got addicted to pain killing drugs as he injured his back as a jogger
[03:09:14.240 --> 03:09:38.240]  here's the title if you want a description of you want a description of hell oxycontin's 12 hour problem and here's the gist of it perdu farmer they point out launched oxycontin two decades ago with a bold marketing claim they said one dose release pain for 12 hours more than twice as long as other generic medications patients would no longer have to wake up in the middle of the night to take their
[03:09:38.240 --> 03:09:56.240]  pills now they say the stunning success that they had with oxycontin masks a fundamental problem for some people it doesn't last for 12 hours some people have a different reaction to this drug and of course it's a chemical cousin of heroin it's an opiate
[03:09:56.240 --> 03:10:15.240]  and when it doesn't last they say patients can experience excruciating symptoms withdrawal including an intense craving for the drug and they say the identification of this problem offers new insight and why so many people have become addicted to oxycontin one of the most abused
[03:10:15.240 --> 03:10:34.240]  pharmaceuticals in US history so whenever somebody prescribes a drug for you to do some research for whatever it is okay especially if it's a prescription drug by the pharmaceutical companies because the doctors hand these things out like candy and they will assure you oh yeah they're fine
[03:10:34.240 --> 03:10:51.240]  because typically what they do is they just read the literature from the drug companies do your own research you need to be your second opinion so one of the first places you need to start is if you or a loved one in your family has been prescribed oxycontin
[03:10:51.240 --> 03:11:06.240]  go take a look at this LA Times story it's a very in depth article I'm not going to go into all the details of it I just gave you the gist of it for some people it doesn't last that long and for those people for whom it doesn't last as long they get higher highs and deeper
[03:11:06.240 --> 03:11:29.240]  truss okay and that creates the cycle of addiction that ultimately ends in death for so many people either a drug overdose or a suicide after they have lost everything they can't function in society as Chris Christie talked about it's when we look at the drug situation I look at the DEA and the FDA
[03:11:29.240 --> 03:11:44.240]  the question is where does the federal government get the authority for this please tell me and I'll keep mentioning this I know some of you who listen are getting tired of this but I don't ever hear anybody agreeing or disagreeing with me there's just crickets
[03:11:44.240 --> 03:11:55.240]  it's like we had an amendment to the Constitution so they could prohibit alcohol and we had another one to undo that amendment where is the amendment for them to prohibit anything including prescription drugs
[03:11:55.240 --> 03:12:07.240]  why should that be a federal law that I need to have a doctor prescribe this stuff for me it used to be that way in America prior to the early 20th century you could go into a drugstore you could get anything
[03:12:07.240 --> 03:12:26.240]  they put cocaine and soda pop okay that's where Coca-Cola comes from coke so where do we have the constitutional authority for that states can do it we have states that have still have laws restricting the use of alcohol when you can purchase it that sort of thing
[03:12:26.240 --> 03:12:39.240]  you can debate that at your state level as to whether or not you think that's a good thing or not there is no rationale there is no constitutional basis for the federal government prohibiting anything folks
[03:12:39.240 --> 03:12:46.240]  and if they're going to do it they need a constitutional amendment like they did for alcohol and if they don't and until they do
[03:12:46.240 --> 03:12:59.240]  then all this talk that we hear from conservatives about following behind the Constitution we see this from the never Trump people is like well he needs to say where he is on the Constitution it's like you guys are a bunch of frauds
[03:12:59.240 --> 03:13:13.240]  okay you've supported the war on drugs for decades for over 40 years and understand conservatives conservative voters because maybe the politicians understand this it was a UN agenda that they are enforcing
[03:13:13.240 --> 03:13:24.240]  and we look at other issues like this here this situation with the pissing contest between the trainees and and other people over the bathrooms okay now the feds are getting involved in it
[03:13:24.240 --> 03:13:39.240]  now we've got the Department of Justice threatening to withhold federal funding for school systems especially university systems under Title IX in North Carolina they've just received a threatening letter from the feds
[03:13:39.240 --> 03:13:53.240]  this is the Tranny Tierney I think we're going to start calling these people the gay KK because that's the way they operate alright this is the situation that should be decided by the people of state you don't like it don't go to North Carolina
[03:13:53.240 --> 03:14:07.240]  stay in New York stay in California where you can do whatever you want to with your bathrooms okay but this is not a federal issue and it just shows how the government can use the money that they print with a fed to black male people
[03:14:07.240 --> 03:14:21.240]  let's talk about getting hooked on a drug all the state governments are hooked on federal funding like some people are hooked on Oxycontin okay it gives them this feeling of euphoria but then they hold a gun to their heads because there's strings attached to this
[03:14:21.240 --> 03:14:34.240]  now the governor is saying this is just one interpretation by one agency and here's a statement from the lieutenant governor in North Carolina Dan Forest he says to use our children and their educational futures as pawns in order to advance an agenda
[03:14:34.240 --> 03:14:46.240]  to ultimately open up those same children to exploitation at the hands of sexual predators is by far the sickest example of the depths the Obama administration will stoop to fundamentally transform our nation quote unquote
[03:14:46.240 --> 03:15:01.240]  what I see missing here is any understanding of the 9th and 10th amendment he should be saying where do you have the authority to dictate to us what our bathrooms are going to be like okay this is not a federal issue
[03:15:01.240 --> 03:15:18.240]  and they need to argue it on that basis as we see the election results and as we see people pulling back and talking starting to sink in on the GOP establishment the sudden nomination of Donald Trump being the presumptive nominee
[03:15:18.240 --> 03:15:33.240]  we see Rick Perry now coming out and backing Donald Trump saying he's open to the vice presidency but we've seen both of the Bushes as Alex and Roger Stone were saying in the last hour saying they're not going to endorse Trump they're not going to most likely go to the convention is like great
[03:15:33.240 --> 03:15:44.240]  what could be greater than that well what's even better than that is that Mitt Romney and McCain are probably not going to go either probably not going to endorse this like that's super
[03:15:44.240 --> 03:15:59.240]  because these people should be pariahs to the GOP just like Jimmy Carter was for decades to the Democrats go back a couple of weeks not even a couple of weeks it was April the 26th and this was after
[03:15:59.240 --> 03:16:15.240]  you'd had Donald Trump when all of the states in the Northeast there was six in a row that he won decisively well over 50% close to 60% in all those states and of course Ted Cruz not only lost became in third place and all but one of those states
[03:16:15.240 --> 03:16:30.240]  and we have this guy Stephen Hayes who is an establishment Republican one of the never Trump guys he went to the weekly standard Billy crystals publication again that spelled with an a weekly with an a he said he was having a difficult time after those
[03:16:30.240 --> 03:16:45.240]  northeastern winds and he said they're going to start the GOP elites are going to handle this by looking for a third party candidate if Cruz can't win in Indiana well Cruz didn't win in Indiana he got stomped in Indiana he dropped out
[03:16:45.240 --> 03:17:00.240]  and now what are they doing they're looking for a third party candidate and there's bill crystal with a weekly standard we got an article from curtain demo and info wars dot com saying bill crystal is desperately seeking an establishment insurgent alternative to Trump
[03:17:00.240 --> 03:17:15.240]  somebody that can basically counterpose him and I don't know where he's going to do this is been sass or somebody else are they going to do that at the convention is that still in play they think are they going to try to do this as a third party
[03:17:15.240 --> 03:17:30.240]  because we see now and of course libertarian party is not going to hold their nomination convention until May 30 is been sass going to run down there and jump into the race for the Republican Party we have some other GOP establishment guy go in there
[03:17:30.240 --> 03:17:36.240]  the LP has something that's very valuable they always make sure they get on the ballot in all 50 states.
[03:17:36.240 --> 03:17:43.240]  There's not any other party that has done it to that extent for the number of years that they have done it to my knowledge.
[03:17:43.240 --> 03:17:48.240]  Unfortunately, because this is kind of a task that has been set up for Sisypus.
[03:17:48.240 --> 03:18:03.240]  They, they trying to get on the ballot each time they roll the rock up to the top of the hill and every election cycle that rolls back down because they not only have rules for ballot access that don't apply to the Republicans and Democrats.
[03:18:03.240 --> 03:18:17.240]  But then they also have rules for ballot, ballot retention and so yeah if you don't get to a certain percentage and they set that really high very unrealistically high they do it only for the top races governor and usually and president.
[03:18:17.240 --> 03:18:23.240]  Then you have to start all over again the rock rolls down to the bottom of the hill and you got to push it back up again.
[03:18:23.240 --> 03:18:35.240]  And then of course they're excluded from the debates because after Ross Perot got in the debates they raise the level to 15%. So yeah you can get on the ballot in all 50 states but they still have ways that they control the election process.
[03:18:35.240 --> 03:18:45.240]  Now we see Mary Madeline I thought this is kind of interesting. Many of you may not know who Mary Madeline is she was married to Phyllis I think I don't know I haven't kept up with her social life.
[03:18:45.240 --> 03:18:57.240]  James Carvel who was the kind of called him the red skull of for Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton. He was a campaign manager I think but he was always a spokesperson for the Clintons.
[03:18:57.240 --> 03:19:09.240]  A rabid, rabid Democrat kind of a nasty guy when you watch him on television. Mary Madeline was a Republican she was married to him and so they were this this odd couple.
[03:19:09.240 --> 03:19:17.240]  One of them working for the Bushes Mary Madeline the other one working for the Clintons and now she's saying she has changed her party registration to libertarian.
[03:19:17.240 --> 03:19:30.240]  It's like great you know I've been registered libertarian all my life. I voted a registered Republican to vote in the primary but she's changed her registration to the libertarian party.
[03:19:30.240 --> 03:19:43.240]  I'm not a Republican for a party or for a person really she wasn't a Bush Republican when did she ever and all of these years I've been watching her when did she ever defend liberty or peace.
[03:19:43.240 --> 03:19:54.240]  Always for war always backing up the war on drugs as well domestically here at home and the police surveillance state the whole 9-11 Homeland Security stuff and now she's going libertarian.

[03:24:29.240 --> 03:24:37.240]  What's the matter with the other 43% I mean why would 40% of the people say no not America first.
[03:24:37.240 --> 03:24:48.240]  I mean what position is America supposed to be in when we talk about our foreign policy are we supposed to put how many how many countries come ahead of America's interests for those 40%.
[03:24:48.240 --> 03:24:55.240]  Should we just dissolve America and join the New World Order. What is the problem with America first. I don't really understand.
[03:24:55.240 --> 03:25:00.240]  When people talk to you about that maybe we should talk about this and we'll talk about the next segment.
[03:25:00.240 --> 03:25:06.240]  Talk about a little bit about the history of where that phrase America first has come from because we've had a lot of spin on that.

[03:26:55.240 --> 03:26:58.240]  Alright let's go to Bill in Florida.
[03:26:58.240 --> 03:27:01.240]  Bill you had a comment about Trump cabinet.
[03:27:01.240 --> 03:27:02.240]  Go ahead.
[03:27:02.240 --> 03:27:07.240]  Hello David God bless you and God bless Donald Trump.
[03:27:07.240 --> 03:27:09.240]  Well thank you.
[03:27:09.240 --> 03:27:31.240]  I have a question for you and I was just wondering do you think that there is anywhere in the Trump administration or the Trump cabinet for say Sheriff Joe or Pio or or Andrew Napolitano.
[03:27:31.240 --> 03:27:42.240]  Well I said before I would like to see I'd like to see Judge Napolitano as the Supreme Court pick I would really like to see Judge Napolitano and you know what no other president would do something like that.
[03:27:42.240 --> 03:27:53.240]  Donald Trump would do something like that and whether the criticism and the the mocking that people do judge Napolitano is a serious serious intellectual person.
[03:27:53.240 --> 03:28:01.240]  He understands the Constitution and he would be a serious pick and I really would like to see Judge Napolitano as the Supreme Court pick for Donald Trump.
[03:28:01.240 --> 03:28:07.240]  But of course we've got the never Trump people out there saying oh let's get Merrick Garland in now because Trump might win the presidency.
[03:28:07.240 --> 03:28:18.240]  And it's like this guy who has been consistently against the Second Amendment consistently rubber stamping everything the bureaucracy says that is what these GOP elitists are advocating now.
[03:28:18.240 --> 03:28:20.240]  Who do you think you should put in Bill.
[03:28:20.240 --> 03:28:29.240]  Well I was kind of thinking Judge Napolitano for Vice President.
[03:28:29.240 --> 03:28:31.240]  Yeah I mean that'd be great.
[03:28:31.240 --> 03:28:35.240]  He's going to stand up for the Constitution no matter what.
[03:28:35.240 --> 03:28:36.240]  That'd be great.
[03:28:36.240 --> 03:28:38.240]  Yeah it'd be a great debate or two Whitney.
[03:28:38.240 --> 03:28:47.240]  Yeah and I was thinking maybe Attorney General Sheriff Joe because he's a no nonsense guy and he does his job.
[03:28:47.240 --> 03:28:59.240]  Well it certainly is going to make Sheriff Joe's life easier in terms of the persecution that he's been facing from the Obama administration for trying to protect the people there from the illegals that are coming across the border unvetted.
[03:28:59.240 --> 03:29:05.240]  So there's been a lot of back and forth a lot of direct conflict by the Obama administration.
[03:29:05.240 --> 03:29:11.240]  I think one of the things that that conflict shows us is just how much power a sheriff has.
[03:29:11.240 --> 03:29:20.240]  And that is power that is just laying there for the local communities to try to take back their government to try to have a government that is closer to them.
[03:29:20.240 --> 03:29:23.240]  We can play these games about who he should pick and everything.
[03:29:23.240 --> 03:29:28.240]  Who knows what Donald Trump is going to do with this and that's something that I wouldn't expect him to do for a while.
[03:29:28.240 --> 03:29:32.240]  And he really hasn't gotten the nomination just yet.
[03:29:32.240 --> 03:29:33.240]  He believes that he has.
[03:29:33.240 --> 03:29:37.240]  He told people in West Virginia don't bother showing up in the polls because we've got this sewn up.
[03:29:37.240 --> 03:29:41.240]  I think that might be a mistake. It's not done yet.
[03:29:41.240 --> 03:30:08.240]  Stay with us. Be right back with your phone calls.
[03:30:08.240 --> 03:30:12.240]  I bet you and Franklin was leaving the hall. A lady asked him, well, doctor, what have we got?
[03:30:12.240 --> 03:30:14.240]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:30:14.240 --> 03:30:17.240]  To which he responded, a republic, if you can keep it.
[03:30:17.240 --> 03:30:21.240]  But today, not only have we lost a republic, but most people don't even know what a republic even is.
[03:30:21.240 --> 03:30:24.240]  For one thing, a republic is not a democracy.
[03:30:24.240 --> 03:30:30.240]  A republic operates under the rule of law, which protects individual liberties so that the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority.
[03:30:30.240 --> 03:30:36.240]  Under a republic, the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws regardless of political power or lack thereof.
[03:30:36.240 --> 03:30:40.240]  A democracy, on the other hand, only leads to mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims of the public.
[03:30:40.240 --> 03:30:47.240]  In a democracy, the individual or any groups of individuals composing the minority have no protection against the unlimited power of the majority.
[03:30:47.240 --> 03:30:49.240]  It is a case of majority over man.
[03:30:49.240 --> 03:30:52.240]  In other words, under democracy, two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner.
[03:30:52.240 --> 03:30:56.240]  But under a republic, the sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law.
[03:30:56.240 --> 03:30:58.240]  This is Kit Daniels with infowars.com.
[03:30:58.240 --> 03:31:06.240]  Uh, yeah, first of all, I want to say, take the 12-act two, Superman, Brain Force, Prostigate, Silver Bullet, I use them all.

[03:31:29.240 --> 03:31:31.240]  Why, God, let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[03:31:31.240 --> 03:31:34.240]  They're one of the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[03:31:34.240 --> 03:31:35.240]  What products are you taking?
[03:31:35.240 --> 03:31:41.240]  Everything from, uh, SuperMail to, uh, Brain Force to Winter Sun, uh, X2.
[03:31:41.240 --> 03:31:43.240]  Even got a little, uh, DNA force.
[03:31:43.240 --> 03:31:47.240]  So, and I just re-upped everything and I just went to auto-built.

[03:32:03.240 --> 03:32:07.240]  while you get high quality products and fund the info war, a 360 win.
[03:32:07.240 --> 03:32:14.240]  Number one, when you choose auto-ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarsore.com.
[03:32:14.240 --> 03:32:19.240]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship
[03:32:19.240 --> 03:32:22.240]  because we hold back a surplus for auto-ship customers.
[03:32:22.240 --> 03:32:27.240]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[03:32:27.240 --> 03:32:33.240]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to re-order the products that you need each month.
[03:32:33.240 --> 03:32:38.240]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto-ship
[03:32:38.240 --> 03:32:41.240]  and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[03:32:41.240 --> 03:32:48.240]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto-ship feature at infowarslife.com, this is a sure win.
[03:32:48.240 --> 03:32:50.240]  10% off on auto-ship.
[03:32:50.240 --> 03:32:54.240]  Win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[03:32:54.240 --> 03:33:20.240]  All auto-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[03:33:20.240 --> 03:33:25.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, David Knight, and we're going to go back to your calls in just a moment.
[03:33:25.240 --> 03:33:33.240]  I mentioned briefly in the last segment how 57% of Americans say they agree with the idea of America first.
[03:33:33.240 --> 03:33:40.240]  And I said, what's the matter with the other 40%? What is the problem? Why would America not be first?
[03:33:40.240 --> 03:33:45.240]  Part of that may be the way that many in the media are spinning this term America first.
[03:33:45.240 --> 03:33:51.240]  They're saying, well, this is an idea that's been attached to racism.
[03:33:51.240 --> 03:33:54.240]  And I'm not even going to talk about that part of it.
[03:33:54.240 --> 03:33:57.240]  I want to go back to where the real term came from.
[03:33:57.240 --> 03:34:04.240]  They try to try to racism because they say, well, Charles Lindbergh was there and he had Nazi sympathies.
[03:34:04.240 --> 03:34:08.240]  We can debate whether he had Nazi sympathies or not. It really doesn't matter.
[03:34:08.240 --> 03:34:13.240]  Why wouldn't we put America's economic interests first?
[03:34:13.240 --> 03:34:19.240]  Why wouldn't we have a country that has borders that has to say so about its destiny?
[03:34:19.240 --> 03:34:25.240]  Let's go back and look at where this America first movement was because Charles Lindbergh was just one person.
[03:34:25.240 --> 03:34:28.240]  There were a lot of people. As a matter of fact, it was most of the Republican Party,
[03:34:28.240 --> 03:34:33.240]  the majority view of the Republican Party, that we should not get involved in World War II.
[03:34:33.240 --> 03:34:37.240]  That was the America first people. It wasn't because they hated Jews, okay?
[03:34:37.240 --> 03:34:40.240]  They didn't even know about it. Most of these people, I believe.
[03:34:40.240 --> 03:34:46.240]  Certainly, the public did not know what was going on in the concentration camps when they wanted to stay out of war.
[03:34:46.240 --> 03:34:51.240]  It was a reaction to how they had been betrayed and lied to to get into World War I.
[03:34:51.240 --> 03:34:59.240]  You got to remember, this was only about 20 or so years after Woodrow Wilson had promised he would never get us into a war
[03:34:59.240 --> 03:35:05.240]  and then got us involved in a European war, World War I, that had horrific consequences.
[03:35:05.240 --> 03:35:11.240]  Far more people died there than died in Vietnam. And think about how our country reacted in the aftermath of Vietnam
[03:35:11.240 --> 03:35:18.240]  after we saw how the politicians had betrayed our Americans and used them as cannon fodder,
[03:35:18.240 --> 03:35:22.240]  taking an area and then releasing it back to the enemy and so forth and so on.
[03:35:22.240 --> 03:35:27.240]  Telling us that we had to do this because all of Asia was going to fall to the Chinese communists if we didn't.
[03:35:27.240 --> 03:35:33.240]  And we saw what the aftermath was. And now subsequently, we've seen Robert McNamara confess and say,
[03:35:33.240 --> 03:35:39.240]  well, you know, there never really was a domino issue. We never really did have a Gulf of Tonkin incident.
[03:35:39.240 --> 03:35:44.240]  He said that in a documentary, The Fog of War. You should see that, see what he confesses to.
[03:35:44.240 --> 03:35:50.240]  But going back to World War I and thinking about what happened there, people did not want another World War.
[03:35:50.240 --> 03:35:56.240]  They were drug into World War I against their will, many of them. They realized that this is not what the founders wanted.
[03:35:56.240 --> 03:36:00.240]  They did not want us to get entangled in the continual wars of Europe.
[03:36:00.240 --> 03:36:06.240]  There wasn't a good reason for World War I for anybody, not even the people in Europe, but certainly not for Americans.
[03:36:06.240 --> 03:36:10.240]  And yet you look at the massive casualties that we had as a result of World War I.
[03:36:10.240 --> 03:36:15.240]  So it was a massive betrayal. And one of the ways that Woodrow Wilson got us involved in World War I,
[03:36:15.240 --> 03:36:19.240]  it really fractured the country philosophically.
[03:36:19.240 --> 03:36:26.240]  Prior to that, we had people that we now call libertarians were called liberals because they supported liberty.
[03:36:26.240 --> 03:36:30.240]  These are people who supported economic as well as personal liberty.
[03:36:30.240 --> 03:36:35.240]  And that was fractured by the move to get us into World War I.
[03:36:35.240 --> 03:36:40.240]  Many of the business interests who had advocated economic liberty, free markets within America,
[03:36:40.240 --> 03:36:42.240]  and that's different from free trade that we're talking about, folks.
[03:36:42.240 --> 03:36:49.240]  We have open borders for trade, but we have a lot of barriers to a free market inside the country.
[03:36:49.240 --> 03:36:54.240]  But they supported economic liberty, and then they started supporting the war.
[03:36:54.240 --> 03:37:00.240]  What that did was that caused a fraction, a splitting between people who had identified as liberals.
[03:37:00.240 --> 03:37:04.240]  That's why a lot of libertarians will say, well, I'm a classical liberal.
[03:37:04.240 --> 03:37:10.240]  At that point, we saw this kind of division, which has been really frustrating over the years.
[03:37:10.240 --> 03:37:17.240]  We see oftentimes in the Democrat Party, we've got people who are taking positions of individual liberty, personal liberty,
[03:37:17.240 --> 03:37:20.240]  but they don't like the idea of free markets.
[03:37:20.240 --> 03:37:22.240]  They don't like the idea that you should be able to earn your money.
[03:37:22.240 --> 03:37:30.240]  They want to manage the economy centrally because it was a socialist who sided with them in terms of opposing the war.
[03:37:30.240 --> 03:37:35.240]  Then on the other side, you've got people who say, yeah, we want to have economic freedom,
[03:37:35.240 --> 03:37:40.240]  but then they wanted it in many cases because they wanted to make money off of the war.
[03:37:40.240 --> 03:37:43.240]  And everybody realized the corruption of that.
[03:37:43.240 --> 03:37:49.240]  And so you have these two parties, neither of which really stands for liberty together.
[03:37:49.240 --> 03:37:56.240]  That's why the Libertarian Party came up. That's why we had the Nolan chart where they asked people questions about economic liberty
[03:37:56.240 --> 03:37:59.240]  and about personal liberty and you see how libertarian you are.
[03:37:59.240 --> 03:38:01.240]  We had to come up with a new name because they'd co-opted that.
[03:38:01.240 --> 03:38:06.240]  And it's also interesting if you go back and look at the history, look at the Palmer raids that Woodrow Wilson did.
[03:38:06.240 --> 03:38:09.240]  That was where J. Edgar Hoover got his start, okay?
[03:38:09.240 --> 03:38:16.240]  That was the Department of Justice's Bureau of Investigation, which later became the FBI, which became his little personal fiefdom.
[03:38:16.240 --> 03:38:23.240]  And you had the Palmer raids coming after people saying that they weren't sure about the loyalties of foreigners who were here in this country
[03:38:23.240 --> 03:38:25.240]  or people who had just immigrated.
[03:38:25.240 --> 03:38:28.240]  They were concerned about communists infiltrating.
[03:38:28.240 --> 03:38:35.240]  And there were real concerns there, but for the most part, Wilson did everything he could to engineer us into that war.
[03:38:35.240 --> 03:38:43.240]  As I mentioned before, he passed the Espionage Act that Obama has now used more than any other president to lock up journalists
[03:38:43.240 --> 03:38:50.240]  and people who write opinions. It was Woodrow Wilson who locked up a film producer, gave him, I think it was a five-year sentence.
[03:38:50.240 --> 03:38:56.240]  He served three years of it. He did a movie called The Spirit of 76, which is about our American Revolution.
[03:38:56.240 --> 03:39:01.240]  But because Woodrow Wilson wanted to go into the war on the side of the British, he said, this is anti-British.
[03:39:01.240 --> 03:39:11.240]  And the guy got a $10,000 fine and it was either $10,000 or $5,000 and 10 years or five years in jail.
[03:39:11.240 --> 03:39:18.240]  I can't remember off the top of my head, but the Supreme Court said, no, First Amendment doesn't apply to movies and he's allowed to lock you up.
[03:39:18.240 --> 03:39:23.240]  So these are the background, all these things that happened in World War I.
[03:39:23.240 --> 03:39:28.240]  That was a background to people saying we're not going to get roped into this again 20 years later.
[03:39:28.240 --> 03:39:31.240]  We're going to put America first.
[03:39:31.240 --> 03:39:38.240]  Now, after we fought World War II, after we saw what happened with the Nazis, after we saw what happened with the concentration camps,
[03:39:38.240 --> 03:39:42.240]  Americans are the first to jump into every war.
[03:39:42.240 --> 03:39:49.240]  And in a way, that says something about their character, but they need to be a little bit more discerning.
[03:39:49.240 --> 03:39:54.240]  Because if you go back and you look at our history since World War II, we have been drug into conflict after conflict,
[03:39:54.240 --> 03:39:59.240]  for which we did not need to be drug into, just because we thought we were going to be the saviors of the world.
[03:39:59.240 --> 03:40:07.240]  We need to get over that and we need to go back to America first and say we are not going to be the cannon fodder for these GOP elitists.
[03:40:07.240 --> 03:40:12.240]  Just as we saw Robert Cohen saying, you know, all these people who support Trump, they're a bunch of losers.
[03:40:12.240 --> 03:40:18.240]  They don't have jobs and it isn't because we've sent them, sent their jobs to a foreign country and imported workers.
[03:40:18.240 --> 03:40:21.240]  No, it isn't that. They're just a bunch of losers.
[03:40:21.240 --> 03:40:25.240]  And we called these people cannon fodder and we send them to fight wars in the past.
[03:40:25.240 --> 03:40:27.240]  That's the way they view you.
[03:40:27.240 --> 03:40:31.240]  And that's the casual way in which they enter these wars for profit.
[03:40:31.240 --> 03:40:33.240]  And so we need to be more discerning about that.
[03:40:33.240 --> 03:40:40.240]  There are some fights we should get involved in, but I'd be hard pressed to see one since World War II that we should get involved in.
[03:40:40.240 --> 03:40:44.240]  And I would even have been part of the America First movement during World War II.
[03:40:44.240 --> 03:40:48.240]  And we saw how FDR used the false fight attack of Pearl Harbor.
[03:40:48.240 --> 03:40:52.240]  Not that he was the one bombing Pearl Harbor, but they knew it was coming.
[03:40:52.240 --> 03:40:56.240]  They allowed it to come because they wanted to get us into that war.
[03:40:56.240 --> 03:41:01.240]  Alright, let's go back to your phone calls right now. Antonio in California, go ahead.
[03:41:01.240 --> 03:41:04.240]  Hey, David, how's it going? Nice to speak to you again.
[03:41:04.240 --> 03:41:07.240]  Good to speak to you. Go ahead.
[03:41:07.240 --> 03:41:13.240]  Yeah, so if you'd allow me, I would like to plug your products, but I just wanted to make a quick thing about you.
[03:41:13.240 --> 03:41:15.240]  Sure, what do you use?
[03:41:15.240 --> 03:41:17.240]  What do you like?
[03:41:19.240 --> 03:41:20.240]  Go ahead.
[03:41:20.240 --> 03:41:22.240]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:41:22.240 --> 03:41:31.240]  I use the iodine, the deep cleanse, super male vitality. I just ordered the other one, the Anthroplex.
[03:41:31.240 --> 03:41:40.240]  Good. And we got a 10% discount sale on that. Of course, you always get a 10% sale if you sign up for auto-ship. How are they working for you?
[03:41:40.240 --> 03:41:45.240]  They're working very good. And also, I'm wearing an Apple Wars shirt right now, too.
[03:41:45.240 --> 03:41:52.240]  That's how I met my fiance. I was wearing a 9-11 was inside job shirt. She saw me wearing that. No joke.
[03:41:52.240 --> 03:41:57.240]  She saw me wearing that. She was like, that's true. And from there, now we're engaged.
[03:41:57.240 --> 03:42:00.240]  That's great. That's great.
[03:42:00.240 --> 03:42:07.240]  That's great. So what do you think about Trump? That's super. That is a way that you can find people with like minds and a crowd.
[03:42:07.240 --> 03:42:11.240]  That's a great way to find them. What do you think about Trump, Antonio?
[03:42:11.240 --> 03:42:18.240]  You know, I was a year ago, or less than a year ago, before you started running. I was skeptical.
[03:42:18.240 --> 03:42:23.240]  I even had a friend that she campaigned for over there in Nevada in Reno.
[03:42:23.240 --> 03:42:31.240]  And I told her, I'm like, I don't feel like watching like an apprentice kind of a show. You know, I don't want to celebrity kind of thing.
[03:42:31.240 --> 03:42:41.240]  I was more Ted Cruz, of course, Rand Paul, and then come to find out, you know, she's really connected with within the Republican Party over there in Nevada.
[03:42:41.240 --> 03:42:56.240]  And she was in a campaign for Ted Cruz. And, you know, she ended up telling me, recently, like, I'm glad that, or she's saying that I'm glad that she, you know, that she made that choice to campaign for Donald Trump.
[03:42:56.240 --> 03:43:07.240]  And I was anti that a year ago. And now it's just like, not that he's our savior, and we're not trying to build them up like how all the trendies were like about, you know, Obama, he's gonna save us.
[03:43:07.240 --> 03:43:14.240]  No, I know it's a spiritual war. I know that. But, you know, we can try and do our part, you know, and he says some good things.
[03:43:14.240 --> 03:43:22.240]  Do I agree with everything with him? Just as you don't, or Alex does, or, you know, maybe pull on your staff are probably not going to even vote for him, too.
[03:43:22.240 --> 03:43:28.240]  So it's just like, you know, he's the best we got. Well, you know, no candidate, no candidate is 100%.
[03:43:28.240 --> 03:43:34.240]  And at the very beginning, I was very anti Trump. I really didn't like Donald Trump because to me it looked like a cult of personality.
[03:43:34.240 --> 03:43:38.240]  It looked like everybody was getting behind someone just because he was a celebrity.
[03:43:38.240 --> 03:43:48.240]  But as I began to see his positions come out, his policy statements, even on immigration, even though I didn't agree with every one of the points of his immigration policy, necessarily,
[03:43:48.240 --> 03:43:54.240]  I didn't think that a wall is, and I still am not sure that a wall is really the answer.
[03:43:54.240 --> 03:44:01.240]  I don't want to be walled in as an American in order to not be able to get out of this country. Nevertheless, you know, we can look at the individual aspects of it.
[03:44:01.240 --> 03:44:06.240]  I really appreciated the specificity of it. And I wasn't seeing that from any other candidate.
[03:44:06.240 --> 03:44:12.240]  And then when he came out with some of the policies like how he's going to deal with Obamacare, we've heard just these generalities from these other candidates about,
[03:44:12.240 --> 03:44:22.240]  well, I'm going to repeal and replace it or whatever. But he was very specific, had a seven point plan, showed that he really understood all the different aspects that need to be fixed in our healthcare system.
[03:44:22.240 --> 03:44:26.240]  It isn't that we're going to fix everything by pulling it in and letting Washington manage it.
[03:44:26.240 --> 03:44:35.240]  The problem is we had expensive healthcare and it was getting rapidly more expensive and still is because we don't have any mechanisms to control it.
[03:44:35.240 --> 03:44:37.240]  We don't have any market mechanisms. And so we understand that.
[03:44:37.240 --> 03:44:42.240]  First of all, he's going to get rid of the mandate. He's going to give people a tax incentive if you buy insurance.
[03:44:42.240 --> 03:44:48.240]  So help people instead of giving them penalty if they can't afford to get health insurance.
[03:44:48.240 --> 03:44:57.240]  Then he gives you ownership of health savings accounts. He creates competition by getting rid of the restrictions that we have for different insurance companies competing in different states.
[03:44:57.240 --> 03:45:00.240]  I mean, think about that. We're told that we have to have free trade.
[03:45:00.240 --> 03:45:07.240]  So we need to take down all the trade barriers and ship our factories overseas where they can make it cheap and then ship the products back in.
[03:45:07.240 --> 03:45:12.240]  But we can't have competition with insurance companies between different states.
[03:45:12.240 --> 03:45:18.240]  I mean, how insane is that? America was supposed to be a free trade zone to start with. That's what we set it up with.
[03:45:18.240 --> 03:45:27.240]  And when Thomas Jefferson eliminated all internal taxes, he did it by having tariffs to fund a small constitutional government.
[03:45:27.240 --> 03:45:38.240]  And so now we see these Republicans out there. And as Donald Trump says, well, they're upset with me because I said I would raise taxes in order to control trade here.
[03:45:38.240 --> 03:45:46.240]  We need to go back and understand that when they gave us the income tax, what they did was they sold it partially on the basis of saying we're going to reduce the tariffs.
[03:45:46.240 --> 03:45:50.240]  But we're going to put an income tax there to make it revenue neutral.
[03:45:50.240 --> 03:46:00.240]  We need to also talk to Donald Trump, I think, and say, hey, talk about this, talk about cutting income taxes to compensate for these rise, the rise in tariffs.
[03:46:00.240 --> 03:46:10.240]  I think people would really appreciate that. Make sure that you're not going to overall net raise taxes, but at the very least that you're going to keep the tax burden somewhat the same.
[03:46:10.240 --> 03:46:17.240]  We need to see something like that. And I think Antonio, as we look at this, we're not going to agree with everything that anybody says.
[03:46:17.240 --> 03:46:23.240]  But the real issue, Antonio, is that this comes down to nationalism versus globalism.
[03:46:23.240 --> 03:46:29.240]  And I think Donald Trump is very authentic on that issue. I don't think that he's going to move one way or the other.
[03:46:29.240 --> 03:46:33.240]  And that's what Roger Stone was saying today as well. Do you believe that?
[03:46:33.240 --> 03:46:50.240]  Most definitely. If I had one more thing, I'm Mexican, okay? Born here, born here illegally, I didn't come from over the border. But I have come across a lot of people that obviously are Mexican, like, oh, Donald Trump, he wants to send everybody back.
[03:46:50.240 --> 03:47:07.240]  I've been told that even by, I was born here. He doesn't send me back. If coworkers, I've heard it from everybody, like, are you not actually reading the news? They're just being trendies and just looking at the mainstream media.
[03:47:07.240 --> 03:47:15.240]  Again, he's not our savior. I know that. But listen to what he's saying. Listen to it. Don't be programmed.
[03:47:15.240 --> 03:47:20.240]  That's right. That's right. They're spinning what he's saying, and they're misrepresenting what he's saying, and they did it on the Muslims as well.
[03:47:20.240 --> 03:47:27.240]  Thank you very much, Antonio. I want to get some other callers in here. Let's go to Skits. Skits in Nebraska.
[03:47:27.240 --> 03:47:40.240]  Now, that's where Ben Sasse is. There's been a lot of push by Billy Crystal and others, the weekly standard, who want to see Ben Sasse do something as an independent. What do you think of Ben Sasse?
[03:47:40.240 --> 03:47:59.240]  Hold on, David. I live in the Panhandle in Nebraska, where Ben Sasse represents is everything east of North Platte. So we, you know, personally, I'm not informed on Mr. Sasse, but yeah, to your original question.
[03:47:59.240 --> 03:48:07.240]  One of the first things Donald Trump should do is fire his secret service of detail and hire his own security.
[03:48:07.240 --> 03:48:16.240]  If you just look back in history, it was the secret service that said Kennedy up like a clay pigeon to have him off.
[03:48:16.240 --> 03:48:17.240]  That's true.
[03:48:17.240 --> 03:48:26.240]  Not only that, but secret service is under the Department of Treasury, and the Department of Treasury is intertwined with the Federal Reserve.
[03:48:26.240 --> 03:48:29.240]  Guess who the Federal Reserve is coming back.
[03:48:29.240 --> 03:48:45.240]  Okay, so can you connect more dots? All right. The second thing I would do if I, Mr. Trump, I wouldn't say anything about this. I go on about taxes, but you know what?
[03:48:45.240 --> 03:49:00.240]  I flip the table and say, you know what, Article 1 Section 8 of the Constitution says here, the Congress shall have its Congress's responsibility to coin money and set the value of Federal Reserve. Goodbye.
[03:49:00.240 --> 03:49:01.240]  That's right.
[03:49:01.240 --> 03:49:13.240]  All those trillions of dollars that in Treasury notes, well, hey, China or all these other people, well, go see Mr. Rockefeller about that. That's not our problem.
[03:49:13.240 --> 03:49:19.240]  That's right. That's right. Yeah, you're going to have to, I think, though, as an intermediate step, you're going to have to audit the Fed.
[03:49:19.240 --> 03:49:27.240]  You're going to have to try to educate the public a little bit more because I've even talked to people who were bank managers.
[03:49:27.240 --> 03:49:31.240]  And of course, they call them vice presidents if you manage a local branch of a bank, your vice president.
[03:49:31.240 --> 03:49:35.240]  But he was telling me, oh, they don't have any effect on the economy.
[03:49:35.240 --> 03:49:40.240]  He was absolutely, clearly said, all they do is clear checks because that's all he saw.
[03:49:40.240 --> 03:49:43.240]  What do you think the vast majority of the public think about the Federal Reserve?
[03:49:43.240 --> 03:49:44.240]  They don't realize that it's private.
[03:49:44.240 --> 03:49:54.240]  They don't realize and even think about how if it was just interest rates that they were setting, how that would allow them to have the power to create boom and bust.
[03:49:54.240 --> 03:49:56.240]  If that was all that they were doing.
[03:49:56.240 --> 03:49:59.240]  And so I think we really need to have some kind of an audit the Fed.
[03:49:59.240 --> 03:50:01.240]  I think that's a great place to start.
[03:50:01.240 --> 03:50:10.240]  Clearly, Ron Paul and Rand Paul understand what's going on with the Federal Reserve and I believe that they were wise to start out with an audit the Fed process.
[03:50:10.240 --> 03:50:22.240]  If you do that, if you show the criminality, if you educate people about what's really going on with it, then and we got an article info wars.com 25 fast facts about the Federal Reserve.
[03:50:22.240 --> 03:50:28.240]  Okay, please share with everyone you know, take a look at that article at info wars.com.
[03:50:28.240 --> 03:50:31.240]  And that's what we need to do. We need to start educating people.
[03:50:31.240 --> 03:50:36.240]  But the vast majority of Americans are not going to get educated unless we do an audit of the Fed.
[03:50:36.240 --> 03:50:39.240]  And then at that point, you can start talking about what you're going to do.
[03:50:39.240 --> 03:50:41.240]  I mean, we had Andrew Jackson who stood up to the Fed.
[03:50:41.240 --> 03:50:43.240]  He stood up to the Supreme Court and everything.
[03:50:43.240 --> 03:50:45.240]  He said, well, we're not going to renew their charter.
[03:50:45.240 --> 03:50:47.240]  That was one heck of a fight.
[03:50:47.240 --> 03:50:50.240]  You talk about somebody having a hit put on them.
[03:50:50.240 --> 03:50:54.240]  That's many people believe that's why there was the assassination attempt on Andrew Jackson.
[03:50:54.240 --> 03:50:59.240]  But now the Fed has got a perpetual deal going on.
[03:50:59.240 --> 03:51:01.240]  Are you sneezing, coughing and aching?
[03:51:01.240 --> 03:51:05.240]  Do you have a sore throat, a fever or the sniffles?

[03:58:02.280 --> 03:58:06.520]  says what I want you to do is save your vote save it for the general election okay forget
