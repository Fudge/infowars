[00:00:04.798 --> 00:00:06.119]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:07.880]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.641]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:11.222]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.222 --> 00:00:12.783]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:16.966]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:25.971]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:33.516]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:48.049]  It is the 23rd day of July 2009 on this Thursday edition.
[00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:57.251]  And we are going to be here live for the next four hours.
[00:00:57.251 --> 00:01:00.612]  We have Reverend Ted Pike joining us.
[00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:10.487]  Coming up in an hour and a half to give us the latest on the hate bill and where it is in Congress.
[00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:18.079]  It reportedly has completely passed, but there is some way to hamstring it, so we'll go over
[00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:23.809]  The legislative parlay with Reverend Ted Pike coming up in an hour and a half.
[00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:33.964]  Then Rand Paul with his Kentucky Senate bid will be joining us, the son of Dr. Ron Paul, a doctor in his own right.
[00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:41.515]  And then we've got Robert Wilcox, author of Target Patent, coming on.
[00:01:41.515 --> 00:01:50.023]  You know, we first had him on about six months ago, before it was really big mainstream news how Patent was murdered.
[00:01:50.023 --> 00:02:00.432]  But now it's been in scores of mainstream newspapers, going over the government documents, how General Patent was murdered because he wouldn't hand Germany over to the Soviet.
[00:02:02.995 --> 00:02:05.577]  So that is coming up in the last hour today.
[00:02:05.577 --> 00:02:08.059]  I'm going to have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:09.640]  In fact, I've been shaking things up a bit.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:19.928]  We've been taking a lot of calls early in the radio show because I've noticed that if I take some calls, it takes us in different directions, brings up different news items, different issues.
[00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:27.033]  That we had not previously been discussing or makes me think of stories that I meant to cover that I hadn't.
[00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:30.274]  It literally is a grab bag or a wheel of fortune.
[00:02:30.274 --> 00:02:32.736]  Spin the wheel, see what listeners have to say.
[00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:41.481]  So we'll open the phones up right now, but today, at least in the first two hours, for first-time callers.
[00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:43.362]  First-time callers only.
[00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:47.144]  John, be sure and ask them if they're first-time callers, no matter how great your point is.
[00:02:47.144 --> 00:02:48.905]  If you're not a first-time caller, and I recognize you,
[00:02:49.665 --> 00:03:07.268]  I'm going to hang up on you, because I want to give first-time callers, I get emails and letters saying people have tried to call in for years, this is your chance, first-time callers, on Obama's press conference last night and all that propaganda, on the socialized healthcare eugenics takeover.
[00:03:08.716 --> 00:03:19.465]  On all the anti-gun legislation, on all the news coming out of his administration filled with eugenicists calling for poisoning the food and water to sterilize the American people.
[00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:22.948]  The carbon tax raced through the House, now racing through the Senate.
[00:03:25.095 --> 00:03:27.397]  The $23.7 trillion.
[00:03:27.397 --> 00:03:32.800]  I actually flipped around on the radio this morning and heard it being discussed on two different talk stations.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.762]  But they're acting like it's the Democrats doing it, of course.
[00:03:35.762 --> 00:03:37.843]  Oh, it's only the Democrats.
[00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:40.064]  Oh, it's the liberals.
[00:03:40.064 --> 00:03:45.628]  No, it's the real government, the offshore private Federal Reserve.
[00:03:45.628 --> 00:03:50.991]  George Bush and Obama's handlers together engaged in this heist.
[00:03:50.991 --> 00:03:52.172]  They're all wearing
[00:03:53.777 --> 00:03:55.398]  The Little Black Mask.
[00:03:55.398 --> 00:03:58.259]  They're all in the same gang.
[00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:02.100]  They all need to be in striped uniforms.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.120]  Let's see.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.601]  Oh, it's all about Obama.
[00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:06.041]  He's stolen us blind.
[00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:07.442]  Well, yes he has.
[00:04:07.442 --> 00:04:20.326]  But if you just blame Obama and don't blame the Republicans, then in four years, or in eight years, we'll have a new president, different party, same ballgame.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.440]  Like a Don King fight.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.441]  He owns both the fighters.
[00:04:24.441 --> 00:04:27.942]  Or WWF wrestling, or WWE.
[00:04:27.942 --> 00:04:29.262]  It is staged.
[00:04:29.262 --> 00:04:32.743]  And when we have that revelation, we can start fixing things.
[00:04:32.743 --> 00:04:34.904]  And I know you know that.
[00:04:34.904 --> 00:04:46.808]  But, talk radio's saying, yeah, there's a world government, and a world currency, and a world bank, and it's all run by liberals.
[00:04:46.808 --> 00:04:47.688]  Bless their soul.
[00:04:48.936 --> 00:04:52.781]  But see, as long as they only make it about one party, the establishment's safe.
[00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:56.747]  When that illusion is shattered, then the globalists are in trouble.
[00:04:56.747 --> 00:04:58.710]  We'll break it all down, take your call straight ahead.
[00:05:00.094 --> 00:05:04.335]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:05:04.335 --> 00:05:06.335]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:05:06.335 --> 00:05:14.857]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:05:14.857 --> 00:05:20.399]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:22.019]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:28.783]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:05:28.783 --> 00:05:39.851]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:40.611]  That's right.
[00:05:40.611 --> 00:05:43.173]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:05:43.173 --> 00:05:44.794]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[00:05:44.794 --> 00:05:44.994]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:06:01.182 --> 00:06:06.984]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:06.984 --> 00:06:14.567]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:06:14.567 --> 00:06:20.730]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.131]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:23.131 --> 00:06:25.632]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:25.632 --> 00:06:37.197]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:06:37.197 --> 00:06:38.878]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.878 --> 00:06:40.739]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:46.962]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.637 --> 00:06:55.904]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.904 --> 00:06:57.486]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.486 --> 00:06:58.667]  The people strike back!
[00:07:00.484 --> 00:07:07.810]  If the current state of the economy is severely impacting your life, this might be some of the most important information you will ever hear.
[00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:15.817]  As the economy continues to spiral out of control, many people, just like you, wonder how they will support their family and pay their bills.
[00:07:15.817 --> 00:07:19.461]  The government is not going to help out the people who desperately need it.
[00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:22.944]  It's time for you to look outside the box and change your life.
[00:07:22.944 --> 00:07:25.566]  If you're tired of the get-rich-quick schemes, if you're
[00:07:25.606 --> 00:07:26.166]  We're good to go.
[00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.432]  Here's what you do dot net and start changing your life today.
[00:07:59.432 --> 00:08:03.655]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.655 --> 00:08:10.118]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.118 --> 00:08:16.262]  Okay, I have two giant stacks of vitally important news.
[00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:16.742]  All of it.
[00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:20.281]  Just so important.
[00:08:20.281 --> 00:08:27.983]  National level exercise, new information about the FEMA drill coming up in a few days.
[00:08:27.983 --> 00:08:37.986]  New revelations of hard legislation being introduced by the Obamanoids and their Republican accomplices and their accomplices in the media.
[00:08:37.986 --> 00:08:46.788]  More mainstream studies about high fructose corn syrup giving you diabetes, attacking your brain cells, impairing memory.
[00:08:48.157 --> 00:09:00.725]  It's just very important news, but I am trying to occasionally shake the show up, even if it doesn't even make it a better radio show overall.
[00:09:00.725 --> 00:09:06.469]  It's good to not get set in my ways and to shake things up and to do things differently.
[00:09:06.469 --> 00:09:13.033]  And so I am now going to take calls for the entire first hour covering none of the news stacks I have in front of me.
[00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:21.599]  Then, when I start the second hour, for 30 minutes I'm in a news blitz on financial news, you name it.
[00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:30.610]  Then we've got Reverend Ted Pike joining us with the hate speech, hate crime bill update, the cyber bullying update, where all that's going right now.
[00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:35.342]  Then Dr. Rand Paul joins us, son of Ron Paul, running for the Senate.
[00:09:35.342 --> 00:09:38.184]  I can tell you right now he's gonna run, folks.
[00:09:38.184 --> 00:09:43.306]  Robert Wilcox, author of Target Patent, how the CIA, formerly OSS, murdered him.
[00:09:43.306 --> 00:09:46.788]  And if you're not for murder and patent, you're not a patriot.
[00:09:46.788 --> 00:09:48.949]  You're not for blowing up the World Trade Centers, you're not a patriot.
[00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:52.131]  If you're not for shipping in heroin and cocaine, you're not a patriot.
[00:09:52.131 --> 00:09:58.274]  But a patriot means you're a patriot to the world government and destroying America.
[00:09:58.274 --> 00:10:00.915]  These guys that wrap themselves in the flags make me sick.
[00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.621]  So we'll be breaking that down as well.
[00:10:05.621 --> 00:10:08.864]  But as promised, let's go to your calls, first-time callers.
[00:10:08.864 --> 00:10:14.150]  And as you hear me hang up on one caller, as you hear one caller hang up, it is your chance to call in at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.753]  Here's the number for first-time callers, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:24.904 --> 00:10:28.566]  And if you disagree as a first-time caller, this is your chance.
[00:10:28.566 --> 00:10:29.087]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:41.154]  If you're a first-time caller, been trying to call in with a FEMA camp report, or a marshal law drill report, or a government corruption report in your area, here's your chance.
[00:10:41.154 --> 00:10:41.434]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:41.434 --> 00:10:43.336]  But please, we don't screen your calls.
[00:10:47.586 --> 00:10:49.747]  Just have your facts and info ready.
[00:10:49.747 --> 00:10:51.088]  I'm gonna try to give you a minute or so.
[00:10:51.088 --> 00:10:53.029]  I'm gonna try not to comment too long.
[00:10:53.029 --> 00:10:57.191]  I'm gonna move to the next person so we can get more people on air.
[00:10:57.191 --> 00:11:02.833]  Because a lot of folks just constantly email me and write me letters saying, I can never get on, I can never get in.
[00:11:02.833 --> 00:11:04.954]  This is your chance, first-time callers.
[00:11:04.954 --> 00:11:07.696]  If you have a question for me as a first-time caller.
[00:11:07.696 --> 00:11:10.237]  First-time callers only today, at least in the first couple hours.
[00:11:10.237 --> 00:11:10.297]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:11:15.506 --> 00:11:22.048]  Kind of like C-SPAN Journal, you can call in with a local news story or national news story or your take on something happening.
[00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:26.449]  This is your chance to be part of the broadcast and reach millions of people.
[00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:28.130]  And not just millions of people.
[00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.791]  This is not like millions of people watching some sitcom or drama.
[00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:35.272]  This is millions of active, informed info warriors.
[00:11:36.152 --> 00:11:42.994]  You want to commune across the airwaves with fellow like-minded liberty lovers?
[00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:44.554]  This is your chance.
[00:11:44.554 --> 00:11:47.375]  Austin in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:11:47.375 --> 00:11:48.895]  Hey Alex, what's going on man?
[00:11:48.895 --> 00:11:50.836]  Worldwide transmission.
[00:11:50.836 --> 00:11:58.578]  Well, I'm down here in Florida and I'm just kind of getting you guys some information about what I think is going on.
[00:11:58.578 --> 00:12:01.719]  It seems like down here especially they're setting up
[00:12:02.578 --> 00:12:30.261]  Uh, the Marshall already, um, I've seen an explosion of, like, cop cars just constantly, I mean, more than I've ever seen down here before, and, um, it just seems like they're targeting the young people, uh, mostly, and because there's so many old people down here, and it seems like if you're out past, like, eight or nine o'clock, and you're young driving a car, I mean, that's just free game, and they're just, it's like, it's pretty nuts down here, man, it's getting wild.
[00:12:30.885 --> 00:12:45.377]  But I just want to appreciate everything you do, man, and I'm waking up people every day, and I noticed a lot of people down here are using music and bands to get their message out about the New World Order and everything.
[00:12:45.377 --> 00:12:52.663]  And a lot of kids are just getting their message out through the lyrics and music, and that's pretty much it, man.
[00:12:52.663 --> 00:12:58.688]  I just want to appreciate everything you do, and I'm helping waking up as many people as I can.
[00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.570]  Austin, you are awesome.
[00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:01.491]  Take care from Florida.
[00:13:01.491 --> 00:13:06.212]  Let me comment on both the issues you raised.
[00:13:06.212 --> 00:13:11.953]  First off, the globalists are masters of psychology.
[00:13:11.953 --> 00:13:19.014]  They know how to make you want to live in tyranny.
[00:13:19.014 --> 00:13:21.075]  They created a fiat cashless society.
[00:13:21.075 --> 00:13:25.456]  They created a debt bubble, a debt vortex, a debt singularity, a black hole.
[00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:30.302]  That would destroy the economic society by design.
[00:13:30.302 --> 00:13:34.403]  At the same time, they hyped up gangster culture, criminal culture.
[00:13:34.403 --> 00:13:39.724]  They pumped in 30 million illegal aliens, many of which are criminal.
[00:13:39.724 --> 00:13:46.906]  Many of the criminal element of Latin America and Asia and Europe have raced to the United States.
[00:13:46.906 --> 00:13:51.708]  And so crime is exploding right now.
[00:13:51.708 --> 00:13:52.748]  And so police
[00:13:54.349 --> 00:14:02.152]  Don't really talk about it, but I had the Austin Police Chief in and he said, he said, have you noticed there's more police?
[00:14:02.152 --> 00:14:04.693]  And I said, no, there's not really more police.
[00:14:04.693 --> 00:14:07.935]  You upped the Austin Police three years ago before you even got here.
[00:14:07.935 --> 00:14:11.076]  You're just having them drive around with their sirens on.
[00:14:11.076 --> 00:14:14.538]  You're having them drive around in groups.
[00:14:14.538 --> 00:14:18.980]  And he said, ah, you're an astute young man.
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.061]  That's exactly what we're doing, high visibility to create the perception.
[00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:30.434]  So see, to the police, it all sounds reasonable.
[00:14:30.434 --> 00:14:33.337]  Oh, we've got higher crime rates increasing.
[00:14:33.337 --> 00:14:37.161]  So we've got to set up checkpoints, and the end justifies the means.
[00:14:37.161 --> 00:14:41.465]  We'll end up catching more criminals, we'll end up catching more felons, more drunks.
[00:14:41.465 --> 00:14:49.713]  But everybody knows when they catch an illegal alien, the biggest culprits, they are ordered to let them go, or they get a slap on the wrist by the judge, $50 fine on average, and are released.
[00:14:50.353 --> 00:14:53.035]  Or they call ICE, ICE won't pick them up.
[00:14:53.035 --> 00:15:02.023]  Or the New York Times reported earlier this year that Homeland Security takes them to government job centers and gives them jobs and green cards.
[00:15:02.023 --> 00:15:06.366]  So they'll come pick the illegals up now, but they'll take them to give them a job.
[00:15:06.366 --> 00:15:09.109]  Because they're there to drive down wages.
[00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:12.251]  You understand?
[00:15:12.251 --> 00:15:15.294]  They're a key economic military force.
[00:15:19.102 --> 00:15:37.358]  And as society breaks down, as crime rates explode, as things unravel, you're going to have the police more and more under pressure, the citizens calling for more and more.
[00:15:37.358 --> 00:15:39.380]  And yes, they are running checkpoints.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.822]  The army is showing up at checkpoints.
[00:15:41.822 --> 00:15:45.806]  And as riots break out in the next three, four years, as society degenerates,
[00:15:47.762 --> 00:15:57.280]  The public will say, thank God the Army and Marines came out in restored order when they were burning this area of the city or looting that area of the city, and then the precedent is set.
[00:15:58.154 --> 00:16:02.396]  It's like they set the precedent with National Guard and Regular Army in New York.
[00:16:02.396 --> 00:16:04.037]  Now they're in Dallas.
[00:16:04.037 --> 00:16:06.038]  Now they're in Phoenix.
[00:16:06.038 --> 00:16:08.100]  Now they're in Tennessee.
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.761]  Now they're all over California and Oregon.
[00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:20.787]  The Regular Army, Regular Marines, with sidearms, searching citizens' cars at checkpoints with big lights out.
[00:16:20.787 --> 00:16:21.507]  In the middle of the night.
[00:16:21.507 --> 00:16:23.128]  And in the broad daylight.
[00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:29.172]  And when local reporters pull up to videotape it, troops walk up and say, turn your camera off.
[00:16:29.172 --> 00:16:39.615]  So yes, we are going into martial law, and it's going to be sold, and it's going to be billed as something good, and in many cases, it will be.
[00:16:39.615 --> 00:16:44.856]  It's kind of like if you have bad arthritis, the first time you're given corticotopic steroids,
[00:16:47.537 --> 00:17:00.305]  Like cortisone, it helps the first year or so, but then a year or two later, it kicks in and degenerates your joints 20, 30 times faster to where you can't walk.
[00:17:00.305 --> 00:17:05.828]  It makes your heart tissue disintegrate.
[00:17:05.828 --> 00:17:07.829]  So see, that's the parallel here.
[00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:08.610]  Oh, yeah.
[00:17:09.761 --> 00:17:25.905]  The globalists have engineered a system where military will be needed on the streets, more police violating the Bill of Rights in a state of emergency will be needed, and then the President said they engineered the crisis to then offer the solution, and the average cop doesn't know that.
[00:17:25.905 --> 00:17:37.928]  They're not involved in social engineering, master planning, though all this is on paper and public, and in the end it's going to destroy us.
[00:17:41.542 --> 00:17:46.446]  Are you going to be the one when inner city populations are burning down large areas of cities?
[00:17:46.446 --> 00:17:48.267]  If it comes to that, a lot of evidence shows it will.
[00:17:48.267 --> 00:18:02.697]  Are you going to be the one out complaining as the fires get nearer your neighborhood and there's army out there shooting looters?
[00:18:02.697 --> 00:18:06.000]  See, people are saying, oh, the military isn't going to shoot at US citizens.
[00:18:08.424 --> 00:18:16.151]  But see, just like the Feds made aid not be allowed to come into New Orleans, just like they ordered people into the Superdome, just like they wouldn't let people get out on the major highways.
[00:18:16.151 --> 00:18:19.354]  They could get out at four or five different places.
[00:18:19.354 --> 00:18:22.617]  Just like the National Guard would try to bring food in where we're not to.
[00:18:22.617 --> 00:18:24.419]  Walmart tried.
[00:18:24.419 --> 00:18:26.681]  The fire departments from Houston tried.
[00:18:26.681 --> 00:18:30.625]  The Houston Police Department, only less than 100 miles away, tried.
[00:18:33.749 --> 00:18:42.814]  The local police and county tried, and FEMA came in with fire axes and hacked their communications as the hurricane was hitting.
[00:18:42.814 --> 00:18:45.096]  That's on record!
[00:18:45.096 --> 00:18:54.421]  So, when everything broke down, FEMA could say, oh look, we screwed up, we need even more funding and power for the martial law to come.
[00:18:54.421 --> 00:18:57.883]  And oh, they didn't send the military with aid.
[00:18:57.883 --> 00:19:02.746]  They sent them into the high and dry areas to loot homes and take people's firearms.
[00:19:03.888 --> 00:19:17.774]  And they'd catch people going across Lake Pontchartrain with their own firearms and granddaddy's shotgun and the police, the feds, would board their boat and steal their family heirlooms and they never got them back.
[00:19:17.774 --> 00:19:20.555]  It's social engineering, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:21.584 --> 00:19:26.126]  And you better get wise to it, and you better understand what's happening and how this is being done.
[00:19:26.126 --> 00:19:34.310]  On the second point, one of my greatest frustrations is I don't have time to go through all the patriot music and patriotic anti-new world order stuff out there.
[00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:49.317]  I know a lot of folks send it to me, a lot of people call me, and I'm just so busy making films, writing books, doing the show, that I can't reach out to all the incredible people, but know that I admire you all and just think you're great and keep it up.
[00:19:49.317 --> 00:19:50.318]  I salute all of you.
[00:19:52.031 --> 00:19:54.713]  Some people get scorned because I don't return their calls or emails.
[00:19:54.713 --> 00:19:57.494]  I can't even listen to half this great stuff I've sent.
[00:19:57.494 --> 00:20:00.996]  Warrior Call, straight ahead.
[00:20:00.996 --> 00:20:03.057]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[00:20:03.057 --> 00:20:05.999]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[00:20:05.999 --> 00:20:08.240]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.221]  Here's the story.
[00:20:09.221 --> 00:20:14.023]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[00:20:14.023 --> 00:20:15.264]  Now here's the bad news.
[00:20:15.264 --> 00:20:18.546]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands.
[00:20:18.806 --> 00:20:19.026]  We're good.
[00:20:34.756 --> 00:20:43.781]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[00:20:43.781 --> 00:20:48.964]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and is flat out the best course of its kind.
[00:20:48.964 --> 00:20:53.066]  I recommend you visit this important new website at MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[00:20:53.066 --> 00:20:55.847]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[00:21:01.687 --> 00:21:06.151]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question.
[00:21:06.151 --> 00:21:09.874]  What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[00:21:09.874 --> 00:21:12.777]  The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count.
[00:21:12.777 --> 00:21:19.343]  Now take that blank page of yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets and escape the paper markets.
[00:21:19.343 --> 00:21:27.410]  The only real option is precious metals for your retirement, your kid's education, or just plain survival when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down.
[00:21:28.359 --> 00:21:31.480]  You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.981]  And I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family.
[00:21:35.981 --> 00:21:40.422]  Please give me a call at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:21:40.422 --> 00:21:46.023]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:21:46.023 --> 00:21:49.924]  And together we can develop a Make Sense program before the clock runs out.
[00:21:49.924 --> 00:21:51.765]  Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:21:51.765 --> 00:21:54.085]  And take charge of your future and thank you.
[00:22:01.371 --> 00:22:07.416]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:07.416 --> 00:22:13.301]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:22:13.301 --> 00:22:19.447]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:19.787 --> 00:22:21.749]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:21.749 --> 00:22:24.231]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:24.231 --> 00:22:37.401]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:22:37.401 --> 00:22:39.082]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:39.082 --> 00:22:40.944]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:40.944 --> 00:22:47.169]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:47.825 --> 00:22:56.114]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:56.114 --> 00:22:57.676]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:57.676 --> 00:22:58.878]  The people strike back!
[00:23:12.605 --> 00:23:14.226]  We're good to go.
[00:23:31.892 --> 00:23:32.252]  We're good.
[00:24:14.266 --> 00:24:16.768]  Alright, I just spent 10 minutes with one caller.
[00:24:16.768 --> 00:24:22.152]  It's almost impossible for me to take a lot of calls, but we're getting better at it.
[00:24:22.152 --> 00:24:23.633]  Ryan in Wisconsin.
[00:24:23.633 --> 00:24:24.573]  Ryan, you're on the air.
[00:24:24.573 --> 00:24:26.155]  Go ahead.
[00:24:26.155 --> 00:24:29.257]  Hey Alex, I wanted to say thanks for waking me up.
[00:24:29.257 --> 00:24:30.478]  I had a question for you.
[00:24:30.478 --> 00:24:34.040]  Basically, I want to get your opinion about something.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:40.645]  Before I was hit to the whole biometrics thing, I went to Disney World and I scanned my finger.
[00:24:41.243 --> 00:24:46.665]  And I was just wondering what that means, in your opinion, as far as Mark of the Beast.
[00:24:46.665 --> 00:24:52.207]  Well, guaranteed, because all these companies have been caught doing it, Disney has sold that to Homeland Security.
[00:24:52.207 --> 00:24:56.168]  They had big consortium meetings starting about 12 years ago.
[00:24:56.168 --> 00:24:58.089]  We've seen the corporate minutes, we've read them on air.
[00:24:59.448 --> 00:25:03.831]  from big biometric global standardization consortiums.
[00:25:03.831 --> 00:25:06.433]  They had a UN treaty in 2000.
[00:25:06.433 --> 00:25:27.067]  The US signed on to it at the meeting in Australia for a world standardization of biometric retina scan, thumbprints, fingerprints, palm prints, and global standardization of other biometric data RFID standardization.
[00:25:27.067 --> 00:25:28.929]  So they have a global standardization
[00:25:30.413 --> 00:25:35.415]  And so you can read the corporate minutes of these RFID conferences and the Pentagon will be there.
[00:25:35.415 --> 00:25:47.779]  You can pull up USA Today, the exact headline was in 2002, going from memory, something like, try this right now, let's see if I'm accurate guys.
[00:25:49.112 --> 00:25:50.654]  Let's see if I'm accurate right now.
[00:25:50.654 --> 00:25:51.554]  This is from 2002.
[00:25:51.554 --> 00:25:54.037]  It was a USA Today headline.
[00:25:54.037 --> 00:25:56.218]  Then off that, I went to the consortium website.
[00:25:56.218 --> 00:26:00.002]  It was a Chicago biometric meeting in 2002.
[00:26:00.002 --> 00:26:03.104]  Again, there's scores of these, but I'm just giving you one of them.
[00:26:03.104 --> 00:26:03.785]  Not my opinion.
[00:26:03.785 --> 00:26:06.587]  I'll give you fact.
[00:26:06.587 --> 00:26:09.130]  Universal adoption of RFID by 2005.
[00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:23.240]  And then you read the article, the Defense Department ordered industry, so the Defense Department could order this to put in their, quote, control grid.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:38.173]  Walmart teamed up with them at the time, had 34% of world retail, they're now about 40%, to force all retail manufacturers, the manufacturers of retail items, to adopt RFID in a global standardized system.
[00:26:39.094 --> 00:26:41.017]  Uh, they called it God-like control.
[00:26:41.017 --> 00:26:45.583]  That was then again in the news last week in a Wired Magazine story.
[00:26:45.583 --> 00:26:49.188]  Also, there was another story out of the register in England.
[00:26:49.188 --> 00:26:50.530]  Print me that again, too, guys.
[00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:54.495]  Headline, Rumsfeld says, Pentagon to have God-like power.
[00:26:55.516 --> 00:26:57.236]  Uh, to track everything.
[00:26:57.236 --> 00:27:05.538]  And so what they want is a biometric face scanning, thumbprint scanning, RFID, smart dust system to track every slave on Earth.
[00:27:05.538 --> 00:27:07.599]  And this is the extermination grid.
[00:27:07.599 --> 00:27:08.739]  This is the tracking grid.
[00:27:08.739 --> 00:27:18.381]  Once it's in place, they can really then beta test the, uh, mass bioweapon releases and not just cull, you know, 30, 40% of Africa.
[00:27:18.381 --> 00:27:21.401]  Cause there, they've kind of got a news blackout and they can carry it out.
[00:27:21.401 --> 00:27:23.602]  They want to really start doing some heavy killing here.
[00:27:26.087 --> 00:27:27.748]  Go ahead.
[00:27:27.748 --> 00:27:37.552]  So what, I mean, is there anything that I can do as far as, um, I'm not a totally religious person, but I somewhat believe in, uh, the mark of the beast and all that stuff.
[00:27:37.552 --> 00:27:40.673]  Is there anything I can do as far as fighting this?
[00:27:40.673 --> 00:27:48.417]  I mean, I mean, I made a mistake and did something that now knowing what I know now I wouldn't have done.
[00:27:48.417 --> 00:27:50.898]  Um, I mean, is there anything I can do?
[00:27:54.124 --> 00:28:05.291]  Well, the problem is the 501c3 churches, we never had that until the fifties, the feds told the churches they had to waive all their rights, the churches believed the mind trick and did it.
[00:28:05.291 --> 00:28:06.332]  It's all fraudulent.
[00:28:06.332 --> 00:28:11.495]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:28:11.495 --> 00:28:14.377]  First Amendment begins with those words.
[00:28:14.377 --> 00:28:17.839]  And the World Council of Churches set up by the Rockefellers a hundred years ago, they
[00:28:23.089 --> 00:28:29.494]  They have bought off all the major denominations, Catholic, Protestant, you name it.
[00:28:29.494 --> 00:28:34.458]  And so they're telling everybody, rejoice, give in to this, you're going to be teleported out of here.
[00:28:34.458 --> 00:28:38.581]  Boy, are Christians going to be upset when they're not teleported out, that's why they're going to accept it.
[00:28:38.581 --> 00:28:40.163]  That's the great delusion.
[00:28:40.163 --> 00:28:47.228]  But that's what the Bible says, that the Antichrist will say he's Christ, and most Christians will fall down and worship him, the elect will be deceived.
[00:28:47.228 --> 00:28:49.070]  He will say he's Jesus and they will believe it.
[00:28:50.049 --> 00:28:50.949]  Yes it does, I appreciate it.
[00:29:14.383 --> 00:29:32.163]  Yeah, the biggest thing you can do is go to local churches, not even ones your members at, and just start handing out documents at the churches 501c3 and ask the pastor if they're under FEMA control and a secret agreement and really just breaking the whole covert operations umbrella that's over us.
[00:29:32.163 --> 00:29:33.565]  You break it by showing people.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:41.383]  I mean, imagine what the church is going to think when they find out that their pastor is a spook, is a spy, is a government operative.
[00:29:41.383 --> 00:29:46.285]  I mean, we're all living in a James Bond movie, folks.
[00:29:46.285 --> 00:29:50.947]  The globalists have taken their time setting this thing up.
[00:29:50.947 --> 00:29:52.348]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.348 --> 00:29:54.869]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.869 --> 00:29:57.570]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.285 --> 00:30:01.667]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:30:01.667 --> 00:30:03.669]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:04.309]  Well, you should.
[00:30:04.309 --> 00:30:09.135]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:30:09.135 --> 00:30:09.956]  That's right.
[00:30:09.956 --> 00:30:18.605]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:30:18.605 --> 00:30:19.967]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:30:19.967 --> 00:30:21.108]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:30:21.308 --> 00:30:27.291]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:30:27.291 --> 00:30:34.175]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:30:34.175 --> 00:30:39.699]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:30:39.699 --> 00:30:41.179]  This is real.
[00:30:41.179 --> 00:30:42.220]  Don't miss out.
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:49.084]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[00:30:49.544 --> 00:30:51.145]  It is a big idea.
[00:30:51.145 --> 00:30:54.226]  A new world order.
[00:30:54.226 --> 00:31:07.191]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:07.191 --> 00:31:13.094]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:13.094 --> 00:31:15.875]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:31:15.875 --> 00:31:18.276]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:31:19.045 --> 00:31:26.370]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:31:29.397 --> 00:31:34.841]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:38.163]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:31:38.163 --> 00:31:41.285]  The Oval Bureau is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:31:41.285 --> 00:31:42.446]  Most people have no idea.
[00:31:42.446 --> 00:31:43.226]  They're not after money.
[00:31:43.226 --> 00:31:44.527]  They have all the money they need.
[00:31:44.527 --> 00:31:45.488]  They're after power.
[00:31:45.488 --> 00:31:46.649]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:31:55.354 --> 00:31:56.135]  Endgame.
[00:31:56.135 --> 00:31:58.176]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[00:31:58.176 --> 00:31:59.277]  You have been warned.
[00:32:00.138 --> 00:32:00.738]  Yeah.
[00:32:00.738 --> 00:32:06.244]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[00:32:06.244 --> 00:32:10.889]  Well the answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:32:10.889 --> 00:32:16.615]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP to kill parasites.
[00:32:16.835 --> 00:32:25.458]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[00:32:25.458 --> 00:32:28.440]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:34.922]  Our natural insecticides work in the home, on plants and in your garden, killing pests mechanically, not with poisons.
[00:32:34.922 --> 00:32:38.884]  So pests can't develop an immunity and they won't harm your children or pets.
[00:32:39.304 --> 00:32:49.135]  It's effective against white flies, moths, bedbugs, fleas, roaches, crickets and more and safe enough to use on your pets, ridding them of fleas and other pests.

[00:33:17.152 --> 00:33:36.437]  Here's the headline, U.S.
[00:33:36.437 --> 00:33:42.559]  military installed global internet architecture giving a god-like view of the planet.
[00:33:42.559 --> 00:33:45.840]  That was reported by Wired Magazine and
[00:33:47.099 --> 00:34:06.384]  Several other British newspapers, like The Examiner, you can go read them bragging, everything you do, everything you buy, everything you sell, brain scanners on every street corner, then quote, oh, if you look agitated, they're going to send out psychological police.
[00:34:06.384 --> 00:34:10.465]  You cannot make up how draconian, how sickening it is.
[00:34:12.594 --> 00:34:18.659]  They're engineering the economy where it isn't going to be manufacturing cars, it isn't going to be manufacturing computers.
[00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:23.803]  Any cars or computers are going to be manufactured for them to run your life.
[00:34:23.803 --> 00:34:26.745]  And where the majority of new jobs will be as enforcers.
[00:34:26.745 --> 00:34:33.871]  So people will rationalize and join the corrupt system because that's going to be the only growth industry, the only jobs.
[00:34:33.871 --> 00:34:39.555]  Is prisons and surveillance and micromanagement and the youth brigades and the senior corps
[00:34:40.561 --> 00:34:52.928]  As the Fed said a decade ago, they're now announcing that your forced compulsory national service will be wearing uniforms, will be spying on neighbors.
[00:34:52.928 --> 00:34:56.770]  And going back for at least 20 years, but now they're just announcing it publicly.
[00:34:56.770 --> 00:35:00.172]  Cable TV workers trained to spy on citizens.
[00:35:00.172 --> 00:35:05.995]  This is from PrisonPlanet.com from Paul Watson, but he links to Fox 35 report.
[00:35:08.237 --> 00:35:09.898]  Which of course says it's great.
[00:35:09.898 --> 00:35:12.980]  While they're in your house without a warrant, they're spying on everything.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.842]  Including anti-government literature.
[00:35:15.842 --> 00:35:18.604]  They're being trained according to the DHS report.
[00:35:18.604 --> 00:35:21.486]  They see Ron Paul stickers, you're getting reported.
[00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:25.169]  This is the land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:35:25.169 --> 00:35:26.330]  You might want to go read that article.
[00:35:29.102 --> 00:35:40.861]  Bright House Networks employees will watch for suspicious behavior, which according to law enforcement DHS guidelines includes being politically active, displaying bumper stickers, or disagreeing with the government.
[00:35:42.475 --> 00:35:48.557]  One of the largest cable TV companies in the United States is training its employees to look for suspicious behavior and report it to police.
[00:35:48.557 --> 00:35:52.258]  Of course, they have agreements where the company gets part of the fines and fees.
[00:35:52.258 --> 00:36:07.843]  Under the guise of Neighborhood Watch Initiative, since according to law enforcement and Homeland Security guidelines, suspicious behavior includes owning guns, being politically active, and having bumper stickers on your car, the cable guy's next visit to your house may turn out to have more interesting consequences than you originally anticipated.
[00:36:09.628 --> 00:36:15.831]  And now that we know about this, I mean, that's why the exterminator or the lawn person, they'll start asking questions.
[00:36:15.831 --> 00:36:30.138]  And you'll see them when you're in your house, looking on your tables, looking around, because a lot of these people make more money off of payments they get for turning people in than they do off their job.
[00:36:30.138 --> 00:36:34.180]  In fact, I remember seeing a 60-minute story, had to be 15 years ago,
[00:36:36.112 --> 00:36:38.292]  Sitting there on a Sunday evening watching 60 Minutes.
[00:36:38.292 --> 00:36:43.474]  I'd go over to my grandparents sometimes and have Sunday dinner with them.
[00:36:43.474 --> 00:36:45.434]  I'd go in and watch 60 Minutes with my grandfather.
[00:36:45.434 --> 00:36:47.414]  He liked 60 Minutes.
[00:36:47.414 --> 00:37:00.477]  I remember a show on there about airline ticket counter people making more money off tips than they made off their regular job.
[00:37:04.406 --> 00:37:06.567]  And I talked about one lady making over $100,000 a year.
[00:37:06.567 --> 00:37:26.460]  It was a famous case of a guy who flies every year from South Carolina to Houston, and he would pay in cash, because then he got a discount, but he had receipts and everything, to buy part of that year's crepe myrtles and other trees.
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.902]  And then they would be shipped by 18-wheeler to South Carolina.
[00:37:34.778 --> 00:37:41.182]  He pulled out a lot of cash to pay, they took his money, and it was asset forfeiture seizure, and that was the end of it.
[00:37:41.182 --> 00:37:42.903]  So, this is the new America.
[00:37:42.903 --> 00:37:47.385]  I mean, you know, I mention this headline a lot because people don't seem to believe it.
[00:37:47.385 --> 00:37:48.546]  What was the exact headline?
[00:37:48.546 --> 00:37:54.470]  It was, uh, scofflaws get caught when ordering pizzas, USA Today.
[00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:55.570]  And that was 2002.
[00:37:55.570 --> 00:38:03.235]  And it said what we already knew, we've already been told this by pizza company, higher level
[00:38:04.272 --> 00:38:07.374]  Executives, mid-level executives.
[00:38:07.374 --> 00:38:17.762]  The three big pizza companies, wouldn't say who, but the big three, they basically all do it now, the big ones, and talk about how they get 25 to 35 percent of the fines.
[00:38:17.762 --> 00:38:24.907]  When you call to order a pizza, you tend to give your real name, real credit card, real address.
[00:38:24.907 --> 00:38:30.432]  Well, guilty until proven innocent, it is then run through a private subsidiary company tied in with Rumsfeld Holdings.
[00:38:31.716 --> 00:38:33.777]  In Dallas, this is just one hub.
[00:38:33.777 --> 00:38:36.198]  There's other services.
[00:38:36.198 --> 00:38:40.559]  And then that is instantly uploaded to law enforcement.
[00:38:40.559 --> 00:38:44.041]  And instead of getting a pizza, you get a SWAT team visit.
[00:38:44.041 --> 00:38:51.023]  And it said it's even for warrants for parking tickets.
[00:38:51.023 --> 00:38:52.744]  Even for warrants for speeding tickets.
[00:38:52.744 --> 00:38:54.185]  The most basic stuff.
[00:38:54.185 --> 00:38:58.106]  And a lot of times they go ahead and deliver the pizza, but then a day later the police come.
[00:38:58.106 --> 00:38:59.507]  Or if you got a felony, more come.
[00:39:00.649 --> 00:39:06.591]  This is a Pentagon-designed grid.
[00:39:06.591 --> 00:39:15.314]  And they're going to stage chem and bio-attacks, they're going to blame it on terrorists, they're going to use that to herd us into the cities in the next decade, and then they're going to release stuff that wipes out almost everybody.
[00:39:15.314 --> 00:39:18.394]  So I want the cops who are laughing in the military.
[00:39:18.394 --> 00:39:26.417]  When you're there with your family dying later, at least then some of you may be able to survive and remember who did it.
[00:39:26.417 --> 00:39:29.538]  And when the Rockefellers and Rothschilds and others emerge from their bunkers,
[00:39:31.538 --> 00:39:33.859]  There'll be no rationales, no excuses.
[00:39:33.859 --> 00:39:34.700]  You know who did it.
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.260]  You know who the enemy is.
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:44.324]  Just in case we lose this round and it really gets bad, I want to implant now, in the history, in the memory, who did it.
[00:39:44.324 --> 00:39:48.085]  Because I know a lot of you aren't going to listen now.
[00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:51.086]  Down the road, I want you to pay attention.
[00:39:51.086 --> 00:39:51.927]  I know you're laughing.
[00:39:51.927 --> 00:39:53.007]  It's funny now!
[00:39:53.007 --> 00:39:54.408]  I understand it is.
[00:39:54.408 --> 00:39:54.748]  To you.
[00:39:56.766 --> 00:40:01.409]  You're not going to read the White House science czar openly saying all this.
[00:40:01.409 --> 00:40:02.670]  You're going to suck your thumb.
[00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:05.532]  You're going to stick it in your mouth and feel good.
[00:40:05.532 --> 00:40:11.777]  Go home and watch some sports tonight and act tough to the neighbor.
[00:40:11.777 --> 00:40:15.860]  I understand you're going to strut around in front of your wife and act tough at the grocery store and impress her.
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:16.640]  I understand that.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:23.926]  If you were a real man, you'd face history and face the scientific dictatorship we're under and wake up to that we're all on the same boat.
[00:40:25.265 --> 00:40:28.127]  But I know there's a good chance you're not.
[00:40:28.127 --> 00:40:38.855]  So at least before you die, as you're going, oh my God, Alex Jones was right, you might get your soul and heart right with God.
[00:40:38.855 --> 00:40:40.936]  Or some of you are going to live.
[00:40:40.936 --> 00:40:42.457]  Some of you will have natural immunity.
[00:40:42.457 --> 00:40:51.684]  And when you're dealing with the hunter-killers, the flesh-eating robots, they're going to send after you into the rebel's enclaves.
[00:40:51.684 --> 00:40:54.106]  Just remember, we could have stopped it all early on.
[00:40:55.762 --> 00:41:01.925]  And see, I know this sounds insane, but where do you think they get ideas for movies like The Matrix and movies like Terminator?
[00:41:01.925 --> 00:41:04.767]  It's all from Pentagon documents, and we list those.
[00:41:04.767 --> 00:41:07.368]  It's in my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:41:07.368 --> 00:41:12.171]  The Swords are 30 years old, already killing people in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:41:12.171 --> 00:41:16.493]  They're now about to roll out flesh-eating robots, according to Associated Press.
[00:41:16.493 --> 00:41:17.934]  In fact, they don't believe that.
[00:41:17.934 --> 00:41:19.815]  Print me the flesh-eating robot again.
[00:41:19.815 --> 00:41:23.337]  Just Google flesh-eating robots to be deployed.
[00:41:24.633 --> 00:41:28.096]  Because, see, that's how they're going to feed themselves.
[00:41:28.096 --> 00:41:32.820]  Hunter-killers, is what they're called.
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:38.224]  And they've even got them coming out that wear camouflage uniforms and have rubber skin.
[00:41:38.224 --> 00:41:40.326]  Oh, like the early Terminators!
[00:41:40.326 --> 00:41:43.348]  Oh, I'm sorry, it was all Pentagon plan!
[00:41:43.348 --> 00:41:47.031]  But, see, you won't wake up to it because you watched a movie.
[00:41:47.031 --> 00:41:49.934]  You don't understand it's predicted programming.
[00:41:49.934 --> 00:41:52.476]  You don't understand the Terminators work for the bankers.
[00:41:55.441 --> 00:41:56.261]  The Terminators.
[00:41:56.261 --> 00:42:01.644]  Yes, they're real.
[00:42:01.644 --> 00:42:08.007]  Flesh-eating Terminators.
[00:42:08.007 --> 00:42:14.491]  Yeah, you guys found it with your search, and then all you do is click on that article, and then it'll take you to the... that's just a blog reporting on the article.
[00:42:14.491 --> 00:42:19.393]  Then that article will lead you to the article.
[00:42:19.393 --> 00:42:20.934]  Flesh-eating Robots.
[00:42:24.426 --> 00:42:27.609]  Feed on dead bodies.
[00:42:27.609 --> 00:42:30.552]  And that pulled up the Fox News headline.
[00:42:30.552 --> 00:42:36.578]  Biomass Eating Robots is a vegetarian company says.
[00:42:36.578 --> 00:42:43.584]  That's a new article about it.
[00:42:43.584 --> 00:42:48.409]  Oh, the flesh eatings, they did, that's the original article of the same, same, uh,
[00:42:50.658 --> 00:42:55.840]  Same photo of the control drone running the flesh eaters on the ground.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.261]  Wow!
[00:42:57.261 --> 00:42:58.782]  Well, I gave that to Jacobson.
[00:42:58.782 --> 00:43:02.103]  He better have screenshot that for the film.
[00:43:02.103 --> 00:43:03.324]  Oh, we have copies around here.
[00:43:03.324 --> 00:43:05.365]  It's in the stack.
[00:43:05.365 --> 00:43:05.805]  Wow!
[00:43:05.805 --> 00:43:07.706]  They took it down!
[00:43:07.706 --> 00:43:09.126]  Amazing!
[00:43:09.126 --> 00:43:12.508]  They had company quotes about how it eats humans.
[00:43:12.508 --> 00:43:14.649]  Oh, I guess that was a little much for the slaves to hear.
[00:43:18.052 --> 00:43:25.555]  The whole Pentagon's converting over to drone and remote control and AI aircraft, helicopters and soldiers.
[00:43:25.555 --> 00:43:35.819]  Humans will just maintenance the maintenance robots that work in the robot factories and then the next phase there won't even be humans needed for that.
[00:43:35.819 --> 00:43:44.823]  It'll be robots working on robots that work on robots with some specialized technicians but they'll all be eugenicists who believe in the holy work.
[00:43:46.328 --> 00:43:47.469]  No, you think I'm joking.
[00:43:47.469 --> 00:43:49.950]  Okay, well, that's fine.
[00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:51.251]  That's fine.
[00:43:51.251 --> 00:43:54.032]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ronald in D.C.
[00:43:54.032 --> 00:43:54.913]  Ronald, you're on the air.
[00:43:54.913 --> 00:43:57.214]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[00:43:57.214 --> 00:43:59.595]  It's an honor to be on your show right now.
[00:43:59.595 --> 00:44:01.596]  Honored to have you with us.
[00:44:01.596 --> 00:44:09.181]  Yeah, but basically I wanted to talk to you about the police state that you were talking about in your films.
[00:44:10.427 --> 00:44:12.988]  I recently just moved to Washington, D.C.
[00:44:12.988 --> 00:44:27.975]  and my friend who lives in the city of North Carolina recently told me that they installed these cameras on top of the telephone poles to monitor people on the streets and what had happened was... Yeah, that's part of the kill grid.
[00:44:27.975 --> 00:44:31.217]  Again, first they said it was for traffic and it did have dual use for that.
[00:44:31.217 --> 00:44:37.020]  Now they go, oh, the cameras are for you and they're face scanning you and reading your license plate.
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.660]  Oh, it's Pentagon designed.
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:39.401]  Go ahead.
[00:44:40.222 --> 00:44:50.457]  Yeah, what had happened is the reason why he found out about this was this guy broke into somebody's car or something like that and then the next day the cops just ran up to his house and...
[00:44:50.976 --> 00:44:56.037]  Pulled him out of his house and we were like, uh, yeah, we got you on camera, um, breaking this guy's car.
[00:44:56.037 --> 00:44:58.277]  And the guy was like, I didn't know you guys had cameras.
[00:44:58.277 --> 00:45:02.638]  Yeah, and of course it has a, of course it has a use.
[00:45:02.638 --> 00:45:07.799]  And then they're going to statistically only bust a certain amount to fill their prisons.
[00:45:07.799 --> 00:45:13.260]  And they're artificially turning the economy off where people won't be able to live without stealing.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.861]  And then you get half the public in prison and half the public running the grid.
[00:45:17.984 --> 00:45:29.169]  And, uh, you know, people spying on the watchers and they'll burn lots of watchers and lots of cops on TV to make everybody get into accepting it and it'll all be run by the psych warfare chiefs.
[00:45:29.169 --> 00:45:32.771]  And the thing about it is, like, it was a city, it was a really rural town.
[00:45:32.771 --> 00:45:37.072]  It was, like, probably the last place I would've thought there would be, like, a police state, uh, control grid there.
[00:45:37.072 --> 00:45:40.934]  You know, because there's probably a population of, like, 50,000 people.
[00:45:40.934 --> 00:45:42.775]  So, which I found really ironic.
[00:45:45.706 --> 00:45:47.387]  I know, my friend, it's bad news.
[00:45:47.387 --> 00:45:49.227]  I appreciate your call.
[00:45:49.227 --> 00:45:55.890]  Now, the most rural areas, you'll be out in the middle of nowhere at a four-way stop, a town that's maybe got six, seven houses in it.
[00:45:55.890 --> 00:46:07.495]  There'll be four-way stop cameras, high-power digital face scan, biometric walk scan, license plate scan, all Pentagon-run.
[00:46:07.495 --> 00:46:09.375]  Pentagon openly brags about it.
[00:46:09.375 --> 00:46:10.656]  God-like control.
[00:46:10.656 --> 00:46:12.857]  Because they're control freaks.
[00:46:15.014 --> 00:46:24.679]  And the Pentagon boys line up and take their shots, and they die of their cancer like they're supposed to, and they drink their fluoride water and say, YES SIR!
[00:46:24.679 --> 00:46:29.162]  So do the police, because it's all part of being part of the power structure.
[00:46:29.162 --> 00:46:30.963]  All part of laughing at Alex Jones.
[00:46:30.963 --> 00:46:33.004]  It's so funny.
[00:46:33.004 --> 00:46:38.286]  But it is 2009, boys, and you're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:46:38.286 --> 00:46:40.428]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[00:46:40.428 --> 00:46:41.968]  Let's talk to Joe in Texas.
[00:46:41.968 --> 00:46:42.769]  Joe, you're on the air.
[00:46:44.267 --> 00:46:45.568]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[00:46:45.568 --> 00:46:47.850]  Doing alright.
[00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:49.631]  Listen, a couple of things I wanted to mention.
[00:46:49.631 --> 00:46:54.955]  First of all, I think intelligence and information is very important.
[00:46:54.955 --> 00:46:59.118]  I know you touched base on it the other day.
[00:46:59.118 --> 00:47:07.044]  And anybody out there that has access to certain information that the public should know should get it out.
[00:47:07.044 --> 00:47:12.968]  And one thing I wanted to tell you that I saw a few years ago
[00:47:13.621 --> 00:47:13.761]  Yeah.
[00:47:34.429 --> 00:47:40.792]  With Schwarzkopf and his cabinet members and Saddam Hussein and his cabinet members all meeting together.
[00:47:40.792 --> 00:47:42.493]  Another guy was sitting there looking at that.
[00:47:42.493 --> 00:47:44.894]  He goes, Oh, you should turn that into a spy magazine.
[00:47:44.894 --> 00:47:46.635]  The guy was like, no way.
[00:47:46.635 --> 00:47:48.036]  He goes, I don't want to get killed.
[00:47:48.036 --> 00:47:58.001]  You know, and you know, I tell people all the time, people say to me, they say, look, uh, you shouldn't be talking about all this stuff, you know, about 9-11 and such and such.
[00:47:58.001 --> 00:48:00.342]  I don't say, look, I'd rather die a free man.
[00:48:01.049 --> 00:48:02.030]  Yeah, we've had Anderson on here.
[00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:04.151]  He's the guy that got beat up by the 100 mile deep checkpoint.
[00:48:26.812 --> 00:48:27.994]  Yes sir, and I remember that.
[00:48:27.994 --> 00:48:34.424]  I had started listening to him a few months or so before that happened, and I was very surprised when I heard about it.
[00:48:34.424 --> 00:48:41.595]  And so anyway, I was the last caller to call in and I said to Steve, because Steve's a post-tribulationist, and I told Steve, I said,
[00:48:42.358 --> 00:48:49.908]  You know, the problem with the church today is so many people in the church are so wrapped up in the pre-trib stuff that they don't believe they're even going to be here when this happens.
[00:48:49.908 --> 00:48:59.180]  No, that's why the media gave it all attention and sold a hundred million books for Tim LaHaye and all those guys is because that was never taught until a hundred years ago.
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:00.341]  It's totally made up.
[00:49:00.862 --> 00:49:05.989]  And I talk to these little church ladies, you know, with their hair all done, and they go, Praise God, it's the end!
[00:49:05.989 --> 00:49:08.513]  I'll be teleported out soon!
[00:49:08.513 --> 00:49:10.836]  Uh, no you're not, lady.
[00:49:10.836 --> 00:49:18.006]  And so, it's just the ultimate delusion, and so they're standing down, because their churches are openly run by the federal government.
[00:49:19.025 --> 00:49:19.485]  Yes, sir.
[00:49:19.485 --> 00:49:23.426]  And see, the thing is, though, him and Katherine Albright got to talking about it.
[00:49:23.426 --> 00:49:27.408]  He brought that up and she wanted to talk to him more about it after the program.
[00:49:27.408 --> 00:49:29.508]  She's on the same sheet of music, apparently.
[00:49:29.508 --> 00:49:43.553]  But the other thing I was going to ask is if you ever thought about doing a video on how some of these big church leaders like Rick Warren, Joel Osteen, even John Hagee have people like McCain, Obama, and all these people in their churches.
[00:49:43.553 --> 00:49:48.074]  And I get so sick of hearing this conservative Christian crap that
[00:49:48.644 --> 00:49:50.506]  It's like, you know what guys?
[00:49:50.506 --> 00:49:52.568]  These guys are part of it too, you know?
[00:49:52.568 --> 00:49:54.450]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:57.753]  What did Pat Robertson say when Obama was elected?
[00:49:57.753 --> 00:50:02.798]  He said, it's of the Lord, socialism is good, America will accept it.
[00:50:04.617 --> 00:50:07.159]  And that he thinks Obama's good.
[00:50:07.159 --> 00:50:08.820]  And he said, it's for ordained.
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:10.080]  It is of God.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.161]  Stand down.
[00:50:11.161 --> 00:50:15.283]  He might as well have been in a Borg outfit saying, resistance is futile.
[00:50:15.283 --> 00:50:17.605]  And that's what all the big Christian leaders said.
[00:50:17.605 --> 00:50:20.186]  They said, do what the President says.
[00:50:20.186 --> 00:50:21.127]  It is ordained.
[00:50:21.127 --> 00:50:23.088]  It is of the Lord.
[00:50:23.088 --> 00:50:24.829]  Stand down, G.I.
[00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:26.710]  Lay down, G.I.
[00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:29.192]  Do what we say.
[00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:31.273]  They're openly on government payroll.
[00:50:33.908 --> 00:50:35.309]  Because they never get audited.
[00:50:35.309 --> 00:50:36.829]  They never get messed with.
[00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:50.454]  And the preachers can dress like little pimps in their little suits and have their little info babe wives and little pinky rings and... They are bought and paid for intellectual and spiritual prostitutes.
[00:50:50.454 --> 00:50:54.156]  They are demons of the pit of Hades.
[00:50:54.156 --> 00:50:56.917]  And they sit there lying to their flock.
[00:50:56.917 --> 00:50:57.957]  That's their job.
[00:50:57.957 --> 00:50:59.338]  They work for old Stretch.
[00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:03.812]  Recognize that sound?
[00:51:03.812 --> 00:51:08.617]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are ending up.
[00:51:08.617 --> 00:51:11.059]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[00:51:11.059 --> 00:51:16.385]  According to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[00:51:16.385 --> 00:51:21.791]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet.
[00:51:21.791 --> 00:51:24.914]  In fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets.
[00:51:25.194 --> 00:51:25.535]  I think so.
[00:51:40.191 --> 00:51:40.691]  1-800-210-1922.
[00:51:40.691 --> 00:51:49.675]  The first 300 callers will receive a free copy of my best-selling CD, America's Unbalanced Diet.
[00:51:49.675 --> 00:51:52.897]  Isn't it time you stop flushing your vitamins down the toilet?
[00:51:52.897 --> 00:51:53.177]  1-800-210-1922.
[00:51:53.177 --> 00:51:54.097]  Or go to orderchoose.com.
[00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:06.888]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:06.888 --> 00:52:14.472]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:14.472 --> 00:52:20.636]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.056 --> 00:52:23.038]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.038 --> 00:52:25.540]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:37.108]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.108 --> 00:52:38.790]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:40.651]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:40.651 --> 00:52:46.876]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:47.552 --> 00:52:55.824]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:55.824 --> 00:52:57.386]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.386 --> 00:52:58.587]  The people strike back!
[00:53:01.005 --> 00:53:06.527]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:53:06.527 --> 00:53:07.307]  and the world.
[00:53:07.307 --> 00:53:11.169]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:53:11.169 --> 00:53:17.671]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:53:17.671 --> 00:53:19.692]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:53:19.692 --> 00:53:24.934]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[00:53:25.134 --> 00:53:27.917]  With double enamel cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:53:27.917 --> 00:53:32.623]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:53:32.623 --> 00:53:38.450]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:40.352]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:53:40.612 --> 00:53:41.833]  People always ask why I print every story.
[00:54:09.344 --> 00:54:20.996]  Because they pull stories and Fox News, Aping and others pulled the flesh-eating robot story with the Pentagon developing robots that feed themselves off enemies.
[00:54:20.996 --> 00:54:25.700]  Which of course is a violation of the rule of law and the rules of war.
[00:54:26.971 --> 00:54:35.975]  The Geneva Convention, but if you're going to torture people and torture their kids in front of them to get answers, as the Pentagon admits, why not have the robots feed on dead bodies?
[00:54:35.975 --> 00:54:39.296]  I mean, they all see us as human resources anyways.
[00:54:39.296 --> 00:54:42.218]  That's the big bioethicist eugenics terms.
[00:54:42.218 --> 00:54:43.338]  See, everything's eugenics.
[00:54:43.338 --> 00:54:45.039]  The terms they use in business, everything.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:47.480]  Well guess what?
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.841]  We printed two copies of it.
[00:54:48.841 --> 00:54:50.001]  We happen to have it.
[00:54:50.001 --> 00:54:55.082]  We're going to have to scan that up on the web and point out that it was censored for some reason.
[00:54:55.082 --> 00:55:01.384]  Because it did have the company bragging that it could eat dead bodies.
[00:55:01.384 --> 00:55:02.945]  And then magically they took it down.
[00:55:02.945 --> 00:55:05.506]  But we printed it.
[00:55:05.506 --> 00:55:07.586]  So I'll have to, when we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:55:11.462 --> 00:55:15.644]  Coming up in about 35 minutes, we'll go live and we have Ted Pycon with us.
[00:55:15.644 --> 00:55:16.304]  I'm gonna go over that.
[00:55:16.304 --> 00:55:19.946]  Then Rand Paul, Robert Wilcox, and others.
[00:55:19.946 --> 00:55:24.268]  And of course your phone calls coming up right now, in fact.
[00:55:24.268 --> 00:55:27.549]  Who is first here?
[00:55:27.549 --> 00:55:31.751]  Daniel in California, you're on the air Daniel, welcome.
[00:55:31.751 --> 00:55:32.792]  Hey Alex.
[00:55:32.792 --> 00:55:32.912]  Hi.
[00:55:32.912 --> 00:55:39.335]  Just wanted to send some great kudos to Jason Burmas and to you specifically, just
[00:55:40.137 --> 00:55:44.479]  Woke me up completely about two years ago when I saw loose change.
[00:55:44.479 --> 00:55:49.942]  Then I ended up watching just about every other program that you guys have put together.
[00:55:49.942 --> 00:55:50.843]  So keep that up.
[00:55:50.843 --> 00:55:57.046]  And I've been sharing this information for at least two years now.
[00:55:57.046 --> 00:56:02.909]  And I'm part of a few organizations now that I never actually thought about before that.
[00:56:02.909 --> 00:56:05.910]  Been in the food industry for 20 years.
[00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:09.172]  Engineering, generally speaking, and plant-wide operations.
[00:56:10.021 --> 00:56:22.165]  And I can, without a doubt, let you know that all of the things that you talk about, the things that are in these videos, absolutely hit the mark.
[00:56:22.165 --> 00:56:23.486]  They hit the mark.
[00:56:23.486 --> 00:56:35.610]  And what happened along the way was I started looking up in the sky and started doing monitoring on all of the spraying that goes on in the skies here in the Central Valley.
[00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:38.671]  So I got hooked up with the California Skywatch
[00:56:39.321 --> 00:56:47.571]  And so basically I do logs on all of these items and call specific organizations that I've finally found.
[00:56:47.571 --> 00:56:51.236]  Well, for those that don't know, yes, you're finding like-minded people.
[00:56:52.472 --> 00:56:57.054]  And there's nothing better than that camaraderie and those soulmates in this fight for freedom.
[00:56:57.054 --> 00:57:01.937]  But our team is in California right now with California Skywatch.
[00:57:01.937 --> 00:57:07.960]  And California Skywatch and Skywatch around the world, just like we are, change is spreading everywhere.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:13.923]  InfoWars groups, Liberty Committee groups.
[00:57:13.923 --> 00:57:15.284]  Whatever you do, just start a group.
[00:57:16.212 --> 00:57:18.534]  Yes, and I take it to an extra level.
[00:57:43.402 --> 00:58:11.370]  level I started taking samples and started sampling the water because I've done that in my career over time I always had to sample all the water that we used but I actually found the exact the exact items that are that are being discussed so anybody who who has any doubt about this going on it there is no doubt it is a fact there are there are no myths this is no theory there are no theories anymore and I just want to
[00:58:11.949 --> 00:58:20.394]  Make sure that I stress, I have been over time focusing on communicating to people, becoming a blogger.
[00:58:20.394 --> 00:58:22.655]  I never thought I would be doing this in my life.
[00:58:22.655 --> 00:58:23.476]  Oh, what's your blog?
[00:58:23.476 --> 00:58:24.757]  Tell us about it.
[00:58:24.757 --> 00:58:26.598]  No, I'm basically an objective blogger.
[00:58:26.598 --> 00:58:28.039]  I don't blog.
[00:58:28.039 --> 00:58:29.019]  I don't have one.
[00:58:29.019 --> 00:58:32.721]  What I do is I go out and I basically make factual content.
[00:58:32.721 --> 00:58:33.322]  No, I understand.
[00:58:33.322 --> 00:58:34.362]  You give the data to folks.
[00:58:34.362 --> 00:58:35.543]  Well, listen.
[00:58:35.543 --> 00:58:40.326]  We've actually got our people meeting with fish and wildlife officials that are talking about chemtrails.
[00:58:42.935 --> 00:58:45.417]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.417 --> 00:58:50.681]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.681 --> 00:58:55.905]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:58:55.905 --> 00:58:59.927]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.927 --> 00:59:05.832]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.832 --> 00:59:10.895]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.895 --> 00:59:11.396]  Number three,
[00:59:11.796 --> 00:59:18.104]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:59:18.104 --> 00:59:21.008]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:59:21.008 --> 00:59:25.533]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:25.533 --> 00:59:29.138]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:59:29.358 --> 00:59:35.080]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:39.782]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:39.782 --> 00:59:41.563]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:41.563 --> 00:59:44.144]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[00:59:44.144 --> 00:59:53.408]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[00:59:53.408 --> 00:59:55.789]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:58.570]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:10.027]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.027 --> 01:00:11.608]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.169]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.169 --> 01:00:17.350]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:25.114]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.114 --> 01:00:28.735]  Well, we are Change Los Angeles, New York.
[01:00:28.735 --> 01:00:32.077]  And other We Are Change groups are just knocking it out of the park again with 9-11 Truth.
[01:00:33.598 --> 01:00:46.502]  The last two weeks, on and off, they have been at the Capitol giving big, thick stacks of documents, peer-reviewed journals of thermite and thermate explosions in the buildings to members of the House and Senate.
[01:00:46.502 --> 01:00:49.103]  They've also been spending time in the office buildings.
[01:00:49.103 --> 01:00:54.785]  I mean, anybody can go in, get passes, get in to see them.
[01:00:54.785 --> 01:01:01.307]  And you see Jay Rockefeller, the great-grandson of the founder of the whole criminal enterprise, Big Eugenicist himself,
[01:01:03.166 --> 01:01:19.056]  Admitting that their offices are besieged by 30, 40 plus people talking about the Bilderberg Group and that everywhere he goes that him and Schumer are being asked about the New World Order.
[01:01:19.056 --> 01:01:23.980]  You see, they can try to intimidate us and say we're all under surveillance and there's a police state and they're going to get us all.
[01:01:24.969 --> 01:01:31.893]  But if we all, that is larger numbers of us, start standing up and saying no and getting involved, they can't get everybody.
[01:01:31.893 --> 01:01:35.815]  I mean just six months ago, you'd have a couple members of Congress getting in Bernanke's face.
[01:01:35.815 --> 01:01:37.116]  Now they're all doing it.
[01:01:37.116 --> 01:01:38.737]  Republican and Democrat.
[01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:40.417]  I want to talk more about this later in the show.
[01:01:40.417 --> 01:01:41.958]  It's just we're reaching the tipping point.
[01:01:41.958 --> 01:01:43.039]  We can beat these people.
[01:01:43.639 --> 01:02:02.793]  The technocracy can fall, the nightmare can end, if we just stop believing the government-controlled churches that say it's all a foregone conclusion, it's the end of the world, give in, the devil's gonna rule, it's a giant predictive programming PSYOP.
[01:02:02.793 --> 01:02:11.959]  And like Nineveh, we can get a reprieve, but if we start believing evils here, and if we start capitulating to it, and saying it's unstoppable, it will manifest!
[01:02:16.044 --> 01:02:19.291]  And I'm not getting into a pro-Christian, anti-Christian debate.
[01:02:19.291 --> 01:02:23.260]  I myself am a Christian, raised a Christian, but this is a secular news program.
[01:02:24.943 --> 01:02:36.886]  And whether you're an atheist, or an agnostic, or a Christian, or a Hindu, or a Muslim, or a Jew, or a Newen Indian, or a Hopi Indian, you shouldn't like the tyranny that's unfolding.
[01:02:36.886 --> 01:02:39.646]  It isn't good any way you slice it or dice it.
[01:02:39.646 --> 01:02:53.990]  I'm just tired of having this wider debate and say, man, listen, the Pentagon says they're building a giant control grid, and it's run by eugenicists, and once the New World Order's in place, they're gonna forcibly sterilize us and put drugs in the water and take all our kids and raise them in giant dormitories.
[01:02:54.890 --> 01:02:58.957]  And, uh, the more internal documents say they're gonna release bioweapons and go ahead and just kill us.
[01:02:58.957 --> 01:03:00.499]  Forget sterilizing us.
[01:03:00.499 --> 01:03:05.847]  We better do something about this, and the evidence is they are poisoning the water in the food, and here's the evidence.
[01:03:05.847 --> 01:03:07.811]  I mean, this is a mayday situation!
[01:03:11.089 --> 01:03:18.993]  And the only normal response is going down to the Senate office building and waiting for Rockefeller to come slinking by and to get in his face peaceably.
[01:03:18.993 --> 01:03:21.494]  And to bring up real issues to this bastard.
[01:03:21.494 --> 01:03:24.836]  Boy, he looks at Luke and he says, you got a lot of balls, kid.
[01:03:24.836 --> 01:03:26.837]  You ought to be in Congress.
[01:03:26.837 --> 01:03:29.398]  See, he gets the mafia respect.
[01:03:29.398 --> 01:03:38.242]  Because Luke's talking about his family creating eugenics and creating Hitler, which is mainline encyclopedia Britannica.
[01:03:38.242 --> 01:03:39.563]  I mean, it's not debatable.
[01:03:40.646 --> 01:03:44.868]  These people are Hellforce!
[01:03:44.868 --> 01:03:48.089]  And Luke's gone to Rockefeller's house and confronted him.
[01:03:48.089 --> 01:03:51.991]  David, the head of the whole thing, probably one of the most powerful people.
[01:03:51.991 --> 01:03:53.552]  He's guaranteed in the top five.
[01:03:53.552 --> 01:03:59.914]  Maybe the most powerful person on the planet.
[01:03:59.914 --> 01:04:03.316]  And Luke gets death threats, his family gets death threats.
[01:04:03.316 --> 01:04:06.657]  On video, police come up and say, we're gonna plant bombs on you.
[01:04:06.657 --> 01:04:07.738]  That's in Truth Rising.
[01:04:09.181 --> 01:04:10.682]  And we need more of you to do this.
[01:04:10.682 --> 01:04:17.727]  Believe me, that's all I want to be doing, but I'm tied down, you know, doing the radio show, the films, trying to just go through all this great material.
[01:04:17.727 --> 01:04:20.669]  I've kind of graduated onto general level here.
[01:04:20.669 --> 01:04:22.170]  Believe me, I don't like being a general.
[01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:25.832]  I wish I was in the field, and I am in the field some.
[01:04:25.832 --> 01:04:28.114]  When we are in the field, I have the army watching me.
[01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:30.396]  Those documents have been declassified.
[01:04:30.396 --> 01:04:32.357]  Listing me as a terrorist.
[01:04:32.357 --> 01:04:35.059]  I mean, this is the real deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:37.720]  So that's coming up.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.361]  I'm going to play that video and analyze it.
[01:04:39.361 --> 01:04:42.242]  It's got a bunch of other news.
[01:04:42.242 --> 01:04:48.925]  By the way, we did find the article about military, upcoming military robot could feed on dead bodies.
[01:04:48.925 --> 01:04:55.608]  We're going to do a blurb about the memory hole in media, but this is an example, and these flesh-eating robots.
[01:04:55.608 --> 01:04:56.549]  That's coming up.
[01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:57.269]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:57.269 --> 01:04:58.730]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:05:00.776 --> 01:05:02.457]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:02.457 --> 01:05:07.219]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:05:07.219 --> 01:05:10.161]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:05:10.161 --> 01:05:13.223]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:05:13.223 --> 01:05:19.066]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:05:19.286 --> 01:05:22.530]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:05:22.530 --> 01:05:29.519]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:05:29.519 --> 01:05:32.824]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[01:06:00.452 --> 01:06:04.696]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:06:04.696 --> 01:06:06.698]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:06:06.698 --> 01:06:15.227]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:06:15.227 --> 01:06:20.772]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:06:20.772 --> 01:06:22.394]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:06:22.634 --> 01:06:29.140]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:40.191]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:06:40.191 --> 01:06:40.971]  That's right.
[01:06:40.971 --> 01:06:43.534]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:06:43.534 --> 01:06:45.135]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[01:06:47.677 --> 01:06:50.859]  That's 1-800-691-6043.

[01:07:00.863 --> 01:07:04.605]  ...MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[01:07:04.605 --> 01:07:07.166]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[01:07:07.166 --> 01:07:16.630]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:17.231]  We're good to go.
[01:07:35.846 --> 01:07:46.408]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[01:07:46.408 --> 01:07:50.429]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[01:07:50.429 --> 01:07:53.430]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:57.210]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[01:07:57.210 --> 01:07:59.671]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[01:08:00.836 --> 01:08:06.242]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.242 --> 01:08:11.347]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:11.347 --> 01:08:15.091]  Pastor Ted Pike in about 25 minutes from now.
[01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:19.236]  Latest on the attacks on free speech, the hate bills, the cyberbullying, all of it.
[01:08:22.233 --> 01:08:34.076]  Then we've got Rand Paul joining us in the third hour, and Robert Wilcox for about 30 minutes in the fourth, continuing with open phones throughout the broadcast today.
[01:08:34.076 --> 01:08:43.059]  Coming up, I'm going to do a big news blitz, financial news, and the censorship of the flesh-eating robot story that was in AP, Reuters, Fox News.
[01:08:43.059 --> 01:08:49.261]  It changed everywhere in a few days, saying, hey, the company wants you to know they're vegetarian robots.
[01:08:49.261 --> 01:08:50.001]  But originally,
[01:08:51.089 --> 01:08:57.354]  The story was saying that it could eat flesh or anything else for that matter.
[01:08:57.354 --> 01:09:02.258]  So we'll go over the story.
[01:09:02.258 --> 01:09:05.320]  The robot's called the Eater.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:11.765]  But this is a good way to get people's attention about why the elite want to go to a robot force.
[01:09:11.765 --> 01:09:12.586]  And this is not the 1950s.
[01:09:12.586 --> 01:09:14.567]  This isn't science fiction, folks.
[01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:14.667]  It's 2009.
[01:09:16.914 --> 01:09:23.756]  It was science fiction a hundred years ago to imagine big jet airplanes flying above you at 30,000 feet.
[01:09:23.756 --> 01:09:28.417]  We're living in just an age of wonderment, but so much of it's being used for tyranny.
[01:09:28.417 --> 01:09:29.617]  So that's coming up.
[01:09:29.617 --> 01:09:31.557]  Let's just blitz through your calls right now.
[01:09:31.557 --> 01:09:34.518]  Let's talk to Brian in Florida.
[01:09:34.518 --> 01:09:35.538]  Brian, you're on the air.
[01:09:35.538 --> 01:09:38.259]  Hi, yes, Alex.
[01:09:38.259 --> 01:09:39.399]  Hi.
[01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:41.780]  I just want to give you some good news.
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:46.481]  Just last week, I was appointed to the library board district.
[01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:49.103]  The district library board.
[01:09:49.796 --> 01:09:51.597]  And I have some plans.
[01:09:51.597 --> 01:09:54.098]  I want to make sure there's a screening room in there.
[01:09:54.098 --> 01:10:01.240]  I want to perhaps have, like, once a week, they'll play a film from the library and try to get in some books and DVDs.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.701]  And actually make the library become a center of the community.
[01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:18.726]  Yeah, you could start having one night a week of viewing event, even if they don't let you, you can do it as a private citizen, and then others will get the idea, and then suddenly you'll have citizens together talking every night instead of watching the glowing,
[01:10:19.286 --> 01:10:20.047]  I don't think so.
[01:10:37.919 --> 01:10:44.702]  Yeah, the general way to talk about this is, I've noticed when I have hosts fill in who are from here locally, they kind of talk about local stuff all day.
[01:10:44.702 --> 01:10:49.583]  The way to do it is to say, I got on my board here locally, you should get on your board in your city.
[01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:14.878]  And there are these openings everywhere, and the globalists only need a few of their people over each city, and then they get all their minions in the positions of power over every sector.
[01:11:14.878 --> 01:11:20.562]  And a lot of times, no matter what area of government you get into, you're going to find that government's stealing money.
[01:11:20.562 --> 01:11:27.708]  And so you can also get into government and find them stealing, blow the whistle, and then start a chain reaction, bringing down the local government.
[01:11:28.257 --> 01:11:36.563]  Let me tell you, we need good people in Dog Catcher, we need good people in the Water Board, the School Board, the Library Board, the Park Board.
[01:11:36.563 --> 01:11:42.547]  The Sustainability UN people have unlimited funds under Agenda 21.
[01:11:42.547 --> 01:11:48.331]  This is the big 1992 UN agreement of how to globalize every county and city under munialization.
[01:11:49.191 --> 01:11:53.993]  And that's how you have standardized zoning all over the world.
[01:11:53.993 --> 01:11:56.874]  From Kenya, Africa to Austin, Texas.
[01:11:56.874 --> 01:11:59.715]  From Albuquerque, New Mexico to New York City.
[01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:04.097]  From Berlin, Germany to Tokyo, Japan.
[01:12:04.097 --> 01:12:07.598]  It's global standardization.
[01:12:07.598 --> 01:12:08.638]  And it's all being done.
[01:12:08.638 --> 01:12:09.759]  I appreciate your call.
[01:12:09.759 --> 01:12:11.700]  Keep it up, Brian.
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.320]  Let's talk to Johnny in Florida.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.301]  Another call from Florida.
[01:12:14.301 --> 01:12:14.961]  Go ahead, Johnny.
[01:12:15.782 --> 01:12:17.543]  Hey, what's going on?
[01:12:17.543 --> 01:12:21.126]  I just wanted to real quickly say thank you very much, Alex.
[01:12:21.126 --> 01:12:26.711]  Since watching the Obama deception, my life has been turned completely upside down.
[01:12:26.711 --> 01:12:38.821]  Everything I once thought I believed about our government is proven to be untrue, and it's not just from watching the videos, it's from doing the research after watching the videos and learning about what really is going on out there.
[01:12:40.714 --> 01:12:57.399]  But the real reason for my call is because Johnny's not my real name but I do work for Bright House Networks in Florida and when I saw the story on InfoWars today it really stuck out at me and it made sense because last week every employee was given papers
[01:12:58.206 --> 01:13:03.769]  Saying we are not allowed to talk about our company to anybody on our MySpaces, on our Twitters.
[01:13:03.769 --> 01:13:10.552]  We're not allowed to talk about our political affiliations or anything like that.
[01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:14.233]  And everybody in the company was like, why are we having to fill these papers out?
[01:13:14.233 --> 01:13:15.434]  We've been working there for a long time.
[01:13:15.774 --> 01:13:18.215]  Yeah, everything's a chilling effect.
[01:13:18.215 --> 01:13:22.876]  Just like you can't have a liberal or conservative kiosk at a mall.
[01:13:22.876 --> 01:13:24.197]  They're banning them all.
[01:13:24.197 --> 01:13:28.038]  And you can't wear a shirt that says peace or with a dove on it.
[01:13:28.038 --> 01:13:32.099]  The cops are coming up and saying, take that off, it's a protest, unauthorized.
[01:13:32.099 --> 01:13:36.421]  They're letting everybody know that you lose your job if you speak out.
[01:13:36.421 --> 01:13:38.441]  It's an attempt at a chilling effect.
[01:13:38.441 --> 01:13:40.422]  We've all got to speak out.
[01:13:40.942 --> 01:13:48.049]  Or America dies, the bankers win, they get to carry out the eugenics shop, but tell folks more about it.
[01:13:48.049 --> 01:14:03.665]  Well, basically what's going on with Bright House Network, we have been getting some training about, even on, they say it's for field tech, but even the operant, we've been getting training on listening for different things in the background when we're talking to people on the phones.
[01:14:04.469 --> 01:14:17.822]  Um, babies crying, ask questions why babies might be crying, you know, different things, um, if someone sounds stressed out, make sure everything's okay with them, and they're saying it's just for the, you know, because some people get stressed out about their cable, but it doesn't make sense.
[01:14:17.822 --> 01:14:25.610]  Let me stop you, let me tell you, let me tell you, how do you introduce to a country that was once free to be Stasi secret police spies?
[01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:26.972]  How does it happen?
[01:14:26.972 --> 01:14:28.013]  They always say,
[01:14:29.448 --> 01:14:41.177]  Well, nationwide and worldwide, like the New York Times reported, they tell the middle schoolers, and even younger, but by middle school, they write mock tickets to mommy for leaving the water on while she brushes her teeth.
[01:14:41.177 --> 01:14:44.559]  Mock tickets to mommy for taking a hot bath.
[01:14:44.559 --> 01:14:55.147]  And the parents are in the New York Times and the Washington Post and these articles that we've read on air, going, oh, I'm so glad my daughter, my nine-year-old daughter, my ten-year-old daughter is reporting me now
[01:14:56.008 --> 01:14:58.990]  It's so good she's helping me lower my carbon footprint.
[01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:01.172]  It's put out there like it's normal.
[01:15:01.172 --> 01:15:07.876]  And so the way they turn everybody into a spy, it's just, oh, you're a social worker now.
[01:15:07.876 --> 01:15:10.878]  You've got to listen for what's in the background.
[01:15:10.878 --> 01:15:16.522]  And so if somebody, if you hear somebody yell at their kid, the CPS now says that's abuse.
[01:15:16.522 --> 01:15:17.623]  I have the Texas Handbook.
[01:15:17.623 --> 01:15:22.326]  They tried to steal one of our employees' kids and they said, yelling, we take your kids.
[01:15:22.326 --> 01:15:25.288]  There's no law, but still the police follow orders and come and take them.
[01:15:26.068 --> 01:15:30.569]  And so they're getting ready to totally convert the economy to police state.
[01:15:30.569 --> 01:15:45.374]  And so everyone, cable workers, carpet cleaners, operators on the phone, I've seen reports where they're training the Indian people in India, 8,000 miles away, to spy and listen to what's happening in your house.
[01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:53.376]  Google's announced the cameras and microphones in your computers, they're using that to listen to your home, and just openly announcing it like it's no big deal.
[01:15:54.016 --> 01:15:55.457]  And so, yes.
[01:15:55.457 --> 01:15:59.519]  But at first, just ask if they're okay and go ahead and make a note of it.
[01:15:59.519 --> 01:16:06.262]  And then next it's, go ahead and, you know, oh, now we're going to have you listen to the recordings, because they're recording what's going on.
[01:16:06.262 --> 01:16:08.523]  And so, this is their pretext.
[01:16:08.523 --> 01:16:09.763]  But I'm going to shut up.
[01:16:09.763 --> 01:16:11.424]  Go ahead and tell us what else they're telling you to do.
[01:16:12.148 --> 01:16:17.072]  Well, I actually got a run out, but I just wanted to say keep up the fight.
[01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:21.095]  I definitely believe eugenics is the most sinister thing I've ever heard about.
[01:16:21.095 --> 01:16:23.477]  The more I read about it, the more it makes me sick.
[01:16:23.477 --> 01:16:29.401]  But I am a believer, and I know God's in control of everything in the end, and we will win the fight.
[01:16:29.401 --> 01:16:29.821]  Hold on.
[01:16:29.821 --> 01:16:31.743]  I know you've been holding for 30 minutes to get on.
[01:16:31.743 --> 01:16:32.123]  Hold on.
[01:16:32.123 --> 01:16:32.343]  Hold on.
[01:16:32.343 --> 01:16:33.164]  Are you at work right now?
[01:16:34.144 --> 01:16:35.945]  No, I'm about to take a shower so I can get to work.
[01:16:35.945 --> 01:16:39.868]  I know you gotta go, but you can be five minutes late here.
[01:16:39.868 --> 01:16:41.649]  Specifically, I'm gonna shut up here.
[01:16:41.649 --> 01:16:43.410]  We're about to go to break, but just tell me.
[01:16:43.410 --> 01:16:50.115]  Specifically, they're telling you to ask social worker questions, and again, they're easing you in where it sounds reasonable at first.
[01:16:50.115 --> 01:16:51.256]  Specifically, what are they saying?
[01:16:52.179 --> 01:16:54.500]  Well, it's just a training, man.
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:57.201]  It's just training on hearing what's going on with the customer.
[01:16:57.201 --> 01:16:59.021]  It's all done for customer service.
[01:16:59.021 --> 01:17:01.562]  We want to make sure our customers are happy, they're not stressed out.
[01:17:01.562 --> 01:17:03.203]  We deal with a lot of older people.
[01:17:03.203 --> 01:17:06.844]  If you hear a baby crying, well, you know, is everything okay?
[01:17:06.844 --> 01:17:11.585]  You know, when you hear people's stress levels raising up, ask them questions on what's going on.
[01:17:11.585 --> 01:17:13.966]  You know, different things, obviously.
[01:17:13.966 --> 01:17:19.248]  There's key things when they make, you know, threats and things like that, and anger, you know, make sure that
[01:17:19.548 --> 01:17:25.194]  They don't have a weapon on them or they're not going to threaten us, but it's almost sometimes like they want us to get the person to threaten us.
[01:17:25.194 --> 01:17:28.818]  If we would just kind of leave some of the people alone, the people are just pissed because their cable is not working.
[01:17:28.818 --> 01:17:32.081]  Well, have you seen the news where people yell at the customer service?
[01:17:32.081 --> 01:17:33.863]  They're now SWAT teaming them and charging them.
[01:17:33.863 --> 01:17:34.784]  That's ridiculous.
[01:17:34.784 --> 01:17:35.645]  Under terrorism.
[01:17:35.645 --> 01:17:36.966]  But here's the issue.
[01:17:36.966 --> 01:17:40.370]  That's all being recorded and uploaded to the police.
[01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:41.091]  I guarantee it.
[01:17:42.119 --> 01:17:43.840]  Absolutely.
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.642]  Every single call is recorded that I make.
[01:17:46.642 --> 01:17:51.505]  When we're coached on calls, they can pull up every single call that's made within a second.
[01:17:51.505 --> 01:17:53.006]  It's right there in front of them.
[01:17:53.006 --> 01:17:56.028]  What about getting the technicians to spy on people when they're in the homes?
[01:17:57.214 --> 01:18:02.516]  I'm not a technician, so I don't have information on that, but I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:18:02.516 --> 01:18:04.157]  I mean, you know, of course.
[01:18:04.157 --> 01:18:09.279]  And also, I just wanted to say, Bright House is not owned by Time Warner, as some of the people on the website.
[01:18:09.279 --> 01:18:16.961]  It's actually owned by Advanced Newhouse, which is the same company that owns a lot of the major publications, like the Star Ledger and things like that.
[01:18:16.961 --> 01:18:20.943]  So we're owned by Advanced Newhouse.
[01:18:20.943 --> 01:18:23.904]  So Watson's got that part wrong?
[01:18:23.904 --> 01:18:24.064]  Yes.
[01:18:24.557 --> 01:18:25.698]  We'll correct that right now.
[01:18:25.698 --> 01:18:28.881]  Advance... Was it previously owned by Time Warner?
[01:18:28.881 --> 01:18:31.564]  No, we... Cable companies always take over each other.
[01:18:31.564 --> 01:18:35.288]  So, Time Warner was in this area at one time, then we kind of took it over.
[01:18:35.288 --> 01:18:36.609]  That's how cable companies work.
[01:18:36.609 --> 01:18:37.350]  No, I understand who it was.
[01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:39.291]  I actually worked for Comcast for several years, too, so...
[01:18:40.077 --> 01:18:44.479]  I promise y'all I'll do that and I will call back using the Donnie again and let you know about it.
[01:19:04.028 --> 01:19:06.449]  Absolutely, because I am an info warrior.
[01:19:06.449 --> 01:19:12.151]  The people that I used to think were absolute nutjobs is the person I've become now.
[01:19:12.151 --> 01:19:18.654]  It's really kind of freaky to me, but I'm educated enough to not even believe everything you say until I go and research it.
[01:19:18.654 --> 01:19:19.494]  I think that's the main thing.
[01:19:19.494 --> 01:19:21.235]  We have to research everything.
[01:19:21.235 --> 01:19:22.535]  That's the key.
[01:19:22.535 --> 01:19:23.055]  Absolutely.
[01:19:23.055 --> 01:19:23.896]  Thank you so much.
[01:19:24.813 --> 01:19:34.456]  Because I want people to research what I say, because you'll find out I'm about 95% accurate, and we try to tell the truth, and over time we're very, very accurate and have a good track record.
[01:19:34.456 --> 01:19:41.418]  You start researching the establishment, you're gonna find out they're a pack of lying, spinning curves.
[01:19:41.418 --> 01:19:45.199]  Now listen, this is the kind of show I should do.
[01:19:45.199 --> 01:19:50.280]  We ought to do a whole show for four hours just with whistleblowers about spying calling.
[01:19:53.095 --> 01:19:54.476]  Oh man, I'm gonna do that show.
[01:19:54.476 --> 01:20:00.979]  We're gonna start doing these investigative reports where the callers call in and where they also email us the proof.
[01:20:00.979 --> 01:20:05.361]  If you'd like to quit smoking regular cigarettes and try a revolutionary new alternative, this
[01:20:15.026 --> 01:20:15.346]  We're good.
[01:20:25.179 --> 01:20:25.739]  We're good to go.
[01:20:56.553 --> 01:21:07.538]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:21:07.538 --> 01:21:15.662]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:15.662 --> 01:21:21.245]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt?
[01:21:21.565 --> 01:21:23.827]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[01:21:23.827 --> 01:21:28.911]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:28.911 --> 01:21:34.135]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:34.135 --> 01:21:38.498]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:38.498 --> 01:21:39.579]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:39.579 --> 01:21:43.602]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:21:44.062 --> 01:21:48.967]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:21:48.967 --> 01:21:51.970]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:21:51.970 --> 01:21:53.752]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.752 --> 01:21:53.972]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.658 --> 01:22:06.462]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:06.462 --> 01:22:14.047]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:22:14.047 --> 01:22:20.212]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:20.632 --> 01:22:22.613]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:22.613 --> 01:22:25.115]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:25.115 --> 01:22:36.681]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:36.681 --> 01:22:38.362]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:38.362 --> 01:22:40.223]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:40.223 --> 01:22:46.447]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:47.128 --> 01:22:55.395]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:55.395 --> 01:22:56.957]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:56.957 --> 01:22:58.158]  The people strike back!
[01:23:00.086 --> 01:23:00.767]  You worry.
[01:23:00.767 --> 01:23:03.108]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:23:03.108 --> 01:23:03.669]  Hi.
[01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:06.451]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[01:23:06.451 --> 01:23:10.994]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[01:23:10.994 --> 01:23:13.476]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:23:13.476 --> 01:23:16.819]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:23:16.819 --> 01:23:18.760]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.542]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[01:23:21.542 --> 01:23:25.265]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[01:23:25.265 --> 01:23:29.308]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[01:23:29.648 --> 01:23:33.749]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[01:23:33.749 --> 01:23:40.090]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:42.431]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:23:42.431 --> 01:23:44.551]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.
[01:23:44.551 --> 01:23:49.212]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:23:49.212 --> 01:23:50.112]  Start now.
[01:23:50.112 --> 01:23:51.833]  Knowledge is power.
[01:23:51.833 --> 01:23:52.833]  Better take action.
[01:23:52.833 --> 01:23:53.793]  I think a storm's coming.
[01:24:06.496 --> 01:24:14.606]  We're going live in the next segment, 33 After, to be precise, at prisonplanet.tv for the last two and a half hours of this worldwide radio show.
[01:24:14.606 --> 01:24:18.050]  We'll continue with open phones for first-time callers throughout the broadcast at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:23.615 --> 01:24:44.435]  But guys, remind me to start doing investigative report shows, where for, say, three hours of a four-hour show, I just cover one subject, and have a few reporters on about confirmed cases of what we're covering, but then have listeners say, like I'm reading this Fox News story, about cable company employees spying on you, Operation Bright Eyes.
[01:24:45.367 --> 01:24:47.929]  Well, we already know about this, but now it's mainstream news.
[01:24:47.929 --> 01:24:57.437]  Why not have other people call in, trucking companies and other telephone company people, and call in, fake name, whatever, and say, yeah, look into this.
[01:24:57.437 --> 01:24:59.579]  My company's doing that.
[01:24:59.579 --> 01:25:03.302]  Just, you know, we've done a few shows like that years ago, and those are just amazing.
[01:25:03.302 --> 01:25:04.703]  So much info comes out.
[01:25:04.703 --> 01:25:08.546]  So we're going to definitely, starting next week, once a week, we'll do a different subject.
[01:25:09.793 --> 01:25:26.594]  and uh... like i've done shows like send us documents on mass graves and then we get confirmed state of new york secret documents about preparing mass graves for flu going back two years ago and people call the numbers the news then calls the numbers and confirms the documents we got
[01:25:28.689 --> 01:25:30.810]  That's how we break most of the big national stories.
[01:25:30.810 --> 01:25:33.532]  We break is people feeding us the info.
[01:25:33.532 --> 01:25:36.353]  And we can do it live time on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:25:36.353 --> 01:25:41.156]  Have folks sending us documents and we can have a team in there calling the numbers, double-checking the documents.
[01:25:41.156 --> 01:25:42.477]  You know, I got a Homeland Security document.
[01:25:42.477 --> 01:25:43.117]  How do I check it?
[01:25:43.117 --> 01:25:49.561]  I call and say, I've got document Q794LL30- here dealing with this.
[01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:51.922]  This is Alex Jones, GCN Radio Network.
[01:25:51.922 --> 01:25:53.383]  I'd like to confirm this is your document.
[01:25:55.255 --> 01:25:56.496]  How did you get that document?
[01:25:56.496 --> 01:25:57.877]  Who gave that to you?
[01:25:57.877 --> 01:25:59.738]  I'd like to know which agent gave that to you.
[01:25:59.738 --> 01:26:01.620]  Is this yours?
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:02.841]  I'd like to give you a supervisor.
[01:26:02.841 --> 01:26:06.203]  You talk to the supervisor and they say, yes, that's our document.
[01:26:06.203 --> 01:26:18.632]  Or, you can be even more sneaky and just call up and say, yeah, I need another copy of 03Q945-EL399.
[01:26:18.632 --> 01:26:19.673]  Oh boy.
[01:26:19.673 --> 01:26:22.695]  And then people can't believe it always when we break it and then later it comes out it's real.
[01:26:24.636 --> 01:26:25.556]  But I want to do more of that.
[01:26:25.556 --> 01:26:28.837]  Hey, we got Ted Pike coming up.
[01:26:28.837 --> 01:26:35.398]  We might still kill the hate bill, was the headline.
[01:26:35.398 --> 01:26:40.599]  And he has another headline that I want to print that hate bill passes, but not as bad as it first was.
[01:26:40.599 --> 01:26:43.020]  I want to get that second one.
[01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:47.201]  We'll get an update too on the Cyber Bullying Act and the rest of the garbage coming up.
[01:26:47.201 --> 01:26:52.222]  I'm going to continue with your phone calls.
[01:26:52.222 --> 01:26:53.482]  Rand Paul is coming up as well.
[01:26:55.290 --> 01:27:00.713]  But before I do that, I just wanted to briefly put out this announcement.
[01:27:00.713 --> 01:27:06.395]  But I want listeners to please pay attention to what I'm saying because this is very, very important.
[01:27:06.395 --> 01:27:09.837]  Ted Anderson owns Midas Resources.
[01:27:09.837 --> 01:27:13.239]  He's been in gold and silver brokering for now 30 years, 30 years this year.
[01:27:15.259 --> 01:27:21.323]  And Midas Resources has done something that's made it really a leader in gold and silver.
[01:27:21.323 --> 01:27:23.885]  Ted will buy gold and silver when it's low, or when it dips.
[01:27:23.885 --> 01:27:25.866]  It hasn't been low much the last few years.
[01:27:25.866 --> 01:27:29.249]  And then when it goes up, he sells it at a lower price.
[01:27:29.249 --> 01:27:37.674]  But it's been probably five, six months since he had a deal like this, and this is the end of the deal.
[01:27:37.674 --> 01:27:39.435]  He bought gold at the $900 to $910 level.
[01:27:39.435 --> 01:27:41.997]  Some of the gold he bought at the $910, some at the $901 level, he told me.
[01:27:45.549 --> 01:27:49.852]  And so those cost savings are priced in.
[01:27:49.852 --> 01:27:52.773]  The gold he's selling is priced into that level of the market.
[01:27:52.773 --> 01:27:58.397]  When it's $956 right now, up over $50 from when he priced this in.
[01:27:58.397 --> 01:28:00.378]  $956, as I just refreshed, Kitco.
[01:28:00.378 --> 01:28:00.538]  So,
[01:28:10.987 --> 01:28:12.168]  This is the end of that deal.
[01:28:29.753 --> 01:28:34.616]  Put out by the Lakota Nation, pure silver, $99.99, whatever it is.
[01:28:34.616 --> 01:28:35.556]  $19.33.
[01:28:35.556 --> 01:28:42.059]  So that went up, but he is at the absolute tail end of francs at the old price.
[01:28:42.059 --> 01:28:44.521]  This has not gone up, but this is the end.
[01:28:44.521 --> 01:28:46.001]  The silver, it's over.
[01:28:46.001 --> 01:28:46.882]  Still got a great deal on it.
[01:28:47.970 --> 01:28:51.972]  The Franks are $216, and the Sovereigns are $266.
[01:28:51.972 --> 01:28:59.535]  Those are just fabulous deals on gold at bullion-level pricing when the market was lower, and these are even semi-nuismatic.
[01:28:59.535 --> 01:29:00.755]  They have some collector value.
[01:29:00.755 --> 01:29:03.277]  A lot of them are 100 years old.
[01:29:03.277 --> 01:29:04.737]  European.
[01:29:04.737 --> 01:29:07.138]  So, this is the end of that deal.
[01:29:07.138 --> 01:29:10.660]  If you want to get gold cheaper than I can find it anywhere else,
[01:29:11.493 --> 01:29:11.613]  800-686-2237.
[01:29:11.613 --> 01:29:11.873]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:29:11.873 --> 01:29:15.198]  And Ted said he's holding it through till tonight.
[01:29:15.198 --> 01:29:17.100]  And then it's definitely gone.
[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:18.342]  800-686-2237 on the Franks at 216.
[01:29:18.342 --> 01:29:18.963]  Incredible deal.
[01:29:30.157 --> 01:29:32.238]  The market's now over 50 bucks higher.
[01:29:32.238 --> 01:29:35.298]  And Sovereign's at $2.66.
[01:29:35.298 --> 01:29:36.719]  Excellent deal as well.
[01:29:36.719 --> 01:29:39.720]  And the Lakotas have gone up, but not much.
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:43.161]  $19.53 now for each coin.
[01:29:43.161 --> 01:29:44.501]  800-686-2237.
[01:29:44.501 --> 01:29:47.122]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:29:47.122 --> 01:29:47.942]  Get them today.
[01:29:47.942 --> 01:29:51.323]  The brokers are there right now.
[01:29:51.323 --> 01:29:52.723]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.723 --> 01:29:55.244]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.244 --> 01:29:57.945]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.694 --> 01:30:06.556]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[01:30:06.556 --> 01:30:07.856]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:30:07.856 --> 01:30:12.137]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[01:30:12.137 --> 01:30:13.998]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:30:13.998 --> 01:30:20.300]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:24.301]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:30:24.301 --> 01:30:26.042]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:30:26.042 --> 01:30:30.764]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price, and their formula really works.
[01:30:30.764 --> 01:30:33.585]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:30:33.585 --> 01:30:39.828]  Try the NutriCafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[01:30:39.828 --> 01:30:42.249]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:30:42.249 --> 01:30:44.710]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:30:44.710 --> 01:30:46.811]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:30:46.811 --> 01:30:48.392]  Go to www.
[01:30:49.833 --> 01:30:52.155]  We're good to go.
[01:31:00.936 --> 01:31:06.120]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:10.163]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:10.163 --> 01:31:16.068]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:16.068 --> 01:31:21.131]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:21.131 --> 01:31:21.592]  Number three,
[01:31:22.032 --> 01:31:28.339]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:31:28.339 --> 01:31:31.242]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:31:31.242 --> 01:31:35.767]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:35.767 --> 01:31:39.371]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:31:39.611 --> 01:31:45.333]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:50.034]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.034 --> 01:31:51.815]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:51.815 --> 01:31:54.375]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[01:31:54.375 --> 01:31:56.996]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[01:32:01.112 --> 01:32:06.998]  Surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight into our bodies.
[01:32:06.998 --> 01:32:08.800]  Take a deep breath.
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:15.287]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone entering your lungs?
[01:32:15.287 --> 01:32:16.849]  Have a glass of water.
[01:32:16.849 --> 01:32:21.954]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous other chemicals?
[01:32:24.292 --> 01:32:24.832]  We're good to go.
[01:32:47.697 --> 01:32:48.197]  I think so.
[01:33:04.053 --> 01:33:07.074]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:33:07.074 --> 01:33:10.575]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:10.575 --> 01:33:26.081]  We're going to Reverend Pastor Ted Pike here in just a moment to cover the frontal assault on the First Amendment.
[01:33:26.081 --> 01:33:28.642]  Not just free speech, but also religion in this country.
[01:33:30.117 --> 01:33:33.098]  So that is coming up in just a moment.
[01:33:33.098 --> 01:33:37.720]  I did want to just add one more thing on that Midas Resources gold and silver offer.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:40.982]  Again, this is gold priced in when the market was $905 to $910 an ounce.
[01:33:40.982 --> 01:33:42.382]  It's $956 today as we speak, Thursday the 23rd day.
[01:33:49.378 --> 01:34:01.563]  of July 2009 and you've got to tell them that it's the Genesis Alex Jones Ted Anderson special when you call to take advantage of that or it will be the newer high prices.
[01:34:01.563 --> 01:34:03.504]  The silver has already gone up since yesterday.
[01:34:03.504 --> 01:34:05.825]  This is the very tail end of getting francs
[01:34:06.545 --> 01:34:08.587]  And Sovereigns at that much lower price.
[01:34:08.587 --> 01:34:10.148]  You cannot beat this deal.
[01:34:10.148 --> 01:34:13.031]  Here is the number again for the brokers.
[01:34:13.031 --> 01:34:27.363]  1-800-686-2237 800-686-2237 But even if you're watching this six months from now on the web at PrisonPlanet.tv, it's always a good time to call Midas Resources, our sponsor.
[01:34:27.363 --> 01:34:28.104]  It's our sponsor.
[01:34:28.104 --> 01:34:29.465]  That's where I get my gold and silver.
[01:34:29.465 --> 01:34:31.267]  It's the best prices out there that I've found.
[01:34:33.015 --> 01:34:38.780]  Also, before we go to Pastor Ted Pike, while we still have some free speech in this country, we're carrying a lot of new books and videos.
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:42.823]  Not just books and videos I've written or produced, but other people's great books and videos.
[01:34:43.797 --> 01:34:46.799]  On the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[01:34:46.799 --> 01:34:52.342]  The latest is Anthrax War, a film by Bob Cohen and Eric Nadler.
[01:34:52.342 --> 01:34:54.983]  And you won't believe the people they got for interviews with this.
[01:34:54.983 --> 01:35:03.388]  You want to know about the real history of anthrax, the government involvement in anthrax, the anthrax attacks, this film is unbelievable.
[01:35:03.388 --> 01:35:06.029]  They're going to be guests very soon on the show.
[01:35:06.029 --> 01:35:09.111]  Anthrax War, just an amazing film.
[01:35:09.111 --> 01:35:11.532]  Available, of course, at
[01:35:14.355 --> 01:35:19.600]  Infowars.com by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.862]  Generation Rx.
[01:35:21.862 --> 01:35:29.068]  This gets into the forced drugging and drugging of the population of the United States and our children and how the psychotropic drugs are causing suicide.
[01:35:29.068 --> 01:35:30.289]  So are the Ritalin-type drugs.
[01:35:30.289 --> 01:35:31.550]  Generation Rx.
[01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:37.335]  Show this to families and friends and people you know that are about to put their kids on these drugs or have already put them on them.
[01:35:37.335 --> 01:35:38.396]  Very important film.
[01:35:38.396 --> 01:35:40.137]  Very professionally produced.
[01:35:40.137 --> 01:35:41.198]  Generation Rx.
[01:35:42.199 --> 01:35:49.123]  The latest Global Warming film, Part 2, by Dr. Michael Kaufman, with an incredible narrator and host.
[01:35:49.123 --> 01:35:52.945]  So you want to get Global Warming, Emerging Science, and Understanding.
[01:35:52.945 --> 01:35:57.487]  It's got a dry title, but very, very powerful information that's available.
[01:35:57.487 --> 01:36:01.990]  This film is free for anybody that gets it with the Obama deception or endgame.
[01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:05.192]  It is the entire unedited interview, the whole thing.
[01:36:05.192 --> 01:36:08.894]  I'd only put about 80% of it out on PrisonPlanet.tv a few years ago before he died.
[01:36:09.574 --> 01:36:10.655]  He's now, of course, deceased.
[01:36:10.655 --> 01:36:16.820]  His last video interview, Aaron Russo, Reflections and Warnings, free at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:18.081]  Has an update by myself.
[01:36:18.081 --> 01:36:19.002]  I'm in the film.
[01:36:19.002 --> 01:36:20.063]  A lot of new documents.
[01:36:20.063 --> 01:36:22.745]  Really, this took us about a month to make.
[01:36:22.745 --> 01:36:24.926]  Kind of a mini-film, but it's over 90 minutes long.
[01:36:24.926 --> 01:36:26.888]  Of course, in-game blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:36:26.888 --> 01:36:28.249]  Everybody's got to have this.
[01:36:28.249 --> 01:36:30.351]  Fabled Enemies, the latest 9-11 info.
[01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:32.653]  Who was really involved, how they carried out the attacks.
[01:36:32.653 --> 01:36:36.836]  Fabled Enemies, I think one of the best 9-11 films, and one of the latest ones out there.
[01:36:36.836 --> 01:36:38.838]  Fabled Enemies by Jason Bermas, all available.
[01:36:40.191 --> 01:36:41.632]  at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:41.632 --> 01:36:44.353]  And then I can't stress enough this film.
[01:36:44.353 --> 01:36:51.177]  I was talking to Gerald Salente, who does foreign, British, French, Russian, Middle Eastern TV, U.S.
[01:36:51.177 --> 01:36:53.098]  television.
[01:36:53.098 --> 01:36:55.499]  He gets interviewed by newspapers every day.
[01:36:55.499 --> 01:37:00.321]  He's all over the cover of the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal.
[01:37:00.321 --> 01:37:03.563]  Trends Forecasting, he said he's never seen anything like it.
[01:37:03.563 --> 01:37:04.383]  He said this off-air.
[01:37:04.383 --> 01:37:07.105]  I said, I wish you would have said that on-air, but at the end of the show he wanted to talk
[01:37:08.052 --> 01:37:09.833]  And the next time he's on, he's going to talk about it.
[01:37:09.833 --> 01:37:12.795]  He said the buzz is insane!
[01:37:12.795 --> 01:37:15.736]  Everywhere he goes, people bring up the Obama deception.
[01:37:15.736 --> 01:37:18.278]  Everywhere he goes, he talks about it.
[01:37:18.278 --> 01:37:28.563]  And I don't want to drop names, but I was in Hollywood working on some stuff over the weekend, and this film's one of the hottest in the underground there, with big stars.
[01:37:28.563 --> 01:37:32.945]  This is the reason you see his approval rating dropping, is because people are getting this film out.
[01:37:34.577 --> 01:37:37.300]  We have no way of knowing how many times it's been watched on the web.
[01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:43.605]  Three months in, it was 15 million, I'm guessing three months after it's 20 million.
[01:37:43.605 --> 01:37:46.268]  I'm just saying, as if the film's getting smaller.
[01:37:46.268 --> 01:37:47.909]  It's getting bigger.
[01:37:47.909 --> 01:37:50.952]  Own the phenomenon on DVD.
[01:37:50.952 --> 01:37:53.414]  Have this in your library.
[01:37:53.414 --> 01:37:56.957]  They can shut the web off, they can't shut you making copies of DVDs down.
[01:37:56.957 --> 01:37:59.560]  Get it, buy dummy DVDs, copies, make.
[01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:02.010]  The copies of it.
[01:38:02.010 --> 01:38:04.371]  Buy the blank DVDs.
[01:38:04.371 --> 01:38:06.432]  Make copies today.
[01:38:06.432 --> 01:38:08.733]  Get the duplication machines.
[01:38:08.733 --> 01:38:09.533]  They're cheap.
[01:38:09.533 --> 01:38:10.253]  Make copies.
[01:38:10.253 --> 01:38:11.494]  Get it out, folks.
[01:38:11.494 --> 01:38:12.735]  This is so important.
[01:38:12.735 --> 01:38:13.735]  The Obama deception.
[01:38:13.735 --> 01:38:15.516]  This is my biggest film.
[01:38:15.516 --> 01:38:17.917]  I've had a lot of other big hits.
[01:38:17.917 --> 01:38:21.619]  And I measure a hit by reaching millions and millions of people and affecting change.
[01:38:21.619 --> 01:38:28.162]  This has had more effect than probably all my films combined in six months.
[01:38:28.162 --> 01:38:28.702]  That's scary.
[01:38:29.636 --> 01:38:30.797]  The Obama Deception.
[01:38:30.797 --> 01:38:36.361]  Now, this film is number two in that, and it needs to be bigger than The Obama Deception.
[01:38:36.361 --> 01:38:37.822]  This is, frankly, more important.
[01:38:37.822 --> 01:38:38.143]  End game.
[01:38:38.143 --> 01:38:44.688]  Okay, I'm going to shut up, go to Ted Pike, because I want to get into the robotics news, the economy news, much of the stuff I've got here as well.
[01:38:45.868 --> 01:38:47.609]  Not going to keep the Reverend long.
[01:38:47.609 --> 01:38:55.454]  Reverend, can you just recap, because we have a lot of new listeners every day who don't know what the hate bill does versus the cyberbullying, what this does to free speech.
[01:38:55.454 --> 01:38:57.215]  You've got the bills on your website.
[01:38:57.215 --> 01:39:01.558]  What ended up happening in the House and Senate, where we are right now?
[01:39:01.558 --> 01:39:02.678]  Reverend Ted Pike.
[01:39:02.678 --> 01:39:11.164]  Well, basically the federal hate crimes bill, which has now been passed by both the House and the Senate, is an Orwellian attempt to
[01:39:11.792 --> 01:39:17.134]  Basically, unite federal and local policing power is number two.
[01:39:17.134 --> 01:39:34.481]  It will create a bias-oriented justice system in America, which says that our thoughts, our biases, when they result in some kind of speech that causes violent crimes or prejudice against others, becomes a hate crime.
[01:39:34.958 --> 01:39:35.418]  I think so.
[01:39:49.910 --> 01:40:02.257]  And for those that don't know, we have read over both the bills here on air with the hate crime bill, it's still very close to passing, it's saying that if you do something that
[01:40:18.154 --> 01:40:18.334]  That's
[01:40:41.488 --> 01:40:42.990]  This is an incremental tyranny.
[01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:45.994]  This is skipping, jumping ahead all the way to the end.
[01:40:45.994 --> 01:40:49.979]  This is more draconian than any legislation we've ever seen.
[01:40:49.979 --> 01:40:50.680]  Absolutely.
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:58.529]  Now, last week, we were able to generate massive calling, finally, at the last moment, for about three days.
[01:40:59.397 --> 01:40:59.677]  I don't
[01:41:16.107 --> 01:41:27.816]  There's imminent, immediate speech that will incite people to violent, hate-motivated violence that pastors and talk show hosts can't be indicted.
[01:41:27.816 --> 01:41:30.398]  So that was a real deliverance.
[01:41:30.398 --> 01:41:38.044]  But what the problem is right now is that in conference in the fall, the Brownback Amendment could be stripped off.
[01:41:38.044 --> 01:41:45.009]  And also, we have a new window of opportunity here, actually, to defeat the hate bill.
[01:41:45.009 --> 01:41:45.770]  I had hoped
[01:41:46.693 --> 01:41:48.556]  You see, let me just back up over here a little bit.
[01:41:48.556 --> 01:41:49.537]  Yeah, let's stop right there.
[01:41:49.537 --> 01:42:00.895]  I want you to get into that, Reverend Pike, but first, can you explain for those of us that don't know, and I try to study this and it gets murky, the legislative history of this so we understand where we're at now?
[01:42:01.789 --> 01:42:13.496]  Well, the Anti-Defamation League began in 1988 at their Hofstra conference in New York to jumpstart a model hate crimes law for America.
[01:42:13.496 --> 01:42:15.558]  During the 1990s, they persuaded some 45 states to adopt that.
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:36.990]  And some kind of a state hate crimes law, but their big ambition was always the creation of federal hate crimes law, which would give them behind the scenes empowerment to prosecute and end free speech and persecute, especially Christians in America.
[01:42:36.990 --> 01:42:41.453]  Now, historically, after 12 years of trying and five defeats,
[01:42:41.833 --> 01:42:45.094]  They have passed their big federal hate crimes bill.
[01:42:45.094 --> 01:42:46.114]  That's in a nutshell.
[01:42:46.114 --> 01:42:49.854]  It's barreling forward to conference in the fall.
[01:42:49.854 --> 01:42:58.196]  And for those that don't know, conference is in between the House and Senate to try to make any final changes so that it's a unified piece of legislation.
[01:42:58.196 --> 01:43:06.737]  Is there any way to shoot it down in conference or just try to keep that particular amendment on it?
[01:43:06.737 --> 01:43:09.678]  Here's the only strategy I can figure out.
[01:43:10.347 --> 01:43:24.103]  Now President Obama has repeatedly said in recent weeks, he's warned Congress, that if they add from 7 to 12 extra Raptor, that's F-22 Raptor fighters, to the defense
[01:43:24.848 --> 01:43:28.671]  Authorization bill to which the hate bill has now been attached.
[01:43:28.671 --> 01:43:30.012]  He will veto it.
[01:43:30.012 --> 01:43:35.957]  In other words, he will veto both the DOD bill with the hate bill on there.
[01:43:35.957 --> 01:43:47.786]  And unfortunately, this last week, the Senate did decide to strip off the Raptor fighters in order to please the President and not jeopardize the hate bill.
[01:43:47.786 --> 01:43:51.289]  However, the House a month ago voted overwhelmingly
[01:43:53.157 --> 01:43:56.800]  By a huge margin to keep all those Raptor fighters.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:00.062]  So we have, basically we have two DOD bills now.
[01:44:00.062 --> 01:44:08.128]  We have one that's overwhelmingly loaded down with seven to twelve Raptor fighters in support from the House of Representatives.
[01:44:08.128 --> 01:44:13.512]  And then we have another bill from the Senate which doesn't have those extra Raptors on there.
[01:44:13.512 --> 01:44:22.479]  Now what we have to do, what I believe our only real option now, is throughout this summer we've got to join with the very powerful
[01:44:23.488 --> 01:44:29.654]  Uh, defense arms industry as well as workers in 44 states who are even now lobbying.
[01:44:29.654 --> 01:44:38.884]  We have to lobby to get those Raptors back on to the final DOD hate bill in conference in September.
[01:44:39.284 --> 01:44:48.508]  We have to create a bill which is so offensive, so overloaded with extra raptors, that Obama will be put on the firing line.
[01:44:48.508 --> 01:44:55.851]  He will veto the hate bill along with the DOD bill.
[01:44:55.851 --> 01:44:58.372]  Ted Pike, I know it's important to defeat this.
[01:44:58.372 --> 01:44:58.973]  It's critical.
[01:45:00.874 --> 01:45:06.218]  Obama is such a liar that he hardly ever does what he says he's going to do.
[01:45:06.218 --> 01:45:08.020]  In fact, he really never does.
[01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:15.806]  So if he says he'll veto it, if the Raptors are on it, doesn't that mean he'll probably sign it with even more glee than if the Raptors are there?
[01:45:16.869 --> 01:45:17.329]  This is a standoff.
[01:45:17.329 --> 01:45:22.752]  This is the first veto challenge he has given to his Democratic Senate.
[01:45:22.752 --> 01:45:24.272]  This is a standoff.
[01:45:24.272 --> 01:45:35.738]  He is wanting to posture here as one who is frugal with taxpayers' money, who cares about protecting America, is not the servant of the arms industry.
[01:45:35.738 --> 01:45:42.141]  Even though he's a left-of-left liberal, he wants to give a conservative counterbalance here to all the money that
[01:45:42.461 --> 01:45:47.066]  Well, meanwhile, he's stolen $23.7 trillion with the last administration.
[01:45:47.066 --> 01:45:48.588]  That's exactly what I'm saying now.
[01:45:48.588 --> 01:45:50.269]  This is a real standoff.
[01:45:50.269 --> 01:45:57.577]  And rather than say, oh, Obama will just go with the hate bill because his heart is with the hate bill, he knows that this hate bill is a lot of trash.
[01:45:57.577 --> 01:45:58.918]  He doesn't have any real loyalty.
[01:45:58.918 --> 01:46:04.004]  He's promoting it on instruction from unseen powers behind the scenes.
[01:46:04.444 --> 01:46:19.399]  What we want to do here is we want to create a contest, a rivalry between the Democratic Senate and the House who perhaps can be persuaded in conference to defy him versus his reputation and the image he wants to create.
[01:46:19.819 --> 01:46:39.634]  And if we can do that, if we can join all summer long getting those phone calls not only into House and Senate members, but also on the other hand to the President, encouraging him to stand by his promise and veto the arms hate bill package, I believe this is a real viable opportunity.
[01:46:39.634 --> 01:46:44.558]  I believe it's the only real opportunity we do have to kill the hate bill, because
[01:46:44.938 --> 01:46:51.599]  Okay, well let's try to kill the hate bill, but Pastor Ted Pike, let's look at the stakes.
[01:46:51.599 --> 01:46:56.100]  Go over the bill as it stands now, if it does become law.
[01:46:56.100 --> 01:47:09.943]  Total federalization of police, the police openly being turned into political commissars under the DHS report, veterans or terrorists, gun owners, Ron Paul, libertarians, Christians, clergy response teams,
[01:47:10.823 --> 01:47:11.204]  That's right.
[01:47:11.204 --> 01:47:19.451]  You see, even though this Brownback Amendment is at least temporarily put on there until conference, nevertheless the whole weight of this bill, the whole momentum of it, is to create a
[01:47:32.022 --> 01:47:32.983]  We're good to go.
[01:47:54.315 --> 01:48:02.417]  These cases will go before judges at every stage in the judicial ladder, and they primarily will be liberals.
[01:48:02.417 --> 01:48:16.060]  They will be exercising compassion, and in a more of a holistic approach to the law, they will not only enforce the federal law against violent hate criminals, but against verbal violence.
[01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:16.220]  Okay.
[01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:23.602]  Because words which are cut and heard, and so this will very rapidly flow out and broaden into a broad hate crime, speech crime law for America.
[01:48:24.190 --> 01:48:26.513]  Separately, where is the Cyber Bullying Act?
[01:48:26.513 --> 01:48:28.034]  Boy, that sucker's scary.
[01:48:28.034 --> 01:48:33.980]  Yeah, the Cyber Bullying Act is still in the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime.
[01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:41.769]  The Democrats have been really overloaded trying to get the hate bill through, but you can be sure that next September, October, that will be coming through.
[01:48:41.769 --> 01:48:46.654]  And by the way, you don't even have to hurt somebody's feelings on the Internet.
[01:48:46.934 --> 01:48:48.655]  We've read the passages here on air.
[01:48:48.655 --> 01:48:50.976]  It's hard to believe it, but it's the actual bill.
[01:48:50.976 --> 01:48:51.376]  I mean, this is...
[01:49:07.384 --> 01:49:10.725]  More draconian than the hate speech laws in Europe.
[01:49:10.725 --> 01:49:16.107]  Folks, if you don't think the cops won't come and arrest you and the judges won't throw you in jail, they can't wait to do it.
[01:49:16.107 --> 01:49:18.728]  I mean, look at these DHS reports.
[01:49:18.728 --> 01:49:25.790]  Yeah, and you see, that's why it's so important to whack the liberals on the snout here and stop the big federal hate bill.
[01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:36.273]  Because if the federal hate bill goes through, there will be a breaking of the dam, a deluge of more and more of this ADL legislation coming through.
[01:49:37.421 --> 01:49:40.824]  Well, most of his agenda is failing.
[01:49:40.824 --> 01:49:57.817]  He did get his stimulus package, his payoff to his crony package, that big pork barrel, and he did, they have gotten their hate bill, at least so far, but on the greenhouse gas stuff that's dead in the Senate, at least for now,
[01:49:58.818 --> 01:50:06.559]  Uh, on the Second Amendment stuff, he has bills to basically end the Second Amendment, allow the Attorney General to ban anything with just the stroke of a pen.
[01:50:06.559 --> 01:50:12.781]  Uh, so a lot of his agenda is stalling, and his approval rating is dropping.
[01:50:12.781 --> 01:50:16.541]  But, but it is interesting that the first thing they wanted to do was get this hate bill.
[01:50:16.541 --> 01:50:25.703]  That was the first thing was to kill free speech in America, and Senator Jay Rockefeller's running around saying, we'd be better off without the Internet, and he wants to restrict free speech.
[01:50:26.403 --> 01:50:39.216]  These guys have really shown themselves to be pure anti-American trash and Pastor Ted Pike, Reverend Ted Pike, we just only want to commend you for your tireless work against this and we can only pray that we're able to defeat this.
[01:50:39.216 --> 01:50:44.701]  Fire out the website where people can see the strategy to defend the First Amendment.
[01:50:44.701 --> 01:50:45.502]  Well, thank you.

[01:51:51.011 --> 01:51:52.372]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:51:52.372 --> 01:51:54.273]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[01:52:15.834 --> 01:52:18.996]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:52:18.996 --> 01:52:26.322]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:52:29.366 --> 01:52:34.790]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[01:52:42.395 --> 01:52:43.175]  They're not after money.
[01:52:43.175 --> 01:52:44.476]  They have all the money they need.
[01:52:44.476 --> 01:52:45.437]  They're after power.
[01:52:45.437 --> 01:52:46.598]  That's what they're after.

[01:54:22.386 --> 01:54:26.908]  We got Rand Paul, Ron Paul's son, Dr. Rand Paul, joining us.
[01:54:26.908 --> 01:54:27.789]  Coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:54:27.789 --> 01:54:40.094]  We might keep him longer if you want to talk to him, but I want to continue with calls after that and get into this Jay Rockefeller video that's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com where he gets confronted about eugenics.
[01:54:41.021 --> 01:54:42.261]  The Bilderberg Group.
[01:54:42.261 --> 01:54:45.702]  Very powerful, great job, We Are Change.
[01:54:45.702 --> 01:54:46.582]  That is coming up.
[01:54:46.582 --> 01:54:50.624]  I want to get Stuart from We Are Change and Luke on from We Are Change tomorrow.
[01:54:50.624 --> 01:54:53.424]  We're there together doing this with other folks.
[01:54:53.424 --> 01:55:00.386]  But I wanted to cover this before we get Rand Paul on in the next segment as we start the next hour.
[01:55:00.386 --> 01:55:02.967]  Cable TV workers trained to spy on citizens.
[01:55:02.967 --> 01:55:06.488]  I mentioned this, but I want to read this article from PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:55:06.488 --> 01:55:07.208]  By the way, the caller
[01:55:08.271 --> 01:55:12.255]  Pointed out that we said Time Warner, the article doesn't say we said it's on by Time Warner.
[01:55:12.255 --> 01:55:15.798]  A commenter said that, so we're not responsible for what commenters say.
[01:55:15.798 --> 01:55:17.499]  Side issue, let me start over.
[01:55:17.499 --> 01:55:21.743]  Cable TV workers trained to spy on citizens.
[01:55:21.743 --> 01:55:33.594]  Bright House Network's employees will watch for suspicious behavior, which according to law enforcement and DHS guidelines, includes being politically active, displaying bumper stickers, or disagreeing with the government.
[01:55:35.131 --> 01:55:36.893]  And you can go to Brian House's own statements.
[01:55:36.893 --> 01:55:41.457]  They say, oh, we want them to know the community and watch for anything out of the ordinary.
[01:55:41.457 --> 01:55:46.462]  And if they see you spank your kids, not against the law, they're still going to go take your kids.
[01:55:46.462 --> 01:55:49.745]  Or if they smell something that smells like pot, you're going to get SWAT teamed.
[01:55:49.745 --> 01:55:53.248]  It happens to people I know all the time.
[01:55:53.248 --> 01:55:58.133]  I mean, you know, one of the Prison Planet Forum moderators, J.C.
[01:55:58.133 --> 01:55:58.493]  Coyote,
[01:56:01.010 --> 01:56:03.092]  Had some reloading stuff, so they SWAT teamed him.
[01:56:03.092 --> 01:56:05.374]  You know, not allowed to reload in America.
[01:56:05.374 --> 01:56:07.656]  Looked strange to them, so it was over.
[01:56:07.656 --> 01:56:15.282]  One of the largest cable TV companies in the United States is training its employees to look for suspicious behavior and report it to police under the guise of Neighborhood Watch Initiative.
[01:56:15.282 --> 01:56:29.734]  Since according to law enforcement and Homeland Security guidelines, suspicious behavior includes owning guns, being politically active, and having bumper stickers on your car, the cable guy's next visit to your house may turn out to have even more interesting consequences than the originally anticipated.
[01:56:31.050 --> 01:56:47.098]  Operation Bright Eyes is designed to maximize the eyes and ears of Bright House Network's field service representatives and other employees to easily identify suspicious behavior and to quickly report criminal activities to the police, according to Fox News.
[01:56:47.098 --> 01:56:53.922]  All current and new Bright House employees will receive training to help them use the resources at their disposal.
[01:56:54.764 --> 01:56:58.887]  A secret police, I would add, to become familiar with residents' activities in the neighborhoods.
[01:56:58.887 --> 01:57:05.632]  Yes, spy on everyone and report anything they deem unusual to the authorities in order to keep our neighborhoods safe.
[01:57:05.632 --> 01:57:11.316]  Since when was it the job of the cable guy to run around pretending to be an undercover cop?
[01:57:11.316 --> 01:57:20.283]  The program is ripe for abuse and another advancement of the elite tattletale society being created in order to make the sheeple self-police their behavior.
[01:57:21.653 --> 01:57:28.995]  Constantly aware that they are being watched by secret police, living in fear that Big Brother will catch any minor indiscretion.
[01:57:28.995 --> 01:57:37.298]  And I had the Wall Street Journal writer here, and she said everywhere she was in England to do a travel piece, people would run up and say, you can't photograph, it's illegal, it's terrorism.
[01:57:37.298 --> 01:57:40.439]  She'd try to be at the canals, take a photo at landmarks.
[01:57:40.439 --> 01:57:41.440]  And when I was in D.C.
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:45.421]  last year, they'd run up and say, turn your cameras off anywhere.
[01:57:45.421 --> 01:57:48.682]  It's about an oppressive system where we're all slaves.
[01:57:50.342 --> 01:57:57.984]  And they're taking the neighborhood watch groups and the compulsory kid, you know, youth service corps and making them tattletales.
[01:57:57.984 --> 01:58:02.004]  You can just Google, uh, seven-year-olds trained to spy on neighbors.
[01:58:02.004 --> 01:58:02.465]  Google it.
[01:58:02.465 --> 01:58:04.685]  Show people right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:04.685 --> 01:58:05.525]  You'll get England.
[01:58:05.525 --> 01:58:06.966]  You'll get the U.S.
[01:58:06.966 --> 01:58:12.207]  The kids are growing up with cameras in the school bathrooms, cameras in the school showers in Tennessee.
[01:58:12.207 --> 01:58:13.887]  I mean, this is total big brother.
[01:58:13.887 --> 01:58:18.528]  The government's totally rogue and criminal, owned by foreign banks, looting and robbing everything.
[01:58:19.068 --> 01:58:24.838]  And they're putting in this prison grid, not to make us prisoners, but to make us slaves.
[01:58:24.838 --> 01:58:28.284]  And, uh, it just goes on and on.
[01:58:30.683 --> 01:58:34.005]  With kids spying on their parents and everything else.
[01:58:34.005 --> 01:58:36.486]  We are out of time for this hour.
[01:58:36.486 --> 01:58:38.667]  Don't forget, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:38.667 --> 01:58:41.209]  We're simulcasting there on video right now.
[01:58:41.209 --> 01:58:46.832]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:46.832 --> 01:58:50.034]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:50.774 --> 01:58:52.155]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.155 --> 01:58:54.136]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:58:54.136 --> 01:58:54.796]  Well, you should.
[01:58:54.796 --> 01:58:59.619]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:58:59.619 --> 01:59:00.420]  That's right.
[01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:09.084]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[01:59:09.084 --> 01:59:10.445]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[01:59:10.445 --> 01:59:11.586]  Plus, if you act fast.
[01:59:11.786 --> 01:59:17.770]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:59:17.770 --> 01:59:24.674]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:59:24.674 --> 01:59:30.198]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:59:30.198 --> 01:59:31.659]  This is real.
[01:59:31.659 --> 01:59:32.699]  Don't miss out.
[01:59:32.699 --> 01:59:39.584]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[01:59:39.804 --> 01:59:41.265]  And get your free handgun.
[01:59:41.265 --> 01:59:43.627]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[01:59:43.627 --> 01:59:47.329]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[01:59:47.329 --> 01:59:53.854]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[01:59:53.854 --> 01:59:56.236]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.236 --> 02:00:05.502]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.502 --> 02:00:06.083]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.778 --> 02:00:08.561]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.561 --> 02:00:10.304]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.304 --> 02:00:11.886]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.886 --> 02:00:12.807]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.807 --> 02:00:17.655]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.655 --> 02:00:21.701]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:31.445]  So much has happened in the last two or three years thanks to you, the viewers, the listeners of this show and other Patriot organizations, other Liberty lovers standing up.
[02:00:31.445 --> 02:00:39.269]  Ron Paul has gone from being someone unknown, almost obscure compared to some congressmen, to the most internationally interviewed congressman.
[02:00:39.269 --> 02:00:40.710]  That's mainstream news.
[02:00:40.710 --> 02:00:41.070]  What is he?
[02:00:41.070 --> 02:00:44.092]  The second most interviewed congressman now on U.S.
[02:00:44.092 --> 02:00:44.232]  media.
[02:00:46.033 --> 02:00:52.156]  And we've gone from almost no one knowing the Federal Reserve's private run for profit to the majority of people knowing about it.
[02:00:52.156 --> 02:00:59.740]  It's one of the most searched Google terms, and it's something being talked about everywhere, that it's offshore, it's a criminal corporate takeover.
[02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:05.603]  Now, I told folks that when Ron Paul ran, he said, look, I'm not promising I can win, don't get mad at me.
[02:01:05.603 --> 02:01:06.563]  Some people did.
[02:01:06.563 --> 02:01:15.248]  They expected instant gratification, like a cheeseburger, you get in 30 seconds, you start stamping your foot after 30 seconds if the line doesn't move at McDonald's.
[02:01:15.948 --> 02:01:19.589]  The globalists didn't build their system overnight, we're not going to defeat it overnight.
[02:01:19.589 --> 02:01:39.614]  We're having giant success right now, and we need more people under the Ron Paul mantle, the Liberty Committee idea, the Campaign for Liberty idea, to run for Congress, run for Senate, run for Governor, run for City Council, run for County Commissioner, run for City Board, whatever.
[02:01:39.614 --> 02:01:40.354]  It's happening now.
[02:01:41.616 --> 02:01:44.178]  And somebody we're drafting to run for the U.S.
[02:01:44.178 --> 02:01:49.302]  Senate is the son of Dr. Ron Paul.
[02:01:49.302 --> 02:01:51.183]  Dr. Rand Paul.
[02:01:51.183 --> 02:01:52.624]  He's an eye doctor.
[02:01:52.624 --> 02:01:54.266]  And he's raising the money.
[02:01:54.266 --> 02:01:55.687]  Looks like he's going to run.
[02:01:55.687 --> 02:01:56.907]  Getting the support behind him.
[02:01:56.907 --> 02:01:58.289]  Very, very exciting.
[02:01:58.289 --> 02:02:01.031]  Last time they were on, biggest support they've seen.
[02:02:01.031 --> 02:02:01.911]  Crashed their servers.
[02:02:01.911 --> 02:02:04.493]  It's like Ron Paul said here in the middle of his campaign.
[02:02:04.493 --> 02:02:07.295]  Half the support they were getting was coming from this show.
[02:02:07.295 --> 02:02:07.776]  Then later it
[02:02:08.556 --> 02:02:10.898]  Opened up to where it was a wider audience.
[02:02:10.898 --> 02:02:19.403]  But the point is, you guys out there are literally driving the revolution for liberty and freedom against the revolutionary corporate takeover banksters.
[02:02:19.403 --> 02:02:32.731]  And so that's why the process of just Ron Paul running educated everybody about inflation and private banks and the Federal Reserve and globalism and that the left-right paradigm is a fraud.
[02:02:33.806 --> 02:02:36.068]  We need his son in the U.S.
[02:02:36.068 --> 02:02:38.430]  Senate, Dr. Rand Paul.
[02:02:38.430 --> 02:02:40.092]  Doc, it's good to have you on with us.
[02:02:40.092 --> 02:02:42.014]  Glad to be back with you, Alex.
[02:02:42.014 --> 02:02:46.418]  We're about to break and some stations join us in the next segment, but are you running?
[02:02:46.418 --> 02:02:48.379]  I mean, it looks like you're running.
[02:02:48.379 --> 02:02:53.624]  We're very, very close and we're going to have a final announcement within two weeks.
[02:02:53.624 --> 02:02:58.569]  Still putting things together, having some last minute discussions with family and friends.
[02:02:59.718 --> 02:03:05.400]  And I will only run and make the decision if I think we absolutely have a chance to win.
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:10.421]  This campaign will not be just about education or protest.
[02:03:10.421 --> 02:03:18.944]  We will have not only the money, but the organization, the name recognition, and everything else it takes to win on the ground.
[02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:33.487]  Well, your father ran once for the House and lost, won the second time, so certainly we wanted Ron Paul to win and certainly we want you to win, but I'm just saying it's win-win either way.
[02:03:33.487 --> 02:03:35.229]  Just the battle itself is victory.
[02:03:35.885 --> 02:03:46.491]  Well, particularly in my father's case it was, because not winning the presidency, he did win the attention, particularly for being right about the housing bubble and predicting that it would come.
[02:03:46.491 --> 02:03:48.513]  So now he is the go-to guy.
[02:03:48.513 --> 02:03:51.675]  They go to him and they ask him about the Federal Reserve.
[02:03:51.675 --> 02:03:53.556]  The overwhelming support.
[02:03:53.556 --> 02:03:55.817]  I've never seen anything like it.
[02:03:55.817 --> 02:03:59.279]  The co-sponsorships for the Audit the Fed bill.
[02:03:59.279 --> 02:04:03.762]  My dad says that it would almost assuredly pass both the House and the Senate.
[02:04:04.367 --> 02:04:07.637]  If and when they give it a vote, but that's still a pretty big if.
[02:04:09.155 --> 02:04:11.077]  Well that's what I wanted to talk about when we get back.
[02:04:11.077 --> 02:04:14.280]  I want your take on what I was discussing, but from your own perspective.
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:15.861]  How far we've come.
[02:04:15.861 --> 02:04:27.411]  I think we need to recognize the victories we've had and realize we're in this fight against the globalists and where things are going right now in the Senate with them blocking the vote right now to audit the Fed.
[02:04:27.411 --> 02:04:31.795]  But as your father said earlier this week, or late last week, there's no way they can win.
[02:04:31.795 --> 02:04:34.237]  The longer they try to cover up and block this vote,
[02:04:35.178 --> 02:04:39.261]  The more people wake up to the fact that they're the problem, not the solution.
[02:04:39.261 --> 02:04:40.601]  Dr. Rand Paul is our guest.
[02:04:40.601 --> 02:04:41.942]  We'll give you his website.
[02:04:41.942 --> 02:04:43.223]  It's up on screen.
[02:04:43.223 --> 02:04:47.245]  RandPaul2010.com.
[02:04:47.245 --> 02:04:49.566]  RandPaul2010.com.
[02:04:49.566 --> 02:04:50.887]  We'll talk to him coming up.
[02:04:50.887 --> 02:04:53.869]  And your phone calls for Dr. Rand Paul at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:04:53.869 --> 02:04:54.649]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:04:54.649 --> 02:04:55.830]  PrisonPlanet.tv is my site.
[02:05:01.254 --> 02:05:02.935]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.935 --> 02:05:07.677]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:05:07.677 --> 02:05:10.639]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:05:10.639 --> 02:05:13.681]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:05:13.681 --> 02:05:19.524]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:05:19.764 --> 02:05:23.008]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:05:23.008 --> 02:05:29.997]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:05:29.997 --> 02:05:33.282]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[02:06:06.914 --> 02:06:08.214]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:06:08.214 --> 02:06:12.495]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[02:06:12.495 --> 02:06:14.356]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[02:06:14.356 --> 02:06:20.658]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[02:06:21.798 --> 02:06:24.659]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.

[02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:29.421]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.

[02:06:40.206 --> 02:06:42.627]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[02:06:42.627 --> 02:06:45.088]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[02:06:45.088 --> 02:06:47.189]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:48.750]  Go to www.

[02:07:00.997 --> 02:07:05.240]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:07.241]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:07:07.241 --> 02:07:15.486]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:07:15.746 --> 02:07:21.292]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:07:21.292 --> 02:07:23.174]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:07:23.174 --> 02:07:29.680]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:34.205]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere.
[02:07:34.445 --> 02:07:34.845]  That's right.
[02:08:02.071 --> 02:08:04.834]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.834 --> 02:08:09.638]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:09.638 --> 02:08:16.103]  1-800-259-9231 if you'd like to talk to Dr. Rand Paul, son of Ron Paul, running for U.S.
[02:08:16.103 --> 02:08:17.685]  Senate out of Kentucky.
[02:08:17.685 --> 02:08:19.346]  I think destiny is he's going to run.
[02:08:19.346 --> 02:08:21.128]  I'll be very surprised if he doesn't.
[02:08:21.128 --> 02:08:25.872]  But he said the next two weeks you'll hear the main announcement.
[02:08:25.872 --> 02:08:28.735]  But Dr. Rand Paul, let's go over
[02:08:30.165 --> 02:08:32.168]  Go over the most important issues right now.
[02:08:32.168 --> 02:08:37.437]  I was asking during the break what you think is most important and you made the point that they did it.
[02:08:37.437 --> 02:08:40.001]  That the private Federal Reserve made this debt.
[02:08:40.001 --> 02:08:43.266]  They created this system and you went back to Andrew Jackson.
[02:08:43.266 --> 02:08:43.887]  Go over that!
[02:08:44.482 --> 02:08:55.304]  Well, the interesting thing is that I think the two are always linked, and particularly when people try to sort of make us outside the mainstream about talking about the Fed, is I say, the Fed is the debt.
[02:08:55.304 --> 02:09:00.885]  The way we pay for the debt is by monetizing it, printing new money, and they go hand-in-hand.
[02:09:00.885 --> 02:09:09.047]  Because we have a large debt, we give up a lot of control and power to the Federal Reserve that we wouldn't have to do if we didn't run a large debt.
[02:09:09.047 --> 02:09:10.908]  So they're two sides of the same coin.
[02:09:10.908 --> 02:09:12.748]  In fact, when Andrew Jackson ran
[02:09:13.328 --> 02:09:15.629]  And ran hard against the second bank.
[02:09:15.629 --> 02:09:31.179]  You know, he said, the national debt is not a national blessing, but a national curse, inasmuch it is calculated to gather around the administration of moneyed aristocracy, keen and dangerous to the Republic.
[02:09:31.179 --> 02:09:36.262]  And I think that's really important, that it is the debt, but it's also the Federal Reserve, and they're two sides of the same coin.
[02:09:38.749 --> 02:09:55.815]  Well, really, the fight against the private offshore central banks has been the perpetual fight since before this country was even born, from the moment it was conceived, right through the seven years of revolutionary conflict against the British Crown, until today.
[02:09:55.815 --> 02:10:05.099]  And I guess they won the beachhead in 1913, and have been strangling us and using us as their engine for world domination ever since, and I believe they've overreached now.
[02:10:05.959 --> 02:10:06.039]  Yes.
[02:10:17.051 --> 02:10:22.792]  We feel the momentum shift against them as now the general public knows the Federal Reserve's private.
[02:10:22.792 --> 02:10:24.052]  They know it's above the law.
[02:10:24.052 --> 02:10:25.573]  They know it's criminal.
[02:10:25.573 --> 02:10:30.193]  And now it's not just your father getting in the face of Bernanke or Greenspan.
[02:10:30.193 --> 02:10:32.894]  Now it's the majority of the congressmen and senators.
[02:10:32.894 --> 02:10:34.094]  Now it's the pundits.
[02:10:34.094 --> 02:10:41.856]  These guys are more and more on the run and we feel the momentum, the pendulum shifting directions.
[02:10:41.856 --> 02:10:42.636]  Do you see that?
[02:10:42.636 --> 02:10:43.836]  Do you feel that, Dr. Paul?
[02:10:44.136 --> 02:10:57.083]  Yeah, I think one of the most amazing things and one thing we can take great solace in after this election is that the last time Bernanke was on with my father in the committee, you can truly see fear in his eyes.
[02:10:57.083 --> 02:11:05.327]  They are afraid that there will be oversight of the Federal Reserve, the first major oversight or change in the legislation since it originated in 1913.
[02:11:06.588 --> 02:11:07.689]  And they fear it.
[02:11:07.689 --> 02:11:19.760]  You know, they've hired a million dollar lobbyist, the lobbyist that used to be the lobbyist for Enron is now going to be the lobbyist for the Fed, and they are fearful that they are losing the momentum and there could actually be a real audit.
[02:11:23.012 --> 02:11:24.692]  They're going to pull out every stop, though.
[02:11:24.692 --> 02:11:30.494]  They're openly threatening Congress, as you know, with physical martial law last October.
[02:11:30.494 --> 02:11:31.814]  We had the Congressman here on air.
[02:11:31.814 --> 02:11:32.714]  People couldn't believe it.
[02:11:32.714 --> 02:11:38.696]  And now they're writing articles going, yes, no, there will be martial law if you don't do whatever we say.
[02:11:38.696 --> 02:11:42.077]  And if you ever audit the Fed, there's going to be a depression.
[02:11:42.077 --> 02:11:49.298]  So, I mean, this is literally a gun to our head saying, if you ask too many questions, bang, your economy's dead.
[02:11:49.298 --> 02:11:51.779]  Is that not financial terrorism, Dr. Paul?
[02:11:52.279 --> 02:11:56.948]  Well, they're also threatening, they say, oh, if you audit the Fed, that will raise interest rates.
[02:11:57.478 --> 02:12:03.379]  Well, looking at the numbers and transparency does nothing to the interest rates or even really to their policy.
[02:12:03.379 --> 02:12:13.001]  While we want them not to have this expansionist policy of easy credit and easy money and low interest rates, just looking at their books does nothing to change their policy.
[02:12:13.001 --> 02:12:20.143]  So an audit's a good first step, but they're already complaining, saying an audit will control their monetary policy.
[02:12:20.143 --> 02:12:23.103]  And I wish it were so, but the audit's only the first step forward.
[02:12:23.103 --> 02:12:26.484]  But you can see how they truly fear transparency.
[02:12:27.296 --> 02:12:43.048]  And, you know, the fact that they bought up $2 trillion worth of assets, the biggest thing we need to get out now, though, is that the debt used to be backed by Treasury bills and the Federal Reserve bought Treasury bills, but now the Federal Reserve buys used car loans.
[02:12:43.048 --> 02:12:44.969]  The Federal Reserve buys bad home loans.
[02:12:45.509 --> 02:12:48.030]  So there's all kinds of things being monetized now.
[02:12:48.030 --> 02:13:02.577]  I think I saw a statistic that 40% of the debt being bought now by the Federal Reserve is not Treasury bills or Treasury bonds, it is used car loans and bad home mortgages and derivatives and all this other craziness.
[02:13:02.577 --> 02:13:13.743]  Well that's what's scary is that they've made a big show of paying back a few hundred billion of the trillions that have disappeared into, in many cases, completely foreign banks, not just offshore, multinational.
[02:13:14.568 --> 02:13:25.556]  But what they're not explaining is they're taking that money and fractional reserving it, loaning at least 10 times out and leveraging it into derivatives again.
[02:13:25.556 --> 02:13:31.380]  So it's just pumping up the bubble even bigger at the cost of the real economy.
[02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:32.641]  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[02:13:32.641 --> 02:13:37.985]  And if you look at the monetary base, this is the banking reserves plus the currency.
[02:13:37.985 --> 02:13:40.107]  The banking reserves last year doubled.
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:41.861]  That's what you're talking about.
[02:13:41.861 --> 02:13:46.045]  That then goes into the banks and can be multiplied another tenfold.
[02:13:46.045 --> 02:13:53.533]  So we double the banking reserves, and then when it gets into the system and spreads to the economy, it can be multiplied another tenfold.
[02:13:53.533 --> 02:14:00.280]  I think there's no question that ultimately we will be seeing, you know, rampant inflation.
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:02.001]  And that's what I tell people in this election.
[02:14:02.001 --> 02:14:03.443]  I tell the Republicans, I say, look,
[02:14:03.863 --> 02:14:17.389]  You want someone like me who can directly draw the debt and say how debt hurts the working class and debt hurts those on fixed incomes because that's the Democrats usually say, oh, we'll give a handout to those people and that way we can buy their votes.
[02:14:17.389 --> 02:14:19.870]  But I think we have a message too that appeals to people.
[02:14:19.870 --> 02:14:22.791]  We say, look, the debt causes inflation.
[02:14:22.791 --> 02:14:27.573]  High prices hurt those who are least able to afford the rising prices.
[02:14:27.573 --> 02:14:28.753]  And we're going to help you.
[02:14:28.753 --> 02:14:31.294]  We're going to help you not by giving you a handout.
[02:14:31.294 --> 02:14:33.415]  We're going to help you by limiting the debt.
[02:14:35.989 --> 02:14:40.852]  Well, Dr. Paul, look at the system these bankers create worldwide.
[02:14:40.852 --> 02:14:42.413]  A system of dependency.
[02:14:42.413 --> 02:14:48.157]  A system of bankrupting societies, creating debt bubbles so big that when they implode it's a black hole.
[02:14:48.157 --> 02:14:50.378]  There's no way to physically pay it back.
[02:14:50.378 --> 02:14:55.702]  Creating fiat currency and liquidity at many multiples above all the real resources.
[02:14:57.101 --> 02:15:02.978]  uh... and uh... actual assets in the world and then they destroy the economy so bad their argument is
[02:15:04.676 --> 02:15:14.319]  You've got to give 90% of your taxes to us in interest on the debt, but we'll give you the 10% in government jobs and government contracts to corporations and to welfare.
[02:15:14.319 --> 02:15:17.620]  So they give us the crumbs off the table.
[02:15:17.620 --> 02:15:21.182]  That's what we've got to explain to the poor people is, this is a scam.
[02:15:21.182 --> 02:15:26.663]  Of the $23.7 trillion Bloomberg and AP report they've stolen in 10 months,
[02:15:28.644 --> 02:15:30.246]  Three plus trillion.
[02:15:30.246 --> 02:15:36.031]  Now you're talking about a few hundred billion of chicken feed that's been actually given to domestic populations.
[02:15:36.031 --> 02:15:41.536]  So this isn't even really socialism when Newsweek has that headline saying we're all socialists now.
[02:15:41.536 --> 02:15:44.439]  Isn't this more akin to fascism?
[02:15:44.439 --> 02:15:45.460]  Well, exactly right.
[02:15:45.460 --> 02:15:54.048]  And then you look at in one of the most galling and glaring episodes, you know, we gave AIG $180 billion and then we also gave most of their
[02:15:54.997 --> 02:16:02.281]  You know, multi-millionaire executives, we gave them retention bonuses for doing such a great job with their company.
[02:16:02.281 --> 02:16:05.662]  I think that kind of thing really galls the public.
[02:16:05.662 --> 02:16:19.309]  And the interesting thing in a Republican primary is that, I haven't seen good statistics on this, but I can tell you from being out on the stump for three or four months, 80 to 90% or more Republican primary voters are against the bank bailout.
[02:16:19.309 --> 02:16:22.431]  I'll bet you 60 to 70% of Democrats are against it.
[02:16:22.950 --> 02:16:27.072]  So as I go around Kentucky, I say, look, I would have voted against this bailout.
[02:16:27.072 --> 02:16:30.133]  I've been talking about it for almost a year now.
[02:16:30.133 --> 02:16:31.594]  And you get to choose.
[02:16:31.594 --> 02:16:35.036]  You get to choose a Republican to be your nominee.
[02:16:35.036 --> 02:16:37.217]  And do you want somebody who voted for the bailout?
[02:16:37.217 --> 02:16:39.078]  Over half the Republican leadership did.
[02:16:39.078 --> 02:16:41.839]  And you've got to decide which direction your party takes.
[02:16:42.446 --> 02:16:44.147]  And I think the message is resonating.
[02:16:44.147 --> 02:16:59.314]  I worried at first that Republicans would be upset to hear some chastisement of their people, but I think most of them, you know, two-thirds of them were voting against McCain as their nominee, so quite a few Republicans are more conservative than what they're getting out of Washington.
[02:17:00.157 --> 02:17:04.801]  Well, look at Rick Perry and other governors who are clearly globalist.
[02:17:04.801 --> 02:17:09.004]  They've been jumping on the bandwagon talking about secession and fight the New World Order.
[02:17:09.004 --> 02:17:11.866]  It's like they're Alex Jones or something.
[02:17:11.866 --> 02:17:20.433]  And that's great for me because it makes me mainstream and suddenly all these big stations are turning us on in major cities because everything I've talked about has now come true.
[02:17:20.973 --> 02:17:22.753]  But really they're only paying lip service.
[02:17:22.753 --> 02:17:35.656]  We need real McCoys like Ron Paul and Rand Paul and others who actually have a record and who have spent their whole lives voting and speaking and fighting for true freedom.
[02:17:35.656 --> 02:17:40.837]  And so now is the time for people to support folks like yourself.
[02:17:40.837 --> 02:17:42.738]  What can people do now?
[02:17:42.738 --> 02:17:46.459]  I mean obviously once you announce in two weeks the real momentum will kick in.
[02:17:46.459 --> 02:17:47.659]  What can they do today?
[02:17:48.679 --> 02:17:52.241]  Uh, to make sure you make that right decision to run for Senate out of Kentucky.
[02:17:52.241 --> 02:17:57.664]  Well, I told you earlier, Alex, last time I was on your show, your listeners shut down my website because they overdid it.
[02:17:57.664 --> 02:18:04.567]  We had to buy a bigger server, so we want your listeners to go and test out my website to see if they can overtax it.
[02:18:04.567 --> 02:18:07.389]  That's RandPaul2010.com.
[02:18:07.389 --> 02:18:13.832]  The other thing they can do is, we're taking pledges for a money bomb, and that website is RunRandRun.com.
[02:18:15.566 --> 02:18:19.869]  And we're hoping to get 10,000 people that would give $100 on one day.
[02:18:19.869 --> 02:18:34.441]  If we raise a million dollars in one day, which I think it's possible, if we did that, it completely transforms my race, it completely makes us really the lead dog in the race, and makes us the one to beat.
[02:18:35.117 --> 02:18:37.239]  It puts us on the map for the rest of the election.
[02:18:37.239 --> 02:18:42.622]  We don't have to struggle month in and month out to see if they'll still include us because of our fundraising.
[02:18:42.622 --> 02:18:45.504]  We get all that front end loaded on August 20th.
[02:18:45.504 --> 02:18:47.085]  It's amazing what we could do.
[02:19:05.297 --> 02:19:06.137]  Exactly.
[02:19:06.137 --> 02:19:08.038]  And we're already getting good coverage here.
[02:19:08.038 --> 02:19:10.578]  I've had nothing but good coverage so far.
[02:19:10.578 --> 02:19:13.139]  We've probably had 10 AP stories.
[02:19:13.139 --> 02:19:14.599]  I've been on television.
[02:19:14.599 --> 02:19:16.999]  I've been on national television twice.
[02:19:16.999 --> 02:19:18.600]  We're getting good coverage here.
[02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:26.421]  Every time we do something, we have a conference call for the media, and we're routinely getting between 10 and 15 people on our conference calls for statewide media.
[02:19:26.421 --> 02:19:30.322]  So, uh, there's a lot going on, but you're right.
[02:19:30.322 --> 02:19:34.383]  The key thing that puts me over the top is if that money bomb is successful August 20th.
[02:19:35.424 --> 02:19:41.287]  Well, we'll be sure to have Lyman on, Trevor Lyman and yourself, or some folks from your campaign.
[02:19:41.287 --> 02:19:44.388]  Maybe have your daddy on that day to plug the honey pump.
[02:19:44.388 --> 02:19:50.851]  I don't know about all the stupid election rules, but he should be able to do that.
[02:19:50.851 --> 02:19:54.872]  All right, we're going to come back, get into what your agenda would be in the U.S.
[02:19:54.872 --> 02:19:58.774]  Senate on the carbon tax, gun control, and a lot more.
[02:19:58.774 --> 02:19:59.534]  Stay with us.
[02:19:59.534 --> 02:20:00.635]  Dr. Rand Paul is our guest.
[02:20:01.328 --> 02:20:02.629]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.629 --> 02:20:08.214]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:08.214 --> 02:20:13.238]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:13.238 --> 02:20:18.262]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:20:18.809 --> 02:20:24.034]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:24.034 --> 02:20:26.357]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:20:26.357 --> 02:20:31.161]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:20:31.161 --> 02:20:32.283]  And here's the best part.
[02:20:32.283 --> 02:20:35.045]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:20:35.045 --> 02:20:38.629]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:20:38.949 --> 02:20:42.131]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:42.131 --> 02:20:44.353]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:44.353 --> 02:20:45.314]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:20:45.314 --> 02:20:45.554]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:45.554 --> 02:20:48.936]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:48.936 --> 02:20:50.678]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:21:01.218 --> 02:21:07.879]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:21:07.879 --> 02:21:16.001]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:21:16.001 --> 02:21:24.163]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:21:24.163 --> 02:21:28.924]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:21:29.244 --> 02:21:34.487]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:21:34.487 --> 02:21:38.829]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:21:38.829 --> 02:21:39.910]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:39.910 --> 02:21:44.412]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:21:44.412 --> 02:21:49.315]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:21:49.315 --> 02:21:52.316]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:21:52.316 --> 02:21:53.957]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:57.139 --> 02:21:58.680]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:58.680 --> 02:22:02.281]  It is a big idea.
[02:22:02.281 --> 02:22:05.102]  A New World Order.
[02:22:05.102 --> 02:22:09.604]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:22:09.604 --> 02:22:12.825]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:22:12.825 --> 02:22:15.627]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:22:15.627 --> 02:22:18.788]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:22:18.788 --> 02:22:26.111]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:22:27.537 --> 02:22:28.142]  Arrrrgh!
[02:22:29.141 --> 02:22:34.585]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:22:34.585 --> 02:22:38.467]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:22:38.467 --> 02:22:41.029]  Bill of Rights is making great progress for the world government.
[02:22:41.029 --> 02:22:42.190]  Most people have no idea.
[02:22:42.190 --> 02:22:42.970]  They're not after money.
[02:22:42.970 --> 02:22:44.251]  They have all the money they need.
[02:22:44.251 --> 02:22:45.232]  They're after power.
[02:22:45.232 --> 02:22:46.393]  That's what they're after these days.
[02:22:46.393 --> 02:22:55.118]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:24:05.476 --> 02:24:20.918]  Riders on the storm Riders on the storm Into this house we're born Into this world we're thrown
[02:24:23.089 --> 02:24:26.391]  Well, we've crashed their server.
[02:24:26.391 --> 02:24:27.612]  Our millions of great listeners.
[02:24:27.612 --> 02:24:32.256]  Folks, we gotta get Dr. Rand Paul a CDN.
[02:24:32.256 --> 02:24:33.957]  Content Distribution Network.
[02:24:33.957 --> 02:24:37.660]  That's the only thing that keeps up InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:38.861]  So we've been through this.
[02:24:40.171 --> 02:24:42.713]  And we've got the sites that crash everybody.
[02:24:42.713 --> 02:24:47.756]  The only way they're going to keep their sites up during the money bomb and all the rest of this is with a CDN.
[02:24:47.756 --> 02:24:51.098]  So whoever the IT guys are, tell them, CDNs.
[02:24:51.098 --> 02:24:53.160]  We can tell you, we've been through a lot of CDNs.
[02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:54.761]  We've got two companies that we know are good.
[02:24:54.761 --> 02:24:57.042]  We've got a backup CDN.
[02:24:57.042 --> 02:25:02.926]  But yeah, you've got to be able to take a million people visiting your site at one time to really be effective.
[02:25:02.926 --> 02:25:07.630]  But going back to Dr. Rand Paul, that's exciting though that the audience has crashed your server though.
[02:25:07.630 --> 02:25:08.030]  That is!
[02:25:09.046 --> 02:25:11.675]  That's better than a Nielsen poll, I think.
[02:25:16.184 --> 02:25:20.727]  There's so much I could throw out, but I want to get into investigating the Fed.
[02:25:20.727 --> 02:25:25.189]  You know, your father's called for criminal investigations by state grand juries, saying that's constitutional.
[02:25:25.189 --> 02:25:41.438]  What about investigating Al Gore, who openly owns the controlling stock in two of the carbon trading companies, and the bill they've passed in the House says that the federal agencies can just levy any tax they want, including toilet paper taxes.
[02:25:41.438 --> 02:25:42.479]  What would you do about that?
[02:25:43.140 --> 02:25:49.854]  My prediction is that if cap-and-trade gets through, we will have an army of armed EPA agents.
[02:25:50.799 --> 02:25:53.581]  Thousands of them, and apparently... They've already said that.
[02:25:53.581 --> 02:25:54.182]  That's what I mean.
[02:25:54.182 --> 02:25:56.643]  The EPA already has armed guards.
[02:25:56.643 --> 02:25:59.125]  They have armed troopers and investigators.
[02:25:59.125 --> 02:26:00.606]  No, they call them climate cops.
[02:26:00.606 --> 02:26:02.748]  I mean, your prediction's already true.
[02:26:02.748 --> 02:26:03.528]  That's what I mean.
[02:26:03.528 --> 02:26:06.951]  We have them, but I predict that there will be thousands of new.
[02:26:06.951 --> 02:26:08.232]  Thousands of new, yes.
[02:26:08.232 --> 02:26:16.478]  Yes, because you know what's going to happen is, every time you sell your house or rent your apartment, you're going to have to prove to somebody that you've got energy efficiency.
[02:26:16.478 --> 02:26:17.559]  No, that's in the bill!
[02:26:17.559 --> 02:26:18.860]  They say home inspections...
[02:26:19.860 --> 02:26:20.541]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:26:20.541 --> 02:26:22.423]  I mean, I start ranting on this issue.
[02:26:22.423 --> 02:26:23.364]  Yeah, you're exactly right.
[02:26:23.364 --> 02:26:25.206]  We debated it recently.
[02:26:25.206 --> 02:26:38.719]  I spoke before the coal-producing counties, and that's about 30 counties in Kentucky, and I debated the main Democrat opponent, Jack Conway, and Jack Conway got up there, like so many career politicians, he got up there and said,
[02:26:39.474 --> 02:26:51.286]  I'm not really sure if I'm against cap and trade or if I'm for it, but I want to be part of the negotiated legislation, so I'm not going to take a real position on it until after I'm elected.
[02:26:51.286 --> 02:26:58.253]  And what's amazing about this is he doesn't even sense, being a career politician, he's afraid to make a stand, but he doesn't even sense
[02:26:58.843 --> 02:27:04.745]  How much there's opposition, even among mainstream people within Kentucky, because of what it's going to do to energy.
[02:27:04.745 --> 02:27:19.449]  Well, they admit they're going to put in the bill a 50% tax on all coal, and what, 54% of all our energy, our power, from factories to light bulbs in our houses, to the hot water heaters, is from coal?
[02:27:19.449 --> 02:27:21.670]  I mean, does anybody have an idea what that...
[02:27:22.290 --> 02:27:23.712]  I got family in East Texas.
[02:27:23.712 --> 02:27:30.463]  The only jobs left are prisons and coal mines and the power plants that burn it.
[02:27:30.463 --> 02:27:31.044]  Right.
[02:27:31.044 --> 02:27:33.047]  And I think, once again, it's like inflation.
[02:27:38.843 --> 02:27:43.705]  Mostly hurt and will hurt disproportionately when your electric bill goes up at the end of the month.
[02:27:43.705 --> 02:27:46.286]  If you make $200,000 a year, you don't feel it.
[02:27:46.286 --> 02:27:50.627]  But if you make $25,000 a year and your electric bill goes up, you get hurt.
[02:27:50.627 --> 02:27:54.468]  And that's what's going to happen to cap and trade like any other price increase.
[02:27:54.468 --> 02:28:00.430]  It disproportionately hurts the working class and the poor and those on fixed income, the retired folks.
[02:28:00.430 --> 02:28:04.692]  All the same constituencies that the Democrats are always going out and winning those votes.
[02:28:05.228 --> 02:28:08.210]  That's why we tell people our message is good.
[02:28:08.210 --> 02:28:11.593]  We need to know how to present our message to gain more votes.
[02:28:11.593 --> 02:28:20.400]  Well, I mean, Dr. Paul, when you've studied politics for a long time, your dad's been a congressman for decades, you're a medical doctor, you're a smart guy.
[02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:25.404]  Looking at Obama's record, in your book, does he take the cake for lying?
[02:28:25.404 --> 02:28:31.048]  I mean, everything he says he's gone back on, and then he said he wouldn't raise taxes unless you made a quarter million
[02:28:32.009 --> 02:28:33.770]  Dollars a year is a couple.
[02:28:33.770 --> 02:28:39.852]  These carbon taxes are going to raise taxes on everything, and like you just said, hurt the poorest people.
[02:28:39.852 --> 02:28:42.193]  The amazing thing is he can do it with a straight face.
[02:28:42.193 --> 02:28:52.657]  As long as his teleprompter's working, he can do it with a straight face and a smile, and he can tell us how he's not going to do something at the same time his other hand is actually doing it.
[02:28:52.657 --> 02:29:01.620]  So, I guess it's just the amazing gall of politicians who tell us this, and tell us they're not going to do something, and meanwhile they're doing exactly that.
[02:29:02.273 --> 02:29:10.559]  I think it's an amazing feat how far we are going to lurch to the left and how big government's going to grow in the first six months to a year.
[02:29:10.559 --> 02:29:11.939]  But I think there'll be a backlash.
[02:29:11.939 --> 02:29:16.502]  And the only good thing I think we have going for us is there will be a backlash in 2010.
[02:29:16.502 --> 02:29:27.370]  And in my own particular race, I think Kentucky will be ripe to run against Obama because he did very poorly in the Democrat primary here against Hillary Clinton.
[02:29:27.370 --> 02:29:28.671]  She clobbered him by 30 points.
[02:29:29.671 --> 02:29:36.253]  And then even McCain, who didn't do that well and ran a lackluster campaign, he also killed Obama in Kentucky.
[02:29:36.253 --> 02:29:42.675]  So Kentucky is sort of a split state, but also a state that really doesn't like far-left-wing politics.
[02:29:42.675 --> 02:29:44.356]  Oh yeah, well, I mean, look.
[02:29:44.356 --> 02:29:44.816]  You're right.
[02:29:44.816 --> 02:29:47.256]  There's gonna be an explosive backlash.
[02:29:47.256 --> 02:29:49.017]  It's gonna catapult you into the U.S.
[02:29:49.017 --> 02:29:51.758]  Senate if you're in the election fraud.
[02:29:51.758 --> 02:29:53.138]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.138 --> 02:29:55.679]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.679 --> 02:29:58.380]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.933 --> 02:30:02.313]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.313 --> 02:30:04.294]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:30:04.294 --> 02:30:04.934]  Well, you should.
[02:30:04.934 --> 02:30:09.776]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:30:09.776 --> 02:30:10.576]  That's right.
[02:30:10.576 --> 02:30:19.239]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.

[02:30:21.960 --> 02:30:27.924]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:30:27.924 --> 02:30:34.828]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:30:34.828 --> 02:30:40.352]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:30:40.352 --> 02:30:41.813]  This is real.
[02:30:41.813 --> 02:30:42.874]  Don't miss out.
[02:30:42.874 --> 02:30:49.738]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[02:30:49.958 --> 02:30:51.419]  And get your free handgun.

[02:31:01.274 --> 02:31:06.496]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:31:06.496 --> 02:31:10.518]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:10.518 --> 02:31:16.421]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:16.421 --> 02:31:21.484]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.484 --> 02:31:21.944]  Number three,
[02:31:22.404 --> 02:31:28.706]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:31:28.706 --> 02:31:31.587]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:31:31.587 --> 02:31:36.108]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.108 --> 02:31:39.729]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:31:39.969 --> 02:31:45.696]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[02:32:01.308 --> 02:32:02.969]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:02.969 --> 02:32:07.730]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:32:07.730 --> 02:32:10.692]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:32:10.692 --> 02:32:13.713]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:32:13.713 --> 02:32:19.575]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:32:19.815 --> 02:32:23.040]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:30.050]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:32:30.050 --> 02:32:33.335]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:32:33.335 --> 02:32:33.596]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:35.919 --> 02:32:37.840]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[02:33:16.277 --> 02:33:17.918]  Folks, we had loaded phone lines.
[02:33:17.918 --> 02:33:20.939]  There were callers from all over the map earlier before Dr. Paul got on.
[02:33:20.939 --> 02:33:25.502]  We're going to take 4 or 5 calls for him before he leaves by the 50 after.
[02:33:25.502 --> 02:33:36.668]  So, if you want to talk specifically to him about Dr. Ron Paul, about himself, about his family, about the campaign, about the Campaign for Liberty, any questions dealing with fighting the globalists, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:36.668 --> 02:33:36.728]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:43.451 --> 02:33:50.118]  Specifically, Dr. Paul, the New World Order, the globalist, and your dad's talked about it for decades, got laughed at.
[02:33:50.118 --> 02:33:59.528]  Now, it's Times of London, cover of Newsweek, New World Order, world government, Bank of the World will pay our taxes too.
[02:33:59.528 --> 02:34:03.112]  If you're elected to the Senate, they are obviously going to approach you, they're going
[02:34:04.884 --> 02:34:08.165]  Certainly, you have no skeletons, and we'll try to invent them.
[02:34:08.165 --> 02:34:10.605]  Are you going to aggressively go after the Globalists?
[02:34:10.605 --> 02:34:13.326]  Because I believe the best defense is a good offense.
[02:34:13.326 --> 02:34:16.666]  Not just fighting their programs, but going after them for their crimes.
[02:34:16.666 --> 02:34:21.067]  Do you agree with your father that we need criminal investigations of the Federal Reserve?
[02:34:21.067 --> 02:34:26.068]  Yes, I think we go after the specifics, and in some ways, the media might light up more.
[02:34:26.068 --> 02:34:32.229]  They have recently lit up thinking that Goldman Sachs and Paulson may have been doing something to enrich themselves.
[02:34:32.745 --> 02:34:45.208]  So I think if we can paint it and expose it as people personally becoming wealthy off of the system and not let them get away with the fact that they say, oh, the Fed's independent, it has our best interest at heart.
[02:34:45.208 --> 02:34:53.110]  If we can show specifically where individuals are benefiting by government policy that then hurts the rest of us, absolutely I think we should do that.
[02:34:53.632 --> 02:35:12.518]  Well, I saw a video that we have time, we'll play it later, it's been up on InfoWars.com for a couple days of Paulson being questioned by House members and admitting he personally got $200 million off of money he transferred and saying that's not a conflict of interest because a White House ethics office signed off on it.
[02:35:12.518 --> 02:35:15.119]  I mean, this is really getting sick.
[02:35:15.119 --> 02:35:18.520]  Well, you know, you remember Paulson's first bill for the TARP Act, it was like,
[02:35:19.113 --> 02:35:24.778]  Three paragraphs just saying, appoint me king and let me do whatever I want with the money system.
[02:35:24.778 --> 02:35:33.105]  And they shot that down, but then they made it 1,100 pages of obscure legalese, and we got probably just as bad or worse.
[02:35:33.105 --> 02:35:35.847]  Now the TARP Act is used for the car bailout.
[02:35:35.847 --> 02:35:40.571]  I even saw the other day that the minority broadcasters are going to try to get money from the TARP Act.
[02:35:42.398 --> 02:35:44.300]  Oh, it's just amazing.
[02:35:44.300 --> 02:35:49.506]  They're raising, I saw in New York State, 84 taxes they've passed.
[02:35:49.506 --> 02:35:51.508]  All these other states are passing new taxes.
[02:35:51.508 --> 02:35:59.115]  Here in conservative Texas, every month I have new taxing authorities knocking on my door telling me that they're going to come in and assess me.
[02:35:59.996 --> 02:36:01.878]  How much can the public put up with?
[02:36:01.878 --> 02:36:09.606]  I saw a report that in Texas, and I've seen in other states, 10% or more of the public have warrants out for unpaid tickets.
[02:36:09.606 --> 02:36:13.830]  I mean, are they just going to squeeze us like the Sheriff of Nottingham?
[02:36:13.830 --> 02:36:18.274]  Well, I saw the other day they're going after a woman in Pennsylvania for not paying her cigarette tax.
[02:36:18.274 --> 02:36:23.079]  She's been ordering her cigarettes online for a couple years, and they put a lien against her house.
[02:36:23.079 --> 02:36:23.739]  Not so funny.
[02:36:25.100 --> 02:36:26.921]  You know, they're aggressive and they will do it.
[02:36:26.921 --> 02:36:28.602]  I think there has to be a breaking point.
[02:36:28.602 --> 02:36:33.424]  Taxes eventually get so high that I think there will be a breaking point.
[02:36:33.424 --> 02:36:42.288]  I think, for example, on cigarettes, we've probably gotten high enough that there is going to be, there probably already is, but there will be even a bigger black market probably for cigarettes.
[02:36:42.288 --> 02:36:49.311]  People will eventually avoid the government taxes completely because the prices will become so high.
[02:36:49.311 --> 02:36:50.272]  It's just incredible.
[02:36:52.455 --> 02:36:56.157]  If the Senate passes, more of a reason to have you in the U.S.
[02:36:56.157 --> 02:37:02.240]  Senate, passes the cap-and-trade, I was reading the actual bill that they kept 300 pages secret until after it passed.
[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:06.122]  As you know, Dr. Rand Paul, running for Senate in Kentucky, joining us.
[02:37:06.122 --> 02:37:07.763]  We're about to announce running for Senate, hopefully.
[02:37:09.855 --> 02:37:15.278]  If they were able to get that through, it just gives this executive power, kind of like Paulson saying, make me God.
[02:37:15.278 --> 02:37:22.303]  They have gun bills that just say the Attorney General can ban any guns he wants, or he can put you on a no-fly, no-gun buy list.
[02:37:22.303 --> 02:37:27.206]  It seems the federal government is moving to this imperial model.
[02:37:27.206 --> 02:37:30.768]  Well, and it's always lost in thousands of pages of legalese.
[02:37:30.768 --> 02:37:37.752]  For example, in the Health Care Act, they've named the Health Care Act something like the Free Choice Health Reform Act of 2009.
[02:37:39.366 --> 02:37:40.126]  But you know what?
[02:37:40.126 --> 02:37:44.928]  The more friendly it sounds in the title, the more ominous it is if you read the nitty-gritty.
[02:37:44.928 --> 02:37:55.311]  In that Health Care Act, there's actually, uh, part of it says that when you leave your company or change insurance policies, you'll only be able to buy insurance that's approved by the government.
[02:37:55.311 --> 02:38:05.815]  And they already have the restrictions in there on what you can sell, and I think things like health savings accounts, which are part of the solution to our problems, will probably not be sold after this health care reform passes.
[02:38:07.068 --> 02:38:07.649]  Incredible.
[02:38:07.649 --> 02:38:09.113]  I want to take a few final calls.
[02:38:09.113 --> 02:38:15.466]  People should certainly visit the website that we have up on screen at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:38:15.466 --> 02:38:16.689]  They should get ready for the money bomb.
[02:38:17.950 --> 02:38:20.072]  That is coming up as well.
[02:38:20.072 --> 02:38:23.194]  RandPaul2010.com.
[02:38:23.194 --> 02:38:24.915]  RandPaul2010.com.
[02:38:24.915 --> 02:38:44.069]  We've got links up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, but you made a joke during the break that you wouldn't let the Bilderberg Group, if you get elected to the Senate, drag you off to a secret meeting, but if you were there joking that you would certainly wave at me while I was bullhorning from the outside.
[02:38:44.069 --> 02:38:45.991]  If you get elected to the Senate,
[02:38:47.290 --> 02:38:50.891]  If you get elected to the Senate, what are you going to do when these people approach you?
[02:38:50.891 --> 02:38:52.312]  Are you going to blow the whistle on them?
[02:38:52.312 --> 02:38:54.313]  Well, I have to correct you a little bit on that, Alex.
[02:38:54.313 --> 02:38:57.994]  What I said is I wouldn't join the Bilderbergers, you know, for philosophic reasons.
[02:38:57.994 --> 02:39:05.196]  But the other reason I wouldn't join is because I'd be afraid Alex Jones would be outside the meeting with the Bullhorn calling me out.
[02:39:05.196 --> 02:39:14.860]  So, absolutely, I wouldn't, but I've seen your videos calling a few of them out and interviewing a few of them, and for some reason they get quite testy with you if you ask them questions about it.
[02:39:15.881 --> 02:39:16.821]  They certainly did.
[02:39:16.821 --> 02:39:17.962]  No, you refresh my memory.
[02:39:17.962 --> 02:39:27.725]  We were coming into break, the music was already playing, and we were bantering and laughing back and forth, and I meant to say, I hope that you would go to Bilderberg and then come out and expose them.
[02:39:27.725 --> 02:39:28.845]  Okay.
[02:39:28.845 --> 02:39:43.250]  Yeah, I don't know if that would be possible or not, but yeah, I think we should expose people who are, you know, promoting this globalist agenda for personal gain and for financial gain at the expense of the rest of our country and at the expense of our republic.
[02:39:43.951 --> 02:39:52.038]  Well, we're going to go to calls in a moment, but I want to just say this now, here, before you run for Senate, before you win, or certainly give them one hell of a run.
[02:39:53.698 --> 02:40:07.770]  That people need to support you from the start to the middle to the finish and then after because it is quite a load to take running for office and to really try to win, to put your private life in the crosshairs.
[02:40:07.770 --> 02:40:09.911]  I know a lot of people that know your family well.
[02:40:09.911 --> 02:40:12.233]  I've known your dad for 13 years.
[02:40:12.233 --> 02:40:17.117]  Very upright, incredibly hard, work ethic, good Christian people.
[02:40:18.041 --> 02:40:23.583]  Interviewed your uncle, Wayne Paul, last week, and another amazing individual fighting for liberty and freedom.
[02:40:23.583 --> 02:40:33.048]  But people need to understand, they're going to manufacture stuff about you, they're going to lie about you, they're going to take things out of context out about you, and people don't need to ninny.
[02:40:33.048 --> 02:40:46.974]  They need to just get behind you guys and move forward, because we'd be in a lot worse position today if Ron Paul hadn't have run and educated millions of people about the true nature of the political and economic system.
[02:40:47.794 --> 02:40:50.839]  And I just want to get your take on this here now.
[02:40:50.839 --> 02:40:59.751]  Look at how it did backfire though when, for the movie Bruno, Sacha Baron Cohen, and I didn't cover this when it first came out until your dad had commented on it,
[02:41:01.250 --> 02:41:08.878]  They've got an interview going, they say the light breaks, they say, please step in here, and he pulls his pants down and basically tries to block the door.
[02:41:08.878 --> 02:41:13.402]  And then the media tried to spin it like Ron Paul caught in a bad position.
[02:41:13.402 --> 02:41:18.748]  And then it came out that they called him in a room, cornered him, and really almost tried to sexually assault him.
[02:41:18.748 --> 02:41:20.350]  That was done on purpose.
[02:41:20.350 --> 02:41:22.032]  Sacha Baron Cohen is a globalist.
[02:41:22.552 --> 02:41:25.653]  And it's not just funny, though it's the number one movie right now.
[02:41:25.653 --> 02:41:33.417]  I just want to bring that up and warn people that they mean business and are going to try dirty tricks, but that did end up blowing up in their face.
[02:41:33.417 --> 02:41:41.040]  But can you comment on that and then comment overall on gutting up to do this, but also that people need to be ready for all sorts of chicanery?
[02:41:41.937 --> 02:41:47.339]  Well, the thing about that movie that really sort of makes me mad is that my dad gives so much of his time.
[02:41:47.339 --> 02:41:48.700]  He is an upright man.
[02:41:48.700 --> 02:41:50.160]  He's been married for 50 years.
[02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:56.623]  He doesn't need and he doesn't deserve that kind of behavior by somebody that really is almost like an assault.
[02:41:56.623 --> 02:42:03.445]  I mean, it really, I think, is so, uh, so beneath what we should have to deal with in public discourse.
[02:42:03.445 --> 02:42:09.928]  The other thing is, is while not much for lawsuit, there was a woman that he shocked, that did something shocking to the actor did.
[02:42:10.641 --> 02:42:16.871]  Uh, at like a PTA meeting or a church, uh, social, and she fell and hit her head and had a bleed and a stroke.
[02:42:17.341 --> 02:42:25.748]  And she is suing him, and I say, Godspeed, I hope she gets a bunch of money out of that guy, because it really is unfair to misrepresent yourself.
[02:42:25.748 --> 02:42:28.330]  Well, it's also... Sorry, go ahead.
[02:42:28.330 --> 02:42:46.305]  I just think it's unfair to misrepresent people and to come in and do that, and it's this whole shocking thing, but it's kind of what's made our country go downhill, I think, culturally and as a people, that we have such trash on TV, such trash in the movies, and, you know, the more we get of it, it inures us, and it makes us
[02:42:46.718 --> 02:42:54.357]  I think that, you know, that stuff is okay because it's all over TV and the movies, and so the moral standard gets lower and lower.
[02:42:55.609 --> 02:42:57.730]  Well it's also very dangerous.
[02:42:57.730 --> 02:43:04.413]  We're showing some of the video here where they're doing the interview and the light breaks and they ask him to step into a room and then that's what my wife called it.
[02:43:04.413 --> 02:43:09.275]  My wife as a woman got very upset saying if that had been a woman he'd have probably gone to jail.
[02:43:09.275 --> 02:43:17.639]  I mean getting somebody in a room and then sexually advancing on them and your father basically shoves him out of the way and screams at him and runs out of the room
[02:43:19.997 --> 02:43:21.318]  Yeah, sort of a double standard.
[02:43:21.318 --> 02:43:33.983]  I think really there should be some kind of assault charge pressed, but the problem is with politicians is none of these things hold up in court, and we don't really have much for defamation in our country either.
[02:43:33.983 --> 02:43:42.867]  They end up, you know, if any of the Hollywood actors are ever defamed or accused of something they didn't do, they go and sue them in England, because in England apparently you can win defamation.
[02:43:43.772 --> 02:43:46.073]  Here, I guess there's just not much recourse.
[02:43:46.073 --> 02:43:52.335]  But you were talking about winning, and one of the amazing things is, because you hear people back and forth on my dad's campaign, you know, he didn't win.
[02:43:52.335 --> 02:44:02.699]  You know, in many ways he did win, because I look at it every time I see him on the television now, I say, we've got somebody that represents our point of view who is getting some attention.
[02:44:02.699 --> 02:44:06.220]  We aren't yet winning the battles, but we're at least included in the debate.
[02:44:06.690 --> 02:44:22.779]  Before he ran in 2007-2008, our side, other than you, Alex, and some of the people on talk radio, we really weren't getting a fair shake or getting any kind of representation as far as part of the debate, and now we are.
[02:44:22.779 --> 02:44:28.362]  Well, I've never really talked about the Sacha Baron Cohen situation here much.
[02:44:28.362 --> 02:44:34.005]  The reason I brought it up to you, Dr. Paul, is because I think you need to be ready for these types of setups, and I think
[02:44:34.830 --> 02:44:41.695]  Well, I mean, we know the Federal Reserve means business, and we know the Federal Reserve was clearly implicated in kidnapping a congressman's baby.
[02:44:41.695 --> 02:44:44.357]  We know that they've done hit pieces on folks.
[02:44:44.357 --> 02:44:46.358]  This is the global ruling elite.
[02:44:46.358 --> 02:44:55.325]  I just wanted to commend you for your courage, your father's courage, and I also wanted listeners to know that once we commit to supporting you, we're committed.
[02:44:55.325 --> 02:44:57.046]  This is a war, and that's it.
[02:44:57.046 --> 02:45:01.850]  And I'm asking my listeners to fully commit to you and your father and the work they've been doing.
[02:45:02.844 --> 02:45:11.371]  Well I appreciate that and we can't do it without you and I was involved in the grassroots part of the campaign across the United States for my father.
[02:45:11.371 --> 02:45:18.857]  I met a lot of the grassroots supporters and if there's anything we can do we're really going to try to include the grassroots in this.
[02:45:18.857 --> 02:45:29.325]  We've already had students, I'm going to meet some students on Saturday night who traveled here, some of them from Idaho, California and Indiana and various states that are already campaigning for me here in the state.
[02:45:29.912 --> 02:45:36.494]  So, we're going to do what we can and anything that your listeners or the grassroots do for us, we will be very much appreciative.
[02:45:37.293 --> 02:45:37.954]  Absolutely.
[02:45:37.954 --> 02:45:42.637]  Well, we just appreciate you and all the great work you've done, Dr. Rand Paul.
[02:45:42.637 --> 02:45:49.403]  And again, the website for folks that want to visit it is runranrun.com is the Money Bomb site.
[02:45:49.403 --> 02:45:56.609]  And then his official site is ranpaul2010.com and it is up right now, so that's good.
[02:45:56.609 --> 02:45:58.450]  Servers are testing out nicely there.
[02:45:58.450 --> 02:46:05.035]  We'll take a few calls and then we're going to end this official interview with Dr. Paul here in just about five minutes.
[02:46:06.037 --> 02:46:08.586]  In Ohio, then Mike in Sweden, Michael in Mass.
[02:46:08.586 --> 02:46:10.192]  That'll be the three calls we have time for.
[02:46:10.192 --> 02:46:11.798]  Matt, you're on the air with Dr. Rand Paul.
[02:46:12.912 --> 02:46:22.861]  Hello, I appreciate you taking my call, but I wanted to say thank you, Dr. Paul, for hopefully choosing to run for the Senate.
[02:46:22.861 --> 02:46:39.054]  I think you definitely stand up for every person in the country who honors individualism and honors the Constitution when you do that, because there certainly aren't many alternatives who are running for office who do represent those values.
[02:46:39.054 --> 02:46:39.575]  My question
[02:46:40.253 --> 02:46:42.715]  I was regarding the Federal Reserve.
[02:46:42.715 --> 02:46:59.971]  What do you think the odds are that the Federal Reserve may bankrupt itself by the activities in buying up all these toxic assets, these CDSs and car companies and whatnot, similar to the way it bankrupted itself in the 30s, or at least allegedly did?
[02:47:00.660 --> 02:47:12.229]  I don't know that that was ever made public, and the fact that the response back then was to make owning gold legal, collect gold in order to shore up the Federal Reserve's balance.
[02:47:15.059 --> 02:47:20.947]  What are the odds that that would happen again, and what do you think would be the response by the nation this time?
[02:47:20.947 --> 02:47:27.095]  Yeah, what's going to happen if they try to ban the gold, give us paperback, and then double the price a year later?
[02:47:27.095 --> 02:47:28.397]  Are Americans going to put up with that?
[02:47:28.397 --> 02:47:30.360]  I mean, most people didn't turn it in back then.
[02:47:31.038 --> 02:47:31.318]  Right.
[02:47:31.318 --> 02:47:36.782]  I don't think the Federal Reserve really will go bankrupt because they basically control the money.
[02:47:36.782 --> 02:47:39.464]  So what happens is we get bankruptcy in another form.
[02:47:39.464 --> 02:47:44.748]  They liquidate the debt by printing up so much money that they pay back the debt with cheap money.
[02:47:44.748 --> 02:47:45.288]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:47:45.288 --> 02:47:50.472]  So that's what's going to happen is the real danger is not a bankruptcy of the Federal Reserve.
[02:47:50.472 --> 02:47:55.175]  The danger is, I think, runaway inflation where the money becomes worthless.
[02:47:55.175 --> 02:47:56.416]  I fear more a time
[02:47:56.846 --> 02:48:02.930]  Like the Weimar Republic in 1923, where the Germans carried their money around in wheelbarrows.
[02:48:02.930 --> 02:48:09.214]  The workers were paid twice a day, because between noon and five o'clock, the money lost half its value.
[02:48:09.214 --> 02:48:14.117]  That's the kind of situation I fear, and the unrest and the civil disorder that comes with destroying the money.
[02:48:14.682 --> 02:48:21.286]  Whether or not people will give up their gold, I think people will give up their gold about as likely as they will be to give up their guns anymore.
[02:48:21.286 --> 02:48:24.088]  And I think that's the one good thing we have going on in America.
[02:48:24.088 --> 02:48:28.670]  There's a lot of still independent spirit in the countryside.
[02:48:28.670 --> 02:48:34.274]  We don't necessarily see it from our politicians, but there's a lot of independent spirit out there that's not going to give up easily.
[02:48:35.475 --> 02:48:49.466]  Well, speaking of lying, they've introduced scores of bills, the most draconian anti-Second Amendment ever, and then they get up on the news and say it's all a conspiracy theory, stop buying guns at record levels, stop buying ammo.
[02:48:49.466 --> 02:48:53.769]  I mean, how dumb do the Democratic Party think we are?
[02:48:53.769 --> 02:48:55.331]  I mean, this is insane!
[02:48:55.331 --> 02:49:00.615]  And Sotomayor wrote a book saying we have no right, and they're about to confirm her?
[02:49:02.316 --> 02:49:06.258]  Don't the Democrats and the establishment understand that this will start a shooting war?
[02:49:06.258 --> 02:49:14.103]  Yeah, all you have to do is show up at the machine gun shootout in Knob Creek.
[02:49:14.103 --> 02:49:16.284]  I was there earlier this year.
[02:49:16.284 --> 02:49:22.808]  3,000 people came that day, and those are 3,000 people that aren't giving up their guns and ammo too easily.
[02:49:22.808 --> 02:49:23.308]  Absolutely.
[02:49:23.308 --> 02:49:24.489]  Let's take one more call here.
[02:49:24.489 --> 02:49:25.189]  Maybe keep you over.
[02:49:25.189 --> 02:49:27.090]  You agreed to do the hour, but I don't want to keep you too long.
[02:49:27.090 --> 02:49:28.291]  Mike in Sweden.
[02:49:28.291 --> 02:49:29.992]  You're on the air with Dr. Rand Paul.
[02:49:29.992 --> 02:49:30.292]  Go ahead.
[02:49:31.499 --> 02:49:33.180]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:49:33.180 --> 02:49:35.501]  I appreciate your work, Mr. Paul.
[02:49:35.501 --> 02:49:42.945]  I was just wondering, Alex, if you and Dr. Paul know anything about the Baha'i Faith and their plan for a New World Order?
[02:49:44.580 --> 02:49:55.327]  I know that's like a sponsored UN religion, and I've run into Baha'i folks that are listeners, and I've run into some that are pro-globalist, but I don't know that much about it.
[02:49:55.327 --> 02:49:57.768]  Kind of a strange question for our guest.
[02:49:57.768 --> 02:49:59.289]  I'm unfamiliar with it.
[02:49:59.289 --> 02:50:00.630]  Yeah, we're unfamiliar.
[02:50:00.630 --> 02:50:02.972]  Would you like to tell us about it?
[02:50:02.972 --> 02:50:08.415]  Yeah, it says on Wikipedia that the system that they envision for the future involves
[02:50:09.309 --> 02:50:19.776]  A world parliament, a world police force, a binding world tribunal, and a universal bill of human rights, and so forth.
[02:50:19.776 --> 02:50:21.858]  Well, I know a lot of religions are pushing that.
[02:50:21.858 --> 02:50:24.359]  In fact, Rand Paul agreed to stay to the end of the hour.
[02:50:24.359 --> 02:50:25.620]  I'm just going to let him go early.
[02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:26.361]  Stay there, Doc.
[02:50:26.361 --> 02:50:28.743]  I want to get your comment on this on the other end.
[02:50:28.743 --> 02:50:34.747]  Plug the Moneybomb address one more time and take one more call from Michael and Mass because I want to get your take on
[02:50:35.807 --> 02:50:40.729]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to
[02:51:06.912 --> 02:51:07.213]  I think so.
[02:51:22.526 --> 02:51:22.866]  I think so.

[02:51:51.438 --> 02:51:53.359]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[02:51:53.359 --> 02:51:54.220]  Or, call 1-877-99-BERKEY.

[02:52:02.248 --> 02:52:08.271]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:08.271 --> 02:52:14.175]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:52:14.175 --> 02:52:20.318]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:20.658 --> 02:52:22.640]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:22.640 --> 02:52:25.082]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:25.082 --> 02:52:38.272]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:52:38.272 --> 02:52:39.953]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.953 --> 02:52:41.815]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:52:41.815 --> 02:52:48.040]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:52:56.981 --> 02:52:58.563]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:58.563 --> 02:52:59.745]  The people strike back!
[02:53:01.548 --> 02:53:04.989]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:53:04.989 --> 02:53:09.251]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:53:09.251 --> 02:53:20.895]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[02:53:20.895 --> 02:53:26.737]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[02:53:26.817 --> 02:53:27.157]  I think so.
[02:53:49.855 --> 02:53:50.236]  We're good.
[02:54:07.699 --> 02:54:14.204]  Hey folks, there are the new ball hats that are up on the InfoWars.com online video bookstore.
[02:54:14.204 --> 02:54:19.687]  Now with over 25 t-shirts spreading the Liberty message and a whole bunch of different ball caps.
[02:54:19.687 --> 02:54:20.768]  That's just the three newest.
[02:54:20.768 --> 02:54:22.629]  Don't tread on me and come and take it.
[02:54:22.629 --> 02:54:24.190]  All right, final minutes.
[02:54:24.190 --> 02:54:30.475]  I want to talk to Michael and Maz with the Dr. Rand Paul website, RandPaul2010.com or RunRandRun.com for the
[02:54:33.817 --> 02:54:36.879]  The money bomb coming up in the 20th of next month.
[02:54:36.879 --> 02:54:38.960]  We'll have him back on, maybe even his dad on.
[02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:40.201]  Ron Paul's on next week.
[02:54:40.201 --> 02:54:45.124]  My producer got the hours wrong, so he's on with his doctor, Ron Paul.
[02:54:45.124 --> 02:54:48.006]  The father of Rand Paul's on next week for us for 30 minutes.
[02:54:48.006 --> 02:54:49.287]  Talk about a host of issues.
[02:54:49.287 --> 02:54:52.949]  Rand, I was asking you about John P. Holdren, the science-art.
[02:54:52.949 --> 02:54:55.651]  You said you'd heard about it in the news, but not the details.
[02:54:55.651 --> 02:55:00.014]  But generally, these social planners admit they want socialized health care.
[02:55:00.014 --> 02:55:01.715]  They want carbon tax, he says.
[02:55:02.355 --> 02:55:07.437]  Well, if I were there, we'd get to expose it before he's gotten a hearing or during the hearings.
[02:55:07.437 --> 02:55:09.877]  These hearings, that's exactly what they're for.
[02:55:09.877 --> 02:55:15.339]  Wouldn't it be great to have a voice in the Senate that could expose this before he gets approved?
[02:55:26.007 --> 02:55:28.108]  Dr. Paul, do you think the New World Order is going to succeed?
[02:55:28.108 --> 02:55:34.309]  I mean, we're really seeing an awakening happen right now that we couldn't have imagined years ago, but is it going to be enough?
[02:55:34.309 --> 02:55:41.931]  Well, I think when you go back, you know, one way to look at it is probably 30 years ago, nobody thought there'd be one currency in Europe.
[02:55:41.931 --> 02:55:54.734]  Right now, most people don't think there could be one currency in our country, and yet the talk of the Amaro is out there, and they poofoo it, they try to describe us as crazy or off the wall, but they are talking about it, and I think they're
[02:55:55.333 --> 02:56:02.197]  Way of getting to most things is gradualism, although I think Obama's doing a sudden move forward on a lot of things.
[02:56:02.197 --> 02:56:08.441]  Yeah, I think there's a huge danger of it, and I think the problem is that we have so many politicians on both sides
[02:56:08.888 --> 02:56:22.938]  That are these career politicians, and the ones that evolve to the top of the Republican and the Democrat Party, end up being the people who don't believe in anything, who really don't have any ideology, and they get pushed around by the New World Order types.
[02:56:22.938 --> 02:56:25.219]  The sellouts, the social climbers.
[02:56:25.219 --> 02:56:27.921]  Exactly.
[02:56:27.921 --> 02:56:33.805]  What, in 60 seconds, what can everybody do to make sure you run for Senate, you win for Senate?
[02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:41.853]  If you can go to our website and if you can also pledge for the money bomb, we will turn this race completely upside down.
[02:56:41.853 --> 02:56:45.680]  If we raise a million dollars on August 20th, there's no stopping us.
[02:56:46.351 --> 02:56:52.455]  We will have a odds-on, even chance of winning our race if we raise a million in one day.
[02:56:52.455 --> 02:56:54.376]  It'll be a national story.
[02:56:54.376 --> 02:56:55.817]  It'll be a statewide story.
[02:56:55.817 --> 02:56:59.419]  It will be all over the press if we raise a million dollars in one day.
[02:56:59.419 --> 02:57:02.601]  And the media loves to criticize you guys trying to raise money.
[02:57:02.601 --> 02:57:03.481]  How dare them?
[02:57:03.481 --> 02:57:06.243]  The globalists take our money, use it against us.
[02:57:06.243 --> 02:57:12.147]  You're asking for it if you want somebody in Washington to stop the thieving, stop the gang raping.
[02:57:12.147 --> 02:57:15.288]  Quickly, Michael and Mash, you got time for a 30-second question.
[02:57:15.288 --> 02:57:15.889]  Go ahead, Michael.
[02:57:16.568 --> 02:57:21.672]  Dr. Paul, I've got a good question, but I want to tell you right off the bat, I've got $150 in your name on it, buddy.
[02:57:21.672 --> 02:57:23.634]  Alright, thanks.
[02:57:23.634 --> 02:57:25.275]  Alright, I wanted to talk about perception.
[02:57:25.275 --> 02:57:27.677]  I asked your father about this before on the Jones Show.
[02:57:27.677 --> 02:57:38.125]  It seems to me that the main problem that the American people have with the New World Order and globalism in general is they don't have an accurate perception of what is going on here.
[02:57:38.125 --> 02:57:39.786]  Have you ever read things like
[02:57:40.276 --> 02:57:42.257]  Yes, I have not read that book, The Effect of Science.
[02:58:05.771 --> 02:58:18.190]  Yeah I just was hoping you could perhaps before you make this run educate yourself specifically on that because it's these techniques that are going to be used against you and if you understand it
[02:58:18.806 --> 02:58:21.328]  It will be, you know, it just won't work.
[02:58:21.328 --> 02:58:23.130]  Well, he's a smart guy.
[02:58:23.130 --> 02:58:26.613]  Yeah, and he's got guts and the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and that's enough.
[02:58:26.613 --> 02:58:27.593]  We're behind him.
[02:58:27.593 --> 02:58:31.477]  Dr. Rand Paul, we'll have you back on right before the money bomb.
[02:58:31.477 --> 02:58:33.058]  We'll have your dad talk about it as well.
[02:58:33.058 --> 02:58:34.159]  God bless you.
[02:58:34.159 --> 02:58:34.899]  Godspeed.
[02:58:34.899 --> 02:58:37.642]  And we really appreciate your time with us today.
[02:58:37.642 --> 02:58:39.243]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:58:39.243 --> 02:58:40.024]  Great guy, folks.
[02:58:40.024 --> 02:58:42.926]  Get behind him.
[02:58:42.926 --> 02:58:44.247]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.318 --> 02:58:51.099]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:51.099 --> 02:58:55.340]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:58:55.340 --> 02:58:57.340]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:58:57.340 --> 02:59:05.862]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:59:05.862 --> 02:59:11.403]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:59:11.403 --> 02:59:13.023]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:59:13.263 --> 02:59:19.787]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:59:19.787 --> 02:59:30.835]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[02:59:30.835 --> 02:59:31.615]  That's right.
[02:59:31.615 --> 02:59:34.177]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:59:34.177 --> 02:59:35.998]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[02:59:35.998 --> 02:59:36.258]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:59:36.258 --> 02:59:37.439]  Or visit acolablue.com.
[02:59:43.183 --> 02:59:48.868]  on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:59:48.868 --> 02:59:50.150]  That's ecoloble.com.
[03:00:20.234 --> 03:00:30.326]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, coming up in about 20 minutes we're going to look again at the new developments, new government documents about the OSS CIA killing Patton and Wines.
[03:00:30.326 --> 03:00:32.709]  Just to give you an idea of how ruthless these people are.
[03:00:32.709 --> 03:00:33.991]  But I've got some other issues.
[03:00:35.905 --> 03:00:37.126]  I want to get into right now.
[03:00:37.126 --> 03:00:48.271]  Burt Nemo wrote a great story yesterday at Infowars.com titled, Jay Rockefeller can't deny his connection to modern eugenics.
[03:00:48.271 --> 03:00:51.533]  The headline could have been, Jay Rockefeller confronted on eugenics.
[03:00:52.543 --> 03:00:53.464]  Now, it is a fact.
[03:00:53.464 --> 03:00:55.287]  It is in the encyclopedia.
[03:00:55.287 --> 03:00:57.489]  It is mainline history.
[03:00:57.489 --> 03:01:04.718]  Any book you get on the history of eugenics will tell you the Rockefellers took the idea from England, funded it in Germany, England, the U.S.
[03:01:04.718 --> 03:01:06.541]  Millions and millions of dollars in 1900 money.
[03:01:08.902 --> 03:01:12.844]  The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, all of them, Cold Springs Harbor, USA.
[03:01:12.844 --> 03:01:14.865]  They're behind it today.
[03:01:14.865 --> 03:01:22.069]  Just a month ago, it was in the news, secret meeting of the rich at Rockefeller University calling for world population reduction.
[03:01:22.069 --> 03:01:27.852]  IBM, they funded the creation of IBM and the Hollerith machines and all of it.
[03:01:27.852 --> 03:01:30.334]  So Senator Jay Rockefeller, this horrible demon,
[03:01:31.462 --> 03:01:34.824]  Who openly wants to restrict free speech on the internet and the rest of it.
[03:01:34.824 --> 03:01:40.807]  There's a We Are Change video up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:01:40.807 --> 03:01:44.869]  And they've got some of the history of the Rockefellers first from a documentary about the Rockefellers.
[03:01:44.869 --> 03:01:50.731]  But let's just queue up to the first clip and then the second clip, guys, in the Rockefeller video.
[03:01:50.731 --> 03:01:51.212]  You have it ready?
[03:01:51.974 --> 03:01:52.694]  Perfect.
[03:01:52.694 --> 03:01:53.815]  Where?
[03:01:53.815 --> 03:01:55.816]  They're at the Senate office buildings.
[03:01:55.816 --> 03:01:56.457]  He's there.
[03:01:56.457 --> 03:01:58.037]  They're confronting him.
[03:01:58.037 --> 03:01:59.458]  And he's with a group of constituents.
[03:01:59.458 --> 03:02:00.799]  He starts leaving.
[03:02:00.799 --> 03:02:04.461]  But he talks about another group at Schumer's office.
[03:02:04.461 --> 03:02:06.702]  And this is happening.
[03:02:06.702 --> 03:02:08.523]  They're asking these people real questions.
[03:02:08.523 --> 03:02:10.664]  And he goes, no, I'm not going to talk about Bilderberg.
[03:02:10.664 --> 03:02:11.905]  And I'm not going to talk about eugenics.
[03:02:11.905 --> 03:02:15.487]  Then he tells Luke, you've got a lot of balls, boy.
[03:02:15.487 --> 03:02:16.548]  You ought to run for Congress.
[03:02:17.802 --> 03:02:25.223]  And the guy's like 7'1", so even on his big crutches like some demonic spider or something.
[03:02:25.223 --> 03:02:27.104]  We have to call them out.
[03:02:27.104 --> 03:02:33.325]  They operate because we're nice, we're friendly, we lay down to them, we don't have a fighting instinct anymore.
[03:02:33.325 --> 03:02:40.086]  We gotta recapture that, get that back, get angry, realize this is the enemy, not the brown people in caves.
[03:02:40.086 --> 03:02:42.507]  Oh, Homeland Security's for the brown people, let's kill them.
[03:02:42.507 --> 03:02:43.667]  No, it's for us!
[03:02:43.667 --> 03:02:44.147]  All of us!
[03:02:45.151 --> 03:02:46.652]  This whole system's for us.
[03:02:46.652 --> 03:02:48.353]  We gotta get our tribalism back.
[03:02:48.353 --> 03:02:51.415]  Your enemy is the man on your screen.
[03:02:51.415 --> 03:02:53.195]  Put Senator Rockefeller on screen.
[03:02:53.195 --> 03:02:54.516]  Here it is.
[03:02:54.516 --> 03:02:55.537]  Senator Rockefeller?
[03:02:55.537 --> 03:02:55.917]  Yes.
[03:02:55.917 --> 03:03:04.182]  I'd like to know if you're aware that we, the American people, are aware of the agenda of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Bilderberg Group.
[03:03:04.182 --> 03:03:07.844]  And if you could comment on that, please, because it's very concerning to a lot of us.
[03:03:07.844 --> 03:03:10.065]  You know, I have 37 people lined up
[03:03:10.951 --> 03:03:13.072]  Right outside Senator Schumer's office.
[03:03:13.072 --> 03:03:15.633]  All of them wanting to answer precisely that question.
[03:03:15.633 --> 03:03:18.215]  Well, could you just take a brief moment and let us... No.
[03:03:18.215 --> 03:03:19.355]  No, because we're not talking.
[03:03:19.355 --> 03:03:20.856]  We're talking about something we're looking at.
[03:03:20.856 --> 03:03:24.978]  Well, something that's so important, it sort of transcends everything else that we're talking about, sir.
[03:03:24.978 --> 03:03:26.678]  Can you comment on that, please?
[03:03:26.678 --> 03:03:27.759]  No.
[03:03:27.759 --> 03:03:33.302]  I'd like to know about the Bilderberg Group.
[03:03:33.302 --> 03:03:36.243]  I'd like to know about the Bilderberg Group, sir.
[03:03:36.243 --> 03:03:38.204]  Well, that's not part of our discussion.
[03:03:38.897 --> 03:03:40.417]  When can we discuss that with you, sir?
[03:03:40.417 --> 03:03:40.917]  Okay.
[03:03:40.917 --> 03:03:41.478]  Thank you.
[03:03:41.478 --> 03:03:41.818]  Thank you.
[03:03:41.818 --> 03:03:44.438]  Okay, and this is for the Senator.
[03:03:44.438 --> 03:03:49.639]  This is the scientific proof of the nanothermite that's been found on trees.
[03:03:49.639 --> 03:03:52.760]  It was in the orchards, I guess, by scientists from around the world.
[03:03:52.760 --> 03:04:00.981]  Basically, conclusive proof that there's an Article 3, Section 3 treasonous cover-up going on about 9-11, sir, so... We'd love to get your opinion on that, too, sir.
[03:04:00.981 --> 03:04:01.861]  Wait, what did you say?
[03:04:01.861 --> 03:04:03.102]  Excuse me, folks.
[03:04:03.102 --> 03:04:03.642]  Thank you.
[03:04:03.642 --> 03:04:03.982]  Okay.
[03:04:03.982 --> 03:04:04.262]  Thank you.
[03:04:06.164 --> 03:04:13.787]  That's where the video cuts into some history they put in.
[03:04:13.787 --> 03:04:18.349]  We'll come back, re-air the old piece and the new piece you haven't seen yet.
[03:04:18.349 --> 03:04:19.909]  Just the great job citizens are doing.
[03:04:19.909 --> 03:04:27.993]  I don't care if you're an Info Warrior group, I don't care if you're We Are Change, a 9-11 Truth group, a Campaign for Liberty group, a local Liberty meetup group.
[03:04:27.993 --> 03:04:30.514]  Call it whatever name you want, something catchy.
[03:04:30.514 --> 03:04:33.755]  Form an organization, go out and start asking politicians real questions.
[03:04:34.690 --> 03:04:37.911]  And of course, Senator Rockefeller knows all about this.
[03:04:37.911 --> 03:04:47.534]  We're going to come back with Luke confronting him here in just a moment, but I want to commend Stuart, Luke, all the great folks from different We Are Change crews all over the world, all over the country, being there.
[03:04:47.534 --> 03:04:49.715]  Just absolutely fabulous.
[03:04:49.715 --> 03:04:56.637]  Again, the article, Jay Rockefeller can't deny his connection to modern eugenics, confronted by reporters, is up on the site right now.
[03:05:01.121 --> 03:05:06.963]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[03:05:06.963 --> 03:05:08.264]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[03:05:08.264 --> 03:05:12.545]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[03:05:12.545 --> 03:05:14.406]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[03:05:14.406 --> 03:05:20.709]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[03:05:21.849 --> 03:05:24.730]  Interfood is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[03:05:24.730 --> 03:05:26.451]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[03:05:26.451 --> 03:05:29.472]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[03:05:29.472 --> 03:05:31.173]  And their formula really works.
[03:05:31.173 --> 03:05:33.994]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[03:05:33.994 --> 03:05:35.475]  Try the NutriCafe.
[03:05:35.475 --> 03:05:40.257]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[03:05:40.257 --> 03:05:42.678]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[03:05:42.678 --> 03:05:45.139]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[03:05:45.139 --> 03:05:47.240]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[03:05:47.240 --> 03:05:49.521]  Go to www.interfood.com.
[03:05:50.162 --> 03:05:52.587]  We're good to go.
[03:06:01.223 --> 03:06:06.427]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:06:06.427 --> 03:06:10.470]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:06:10.470 --> 03:06:16.375]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:06:16.375 --> 03:06:21.438]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:06:21.438 --> 03:06:21.939]  Number three,
[03:06:22.339 --> 03:06:28.646]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:06:28.646 --> 03:06:31.549]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:06:31.549 --> 03:06:36.074]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:06:36.074 --> 03:06:39.678]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:06:39.918 --> 03:06:45.640]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[03:06:45.640 --> 03:06:50.342]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[03:08:11.247 --> 03:08:12.828]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.828 --> 03:08:14.369]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.369 --> 03:08:18.572]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.572 --> 03:08:22.615]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:26.571 --> 03:08:29.874]  Remember the flesh-eating robot stories?
[03:08:29.874 --> 03:08:32.256]  Those got pulled from all over the web.
[03:08:32.256 --> 03:08:34.098]  Fox News, AP, you name it.
[03:08:34.098 --> 03:08:35.278]  We had it printed off.
[03:08:35.278 --> 03:08:36.880]  We have the copy.
[03:08:36.880 --> 03:08:40.343]  And I want to go over a little bit of that coming up in a few minutes.
[03:08:40.343 --> 03:08:42.244]  Kind of the big picture of that.
[03:08:42.244 --> 03:08:44.006]  Because it did capture the public's attention.
[03:08:44.980 --> 03:08:50.601]  Jaren Alone heard two local news stations last week saying, we're searching it, we found the link, but it's dead.
[03:08:50.601 --> 03:08:51.482]  Why is it gone?
[03:08:51.482 --> 03:08:53.962]  We'll break that down coming up here in just a few minutes.
[03:08:53.962 --> 03:09:01.384]  But finishing up with Rockefeller, let's play the first part of that clip where we are changing, confronting him in one of the Senate office buildings.
[03:09:01.384 --> 03:09:02.705]  They say, we want to talk about Bilderberg.
[03:09:02.705 --> 03:09:04.205]  No, I'm not going to talk about that with you.
[03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.741]  See, for years they would say it just didn't exist.
[03:09:07.741 --> 03:09:09.701]  Now they can't say that.
[03:09:09.701 --> 03:09:15.363]  Now the minutes of Bilderberg have been stolen and leaked, where they set up the EU, they set up the North American Union.
[03:09:15.363 --> 03:09:16.943]  They're the ones financially raping us.
[03:09:16.943 --> 03:09:27.186]  They're the ones that have stolen 23.7 trillion in 10 months, double the GDP, roughly.
[03:09:27.186 --> 03:09:27.946]  This is incredible.
[03:09:29.747 --> 03:09:37.192]  The GDP's 13 trillion a year, so it'll be double the GDP at 26 trillion, but within two months it'll be well over 26 trillion.
[03:09:37.192 --> 03:09:43.836]  So, in one year, more than doubling the GDP, in stolen money, they hoard for themselves and don't loan out.
[03:09:43.836 --> 03:09:52.581]  And they're using the dollars when they have value buying real assets, later we get the dollars to pay them back with taxes, and when they're devalued.
[03:09:52.581 --> 03:09:54.422]  What a system.
[03:09:54.422 --> 03:09:57.604]  So here's We Are Change confronting Jay Rockefeller, then we'll play the second part of the clip.
[03:10:00.603 --> 03:10:10.272]  Senator Rockefeller, I'd like to know if you're aware that we, the American people, are aware of the agenda of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Bilderberg Group.
[03:10:10.272 --> 03:10:13.936]  And if you could comment on that please, because it's very concerning to a lot of us.
[03:10:13.936 --> 03:10:15.277]  You know, I have 37 people lined up.
[03:10:16.898 --> 03:10:18.519]  I'd like to know about the Bilderberg Group, sir.
[03:10:18.519 --> 03:10:21.041]  Well, that's not part of our discussion.
[03:10:44.969 --> 03:10:46.390]  When can we discuss that with you, sir?
[03:10:46.390 --> 03:10:46.630]  Okay.
[03:10:46.630 --> 03:10:47.570]  Thank you.
[03:10:47.570 --> 03:10:48.811]  Thank you.
[03:10:48.811 --> 03:10:50.312]  Okay, and this is for the Senator.
[03:10:50.312 --> 03:10:58.756]  This is the scientific proof of the nanothermite that's been found in some of these world trade center dust by scientists from around the world.
[03:10:58.756 --> 03:11:07.060]  Basically, conclusive proof that there's an Article 3, Section 3 treasonous cover-up going on about 9-11, sir, so... We'd love to get your opinion on that, too, sir.
[03:11:07.060 --> 03:11:07.941]  Wait, what did you say?
[03:11:07.941 --> 03:11:09.201]  Excuse me, folks.
[03:11:09.201 --> 03:11:09.741]  Thank you.
[03:11:09.741 --> 03:11:10.082]  Okay.
[03:11:10.082 --> 03:11:10.342]  Thank you.
[03:11:12.422 --> 03:11:14.303]  Skip to the next one.
[03:11:14.303 --> 03:11:18.385]  Later in the clip is the second part from another camera angle as Luke gets into eugenics.
[03:11:18.385 --> 03:11:26.970]  So here they are giving him peer-reviewed foreign and national studies about explosive thermite, thermate, in the towers.
[03:11:26.970 --> 03:11:28.671]  And that's not part of our discussion.
[03:11:28.671 --> 03:11:32.393]  Always compartmentalizing information.
[03:11:32.393 --> 03:11:34.074]  Because he can't talk about it.
[03:11:34.074 --> 03:11:34.654]  None of them can.
[03:11:34.654 --> 03:11:36.135]  They can't even say you're kooks anymore.
[03:11:36.135 --> 03:11:38.837]  Because they know folks will go read the studies.
[03:11:38.837 --> 03:11:41.278]  He can't deny and say Bilderberg doesn't exist anymore.
[03:11:42.264 --> 03:11:48.967]  That his uncle, David Rockefeller, was instrumental in founding with Prince Bernhardt and was at the first meeting.
[03:11:48.967 --> 03:11:50.968]  And he can't deny eugenics.
[03:11:50.968 --> 03:11:55.111]  They say your family set it up and was Hitler's inspiration.
[03:11:55.111 --> 03:11:59.933]  Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf thanking the groups he founded.
[03:11:59.933 --> 03:12:02.955]  His great-grandfather founded, his grandfather founded, his father founded.
[03:12:02.955 --> 03:12:05.436]  Meaning this family is behind it all.
[03:12:07.355 --> 03:12:11.776]  This is a very, the cancer research, the putting the cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[03:12:11.776 --> 03:12:13.116]  I mean, these are the guys.
[03:12:13.116 --> 03:12:15.897]  These are sick, sick, wicked, wicked people.
[03:12:15.897 --> 03:12:19.838]  You notice he looks at them like, oh my God, here are slaves that can see.
[03:12:19.838 --> 03:12:21.958]  And see more and more, they can't just brush us off as kooks.
[03:12:21.958 --> 03:12:23.598]  They know more and more of us.
[03:12:23.598 --> 03:12:29.719]  When he sees 30, 40 people there to confront him, he knows that represents thousands per person.
[03:12:29.719 --> 03:12:32.800]  They're realizing, oh my God, they're onto us.
[03:12:32.800 --> 03:12:36.701]  Now remember, and I meant to print this up this morning, but you can go look it up.
[03:12:37.535 --> 03:12:43.399]  Rockefeller funded massacres in New Jersey and Colorado and all over with Pinkerton security.
[03:12:43.399 --> 03:12:45.881]  Famous case where they killed a whole bunch of people in Colorado.
[03:12:45.881 --> 03:12:47.642]  They own the land, the gold mine.
[03:12:47.642 --> 03:12:50.884]  They sent in men on horseback, burnt down the whole camp.
[03:12:50.884 --> 03:12:53.606]  Rode down four-year-olds, you know, with horses.
[03:12:53.606 --> 03:12:55.047]  Shot them in the back.
[03:12:55.047 --> 03:12:57.109]  And that was in the last century.
[03:12:58.496 --> 03:13:00.077]  That was in the early 20th century.
[03:13:00.077 --> 03:13:10.105]  Famous cases of Rockefeller-funded strikebreakers, Gatling-gunning protesters, and then they got in trouble, so they went into this philanthropic mode.
[03:13:10.105 --> 03:13:15.129]  They set up NPR radio, PBS TV, everything.
[03:13:15.129 --> 03:13:16.110]  I mean, these are the guys.
[03:13:16.110 --> 03:13:17.351]  So let's cut back to this monster.
[03:13:19.886 --> 03:13:23.627]  I think it's time for me to really start moving quickly.
[03:13:23.627 --> 03:13:26.289]  You could just address some of these things if we're wrong, sir.
[03:13:26.289 --> 03:13:27.089]  Please just tell us.
[03:13:27.089 --> 03:13:27.449]  No, no.
[03:13:27.449 --> 03:13:29.530]  Go find somebody else to talk to.
[03:13:48.381 --> 03:13:58.789]  The truth is coming out and there's a lot of us that are aware of it.
[03:13:58.789 --> 03:14:02.031]  I'm sure you know some members, sir, if you're not a member yourself.
[03:14:02.031 --> 03:14:11.558]  President Obama's Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Blair, who I greatly respect, have labeled cyber security perpetrated through the internet
[03:14:12.609 --> 03:14:23.018]  As the number one national hazard of attack on the homeland in West Virginia.
[03:14:23.018 --> 03:14:26.561]  In West Virginia, America, anywhere else.
[03:14:26.561 --> 03:14:32.727]  So, I mean, it really, it really almost makes you ask the question, would it have been better if we never invented the internet?
[03:14:34.884 --> 03:14:37.506]  Well, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:14:37.506 --> 03:14:43.692]  That's Jay Rockefeller on the dais, on the bench, talking about better off not ever having the internet.
[03:14:43.692 --> 03:14:47.375]  He's trying to pass bills right now to restrict free speech in America.
[03:14:47.375 --> 03:14:50.818]  Now, I want to shift gears.
[03:14:50.818 --> 03:14:58.525]  We're now going to cover the story of the missing flesh-eating Pentagon robot story.
[03:14:59.710 --> 03:15:09.733]  This story from Fox News and similar headlines were all over other news publications on July 14th, 15th, and 16th.
[03:15:09.733 --> 03:15:19.716]  This printout is from July 15, 2009, upcoming military robot could feed on dead bodies.
[03:15:19.716 --> 03:15:24.558]  There it is for you on screen.
[03:15:25.734 --> 03:15:46.577]  Luckily, we have printed out several copies of this, but you cannot find this article and the few other news agencies that went with the same or similar headlines also have removed the headline and replaced it with things like this.
[03:15:49.821 --> 03:15:56.965]  A biomass-eating military robot is a vegetarian company says.
[03:15:56.965 --> 03:16:13.214]  So when you go to the link of where this story was, upcoming military robot could feed on dead bodies, you get the story that the flesh-eating robot is actually a vegetarian, say, inventors.
[03:16:13.214 --> 03:16:18.797]  Now, let's go ahead and read the Fox News story.
[03:16:19.656 --> 03:16:22.937]  The original one.
[03:16:22.937 --> 03:16:27.778]  Now, in media, they're supposed to correct the original story but never pull it.
[03:16:27.778 --> 03:16:40.000]  So this is a new memory hole system for Fox News to simply completely trash the old article and replace it with the one on your screen that's up there today.
[03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:42.601]  Upcoming military robot could feed on dead bodies.
[03:16:44.119 --> 03:16:50.826]  It could be a combination of 19th century mechanics, 21st century technology, and 20th century horror movie.
[03:16:50.826 --> 03:17:05.420]  A Maryland company under contract to the Pentagon is working on a steam-powered robot, see old technology is really good technology, that would fuel itself by grabbing up whatever organic material it can find, grass, wood, old furniture, even dead bodies.
[03:17:05.420 --> 03:17:06.802]  Robotic technologies, inks,
[03:17:08.587 --> 03:17:32.026]  Energetically Autonomous Tactical Robot, that's right, EATER is what it stands for, can find, ingest, and extract energy from biomass in the environment and other organically based energy sources, as well as use conventional and alternative fuels such as gasoline, heavy fuel, kerosene, diesel, propane, coal, cooking oil, and solar when suitable, reads the company's website.
[03:17:32.026 --> 03:17:36.930]  That biomass and other organically based energy sources wouldn't necessarily be limited to plant material.
[03:17:37.390 --> 03:17:43.113]  Animal and human corpses contain plenty of energy and they'd be plentiful in a war zone.
[03:17:43.113 --> 03:17:59.840]  Eater will be powered by the waste heat energy developed cyclone power technology out of Florida which uses an external combustion chamber burning up fuel to heat up water in closed-loop engineering electricity.
[03:17:59.840 --> 03:18:00.900]  Yeah, water power is great.
[03:18:00.900 --> 03:18:02.081]  That's what nuclear power plants do.
[03:18:02.081 --> 03:18:05.983]  They boil the water with the nuke rods and then power things.
[03:18:05.983 --> 03:18:06.423]  Great system.
[03:18:07.202 --> 03:18:17.428]  The advantages of the military are the robot could be extremely flexible in fuel sources and could roam on its own for months, even years, without having to be refueled or serviced.
[03:18:17.428 --> 03:18:18.828]  See, roam for months.
[03:18:18.828 --> 03:18:21.049]  Perfect.
[03:18:21.049 --> 03:18:24.831]  Upon the Eater platform, the Pentagon could build all sorts of things.
[03:18:24.831 --> 03:18:29.274]  A transport, an ambulance, a communications event center, even a mobile gunship.
[03:18:30.956 --> 03:18:42.278]  In press materials, robotic technology presents Eater as an essentially benign artificial creature that fills its belly with foraging despite the obvious military purpose.
[03:18:42.278 --> 03:18:51.360]  Okay, but the issue is, regardless of whether they're designed to eat human flesh or not on the battlefield, or animal flesh or whatever, they are out designed to kill.
[03:18:51.360 --> 03:18:53.861]  Let's show folks some of the images of the Eaters.
[03:18:55.560 --> 03:18:57.201]  Now these are the declassified robots.
[03:18:57.201 --> 03:19:00.344]  I've talked to Marine Corps armors and others in development.
[03:19:00.344 --> 03:19:03.366]  They say they can't get into it, but yes, it's much more advanced.
[03:19:03.366 --> 03:19:08.030]  Just like they had it for 25 years, the B-2 Bomber, and they rolled it out in 87.
[03:19:08.030 --> 03:19:10.933]  So they had it since the late 60s.
[03:19:13.308 --> 03:19:18.713]  And they already have had swords, in fact Google that, swords, used in Fallujah.
[03:19:18.713 --> 03:19:23.918]  With machine guns and grenade launchers and they admit they plan to use these against the citizenry.
[03:19:23.918 --> 03:19:26.360]  And that's why the globalists want these systems.
[03:19:26.360 --> 03:19:31.464]  Because they can have robotic aircraft, robotic drones, robotic predators, robotic reapers.
[03:19:32.345 --> 03:19:49.597]  AI systems, AI combat robots that will kill and can be delivered by robotic troop ships themselves, or robotically dropped with parachutes, and then the elite can launch whole military operations without having to have troops follow the orders.
[03:19:49.597 --> 03:19:55.661]  Like a General Fox Fallon says no to Bush on attacking Iran, they can launch drone attacks on Iran.
[03:19:55.661 --> 03:19:58.203]  Skynet is not something out of the movie Terminator.
[03:19:58.203 --> 03:20:00.424]  The Pentagon has called the system Skynet.
[03:20:00.424 --> 03:20:01.085]  You'll be right back.
[03:20:01.789 --> 03:20:12.361]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[03:20:12.361 --> 03:20:13.782]  Garden in a can!
[03:20:13.782 --> 03:20:17.927]  Garden in a can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[03:20:17.927 --> 03:20:19.949]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[03:20:19.949 --> 03:20:22.232]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[03:20:22.692 --> 03:20:31.706]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[03:20:32.364 --> 03:20:33.785]  Garden in a Can.
[03:20:33.785 --> 03:20:34.986]  It's that simple.
[03:20:34.986 --> 03:20:37.387]  Fresh, healthy, easy.
[03:20:37.387 --> 03:20:41.729]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[03:20:41.729 --> 03:20:43.310]  Ready when you are.
[03:20:43.310 --> 03:20:47.393]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden in a Can.
[03:20:47.393 --> 03:20:50.855]  For more details visit GardenInACan.com today.
[03:20:50.855 --> 03:20:53.396]  That's GardenInACan.com or call 866-598-7396.
[03:20:53.396 --> 03:20:53.436]  866-598-7396.
[03:21:01.377 --> 03:21:07.420]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:07.420 --> 03:21:13.304]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:13.304 --> 03:21:19.447]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:19.787 --> 03:21:21.748]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:21.748 --> 03:21:24.230]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:24.230 --> 03:21:37.419]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:21:37.419 --> 03:21:39.080]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.080 --> 03:21:40.942]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:21:40.942 --> 03:21:47.166]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:21:47.845 --> 03:21:56.111]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:56.111 --> 03:21:57.692]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:57.692 --> 03:22:01.455]  The people strike back.
[03:22:01.455 --> 03:22:05.178]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question.
[03:22:05.950 --> 03:22:09.651]  What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[03:22:09.651 --> 03:22:12.552]  The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count.
[03:22:12.552 --> 03:22:19.133]  Now take that blank page of yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets and escape the paper markets.
[03:22:19.133 --> 03:22:21.474]  The only real option is precious metals.
[03:22:21.474 --> 03:22:28.155]  For your retirement, your kid's education, or just plain survival when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down.
[03:22:28.155 --> 03:22:31.256]  You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package.
[03:22:31.256 --> 03:22:35.197]  And I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family.
[03:22:35.777 --> 03:22:40.201]  Please give me a call at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[03:22:40.201 --> 03:22:45.825]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[03:22:45.825 --> 03:22:49.729]  And together we can develop a make sense program before the clock runs out.
[03:22:49.729 --> 03:22:54.413]  Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[03:22:54.413 --> 03:22:57.115]  And take charge of your future and thank you.
[03:23:00.453 --> 03:23:07.838]  As you already know, drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:23:07.838 --> 03:23:12.521]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:23:12.521 --> 03:23:17.365]  Alkavision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[03:23:17.725 --> 03:23:25.451]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[03:23:25.451 --> 03:23:30.014]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[03:23:30.014 --> 03:23:35.918]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:23:36.218 --> 03:23:42.203]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[03:23:42.203 --> 03:23:47.767]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[03:23:47.767 --> 03:23:50.790]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.
[03:23:50.790 --> 03:23:51.611]  Or by calling 269-216-9767.
[03:23:51.611 --> 03:23:52.151]  That's 269-216-9767 today!
[03:23:52.151 --> 03:23:52.611]  Big John!
[03:23:52.611 --> 03:23:53.012]  Big John!
[03:24:12.696 --> 03:24:25.086]  I remember when I first got on the air 13, 14 years ago, people sending me documents and books and materials about Patton being murdered.
[03:24:25.086 --> 03:24:27.788]  And now they've got government documents, they've got proof.
[03:24:27.788 --> 03:24:34.333]  If you Google, General Patton murdered by CIA, you get the Sunday Express, you get the London Telegraph.
[03:24:35.421 --> 03:24:37.122]  You get mainstream news.
[03:24:37.122 --> 03:24:48.985]  And the guy that really ferreted out all these latest documents to prove this and why they did it joins us now, Robert Wilcox, author of Target Patent, The Plot to Assassinate General George Patton.
[03:24:48.985 --> 03:24:57.668]  Since he was on earlier in the year, I think it was January, it's now gotten a lot of attention and people say, well this happened 60 years ago, why does it matter?
[03:24:57.668 --> 03:25:04.790]  It shows you who runs our government, who runs our country, and for police and military out there to know that all of you are expendable too.
[03:25:05.796 --> 03:25:08.477]  And the people running our nation wrapped themselves in the flag.
[03:25:08.477 --> 03:25:11.199]  Patton didn't want to give Germany to the Soviets.
[03:25:11.199 --> 03:25:13.800]  He didn't like putting millions of Germans in camps.
[03:25:13.800 --> 03:25:15.661]  Or, more importantly, U.S.
[03:25:15.661 --> 03:25:16.761]  troops.
[03:25:16.761 --> 03:25:18.983]  This is on record.
[03:25:18.983 --> 03:25:23.024]  That were grabbed out of Germans' prisoner of war camps.
[03:25:23.024 --> 03:25:25.106]  And tens of thousands in the U.S.
[03:25:25.106 --> 03:25:27.927]  military just said, keep them!
[03:25:27.927 --> 03:25:29.608]  Yeah, Joe, they're a present to you.
[03:25:30.845 --> 03:25:32.825]  That's what they think of you.
[03:25:32.825 --> 03:25:44.288]  So, this is on record, and so to recap what happened to Patton, the documents, what's coming out, what the family's saying, and where this is going, is the author of Target, Patton, Robert Wilcox.
[03:25:44.288 --> 03:25:46.028]  Robert, good to have you on with us today.
[03:25:46.028 --> 03:25:48.408]  Hey, Alex, thanks for having me back.
[03:25:48.408 --> 03:25:48.668]  You bet.
[03:25:48.668 --> 03:25:56.210]  It's a quick segment now, a long segment coming up, but, I mean, tell folks in a nutshell about the book and the aftermath of these documents and materials coming out now.
[03:25:56.840 --> 03:26:05.928]  Well, Patton, I think I could go before a grand jury and get an indictment, but, you know, talk motive first.
[03:26:05.928 --> 03:26:07.630]  He wanted to fight the Russians.
[03:26:07.630 --> 03:26:12.554]  He was livid, like you said, about all the POWs that were left there.
[03:26:12.554 --> 03:26:19.541]  He just didn't think it was right that we should liberate from the Nazis and then give it to the Russians.
[03:26:19.541 --> 03:26:23.004]  And he also knew secrets that would have taken down some of the great
[03:26:23.604 --> 03:26:26.906]  But the globalists wanted the Cold War, continue.
[03:26:42.445 --> 03:26:44.746]  They didn't want him to go on.
[03:26:44.746 --> 03:26:48.307]  And you know, he was a guy like you'd never see today.
[03:26:48.307 --> 03:26:53.829]  You know, a guy who believed things and said them and stood on principle.
[03:26:53.829 --> 03:26:56.370]  And he wanted to go and fight the Russians.
[03:26:56.370 --> 03:27:03.752]  And they weren't going to let it happen because at that time the American government was big buddies with the Russians.
[03:27:03.752 --> 03:27:04.973]  And it's even worse than that.
[03:27:04.973 --> 03:27:08.234]  Uncle Joe Stalin, who killed 60 million of his own people.
[03:27:08.234 --> 03:27:08.974]  Uncle Joe!
[03:27:10.177 --> 03:27:13.780]  Uncle Joe, that's what FDR used to call him.
[03:27:13.780 --> 03:27:25.188]  And, you know, FDR was convinced that Stalin was a great man, that Russia was a great country, and that they were needed to keep the world a better place after the war.
[03:27:25.188 --> 03:27:34.114]  And so, that, in a nutshell, those two are the biggest reasons he wanted to fight the Russians, and he was going to tell secrets about people that would have stopped them.
[03:27:34.974 --> 03:27:43.159]  Wasn't the last straw from reading your book, and previously also looking into it, that he said, I'm going to talk about how our POWs are in the Russian hands, and they said, that's it.
[03:27:43.159 --> 03:27:43.939]  Killing.
[03:27:43.939 --> 03:27:46.381]  Well, I can't say that, Alex.
[03:27:46.381 --> 03:27:55.526]  I can't say... All I can tell you is that the wild Bill Donovan, and what the book does is I found eyewitnesses.
[03:27:55.526 --> 03:28:01.609]  The man who says that he staged the accident, that eventually ended in Patton's death.
[03:28:03.077 --> 03:28:12.063]  Douglas Posada was an assassin for the OSS, and he had a meeting with Wild Bill Donovan, who was the head of the OSS.
[03:28:12.063 --> 03:28:20.649]  And Wild Bill Donovan didn't report to anyone except for the President and possibly the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[03:28:20.649 --> 03:28:26.293]  And there were a series of meetings, and this thing started off with a stop patent, which is a matter of record.
[03:28:26.293 --> 03:28:30.716]  They stole his gas, preventing him from going into Germany and ending the war earlier.
[03:28:31.597 --> 03:28:37.603]  After the war, when they used him to win the war, then they had a meeting with Patton.
[03:28:37.603 --> 03:28:40.005]  Actually, only one man, Donovan did.
[03:28:40.769 --> 03:28:56.019]  And, uh, I've gotten Bazzata's diaries, as well as interviewing him before he died, and basically at that meeting they said, look, we have this great general, he's done great things for us, but now he's threatening to ruin everything, and you've got to stop him, Douglas.
[03:28:56.019 --> 03:28:57.980]  And Douglas said, what do you mean, sir?
[03:28:57.980 --> 03:28:59.722]  And he said, well, you do what you have to do.
[03:28:59.722 --> 03:29:01.903]  And Douglas said, you mean kill him?
[03:29:01.903 --> 03:29:03.264]  Yes, you do what you have to do.
[03:29:03.928 --> 03:29:17.237]  And this is after about eight meetings that progressed from stop Patton, which they did by taking his gas, and not allowing him to end the war when he really could have done so, and the Germans will tell you so.
[03:29:17.237 --> 03:29:24.322]  This was at the point where he roared through France, and he put the Germans in disarray.
[03:29:24.322 --> 03:29:27.964]  And at that point, they'll tell you, they could have been defeated.
[03:29:27.964 --> 03:29:32.087]  All their armies were streaming back into Germany, and he knew it, and he could have killed them.
[03:29:33.786 --> 03:29:37.027]  Yeah, he had their main force cut off on the Western Front.
[03:29:37.027 --> 03:29:38.687]  He'd done a flank on them.
[03:29:38.687 --> 03:29:39.587]  But God forbid that.
[03:29:39.587 --> 03:29:40.807]  You gotta give it to the Soviets.
[03:29:40.807 --> 03:29:42.588]  They've gotta set up East Germany.
[03:29:42.588 --> 03:29:43.168]  Absolutely.
[03:29:43.168 --> 03:29:47.629]  You know, the social control freaks, the bureaucrats, have to have control.
[03:29:47.629 --> 03:29:50.529]  So they give it to their bureaucratic buddy, Uncle Joe.
[03:29:50.529 --> 03:29:51.830]  Stay there.
[03:29:51.830 --> 03:29:53.230]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.230 --> 03:29:54.830]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.830 --> 03:29:58.431]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.172 --> 03:30:02.554]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:30:02.554 --> 03:30:04.556]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[03:30:04.556 --> 03:30:05.537]  Well, you should.
[03:30:05.537 --> 03:30:10.022]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.

[03:31:07.967 --> 03:31:10.928]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.

[03:31:13.989 --> 03:31:18.691]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:31:18.931 --> 03:31:20.053]  If you simply prepare.
[03:31:20.053 --> 03:31:23.297]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:31:23.297 --> 03:31:30.307]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.

[03:33:17.625 --> 03:33:22.369]  I want to ask him how he got involved in researching all this.
[03:33:22.369 --> 03:33:23.550]  People can say ancient history.
[03:33:23.550 --> 03:33:29.336]  This is so important to what then happened in our world and gives you a mindset into the establishment running things today.
[03:33:29.336 --> 03:33:35.501]  Because as ruthless as they were back then, they were choir boys compared to the folks running things today in the West.
[03:33:35.501 --> 03:33:37.883]  Before we go back to our guest, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors.
[03:33:38.604 --> 03:33:40.565]  That have made today's show possible.
[03:33:40.565 --> 03:33:44.028]  One of them is DigiNet Personal Audio Video Recorder.
[03:33:44.028 --> 03:33:47.290]  I want to tell you about our sponsor, DigiNet.net.
[03:33:47.290 --> 03:33:50.652]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T.net.
[03:33:50.652 --> 03:33:52.173]  DigiNet.net.

[03:33:55.315 --> 03:33:56.796]  And I mean the best prices.
[03:33:56.796 --> 03:33:59.238]  Everyone should have one of their DigiPens.
[03:33:59.238 --> 03:34:04.621]  This unit is a video and audio recording device disguised as a pen.
[03:34:04.621 --> 03:34:07.824]  As an unbiased witness, it can always be at your side, ready to help.
[03:34:08.849 --> 03:34:11.770]  And is admissible as evidence in court if necessary.
[03:34:11.770 --> 03:34:19.994]  With 2 and 4 gig models you can record 2 hours or more of continuous audio video and you will not believe the quality when you see it for the first time.

[03:34:30.200 --> 03:34:35.362]  With the date and time listed on the video, you will be able to use the pen as solid evidence in court.
[03:34:35.362 --> 03:34:40.284]  Go and see more of the other amazing surveillance equipment, like a little system they put in your car that's hidden cameras.
[03:34:40.284 --> 03:34:43.766]  Very inexpensive and goes on a little SD card.
[03:34:43.766 --> 03:34:46.947]  With prices and quality that can't be beat.
[03:34:46.947 --> 03:34:48.127]  Diginet.net.

[03:35:12.529 --> 03:35:13.910]  And it won't last forever, so listen up.

[03:35:22.920 --> 03:35:28.125]  Act fast and they will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:35:28.125 --> 03:35:30.468]  I believe now is the time for you and your family to be armed
[03:35:30.868 --> 03:35:34.769]  And trained to levels that exceed even law enforcement and military standards.
[03:35:34.769 --> 03:35:39.190]  FrontSight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[03:35:54.093 --> 03:35:57.577]  All right, going back to Robert Wilcox, author of Target Patent.
[03:35:57.577 --> 03:36:07.369]  Before we continue with the assassination, what it's been like now that your book's out, the diary's confirmed, the eyewitnesses, the documents, all of this.
[03:36:07.369 --> 03:36:12.375]  If you had any repercussions, have you talked to Patent's family, his heirs, his ancestors?
[03:36:14.719 --> 03:36:18.504]  No, they've been strangely silent.
[03:36:18.504 --> 03:36:24.052]  I tried early on in the beginning of writing this book to get in touch with them because I think they have
[03:36:25.651 --> 03:36:36.537]  Either information or archives that really could help a person like myself, who knows a lot more than anyone else about it, simply because I've been working on it for 10 years.
[03:36:36.537 --> 03:36:41.219]  But there's been no real discussion from them.
[03:36:41.219 --> 03:36:47.883]  There was something posted on Amazon that someone said, why do you bring this up?
[03:36:47.883 --> 03:36:50.744]  And it's the Kennedy Syndrome, you know?
[03:36:50.744 --> 03:36:51.885]  They don't want to hear about it.
[03:36:51.885 --> 03:36:53.586]  I think they think it besmirches their
[03:36:54.315 --> 03:37:23.289]  They're their hero's uh... uh... uh... you know reputation but uh... you know this has to be put out in the open because uh... he was a great patriot and and what happened to him was terrible and and and we need to get the finalization on it uh... there's still stuff to come out i have heard from people i always thought that uh... that i would uh... would open up a can of worms and they just come roaring in but i think we're too far away from it but i've heard from various people for instance
[03:37:23.880 --> 03:37:46.799]  The scene of the accident in which Patton was hurt at, and subsequently died from, all types of mysterious people were over, and one of them is identified, of all of them are identified in my book, who we know, who we could identify, but one in particular, a very mysterious figure, well someone called me and said, I knew that man, and I once talked to him about
[03:37:47.559 --> 03:37:51.820]  Somehow the patent death came out and he turned blue and ran away.
[03:37:51.820 --> 03:37:53.421]  Not ran away, but walked away.
[03:37:53.421 --> 03:37:55.642]  And we never heard from him again.
[03:37:55.642 --> 03:37:58.823]  He was a friend in this circle of friends.
[03:37:58.823 --> 03:38:04.804]  And that showed to me that, well, he must have had some guilt about the thing.
[03:38:04.804 --> 03:38:10.006]  Anyway, the reaction has just been a continual
[03:38:11.288 --> 03:38:13.250]  A lot of praise for the book.
[03:38:13.250 --> 03:38:14.971]  Believe me, I spent 10 years at it.
[03:38:14.971 --> 03:38:17.132]  I'm a professional writer.
[03:38:17.132 --> 03:38:18.393]  I just look for stories.
[03:38:18.393 --> 03:38:20.875]  I don't go after things just to go after things.
[03:38:20.875 --> 03:38:22.396]  I look for good stories.
[03:38:22.396 --> 03:38:30.402]  This one was brought to me by my cousin, who is an international private eye investigator, has a firm of his own.
[03:38:30.942 --> 03:38:41.806]  Who told me that he knew of Bazzata, this person who eventually confessed to me that he had actually set up the accident, the strange accident.
[03:38:41.806 --> 03:38:47.508]  And when I went to Bazzata, let me say that he never would have talked to me had he not had a stroke.
[03:38:48.249 --> 03:38:52.192]  Uh, this man lived his entire life as what he called a clandestine.
[03:38:52.192 --> 03:38:54.433]  This is a, you know, the very secret person.
[03:38:54.433 --> 03:38:57.355]  And during the war, he was an assassin.
[03:38:57.355 --> 03:39:02.899]  One of the first things I did after he told me his story had been at Jedburgh, which was, uh, really courageous.
[03:39:02.899 --> 03:39:04.841]  This was the beginning of our special forces.
[03:39:04.841 --> 03:39:08.083]  He had jumped behind enemy lines, behind the German lines.
[03:39:08.403 --> 03:39:15.051]  His job was to organize the Maquis against the Germans when they were fighting back at D-Day.
[03:39:15.051 --> 03:39:22.760]  He did all that tremendous story about him and I went to the National Archives and I dug up everything he told me and it was all true.
[03:39:22.760 --> 03:39:25.323]  This man was sterling as far as what he had told me.
[03:39:25.794 --> 03:39:38.197]  And then, as it went on, and when we continued to interview, he then told me about... At first, the story was that he knew about this, and that's what my cousin had told me.
[03:39:38.197 --> 03:39:44.939]  But it developed finally, and it was obvious as we talked more about it, that he had actually been the guy he was talking about, that he knew about.
[03:39:44.939 --> 03:39:50.480]  And so Douglas Posada, this OSS assassin, and the OSS is the forerunner of the CIA,
[03:39:51.590 --> 03:39:55.172]  Got the order from Wild Bill Donovan to do this.
[03:39:55.172 --> 03:40:08.058]  And the other part of that, the other strong part of that, was that there was an intelligence officer with the CIC, that was sort of the FBI of the Army, with Patton's forces.
[03:40:08.058 --> 03:40:13.081]  And after the war, he found out about the plot from the Russian side.
[03:40:13.081 --> 03:40:17.983]  And let me state right now that this was an OSS NKVD operation.
[03:40:18.644 --> 03:40:23.185]  Well, by the way, sir, separately talking to other historians and folks,
[03:40:36.621 --> 03:40:45.926]  I mean, deep with the Russians, even after the Cold War starts, giving them the nukes, giving them the factories, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Opel factories.
[03:40:45.926 --> 03:40:47.727]  I mean, the same crap.
[03:40:47.727 --> 03:40:48.087]  U.S.
[03:40:48.087 --> 03:40:52.049]  made goods going through Russia to North Vietnam during that war.
[03:40:52.049 --> 03:40:56.952]  This was two military industrial complexes propping each other up.
[03:40:56.952 --> 03:41:03.716]  I mean, that's a side issue, but it's just that in history, we just get continual validation from research like yours.
[03:41:03.936 --> 03:41:05.818]  No, you know, I don't think it is a side issue.
[03:41:05.818 --> 03:41:19.150]  I think it's right to the core of the thing, because one of the things that has come out is how deeply embedded the Russian Communists, Stalin's agents, were in our government at the time of the Second World War.
[03:41:19.150 --> 03:41:20.051]  Nobody knows this.
[03:41:20.051 --> 03:41:22.273]  It's only come out now because of Benona.
[03:41:22.273 --> 03:41:27.898]  Benona was our breaking of the Russian Code, and this has been kept top secret all the way to the end of the 90s.
[03:41:29.028 --> 03:41:36.636]  And what we did is we knew, you know, all this talk about McCarthy being, you know, a crazy man and he didn't know what he was talking about.
[03:41:36.636 --> 03:41:38.378]  Everything he said was true.
[03:41:38.378 --> 03:41:43.804]  Whatever he was, he was being fed some information from this Benona.
[03:41:43.804 --> 03:41:48.750]  The Russians had top-level agents all the way to the top of the government.
[03:41:50.030 --> 03:42:00.753]  Let's go over some of that because in the last four or five years I've seen New York Times, Washington Post headlines, even Russian headlines.
[03:42:00.753 --> 03:42:02.553]  McCarthy was right.
[03:42:02.553 --> 03:42:07.894]  Secret documents released show that it was giant but that it was a shared deal.
[03:42:07.894 --> 03:42:08.694]  There were U.S.
[03:42:08.694 --> 03:42:11.235]  agents there and at the level of the Fabian Socialist,
[03:42:11.815 --> 03:42:18.444]  Like Dr. Carol Quigley wrote at Georgetown in 69, Bill Clinton's mentor, the bankers just wanted somebody to consolidate.
[03:42:18.444 --> 03:42:21.828]  Fascist, communist, socialist, they don't care.
[03:42:21.828 --> 03:42:29.177]  So I would say it's all, you know, it's kind of like eugenics came from the US and England to Hitler, so it isn't that there were Nazis in America.
[03:42:30.038 --> 03:42:32.962]  The Nazis' daddy was in America and England.
[03:42:32.962 --> 03:42:39.270]  You know, it's not that the Soviets were infiltrating us, it was that the British intelligence was their daddy.
[03:42:39.270 --> 03:42:45.918]  You know, it's so sophisticated how they create the enemies and they create the conflicts, but go ahead.
[03:42:46.365 --> 03:42:49.346]  Well, you know much more about that than I do.
[03:42:49.346 --> 03:43:08.533]  All I know is the patent connection, and I do know that Patent was up against the government, the FDR administration, which was totally infiltrated by Russian agents who were bound and determined to get rid of Patent and to get rid of anybody who would stand up to the Russians.
[03:43:08.533 --> 03:43:13.015]  As far as it went further, I wasn't able to deal with that, but I mean, it was just rife.
[03:43:15.397 --> 03:43:20.521]  I think we were talking about Patton and exactly what had happened to him.
[03:43:20.521 --> 03:43:26.887]  Patton had been banished from his jobs in Europe after the war.
[03:43:26.887 --> 03:43:28.368]  They didn't need him anymore.
[03:43:28.368 --> 03:43:31.791]  He was going to go home and he was going to tell all these secrets.
[03:43:31.791 --> 03:43:34.894]  And he was going to fight to get us to fight Russia.
[03:43:35.706 --> 03:43:50.619]  And it was the last day before he was to go home, and he was driving down in his Cadillac touring car, a lonely road, and all of a sudden a truck comes up.
[03:43:50.619 --> 03:43:53.861]  They actually had stopped at a railroad track.
[03:43:53.861 --> 03:43:56.263]  And there are three people in Patton's car.
[03:43:56.263 --> 03:44:02.789]  There's Patton in the back seat, there's his general aide named Gay, General Gay, and a driver.
[03:44:03.402 --> 03:44:07.650]  And up ahead, as they're waiting for this train to go by, they're stopped at the track.
[03:44:07.650 --> 03:44:09.193]  They see a truck.
[03:44:09.193 --> 03:44:12.960]  It's an army truck, and it's way in front of them.
[03:44:13.339 --> 03:44:15.200]  But it stopped on the side of the road.
[03:44:15.200 --> 03:44:21.765]  Well, when the train goes by, they start up, and this truck starts up towards them.
[03:44:21.765 --> 03:44:23.786]  Very, very suspicious situation.
[03:44:23.786 --> 03:44:29.731]  And then it comes right almost abreast of them, and suddenly turns in front of Patton.
[03:44:29.731 --> 03:44:34.794]  And the driver can't do anything but try to turn his car, and they have a collision.
[03:44:34.794 --> 03:44:36.556]  It's not a big collision, but it's...
[03:44:37.456 --> 03:44:42.681]  Almost, you know, between 10 and 30 miles per hour.
[03:44:42.681 --> 03:44:56.052]  Patton has said, they say, to have flown, there was a large area in the back seat, he said to have flown forward, hit his head, broke his neck there, and then come back on top of General Gay.
[03:44:58.404 --> 03:45:05.687]  He told me that he was in a, they were looking at and commenting on all the clumps of war refuge.
[03:45:05.687 --> 03:45:23.354]  And right at that point where the accident happened, Pazano was behind there with another Russian agent, and he shot a specially designed weapon, didn't shoot bullets, it shot a bolt, which would look just like from an accident.
[03:45:23.354 --> 03:45:27.596]  And Patton was looking out the window, and the last thing he's supposed to have said
[03:45:28.131 --> 03:45:29.861]  According to Gay, it was.
[03:45:29.861 --> 03:45:31.349]  Look at that!
[03:45:31.349 --> 03:45:32.194]  And then BAM!
[03:45:32.757 --> 03:45:34.018]  Uh, this accident occurs.
[03:45:34.018 --> 03:45:35.619]  That was the moment that he could shoot.
[03:45:35.619 --> 03:45:38.121]  And, uh, Bazzato was a world-class shooter.
[03:45:38.121 --> 03:45:38.781]  I mean, a world-class.
[03:45:38.781 --> 03:45:40.262]  And it's a kinetic energy weapon.
[03:45:40.262 --> 03:45:42.023]  I mean, they know it's a heavy weapon.
[03:45:42.023 --> 03:45:43.184]  They know it's gonna bash.
[03:45:43.184 --> 03:45:44.465]  It's gonna hurt somebody.
[03:45:44.465 --> 03:45:45.786]  To make it look like they're hurt.
[03:45:45.786 --> 03:45:46.907]  It doesn't break the neck.
[03:45:46.907 --> 03:45:50.729]  It doesn't matter, because you get to kill them once they're in the ambulance or at the hospital.
[03:45:50.729 --> 03:45:52.090]  This is exactly right.
[03:45:52.090 --> 03:46:00.075]  You know, the CIA, if you read their manuals, the best way to kill someone and make it look like an accident is an accident.
[03:46:00.075 --> 03:46:02.477]  Because that's what everybody figures is gonna happen.
[03:46:02.917 --> 03:46:13.767]  Anyway, Patton ends up with a broken neck and a tremendous gash across his body, going from the bridge of his nose all the way to the top of his head.
[03:46:13.767 --> 03:46:18.111]  You could literally lift a flap of skin up and see the bone.
[03:46:18.111 --> 03:46:19.712]  And he's bleeding to death.
[03:46:19.712 --> 03:46:20.813]  He's paralyzed.
[03:46:22.137 --> 03:46:27.118]  I'm telling you, at least a hundred people came out of the woodwork.
[03:46:27.118 --> 03:46:29.999]  Generals, ambulances.
[03:46:29.999 --> 03:46:31.159]  It was just strange.
[03:46:31.159 --> 03:46:36.440]  This was a lonely road on a Sunday morning and they just came out of the woodwork.
[03:46:36.440 --> 03:46:43.601]  Anyway, Patton is not taken to a hospital there in the city where he is.
[03:46:43.601 --> 03:46:48.182]  He's taken down to Heidelberg, which is about 30 miles away.
[03:46:49.015 --> 03:46:52.097]  They figure he's going to die, but he's really, really strong.
[03:46:52.097 --> 03:46:57.799]  And he begins to rally, and he gets so... He's doing so well that they're going to fly him home.
[03:46:57.799 --> 03:46:58.820]  This is 1945.
[03:46:58.820 --> 03:47:00.240]  This is December 45.
[03:47:00.240 --> 03:47:04.943]  But it would have been a terrible trip for anybody who wasn't really strong.
[03:47:04.943 --> 03:47:07.724]  And just before he's about to go home,
[03:47:08.344 --> 03:47:24.134]  He has a sudden downturn, and if you read in Target Patent, there is later on a Russian who actually goes to one of the Patent grandchildren and says, we actually poisoned him.
[03:47:24.605 --> 03:47:25.885]  So they knocked him off.
[03:47:25.885 --> 03:47:27.406]  They poisoned him.
[03:47:27.406 --> 03:47:28.806]  That's the way you get them.
[03:47:28.806 --> 03:47:37.129]  If you can't get them in the actual accident, then they go to the hospital and then it's easy to get to them in various ways and kill him.
[03:47:37.129 --> 03:47:39.810]  There was no autopsy of Pat.
[03:47:39.810 --> 03:47:41.891]  That's another strange, strange thing.
[03:47:41.891 --> 03:47:43.932]  So we see this over and over again.
[03:47:43.932 --> 03:47:46.032]  Why do you think the family is silent?
[03:47:46.032 --> 03:47:47.413]  Because they're scared of the system?
[03:47:48.248 --> 03:47:50.691]  I just can't answer that question.
[03:47:50.691 --> 03:47:53.875]  I always go back to the Kennedys.
[03:47:53.875 --> 03:47:56.358]  Why are they silent and won't elect people?
[03:47:56.358 --> 03:48:03.607]  It's because I think either they know something they don't want to get out, or they feel it's besmirching their
[03:48:05.578 --> 03:48:07.139]  Well, I know most of them are scared.
[03:48:07.139 --> 03:48:10.421]  I know a lot of times women, when their husbands get murdered, come out and start saying something.
[03:48:10.421 --> 03:48:12.082]  The cops come and threaten them.
[03:48:12.082 --> 03:48:14.683]  And then say, look, your kids are going to be alright if you shut up.
[03:48:14.683 --> 03:48:19.406]  And I have, you know, Kennedy's secretary went public and said it was an inside job.
[03:48:19.406 --> 03:48:21.908]  And, of course, said that Jackie believed that.
[03:48:21.908 --> 03:48:25.250]  And I've talked to the eyewitnesses that talked to the secretary.
[03:48:25.250 --> 03:48:26.510]  So we know that goes on.
[03:48:26.510 --> 03:48:28.872]  We know that JFK Jr.
[03:48:28.872 --> 03:48:30.933]  was reopening an investigation when he died.
[03:48:33.325 --> 03:48:38.526]  They will not talk about it in the same way that the Patton family would not talk about it.
[03:48:38.526 --> 03:48:47.948]  But you'll also read in Target Patton that Mrs. Patton suspected something because she hired two private eyes to find out.
[03:48:47.948 --> 03:48:52.009]  She wasn't satisfied at the end of what had happened.
[03:48:52.009 --> 03:48:54.729]  Those private eyes, I don't know what happened to their report.
[03:48:54.729 --> 03:48:55.970]  And this brings up the other thing.
[03:48:55.970 --> 03:49:03.011]  After all of those people at that accident scene, the next thing I did is I went to the National Archives to find
[03:49:03.991 --> 03:49:20.843]  So then you have the evidence of the cover-up, a famous death happens, and there's no report of it, but there would have been a report for a regular private being killed.
[03:49:25.075 --> 03:49:36.682]  I know through other documents that I have found at the National Archives, where these are mentioned, that there were at least five reports or investigations.
[03:49:36.682 --> 03:49:49.269]  So the cover-up is evidence of the crime, one of the classic evidences, not to mention Kibono, who benefits, talking to the gentleman that shot him with the kinetic weapon, the Special Forces operative.
[03:49:49.269 --> 03:49:51.350]  Was he sad about doing this in hindsight?
[03:49:51.350 --> 03:49:52.471]  Is that why he was speaking up?
[03:49:52.471 --> 03:49:54.032]  I mean, murdering a great patriot?
[03:49:54.292 --> 03:49:57.675]  A tremendous guilt about his whole life.
[03:49:57.675 --> 03:50:02.920]  He not only killed Patton, he killed many, many, many people.
[03:50:02.920 --> 03:50:05.102]  Our own people, you know, the OSS.
[03:50:05.102 --> 03:50:08.265]  And this was the climate that it came from.
[03:50:08.265 --> 03:50:18.454]  In World War II, anybody who talked too much, if you were a clandestine, an operative, an OSS, if you're talking too much, they're going to get rid of you, and they did so.
[03:50:18.994 --> 03:50:22.995]  And we did it on many, many people in World War II.
[03:50:22.995 --> 03:50:24.455]  And he had killed many, many people.
[03:50:24.455 --> 03:50:28.456]  But he'd stayed on in Europe, and he'd become a freelance.
[03:50:28.456 --> 03:50:29.657]  And he had a group.
[03:50:29.657 --> 03:50:38.719]  And they would do things like rescue a colonel for the French from the Algerians.
[03:50:38.719 --> 03:50:39.879]  And he was guilt-ridden.
[03:50:39.879 --> 03:50:42.340]  And this is one of the reasons why he told me all this.
[03:50:42.340 --> 03:50:45.181]  Well, we're going to have to have you back up, Mr. Wilcox, just to get into
[03:50:46.229 --> 03:50:51.993]  That founding moment of OSS and the CIA, because it's all the same tricks today, the near future.
[03:50:51.993 --> 03:50:55.456]  But we'll talk some more about this in the final segment straight ahead.
[03:50:55.456 --> 03:50:57.357]  The book is Target Patent.
[03:50:57.357 --> 03:50:59.218]  Website's InfoWars.com.

[03:52:01.949 --> 03:52:07.755]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:07.755 --> 03:52:15.343]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[03:52:15.343 --> 03:52:21.509]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:21.929 --> 03:52:23.910]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:23.910 --> 03:52:26.412]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:26.412 --> 03:52:37.980]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:37.980 --> 03:52:39.661]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.661 --> 03:52:41.523]  It's about a one-world government.

[03:53:38.243 --> 03:53:41.026]  Preparing the whole family has never been so affordable.
[03:53:41.186 --> 03:53:41.787]  We're good to go.
[03:54:06.115 --> 03:54:10.439]  Yeah, I tried to plug them at the end of the last break, but we went to a break.
[03:54:10.439 --> 03:54:11.240]  Can't hold the break.
[03:54:11.240 --> 03:54:12.421]  Satellite's triggered.
[03:54:12.421 --> 03:54:15.523]  We've got three new ball caps to spread the word about freedom.
[03:54:15.523 --> 03:54:16.584]  We've got to get aggressive.
[03:54:16.584 --> 03:54:18.426]  We've got to get in people's faces.
[03:54:18.426 --> 03:54:22.229]  One is the Culpeper Minuteman flag with Don't Tread on Me with a snake.
[03:54:22.229 --> 03:54:23.190]  The other two are...
[03:54:24.071 --> 03:54:24.491]  Repeat of 1776.
[03:54:24.491 --> 03:54:27.533]  1836 just south of Austin.
[03:54:27.533 --> 03:54:28.514]  Gonzales, Texas.
[03:54:28.514 --> 03:54:31.335]  They came to confiscate the cannon.
[03:54:31.335 --> 03:54:32.296]  The Mexican troops did.
[03:54:32.296 --> 03:54:35.177]  And the town put up a flag with a picture of a cannon on it.
[03:54:35.177 --> 03:54:36.798]  This has a rifle on it.
[03:54:36.798 --> 03:54:38.379]  And said, come and take it.
[03:54:38.379 --> 03:54:39.840]  And that war started.
[03:54:39.840 --> 03:54:41.521]  So those three great hats.
[03:54:41.821 --> 03:54:50.365]  Just went up today at Infowars.com on the secure online video and bookstore slash Infowars gear area Infowars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 888-253-3139.
[03:54:57.148 --> 03:55:00.489]  And of course, we're also simulcasting live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:55:00.489 --> 03:55:04.511]  Going back to Robert Wilcox, robertwilcox.com is the website.
[03:55:04.511 --> 03:55:07.432]  You can buy the book anywhere on Amazon, bookstores.
[03:55:07.432 --> 03:55:12.853]  I was in the bookstore two weeks ago, saw it there, prominently displayed, selling quite nicely.
[03:55:12.853 --> 03:55:13.814]  Target, Patton.
[03:55:14.634 --> 03:55:16.656]  The plot to assassinate General George Patton.
[03:55:16.656 --> 03:55:23.121]  I want to have you back up again just on other conversations you had with this special forces hitman.
[03:55:23.121 --> 03:55:24.722]  But you're saying tremendous guilt.
[03:55:24.722 --> 03:55:32.949]  But I guess also, once they're doing these things, first they have you kill somebody who's bad, then somebody who's kind of bad, then you're killing heroes.
[03:55:32.949 --> 03:55:35.791]  You know if you don't do the killing, he'd have been dead, wouldn't he?
[03:55:35.791 --> 03:55:37.213]  Good point.
[03:55:37.213 --> 03:55:38.253]  Absolutely.
[03:55:38.253 --> 03:55:39.835]  And he said that to me many times.
[03:55:39.835 --> 03:55:42.337]  He knew that if he turned it down, he'd be killed.
[03:55:43.187 --> 03:55:48.714]  This was a really interesting guy.
[03:55:48.714 --> 03:55:54.781]  He'd had attempts to kill him several times after the war, I guess because he knew too much.
[03:55:54.781 --> 03:55:59.066]  But he would always say they weren't as good as me, and I was always able to take care of it.
[03:55:59.750 --> 03:56:16.699]  So, but, you know, I wanted to say one thing that I thought that I would be able to at least go see a little piece of the crime, the scene of the crime, so to speak, because it had always been advertised that Patton's car was at Fort Knox in Kentucky.
[03:56:17.439 --> 03:56:31.222]  And I had the head of the Cadillac division, it was a 38 Cadillac touring car, go down there with me, and what we found out was that the car was a fake.
[03:56:31.222 --> 03:56:39.004]  It had been rebuilt, and we know this because there's always a VIN number that's emblazoned into the metal somewhere.
[03:56:39.004 --> 03:56:43.385]  And we could see, and you'll see in the book, how it's been scraped off.
[03:56:44.025 --> 03:56:45.386]  It's the same thing with Kennedy.
[03:56:45.386 --> 03:56:50.448]  They rebuilt the whole car, let no one look at it, they just do the same stuff over and over again.
[03:56:50.448 --> 03:57:00.893]  Well, you know, in addition to all of the records being taken out, which is absolutely a cover up there, they got rid of the scene of the crime, so to speak.
[03:57:00.893 --> 03:57:05.175]  You can't find... While you were investigating this, did you ever get any threats or anything spooky?
[03:57:06.068 --> 03:57:28.781]  In the beginning, it was real spooky, but you know, I don't know whether I was seeing shadows or what, but because my cousin was helping me, and he deals with spooks and so on, and what we did was we took all my files and we spread them around so that if anything happened to me, nothing, you know, they would not be, he would have them and would know where to go to make them public.
[03:57:28.781 --> 03:57:32.943]  But since then, no, you know, I think I'm, they're just too old.
[03:57:32.943 --> 03:57:34.624]  I don't think that anybody's going to get me on this.
[03:57:35.723 --> 03:57:38.426]  You know, they just, um... It's just so disgusting.
[03:57:38.426 --> 03:57:49.479]  I mean, if you're gonna kill a decorated general because he wants our POWs not to be given to the Russians, you know, that they captured in German camps, I mean, how low does it go?
[03:57:49.479 --> 03:57:51.441]  And Donovan and all those guys were pure trash.
[03:57:52.102 --> 03:57:58.384]  That much is clear, and their great-great grandsons and grandsons and progeny are running things today.
[03:57:58.384 --> 03:58:02.726]  Hell, David Rockefeller was in there with them at the time all this was going on, and he's still alive.
[03:58:02.726 --> 03:58:04.086]  I mean, this is just trash.
[03:58:04.086 --> 03:58:07.287]  Cold-blooded, reptile-type trash.
[03:58:07.287 --> 03:58:08.188]  It is.
[03:58:08.188 --> 03:58:14.930]  And Mr. Wilcox, I want to have you back up in a few months just to get into all these other great stories and documents and more on Target Patent.
[03:58:14.930 --> 03:58:16.150]  Thank you so much for the time.
[03:58:16.150 --> 03:58:17.371]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[03:58:17.371 --> 03:58:17.991]  Great being with you.
[03:58:18.351 --> 03:58:20.832]  Great being with you, another patriot, exposing these people.
[03:58:20.832 --> 03:58:28.394]  Yeah, for any of you that are getting into government service, these CIA ads I hear on radio and see on TV, look out what you're getting involved in.
[03:58:28.394 --> 03:58:30.495]  You're getting involved in some very criminal stuff.
[03:58:30.495 --> 03:58:33.636]  If you're a good person, they're gonna kill you or you're gonna lose your soul.

[03:58:51.343 --> 03:58:56.646]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.

[03:59:03.470 --> 03:59:05.090]  You don't have to cooperate.
