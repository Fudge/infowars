[01:11.800 --> 01:19.000]  passed but there is some way to hamstring it so we'll go over the
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.880]  legislative parlay with Reverend Ted Pike coming up an hour and a half then
[01:23.880 --> 01:31.560]  Rand Paul with his Kentucky Senate bid will be joining us the son of Dr. Ron

[01:44.440 --> 01:50.640]  before it was really big mainstream news how Patton was murdered but now it's
[01:50.640 --> 01:55.600]  been in scores of mainstream newspapers going over the government documents how
[01:55.600 --> 02:00.440]  general Patton was murdered because he wouldn't hand Germany over to the Soviet
[02:00.440 --> 02:07.360]  so that is coming up in the last hour today I'm a level phone throughout the
[02:07.360 --> 02:11.040]  broadcast in fact I've been shaking things up a bit we've been taking a lot
[02:11.040 --> 02:15.520]  of calls early in the radio show because I've noticed that if I take some calls
[02:15.520 --> 02:19.440]  it takes us in different directions brings up different news items different
[02:19.440 --> 02:24.680]  issues that we had not previously been discussing or makes me think of stories
[02:24.680 --> 02:29.760]  that I meant to cover that I hadn't it literally is a grab bag or a wheel of
[02:29.760 --> 02:33.320]  fortune spin the wheel see what listeners have to say so we'll open the
[02:33.320 --> 02:39.760]  phones up right now but today at least in the first two hours for first-time

[03:13.240 --> 03:18.240]  with eugenicists calling for poisoning the food and water to sterilize the
[03:18.240 --> 03:22.600]  American people the carbon tax race through the house now racing to the
[03:22.600 --> 03:28.920]  Senate the twenty three point seven trillion I actually flipped around on
[03:28.920 --> 03:31.540]  the radio this morning I heard it being discussed on two different talk
[03:31.540 --> 03:36.040]  stations but they're acting like it's the Democrats doing it of course oh it's
[03:36.040 --> 03:42.160]  only the Democrats oh it's the liberals no it's the real government the off
[03:42.160 --> 03:49.480]  shore private federal reserve George Bush and Obama's handlers together

[11:52.440 --> 11:56.760]  Florida and I'm just kind of getting you guys some information about what I
[11:56.760 --> 12:02.880]  think is going on it seems like down here especially they're setting up the
[12:02.880 --> 12:09.120]  Marshall already I've seen an explosion of like cop cars just constantly I mean
[12:09.120 --> 12:14.120]  more than I've ever seen down here before and it just seems like they're
[12:14.120 --> 12:19.200]  targeting the young people mostly and because there's so many old people down
[12:19.200 --> 12:22.920]  here and it seems like if you if your out pass like eight or nine o'clock and
[12:22.920 --> 12:27.200]  you're young driving a car I mean that's just free game and they're just it's
[12:27.200 --> 12:31.680]  like it's pretty nuts down here man it's getting wild but I just want to
[12:31.680 --> 12:36.640]  appreciate everything you do man and I'm waking up people every day and I
[12:36.640 --> 12:41.640]  noticed a lot of people down here are using music and bands to get their
[12:41.640 --> 12:46.360]  message out about you know the New World Order and everything and a lot of kids
[12:46.360 --> 12:50.400]  are just you know getting their message out through the lyrics and music and
[12:50.400 --> 12:54.600]  and I just that's pretty much it man I just want to appreciate everything you
[12:54.600 --> 12:59.960]  do and you know how I'm helping waking up as many people as I can Austin you are
[12:59.960 --> 13:05.320]  awesome take care from Florida let me comment on both the issues you raised
[13:05.320 --> 13:14.240]  first off the globalist are masters of psychology they know how to make you want
[13:14.240 --> 13:21.840]  to live in tyranny they created a fiat cashless society they created a debt
[13:21.840 --> 13:27.840]  bubble a debt vortex a debt singularity a black hole that would destroy the
[13:27.840 --> 13:33.280]  economic society by design at the same time they hyped up gangster culture
[13:33.280 --> 13:37.280]  criminal culture they pumped in 30 million illegal aliens many of which
[13:37.280 --> 13:42.480]  are criminal many of the criminal element of Latin America and Asia and
[13:42.480 --> 13:49.880]  Europe have have raced to the United States and so crime is exploding right
[13:49.880 --> 13:56.520]  now and so police don't really talk about it but I had the Austin police chief
[13:56.520 --> 14:02.720]  in and he said he said have you noticed there's more police and I said no
[14:02.720 --> 14:06.880]  there's not really more police you up the Austin police three years ago before
[14:06.880 --> 14:11.200]  even got here you're just having them drive around with their sirens on you're
[14:11.200 --> 14:19.120]  having a drive-around in groups and he said ah you're an astute young man that's
[14:19.120 --> 14:25.840]  exactly what we're doing high visibility to create the perception so see to the
[14:25.840 --> 14:33.520]  police it all sounds reasonable oh we've got higher crime rates increasing so we
[14:33.520 --> 14:37.560]  got to set up checkpoints and the end justifies the memes we'll end up
[14:37.560 --> 14:41.560]  catching more criminals will end up catching more felons more drunks but
[14:41.560 --> 14:44.480]  everybody knows when they catch any legal alien the biggest culprits they
[14:44.480 --> 14:48.680]  are ordered to let them go or they get a slap on the wrist by the judge $50 fine
[14:48.680 --> 14:53.400]  on average and are released or they call ice ice won't pick them up or the New
[14:53.400 --> 14:57.960]  York Times reported earlier this year that Homeland Security takes them to
[14:57.960 --> 15:02.520]  government job centers and gives them jobs and green cards so they'll come
[15:02.520 --> 15:06.880]  pick the illegals up now but they'll take them to give them a job because they're
[15:06.880 --> 15:19.440]  there to drive down wages you understand they're a key economic military force and
[15:19.440 --> 15:26.880]  as society breaks down as crime rates explode as things unraveled you're going
[15:26.880 --> 15:31.080]  to have the police more and more under pressure the citizens calling for more
[15:31.080 --> 15:40.480]  and more and yes they are running checkpoints the army is showing up at
[15:40.480 --> 15:45.040]  checkpoints and as riots break out the next three four years as society
[15:45.040 --> 15:51.180]  degenerates the public will say thank god the army and Marines came out in
[15:51.180 --> 15:54.520]  restored order when they were burning this area of the city or looting that
[15:54.520 --> 15:59.240]  area of the city and then the precedent is set just like they set the precedent
[15:59.240 --> 16:04.360]  with National Guard and regular army in New York now they're in Dallas now they're
[16:04.360 --> 16:10.480]  in Phoenix now they're in Tennessee now they're all over California and Oregon
[16:10.480 --> 16:17.200]  the regular army regular Marines with sidearms searching citizens cars at
[16:17.200 --> 16:24.200]  checkpoints with big lights out in the middle of the night and the broad daylight
[16:24.200 --> 16:28.000]  and when local reporters pull up the video tape at troops walk up say turn
[16:28.000 --> 16:33.040]  your camera off so yes we are going into martial law and it's gonna be sold and
[16:33.040 --> 16:39.920]  it's gonna be billed as something good and in many cases it will be it's kind
[16:39.920 --> 16:43.840]  of like if you have bad arthritis the first time you're given corticotopic
[16:43.840 --> 16:52.480]  steroids like cortisone it it helps the first year or so but then a year or two
[16:52.480 --> 16:57.560]  later it kicks in and degenerates your joints 20 30 times faster to where you
[16:57.560 --> 17:07.280]  can't walk it makes your heart tissue disintegrate so see that's the parallel
[17:07.280 --> 17:13.160]  here oh yeah they the globalists have engineered a system where military will
[17:13.160 --> 17:17.440]  be needed on the streets more police violating the Bill of Rights in a state
[17:17.440 --> 17:21.560]  of emergency will be needed and then the precedent set they engineered the
[17:21.560 --> 17:26.040]  crisis to then offer the solution and the average cop doesn't know that they're
[17:26.040 --> 17:31.760]  not involved in social engineering master planning though all this is on
[17:31.760 --> 17:42.200]  paper in public and in the end it's going to destroy us are you going to be
[17:42.200 --> 17:46.600]  the one when inner city populations are burning down large areas of cities if it
[17:46.600 --> 17:49.720]  comes to that a lot of evidence shows it will are you gonna be the one out
[17:49.720 --> 17:53.640]  complaining as the fires get nearer your neighborhood and there's army out
[17:53.640 --> 18:04.840]  there shooting looters see people are saying all the military ain't gonna
[18:04.840 --> 18:11.680]  shoot at US citizens but see just like the feds made aid not be allowed to come
[18:11.680 --> 18:14.240]  into New Orleans just like the order people to the Superdome like they
[18:14.240 --> 18:17.000]  wouldn't let people get out on the major highways they could get out at four or
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.360]  five different places just like the National Guard would try to bring food
[18:21.360 --> 18:26.720]  and we're not to Walmart tried the fire departments from Houston tried the
[18:26.720 --> 18:34.120]  Houston Police Department only less than a hundred miles away tried the local
[18:34.120 --> 18:38.280]  police and County tried and the FEMA came in and with fire axes and hacked
[18:38.280 --> 18:45.760]  their communications as the hurricane was hitting that's on record so when
[18:45.760 --> 18:49.000]  everything broke down FEMA could say oh look we screwed up with even more
[18:49.000 --> 18:56.280]  funding and power for the martial law to come and oh they didn't send the
[18:56.280 --> 19:01.440]  military with aid they sent them into the high and dry areas to loot homes and
[19:01.440 --> 19:06.840]  take people's firearms and they'd catch people going across Lake Poncha train
[19:06.840 --> 19:11.760]  with their own firearms and granddaddy shotgun and the police the feds would
[19:11.760 --> 19:16.840]  board their boat and steal their family heirlooms and they never got them back
[19:16.840 --> 19:23.200]  it's social engineering ladies and gentlemen and you better get wise to it
[19:23.200 --> 19:26.280]  you better understand what's happening and how this is being done on the
[19:26.280 --> 19:30.040]  second point one of my greatest frustrations is I don't have time to
[19:30.040 --> 19:34.240]  go through all the Patriot music and patriotic anti-nuclear stuff out there
[19:34.240 --> 19:37.840]  I know a lot of folks send it to me a lot of people call me and I'm just so
[19:37.840 --> 19:42.840]  busy making films writing books doing the show that I can't reach out to all

[24:18.040 --> 24:23.560]  take a lot of calls but we're we're getting better at it Ryan in Wisconsin
[24:23.560 --> 24:28.160]  Ryan you're on the air go ahead hey Alex I wanted to say thanks for waking me up
[24:28.160 --> 24:33.040]  I had a question for you basically I want to get your opinion about something
[24:33.040 --> 24:39.400]  before I was hit to the whole biometrics thing I went to Disney World and I
[24:39.400 --> 24:43.120]  scanned my finger and I was just wondering what that means in your
[24:43.120 --> 24:48.800]  opinion as far as the mark of the beast. Well guaranteed because all these
[24:48.800 --> 24:52.160]  companies have been caught doing it Disney has sold that to Homeland Security
[24:52.160 --> 24:56.600]  they had big consortium meetings starting about 12 years ago we've seen the
[24:56.600 --> 25:02.280]  corporate minutes we've read them on air from big biometric global standardization
[25:02.280 --> 25:10.560]  consortiums they had a UN treaty in 2000 the US signed on to it at the meeting
[25:10.560 --> 25:16.640]  in Australia for a world standardization of biometric retina scan thumb
[25:16.640 --> 25:23.680]  prints fingerprints palm prints and global standardization of other biometric
[25:23.680 --> 25:31.000]  data RFID standardization so they have a global standardization and so you can
[25:31.000 --> 25:34.600]  read the corporate minutes of these RFID conferences and the Pentagon will be
[25:34.600 --> 25:41.120]  there that you can pull up USA today the exact headline was in 2002 going from
[25:41.120 --> 25:49.240]  memory something like try this right now let's see if I'm accurate guys let's
[25:49.240 --> 25:53.560]  see if I'm accurate right now this is from 2002 it was a USA Today headline
[25:53.560 --> 25:58.200]  then off that I went to the consortium website it was a Chicago biometric
[25:58.200 --> 26:02.280]  meeting in 2002 again there's scores of these but I'm just giving you one of
[26:02.280 --> 26:11.680]  them not my opinion I'll give you fact universal adoption of RFID by 2005 and
[26:11.680 --> 26:17.040]  then you read the article the Defense Department ordered industry and the and
[26:17.040 --> 26:21.040]  so that the so the Defense Department could order this to put in their quote
[26:21.040 --> 26:28.480]  control grid Walmart teamed up with them at the time had 34% of world retail
[26:28.480 --> 26:33.680]  they're now about 40% to force all retail manufacturers the manufacturers of
[26:33.680 --> 26:39.760]  retail items to adopt RFID in a global standardized system they called it
[26:39.760 --> 26:44.640]  godlike control that was then again in the news last week in a wired magazine
[26:44.640 --> 26:49.440]  story also there was a another story out of the register in England that print me
[26:49.440 --> 26:55.720]  that again two guys headline Rumsfeld says Pentagon to have godlike power to
[26:55.720 --> 27:00.200]  track everything and so what they want is a biometric face scanning thumb
[27:00.200 --> 27:05.920]  print scanning RFID smart dust system to track every slave on earth and this is
[27:05.920 --> 27:09.600]  the extermination grid this is the tracking grid once it's in place they
[27:09.600 --> 27:16.280]  can really then beta test the mass bio weapon releases and not just cull you
[27:16.280 --> 27:20.120]  know 30 40% of Africa because there they've kind of got a news blackout they
[27:20.120 --> 27:26.200]  can carry it out they want to really start doing some heavy killing here go
[27:26.200 --> 27:33.000]  ahead so what I mean is there anything that I can do as far as I'm not a
[27:33.000 --> 27:37.200]  totally religious person but I somewhat believe in the mark of the beast and all
[27:37.200 --> 27:42.200]  that stuff is there anything I can do as far as writing this I mean I mean I made
[27:42.200 --> 27:47.240]  a mistake and did something that now knowing what I know now I wouldn't have
[27:47.240 --> 27:58.240]  done I mean is there anything I can do well the problem is the 501 C3 churches
[27:58.240 --> 28:01.960]  whenever had that till the 50s the feds told the churches they had to waive all
[28:01.960 --> 28:05.960]  their rights the churches believe the mind trick and did it it's all fraudulent
[28:05.960 --> 28:09.640]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or pre
[28:09.640 --> 28:13.600]  emitting the free exercise thereof first amendment begins with those words and
[28:13.600 --> 28:19.480]  the world council of churches set up by the Rockefellers a hundred years ago
[28:19.480 --> 28:27.200]  they they have bought off all the major denominations Catholic Protestant you
[28:27.200 --> 28:32.560]  name it and so they're telling everybody rejoice give into this you're
[28:32.560 --> 28:36.000]  going to be teleported out of here boy are Christians going to be upset when
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.800]  they're not teleported out that's why they're going to accept it that's the
[28:38.800 --> 28:42.240]  great delusion but that's what the Bible says that the antichrist will say
[28:42.240 --> 28:45.880]  he's Christ and most Christians will fall down and worship him the elect will
[28:45.880 --> 28:50.960]  be deceived he will say he's Jesus and they will believe it but you know I don't
[28:50.960 --> 28:56.120]  even go there I just even if you're from a secular perspective it is being
[28:56.120 --> 28:59.840]  tracked and traced and controlled imagine what Hitler would have done with
[28:59.840 --> 29:05.000]  these powers is this a good idea societally historically and the answer
[29:05.000 --> 29:13.640]  is absolutely not does that answer your question sir yes it does I appreciate it
[29:13.640 --> 29:18.360]  yeah the biggest thing you can do is go to local churches not even once your
[29:18.360 --> 29:23.320]  members that and just start handing out documents at the church's 501c3 and ask
[29:23.320 --> 29:27.880]  the pastor if they're under FEMA control and a secret agreement and really just
[29:27.880 --> 29:32.840]  breaking the whole covert operations umbrella that's over us you break it by
[29:32.840 --> 29:36.920]  showing people I mean imagine what the church is going to think when they find
[29:36.920 --> 29:42.120]  out that their pastor is a spook is a spy is a government operative I mean you
[29:42.120 --> 29:47.240]  know we're all living in a James Bond movie folks the globalists have taken
[29:47.240 --> 29:54.200]  their time setting this thing up we're on the march the empires on the run

[35:50.720 --> 35:54.880]  the fines and fees under the guise of neighborhood watch initiative since
[35:54.880 --> 35:57.680]  according to law enforcement homeland security guidelines suspicious behavior
[35:57.680 --> 36:01.000]  includes owning guns being politically active and having bumper stickers on
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.800]  your car the cable guys next visit to your house may turn out to have more
[36:04.800 --> 36:10.160]  interesting consequences than you originally anticipated and now that we
[36:10.160 --> 36:14.400]  know about this I mean that's why the exterminator or the lawn person they'll
[36:14.400 --> 36:18.440]  start asking questions and you'll see them when you're in your house looking on
[36:18.440 --> 36:23.240]  your tables looking around first because they're a lot of these people make more
[36:23.240 --> 36:29.800]  money off of payments they get for turning people in and they do off their
[36:29.800 --> 36:36.320]  job like I remember seeing 60 minute story had to be 15 years ago sitting
[36:36.320 --> 36:39.160]  there on a Sunday evening watching 60 minutes I'd go over my grandparents
[36:39.160 --> 36:44.680]  sometimes and have Sunday dinner with them and I'd go in and watch 60 minutes
[36:44.680 --> 36:51.880]  with my grandfather he liked 60 minutes I remember a show on there about
[36:51.880 --> 36:59.720]  airline ticket counter people making more money off tips than they made off their
[36:59.720 --> 37:08.280]  regular job and it's about one lady making over a hundred thousand a year was
[37:08.280 --> 37:15.280]  a famous case of a guy flies every year from South Carolina to Houston and he
[37:15.280 --> 37:18.600]  would pay in cash because then he got a discount but he had receipts and
[37:18.600 --> 37:26.640]  everything to buy part of that year's crepe myrtles and other trees and then
[37:26.640 --> 37:35.280]  they would be shipped by 18 Wheeler to South Carolina and he pulled out a
[37:35.280 --> 37:39.000]  lot of cash to pay they took his money and it was asset for which the seizure
[37:39.000 --> 37:43.480]  and that was the end of it so this is the new America I mean you know I
[37:43.480 --> 37:47.640]  mentioned this headline a lot because people don't seem to believe it what was
[37:47.640 --> 37:53.800]  the exact headline it was scoff laws get caught when ordering pizzas USA today
[37:53.800 --> 38:01.320]  and that was 2002 and it's of what we already knew we've already been told
[38:01.320 --> 38:07.440]  this by pizza company higher-level executives mid-level executives at the
[38:07.440 --> 38:11.600]  three big pizza companies wouldn't say who but the big three they basically all
[38:11.600 --> 38:16.480]  do it now the big ones and talk about how they get 25 to 35 percent of the
[38:16.480 --> 38:21.640]  fines when you call to order a pizza you tend to give your real name real credit
[38:21.640 --> 38:27.320]  card real address well guilty until proven innocent it has then run through a
[38:27.320 --> 38:33.040]  private subsidiary company tied in with Rumsfeld holdings in Dallas this is just
[38:33.040 --> 38:38.320]  one hub there's other services and then that is instantly uploaded to law
[38:38.320 --> 38:44.200]  enforcement and instead of getting a pizza you get a SWAT team visit and it
[38:44.200 --> 38:52.360]  said it's even for warrants for parking tickets even for warrants for speeding
[38:52.360 --> 38:55.600]  tickets the most basic stuff and a lot of times they go ahead and deliver the
[38:55.600 --> 38:59.480]  pizza but then a day later the police come or if you got a felony more come
[38:59.480 --> 39:08.440]  see this is a Pentagon designed grid and they're gonna stage chem and bio attacks
[39:08.440 --> 39:10.800]  they're gonna blame it on terrorists they're gonna use that to hurt us into
[39:10.800 --> 39:13.800]  the cities in the next decade and then they're gonna release stuff that wipes
[39:13.800 --> 39:18.520]  out almost everybody so I want the cops who are laughing in the military when
[39:18.520 --> 39:23.040]  you're there with your family dying later at least then some of you may be
[39:23.040 --> 39:28.080]  able to survive and remember who did it and when the Rockefellers and Rothschilds
[39:28.080 --> 39:33.120]  and others emerge from their bunkers you'll there'll be no rationals no
[39:33.120 --> 39:37.720]  excuses you know who did it you know who the enemy is just in case we lose this
[39:37.720 --> 39:43.840]  round and it really gets bad I want to implant now in the history in the memory
[39:43.840 --> 39:48.960]  who did it because I know a lot of you aren't gonna listen now down the road I
[39:48.960 --> 39:53.760]  want you to pay attention I know you're laughing it's funny now I understand it
[39:53.760 --> 40:00.400]  is to you you're not gonna read the White House science are openly saying all
[40:00.400 --> 40:04.040]  this you're gonna suck your thumb you're gonna stick it in your mouth and feel
[40:04.040 --> 40:12.200]  good don't watch some sports tonight and act tough to the neighbor I understand
[40:12.200 --> 40:14.520]  you're gonna strut around in front of your wife and act tough at the grocery
[40:14.520 --> 40:19.240]  store and presser I understand that if you were a real man you'd face history
[40:19.240 --> 40:23.080]  and face the scientific dictatorship we're under and wake up to that we're
[40:23.080 --> 40:28.600]  all in the same boat but I know there's a good chance you're not so at least
[40:28.600 --> 40:34.240]  before you die as you're going oh my god Alex Jones was right you might get
[40:34.240 --> 40:41.240]  your soul and heart right with God or some of you are gonna live some of you
[40:41.240 --> 40:45.220]  will have natural immunity and when you're dealing with the hunter killers the
[40:45.220 --> 40:51.880]  flesh-eating robots they're gonna send after you into the rebels enclaves just
[40:51.880 --> 40:56.760]  remember we could have stopped it all early on and see I know this sounds
[40:56.760 --> 41:00.360]  insane but where do you think they get ideas for movies like The Matrix and
[41:00.360 --> 41:04.640]  movies like Terminator it's all from Pentagon documents and we we list those
[41:04.640 --> 41:09.440]  it's in my book to sent into tyranny the Swords are 30 years old already
[41:09.440 --> 41:14.360]  killing people in Afghanistan and Iraq they're now about to roll out flesh
[41:14.360 --> 41:18.080]  eating robots according to Associated Press fact they don't believe that print
[41:18.080 --> 41:22.840]  me the flesh-eating robot again just just just Google flesh-eating robots to be
[41:22.840 --> 41:29.240]  deployed because see that's how they're gonna feed themselves hunter killers is
[41:29.240 --> 41:35.440]  what they're called and they've even got them coming out that where camouflage
[41:35.440 --> 41:41.120]  uniforms and have rubber skin oh like the early Terminators oh I'm sorry it was
[41:41.120 --> 41:47.080]  all Pentagon plan but see you won't wake up to it cuz you watched a movie you
[41:47.080 --> 41:51.280]  don't understand it's predicted programming you understand the Terminators
[41:51.280 --> 41:58.960]  work for the bankers the Terminators yes they're real
[41:58.960 --> 42:09.920]  flesh-eating Terminators yeah you guys found it with your search and then all
[42:09.920 --> 42:12.960]  you do is click on that article and that'll take you to the that's just a
[42:12.960 --> 42:18.120]  blog reporting on the article then that article will lead you to the article
[42:18.120 --> 42:29.120]  flesh-eating robots feed on dead bodies and that pulled up the Fox news
[42:29.120 --> 42:37.000]  headline biomass eating robots is a vegetarian company says that's a new
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.840]  article about it
[42:39.840 --> 42:49.640]  oh the flesh-eatings they did that's the original article of the same same
[42:49.640 --> 42:57.400]  same photo of the control drone running the flesh-eaters on the ground wow well
[42:57.400 --> 43:02.440]  I gave that to Jacobson he better have screenshot that for the film oh we have
[43:02.440 --> 43:09.240]  copies around here it's in the stack wow they took it down amazing that they
[43:09.240 --> 43:13.200]  had company quotes about how it eats human eats humans oh I guess that was a
[43:13.200 --> 43:20.040]  little much for the slaves to hear the whole Pentagon's converting over to drone
[43:20.040 --> 43:26.080]  and remote control and AI aircraft helicopters and soldiers humans will
[43:26.080 --> 43:32.120]  just maintenance the maintenance robots that work in the robot factories and
[43:32.120 --> 43:36.520]  then the next phase there won't even be humans needed for that it'll be robots
[43:36.520 --> 43:42.040]  working on robots that work on robots with some specialized technicians but
[43:42.040 --> 43:46.880]  they'll all be eugenicists who believe in the holy work now you think I'm
[43:46.880 --> 43:52.160]  joking it okay well just did that's fine that's fine let's go ahead and talk
[43:52.160 --> 43:57.960]  to Ronald in DC Ronald you're on the air hey Alex how's it going it's a honor to
[43:57.960 --> 44:03.080]  be on your show right now honored to have you with us yeah but basically I
[44:03.080 --> 44:08.640]  wanted to talk to you about the police state that you were talking about in
[44:08.640 --> 44:14.120]  your films and I recently just moved to Washington DC and my friend that was
[44:14.120 --> 44:19.240]  in the city North Carolina recently told me that they installed these
[44:19.240 --> 44:25.560]  cameras on top of the telephone poles to monitor people on the street and what
[44:25.560 --> 44:29.280]  had happened was that's part of the kill grid I want to again first they said it
[44:29.280 --> 44:33.480]  was for traffic and I did have dual use for that now they go oh the cameras are
[44:33.480 --> 44:37.280]  for you and their face scanning you and reading your license plate oh it's
[44:37.280 --> 44:42.560]  Pentagon designed go ahead yeah and what had happened is the reason why he I think
[44:42.560 --> 44:46.720]  he found out about this was this guy broke into somebody's car or something
[44:46.720 --> 44:51.280]  like that and then the next day the cops just ran up to his house and pulled him
[44:51.280 --> 44:55.760]  out of his house and we were like yeah we got you on camera breaking this guy's
[44:55.760 --> 44:59.600]  car and the guy's like I didn't know you guys had cameras and yeah and of course it
[44:59.600 --> 45:05.200]  has a of course it has a use and then they're going to statistically only bust
[45:05.200 --> 45:09.160]  a certain amount to fill their presence and they're artificially turning the
[45:09.160 --> 45:14.200]  economy off for people won't be able to live without stealing and then you get
[45:14.200 --> 45:18.720]  half the public in prison and half the public running the grid and you know
[45:18.720 --> 45:22.520]  people spying on the watchers and they'll burn lots of watchers and lots of
[45:22.520 --> 45:26.960]  cops on TV to make everybody get into accepting it it'll all be run by the
[45:26.960 --> 45:31.880]  psych warfare chiefs and the thing about it is like it was the city is a really
[45:31.880 --> 45:34.960]  rural town it was like probably the last place I would thought there would be like
[45:34.960 --> 45:38.680]  a police state control grid there you know because it's probably population
[45:38.680 --> 45:46.920]  like 50,000 people so the wish I found really ironic I know my friend it's bad
[45:46.920 --> 45:51.120]  news I appreciate your call now the most rural areas you'll be on the middle of
[45:51.120 --> 45:56.040]  nowhere to four-way stop a town that's maybe got six seven houses in it there'll
[45:56.040 --> 46:04.440]  be four-way stop cameras high-power digital face scan biometric walk scan
[46:04.440 --> 46:09.920]  license plate scan all Pentagon run Pentagon openly brags about it godlike
[46:09.920 --> 46:16.600]  control because their control freaks and the Pentagon boys line up and take
[46:16.600 --> 46:20.240]  their shots and they die of their cancer like they're supposed to and they drink
[46:20.240 --> 46:26.760]  their fluoride water and say yes sir so to the police because it's all part of
[46:26.760 --> 46:30.480]  being part of the part of the power structure all part of laughing at Alex
[46:30.480 --> 46:38.440]  Jones it's so funny but it is 2009 boys and you're not in Kansas anymore let's
[46:38.440 --> 46:42.520]  go ahead and take another call here let's talk to Joe in Texas Joe you're on
[46:42.520 --> 46:50.000]  the air doing all right listen a couple of things I wanted to mention first of
[46:50.000 --> 46:55.240]  all I think intelligence and information is very important I know you
[46:55.240 --> 47:02.920]  touch touch based on it the other day and anybody out there that has access to
[47:02.920 --> 47:08.440]  certain information that the public should know should get it out and one
[47:08.440 --> 47:15.400]  thing I wanted to tell you that I saw a few years ago is a guy that I worked
[47:15.400 --> 47:22.480]  with was had a he was an assistant to a high military officer and during desert
[47:22.480 --> 47:27.160]  storm one he showed he goes I'm gonna show you a picture I'm gonna show you
[47:27.160 --> 47:32.360]  something that no one knows about and he showed us a picture of a private
[47:32.360 --> 47:37.560]  meeting that he went to with sports cough and his cabinet members and Saddam
[47:37.560 --> 47:41.760]  Hussain and his cabinet members all meeting together another guy was sitting
[47:41.760 --> 47:44.800]  there looking at that he goes oh you should turn that into five magazine
[47:44.800 --> 47:49.480]  the guy was like no way I he goes I don't want to get killed you know and you
[47:49.480 --> 47:54.200]  know I tell people all the time people say to me they say look you shouldn't be
[47:54.200 --> 47:58.160]  talking about all this stuff you know about 9-11 and such and such I'm gonna
[47:58.160 --> 48:02.720]  say look I'd rather die a free man give me information out that I think it's
[48:02.720 --> 48:06.760]  true than to sit and cower down and do nothing because that's what they did in
[48:06.760 --> 48:10.800]  Nazi Germany and the other thing I wanted to mention Alex is I grew up in
[48:10.800 --> 48:17.920]  church and a while back Steven Anderson pastor Steven Anderson was on a bright
[48:17.920 --> 48:22.320]  show and I was the last caller to call in yeah we've had Anderson on here he's
[48:22.320 --> 48:27.520]  the guy that got beat up by the hundred mile deep checkpoint yes sir and I
[48:27.520 --> 48:31.520]  remember that I had started listening to him a few a month or so before that
[48:31.520 --> 48:35.880]  happened and I was very surprised when I heard about it and so anyway I was the
[48:35.880 --> 48:39.960]  last caller to call in and I and I said to Steve because Steve's a post
[48:39.960 --> 48:43.400]  tribulation it's and I told Steve I said Steve you know the problem with the
[48:43.400 --> 48:47.200]  church today is so many people in the church are so wrapped up in the pre-trib
[48:47.200 --> 48:50.440]  stuff that they don't believe they're even gonna be here when that's why the
[48:50.440 --> 48:55.200]  media gave it all attention and sold a hundred million books for Tamela Hay and
[48:55.200 --> 48:58.360]  all those guys just because that was never taught till a hundred years ago
[48:58.360 --> 49:02.760]  it's totally made up and I talked to these little church ladies you know
[49:02.760 --> 49:06.320]  they're herald on them they go praise God it's the end I'll be
[49:06.320 --> 49:12.840]  teleported out soon no you're not lady and so it's just the ultimate delusion
[49:12.840 --> 49:17.240]  and so they're standing down because their churches are openly run by the
[49:17.240 --> 49:22.040]  federal government yes sir and see the thing is so and him and Katherine
[49:22.040 --> 49:25.360]  Albright got to talking about he is on brought that up and she wanted to talk
[49:25.360 --> 49:28.640]  to him more about it after the program she's on the same sheet of music
[49:28.640 --> 49:32.840]  apparently but the other thing I was going to ask is if you ever thought about
[49:32.840 --> 49:38.640]  doing a video on how some of these big church leaders like Rick Warren Joel
[49:38.640 --> 49:43.120]  Osteen even John Hagi have people like McCain Obama and all these people in
[49:43.120 --> 49:48.040]  their churches I get so sick of hearing this conservative Christian crap that
[49:48.040 --> 49:52.960]  it's like you know what guys these guys are part of it too you know it's I
[49:52.960 --> 49:57.240]  hear you I appreciate your call what did Pat Robertson say when Obama was
[49:57.240 --> 50:02.800]  elected he said it's of the Lord socialism is good America will accept it
[50:02.800 --> 50:09.240]  and and and that he thinks Obama's good and he said it's for ordained it is of
[50:09.240 --> 50:14.160]  God stand down he might as well been in a Borg outfit saying resistance is
[50:14.160 --> 50:18.480]  futile and that's what all the big Christian leaders said they said do what
[50:18.480 --> 50:26.840]  the president says it is ordained it is of the Lord stand down GI lay down GI do
[50:26.840 --> 50:34.840]  what we say they're openly on government payroll because they never get
[50:34.840 --> 50:38.240]  audited they never get messed with and then the preachers can dress like little
[50:38.240 --> 50:42.800]  pimps in their little suits and have their little info babe wives and little
[50:42.800 --> 50:49.720]  pinky rings and they are bought and paid for intellectual spiritual prostitutes
[50:49.720 --> 50:56.360]  they are demons of the pit of Hades and they sit there lying to their flock
[50:56.360 --> 51:01.200]  that's their job they work for Old Scratch
[51:01.760 --> 51:06.200]  recognize that sound if you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form

[54:00.880 --> 54:11.240]  people always ask why I print every story because they pull stories and Fox
[54:11.240 --> 54:16.320]  News AP and others pulled the flesh-eating robot story with the Pentagon
[54:16.320 --> 54:21.560]  developing robots that feed themselves off enemies which of course is a
[54:21.560 --> 54:28.080]  violation of the rule of law and the rules of war the Geneva Convention but
[54:28.080 --> 54:30.520]  if you're going to torture people and torture their kids in front of them
[54:30.520 --> 54:35.520]  to get answers as the Pentagon admits why not have the robots feed on dead
[54:35.520 --> 54:39.760]  bodies I mean that's they all see us as human resources anyways that's the big
[54:39.760 --> 54:43.960]  bioethicist eugenics terms see everything's eugenics the terms they use
[54:43.960 --> 54:49.440]  in business everything well guess what we printed two copies of it we happened
[54:49.440 --> 54:53.280]  to have it we're gonna have to scan that up on the web and point out that it was
[54:53.280 --> 54:57.960]  censored for some reason because it did have the company bragging that it could
[54:57.960 --> 55:05.720]  eat dead bodies and then magically they took it down but we printed it so I'll
[55:05.720 --> 55:13.280]  have to when we go live at prisonplanet.tv coming up in about 35
[55:13.280 --> 55:16.480]  minutes we'll go live when we have Ted Picon with us I'm gonna go over that then

[55:21.680 --> 55:29.680]  right now in fact who is first here Daniel in California you're on the air
[55:29.680 --> 55:38.240]  Daniel welcome hey Alex I wanted to send some great kudos to Jason Bermas and to
[55:38.240 --> 55:43.000]  you specifically just woke me up completely about two years ago when I
[55:43.000 --> 55:49.080]  saw loose change and I ended up watching just about every other program that you
[55:49.080 --> 55:53.560]  guys have put together so keep that up and and I've been sharing this
[55:53.560 --> 55:59.600]  information for at least two years now and I'm part of a few organizations now
[55:59.600 --> 56:03.560]  that I never actually thought about before that been in the food industry
[56:03.560 --> 56:09.360]  for 20 years engineering generally speaking and in plant-wide operations and
[56:09.360 --> 56:16.000]  I can I can without a doubt let you know that all of the things that that you
[56:16.000 --> 56:22.400]  talk about the things that are in these videos absolutely hit the mark they hit
[56:22.400 --> 56:27.200]  the mark and what what happened along the way was I started to look it up in the
[56:27.200 --> 56:32.600]  sky and I started doing monitoring on all of the the spraying that goes on in
[56:32.600 --> 56:38.320]  the skies here in the Central Valley so got hooked up with the California sky
[56:38.320 --> 56:44.560]  watch and so basically I do logs on all of these items and call specific
[56:44.560 --> 56:49.000]  organizations that I've that I finally found well for those that don't know
[56:49.000 --> 56:53.240]  yes you're you're finding like-minded people and there's nothing better than
[56:53.240 --> 56:58.200]  that camaraderie and those soulmates in this fight for freedom but our team is
[56:58.200 --> 57:04.360]  in California right now with California sky watch and California sky watch and
[57:04.360 --> 57:08.120]  sky watch around the world just like we are changes spreading everywhere in
[57:08.120 --> 57:15.200]  full wars groups Liberty Committee groups whatever you do just start a group
[57:15.200 --> 57:20.440]  and they are sky watch has gotten new footage at meetings where the
[57:20.440 --> 57:25.680]  universities are openly admitting on video that they are chem trailing us
[57:25.680 --> 57:32.640]  and that yes it's bad for the earth but we have to do that to save you from the
[57:32.640 --> 57:37.840]  global warming so it's openly being admitted they're just kind of creeping
[57:37.840 --> 57:43.720]  out in plain view hoping nobody notices yes and I took it to an extra level I
[57:43.720 --> 57:47.600]  started taking samples and started sampling the water because I've done
[57:47.600 --> 57:51.280]  that in my career over time I always had to sample all the water that we used
[57:51.280 --> 57:57.440]  but I actually found the exact the exact items that are that are being
[57:57.440 --> 58:04.240]  discussed so anybody who who has any doubt about this going on it there is no
[58:04.240 --> 58:09.360]  doubt it is a fact there are there are no myths this is no theory there are no
[58:09.360 --> 58:15.520]  theories anymore and I just want to make sure that I stress I have been over time
[58:15.520 --> 58:20.880]  focusing on communicating to people becoming a blogger I never thought I
[58:20.880 --> 58:25.000]  would be doing this in my life what's your blog tell us about it no I'm

[1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:23.320]  Alex Jones
[1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:30.000]  well we are change Los Angeles New York and other we are change groups you just
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:36.240]  knocked it out of the park again but 9-11 truth last two weeks on and off they
[1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:40.000]  have been at the Capitol giving big thick stacks of documents peer-reviewed
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:45.440]  journals of thermite and thermate explosions in the buildings two members
[1:00:45.440 --> 1:00:48.600]  of the House and Senate they've also been spending time in the office
[1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:56.120]  buildings I mean anybody can go in get passes get in to see them and you you see
[1:00:56.120 --> 1:00:59.400]  Jay Rockefeller the great-grandson of the founder of the whole criminal
[1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:05.200]  enterprise big eugenicist himself admitting that their offices are besieged
[1:01:05.200 --> 1:01:13.640]  by 30 40 you know plus people talking about the Bilderberg group and that
[1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:19.080]  everywhere he goes that him and Schumer being asked about the New World Order you
[1:01:19.080 --> 1:01:22.240]  see they can try to intimidate us and say we're all under surveillance and
[1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:27.080]  there's a police state and they're gonna get us all but if we all that is larger
[1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:30.640]  numbers of us start standing up and saying no and getting involved they can't
[1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:34.320]  get everybody I mean just six months ago you'd have a couple members of
[1:01:34.320 --> 1:01:37.720]  Congress getting in Bernanke's face now they're all doing it Republican and
[1:01:37.720 --> 1:01:40.840]  Democrat I want to talk more about this later in the show it's just we're
[1:01:40.840 --> 1:01:44.920]  reaching the tipping point we can beat these people the technocracy can fall
[1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:49.760]  the nightmare can end if we just stop believing the government-controlled
[1:01:49.760 --> 1:01:53.880]  churches that say it's all a foregone conclusion it's the end of the world
[1:01:53.880 --> 1:02:02.640]  give in the devil's gonna rule it's a giant predictive programming sigh up and
[1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:07.840]  like Nunavut we can get a reprieve but if we start believing evils here and if
[1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:16.080]  we start capitulating to it and saying it's unstoppable it will manifest and
[1:02:16.080 --> 1:02:20.040]  I'm not getting into a pro-christian anti-christian debate I myself am a
[1:02:20.040 --> 1:02:25.200]  Christian raised a Christian but this is a secular news program and whether
[1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:29.360]  you're an atheist or an agnostic or a Christian or a Hindu or a Muslim or a
[1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:35.880]  Jew or a a new an Indian or a Hopi Indian you shouldn't like the tyranny
[1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:40.120]  that's unfolding it isn't good any way you slice it or dice it I'm just tired
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:43.920]  to have this wider debate and say man listen the Pentagon says they're
[1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:47.520]  building a giant control grid and it's run by eugenicist and once the new
[1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:51.160]  world order is in place they're gonna forcibly sterilize us and put drugs in
[1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:55.480]  the water and take all our kids and raise them in giant dormitories and the
[1:02:55.480 --> 1:02:58.240]  more internal documents say they're gonna release bio weapons and go ahead and
[1:02:58.240 --> 1:03:02.080]  just kill us forget to sterilizing us we better do something about this and the
[1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:05.680]  evidence is they are poisoning the water in the food and here's the evidence I
[1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:13.400]  mean this is a Mayday situation and the only normal response is going down to
[1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:17.000]  the Senate office building and waiting for Rockefeller to come slinking by and
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:20.840]  to get in his face peaceably and to bring up real issues to this bastard
[1:03:20.840 --> 1:03:25.400]  boy he looks at Luke and he says you got a lot of balls kid you ought to be in
[1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:31.360]  Congress see he gets the mafia respect because Luke's talking about his family
[1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:36.320]  creating eugenics and creating Hitler which is mainline encyclopedia of
[1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:45.240]  Britannica I mean it's not debatable these people are held force and Luke's
[1:03:45.240 --> 1:03:49.200]  gone to Rockefeller's house and confronted him David the head of the
[1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:52.840]  whole thing probably one of the most powerful people he's guaranteed in the
[1:03:52.840 --> 1:04:01.560]  top five may be the most powerful person on the planet and Luke skits death
[1:04:01.560 --> 1:04:04.880]  threats his family gets death threats on video police come up and say we're
[1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:10.320]  gonna plant bombs on you that's in truth rising and we need more you to do

[1:08:34.520 --> 1:08:39.000]  going to do a big news blitz and financial news and the censorship of the
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:44.560]  flesh-eating robot story that was in AP Reuters Fox News it changed everywhere in
[1:08:44.560 --> 1:08:49.360]  a few days saying hey the company wants you to know they're vegetarian robots but
[1:08:49.360 --> 1:08:56.960]  originally the story was saying that it could eat flesh or anything else that
[1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:05.840]  matters so we'll go over the story the robots called the eater but this is a
[1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:09.720]  good way to give people's attention about why the elite want to go to a robot
[1:09:09.720 --> 1:09:16.920]  force and this is not the 1950s it's in science fiction folks it's 2009 you know
[1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:20.680]  with science fiction a hundred years ago to imagine big Jared airplanes flying
[1:09:20.680 --> 1:09:26.760]  above you at 30,000 feet we're living in just an age of wonderment but so much
[1:09:26.760 --> 1:09:30.240]  of it's being used for tyranny so that's coming up now let's just blitz
[1:09:30.240 --> 1:09:35.280]  through your calls right now let's talk to Brian in Florida Brian you're on the
[1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:43.120]  air yes Alex hi I just want to give you some good news just last week I was
[1:09:43.120 --> 1:09:49.040]  appointed to the library board district that the district library board
[1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:53.280]  and what I have some plans I want to make sure there's a screening room in
[1:09:53.280 --> 1:09:57.680]  there I want to perhaps have like once a week there play a film from the library
[1:09:57.680 --> 1:10:04.200]  and try to get in some books and DVDs and actually make the library become a
[1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:08.320]  center of the community yeah you could start having one night a week of viewing
[1:10:08.320 --> 1:10:11.880]  event even if they don't let you you can do it as a private citizen and then
[1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:15.840]  others will get the idea and then suddenly you'll have citizens together
[1:10:15.840 --> 1:10:21.400]  talking every night instead of watching the glowing mind control tube oh yeah
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:27.400]  and of course you you and so many others in this movement told us to you
[1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:32.200]  know take part get getting in public office and and so forth and I have done
[1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:36.400]  just that and for anyone who's interested there's one more opening on the
[1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:41.600]  board at the just you know go for a ties bill for the city council go down the
[1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:45.920]  city hall get an application and there's also other I think there might be one or
[1:10:45.920 --> 1:10:51.480]  two more boards have openings yeah the general way to talk about this is I've
[1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:54.400]  noticed when I have a host fill in who are from here locally they kind of talk
[1:10:54.400 --> 1:10:59.160]  about local stuff all day the way to do it is to say I got on my board here
[1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:04.760]  locally you should get on your board in your city and there are these openings
[1:11:04.760 --> 1:11:09.080]  everywhere and the globalist only need a few of their people over each city and
[1:11:09.080 --> 1:11:14.240]  then they get all their minions in the positions of power over every sector and
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:17.720]  a lot of times no matter what area of government you get into you're gonna
[1:11:17.720 --> 1:11:22.280]  find that government stealing money and so you can also get into government and
[1:11:22.280 --> 1:11:26.520]  find them stealing blow the whistle and then start a chain reaction bringing
[1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:31.160]  down the local government let me tell you we need good people in dog catcher we
[1:11:31.160 --> 1:11:35.960]  need good people in the water board the school board the library board the park
[1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:42.640]  board the sustainability UN people have unlimited funds under agenda 21 now this
[1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:47.360]  is the big 1992 UN agreement of how to globalize every county and city under
[1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:53.200]  immunization and that's how you have standardized zoning all over the world
[1:11:53.200 --> 1:11:59.080]  from Kenya Africa to Austin Texas from Albuquerque New Mexico to New York City
[1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:07.960]  from Berlin Germany to Tokyo Japan it's global standardization and it's all
[1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:12.880]  being done I appreciate your call keep it up Brian let's talk to Johnny in
[1:12:12.880 --> 1:12:17.760]  Florida another call from Florida go ahead Johnny hey what's going on I just
[1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:22.160]  wanted to real quickly say thank you very much out since watching the Obama
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:27.080]  deception my life has been turned completely upside down everything I
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:31.440]  once thought I believe that our government is proven to be untrue and
[1:12:31.440 --> 1:12:35.760]  it's not just from watching the video just from doing the you know the research
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:39.920]  after watching the videos and learning about what really is going on out there
[1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:44.240]  but the real reason for my call is because Johnny's not my real name but I
[1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:49.240]  do work for Brighthouse Networks in Florida and when I saw the story on
[1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:54.960]  Info Wars today it really stuck out at me and it made sense because last week
[1:12:54.960 --> 1:12:59.880]  every employee was given papers saying we are not allowed to talk about our
[1:12:59.880 --> 1:13:07.000]  company to anybody on our my spaces on our Twitter's we're not allowed to talk
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:11.440]  about our political affiliations or anything like that and and everybody in
[1:13:11.440 --> 1:13:14.480]  the company was like why are we having to fill these papers out we've been
[1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:18.360]  working there for a long time yeah everything's a chilling effect just
[1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:23.000]  like you can't have a liberal or conservative kiosk at a mall they're
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:27.480]  banning them all and you can't wear a shirt that says peace or with a dove on
[1:13:27.480 --> 1:13:31.560]  it the cops are coming up and saying take that off it's a protest unauthorized
[1:13:31.560 --> 1:13:36.600]  they're letting everybody know that you lose your job if you speak out it's an
[1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:42.400]  attempt at a chilling effect we've all got to speak out or America dies the
[1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:46.480]  bankers win they get to carry out the eugenics op but I tell folks more about
[1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:52.320]  it well it's basically what's going on with which on Brighthouse Networks we
[1:13:52.320 --> 1:13:56.280]  have been getting some training about even on they say it's for the field text
[1:13:56.280 --> 1:13:59.760]  but even the opera we've been getting training on listening for different
[1:13:59.760 --> 1:14:05.000]  things in the background when we're talking to people on the phones on babies
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:10.040]  crying ask questions why babies might be crying you know different things on if
[1:14:10.040 --> 1:14:13.320]  someone sounds stressed out to make sure everything's okay with them and they're
[1:14:13.320 --> 1:14:16.200]  saying it just for the you know because some people get stressed out about their
[1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:19.560]  cable but it doesn't make sense let me stop you let me tell you let me tell you
[1:14:19.560 --> 1:14:24.480]  how do you introduce to a country that was once free to be Stasi secret police
[1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:31.200]  spies how does it happen they always say well nationwide and worldwide like the
[1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:36.320]  New York Times reported they tell the middle schoolers and even younger but
[1:14:36.320 --> 1:14:39.840]  by middle school they write mock tickets to mommy for leaving the water on while
[1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:44.720]  she brushes her teeth mock tickets on to mommy for taking a hot bath and the
[1:14:44.720 --> 1:14:47.880]  parents are in the New York Times in the Washington Post in these articles that
[1:14:47.880 --> 1:14:52.880]  we've read on air going oh I'm so glad my daughter my nine-year-old daughter my
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:58.000]  ten-year-old daughter is reporting me now it's so good she's helping me lower my
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:02.960]  carbon footprint it's put out there like it's normal and so the way they turn
[1:15:02.960 --> 1:15:09.000]  everybody into a spy it's just oh you're a social worker now you've got to listen
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:14.040]  for what's in the background and so if somebody if you hear somebody yell at
[1:15:14.040 --> 1:15:17.920]  their kid the CPS now says that's abuse I have the Texas Handbook they tried to
[1:15:17.920 --> 1:15:22.440]  steal one of our employees kids and they said yelling we take your kids there's
[1:15:22.440 --> 1:15:26.440]  no law but still the police follow orders and come and take them and so
[1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:30.960]  they're getting ready to totally convert the economy to police state and so
[1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:36.240]  everyone cable workers carpet cleaners operators on the phone I've seen reports
[1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:42.600]  where they're training the Indian people in India 8,000 miles away to spy and
[1:15:42.600 --> 1:15:45.120]  listen to what's happening in your house
[1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:48.920]  Google's announced the cameras and microphones in your computers they're
[1:15:48.920 --> 1:15:52.840]  using that to listen to your home and just openly announcing it like it's no
[1:15:52.840 --> 1:15:58.120]  big deal and so yes but but at first it's so just just ask if they're okay and
[1:15:58.120 --> 1:16:03.000]  go ahead and make a note of it and then next it's go ahead and you know oh now
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.600]  we're gonna have you listen to the recordings because they're recording
[1:16:05.600 --> 1:16:10.040]  what's going on and so this is their pretext but I'm gonna shut up go ahead
[1:16:10.040 --> 1:16:13.960]  and tell us what else they're telling you to do well I just I actually got a
[1:16:13.960 --> 1:16:18.400]  run out but I just wanted to say keep up the fight I definitely believe eugenics
[1:16:18.400 --> 1:16:22.240]  is the most sinister thing I've heard about the more I read about it the more
[1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:26.480]  it makes me sick but I do I am a believer and I know God's in control of
[1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:30.280]  everything in the end and we will win the fight hold on I know you've been
[1:16:30.280 --> 1:16:34.200]  holding for 30 minutes to get on hold on hold on are you at work right now no
[1:16:34.200 --> 1:16:37.800]  I'm about to take a shower so I can get I know you gotta go between be five minutes
[1:16:37.800 --> 1:16:42.280]  late here as a specific Lee I'm gonna shut up here we're about to go to break
[1:16:42.280 --> 1:16:46.600]  up just tell me specifically they're telling you to ask social worker
[1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:49.600]  questions and and again they're easing you in where it sounds reasonable at
[1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:54.320]  first specifically what are they saying well that we it's just a training man
[1:16:54.320 --> 1:16:57.840]  it's just training on hearing what's going on the customer it's all done for
[1:16:57.840 --> 1:17:01.480]  customer service we work for a customer they're happy they're not stressed out
[1:17:01.480 --> 1:17:04.920]  we deal with a lot of older people if you hear baby crying well you know is
[1:17:04.920 --> 1:17:09.280]  everything okay you know when you hear people with stress levels raising up
[1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:13.480]  ask them questions on on what's going on you know different things obviously
[1:17:13.480 --> 1:17:17.240]  there there's key things when they make when they make you know threats and
[1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:20.600]  things like that and anger you know make sure that they don't have a weapon on
[1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:23.000]  them or they're not going to threaten us but it's almost sometimes like they
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:26.360]  want us to get the person to threaten us if we would just kind of leave some of
[1:17:26.360 --> 1:17:29.520]  the people are just pissed because they're you see the news where
[1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:32.640]  important people yell at the at the at the customer service they're now swat
[1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:35.920]  teaming them and charging them that's ridiculous under terrorism but here's
[1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:41.560]  the issue that's all being recorded and uploaded to the police I guarantee it
[1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:46.760]  absolutely then we yeah every single call is recorded that I made I'm when
[1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:50.800]  we're coached on calls they can pull up every single call that's made within a
[1:17:50.800 --> 1:17:53.760]  second it's right there in front of what about what about getting the
[1:17:53.760 --> 1:17:57.680]  technicians to spy on people when they're in the homes well I I'm not a
[1:17:57.680 --> 1:18:02.520]  technician so I don't have information on that but I wouldn't be surprised I
[1:18:02.520 --> 1:18:06.200]  mean you know of course where I and also I just wanted to take bright house is
[1:18:06.200 --> 1:18:09.640]  not owned by Time Warner as some of the people on the website it's actually
[1:18:09.640 --> 1:18:13.920]  owned by Advanced Newhouse which is the same company owns a lot of the major
[1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:17.880]  publications like the Star Ledger and things like that so it's it's we're all
[1:18:17.880 --> 1:18:24.680]  we're owned by Advanced Newhouse Watson Watson's got that part wrong yes we'll
[1:18:24.680 --> 1:18:29.160]  correct that right now advanced it was it previously owned by Time Warner no we
[1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:33.240]  cable companies always take over each other so Time Warner Time Warner was in
[1:18:33.240 --> 1:18:36.360]  this area at one time then we kind of took it over that's how cable companies
[1:18:36.360 --> 1:18:41.560]  work they know I guess for several years too so we'll just we'll just we'll
[1:18:41.560 --> 1:18:46.880]  check into that do me a favor talk to some of the some of the repair guys you
[1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:52.160]  see them on the parking lot say hey I saw an article about you know are you

[1:24:28.200 --> 1:24:32.400]  say three hours the four-hour show I just cover one subject and have a few
[1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:36.080]  reporters on about confirmed cases of what we're covering but then have
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:42.240]  listeners say like I'm reading this Fox News story about cable company employees
[1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:46.800]  spying on you operation bright eyes well we already know about this but now it's
[1:24:46.800 --> 1:24:51.000]  mainstream news why not have other people call in trucking companies and
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:56.360]  other telephone company people and call in fake name whatever and say yeah look
[1:24:56.360 --> 1:25:01.280]  into this my company's doing that just you know we've done a few shows like
[1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:04.920]  that years ago and those are just amazing so much info comes out so we're
[1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:08.560]  going to definitely starting next week once a week we'll do a different subject
[1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:15.640]  and like I've done shows like send us documents on mass graves and then we get
[1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:19.240]  confirmed state of New York secret documents about preparing mass graves
[1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:23.600]  for flu going back two years ago and then people call the numbers the news
[1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:29.760]  then calls the numbers and confirms the documents we got that's how we break most
[1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:33.800]  the big national stories we break is people feeding us the info and we can
[1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:37.760]  do it live time on prison planet dot TV have folks sending us documents and we
[1:25:37.760 --> 1:25:40.800]  could have a team in there calling the numbers double checking the documents
[1:25:40.800 --> 1:25:43.560]  you know I got a homeland security document how do I check it I call and
[1:25:43.560 --> 1:25:51.360]  say I've got document Q794LL30- here dealing with this Alex Jones GC and
[1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:55.920]  radio network I'd like to confirm this is your document how did you get that
[1:25:55.920 --> 1:25:59.720]  document who gave that to you I'd like to know what which agent gave it to you
[1:25:59.720 --> 1:26:03.760]  is this yours I'd like to give you a supervisor you talked to supervisor and
[1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:09.160]  they say yes that's our document or you can be even more sneaky and just call
[1:26:09.160 --> 1:26:18.960]  it and say yeah I need another copy of 0 3 Q 9 4 5 you know dash EL 3 9er oh boy
[1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:22.320]  and then people can't believe it always when we break it then later it comes out
[1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:29.160]  it's real but I want to do more of that hey we got Ted Pike coming up we might
[1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:36.520]  still kill the hate bill was the headline and there's another headline that I
[1:26:36.520 --> 1:26:41.240]  want to print that hate bill passes but not as bad as it first was I want to get
[1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:45.760]  that second one we'll get an update to on the cyberbullying act and the rest of
[1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:53.200]  the garbage coming up and continue with your phone calls Rand Paul is coming up
[1:26:53.200 --> 1:26:57.880]  as well but before I do that I just wanted to briefly put out this
[1:26:57.880 --> 1:27:03.160]  announcement but I want listeners to please pay attention to what I'm saying
[1:27:03.160 --> 1:27:10.120]  because this is very very important Ted Anderson owns Midas Resources he's been
[1:27:10.120 --> 1:27:15.680]  in gold and silver brokering for now 30 years 30 years this year and Midas
[1:27:15.680 --> 1:27:20.520]  Resources has done something that's made it really a leader in gold and silver
[1:27:20.520 --> 1:27:24.600]  it temple by golden silver when it's low or when it dips it hadn't been low much
[1:27:24.600 --> 1:27:30.040]  last few years and then when it goes up he sells it at a lower price but it's
[1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:34.600]  been probably five six months since he had a deal like this and this is the end
[1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:41.760]  of the deal he bought gold when it at the 900 and 910 level some of the gold he
[1:27:41.760 --> 1:27:47.200]  bought at the 910 some of the 901 level he told me and so those cost savings are
[1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:52.880]  priced in the gold he's selling is priced into that level of the market when
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:28:06.680]  it's 956 dollars right now up over $50 from when he priced this in 956 as I
[1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:13.600]  just refreshed Kitco so this is the end of that deal yesterday he told you it
[1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:19.200]  was the end of the silver sold out at the $18 an ounce these Lakota's everywhere
[1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:23.280]  else are going for $25 I've seen them a few places have them for like 20 those
[1:28:23.280 --> 1:28:30.180]  have gone up to $19 and 53 cents gorgeous silver dollar put out of the
[1:28:30.180 --> 1:28:37.560]  Lakota nation pure silver 9999 whatever it is $19.53 so that went up but he is
[1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:43.400]  at the absolute tail end of Frank's at the old price this is not gone up but
[1:28:43.400 --> 1:28:48.480]  this is the end the silver it's over still get a great deal on it the Frank's
[1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:54.640]  are 216 and the sovereigns are 266 those are just fabulous deals on gold at
[1:28:54.640 --> 1:28:59.000]  bullion level pricing when the market was lower and these are even semi-new as
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:02.600]  manic they have some collector value a lot of them are a hundred years old
[1:29:02.600 --> 1:29:09.560]  European so this is the end of that deal if you want to get gold cheaper than I
[1:29:09.560 --> 1:29:18.800]  can find it anywhere else 800-686-2237-1800-686-2237 and Ted said he's
[1:29:18.800 --> 1:29:26.440]  holding it through till tonight and then it's definitely gone 800-686-2237 on
[1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:32.240]  the Frank's at 216 incredible deal the markets now over 50 bucks higher and
[1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:38.160]  sovereigns at 266 excellent deal as well and the Lakota's have gone up but not
[1:29:38.160 --> 1:29:47.800]  much 1953 now for each coin 800-686-2237 don't procrastinate get them today up

[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:05.080]  never seen anything like it he said this off air I said I wish you would have
[1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:08.600]  said that on there but at the end of the show he wanted to talk and the next
[1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:12.040]  time he's on he says he's gonna talk about he said the buzz is insane
[1:37:12.040 --> 1:37:17.640]  everywhere he goes people bring up the Obama deception everywhere he goes he
[1:37:17.640 --> 1:37:21.840]  talks about it and I don't want to drop names but I was in Hollywood working on
[1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:26.280]  some stuff over the weekend and this films one of the hottest in the
[1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:29.920]  underground there with big stars this is the reason you see as a
[1:37:29.920 --> 1:37:34.760]  privilege in dropping is because people are getting this film out folks we have
[1:37:34.760 --> 1:37:39.520]  no way of knowing how many times been washed on the web three months in yeah
[1:37:39.520 --> 1:37:43.640]  it was 15 million I'm guessing three months after it's 20 million and I'm
[1:37:43.640 --> 1:37:48.160]  just saying as if the film's getting smaller it's getting bigger own the
[1:37:48.160 --> 1:37:54.360]  phenomenon on DVD have this in your library they could shut the web off
[1:37:54.360 --> 1:37:58.720]  they can't shut you making copies of DVDs down get it by dummy DVDs copies
[1:37:58.720 --> 1:38:08.320]  make the copies of it by the blank DVDs make copies today get the duplication
[1:38:08.320 --> 1:38:12.800]  machines they're cheap make copies get it out folks this is so important the
[1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:18.080]  Obama deception this is my biggest film I've had a lot of other big hits and I
[1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:20.800]  measure a hit by reaching millions of millions of people in effecting change
[1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:27.200]  this has had more effect than probably all my films combined in six months
[1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:34.440]  that's scary the Obama deception now this film is number two in that and it
[1:38:34.440 --> 1:38:37.720]  needs to be bigger than the Obama deception this is frankly more important
[1:38:37.720 --> 1:38:42.120]  in game I'm gonna shut up go to Ted Pike don't want to get into the robotics
[1:38:42.120 --> 1:38:46.480]  news the economy news much of the stuff I got here as well not gonna keep the
[1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:50.360]  Reverend long Reverend can you just recap we have a lot of new listeners every day
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:54.760]  who don't know what the hate bill does versus the cyber bullying what this does
[1:38:54.760 --> 1:38:58.600]  to free speech you've got the bills on your website what ended up happening in
[1:38:58.600 --> 1:39:03.520]  the House and Senate where we are right now Reverend Ted Pike well basically the
[1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:07.480]  federal hate crimes bill which has now been passed by both the House and the
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:14.640]  Senate is a the Norwellian attempt to basically unite federal and local
[1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:20.280]  policing power it's number two it's that it will create a biased oriented
[1:39:20.280 --> 1:39:26.880]  justice system in America which which says that our thoughts our biases when
[1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:32.240]  they result in some kind of speech that causes violent crimes or prejudice
[1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:37.360]  against others becomes a hate crime when this when this bill will be if it is
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:42.600]  passed it will it will be turned over largely to federal judges and judges all
[1:39:42.600 --> 1:39:47.360]  all up the ladder to adjudicate from the bench most of them will be liberal and
[1:39:47.360 --> 1:39:53.840]  they'll do more than just adjudicate in in favor of punishing violent hate crimes
[1:39:53.840 --> 1:40:01.320]  they will also spread it out to outlaw verbal violence those words that hold up
[1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:05.960]  certain protected groups such as homosexuals Jews etc to hatred and
[1:40:05.960 --> 1:40:10.840]  contempt and for those that don't know we have read over both the bills here on
[1:40:10.840 --> 1:40:15.080]  air with the hate crime bill itself very close to passing it's saying that if
[1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:21.000]  you do something that that down the road years later they say you influence
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:24.240]  someone to do violence even though you didn't call for violence you're now
[1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:28.600]  guilt by association like the Soviet Union you literally go to the gulag and
[1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:34.280]  then the cyber bullying act says if you hurt someone's feelings on the web or
[1:40:34.280 --> 1:40:38.840]  try to influence a politician that that's intimidation you go to prison I
[1:40:38.840 --> 1:40:45.120]  mean this is this is an incremental tyranny this is skipping jumping ahead
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:40:48.680]  all the way to the end this is more draconian than than any legislation we've
[1:40:48.680 --> 1:40:55.120]  ever seen absolutely now last week we were able to generate massive calling
[1:40:55.120 --> 1:41:00.560]  finally at the last moment about three days with the phones were jammed and we
[1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:05.080]  were able to influence the democrats in on the floor of the senate and they
[1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:11.320]  passed the brownback amendment which does include within the hate bill a very
[1:41:11.320 --> 1:41:17.080]  very concise very a specific language saying that unless there's the imminent
[1:41:17.080 --> 1:41:24.040]  immediate speech that will invite people to violence hate motivated violence
[1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:29.480]  that that pastors and talk to a host can't be indicted so that was a real
[1:41:29.480 --> 1:41:34.000]  deliverance but what the problem is right now is that in conference in the
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:39.200]  fall the brownback amendment could be stripped off and in also we have a
[1:41:39.200 --> 1:41:45.240]  really a new window of opportunity here actually to defeat the hate bill I had
[1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:49.280]  hoped you see let me just back up over here a little bit now let's stop right
[1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:52.240]  there I want you to get into that Reverend Pike but but but first can you
[1:41:52.240 --> 1:41:55.200]  explain for those of us that don't know and I try to study this and it gets
[1:41:55.200 --> 1:42:01.920]  murky the legislative history of this so we understand where we're at now well
[1:42:01.920 --> 1:42:07.480]  the anti defamation league began in 1988 at their Hofstra conference in New
[1:42:07.480 --> 1:42:15.040]  York to jumpstart a model hate crimes law for America during the 19 and 90s
[1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:21.760]  they persuaded some as some 45 states to adopt that and some kind of a
[1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:26.520]  state crimes law but their bigger ambition was always the creation of
[1:42:26.520 --> 1:42:30.240]  federal hate crimes law which would give them behind the scenes the
[1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:35.000]  empowerment to to prosecute and end free speech and persecute especially
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:40.880]  Christians in America now historically after 12 years of trying and five
[1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:45.480]  defeats they have passed their big federal hate crimes bill that's in a
[1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:50.160]  nutshell it's it's a barreling forward to conference in the fall and for those
[1:42:50.160 --> 1:42:53.920]  that don't know conferences in between the House and Senate to try to make any
[1:42:53.920 --> 1:42:59.440]  final changes so that it's a unified piece of legislation is there any way to
[1:42:59.440 --> 1:43:05.360]  shoot it down in conference or just try to keep that particular amendment on it
[1:43:05.360 --> 1:43:12.040]  here's here's the only strategy I can I can figure out now president Obama has
[1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:18.320]  repeatedly said in recent weeks he's warned Congress that if they add from
[1:43:18.320 --> 1:43:25.560]  7 to 12 extra raptor that's f-22 raptor fighters to the defense authorization
[1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:30.320]  bill to which the hate bill has now been attached he will veto it in other
[1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:36.360]  words he will veto both the DoD bill with the hate bill on there and
[1:43:36.360 --> 1:43:43.360]  unfortunately this last week the the Senate did decide to strip off the
[1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:47.120]  raptor fighters in order to please the president and not jeopardize the hate
[1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:54.960]  bill however the House a month ago voted overwhelmingly by a huge margin to
[1:43:54.960 --> 1:44:00.160]  keep all those raptor fighters so we have basically we have two DoD bills now we
[1:44:00.160 --> 1:44:06.320]  have one that's overwhelmingly loaded down with 7 to 12 raptor fighters and
[1:44:06.320 --> 1:44:10.080]  support from the House representatives and then we have another bill from the
[1:44:10.080 --> 1:44:14.800]  Senate which doesn't have those extra raptors on there now what we have to do
[1:44:14.800 --> 1:44:19.840]  what I believe our only real real option now is throughout this summer we've got
[1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:26.960]  to join with the very powerful defense arms industry as well as workers in 44
[1:44:26.960 --> 1:44:32.920]  states who are even now lobbying we have to lobby to get those raptors back on
[1:44:32.920 --> 1:44:39.800]  to the final DoD hate bill in in conference in September we have to
[1:44:39.800 --> 1:44:45.440]  create a bill which is so offensive so overloaded with extra raptors that
[1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:52.000]  Obama will be put on the firing line he will have to he will veto the hate bill
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:58.440]  along with the DoD bill Ted Pike I know it's important to defeat this it's
[1:44:58.440 --> 1:45:04.720]  critical but Obama is such a liar that he he he hardly ever does what he says
[1:45:04.720 --> 1:45:10.320]  he's gonna do in fact he really never does so if he says he'll veto it if the
[1:45:10.320 --> 1:45:14.360]  raptors are on it doesn't that mean he'll probably sign it with even more
[1:45:14.360 --> 1:45:18.600]  glee than the raptors are there this is a big standoff this is the first of the
[1:45:18.600 --> 1:45:23.720]  total challenge he has given to his Democratic Senate this is a standoff
[1:45:23.720 --> 1:45:29.960]  he is wanting to posture here as one who is frugal with taxpayers money who
[1:45:29.960 --> 1:45:35.880]  cares about protecting America is not the servant of the arms industry even
[1:45:35.880 --> 1:45:40.520]  though he's a left-of-left liberal he wants to give a conservative counter
[1:45:40.520 --> 1:45:44.960]  balance here to all the money to see well meanwhile he's stolen 23.7 trillion
[1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:48.960]  with the last administration so that's exactly what I'm saying now this is a
[1:45:48.960 --> 1:45:52.640]  real standoff and rather than saying oh Obama will just go with the hate bill
[1:45:52.640 --> 1:45:55.960]  because his heart is with the hate bill you know that you know the hate bill is
[1:45:55.960 --> 1:45:59.920]  a lot of trash you know he doesn't have any real loyalty he's taking he's doing
[1:45:59.920 --> 1:46:04.960]  he's promoting it on instruction from unseen powers behind the scenes what we
[1:46:04.960 --> 1:46:09.560]  want to do here is we want to create a contest a rivalry between the
[1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:14.360]  Democratic Senate and the House who perhaps can be persuaded in conference
[1:46:14.360 --> 1:46:20.320]  to defy him versus his reputation and his the image he wants to create and if we
[1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:25.280]  can do that if we can join all summer long getting those phone calls not only
[1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:29.560]  into House and Senate members but also on the other hand to the president
[1:46:29.560 --> 1:46:35.360]  encouraging him him encouraging him to stand by his promise and veto the arms
[1:46:35.360 --> 1:46:40.080]  hate bill package I believe this is a real viable opportunity I believe it's
[1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:45.120]  the only a real opportunity we do have to kill the hate bill that because okay
[1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:50.400]  well let's try to kill the hate bill but but password Ted pike let's look at the
[1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:57.160]  states go over the bill as it stands now if it does become law total federalization
[1:46:57.160 --> 1:47:03.080]  of police the police openly being turned into political commissars under the DHS
[1:47:03.080 --> 1:47:08.160]  report veterans are terrorists gun owners Ron Paul libertarians Christians
[1:47:08.160 --> 1:47:13.360]  clergy response teams neighborhood tattletale squads all southern
[1:47:13.360 --> 1:47:18.240]  poverty law center and ADL trained I mean we're not kidding when we say this
[1:47:18.240 --> 1:47:22.520]  is right out of Bolshevik Russia that's right you see even though this brown
[1:47:22.520 --> 1:47:26.600]  back amendment is at least temporarily put on there until conference
[1:47:26.600 --> 1:47:31.640]  nevertheless the whole way to this bill the whole momentum of it is to create a
[1:47:31.640 --> 1:47:36.440]  thought crimes bias oriented justice system in America and regardless of these
[1:47:36.440 --> 1:47:41.880]  caveats like the brown back amendment nevertheless the practical the practical
[1:47:41.880 --> 1:47:46.800]  result is that when this is when this is passed and if it becomes law then there
[1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:51.000]  will there will begin to be indictments put down from the federal government with
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:55.560]  the ADL and the driver's seat in the background and these cases will go
[1:47:55.560 --> 1:48:01.360]  before judges at every stage and the judicial ladder and they primarily will
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:07.400]  be liberals they will be the if exercising compassion and in a more of a
[1:48:07.400 --> 1:48:12.480]  holistic approach to the law they will not only enforce the federal law against
[1:48:12.480 --> 1:48:17.320]  violent hate criminals but against verbal violence okay those words which cut
[1:48:17.320 --> 1:48:21.600]  and hurt and so this will very rapidly flow out and brought it into a broad
[1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:25.600]  hate crimes speech crimes law for America separately where is the cyber
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:30.880]  bullying act boy that suckers scary yeah the cyber bullying act is still in the
[1:48:30.880 --> 1:48:35.080]  house judiciary subcommittee on crime the the Democrats have been really
[1:48:35.080 --> 1:48:38.960]  overloaded trying to get the hate bill through but you can be sure that next
[1:48:38.960 --> 1:48:43.960]  September October that will be coming through and by the way it you don't even
[1:48:43.960 --> 1:48:48.600]  have to hurt somebody's feelings on the internet to be undyed indictable under
[1:48:48.600 --> 1:48:55.320]  the 1960s 1966 the cyber bullying act you have to only intend to you see how
[1:48:55.320 --> 1:48:59.680]  what it was a thought crimes law this is you only have to intend no I know I mean
[1:48:59.680 --> 1:49:04.200]  I've we've read the passages here on air it's hard to believe it but it's the
[1:49:04.200 --> 1:49:09.280]  actual bill I mean this is more draconian in the hate speech laws in
[1:49:09.280 --> 1:49:12.920]  Europe and and folks if you don't think the cops won't come and arrest you and
[1:49:12.920 --> 1:49:17.880]  the judges won't throw you in jail they can't wait to do it look at these DHS
[1:49:17.880 --> 1:49:22.920]  reports yeah and you see that's why it's so important to whack a liberal on the
[1:49:22.920 --> 1:49:27.440]  cloud here and in stop the big federal hate bill because if the federal hate
[1:49:27.440 --> 1:49:32.640]  bill goes through it there'll be a breaking of the dam a deluge of more
[1:49:32.640 --> 1:49:39.480]  and more of this ADL legislation coming through well most of his agenda is
[1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:46.440]  failing he did get his his stimulus package his pay off to his can his
[1:49:46.440 --> 1:49:52.960]  crony package that big pork barrel and he did they have gotten their hate bill
[1:49:52.960 --> 1:49:57.280]  at least so far but on the greenhouse gas stuff that's dead in the Senate at
[1:49:57.280 --> 1:50:02.560]  least for now on the second amendment stuff he has bills to basically in the
[1:50:02.560 --> 1:50:05.880]  second amendment allow the attorney general to ban anything with just the
[1:50:05.880 --> 1:50:10.680]  struggle of a pen so a lot of his agenda is stalling and his approval
[1:50:10.680 --> 1:50:14.560]  rating is dropping but but it is interesting that the first thing they
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:18.400]  wanted to do was get this hate bill that was the first thing was to kill free
[1:50:18.400 --> 1:50:22.260]  speech in America and senator Jay Rockefeller is running around saying we
[1:50:22.260 --> 1:50:25.960]  be better off without the internet and he wants to restrict free speech so
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:30.600]  these guys have really shown themselves to be pure anti-american trash and

[1:55:13.080 --> 1:55:16.640]  that so we're not responsible for what commenters say side issue let me start
[1:55:16.640 --> 1:55:21.200]  over cable TV workers trained to spy on citizens
[1:55:21.200 --> 1:55:26.240]  bright house networks employees will watch for suspicious behavior which
[1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:30.200]  according to law enforcement DHS guidelines includes being politically
[1:55:30.200 --> 1:55:35.320]  active displaying bumper stickers or disagreeing with the government and you
[1:55:35.320 --> 1:55:38.520]  can go to bright houses own statements they say oh we want them to know the
[1:55:38.520 --> 1:55:42.440]  community and watch for anything out of the ordinary and if they see a spank
[1:55:42.440 --> 1:55:46.800]  your kids not against the law they're still gonna go take your kids or they
[1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:50.400]  smell something smells like pot you're gonna get SWAT team it happens people I
[1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:55.760]  know all the time I mean that you know one of the prison planet forum
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:56:03.120]  moderators JC Coyote he had some reloading stuff so they SWAT team you
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:07.720]  know not allowed to reload in America look strange to them so it was over one
[1:56:07.720 --> 1:56:10.800]  of the largest cable TV companies the United States is training its employees
[1:56:10.800 --> 1:56:13.640]  to look for suspicious behavior important to police of the guys of
[1:56:13.640 --> 1:56:17.080]  neighborhood watch initiative since according to law enforcement Homeland
[1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:20.920]  Security guidelines suspicious behavior includes owning guns being politically
[1:56:20.920 --> 1:56:24.880]  active and having bumper stickers on your car the cable guys next visit to your
[1:56:24.880 --> 1:56:28.040]  house may turn out to have even more interesting consequences than the
[1:56:28.040 --> 1:56:34.080]  originally anticipated operation bright eyes is designed to maximize the eyes
[1:56:34.080 --> 1:56:38.360]  and ears of bright house networks field service representatives and other
[1:56:38.360 --> 1:56:42.440]  employees to easily identify suspicious behavior and to quickly report
[1:56:42.440 --> 1:56:50.160]  criminal activities to the police according to Fox News all current and
[1:56:50.160 --> 1:56:53.320]  new bright house employees will receive training to help them use the resources
[1:56:53.320 --> 1:56:57.120]  their disposal a secret police I would have to become familiar with residents
[1:56:57.120 --> 1:57:01.880]  activities in the neighborhoods yes spy on everyone and report anything they
[1:57:01.880 --> 1:57:05.840]  deem unusual to the authorities in order to keep our neighborhood safe since
[1:57:05.840 --> 1:57:10.520]  when was it the job of the cable guy to run around pretending to be an undercover
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:14.440]  cop the program is ripe for abuse and another advancement of the elite
[1:57:14.440 --> 1:57:19.880]  tattletale society being created in order to make the sheeple self police their
[1:57:19.880 --> 1:57:24.680]  behavior constantly aware that they are being watched by secret police living in
[1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:29.520]  fear that big brother will catch any minor indiscretion and I had the Wall
[1:57:29.520 --> 1:57:33.080]  Street Journal writer here and she said everywhere she was in in England to do a
[1:57:33.080 --> 1:57:36.400]  travel piece people would run up say you can't photograph it's illegal it's
[1:57:36.400 --> 1:57:40.840]  terrorism she try to be at the canals take a photo it landmarks and when I was
[1:57:40.840 --> 1:57:45.520]  in DC last year they'd run up and say turn your cameras off anywhere it's
[1:57:45.520 --> 1:57:51.200]  about an oppressive system where we're all slaves and they're taking the
[1:57:51.200 --> 1:57:54.960]  neighborhood watch groups and the compulsory kid you know youth service

[2:00:29.680 --> 2:00:34.760]  liberty lovers standing up ron paul has gone from being someone unknown almost
[2:00:34.760 --> 2:00:38.680]  obscure compared to some congressman to the most internationally interviewed
[2:00:38.680 --> 2:00:42.200]  congressman that's mainstream news what is he the second most interviewed
[2:00:42.200 --> 2:00:47.960]  congressman now you know on us media and we've gone from almost no one knowing
[2:00:47.960 --> 2:00:50.920]  the federal reserve's private run-for-profit to the majority of
[2:00:50.920 --> 2:00:54.840]  people knowing about it it's one of the most searched Google terms and it's
[2:00:54.840 --> 2:00:57.960]  something being talked about everywhere that it's offshore it's a criminal
[2:00:57.960 --> 2:01:03.560]  corporate takeover now I told folks that when ron paul ran he said look I'm not
[2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:08.160]  promising I can win don't get mad at me some people did they expected instant
[2:01:08.160 --> 2:01:12.040]  gratification like a cheeseburger you get in 30 seconds you start stamping your
[2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:16.560]  foot after 30 seconds if the line doesn't move at mcdonald's the globalist
[2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:19.760]  didn't build their system overnight we're not going to defeat overnight we're
[2:01:19.760 --> 2:01:24.360]  having giant success right now and we need more people under the ron paul
[2:01:24.360 --> 2:01:30.480]  mannell the liberty committee idea the campaign for liberty idea to run for
[2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:34.680]  congress run for senate run for governor run for city council run for county
[2:01:34.680 --> 2:01:42.120]  commissioner run for city board whatever it's happening now and somebody
[2:01:42.120 --> 2:01:50.040]  were drafting to run for the u.s. senate is the son of dr. ron paul dr. rand
[2:01:50.040 --> 2:01:55.160]  paul he's an eye doctor and he's raising the money looks like he's gonna run
[2:01:55.160 --> 2:01:59.120]  getting the support behind him very very exciting last time they were on
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:03.440]  biggest support they've seen crash their servers like ron paul said here in the
[2:02:03.440 --> 2:02:06.880]  middle of his campaign half the support they were getting was coming from the
[2:02:06.880 --> 2:02:11.040]  show then later it opened up to where it was it was a wider audience but the
[2:02:11.040 --> 2:02:14.880]  point is you guys out there are literally driving the revolution for
[2:02:14.880 --> 2:02:17.760]  liberty and freedom against the revolutionary corporate takeover
[2:02:17.760 --> 2:02:24.600]  banksters and so that's why the process of just ron paul running educated
[2:02:24.600 --> 2:02:28.800]  everybody about inflation and private banks and the federal reserve and
[2:02:28.800 --> 2:02:34.960]  globalism and that the left-right paradigms of fraud we need his son in
[2:02:34.960 --> 2:02:40.040]  the u.s. senate dr. rand paul doc it's good to have you on with us
[2:02:40.040 --> 2:02:42.000]  let me back with you alex
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:45.640]  we're about to break in some stations joins the next segment but uh...
[2:02:45.640 --> 2:02:48.360]  are you running i mean it looks like you're running
[2:02:48.360 --> 2:02:51.920]  we're very very close and we're gonna have a final announcement within two
[2:02:51.920 --> 2:02:53.240]  weeks
[2:02:53.240 --> 2:02:56.680]  uh... still putting some things together having some last-minute
[2:02:56.680 --> 2:02:59.160]  discussions with family and friends
[2:02:59.160 --> 2:03:04.440]  and i will only run and make the decision if i think we absolutely have a
[2:03:04.440 --> 2:03:06.440]  chance to win
[2:03:06.440 --> 2:03:10.360]  campaign will not be just about education or protest
[2:03:10.360 --> 2:03:13.120]  we will have not only the money
[2:03:13.120 --> 2:03:14.800]  but the organization
[2:03:14.800 --> 2:03:16.640]  uh... the name recognition
[2:03:16.640 --> 2:03:20.840]  and everything else it takes to win on the ground
[2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:25.440]  your father ran once for the house and lost one the second time so
[2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:29.000]  uh... certainly we wanted ron paul to win and certainly want you to win but
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:31.880]  i'm just saying it's win-win either way
[2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:35.880]  uh... you know the the just the battle itself is victory
[2:03:35.880 --> 2:03:39.720]  well particularly my father's case it was because not winning the president
[2:03:39.720 --> 2:03:40.400]  the
[2:03:40.400 --> 2:03:44.600]  he did win the attention particularly for being right about the housing bubble
[2:03:44.600 --> 2:03:46.480]  and predicting that it would come
[2:03:46.480 --> 2:03:50.680]  so now he is the go-to guy they go to him and they ask him about the federal
[2:03:50.680 --> 2:03:51.680]  reserve
[2:03:51.680 --> 2:03:55.800]  the overwhelming support i've never seen anything like it
[2:03:55.800 --> 2:03:59.240]  the co-sponsorship for the audit the fed bill
[2:03:59.240 --> 2:04:03.320]  my dad says that it would almost assuredly passed both the house and the
[2:04:03.320 --> 2:04:06.320]  senate if and when they give it a vote
[2:04:06.320 --> 2:04:09.200]  that's still a pretty big if
[2:04:09.200 --> 2:04:11.960]  well that's what i wanted to talk about when we get back i want your take on
[2:04:11.960 --> 2:04:14.240]  what i was discussing but from your own perspective
[2:04:14.240 --> 2:04:15.840]  how far we've come
[2:04:15.840 --> 2:04:19.080]  i think we need to recognize the victories we've had and realize we're in
[2:04:19.080 --> 2:04:20.120]  this fight
[2:04:20.120 --> 2:04:22.120]  against the globalist and
[2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:25.640]  uh... where things are going right now in the senate within blocking the vote
[2:04:25.640 --> 2:04:27.400]  right now to audit the fed
[2:04:27.400 --> 2:04:30.840]  but as your father said earlier this week or late last week there's no way
[2:04:30.840 --> 2:04:31.800]  they can win
[2:04:31.800 --> 2:04:34.960]  the longer they try to cover up and block this vote
[2:04:34.960 --> 2:04:35.960]  uh... the more
[2:04:35.960 --> 2:04:38.440]  people wake up to the fact that they're the problem
[2:04:38.440 --> 2:04:41.360]  not the solution dr rand paul as our guest will give you

[2:07:12.480 --> 2:07:16.240]  chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water many of these
[2:07:16.240 --> 2:07:20.080]  chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental

[2:08:04.080 --> 2:08:12.960]  alex jones on the GCN radio network 1-800-259-9231 if you'd like to talk to
[2:08:12.960 --> 2:08:17.880]  Dr. Rand Paul son of Ron Paul running for US Senate out of Kentucky I think
[2:08:17.880 --> 2:08:21.520]  destiny is he's going to run I'll be very surprised if he doesn't he said the
[2:08:21.520 --> 2:08:27.800]  next two weeks you'll hear the main announcement but Dr. Rand Paul let's
[2:08:27.800 --> 2:08:32.880]  go over go over the most important issues right now I was asking during the
[2:08:32.880 --> 2:08:36.880]  break what you think's most important and you made the point that they did it
[2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:41.680]  that that the private fellow reserve made this debt they created this system
[2:08:41.680 --> 2:08:45.760]  and you went back to Andrew Jackson go over that with interesting thing is that
[2:08:45.760 --> 2:08:50.160]  I think the two are always linked and particularly when people try to sort of
[2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:54.200]  make us outside the mainstream about talking about the Fed if I say the Fed
[2:08:54.200 --> 2:08:58.200]  is the debt the reason what the way we pay for the debt is by monetizing it
[2:08:58.200 --> 2:09:02.600]  printing new money and they go hand in hand because we have a large debt we
[2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:06.840]  give up a lot of control and power to the Federal Reserve that we wouldn't have
[2:09:06.840 --> 2:09:10.960]  to do if we didn't run a large debt so they're two sides of the same coin in
[2:09:10.960 --> 2:09:16.000]  fact when Andrew Jackson ran and ran hard against the second bank you know he
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:21.400]  said it is the national debt is not a national blessing but a national curse
[2:09:21.400 --> 2:09:26.800]  in as much it is calculated to gather around the administration of money
[2:09:26.800 --> 2:09:32.000]  aristocracy keen and dangerous to the Republic and I think that's really
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:35.120]  important that it is the debt but it's also the Federal Reserve they're two
[2:09:35.120 --> 2:09:41.360]  sides of the same coin well really the fight against the private offshore
[2:09:41.360 --> 2:09:45.880]  central banks has been the perpetual fight since before this country was
[2:09:45.880 --> 2:09:49.520]  even born from the moment it was conceived right through the seven years
[2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:56.240]  of revolutionary conflict against the British crown until today and I guess
[2:09:56.240 --> 2:10:01.200]  they won the beachhead in 1913 and have been strangling us and using us as their
[2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:06.040]  engine for world domination ever since and I believe they've overreached now in
[2:10:06.040 --> 2:10:10.160]  their greediness to sacrifice the United States and run up our national credit
[2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:14.320]  card to fund their global operations in their own words and that they've
[2:10:14.320 --> 2:10:20.120]  overreached I mean inexorably we feel the momentum shift against them as now
[2:10:20.120 --> 2:10:23.600]  the general public knows the Federal Reserve's private they know it's above
[2:10:23.600 --> 2:10:27.760]  the law they know it's criminal and now it's not just your father getting in the
[2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:32.160]  face of Bernanke or Greenspan now it's the majority of the congressmen and
[2:10:32.160 --> 2:10:37.760]  senators now it's the pundits these guys are more and more on the run and we
[2:10:37.760 --> 2:10:43.040]  feel the momentum the pendulum shifting directions do you see that do you feel
[2:10:43.040 --> 2:10:47.000]  that dr. Paul yeah I think one of the most amazing things and one one thing
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:51.880]  we can take great solace in after this election is that the last time Bernanke
[2:10:51.880 --> 2:10:57.200]  was on with my father in the committee you can truly see fear in his eyes they
[2:10:57.200 --> 2:11:02.160]  are afraid that there will be oversight of the Federal Reserve the first major
[2:11:02.160 --> 2:11:07.200]  oversight or change in the legislation since it originated 1913 and they fear
[2:11:07.200 --> 2:11:11.320]  it you know they've hired a million dollar lobbyist the lobbyist that used to
[2:11:11.320 --> 2:11:15.280]  be the lobbyist for Enron is now going to be the lobbyist for the Fed and they
[2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:19.160]  are fearful that they are losing the momentum and there could actually be a
[2:11:19.160 --> 2:11:26.480]  real audit they're gonna pull out every stop though they're openly threatened
[2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:30.840]  Congress as you know with physical martial law last October we had the
[2:11:30.840 --> 2:11:34.200]  congressman here on air people couldn't believe it and now they're writing
[2:11:34.200 --> 2:11:38.240]  articles going yes no there will be martial law if you don't do whatever we
[2:11:38.240 --> 2:11:42.680]  say and if you ever audit the Fed there's gonna be a depression so I mean
[2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:46.840]  this is literally a gun to our head saying if you asked too many questions
[2:11:46.840 --> 2:11:52.400]  bang your economy's dead is that not financial terrorism dr. Paul well
[2:11:52.400 --> 2:11:56.600]  they're also threatening they say oh if you audit the Fed that will raise interest
[2:11:56.600 --> 2:12:01.080]  rates well looking at the numbers and transparency does nothing to the interest
[2:12:01.080 --> 2:12:04.880]  rates or even really to their policy well we want them not to have this
[2:12:04.880 --> 2:12:10.000]  expansionist policy of easy credit and easy money and low interest rates just
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:13.680]  looking at their books does nothing to change their policy so an audit is a
[2:12:13.680 --> 2:12:17.720]  good first step but they're already complaining saying an audit will
[2:12:17.720 --> 2:12:22.240]  control their monetary policy and I wish it were so but the audits only the
[2:12:22.240 --> 2:12:27.680]  first step forward but you can see how they truly fear transparency and you
[2:12:27.680 --> 2:12:31.120]  know the fact that they bought up two trillion dollars worth of assets the
[2:12:31.120 --> 2:12:35.960]  biggest thing we need to get out now though is that the debt used to be backed
[2:12:35.960 --> 2:12:40.200]  by Treasury bills with the Federal Reserve bought Treasury bills but now
[2:12:40.200 --> 2:12:45.600]  the Federal Reserve buys used car loans the Federal Reserve buys bad homeless so
[2:12:45.600 --> 2:12:48.880]  there's all kinds of things being monetized now I think I saw a statistic
[2:12:48.880 --> 2:12:54.400]  that 40% of the debt being bought now by the Federal Reserve is not Treasury
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:59.920]  but bills are true bond it is used car loans and bad home mortgages and
[2:12:59.920 --> 2:13:04.320]  derivatives and all this other crazy well that's what's scary is that they've
[2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:08.600]  made a big show of paying back a few hundred billion of the trillions that
[2:13:08.600 --> 2:13:12.400]  have disappeared into in many cases completely foreign banks not just
[2:13:12.400 --> 2:13:16.680]  offshore multinational but what they're not explaining is they're taking that
[2:13:16.680 --> 2:13:22.240]  money and fractional reserving it loaning at least 10 times out and
[2:13:22.240 --> 2:13:27.640]  leveraging it into derivatives again so it's just pumping up the bubble even
[2:13:27.640 --> 2:13:33.120]  bigger at the cost of the real economy yeah it's pretty amazing and if you look
[2:13:33.120 --> 2:13:38.480]  at the monetary base this is the banking reserves plus the currency the banking
[2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:42.520]  reserves last year doubled and that's what you're talking about that then goes
[2:13:42.520 --> 2:13:47.240]  into the banks and could be multiplied another tenfold so we double the banking
[2:13:47.240 --> 2:13:50.920]  reserves and then when it gets into the system and spreads to the economy can
[2:13:50.920 --> 2:13:57.040]  be multiplied another tenfold I think there's no question that ultimately we
[2:13:57.040 --> 2:14:01.240]  will be seeing you know rampant inflation and that's what I tell people in
[2:14:01.240 --> 2:14:05.280]  this election I tell the Republicans I say look you want someone like me who
[2:14:05.280 --> 2:14:09.760]  can directly draw the debt and say how debt hurts the working class and debt
[2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:13.680]  hurts those unfixed income because that's the Democrats usually say oh we'll
[2:14:13.680 --> 2:14:17.800]  give a handout to those people and that way we can buy their votes but I think
[2:14:17.800 --> 2:14:21.720]  we have a message to that appeals to people we say look the debt causes
[2:14:21.720 --> 2:14:27.160]  inflation high prices hurt those who are least able to afford the rising prices
[2:14:27.160 --> 2:14:31.400]  and we're gonna help you we're gonna help you not by giving you a handout we're
[2:14:31.400 --> 2:14:38.040]  gonna help you by limiting the debt and correcting inflation well dr. Paul look
[2:14:38.040 --> 2:14:42.120]  at the system these bankers create worldwide a system of dependency a
[2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:46.480]  system of bankrupting societies creating debt bubbles so big that when they
[2:14:46.480 --> 2:14:50.840]  implode it's a black hole there's no way to physically pay it back creating
[2:14:50.840 --> 2:14:56.280]  fiat currency and liquidity at many multiples above all the real resources
[2:14:56.280 --> 2:15:02.320]  and actual assets in the world and then they destroy the economy so bad their
[2:15:02.320 --> 2:15:07.520]  argument is well you've got to give 90% of your taxes to us and interest on the
[2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:11.400]  debt but we'll give you the 10% and government jobs and government contracts
[2:15:11.400 --> 2:15:16.760]  to corporations into welfare so they give us the crumbs off the table they
[2:15:16.760 --> 2:15:21.360]  that's what we've got explained to the poor people is this is a scam of the
[2:15:21.360 --> 2:15:29.160]  23.7 trillion Bloomberg and AP report they've stolen in 10 months 23 plus
[2:15:29.160 --> 2:15:33.280]  trillion you're talking about a few hundred billion of chicken feed that's
[2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:36.920]  been actually given to domestic population so this isn't even really
[2:15:36.920 --> 2:15:41.120]  socialism when Newsweek has that headline saying we're all socialists now
[2:15:41.120 --> 2:15:46.480]  isn't this more akin to fascism well exactly right and then you look at and
[2:15:46.480 --> 2:15:50.560]  one of the most galling and glaring episodes you know we gave AIG a hundred
[2:15:50.560 --> 2:15:55.640]  eighty billion dollars and then we also gave most of their you know multi
[2:15:55.640 --> 2:16:00.200]  millionaire executives we gave them retention bonuses we're doing such a
[2:16:00.200 --> 2:16:04.360]  great job with their company I think that kind of thing really galls the
[2:16:04.360 --> 2:16:09.280]  public and the interesting thing in a Republican primary is that I haven't
[2:16:09.280 --> 2:16:12.640]  seen good statistics on this but I can tell you from being out on the stump
[2:16:12.640 --> 2:16:17.440]  for three or four months 80 to 90% or more Republican primary voters are
[2:16:17.440 --> 2:16:23.040]  against the bank bailout I'll bet you 60 to 70% of Democrats are against it so
[2:16:23.040 --> 2:16:26.960]  as I go around Kentucky I say look I would have voted against this bailout
[2:16:26.960 --> 2:16:31.840]  I've been talking about it for almost a year now and you get to choose you get
[2:16:31.840 --> 2:16:36.040]  to choose a Republican to be your nominee and do you want somebody who
[2:16:36.040 --> 2:16:39.840]  voted for the bailout over half the Republican leadership did and you've
[2:16:39.840 --> 2:16:43.480]  got to decide which direction your party takes and I think the message is
[2:16:43.480 --> 2:16:47.760]  resonating I worried at first that Republicans would be upset to hear some
[2:16:47.760 --> 2:16:52.120]  chastisement of their people but I think most of them you know two-thirds of
[2:16:52.120 --> 2:16:56.760]  them were voting against McCain as their nominee so quite a few Republican are
[2:16:56.760 --> 2:17:01.000]  more conservative than what they're getting out of Washington well look at
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:05.560]  Rick Perry and other governors who are clearly globalist they've been jumping
[2:17:05.560 --> 2:17:09.320]  on the bandwagon talking about secession and fight the New World Order it's like
[2:17:09.320 --> 2:17:13.640]  they're Alex Jones or something and that's great for me because it makes me
[2:17:13.640 --> 2:17:17.400]  mainstream and suddenly all these big stations are turning us on in major
[2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:21.560]  cities because everything I've talked about now come true but really they're
[2:17:21.560 --> 2:17:26.400]  only paying lip service we need real McCoy's like Ron Paul and Rand Paul and
[2:17:26.400 --> 2:17:31.520]  others who actually have a record and who have spent their whole lives voting
[2:17:31.520 --> 2:17:38.200]  and speaking and fighting for true freedom and so now is the time for
[2:17:38.200 --> 2:17:43.120]  people to support folks like yourself what can people do now I mean obviously
[2:17:43.120 --> 2:17:47.080]  once you announce in two weeks the real momentum will kick in what can they do
[2:17:47.080 --> 2:17:51.440]  today to make sure you make that right decision to run for Senate out of
[2:17:51.440 --> 2:17:55.200]  Kentucky well I told you earlier Alex last time I was on your show your
[2:17:55.200 --> 2:17:58.440]  listeners shut down my website because they overdid it we had to buy a bigger
[2:17:58.440 --> 2:18:02.880]  server so we want your listeners to go and test out my website to see if they
[2:18:02.880 --> 2:18:09.200]  can overtax it that's Rand Paul 2010 calm the other thing they can do is we're
[2:18:09.200 --> 2:18:15.800]  taking pledges for a money bomb and that website is run randrun calm and we're
[2:18:15.800 --> 2:18:20.680]  hoping to get 10,000 people that would give a hundred dollars on one day if we
[2:18:20.680 --> 2:18:26.200]  raise a million dollars in one day which I think it's possible if we did that it
[2:18:26.200 --> 2:18:31.720]  completely transforms my race it completely makes us really the lead
[2:18:31.720 --> 2:18:36.560]  dog in the race and makes us the one to beat it puts us on the map for the rest
[2:18:36.560 --> 2:18:40.000]  of the election we don't have to struggle month in and month out to see if
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:43.760]  they'll still include us because of our fundraising we get all that front end
[2:18:43.760 --> 2:18:48.520]  loaded on August absolutely and then what we could do and then that makes the
[2:18:48.520 --> 2:18:53.000]  media say oh Rand Paul would be great and his dad's you know really popular but
[2:18:53.000 --> 2:18:57.240]  he can't raise that type of money that makes you a major contender and makes
[2:18:57.240 --> 2:19:01.840]  Kentucky media pay attention to you and then it's a multiplier you get a million
[2:19:01.840 --> 2:19:06.400]  bucks you get 20 million and free coverage in Kentucky exactly and we're
[2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:10.680]  already getting good coverage here I've had nothing but good coverage so far we
[2:19:10.680 --> 2:19:15.520]  probably had 10 AP stories I've been on television I've been on national
[2:19:15.520 --> 2:19:19.720]  television twice we're getting good coverage here every time we do something
[2:19:19.720 --> 2:19:23.240]  we have a conference call for the media and we're routinely getting between 10
[2:19:23.240 --> 2:19:28.280]  and 15 people on our conference calls for statewide media so there's a lot
[2:19:28.280 --> 2:19:32.960]  going on but you're right the key thing that puts me over the top is if that
[2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:36.760]  money bombs successful August 20th well we'll be sure and have Lyman on

[2:20:08.920 --> 2:20:12.520]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or
[2:20:12.520 --> 2:20:15.880]  gold it's true seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this
[2:20:15.880 --> 2:20:19.680]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at

[2:24:59.920 --> 2:25:04.560]  site at one time to really be effective but going back to Dr. Rand Paul that's
[2:25:04.560 --> 2:25:09.440]  exciting though the audience has crashed your server though that is that's a good
[2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:16.960]  that's better than a Nielsen poll I think listen there's so much I could
[2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:21.000]  throw up but I want to get into investigating the Fed you know your
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:23.720]  father's called for criminal investigations by state grand juries
[2:25:23.720 --> 2:25:27.920]  saying that's constitutional what about investigating Al Gore who openly owns
[2:25:27.920 --> 2:25:33.400]  the controlling stock in two of the carbon trading companies and the bill
[2:25:33.400 --> 2:25:38.400]  they've passed in the house says that the federal agencies can just levy any
[2:25:38.400 --> 2:25:43.240]  tax they want including toilet paper taxes what would you do about that my
[2:25:43.240 --> 2:25:48.280]  prediction is is that if cap and trade gets through we will have an army of
[2:25:48.280 --> 2:25:53.560]  armed EPA agents thousands of them and apparently they've already said that
[2:25:53.560 --> 2:25:57.320]  that's what I mean the EPA already has well armed guards as they have armed
[2:25:57.320 --> 2:26:01.400]  troopers and investigators now they call them climate cops no it's a I mean
[2:26:01.400 --> 2:26:04.640]  your predictions already true yeah that's what I mean we have them but I
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:08.960]  predict that there will be thousands of new because of new yes yes because you
[2:26:08.960 --> 2:26:12.320]  know what's gonna happen is every time you still your house or rent your
[2:26:12.320 --> 2:26:15.880]  apartment you're going to have to prove to somebody that you've got energy
[2:26:15.880 --> 2:26:20.600]  efficient no that's in the bill they say home inspections I'm sorry go ahead I
[2:26:20.600 --> 2:26:24.160]  mean I start ranting on this issue yeah you're exactly right we debated it
[2:26:24.160 --> 2:26:28.200]  recently I spoke before the coal producing counties and that's about 30
[2:26:28.200 --> 2:26:33.720]  counties in Kentucky and I debated the main Democrat opponent Jack Conway and
[2:26:33.720 --> 2:26:38.320]  Jack Conway got up there like so many career politicians he got up there and
[2:26:38.320 --> 2:26:43.200]  said well I'm not really sure if I'm a against cap and trade or if I'm for it
[2:26:43.200 --> 2:26:47.160]  but I want to be part of the negotiated legislation so I'm not going to take a
[2:26:47.160 --> 2:26:52.680]  real position on it until after I'm elected and what's amazing about this
[2:26:52.680 --> 2:26:56.280]  is he doesn't even sense being a career politician he's afraid to make a stand
[2:26:56.280 --> 2:27:01.440]  but he doesn't even sense how much there's opposition even among mainstream
[2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:05.000]  people within Kentucky because of what it's going to do to energy well they
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:11.720]  admit they're gonna put in the bill a 50% tax on all coal and and what 54% of
[2:27:11.720 --> 2:27:17.760]  all our energy our power from factories to light bulbs in our houses to the hot
[2:27:17.760 --> 2:27:22.520]  water heaters is from coal I mean does anybody have an idea what that I got
[2:27:22.520 --> 2:27:27.760]  family in East Texas the only jobs left are prisons and and and and coal mines
[2:27:27.760 --> 2:27:32.280]  and the power plants that burn it right and I think once again it's like
[2:27:32.280 --> 2:27:41.800]  inflation we have mostly hurt and will hurt disproportionately when your
[2:27:41.800 --> 2:27:45.400]  electric bill goes up at the end of the month if you make $200,000 a year you
[2:27:45.400 --> 2:27:49.640]  don't feel it but if you make $25,000 a year and your electric bill goes up you
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:53.400]  get hurt and that's what's gonna happen to cap and trade like any other price
[2:27:53.400 --> 2:27:58.280]  increase it disproportionately hurts the working class and the poor and those
[2:27:58.280 --> 2:28:02.320]  on fixed income the retired folks all the same constituencies that the
[2:28:02.320 --> 2:28:05.960]  Democrats are always going out and winning those votes that's why we tell
[2:28:05.960 --> 2:28:10.440]  people our message is good we need to know how to present our message to gain
[2:28:10.440 --> 2:28:16.120]  more votes well well I mean dr. Paul when you've studied politics for a long
[2:28:16.120 --> 2:28:19.640]  time your dad's been a congressman for decades here's medical doctor your smart
[2:28:19.640 --> 2:28:24.760]  guy looking at Obama's record did in your bug does he take the cake for lying
[2:28:24.760 --> 2:28:29.120]  I mean everything he says he's gone back on and then he said he wouldn't raise
[2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:33.880]  taxes unless you made a quarter million dollars a year as a couple these
[2:28:33.880 --> 2:28:38.120]  carbon taxes are gonna raise taxes on everything and like you just said hurt
[2:28:38.120 --> 2:28:42.240]  the poorest people with amazing thing is he can do it with a straight face as
[2:28:42.240 --> 2:28:45.400]  long as his teleprompter is working he can do it with a straight face and a
[2:28:45.400 --> 2:28:49.800]  smile and he can tell us how he's not going to do something at the same time
[2:28:49.800 --> 2:28:55.560]  his other hand is actually doing it so I guess it's just the amazing gall of
[2:28:55.560 --> 2:28:59.800]  politicians who tell us this and tell us they're not going to do something and
[2:28:59.800 --> 2:29:05.560]  meanwhile they're doing exactly that I think it's an amazing beat how far we
[2:29:05.560 --> 2:29:08.840]  are going to lurch to the left and how big government's gonna grow in the first
[2:29:08.840 --> 2:29:12.480]  six months to a year but I think there'll be a backlash and the only good
[2:29:12.480 --> 2:29:17.760]  thing I think we have going for us is there will be a backlash in 2010 and in
[2:29:17.760 --> 2:29:22.480]  my own particular race I think Kentucky will be ripe to run against Obama
[2:29:22.480 --> 2:29:26.880]  because he did very poorly in the Democrat primary here against Hillary
[2:29:26.880 --> 2:29:31.680]  Clinton she clobbered him by 30 points and then even McCain who didn't do that
[2:29:31.680 --> 2:29:36.320]  well and ran a lackluster campaign he also killed Obama in Kentucky so
[2:29:36.320 --> 2:29:40.880]  Kentucky is sort of a split state but also a state that really doesn't like
[2:29:40.880 --> 2:29:45.320]  far left-wing politics oh yeah well I mean look you're right there's gonna be
[2:29:45.320 --> 2:29:49.560]  an explosive backlash it's gonna catapult you into the US senator in
[2:29:49.560 --> 2:29:56.720]  election fraud we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[2:31:20.920 --> 2:31:24.880]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:31:24.880 --> 2:31:28.480]  overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four
[2:31:28.480 --> 2:31:32.000]  the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year

[2:34:06.600 --> 2:34:10.880]  invent them are you going to aggressively go after the globalist because I
[2:34:10.880 --> 2:34:14.720]  believe the best defense is a good offense not just fighting their programs
[2:34:14.720 --> 2:34:17.960]  but going after them for their crimes do you agree with your father that we need
[2:34:17.960 --> 2:34:22.160]  criminal investigations of the Federal Reserve yes I think we go after the
[2:34:22.160 --> 2:34:26.320]  specifics and in some ways the media might light up more and they have
[2:34:26.320 --> 2:34:30.600]  recently lit up thinking the Goldman Sachs and Paulson may have been doing
[2:34:30.600 --> 2:34:35.880]  something to enrich themselves so I think if we can paint it and expose it
[2:34:35.880 --> 2:34:40.200]  as people personally becoming wealthy off of the system and not let them get
[2:34:40.200 --> 2:34:43.800]  away with the fact that they say oh the feds independent and has our best
[2:34:43.800 --> 2:34:47.680]  interest at heart if we can show specifically where individuals are
[2:34:47.680 --> 2:34:52.280]  benefiting by government policy that then hurts the rest of us absolutely I
[2:34:52.280 --> 2:34:55.800]  think we should do that well I saw a video that we have time will play later
[2:34:55.800 --> 2:35:00.760]  it's put up on info wars dot com for a couple days of Paulson being questioned
[2:35:00.760 --> 2:35:05.560]  by House members and admitting he personally got $200 million off of
[2:35:05.560 --> 2:35:09.640]  money he transferred and saying that's not a conflict of interest because a
[2:35:09.640 --> 2:35:14.400]  White House ethics office signed off on it I mean this is really getting sick
[2:35:14.400 --> 2:35:18.480]  well you know you remember Paulson's first bill for the tarp act it was like
[2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:23.080]  three paragraphs just saying a point me king and let me do whatever I want with
[2:35:23.080 --> 2:35:28.080]  the money system and you know they shot that down but then they made it 1,100
[2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:33.280]  pages of obscure legal ease and we got probably just as bad or worse now the
[2:35:33.280 --> 2:35:37.000]  tarp act is used for the car bailout I even saw the other day that the
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:42.640]  minority broadcasters are going to try to get money from the tarp act oh it's
[2:35:42.640 --> 2:35:47.760]  it's just amazing they're they're raising I saw in New York State 84 taxes
[2:35:47.760 --> 2:35:51.760]  they've passed all these other states are passing new taxes here in
[2:35:51.760 --> 2:35:56.080]  conservative Texas every month I have new taxing authorities knocking on my
[2:35:56.080 --> 2:36:00.760]  door telling me that they're going to come in and assess me how much can the
[2:36:00.760 --> 2:36:05.160]  public put up with I saw a report that in Texas and I've seen other states 10
[2:36:05.160 --> 2:36:09.840]  percent or more of the public have warrants out for unpaid tickets I mean
[2:36:09.840 --> 2:36:13.960]  are they just going to squeeze us to like the sheriff of Nottingham well I
[2:36:13.960 --> 2:36:17.480]  saw the other day they're going after a woman in Pennsylvania for not paying her
[2:36:17.480 --> 2:36:21.080]  cigarette tax she's been ordering her cigarettes online for a couple years and
[2:36:21.080 --> 2:36:26.000]  they put a lien against her house not so funny but you know they're aggressive
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:29.640]  and they will do it I think there has to be a breaking point taxes eventually get
[2:36:29.640 --> 2:36:34.360]  so high that I think there will be a breaking point I think for example on
[2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:37.760]  cigarettes we've probably gotten high enough that people there is going to be
[2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:40.800]  there probably already is but there will be even a bigger black market
[2:36:40.800 --> 2:36:44.320]  probably for cigarettes people will eventually avoid the government taxes
[2:36:44.320 --> 2:36:49.600]  completely because the prices will be getting become so high it's just
[2:36:49.600 --> 2:36:56.400]  incredible if the Senate passes more of a reason to have you in the US Senate
[2:36:56.400 --> 2:37:00.960]  passes the cap and trade I was reading actual bill that they kept 300 pages
[2:37:00.960 --> 2:37:04.960]  secret of the letter to pass as you know doctor Rand Paul running for Senate
[2:37:04.960 --> 2:37:09.880]  Kentucky joining us we're about to announce running for Senate hopefully if
[2:37:09.880 --> 2:37:13.440]  they were able to get that through it just gives this executive power kind of
[2:37:13.440 --> 2:37:16.960]  like Paulson saying make me God they have gun bills that just say the attorney
[2:37:16.960 --> 2:37:22.320]  general can ban any guns he wants or he can put you on a no fly no gun byless it
[2:37:22.320 --> 2:37:27.600]  seems the federal government is moving to this imperial model well and it's
[2:37:27.600 --> 2:37:31.720]  always lost in thousands of pages of legal ease for example in the health
[2:37:31.720 --> 2:37:36.160]  care act they've named the health care act something like the free choice
[2:37:36.160 --> 2:37:41.680]  health reform act of 2009 but you know what the more friendly it sounds in the
[2:37:41.680 --> 2:37:45.640]  title the more ominous it is if you read the nitty-gritty in that health care
[2:37:45.640 --> 2:37:50.520]  act there's actually part of it says that when you leave your company or change
[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:54.280]  insurance policies you'll only be able to buy insurance that's approved by the
[2:37:54.280 --> 2:37:57.440]  government and they already have the restrictions in there are what you can
[2:37:57.440 --> 2:38:01.000]  sell and I think things like health savings account which are part of the
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:05.160]  solution to our problems will probably not be sold after this health care
[2:38:05.160 --> 2:38:09.760]  reform act incredible I want to take a few final calls people should certainly
[2:38:09.760 --> 2:38:15.520]  visit the website that we have up on screen at prison planet dot TV they
[2:38:15.520 --> 2:38:21.920]  should get ready for the money bomb that is coming up as well Rand Paul 2010
[2:38:21.920 --> 2:38:28.040]  dot com Rand Paul 2010 dot com we've got links up on info wars calm and prison
[2:38:28.040 --> 2:38:33.200]  planet dot TV but you made a joke during the break that you wouldn't let the
[2:38:33.200 --> 2:38:36.040]  Bilderberg group if you get elected to the Senate drag you off to a secret
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:41.920]  meeting but if you were there joking that you would certainly wave at me while
[2:38:41.920 --> 2:38:47.840]  I was a bullhorning from the outside elected to the Senate if you get elected
[2:38:47.840 --> 2:38:51.080]  to the Senate what are you going to do when these people approach you are you
[2:38:51.080 --> 2:38:54.280]  going to blow the whistle on well I have to correct you a little bit on Alex
[2:38:54.280 --> 2:38:57.480]  what I said is I wouldn't join the Bilderbergers you know for philosophic
[2:38:57.480 --> 2:39:01.920]  reasons but the other reason I wouldn't join us because I'd be afraid Alex Jones
[2:39:01.920 --> 2:39:06.200]  would be outside the meeting with the bullhorn calling me out so absolutely I
[2:39:06.200 --> 2:39:09.720]  wouldn't but I've all I've seen your videos calling a few of them out and
[2:39:09.720 --> 2:39:13.520]  interviewing a few of them and for some reason they get quite testy with you if
[2:39:13.520 --> 2:39:17.680]  you ask them questions about it they they certainly did no you refreshed my
[2:39:17.680 --> 2:39:20.720]  memory we were coming into break the music was already playing and we were a
[2:39:20.720 --> 2:39:24.360]  bantering and laughing back and forth and I meant to say I hope that you would
[2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:29.760]  go to Bilderberg and then come out and expose them okay yeah I don't know if
[2:39:29.760 --> 2:39:33.440]  that would be possible or not but yeah I think we should expose people who are
[2:39:33.440 --> 2:39:39.120]  you know promoting this globalist agenda for personal gain and for financial
[2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:42.720]  gain at the expense of the rest of our country and at the expense of our
[2:39:42.720 --> 2:39:46.440]  Republic well we're gonna go to calls in a moment but I want to just say this now
[2:39:46.440 --> 2:39:51.560]  here before you run for Senate before you win or certainly give them one hell
[2:39:51.560 --> 2:39:57.560]  of a run that people need to support you from the start to the middle to the
[2:39:57.560 --> 2:40:03.040]  finish and then after because it is quite a load to take running for office
[2:40:03.040 --> 2:40:08.040]  and to really try to win to put your private life in the crosshairs I know a
[2:40:08.040 --> 2:40:12.440]  lot of people that know your family well I've known your dad for 13 years very
[2:40:12.440 --> 2:40:19.200]  upright incredibly hard work ethic good Christian people interviewed your uncle
[2:40:19.200 --> 2:40:22.880]  Wayne Paul last week and another amazing individual fighting for liberty and
[2:40:22.880 --> 2:40:26.160]  freedom but people need to understand they're gonna manufacture stuff about
[2:40:26.160 --> 2:40:30.000]  you they're gonna lie about you they're gonna take things out of context out
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:34.600]  about you and people don't need to nitty they need to just get behind you guys
[2:40:34.600 --> 2:40:39.880]  and move forward because we'd be in a lot worse position today of Ron Paul
[2:40:39.880 --> 2:40:45.480]  hadn't have run and educated millions of people about the true nature of the
[2:40:45.480 --> 2:40:50.320]  political and economic system and I just want to get your take on this here
[2:40:50.320 --> 2:40:56.640]  now look at how it did backfire though when in for the movie Bruno Sasha Baron
[2:40:56.640 --> 2:40:59.640]  Cohen I didn't cover this when it first came out until your dad had commented on
[2:40:59.640 --> 2:41:03.840]  it that you know they've got a interview going they say the light breaks they say
[2:41:03.840 --> 2:41:07.360]  please step in here and he pulls his pants down and you know basically tries
[2:41:07.360 --> 2:41:11.480]  to block the door and then the media tried to spin it like Ron Paul you know
[2:41:11.480 --> 2:41:15.200]  caught in a bad position and then it came out that they called him in a room
[2:41:15.200 --> 2:41:19.400]  corner demon really almost tried to sexually assault him that was done on
[2:41:19.400 --> 2:41:23.920]  purpose Sasha Baron Cohen is a globalist and I it's not just funny and
[2:41:23.920 --> 2:41:27.000]  though it's the number one movie right now I just want to bring that up and
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:30.880]  warn people that they mean business and are going to try dirty tricks but that
[2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:35.240]  did end up blowing up in their face but can you comment on that and then comment
[2:41:35.240 --> 2:41:39.880]  overall on gutting up to do this but also that people need to be ready for
[2:41:39.880 --> 2:41:44.320]  all sorts of chicanery well the thing about that movie that really sort of
[2:41:44.320 --> 2:41:48.600]  makes me mad is that my dad gives so much of his time he is an upright man
[2:41:48.600 --> 2:41:52.320]  he's been married for 50 years he doesn't need and he doesn't deserve that
[2:41:52.320 --> 2:41:57.000]  kind of behavior by somebody that really is almost like an assault I mean it
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:42:02.360]  really I think is so so beneath what we should have to deal with in public
[2:42:02.360 --> 2:42:06.200]  discourse the other thing is is while I'm not much for lawsuits there was a
[2:42:06.200 --> 2:42:11.600]  woman that he shocked it did something shocking to the actor did at like a PTA
[2:42:11.600 --> 2:42:16.440]  meeting or a church social and she fell and hit her head and had a bleed and a
[2:42:16.440 --> 2:42:21.000]  stroke and she is doing it but I say Godspeed I hope she gets a bunch of
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:25.760]  money out of that guy because it really is unfair to misrepresent yourself and
[2:42:25.760 --> 2:42:30.200]  well it's also sorry go ahead go ahead I just think unfair to misrepresent people
[2:42:30.200 --> 2:42:34.400]  and to come in and do that and it's this whole shocking thing but it it's kind of
[2:42:34.400 --> 2:42:38.520]  what's made our country go downhill I think culturally and other people that
[2:42:38.520 --> 2:42:43.840]  we have such trash on TV such trash in the movies and you know the more we get
[2:42:43.840 --> 2:42:49.080]  it of it it endures us that it makes us think that you know that stuff is okay
[2:42:49.080 --> 2:42:52.800]  because it's all over TV in the movies and so there were you know the moral
[2:42:52.800 --> 2:42:58.280]  standard gets lower and lower well it's also very dangerous we're showing some
[2:42:58.280 --> 2:43:00.680]  of the video here where they're doing the interview and the light breaks and
[2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:04.720]  they ask him to step into a room and then that's what my wife called it my wife
[2:43:04.720 --> 2:43:08.480]  is a woman got very upset saying if that had been a woman he'd have probably
[2:43:08.480 --> 2:43:12.800]  gone to jail I mean getting somebody in a room and then sexually advancing on
[2:43:12.800 --> 2:43:15.960]  them and your father basically shoves him out of the way and screams at him and
[2:43:15.960 --> 2:43:22.480]  runs out of the room yeah sort of a double standard I think really there
[2:43:22.480 --> 2:43:26.880]  should be some kind of you know assault charge press but the problem is with
[2:43:26.880 --> 2:43:31.840]  politicians is none of these things hold up in court and we don't really have
[2:43:31.840 --> 2:43:35.960]  much for defamation in our country either they end up you know if any of the
[2:43:35.960 --> 2:43:39.120]  Hollywood actors are ever defamed or accused of something they didn't do
[2:43:39.120 --> 2:43:42.200]  they go and sue them in England because in England apparently you can win
[2:43:42.200 --> 2:43:46.720]  defamation so here I guess there's just not much recourse but you were talking
[2:43:46.720 --> 2:43:49.720]  about winning and one of the amazing thing is because you hear people back
[2:43:49.720 --> 2:43:53.560]  and forth on my dad's campaign you know he didn't win you know in many ways he
[2:43:53.560 --> 2:43:57.880]  did win because I look at it every time I see him on the television now I say
[2:43:57.880 --> 2:44:02.200]  we've got somebody that represents our point of view who is getting some
[2:44:02.200 --> 2:44:05.760]  attention we aren't yet winning the battles who were at least included in
[2:44:05.760 --> 2:44:12.440]  the debate before he ran in 2007 2008 our side other than you Alex and some of
[2:44:12.440 --> 2:44:16.240]  the people that on talk radio we really weren't getting a fair shake or getting
[2:44:16.240 --> 2:44:22.920]  any kind of representation as far as part of the debate and now we are well
[2:44:22.920 --> 2:44:28.440]  I've never really talked about the Sasha bear a Conan situation here much the
[2:44:28.440 --> 2:44:31.800]  reason I brought it up to you dr. Paul is because I think you need to be ready
[2:44:31.800 --> 2:44:36.320]  for these type of setups and I think well I mean we know the Federal Reserve
[2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:39.160]  means business and we know the Federal Reserve was clearly implicated in
[2:44:39.160 --> 2:44:44.120]  kidnapping a congressman's baby we know that they've done hit pieces on folks
[2:44:44.120 --> 2:44:48.240]  this is the global ruling elite I just wanted to commend you for your courage
[2:44:48.240 --> 2:44:53.560]  your father's courage and also wanted listeners to know that once we commit to
[2:44:53.560 --> 2:44:57.720]  supporting you we're committed this is a war and that's it and I'm asking my
[2:44:57.720 --> 2:45:01.560]  listeners to fully commit to you and your father and the work they've been
[2:45:01.560 --> 2:45:07.640]  doing I appreciate that and we can't do it without you and I was involved in the
[2:45:07.640 --> 2:45:11.840]  grassroots part of the campaign across the United States my father I met a lot
[2:45:11.840 --> 2:45:15.960]  of the grassroots supporters and if there's anything we can do we're really
[2:45:15.960 --> 2:45:20.120]  going to try to include the grassroots in this we've already had students I'm
[2:45:20.120 --> 2:45:22.920]  gonna meet some students on Saturday night who traveled here some of them
[2:45:22.920 --> 2:45:27.760]  from Idaho California and Indiana and various states that are already
[2:45:27.760 --> 2:45:31.560]  campaigning for me here in the state so well we're gonna do what we can and
[2:45:31.560 --> 2:45:35.640]  anything that your listeners or the grassroots do for us we will be very
[2:45:35.640 --> 2:45:40.800]  much appreciative absolutely well we just appreciate you and all the great
[2:45:40.800 --> 2:45:44.000]  work you've done dr. Rand Paul and again the website for folks that want to
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:49.680]  visit it is run ran run.com is the money bomb site and then his
[2:45:49.680 --> 2:45:56.040]  official site is Rand Paul 2010.com and it is up right now so that's good
[2:45:56.040 --> 2:46:00.200]  servers are testing out nicely there we'll take a few calls and then we're
[2:46:00.200 --> 2:46:05.040]  gonna end this official interview with dr. Paul here in just about five minutes
[2:46:05.040 --> 2:46:09.400]  Matt in Ohio then Mike in Sweden Michael and Mass that'll be the three calls we
[2:46:09.400 --> 2:46:13.880]  have time for Matt you're on the air with dr. Rand Paul hello I appreciate you
[2:46:13.880 --> 2:46:20.760]  taking my call but I wanted to say thank you dr. Paul for you know or
[2:46:20.760 --> 2:46:25.160]  hopefully choosing to run for the Senate I think you definitely stand up for
[2:46:25.160 --> 2:46:29.800]  every person in the country who you know honors individualism and honors the
[2:46:29.800 --> 2:46:33.800]  Constitution when you do that because there certainly aren't many alternatives
[2:46:33.800 --> 2:46:39.600]  you know who are running for office who do represent those values. My question
[2:46:39.600 --> 2:46:44.800]  is regarding the Federal Reserve do you what do you think the odds are that the
[2:46:44.800 --> 2:46:51.800]  Federal Reserve made bankrupt itself by the activities and in buying up all
[2:46:51.800 --> 2:46:56.440]  these you know toxic assets these CDS's and car companies and whatnot similar to
[2:46:56.440 --> 2:47:00.920]  the way it bankrupted itself in the 30s or at least allegedly did I don't know
[2:47:00.920 --> 2:47:05.360]  that that was ever made public and the you know the fact that you know the
[2:47:05.360 --> 2:47:10.160]  response back then was you know to make owning gold illegal collect gold in
[2:47:10.160 --> 2:47:15.280]  order to shore up the Federal Reserve. What's your question sir? Do you what are
[2:47:15.280 --> 2:47:17.400]  the odds that that would happen again and what do you think would be the
[2:47:17.400 --> 2:47:22.280]  response that you know by the nation this time. Yeah what are what's gonna
[2:47:22.280 --> 2:47:26.200]  happen if they try to ban the gold give us paper back and then double the price
[2:47:26.200 --> 2:47:29.480]  a year later are Americans gonna put up with that I mean most people didn't
[2:47:29.480 --> 2:47:33.640]  turn it in back then. Right I don't think the Federal Reserve really will go
[2:47:33.640 --> 2:47:37.880]  bankrupt because they basically control the money so what happens is we get
[2:47:37.880 --> 2:47:41.560]  bankruptcy in another form they liquidate the debt by printing up so much
[2:47:41.560 --> 2:47:45.760]  money that they pay back the debt with cheap money. Yeah that's it. So that's
[2:47:45.760 --> 2:47:50.000]  what's going to happen is the real danger is not a bankrupt to the Federal
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:54.400]  Reserve the danger is I think a runaway inflation where the money becomes
[2:47:54.400 --> 2:47:59.920]  worthless I fear more a time like the Weimar Republic in 1923 where the
[2:47:59.920 --> 2:48:03.760]  Germans carried their money around in wheelbarrows the workers were paid
[2:48:03.760 --> 2:48:08.160]  twice a day because by between noon and five o'clock the money lost half its
[2:48:08.160 --> 2:48:12.240]  value that's the kind of situation I fear and the unrest and the civil
[2:48:12.240 --> 2:48:15.760]  disorder that comes with destroying the money whether or not people will give up
[2:48:15.760 --> 2:48:19.320]  their gold I think people will give up their gold about as likely as they will
[2:48:19.320 --> 2:48:22.960]  be to give up their guns anymore and I think that's the one good thing we have
[2:48:22.960 --> 2:48:26.920]  going on in America there's a lot of still independent spirit in the
[2:48:26.920 --> 2:48:31.800]  countryside we don't necessarily see it from our politicians but there's a lot
[2:48:31.800 --> 2:48:35.640]  of independent spirit out there that's not going to give up easily. Well
[2:48:35.640 --> 2:48:40.560]  speaking of lying they've introduced scores of bills the most draconian
[2:48:40.560 --> 2:48:44.960]  anti-second amendment ever and then they get up on the news and say it's all a
[2:48:44.960 --> 2:48:50.560]  conspiracy theory stop buying guns at record levels stop buying ammo I mean how
[2:48:50.560 --> 2:48:55.880]  dumb do the Democratic Party think we are I mean this is insane and so do my
[2:48:55.880 --> 2:49:01.680]  or wrote a book saying we have no right and they're about to confirm her I mean
[2:49:01.680 --> 2:49:05.560]  don't the Democrats in the establishment understand that this will start a
[2:49:05.560 --> 2:49:10.960]  shooting war yep I all you have to do is the show up at the machine gun shoot
[2:49:10.960 --> 2:49:16.960]  out in Nob Creek. Nob Creek I was there earlier this year 3,000 people came that
[2:49:16.960 --> 2:49:20.800]  day and those are 3,000 people that aren't giving up their guns and ammo too

[2:49:50.720 --> 2:49:53.800]  listeners and I run into some that are pro-globalist but I don't know that much
[2:49:53.800 --> 2:49:59.800]  about it kind of a strange question for our guest familiar with it yeah we're
[2:49:59.800 --> 2:50:04.960]  unfamiliar would you like to tell us about it yeah it says on Wikipedia that
[2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:11.080]  the system that they envision for the future involves a world parliament a
[2:50:11.080 --> 2:50:17.920]  world police force a binding world tribunal and universal bill of human
[2:50:17.920 --> 2:50:21.880]  rights and so forth I think well I know a lot of religions are pushing that in

[2:54:24.920 --> 2:54:32.760]  mass with a dr. Rand Paul website Rand Paul 2010.com or runrandrun.com for the
[2:54:32.760 --> 2:54:37.880]  the money bomb coming up in the 20th of next month we'll have him back on maybe
[2:54:37.880 --> 2:54:42.200]  even his dad on Ron Paul's on next week my producer got the hours wrong so he's
[2:54:42.200 --> 2:54:47.520]  on with this doctor Ron Paul the father of Rand Paul's on next week for us for
[2:54:47.520 --> 2:54:51.440]  30 minutes talk about a host of issues Rand I was asking you about John P.
[2:54:51.440 --> 2:54:55.120]  Holdren the science are you said you'd heard about it in the news but not the
[2:54:55.120 --> 2:54:59.440]  details but generally the social planners admit they want socialized
[2:54:59.440 --> 2:55:05.040]  health care they want carbon tax he says to carry out eugenics and even the
[2:55:05.040 --> 2:55:09.560]  forced drugging of the water to sterilize us that sounds like Nazi Germany to me
[2:55:09.560 --> 2:55:13.840]  what would you do in the Senate about this well if I were there we get to
[2:55:13.840 --> 2:55:17.560]  expose it before he's gotten a hearing or during the hearing these hearings
[2:55:17.560 --> 2:55:21.120]  that's what exactly what they're for and wouldn't it be great to have a voice in
[2:55:21.120 --> 2:55:26.520]  the Senate because it could expose this before he gets approved dr. Paul do you
[2:55:26.520 --> 2:55:29.120]  think the new rule order is going to succeed I mean we're really seeing an
[2:55:29.120 --> 2:55:32.120]  awakening happening right now that we couldn't have imagined years ago but
[2:55:32.120 --> 2:55:37.040]  is it going to be enough well I think when you go back you know one way to look
[2:55:37.040 --> 2:55:40.840]  at it is probably 30 years ago nobody thought there'd be one currency in
[2:55:40.840 --> 2:55:45.000]  Europe right now most people don't think there could be one currency in our
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:49.320]  country and yet the talk of the Amaro is out there and they poo-foo it they
[2:55:49.320 --> 2:55:54.000]  tried to describe us as crazier off the wall but they are talking about it and
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:55:58.600]  I think their way of getting to most things is gradualism although I think
[2:55:58.600 --> 2:56:03.200]  Obama's doing a sudden move forward on a lot of things yeah I think there's a
[2:56:03.200 --> 2:56:06.800]  huge danger of it and I think the problem is is that we have so many
[2:56:06.800 --> 2:56:11.040]  politicians on both sides that are these career politicians and the ones that
[2:56:11.040 --> 2:56:15.520]  evolve to the top of the Republican and the Democrat Party end up being the
[2:56:15.520 --> 2:56:19.000]  people who don't believe in anything who really don't have any ideology
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:23.760]  and they get crap pushed around by the New World Order type the sellouts the
[2:56:23.760 --> 2:56:31.640]  social climbers exactly what in in in 60 seconds what can everybody do to make
[2:56:31.640 --> 2:56:36.280]  sure you run for Senate you win for Senate if you can go to our website and
[2:56:36.280 --> 2:56:40.960]  if you can also pledge for the money bomb we will turn this race completely
[2:56:40.960 --> 2:56:44.920]  upside down if we raise a million dollars on August 20th there's no
[2:56:44.920 --> 2:56:51.600]  stopping us we will have a odds on even chance of winning our race if we raise a
[2:56:51.600 --> 2:56:56.000]  million in one day it'll be a national story it'll be a statewide story it will
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:56:59.560]  be all over the press if we raise a million dollars in one day and the
[2:56:59.560 --> 2:57:03.520]  media loves to criticize you guys trying to raise money how dare them the
[2:57:03.520 --> 2:57:07.920]  globalist take our money use it against us you're asking for it if you want
[2:57:07.920 --> 2:57:12.480]  somebody in Washington to stop the thieving stop the gang raping quickly
[2:57:12.480 --> 2:57:15.920]  Michael and mash you got time for a 30-second question go ahead Michael
[2:57:15.920 --> 2:57:20.320]  dr. Paul got a good question but I want to tell you right off the bat I got 150
[2:57:20.320 --> 2:57:24.360]  bucks your name on it buddy all right all right all right I wanted to talk
[2:57:24.360 --> 2:57:27.720]  about perception I asked your father about this before on the Jones show it
[2:57:27.720 --> 2:57:31.400]  seems to me that the main problem that the American people have with the New
[2:57:31.400 --> 2:57:35.960]  World Order globalism and in general is they don't have an accurate perception
[2:57:35.960 --> 2:57:41.480]  of what is going on here have you ever read things like the effect of science
[2:57:41.480 --> 2:57:45.480]  on society you know those type of weird psychology books that were written by a
[2:57:45.480 --> 2:57:50.040]  like Skinner yeah written by the scientific dictators I have read that
[2:57:50.040 --> 2:57:56.480]  that's why I understand their attack profile but dr. Paul are you aware of
[2:57:56.480 --> 2:58:01.000]  the psychological warfare systems they're using yes I am I have not read
[2:58:01.000 --> 2:58:08.680]  that book the effect of science caller yeah I just was I was just hoping you
[2:58:08.680 --> 2:58:13.280]  could perhaps before you make this run educate yourself specifically on that
[2:58:13.280 --> 2:58:17.280]  because it's these techniques that are going to be used against you and if you
[2:58:17.280 --> 2:58:22.280]  understand it it will be you know they just won't work well he's a smart guy
[2:58:22.280 --> 2:58:25.920]  yeah and he's got guts and the Constitution Bill writes and that's
[2:58:25.920 --> 2:58:30.560]  enough we're behind him dr. Rand Paul will have you back on right before the
[2:58:30.560 --> 2:58:34.320]  money bomb we'll have your dad talk about it as well God bless you God's

[2:59:02.560 --> 2:59:06.360]  chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water many of these
[2:59:06.360 --> 2:59:10.200]  chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental
[2:59:10.200 --> 2:59:14.800]  system diseases now what are you going to do about it the Akola blue atmospheric

[3:00:01.240 --> 3:00:23.280]  all right ladies and gentlemen coming up in about 20 minutes we're gonna look
[3:00:23.280 --> 3:00:27.880]  again at the new developments new government documents about the OSSCIA
[3:00:27.880 --> 3:00:32.760]  killing patent and why just give me an idea how ruthless these people are but
[3:00:32.760 --> 3:00:37.360]  I've got some other issues I want to get into right now
[3:00:37.360 --> 3:00:43.080]  Horton M.O. wrote a great story yesterday at info wars.com titled J. Rockefeller
[3:00:43.080 --> 3:00:49.080]  can't deny his connection to modern eugenics the headline could have been
[3:00:49.080 --> 3:00:54.760]  J. Rockefeller confronted on eugenics now it is a fact it is in the encyclopedia
[3:00:54.760 --> 3:00:59.560]  it is mainline history any book you get on the history of eugenics will tell you
[3:00:59.560 --> 3:01:03.680]  the Rockefellers took the idea from England funded it in Germany England the
[3:01:03.680 --> 3:01:10.280]  US millions and millions of dollars in 1900 money the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
[3:01:10.280 --> 3:01:15.520]  all of them Cold Springs Harbor USA they're behind it today just a month ago
[3:01:15.520 --> 3:01:19.960]  it was in the news secret meeting of the rich at Rockefeller University calling
[3:01:19.960 --> 3:01:24.600]  for world population reduction IBM they funded the creation of IBM in the hall
[3:01:24.600 --> 3:01:31.560]  with machines and all of it so senator J. Rockefeller this horrible demon who
[3:01:31.560 --> 3:01:35.120]  openly wants to restrict free speech on the internet the rest of it there's a

[3:08:20.880 --> 3:08:31.840]  Alex Jones remember the flesh-eating robot stories those got pulled all over
[3:08:31.840 --> 3:08:37.000]  the web Fox News AP you name it we had it printed off we have the copy and I
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:40.640]  want to go over a little bit of that coming up in a few minutes kind of the
[3:08:40.640 --> 3:08:44.600]  big picture of that because it did capture the public's attention
[3:08:44.600 --> 3:08:48.920]  jaren alone her two local news stations last week saying we're searching it we
[3:08:48.920 --> 3:08:53.200]  found the link but it's a dead why is it gone we'll break that down coming up
[3:08:53.200 --> 3:08:56.040]  here in just a few minutes but finishing up with Rockefeller let's play the
[3:08:56.040 --> 3:08:59.960]  first part of that clip where we are changes confronting him in one of the
[3:08:59.960 --> 3:09:03.200]  Senate office buildings they say we want to talk about Bilderberg now I'm not
[3:09:03.200 --> 3:09:06.760]  going to talk about that with you see for years they would say it just didn't
[3:09:06.760 --> 3:09:11.680]  exist now they can't say that now the minutes of Bilderberg have been stolen
[3:09:11.680 --> 3:09:15.520]  and leaked where they set up the EU they set up the North American Union they're
[3:09:15.520 --> 3:09:20.400]  the ones financially raping us they're the ones that have stolen 23.7 trillion
[3:09:20.400 --> 3:09:31.280]  in 10 months double the GDP roughly this is incredible the GDP is 13 trillion a
[3:09:31.280 --> 3:09:35.840]  year so it'll be double the GDP at 26 trillion but within two months it'll be
[3:09:35.840 --> 3:09:40.600]  well over 26 trillion so in one year more than doubling the GDP in stolen
[3:09:40.600 --> 3:09:44.600]  money they hoard for themselves and don't loan out and they're using the
[3:09:44.600 --> 3:09:48.640]  dollars when they have value buying real assets later we get the dollars to pay
[3:09:48.640 --> 3:09:55.040]  them back with taxes and when they're devalued what a system so here's we are
[3:09:55.040 --> 3:09:58.880]  change confronting Jay Rockefeller will play the second part of the clip behind
[3:09:58.880 --> 3:10:04.760]  the joke senator Rockefeller yes I'd like to know if you're aware that we the
[3:10:04.760 --> 3:10:08.920]  American people are aware of the agenda of the council on foreign relations in
[3:10:08.920 --> 3:10:12.760]  the Bilderberg group and if you could comment on that please because very
[3:10:12.760 --> 3:10:17.560]  concerning to a lot of us you know I have 37 people lined up right outside
[3:10:17.560 --> 3:10:21.760]  senator Schumer's office all of the ones that answered precisely that question well
[3:10:21.760 --> 3:10:25.880]  could you just take a brief moment and let us know because we're not talking
[3:10:25.880 --> 3:10:29.240]  about something well something that's so important it sort of transcends
[3:10:29.240 --> 3:10:33.080]  everything else that we're talking about sir could you comment on that please no
[3:10:33.080 --> 3:10:40.560]  I'd like to know about the Bilderberg group I'd like to know about the Bilderberg
[3:10:40.560 --> 3:10:46.040]  group sir well that's not part of our discussion when can we discuss that with
[3:10:46.040 --> 3:10:51.920]  you sir thank you thank you okay this is for the senator this is the scientific
[3:10:51.920 --> 3:11:00.120]  group by scientists from around the world basically can push the proof that
[3:11:00.120 --> 3:11:04.280]  there's an article three section three treasonous cover-up going on about 911
[3:11:04.280 --> 3:11:09.480]  sir so we'd love to get your opinion on that too what did you say thank you
[3:11:09.480 --> 3:11:15.720]  okay all right to get to the next one later in the clips the second part from
[3:11:15.720 --> 3:11:19.240]  another camera angle as Luke gets into eugenics so here they are giving him
[3:11:19.240 --> 3:11:24.000]  peer-reviewed foreign and national studies about explosive thermite
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:28.920]  thermate in the towers and he's that's not part of our discussion always
[3:11:28.920 --> 3:11:34.600]  compartmentalizing information because he can't talk about it none of them can
[3:11:34.600 --> 3:11:37.600]  they can't even say your kooks anymore because they know folks will go read the
[3:11:37.600 --> 3:11:43.720]  studies he can't deny and say Bilderberg doesn't exist anymore that his uncle
[3:11:43.720 --> 3:11:47.040]  David Rockefeller was instrumental in founding with Prince Bernhardt and was
[3:11:47.040 --> 3:11:52.920]  at the first meeting and he can't deny eugenics they say your family set it up
[3:11:52.920 --> 3:11:58.720]  and was Hitler's inspiration Hitler wrote in mind comp thinking the groups he
[3:11:58.720 --> 3:12:02.480]  founded his great-grandfather found it his grandfather found it his father
[3:12:02.480 --> 3:12:09.480]  founded meaning this family is behind it all this is a very the cancer research
[3:12:09.480 --> 3:12:13.200]  the put in the cancer viruses in the vaccines I mean these are the guys these
[3:12:13.200 --> 3:12:17.480]  are sick sick wicked wicked people you notice he looks at them like oh my god
[3:12:17.480 --> 3:12:21.320]  here are slaves that can see and see more and more they can't just brush his
[3:12:21.320 --> 3:12:25.760]  office kooks they know more and more of us when he sees 30 40 people there to
[3:12:25.760 --> 3:12:30.640]  confront him he knows that represents thousands per person they're realizing
[3:12:30.640 --> 3:12:35.760]  oh my god they're on to us now remember and I meant to print this up this morning
[3:12:35.760 --> 3:12:40.480]  but you can go look it up Rockefeller funded massacres in New Jersey and
[3:12:40.480 --> 3:12:44.400]  Colorado and all over with Pinkerton security famous case where they killed
[3:12:44.400 --> 3:12:48.160]  a whole bunch people in Colorado they own the land the gold mine they sent in
[3:12:48.160 --> 3:12:52.640]  men on horseback burnt down the whole camp rode down four-year-olds you know
[3:12:52.640 --> 3:12:58.800]  with horses shot them in the back and that was in the last century that was in
[3:12:58.800 --> 3:13:02.600]  the early 20th century famous cases of Rockefeller funded strike breakers
[3:13:02.600 --> 3:13:08.480]  gatling gunning protesters and then they got in trouble so they went into this
[3:13:08.480 --> 3:13:15.680]  philanthropic mode they set up in PR radio PBS TV everything I mean these are
[3:13:15.680 --> 3:13:32.440]  the guys so let's cut back to this monster
[3:13:32.440 --> 3:13:47.080]  some of these things if we want sir please just no no go go find somebody else
[3:13:47.080 --> 3:13:59.280]  the truth is coming out there's a lot of us that are aware of it I'm sure you know
[3:13:59.280 --> 3:14:03.240]  some members sir if you're not a member yourself as an Obama's director of
[3:14:03.240 --> 3:14:08.760]  national intelligence I'm a Blair who I greatly respect have labeled cyber
[3:14:08.760 --> 3:14:16.880]  security perpetrated through the internet as the number one national
[3:14:16.880 --> 3:14:24.000]  hazard of attack on the homeland in West Virginia and in West Virginia and
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:29.920]  America anywhere else so I mean it really it really almost makes you ask
[3:14:29.920 --> 3:14:35.040]  the question would have been better if we never invented the internet well
[3:14:35.040 --> 3:14:40.560]  there you go ladies and gentlemen that's J. Rockefeller on the dais on the bench
[3:14:40.560 --> 3:14:44.640]  talking about better off not ever having the internet he's trying to pass bills
[3:14:44.640 --> 3:14:50.920]  right now to restrict free speech in America now I want to shift gears we're
[3:14:50.920 --> 3:14:58.080]  now going to cover the story of the missing flesh-eating Pentagon robot
[3:14:58.080 --> 3:15:04.200]  story this story from Fox News and similar headlines were all over other
[3:15:04.200 --> 3:15:14.240]  news publications on July 14th 15th and 16th this printout is from July 15 2009
[3:15:14.240 --> 3:15:23.800]  upcoming military robot could feed on dead bodies there it is for you on
[3:15:23.800 --> 3:15:29.520]  screen luckily we had printed out several copies of this but you cannot
[3:15:29.520 --> 3:15:35.000]  find this article in the few other news agencies that went with the same or
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:45.120]  similar headlines also also have removed the headline and replaced it with
[3:15:45.120 --> 3:15:57.120]  things like this biomass eating military robot is a vegetarian company says so
[3:15:57.120 --> 3:16:02.920]  when you go to the link of where this story was upcoming military robot could
[3:16:02.920 --> 3:16:09.120]  feed on dead bodies you get the story that the flesh-eating robot is actually
[3:16:09.120 --> 3:16:19.720]  a vegetarian say inventors now let's go ahead and read the Fox News story the
[3:16:19.720 --> 3:16:26.440]  original one now in media they're supposed to correct the original story
[3:16:26.440 --> 3:16:31.320]  but never pull it so this is a new memory hole system for Fox News to simply
[3:16:31.320 --> 3:16:37.520]  completely trash the old article and replace it with the one on your screen
[3:16:37.520 --> 3:16:44.160]  that's up there today upcoming military robot could feed on dead bodies it
[3:16:44.160 --> 3:16:48.720]  could be a combination of 19th century mechanics 21st century technology and
[3:16:48.720 --> 3:16:53.120]  20th century horror movie a Maryland company under contract to the Pentagon
[3:16:53.120 --> 3:16:57.840]  is working on a steam-powered robot see old technology is really good
[3:16:57.840 --> 3:17:01.640]  technology that would fuel itself by grabbing up whatever organic material
[3:17:01.640 --> 3:17:06.360]  it can find grass wood old furniture even dead bodies robotic technologies
[3:17:06.360 --> 3:17:12.840]  inks energetically autonomous tactical robot that's right eater is what it
[3:17:12.840 --> 3:17:18.040]  stands for confined ingest and extract energy from biomass in the environment
[3:17:18.040 --> 3:17:22.560]  and other organically based energy sources as well as use conventional and
[3:17:22.560 --> 3:17:27.680]  alternative fuels such as gasoline heavy fuel kerosene diesel propane
[3:17:27.680 --> 3:17:32.120]  coal cooking oil and solar when suitable reads the company's website that
[3:17:32.120 --> 3:17:35.880]  biomass and other organically based energy sources would necessarily be
[3:17:35.880 --> 3:17:39.720]  limited to plant material animal and human corpses contain plenty of energy
[3:17:39.720 --> 3:17:45.320]  and they'd be plentiful in a war zone either will be powered by the waste heat
[3:17:45.320 --> 3:17:53.160]  energy developed cyclone power technology out of Florida which uses an
[3:17:53.160 --> 3:17:58.040]  external combustion chamber burning up fuel to heat up water in close loop
[3:17:58.040 --> 3:18:01.520]  engineering electricity yeah water power is great that's what nuclear power
[3:18:01.520 --> 3:18:05.520]  plants do they boil the water with with with the nuke rods and then power
[3:18:05.520 --> 3:18:09.760]  things great system the advantages of the military are the robot could be
[3:18:09.760 --> 3:18:13.920]  extremely flexible in fuel sources it could roam on its own for months even
[3:18:13.920 --> 3:18:20.280]  years on having to be refueled or serviced see roam for months perfect
[3:18:20.280 --> 3:18:24.840]  upon the eater platform the Pentagon could build all sorts of things a
[3:18:24.840 --> 3:18:28.440]  transport and ambulance a communications event center even a
[3:18:28.440 --> 3:18:34.000]  mobile gunship in press materials robotic technology presents eater as an
[3:18:34.000 --> 3:18:38.640]  essentially benign artificial creature that fills its belly with foraging
[3:18:38.640 --> 3:18:45.000]  despite the obvious military purpose okay but the issue is regardless of
[3:18:45.000 --> 3:18:48.400]  whether they're designed to eat human flesh or not on the battlefield or
[3:18:48.400 --> 3:18:51.920]  animal flesh or whatever they are out designed to kill and let's show folks
[3:18:51.920 --> 3:18:57.280]  some of the images of the eaters now these are the declassified robots I've
[3:18:57.280 --> 3:19:01.000]  talked to Marine Corps armors and others in development they say they can't get
[3:19:01.000 --> 3:19:04.800]  into it but yes it's much more advanced just like they you know they had it for
[3:19:04.800 --> 3:19:10.640]  25 years the v2 bomber and they rolled it out in 87 so they had it since the
[3:19:10.640 --> 3:19:17.520]  late 60s and they already had Swords in fact Google that Swords used in
[3:19:17.520 --> 3:19:22.080]  Fallujah with machine guns and grenade launchers and they admit they plan to
[3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:25.400]  use these against the citizenry and that's why the globalists want these
[3:19:25.400 --> 3:19:29.640]  systems because they can have robotic aircraft robotic drones robotic
[3:19:29.640 --> 3:19:36.760]  predators robotic reapers AI systems AI combat robots that will kill and can be
[3:19:36.760 --> 3:19:42.900]  delivered by robotic troops ships themselves or robotically dropped with
[3:19:42.900 --> 3:19:47.240]  parachutes and then the elite can launch whole military operations without
[3:19:47.240 --> 3:19:51.400]  having to have troops follow the orders like a general Fox Fallen says no to
[3:19:51.400 --> 3:19:55.160]  bush on attacking Iran they can launch drone attacks on Iran
[3:19:55.160 --> 3:19:59.280]  Skynet is not something I would be terminated the Pentagon has called the
[3:19:59.280 --> 3:20:04.720]  system Skynet the right but with food prices soaring to all-time highs as the
[3:20:04.720 --> 3:20:08.800]  dollar continues to fall in value what can you and your family do to guarantee

[3:24:11.360 --> 3:24:17.000]  and waited 245 kind of road. I remember when I first got on the air 13 14 years
[3:24:17.000 --> 3:24:21.280]  ago people sending me documents and books and materials about Patton being
[3:24:21.280 --> 3:24:27.960]  murdered and now they've got government documents they've got proof if you
[3:24:27.960 --> 3:24:33.360]  Google general Patton murdered by CIA you get the Sunday Express you get the
[3:24:33.360 --> 3:24:38.400]  London Telegraph you get mainstream news and the guy that really ferreted out
[3:24:38.400 --> 3:24:43.040]  all these latest documents to prove this and why they did it joins us now
[3:24:43.040 --> 3:24:47.360]  Robert Wilcox author of Target Patton the plot to assassinate General George
[3:24:47.360 --> 3:24:52.480]  Patton since he was on earlier in the year I think was January it's now gotten a
[3:24:52.480 --> 3:24:56.840]  lot of attention and people say well this happened 60 years ago why does it
[3:24:56.840 --> 3:25:01.160]  matter it shows you who runs our government who runs our country and for
[3:25:01.160 --> 3:25:05.880]  police and military out there to know that all of you are expendable too and
[3:25:05.880 --> 3:25:09.000]  the people running our nation wrap themselves in the flag Patton didn't
[3:25:09.000 --> 3:25:12.800]  want to give Germany to the Soviets he didn't like putting millions of Germans
[3:25:12.800 --> 3:25:19.280]  in camps or more importantly US troops that were this is on record that were
[3:25:19.280 --> 3:25:23.880]  that that were grabbed out of Germans prisoner of war camps and tens of
[3:25:23.880 --> 3:25:29.440]  thousands in the US military just said keep them yeah Joe they're a present to
[3:25:29.440 --> 3:25:35.480]  you that's what they think of you so this is on record and so to recap what
[3:25:35.480 --> 3:25:39.440]  happened to Patton the documents what's coming out what the family saying and
[3:25:39.440 --> 3:25:44.720]  where this is going is the author of Target Patton Robert Wilcox Robert good
[3:25:44.720 --> 3:25:48.880]  to have you on with us today hey Alex thanks for having me back you bet it's a
[3:25:48.880 --> 3:25:52.240]  quick segment now long segment coming up but I mean tell folks in a nutshell
[3:25:52.240 --> 3:25:56.040]  about the book and the aftermath of these documents and materials coming out
[3:25:56.040 --> 3:26:02.320]  now well Patton I think I could go before a grand jury and get an indictment
[3:26:02.320 --> 3:26:08.480]  but you know talk motive first he wanted to fight the Russians he was livid like
[3:26:08.480 --> 3:26:13.440]  you said about all the POWs that were left there he just didn't think it was
[3:26:13.440 --> 3:26:19.240]  right that we should liberate from the Nazis and then give it to the Russians
[3:26:19.240 --> 3:26:23.760]  and he also knew secrets that would have but taken down some of the great
[3:26:23.760 --> 3:26:28.720]  potentate of our lives Eisenhower for instance a great diplomat but a
[3:26:28.720 --> 3:26:35.720]  terrible warfighter the war could have been over maybe in September of 44 think
[3:26:35.720 --> 3:26:39.040]  of the lives that would have been saved if they'd have let Patton go but they
[3:26:39.040 --> 3:26:43.960]  did globalists wanted the Cold War continue they didn't want him to go on
[3:26:43.960 --> 3:26:49.200]  and you know he was he was a guy like you never see today you know I
[3:26:49.200 --> 3:26:54.480]  guy who believed things and said them and stood on principle and he wanted to
[3:26:54.480 --> 3:26:58.560]  go and fight the Russians and they weren't gonna let it happen because at
[3:26:58.560 --> 3:27:02.600]  that time the American government was big buddies with the with the Russians
[3:27:02.600 --> 3:27:07.640]  and and and it's even worse Joe Stalin who'd killed 60 million of his own
[3:27:07.640 --> 3:27:14.880]  people uncle Joe uncle Joe that's what the FDR used to call him and you know
[3:27:14.880 --> 3:27:18.440]  FDR was convinced that Stalin was a great man that Russia was a great
[3:27:18.440 --> 3:27:24.520]  country and that they were needed to to keep the world a better place after the
[3:27:24.520 --> 3:27:29.520]  war and so that was that in a nutshell those two are the biggest reasons he
[3:27:29.520 --> 3:27:33.320]  wanted to fight the Russians and he was gonna tell secrets about people that
[3:27:33.320 --> 3:27:36.760]  would have stopped them cold up wasn't the last straw from reading your book
[3:27:36.760 --> 3:27:39.640]  and previously also looking into it that he said I'm gonna talk about how our
[3:27:39.640 --> 3:27:44.760]  POWs are in the Russian hands and they said that's it killing well I can't
[3:27:44.760 --> 3:27:50.000]  say that Alex I I can't say it all I can tell you is that the wild Bill
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:56.040]  Donovan and and and what the book does is I found eyewitnesses the man who
[3:27:56.040 --> 3:28:01.160]  says that he staged the accident that that that eventually ended in Patton's
[3:28:01.160 --> 3:28:07.720]  death over Douglas Pizotta was an assassin for the OSS and he had a
[3:28:07.720 --> 3:28:12.560]  meeting with Wild Bill Donovan who was the head of the OSS and Wild Bill
[3:28:12.560 --> 3:28:18.280]  Donovan didn't report to anyone except for the president and possibly the joint
[3:28:18.280 --> 3:28:23.600]  chiefs of staff and there were a series of meetings and this thing started off
[3:28:23.600 --> 3:28:28.240]  with a stop pattern which is a matter of record they stole his gas preventing him
[3:28:28.240 --> 3:28:32.800]  from going into Germany and ending the war earlier but after the war when they
[3:28:32.800 --> 3:28:38.280]  used him to win the war then they had a meeting with Patton actually only one
[3:28:38.280 --> 3:28:44.800]  man Donovan did and I've gotten Pizotta's diaries as well as interviewing
[3:28:44.800 --> 3:28:49.400]  him before he died and and basically at that meeting they said look we have this
[3:28:49.400 --> 3:28:52.920]  great general he's done great things for us but now he's threatening to ruin
[3:28:52.920 --> 3:28:56.960]  everything and you've got to stop him Douglas and Douglas said what do you
[3:28:56.960 --> 3:29:00.840]  mean sir and he said well you do what you have to do and Douglas said you mean
[3:29:00.840 --> 3:29:06.280]  kill him yes you do what you have to do and this is after about eight meetings
[3:29:06.280 --> 3:29:12.120]  that progressed from stop pattern which they did by taking his gas and not
[3:29:12.120 --> 3:29:15.680]  allowing him to end the war when he when he really could have done so and the
[3:29:15.680 --> 3:29:19.760]  Germans will tell you so this was at the point where he he'd roared through
[3:29:19.760 --> 3:29:25.200]  France and he had he put the the Germans in disarray and at that point
[3:29:25.200 --> 3:29:28.880]  they'll tell you they could have been defeated all their armies were
[3:29:28.880 --> 3:29:32.480]  streaming back into Germany and he knew it and he could have killed them he
[3:29:32.480 --> 3:29:36.200]  could have stopped them yeah they had their main force cut off on the western
[3:29:36.200 --> 3:29:40.320]  front he'd done a flank on them but God forbid that you got to give it to the
[3:29:40.320 --> 3:29:44.720]  Soviets they've got to set up East Germany absolutely social control freaks
[3:29:44.720 --> 3:29:48.320]  that the bureaucrats have to have control so they give it to their
[3:29:48.320 --> 3:29:54.320]  bureaucratic buddy uncle Joe stay there we're on the march the empires on the

[3:35:54.560 --> 3:35:58.360]  back to Robert Wilcox author of target patent before we continue with the
[3:35:58.360 --> 3:36:03.280]  assassination what it's been like now that your books out the diaries confirm
[3:36:03.280 --> 3:36:09.040]  the eyewitnesses the documents all of this if you had any repercussions have
[3:36:09.040 --> 3:36:16.120]  you talked to Patton's family his heirs his ancestors no that they've been
[3:36:16.120 --> 3:36:21.160]  strangely silent I I tried early on in the in the beginning of writing this
[3:36:21.160 --> 3:36:27.280]  book to get in touch with them because I think they have either information or
[3:36:27.280 --> 3:36:31.880]  archives that that really could could help a person like myself who knows a
[3:36:31.880 --> 3:36:35.480]  lot more than anyone else about it simply because I've been working on it for
[3:36:35.480 --> 3:36:41.600]  ten years but there's been no no real discussion from them I there was
[3:36:41.600 --> 3:36:48.120]  something posted on Amazon that someone said why do you bring this up and it's
[3:36:48.120 --> 3:36:51.920]  it's the it's the Kennedy syndrome you know they don't want to hear about it I
[3:36:51.920 --> 3:36:58.640]  think they think it besmirches their their their heroes you know reputation
[3:36:58.640 --> 3:37:03.680]  but you know this this has this has to be put out in the open because he was a
[3:37:03.680 --> 3:37:08.280]  great patriot and and what happened to him was terrible and and and we need to
[3:37:08.280 --> 3:37:12.200]  get the finalization on it there's still stuff to come out I have heard from
[3:37:12.200 --> 3:37:17.480]  people I always thought that that I would would open up a can of worms and
[3:37:17.480 --> 3:37:21.280]  they just come roaring in but I think we're too far away from it but I've
[3:37:21.280 --> 3:37:26.040]  heard from various people for instance the the scene of the accident in which
[3:37:26.040 --> 3:37:31.640]  Patton was was heard at and subsequently died from all types of
[3:37:31.640 --> 3:37:35.920]  mysterious people were were over and one of them is in identify of all of them
[3:37:35.920 --> 3:37:39.380]  are identified in my book who we know we could identify but one of them in
[3:37:39.380 --> 3:37:43.560]  particular a very mysterious figure will someone call me and said I knew that
[3:37:43.560 --> 3:37:49.360]  man and I once talked to him about somehow the Patton death came out and
[3:37:49.360 --> 3:37:53.960]  he turned blue and and ran away and not ran away but walked away and we never
[3:37:53.960 --> 3:37:59.800]  heard from him again he was a friend in this circle of friends and that showed
[3:37:59.800 --> 3:38:05.920]  to me that well he must have had some guilt about the thing so anyway the
[3:38:05.920 --> 3:38:12.400]  the the reaction has just been a continual a lot of praise for the book
[3:38:12.400 --> 3:38:17.800]  believe me I spent ten years at it I'm a professional writer I just look for
[3:38:17.800 --> 3:38:21.440]  stories I don't go after things just to just to go after things I look for good
[3:38:21.440 --> 3:38:26.760]  stories this one was was brought to me by my my cousin who was an
[3:38:26.760 --> 3:38:31.720]  international private eye investigator has a firm of his own who told me that
[3:38:31.720 --> 3:38:36.560]  he knew of bazaar this this person who eventually confessed to me that he had
[3:38:36.560 --> 3:38:42.680]  actually set up the the accident the strange accident and and when I went to
[3:38:42.680 --> 3:38:47.520]  bazaar let me say that he never would have talked to me had he not had a stroke
[3:38:47.520 --> 3:38:53.080]  this man lived his entire life as what he called a clandestine this is a you
[3:38:53.080 --> 3:38:56.920]  know the very secret person and and during the war he was an assassin he
[3:38:56.920 --> 3:39:00.640]  one of the first things I did after he told me a story had been a jettberg
[3:39:00.640 --> 3:39:04.920]  which was a really courageous this was the beginning of our special forces he
[3:39:04.920 --> 3:39:10.280]  had jumped behind enemy lines behind the German lines his job was to organize the
[3:39:10.280 --> 3:39:15.360]  maquis against the Germans when when they were fighting back at D-Day he did
[3:39:15.360 --> 3:39:19.960]  all that tremendous story about him and I went to the National Archives and I
[3:39:19.960 --> 3:39:24.360]  dug up everything he told me and it was all true this man was sterling as far as
[3:39:24.360 --> 3:39:29.320]  what he had told me and then as it went on and when we continued to do it to
[3:39:29.320 --> 3:39:34.960]  interview he then told me about at first the story was that that he knew
[3:39:34.960 --> 3:39:39.600]  about this and that's what my cousin had told me but it developed finally and it
[3:39:39.600 --> 3:39:42.760]  was obvious as we talked more about it that he had actually been the guy he
[3:39:42.760 --> 3:39:47.760]  was talking about that he knew about and so Douglas Pizotta this OSS
[3:39:47.760 --> 3:39:53.640]  assassin and the OSS is the forerunner of the CIA got the order from Wild Bill
[3:39:53.640 --> 3:39:58.600]  Donovan to do this and the other part of that the other strong part of that was
[3:39:58.600 --> 3:40:03.600]  that there was an intelligence officer with the CIC that was sort of the FBI
[3:40:03.600 --> 3:40:10.680]  of the Army with Patton's forces and after the war he found out about the
[3:40:10.680 --> 3:40:15.600]  plot from the Russian side and let me state right now that this was an OSS
[3:40:15.600 --> 3:40:24.840]  NKVD operation Stalin ordered the hit of of Patton as well and by the way the
[3:40:24.840 --> 3:40:30.040]  OSS and the NKVD were in collusion and this is all in target Patton something
[3:40:30.040 --> 3:40:33.360]  that very few people know about well by the way sir separately talking to other
[3:40:33.360 --> 3:40:39.080]  historians and folks I mean deep with the Russians even after the Cold War
[3:40:39.080 --> 3:40:43.280]  starts giving them the nukes giving them the factories the Rockefellers the
[3:40:43.280 --> 3:40:49.280]  Rothschilds the opal factories I mean the same crap US made goods going through
[3:40:49.280 --> 3:40:53.560]  Russia to North Vietnam during that war this was two military industrial
[3:40:53.560 --> 3:40:59.600]  complexes propping each other up I mean that's a side issue but it's just that
[3:40:59.600 --> 3:41:03.640]  in history we just get continual validation from research like yours
[3:41:03.640 --> 3:41:07.320]  no I you know I don't think it is a side issue I think it's right to the core of
[3:41:07.320 --> 3:41:12.360]  the thing because one of the things that has come out is how deeply embedded the
[3:41:12.360 --> 3:41:17.440]  Russian Communist Stalin's agents were in our government at the time of the
[3:41:17.440 --> 3:41:22.040]  Second World War nobody knows this it's only come out now because of been known
[3:41:22.040 --> 3:41:26.160]  of the no no was our breaking of the of the Russian code and this has been kept
[3:41:26.160 --> 3:41:31.280]  top-secret all the way to the end of the 90s and what we did is we we knew you
[3:41:31.280 --> 3:41:35.360]  know all this talk about McCarthy being you know a crazy man he didn't know what
[3:41:35.360 --> 3:41:40.600]  he was talking about everything he said was true whatever he was he was he
[3:41:40.600 --> 3:41:45.120]  had he was being fed some information from this bonona the the Russians had
[3:41:45.120 --> 3:41:52.320]  top-level agents all the way to the top of the government right into FDR's office
[3:41:52.320 --> 3:41:55.880]  I mean they were let's go over some of that because in the last four or five
[3:41:55.880 --> 3:41:59.800]  years I've seen New York Times Washington Post headlines even Russian
[3:41:59.800 --> 3:42:05.280]  headlines McCarthy was right secret documents released show that it was
[3:42:05.280 --> 3:42:09.600]  giant but that it was a shared deal there were US agents there and at the
[3:42:09.600 --> 3:42:13.720]  level of the Fabian socialist like Dr. Carol Quigley wrote at Georgetown in
[3:42:13.720 --> 3:42:18.320]  69 Bill Clinton's mentor the bankers just wanted somebody to consolidate
[3:42:18.320 --> 3:42:23.360]  fascist communist socialist they don't care so I would say it's all you know
[3:42:23.360 --> 3:42:27.320]  that's kind of like eugenics came from the US in England to Hitler so it isn't
[3:42:27.320 --> 3:42:33.040]  that there were Nazis in America the Nazis daddy was in America in England you
[3:42:33.040 --> 3:42:37.160]  know it's not that the Soviets were infiltrating us it was that the British
[3:42:37.160 --> 3:42:42.080]  intelligence was their daddy you know it's it's it's it's so sophisticated how
[3:42:42.080 --> 3:42:47.320]  they create the enemies and they create the conflicts but go ahead well you know
[3:42:47.320 --> 3:42:51.680]  more much more about that than I do all I know is the is the pattern connection
[3:42:51.680 --> 3:42:56.360]  and I and I do know that Patton was up against the government the the FDR
[3:42:56.360 --> 3:43:01.160]  administration which was totally infiltrated by Russian agents who were
[3:43:01.160 --> 3:43:05.760]  bound and determined to get rid of Patton and to get rid of anybody who
[3:43:05.760 --> 3:43:10.680]  would who would stand up to the Russians as far as it went further I wasn't able
[3:43:10.680 --> 3:43:16.200]  to deal with that but I mean it was just right and so I think we were talking
[3:43:16.200 --> 3:43:21.160]  about Patton and exactly what had happened to him and Patton had been
[3:43:21.160 --> 3:43:27.560]  banished from from his jobs in Europe after the war they didn't need him
[3:43:27.560 --> 3:43:31.320]  anymore he was going to go home and he was going to tell all these secrets and
[3:43:31.320 --> 3:43:37.240]  and he was going to fight to get us to to fight Russia and it was the last day
[3:43:37.240 --> 3:43:43.360]  before he was to go home and he was driving down in his Cadillac touring
[3:43:43.360 --> 3:43:51.240]  car a lonely road and all of a sudden a truck comes up it was they actually had
[3:43:51.240 --> 3:43:56.400]  stopped at a railroad track and there are three people in Patton's car there's
[3:43:56.400 --> 3:44:02.120]  Patton in the back seat there's his general aide named gay general gay and
[3:44:02.120 --> 3:44:06.240]  a driver and up ahead as they're waiting for this train to go by they're
[3:44:06.240 --> 3:44:11.680]  stopped at the track they see a truck it's an army truck and it's way in the
[3:44:11.680 --> 3:44:15.280]  in the in the front of them but it stopped on the side of the road well
[3:44:15.280 --> 3:44:19.760]  when they when the train goes by this truck they start up and this
[3:44:19.760 --> 3:44:24.320]  truck starts up towards them very very suspicious situation and then it comes
[3:44:24.320 --> 3:44:29.360]  right almost a breath of them and suddenly turns in front of Patton and
[3:44:29.360 --> 3:44:33.840]  the driver can't do anything but try to turn his car and they have a
[3:44:33.840 --> 3:44:39.960]  collision it's not a big collision but it's a it's a almost a you know between
[3:44:39.960 --> 3:44:45.880]  10 and 30 miles per hour Patton is said they say to have flown it there was a
[3:44:45.880 --> 3:44:51.440]  large area in the back seat he said to have flown forward hit his head broken
[3:44:51.440 --> 3:44:56.400]  his neck there and then come back on top of general gay
[3:44:56.400 --> 3:45:02.280]  uh... bazzata told me that he was in a they were they were looking at and
[3:45:02.280 --> 3:45:06.960]  commenting on all the clumps of war refuge and right at that point where the
[3:45:06.960 --> 3:45:10.880]  accident happened bazzata was behind there with another russian aide with it
[3:45:10.880 --> 3:45:16.440]  with a russian agent and he shot a specially designed weapon didn't shoot
[3:45:16.440 --> 3:45:22.200]  bullets it shot uh... a boat which will which would look just like out from an
[3:45:22.200 --> 3:45:26.600]  accident and paten was looking out the window in the last day
[3:45:26.600 --> 3:45:29.880]  supposed to have said according to gay was
[3:45:29.880 --> 3:45:31.240]  look at that
[3:45:31.240 --> 3:45:32.720]  and then bam
[3:45:32.720 --> 3:45:35.960]  uh... this accident occurs that was the moment that he could shoot and of
[3:45:35.960 --> 3:45:40.600]  bazzata was a world-class shooter and it's a kinetic energy weapon i mean they
[3:45:40.600 --> 3:45:43.760]  know it's a heavy weapon they know it's going to bash it's going to hurt
[3:45:43.760 --> 3:45:47.120]  somebody to make it look like they're hurt it didn't break the neck it doesn't
[3:45:47.120 --> 3:45:50.240]  matter because you get to kill them once they're in the ambulance or at the
[3:45:50.240 --> 3:45:54.600]  hospital this is exactly right you know the cia if you read their manual
[3:45:54.600 --> 3:46:00.040]  the best way to kill someone and make it look like an accident is an accident
[3:46:00.040 --> 3:46:02.840]  because that's what everybody figures is going to happen
[3:46:02.840 --> 3:46:06.520]  anyway paten uh... ends up with a broken neck
[3:46:06.520 --> 3:46:09.840]  uh... and a tremendous gash across his body
[3:46:09.840 --> 3:46:13.640]  going from the bridge of his nose all the way to the top of his head
[3:46:13.640 --> 3:46:18.040]  but you could lift literally lift the flap of skin up and see the bone
[3:46:18.040 --> 3:46:19.680]  and he's bleeding to death
[3:46:19.680 --> 3:46:21.360]  he's paralyzed
[3:46:21.360 --> 3:46:26.360]  and they are telling you at least a hundred people came out of the woodwork
[3:46:26.360 --> 3:46:28.040]  uh... a general
[3:46:28.040 --> 3:46:33.400]  uh... ambulances it was just strange this was a this is a lonely road
[3:46:33.400 --> 3:46:37.480]  on a sunday morning and they just came out of the woodwork anyway paten
[3:46:37.480 --> 3:46:40.440]  is not taken to a hospital there in
[3:46:40.440 --> 3:46:45.560]  in uh... in the city where he is uh... uh... uh... he's taken down to heidelberg
[3:46:45.560 --> 3:46:48.760]  uh... and uh... which is about thirty miles away
[3:46:48.760 --> 3:46:52.800]  if they figure he's gonna die but he's really really strong and he begins to
[3:46:52.800 --> 3:46:54.520]  rally and he gets so
[3:46:54.520 --> 3:46:56.440]  he's he's doing so well
[3:46:56.440 --> 3:46:59.680]  that they're gonna fly him home this is nineteen forty five this is the
[3:46:59.680 --> 3:47:01.120]  september forty five
[3:47:01.120 --> 3:47:04.720]  but but but but but a terrible trip for anybody wasn't really strong
[3:47:04.720 --> 3:47:08.080]  and uh... just before he's about to go home
[3:47:08.080 --> 3:47:12.880]  uh... he has a sudden down turn and uh... if you read in in target paten
[3:47:12.880 --> 3:47:13.880]  howl uh...
[3:47:13.880 --> 3:47:18.240]  uh... the russian there is later on a russian who actually goes to one of the
[3:47:18.240 --> 3:47:22.560]  uh... paten uh... uh... grandchildren and says
[3:47:22.560 --> 3:47:24.600]  we actually poisoned him
[3:47:24.600 --> 3:47:26.960]  so they knocked him off they they poisoned him
[3:47:26.960 --> 3:47:30.560]  uh... that's the way you get them you know if you can't get them in the actual
[3:47:30.560 --> 3:47:31.840]  uh... accident
[3:47:31.840 --> 3:47:35.040]  and they go to the hospital and then it's easy to get to them
[3:47:35.040 --> 3:47:37.120]  in various ways and kill him
[3:47:37.120 --> 3:47:38.920]  there was no autopsy
[3:47:38.920 --> 3:47:40.680]  of of paten back another
[3:47:40.680 --> 3:47:44.640]  strange strange so we see this over and over again why do you think the
[3:47:44.640 --> 3:47:48.120]  families silent because they're scared of the system
[3:47:48.120 --> 3:47:51.760]  i'd you know i just can't answer that question i always go back to the
[3:47:51.760 --> 3:47:53.800]  to the to the uh... kennedy
[3:47:53.800 --> 3:47:56.320]  why are they silent and won't let people
[3:47:56.320 --> 3:47:57.840]  it's because i think
[3:47:57.840 --> 3:48:01.560]  either they know something they don't want to get out
[3:48:01.560 --> 3:48:05.480]  they feel it's besmirching their uh...
[3:48:05.480 --> 3:48:08.400]  you know i know most of them are scared i know a lot of times women when their
[3:48:08.400 --> 3:48:11.040]  husbands get murdered come out and start saying something the cops come and
[3:48:11.040 --> 3:48:12.000]  threaten them
[3:48:12.000 --> 3:48:14.520]  and say look your kids are going to be all right if you shut up
[3:48:14.520 --> 3:48:17.920]  well i have you know you can it is secretary went public and said it was an
[3:48:17.920 --> 3:48:19.200]  inside job
[3:48:19.200 --> 3:48:21.840]  and of course said that jackie believe that
[3:48:21.840 --> 3:48:24.720]  and i've talked to the eyewitnesses that talk to the secretary
[3:48:24.720 --> 3:48:28.760]  uh... so we know that goes on we know that uh... jfk jr
[3:48:28.760 --> 3:48:31.560]  was reopening an investigation when he died
[3:48:31.560 --> 3:48:33.200]  so uh...
[3:48:33.200 --> 3:48:37.680]  that will not uh... talk about it and the same way that the patent family would
[3:48:37.680 --> 3:48:41.120]  not talk about it but it is all you'll also read the target patent
[3:48:41.120 --> 3:48:45.480]  that mrs patent suspected something because she hired to
[3:48:45.480 --> 3:48:46.960]  uh... private eye
[3:48:46.960 --> 3:48:50.560]  to find out she she she wasn't satisfied at the end
[3:48:50.560 --> 3:48:51.760]  uh... what happened
[3:48:51.760 --> 3:48:54.880]  uh... those private eyes i don't know what happened to their reports and this
[3:48:54.880 --> 3:48:57.560]  brings up the other thing after all those people
[3:48:57.560 --> 3:48:59.480]  at that accident
[3:48:59.480 --> 3:49:03.360]  uh... the next thing i did is i went to the national archives to find
[3:49:03.360 --> 3:49:07.680]  uh... the reports by the the uh... the the mp's who were there we know they
[3:49:07.680 --> 3:49:08.400]  were there
[3:49:08.400 --> 3:49:09.840]  nothing is there
[3:49:09.840 --> 3:49:13.800]  every report is gone but i thought that you have the evidence of the cover up
[3:49:13.800 --> 3:49:15.800]  a famous death happens
[3:49:15.800 --> 3:49:18.800]  and uh... there's no report of it but there would have been a report
[3:49:18.800 --> 3:49:21.000]  for a regular private being killed
[3:49:21.000 --> 3:49:24.760]  all absolutely and we know the reports were written
[3:49:24.760 --> 3:49:26.880]  i know through uh...
[3:49:26.880 --> 3:49:30.480]  other documents that i have found at the national archives where these are
[3:49:30.480 --> 3:49:31.320]  mentioned
[3:49:31.320 --> 3:49:33.240]  that there were at least
[3:49:33.240 --> 3:49:34.840]  reports or
[3:49:34.840 --> 3:49:36.440]  investigate
[3:49:36.440 --> 3:49:40.120]  and so the cover-up evidence of the crime one of the classic evidence is
[3:49:40.120 --> 3:49:43.120]  uh... not to mention kibono who benefits
[3:49:43.120 --> 3:49:47.000]  talking to the gentleman that shot him with the uh... kinetic weapon
[3:49:47.000 --> 3:49:49.000]  the special forces operative
[3:49:49.000 --> 3:49:52.360]  uh... was he sad about doing this in hindsight is that why he was speaking up
[3:49:52.360 --> 3:49:52.840]  i mean
[3:49:52.840 --> 3:49:57.640]  murdering a great patriot a tremendous uh... guilt about everybody's whole life
[3:49:57.640 --> 3:49:59.960]  he'd not only killed baton he killed me
[3:49:59.960 --> 3:50:02.720]  he killed you know many many many many people
[3:50:02.720 --> 3:50:05.040]  our own people you know the old west that
[3:50:05.040 --> 3:50:08.200]  and that this is the world this was the the climate that it came from
[3:50:08.200 --> 3:50:09.640]  in world war two
[3:50:09.640 --> 3:50:14.080]  uh... anybody who talk too much if you were a uh... clandestine an operative
[3:50:14.080 --> 3:50:15.200]  and all that that
[3:50:15.200 --> 3:50:16.640]  if you're talking too much
[3:50:16.640 --> 3:50:18.880]  they're going to get rid of you and they did so
[3:50:18.880 --> 3:50:22.920]  and we did it uh... we did it on many many people in in world war two
[3:50:22.920 --> 3:50:26.600]  and he had killed many many people that he'd stayed on in europe
[3:50:26.600 --> 3:50:29.600]  and he'd become a freelance and he had a group
[3:50:29.600 --> 3:50:32.560]  and they would do things like rescue uh...
[3:50:32.560 --> 3:50:33.760]  uh...
[3:50:33.760 --> 3:50:36.240]  colonel from uh... for for the french
[3:50:36.240 --> 3:50:38.680]  from the uh... from from the Algerian
[3:50:38.680 --> 3:50:42.320]  and he was killed written and this is one of the reasons why he told me all this
[3:50:42.320 --> 3:50:47.240]  well we're gonna have to have you back up mister willcox just to get into

[3:55:18.960 --> 3:55:21.040]  other conversations you had with this
[3:55:21.040 --> 3:55:22.880]  special forces hitman
[3:55:22.880 --> 3:55:25.800]  uh... but you're saying tremendous guilt but i guess also
[3:55:25.800 --> 3:55:29.760]  once they're doing these things first they have you kill somebody who's bad
[3:55:29.760 --> 3:55:31.400]  and somebody who's kind of bad
[3:55:31.400 --> 3:55:32.880]  and you're killing heroes
[3:55:32.880 --> 3:55:35.800]  you know if you don't do the killing he'd have been dead wouldn't he
[3:55:35.800 --> 3:55:40.080]  good point uh... he absolutely uh... and he said that to me many times he knew
[3:55:40.080 --> 3:55:41.680]  that if he turned it down
[3:55:41.680 --> 3:55:42.880]  he'd be killed
[3:55:42.880 --> 3:55:47.640]  uh... this was a really uh... strange not strange or a really uh... interesting
[3:55:47.640 --> 3:55:50.800]  guy uh... he had attempts to kill him
[3:55:50.800 --> 3:55:55.160]  several times uh... after the war i guess because he knew too much but uh...
[3:55:55.160 --> 3:55:58.040]  he would always say they'd they were nowhere as good as me and i was always
[3:55:58.040 --> 3:55:59.680]  able to take care of it
[3:55:59.680 --> 3:56:04.360]  so uh... but um... uh... you know i want to say one thing that uh... uh... i
[3:56:04.360 --> 3:56:08.480]  i thought that i would be able to at least go see a little piece of the crime
[3:56:08.480 --> 3:56:10.480]  the scene of the crime so to speak
[3:56:10.480 --> 3:56:15.080]  because it always been advertised that patten uh... car was uh... at the uh...
[3:56:15.080 --> 3:56:17.280]  at fort nox in kentucky
[3:56:17.280 --> 3:56:22.240]  and i had the uh... head of the uh... of the of the cattle act division it was
[3:56:22.240 --> 3:56:23.000]  uh... it was a
[3:56:23.000 --> 3:56:25.960]  thirty eight cattle act of a touring car
[3:56:25.960 --> 3:56:29.800]  go down there with me and what we found out what that the car
[3:56:29.800 --> 3:56:30.640]  was a fake
[3:56:30.640 --> 3:56:32.720]  uh... it had been rebuilt
[3:56:32.720 --> 3:56:36.720]  and we know this because uh... there's always a pin number uh... that's that's
[3:56:36.720 --> 3:56:39.440]  emblazoned into the metal somewhere
[3:56:39.440 --> 3:56:43.960]  and we could see and you'll see in the book uh... how it's been scraped off
[3:56:43.960 --> 3:56:47.240]  it's the same thing with kennedy they rebuilt the whole car
[3:56:47.240 --> 3:56:50.880]  let no one look at it they just do the same stuff over and over again well you
[3:56:50.880 --> 3:56:54.440]  know in addition to all the records being taken out which is absolutely a
[3:56:54.440 --> 3:56:55.600]  cover up there
[3:56:55.600 --> 3:57:00.320]  they got rid of the uh... of of of of the that the scene of the crime so to
[3:57:00.320 --> 3:57:00.920]  speak
[3:57:00.920 --> 3:57:03.760]  you can't find you know you were investigating this is you ever get
[3:57:03.760 --> 3:57:05.720]  any threats or anything spooky
[3:57:05.720 --> 3:57:09.040]  uh... in the beginning uh... it was real spooky but you know i don't know
[3:57:09.040 --> 3:57:12.600]  whether i was seeing shadows or what but because my uh... my cousin was
[3:57:12.600 --> 3:57:15.200]  helping me and he didn't think that he deals with
[3:57:15.200 --> 3:57:17.080]  with spooks and so on and
[3:57:17.080 --> 3:57:21.200]  and what we did was that we took all my files and uh... and and we spread them
[3:57:21.200 --> 3:57:24.360]  around so that if anything happened to me nothing uh... you know they would
[3:57:24.360 --> 3:57:27.160]  not be that he would have them and would know where to go
[3:57:27.160 --> 3:57:29.360]  to to to make them public but uh...
[3:57:29.360 --> 3:57:32.920]  since then no i you know i think i'm uh... uh... they're just too old i
[3:57:32.920 --> 3:57:35.640]  don't think that anybody's going to get me on this
[3:57:35.640 --> 3:57:39.320]  you know they just uh... it's just so disgusting and if you're gonna kill a
[3:57:39.320 --> 3:57:41.520]  decorated general because he doesn't like
