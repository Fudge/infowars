[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:32.240]  Texas Alex Jones somehow some way I've got to cover all this news today there is
[00:32.240 --> 00:36.120]  just so much that I can't even decide where to start I mean look at this
[00:36.120 --> 00:41.680]  headline Pentagon and CIA want to keep ISIS tweeting endless stream of brutal
[00:41.680 --> 00:47.600]  imagery required for war on terror propaganda and that's ISIS executing
[00:47.600 --> 00:54.560]  men women and children killing Christians in mass you name it I've just
[00:54.560 --> 00:58.640]  got hundreds of off-the-charts news articles like this and I don't even
[00:58.640 --> 01:07.080]  know where to start on this Monday 14th of July 2014 worldwide transmission that
[01:07.080 --> 01:11.880]  headline says it all and then there's all these quotes by the Pentagon and
[01:11.880 --> 01:18.040]  others openly admitting this but it's worse than that they've created and
[01:18.040 --> 01:25.840]  fostered and supported and aided and abetted and funded and shepherded
[01:25.840 --> 01:31.920]  ISIS come out in the London Guardian that British SAS was at the forefront of
[01:31.920 --> 01:37.760]  training and commanding them they've got shadow lot imagery they've got
[01:37.760 --> 01:47.360]  everything they've got heat-seeking missiles they've got it all and then it
[01:47.360 --> 01:52.720]  comes out oh yeah the Pentagon says don't turn off their tweet she's everybody
[01:52.720 --> 01:56.600]  goes hey what do you let ISIS operate on YouTube and Twitter and Facebook but
[01:56.600 --> 02:01.560]  you're always banning Alex Jones and other people you're always censoring
[02:01.560 --> 02:05.360]  WorldNet daily you're always censoring Navy SEALs that just put out memes on
[02:05.360 --> 02:12.240]  Benghazi against Obama just an image criticizing Obama but ISIS can operate
[02:12.240 --> 02:18.200]  so they go oh we need that you know it's it's good to demonize them which is
[02:18.200 --> 02:24.360]  actually true they they help create them then they use the threat of them to
[02:24.360 --> 02:29.600]  scare the public in the police state the takeover the stories up on dredgerport.com
[02:29.600 --> 02:34.120]  the left-hand side it's from info wars.com and I meant to get to it
[02:34.120 --> 02:37.960]  yesterday it broke up at the weekend but I never got to it on the Sunday show I'm
[02:37.960 --> 02:45.120]  gonna cover it today homeland security fed swarm small town in bizarre unannounced
[02:45.120 --> 02:49.160]  show of force and then the feds of course won't say why they did it this is
[02:49.160 --> 02:53.640]  back to the old black helicopter days in the mid late 90s where they would just
[02:53.640 --> 02:59.400]  deny they'd been in San Antonio or they deny they've been in Houston I mean
[02:59.400 --> 03:03.200]  sometimes they crash into skyscrapers helicopters blowing up in the city
[03:03.200 --> 03:07.680]  streets and they would go on the news and say nothing crashed conspiracy
[03:07.680 --> 03:13.760]  theorist like Alex Jones are making it up soldier of fortune would cover it and
[03:13.760 --> 03:17.560]  others but they would not admit it was real remember all that well that's what
[03:17.560 --> 03:25.160]  this is now is just pure preparation basically for martial law but instead of
[03:25.160 --> 03:32.400]  having the army of the Marine Corps or a bunch of Air Force MPs in your town now
[03:32.400 --> 03:38.360]  it's just militarized scores of armored vehicles multiple helicopters armored
[03:38.360 --> 03:45.480]  trucks vans and the public going we appreciate them they let the kids go on
[03:45.480 --> 03:52.240]  the helicopters yes they're there acclimating the natives that that's how
[03:52.240 --> 03:59.360]  they see it Charlton Heston there rated a Panama invasion three hour
[03:59.360 --> 04:05.960]  documentary on history channel that aired back in the 90s forget the name of
[04:05.960 --> 04:10.720]  it but somebody could find it it was just search Charlton Heston Panama
[04:10.720 --> 04:16.400]  documentary history channel I might have been discovered channel but in it I
[04:17.600 --> 04:23.720]  remember seeing this documentary when all the black helicopters were to sitting
[04:23.720 --> 04:28.520]  in every major city in many small towns across the country and then I tuned in to
[04:28.520 --> 04:34.360]  see a replay of Charlton Heston and this documentary and he was saying in his
[04:34.360 --> 04:40.760]  great voice over voice to acclimate and prepare the Panamanians so they wouldn't
[04:40.760 --> 04:45.120]  resist from the actual invasion came very much helicopters and troops did
[04:45.120 --> 04:49.240]  touch and goes around the Panamera and Panamanian military to acclimate them
[04:49.240 --> 04:54.400]  through the presence of US forces so when the strike came they would stand
[04:54.400 --> 05:00.080]  down and hesitate long enough to be completely destroyed I began to get into
[05:00.080 --> 05:03.520]  iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get
[05:03.520 --> 05:08.800]  healthy and detoxify most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis

[08:20.680 --> 08:40.320]  heart of the resistance it's Alex Jones globalist think tanks as a North
[08:40.320 --> 08:46.120]  American community will be forged in the fires of conflict and Obama is
[08:46.120 --> 08:50.960]  accelerating his plan to completely collapse our border the crisis has
[08:50.960 --> 08:56.320]  only begun there's a report small lifeless dead children found washed up
[08:56.320 --> 09:04.440]  along the riverbank of the Rio Grande continuing border control agent says
[09:04.440 --> 09:12.080]  diseases coming in we haven't seen in decades like leprosy US propaganda song
[09:12.080 --> 09:19.560]  discouraging death train tops the charts in Central America and that's just like
[09:19.560 --> 09:22.760]  they go in with the drug programs against drugs for kids in school like a
[09:22.760 --> 09:26.640]  dare program every study shows it increases drug use it's the same thing
[09:26.640 --> 09:31.240]  you know don't hop the death train and so people then who are desperate go and
[09:31.240 --> 09:35.040]  hop the death trains that Mexico has already signed a deal with the US and
[09:35.040 --> 09:39.840]  Guatemala on record we're gonna be covering that to ship these people in
[09:39.840 --> 09:46.160]  here and they only charge a few dollars to do it it's organized ladies and
[09:46.160 --> 09:53.640]  gentlemen on record here's the headline Mexico Guatemala fast-track delivery of
[09:53.640 --> 09:58.440]  illegals into the United States that's from world that daily more patrol agents
[09:58.440 --> 10:03.480]  70% of agents being pulled off patrols for paperwork to legalize the illegals
[10:03.480 --> 10:10.920]  and to release them that is just some of what is coming up today on that front
[10:10.920 --> 10:18.200]  border patrol has captured over 27,000 illegal aliens this year alone in
[10:18.200 --> 10:27.680]  non-border Texas County think about that a sign at the entrance to the
[10:27.680 --> 10:33.840]  checkpoint of the US war patrol proudly states the capture of 27,260 legal
[10:33.840 --> 10:38.480]  aliens this year it is interesting to note that the checkpoint is located in
[10:38.480 --> 10:44.320]  Brooks County Texas which is not a border County it is located 80 miles from
[10:44.320 --> 10:47.960]  the Texas Mexico border and it more patrol agents managed to apprehend over
[10:47.960 --> 10:53.400]  27,000 immigrants who have entered the country illegally that represents
[10:53.400 --> 11:01.920]  nearly 150 people every day this year I mean that's how wild all of this is
[11:01.920 --> 11:06.640]  ladies and gentlemen and now you drive through those checkpoints and I've
[11:06.640 --> 11:11.960]  driven through that particular one and I've driven the Alpine checkpoint instead
[11:11.960 --> 11:16.640]  of there being 50 border patrols standing around there there was one both
[11:16.640 --> 11:25.200]  times in the last year one and they just waved you through and again it's not
[11:25.200 --> 11:31.360]  like we have some heavenly constellation of nations to our south
[11:31.360 --> 11:38.000]  Central and South America and Southern North America run from bad to worse and
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.720]  you need to think about the political elite and how out of control they are
[11:41.720 --> 11:48.080]  ladies and gentlemen that they would do something like this you think about that
[11:48.080 --> 11:52.520]  long and hard now separately while we're looking at this crisis when you
[11:52.520 --> 11:59.200]  enter one of these zones one of these end-of-a-cycle periods in history and
[11:59.200 --> 12:03.680]  then you overlay the coming singularity the acceleration of technological
[12:03.680 --> 12:09.680]  development of information the overall entertainment decadence society that the
[12:09.680 --> 12:17.960]  general public is basically under mind control basically victims of you add all
[12:17.960 --> 12:29.920]  of these different factors together and what you basically come to is a flash
[12:29.920 --> 12:34.320]  point and that's why you see ISIS running rampant all over North Africa
[12:34.320 --> 12:39.840]  Central Africa and all of the Middle East into Asia and the stands around
[12:39.840 --> 12:46.440]  Russia that's why you see the overthrow of Ukraine by the West and Russia
[12:46.440 --> 12:50.640]  openly preparing for air campaigns into Ukraine that's the huge announcement
[12:50.640 --> 12:57.920]  today off the chart huge and we've got al-arabia and the rest of the Middle
[12:57.920 --> 13:02.040]  Eastern news basically saying how great it all is that's why you've got the
[13:02.040 --> 13:05.280]  border imploding right now that's why you've got the move away from the dollar
[13:05.280 --> 13:09.640]  right now that's why you've got Homeland Security openly announcing hey
[13:09.640 --> 13:13.720]  we're not for al-Qaeda we're for the Tea Party because this is the strange
[13:13.720 --> 13:19.920]  days strange days have found us strange days have come they're going to
[13:19.920 --> 13:27.360]  destroy us strange days to quote Jim Morrison we have now entered strange
[13:27.360 --> 13:34.720]  days and they're only going to get stranger it's up on info wars dot com
[13:34.720 --> 13:42.680]  right now that TSA lets illegals fly without ID but it integrates with a
[13:42.680 --> 13:48.720]  local newscast but they harass mothers who have milk for their baby you're a
[13:48.720 --> 13:53.600]  mother and a father no criminal record you've got a baby you're flying they're
[13:53.600 --> 13:57.000]  going to make you dump your milk out or drink it in front of them as an active
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.880]  domination by the political class over you the slaves this is the breaking of
[14:01.880 --> 14:06.320]  the American people they've already got the public schools in most areas
[14:06.320 --> 14:11.120]  operating as prison induction centers with the guards the checkpoints the
[14:11.120 --> 14:16.040]  frisking the spies the no free speech the being arrested for drawing a picture
[14:16.040 --> 14:19.520]  of a gun or you're kicked out of school because your neighbors saw you with a
[14:19.520 --> 14:23.480]  Nerf gun in your backyard there's no law against the Nerf gun in your backyard
[14:23.480 --> 14:29.200]  but you're being kicked out of school it's about training you to live in a
[14:29.200 --> 14:35.960]  totalitarian system but how do you train the adults to live under prison
[14:35.960 --> 14:41.240]  conditions you take the middle class who flies the most and the business class
[14:41.240 --> 14:49.960]  and you break their will when you show up to prison or you're being in turn for
[14:49.960 --> 14:55.440]  a longer period of time in jail you get process you take your shoes off and you
[14:55.440 --> 14:59.600]  get patted down and you learn to be humiliated and you get shouted at this
[14:59.600 --> 15:06.240]  is 101 conditioning we're gonna be getting to that newscast I'm breaking it
[15:06.240 --> 15:10.960]  down as well but I first wanted to get to this report that's gone viral over the
[15:10.960 --> 15:17.640]  weekend from info wars calm homeland security fed swarm small town in bizarre
[15:17.640 --> 15:22.760]  unannounced show of force school field besieged by blackhawk chopper swat
[15:22.760 --> 15:28.200]  vehicles other helicopters armored vehicles homeland security agents backed
[15:28.200 --> 15:32.120]  by swat teams armored vehicles and blackhawk helicopters stage a bizarre
[15:32.120 --> 15:37.560]  unannounced show of force in front of a school in a small town of Illinois scenes
[15:37.560 --> 15:42.240]  which will exacerbate concerns about the increasing militarization of u.s. law
[15:42.240 --> 15:48.200]  enforcement residents of Livingston Illinois population 850 were shocked to
[15:48.200 --> 15:53.000]  see agents from homeland security the u.s. Customs and Border Patrol local
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.000]  police agencies swarm a field belonging to school grade children yesterday just
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.520]  so happens that this is near of the county where we interviewed an emergency
[16:02.520 --> 16:07.440]  manager and disguised his voice four years ago that was later confirmed by
[16:07.440 --> 16:11.360]  documents in New York and other states that they were preparing mass graves
[16:11.360 --> 16:18.280]  they were preparing in this one county area of Illinois for one million dead
[16:18.280 --> 16:22.760]  from a bio weapon and telling them the bio weapon is coming not a question of
[16:22.760 --> 16:28.200]  if it when harden your facilities and prepare for the militia during the
[16:28.200 --> 16:33.560]  collapse to blow up your police station and those interviews were picked up it
[16:33.560 --> 16:39.040]  went nationwide people didn't believe it we were then contacted by the cemetery
[16:39.040 --> 16:44.520]  departments in Nevada in Dallas and Rochester New York bunch of places
[16:44.520 --> 16:50.720]  publish those secret documents with the phone numbers of the three states where
[16:50.720 --> 16:58.480]  they had been prepared for millions of dead so it's a giant secret program where
[16:58.480 --> 17:01.600]  they're preparing to release a bio weapon or that might just be the cover and
[17:01.600 --> 17:05.520]  then start a civil war I'm yet to understand the feds are 24 7 training
[17:05.520 --> 17:09.920]  for this and saying the American gun owner is going to have a war with the
[17:09.920 --> 17:16.560]  Pentagon and since I broke all this no bragg just fact it's been in AP Reuters
[17:16.560 --> 17:25.040]  Stars and Stripes Army times Washington Times Forbes Pentagon prepares to fight
[17:25.040 --> 17:31.320]  their main enemy the Tea Party headline they go look it up and again I just
[17:31.320 --> 17:40.160]  harp on this 24 7 because they've gone from this being secret to this now
[17:40.160 --> 17:45.000]  being operational at every major police department level and now they're fanning
[17:45.000 --> 17:55.840]  out to small towns giving them dossiers names who's to be hit and there's
[17:55.840 --> 18:00.600]  enough peer pressure in the military and police that there's a good chance they
[18:00.600 --> 18:05.760]  give the order they're going to come down on the American people like a hammer
[18:05.760 --> 18:11.600]  and then all hell is going to break loose in this country and look you've
[18:11.600 --> 18:14.720]  already seen our government start a war with Russia you've already seen them
[18:14.720 --> 18:18.040]  ship guns into Mexico you've already seen them stand down in Benghazi you've
[18:18.040 --> 18:21.760]  already seen them turn al-Qaeda loose worldwide publicly and not care and in
[18:21.760 --> 18:26.600]  the CFR website say how good al-Qaeda and ISIS are and now al-Arabi is basically
[18:26.600 --> 18:32.960]  endorsing them so al-Qaeda is good illegal aliens can fly without IDs but a
[18:32.960 --> 18:39.440]  mother with milk is bad a mother with milk is bad George Washington is bad
[18:39.440 --> 18:45.400]  second amendment is bad private property is bad freedom is bad if you want to
[18:45.400 --> 18:52.000]  know what's happening ladies and gentlemen it was in an episode of sworn
[18:52.000 --> 19:05.120]  to secrecy that first aired in 1998 July 13th on the history channel sworn to
[19:05.120 --> 19:11.040]  secrecy episode 65 the invasion of Panama narrated by Charlton Heston and in it
[19:11.040 --> 19:15.520]  they talk about how the US acclimated the Panamanians to have helicopters

[23:51.480 --> 23:56.480]  weird get your block at pocket at block at pocket com
[24:12.160 --> 24:16.520]  long before they put troops on the streets after 9-11 major cities like
[24:16.520 --> 24:23.720]  New York Chicago Boston Los Angeles Houston they were having military drills
[24:23.720 --> 24:27.920]  everywhere in many cases we were actually on the ground we would be kept
[24:27.920 --> 24:31.080]  off by the army of the Marines who didn't like what was happening and we
[24:31.080 --> 24:34.600]  would show up and the Marines or army would show up when I made four films on
[24:34.600 --> 24:39.040]  the subject police state films police state 2000 right through police state
[24:39.040 --> 24:44.600]  for the rise of FEMA so four films on it and they would have Marines actually
[24:44.600 --> 24:49.000]  start an army actually go out on the highway and actually start pulling real
[24:49.000 --> 24:54.240]  people out of their cars or they would covertly lease a building and then just
[24:54.240 --> 24:58.440]  blow it up next to a nursing home and then tell the public nothing happened
[24:58.440 --> 25:06.600]  and then I'd show up and they'd have you know guys run out and camo and stick
[25:06.600 --> 25:11.720]  guns to our chest and take our footage I mean this was going on and then I
[25:11.720 --> 25:16.760]  interviewed police chiefs and emergency managers and I mean major police
[25:16.760 --> 25:22.960]  chiefs like the police chief of San Antonio this is in these films and the
[25:22.960 --> 25:27.560]  head emergency manager for Kingsville Thomas Sanchez we got a call and see if
[25:27.560 --> 25:32.080]  he's still alive I mean he was only like 60 something 16 17 years ago I'm sure
[25:32.080 --> 25:36.200]  he's around and boy he got threatened after he came on the show and he was in
[25:36.200 --> 25:40.680]  Vietnam he was in military intelligence and they'd run a takeover like this in
[25:40.680 --> 25:45.200]  Vietnam so he knew what it was he was on my show and he said Clinton is checking
[25:45.200 --> 25:48.920]  I was briefed on it by Delta Force they are preparing to see of a gun
[25:48.920 --> 25:55.400]  confiscation would be operable this is treason we did this in Vietnam this is
[25:55.400 --> 26:01.160]  Phoenix project type stuff imagine I'm sitting there with police chiefs like
[26:01.160 --> 26:06.040]  Ali Philippus who was in army intelligence and so he knew what he was
[26:06.040 --> 26:09.760]  seeing and said this is treason and I was talking to emergency it was because
[26:09.760 --> 26:15.200]  the veterans knew what an authoritarian takeover looks like because they'd been
[26:15.200 --> 26:20.280]  part of it in other countries they'd done it before so they knew what was
[26:20.280 --> 26:25.640]  going on and we're like you're not doing this in America but most people took
[26:25.640 --> 26:31.720]  the money that was under Clinton so the whole project continued under Bush but
[26:31.720 --> 26:36.000]  in different ways as soon as Obama came back in with Eric Holder who ran this
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.720]  back in the 90s it was just right back on track building that Clinton takeover
[26:40.720 --> 26:47.160]  dynasty that they call Clinton Inc. there's a new book out on it basically and
[26:47.160 --> 26:53.960]  so when I harp on this 24-7 it's because people say oh they won't get over the
[26:53.960 --> 26:57.480]  martial law they won't get away they're getting away with open borders they're
[26:57.480 --> 27:02.040]  getting away with funding ISIS that's Al Qaeda they just play a name-change game
[27:02.040 --> 27:07.680]  with you they're getting away with everything
[27:10.560 --> 27:15.760]  and it's all about total domination and you integrated in with this that is so
[27:15.760 --> 27:21.240]  bombshell over the weekend hundreds of bombing raids with helicopters and
[27:21.240 --> 27:25.800]  fighter bombers were launched by the NATO-backed Ukrainian government against
[27:25.800 --> 27:32.800]  Russia Russian ethnic groups in the east and the Ukrainian government says
[27:32.800 --> 27:37.120]  they killed a thousand and now it's thousands more and there are major
[27:37.120 --> 27:45.840]  cities large areas on fire right now this is major war and now suddenly
[27:45.840 --> 27:51.880]  Ukrainian helicopters and jets are being shot down Ukraine came out in
[27:51.880 --> 27:59.440]  agency French press AFP and said Russia shot us down and guess what Russia
[27:59.440 --> 28:04.560]  responded with today in their main state-run media they said yep we're
[28:04.560 --> 28:07.920]  getting ready for targeted strikes we may send in fighter bombers of our own
[28:07.920 --> 28:14.280]  and helicopters get ready and this is full-on war and there's no discussion of
[28:14.280 --> 28:19.760]  it it's all about Germany and Argentina and the 1-0 victory of
[28:19.760 --> 28:28.640]  Deutschland I was downtown last night eating with friends and I like German
[28:28.640 --> 28:32.560]  folks I like everybody but part German I like German culture and all but those

[29:58.400 --> 30:03.840]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[30:03.840 --> 30:07.400]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[30:07.400 --> 30:11.400]  outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[30:11.400 --> 30:15.600]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[30:15.600 --> 30:19.440]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[30:19.440 --> 30:23.600]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand

[35:14.080 --> 35:20.960]  southern Russian region the incident is evidence of a profound escalation of
[35:20.960 --> 35:26.400]  danger for Russian citizens on the Russian territory the diplomat said
[35:26.400 --> 35:31.000]  naturally this action will not be left without a corresponding reaction he said

[36:53.320 --> 36:57.400]  strikes on Ukraine Moscow is considering targeted strikes against Ukraine after
[36:57.400 --> 37:03.120]  shelling cross the border and killed a Russian civilian citing a source close
[37:03.120 --> 37:08.240]  to the Kremlin the respected daily quoted a source is saying that Moscow was
[37:08.240 --> 37:13.040]  considering possibility of targeting retaliatory strikes against Ukraine
[37:13.040 --> 37:18.200]  where escalating clashes Ukraine says has killed more than quote a thousand
[37:18.200 --> 37:23.760]  rebels between pro-Moscow rebels and government troops is threatening to
[37:23.760 --> 37:29.320]  spiral into an all-out civil war over the weekend and again our patience is
[37:29.320 --> 37:35.120]  not limitless it's not a civil war it's already a civil war it's not going to be
[37:35.120 --> 37:41.120]  a civil war it's going to be a regional war and then you've got wars going on in
[37:41.120 --> 37:45.560]  the Middle East and Africa and everywhere else and again who is behind it
[37:45.560 --> 37:54.080]  the globalist are triggering at all I want to hear from military and former
[37:54.080 --> 37:59.480]  military to get your analysis and your take on what you see unfolding
[37:59.480 --> 38:04.320]  geopolitically how it all ties together because every time I do this we get a
[38:04.320 --> 38:08.240]  lot of interesting points and angles from contractors military people
[38:08.240 --> 38:12.200]  executives you name it that have been in Saudi Arabian work there been in Iraq
[38:12.200 --> 38:17.520]  been in Afghanistan been in Ukraine been in Russia and know the parties and know
[38:17.520 --> 38:23.600]  what's happening but bottom line Russia is being tied down and prepared for
[38:23.600 --> 38:29.360]  regional wars and they're also launching the ISIS type Al Qaeda people all over
[38:29.360 --> 38:34.360]  Chechnya and other areas to further destabilize Russia and Russia is going
[38:34.360 --> 38:44.200]  to end up responding militarily and may start bombardments of the capital Kiev
[38:44.200 --> 38:51.280]  and then NATO has said they will respond against Russian forces and then the
[38:51.280 --> 38:57.040]  Russians have said they'll use nuclear weapons in the region and you go in just
[38:57.040 --> 39:05.200]  a matter of minutes once all this starts once Russia starts hitting Kiev or other
[39:05.200 --> 39:12.080]  areas other military bases in the nation responding if Kiev escalates back then
[39:12.080 --> 39:18.960]  in a matter of minutes you could go into a nuclear war situation and when I was
[39:18.960 --> 39:28.200]  walking back from the break room getting a cup of coffee just six seven minutes
[39:28.200 --> 39:32.440]  ago I was thinking my god I live right in the middle of Texas with all these
[39:32.440 --> 39:38.240]  military bases in circling me and I just realized that if there's a nuclear war
[39:38.240 --> 39:45.760]  there's probably let's not exaggerate I would guess a hundred cruise missiles
[39:45.760 --> 39:51.160]  are probably pointed at the area I'm at in Texas probably dozens of ICBM topol
[39:51.160 --> 39:57.280]  m's they can carry up to 20 warheads apiece I'm being targeted you're being
[39:57.280 --> 40:03.360]  targeted if you live near a military base by scores of warheads right now and I
[40:03.360 --> 40:13.240]  just hope it falls right on top of me then I mean I don't hope that happens
[40:13.240 --> 40:20.800]  but I've studied the criminology of governments of Hitler and Napoleon and
[40:20.800 --> 40:26.240]  so many others and the elite running things just they're just out of control
[40:26.240 --> 40:29.640]  they just want to destroy everything they really do I mean look at them they
[40:29.640 --> 40:35.840]  hate anything good they hate a breastfeeding mother and search her and
[40:35.840 --> 40:42.680]  strip search babies but then let illegal aliens fly without any IDs they let
[40:42.680 --> 40:47.480]  Saudi Arabians come in and then I go through the searches they get bypassed
[40:47.480 --> 40:51.400]  because the Saudi Arabian government demands it but American citizens get
[40:51.400 --> 40:56.560]  our genitals grabbed it's all just a giant fraud all of it and the American
[40:56.560 --> 41:01.280]  people on average are broken and are weak and they want it they like it they
[41:01.280 --> 41:07.320]  say hey buddy comply comply with total destruction of everything we hold dear
[41:07.320 --> 41:12.800]  and so not admitting how evil things are letting them by successive approximation
[41:12.800 --> 41:24.440]  by titrating the dose build up the level of cultural poisoning to where we'll
[41:24.440 --> 41:30.040]  put up with anything oh we'll never pass all bomb of care with death panels and
[41:30.040 --> 41:36.960]  taxes on people making less than $15,000 a year and rationing of care this bill
[41:36.960 --> 41:42.360]  so horrible there's no way they'll pass it they passed it didn't they and now the
[41:42.360 --> 41:46.200]  $5,000 fines are coming in and now you're getting cut from 40 hours of 25
[41:46.200 --> 41:50.520]  hours and now you're going bankrupt and now you're and guess what nobody got
[41:50.520 --> 41:56.640]  in trouble did that they're busting tens of thousands of illegals every week to
[41:56.640 --> 42:03.000]  major cities across the country hundreds of thousands a month and it's going to
[42:03.000 --> 42:06.920]  become a giant crisis and then they're going to say those of us that aren't
[42:06.920 --> 42:11.280]  for total legalization we caused it when total legalization will bring in the
[42:11.280 --> 42:14.840]  next crop for total legalization but because we say two plus two equals four
[42:14.840 --> 42:20.200]  they'll point at us and laugh at us and you're now seeing that this is the
[42:20.200 --> 42:27.500]  madness of government the madness of Nero the madness of Caligula the madness
[42:27.500 --> 42:44.280]  of Montezuma the madness the madness this is what elites do they destroy
[42:44.280 --> 42:49.680]  everything at the end because they've got a bunch of autocratic scum working
[42:49.680 --> 42:55.320]  for them who are lazy and basically allow the elite to do these type of things
[42:55.320 --> 43:00.140]  there's a lot of other factors the public is drunk on entertainment raised
[43:00.140 --> 43:09.900]  in front of television sets and has no idea what's even going on and then you've
[43:09.900 --> 43:13.820]  got a bunch of the other establishment people who are just all into different
[43:13.820 --> 43:19.940]  forms of weirdnesses it's the decline of a country it's the decline of an
[43:19.940 --> 43:25.740]  empire is the decline of a world and you notice homeland security drills 24 7
[43:25.740 --> 43:29.500]  they're done with the primer of al-qaeda that was the excuse to set it all up to
[43:29.500 --> 43:35.540]  fight veterans Christians gun owners libertarians conservatives
[43:35.540 --> 43:46.980]  constitutionalist because they want total power to do whatever they want and
[43:46.980 --> 43:52.780]  they know anyone who has even a inkling of justice in their heart and mind who
[43:52.780 --> 44:00.180]  have who has even a sparkle of a desire to be free must be eradicated and if
[44:00.180 --> 44:08.940]  they have their way we will be and the nightmare will come true because we let
[44:08.940 --> 44:15.100]  monsters run things and let monsters break our will I'd like to hear from you
[44:15.100 --> 44:21.060]  about their military police I don't need to hear from you to know the plan I
[44:21.060 --> 44:24.940]  know the plan the plans public but it's accelerated and moved into such high
[44:24.940 --> 44:27.780]  gear do you disagree with me that they're getting ready to stage a false
[44:27.780 --> 44:32.500]  flag which might be an imploded economy might be the tens of millions coming in
[44:32.500 --> 44:36.740]  over the border that we know that's the false flag we know that's engineer but
[44:36.740 --> 44:45.260]  are there more false flags to come is turning ISIS loose with stinger missiles
[44:45.260 --> 44:49.300]  tens of thousands of them is that the false flag I think it's all the false
[44:49.300 --> 44:56.180]  flags I think it's a cluster of false flags a wave or waves of false flags a
[44:56.180 --> 45:04.740]  great global crises conveyor belt to bring in world government you have to
[45:04.740 --> 45:09.580]  destroy the old order and the old order as bad as it's been has checks and
[45:09.580 --> 45:16.740]  balances and work was valued and and the family was valued and self-defense was
[45:16.740 --> 45:23.100]  valued and common sense had some value all of that is now being swept away and
[45:23.100 --> 45:31.580]  in place of it raw naked government power run by you Genesis that have a
[45:31.580 --> 45:41.420]  deep lustful hate for humanity and a lust to exercise raw totalitarian control
[45:41.420 --> 45:51.380]  freak power over us every secret demon turned loose in the hearts of man every
[45:51.380 --> 46:03.460]  profanity every perversion we're taught perversion is sexual only in nature and
[46:03.460 --> 46:08.220]  that's another deception of the system to obsess on sex all day when the
[46:08.220 --> 46:13.540]  perversions of domination and corruption and psychopathic and sociopathic
[46:13.540 --> 46:19.420]  behavior that's the real perversion and we have very perverse people in charge
[46:19.420 --> 46:26.740]  right now who lust to bring this country down who want to dominate this
[46:26.740 --> 46:35.820]  nation and the world everywhere they're in charge they turn al-qaeda loose to
[46:35.820 --> 46:39.420]  just slaughter and slit the throats of every Christian man woman and child they
[46:39.420 --> 46:44.700]  get their dirty hands on and you won't hear a word about it from all these big
[46:44.700 --> 47:03.900]  glitterbug churches all right toll free number to join us 800 259 92 31 800 259
[47:03.900 --> 47:10.220]  92 31 is this the megastorm is this the beginning of the coming of the total
[47:10.220 --> 47:14.740]  world government built on the back of crises on the ashes of the old
[47:14.740 --> 47:20.460]  republics and the answer is yes the globalists are back in the news today
[47:20.460 --> 47:26.700]  saying this is part of a North American Union this crisis as they said in 2006
[47:26.700 --> 47:34.740]  now eight years ago in vamp Canada they openly said there we will use border
[47:34.740 --> 47:42.220]  crises to bring this in Rex 84 and I know that for many of you that are new
[47:42.220 --> 47:48.700]  listeners I might as well be speaking in some verbalized hieroglyphical
[47:48.700 --> 47:58.660]  screed on ancient jungle covered walls but for those that know history this is
[47:58.660 --> 48:07.860]  written in a clear bold hand that spells a great time of misfortune and doom and
[48:07.860 --> 48:16.980]  I'm not being a negative person I simply wish that we didn't have to go
[48:16.980 --> 48:23.660]  through this I wish by telling people what's happening that this didn't have
[48:23.660 --> 48:31.820]  to unfold a car pulled out in front of me yesterday and I over compensated and
[48:31.820 --> 48:38.060]  went up on the curb and was only I was about 30 feet away from pedestrians
[48:38.060 --> 48:44.700]  walking and I quickly went back onto the street and didn't run over them but it
[48:44.700 --> 48:49.580]  wasn't that I was being pessimistic when I moved out of the car's way hit the
[48:49.580 --> 48:55.620]  curb went up on it and had had a wreck in many years thank God saw there were
[48:55.620 --> 49:00.780]  people walking and hurriedly said well I guess I got to go back into that car
[49:00.780 --> 49:05.260]  went back down off the curb only got one tire up on it so even about would have
[49:05.260 --> 49:07.380]  got to where the people were I probably wouldn't hit him was they were about six
[49:07.380 --> 49:11.420]  feet over it was a big sidewalk you know six feet over about 30 feet down but I
[49:11.420 --> 49:14.460]  made this public decision I just got turned back into that car didn't even
[49:14.460 --> 49:17.620]  look that's all those people and by that time the car had swerved back out of the
[49:17.620 --> 49:21.260]  lane so I was able to get back in without hitting them or the people and it
[49:21.260 --> 49:25.940]  was quick action that kept me from you know having the record running over the
[49:25.940 --> 49:35.500]  people and I literally thank God that I didn't hurt somebody but the issue here
[49:35.500 --> 49:41.500]  is that about have been a denial about a hesitated something bad would have
[49:41.500 --> 49:46.980]  happened and so that's why I'm being so scary because it is scary Russia says
[49:46.980 --> 49:51.700]  they may start bombarding Ukraine with fighter bombers NATO has said they will
[49:51.700 --> 49:58.500]  hit Russia Russia will then respond with nuclear weapons and a lot of people
[49:58.500 --> 50:02.460]  say oh it's all stage that won't happen bull it's not all states there are three
[50:02.460 --> 50:07.300]  power blocks there the Chinese the Russians and then the United States
[50:07.300 --> 50:11.060]  England and the EU that's the big dominant group and the end of the
[50:11.060 --> 50:14.500]  Chinese and the Russians use the globalist technologies of control they're
[50:14.500 --> 50:18.780]  just as bad in many respects but there are different power blocks and they've
[50:18.780 --> 50:26.020]  all infiltrated each other as well at the highest levels but this is real and
[50:26.020 --> 50:30.220]  the fact that the public thinks nothing bad can happen and our ruling class
[50:30.220 --> 50:34.300]  thinks nothing will happen there's a reason NATO never did stuff like this
[50:34.300 --> 50:43.420]  with Russia before because Russia will end up attack and they drive this on
[50:43.420 --> 50:47.540]  888 and Russia rolled nukes in the Ukraine I mean into Georgians that
[50:47.540 --> 50:52.060]  we're about to attack I mean they told pull back I don't know if they'll pull
[50:52.060 --> 50:56.820]  back now and you know Russia's racist that that's why they need to be nuked

[55:03.300 --> 55:08.860]  developed the very simple but incredibly pure high-quality products like
[55:08.860 --> 55:13.060]  supermal vitality dietary supplement that if I don't take it I totally feel
[55:13.060 --> 55:18.260]  the difference and the new X2 super survival shield true nascent iodine I
[55:18.260 --> 55:26.380]  take it morning I take it noon and I take it night and I just spilt it but the
[55:26.380 --> 55:31.460]  point is that it is you can take it straight up or in a water like I do a
[55:31.460 --> 55:36.180]  lot of times and it just absolutely gives me so much energy these purified
[55:36.180 --> 55:44.380]  concentrated herbs non-gmo cold-pressed that are in the supermal vitality and
[55:44.380 --> 55:47.540]  the superfilm my old vitality that we now have again you've heard the rave
[55:47.540 --> 55:54.860]  reviews and I end up mixing the supermal vitality in water with the survival
[55:54.860 --> 55:58.260]  shield and again consult your physician before you use this this isn't a good
[55:58.260 --> 56:02.180]  joke this is the real deal you may go through some detoxing at first when you
[56:02.180 --> 56:07.780]  first start taking the nascent iodine but the fact is it's the good halogen the
[56:07.780 --> 56:12.100]  system puts in the bad halogens takes out the good halogen you replace it it's
[56:12.100 --> 56:16.660]  been life-changing for me and regardless you're funding the operation so get
[56:16.660 --> 56:22.100]  your nascent iodine today nobody else has got it from the rare earth crystals the
[56:22.100 --> 56:27.140]  deep earth crystals the other iodine out there is from seaweed which is fine but
[56:27.140 --> 56:32.180]  this stuff is totally pure and goes right in to your blood and just has an
[56:32.180 --> 56:36.100]  amazing effect we have the old survival shield that isn't strong available as
[56:36.100 --> 56:41.740]  well but the crystals in a beaker literally turn to purple gas that's how
[56:41.740 --> 56:44.460]  pure they are if you know about iodine it's just unbelievable we were able to
[56:44.460 --> 56:49.220]  get hold of this so I'm gonna bottom's up right now
[56:50.340 --> 56:55.580]  life-changing well this is done for me in the last year taking it and only the
[56:55.580 --> 57:02.820]  last three four months or so taking the x2 and of course I built up to the x2 as
[57:02.820 --> 57:07.060]  well it's kind of like the analogy of drinking beer when you're in college and
[57:07.060 --> 57:10.180]  then you know moving on to whiskey that's kind of a bad analogy because
[57:10.180 --> 57:17.940]  that's bad for you the point is is that if you'll just take the challenge and
[57:17.940 --> 57:22.660]  order a bottle of it it funds the operation and then you'll take it and
[57:22.660 --> 57:25.980]  then we had nothing but positive reviews with the iodine you've heard them
[57:25.980 --> 57:31.700]  you've seen them you will obviously see what I'm talking about if your
[57:31.700 --> 57:37.420]  experience is like almost everybody else's I mean I got a hand to the hippies
[57:37.420 --> 57:42.540]  I remember the hippies growing up and you know reading literature always
[57:42.540 --> 57:45.220]  about how great iodine is and how important it is to rub it on your skin
[57:45.220 --> 57:49.220]  on women's breasts so they don't get breast cancer and stuff like that and I
[57:49.220 --> 57:54.060]  just roll my eyes at them you know iodine iodine schmiadine but now I

[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:33.620]  recap the breaking news Moscow considering targeted strikes on Ukraine
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:39.020]  attacking openly because Ukraine is now bombing and killing thousands in their
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:43.780]  own words right on the Russian border now attacking into Russia was shelling
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:48.460]  it's just it's wild meanwhile our borders being collapsed by design the
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:53.340]  very same George Soros is on record he's bragged that he's behind the open
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:57.100]  borders here and Ukraine I need somebody Paul Watson Steve Watson Kurt
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:04.340]  Nemo and on Salazar Kit Daniels one of our writers to to to write something
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:09.380]  about that about how Soros and the authoritarian left are behind global
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:17.140]  destabilization I mean they're they are supervillains from a James Bond movie
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:23.420]  all right I said I'd shut up go to your calls go to Shane MP Scott Ian Adam
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:26.180]  this is your short segment I'll get to everybody on the on that's on hold in
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:29.860]  the next segment for sure but let's go to Shane right now Shane in Florida US
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:34.740]  Army am I right do you think to be concerned about the global escalation
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:38.900]  we're seeing it's obviously a global destabilization program what do you think
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:44.900]  the political class hope to gain out of this well you know you're preaching the
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:50.140]  choir obviously I agree with you that's why I'm calling in I was thinking about
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:53.620]  yesterday what you asked what do I think their goal is with some of this and
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:57.180]  let's just just specifically with the flood of illegals coming across the
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:02.060]  southwest border anytime that the military is going to do anything or any
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:06.580]  any machine has to be tested you have to validate it our female camps aren't
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:12.420]  validated no that's it I mean they said in the 80s they would use opening the
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:17.020]  borders up to create a Constitution suspending crisis to get my emergency
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:21.580]  camps approved and primed and so no they're actually carrying out Rex 84
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:27.460]  that's another headline Obama is carrying out Rex 84 Constitution
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:31.940]  suspension plan and we can reprint the Miami Herald articles from the 80s and
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:36.740]  show the plan that you're right they're doing it a co-opted political restoration
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:42.180]  would be in order for them they need to pull they need to co-opt a political
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:47.540]  restoration and at the same time get Americans including the people we think
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:53.500]  right now are patriots to rationalize more of a paper's please mentality and
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:58.300]  voter ID laws I listen I don't have any exactly exactly and they're like Ron Paul
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:02.140]  said the fence is for the American people not for the illegals they'll
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:05.140]  claim they're going to put all this stuff in for the illegals now and it
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:10.300]  won't be for them look at how the TSA is ordered to let the illegals in but not
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:14.500]  let citizens fly exactly well and then the other thing too I just want to let
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:17.460]  you know you know I don't want to waste the time that one other good point I've
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.620]  got for you you know I got out of the military a lot of why because of this
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:24.660]  stuff you know what you're saying what other guys are saying like you I woke a
[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:28.020]  lot of people up in my unit I've called you a couple times you know and and
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:31.140]  I've had a little free time lately to call you but I'm telling you right now I
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:34.860]  mean it's fire it's fire and so that by least my you have my guys a lot of my
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:39.380]  guys touch other people a lot of former special forces guys were pilots with me
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:44.260]  I flew patches they became pilots it's not like they don't talk to all their
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:48.380]  special ops guys let me ask you this are they aware of what's happening yeah
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:51.740]  yeah they're absolutely where I mean it's on fire on social media and stuff
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:57.420]  no one less and less people are afraid to be talking I was very alone in 2008
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:02.660]  9 and I'm not so much alone anymore and so that's good that's a good thing so I
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:06.980]  just want to give a positive no I agree with you there's a huge awakening most
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:10.340]  police I talked to her awake that's why we've got to be important you know it's
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:13.940]  very important not to alienate the police which the globalists want us to do
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:17.980]  they have the police do things that are bad and accentuate bad things they're
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:21.140]  doing to create an us against them mentality we need to reach out the
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:26.100]  police we've done it the military I'm just wondering how the establishment
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:29.580]  thinks they're going to get away with this because I've looked at all the
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:33.780]  angles Shane and I don't see them at the end of the day getting away with this
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:38.900]  get ready to feed your neighbor that would be the only way I can see I mean
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:42.660]  the people down here in southern Florida down around where I'm at Fort Pierce
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:46.940]  with lots of local farmers markets they're not gonna let this happen they're
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:49.940]  gonna feed their neighbor does that mean they're gonna let themselves just take
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:53.220]  an advantage of no but I mean there's a lot of people talking I've talked to
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:59.060]  local police law enforcement good now people aren't getting ready their nuts

[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:27.780]  well the highest-ranking nsa whistleblower to go public mr. benning called
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:35.340]  the london guardian yesterday in a cover story that the nsa is set up to
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:40.660]  control and subvert the u.s. population and to politically dominate and control
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:45.460]  and to understand future trends so that select intel can be given to select
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:51.620]  corporations to be able to undercut their domestic competition rex 84 short
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:56.340]  for readiness exercise 84 was a classified scenario and drill developed
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:59.460]  by the united states federal government to suspend the united states
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:04.100]  constitution declare martial law place military commanders in charge of the
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:08.980]  state and local governments this is from the miami herald and detain large
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:13.460]  numbers of american citizens who are deemed to be national security threats
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:18.620]  in the event that the president declares a state of national emergency the
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:23.540]  planned states events causing such a declaration would be widespread u.s.
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:27.820]  opposition to a u.s. military invasion abroad such as the united states was to
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:31.780]  directly invade central america to combat with the government perceived as
[01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:36.340]  subversive activities the plan also authorized military to direct order
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:41.180]  movements of civilian populations at state and regional levels into work
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:48.020]  brigades and again i'm reading from wikipedia which i don't go off of they
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:51.900]  can put false stuff in there but usually it's accurate where you go to it is in
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:58.420]  the bibliography which is the christian science monitor university of chicago
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:07.940]  press you know major publications congressional record miami herald
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:12.700]  things like that but i've already gone to the microfilm and actually pulled
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:22.060]  these articles myself cindy morning herald house dot gov to make my police state films
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:28.180]  i'm going right to your calls now in mp scott adam greg and others but the issue
[01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:34.220]  is no one is saying this but us and i don't like that no one is pointing out
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:39.300]  that rex 84 was a plan to have the borders implode and use central and
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:44.460]  south american influx through mexico into the southwest as a reason to suspend
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:52.700]  the constitution and it all clicked a few weeks ago that yes this is staged and
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:59.180]  that yes obama's shipping them in that's confirmed and that that's the goal that
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:04.340]  the next mega wave that comes in tens of millions that's going to break down every
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:08.340]  major city and county it's going to be hellish is going to let them bring in a
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:16.820]  giant industrial level martial law takeover here's the headline rex 84 ronald
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:23.940]  reagan's plan to declare martial law and imprison americans you know i'm not
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:27.580]  defending ronald reagan because he was pretty much a puppet especially after he
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:31.980]  got shot but technically if you study it reagan just was like sure national
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:37.020]  security do whatever you need to pentagon it was a pentagon think tank ran
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:43.580]  corporation plan transcending ronald reagan and the point is is it's been
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:49.100]  picked up by obama it was jimmy carter who actually started it with fema in
[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:54.420]  79 with who was ignited brzezinski so again i'm not even defending the
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:58.060]  republicans they're into it to their eyeballs with all over north and the
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:02.620]  rest of it the point is it's the democrats came up with this they're the
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:07.060]  dominant party they run the show the republicans just are basically democrats
[01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:10.860]  that play the part of conservatives so they can keep taking over that's why
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:16.540]  they win it's loyal opposition now we're going to go to as i said ian adam
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:19.860]  scott mp greg and others i just want to reintroduce here
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:25.020]  moscow considering targeted strikes that's from french news agency on
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:33.540]  ukraine it's an itaar toss official russian state-run media the ukrainians
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:36.900]  brag they've killed over a thousand people in air raids last two days and
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:41.500]  are now been caught shelling into russian territory not just russian held
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:46.700]  ukraine a russian dominated ukraine in the east this could turn into a large
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:51.340]  reward anytime obviously you know that it's a big deal pentagon and cia want
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:55.300]  to keep ices tweeting we're going to be breaking that down it's now mainstream
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:59.660]  news that ices is being commanded by saudi arabian british nato and u.s.
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:05.620]  intelligence forces they're being given a top-down satellite look they've been
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:08.980]  given the equipment everything this is hot reason and it doesn't matter because
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:12.980]  you know the tea party's the terrorists you heard holder over the weekend again
[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:17.940]  said it's the tea party keeps him up at night have you figured this out yet
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:23.020]  you're living in a movie folks they think you're that dumb that they would
[01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:27.580]  openly fund al-qaeda take women's breast milk when they fly and let illegal
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:32.100]  aliens fly without ides that's in the news today we have a newscast coming up

[01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:43.220]  to again the others go ahead sir yeah well i just want to stop explaining the
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:48.260]  whole thing about african right i mean that was what my bro did home you know
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:53.740]  throw names out there they were up to country s you know rolling and you know
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:58.500]  collecting data mining all that stuff off you know doing all that fun kind of
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:01.620]  stuff you know because that's what we do is we just go ahead and we just pick up
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:07.140]  fingers and everybody pie yeah i'm having trouble making a lot of what you're
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:12.820]  saying out i can you maybe get closer to your phone sorry about that yes i'm
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:17.460]  close to now yeah now i was just saying uh we uh as far as african goes i mean
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:22.740]  uh 2011 we were up the coast of uh i won't say the country name for
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:29.180]  opposite reasons obviously um now we uh we go there we data mine check out what
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:32.140]  they were saying on the satellite phones we had you know interpreters on the boat
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:37.300]  all that stuff i mean we just we we just are such an imperialist nation now
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:43.220]  we're just sticking our finger in everybody's eye and funding extremist
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:47.860]  everywhere so they can take our liberty uh it's immoral to overthrow ucraine with
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:52.740]  george soros and then claim it was an election when the guy wasn't elected and
[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:56.900]  then to start killing ethnic russians all over the country and then to start a
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:15:01.460]  war with russia and people say well why are you for russia no i'm for survival
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:08.580]  i'm for not starting fights and what does your gut tell you what's going on here
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:12.900]  uh it's just more that's just the more things change the more they remain the
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:16.100]  same guy don't even get me started on store i mean you went and funded an
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:20.180]  envelope for god's sake i mean come on that's right the un doesn't just have
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:24.660]  him as an ngo the un has them as a sponsored ngo and now they've got a
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:28.500]  big judge in australia saying pedophilia is okay and that we're
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:32.260]  basically a pedophobic so the new thing will be
[01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:36.500]  pedophiles coming out of the closet and and you know you're hateful
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.940]  you and at the public schools if you don't want to pedophile you know
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:44.820]  having sex with your five-year-old i mean that's where this is going
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:48.020]  i believe that scares me because i i've got a kid going through the public school
[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:51.540]  system now i don't know that that's up and wrote on i'm down here but i don't
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:55.620]  know what goes on what are other folks in the navy saying about the stuff
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:16:00.100]  that's going on well i mean i from i had spent a lot
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:04.420]  since i've been with him with most of them i'm firing this thing now but i can
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:07.060]  tell you i know a couple of guys actually turned me on so he's listening to
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:10.900]  Ron Paul and uh and let's do what he had to say and then i learned about you
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:16.100]  actually through my my girlfriend so well that's awesome and
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:19.460]  do you agree because i mean i mean the default is if russia attacks
[01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:23.780]  ukraine if ukraine fights back with any type of heavy armaments
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:27.780]  um the the russians have have said before they'll use nukes
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:32.260]  uh as policy do you think that's rhetoric by the
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:36.900]  russians that they would use tactical nuclear weapons on ukraine and armor
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:40.100]  it could be it could very well be i mean that's the same time i'm pretty sure
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:43.140]  we've got at least five or six drugs sitting in the cask and see right now
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:46.420]  pretty much go right ahead go ahead and make our day you know
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:51.460]  oh i know yeah they got missile cruisers there with nukes off the russian coast
[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:55.700]  uh it's it's incredible and they've got their their boats and their cruise
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:58.820]  missiles ready it is just a real disaster i appreciate your
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:03.140]  call but see the callers said we've got boats saying
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:05.860]  make our day
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:11.860]  but we're attacking russia george soros brags he launched this
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:16.820]  this is immoral a nazi collaborator who's still alive
[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:20.900]  running the democratic party trying to shut down free speech in america
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:24.180]  admits they started the overthrow of ukraine
[01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:27.860]  to put something even worse in i mean it's just unbelievable adam you're on the
[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:32.420]  air i'm then we'll go to as i said mp scott and greg go ahead adam
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:37.300]  hi alex um yeah i'm a computer security professional i work in the financial
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:42.020]  services industry i work a lot with the credit card networks and banks
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:45.300]  all over the united states the central and south america
[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:49.220]  and i don't think that people really realize how dangerous
[01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:54.580]  uh bringing 30 40 50 million undocumented individuals in the united
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:58.900]  states really is from an economic standpoint not only are they going to
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:02.820]  be sucking off of the government teeth and you know dwindling your resources
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:05.220]  that way but they're also going to be sending all
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:09.140]  of their money home well to their real home what they consider their home
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:12.020]  and i can tell you from the industry that i am in that
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.620]  you know anybody over the age of 16 can walk into a corner store and get an
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:20.180]  international united states dollar prepaid these are a master card
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:24.340]  that they can then use to send money across international borders
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:28.340]  without any oversight from any of the financial institutions as long as it's
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:32.420]  under a thousand dollars a day nobody pays any attention well if you've got
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:37.460]  you know 20 million mules sending a thousand dollars a day back to the drug
[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:41.540]  cartels that's a lot of money
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:46.100]  well you just hit the nail on the proverbial head there
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:49.780]  the democrats for a long time akron and others got caught doing it used
[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:53.140]  children and teenagers as criminal cutouts
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:57.380]  criminal groups have always used teenagers uh as their operatives for a
[01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:02.660]  lot of reasons not just child soldiers and that's what this is is a
[01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:05.860]  total mafia takeover and the democrats have been caught
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:10.740]  using and the republicans working with them to do it uh illegal aliens homes
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:13.860]  to launder money through and to get fake tax returns
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:17.460]  so yes you have this total surveillance system for the american people
[01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:21.460]  and mothers with milk can't fly but illegals can walk right through
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:25.860]  because they're the black market cutout used by the shadow government not just
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:28.660]  by the drug cartels
[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:33.140]  absolutely and um these people are arriving in the united states without
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:37.460]  any real documentation they receive a console matricula or a
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:41.460]  an id card from the american government and as soon as you get an american
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:46.020]  government id card of any nature um you can go open a bank account
[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:49.380]  and just beyond that i mean the banks are accepting console matricula that
[01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:52.580]  comes from the mexican consulate and they'll hand those out uh in
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:56.340]  crackerjack boxes it's you're absolutely right great points okay

[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:19.620]  and the destruction of the constitution but a friend and patriot has

[01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:35.860]  on the escalation with russia and what they think about what's happening to

[01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:55.460]  breakdown on what's happening alexa basically what i'm looking at here and
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:59.060]  stuff is through the border bringing the uh legal immigrants to the border it's
[01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:02.740]  kind of a sideline in a in a central polish flag what i'd say to keep
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:06.820]  her minds off what's really going to happen and basically what is really
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:09.860]  going to happen is that if you want to take out the declaration and
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:13.140]  everything and stuff trust me they're going to attack
[01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:16.740]  washington dc either by nuke or whatever it's going to make it look like the
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:20.100]  russian said it no it's not going to be the russians are dead it can be
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:24.260]  like 9 11 what we did
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:28.020]  sir no no i hear you and in fact they've transferred so much power to
[01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:34.100]  unelected bureaucracies that they could nuke uh the congress during a state of
[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:37.220]  the union or something i agree and then bring in total
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:40.340]  marshal law saying the government's been wiped out
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:44.660]  got it right there you're on it i i'm in i still i'm i'm i'm x special forces
[01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:48.100]  military i've only been out a few years but i keep in contact lucky there's a
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:51.780]  rebellion going inside the military and the police right now they
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:54.260]  want to do what they're doing they're being told
[01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:57.620]  they're they're also just talk about obama run the third
[01:25:57.620 --> 01:26:02.500]  uh uh uh term they can him a king later on with all the people who come in the
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:06.180]  different nations but they destroy washington they take it out
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:09.220]  which they plan on doing there'll be no social security checks there'll be no
[01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:11.860]  money no no it's going to be chaos completely
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:15.540]  marshal law already be set in but when they go to reboot again obama's not
[01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:18.820]  going to be dead and he's not going to leave he's not going anywhere at the
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:23.380]  vote him back in he'll vote him back in his king this is this is the most
[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:28.180]  ambiguous perplexing thing i've ever heard of in my life
[01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:31.460]  but i see it is true you know i watched the movie you talked about
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:34.340]  dr strangelove look at that alex you were right
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:37.540]  man there's something like that's going to happen
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:41.380]  and i believe that's because stanley cubrick and i actually know some of his
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:45.380]  family and but even given inside info that i'm not allowed to repeat
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:49.140]  but but the whole which is incredible i mean because the family so
[01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:53.780]  reclusive uh and people tell me this incredible stuff and i can't repeat it
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:57.300]  it's very frustrating but the point is what i can say is
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:00.740]  you notice they talk about the bland corporation that's the ran corporation
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:05.300]  all those people in that movie were basically real people in real things
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:09.380]  that almost happened and so that was basically stanley cubrick
[01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:12.740]  with his own mind and his own understanding but talking to experts
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:16.420]  warning people and so they make a joke about fluoride and the water in the
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:20.980]  film but it's actually real and and so cubrick was actually
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:26.340]  warning people it's very very heavy and the good news is we can stop all this
[01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:31.540]  if there's an understanding of it but the political elite want total power
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:37.540]  total control now and if we don't back them off
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:40.820]  they will go for it all i appreciate your call
[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:44.740]  i appreciate all your concerns out there
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:48.100]  that's the point about false flags they got they got alcada running
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:52.420]  they've got a war with russia there can be a real flag
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:56.980]  by a false flag you've got you could hit dc you could have the dollar die which
[01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:59.860]  is starting to happen you've got the borders imploding
[01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:03.460]  they're just hitting us on every front scott in michigan then jerry then greg
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:07.300]  scott you're on the air are the revolution and you are definitely the tip
[01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:12.340]  of the spear i did have one problem with the story
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:16.660]  that leon macadoo did on the palestinian children
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:21.620]  i totally agree that the world doesn't care at all about palestinian children
[01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:24.340]  they don't care at all about the palestinian people
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:28.660]  but in her article she said that the israeli israelites
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:33.540]  have a right to be scared and they don't they're the occupying invading force
[01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:38.100]  standing on palestinian land while the palestinians fire rockets from gaza
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:41.380]  into palestine they have no right to be scared
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:45.540]  you're an occupying invading force if palestine was firing
[01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:51.300]  rockets from palestine into israel sir scott here's the deal we don't screen
[01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:54.580]  calls and we should have a debate about the israel
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:58.500]  palestinian crisis sometime it's a very complex issue from my perspective
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:02.980]  but we're specifically talking about false flags the open border the ukraine
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:06.900]  escalation i want to hear from military
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:11.460]  specifically would their take on what they think the globalist overall plan
[01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:14.580]  is to bring up different angles like that last caller did
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:18.740]  because if i once a week say hey i want people to call in on this subject
[01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:22.020]  and then i'll let people call in on other subjects no one will listen to me
[01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:27.060]  and then we won't be on that subject so i tell you what i'll do
[01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:30.900]  i appreciate your call scott we'll go through these calls from greg jerry and

[01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:41.700]  had a boil coming on we could open the phones up for a discussion of the
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:45.460]  palestinian israel situation and take calls on that subject
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:48.820]  but watch folks will call in on every subject but that

[01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:36.340]  by the military police the the bureaucracy i saw an article yesterday
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:40.340]  out of england where there's a rebellion by the government class
[01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:46.020]  against the police state over there people are really starting to understand
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:50.740]  the reason police states aren't good the reason tyrannies aren't good
[01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:54.420]  they destroy stability they destroy prosperity they're scary
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:57.620]  it's not al-qaeda that's scary that's globalist run
[01:34:57.620 --> 01:35:00.660]  it is the police state it is the new world order
[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:04.740]  it is the globalists that run our bank accounts that run our lives that control
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:07.860]  the nuclear weapons it's people like george soros
[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:12.820]  a bizarre nazi collaborator running almost every aspect of our lives
[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:17.460]  that of the enemy it's billa melinda gates openly funding the anti-gun groups
[01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:21.380]  openly funding the open borders it's the same group a few dozen people every
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:24.740]  time let's go to greg in arizona appreciate
[01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:28.660]  you calling then we'll go to jerry david and others
[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:33.220]  you're on the air you say us special forces what is your take on all this
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:37.060]  uh yes former uh 18 charlie special force engineer
[01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:42.740]  i think that there's you said that earlier um there's going to be a false
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:48.580]  flag with the economy we're going to have these these pandemics
[01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:52.420]  because there's rampant disease coming across the border
[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:57.700]  there's the plague in colorado it's going to be a full spectrum dominance
[01:35:57.700 --> 01:36:02.340]  as you said and what do you think the end game
[01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:05.140]  is what do you think the ruling establishment
[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:09.620]  how do you oh what order do you think they'll roll all this out they've already
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:14.260]  rolled out a lot of it and what do you think the end game is
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:19.620]  as far as the order i mean that's that's going to be uh a crapshoot
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:26.420]  because it's hard to decide for what might be coming
[01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:30.420]  first because there there are so many things coming
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:35.860]  at us at once and that's i think meant to keep us off
[01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:42.900]  our toes meant to uh keep us falling back
[01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:48.740]  because you you know this best we keep on having to react to this
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:52.260]  story about you know the government trying to
[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:57.380]  you know take away our rights and then this story about this other
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:37:02.740]  incident and they keep on rolling it out the zombies
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:08.500]  just won't they just won't listen no matter how much news you throw at them
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:12.100]  they they're worried about sport celebrity
[01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:19.860]  and just useless stuff and i think that is uh pretty visual to them that
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:22.980]  they can keep on doing it because not enough people
[01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:28.580]  are waking up and standing up against this this really is a testament
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:32.500]  to mind control mass social conditioning and engineering great
[01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:35.860]  point great call that's why i love to talk to military
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:39.540]  people because they really get it that's why in college they make fun of the
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:42.900]  military and have you heard the oxymoron military
[01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:49.300]  intelligence when in my experience military veterans
[01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:53.540]  are about the only group that gets it
[01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:58.500]  and the globalists know that that's why you're the number one target
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:02.180]  when they're done using you you're the enemy
[01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:09.860]  and it's it's like a science fiction book except we're in 2014
[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:13.700]  so i guess we're we are in science fiction land where you've got
[01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:17.620]  such mind control such entertainment such diversions
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:21.140]  that the public watches six seven eight hours of television and video games a
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:23.860]  day you go to restaurants nobody's even talking
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:27.140]  they're only on their smartphones
[01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:33.380]  kids can hardly talk the language is imploding brain waves are lower now
[01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:37.060]  just look that up all timers and brain disorders are directly linked
[01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:41.300]  to television viewing look that up
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:47.060]  and the public has no idea even where russia is
[01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:50.980]  or that we're on the verge of war with them
[01:38:51.220 --> 01:38:54.500]  or that our government publicly is funding isis
[01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:57.620]  to go and blow up every church and every minority muslim
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:39:02.660]  non radical muslim i mean in iraq right now they come to your house
[01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:06.020]  and they catch you with daughters that aren't wearing hoods over their heads
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:09.220]  or daughters that are going to college they they take you outside and they
[01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:12.580]  kill you and then they say your daughters
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:17.700]  deserve to be raped and killed because uh
[01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:21.700]  they haven't been sexually mutilated i mean you cannot make up the level of
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:25.460]  atrocities being committed 300 000 conservatively killed
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:30.980]  the last four years in syria by the cia secret army
[01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:33.940]  most of them christians
[01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:38.660]  i mean they go in catholic churches orthodox churches you name it
[01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:42.340]  they take the priests the nuns the the practitioners out
[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:45.700]  line them up and shoot them and it's in the foreign news
[01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:49.460]  and even the vatican doesn't even say anything because it's politically
[01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:55.460]  incorrect to complain about being persecuted
[01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:00.900]  i mean if you want to know what the new world order would like to do to us
[01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:06.900]  christians and by the way these are real christians living in
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:10.260]  these dirt churches in the middle east and these ancient cultures
[01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:14.100]  these are devout christians that have lived in peace for thousands of years
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:18.020]  there they're being wiped out in africa they're being wiped out everywhere
[01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:21.700]  i'm not talking about the people that go to these big showboat churches
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:25.140]  and feel good and hear a motivational speaker for an hour
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:29.060]  who's really on homeland security payroll under clergy response teams
[01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:32.900]  spying on everybody and using psychological warfare and nlp
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:43.780]  on the practitioners with with prosperity message bull
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:47.140]  do you imagine of these mega churches talked about the new world order or
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:49.860]  abortion or the attack on our second amendment
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:53.460]  no they're like we don't worry about the world we just want souls
[01:40:53.460 --> 01:41:00.100]  you're not getting souls up there watching some motivational speaker
[01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:03.380]  talk about how god's going to supersize you and
[01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:08.580]  you know you're going to have all these blessings because you pray for money
[01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:12.180]  they're cults
[01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:19.220]  and they're so sophisticated with the programming that i can hardly even
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:22.740]  watch it and not go into their control it's very dangerous i'm gonna go back
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:26.820]  to your calls david and jerry and others will continue with current or
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:33.220]  former military to give your take on the crises 800-259-9231
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:38.820]  800-259-9231 let's go to jerry and georgia
[01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:43.860]  former military what's your take on this alex i would just ask your people
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:47.940]  to google five words los vegas illegal aliens
[01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:52.500]  dialysis and it will show you where 80 illegal aliens
[01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:56.580]  have almost crushed the largest hospital in los vegas
[01:41:56.580 --> 01:42:00.420]  they don't have insurance so they don't go for regular dialysis they wait
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:03.620]  until they're almost in renal failure and they gain the system and go to the
[01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:07.540]  emergency room they legally you can't turn them away
[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:12.580]  and it's costing 18 thousand dollars a pop it's costing the hospital 20 yeah i
[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:16.020]  was aware of that we should do our own article
[01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:20.660]  off the los vegas review journal story and and tied into the things so that we
[01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:23.380]  have our own version of that with some added
[01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:26.980]  information but yeah i see the headline put that back up on screen for me guys
[01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:29.700]  thank you again if you're a radio listener
[01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:34.980]  we also simulcast tv it's important to mention that because
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:37.460]  sometimes i'll talk to folks on the street that are listeners
[01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:41.220]  but they go why are you always talking about put it on screen
[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:44.900]  how does that work in radio so people still don't understand that that we
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:48.500]  simulcast television at info wars news dot com and the
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:51.780]  headline is
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:55.220]  medicaid helps hospitals pay for illegal
[01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:59.300]  immigrants care uh and then we have another one of the
[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:02.980]  los vegas review journal that will put back
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:06.660]  on screen dialysis care for poor illegal immigrants costly
[01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:12.740]  for many area hospitals yeah one south texas town of mcallin
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:16.340]  said they spent over 20 million dollars on illegals in last year
[01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:20.980]  uh in marietta california 60 million
[01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:24.820]  and people show up black white hispanic you know every time i see the protesters
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:27.380]  of the buses in marietta it was only white people i don't know how the media
[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:30.740]  did that our cameras it was black hispanic and white
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:34.100]  i didn't see the asians out there
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:41.940]  and so go ahead if they end up closing these hospitals
[01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:45.380]  i want people to ask their local friends how are you going to feel when you have
[01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:48.900]  to drive a half hour to take your daughter they don't care your grandfather
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:51.940]  who's been hurt your parents somebody your loved one
[01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:55.700]  and you don't have a hospital near you any longer you don't because they had to
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:58.660]  close they couldn't afford to stay open and that's
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:02.340]  people need to to to have an intellectual conversation
[01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:05.700]  with these liberals and ask them where are you going to go
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:09.540]  i mean they aren't bringing healthy young men to work it's all kids
[01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:16.180]  kids that need medical care and and this is crushing us we are it's not
[01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:19.380]  going to be a false flag one event we're in the middle of it it's a
[01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:22.900]  slow collapse and it's been going on for years and we're reaching
[01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:27.940]  the the tipping point i agree but there will be
[01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:31.700]  build-ups to the finales and the question is what is the finale
[01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:35.620]  it may be a nuclear war it may be the globalist new king dc when it's in
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:39.780]  uh session i i mean there's just no telling
[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:44.260]  with the globalist but everything is on the table with these nutcases
[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:47.460]  and it is the public's lack of understanding of how dire our straits
[01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:51.140]  are that is empowering this again the good news is
[01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:54.660]  the police and military are are learning about this because they're being
[01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:58.980]  prepared for the collapse and they understand now
[01:44:58.980 --> 01:45:02.900]  because of this show and ron paul and countless others warning them
[01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:07.060]  plus they're smart that this is being done by design
[01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:10.020]  it's not just like all this just got prepared this week
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:12.980]  because we and others have been telling them but great points
[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:15.940]  let's talk to david in florida says his brother works
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:22.340]  for tsa has some info for us again the story is up on info wars dot com
[01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:27.300]  you can't fly with breast milk and citizens get their
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:31.460]  pants you know jacked with and hands down their pants but the illegals
[01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:36.420]  do not have to even have ids folks forget having fake ids they don't even need ids
[01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:40.020]  that article is up on info wars dot com uh in fact here's some of the headlines
[01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:43.460]  for our go to the caller lawsuit americans put on terror database
[01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:49.140]  for buying computers waiting for relatives at train stations
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:53.140]  world war three alert russia val strikes in response to
[01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:56.980]  ukrainian bombing of russian town
[01:45:57.700 --> 01:46:01.940]  i think that headline should be shelling but same thing same difference
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:06.180]  did israel collude with isis to justify gaza attack well israel
[01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:09.780]  has been at least netanyahu has been endorsing isis
[01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:14.100]  and that's not an anti-israel statement i mean that's anti
[01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:18.980]  everybody muslim christian jew you name it to help isis and it's like well
[01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:25.220]  they'll help bring down iran that's evil and our government and what netanyahu
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:29.380]  is doing is bad and maybe we could hear from some israelis
[01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:33.860]  and palestinians in the next hour on that subject
[01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:37.300]  i mean i don't like isis and i don't like what israel is doing i mean it's
[01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:39.780]  it's it's it's evil government it's evil groups
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:44.420]  that say oh we'll have no morals i mean where
[01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:48.100]  where are the pro-israel groups out there where are you criticizing israel
[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:51.140]  for supporting al qaeda
[01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:55.540]  anyways caller sorry go ahead he just dropped okay i was going to go to him
[01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:59.780]  but then i um i wanted to hear the tsa info keep a line open for him to call
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:04.820]  right back caller 800-259-9231 i just started mentioning
[01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:07.940]  the tsa so i thought i'd cover that article call back again i want to hear
[01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:11.380]  what you have to say about that brett in montana
[01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:16.420]  uh former military give us your take then rambo go ahead
[01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:20.260]  hey thanks uh yeah you know i completely agree with you alex that um
[01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:24.180]  it is a multi-pronged attack well i don't think it's just one
[01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:31.380]  thing that is the um that's the plan it's not just going to be one thing
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:35.460]  and i think to answer your question what's going to be the
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:39.540]  final act that brings it all down is um
[01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:44.580]  probably the collapse of the dollar and i personally think that the way it's
[01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:50.340]  going to go down is that um you've got a lot of
[01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:56.100]  talk about uh impeaching obama right now especially with the uh
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:48:02.500]  da scandal with the um stuff that's going down with uh at the
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:07.860]  top of the border the illegals and all of these things
[01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:15.380]  obviously have to be on purpose to stir up racial hatred or
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:18.980]  anything that they can get out of it as a bonus and
[01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:26.740]  once um once that we try to actually impeach obama
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:30.180]  what's to say he's just not going to kick up his feet on the desk
[01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:35.700]  and say you know go fly a kite i haven't listened to you
[01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:39.140]  on anything else before why would i listen to you now
[01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:42.820]  and it's uh you know the old black male
[01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:46.020]  you don't bow down we'll just class the dollar
[01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:49.700]  uh and how you're going to teach him if he
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:54.020]  uh declares martial law
[01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:57.860]  and i think that's what the final thing is going to be and i tend to agree with
[01:48:57.860 --> 01:49:01.380]  you that's that's the plan i appreciate your call we're going to go to rambo
[01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:04.740]  and then when we come back i'm going to play the clip from the local news
[01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:08.900]  that's in our story out of illinois homeland security feds swarm small town
[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:14.260]  and bizarre unannounced show of force school field besieged by helicopter
[01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:17.940]  slot vehicles you name it and then they quote let the kids
[01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:21.140]  climb around in the neighborhood on the helicopters and vehicles
[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:25.780]  it's an acclimation it's a shy op on record
[01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:31.460]  rambo of air force go ahead yeah i was wondering sir if you thought that
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:35.140]  it's possible that they might come out and say that the space aliens are going
[01:49:35.140 --> 01:49:40.020]  to attack us again if we don't keep obama in for a final and long lasting life
[01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:43.380]  term what do you think about that you think they'll do that or maybe have
[01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:48.100]  al gore do it for well you know obama is so unpopular
[01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:51.220]  now again i don't think he's going to be a permanent
[01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:55.060]  dictator he's acting as a dictator even a bunch of members of congress
[01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:58.260]  are now calling him a dictator because that's what he is on every front he
[01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:01.060]  just acts outside of congress that's called a dictator
[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:06.660]  they dictate they do what they want uh i don't see them keeping him in but you
[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:10.500]  know what i've been wrong about a lot of stuff uh when it comes to obama he's
[01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:14.260]  much worse than i even possibly thought and so
[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:18.500]  they may have a plan to keep him in and bring in so many foreigners their

[01:54:07.060 --> 01:54:18.180]  well my early gut analysis of bo burgle has now been proven absolutely
[01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:22.580]  accurate he was totally shape-depped it was totally staged they claimed that he
[01:54:22.580 --> 01:54:26.980]  was you know had some mental problem and had been deep inside
[01:54:26.980 --> 01:54:30.660]  you know al qaeda taliban's control for all these years
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:34.180]  and that nobody could talk to him and now he's back on active duty
[01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:38.020]  totally fine as an army soldier
[01:54:39.700 --> 01:54:44.740]  just totally staged we've got that report coming up i'm going to play a clip
[01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:48.900]  that's up on drudge report dot com we just posted it at info wars dot com
[01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:52.500]  as well black residents of chicago slam obama
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:56.660]  over preferential treatment for illegals will go down as worst president they
[01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:58.820]  say
[01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:04.100]  but again they're expecting to get anything
[01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:09.220]  they're already here they're already prisoners of chicago land
[01:55:10.020 --> 01:55:14.100]  blacks unemployment has doubled under obama they're the worst hit
[01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:17.700]  they're done with you you were supposed to be aborted
[01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:20.980]  by the democratic party they wanted you dead or you were ever born they
[01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:25.300]  they founded the kook logs clan and they know how to put a black leader in to
[01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:28.500]  make sure they switch your throat good and you like it
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:33.700]  so get used to it you think you're going to get some free ride from an l fa
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:38.180]  they're only bringing in these illegals to exploit them as well
[01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:43.380]  let's go to bill and michigan works for homeland security he says i'm going to
[01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:47.620]  jason bill what's your take on all these crises
[01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:51.700]  well elixir thanks for taking my call and thanks for what you're doing
[01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:55.780]  um you know my take on all these is i think that basically what they're going
[01:55:55.780 --> 01:55:59.540]  to end up doing is they're going to continue to paint the opposition and
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:02.740]  the libertarians and constitutionalists that has extreme it
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:06.340]  and i think that they're going to eventually say that we are basically the
[01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:09.220]  largest threat to the homeland and that we need to be eliminated
[01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:13.140]  i don't know what they're going to do to do it i thought that clavin bunny ranch
[01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:16.260]  could have been it but i think they're waiting for another circumstance
[01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:19.060]  like clavin bunny's ranch and i think they're going to have a false flag and
[01:56:19.060 --> 01:56:21.380]  they're going to fire a shot they're going to blame it on the patriot and
[01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:24.900]  then that's what's basically going to start the take down of the right wing
[01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:28.740]  i've been seeing a lot of stuff that worked where they're basically painting
[01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:31.940]  us it's more and more as extremists i just saw
[01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:36.580]  bolton today that uh we uh the right wing extremists
[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:39.620]  quote like both keepers that that's three percent
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:44.900]  are on a terrorism watch list um and it was really scary because i fit all the
[01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:47.940]  parameters that they're talking about this so do you
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:51.460]  so i think that's what they're doing that's what they're planning to do to us
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:55.380]  well that's an escalation to say on a terror watch list
[01:56:55.380 --> 01:57:00.020]  that's actionable uh man if you could um
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:03.540]  somehow snail mail us that or or get us that info
[01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:07.300]  that would be national news we've gotten similar info many times but
[01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:11.380]  nothing to that level they actually said terrorism watch list
[01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:16.100]  uh it was a it was uh law enforcement sensitive terrorism
[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:20.180]  alert newsletter and they specifically talked about
[01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:23.620]  those keepers and three percent that sort of a climbing bunnies ranch and how we
[01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:26.580]  are getting more and more militant and more and more of a threat
[01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:31.300]  to law enforcement and the government and i can absolutely um send that to you
[01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:34.820]  oh well please and and if you've got a safe email to send it or
[01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:38.500]  something else as well send it to show tips at info awards dot com
[01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:41.780]  uh with the information you know in the in the byline
[01:57:41.780 --> 01:57:45.140]  and i really appreciate your call anything else uh that you think's
[01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:48.900]  important to add um you know i just think that
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:52.180]  you know we got to be careful with who we're associating with um i believe
[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:55.060]  that they have been putting plans into our groups
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:59.060]  oh yeah be careful what you say to people and uh be careful
[01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:02.020]  you know to not say anything that could be used against you
[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:05.140]  um i mean because we all know that we we want to you know restore the
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:09.860]  constitution in a nonviolent way we know that but they're trying to pay us
[01:58:09.860 --> 01:58:14.260]  as basically al-qaeda so just basically watch your backs watch what you guys
[01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:19.060]  sure sure sure let me ask you this i mean is this propaganda having any
[01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:22.580]  reverse effect on people in there i mean are folks inside homeland
[01:58:22.580 --> 01:58:26.340]  security realizing like they are in the military that i talked to this is
[01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:30.260]  authoritarianism yeah a lot of people see it alex

[02:01:17.860 --> 02:01:21.460]  we're going to then segue out of that and we're going to talk so don't screen
[02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:24.020]  your calls but sometimes i say it's on a subject
[02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:28.660]  about the middle east and the bombing of gaza and all the deaths and
[02:01:28.660 --> 02:01:32.100]  the rocket attacks and where you see all this going
[02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:37.700]  800-259-9231 but you can be in the us as well
[02:01:37.700 --> 02:01:40.420]  and and call in with your take and your view on this
[02:01:40.420 --> 02:01:47.780]  800-259-9231 800-2599-231 bill in michigan
[02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:51.620]  you're saying you work for homeland security and they've really ratcheted
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:56.020]  up the rhetoric against anybody right of stalin
[02:01:56.020 --> 02:01:59.460]  that's publicly going on as well but uh specifically you know saying they're
[02:01:59.460 --> 02:02:03.220]  terrorist uh if you're in the tea party basically that's
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:07.780]  harry reid driving that ship and that's the southern property law center
[02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:10.900]  that if you're a pro-life group they call you terrorist
[02:02:10.900 --> 02:02:14.660]  the difference is they're now as you said moving homeland security from a
[02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:19.140]  mission of going after al-qaeda to the american people is that what you're
[02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:22.260]  getting at yeah that's really what i'm getting at
[02:02:22.260 --> 02:02:26.180]  and they're basically they're trying to turn the rest of homeland security
[02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:29.940]  against american ideals and alex there's one thing i
[02:02:29.940 --> 02:02:32.740]  want to say about the border patrol too i know the border patrol has done a lot
[02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:35.380]  of crappy things but i just want to let you know
[02:02:35.380 --> 02:02:38.740]  that i have a lot of friends on the southwest border and they are on our
[02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:41.780]  side 100 they feel like the government has abandoned
[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:45.220]  them they feel like they are dying for nothing
[02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:48.580]  and especially late they think about people like brian terry
[02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:52.820]  and robert roces border patrol i want to be clear it's a constitutional federal
[02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:56.180]  agency it's one of the hardest working best
[02:02:56.180 --> 02:03:01.140]  agencies out of a sea of problems they are night and day compared to say like
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:05.220]  the tsa and and they just work really hard it's
[02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:08.820]  really rough i know that and i get critical when they're messing with
[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:12.500]  citizens 80 miles into the country and they're under attack and they're in the
[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:16.260]  systems trying to demoralize them right now we need to support them i totally
[02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:18.980]  agree with you yeah you know i'm absolutely right
[02:03:18.980 --> 02:03:21.940]  about that alex and you know there are still some you know
[02:03:21.940 --> 02:03:24.900]  constitutional agencies that work under the enumerated
[02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:29.620]  enumerated powers and my specific bureau of dhs has been around for
[02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:33.140]  about 200 years so i can probably figure out why it hurt but it is also an
[02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:36.900]  enumerated power but you know yeah are you in the navy or
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:41.220]  are you in the coast guard no no it's um it's with
[02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:45.140]  homeland security customs um
[02:03:45.220 --> 02:03:48.660]  there you go you guessed it they have been around since
[02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:55.060]  1796 so yeah when you said 200 years i know yeah no i mean listen
[02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:58.660]  they put that mark on my deal in in houston to really search my stuff and
[02:03:58.660 --> 02:04:02.180]  tear it apart and the people there just said this is pure crap we're not doing
[02:04:02.180 --> 02:04:05.700]  it i mean in houston that's how crazy it is
[02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:08.980]  where they have robot machines now removing the people
[02:04:08.980 --> 02:04:12.580]  and then they can just put me on a list and not even let me in the country in
[02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:15.620]  the future can you believe that yeah i do and you
[02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:18.580]  can also be put on a list and you will never be cold if you are on the list
[02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:21.700]  you could be searched every single time and it will tell you that it was random
[02:04:21.700 --> 02:04:24.740]  but in secret you're on a list that the system is called the treasury
[02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:27.860]  enforcement communication system the acronym is tech
[02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:31.300]  that's what they use for their silent hits on people and i bet you have one i
[02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:34.500]  would search and look you up but i guarantee they find me
[02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:38.020]  well you're probably on there and that's what they do and it's unconstitutional
[02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:41.940]  to do that to us citizens that was designed yeah i mean meanwhile i have
[02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:45.060]  no criminal record and i'm not doing anything illegal and they all know that
[02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:49.460]  and i'm watching illegals just walk right past me and it's just pure bull
[02:04:49.460 --> 02:04:52.580]  and this is this is the authoritarianism and it's just getting started
[02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:56.420]  all right we're gonna get to jason but then derrick andrew paul and many others

[02:09:59.060 --> 02:10:02.900]  world to bring you news that nobody else is and
[02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:06.900]  i should cut a promo ad to inspire people to sign up because a lot of folks
[02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:09.780]  are signing up and that allows us to continue and expand and i'm going back
[02:10:09.780 --> 02:10:14.180]  to your calls because i mean every month now
[02:10:14.180 --> 02:10:18.260]  we're breaking big national or international
[02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:23.220]  news stories that then cause an entire debate
[02:10:23.220 --> 02:10:29.620]  and that caused policy changes it is info wars
[02:10:29.620 --> 02:10:34.900]  that proved that obama was purposefully shipping the illegals in and paying to
[02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:38.340]  deploy them now congress is talking about it
[02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:41.700]  now they're moving to block it this is a big deal
[02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:44.820]  the board of patrol said this was going on no one would listen to them
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:53.300]  so we went down there and confirmed it drudge report dot com linked to it
[02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:59.780]  and we were able to then see it really explode
[02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:04.580]  but all the time we see the white house even respond to us on the second
[02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:11.460]  amendment on energy you name it and that means we're having a big effect here
[02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:14.340]  and one reason we've been successful is we understand how the world works we're
[02:11:14.340 --> 02:11:18.260]  not idiots we read establishment internal publications declassified
[02:11:18.260 --> 02:11:21.300]  documents we get an incredible amount of leaked information
[02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:24.740]  a lot of which i can't even cover on air
[02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:30.340]  because it's so classified and i i just stick it in shredding machines i didn't
[02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:33.380]  want to know and people like well bring this to us
[02:11:33.380 --> 02:11:37.540]  i'm not getting arrested ladies and gentlemen the point is i already know
[02:11:37.540 --> 02:11:40.980]  what's going on without even getting documents it's just this just verifies
[02:11:40.980 --> 02:11:45.540]  it this is an evil takeover okay this isn't just democrat versus republican
[02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:48.260]  or these people are playing for keeps i mean they're
[02:11:48.260 --> 02:11:53.300]  scary and i've been told one reason i'm allowed to live and be left on the air
[02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:58.180]  is they think you're cowards and they think i'm gonna scare you
[02:11:58.180 --> 02:12:01.780]  by telling you how bad they are and that you're just gonna cower
[02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:06.420]  i think they've miscalculated i mean we're not the bad people we're not the
[02:12:06.420 --> 02:12:08.980]  ones that say the state owns the kids and
[02:12:08.980 --> 02:12:12.180]  are putting deadly stuff in vaccines and funding al-qaeda and opening the
[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:16.420]  borders we're not the ones attacking with Russia
[02:12:16.420 --> 02:12:20.260]  i mean i'm just a guy who doesn't want to be a slave
[02:12:20.260 --> 02:12:25.300]  who wants to live in a free country i i'm not bad
[02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:31.060]  and if they come after me or set me up or whatever i mean that's their issue
[02:12:31.060 --> 02:12:35.620]  i would be more scared of not resisting them and speaking out
[02:12:35.620 --> 02:12:40.980]  and just quietly shutting up and watching the whole country collapse
[02:12:40.980 --> 02:12:53.460]  i would be more concerned about that i mean i just can't give up on humanity
[02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:56.660]  when people have an attitude that you can't change things things only get
[02:12:56.660 --> 02:13:00.020]  worse and i've seen incredibly positive things
[02:13:00.020 --> 02:13:02.020]  happen and we're going to chase in rich
[02:13:02.020 --> 02:13:06.900]  derek andry paul and others i'm seeing a huge awakening happening
[02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:10.740]  and the old tricks the ruling class would use against people don't work
[02:13:10.740 --> 02:13:13.060]  anymore
[02:13:14.740 --> 02:13:19.380]  and our whole world's in danger right now a lot of people that work for the
[02:13:19.380 --> 02:13:22.180]  system at high level don't like what's happening either
[02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:25.460]  they just don't know how to fix it as well because
[02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:29.700]  it isn't just the elite that's doing this our own laziness
[02:13:29.700 --> 02:13:33.540]  our own corruption our own evil
[02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:38.420]  and not recognizing evil has allowed this stuff to grow
[02:13:38.420 --> 02:13:41.220]  i mean here's a headline right here leaked data shows
[02:13:41.220 --> 02:13:46.100]  tenfold increase in obama's asylum approvals daily caller
[02:13:46.100 --> 02:13:49.300]  and that's kind of a perennial article that comes out every week but each week
[02:13:49.300 --> 02:13:53.300]  then it gets worse they went to 80 of people not being deported
[02:13:53.300 --> 02:14:01.060]  from 90 being deported a few years ago and now it's 99 don't get deported
[02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:04.660]  the number of foreigners has successfully filed asylum claims
[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:09.780]  now the state's almost tripled from 2012 to 2013
[02:14:09.780 --> 02:14:14.500]  and that's just on asylum you can say i'm leaving the horrible tyranny of
[02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:18.900]  guatemala yeah to bring it here they want you
[02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:21.940]  here because you'll be happy to have a bowl of rice
[02:14:21.940 --> 02:14:28.100]  and live in a cardboard box and it's not that i studied economics
[02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:30.980]  and how societies operate and the system knows this
[02:14:30.980 --> 02:14:34.740]  ross perot told us this we don't rise ourselves up
[02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:39.140]  bringing in giant groups of poor people
[02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:43.940]  in this economy and in this social system it it barely works if you have no
[02:14:43.940 --> 02:14:46.980]  welfare it's still a problem but if you've got
[02:14:46.980 --> 02:14:51.060]  welfare man you might as well burn your house down
[02:14:51.060 --> 02:14:54.660]  i don't need to go through the mathematics of this do i that if you get
[02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:58.500]  more than 50 of people which we now have on the dole
[02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:02.180]  they become a political class that will enslave you to get more goodies and
[02:15:02.180 --> 02:15:06.340]  then finally it collapses i mean it's called game over
[02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:11.940]  game over man game over so we're at the edge of this thing
[02:15:11.940 --> 02:15:15.220]  if the fbi wants to sit there and read manuals and i'm a terrorist you actually
[02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:18.580]  believe that you actually think i'm the bad guy and ron paul's the
[02:15:18.580 --> 02:15:21.940]  bad guy and that and that al gore and and and
[02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:26.420]  obama and and john bainer are good and isis is good
[02:15:26.420 --> 02:15:31.060]  and the tsa's got to search old ladies but let the illegals in
[02:15:31.060 --> 02:15:36.260]  and fine fine but i believe more in people that work for the system i know
[02:15:36.260 --> 02:15:39.140]  you're corrupt and out of control and under peer pressure but i don't think
[02:15:39.140 --> 02:15:42.180]  you're suicidal let's go ahead and talk to jason in
[02:15:42.180 --> 02:15:46.020]  florida u.s marine corps and we're going to get to some of these palestinian
[02:15:46.020 --> 02:15:50.260]  israel calls about the crisis in gaza going on with
[02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:54.500]  days of bombardment and it's just a tragedy after rockets were fired
[02:15:54.500 --> 02:16:01.220]  into israel israel is responding and and targeting
[02:16:01.220 --> 02:16:04.740]  civilian areas where the weapons are kept and there's a lot of collateral
[02:16:04.740 --> 02:16:09.060]  damage and it's just a tragedy uh jason in florida your take on all these
[02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:12.420]  crises being created and where it's going
[02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:17.540]  well first off uh i put put to you like this i'd like to issue a warning to all
[02:16:17.540 --> 02:16:19.940]  the veterans that are out there especially any that have been involved
[02:16:19.940 --> 02:16:24.020]  since 9 11 uh i started in a rifle company for example and
[02:16:24.020 --> 02:16:26.900]  when i was in iraq the first time they didn't mess with us but then around
[02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:31.220]  2007 2008 and southern afghanistan when we would
[02:16:31.220 --> 02:16:34.980]  match up people we would send them through basically a biometric scanner they
[02:16:34.980 --> 02:16:40.100]  would scan their eyes take their fingerprints take boy samples from them
[02:16:40.100 --> 02:16:43.940]  point is the way they train those guys was to test it on us
[02:16:43.940 --> 02:16:46.820]  so basically they said they weren't even running machines but who's to say they
[02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:49.300]  weren't lying you look around you see all this
[02:16:49.300 --> 02:16:52.820]  scanning all these you know fingerprint scanners and eye detectors and
[02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:56.740]  everything you see on these uh tremendo systems around america at this point
[02:16:56.740 --> 02:17:00.100]  and uh they're watching everywhere i obviously i don't need to say that now
[02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:04.180]  where am i going to and where where are we going with all this
[02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:08.820]  iraq the way the way that they are highly successful over there is the shock
[02:17:08.820 --> 02:17:12.820]  shock at all that was their original system they go through
[02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:16.500]  they they storm into your house and you see it on these movies and everybody
[02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:18.980]  gets all hyped up about it but that's how they're training the guys for
[02:17:18.980 --> 02:17:23.460]  flight that's how we're training all of our allies that's how we're
[02:17:23.460 --> 02:17:26.820]  training the iraq that's how we're training the afghanis
[02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:30.580]  we're teaching them these same tactics that will be used against americans
[02:17:30.580 --> 02:17:33.300]  they're drawing down the us army they're drawing down the brain cord they're
[02:17:33.300 --> 02:17:37.060]  drawing down the fighting type infantry basic man boot on the
[02:17:37.060 --> 02:17:41.140]  ground kicking doors they're going to use foreign troops
[02:17:41.140 --> 02:17:44.900]  not not a few months ago i remember they had foreign troops that practice
[02:17:44.900 --> 02:17:49.220]  invading in tamper for to right here close to me spring bringing their home
[02:17:49.220 --> 02:17:52.180]  that's it that's the space and by the way
[02:17:52.180 --> 02:17:56.980]  i was told all this 20 years ago about retired military officers kernels
[02:17:56.980 --> 02:18:01.460]  generals you name it and i would roll my eyes at them
[02:18:01.460 --> 02:18:04.340]  because back then nobody was talking about this so i got contacted by all
[02:18:04.340 --> 02:18:07.620]  these people and i had like joint chiefs of staff chairman
[02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:13.300]  admiral moron probably 10 times i mean i i'm i talk to all these guys
[02:18:13.300 --> 02:18:17.060]  and general boykin knows what's going on
[02:18:17.060 --> 02:18:20.820]  he's been warning people i had a cough all day sorry keep getting
[02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:26.660]  stuff in my throat and bottom line
[02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:32.660]  keep going for a second caller okay you know i i looked around and this was
[02:18:32.660 --> 02:18:36.020]  back before i was you know awake so to speak like you like to say i didn't
[02:18:36.020 --> 02:18:39.140]  even realize at that time because you know that was before everybody had a
[02:18:39.140 --> 02:18:42.740]  smartphone in their pocket that was before you know i realized that there
[02:18:42.740 --> 02:18:45.780]  was a surveillance grid really watching it that was before i knew that
[02:18:45.780 --> 02:18:48.500]  w w w it didn't just mean you know just wasn't
[02:18:48.500 --> 02:18:51.860]  starting to address that website that that was actually a web the worldwide
[02:18:51.860 --> 02:18:55.380]  web that you talk about that exactly and and going back to those military
[02:18:55.380 --> 02:18:58.580]  officers they said foreign troops will be used i for the un
[02:18:58.580 --> 02:19:02.420]  and we'd always roll our eyes at that but then they had in leo nine and others
[02:19:02.420 --> 02:19:04.900]  where they admitted troops from 15 nations
[02:19:04.900 --> 02:19:08.180]  practicing to quote take on american domestic extremists
[02:19:08.180 --> 02:19:14.180]  they really plan on doing this and working with contractors and collaborators
[02:19:14.180 --> 02:19:17.540]  they're going to hunt down the veterans in this country and people say well
[02:19:17.540 --> 02:19:22.260]  they'll end up losing that's the plan they want to chew everybody up in this
[02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:25.860]  contrived crisis and by the way your instincts are right

[02:24:16.900 --> 02:24:21.620]  discussion as frances boil's coming up for 30 minutes to get into ukraine
[02:24:21.620 --> 02:24:25.620]  the middle east everything in fact we'll probably take some calls for frances boil
[02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:29.860]  with derrick andrew hall rich dug and others in fact i'm going to go to some
[02:24:29.860 --> 02:24:33.300]  of you right now here's why i stand on what israel's
[02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:36.900]  doing in the Gaza Strip killing hundreds of people
[02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:40.500]  some of them innocence as they strike back because of
[02:24:40.500 --> 02:24:47.540]  Hamas and others launching rockets uh into the country
[02:24:48.260 --> 02:24:52.500]  it always devolves into a discussion of should israel exist or not
[02:24:52.500 --> 02:24:56.340]  the fact is it does exist and israel has nuclear weapons so israel's not going
[02:24:56.340 --> 02:24:59.700]  anywhere but no one in the cause
[02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:03.780]  celeb range is complaining about 300 000 dead
[02:25:03.780 --> 02:25:08.260]  Arabs and Christians Arab Christians and others in Syria
[02:25:08.260 --> 02:25:11.300]  or the people being slaughtered the moderate muslims and christians
[02:25:11.300 --> 02:25:15.540]  in iraq right now by western backed isis
[02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:19.620]  so people always you know send me emails as he comments why aren't you covering
[02:25:19.620 --> 02:25:23.620]  Israel why are you covering it up we have all these articles saying it's not good
[02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:26.500]  talking about it opening the phones up to talk about it
[02:25:26.500 --> 02:25:30.260]  it's like a one-up man oh you you don't care about the
[02:25:30.260 --> 02:25:34.100]  the aids issue or you don't care about the palestinians or
[02:25:34.100 --> 02:25:37.700]  meanwhile the globalists are slaughtering ukrainians
[02:25:37.700 --> 02:25:44.580]  muslims arabs you name it so yes i do care
[02:25:44.580 --> 02:25:51.780]  but my issue is why is what israel does the big issue and nothing else
[02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:56.500]  it becomes just a cop out it's just as easy to go ah israel did it all
[02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:59.380]  and that's where i stand on this it's much more sophisticated
[02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:03.220]  you want to be critical be critical of netanyahu coming out three weeks ago and
[02:26:03.220 --> 02:26:08.020]  saying we need isis we need to back isis because they're already backing them
[02:26:08.020 --> 02:26:11.860]  i mean i want to hear from jews that live in israel uh because i've had some
[02:26:11.860 --> 02:26:15.140]  folks call him from israel and go yeah we are kind of backing it in syria
[02:26:15.140 --> 02:26:19.620]  i think that's wrong yeah it's wrong i'm just against this whole
[02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:26.100]  reprobate system where you fund evil to attack your enemy and then it attacks
[02:26:26.100 --> 02:26:28.900]  you and then the governing class gets to take everybody's
[02:26:28.900 --> 02:26:32.580]  rights that's who wins and guess what the governing class
[02:26:32.580 --> 02:26:35.460]  acts the same in salya arabia and israel and the us
[02:26:35.460 --> 02:26:39.140]  everywhere and it's that governing class i'm against and the tricks they use
[02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:42.980]  and if you just get past arab jew german chinese
[02:26:42.980 --> 02:26:46.660]  mexican american whatever then you can have a real debate about the tactics
[02:26:46.660 --> 02:26:48.980]  being used and not have to be a bunch of tribalism
[02:26:48.980 --> 02:26:52.820]  are you for the palestinians or for the israelis
[02:26:52.820 --> 02:26:57.060]  when it's much more sophisticated than that uh derrick in california you're on
[02:26:57.060 --> 02:27:03.060]  the air what's your take on this yes shalom i'm an israelite in california
[02:27:03.060 --> 02:27:07.700]  and i believe that the globalists are just using this war over there to bring
[02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:12.340]  about their new world order like revelations 112 says the new world
[02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:16.580]  order will last for 42 months and i learned all of this from
[02:27:16.580 --> 02:27:20.340]  joseph israel that a true israelite is someone who follows
[02:27:20.340 --> 02:27:26.340]  jesus so using this political nation over there as the chosen people gives
[02:27:26.340 --> 02:27:30.660]  america a reason to send money and get all the christian support
[02:27:30.660 --> 02:27:35.860]  but um anyone who follows jesus is a true israelite and israelites are scattered
[02:27:35.860 --> 02:27:39.380]  all over the world and joseph israel's music
[02:27:39.380 --> 02:27:43.700]  and radio show really taught me this that these political nations are not
[02:27:43.700 --> 02:27:47.780]  being directed by god and that you're an israelite if you follow
[02:27:47.780 --> 02:27:51.300]  jesus and so israel is really in the whole earth
[02:27:51.300 --> 02:27:56.020]  and the new world order will rise and fall and only last 42 months according
[02:27:56.020 --> 02:27:58.580]  to revelation 112 all right i'm going to jump to another
[02:27:58.580 --> 02:28:03.540]  caller very good points uh whether you believe in god the bible or not
[02:28:03.540 --> 02:28:08.580]  what the man is saying has a lot of bearing there's the nutricardy
[02:28:08.580 --> 02:28:13.140]  jews you know who are who are you know orthodox
[02:28:13.140 --> 02:28:17.380]  and who you know follow the ancient uh they're acidic really
[02:28:17.380 --> 02:28:21.540]  and they're they're like hey the bible clearly says the torus says
[02:28:21.540 --> 02:28:24.660]  israel can't have a government until the messiah comes back so what is this
[02:28:24.660 --> 02:28:28.500]  government and then it just becomes this whole debate
[02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:31.940]  and then you get christian zionists who love the police state and love everything
[02:28:31.940 --> 02:28:34.820]  else and then they just sit around going oh
[02:28:34.820 --> 02:28:37.860]  thank god israel's about to get blown up means it's the end of the world
[02:28:37.860 --> 02:28:41.380]  i mean it's just craziness man and i'm tired of it let's go ahead and talk to
[02:28:41.380 --> 02:28:45.780]  andrew in minnesota you're on the air what's your take on all this
[02:28:45.780 --> 02:28:49.300]  uh actually my take is it's all intertwined with you know the rush on our
[02:28:49.300 --> 02:28:53.460]  southern border mixed in with isis mixed in with what's going on in gaza it's
[02:28:53.460 --> 02:28:58.820]  all a plan to just cripple and topple anything that we
[02:28:58.820 --> 02:29:02.340]  have tried to put forth with you know letting israel and
[02:29:02.340 --> 02:29:06.180]  the palestines have their quote on quote ceasefire
[02:29:06.180 --> 02:29:09.940]  no i agree it is a globalist destabilization program worldwide the
[02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:14.820]  question is what are they planning next easy the collapse of the united
[02:29:14.820 --> 02:29:18.820]  states yeah i agree with you yeah and you know it all
[02:29:18.820 --> 02:29:22.260]  takes place over in the middle east that's what nobody's understanding is
[02:29:22.260 --> 02:29:26.820]  you know if we put so much effort out there trying to stabilize something
[02:29:26.820 --> 02:29:29.540]  that's not going to get stabilized get our nose out of it
[02:29:29.540 --> 02:29:32.420]  because we're going to crush our own economy trying to help out everybody
[02:29:32.420 --> 02:29:34.420]  why do you think the rush on the southern border
[02:29:34.420 --> 02:29:36.900]  we get half the money we're giving to these islamists
[02:29:36.900 --> 02:29:40.660]  faith to our southern border and our northern border we have the most
[02:29:40.660 --> 02:29:44.180]  prosperous continent in the world exactly but the globalists don't want
[02:29:44.180 --> 02:29:47.780]  prosperity because it's a rigged system excellent call more calls coming up stay
[02:29:47.780 --> 02:29:52.980]  with us we're on the march the empires on the run

[02:29:59.780 --> 02:30:03.460]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself
[02:30:03.460 --> 02:30:06.980]  our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day
[02:30:06.980 --> 02:30:10.900]  but it's not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have
[02:30:10.900 --> 02:30:14.580]  two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[02:30:14.580 --> 02:30:18.900]  and most americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals

[02:30:27.140 --> 02:30:30.420]  and don't forget the fact that six million americans live with pets they're

[02:33:13.940 --> 02:33:18.900]  jones
[02:33:18.900 --> 02:33:22.020]  well i won't go over his bio in the interest of time
[02:33:22.020 --> 02:33:26.420]  but professor francis anthony boiled is a best-selling
[02:33:26.420 --> 02:33:31.700]  author he helped write the biological weapons convention
[02:33:31.700 --> 02:33:34.900]  he served on the board of directors of amnesty international
[02:33:34.900 --> 02:33:37.620]  represented bosnia hersey gavinia at the world court
[02:33:37.620 --> 02:33:40.900]  he served as a legal advisor to the palestinian delegation
[02:33:40.900 --> 02:33:44.820]  to the middle east peace negotiations from 91 to 93
[02:33:44.820 --> 02:33:48.820]  in 2007 he delivered the burgeon russell peace lectures
[02:33:48.820 --> 02:33:53.380]  professor boil teaches international law the university of illinois campaign
[02:33:53.380 --> 02:33:56.820]  and the author of uh and i'm not going to go over all the books he's written
[02:33:56.820 --> 02:34:01.540]  then you just type in his name and find them he has a phd magna cum laude
[02:34:01.540 --> 02:34:06.020]  from harvard university and more and he basically
[02:34:06.020 --> 02:34:12.660]  took the uh somewhat secretive um harvard phd that kissinger and a few
[02:34:12.660 --> 02:34:16.100]  others have had where they actually tell you how things really work
[02:34:16.100 --> 02:34:19.220]  that's what carol quickly's book was about was to have a manual so
[02:34:19.220 --> 02:34:22.100]  people could understand wait a minute we fund the terrorist but then we fight
[02:34:22.100 --> 02:34:26.260]  the terrorist and so he's a unique individual to
[02:34:26.260 --> 02:34:30.580]  break down the full spectrum of what we face and for representing
[02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:34.580]  muslims persecuted in this country uh clearly you've done nothing he's been
[02:34:34.580 --> 02:34:38.580]  put on no fly list you name it so uh he's he's been through a lot
[02:34:38.580 --> 02:34:42.020]  he's been to the middle east countless times he can break down what he thinks
[02:34:42.020 --> 02:34:45.300]  is happening but it's pretty obvious now you've got
[02:34:45.300 --> 02:34:50.180]  netanyahu openly endorsing isis a few weeks ago
[02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:53.780]  you've got other countries endorsing it you've got saudi arabia helping fund
[02:34:53.780 --> 02:34:56.900]  it you've got nato involved british special forces
[02:34:56.900 --> 02:35:00.420]  even one in guardian reports as we told you years ago training some of them
[02:35:00.420 --> 02:35:04.020]  i'm not saying they run them but they're funding them and turning them loose
[02:35:04.020 --> 02:35:07.540]  then you've got russia saying they may start striking
[02:35:07.540 --> 02:35:10.500]  ukraine anytime because of shelling into their country
[02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:13.300]  over a thousand dead in the last few days according to the
[02:35:13.300 --> 02:35:18.100]  ukrainians bombing uh civilian areas and the ukrainians are bragging about it
[02:35:18.100 --> 02:35:22.260]  you've got sorrows behind that all hell's breaking loose with the
[02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:27.300]  border being opened by design that's now confirmed
[02:35:27.300 --> 02:35:31.300]  the the elite are bringing in global crisis so i want to ask somebody who's
[02:35:31.300 --> 02:35:34.260]  been through the similar globalist training but
[02:35:34.260 --> 02:35:40.020]  turned against them early on uh what he thinks the grand plan is
[02:35:40.020 --> 02:35:43.300]  is this order out of chaos or do they just think it is
[02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:47.220]  or is megalomania shut in like hitler and napoleon
[02:35:47.220 --> 02:35:51.620]  uh with these adventures uh who's running the show and and where does he
[02:35:51.620 --> 02:35:55.460]  think it's all going if anybody can tell us it's frances boil uh thanks for
[02:35:55.460 --> 02:35:59.220]  coming on sir what do you think's going on well thank you very much for having
[02:35:59.220 --> 02:36:02.420]  me on uh alex and my best to your audience yes when
[02:36:02.420 --> 02:36:06.580]  you uh uh mentioned what's going on i i think
[02:36:06.580 --> 02:36:12.100]  we have to go back to uh my teacher metter and friend the uh
[02:36:12.100 --> 02:36:18.100]  late great hans morganthal who founded international political science
[02:36:18.100 --> 02:36:25.060]  and in fact kissinger uh revered uh morganthal and when he taught international
[02:36:25.060 --> 02:36:29.540]  relations uh at harvard uh he used morganthal's
[02:36:29.540 --> 02:36:34.660]  casebook politics among nations and what is going on now and if you do a
[02:36:34.660 --> 02:36:39.780]  google search under my name uh you'll see uh an essay by me
[02:36:39.780 --> 02:36:46.420]  entitled unlimited imperialism which uh morganthal was writing about a
[02:36:46.420 --> 02:36:51.460]  phenomena uh which for him described alexander the
[02:36:51.460 --> 02:36:56.580]  romans hitler uh napoleon and and others of this nature
[02:36:56.580 --> 02:37:00.100]  to distinguish it from uh ordinary imperialism
[02:37:00.100 --> 02:37:04.740]  namely that they want to control and dominate the entire world
[02:37:04.740 --> 02:37:11.220]  and what i argued in my essay is taking um morganthal's definition
[02:37:11.220 --> 02:37:18.340]  uh of unlimited imperialism that is what we have seen the united states uh
[02:37:18.340 --> 02:37:22.580]  power elite financial power elite uh engage in
[02:37:22.580 --> 02:37:29.060]  since the terrorist attacks on um september 11th uh 2001 they're you
[02:37:29.060 --> 02:37:34.660]  know they're going for broke uh just like the romans or alexander napoleon
[02:37:34.660 --> 02:37:39.540]  or hitler and uh they they will continue to go all out
[02:37:39.540 --> 02:37:45.300]  and the difference between uh you know bush uh and obama it's it's tweedle
[02:37:45.300 --> 02:37:49.780]  dumb versus tweedle deep uh you know i've been through all these uh elite
[02:37:49.780 --> 02:37:55.300]  programs at chicago and harvard and no obama's uh was behind me at
[02:37:55.300 --> 02:38:00.180]  harvard law school um romney and i uh actually
[02:38:00.180 --> 02:38:03.540]  took all of our first year law courses together at harvard law school
[02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:09.380]  so there's no real uh difference here as far as the uh elite sees it they're
[02:38:09.380 --> 02:38:15.220]  going for broke and in the process they realize to do this
[02:38:15.220 --> 02:38:19.780]  they must establish a police state here uh at home
[02:38:19.780 --> 02:38:23.140]  and you and i've been through this uh before
[02:38:23.140 --> 02:38:27.220]  i believe i was in your uh documentary uh on this
[02:38:27.220 --> 02:38:32.660]  matter so i'm not going to belabor it here uh but you know starting with the
[02:38:32.660 --> 02:38:36.420]  uh usa patriot act the fisa amendments act
[02:38:36.420 --> 02:38:40.340]  the uh national defense authorization act which
[02:38:40.340 --> 02:38:46.180]  by the way senator levin said uh when they first drafted it
[02:38:46.180 --> 02:38:51.060]  it did not apply to united states citizens and it was president obama who
[02:38:51.060 --> 02:38:55.460]  insisted that it applied to united states citizens so that the
[02:38:55.460 --> 02:39:00.340]  military uh could basically pick up and disappear uh any
[02:39:00.340 --> 02:39:05.060]  citizen they want to uh here in the united states for uh
[02:39:05.060 --> 02:39:11.140]  whatever reason now we have the uh obama uh drone campaign i'm not here to
[02:39:11.140 --> 02:39:16.020]  justify uh president bush jr but even president bush jr did not
[02:39:16.020 --> 02:39:22.340]  irrigate to himself uh the right to murder united states citizens uh which
[02:39:22.340 --> 02:39:25.700]  obama and his attorney general uh holder have
[02:39:25.700 --> 02:39:28.980]  have done and have made it quite clear holder
[02:39:28.980 --> 02:39:33.060]  and uh brandon the head of the cia uh that they're for
[02:39:33.060 --> 02:39:37.380]  to do that here in the united states of america so there's an accelerated
[02:39:37.380 --> 02:39:39.940]  rotting let me ask you this before you go into the big picture and talk about
[02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:42.420]  what's happening in the middle east currently and where you see their next
[02:39:42.420 --> 02:39:46.340]  step being in uh professor frances boil joins us
[02:39:46.340 --> 02:39:50.580]  what i'm getting at is it seems like a a
[02:39:50.580 --> 02:39:55.460]  you know classical power grab on every front but whereas caesar and alexander
[02:39:55.460 --> 02:40:00.500]  actually went out and led their forces uh they weren't even trying to so much
[02:40:00.500 --> 02:40:04.180]  degenerate their own culture just to dominate what was happening back in
[02:40:04.180 --> 02:40:08.420]  her own but that degeneracy came regardless what i'm saying is
[02:40:08.420 --> 02:40:12.500]  the political elite run by wall street to make 40 to 1 bets with other people's
[02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:16.260]  money seems so dysfunctional and mentally ill
[02:40:16.260 --> 02:40:20.420]  looking at this as a student of history i don't see their plan
[02:40:20.420 --> 02:40:24.340]  succeeding i do see there being a chance of nuclear war
[02:40:24.340 --> 02:40:27.780]  and them destroying civilization i mean that's what i'm getting at i mean how
[02:40:27.780 --> 02:40:31.220]  dangerous are these people what is your gut gestalt
[02:40:31.220 --> 02:40:35.060]  on where we are when the history books are written later
[02:40:35.060 --> 02:40:38.660]  well on both the domestic and the international point
[02:40:38.660 --> 02:40:42.340]  on the domestic point first you write about the uh
[02:40:42.340 --> 02:40:47.220]  financial lead in america all of a sudden the national defense authorization
[02:40:47.220 --> 02:40:51.380]  act came out of nowhere why they were terrified
[02:40:51.380 --> 02:40:56.420]  by the occupied wall street movement uh taking off all over the country
[02:40:56.420 --> 02:41:02.260]  and that's what produced mdaa on the international uh arena
[02:41:02.260 --> 02:41:06.420]  yes of course we could have a serious war
[02:41:06.420 --> 02:41:10.020]  at any time as you pointed out in uh ukraine
[02:41:10.020 --> 02:41:15.460]  where uh obama and his neo cons and his neo libs there's not much difference
[02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:20.020]  sponsored a uh neo nazi kudaita in ukraine
[02:41:20.020 --> 02:41:23.060]  that overthrew a democratically elected government
[02:41:23.060 --> 02:41:29.380]  we've now had uh firing across the uh undemarcated border between
[02:41:29.380 --> 02:41:35.060]  ukraine and russia it appears they're trying to provoke russia
[02:41:35.060 --> 02:41:42.180]  uh to invade ukraine and then uh the trap will have been sprung
[02:41:42.180 --> 02:41:45.540]  and you'll have their uh puppet their poroshenko
[02:41:45.540 --> 02:41:50.340]  invoke invoke article 51 the right of collective self defense
[02:41:50.340 --> 02:41:54.500]  and you'll have nato forces streaming uh into
[02:41:54.500 --> 02:42:00.260]  uh into ukraine for sure um it's not exactly clear where they'll stop you
[02:42:00.260 --> 02:42:03.780]  remember in the clint administration when they were
[02:42:03.780 --> 02:42:08.020]  bombing uh servia over kosovo general westley
[02:42:08.020 --> 02:42:11.060]  clark uh ordered the nato troops to take the
[02:42:11.060 --> 02:42:14.660]  kosovo airport and fortunately the um
[02:42:14.660 --> 02:42:18.500]  british military commander mike jetson refused because it was
[02:42:18.500 --> 02:42:22.340]  occupied by russian troops and said that uh he's not
[02:42:22.340 --> 02:42:26.580]  prepared to start world war three well who knows what will happen the
[02:42:26.580 --> 02:42:31.140]  current policy towards uh russia is being orchestrated
[02:42:31.140 --> 02:42:36.740]  by zbigniew brzezinski uh i went through the same phd program at harvard
[02:42:36.740 --> 02:42:42.100]  that produced both kissinger and brzezinski uh performing uh brzezinski
[02:42:42.100 --> 02:42:45.380]  is an ex patriot poll who hates the russians
[02:42:45.380 --> 02:42:49.140]  and he wants to see them broken up uh into
[02:42:49.140 --> 02:42:54.820]  russia broken up into eight million pieces the top white house advisor at
[02:42:54.820 --> 02:42:59.540]  the national security council on russia is a brzezinski protege
[02:42:59.540 --> 02:43:04.020]  uh obama's mentor at columbia was brzezinski
[02:43:04.020 --> 02:43:09.860]  and brzezinski ran his entire foreign affairs campaign in 2008
[02:43:09.860 --> 02:43:14.820]  so this is an extremely uh dangerous situation ukraine
[02:43:14.820 --> 02:43:21.540]  likewise in uh syria uh in iraq uh at any time uh obama
[02:43:21.540 --> 02:43:27.780]  could start bombing uh in iraq and as you correctly pointed out in your
[02:43:27.780 --> 02:43:33.940]  introductory comments isis was by us uh it started with the obama
[02:43:33.940 --> 02:43:38.980]  administration even senator ran paul said this and i'm a political
[02:43:38.980 --> 02:43:44.020]  independent as no uh alex but even senator ran paul said well
[02:43:44.020 --> 02:43:47.620]  yeah we were arming uh isis which is true
[02:43:47.620 --> 02:43:51.940]  uh that's where the uh bengasi operation was all about
[02:43:51.940 --> 02:43:56.180]  shipping uh muslim fundamentalists weapons equipment and supplies
[02:43:56.180 --> 02:43:59.940]  uh into syria uh this war against syria is
[02:43:59.940 --> 02:44:05.860]  is obama's uh idea and he is armed uh every armed equipped supplied and
[02:44:05.860 --> 02:44:10.660]  trained uh every jihadi they can find including those they
[02:44:10.660 --> 02:44:15.380]  used to overthrow uh qaddafi sure let me ask you this then why is the ruling
[02:44:15.380 --> 02:44:19.700]  establishment uh doing things that they've never done
[02:44:19.700 --> 02:44:23.940]  so nakedly by an order of power or correct me if you think that's a
[02:44:23.940 --> 02:44:28.260]  wrong statement i mean they just seem to really have a
[02:44:28.260 --> 02:44:34.020]  crazed aura to them that just reeks of disaster i mean they just don't seem to
[02:44:34.020 --> 02:44:38.740]  care and have any sanity and as you said we came millimeters
[02:44:38.740 --> 02:44:42.340]  with in pristina and kosovo from war with the russians
[02:44:42.340 --> 02:44:47.940]  we came millimeters in georgia and now it appears with soros and the rest of
[02:44:47.940 --> 02:44:51.060]  them uh that even if the u.s policy doesn't go
[02:44:51.060 --> 02:44:55.460]  with this there's other nato forces and soros forces
[02:44:55.460 --> 02:44:58.660]  that are hell bent on starting a war with russia
[02:44:58.660 --> 02:45:02.580]  how do they think they're going where do they want to go with this i mean i don't
[02:45:02.580 --> 02:45:07.220]  see it being successful well and also uh with china
[02:45:07.220 --> 02:45:12.500]  alex uh obama's uh pivot to uh asia taken right out of
[02:45:12.500 --> 02:45:16.660]  brzezinski's uh grand chessboard and you have these
[02:45:16.660 --> 02:45:21.460]  little bitty pieces of rock the daiu islands right off of
[02:45:21.460 --> 02:45:28.500]  taiwan uh that japan stole from china in the 1895 war of aggression against
[02:45:28.500 --> 02:45:33.780]  china when it was weak um and yet after world war two refused to
[02:45:33.780 --> 02:45:39.300]  give it back to china and now we the united states both secretary
[02:45:39.300 --> 02:45:42.340]  state clinton uh and uh secretary defense
[02:45:42.340 --> 02:45:48.740]  hagel have threatened to go to war so that japan the militarists in japan
[02:45:48.740 --> 02:45:52.500]  uh can hang on to these little pieces of rock
[02:45:52.500 --> 02:45:56.740]  uh right there in the and now the chinese government as you know but on the
[02:45:56.740 --> 02:45:59.620]  audience the last week and their official dailies
[02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:02.740]  have said okay they're prepared for nuclear war with the u.s
[02:46:02.740 --> 02:46:06.820]  they're going on maximum alert and build up and then the in the same elite have
[02:46:06.820 --> 02:46:11.380]  heavily invested in china i mean i look at the globalist this
[02:46:11.380 --> 02:46:16.420]  collection of neocons and liberal cons and all the rest of them neolibs
[02:46:16.420 --> 02:46:20.580]  they really don't even have a formula at all it's just screw everyone screw
[02:46:20.580 --> 02:46:24.660]  screw over civilization screw over classical egalitarianism
[02:46:24.660 --> 02:46:29.060]  these people are the plague well you could read
[02:46:29.060 --> 02:46:33.380]  machiavelli's the prince or thomas hobs the leviathan
[02:46:33.380 --> 02:46:39.620]  uh the prince for uh foreign affairs and uh leviathan for constructing a
[02:46:39.620 --> 02:46:43.620]  totalitarian dictatorship because if you go through any of these elite
[02:46:43.620 --> 02:46:46.900]  programs like at the university chicago have you read them
[02:46:46.900 --> 02:46:51.300]  where uh the um uh neocons come from where i was schooled as an
[02:46:51.300 --> 02:46:55.300]  undergrad uh and then harvard you have to know
[02:46:55.300 --> 02:47:00.660]  machiavelli and hobs by your heart and then add in their uh niche and that
[02:47:00.660 --> 02:47:04.420]  pretty much uh accounts for by the way that was my next point
[02:47:04.420 --> 02:47:07.220]  and again of course these are philosophers that you know that people
[02:47:07.220 --> 02:47:09.700]  like hitler loved for those that don't understand
[02:47:09.700 --> 02:47:14.900]  hillary her favorite books 1984 because she sees it as a beautiful world and
[02:47:14.900 --> 02:47:18.100]  when you were bringing up kissinger like in the you know the the individual
[02:47:18.100 --> 02:47:22.180]  exposing the you know total empire they see it as a model
[02:47:22.180 --> 02:47:25.860]  and so that's what you're getting at that's correct and and uh
[02:47:25.860 --> 02:47:31.140]  clinton went to uh yale law school uh i interviewed there for a job in
[02:47:31.140 --> 02:47:35.620]  1977 there no different from uh harvard law school
[02:47:35.620 --> 02:47:40.740]  bill clinton went there too so again uh what you have here is a
[02:47:40.740 --> 02:47:46.980]  elitist uh training grounds uh to produce these uh imperial
[02:47:46.980 --> 02:47:51.540]  managers uh whether democrats or republicans is pretty irrelevant it's
[02:47:51.540 --> 02:47:56.100]  it's all the same uh to rule the world only now
[02:47:56.100 --> 02:48:00.660]  as i said after september 11th in the issue i'm sure you've discussed the
[02:48:00.660 --> 02:48:03.940]  p-neck report uh they're going for broke they're
[02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:07.860]  literally going to try to uh take over russia
[02:48:07.860 --> 02:48:13.460]  um and and china uh uh and the burzhinsky grand chess board lays it all
[02:48:13.460 --> 02:48:18.900]  out there if you want to read it it's a madness and and they've been
[02:48:18.900 --> 02:48:22.100]  sticking with the same plan for 40 years 60 years
[02:48:22.100 --> 02:48:25.380]  and depending on how you look at it how do you see an ending
[02:48:25.380 --> 02:48:27.860]  because i know a lot of people only established when i talked to a pretty
[02:48:27.860 --> 02:48:31.380]  freaked out the military's freaked out the police are waking up
[02:48:31.380 --> 02:48:35.220]  americans can see that cages are being built around us
[02:48:35.220 --> 02:48:38.180]  i mean this isn't going to be like some british empire where we at least get
[02:48:38.180 --> 02:48:41.780]  some of the goods uh and i'm not endorsing the british empire
[02:48:41.780 --> 02:48:46.260]  this is an empire that dominates humanity itself i mean it's the job of
[02:48:46.260 --> 02:48:52.180]  every human on the planet to resist this empire but what do we replace it with
[02:48:52.180 --> 02:48:56.660]  well you're correct alex but if it keeps going the way it is we're going to
[02:48:56.660 --> 02:49:01.140]  have uh another world war either with russia or china or both
[02:49:01.140 --> 02:49:05.300]  um it's i don't know how much time we have
[02:49:05.300 --> 02:49:10.420]  and then the uh final consolidation of a police state here at home in order to
[02:49:10.420 --> 02:49:15.620]  run it and it'll be just like uh 1984 by uh george all
[02:49:15.620 --> 02:49:19.060]  or well we're coming very close to that permanent war abroad
[02:49:19.060 --> 02:49:22.980]  and a police state at home yes we're we're close we don't have much time
[02:49:22.980 --> 02:49:26.660]  i don't know how much time we have anything could go wrong remember a
[02:49:26.660 --> 02:49:30.100]  hundred years ago there was this assassination in sarah
[02:49:30.100 --> 02:49:35.060]  yable i visited that that scene when i was bosnia's lawyer the ground branch
[02:49:35.060 --> 02:49:38.980]  right no one no one thought that would lead to a world war and yet 10 million
[02:49:38.980 --> 02:49:44.100]  people were dead well now uh we have nuclear weapons
[02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:48.820]  certainly uh in the hands of the united states russia china
[02:49:48.820 --> 02:49:52.740]  uh israel uh pakistan pakistan's another
[02:49:52.740 --> 02:50:00.180]  tender point it's very clear the uh neo cons want to crack up pakistan
[02:50:00.180 --> 02:50:04.500]  and and neutralize the pakistani dukes just if they's cracked up and
[02:50:04.500 --> 02:50:09.860]  destroyed uh afghanistan iraq uh libya
[02:50:09.860 --> 02:50:15.460]  sudan and this goes back to the memoirs by uh general wesley clark where he
[02:50:15.460 --> 02:50:21.860]  admits after 9 11 2001 the neo cons under wolfowitz in the pentagon
[02:50:21.860 --> 02:50:26.660]  came up with a plan to take out seven arab and muslim states
[02:50:26.660 --> 02:50:30.820]  and they're going right down that list and i was at the universe
[02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:36.260]  in chicago with with uh wolfowitz he was the head of me getting his phd in
[02:50:36.260 --> 02:50:40.180]  political science and international relations while i was getting my
[02:50:40.180 --> 02:50:43.380]  undergrad in international relations with hans morgenthau
[02:50:43.380 --> 02:50:47.940]  he's part of this neocon cabal uh he is um
[02:50:47.940 --> 02:50:53.700]  mentor there was albert wolstetter from the reincorporation stay there yeah

[02:55:25.300 --> 02:55:30.500]  and what you've done to try to help this country in the world
[02:55:30.500 --> 02:55:35.540]  i do see a big awakening happening but i see the political class organizing
[02:55:35.540 --> 02:55:40.980]  to try to crush peaceful political uh redress of grievances and as jack
[02:55:40.980 --> 02:55:44.020]  kennedy said those that make peaceful revolution
[02:55:44.020 --> 02:55:47.780]  impossible make violent revolution inevitable
[02:55:47.780 --> 02:55:51.220]  and the system really does plan for this big war
[02:55:51.220 --> 02:55:55.620]  with the american people uh your your closing comments on some way out of
[02:55:55.620 --> 02:56:00.900]  this without having a civil war here in the empire
[02:56:00.900 --> 02:56:05.380]  well you know we we still have our first amendment rights
[02:56:05.380 --> 02:56:10.020]  freedom of speech freedom of association freedom of religion
[02:56:10.020 --> 02:56:14.420]  uh that we have to do everything to organize to
[02:56:14.420 --> 02:56:19.780]  stop these people um we also have our second amendment rights uh we we've
[02:56:19.780 --> 02:56:23.700]  discussed this before alexa i'm not a gun person myself
[02:56:23.700 --> 02:56:29.780]  but um the second amendment does recognize now freedom to bear arms
[02:56:29.780 --> 02:56:35.300]  and even justice scalia uh in his decision on the heller case
[02:56:35.300 --> 02:56:38.740]  said one of the purposes of the second amendment
[02:56:38.740 --> 02:56:42.980]  is to prevent a tyrannical government so
[02:56:42.980 --> 02:56:47.860]  those are the the directions uh we're moving in i i think
[02:56:47.860 --> 02:56:51.780]  everyone not you know i'm not here to promote violence but
[02:56:51.780 --> 02:56:57.140]  uh everyone has to do i think under these terrible circumstances
[02:56:57.140 --> 02:57:03.460]  uh what his or her conscience uh tells them to do because we we could have
[02:57:03.460 --> 02:57:07.220]  a war very soon um congress goes out of session
[02:57:07.220 --> 02:57:12.740]  in um uh august and that's always a bad time for
[02:57:12.740 --> 02:57:16.580]  imperial presidents to wait for because they
[02:57:16.580 --> 02:57:20.900]  know there is no congressional control uh upon them
[02:57:20.900 --> 02:57:25.620]  uh there is no prospect of anyone introducing a bill of impeachment
[02:57:25.620 --> 02:57:32.900]  uh to to restrain them i certainly uh have advocated that obama be impeached
[02:57:32.900 --> 02:57:36.820]  the sooner the better uh to to stop this uh
[02:57:36.820 --> 02:57:41.460]  movement towards war uh in a police state sure patty canon's argument that
[02:57:41.460 --> 02:57:45.620]  republicans can win brownie points by not doing it and let him get worse
[02:57:45.620 --> 02:57:48.820]  is like saying you know murderers should go free you then
[02:57:48.820 --> 02:57:52.340]  join with the immorality by not impeaching him
[02:57:52.340 --> 02:57:55.780]  and you know even ron paul said he's never seen anything like obama
[02:57:55.780 --> 02:57:59.140]  and he's usually no let's don't impeach because they're all bad we should impeach
[02:57:59.140 --> 02:58:03.620]  them all but he said no last friday he said this is a special viral growth of
[02:58:03.620 --> 02:58:08.100]  evil let me just in in closing say this and then get your take on it uh if you
[02:58:08.100 --> 02:58:10.900]  can do five more minutes at overdrive i understand you probably can't but but
[02:58:10.900 --> 02:58:14.260]  professor sure used to soldiers fought used to
[02:58:14.260 --> 02:58:19.940]  seizer fought some uh alexander fought this is really in the last 50
[02:58:19.940 --> 02:58:22.980]  hundred to 100 years but but now it's really coming to a head
[02:58:22.980 --> 02:58:25.700]  where the soldiers don't fight it's drone so i want to come back after one
[02:58:25.700 --> 02:58:29.060]  minute get your take we'll come back and more overdrive callers i promise i go
[02:58:29.060 --> 02:58:34.020]  to you at eight after i want to ask you this key question
[02:58:34.020 --> 02:58:37.780]  what does it mean when humans are taken out of the equation and what does it
[02:58:37.780 --> 02:58:41.460]  say of an elite that are disconnected from the battlefields
[02:58:41.460 --> 02:58:46.340]  that people are dying on i mean i think that adds to their delusion
[02:58:46.340 --> 02:58:50.020]  even if they're intellectual about it
[02:58:50.020 --> 02:58:54.340]  city of austin tap water versus filtered city of austin tap water i didn't i
[02:58:54.340 --> 02:58:58.340]  taste dirt in it god knows what's in this these people just sampled city of
[02:58:58.340 --> 02:59:02.420]  austin tap water straight from the faucet next we had them try a sample of
[02:59:02.420 --> 02:59:05.540]  tap water filtered through the crow pure g2.0
[02:59:05.540 --> 02:59:08.900]  filtration system now one is better tastes like nothing
[02:59:08.900 --> 02:59:12.500]  yep i know what good water tastes like it's good water most tap water contains
[02:59:12.500 --> 02:59:16.980]  added substances like fluoride fluorine glyphosate and many others
[02:59:16.980 --> 02:59:20.660]  studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health
[02:59:20.660 --> 02:59:24.820]  issues including tooth decay lower than iq and even cancer it tastes like you
[02:59:24.820 --> 02:59:28.900]  drink it out of the lake when you're in tap water the probe your g2.0
[02:59:28.900 --> 02:59:32.980]  filtration system removes these deadly substances leaving only fresh

[02:59:57.140 --> 03:00:05.780]  network network
[03:00:05.940 --> 03:00:10.660]  big brother we're in overdrive mainstream media government cover-ups
[03:00:10.660 --> 03:00:18.020]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[03:00:18.020 --> 03:00:26.260]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[03:00:26.260 --> 03:00:30.340]  we're back folks now into the third hour fourth hour
[03:00:30.340 --> 03:00:33.060]  in the start of the next segment i'm going to write to paul and others that
[03:00:33.060 --> 03:00:35.940]  are patiently holding to talk about what's happening in the middle east right
[03:00:35.940 --> 03:00:40.020]  now professor francis boil is our guest best-selling author researcher
[03:00:40.020 --> 03:00:45.460]  political insider from his past research look it's been a sport of kings
[03:00:45.460 --> 03:00:51.060]  and quote nobility even above hunting dangerous game to go out and be involved
[03:00:51.060 --> 03:00:55.060]  in combat and even though it was primitive and violent you could at least
[03:00:55.060 --> 03:00:58.980]  have some respect for the fact that warrior kings would lead people into
[03:00:58.980 --> 03:01:03.300]  battle compared to the elites we have i mean
[03:01:03.300 --> 03:01:07.380]  napoleon would you know was a famous artillery officer and then
[03:01:07.380 --> 03:01:12.900]  led his forces even though he was a terrible person in many respects
[03:01:12.900 --> 03:01:17.060]  now there's hitler won the iron cross the congressional medal of honor
[03:01:17.060 --> 03:01:20.740]  first class the german equivalent so in the three four minutes we have left
[03:01:20.740 --> 03:01:25.940]  francis boil my issue is they're giving purple hearts to the
[03:01:25.940 --> 03:01:30.420]  equivalent medals to the drone pilots it's not just the elite separated from
[03:01:30.420 --> 03:01:34.340]  the human suffering that they're causing and it just seems like nature's out of
[03:01:34.340 --> 03:01:37.460]  balance there's almost like a singularity of evil
[03:01:37.460 --> 03:01:41.140]  coming what's your thoughts and closing on that
[03:01:41.140 --> 03:01:44.740]  well i think it's here uh if you look at the uh
[03:01:44.740 --> 03:01:48.740]  neocon pedigree it was all founded by professor leo
[03:01:48.740 --> 03:01:54.100]  strauss at the university of chicago uh i was uh educated in that system i
[03:01:54.100 --> 03:01:57.460]  studied with his uh right hand man uh joseph
[03:01:57.460 --> 03:02:03.300]  krobsi uh strauss had just retired and their um
[03:02:03.300 --> 03:02:07.780]  strauss's teacher mentor and sponsor in germany
[03:02:07.780 --> 03:02:12.420]  was professor carl schmitt and carl schmitt
[03:02:12.420 --> 03:02:15.940]  was the leading nazi law professor
[03:02:15.940 --> 03:02:21.140]  of his era he justified any every hideous atrocity
[03:02:21.140 --> 03:02:26.020]  the nazis uh inflicted on everyone including the jews
[03:02:26.020 --> 03:02:31.140]  and so you're right alex what what we've seen uh overtaking the country
[03:02:31.140 --> 03:02:38.900]  uh is this uh neo nazi uh mentality that is now uh possessed
[03:02:38.900 --> 03:02:42.980]  our our power elite me if you look listen to
[03:02:42.980 --> 03:02:48.980]  secretary stare carry uh he sounds mentally deranged oftentimes when he's
[03:02:48.980 --> 03:02:54.980]  he's giving his uh uh parlorations there on uh tv and many of the rest of them
[03:02:54.980 --> 03:02:58.740]  do too so i think that this is what we've seen
[03:02:58.740 --> 03:03:01.780]  and and you're correct
[03:03:02.340 --> 03:03:05.780]  we're between a rock and a hard place because they're already set up ready
[03:03:05.780 --> 03:03:08.980]  for an arm revolution they want to use that to bring in total tyranny
[03:03:08.980 --> 03:03:12.740]  but then they're attacking us so under common law and common sense
[03:03:12.740 --> 03:03:16.260]  you know i think this is where i'm going with this i think if everything does
[03:03:16.260 --> 03:03:21.940]  kick off it becomes violent i just want to make sure that the people
[03:03:21.940 --> 03:03:26.340]  that are calling the shots they want to be back in their armored fortresses and
[03:03:26.340 --> 03:03:29.300]  send the police out and the military out to do this
[03:03:29.300 --> 03:03:32.100]  and i think it's very important at the end of all this
[03:03:32.100 --> 03:03:35.860]  that they be brought to justice and that and that they be dealt with
[03:03:35.860 --> 03:03:39.460]  because i think it's only that fear that will hold them back that's what we
[03:03:39.460 --> 03:03:42.740]  need to impeach obama and not try to make political points
[03:03:42.740 --> 03:03:46.660]  you know for the republicans who are just as big a problem
[03:03:46.660 --> 03:03:51.780]  i agree i agree with that and ultimately the question will be
[03:03:51.780 --> 03:03:58.420]  will common ordinary everyday uh us soldiers fire on us citizens when
[03:03:58.420 --> 03:04:04.500]  when ordered to by the power elite i certainly hope they don't because the
[03:04:04.500 --> 03:04:09.060]  common ordinary everyday soldiers are taken from us
[03:04:09.060 --> 03:04:12.180]  the power elite most of them are chicken hawks
[03:04:12.180 --> 03:04:16.340]  they all bugged out of the uh vietnam war i have no problem
[03:04:16.340 --> 03:04:21.380]  with people avoiding the vietnam war uh because it was illegal and immoral just
[03:04:21.380 --> 03:04:26.420]  don't be a war monger later but but the a generation later
[03:04:26.420 --> 03:04:32.020]  they're sending uh young men and women from middle class lower class uh
[03:04:32.020 --> 03:04:35.860]  economically deprived uh areas of our country
[03:04:35.860 --> 03:04:42.260]  off to fight and die uh for oil and profits and glory and the question
[03:04:42.260 --> 03:04:45.700]  will be how much longer uh will the young men and
[03:04:45.700 --> 03:04:50.820]  women of our armed forces uh take being cannon fodder
[03:04:50.820 --> 03:04:54.900]  for the power elite i agree they obey orders
[03:04:54.900 --> 03:04:59.380]  to fire all right fellow americans thank you professor very well said thank you

[03:08:16.260 --> 03:08:20.180]  alex jones broadcasting live from the front lines
[03:08:20.180 --> 03:08:26.260]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[03:08:26.260 --> 03:08:29.540]  a lot of people have been taught that the best course to take is just keep your
[03:08:29.540 --> 03:08:34.020]  head down do it you're told well that is the road to absolute
[03:08:34.020 --> 03:08:40.020]  serfdom the road to slavery and i see these political
[03:08:40.020 --> 03:08:43.940]  elite who are incredibly soft people like john carrey
[03:08:43.940 --> 03:08:48.580]  obama all of them killery make a statement like i came i saw
[03:08:48.580 --> 03:08:53.940]  he died obama saying i'm good at killing people
[03:08:53.940 --> 03:08:57.620]  and then you see just the same spirit i don't care if you're obama or your net
[03:08:57.620 --> 03:09:00.980]  and yahoo and you people know i don't spend all
[03:09:00.980 --> 03:09:05.300]  my time you know going into the bashing of israel i'm going to your calls right
[03:09:05.300 --> 03:09:09.060]  now because people have tried to intimidate
[03:09:09.060 --> 03:09:13.700]  me and attack me over the years into attacking israel all day
[03:09:13.700 --> 03:09:17.860]  that's the easy cause celeb you know thing to do and i'm like no it's
[03:09:17.860 --> 03:09:21.460]  terrible what's going on in israel and it goes on in palestine and
[03:09:21.460 --> 03:09:24.900]  you know it's also really terrible that you got about 20 times that being killed
[03:09:24.900 --> 03:09:28.740]  conservatively by al-qaeda forces run by our government
[03:09:28.740 --> 03:09:33.700]  in syria they're just like shut up you work for israel
[03:09:33.700 --> 03:09:38.260]  and i'm like uh no actually israel's with saudi arabia helping
[03:09:38.260 --> 03:09:42.020]  fund the groups doing this in syria i don't like israel doing that i don't
[03:09:42.020 --> 03:09:47.220]  like the political class being so evil they would openly fund al-qaeda groups
[03:09:47.220 --> 03:09:50.100]  and then use the threat of that to take our rights they've taken the israeli
[03:09:50.100 --> 03:09:54.020]  people's rights uh you know using the the threat
[03:09:54.020 --> 03:09:59.700]  of terrorism this terrorism rubric is being used to take over society and i
[03:09:59.700 --> 03:10:05.380]  know you know that but if you just pick a side palestinian israeli
[03:10:05.380 --> 03:10:08.420]  that's what the system wants you to do instead of pulling back and going
[03:10:08.420 --> 03:10:13.700]  who's behind all of this what's the big picture
[03:10:13.700 --> 03:10:17.860]  al-qaeda took the blame for 9 11 clearly only players in it
[03:10:17.860 --> 03:10:21.620]  the wrong country was attacked iraq saudi arabia sits back says they're
[03:10:21.620 --> 03:10:24.820]  bolstering their border against isis when they run the group
[03:10:24.820 --> 03:10:29.300]  that's just rhetoric now they double cross each other so they don't trust
[03:10:29.300 --> 03:10:31.700]  them either
[03:10:33.060 --> 03:10:35.380]  but
[03:10:37.220 --> 03:10:41.700]  this is the culture and the society we now live in and
[03:10:41.700 --> 03:10:47.540]  i'll say it again it is a total complete manifest fraud
[03:10:47.540 --> 03:10:52.340]  on every front
[03:10:52.340 --> 03:10:56.100]  that the war on terror is to keep us safe the war on terror
[03:10:56.100 --> 03:11:00.660]  period is about social control and it's not just social control so everybody's
[03:11:00.660 --> 03:11:04.420]  safe that's the nanny state lie it's social control
[03:11:04.420 --> 03:11:09.860]  to radically engineer society and and fundamentally
[03:11:09.860 --> 03:11:15.940]  destroy the family destroy justice destroy our health
[03:11:15.940 --> 03:11:20.180]  and really put us into a scientific dictatorship known as the technocracy
[03:11:20.180 --> 03:11:23.140]  that is designed to finally end humanity
[03:11:23.140 --> 03:11:27.140]  as we know it in the globalist own words and people can say well that's far
[03:11:27.140 --> 03:11:31.060]  out that won't happen no it's happening
[03:11:31.060 --> 03:11:34.420]  see that's the thing if this was just some corruption
[03:11:34.420 --> 03:11:38.740]  i would criticize it and everything but i wouldn't risk my life fighting it
[03:11:38.740 --> 03:11:42.180]  because corruption has always been endemic to civilization
[03:11:42.180 --> 03:11:47.860]  this stuff is pure satanic evil
[03:11:48.180 --> 03:11:51.620]  and you've got to make a decision against it
[03:11:51.620 --> 03:11:57.540]  you've got to say i'm not going to be with this
[03:11:59.380 --> 03:12:02.580]  let's go to your phone calls you've been holding long enough paul then we'll go
[03:12:02.580 --> 03:12:06.260]  to uh rich dug nick mary and others paul you're on the air
[03:12:06.260 --> 03:12:09.380]  thank you for holding uh what's your take on the situation
[03:12:09.380 --> 03:12:14.500]  in the middle east 11 years thank you um i think this is real issue ties directly
[03:12:14.500 --> 03:12:17.780]  to our border um israel is working with isis we know
[03:12:17.780 --> 03:12:21.940]  that um they the isis claimed to kill the jewish kids that started all this and
[03:12:21.940 --> 03:12:25.300]  now isis says they're not going to do anything to help the palestinians
[03:12:25.300 --> 03:12:28.820]  and uh at the same time we have south american fighters in syria
[03:12:28.820 --> 03:12:33.060]  we have the head of isis is from chile you know and i think the same mentality
[03:12:33.060 --> 03:12:36.260]  of the palestinians fighting against white jews from europe
[03:12:36.260 --> 03:12:39.540]  is the same mentality of you know they want to start their mythical homeland in
[03:12:39.540 --> 03:12:43.220]  south america and i mean in south no no no you just
[03:12:43.220 --> 03:12:47.540]  head on it it's called liberation theology and they take real grievances
[03:12:47.540 --> 03:12:52.740]  but then the ford foundation and google publicly run the palestinian grips
[03:12:52.740 --> 03:12:56.740]  they ran the arab spring exactly it's so sophisticated
[03:12:56.740 --> 03:13:00.660]  how do you explain that to people they're getting rid of the legs so we can't get
[03:13:00.660 --> 03:13:04.420]  any more and and the borders are wide open and the south american
[03:13:04.420 --> 03:13:07.620]  our guys have been training with al-qaeda they're coming across the border
[03:13:07.620 --> 03:13:10.660]  training the regular south americans and they want to take back their country
[03:13:10.660 --> 03:13:15.380]  and we're going to have a mini iraq right here and we're not even seeing it
[03:13:15.380 --> 03:13:19.700]  people always ask how the u.s could fall um we're seeing it we're seeing the
[03:13:19.700 --> 03:13:24.020]  beginning of it and again it sucks bold moves by the globalist
[03:13:24.020 --> 03:13:30.660]  on every front you really signals they're going for
[03:13:30.660 --> 03:13:34.980]  broke i mean i mean that's it this is a whole new ball game of escalation great
[03:13:34.980 --> 03:13:43.620]  points paul uh rich in pennsylvania you're on the air
[03:13:43.620 --> 03:13:48.900]  hello hey go ahead hey uh a long time listener second head caller didn't
[03:13:48.900 --> 03:13:52.100]  fit right i had to say last time i was on but it was right at the end of the
[03:13:52.100 --> 03:13:54.340]  show i got cut off that's okay you're on now go ahead and talk right on your
[03:13:54.340 --> 03:13:59.460]  telephone this whole thing is um it's all a bit of a sham with the middle east
[03:13:59.460 --> 03:14:02.500]  net yahu all the world leaders most of them anyways
[03:14:02.500 --> 03:14:06.580]  are controlled by the the banker elites and the money changers exactly that's
[03:14:06.580 --> 03:14:10.180]  why they're all following the same script right right and and what they're
[03:14:10.180 --> 03:14:13.380]  doing is see they turn the heat up all around us do they keep all this
[03:14:13.380 --> 03:14:17.620]  turmoil going on all around the world so that the fear factor the level of
[03:14:17.620 --> 03:14:21.140]  fear outside of our country is this far exceeds the level of fear inside our
[03:14:21.140 --> 03:14:24.500]  country which allows them to turn up the temperature here
[03:14:24.500 --> 03:14:27.940]  and uh you know incrementally increase the turning state where it creates like a
[03:14:27.940 --> 03:14:30.740]  feedback they're going for a big feedback loop here
[03:14:30.740 --> 03:14:35.780]  that's going to um amplify and and increase it in the example rate to the
[03:14:35.780 --> 03:14:40.420]  point where when it does all come to pieces uh they'll be able to roll it
[03:14:40.420 --> 03:14:43.860]  out uh exponentially as it all collapses
[03:14:43.860 --> 03:14:47.620]  exactly they're always posing as the savior
[03:14:47.620 --> 03:14:51.220]  to the financial crisis the border crisis the al-qaeda crisis
[03:14:51.220 --> 03:14:55.620]  the ices crisis the russia crisis and as long as they can get away
[03:14:55.620 --> 03:14:59.140]  with not getting the blame for being behind it they'll continue to get more
[03:14:59.140 --> 03:15:02.180]  power out of the crisis they created it's very elementary
[03:15:02.180 --> 03:15:07.860]  and uh you said it that's it all right and uh what i was trying to say the
[03:15:07.860 --> 03:15:12.980]  last time i was on um was that uh this goes back a
[03:15:12.980 --> 03:15:15.860]  long way see the bankers knew with uh when they had
[03:15:15.860 --> 03:15:18.820]  alga and their handles and pushing the constitution and they said
[03:15:18.820 --> 03:15:22.100]  they knew that there was 13 states and they were going to do a lot more
[03:15:22.100 --> 03:15:26.580]  and uh because you could see the territory is forming ahead of time
[03:15:26.580 --> 03:15:30.500]  and uh so they saw a problem there and so the constitution was also a trojan
[03:15:30.500 --> 03:15:32.980]  horse to bring in blank at tyranny or a
[03:15:32.980 --> 03:15:37.140]  authority that is above all the states so that that tyranny can go out well
[03:15:37.140 --> 03:15:40.260]  that's what the colonies that's what the colonies in the state said for a
[03:15:40.260 --> 03:15:43.460]  decade of debate while they brought in in 1798 the bill of
[03:15:43.460 --> 03:15:46.580]  rights to be very clear about everything but you're right
[03:15:46.580 --> 03:15:49.460]  the lawyers did some fiddling in the constitution
[03:15:49.460 --> 03:15:53.940]  and it's not as good as the Declaration of Independence for bill of rights
[03:15:53.940 --> 03:15:56.900]  and people seem to conflate the three is one thing
[03:15:56.900 --> 03:16:00.420]  uh and i guess the bill of rights are amendments to the constitution
[03:16:00.420 --> 03:16:04.900]  but again now the globalists want to get rid of it whole hog
[03:16:04.900 --> 03:16:08.420]  uh appreciate your call let's talk to Doug in Iowa Doug you're on the air
[03:16:08.420 --> 03:16:14.260]  thanks for holding oh thank you um if you uh look at
[03:16:14.260 --> 03:16:17.940]  what's going on in the middle east to me it's like a magician
[03:16:17.940 --> 03:16:22.180]  but his left hand he's uh got these little rockets flying
[03:16:22.180 --> 03:16:26.100]  in there so that all the news is focused in on
[03:16:26.100 --> 03:16:30.580]  Israel and the real thing is happening in the Ukraine where they're
[03:16:30.580 --> 03:16:34.500]  sticking a fork in the russians trying to get them
[03:16:34.500 --> 03:16:38.580]  activated no that's it this could cause world war three
[03:16:38.580 --> 03:16:42.900]  and i'm very sad for the gossips getting you know dying and getting bombed
[03:16:42.900 --> 03:16:46.340]  and i'm sad for israelis getting hit by rockets but
[03:16:46.340 --> 03:16:49.540]  that's all anyone knows how to talk about the liberal trendies and the rest of
[03:16:49.540 --> 03:16:53.220]  them and you know why aren't you going to palestine
[03:16:53.220 --> 03:16:56.500]  you know cult brothers work for israel you know the same stuff that just gives
[03:16:56.500 --> 03:17:00.260]  them moral authority and is made up while we're criticizing israel funding
[03:17:00.260 --> 03:17:04.420]  al-qaeda funding all these attacks but but but we're not doing it from a hate
[03:17:04.420 --> 03:17:08.500]  position we're just doing it from reality position and then
[03:17:08.500 --> 03:17:13.060]  meanwhile talk about arab is getting killed ices is just
[03:17:13.060 --> 03:17:17.540]  slaughtering people by the hundreds of thousands i mean it's it's incredible
[03:17:17.540 --> 03:17:22.260]  and and and no one will talk about it it's just amazing
[03:17:22.260 --> 03:17:26.580]  well i look at revelation 18 uh mystery bablon
[03:17:26.580 --> 03:17:30.020]  at first it burns and then it's cast into the sea
[03:17:30.020 --> 03:17:33.780]  and that seems to match those new one hundred dollar bills when they fold them
[03:17:33.780 --> 03:17:37.220]  you've got a high rise with a nuclear bomb going off over it
[03:17:37.220 --> 03:17:40.660]  and then it's got a tidal wave going off over it
[03:17:40.660 --> 03:17:45.140]  now the russians they can they can set off that vio
[03:17:45.140 --> 03:17:49.140]  tidal wave and cover the whole east coast and
[03:17:49.140 --> 03:17:52.900]  a nuclear strike on the country first would seem appropriate
[03:17:52.900 --> 03:17:57.060]  according to the way things are going and that would uh both fulfill the
[03:17:57.060 --> 03:18:01.940]  hundred dollar bill and revelation 18 well i know they got a lot of secret
[03:18:01.940 --> 03:18:05.620]  messages in the money that's admitted it's pretty stunning when you look at it
[03:18:05.620 --> 03:18:10.900]  but past all that secretary defense coen admitted
[03:18:10.900 --> 03:18:18.100]  in army times back in 97 uh that indeed they do have
[03:18:18.100 --> 03:18:21.620]  earthquake and tsunami weapons and i have mainstream news saying that i mean
[03:18:21.620 --> 03:18:24.260]  there's just no telling i mean it's it's buck rogers man
[03:18:24.260 --> 03:18:27.700]  that's why the elites act like we don't even exist or were roaches
[03:18:27.700 --> 03:18:31.220]  we're gonna skip this network break coming up so i can get to all your calls
[03:18:31.220 --> 03:18:34.820]  and we'll go to the bottom of the hour but um i'd go even further but i'll get
[03:18:34.820 --> 03:18:37.220]  too exhausted i just can't do four or five hours
[03:18:37.220 --> 03:18:40.020]  anymore and i want to shoot some stuff for the nightly news
[03:18:40.020 --> 03:18:44.740]  a lot of other work to do as well but um i just hope everybody who's on the side
[03:18:44.740 --> 03:18:48.740]  of liberty works instead of just talking and reaches out to other people and
[03:18:48.740 --> 03:18:52.900]  hope everybody in the alternative media creates more content to overtake the
[03:18:52.900 --> 03:18:57.300]  dinosaur media because uh people shouldn't take having the internet and
[03:18:57.300 --> 03:19:01.060]  freedom of speech for granted anymore i mean it's it's all they're moving on
[03:19:01.060 --> 03:19:07.540]  every front people let's go to nick in florida nick you're on the air
[03:19:07.540 --> 03:19:12.420]  hi alex uh love your show thank you brother what's on your mind
[03:19:12.420 --> 03:19:16.180]  uh i got some questions if uh they use social control
[03:19:16.180 --> 03:19:19.540]  with social media in the middle east the way they do
[03:19:19.540 --> 03:19:27.780]  on facebook uh in america with uh false profits um about in
[03:19:27.780 --> 03:19:31.460]  just any kind of control with that over there too because i personally
[03:19:31.460 --> 03:19:37.380]  witnessed some of that well undoubtedly globalists are always
[03:19:37.380 --> 03:19:40.740]  targeting religious leaders a lot of the clergy here in this country catholic
[03:19:40.740 --> 03:19:44.100]  protestant you name it buddhist are on government payrolls
[03:19:44.100 --> 03:19:48.260]  i mean it's on record that a bunch of these religious leaders are on cia
[03:19:48.260 --> 03:19:54.820]  payroll and then isis is a globalist creation the cia is an alien group of
[03:19:54.820 --> 03:19:58.100]  basically british intelligence and the globalist
[03:19:58.100 --> 03:20:01.060]  they got a lot of compartmentalized people think they fight for america inside
[03:20:01.060 --> 03:20:03.620]  of it uh and they couldn't get them to do as much
[03:20:03.620 --> 03:20:06.340]  evil stuff 50 60 years ago they'll do anything now
[03:20:06.340 --> 03:20:11.140]  or they've got contractors that'll do it and so uh yeah i mean they're just
[03:20:11.140 --> 03:20:16.660]  playing us off against each other have you heard of uh some of the
[03:20:16.660 --> 03:20:20.980]  the the facebook groups that uh basically uh
[03:20:20.980 --> 03:20:25.700]  tell you to not listen to alternative media and um you know just go with your
[03:20:25.700 --> 03:20:30.900]  government control yeah i really don't pay attention to that but
[03:20:30.900 --> 03:20:36.820]  i mean the the the the pentagon is heavily involved domestically now it
[03:20:36.820 --> 03:20:42.740]  used to be illegal in psyops in lice and but it
[03:20:42.740 --> 03:20:46.660]  didn't work in i mean congress has a seven percent approval rating and the
[03:20:46.660 --> 03:20:51.060]  military is waking up i mean i think when they tell military bases don't
[03:20:51.060 --> 03:20:55.060]  visit info wars dot com that i don't think i know that makes
[03:20:55.060 --> 03:20:58.340]  them then visit info wars dot com so these
[03:20:58.340 --> 03:21:03.220]  authoritarians had a big powerful rich country that became an empire and had a
[03:21:03.220 --> 03:21:07.940]  lot of great inventions and technology at their hands
[03:21:07.940 --> 03:21:11.700]  but the leveraging of western civilization towards evil
[03:21:11.700 --> 03:21:14.420]  i don't think of the final equation is going to go the way they think it is
[03:21:14.420 --> 03:21:18.420]  thanks for the call nick mary in new jersey thanks for holding you're on the
[03:21:18.420 --> 03:21:20.580]  air
[03:21:24.020 --> 03:21:33.380]  oh hello hi hi hi uh alex i love your show thank you um i'm newly retired so i
[03:21:33.380 --> 03:21:37.860]  for years i learned a lot on glendek and all that stuff but i really put it
[03:21:37.860 --> 03:21:42.500]  together recently a few months ago and it scared me to death
[03:21:42.500 --> 03:21:47.780]  want to you know but anyhow um and now i pray a lot basically
[03:21:47.780 --> 03:21:54.820]  but um concerning israel is uh it was um
[03:21:54.820 --> 03:22:02.340]  it was occupied by uh britain and then for a long time and uh then they had the
[03:22:02.340 --> 03:22:08.340]  battle for resolution in 1947 i believe and um
[03:22:08.340 --> 03:22:12.820]  also what was given to the people that were um
[03:22:12.820 --> 03:22:17.140]  the muslims they did get their own country they got jordan
[03:22:17.140 --> 03:22:23.380]  so um it was divided up and within a week after becoming a new country
[03:22:23.380 --> 03:22:27.620]  of course they were attacked by seven different uh muslim countries
[03:22:27.620 --> 03:22:31.780]  so well i mean that's how israel got the thing of the underdog and everybody's
[03:22:31.780 --> 03:22:37.700]  support was because israel continually got attacked and again
[03:22:37.700 --> 03:22:40.340]  the palestinians try to overthrow every country they're in
[03:22:40.340 --> 03:22:44.260]  they're constantly trying to overthrow uh lebanon they're constantly trying to
[03:22:44.260 --> 03:22:46.900]  overthrow and i'm not demonizing it was just a fact
[03:22:46.900 --> 03:22:51.140]  jordan and you know it's i mean look
[03:22:51.140 --> 03:22:55.300]  david was fighting the philistines thousands of years ago
[03:22:55.300 --> 03:22:59.460]  it's the same story you can pick a side both sides have their reasons both
[03:22:59.460 --> 03:23:03.220]  sides have their arguments uh my issue is
[03:23:03.220 --> 03:23:07.940]  the roth childs and the british created the state of israel
[03:23:07.940 --> 03:23:12.580]  as like a floating command base for the middle east
[03:23:12.580 --> 03:23:15.860]  and then they set it up as this endless situation
[03:23:15.860 --> 03:23:20.660]  and the palestinians live in horrible squalor uh i feel sorry for them on many
[03:23:20.660 --> 03:23:24.100]  many fronts but they're used as a political football
[03:23:24.100 --> 03:23:30.260]  you know you notice uh egypt borders daza and and you notice egypt won't let
[03:23:30.260 --> 03:23:33.940]  them in there but then will criticize israel all day for not letting them
[03:23:33.940 --> 03:23:39.300]  in so it's so complex i can barely even
[03:23:39.300 --> 03:23:43.860]  understand it and so i don't know how to properly explain
[03:23:43.860 --> 03:23:47.940]  his people because you can't explain it's a bunch of tribal weirdnesses
[03:23:47.940 --> 03:23:51.940]  and the only way you'd ever unify people
[03:23:51.940 --> 03:23:55.620]  would be if space aliens attacked that's why the elite are always saying that
[03:23:55.620 --> 03:24:00.340]  plus they don't want us unified they want to control us um
[03:24:00.340 --> 03:24:04.100]  that's why they want to balkanize this country and and have the foreigners not
[03:24:04.100 --> 03:24:07.380]  take on the marikana culture you can say what you want about it but
[03:24:07.380 --> 03:24:10.260]  owning property to be in let alone have a low taxes
[03:24:10.260 --> 03:24:13.540]  have a right to defend yourself that's pretty good culture if you've been to
[03:24:13.540 --> 03:24:17.140]  other countries they're getting rid of that so i mean that's my main
[03:24:17.140 --> 03:24:20.500]  objection uh and in israel is very authoritarian you
[03:24:20.500 --> 03:24:23.780]  know you can't proselytize christianity in israel
[03:24:23.780 --> 03:24:30.420]  to jews uh israel has race mixing laws and so my issue is i don't hate israel
[03:24:30.420 --> 03:24:34.340]  and i understand what's going on in israel but at the same time
[03:24:34.340 --> 03:24:37.540]  all these christian tv shows and stuff that just say worship israel you're
[03:24:37.540 --> 03:24:41.700]  going to hell my god is not israel and my god is not any of
[03:24:41.700 --> 03:24:44.820]  these countries or any of these men my god is god
[03:24:44.820 --> 03:24:49.780]  and you know no one wants to talk about the bad things that go on israel and
[03:24:49.780 --> 03:24:52.260]  you got a lot of jews in israel that don't like it
[03:24:52.260 --> 03:24:57.860]  and then again any mild criticism of israel gets attacked by the israeli
[03:24:57.860 --> 03:25:00.580]  lobby and then there's all here's the deal
[03:25:00.580 --> 03:25:04.260]  i'm not against israel but i'm not for what a lot of things israel does and
[03:25:04.260 --> 03:25:07.860]  i'm not against the palestinians i'm for them but i feel sad for them but i
[03:25:07.860 --> 03:25:10.980]  also don't want to endorse a lot of the bad stuff that some of the palestinians
[03:25:10.980 --> 03:25:14.100]  are involved in because it's two different sides and there's
[03:25:14.100 --> 03:25:18.260]  problems with each group is what i'm getting at and
[03:25:18.260 --> 03:25:24.740]  the viciousness of the pro palestinian crowd not even so much the palestinians
[03:25:24.740 --> 03:25:30.020]  but the white supremacists that support them and other groups
[03:25:30.020 --> 03:25:34.980]  where it's just a one-trick pony one-issue group
[03:25:34.980 --> 03:25:40.100]  it very dishonest group of people the anti-israel people
[03:25:40.100 --> 03:25:45.140]  are are just incredible liars in my experience and just very vicious
[03:25:45.140 --> 03:25:48.820]  and a lot of them are losers they're not successful
[03:25:48.820 --> 03:25:51.860]  they hate anybody that doesn't basically endorse
[03:25:51.860 --> 03:25:56.740]  all their bizarre worldviews and so i just don't want anything to do with any
[03:25:56.740 --> 03:25:59.860]  of it really i mean meanwhile al qaeda is running around
[03:25:59.860 --> 03:26:03.620]  slaughtering people everywhere and when i can't force israeli jews
[03:26:03.620 --> 03:26:07.140]  to criticize their government for openly being on the jewsland post
[03:26:07.140 --> 03:26:11.380]  saying you know should we work with isis when they're already doing it
[03:26:11.380 --> 03:26:15.460]  i mean israel loses any moral high ground it could have ever claimed doing
[03:26:15.460 --> 03:26:19.700]  that and i'm forced to come out against benjamin netanyahu for
[03:26:19.700 --> 03:26:23.620]  stuff like that uh it's just disgusting and it shows
[03:26:23.620 --> 03:26:29.220]  how reprobate our churches are our libertarian and christians are
[03:26:29.220 --> 03:26:33.380]  that people just don't have enough geopolitical understanding marrying
[03:26:33.380 --> 03:26:37.300]  to see what's happening i mean you say you obviously you support israel okay
[03:26:37.300 --> 03:26:39.940]  the existence of israel let's say you support that
[03:26:39.940 --> 03:26:45.940]  what do you think about israel's government supporting isis
[03:26:45.940 --> 03:26:50.020]  i think it's bad but i'll tell you what i think i think
[03:26:50.020 --> 03:26:54.500]  netanyahu was being blackmailed because months ago
[03:26:54.500 --> 03:26:59.940]  terry was over the air pressuring to break up israel they wanted to break it
[03:26:59.940 --> 03:27:03.540]  up block by block i also listen to erin kline
[03:27:03.540 --> 03:27:09.540]  okay but nobody nobody can israel's got 800 nuclear weapons
[03:27:09.540 --> 03:27:16.260]  israel uh two blocks uh arab it was a mishmash they were putting
[03:27:16.260 --> 03:27:22.820]  the pressure the screws on to no no i i i yeah yes go ahead
[03:27:22.820 --> 03:27:28.180]  and i think they they were i just had the feeling like they were blackmailing
[03:27:28.180 --> 03:27:33.060]  and also i wanted to and i think they were pressuring him
[03:27:33.060 --> 03:27:37.540]  to conform to whatever their ideas were terry was
[03:27:37.540 --> 03:27:42.260]  and some of the uh globalists well there's no doubt that israel
[03:27:42.260 --> 03:27:49.380]  is publicly endorsing isis now not until months of pressure
[03:27:49.380 --> 03:27:55.140]  i know i know i know i know here's my issue it's the world is so macchiavellian
[03:27:55.140 --> 03:28:00.340]  what happens when everybody starts cutting corners and everybody starts
[03:28:00.340 --> 03:28:04.100]  saying it doesn't matter if we side with this group today on that side tomorrow
[03:28:04.100 --> 03:28:09.940]  look at how the Arabs live with that view of the enemy of my enemy is my friend
[03:28:09.940 --> 03:28:14.500]  i mean that's just not how i do things and that's not how the west is operated
[03:28:14.500 --> 03:28:18.740]  until the last hundred years and it's it's just it's a form of mental illness
[03:28:18.740 --> 03:28:21.380]  is what i'm saying i hear what you're talking about
[03:28:21.380 --> 03:28:26.180]  i don't obsess on israel all day because it's never going away it's just a
[03:28:26.180 --> 03:28:29.300]  football issue it's like gay marriage it's just
[03:28:29.300 --> 03:28:33.060]  something to just keep going as a distraction from everything else going
[03:28:33.060 --> 03:28:35.780]  on in the world but i hear you i appreciate your call mary

[03:29:03.380 --> 03:29:07.380]  he's nothing more than an elected leader he's not the spirit of the country he's
[03:29:07.380 --> 03:29:13.460]  not the furor of israel uh despite the however he may act
[03:29:13.460 --> 03:29:16.340]  well that's another point people say you either support him or you don't or you
[03:29:16.340 --> 03:29:20.900]  hate israel that's not the case i don't support isis i mean period
[03:29:20.900 --> 03:29:24.420]  many israelis do not support netanyahu and they would they would gladly vote for
[03:29:24.420 --> 03:29:28.100]  someone else if there was anyone worth voting for
[03:29:28.100 --> 03:29:32.580]  well i mean well everybody's scared to run against him right
