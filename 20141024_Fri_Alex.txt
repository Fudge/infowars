[00:00.000 --> 00:13.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.080 --> 00:32.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:32.160 --> 00:41.320]  the evidence is mounting and mounting very very quickly that there is a massive
[00:41.320 --> 00:49.640]  cover-up underway taking place dealing with what's really happening with Ebola
[00:49.640 --> 00:53.680]  not just here but in Europe and Africa the Middle East and around other parts
[00:53.680 --> 00:59.520]  of the world if you've got health care workers that have some protection getting
[00:59.520 --> 01:03.320]  it you better believe the people in the waiting rooms the people on the
[01:03.320 --> 01:07.400]  ambulances the people that were around these individuals when they get sick the
[01:07.400 --> 01:10.920]  people that flew on the airplane with the nurse when she was contagious and had
[01:10.920 --> 01:18.280]  a fever have been exposed and you would expect to see some cases the fact that
[01:18.280 --> 01:23.520]  they say there aren't any new cases other than this doctor that came in from
[01:23.520 --> 01:29.200]  Africa the fact that they're saying there are no new cases when we have
[01:29.200 --> 01:33.240]  medical doctors on and off the record as well as Border Patrol saying that
[01:33.240 --> 01:37.400]  they're being told people with Ebola are being disappeared and we're even naming
[01:37.400 --> 01:42.800]  the hospitals where this is happening that's all up on infowars.com and
[01:42.800 --> 01:50.600]  prisonplanet.com right now in fact I'm gonna have our guys move some of the
[01:50.600 --> 01:57.000]  Kit Daniels Paul Watson Don Salazar articles about that breaking news
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.200]  yesterday and put that into a new post that has all three of those articles in
[02:01.200 --> 02:09.360]  it so that it stays on the front page of infowars.com because that is major
[02:09.360 --> 02:16.320]  major news and we need to force a debate about where are these people going
[02:16.320 --> 02:25.320]  that are disappearing notice we're not hearing rebuttals from the Harry Truman
[02:25.320 --> 02:31.880]  Medical Center there in Missouri to the medical doctor that told us that he's
[02:31.880 --> 02:35.160]  talked to doctors there that are his friends and nurses and they say people
[02:35.160 --> 02:38.640]  come in that look like they have Ebola in one case blood coming out of every
[02:38.640 --> 02:43.920]  orifice and they are disappeared by the feds that's what senior Border Patrol
[02:43.920 --> 02:47.560]  people have said on record and others off record and then we have another major
[02:47.560 --> 02:51.720]  medical doctor saying the same thing and we're following up let's not
[02:51.720 --> 02:57.800]  exaggerate more than 20 other medical doctors and nurses right now and a lot
[02:57.800 --> 03:02.000]  of these are getting confirmed confirmed that they work at these medical
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.520]  facilities around the country and that they're seeing the same thing we're
[03:06.520 --> 03:10.520]  getting hits on the east coast and then right up the middle from Texas right up
[03:10.520 --> 03:17.360]  into Illinois where people are traveling who came into Dallas and came into
[03:17.360 --> 03:25.160]  New York and other areas so I don't know how bad it really is but it's bad and
[03:25.160 --> 03:29.040]  the government is in the news spinning it saying oh there's no confidence in us
[03:29.040 --> 03:32.400]  why are people panicking the bowl is no big deal because you said you could be
[03:32.400 --> 03:35.800]  vomited on by somebody that had it you wouldn't get sick and that's just not
[03:35.800 --> 03:40.360]  true clearly this Ebola's gotten stronger clearly it used to only live in the body
[03:40.360 --> 03:45.240]  for three days or you'd be infectious and it show up in three days now it's 21
[03:45.240 --> 03:52.320]  days and 41 days then 70 days and everything we've been told has turned
[03:52.320 --> 03:57.520]  out to not be true so that's why there's a loss of confidence I don't want this
[03:57.520 --> 04:02.520]  to be a pandemic I don't want this even be an epidemic I want this to go away I
[04:02.520 --> 04:08.680]  live here just like you do I have children I don't want the ratings that
[04:08.680 --> 04:14.160]  come with a crisis like this because it distracts and diverts from all the other

[04:38.080 --> 04:44.000]  that report as well but again doctor in New York City is sick with Ebola and then
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.520]  you got the governor making statements like he's self-quarantine when
[04:48.520 --> 04:54.080]  everybody knows he was on the subway bowling restaurants and taxi cabs and

[08:17.360 --> 08:28.400]  ladies and gentlemen the Ebola crisis is beginning to spiral out of control we
[08:28.400 --> 08:35.560]  can unequivocally say the fixes in there is a concerted orchestrated effort
[08:35.560 --> 08:40.880]  taking place right now ladies and gentlemen by the state federal and
[08:40.880 --> 08:46.920]  also UN world government systems to deceive the public of the planet from
[08:46.920 --> 08:53.680]  Africa to the United States from Spain to Japan about the true scope of this
[08:53.680 --> 09:04.240]  crisis the populist continent of Africa home to close to a billion people what
[09:04.240 --> 09:11.560]  is it 800 million or something has at least five countries with people
[09:11.560 --> 09:17.800]  contracting Ebola spreading it at an exponential growth curve set to be 1.4
[09:17.800 --> 09:21.480]  million by the end of the year according to the World Health Organization's own
[09:21.480 --> 09:30.560]  computer models Ebola has mutated over 300 times this year alone according to
[09:30.560 --> 09:35.960]  the World Health Organization and CDC we know that it now can live in the body
[09:35.960 --> 09:42.760]  and basically be contagious over a very long period of time not the previous
[09:42.760 --> 09:47.480]  three days there's evidence that it's also contagious not just when you're
[09:47.480 --> 09:53.760]  showing symptoms but before but there's a concerted effort run by the news jarb to
[09:53.760 --> 09:58.760]  lie to the public about that that's why there's a massive loss of confidence
[09:58.760 --> 10:05.240]  taking place we interviewed a medical doctor yesterday on air the story and
[10:05.240 --> 10:11.440]  the video is up on info wars.com we talked about the Truman Medical Center in
[10:11.440 --> 10:17.240]  Missouri where reportedly at least one patient showing signs of Ebola bleeding
[10:17.240 --> 10:22.160]  out of every orifice was disappeared now whether they had Ebola or not the
[10:22.160 --> 10:29.680]  disappearance of patients in Dallas and in Kansas City outside Kansas City and
[10:29.680 --> 10:41.560]  other areas is a big deal and the media is so lap dog the establishment
[10:41.560 --> 10:47.160]  dinosaur media that's the only reason that they're able to pull stuff like
[10:47.160 --> 10:53.480]  this this is a big deal we have a former senior border patrol agent that we were
[10:53.480 --> 10:59.000]  put in contact with my current border patrol people that are senior on record
[10:59.000 --> 11:05.360]  here earlier in the month saying they're disappearing people who have Ebola coming
[11:05.360 --> 11:12.120]  in over the border and the CDC has vans and people in spacesuits disappearing
[11:12.120 --> 11:19.440]  them that was three weeks ago border agent Zach Taylor he joined us on the
[11:19.440 --> 11:29.040]  broadcast October 10th we have another major medical doctor in Dallas who
[11:29.040 --> 11:35.840]  manages major hospitals I'll just leave it at that who told us exactly what we
[11:35.840 --> 11:43.640]  heard from the medical doctor by name yesterday a week and a half ago when
[11:43.640 --> 11:51.960]  Anthony Guciardi and Paul Joseph Watson traveled to Dallas to investigate I know
[11:51.960 --> 11:55.480]  this individual he also lives in Austin part of the time I'll just leave it at
[11:55.480 --> 12:03.520]  that this medical doctor Paul Watson was there as well before he flew back to
[12:03.520 --> 12:10.920]  England last Monday so do you understand that straight-faced medical doctors are
[12:10.920 --> 12:17.800]  saying this is going on and no one rebuffs us no one responds
[12:21.040 --> 12:28.760]  it's going on there is a cover-up taking place governor Cuomo has come out and
[12:28.760 --> 12:34.200]  said that the medical doctor who contracted Ebola in Africa and who came
[12:34.200 --> 12:38.680]  back to the United States and who got through the JFK screening for Ebola
[12:38.680 --> 12:43.800]  which isn't screening had self-quarantined ladies and gentlemen he's on
[12:43.800 --> 12:48.800]  record being at a restaurant hours before he tested positive a subway that
[12:48.800 --> 12:58.000]  day a cab and a bowling alley he was a busy beaver and they're calling him a
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.400]  humanitarian doctor and I think doctors that go and fight Ebola are heroes and
[13:01.400 --> 13:07.400]  and other healthcare people I admire them but it's not heroic to not self
[13:07.400 --> 13:11.640]  quarantine in Africa out of the hot zone for a month is what they really
[13:11.640 --> 13:18.200]  recommend not 21 days and then to come back here you do not come back here when
[13:18.200 --> 13:23.640]  you've been in wards with people with Ebola you do not bring Ebola patients
[13:23.640 --> 13:26.800]  into the US and stick them in regular hospitals you don't bring them in
[13:26.800 --> 13:30.560]  period you treat them in country that's always been the default federal law
[13:30.560 --> 13:34.720]  England has the same laws they never brought one patient in they shut down
[13:34.720 --> 13:40.200]  their flights two months and two weeks ago keep saying two months now been it's
[13:40.200 --> 13:46.560]  now been six weeks France and others do you understand that's why I'm so
[13:46.560 --> 13:50.560]  concerned because this is definitely on purpose now you can't say it's an
[13:50.560 --> 13:56.560]  aptitude anymore some of it's an aptitude but at its heart is a deliberate
[13:56.560 --> 14:01.440]  conspiracy now you've got to ask why do they want this vaccine sales coming up
[14:01.440 --> 14:04.920]  in December January with new vaccines they've got online just magically for
[14:04.920 --> 14:11.400]  35 years of Ebola martial law medical martial law a distraction from all the
[14:11.400 --> 14:18.040]  scandals this new czar who gives speeches about there's too many black
[14:18.040 --> 14:23.160]  people in Africa who works for Al Gore and is a basically a eugenicist who's
[14:23.160 --> 14:26.880]  an expert at divvying up money in a public crisis and turning it into a
[14:26.880 --> 14:32.760]  boondoggle he's basically running the media now telling them to tell her about
[14:32.760 --> 14:36.960]  everything's fine that'd be one thing if they were trying to shut down the
[14:36.960 --> 14:40.120]  borders and shut down these flights they were telling us okay we have a few
[14:40.120 --> 14:45.120]  Ebola cases we're taking them to these military level four facilities or we
[14:45.120 --> 14:49.040]  can work on them in pressure rooms they're not doing that they're leaving
[14:49.040 --> 14:54.640]  everything open while disappearing people to train government to be in on the
[14:54.640 --> 14:59.600]  criminal conspiracy and to corrupt the medical core in this country that's why
[14:59.600 --> 15:04.080]  they always did secret medical experiments in other parts of the world
[15:04.080 --> 15:08.600]  and here domestically was to create groups of people who they could basically
[15:08.600 --> 15:13.840]  burn anytime they wanted to done secret medical experiments this is a
[15:13.840 --> 15:18.680]  corruption process of what they're doing and now Obama has come out we've got the
[15:18.680 --> 15:25.880]  clip with a chilling statement and Paul Joseph Watson has the article at
[15:25.880 --> 15:35.000]  info wars dot com and Obama says that this is a trial run for a deadlier
[15:35.000 --> 15:45.280]  airborne disease and that is exactly what is going on here they are bare
[15:45.280 --> 15:49.000]  minimum using this to practice controlling the media to practice
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.480]  getting hospitals to do what they're told under federalization to practice
[15:52.480 --> 15:59.160]  getting the police the fire departments the EMT's the hospitals the media to go
[15:59.160 --> 16:02.600]  along with lies you heard the police officers and firefighters calling
[16:02.600 --> 16:06.560]  yesterday one after another confirming what was already in mainstream news but
[16:06.560 --> 16:12.720]  not just in New York but departments in Missouri and Michigan and Texas saying
[16:12.720 --> 16:17.520]  yeah we've been told don't say Ebola we've been told cover up Ebola cases
[16:17.520 --> 16:24.080]  when we find them and then now people are disappearing Obama and here's the
[16:24.080 --> 16:27.600]  big angle we're gonna investigate this is what I want Watson all the riders to
[16:27.600 --> 16:32.080]  look into right now decide which of you's getting into it let's go with this
[16:32.080 --> 16:35.400]  because it just clicked remember that executive order he signed three months
[16:35.400 --> 16:39.880]  ago to permanently detain if they want anybody with any respiratory illness or
[16:39.880 --> 16:45.080]  sign of it that's what the flu coming up Obama signs executive order to allow
[16:45.080 --> 16:49.880]  attention of Americans with respiratory illnesses amendment comes in wake of a
[16:49.880 --> 16:54.000]  boluscare and the reason I knew this was so important is the minute Paul Joseph
[16:54.000 --> 17:03.440]  Watson reported on this the minute we reported on this we got attacked by
[17:03.440 --> 17:08.240]  White House run groups at MSNBC and media matters openly run by the White
[17:08.240 --> 17:11.520]  House direct on to it on record
[17:11.800 --> 17:17.320]  see they show how scared they are when we pointed that out that he changed it
[17:17.320 --> 17:21.560]  they went oh big deal there's been executive orders since the 60s if there's
[17:21.560 --> 17:25.120]  a contagious you know deadly disease we can quarantine you know it said for any
[17:25.120 --> 17:32.440]  sign of it it's unprecedented just like they freaked out two and a half months
[17:32.440 --> 17:35.920]  ago and we said shut down the borders shut down the West African flights when
[17:35.920 --> 17:40.800]  everybody else was doing it they said oh drudge is crazy Alex Jones is crazy and
[17:40.800 --> 17:47.960]  bad you know there's no Ebola danger it's racist it's insane it's deranged
[17:47.960 --> 17:53.560]  close quote to say that people could fly in or that if we bring medical workers
[17:53.560 --> 17:56.760]  in they could get people sick what's happening right now in New York City
[17:56.760 --> 18:04.000]  what happened in Spain my gut tells me there's probably hundreds of Ebola cases
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.240]  if not thousands right now in Europe in the U.S. in areas that let people in it's
[18:09.240 --> 18:13.120]  a no-brainer we know the spread rate the average Ebola patient infects two
[18:13.120 --> 18:18.520]  people look it up that CDC's own numbers and now they keep saying oh is it has it
[18:18.520 --> 18:23.280]  mutated has it gotten tougher they have all the mutations they know they're just
[18:23.280 --> 18:26.400]  not telling us we don't need them to tell us of course it's gotten more
[18:26.400 --> 18:29.440]  powerful we're gonna skip this network break this is so important stations
[18:29.440 --> 18:32.560]  should not be airing over this because this is a network break this is this is
[18:32.560 --> 18:36.760]  our money we pay to not have to have some of these ads this is so important
[18:36.760 --> 18:40.600]  okay my point is it's so important we lose money we don't air these ads because
[18:40.600 --> 18:43.240]  quite frankly the ads won't even matter soon if we don't turn this country
[18:43.240 --> 18:48.600]  around and this planet around from the evil program that's being brought in to
[18:48.600 --> 18:51.680]  they fund the terrorists they attack us they take our liberties they let the
[18:51.680 --> 18:57.520]  Ebola in people start dying they use that as a way to power grab so let's play
[18:57.520 --> 19:06.920]  the Obama clip of him saying that this is basically a trial run extremely
[19:06.920 --> 19:13.200]  cryptic here it is there may come a time sometime in the future where we are
[19:13.200 --> 19:20.000]  dealing with a airborne disease that is much easier to catch and is deadly and
[19:20.000 --> 19:28.880]  in some ways this has created a trial run for federal state and local public
[19:28.880 --> 19:33.080]  health officials and health care providers as well as the American
[19:33.080 --> 19:36.680]  people to understand the nature of that and why it's so important that we're
[19:36.680 --> 19:40.720]  continually building out our public health systems but we're also practicing
[19:40.720 --> 19:44.440]  there you go and keeping them in tip-top shape that's right it's about
[19:44.440 --> 19:49.120]  federalization internationalization of the health care centralization and
[19:49.120 --> 19:54.040]  central deception and then getting everybody used to during the crisis
[19:54.040 --> 20:02.680]  lying but it isn't a trial run Ebola's here it's killing people this disease
[20:02.680 --> 20:08.720]  doesn't kill one-tenth of one percent like the flu does this disease kills 70
[20:08.720 --> 20:14.800]  percent when you get medical treatment and they could stop it let's say it
[20:14.800 --> 20:18.200]  wasn't even already here yet we know it's getting in from medical workers
[20:18.200 --> 20:22.760]  they're bringing in to Europe don't bring them in self-quarantine in Africa
[20:22.760 --> 20:25.880]  if you're gonna go volunteer if you're gonna play the part of Superman now
[20:25.880 --> 20:31.160]  let's get the drudge report calm and some of the top stories there road
[20:31.160 --> 20:36.240]  subway this is the doctor hours before testing positive had cleared enhanced
[20:36.240 --> 20:42.120]  airport screening continuing cops caught this is powerful video we're gonna play
[20:42.120 --> 20:48.920]  in a moment cops caught throwing a bowl of waste in public trash cans that's
[20:48.920 --> 20:53.320]  right they've gone into his house they're quarantining it and they just
[20:53.320 --> 21:01.680]  have cops throwing the the the garbage in the trash the HHS says trust us it's
[21:01.680 --> 21:06.000]  kind of like Nosferatu count Dracula comes your door trust me can you just
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.720]  invite me and I'd like to be a friendly neighbor and then there's our article
[21:09.720 --> 21:19.480]  claim patients being disappeared thank God that drugs report calm thinks that's
[21:19.480 --> 21:24.360]  important do you think it's important that a medical doctor on record who works
[21:24.360 --> 21:29.760]  for a major health center came on air and enlisted what he's being told is
[21:29.760 --> 21:37.520]  happening with people that appear to have a babola disappearing and now we
[21:37.520 --> 21:46.600]  have top doctor says us system is engaged in an Ebola cover-up top top doctor
[21:46.600 --> 21:53.400]  us health authorities waging mass Ebola cover-up and it's true that doctor we
[21:53.400 --> 21:58.360]  had on run some medical centers so he is a top doctor and the CEO of the medical
[21:58.360 --> 22:02.320]  center called him and said I like you but you better explain this isn't in our
[22:02.320 --> 22:07.000]  medical center or you're gonna be toast and he said that that wasn't his medical
[22:07.000 --> 22:14.840]  center that we said it's the Truman Center but what we're getting at here is
[22:15.400 --> 22:19.320]  that I'm not just getting this from him I'm getting this from Border Patrol on
[22:19.320 --> 22:24.040]  and off record I'm getting it from ICE I'm getting it from another major
[22:24.040 --> 22:33.480]  medical doctor in the DFW area the Dallas Fort Worth area my hometown the
[22:33.480 --> 22:42.320]  Metroplex site of patient zero and we have all these doctors who don't want
[22:42.320 --> 22:46.040]  to go on record saying basically the same thing and we're desperately trying
[22:46.040 --> 22:50.840]  to work through all these cases and vet it all right now but this is what they
[22:50.840 --> 22:54.880]  believe is going on right now so credible doctors and health care
[22:54.880 --> 23:03.600]  professionals are saying that there's a cover-up going on and no one is
[23:03.600 --> 23:09.440]  publishing this no one is investigating this no one cares about this but in
[23:09.440 --> 23:14.720]  full wars.com prisonplanet.com and drudgereport.com everybody else
[23:14.720 --> 23:19.120]  wouldn't dare stick their neck out to save their own butts in my view other
[23:19.120 --> 23:23.320]  conservative and libertarian talk show host where are you on this you have kids
[23:23.320 --> 23:29.360]  too you don't even have to follow my story or our witnesses put a call out to
[23:29.360 --> 23:37.040]  medical doctors yourself you'll they'll call you you can have them on I was
[23:37.040 --> 23:40.320]  listening to a big syndicated radio show this morning driving in and they were
[23:40.320 --> 23:43.360]  saying yeah there's some people claiming that there's a bowl of patients
[23:43.360 --> 23:46.840]  getting covered up but you know I don't know about those sources clearly a jab
[23:46.840 --> 23:56.440]  at us listen listen you need the people that have media power need to get on
[23:56.440 --> 24:01.680]  this right now it's ahead of a midterm election that's why they've got this
[24:01.680 --> 24:07.480]  czar in there this this Al Gore spin master who has no Ebola training to
[24:07.480 --> 24:10.880]  basically have the media shut up and engage in a cover-up and that's the real
[24:10.880 --> 24:15.280]  evidence of how much trouble we're in is having Cuomo who says if you want to own
[24:15.280 --> 24:19.080]  guns or don't like abortion get out of the state of New York total gangster
[24:19.080 --> 24:27.880]  thug saying to the New York Times and others in press conferences that oh
[24:27.880 --> 24:32.640]  this guy self-quarantine there's no danger to spread everyone knows the
[24:32.640 --> 24:37.080]  police are on record and the EMTs are on record that when he was interviewed he
[24:37.080 --> 24:42.360]  said I've been all over the place it's like this NBC reporter that was supposed
[24:42.360 --> 24:46.800]  to be self-quarantining the one that says the medical correspondent the one
[24:46.800 --> 24:51.040]  that says take your bleep and shots your vaccines and she was caught at a
[24:51.040 --> 24:55.840]  restaurant this guy knows he came back from an Ebola stricken area treating
[24:55.840 --> 25:01.200]  Ebola patients some of these doctors go home to their kids man I would shit in
[25:01.200 --> 25:06.120]  Africa in a hotel room for 30 days before I came back knowing I didn't have
[25:06.120 --> 25:14.520]  it and then the cops are in his house throwing a bowl of garbage and again
[25:14.520 --> 25:18.880]  this broke on alternative media it's now CNN notice how everything breaks on
[25:18.880 --> 25:24.760]  info wars.com or drudge or world net daily.com or just none of it breaks on
[25:24.760 --> 25:27.640]  these so-called main channels because they're a bunch of cowards that won't
[25:27.640 --> 25:33.160]  stick their head up above the grass to save their own lives or to even be
[25:33.160 --> 25:37.320]  successful journalists what do you think it's all about being a real
[25:37.320 --> 25:42.920]  journalist is about going with evidence but also with your gut when you've got
[25:42.920 --> 25:50.400]  to get it out there to draw attention to something you people are a joke so
[25:50.400 --> 25:58.680]  Ebola has reached the concrete jungle population 20 million NYC Ebola confirmed
[25:58.680 --> 26:05.080]  in New York patient road subway went bowling took taxi and then I've got
[26:05.080 --> 26:09.960]  video I'll dig it up here of Cuomo saying it's not true man these people
[26:09.960 --> 26:15.960]  make me sick you know why people don't have any confidence in you Cuomo and the
[26:15.960 --> 26:19.240]  New York mayor is complaining as well because you're a pack of congenital
[26:19.240 --> 26:25.880]  liars see they don't work in the normal business world the middle-class retail
[26:25.880 --> 26:32.760]  business world where everything is about quality it's about service it's
[26:32.760 --> 26:36.320]  about relationships it's about people knowing who your daddy was and who your
[26:36.320 --> 26:41.960]  mama was and all of you people in politics and big fortune 100 companies
[26:41.960 --> 26:45.720]  going around with your PR and your screw jobs you may have conned some of the
[26:45.720 --> 26:49.040]  people but you can't fool most people anymore and they're done with you and
[26:49.040 --> 26:54.760]  we wouldn't believe we wouldn't take a glass of ice water from you in the
[26:54.760 --> 27:00.760]  Sahara desert if our life depended on it because we know what you are a pack of
[27:00.760 --> 27:10.720]  crooks and a pack of liars makes me want to throw up let's go over some of
[27:10.720 --> 27:16.960]  these headlines CDC cleared a bowl of patient Craig Spencer at JFK enhanced
[27:16.960 --> 27:20.080]  screening will not prevent spreadable disease that's all the doctors have said
[27:20.080 --> 27:24.640]  pointing a thermometer at somebody's face isn't going to do Jack Diddly squat
[27:24.640 --> 27:31.600]  they know to take Advil or Ibuprofen both will lower it when you're coming in
[27:31.600 --> 27:38.120]  acetaminophen these people it turns out no they're fleeing here to get medical
[27:38.120 --> 27:42.240]  treatment what do you think happens when countries are collapsing and they're
[27:42.240 --> 27:46.880]  going to leave the conduit open to where America you can't fly to France can't
[27:46.880 --> 27:50.720]  fly to Colombia can't fly to Saudi Arabia can't fly to England can't fly to
[27:50.720 --> 27:55.920]  Germany can't fly to Japan can't fly to China you can fly to the toilet you want
[27:55.920 --> 28:00.240]  to come vomit and defecate all your bloody Ebola out I'm not being gross here
[28:00.240 --> 28:10.000]  this is what I'm really happening we are a huge Ebola porta potty that's what the
[28:10.000 --> 28:17.960]  globalists are doing to us CDC cleared Ebola patient stocks fall on Ebola fears
[28:17.960 --> 28:23.480]  in New York City Kurt Nemo info wars.com investors believe gold and silver may
[28:23.480 --> 28:29.320]  experience a rebound yet what I say last week my gut told me it's not hard
[28:29.320 --> 28:36.480]  doctor in New York City is sick with Ebola what do you know New York Times NYC
[28:36.480 --> 28:40.560]  Health Commissioner wrongly claims Ebola patient self-isolated yeah that's
[28:40.560 --> 28:45.540]  another one that did that and Cuomo did it may have stopped and gone to a
[28:45.540 --> 28:48.120]  restaurant along the way that's that's how you quarantine as you go to a
[28:48.120 --> 28:55.120]  restaurant maybe he gets up there and you know in a hallucination with 104
[28:55.120 --> 28:59.880]  fever squats over the punch bowl and that's how we all quarantine it and
[28:59.880 --> 29:05.120]  humanitarian doctor test positive for Ebola in NYC Fox News New York
[29:05.120 --> 29:11.240]  humanitarian doctor you know I don't really think he's very humanitarian he's
[29:11.240 --> 29:14.680]  a doctor he knows you she should have or maybe he did self-quarantine maybe I'm
[29:14.680 --> 29:18.920]  wrong it doesn't say that in Africa and then he still had it and got it on his
[29:18.920 --> 29:23.560]  way out but I doubt that's the case just like this NBC woman we're gonna take
[29:23.560 --> 29:27.600]  your calls on this subject if you're in the New York City surrounding area or

[33:26.800 --> 33:34.720]  on hundreds of subjects to brag and say gee I'm real smart they have never
[33:34.720 --> 33:40.400]  allowed Ebola into a country knowingly until now and it's been done all over
[33:40.400 --> 33:47.800]  the world the default is don't do that and it's illegal from England to the US
[33:47.800 --> 33:54.640]  but England is following the law Spain in the US or not they've never when
[33:54.640 --> 33:59.440]  there's a huge outbreak or pandemic of something super deadly allowed people to
[33:59.440 --> 34:06.160]  fly in from that country there's always a flight embargo put in for a time or
[34:06.160 --> 34:11.600]  people have to have a medical screening from a facility a certified hospital
[34:11.600 --> 34:17.320]  marked 24 hours old or no older bill to get on the plane there's different
[34:17.320 --> 34:24.480]  things they do none of that's being done so something's going on here just like
[34:24.480 --> 34:28.520]  we said two plus months ago and got attacked and let me tell you it's
[34:28.520 --> 34:34.920]  lonely when there's only info wars calm and drugs report calm and world net
[34:34.920 --> 34:40.320]  daily calm that two and a half months ago we're warning about this and being
[34:40.320 --> 34:44.360]  attacked what's wrong with people I don't want to be one of the only people
[34:44.360 --> 34:52.400]  that knows what's going on I don't want to be a nation of morons only our
[34:52.400 --> 34:55.640]  ignorance and trusting the system allows this the good news is people don't
[34:55.640 --> 34:58.680]  trust the system but they don't know what to do and quite frankly I don't
[34:58.680 --> 35:03.080]  quite know what to do either we have them obviously bringing Ebola in they're
[35:03.080 --> 35:06.640]  obviously covering up something it's probably it's probably spreading all
[35:06.640 --> 35:11.240]  over okay I've been saying that now this doctor's got it CJ keeps pointing out and
[35:11.240 --> 35:14.680]  I agree with him and they're running the board that why is it only health care
[35:14.680 --> 35:21.440]  professionals that were allowed to hear have it do you really believe that no
[35:21.440 --> 35:26.240]  it's because they can threaten their licenses they have high IQs on average
[35:26.240 --> 35:32.760]  and can be managed and because the nurses unions and people can't be shut up so
[35:32.760 --> 35:37.720]  it's kind of a dichotomy there a paradox but if you're a poor African who came
[35:37.720 --> 35:43.040]  in here illegally or flew in with this open border visa and that's who they
[35:43.040 --> 35:46.800]  report up in Missouri disappeared out of the hospital there at the Truman Center
[35:46.800 --> 35:51.880]  a black African out of West Africa they're taking them to military bases and
[35:51.880 --> 35:58.080]  no one is there to basically stand up for them and quite frankly I'm mad at
[35:58.080 --> 36:02.240]  them coming over here and don't like what they've done it's clear that patient
[36:02.240 --> 36:08.160]  zero knew he had it and came over here and then died spreading it but if they
[36:08.160 --> 36:11.040]  set the precedent on these folks that are bringing Ebola in to disappear them
[36:11.040 --> 36:14.880]  with Obama's executive order they can say Alex Jones might have had it and he
[36:14.880 --> 36:19.680]  disappeared and if not this go around two years from now five years from now
[36:19.680 --> 36:26.440]  this is a giant test run for an airborne event like the president said and it
[36:26.440 --> 36:31.120]  could already be airborne even the New York Times reported a month ago one month
[36:31.120 --> 36:35.400]  after infall wars reported on it and drudge reported on it and then we were
[36:35.400 --> 36:40.880]  attacked for daring to say it could be going airborne and linking to CDC white
[36:40.880 --> 36:49.280]  papers from 2012 and the Smith Sonian Institute see they don't like us because
[36:49.280 --> 36:57.160]  we link to real papers and real bills remember that congressman from Tennessee
[36:57.160 --> 37:02.480]  on Jesse Ventura's TV show the one that I basically wrote the investigation for
[37:02.480 --> 37:07.280]  I was in a bunch of the episodes like 10 of the episodes but that one I was on it
[37:07.280 --> 37:11.800]  and I said look at this bill go to this facility go to these plastic coffins for
[37:11.800 --> 37:15.600]  an Ebola outbreak which they now admit were for that confirmed now five years
[37:15.600 --> 37:19.520]  later but the show was three years ago and Ventura goes the congressman at the
[37:19.520 --> 37:25.760]  Capitol and he goes what about the bill for the FEMA camps to incarcerate
[37:25.760 --> 37:30.280]  political dissidents at the emergency centers establishment act and the
[37:30.280 --> 37:36.280]  congressman with his fake southern accent goes what bill is that governor and
[37:36.280 --> 37:40.600]  he goes there's no such bill to Ventura materials gatherers because I'm sorry
[37:40.600 --> 37:44.680]  aliens aren't gonna come out of big machines and eat my children these are
[37:44.680 --> 37:48.840]  actual quotes Ventura goes here's the bill and the congressman looks at it I
[37:48.840 --> 37:56.720]  forget his name and goes oh that bill he sounded like scarlet oh hair and gone
[37:56.720 --> 38:01.480]  with the wind or something I played that clip probably a hundred times there we
[38:01.480 --> 38:06.720]  could probably cue it up play it again oh that bill and if you don't think there
[38:06.720 --> 38:12.080]  isn't media control that's why I bring this up I'm not allowed to say what
[38:12.080 --> 38:16.040]  happened okay I'm only allowed to say what Ventura is told on there that
[38:16.040 --> 38:20.040]  Homeland Security went to Time Warner and threatened them and they spoke on the
[38:20.040 --> 38:23.080]  floor of the house and followed an official complaint against Time Warner
[38:23.080 --> 38:27.520]  and then that episode never aired again was pulled off Tevo and pulled off
[38:27.520 --> 38:32.320]  YouTube folks are always re-uploading it but the views with with millions of
[38:32.320 --> 38:38.240]  views that the copies have been taken down I'm not allowed to tell you what
[38:38.240 --> 38:42.240]  happened that's the problem with being a journalist and wearing that hat is I'm
[38:42.240 --> 38:46.840]  told things in confidence and then I'm told by the way can't tell anybody but
[38:46.840 --> 38:56.240]  let's just say this I just I'm so sick and I'll be able to tell people stuff I'm
[38:56.240 --> 39:00.400]  gonna get Ventura back on and insist he tell it I'm tired of it but believe me
[39:00.400 --> 39:04.040]  folks you want to know how evil this government is you need to understand need
[39:04.040 --> 39:07.880]  to understand people have died for the information you hear here do you
[39:07.880 --> 39:14.000]  understand that I was sent information just two weeks ago by detectives on the
[39:14.000 --> 39:27.520]  west coast of a plot to kill me and the guy even came here to do it and then he
[39:27.520 --> 39:31.080]  was unable to so he went and killed a cop that's kind of stuff I deal with on
[39:31.080 --> 39:34.040]  daily basis I'm not being a drama queen here ladies and gentlemen I was sent a
[39:34.040 --> 39:40.200]  file three inches thick by him that's the kind of stuff that's going on do you
[39:40.200 --> 39:51.480]  understand that he's dead now too but this is real do you understand that and
[39:51.480 --> 39:57.480]  this person was of course linked to the feds I should add again so when they try
[39:57.480 --> 40:00.680]  to take info wars down or they try to take me down they're trying to take you
[40:00.680 --> 40:07.440]  down you understand that there's a reason Glenn Beck's got 50 security people
[40:07.440 --> 40:18.720]  now I've got security it's called m4 and 357 it's called deck guns shotgun
[40:18.720 --> 40:25.160]  semi-auto but I'm not afraid I expected all of this I I intend to take on the
[40:25.160 --> 40:29.800]  dragon I intend to take on the new world order and whatever happens happens I
[40:29.800 --> 40:35.160]  mean I'm not as a hard-working smart person as my grandfathers were and in
[40:35.160 --> 40:38.280]  many ways as my dad is and look at the stuff they just routinely did back then
[40:38.280 --> 40:42.640]  people will go fight and die in foreign countries for their nation but our
[40:42.640 --> 40:47.200]  nation itself is being destroyed from within by globalists that hate this
[40:47.200 --> 40:50.120]  country by enemies
[40:55.080 --> 41:01.200]  now I know when a so Veto was here last time he said you know there are people
[41:01.200 --> 41:05.480]  here trying to kill you in this studio during a break and he goes and we've
[41:05.480 --> 41:10.200]  stopped it and he said you better appreciate us I was just like oh and
[41:10.200 --> 41:15.240]  now I've been sent the whole file I'm not even supposed to talk about it and
[41:15.240 --> 41:23.440]  there's other stuff going on so it's just it's just over the top and my move I
[41:23.440 --> 41:27.480]  mean my life is like a movie and your life is like a movie to ladies and
[41:27.480 --> 41:31.000]  gentlemen because you've got most the government that's not bad most of the
[41:31.000 --> 41:36.680]  corporations aren't bad it's key people in high-level positions and then most
[41:36.680 --> 41:40.000]  people even in high-level positions aren't bad they just don't know what to
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.640]  do because the public is so ignorant and so stupid that even if they go public
[41:44.640 --> 41:48.800]  and ask for your help most of you will just spit on them because anybody that
[41:48.800 --> 41:52.760]  sticks their head up anybody that tries to tell the truth anybody that tries to
[41:52.760 --> 42:02.120]  get involved it's easy for all the cowards out there to just look at
[42:02.120 --> 42:06.360]  whoever's in the arena and then judge us and make fun of us and show how we
[42:06.360 --> 42:10.840]  failed or how we didn't do something right it's it's it's a creative losers
[42:10.840 --> 42:14.880]  this country doesn't operate like America used to and I'm not saying the
[42:14.880 --> 42:20.440]  country was ever perfect but compared to others it was special it was unique and
[42:20.440 --> 42:25.160]  now we still have some of the good left but it runs parallel to all the bad and
[42:25.160 --> 42:30.520]  I got calls from New York and Texas from Dallas and you name it on on on your
[42:30.520 --> 42:35.480]  take on Ebola what you're seeing on the ground in your area let me just recap
[42:35.480 --> 42:40.360]  what's happening and I'll go to your phone calls humanitarian doctor test
[42:40.360 --> 42:46.360]  positive for Ebola in NYC in the past if you were in a hot zone you would then
[42:46.360 --> 42:50.480]  take yourself out of the hot zone in the country self-quarantine for at least
[42:50.480 --> 42:54.080]  30 days and then come back in I don't know why all these different doctors
[42:54.080 --> 42:57.920]  aren't doing this and I've talked to medical doctors that say it's very
[42:57.920 --> 43:05.960]  suspicious show why is it only medical quote professionals that are getting it
[43:05.960 --> 43:10.200]  well that's because they're whisking away people who aren't and disappearing
[43:10.200 --> 43:14.240]  them so where's the media on that front read the story at drudgereport.com
[43:14.240 --> 43:18.840]  it's the top story in the top left-hand corner the top block bottom story
[43:18.840 --> 43:23.040]  claim patients being disappeared go watch the doctor talk about it we
[43:23.040 --> 43:26.560]  interviewed go look at Border Patrol saying the same thing go read our
[43:26.560 --> 43:32.240]  article media prostitutes out there get off the bench stop being cowards stop
[43:32.240 --> 43:37.320]  letting other people always take the front and try to save this country this
[43:37.320 --> 43:42.240]  is only happening because so much of the media are lap dogs and repeat whatever
[43:42.240 --> 43:49.360]  they're told to say what are new york cops doing going in the doctor's house
[43:49.360 --> 43:54.920]  and bagging up the trash and medical waste and putting it out at the curb
[43:55.520 --> 44:04.120]  what is wrong with this country that's just some of the news up on infall
[44:04.120 --> 44:16.720]  wars.com and prisonplanet.com again Cuomo has come out and said that he'd
[44:16.720 --> 44:22.960]  self-quarantine along with the health commissioner that is not true you got
[44:22.960 --> 44:33.400]  cops in paper masks that do zero for Ebola and rubber gloves and then the
[44:33.400 --> 44:37.760]  cops just took their gloves off and their mask off and then walk off with the
[44:37.760 --> 44:40.640]  mask in their hand there was any a bowl on the front of that I mean this is a
[44:40.640 --> 44:44.920]  joke are we really this stupid if we're this stupid maybe we deserve the
[44:44.920 --> 44:51.240]  globalist to wipe us out that's what they say we act so dumb and the police I
[44:51.240 --> 44:57.640]  know are pretty smart they're not dumb like that what is going on here
[44:57.640 --> 45:10.560]  New York Times can you get Ebola from a bowling ball but they basically say
[45:10.560 --> 45:16.360]  it's extremely unlikely more bull okay I want to go to your calls I've got a lot
[45:16.360 --> 45:23.000]  of other news on this front I need to settle down a little bit I was just
[45:23.000 --> 45:33.160]  thinking about what a twilight zone world this is and how crazy it's gotten
[45:33.160 --> 45:38.360]  we got jihadi people shooting up the parliament we got open borders we got
[45:38.360 --> 45:41.560]  our government funding al-qaeda while our troops fight them on the other hand
[45:41.560 --> 45:46.680]  it's just pure evil it's a policy of Satan is what I would call it the
[45:46.680 --> 45:51.840]  mindset that's being followed is so evil and if you don't know the MO of the
[45:51.840 --> 45:56.000]  globalist it doesn't make sense but once you know it it's so obvious what
[45:56.000 --> 46:01.320]  they're going to do next and they want a bowl of the spread so the question is
[46:01.320 --> 46:05.400]  why we're gonna go to your calls I personally am trying to get my immune
[46:05.400 --> 46:10.800]  system boosted I'm taking survival shield x2 nason iodine from deep earth
[46:10.800 --> 46:17.040]  crystal source no other manufacturer has it it's 50% stronger than our last
[46:17.040 --> 46:23.200]  survival shield classic which is also available as well it's so it's weaker so
[46:23.200 --> 46:28.280]  it's kids seem to take it better oxy powder that flushes out your guts to
[46:28.280 --> 46:34.840]  boost your immune system absolutely key we have the DNA force that has the coq
[46:34.840 --> 46:38.880]  10 of the organic type and the ppq of the organic type and a bunch of other
[46:38.880 --> 46:43.440]  key things that are known to basically be vitamin c squared it's
[46:43.440 --> 46:50.480]  nutraceutical the maximum level I mean just one serving of it I think they
[46:50.480 --> 46:53.640]  were saying is equivalent of 500 cartons of blueberries of just one of the
[46:53.640 --> 47:02.200]  ingredients one kilo of one of the key ingredients the bio pqq is $12,000 a
[47:02.200 --> 47:11.240]  kilo before it's then mixed and put into the bottles info wars life calm info
[47:11.240 --> 47:18.080]  wars store.com or 888-253-3139 and I think and what I've talked to Dr. Group
[47:18.080 --> 47:22.400]  and others he's coming on next Tuesday with some of the documentation on this
[47:22.400 --> 47:30.720]  that true nason iodine like x2 is just as important maybe more important for
[47:30.720 --> 47:36.080]  bolstering your body's natural defenses than colloidal silver and of course we
[47:36.080 --> 47:41.760]  have colloidal silver 30 parts per million as well and info wars life calm and
[47:41.760 --> 47:46.240]  that is the silver bullet the name is silver bullet I don't believe anything
[47:46.240 --> 47:50.920]  is a true complete silver bullet because some people are just immune to a
[47:50.920 --> 47:54.880]  bullet period other people no matter what you do they're gonna end up dying but
[47:54.880 --> 48:00.520]  that's what I'm doing I get as much sun as you can in my view it's your own you
[48:00.520 --> 48:03.400]  know medical advice but folks have gone out and talked to their physicians about
[48:03.400 --> 48:06.720]  the advice I and others have said that we're using it's not even advice what
[48:06.720 --> 48:09.760]  I'm doing personally what medical doctors and others nutritionists and
[48:09.760 --> 48:12.520]  pharmacists have said here on the broadcast we should get pharmacists
[48:12.520 --> 48:16.640]  been fuchs on today maybe even a fourth hour of overdrive he can do it get his
[48:16.640 --> 48:19.840]  take on it he's I know medical doctors that hear him and say he just has so much
[48:19.840 --> 48:24.200]  knowledge even more than they have on the front of compounding and so much more
[48:24.200 --> 48:27.120]  the lung shield is absolutely essential when you're traveling especially with

[48:49.160 --> 48:54.760]  and Bruce Ray Mike Patty and others John calling from New York to New York City
[48:54.760 --> 48:58.800]  or New York State what's your take on this thank you Alex for taking my call
[48:58.800 --> 49:02.040]  I'm actually right across the river in the state of New Jersey I really
[49:02.040 --> 49:06.960]  appreciate you running tip of the spear on on these issues very few people are
[49:06.960 --> 49:12.080]  I have to be honest I've tried to get my friends to prepare and not many people
[49:12.080 --> 49:17.320]  listening and I can't explain it but people should know and you have this on
[49:17.320 --> 49:23.640]  info wars that the US Army you Samurit has done studies on Ebola and it has
[49:23.640 --> 49:29.040]  aerosolization comparable to influenza A. Yes sir Kit Daniels wrote a story three
[49:29.040 --> 49:32.680]  days ago I'll have it reposted to the top of info wars.com because I want to
[49:32.680 --> 49:36.440]  focus on that I apologize I haven't they say that once the temperature goes
[49:36.440 --> 49:42.440]  below 45 degrees that it then has the equivalent of influenza A and is
[49:42.440 --> 49:48.120]  basically airborne yes yes go ahead yeah absolutely so all I would say is I
[49:48.120 --> 49:52.480]  urge people now with the time to prepare because the government is not going
[49:52.480 --> 49:55.000]  to be able to even if they wanted to they're not going to be able to help us
[49:55.000 --> 49:59.080]  but people are taking a backseat to all this because they say well the nurses
[49:59.080 --> 50:03.520]  are cured and the doctors are cured they're getting blood transfusions and
[50:03.520 --> 50:07.600]  they're getting care that none of us are going to get if this goes goes viral so
[50:07.600 --> 50:10.280]  to speak because there won't be a lot of the transfusions there won't be enough
[50:10.280 --> 50:14.960]  donors yeah exactly so now's the time to prepare I mean I think you're doing a
[50:14.960 --> 50:21.360]  fantastic job urging people to get their their health up up to par and people
[50:21.360 --> 50:27.200]  should also considering get get and 100 masks gloves and then be smart yeah for
[50:27.200 --> 50:30.960]  those that don't know for those that don't know right now it's already hard
[50:30.960 --> 50:33.240]  I'm gonna hold you over certainly you finish because you're selling a smart
[50:33.240 --> 50:38.400]  caller so stay there I want you to finish your your point what he's saying
[50:38.400 --> 50:44.160]  is the army said ten years ago and again a few years ago in studies that get
[50:44.160 --> 50:47.600]  Daniel's link to that no one cares about literally the story hardly even got any
[50:47.600 --> 50:51.440]  views or reads because it's so important of course something about Britney Spears
[50:51.440 --> 50:56.040]  or some Madonna what I guess that once it gets cold is essentially airborne

[54:10.440 --> 54:16.240]  tiles and not in feature but the top tiles that he wrote last week was it
[54:16.240 --> 54:22.240]  Monday with the Army's own Fort Dietrich reports that Ebola once the
[54:22.240 --> 54:26.240]  weather gets cold essentially is airborne it's sunlight that ends up
[54:26.240 --> 54:34.400]  killing it it's normally a jungle virus but that's just a jungle mammals but it
[54:34.400 --> 54:38.440]  actually likes cold weather and I didn't know that's all I read these army
[54:38.440 --> 54:43.760]  reports so I'm so glad I went to John's call because I tend to lose the forest
[54:43.760 --> 54:48.760]  for the trees that's why I'm freaking out if they let enough cases in a few
[54:48.760 --> 54:52.920]  dozen or so which I think's happened clearly and it starts spreading and
[54:52.920 --> 54:58.400]  then it gets cold in places like New York City oh this is going to be like
[54:58.400 --> 55:05.120]  the flu but maybe one half of one tenth of one percent of the tens of millions
[55:05.120 --> 55:10.760]  that get flew die this will kill 70% and it's like a blood bomb goes off of
[55:10.760 --> 55:16.440]  somebody gets this it will be hell and I just want the politicians to know you're
[55:16.440 --> 55:20.960]  going to pay you're going to pay
[55:21.640 --> 55:27.320]  John in New York or across the water in New Jersey go ahead make your point sure
[55:27.320 --> 55:31.440]  thanks Alex just want one last point I'll free up the the lines if anyone I
[55:31.440 --> 55:34.000]  know you have a lot of interesting people listening especially Hollywood
[55:34.000 --> 55:40.040]  people I urge anyone that has any cloud or has any connections please tell tell
[55:40.040 --> 55:43.520]  the powers that be they've got to stop the flights it has nothing to do with
[55:43.520 --> 55:48.800]  racism it's all about common sense protecting protecting our country and
[55:48.800 --> 55:53.600]  if this case in New York doesn't prove anything else it proves that clearly
[55:53.600 --> 55:58.880]  having an open border policy is nuts and it will let Ebola into this country and
[55:58.880 --> 56:04.720]  cause more clusters thanks very much Alex thank you sir and still the borders
[56:04.720 --> 56:09.920]  wide open and the flights are coming in and they're doing the fake screening and
[56:09.920 --> 56:17.440]  this is a plan there's no no doubt they want a bullet spread in America and I'm
[56:17.440 --> 56:23.040]  sick of it and why do the why are the criminals that run the government hate
[56:23.040 --> 56:28.600]  me because I don't want to die I don't want my kids to die
[56:30.120 --> 56:35.960]  Reverend Bruce in New York thanks for calling go ahead God bless you Alex
[56:35.960 --> 56:44.480]  term thank you I pray for you all the time I'm from Long Island and my major
[56:44.480 --> 56:51.640]  concern first of all is when they did the the end when they broke into I was
[56:51.640 --> 56:56.280]  watching TV they broke in with this alert and Governor Como the mayor you
[56:56.280 --> 57:01.240]  know everyone was on the screen and talking and when they did the tour of
[57:01.240 --> 57:07.400]  the hospital Bellevue and talked about how secure it is and how we have all this
[57:07.400 --> 57:12.040]  elaborate equipment and all this quarantine and they showed the nurses
[57:12.040 --> 57:17.280]  the two nurses one male one female dressed up in their gob they showed it
[57:17.280 --> 57:22.120]  several times how protected they were they even showed how they are learning
[57:22.120 --> 57:26.000]  how to put it on and learning how they're taking it off and they glorifying
[57:26.000 --> 57:32.640]  this whole scenario of how we have it under control my major concern is this
[57:32.640 --> 57:40.160]  Africa is desperate those Ebola written countries are desperate when they see
[57:40.160 --> 57:45.440]  all of this on CNN okay about how wonderful it is in New York and how we
[57:45.440 --> 57:50.840]  have other hospitals in New York that are prepared to handle Ebola they are
[57:50.840 --> 57:54.840]  going to crash our borders they're going to crack not our borders they're going
[57:54.840 --> 58:00.400]  to crash Kennedy Airport LaGuardia they are gonna run that is an airport just
[58:00.400 --> 58:04.840]  like a seaport or a land area it is a airport it is our border you're right
[58:04.840 --> 58:08.480]  and that's what they want with Central and South America collapsing
[58:08.480 --> 58:12.960]  advertised come here it's free this is on purpose exactly but here's the here's
[58:12.960 --> 58:16.400]  the 64 trillion dollar question and I'll hold you over Reverend Bruce and I'll
[58:16.400 --> 58:21.040]  go to Patty and Brent everybody else why do they think they can get away with
[58:21.040 --> 58:27.160]  something this bold what do you think hey yo how do they think they'll get away

[59:11.560 --> 59:15.600]  harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients

[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:27.320]  Texas Alex Jones there's an old saying mama didn't raise no fool and again I'm
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.920]  no rocket scientist use another cliche but the old defaults put people on
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:35.360]  hospital ships or make himself quarantine and isolation after they
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:41.240]  treated a ball of patients in Africa or wherever the disease is and then you can
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.600]  come back what are these doctors doing coming back what are they doing
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:50.320]  people that have a bowl of back here and what's this guy doing remember 12
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:54.520]  monkeys where the guy that works in bio weapon research ends up going to
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:58.000]  infect everybody on purpose this guy came from an African country he has a
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.920]  fever he's a medical doctor and then he's going to bowling alleys he's going
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:10.520]  to restaurants subways and taxis I guess he's just incompetent to that's right
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:18.160]  Obama's incompetent bringing all these people in everything's fine everything's
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:24.520]  wonderful no it's not boys and girls number dr. Eric Pionk at UT send the
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:28.680]  head of the biology department he can't wait till the airborne Ebola comes this
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:32.080]  Ebola start to spread fast the army says it basically is airborne when it's
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:39.840]  cold weather and Obama says this is a dry run for a later deadlier airborne
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.760]  disease close quote let's go back to Reverend Bruce in New York then to Patty
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:48.120]  Brent and others go ahead Reverend what was your other point what I don't
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:53.160]  understand and I'm looking at the doctor and the other nurses that are running
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:57.440]  around knowing that they're working with Ebola I'm wondering that it starts to do
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.760]  something with the brain if you have a fiance in living fiance girlfriend that
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:06.720]  you're supposed to love you know you're leaving a country that you have
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:12.320]  directly treated Ebola patients why didn't you put your girlfriend on alert
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.600]  tell her leave the apartment go live with family and friends until I am
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:21.840]  quarantined for 21 days or more he let the girlfriend stay there he let the
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:27.560]  friends come by in 12 hours less than 12 hours he's on the train the trains in
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:34.120]  New York are crazy he was on the A line the L line the number one train system
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.040]  well you know what I'm getting at you're saying you think Ebola affected his
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:41.440]  brain I don't know I saw a movie called 12 monkeys I'm starting to think a
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.720]  little something else what you don't think they're going crazy I mean you're
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.240]  a doctor oh he's crazy I think I think it might have been crazy before the
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:54.360]  Ebola something is wrong why would you go on the train take the news report
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:58.200]  there's a eugenicist that says there's too many black people in Africa running
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:05.000]  the Ebola operation think something might be wrong there the news media made
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.080]  us believe in New York that you could take the train the next day it's not
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:15.520]  going to be any problem he had 103 temperatures few hours after he took that
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:21.080]  train to go to where we the bowling alley they told us on the news well we're
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:25.200]  going to take the train I take the I ride the A train and I'm going to still
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.120]  take the train well my daughter and I ride the A train one black man said
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:33.280]  newscaster and I'm gonna take me and my daughter on the train as well I think
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:38.160]  these people are crazy well in America acting like you're dumb and don't care
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:42.520]  and believe the government is the trendy thing to do oh boy I appreciate your
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:48.640]  call great points man I tell you my parents were planning a four-day trip to
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.400]  New York they like to go up there a few years see the museums eat in the
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:56.640]  restaurants a great city overall other than the socialists that run it I like
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:00.280]  New York I'll be honest with you think it's really interesting I don't like
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.680]  parts of it the garbage on the street and things and the rats running around
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:07.960]  but I'm gonna tell my parents I don't think they should be going to New York
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:12.520]  because it was one thing a few weeks ago to go to Dallas when we weren't sure
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:16.280]  they were trying to spread it but now we know now we know they're trying to
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:21.280]  spread it and as soon as it gets cold it goes airborne in fact that should be
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:24.880]  the headline Kit Daniels already wrote an article on Monday that got no
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.840]  attention that was so incredibly important in the army report saying that
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:34.360]  once it gets down to 45 degrees or lower it becomes airborne and no one cares
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:38.760]  maybe we should just republish it with a new headline a bowl to go airborne
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:44.200]  once temperature drops army I mean that's it that's it we're gonna come back
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:49.720]  I'm gonna get tossed plumbly on about 15 after we're gonna get Patty Brent Ray

[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:33.280]  Iran Conqueror hearings you name it Tosh Plum Lane joining us via video Skype
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:37.520]  is going to be with us coming up in about 10 minutes I'm gonna finish up with
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:46.600]  calls on the Ebola front we have this doctor Dr. Craig Spencer 33 part of
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:54.560]  doctors without borders and on CIA front over in Africa treating Ebola patients
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:58.720]  he comes back doesn't self quarantine gets sick and then goes to bowling
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:08.360]  alleys restaurants the packed a train subway and caps this is a medical
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:13.040]  doctor we have the NBC medical correspondent running around the
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:19.560]  restaurants but he's a hero folks really previously you would stay in the
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:24.040]  country between the Ebola patients for not 21 days for 30 self quarantining in
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:30.840]  a hotel room or house then you'd get on the plane and come back not now you the
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.880]  place of self quarantine because governor Cuomo and others say he's self
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:40.400]  quarantine is a New York rush hour train a bowling alley and a restaurant and an
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:46.160]  airport forgot that part two plus two does not equal 10,000 like they're
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:51.680]  saying this is getting crazy we have medical doctors on record and off record
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:54.680]  and the board of patrol saying they are secretly disappearing people with Ebola
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:04.760]  our story is top story on drugs report dot com we have it red linked a super
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:09.720]  article with all three of our articles on this together doctor feds
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:17.120]  disappearing suspected Ebola patients across US scientist Ebola can spread by
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:22.160]  air and cold weather bomb shell that needs 50 million readers not a couple
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:27.560]  hundred thousand we can go see who read it we need to get attention on this
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.680]  right now I'm gonna get Tosh Plumlee's take on this we're going to Benghazi
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:37.360]  Gary Webb who he of course talked to and who I knew as well and so much more
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:45.680]  and Tosh Plumlee has some intel I don't know he's gonna talk about it here today
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:52.400]  it's just incredible and so we'll let him do the talk and he'll be with us for
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.600]  the rest of the hour a little bit of the next if he wants to and then Dr. Francis
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:02.740]  Boyle who wrote the US biological weapons treaty is very famous in those
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:09.080]  ranks he says this is a bio weapon and South Africa produced it as a race
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:15.240]  specific bio weapon and made it airborne that was on the BBC in 1994 we
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.520]  aired the clip this week so understand folks this could be something big
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.200]  because they're doing everything they can to let it spread now I'm gonna move
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:26.280]  quickly through four or five your calls then go to break and back and come back
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:31.680]  with Tosh Plumlee let's go to Patty in Texas thanks for calling you're
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:36.760]  listening on 90.1 FM in Austin go ahead hi Alex thanks for taking my call thank
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:43.200]  you I wanted to put something out there about the borders and you're you're all
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.360]  over the place about why they're shutting down the borders and I think I
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:51.480]  have at least maybe a partial answer for you it has to do if you look at the
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:58.440]  when this lab started back in Sierra Leone with the Gates Foundation to Lane
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:04.320]  University and US Army Infectious Institute if you look closely at those
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:08.600]  individuals and who all is behind the money on that you can figure out why
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:13.320]  they're not why they're not shutting down the borders and the head of Southcom says
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:17.560]  that now they believe Ebola will come across the border how how is government
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:21.360]  not going to get in trouble burning down the house that's the big question why
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:26.840]  are they so arrogant now well because well I'll get to that I'll get to that
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:33.320]  because the last key on that that lab has to do with George Soros if you if you
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:38.000]  ask the question of why did they put that lab in Sierra Leone and the very
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.400]  first thing you have to come up with is they did the human trials because they're
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.800]  because they're dealing with very poor and disenfranchised people that have no
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:53.240]  voice that's not the final answer on it Alex the reason that they put that lab
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:13:00.280]  there has to do with oil the discovery of oil reserves offshore on all those
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:06.440]  countries around Sierra Leone and Liberia and Nigeria there's a huge oil
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:10.920]  reserve that was discovered many years ago but they did not announce the oil
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.840]  discovery and start drilling on it oh I know that that's exactly what McWayne
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:19.240]  Madsen formerly the NSA a major whistleblower said on Tuesday here you're
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:23.080]  absolutely right good to hear from you thank you Ray in New York you're on the
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:30.040]  year hopefully it's not too late is the comment that the gentleman who answered
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:34.640]  my congressman's office said to me yesterday and what he was referring to
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:38.960]  was a letter that he of my congressman my congressman Scott Garrett and
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:44.880]  another congressman David Bittner sent out to read and Bonner saying hey we
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:51.080]  have to we have to get Congress back together so we can discuss this Ebola
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:56.520]  thing he's having three out of four phone calls into the Washington office on a
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:00.840]  daily basis for the past three weeks talking about Ebola and the letter that
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.560]  they sent out and the comment that he made to me when he said hopefully it's
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:09.120]  not too late but it was referring to his he doesn't believe that they will
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:15.520]  convene again before the election and his comment after he said that was
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.160]  hopefully then it's not going to be it's not too late so that's a little what do
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:26.200]  you make of a medical doctor who's been in an Ebola area has a fever and then
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:31.800]  starts driving around on the busy a-train subway I mean that's that
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:37.560]  sounds insane to me unless you wanted to spread it I'm just wondering here
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:43.280]  because the media is saying he's such a hero why didn't he stay in Africa until
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:47.520]  he knew he didn't have Ebola I agree absolutely blows my mind and if you take
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:52.920]  a look if you take a look at the pictures of him you know you you were
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:57.240]  you were intimating that this possibly you know a little little concern about
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:02.400]  his ability and if you look at his pictures he does look a little different
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:09.080]  to put it mildly so he looks like another self-satisfied trendy no at all
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:14.240]  definitely definitely and I believe that again with the coming down of America
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:19.520]  you know it can't happen to me syndrome I can't have no Ebola I can go through
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:23.680]  well maybe that maybe he's just a super arrogant person my point is you're
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:27.240]  supposed to self-quarantine in the country after you've been with the patients
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:31.680]  in the super hot zone you move out to the edge of it wait at least 30 days not
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:36.520]  21 this is what they did in the before then you come back then use self-quarantine
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:41.320]  once you get here but he didn't do that instead he got a fever just like this
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:45.440]  nurse in Dallas calls the CDC and goes I've been treating the Ebola patient I've
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:53.160]  got a fever can I fly of course baby now are we really buying this no no we're
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:58.200]  not also don't forget we just had in New Jersey land in North Airport Tuesday a
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:01.680]  woman who was taken off the plane believing to have a bowl and scattered
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:06.480]  off to a particular hospital the hospital we don't know about but we believe
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:10.560]  it's university hospital because there's a lot of activity going around at the
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:13.920]  hospital at that time but what happened to her we haven't heard a thing about
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:17.080]  her since that's the thing we never hear about where these quarantine people go
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:20.120]  and now there did we have medical doctors telling us they're being disappeared
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:24.040]  and naming the hospitals and there's just zero coverage other than drudge
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:28.160]  report dot com and info wars dot com and I want to draw attention to this
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:34.360]  malfeasance what clearly is becoming you know deliberate criminal neglect so
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:38.360]  that they will put the things in place to stop it before it goes airborne when
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:42.440]  it gets cold and that's what the army says it does US Army Ebola goes
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:47.960]  airborne once temperature drops that's the headline everyone should get this
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:54.400]  article out to everyone they know info wars dot com thank you so much now what
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.240]  I'm going to do is finish up with three more calls go to break come back with
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:03.000]  tosh plumley who we do have on the line I really appreciate him joining us he's
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.800]  been getting some serious threats lately it's important for him to stay in the
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:10.240]  spotlight so he joins us with his maiden voyage on video Skype so it's like he's
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:13.280]  in the room literally we're going to him in just a few minutes real fast
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:18.480]  Brent in Texas you're on the air go ahead hey Alex real quick before I get
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:22.280]  background noise I just wanted to bring up a point that I think we have a lot
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:26.080]  of talk about containing this virus to the hospital but I'm actually worried
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:29.600]  about what is stopping a sympathizer from going to the hospital
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:33.560]  infecting themselves and then going out into the public it's obvious we're going
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:38.480]  to have a lot of sympathizers for the people with yeah you're gonna have a
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.280]  lot of fellow traveler Al Gore eugenicists I think there's too many
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.880]  people and you've got all these doctors and biologists that go to school and
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.960]  send us threatening letters saying we're gonna wipe all the humans out the FBI
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:53.400]  has gone investigated people I've talked about on air I mean Pionka and others
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:57.640]  but his his graduate students that are now bio weapons workers why would you
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:00.320]  give somebody a bio weapon job who talks about how they want to kill
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:05.640]  everybody see this is 12 monkeys folks I'm telling you I'm telling you it's a
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:10.080]  test run for that or maybe the real deal did your phone come back Brent and
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:16.360]  yes or did Alex one more quick point of I could I've seen one person die in my
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:21.040]  life up close and that I really believe it gave me post-traumatic stress it
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:25.680]  severely affected me and the doctor is saying death and math and I could see
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:29.160]  how that can make somebody sympathize with the people that they're watching
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:34.720]  dying seeing Americans view on this you know currently with them ignoring the
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:38.880]  situation that we're facing I could see how that could push a doctor over the
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:41.840]  edge it's a disaster I hear you I'm gonna get one more than we're going to
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:49.320]  plumbly let's go to Eddie in New York go ahead yes hi sir go ahead yes I'm
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:54.400]  here in New York just working a few blocks away from our bullet patient is
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:59.240]  that and I was thinking of giving the doctor maybe some credit you know maybe
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:03.680]  he decided to talk to somebody say oh should I self-quarantine myself and
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:08.440]  they said no go ahead fly so but then you were saying that our doctors without
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:13.360]  board is a CIA front so that went out the window well I mean I mean listen I
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:17.920]  don't he probably all I'm saying is why does other nurse fly are they creating a
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:22.080]  fake narrative is this even accurate is this even real is it a Ebola simulant
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:28.960]  like steel former CIA operative you know shed or agent shed last week here or he
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:31.920]  actually said it a month ago then he came back last week I don't know we're
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:36.040]  trying to figure it out it's just very suspicious and they lie and say that he
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:41.000]  did self-quarantine when he didn't the fixes in Tosh plumbly coming up they'll
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.240]  be with us about 15 minutes of the next hour so he gets a full hour and then
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:48.960]  we've got Dr. Francis Boyle to talk about Ebola he was already on a couple
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:52.960]  days ago I want him back on because he's such an expert on biological weapons
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:59.680]  that's all coming up today Tosh Plumbly on Benghazi and more straight ahead

[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:31.360]  viewers and radio listeners out there across the world again I'm your host
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:37.400]  Alex Jones William Robert Tosh Plumlee if I go over his whole bio it would take
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:43.440]  an hour but he's just a living legend really if you study this area of
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:49.160]  history the 1950s he worked as a contract pilot for the secret CA flights
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:55.440]  including some for William King Harvey Tracy Barnes and William Rip Robertson
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:00.000]  and flew arms directly to Fidel Castro when the US was backing him in Cuba
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.480]  prior to the overthrow of Batista he was never an official CIA employee after
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:10.000]  Castro the US turned against him Tosh flew arms to Castro's opponents and 62 he
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.680]  worked on Operation mongoose as both the pilot and undercover CIA covert action
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:18.920]  group operative he later worked as an undercover pilot in operation during a
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:23.120]  Ronald Reagan administration drug war flying arms Nicaraguan contras and
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:27.440]  cocaine back to the United States of course one of Gary Webb's sources he
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:32.440]  used in what was to become known as the Iran contra scandal Tosh flew arms to
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:38.120]  John Holes ranch in Costa Rica returning with loads of cocaine offloaded at US
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:43.280]  air bases in 77 Plumlee testified he did all this after he testified to Frank
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:46.920]  Church and his select committee on intelligence activities people ask
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:52.720]  well how could he do this and also on the Plumlee testified that their
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:56.560]  assignment was to stop the planned assassination of John F. Kennedy you can
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:00.720]  interview this guy for 50 hours we had a long segment coming up but this is a
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:05.680]  short one and he explains how he's still alive he's part of the white hat
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:11.120]  government and we could call come to the Pentagon affiliated CIA group and from
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:15.720]  my deep research and being a conduit through the years I'm not part of any
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:20.760]  agency never been trained by any agency any group I've had some family that was
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:27.040]  in the CIA and other groups but I have always had sources in the FBI secret
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:31.200]  service CIA I mean you hear kernels generals I've had former chairman
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:35.120]  joint chiefs staff on the point is is that the reason I'm alive the reason
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:38.920]  Tosh is alive and others is that there is a light side to all this the problem
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:42.040]  is the dark side is taking over and I'm not putting words in his mouth he said
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:45.680]  that before and I found that to be true now he first wants to respond to John
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:49.480]  McCain that attacked him in this short segment and we'll play the video next
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:55.480]  segment then we'll get into the latest on Iran contra the latest on Gary Webb
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:59.200]  in the new film kill a messenger kill the messenger and the latest on Benghazi
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:05.480]  that's really the big issue and his sources in NATO and in the military the
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:08.920]  Pentagon on what really happened there that's now been proven to be correct a
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:12.480]  year after he said all this on the show it's now come out about the stinger
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:16.120]  missiles you name it so Tosh I've done a three minute introduction you got three
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:23.760]  minutes to break what do you want to get into first well I don't know where to
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:27.800]  start I guess we'll start with McCone make them make let me make one statement
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:35.160]  about your Ebola and the doctor in my case cases when you fly into many many
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:39.000]  different countries and you're there for a short time so like that you start to
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:44.640]  build up us you're sensitized to believe that you're not going to come down with
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:49.040]  anything you're sometimes you're vaccinated sometimes you're not when you
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:54.680]  have hands-on hands-on day in day out 24 7 in a situation like that I've flown
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:59.680]  with some of the doctors on border border doctors and whether they're CIA or
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:03.960]  not I mean LCI is still traded everything out there good and bad but
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:08.760]  you'll see that they sort of get a attitude like well it's not going to
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:13.080]  happen to me you know I've been dealing with these people we went through this
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:20.520]  with the age crisis in Africa and then doctors especially began to think well
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:25.480]  I've been working this long with it so I'm not going to catch it otherwise I'm
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:30.920]  immune to it or whatever and that could be because of lack of education and I'm
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:34.600]  not knowing how serious this particular strain of Ebola is there's many
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:40.840]  different strains of Ebola now whether they're used as warfare or whatever I
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:45.280]  wouldn't I wouldn't know that I'm not picking up for the doctor I think he
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:51.280]  used bad judgment and going out and making contact but I said was probably
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:55.720]  more in good intentions because he honestly believed that he could not be
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:00.760]  infected probably a great guy in a hero just thought he was bulletproof well
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:06.680]  that's yeah that happens to all of us some of us that say that we think there
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:11.720]  are bulletproof we find out we're not regardless of what's out there by the
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:14.760]  way we're going to break and I'll give you the floor when we come back but talk
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:19.320]  about bulletproof you have been doing covert operations since the 50s and are
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:25.200]  still doing it amazing you've you've left a charmed life I think well the
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:28.960]  reason real fascinating going to break the reason for this is I put it out in
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:32.400]  the sunshine before the fact that we get into some of this stuff about web and
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:39.920]  so on I got my personal feelings along those lines it's it's not easy to know
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:43.640]  these things and then keep them suppressed exactly I know the feelings
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:47.800]  stay there William Robert Tosh Plutton Lee will give you his Facebook and more

[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:37.400]  dot com forward slash Robert Dot Plumlee and he's had a mess with the site block
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:41.640]  it he's been recently threatened I don't know how much he wants to say on air I
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:45.560]  hope he says it all because I don't even like knowing what he told me and they're
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:48.800]  not being able to say it I think he's probably gonna tell you what his latest
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:53.000]  information is because he's a pretty smart guy long before I was born he
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.480]  understood to get it out there and then you're not in as much danger plus you've
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:01.160]  done the right thing but William Robert Tosh Plumlee is our guest he wants to
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:06.360]  deal with John McCain first will play the clip when he calls for it sandwich him
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:11.360]  with Colonel Schaefer confirming what Plumlee has said and sandwiched in with
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:18.000]  another guest as well getting into what really happened with Ben Ghazi but
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.280]  but Plumlee's talked directly to a NATO officer and others we're just gonna leave
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:25.800]  it at that and it's all been confirmed what he's been saying the last few years
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:29.160]  now and so he's been threatened by the Justice Department you name it all right
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:33.440]  I'm gonna give you the floor sir go ahead and break down the whole McCain
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:38.480]  situation okay thanks a lot Alex for having me back on your show I do
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:42.740]  appreciate it however I was as you know a little bit reluctant to continue to go
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:48.640]  on interviews number one I do not do interviews mainstream media that's my
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:52.040]  personal feelings I do not trust them they've demonstrated to me in the past
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:55.960]  that they're more interested in my opinion more interested in spin
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:35:02.800]  entertainment and some of the editors have been infiltrated we'll leave it at
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:07.160]  that on that so I'll come on alt media I have more respect for alt media even
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:12.840]  though you have to be highly vetted in order to put stuff out on all media but
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:16.280]  anyway that's not the issue I've been called over the years to see how he's
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:21.480]  forced go because of what I've been involved with with in one form or
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:29.160]  another for good gosh in and out over 45 50 years or longer than that why do I
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:34.360]  still be engaged in things like this there's a thing called method and
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:38.880]  procedures and when they need people for the dark side if you want to call it
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:46.920]  that then they call upon people like not so much me now but young people younger
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:51.320]  than I am they call upon them to carry out special ops and those ops have been
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:56.040]  infiltrated by political influence over the years I saw that coming many many
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:00.880]  years ago I saw some of the operations that we were involved with it became
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:05.360]  illegal when I'm start flying cocaine back into this country to carry on an
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.720]  operation in violation of the Bowling Amendment I began to have a little bit
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:16.880]  of a conscience about that and so I started trying to put information out
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:21.240]  there before the fact not prove anything but just mainly to protect
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:25.720]  myself because I saw what was happening to other people our character
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:29.920]  assassination in some cases outright assassination when they didn't go along
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:33.360]  with the status quo and the infiltration that was starting in those
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:38.080]  early years back in the 50s through the 60s whether it be military industrial
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:42.240]  complex with BCI operations cogs or whatever you want to call them UC
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:46.640]  operations but those operations instead of becoming military intelligence
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:51.200]  operations and gathering intelligence for the welfare and protection of
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:56.000]  this country's national security to become migrated into special ops for
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.320]  political gain then we started getting incompetent people in strategic
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:05.920]  positions and intelligence community so anyway I don't know if that you know
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:10.160]  brings up a date on anything the reason that I decided to go in here and talk
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:16.000]  I was a person sent me a clip and Senator McCain and I was asked a question
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.840]  about stinger about missiles about weapons actually and the statement
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:27.520]  come back he made oh yeah plummet referencing me said pigs fly and the
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:33.760]  sun rises in the west okay I you know I understand the
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:39.640]  situation of that comment or whether what he's trying to say but tell me
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:44.960]  outright mr. McCain our challenger which the information that I had about
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:51.080]  missiles going to the wrong places came two years ago it was I think even
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:54.760]  talked about on your on your show Alex talked about here first with you yes
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:38:00.880]  yes right and and at that point I started getting a little heat politicians
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:04.880]  did not some people did not want to hear this it was not with the
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:08.880]  administration it was not the policy of the administration at that point in
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:15.080]  time they always see a force gun was talking again about things he knew
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:20.200]  absolutely nothing about well about a year later it was confirmed another
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:23.520]  thing that was confirmed around that time was the training bases that was
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:31.520]  inside and was also safe houses and Turkey and Jordan were US weapons and
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:35.640]  also Russian weapons were being stored in these safe houses and they were also
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:40.960]  have training sites at various places located in Syria Jordan and Turkey now
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:45.160]  where did that information come from that information didn't come from our
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:48.880]  intelligence it came from NATO intelligence and other sources including
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:55.640]  the French in these areas and being that they were heavily engaged in this and
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:39:00.440]  there was also a war getting ready to start in the Ukraine a friend of mine
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:04.760]  that had worked with me well I put this way I'd work with him in Mexico on
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:08.800]  task 47 out of Fort West Texas was transferred over there into drone
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:13.200]  school and then he contacted me again one day said you won't believe what's
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:18.360]  going on over here we're moving weapons they're coming in on C-130s we're
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:23.000]  building up a secret army over here and not the first thought wow man this is
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.560]  you know it's got to be vetted I mean you know I mean go out here and talk
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:34.320]  about it so like that so then I had another source separate source from
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:39.320]  military out of Pentagon and run that through him and he looked at me said
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:42.720]  where did you get the information and I said all I'm trying to do is vet the
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:48.360]  information and so then I thought well I better go out and vetted out public so
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:53.960]  then later alone a few other things come out with the Mexican situation or the
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:57.760]  release of Carl Quintero and the shorty Goosman thing and all that kind of
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:02.280]  stuff and then Fox News asked me to go on and I did go on camera with them and
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:06.320]  talked about that had nothing to do with Bengasi but even in that interview I
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:11.160]  mentioned Bengasi I mentioned the Stinger missiles and I even said the
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:17.120]  amount 400 missing now the reporter in the news clip he said 15,000 a reference
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:23.000]  Stinger missiles it was 15,000 hard impact weapons that was transferred over
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.360]  there within those 15,000 weapons hard hard core weapons if you want to call it
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:34.800]  that any tank any armored penetration any aircraft all that all that and tanks I
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:41.200]  mean high energy high energy high impact weapons and embedded within that
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:45.080]  15,000 on those shipments that were there a year and a half before all this
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:50.120]  started breaking was the Stinger missiles and then we found out that from
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:55.720]  the second source that worked with NATO out of the Pentagon that there had been
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:00.800]  a series of reports that Ambassador Stevens had sent back to proper channels
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:04.680]  and through the intelligence community the others and I want to get this
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:09.840]  straighter this was information from hard work and undercover boots on the
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:15.840]  ground intelligence operatives with the CIA and with other organizations that
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:20.440]  had gathered disinformation over a long period of time their responsibilities
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:25.120]  to pass this information up through proper channels which they did however
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:28.600]  the information that the intelligence community I'm talking about the US
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:33.520]  intelligence community and joint with the NATO forces they didn't want to hear
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:37.680]  that because it was contrary to the administration and then the president at
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:40.480]  that point had made a statement that these little were little old kids
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:45.000]  playing around with over there and that there was nothing to it and and down
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.120]  played it because it did not fit into the political structure at that
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:53.720]  particular time so therefore State Department said on it POTUS said on it
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:57.960]  and this whole administration said on it I wasn't going to push on this until
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:03.200]  McCain made his statement so now McCain made his statement and you can play
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:08.120]  anytime you want to he knew the people that those weapons were going to and
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:13.320]  they were good people that statement was made at the same time American tanks
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:17.360]  were pushing in on Baghdad and the same time there was people over there were
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:20.720]  cutting off people's heads and lining up the soldiers that happened to get
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:25.640]  captured and shooting them in mass graves okay no comment from this
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:30.240]  administration that's an intelligence failure right so blame it on the
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:34.400]  intelligence community others I'm not taking up the CIA and I'm not taking up
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:37.520]  for any organization I'm trying to put out the facts here the way that they
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:44.240]  came down the pike so I thought well what what what am I gonna do I mean this
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:48.920]  information is out there mainstream media cannot touch it will not touch it for
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:55.000]  whatever reasons because lose your career lose your job only people to talk
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:00.200]  about this stuff or retired people that's been through it so anyhow I don't
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:03.200]  want to eat up all your time just blabbering here but it's important to
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:06.320]  give all the background on this will play the McCain clip right here this is
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:10.160]  reporters about a week ago they sent us the video we premiered it it's up on
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:14.560]  info wars.com of radio listeners want to see it and it sandwiched in between two
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:19.400]  of our expert guests backing up what Plumlee has said one of a Madsen formally
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:23.320]  with the NSA and then of course Colonel Shaffer, Lieutenant Colonel Shaffer who
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:29.160]  was on just a few weeks ago hours after briefing Congress who was fully aware of
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:32.960]  everything that's going on right now let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:37.080]  Well first off there's a realization Alex you can probably figure all of our
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:41.520]  options for Syria are bad I mean I don't want to get the details of it get in
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:45.720]  trouble but there's people been fired over killing the truth of the White
[01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:51.360]  House saying look these are the options we have and they're all bad and by
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:54.800]  the way getting involved directly it's just going to make things worse you know
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:59.120]  so the whole idea of arming these folks and let's be honest here there's clear
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:03.720]  evidence in my judgment that the Libya consulate that was attacked on the 9-11
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:07.560]  anniversary was very much involved in moving obtaining surface air missiles
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:11.680]  and other arms to the Libyans and transferring it via the Turks to the rebels in
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:15.840]  Syria I just don't think it's in our interest to be doing that sort of thing
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:19.240]  based on the fact that you mentioned Alex the chances are pretty good it's all
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:23.120]  gonna come back and fight us some day how do we know that the arms that are
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:28.080]  going to the Syrian rebels are not gonna get into the hands of ISIS because if we
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:32.520]  had people who could were there to funnel it to the right people and I know
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:35.640]  these people and I know who they are and I know how to do it and so do other
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:39.360]  people it's this administration that doesn't want to do it that is sending
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:43.920]  them to certain death when they're training them and not preventing Bashar
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:48.400]  Assad from barrel bombing them it's disgraceful you have any more you have
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:52.760]  any comments about the arms deal from Benghazi getting into the hands of the Syrian
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:58.880]  office that didn't happen the 15,000 stinger missiles no it didn't happen it
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:02.520]  didn't happen it didn't happen why would you think such a thing somebody's really
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:09.680]  not informing you well talk about me top only of the CIA said that the 15,000
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:13.880]  stinger missiles got into the hands of the Syrian yes and he also had pig flies
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:20.280]  and pigs fly and and the Sun comes up in the West sure on on blackmail oh yes
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:24.560]  absolutely you mentioned McCain and what do they got on this guy I mean
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:29.440]  obviously he's blackmail three ways from Sunday they know he was singing like a
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:34.160]  canary to his North Vietnamese captors for six months he he was giving
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:42.000]  operational schedules for US flights attack flights into North Vietnam he
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:47.120]  also was responsible for the terrible fire on the US as far as stall that killed
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:53.840]  you know over 200 naval personnel and he was the first guy taken off because they
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:58.240]  knew he was responsible because of his hot shot antics they call him Johnny
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:06.000]  West start because he would flame his engine out as a form of hazing all right
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:12.960]  so sandwiched between those two experts we had the clip with the Nolan report
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:17.080]  where they brought up Tosh Plumlee and that's what McCain had to say to that
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:21.600]  please continue with your statements on and on that and then let's move into the
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:27.320]  latest on Benghazi the latest on Gary Webb CIA drug trafficking with Tosh
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:33.240]  Plumlee Tosh okay so after that statement I was gonna you know number one
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:37.200]  I've never had anything against McCain I'm not conspiracy or wherever he did
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:40.680]  this he did that so like that in fact at one time had a lot of respect for him
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:47.120]  but I saw after he got in and their colleagues that he worked with special
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:51.080]  interest took over whatever happened I lost a lot of respect for him that
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:55.320]  statement right there knowing that this information had already been vetted and
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:47:00.480]  was before the fact as much as a year and a half that those missiles and that
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:06.440]  hardware was being pilfered are given to the radical factions that eventually
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:12.560]  become ISA now they built an army within two years with our weapons and some of
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:17.480]  the Russian weapons they didn't overrun all these bases I have one question
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:21.200]  about overrunning the base anybody's ever served in a hot spot and the country
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:24.040]  knows that the first thing you do when you're overrun you get rid of all the
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:26.800]  paperwork and you damn well get rid of all the weapons if you've got to blow
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:31.560]  them up so that wasn't done it wasn't done by the Iraqis as they moved out and
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:36.080]  also the other part of those weapons over there that was being sent to the
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:39.480]  Middle East they were not monitored I was according to the direct commercial
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.760]  sales in the foreign energy report to make it legal in order to shift those
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:46.280]  weapons they're supposed to be monitored at all times to make sure that they do
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:51.280]  not get into the ISA hands right there is a violation and there is a failure
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:57.040]  right there point one the weakest link in the chain that's the failure we did
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:03.080]  not monitor those weapons now whether it was a conspiracy these two armists
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:07.800]  these were people I don't know I don't I don't get into conspiracies I'm trying
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:13.720]  to stay strictly on the fact was that the information came from NATO through our
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:19.240]  intelligence community passed up through proper channels that these weapons were
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:24.800]  getting in radical hands ambassador Stevens found out about this he had a
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:30.960]  contact that could buy back quote some of the stinger missiles he sent dispatches
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:36.160]  to Washington DC and I don't care what they say up there many dispatches he and
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:40.440]  others and even some NATO people and some people that was working with the
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:46.560]  French also confirm those reports to Washington DC to the US State Department
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:52.800]  and they sat on it and that actually told the operatives on
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:00.920]  Tosh, Tosh I don't want to have a conspiracy theory here hold on a second
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:05.080]  hold on a second one it didn't go in with your Skype cut out right when you got
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:09.400]  into the new information you've never gone this far your Skype cut out for
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:16.080]  about 20 seconds right when you got into the confirmation that this was
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:21.760]  happening and they sat on it your audio cut out please repeat okay this
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:25.200]  information from the intelligence community and the undercover operatives
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:29.600]  that work with NATO and other sources inside the Middle East that it put their
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:33.920]  lives on the line together that intelligence passed it through proper
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:41.440]  channels to Washington DC the current sitting administration and also to some
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:46.680]  of the senators that was not supposed to be monitoring what's going on that
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:51.840]  information was on more than one from multiple sources written and sent to the
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:56.440]  State Department complaining about what Ambassador Stevens had said that he had
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:00.920]  an opportunity through sources to buy back the stinger missiles or some of the
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:07.680]  stinger missiles so the administration came out and said the intelligence
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:12.240]  community's information was totally wrong you've had some people from the
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:16.760]  Pentagon this information came from the Pentagon this information was leaked by
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:21.960]  retirees that had worked the operation as much as four years ago they were
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:27.240]  concerned about the weapons being lost and getting in the wrong hands they are
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:33.520]  the very people that said that we they somebody was training people in Jordan
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:38.080]  and in Turkey that's why the Turks don't want to play with us too much
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:43.920]  because it's gonna expose this those documents those of those letters those
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:51.520]  asking what do we do the information on memos was sent to quote this

[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:53.680]  plumly two years ago began to talk about he came out and said I'm not like the
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:57.360]  others I'm not gonna be a coward I'm not gonna go along I've talked all these
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:03.280]  senior people NATO Pentagon you name it and they say it's these missiles well
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:07.880]  that's what Schaefer was saying right at the time and then they called him in and
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:10.380]  screamed at him and a bunch of stuff and told him don't go back on that show he
[01:55:10.380 --> 01:55:15.360]  still comes on he's the guy that ran the anti al Qaeda bin Laden unit well now
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:19.920]  it's all come out so they changed the name of al Qaeda ISIS to confuse

[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:39.360]  to me through the reporters that were talking to him and why he's pretty
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:44.320]  concerned for his life right now because obviously even knowing this
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:48.400]  information is not good for my health so I'm sure he's gonna talk about I'm not
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:54.160]  trying to push him to but if he's got a reason not to please tell me but it's

[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.520]  checked all these sources you've been doing flights you know as we speak you're
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:12.160]  talking to people it all comes out to be accurate McCain makes fun of you
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:15.400]  attacks you obviously the intelligence community knows the
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:18.840]  valkyrie get stingers are gonna shoot down airplanes that's gonna be a big
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:23.920]  issue they want to stop it not just to be good guys but so they don't get the
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:28.360]  blame and then why would the government why would Obama why would the state
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:31.480]  department think that this wouldn't blow back on them and they could just have
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:35.440]  Stevens killed and cover it up because they're incompetent and they have no
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:39.360]  idea what they're messing with and they have no idea how to run this war and
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:43.640]  they put people in strategic positions that are not qualified and therefore we
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:48.920]  have what they call intelligence failures what I'm saying it's not an
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:53.040]  intelligence failure it's a political failure at the highest levels we have no
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:58.040]  leadership we have no direction we have absolutely no plan now you mentioned
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:04.040]  about about the Pentagon some of my sources are friends of hell some of
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:08.040]  them with children of some of the people that I flew with way back when so I do
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:11.560]  have a little bit of a lineage of a contact but it's very important for me
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:16.400]  to make sure that I get my dots in the right places because character

[02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:35.440]  coming up huge whistleblower on so many fronts please continue where where you
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:39.600]  were getting to in the intelligence community in Benghazi okay now if you
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:42.960]  noticed back around the time we had a couple of generals that were getting
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:49.080]  ready to talk about this how the channels administration jumped in i think
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:53.320]  those guys are asked for early retirement a couple of people up there
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:58.360]  kernels and some birds and different ones are we're talking about this and was
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:03.000]  warned to shut shut up it could affect their careers some of them have
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:07.000]  actually retired and come out and now i've talked about what we're what we're
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:13.960]  talking about here so we have the Pentagon intelligence gathering getting up
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:19.360]  and being blocked and then the main thing was the letters that Stevenson
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:25.680]  wrote to the State Department basically asking what to do this is what we found
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:32.600]  this is what Iraqi intelligence is telling us is going on what do we do
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:37.280]  now that was the reason that I devised the 11 Benghazi questions which you
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:42.480]  posted over a year ago or about that a year ago on your program and one of
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:48.080]  those questions specifically stated will someday we be fighting our US weapons
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:55.920]  on some foreign battlefield simple yes or no to anyone sent it on both sides of
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:02:03.360]  the aisle they would answer simple yes or no the 11 questions were based upon the
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:09.440]  same documentation of senator Stevens a senator I'm sorry ambassador Stevens had
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:16.480]  written asking the State Department and others in the administration what to do
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:25.320]  that jeopardized the official position of this government and so therefore those
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:30.800]  documents had to be sanitized those documents had to be withheld because it
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:34.720]  would show an illegal operation of a gun-running situation and the weapons
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:40.680]  were not being monitored and allowed to get in to the wrong hands now if this
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:46.440]  was purpose or not I have no way of knowing the fact remains that US weapons
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:53.040]  and I'm talking about tanks humbies launchers missiles over six billion
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:57.760]  dollars and weapons just that I know about that I've been told from sources
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:03.000]  out of the Pentagon the reason that I was contacted by NATO is they don't know
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:07.040]  what to do mainstream media does not touch it because they've been infiltrated
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:10.680]  through the old what I call the old Mockingbird project and I know Alex you
[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:15.520]  know what I'm talking about we're infiltrating the CIA operatives and to
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:22.320]  the journalist and the worst is a political class that just absolutely
[02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:26.520]  are totally incompetent they'll just lie that's who they stick in there well
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:30.360]  that's right and then some of this when we get into where they say this is a
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:35.320]  conspiracy on the part of this administration and elements within
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:41.120]  sometimes I disagree with that what I see is total incompetence these people
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:44.480]  up there have demonstrated and I use that word over and over and over they've
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:50.760]  demonstrated to me that they're totally incompetent to even run this country
[02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:55.160]  because and you can that is shown by the people that they put in that are not
[02:03:55.160 --> 02:04:00.240]  qualified to put in the strategic positions and infiltrate infiltrate
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:04.640]  those people into the intelligence community and then they said and suck
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:10.400]  up the information if it's not in line with administrative policy so it's not
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:14.400]  an intelligence community failure it is a political failure that's right the
[02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:19.040]  political groups are in control and that's why they can just lie to people
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:23.760]  on so many fronts now is because we literally have political state-run
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:28.280]  media Tosh stay there we've got huge breaking news that just went live at

[02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:19.880]  you are listening to an info wars calm frontline report it's Alex Jones I was
[02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:28.160]  told about 18 years ago by an engineer who managed 10 local stations as the head
[02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:32.920]  engineer a couple engineers under him that he'd been brought into meetings with
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:38.280]  the Texas Association broadcasters in the FCC and they told him in the future
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:40.840]  we're gonna take over the phones the radio the TV we're gonna have things
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:46.320]  called smartphones we're gonna roll these out and he was the engineer
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:52.000]  representing the Texas Association of Broadcasters in the meeting name was
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:09:02.600]  Kevin Stone he's dead now and he gave me the documents it said not for
[02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:11.000]  distribution it was all FEMA I shot video of it I put it in a film and I
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:14.840]  won't get into the whole story because we've got Tosh Plumlee here but we
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:17.360]  always knew when they're getting ready to really drop the hammer this stuff's
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:21.320]  been in now for about 15 years completely that they would start using it
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:25.000]  and getting you accustomed to it forced video messages on your phone from the
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:32.040]  president forced video messages and on radio and TV nationwide viewers from
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:39.480]  Austin Texas to Atlanta Georgia to Detroit Michigan North Carolina you name
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:47.080]  it an emergency alert took over with text saying that during emergencies do
[02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:53.880]  not use your phones and it caused panic and warn them not to use their phones
[02:09:53.880 --> 02:10:01.240]  and amidst all the Ebola crisis that's how it prompted confusion given the
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:06.440]  highlight of tensions over Ebola that's what they're doing and my phone will
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:10.560]  now turn on it's really a computer will turn on and there'll be alerts from the
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:17.320]  president on it so I have to turn it off and put it in another room to sleep so
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:22.100]  it starts out with floods and things that sound reasonable and a missing old
[02:10:22.100 --> 02:10:26.120]  lady or whatever missing kidnapped kid and turns into this talk about operation
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:30.040]  mockingbird what Tosh Plumlee was getting at CIA government infiltration
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:34.680]  political infiltration where they just put me look at CNN or Fox or MSNBC or
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:40.640]  any of them half the people are former administration PR flax and then they
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:45.520]  legalize the CIA engaging in domestic propaganda this year I mean they could
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:52.160]  legalize murder still murder Tosh Plumlee I want you now in the time you've got
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:56.760]  to run over finishing up on Benghazi and then you wanted to get into kill the
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:11:00.240]  messenger Gary Webb you were one of his main sources you were Congress's source
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:03.680]  everything you talked about on that's been vetted and confirmed as a
[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:06.720]  testament to you doing the right thing and then continuing to do contractor
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:10.640]  work because there are a lot of good people in the system and as you pointed
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:15.200]  out most the good intel I get fighting the tyranny is from the army and I'm
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:19.040]  not lionizing the army but it was Fletcher Proudy at the army that exposed
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:24.200]  the JFK thing I know you were very intimately involved in those operations
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:28.120]  Bay of Pigs you name it not just on the aircraft but on the ground a lot of
[02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:31.560]  that's highly classified you say you're gonna break your silence in Dallas on
[02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:37.120]  the anniversary coming up but I think for your safety let's just spill as much
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:43.320]  guts here as possible including what you told me about Mexico and ISIS we just
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:46.120]  because I don't like knowing that the crew doesn't like knowing it can we
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:50.000]  please just get as much as you told us out there so they don't come kill us
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:56.680]  all well okay sometime back I'm on now yes sir okay sometime back there was
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:12:01.040]  information came you know go back to the Mexico thing with tax 47 out of Fort
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:05.960]  Bliss Texas with Bill Conroy and Arco News covered very this goes back to 2010
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:13.240]  of weapons going across the border that led into the fast and furious which they
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:18.680]  tried to blame on mom and pop drugstore or gun sales and the illegal stuff then
[02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:23.160]  later these weapons began to show up that could not be traced back to mom and
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:26.920]  pop gun stores but they came back to the direct commercial sales program which
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:30.800]  the disadministrations supposed to have been monitoring to make sure that those
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:34.400]  weapons did not get into the wrong hands however those particular weapons
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:41.320]  ended up in this Zeta's hands and other gangs that later came into cartels and
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:45.920]  then as a result of all that during that period of time over 80,000 people were
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:51.120]  killed inside Mexico mainstream media did not cover any of that our neighbor
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:56.440]  next door and their drug war and war was going on with the cartels down there
[02:12:56.440 --> 02:13:01.080]  did not cover that Bill Conroy and Arco News and also my friends at
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:07.000]  salenews.com they did cover it and then also OC Weekly up in who Nick wrote the
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:14.980]  book about kill the messenger I believe and which was eventually made into the
[02:13:14.980 --> 02:13:20.800]  movie must stop up to here and go into the Colonel Sabo killing Gary Webb
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:25.400]  received the map that I'd given to Senator Hart through his circuit
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:29.560]  advisor and Senator Hart before the monkey business there was a sabotage on
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:34.280]  that situation but at any rate the map had all the staging areas that had the
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:37.960]  aircraft ID numbers that had the routings that had the coded names and it
[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:42.800]  had the people involved which led into the Iran Contra the information started
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:47.440]  going out to the senator and 1983 he wrote a letter to the effect turned it
[02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:54.160]  over Senate Armed Service Committee quote they refused to investigate even when
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:59.600]  the weapons showed up in cartel hands laid out all over the plazas that had
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:04.040]  been the firefights in that region this administration and the other
[02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:08.200]  administration refused to acknowledge that there was any problems going on
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:13.720]  with the Zeta getting us made weapons okay so there's the Mexico deal and
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:18.280]  let's go over to the other side of the country at that point in time later
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:25.720]  weapons began to show up in Jordan in Turkey same MO same operation out of the
[02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:30.400]  direct commercial sales program I started trying to vet this stuff to make
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:35.440]  sure that I wasn't making any mistakes about the dollar amount follow the money
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:40.680]  where is it going cut out companies did it go back into campaign contributions I
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:46.520]  don't know I started working on that and then the wrath of God came down on me
[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:52.120]  through anonymous deals through character assassination ties you better shut up
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:57.160]  you're getting way off base here there's nothing to this you're a conspiracy
[02:14:57.160 --> 02:15:04.240]  freak why do you want to take pop shots at Obama he's a good man I don't know
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:09.160]  what they're planning up there but I do know that the incompetency is causing
[02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:14.600]  almost a damn conspiracy it's making me wonder are they really involved in this
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:19.040]  creating diversions that takes us away from what's really going on all right
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:23.440]  now I'll start talking like a conspirator all right so I have to vet the
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:27.560]  information origin I've told people not told them on your program don't believe
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:32.160]  anything I tell you don't believe anything you tell them get out and do it
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:35.880]  themselves do their own legwork all we can do all you can do is point to people
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:40.280]  where to go I agree specifically though there's now been intelligence reports
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:44.200]  come out and then finally the FBI denied it they admitted it two days ago show
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:50.200]  some of this is coming out we saw the shooter up in Ottawa a few days ago what
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:54.080]  I'm getting at here with you I guess yesterday what I'm getting or two days
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:16:00.440]  ago what I'm getting in here with you as we have reports on that too yeah your
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:04.640]  Scott cut out specifically what do you know about Islamist in Mexico and US
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:08.360]  training bases with them tell us what you know okay I went in on a program I
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:11.880]  think it was yours a Hackman and Hackman and then at that point in time the
[02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:15.840]  intelligence report that there was an infiltration coming across in the flux
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:19.320]  of the children and all that kind of stuff that they was they picked up I
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:23.400]  think was nine Somalis according to the border patrol and these are Somalis were
[02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:28.840]  filtered through Mexico up through the poorest border between places like
[02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:33.880]  Antelope Wells Columbus up on us and the war has segment which is a very
[02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:39.320]  desolate remote area of the desert Southwest at the three-foot fence down
[02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:45.400]  there so now was that happening okay they said that these things they were
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:51.080]  already staging in safe houses in Las Vegas Houston Texas Atlanta Georgia and
[02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:56.520]  they were infiltrating through poorest borders in McAllen and in those areas
[02:16:56.520 --> 02:17:01.760]  down south through lajitas and all again all this intelligence through the
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:06.960]  task force out of Fort Worth Texas went through proper channels the general
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:12.560]  the person that I'm talking about was transferred to drone school to train
[02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:17.000]  before he went over to Afghanistan he gets an Afghanistan says hey man same
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:20.760]  operations going on over here that was going on in Mexico I'm saying wait a
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:24.200]  minute you're saying that we're putting our guns and the Zettis hands to he says
[02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:31.880]  not direct you know what okay so anyway they asked me at one time this is 209
[02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:37.840]  210 would I come down there and so they could show me something so I went down
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:41.160]  and saw a warehouse and I saw the warehouse packed full aside right and I
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:44.800]  even tried to take pictures of it and put tracking devices on the vehicles
[02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:51.880]  which was all recorded by Norco news and Salem news mainstream media contacted
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:57.920]  me and said I was crazy that there was nothing good and that's why they could
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:01.720]  not use it and they had got that information from this administration so
[02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:05.120]  then someone tells me Mr. Plumlee be very careful because the administration
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:11.080]  is out to get you they're gonna subpoena you I said okay fine I'll honor that
[02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:15.280]  subpoena when someone else honors their subpoena or gets issue the subpoena and
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:20.080]  I will stand side-by-side with that person and raise my right hand and I
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:24.640]  will tell them that committee where this information come from if that person
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:30.720]  would do likewise now I could I walked out the name there but everybody knows
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:37.920]  who I'm talking about I don't like to throw names out there but so far I
[02:18:37.920 --> 02:18:43.040]  haven't heard anything from the subpoena but I did hear some other things that
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:46.520]  I'm upsetting some people because I'm going into methods and procedures and
[02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:51.160]  here's the problem their problem I'm not a government agent I'm not employed I
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:54.920]  don't take the US government treasury's money this information is coming to me
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:19:00.200]  there are people that are dedicated to saving this Constitution and they're
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:05.040]  seeing it gradually through a process of evolution being eroded and it's being
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:10.720]  eroded by incompetent people put in strategic positions that stops the
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:16.640]  actual flow of intelligence that is needed in order to save this country's
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:21.480]  now let's stop right there you told Nico and others specifically repeat what
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:26.480]  you told us about about not just radical Islamists is coming across the
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:31.760]  border but a training base in Mexico and did you that that's the reason I came
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:35.640]  down here well we're bringing it up to date information I got I'm still down
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:38.880]  here checking that out I was I haven't released I said that's what I'm coming
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:42.920]  down here for here's the here's the report there is a training to training
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:49.000]  basis one between out here in the desert southwest in Chihuahua which is
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:55.320]  directly between El Paso and Nogales that area right a little well it's very
[02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:58.920]  porous down there I'm trying to get in touch with the border patrol right now
[02:19:58.920 --> 02:20:02.800]  to find out if they've had any reports of that I do have a border patrol contact
[02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:06.920]  out of Santa Teresa and he told me there's truth to that however I can't go
[02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:12.200]  out public at this point and say I I'm trying to get pictures I'm trying to I'm
[02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:16.680]  fine to find out for sure I'm trying to get next to the Marinos down there that
[02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:22.040]  are stationed in Palamas across from Columbus New Mexico otherwise they did
[02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:29.720]  a raid on a ranch here back in 2010 and it's recorded and pictures of us shaking
[02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:33.040]  hands with the border patrol as the Mexican Marinos was raiding the ranch
[02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:38.440]  and they found weapons there US weapons now that was blocked out because quote
[02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:42.640]  national security let me say this Celica still it was a high-level DA agent
[02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:47.680]  Vietnam vet border patrol before that DA obviously you know who we're talking
[02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:52.720]  about yeah also a source for Gary Webb and others they set him up for just
[02:20:52.720 --> 02:20:56.280]  selling a few shotguns and stuff when he got divorced to raise money and put him
[02:20:56.280 --> 02:21:02.640]  in prison for a while he said on my show in 2003 in studio this video of it on
[02:21:02.640 --> 02:21:08.640]  YouTube that they were going to arm secret armies called Zettas down by the
[02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:12.800]  King Ranch and that he'd been asked to go train these secret armies they were
[02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:17.680]  going to claim that it was a infiltration and that the the the Mexican
[02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:20.920]  Army that was trained in the US had turned against the Mexican government
[02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:25.600]  and formed the Zettas but it wasn't true when he said that they came after him
[02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:31.120]  so now you're you don't get this wrong yours what I heard you were saying
[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:34.480]  because you were talking to producers it and correct me if I'm wrong is that
[02:21:34.480 --> 02:21:39.880]  there may be Islamists training bases that the West is protecting in Mexico
[02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:43.280]  we've seen that leaking out in the news that they supposedly have training camps
[02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:47.400]  that's what that's what the whole thing I'm down down here far on on this
[02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:52.040]  particular situation but you have to confirm that well wait man yes I can
[02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:56.560]  okay Sally was right on in fact I some of us boys helped support him while he
[02:21:56.560 --> 02:22:00.480]  was in prison because he got a wrong deal we're trying now to get his pension
[02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:05.360]  back from him because his his information has proved to be a hundred
[02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:11.160]  percent now I'm going to go real fast and speed up here Sally also was knows
[02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:15.760]  about hangar three because he ended up refueling one of our aircraft down there
[02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:18.840]  and that's how I know Sally and that goes back into higher-end country to the
[02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:23.320]  secret air base known as Santa Elena Costa Rica and known as Point West and
[02:22:23.320 --> 02:22:27.560]  Oliver Norse notebook so Sally has a long history in that sure what you just
[02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:32.200]  said is absolutely right they jumped on that man and they discredited his deal
[02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:37.560]  and robbed his pension and ruining now he had also passed some of the same
[02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:41.680]  information to Gary Webb now I'm going to get into the Gary Webb bill Gary Webb
[02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:47.480]  received copies of the Gary Hart map also there was a Marine Colonel that
[02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:52.880]  allegedly committed suicide but they say it was murder okay okay get into all
[02:22:52.880 --> 02:22:57.640]  that kind of stuff at one point Webb had that but Webb could not connect the
[02:22:57.640 --> 02:23:02.520]  dots Webb was a damn good reporter he could not connect the dots to where
[02:23:02.520 --> 02:23:07.840]  Sobo had direct contact that these drugs were coming in and being pilfered out of
[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:16.480]  El Toro to the black community in LA basically Ricky Ross I went to and talk
[02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:20.440]  to Maxine Waters and Ricky Ross attorney and I told him this the same night
[02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:25.720]  that Sally and Michael Rupart who was also recently committed suicide had
[02:23:25.720 --> 02:23:30.000]  challenged the CIA director douche at that particular point in time at the
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:34.360]  high school I went on six o'clock news that night said I didn't want to see a
[02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:39.200]  race ride started over this information the dots had not been connected at that
[02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:44.640]  particular time Webb did not use the Sobo story because he could not confirm it
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:52.960]  as being factual that did not upset me and it did not upset the other people
[02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:59.160]  fact we supported Webb the best that we could next goal turned around took part
[02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:03.640]  of the Sobo story current Marine Colonel James Sobo took his story and he did an
[02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:08.240]  article I run cocaine or cocaine airways did a couple articles on me about my
[02:24:08.240 --> 02:24:11.960]  knowledge about El Toro and flying C-130s into El Toro to be offloaded with
[02:24:11.960 --> 02:24:15.920]  drugs and then reloaded to China Lakes with weapons and going down to the
[02:24:15.920 --> 02:24:19.800]  contra that was also confirmed by Gary Webb and his security advisor Bill
[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:24.640]  Holden that's all record now that's all okay that goes to the Currie committee
[02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:28.400]  this was all testimony of the Currie committee and they classified my
[02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:34.240]  testimony and also classified what Sally had told them their investigators he
[02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:38.480]  did not go in front of committee because he was DEA that information was
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:44.680]  confirmed but yet they went after him on a weapons that he sold and in law
[02:24:44.680 --> 02:24:49.520]  enforcement we exchange they exchange weapons all the time that we sell she
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:53.120]  won't buy this one hell not got this one this is a good dust myth and 40 this is
[02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:57.400]  a nine this is a river you know oh yeah okay divorce I remember he was having
[02:24:57.400 --> 02:25:00.520]  money troubles on my show trying to sell books he went and tried to sell like 10
[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:04.320]  of his guns at a gun show in the divorce and then they came and grabbed him
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:09.080]  that's that's the way the ball goes otherwise Sally made a bad mistake now
[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:13.760]  look a hindsight so quarterback and yeah he knows it when he was in prison and I
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:17.840]  sent him money down there and helped him out and we talked about it I was and I
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:21.200]  told him I said Sally you got to get out there public and I went we enough on
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:28.280]  Sally but this ties into Webb Webb and also to Nick Skoll the the book the
[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:35.640]  article I run drugs for Uncle Sam was was was published in 1990 April of 1990
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:40.760]  before Colonel Sebo was killed and that map was recorded in that article that
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:45.680]  article through San Diego reader has now been made into a book not my book I
[02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:50.680]  don't have nothing to do with it also Gary Webb knew about all that because he
[02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:55.000]  was receiving information because he was working with on the Ricky Ross thing
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:59.920]  but he could not connect the dots to prove and two months before he died he
[02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:02.560]  called me and he said I'm ready to come on your show I want to put this stuff on
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:09.040]  the website I've connected the dots he called me and asked me what should he do
[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:14.560]  and I hadn't talked to him in six about six months and I said what what do you
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:22.120]  mean okay now now Nick I was I'm not saying okay I'm not saying I don't know
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:27.120]  Gary Webb thing here's my position on that yes he committed suicide but he was
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:30.760]  programmed through the Merca things and you can find you can verify this to the
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:34.680]  men who stared at goats that movie because on the back scene of that
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:39.280]  trailer the documentation is proving there from Merca Malkin Bird and all
[02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:43.480]  these kind of things or psychological warfare sublimination that can
[02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:48.280]  pressure pressure until they can subliminate and subliminate and make you
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:52.440]  do things to yourself that you normally wouldn't do now that's my position
[02:26:52.440 --> 02:26:55.360]  they may have grabbed him and programmed him and then had him do it because I
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:59.560]  think he was programmed a year before he did the act because he was gradually
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:05.080]  getting on to things that was best left unheard of okay Rupert same way and
[02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:10.960]  also Celica still and and I'll tell you some other people out there is a good
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:16.560]  people DEA Hector Borellis and Phil Jordan the El Paso intelligence okay
[02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:20.480]  they've got the whole story over the documentation was released to the
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:24.440]  committee which turned right around and classified a committee secret sensitive
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:29.960]  top secret and it's still classified today so here we are the people that was
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:33.920]  involved in these ops having to fight our own government to get our stories
[02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:40.240]  vetted and public in order to stop this money flow just going into campaign
[02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:44.840]  contributions through the sale of illegal arms international and that's still
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:49.880]  going on today in my opinion that's what I'm working on that's why I have to come
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:54.920]  out here and let you people know this is what I'm working on before the fact
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:28:00.320]  otherwise I'm gonna go to a federal prison and be shut up or I'm gonna have
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:03.800]  an accident like Hastings and some of these other people now okay that now
[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:07.440]  yeah they blow Hastings up I even talked to I even talked to his friends and
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:11.400]  family and he was running from the feds when they when they killed him well
[02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:15.160]  all right there you are I mean we're you've heard me say this and I've said
[02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:18.320]  it on your program there is another world out there that the eight to five
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:23.840]  American cannot even comprehend it exists and some of us guys play in that
[02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:29.840]  world I call it the sandbox and some of us don't play too smart and that's what
[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:36.600]  they want now okay back to the web deals so web about a guy I'm not sure of the
[02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:40.840]  day but a couple of months weeks maybe whatever what should I do then you got
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:46.360]  to go public I can't go public because I don't have the goods the dots aren't
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:52.240]  connecting okay what what can't what what can't what could I do it wasn't a
[02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:56.200]  question that they're gonna kill you it wasn't a question okay that came later
[02:28:56.200 --> 02:29:01.360]  otherwise his editors who I think some of them worked for the CIA or took some
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:04.800]  of the CIA money to discredit that man and well it actually came out that the
[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:09.640]  LA Times was with a CIA operative as its head the CIA declassified that two
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:12.840]  weeks ago Tosh here's what we got to do will you come back on just on the Gary

[02:33:20.200 --> 02:33:25.120]  professor Francis Anthony Boyle joining us he was already on two days ago but I
[02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:28.320]  was listening to the interview while I was taking care of things at home in the
[02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:31.880]  office that day working on some investigations and I thought man I got
[02:33:31.880 --> 02:33:35.520]  to have him back for a second interview there's so much to cover we're going to
[02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:41.360]  him in just a moment obviously there is a big concern out there and people are
[02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:46.360]  starting to panic over Ebola because the government has acted so ineptly and has
[02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:49.800]  left the border open let the flights come in this this medical doctor was
[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:54.040]  sick and going to bowling alleys and a trains that's the packed rush hour
[02:33:54.040 --> 02:33:59.840]  subways and the restaurants and cabs this is getting really bad it looks like
[02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:04.720]  a fake narrative to me that everybody that has it is healthcare workers but
[02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:07.560]  they're just picking fake people to say that they have it so they can put out
[02:34:07.560 --> 02:34:12.800]  their PR that may not be yet but we have medical doctors that we've talked to on
[02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:22.000]  record and off record listing the hospitals where openly they are
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:27.040]  disappearing people that have Ebola like symptoms so that's we're gonna follow
[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:31.040]  that over the weekend have some big news on that on Monday look for special

[02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:59.720]  because the rest the media is pretty much controlled to a great extent or
[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:06.080]  they're ignorant drudge report calm is linking to our article with top border
[02:35:06.080 --> 02:35:12.240]  patrol medical doctor by name who is under a lot of fire right now they're
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:15.360]  threatened to fire him on Monday he'll be back on with us he says he feels fine
[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:19.080]  that's fine he's had all these doctors all over the country call him and doctors
[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:22.560]  in his town that know him and doctors at the hospital called in thanking and
[02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:26.280]  said yes it's Ebola we think it was Ebola and you're right they're
[02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:30.720]  disappearing people but but then they're like don't say my name it's gonna come
[02:35:30.720 --> 02:35:36.000]  out okay but he's like hey if it's Ebola and they're covering it up fine fire me
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:40.520]  he manages several hospitals several medium-sized clinics he's not at the
[02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:44.080]  Truman Center that's a different company that's where he did his internship so
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:47.840]  that's going on we're gonna go to dr. Boyle here in a moment on the providence
[02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:53.160]  of Ebola because he did offer the US biological weapons tree that was adopted
[02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:59.600]  at the UN and he went through the big top globalist PhD program he only get
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:06.120]  one PhD a year out of at Harvard the Kissinger PhD which they only get to
[02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:09.480]  top people they want to make super gophers or or legates I would call
[02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:13.800]  them and so he's got the inside scoop on how they operate and how they work and
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:16.600]  he's been basically saying this things to I have and we'll talk to him in a
[02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:21.640]  moment quite frankly we had quite a stockpile of survival shield x2 and
[02:36:21.640 --> 02:36:26.520]  regular survival shield as I got tired of selling out of it but that stockpile
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:31.000]  is selling out we may get into a point where we don't even have it because a
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:34.120]  lot of folks you know what it does for your nebodies natural defenses and
[02:36:34.120 --> 02:36:39.920]  health and just overall wellness things done for me DNA force has the bio PQQ
[02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:44.840]  and the CoQ 10 the organic sources and a lot more nothing's a silver bullet not
[02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:49.160]  even our colloidal silver that's called silver bullet but you want to bolster
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:53.520]  your immune system obviously that's what I'm doing sunlight purified water rest
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:58.720]  staying away from areas like subways if this continues to break out I've been
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:02.320]  saying I hope it doesn't get big and doesn't and don't think it would but I
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:05.840]  just underestimate the fact that maybe they want a big crisis maybe they want
[02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:10.840]  to sell vaccine I don't know but if you want to get your survival shield x2 or
[02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:18.040]  the lung shield the lung cleanse that is a whole bunch dozens of essential oils
[02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:21.920]  and herbs concentrated it's not like other throat sprays they're real thin and
[02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:25.400]  just some mental this stuff is really thick so you got to clean out the spray
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:28.680]  nozzle after you use it a few times because it'll clog up I mean it's so
[02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:32.760]  thick and I put three shots in my mouth and then then I inhale a little bit
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:39.080]  that's what Dr. Group recommends again none of this is a silver bullet for
[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:42.280]  anything it's just super high quality supplements if you don't have item and
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:47.480]  see you get scurvy so you know eat your oranges all of that booster immune system
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:51.000]  garlic I had a whole bunch of garlic with my eggs this morning I don't care of
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:55.400]  you know folks don't like my breath that's what I'm doing info wars life
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:38:04.000]  calm or 888253 3139 and I would secure your survival shield x2 or original
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:09.880]  survival shield a nascent iodine today and again it's not like the the really
[02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:13.040]  horrible tasting stuff that will kill you they sell at the store that's for
[02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:16.720]  topical and it's not like the other stuff that's mixed with alcohol and
[02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:21.520]  binds with it our iodine turns electric purple blue on paper because it's pure
[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:26.880]  iodine from crystal source doesn't turn black on paper it's real nascent iodine
[02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:33.920]  the pure thing not some by-product derivative show again survival shield x2
[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:38.280]  info wars life calm and your purchase helps support the broadcast and the first
[02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:42.600]  amendment here all right professor Francis Anthony Boyle is a leading
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:45.720]  American expert in international law he was responsible for drafting the
[02:38:45.720 --> 02:38:50.440]  biological weapons anti-terrorism act of 89 the American implementing
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:54.400]  legislation for the 72 biological weapons convention he served on the
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:58.280]  board of doctors of amnesty international and represented at Bosnia
[02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:01.600]  Hershey convenient the world court he serves a legal advisor to president

[02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:16.000]  the University of Illinois champagne is the author and I'm not gonna go over all
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:23.200]  of his books these written dozens of them he holds a doctor of law magna cum

[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:40.400]  appreciate him being so available the last few days thank you for coming on
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:47.440]  what is your take on what's happening with Ebola sir well thank you for having
[02:39:47.440 --> 02:39:52.760]  me on Alex and just one point of clarification that biological weapons
[02:39:52.760 --> 02:40:00.720]  anti-terrorism act that I did draft is on the federal criminal code it was
[02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:07.760]  passed unanimously by legislation by both houses of Congress yes yes and signed
[02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:13.240]  in the law by president George Bush senior a conservative Republican so it's
[02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:19.840]  not as if I'm doing something here at the best of liberal Democrats I think as
[02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:30.680]  I said elsewhere what we're seeing there in West Africa is a result of the US
[02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:39.320]  biosafety level for laboratories the highest level we have one in Guinea one
[02:40:39.320 --> 02:40:45.760]  in Liberia and one in Sierra Leone and these labs do every type of hideous
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:52.360]  biological warfare work you could possibly imagine including DNA genetic
[02:40:52.360 --> 02:41:01.600]  engineering on just about every type of agent you can possibly imagine so it's
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:08.720]  my opinion that this is this is where it came from I'm trying to figure out you
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:14.160]  know precisely what type of agent we're dealing with today's New York Times has
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:24.560]  two variants one a what what looks like some type of hoof and mouth disease that
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:30.000]  was genetically engineered along with Ebola down at the University of Texas
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:34.440]  and Galveston and a second time this is in the New York Times today you can read
[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:38.480]  it that's right hidden in plain view I have the article right here just buried
[02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:44.920]  is this is a product of bio shield so our bio weapon is bouncing back on us I'm
[02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:51.720]  afraid this is blowback the the second unbelievable I know weapon in volunteer
[02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:58.600]  is the National Institutes of Health they've always been up to their nose and
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:03.840]  bio actually their eyeballs in biological warfare and the Center for
[02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:13.080]  Disease Control the second agent seems to be a genetically modified organism
[02:42:13.080 --> 02:42:22.680]  involving enhanced lethality Ebola together with the virus for the common
[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:28.400]  cold oh my god you put the two of them together now so I mean you're you're the
[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:31.720]  author of our biological weapons law you're a top expert in this you were
[02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:35.880]  accessed a lot of classified stuff when you did that work you're here telling us
[02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:40.720]  that you've looked at this it's hiding in plain view that that we know we have
[02:42:40.720 --> 02:42:43.720]  these secret bio weapons labs in Africa that's what the African scientists are
[02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:47.520]  saying the media has been attacking me for pointing out that South Africa admitted
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:51.680]  they developed this stuff that was the classified the mid 90s as you know with
[02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:59.720]  project coast and yeah I work with them too right that's well no yeah so so
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:04.600]  you're saying and your view as an expert you believe that this is a Western
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:08.120]  developed bio weapon crossed with a cult because the armies come out we have
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:11.800]  the report on info wars calm today and said they believe that it will transfer
[02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:17.840]  like a full influence the a in temperatures below 45 degrees and
[02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:24.480]  we'll go airborne this winter I think it's been manufactured to be airborne to
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:28.480]  some extent although for your viewers I want to make it clear I have never had
[02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:33.880]  access to any type of classified information I've never had a government
[02:43:33.880 --> 02:43:37.160]  security when you were in Congress working with them I'm because I read
[02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:40.920]  some of the filings on it just talked about I guess declassified info that
[02:43:40.920 --> 02:43:44.720]  you went over with them then that's right back in those days everything was in
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:50.720]  the public record but pursuant to freedom of information act requests where
[02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:54.720]  you could actually get something but these days you can't get anything and
[02:43:54.720 --> 02:43:59.960]  you just have to read the press and scientific literature very carefully to
[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:06.360]  find out what's going on yes concerning the influence of virus today the New
[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:10.320]  York Times I just sent you my comment on that says that they're going to be
[02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:16.920]  testing out three types of vaccines over there the two I mentioned and a third
[02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:24.320]  involving the flu and now you have to understand they call vaccines but
[02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:30.740]  this is simultaneously offensive defensive work first you develop the
[02:44:30.740 --> 02:44:36.640]  biological agent itself by means of genetic engineering in the case of
[02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:41.560]  Galveston it looks like a foot and mouth or something and Ebola enhanced
[02:44:41.560 --> 02:44:51.680]  Ebola and in the case of NIH and glass glass of Smith Klein it is this what I
[02:44:51.680 --> 02:45:00.360]  call co-bola the common cold together with the enhanced Ebola and by the way
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:04.760]  it's reported yesterday that in the BBC today
[02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:13.600]  Glaxo Smith Klein has been over in Guinea testing this stuff out and Guinea
[02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:20.000]  sorry in Mali Mali just came down with his first case of Ebola reported today
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:29.720]  so the third variant then appears to be some type of Ebola enhanced Ebola from
[02:45:29.720 --> 02:45:36.800]  what with with the flu so that had to be even more contagious than than the
[02:45:36.800 --> 02:45:40.800]  other two if that's what the New York Times says they're going to do this and
[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:47.280]  and we have to understand the weapon comes first and then the vaccine comes
[02:45:47.280 --> 02:45:55.080]  second so when they say they're testing out vaccines with GMO that also means
[02:45:55.080 --> 02:45:59.760]  they have the weapon and they very well could you be just using the weapon and
[02:45:59.760 --> 02:46:06.200]  withholding the vaccines the positive point here though Alex is this it's a
[02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:13.440]  fundamental rule of biological warfare that you do not launch a biological
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:20.160]  warfare attack on anyone unless you have already developed sure the vaccine by
[02:46:20.160 --> 02:46:25.160]  use of the same technology now if you read that story I sent you today from the
[02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:30.560]  New York Times which I analyzed carefully it appears that these vaccines
[02:46:30.560 --> 02:46:37.520]  have already been developed at Galveston yes National Institutes of Health and
[02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:45.520]  have have not been developed but produced but at a small scale the excuse
[02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:49.200]  why we couldn't jack it up because big pharma wouldn't come in here that's
[02:46:49.200 --> 02:46:55.400]  ridiculous we spent 79 billion dollars on this stuff since 9-11 and that's
[02:46:55.400 --> 02:46:59.680]  bio shield that's the bio shield program of all of everything all the bio
[02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:05.720]  warfare together from 9-11 till now we spent 79 billion dollars well Dr. Boyle
[02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:10.040]  that's what all my listeners have been saying the last month is again we're
[02:47:10.040 --> 02:47:14.600]  not biological weapons experts like you or but but we can look at it and say a
[02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:18.560]  bull has been around for 30 something years in the news magically they've got
[02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:22.280]  all these vaccines they say are gonna be ready just by the end of the year next
[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:28.000]  year that low and behold basically match what we see popping up in Africa and the
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:32.480]  Africans are saying listen there's been you in vaccination programs and other
[02:47:32.480 --> 02:47:36.720]  things that's where it's coming from they're running they know and and then
[02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:42.200]  it goes back to the boldness of the establishment why would Obama then and
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:46.160]  others let it spread everywhere around the US and lie about it and disappear
[02:47:46.160 --> 02:47:50.120]  people we now know that's going on we just under the severity then I guess
[02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:54.000]  it's to hold the panic till they're ready to roll it out and then poses
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:59.920]  saviors it just seems like such a bold move I'm really this is the most crazy
[02:47:59.920 --> 02:48:04.600]  thing I've ever broadcast on this is overwhelming me psychologically I don't
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:08.000]  know what to say dr. Boyle what do you think's happening yeah it fits the
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:14.320]  pattern of what happened on September 11 2001 with the anthrax attacks that we
[02:48:14.320 --> 02:48:19.760]  know those were US government agents involved that was super weapons grade
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:27.680]  anthrax manufactured at Fort Dietrich and Mattel Dugway proving ground and we
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:32.680]  know that the entire White House was on cipro prior to those attacks because they
[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:36.840]  knew the attacks were coming that's associated press right that's that's all
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:44.560]  over so my assessment of the situation is that Galveston and NIH already have
[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:51.800]  these vaccines along with the agents and I suspect our elite have already been
[02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:57.640]  administered these vaccines to protect them from the blowback which is
[02:48:57.640 --> 02:49:03.080]  undoubtedly coming if you look at the New York Times there they've been working
[02:49:03.080 --> 02:49:10.920]  on these vaccines since Ebola was first sent the WHO which by the way is does
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:17.840]  what the CDC tells them to do ordered Ebola in 1976 sent to port and down
[02:49:17.840 --> 02:49:21.960]  which is the British equivalent of our Fort Dietrich and that's where they got
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:27.160]  caught doing all the mingala experiments on the trips right and and the the
[02:49:27.160 --> 02:49:31.560]  that's their Fort Dietrich and it obviously was sent there for weapons
[02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:38.360]  purposes and then it was sent to CDC and CDC has always been up to its eyeballs
[02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:43.680]  in biological weapons I have an official a government document here
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:51.920]  establishing that CDC was doing bio warfare work for the Pentagon no later
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:58.960]  than 1988 and they had to have constructed the lab before that so CDC
[02:49:58.960 --> 02:50:07.880]  is in on this but they've had all those years from 1977 till now to develop the
[02:50:07.880 --> 02:50:13.600]  the Ebola as a bio weapon and a vaccine and now they magically have it we're
[02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:15.800]  gonna go to break I want to come back and ask you this question when you think
[02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:19.440]  about it we get to the money to I'll talk to that in a minute we'll talk about
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:23.840]  vaccines money Dr. Boyle's our guest author of the biological weapons law
[02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:28.400]  terrorism law and treaties and other things just simply amazing I mean I have
[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:32.200]  three children I'm so upset about this because here's that here's what I see
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:35.800]  that's what Dr. Bull talk about when we come back they wouldn't be doing
[02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:41.280]  something this dangerous this bold this crazy that makes them unpopular if it
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:46.440]  was it for some other bigger goal they may be going for broke this may be the
[02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:51.960]  big one that's why I'm so upset is the government is at the top is acting so
[02:50:51.960 --> 02:50:57.360]  crazy and I don't think it's an epitome like Dr. Boyle says it's pretty much
[02:50:57.360 --> 02:51:03.320]  stage deals questions what is it I will never forget the day my son Jeremy told

[02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:22.440]  found it fascinating other folks watch sitcoms I read history books at least
[02:54:22.440 --> 02:54:28.760]  when I had time I did and you end up getting mental illness in government
[02:54:28.760 --> 02:54:34.000]  corporations throughout history companies organizations it's kind of like a
[02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:38.920]  dark logic it's like a twisted economy people start cheating in war cheating in
[02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:42.960]  business then it becomes whole systems of fraud then you get inventiveness in
[02:54:42.960 --> 02:54:48.200]  corruption and plots and conspiracies and no matter how many of them get
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:54.880]  declassified or whistleblowers exposed the greed the evil just grows and we're
[02:54:54.880 --> 02:54:57.920]  entering that cycle right now so I'm kind of answering my question that I
[02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:03.680]  asked Boyle I want Dr. Boyle's take on this it's just this I see the actions
[02:55:03.680 --> 02:55:08.880]  of the ruling system worldwide and and it's very nero-esque it's very arrogant
[02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:13.360]  narcissistic mentally ill mental illness can destroy families it's destroyed
[02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:18.400]  friends of mine I've seen it destroy people in business people end up
[02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:22.000]  thinking they're Jesus or people end up thinking you're a space alien you know
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:26.080]  schizophrenic type stuff I've seen nervous breakdowns you name it but when
[02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:31.520]  you get it in government and incompetence mixed in with it and corrupt big
[02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:35.680]  pharma and a bunch of eugenics is saying there's too many black people and
[02:55:35.680 --> 02:55:41.360]  that's what this that's what the Zabolas are is a eugenicist when I first saw
[02:55:41.360 --> 02:55:46.480]  that I've heard of him oh yeah he runs all Al Gore stuff and then it's declassified
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:49.800]  all the things they've done to Africa with bio weapons and everything black
[02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:53.960]  people it's just open season on them but they went to everybody but they really
[02:55:53.960 --> 02:55:57.880]  like to go after black people that's the apple of their eye Dr. Boyle I'm really
[02:55:57.880 --> 02:56:00.400]  freaked out at this point I want you to get into money but it's obviously bigger
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:04.600]  than that but this is so bold I don't see him getting away with this the polls
[02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:08.720]  don't show it either and people's kids die from this folks are gonna know what
[02:56:08.720 --> 02:56:14.200]  did it has the elite gone completely insane at this point no I don't think so
[02:56:14.200 --> 02:56:19.640]  you mentioned Zara Ron Klain Obama Mrs. Obama all the rest and they all went
[02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:25.920]  to Harvard Law School every one of them they were after me this is the Harvard
[02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:32.760]  Law School mafia at work cast Sunstein you know of him David Barron who said
[02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:38.160]  Obama could murder Americans put him on the first circuit I could go down the
[02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:42.360]  entire list occasionally there's a Yale law or Harold Killer Co Mr. Drone
[02:56:42.360 --> 02:56:47.040]  occasionally there's a Yale law person Mrs. Clinton but this is Harvard Law
[02:56:47.040 --> 02:56:52.600]  mafia I went through the same program when I was there if you saw the movie
[02:56:52.600 --> 02:56:58.400]  the paper chase that's exactly what it's like and these people they are not
[02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:05.840]  incompetent they are very bright very intelligent very well I understand that
[02:57:05.840 --> 02:57:11.520]  but I'm saying let me finish my sure sure sure they are completely ruthless and
[02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:20.520]  unprincipled yes so sure we could say that Hitler and the Nazis were nuts but
[02:57:20.520 --> 02:57:26.660]  I don't think that gets us anywhere you know during the war the OSS did
[02:57:26.660 --> 02:57:31.920]  commission a psychological profile of Hitler by psychoanalysts that I've
[02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:36.600]  read trying to explain what motivated the man the mind of Adolf Hitler the
[02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:42.320]  secret wartime report that's correct so there I see no point in saying these
[02:57:42.320 --> 02:57:47.480]  people are nuts these people went through the same program that I went
[02:57:47.480 --> 02:57:51.440]  through and they've been trained to operate this way
[02:57:51.440 --> 02:57:57.520]  Zaraan claim Harvard Law School buddy Elena Kagan I can go down the whole list
[02:57:57.520 --> 02:58:05.200]  Larry Summers stole from Main Street to get to Wall Street Harvard president that
[02:58:05.200 --> 02:58:11.040]  that is who we are dealing with here so they are some of the smartest people in
[02:58:11.040 --> 02:58:14.520]  the country you know Harvard for these type of people pretty much as a
[02:58:14.520 --> 02:58:20.840]  meritocracy and they've been trained to be thoroughly ruthless and again I went
[02:58:20.840 --> 02:58:25.960]  through the same PhD program at Harvard that produced Kissinger and
[02:58:25.960 --> 02:58:30.400]  Brzezinski before me they gave me Kissinger's all the office no no we've
[02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:33.200]  got to have you on for a full hour sometime just on that stay there back
[02:58:33.200 --> 02:58:37.040]  in one minute I want to get into the money with Dr. Francis Boyle stay with
[02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:41.400]  us this is powerful information thank you for joining us and I'll be back this
[02:58:41.400 --> 02:58:48.040]  Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. with David Knight on the Sunday show visit GCNLive.com today

[02:59:51.080 --> 02:59:56.560]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:59:56.560 --> 03:00:12.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[03:00:12.760 --> 03:00:16.760]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCNLive
[03:00:16.760 --> 03:00:21.160]  sorry I interrupted you earlier I know this is really hardcore subject I know
[03:00:21.160 --> 03:00:26.400]  that they're scientifically cold-blooded and smart just to me it is a form of
[03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:30.960]  power-mad mental illness because just because you can be Machiavelli it doesn't
[03:00:30.960 --> 03:00:34.320]  mean you should be Machiavelli and I know why did they end up bringing you
[03:00:34.320 --> 03:00:38.200]  through that high-level program that so few go through and then you ended up
[03:00:38.200 --> 03:00:42.400]  not joining them I mean I think that's another example of how there are ways to
[03:00:42.400 --> 03:00:46.080]  turn this around I don't think they're invincible a I want to get your take on
[03:00:46.080 --> 03:00:50.040]  that and then be follow the money give us your take on that no they're not
[03:00:50.040 --> 03:00:54.040]  invincible but but they've been trained to think like Nazis and that's pretty
[03:00:54.040 --> 03:00:59.240]  much what we're dealing with these are neoconservatives go back to us rio
[03:00:59.240 --> 03:01:04.040]  Strauss I went there as an undergrad they trained me to be one of them too and
[03:01:04.040 --> 03:01:10.800]  his guard father was Carl Schmidt the leading Nazi jurisprudence of his day
[03:01:10.800 --> 03:01:16.360]  who justified every hideous atrocities the Nazis ever inflicted including
[03:01:16.360 --> 03:01:20.600]  against the Jews for our Jewish listeners out there as to the money
[03:01:20.600 --> 03:01:26.880]  yes these two bio weapons vaccines that I've mentioned have already been
[03:01:26.880 --> 03:01:32.920]  patented you can see in today's New York Times the Galveston weapon vaccine has
[03:01:32.920 --> 03:01:38.120]  been patented and it's already been reported that the National Institutes
[03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:45.320]  of Health CDC have a patent on the technology behind cold Bola so what
[03:01:45.320 --> 03:01:52.880]  we see here is as you said rolling this out then coming out with the two
[03:01:52.880 --> 03:01:57.840]  vaccines that they know work and making a killing off of this because they with
[03:01:57.840 --> 03:02:03.080]  patents they can charge whatever they want and to stay alive people are going
[03:02:03.080 --> 03:02:07.720]  to pay whatever they want and so what we're going to be seeing is the rich
[03:02:07.720 --> 03:02:13.480]  will will get either one of both of these drugs and poor people can't afford
[03:02:13.480 --> 03:02:18.920]  them will have to you know do the best they can I really don't want to say
[03:02:18.920 --> 03:02:22.920]  about that Alex well it's like Germany a few years ago it came out even in the
[03:02:22.920 --> 03:02:27.040]  BBC that they had quote clean vaccines so they'll run limited runs that are
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:31.480]  actually good vaccines who knows what will be in the other vaccine from the
[03:02:31.480 --> 03:02:35.560]  group that brought us the Ebola to begin with well I think I think that's what
[03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:39.440]  we've seen here that is I think if you read the New York Times today very
[03:02:39.440 --> 03:02:45.760]  carefully they have vaccines already that work for these two different types
[03:02:45.760 --> 03:02:52.360]  of a Bola weapons and my guess is that you know our leadership elite has
[03:02:52.360 --> 03:02:59.160]  probably been administered these things already the positive sign however is we
[03:02:59.160 --> 03:03:06.440]  need to get access to those two vaccines and there is a special procedure
[03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:13.000]  there in the WHO where you can and world trade rules you can break patents for
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:19.240]  public health and we need to get those vaccines immediately the real ones not
[03:03:19.240 --> 03:03:24.760]  not any fake ones and get them if my surmise is correct and this is my
[03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:31.800]  surmise get them into mass production immediately at reduced rate certainly for
[03:03:31.800 --> 03:03:37.560]  the people of West Africa because I don't I'm not sure how much time they have
[03:03:37.560 --> 03:03:42.200]  between you and me well well dr. Boyle we're also thankful for you folks can
[03:03:42.200 --> 03:03:45.840]  find all of your books on Amazon.com you've got destroying Libya and World
[03:03:45.840 --> 03:03:50.400]  Order the three decades US campaign to terminate the daffy revolution if folks
[03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:54.160]  want to read real information that's that's been very well vetted you they
[03:03:54.160 --> 03:03:59.160]  should get your books we've talked about this over the last decade you've been
[03:03:59.160 --> 03:04:03.400]  coming on or so we've never done it I should have you on not when it's breaking
[03:04:03.400 --> 03:04:08.160]  feverish news but for an hour sometime to talk about Harvard to talk about that
[03:04:08.160 --> 03:04:12.000]  PhD program the Kissinger Brzezinski program that you that's so fewer part
[03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:17.120]  of and to talk about the mindset because to know our enemy is important and
[03:04:17.120 --> 03:04:21.240]  that's the way I saw it I was a bull for the peace moment for 10 years at the
[03:04:21.240 --> 03:04:25.680]  University of Chicago with all the neocons that at Harvard for seven years
[03:04:25.680 --> 03:04:30.880]  with four degrees including two teachers to teach teaching two years at Harvard
[03:04:30.880 --> 03:04:34.440]  right that's exactly what I did did they get mad when you let them know that you
[03:04:34.440 --> 03:04:41.760]  weren't with them I don't think I'm very pleased I I think they would just as
[03:04:41.760 --> 03:04:46.160]  soon revoke my degrees if they could but they're sort of stuck with me yeah
[03:04:46.160 --> 03:04:49.440]  well we look forward to talking to you again very soon have a good weekend
