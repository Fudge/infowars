[00:00.000 --> 00:15.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Sunday, January 24th, the year 2021.
[00:15.780 --> 00:21.220]  This is the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones show.
[00:21.220 --> 00:28.160]  Owen Schreuer sitting in studio here for Alex, but he's going to be joining us coming
[00:28.160 --> 00:29.800]  up in the next segment.
[00:29.800 --> 00:33.600]  And he also has a couple of special reports that he's filed that we're going to air today
[00:33.600 --> 00:35.200]  on the show as well.
[00:35.200 --> 00:38.280]  And who knows, you can't drag the wild man away.
[00:38.280 --> 00:42.520]  So he'll probably even call in if I was guessing.
[00:42.520 --> 00:46.640]  And we're going to be covering all the latest news, playing special reports and hearing from
[00:46.640 --> 00:48.480]  Alex coming up.
[00:48.480 --> 00:53.720]  And then just so you're aware, Sunday Night Live, which follows the Sunday Night Alex
[00:53.720 --> 00:59.160]  Jones show for two hours, I'm going to be taking nothing but phone calls.
[00:59.160 --> 01:02.280]  So that's what's coming up first though.
[01:02.280 --> 01:07.440]  Alex Jones, you know, Elon Musk has moved to Austin, but then Elon Musk built a moon
[01:07.440 --> 01:12.120]  base and apparently Alex wanted to check it out.
[01:12.120 --> 01:16.800]  Oh, we go back to the moon soon.
[01:16.800 --> 01:17.800]  That's the goal.
[01:17.800 --> 01:18.800]  Yeah.
[01:18.800 --> 01:24.800]  I hope we should have a base on the moon, like a permanently occupied human base on
[01:24.800 --> 01:29.720]  the moon and send people to Mars, you know, and pull the city on Mars.
[01:29.720 --> 01:33.960]  That's what we should do.
[01:33.960 --> 01:59.520]  I'm here at Elon Musk's secret moon base on the dark side of the moon, moon base goblin.
[01:59.520 --> 02:02.840]  You can already see an atmosphere is here under the dome city.
[02:02.840 --> 02:06.880]  A hundred vessels have been made and soon tourists will come here from Earth and enjoy
[02:06.880 --> 02:08.800]  themselves in the dark side of the moon.
[02:08.800 --> 02:09.800]  It's simply amazing.
[02:09.800 --> 02:13.840]  Now, 100 years ago, that would sound insane, but that doesn't sound insane today.
[02:13.840 --> 02:18.680]  But 150 years ago to even say that you would have airplanes that could fly in the sky,
[02:18.680 --> 02:19.680]  that would sound insane.
[02:19.680 --> 02:24.200]  So it shows how the potential of humans to imagine and dream, really they show like
[02:24.200 --> 02:27.720]  Genesis says in the Bible that we're made in the little image of God, really able to
[02:27.720 --> 02:31.800]  manifest and build incredible things, but we have to have a society and a culture and
[02:31.800 --> 02:36.120]  a civilization that's complex enough to bring those materials together to make our dreams
[02:36.120 --> 02:37.120]  come true.
[02:37.120 --> 02:41.320]  But just look at this mountain skate here in Utah, where we are, myself and Rob doing
[02:41.320 --> 02:44.680]  this family and my family, and just how amazingly gorgeous this is.
[02:44.680 --> 02:49.200]  We're about to take a little sleigh ride through the hills at night.
[02:49.200 --> 02:53.760]  And all this infrastructure was built in the last 50 years for fun.
[02:53.760 --> 02:54.760]  For fun.
[02:54.760 --> 02:55.760]  This is Park City, Utah.
[02:55.760 --> 02:57.840]  It's all built on fun and family.
[02:57.840 --> 03:00.600]  The Klaus Schwab says if it's not essential, fun is not essential.
[03:00.600 --> 03:01.600]  You shouldn't have it.
[03:01.600 --> 03:03.600]  Bill Gates says, oh, fun should be not essential.
[03:03.600 --> 03:04.880]  All your money must go to us.
[03:04.880 --> 03:07.640]  You must live in 250 square foot coffin apartments.
[03:07.640 --> 03:09.440]  We're talking total control.
[03:09.440 --> 03:11.800]  So fun is what builds civilization.
[03:11.800 --> 03:13.800]  Fun and dreams and ideas.
[03:13.800 --> 03:14.960]  Anybody saying you shouldn't have fun?
[03:14.960 --> 03:18.000]  Bill Gates says, oh, we'll never go back to football games or baseball games.
[03:18.000 --> 03:19.600]  We'll never go back to outdoors.
[03:19.600 --> 03:21.280]  We just can't do that.
[03:21.280 --> 03:24.480]  That's because he wants to steal your dreams and wants to control everything.
[03:24.480 --> 03:26.000]  He wants to control the weather.
[03:26.000 --> 03:27.320]  He wants to control the geoengineering.
[03:27.320 --> 03:28.400]  He wants to control the vaccines.
[03:28.400 --> 03:29.600]  He wants to control your body.
[03:29.600 --> 03:33.680]  He has a lust like psychopaths have to rape and kill people, but he does it in a high-tech
[03:33.680 --> 03:35.320]  way where he gets away with it.
[03:35.320 --> 03:38.080]  So again, I'm Alex Jones, breaking this all down for you.
[03:38.080 --> 03:42.880]  This beautiful night and the snow coming down and just how really science fiction-esque
[03:42.880 --> 03:43.880]  it is.
[03:43.880 --> 03:44.880]  I mean, look at that big device right over there.
[03:44.880 --> 03:45.880]  Look at what that is.
[03:45.880 --> 03:49.240]  I mean, this is all looks like we're on another planet, but really this is just Earth and
[03:49.240 --> 03:52.960]  we're going out and opening it up and making it better, not worse.
[03:52.960 --> 03:54.520]  It's the globalist genetic engineering.
[03:54.520 --> 03:58.040]  It's the globalist manipulating all these things, but actually hurting the biosphere
[03:58.040 --> 03:59.820]  and the original system of the Earth.
[03:59.820 --> 04:03.800]  They want to have a monopoly over life where basic plants and animals came and reproduced
[04:03.800 --> 04:07.640]  without corporate authorization, a determinator seed system.
[04:07.640 --> 04:11.560]  And that's what they want humans to be like is a captured corporate creation they control.
[04:11.560 --> 04:12.760]  They don't want us to hope.
[04:12.760 --> 04:13.760]  They don't want us to dream.
[04:13.760 --> 04:17.880]  And they certainly don't want our dreams to grow freely without their control.
[04:17.880 --> 04:19.960]  They want to steal our dreams and harness them.
[04:19.960 --> 04:23.440]  That's what these statements are about because they're sociopaths and psychopaths and they
[04:23.440 --> 04:25.280]  don't have original dreams.
[04:25.280 --> 04:27.040]  They don't have that God spark.
[04:27.040 --> 04:28.440]  We're fighting hard.
[04:28.440 --> 04:29.440]  Humanity is winning.
[04:29.440 --> 04:32.560]  I want to salute all the listeners and viewers despite what's happened to Trump.
[04:32.560 --> 04:34.060]  This was coming.
[04:34.060 --> 04:35.320]  The enemy was going to strike back.
[04:35.320 --> 04:36.960]  We are in the fight and great things are happening.
[04:36.960 --> 04:40.040]  So, trusting God, move forward and never stop.
[04:40.040 --> 04:49.200]  And remember, if you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[04:49.200 --> 04:51.360]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we will be right back.
[04:51.360 --> 05:02.160]  Alex Jones from a moon base to the airwaves in 60 seconds.
[05:02.160 --> 05:03.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history.
[05:03.720 --> 05:05.560]  I've interviewed all the experts.
[05:05.560 --> 05:10.960]  I have looked at every facet of this and now only days until the inauguration of the Chai
[05:10.960 --> 05:13.640]  Com agent, it's all coming into place.
[05:13.640 --> 05:15.720]  That's how they change the subject from election fraud.
[05:15.720 --> 05:18.160]  It's how they change the subject from Hunter's laptop.
[05:18.160 --> 05:24.600]  That's how they change the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World Order.
[05:24.600 --> 05:30.000]  And now, use the already martial law in place for COVID-19, and that's what it is, to then
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.520]  be expanded and become political and become permanent.
[05:33.520 --> 05:35.320]  They train you to stay in your houses.
[05:35.320 --> 05:36.320]  They train you to be tracked.
[05:36.320 --> 05:40.120]  They train and do what you're told for nine, 10 months as training wheels, and now they
[05:40.120 --> 05:41.120]  launch the storm.
[05:41.120 --> 05:42.120]  The storm is here.
[05:42.120 --> 05:43.120]  It's a global storm.
[05:43.120 --> 05:47.120]  There's not going to be martial law for Trump.
[05:47.120 --> 05:49.720]  There's to be martial law for the globalist.
[05:49.720 --> 05:54.440]  They're trying to set you up, don't be involved in violence, expose the New World Order, and
[05:54.440 --> 05:56.760]  expose the takeover with information.
[05:56.760 --> 06:23.080]  That's how we beat these people with truth.
[06:27.160 --> 06:31.560]  I want to thank everybody for joining us on this live Sunday edition.
[06:31.560 --> 06:38.960]  We're now five days into Biden's installation as the 46th president, and he's doing everything
[06:38.960 --> 06:40.640]  he said he would do.
[06:40.640 --> 06:44.760]  He's keeping his promises to cut off U.S. energies, keeping his promises to destroy
[06:44.760 --> 06:49.640]  women's sports and common sense and science, and say that biological men can compete and
[06:49.640 --> 06:51.160]  dominate in every sport.
[06:51.160 --> 06:58.920]  This is truly an assault on science, an assault on reality, and from there, it just gets worse.
[06:58.920 --> 07:02.440]  He's announced that they're basically dissolving the borders, that they're not going to have
[07:02.440 --> 07:09.240]  any deportations anymore, and the giant U.N. funded invasion waves are on their way after
[07:09.240 --> 07:14.400]  a year of or close to a year of lockdown in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.
[07:14.400 --> 07:16.120]  This has all been pre-programmed.
[07:16.120 --> 07:17.120]  It's all been engineered.
[07:17.120 --> 07:18.920]  It is the great reset.
[07:18.920 --> 07:21.920]  I want to thank Owen Schreuer and the M4Words team for the great job they're doing.
[07:21.920 --> 07:25.880]  Owen's about to host the four hours you've tuned in to, not just the Sunday Alachium
[07:25.880 --> 07:31.080]  show, but his own broadcast, Sunday Live, where he tends to take two hours of calls.
[07:31.080 --> 07:35.800]  He'll probably take calls today, but I wanted to just speak a few minutes about the nature
[07:35.800 --> 07:37.040]  of what we're facing.
[07:37.040 --> 07:38.880]  We have become a fallen nation.
[07:38.880 --> 07:40.080]  The world has become fallen.
[07:40.080 --> 07:45.960]  We've gotten away from God, and so there are a lot of people willing to lie, cheat, and
[07:45.960 --> 07:48.320]  steal just to get ahead.
[07:48.320 --> 07:53.040]  And that is going to toxify the environment and bring down confidence and destroy civilization.
[07:53.040 --> 07:54.840]  And they know that.
[07:54.840 --> 08:01.280]  They have put that, unlike other dictators and other despots and other tyrants of history,
[08:01.280 --> 08:06.920]  into a scientific cosmology of globalism, whereas as they collapse society, consolidating
[08:06.920 --> 08:11.400]  power over it, becoming fabulously rich, and getting their own personal power to level
[08:11.400 --> 08:17.040]  of kings, they say that's part of saving the earth by getting rid of wasteful civilization
[08:17.040 --> 08:22.640]  and quote, then carrying out the depopulation to protect the planet, while again, they themselves
[08:22.640 --> 08:28.640]  are the ones when you study them that are geoengineering, that are genetic engineering, that say, oh,
[08:28.640 --> 08:29.640]  we don't care about the environment.
[08:29.640 --> 08:30.880]  We're about to be gods.
[08:30.880 --> 08:34.120]  We're about to have all this incredible technology.
[08:34.120 --> 08:35.480]  That's really what this is.
[08:35.480 --> 08:41.440]  These are mad scientists financed by multi-generational wealth that are truly demonically inspired
[08:41.440 --> 08:43.000]  who are playing God.
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.080]  And everything they do is about raping you with 5G, raping you with force inoculations,
[08:48.080 --> 08:52.320]  raping you with their brainwashing culture and their attack on children's minds, cutting
[08:52.320 --> 08:56.600]  off your energy, waging war against you, discriminating against you.
[08:56.600 --> 08:57.600]  That's what they're doing.
[08:57.600 --> 09:01.880]  They're taking away the prosperity that our forebears fought to develop and expand.
[09:01.880 --> 09:06.200]  Now, that is the paradox, though, that once you have a wealthy nation, you tend to become
[09:06.200 --> 09:11.680]  corrupt, decadent, and evil, and you fall, and the cycle starts back over again and again.
[09:11.680 --> 09:12.800]  But the globalists know that.
[09:12.800 --> 09:17.400]  They talk about that cycle and how they have harnessed it and how they are riding it and
[09:17.400 --> 09:21.080]  actually using that decadent cycle to have what they call the final revolution.
[09:21.080 --> 09:24.320]  So Owen Schroyer is going to be breaking down so much today, but the final thing I wanted
[09:24.320 --> 09:25.320]  to say is this.
[09:25.320 --> 09:31.120]  I don't want to show the press secretary for the new president, Biden, coming out and
[09:31.120 --> 09:36.320]  saying we're going to use the military, the police, the FBI to disrupt conservative networks
[09:36.320 --> 09:39.680]  and declaring all conservative media terrorists.
[09:39.680 --> 09:44.120]  That's outrageous, but you've got Acosta on CNN doing it, we'll be playing clips coming
[09:44.120 --> 09:49.320]  up with Stelter saying all conservative media is this evil network, why after the Capitol
[09:49.320 --> 09:55.000]  got stormed by a couple hundred people, things would ever be the same, where they're the
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.560]  ones that burned out all these cities.
[09:57.560 --> 09:58.800]  They know they're unpopular.
[09:58.800 --> 09:59.960]  They know they've been rejected.
[09:59.960 --> 10:01.680]  They know people are onto them.
[10:01.680 --> 10:06.880]  They were supposed to carry out this globalist takeover and not have opposition, but we did
[10:06.880 --> 10:07.880]  build the opposition.
[10:07.880 --> 10:12.480]  We went out together and Trump was just one part of that opposition, so understand as
[10:12.480 --> 10:17.200]  darkest things are going to get, they're making these massive authoritarian moves because
[10:17.200 --> 10:21.240]  they know they're failing and it's an act of desperation, but it's not going to be fun
[10:21.240 --> 10:22.640]  for people like myself.
[10:22.640 --> 10:27.680]  You can see it in the news, the attacks, the rig courts, all their plans and we were supposed
[10:27.680 --> 10:29.240]  to be off the air by now.
[10:29.240 --> 10:32.840]  We were already supposed to be removed, but thanks to you and your prayer and your financial
[10:32.840 --> 10:34.840]  support and your word of mouth, we're still here.
[10:34.840 --> 10:40.560]  So I just wanted to thank not just the crew, but all of you for your support.
[10:40.560 --> 10:46.680]  And there is, live at the end of the tunnel, we still have some due process, some basic
[10:46.680 --> 10:50.520]  understanding of common law and common sense, and if you look at what's happening in federal
[10:50.520 --> 10:56.280]  and state courts here in the U.S., what's happening in Europe, every day, a major German
[10:56.280 --> 11:02.640]  state court so that the lockdowns are unconstitutional and authoritarian and evil, that they had
[11:02.640 --> 11:07.520]  to stop also in Brussels.
[11:07.520 --> 11:13.840]  It came out where a major court said that you can't make people wear masks, plus it
[11:13.840 --> 11:16.920]  doesn't even protect them from disease.
[11:16.920 --> 11:23.240]  And so again, this is just constant, all the studies show that the masks don't protect
[11:23.240 --> 11:28.120]  you and the lockdowns are causing massive suicide and causing more death.
[11:28.120 --> 11:32.880]  And so we have to remember, the people that did this, the Davos group, the UN, Klaus Schwab,
[11:32.880 --> 11:38.040]  Bill Gates, Fauci, all of them engineered this whole plan in Operation Lockstep and of course
[11:38.040 --> 11:40.960]  Event 201 and others, and they're on record.
[11:40.960 --> 11:42.360]  So they should pay.
[11:42.360 --> 11:45.680]  They have the motive, they have the history, they make the money, they get the power off
[11:45.680 --> 11:48.520]  of it, and then they brag about it.
[11:48.520 --> 11:50.600]  And they're saying the lockdown's never in.
[11:50.600 --> 11:51.800]  They want a lockdown two and three.
[11:51.800 --> 11:55.320]  They're saying that forced inoculations won't even work, that you'll never be free, you'll
[11:55.320 --> 11:57.880]  never stop wearing masks, that you'll never shake hands again.
[11:57.880 --> 12:04.240]  And no amount of New York Times articles with Fauci headline, what it was like to work for
[12:04.240 --> 12:05.240]  Trump.
[12:05.240 --> 12:08.120]  I read the article this morning and he's just, oh, it's so terrible.
[12:08.120 --> 12:09.120]  It's so bad.
[12:09.120 --> 12:10.520]  It's so evil.
[12:10.520 --> 12:15.800]  You know, he, he wasn't based on science and there were these horrible conspiracy theories
[12:15.800 --> 12:19.000]  that I worked with Bill Gates that I was somehow involved.
[12:19.000 --> 12:26.680]  He's on record running the coronavirus, Chimera weaponized testing at that lab six years ago
[12:26.680 --> 12:30.160]  when they moved it there from Chapel Hill, North Carolina to Wuhan.
[12:30.160 --> 12:35.800]  He's on record pushing with John Hopkins and Bill Gates and UN this whole lockdown agenda.
[12:35.800 --> 12:40.280]  He's one of the main captains, one of the main leaders of it and he thinks we're so stupid
[12:40.280 --> 12:46.200]  or they censor people off the web that they can release this virus, attack it, the population
[12:46.200 --> 12:50.160]  with it, take all our rights away, shut down all the doctors that tell the truth about
[12:50.160 --> 12:56.160]  it and point out that it's not dangerous if you're not deficient and that most the deaths
[12:56.160 --> 12:57.840]  are from other things.
[12:57.840 --> 12:59.840]  But despite that, the public is waking up.
[12:59.840 --> 13:05.800]  So now we just have to start saying no, but it really is outrageous to see them now not
[13:05.800 --> 13:09.040]  just saying, oh, you can't criticize open borders.
[13:09.040 --> 13:10.880]  Oh, you can't criticize election fraud.
[13:10.880 --> 13:13.520]  Oh, you can't criticize the response to COVID-19.
[13:13.520 --> 13:20.960]  Oh, you can't criticize Joe Biden when all the Democrats do is criticize and riot and
[13:20.960 --> 13:24.320]  burn things and then turn around and act like we're a bunch of terrorists.
[13:24.320 --> 13:27.600]  But again, they think this intimidation is going to work with us.
[13:27.600 --> 13:30.760]  This is really going to get the American people to stand up again before and they are standing
[13:30.760 --> 13:31.760]  up like ever before.
[13:31.760 --> 13:36.960]  So we shall be praying and seeking God's face and thinking about what we should do to defeat
[13:36.960 --> 13:37.960]  these people.
[13:37.960 --> 13:41.520]  But the first big thing is recognizing they're non-Americans, they're globalists.
[13:41.520 --> 13:42.880]  They are the establishment.
[13:42.880 --> 13:47.960]  We are the resistance and that all the corporate media and all the leftists and all the Twitter
[13:47.960 --> 13:55.200]  Echo Spheres and Echo Chambers are there to gaslight people into going along with unnatural
[13:55.200 --> 14:00.200]  destructive things and we should reach out to those debilitated in these systems, those
[14:00.200 --> 14:04.480]  captured in these systems like a fly and a spider's web and let them know that, hey,
[14:04.480 --> 14:08.640]  you're captured worse than we are in this line, you're not part of the establishment,
[14:08.640 --> 14:09.640]  you're a slave.
[14:09.640 --> 14:13.760]  Just because you pretend to be part of this big takeover and you're part of the power
[14:13.760 --> 14:19.240]  structure while at the same time pretending to be the resistance, isn't going to keep
[14:19.240 --> 14:24.760]  you out of the laws of science and logic and God's system.
[14:24.760 --> 14:27.080]  And so that's what it comes down to.
[14:27.080 --> 14:30.040]  So again, all these articles are up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[14:30.040 --> 14:33.320]  The only way they get out, the only way that we're able to change the world is when you
[14:33.320 --> 14:38.560]  share them in your email, in your text message and now they're attacking the very web servers,
[14:38.560 --> 14:41.200]  they're attacking the very domain registers, they're all of the news trying to have us
[14:41.200 --> 14:45.680]  removed just like Parler, so when I say any one of these broadcasts could be our last,
[14:45.680 --> 14:50.840]  it's that series where you're all going to sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com
[14:50.840 --> 14:55.000]  forward slash newsletter so that no matter what happens, I can send you direct audio
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.680]  and videos of the show from our own servers while that's still last.
[14:59.680 --> 15:02.000]  But that's how dark these days are.
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.720]  Congress didn't stand up to the original censorship, so now it's going hitlerian, stylistic,
[15:06.720 --> 15:09.520]  I mean on a scale of one to ten, it's a nine.
[15:09.520 --> 15:11.360]  This is as bad as Communist China.
[15:11.360 --> 15:15.440]  All right, big tech of course is helping Communist China do all this so that makes sense, they're
[15:15.440 --> 15:16.920]  all in bed together.
[15:16.920 --> 15:21.040]  So that's why today, promote the local station you're listening to, today spread the word,
[15:21.040 --> 15:26.240]  today realize how vital you are in overturning this because if the enemy was strong, they
[15:26.240 --> 15:27.800]  wouldn't care if we were on air.
[15:27.800 --> 15:31.160]  They need to shut us down because they're weak, they just stole an election and now
[15:31.160 --> 15:34.800]  they want to shut the economy off to consolidate it, don't let them do it.
[15:34.800 --> 15:39.840]  All right, back to Owen Short on the live broadcast, right here on the InfoWars Network.
[15:39.840 --> 15:45.720]  All right, that's right ladies and gentlemen, remember InfoWarsStore.com, remember InfoWars,
[15:45.720 --> 15:52.440]  remember Band.video, remember Can'tCensorTruth.com, and remember to tell your friends and family,
[15:52.440 --> 15:53.880]  we're still on air.
[15:53.880 --> 15:56.600]  The latest news coming up after the short break.
[15:56.600 --> 16:03.960]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply, secure your own safe source of
[16:03.960 --> 16:04.960]  food supply sale.
[16:04.960 --> 16:08.680]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're going to
[16:08.680 --> 16:13.640]  find at InfoWarsStore.com, the subsection is prepared with Alex.com and it's all these
[16:13.640 --> 16:14.640]  globalists do this.
[16:14.640 --> 16:19.560]  And as they hoard the food and as they prepare, you need to understand that you need 25-year
[16:19.560 --> 16:23.880]  food supply in the last 25 years, one month, three months, six months, one year supplies
[16:23.880 --> 16:26.960]  and it's the highest quality you're going to find and it's just good to have that check
[16:26.960 --> 16:31.200]  box taken care of and you know you're getting good food at a very good price and you know
[16:31.200 --> 16:34.880]  that a small percentage of it because there's not much profit in this goes to us to fund
[16:34.880 --> 16:35.880]  our operation.
[16:35.880 --> 16:41.600]  So, prepare with Alex.com or InfoWarsStore.com, you can find the preparedness section there,
[16:41.600 --> 16:43.800]  water filtration, air filtration, it's all there.
[16:43.800 --> 16:46.680]  The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the force to you know and more.
[16:46.680 --> 16:48.080]  It's time to start getting prepared.
[16:48.080 --> 16:51.680]  It starts with self-defense, it starts with being prepared, it starts with horrible food,
[16:51.680 --> 16:58.280]  it starts with digging in with a long, globalist fight, you'll win in the end.
[16:58.280 --> 17:03.320]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[17:03.320 --> 17:06.960]  is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[17:06.960 --> 17:11.040]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though
[17:11.040 --> 17:15.680]  it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and
[17:15.680 --> 17:17.240]  euphoric effects.
[17:17.240 --> 17:22.960]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[17:22.960 --> 17:27.280]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[17:27.280 --> 17:32.000]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[17:32.000 --> 17:33.280]  loosen up a little.
[17:33.280 --> 17:38.120]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[17:38.120 --> 17:44.120]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other
[17:44.120 --> 17:50.840]  herbs including but not limited to German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap and Balarian root.
[17:50.840 --> 17:56.560]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWars
[17:56.560 --> 17:57.560] Store.com.
[17:57.560 --> 18:02.280]  This is Greg Ries from InfoWars.com.
[18:02.280 --> 18:06.440]  I have many reasons to be grateful for working at InfoWars.
[18:06.440 --> 18:11.240]  One of them is that we support ourselves with great products that promote physical health
[18:11.240 --> 18:13.240]  and vitality.
[18:13.240 --> 18:19.400]  I've been using health supplements for years, and I have found our products at InfoWarsStore.com
[18:19.400 --> 18:24.600]  to be the best, especially our vitamin mineral fusion.
[18:24.600 --> 18:29.680]  Before trying vitamin mineral fusion, I always questioned if vitamin supplements ever actually
[18:29.680 --> 18:30.680]  did anything.
[18:30.680 --> 18:34.600]  I never felt much of an effect from other products.
[18:34.600 --> 18:39.440]  But I felt vitamin mineral fusion the first time I took it, immediately.
[18:39.440 --> 18:41.480]  I love how it dissolves in water.
[18:41.480 --> 18:43.400]  I take it every day with my supper.
[18:43.400 --> 18:46.040]  It tastes great, feels great.
[18:46.040 --> 18:48.800]  And right now, it's 50% off.
[18:48.800 --> 18:55.680]  It sells out fast, so stock up now at 50% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[18:55.680 --> 19:22.880]  Vitamin mineral fusion at InfoWarsStore.com.
[19:22.880 --> 19:30.480]  That's why every month, we launch a new URL before they ban it, but Soros and Bill Gates
[19:30.480 --> 19:32.760]  and the Globlists are on our tail.
[19:32.760 --> 19:39.360]  But the new website is theresistance.video, theresistance.video.
[19:39.360 --> 19:43.760]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[19:43.760 --> 19:49.000]  So the new URL that links right to banned.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[19:49.000 --> 19:54.120]  and all of the special reports and all of the suppressed information is at theresistance.video.
[19:54.120 --> 20:01.400]  Share the link, theresistance.video, theresistance.video.
[20:01.400 --> 20:22.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:22.880 --> 20:27.440]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[20:27.440 --> 20:29.480]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:29.480 --> 20:34.000]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[20:34.000 --> 20:47.200]  Well, Joe Biden is exactly who we thought he was.
[20:47.200 --> 20:52.000]  His policies are doing exactly what we thought they'd do.
[20:52.000 --> 20:59.200]  And now there's buyer's remorse on the liberal left, so much so in fact, there's now entire
[20:59.200 --> 21:06.960]  websites and accounts dedicated to the liberal Democrat buyer's remorse for everything that
[21:06.960 --> 21:12.640]  Joe Biden has done, including from the unions, and it's now being reported that you have
[21:12.640 --> 21:22.120]  all the different unions that Joe Biden campaigned to saying he'd be their president.
[21:22.120 --> 21:28.520]  All the different unions are now calling into the Biden White House saying, what have you
[21:28.520 --> 21:29.520]  done?
[21:29.520 --> 21:31.720]  You've cost us 11,000 jobs here.
[21:31.720 --> 21:33.960]  You've cost us 70,000 jobs here.
[21:33.960 --> 21:36.160]  You've cost us 8,000 jobs here.
[21:36.160 --> 21:38.040]  You said that we could have these jobs.
[21:38.040 --> 21:39.760]  What have you done?
[21:39.760 --> 21:42.000]  Well, he lied.
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.800]  He's a liar.
[21:44.800 --> 21:46.160]  But he didn't lie.
[21:46.160 --> 21:50.240]  He lied to their faces, but he was honest about what he was going to do.
[21:50.240 --> 21:55.280]  They just didn't know it.
[21:55.280 --> 22:01.720]  He said he would ban fracking, Harris is anti-American energy, Biden is pro-China.
[22:01.720 --> 22:10.560]  So it's a pretty easy formula to figure what's going to happen there at the conclusion.
[22:10.560 --> 22:13.280]  So it didn't take long.
[22:13.280 --> 22:17.840]  We're going to highlight a few of these examples, though.
[22:17.840 --> 22:21.800]  But ladies and gentlemen, before I get into the rest of the news, and we hear again from
[22:21.800 --> 22:26.120]  Alex coming up, and then I'm going to be taking your phone calls for two straight hours
[22:26.120 --> 22:27.320]  on Sunday Night Live.
[22:27.320 --> 22:29.280]  We may even open up the phone lines before that.
[22:29.280 --> 22:33.960]  Do a record number of phone calls in one day here at Infowars.
[22:33.960 --> 22:36.200]  InfowarsStore.com is how we make everything here possible.
[22:36.200 --> 22:44.160]  Now they have a, let's call it a wheel of death that they have, and they spin that wheel,
[22:44.160 --> 22:47.560]  and whatever it lands on, that's the attack they decide to launch on Infowars that day
[22:47.560 --> 22:50.080]  to try to shut us down.
[22:50.080 --> 22:57.320]  But thanks to your prayers and your financial support at InfowarsStore.com and your marketing
[22:57.320 --> 23:00.760]  support by telling your friends and family and sharing those links, because we're banned
[23:00.760 --> 23:06.560]  from doing so, banned on all social media platforms, banned before even Trump.
[23:06.560 --> 23:08.720]  But thanks to all your support, we're still here.
[23:08.720 --> 23:11.160]  Every day we're on air is a bonus.
[23:11.160 --> 23:13.040]  Every day we're on air is a blessing.
[23:13.040 --> 23:16.360]  Every day we're on air is a day that they did not expect us to be on air.
[23:16.360 --> 23:19.960]  Do not take that for granted.
[23:19.960 --> 23:25.400]  And if you like the great supplements at InfowarsStore.com, like I do, don't take those for granted
[23:25.400 --> 23:26.640]  either.
[23:26.640 --> 23:33.720]  The SuperMail Vitality, the TurboForce, the Pure Tumeric, the Winter Sun Plus, the Bodies,
[23:33.720 --> 23:41.880]  the Vezo Beat Complete, and much more all on sale right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[23:41.880 --> 23:43.400]  Big discounts as well.
[23:43.400 --> 23:50.320]  We still have the Energize Pack, 40% off SuperMail Vitality, TurboForce, and Ultra12.
[23:50.320 --> 23:56.760]  We still have the Revitalize Pack, 40% off Bodies, Vezo Beat, and Knockout.
[23:56.760 --> 24:04.000]  And then if you want to combine the two, it's the Energize and Revitalize Pack, 60% off all
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.320]  of those previously mentioned supplements.
[24:06.320 --> 24:11.360]  And of course, the emergency food supplies, the air filters, the water filters, InfowarsStore.com.
[24:11.360 --> 24:17.160]  Your support there is the financial miracle that keeps us on air.
[24:17.160 --> 24:20.960]  Do not take it for granted, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:20.960 --> 24:23.120]  Okay.
[24:23.120 --> 24:33.440]  It's amazing what the media has done to normal human activity or patriotic activity.
[24:33.440 --> 24:40.920]  And of course, you see CNN and other Democrats calling for the total removal of any pro-Trump
[24:40.920 --> 24:49.200]  media, any conservative media, patriot media, American First Media, they want it all gone.
[24:49.200 --> 24:51.840]  They work for the Communist Chinese.
[24:51.840 --> 24:56.560]  They work for the one world medical tyranny government so they can't have us on air as
[24:56.560 --> 24:57.560]  an obstacle.
[24:57.560 --> 25:02.880]  It's like freedom is an obstacle to tyranny.
[25:02.880 --> 25:09.160]  Humans exhibiting freedom, exercising their freedom, is the ultimate obstacle to tyranny.
[25:09.160 --> 25:11.080]  So we're an obstacle to them.
[25:11.080 --> 25:12.720]  You're an obstacle to them.
[25:12.720 --> 25:15.360]  You want to be a free American.
[25:15.360 --> 25:17.040]  We want free speech.
[25:17.040 --> 25:19.160]  We're obstacles to the new world order.
[25:19.160 --> 25:24.680]  But see what they've done now to demonize normal American behavior, non-criminal behavior,
[25:24.680 --> 25:29.220]  making it criminal, but in a social construct way so that they can do that first and then
[25:29.220 --> 25:31.720]  bring it in and say, oh, we have to take your guns.
[25:31.720 --> 25:34.640]  We have to take these people off the Internet, which is of course what we're seeing.
[25:34.640 --> 25:42.040]  And so one of the individuals that was in the Capitol turns out with his mother.
[25:42.040 --> 25:46.720]  So his mother must be at least 60 years old because he looks like he's at least 50.
[25:46.720 --> 25:48.280]  I'm not trying to be insulting here.
[25:48.280 --> 25:50.360]  I'm just telling you.
[25:50.360 --> 25:53.640]  It's the guy known as zip tie guy.
[25:53.640 --> 25:57.120]  So you may remember there was a guy in there with zip ties, a bunch of photos went viral.
[25:57.120 --> 25:58.920]  Well, he gets investigated.
[25:58.920 --> 25:59.920]  He gets arrested.
[25:59.920 --> 26:03.360]  Then he has an FBI raid on his house.
[26:03.360 --> 26:10.840]  And so they find all of these guns and some body armor and hats and so, I mean, they literally
[26:10.840 --> 26:14.360]  have a hat with an American flag and a rifle on it.
[26:14.360 --> 26:19.080]  It's a black rifle, a coffee company hat, a free plug for them, I guess.
[26:19.080 --> 26:20.080]  It's good people.
[26:20.080 --> 26:25.080]  We know the owners are coffees better, but that's just the science.
[26:25.080 --> 26:27.800]  Anyway, back to being serious though.
[26:27.800 --> 26:32.080]  So it's a piece of evidence, a hat with an American flag on it is a piece of evidence.
[26:32.080 --> 26:36.760]  Oh my gosh, his hat has a flag and a gun on it.
[26:36.760 --> 26:38.000]  Submit that to evidence.
[26:38.000 --> 26:39.840]  He's a bad man.
[26:39.840 --> 26:41.960]  He's a criminal.
[26:41.960 --> 26:46.960]  This guy likes American flags and guns on his hat.
[26:46.960 --> 26:51.280]  We'll mark that as evidence, that's right.
[26:51.280 --> 26:55.200]  So there's the evidence of a hat.
[26:55.200 --> 26:56.200]  Look at that.
[26:56.200 --> 26:57.200]  They caught him.
[26:57.200 --> 27:01.280]  But see, these pictures go viral, they get reported in the media.
[27:01.280 --> 27:03.440]  The important one is the one with the guns.
[27:03.440 --> 27:04.440]  So go back to the one with the guns.
[27:04.440 --> 27:11.920]  So hey, look, this guy has a large assortment of guns, some very unique and expensive, quite
[27:11.920 --> 27:12.920]  frankly.
[27:12.920 --> 27:17.840]  But so he's got a very large assortment of guns here.
[27:17.840 --> 27:20.200]  Everything on there is perfectly legal.
[27:20.200 --> 27:23.080]  People went through it, they did the research.
[27:23.080 --> 27:27.400]  Every single thing there is legal.
[27:27.400 --> 27:33.320]  But oh, see, he gets investigated.
[27:33.320 --> 27:37.040]  He has the FBI go to his home and now they're pieces of evidence.
[27:37.040 --> 27:41.520]  And now the imaging, the imagery, the picture is just so shocking.
[27:41.520 --> 27:46.840]  Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, look at all of his guns.
[27:46.840 --> 27:49.360]  Oh, it's so bad.
[27:49.360 --> 27:50.880]  And so this is what they're doing now.
[27:50.880 --> 27:53.360]  This is the propaganda.
[27:53.360 --> 27:55.480]  Just having guns is illegal now.
[27:55.480 --> 27:58.760]  And of course, it's not, but that's the narrative.
[27:58.760 --> 28:06.200]  That's the optics of this, showing this, oh, domestic terrorists, oh, all these guns.
[28:06.200 --> 28:14.120]  So it's all about demonizing legal activity, demonizing the American flag, demonizing guns.
[28:14.120 --> 28:18.240]  And again, he was in the Capitol.
[28:18.240 --> 28:21.880]  There's no denying that, but they won't go after him and his mother.
[28:21.880 --> 28:23.480]  This guy has to be 50 years old.
[28:23.480 --> 28:25.600]  I'm not, I mean, he has to be at least 50 years old.
[28:25.600 --> 28:26.600]  How old is his mother?
[28:26.600 --> 28:27.600]  70?
[28:27.600 --> 28:32.280]  So his mother's in there with like a walker, like, oh, little Johnny, let's go over here.
[28:32.280 --> 28:34.200]  It's like, get that woman.
[28:34.200 --> 28:36.120]  She was in the Capitol.
[28:36.120 --> 28:37.760]  But now it's so bad.
[28:37.760 --> 28:42.760]  US soccer star Carly Lloyd explains why she stood for the National Anthem.
[28:42.760 --> 28:49.240]  This is a US women's soccer team player, World Cup champion, and she has to explain why
[28:49.240 --> 28:51.800]  she stands for the National Anthem.
[28:51.800 --> 28:53.800]  That's how bad it's gotten.
[28:53.800 --> 28:56.880]  That's how much they've demonized Americans and regular American activity, like standing
[28:56.880 --> 28:59.680]  for the anthem.
[28:59.680 --> 29:04.000]  President Trump won in a landslide on November 3rd, but the globalists weren't going to
[29:04.000 --> 29:05.800]  let that happen.
[29:05.800 --> 29:10.520]  They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement, emanating from the United
[29:10.520 --> 29:15.760]  States, and it spread across the world, from the UK to Brazil.
[29:15.760 --> 29:16.760]  They were desperate.
[29:16.760 --> 29:17.760]  They admitted their own publications.
[29:17.760 --> 29:19.240]  They didn't know what to do.
[29:19.240 --> 29:25.760]  And so they put out 80 million fake ballots, violated state law, and stole it better than
[29:25.760 --> 29:26.760]  dollars.
[29:26.760 --> 29:28.320]  And now they're coming after the president.
[29:28.320 --> 29:29.320]  They're coming after you.
[29:29.320 --> 29:30.320]  They're coming after me.
[29:30.320 --> 29:32.600]  They're shutting everybody off the internet.
[29:32.600 --> 29:34.600]  They're trying to totally censor us.
[29:34.600 --> 29:38.600]  And that's why M-Full Wars is still in the fight, because we knew this was coming.
[29:38.600 --> 29:39.600]  We told you this was coming.
[29:39.600 --> 29:44.440]  We were the first main target, and we're still on air at M-FullWars.com and NewsWars.com
[29:44.440 --> 29:46.160]  and band up with you.
[29:46.160 --> 29:49.080]  Without your word of mouth, without your prayer, without your financial support, we
[29:49.080 --> 29:50.080]  can't stay on air.
[29:50.080 --> 29:54.040]  So while you still can, go to M-FullWars.com and get storeable foods and high-quality
[29:54.040 --> 29:59.000]  products, supplements, you name it, at M-FullWars.com.
[29:59.000 --> 30:04.240]  Our activated charcoal toothpaste became a best-seller overnight, because activated charcoal
[30:04.240 --> 30:07.760]  is already one of the top-selling, fastest-growing toothpaste out there.
[30:07.760 --> 30:12.400]  The problem is, a lot of the other over-the-counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring, very,
[30:12.400 --> 30:13.400]  very toxic.
[30:13.400 --> 30:15.000]  And also, they have fluoride in it.
[30:15.000 --> 30:16.000]  This does not have the fluoride.
[30:16.000 --> 30:17.640]  It doesn't have the additives.
[30:17.640 --> 30:22.120]  This is a concentrated, really is, high-quality, it's been sold out for months because of supply
[30:22.120 --> 30:25.480]  chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage.
[30:25.480 --> 30:31.640]  But now, it's back in stock, M-FullWars, Dr. Jones Naturals, activated charcoal toothpaste.

[30:59.480 --> 31:03.520]  Introducing M-FullWars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[31:03.520 --> 31:05.320]  This is taken under the tongue.
[31:05.320 --> 31:08.160]  It is pure turmeric.
[31:08.160 --> 31:13.160]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as
[31:13.160 --> 31:17.520]  a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[31:17.520 --> 31:21.680]  This is absorbed under the tongue, into the bloodstream, and then the remaining also is
[31:21.680 --> 31:25.840]  then absorbed by the stomach, so it's more of an intense delivery system.
[31:25.840 --> 31:30.400]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates, and our first product got rave
[31:30.400 --> 31:31.400]  reviews.
[31:31.400 --> 31:33.080]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[31:33.080 --> 31:35.320]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[31:35.320 --> 31:36.600]  Some like bodies better.
[31:36.600 --> 31:41.160]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more, and they fund the
[31:41.160 --> 31:42.160]  M-FullWars.

[33:20.160 --> 33:41.120]  We're back here live, The Alex Jones Show, Sunday Night Admission, and I'm gonna be taking
[33:41.120 --> 33:45.200]  nothing but phone calls for two hours tonight.
[33:45.200 --> 33:47.880]  We may be able to open up the phone lines before that, but we got some other special
[33:47.880 --> 33:53.920]  reports we need to air, and I got some news I needed to cover, but guaranteed Sunday Night
[33:53.920 --> 34:00.440]  Live tonight, two hours of your phone calls, and we'll keep it open for any subject of
[34:00.440 --> 34:02.440]  discussion.
[34:02.440 --> 34:07.680]  One of the main subjects of discussion is the unpopularity of Joe Biden, so much so
[34:07.680 --> 34:12.320]  now even that the liberal left is turning against him, Black Lives Matter has turned
[34:12.320 --> 34:18.080]  against him, a lot of buyers remorse or should I say voters remorse on the side of the liberal
[34:18.080 --> 34:26.480]  progressive Democrat, but despite from the scary nature of the creeping communism of
[34:26.480 --> 34:33.320]  Joe and Kamala, there has been some comedy so far, Biden falling apart, fumbling and
[34:33.320 --> 34:40.600]  bumbling during speeches, the Marines not saluting him, him seeming to just like speak
[34:40.600 --> 34:46.880]  out whatever someone's saying into his ear, very strange, something being like jacked
[34:46.880 --> 34:52.000]  into during a live press conference talking about plea deals, so it's been very comical,
[34:52.000 --> 34:58.480]  and there's some other comedy developing, including, you cannot make this up, maybe
[34:58.480 --> 35:04.080]  the best comedy feature yet, Joe Biden after his inauguration tried to get into the White
[35:04.080 --> 35:11.800]  House and was locked out, what a shame, here's the report.
[35:11.800 --> 35:16.600]  Awkward, there are the Bidens standing in the cold waiting to be let into their new
[35:16.600 --> 35:23.240]  home, the White House, everyone wondered what was going on, why were the doors shut, well
[35:23.240 --> 35:28.320]  now we know, the chief usher who was supposed to open the door to fire.
[35:28.320 --> 35:33.320]  Timothy Harloth was hired by the Trumps in 2017 after he had worked for them at the Trump
[35:33.320 --> 35:39.200]  International Hotel in D.C., but the Bidens reportedly wanted a chief usher with no ties
[35:39.200 --> 35:45.960]  to Trump, so Harloth was fired at 11.30 a.m., just as the inauguration ceremony was getting
[35:45.960 --> 35:46.960]  underway.
[35:46.960 --> 35:56.320]  Aw, darn it, Joe Biden locked out of the White House immediately as he opposed to enter after
[35:56.320 --> 36:02.240]  his inauguration, isn't that classic, and it's their own fault, fired the doorman because
[36:02.240 --> 36:11.680]  he was with Trump and then had no way to get inside, oh, nobody feels bad for you, Joe,
[36:11.680 --> 36:16.120]  because it's not your house anyway, so technically he did have to break in.
[36:16.120 --> 36:22.480]  So yes, Joe Biden had to break into the White House after his inauguration, because he was
[36:22.480 --> 36:29.720]  never elected president, so yes, he is actually technically Joe Biden, that's a B&E, that's
[36:29.720 --> 36:35.680]  a breaking and entering, I don't know what the squatting laws are in D.C., but I guarantee
[36:35.680 --> 36:39.480]  you, besides this, the breaking and entering, I mean, we have some serious charges here
[36:39.480 --> 36:44.800]  against Biden, he is not supposed to be there, but there he is anyway.
[36:44.800 --> 36:50.800]  Some cartoonists have decided to have a good laugh, but then also some dark humor about
[36:50.800 --> 36:57.240]  it as well, about the Joe Biden inauguration, you know, I'm not sure who has, who made this
[36:57.240 --> 37:02.120]  originally, and I apologize to the original artist, it may be somewhere watermarked on
[37:02.120 --> 37:10.360]  this, but anyway, a cartoonist put together this cartoon depicting the clown show that
[37:10.360 --> 37:16.640]  was the Joe Biden inauguration, but what was really behind it.
[37:16.640 --> 37:25.720]  So you can see it's just nothing but troops out there, no people, no one in attendance.
[37:25.720 --> 37:30.400]  You solemnly swear to preserve, protect, and uphold the Constitution of the United States
[37:30.400 --> 37:31.400]  of America.
[37:31.400 --> 37:35.960]  Come on, man, that's like saying you, before you got in this program, you take a test where
[37:35.960 --> 37:38.840]  you're taking cocaine or not, what do you think, huh?
[37:38.840 --> 37:43.960]  We hold these troops to be self-evident, all men and women created them, but go, you
[37:43.960 --> 37:45.960]  know the thing.
[37:45.960 --> 37:58.880]  Anyway, the point I want to make is Corn Pop was a bad dude and he ran a bunch of bad boys,
[37:58.880 --> 38:04.360]  and I did, and back in those days, you saw how things had changed, I learned, I learned
[38:04.360 --> 38:12.200]  a lot, and I learned that you stack spaghetti sauce at a store in a supermarket, you control
[38:12.200 --> 38:18.880]  the guy or the woman who runs the, runs, brings out the carts on, on, on a forklift, and by
[38:18.880 --> 38:24.080]  the way, it costs a lot of money, it cost about 740 million, billion dollars over ten
[38:24.080 --> 38:25.080]  years.
[38:25.080 --> 38:26.080]  Okay.
[38:26.080 --> 38:27.080]  No.
[38:27.080 --> 38:28.080]  What happened?
[38:28.080 --> 38:33.680]  Do you solemnly swear to preserve, protect, and uphold the Constitution of the United
[38:33.680 --> 38:34.680]  States of America?
[38:34.680 --> 38:49.080]  Well done, freedom tunes, that's it, thank you guys, very popular there on the YouTube,
[38:49.080 --> 38:53.160]  they'll probably get banned soon, I'm sorry guys, I didn't mean to out you like that,
[38:53.160 --> 38:59.800]  but very funny stuff right there, very accurate, very funny, but it's sad, the whole world
[38:59.800 --> 39:05.000]  sees now how a man that was never elected was installed president of the United States
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.560]  and they had to use the whole, well as many as they could get on, national guard, military
[39:09.560 --> 39:15.200]  force to have the installation and then pretend like there was some sort of a security threat,
[39:15.200 --> 39:23.400]  and you know, perhaps we can have this debate maybe now is the time, but you know, we really
[39:23.400 --> 39:30.760]  got tricked and you set up on the sixth, but it's too bad because I'm wondering in hindsight,
[39:30.760 --> 39:36.560]  if we shouldn't have been out there on inauguration day peacefully, not actually trying to tear
[39:36.560 --> 39:40.560]  into anything or break things or smash anything or anything like that, but actually peacefully
[39:40.560 --> 39:46.800]  doing it like we successfully did in November and December to just show the millions of
[39:46.800 --> 39:50.760]  Trump supporters out there while there are no Biden supporters, of course that was the
[39:50.760 --> 39:56.000]  idea that's what we wanted to do, then we got set up on the sixth and they stole our
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.320]  first amendment and then labeled us domestic terrorists and are now arresting as many people
[40:00.320 --> 40:06.000]  as they possibly can that were associated with the events, including Joe Bix is being
[40:06.000 --> 40:11.120]  harassed right now, and of course they've taken him down off every social media platform,
[40:11.120 --> 40:13.200]  he's not even allowed to have banking.
[40:13.200 --> 40:18.160]  So tough situation there for Joe Bix, I know they set up a give send go account to help
[40:18.160 --> 40:19.160]  him with legal fees.
[40:19.160 --> 40:26.040]  I mean, this is what they're doing, folks, and the whole world sees what they had to
[40:26.040 --> 40:34.080]  do to fake the election of Biden, steal it, and then do that fake inauguration ceremony.
[40:34.080 --> 40:38.800]  Tulsi Gabbard says domestic terrorism bill is a targeting of almost half the country
[40:38.800 --> 40:42.520]  and she's right.
[40:42.520 --> 40:49.440]  And so she's right about that and she can't like what Biden is doing on the warfront troops
[40:49.440 --> 40:54.160]  moving back into the Middle East, including Syria, so it looks like we'll be right back
[40:54.160 --> 40:55.800]  in those wars quickly.
[40:55.800 --> 41:03.800]  And now China is being even more aggressive in the South China Sea and in Taiwan and in
[41:03.800 --> 41:09.440]  Hong Kong, apparently the US is sending some forces into those areas though as well.
[41:09.440 --> 41:18.040]  So some favor rattling there, but look at the rest of this sham for Biden, Instagram
[41:18.040 --> 41:22.440]  forcing users to follow Biden White House account so he doesn't look so unpopular.
[41:22.440 --> 41:26.400]  Now I had friends sending me all the screenshots of this this morning.
[41:26.400 --> 41:31.160]  And of course the story is at info wars.com with all the screenshots as well.
[41:31.160 --> 41:34.920]  People unfollowed the account once Trump got out because they didn't want the Biden White
[41:34.920 --> 41:35.920]  House.
[41:35.920 --> 41:37.400]  And then they find out it never unfollowed.
[41:37.400 --> 41:38.480]  They unfollowed again.
[41:38.480 --> 41:39.560]  They're unfollowed.
[41:39.560 --> 41:44.760]  So they're they're rigging social media now to make it look like Biden is popular.
[41:44.760 --> 41:48.240]  And of course that's that's all it is is fake just like his election.
[41:48.240 --> 41:53.840]  So that's why they are ending the comments on YouTube and on all accounts related to
[41:53.840 --> 41:55.000]  Joe Biden.
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.920]  That's why YouTube is is changing the numbers of the likes and dislikes because it was five
[41:58.920 --> 42:02.800]  to one, probably really more than 10 to one, but they've rigged it so much now you don't
[42:02.800 --> 42:03.800]  even know.
[42:03.800 --> 42:08.000]  So they're totally having to rig all the numbers just to even fake that Biden has any
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.240]  popularity.
[42:10.240 --> 42:18.320]  And then they have the audacity to lie about Trump even on his way out.
[42:18.320 --> 42:22.280]  And so I'm going to get to that on the other side of this break.
[42:22.280 --> 42:29.240]  But that's incredible, folks, YouTube erasing dislikes from Biden videos because he has
[42:29.240 --> 42:33.840]  more dislikes than likes still can't even get a quarter of the views that any Trump
[42:33.840 --> 42:38.360]  video got Instagram forcing followers to follow the Biden White House.
[42:38.360 --> 42:43.920]  The White House having to ban commenting on Biden videos because they're all negative
[42:43.920 --> 42:46.360]  calling him a pedophile saying he didn't win.
[42:46.360 --> 42:49.480]  So I mean, that's bad news, Biden's bad news.
[42:49.480 --> 42:51.320]  He really doesn't even know what's going on.
[42:51.320 --> 42:52.640]  The communists are running him.
[42:52.640 --> 42:56.240]  He's crushing our economy in record fashion, but nobody likes this guy.
[42:56.240 --> 42:58.480]  He's the most unpopular president ever fake president.
[42:58.480 --> 43:01.600]  This is Greg Reese from info wars dot com.
[43:01.600 --> 43:05.760]  I have many reasons to be grateful for working at info wars.

[43:23.960 --> 43:29.000]  Before trying vitamin mineral fusion, I always questioned if vitamin supplements ever actually
[43:29.000 --> 43:30.000]  did anything.
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.960]  I never felt much of an effect from other products.
[43:33.960 --> 43:38.800]  But I felt vitamin mineral fusion the first time I took it immediately.
[43:38.800 --> 43:40.840]  I love how it dissolves in water.
[43:40.840 --> 43:42.760]  I take it every day with my supper.
[43:42.760 --> 43:44.280]  It tastes great.

[44:19.720 --> 44:20.720]  food supply.
[44:20.720 --> 44:24.360]  The last 25 years, one month, three months, six months, one year supplies, and it's the
[44:24.360 --> 44:28.480]  highest quality you're going to find and it's just good to have that checkbox taken care

[44:48.600 --> 44:49.600]  It starts with self defense.
[44:49.600 --> 44:50.600]  It starts with being prepared.
[44:50.600 --> 44:54.680]  It starts with horrible food, it starts with digging in with a long globalist fight.
[44:54.680 --> 44:58.960]  You'll let in the end.
[44:58.960 --> 45:02.080]  I love the Patriot blend.

[45:25.520 --> 45:26.520]  We drink it every day.
[45:26.520 --> 45:31.520]  And of course that's just one of the great ways you can support info wars here.

[45:38.440 --> 45:39.440]  Patriot blend.
[45:39.440 --> 45:40.880]  Of course, read all the great reviews.
[45:40.880 --> 45:44.800]  Pretty much perfect review there 4.9 star when you have thousands of reviews.
[45:44.800 --> 45:48.840]  It's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody gives it five stars.
[45:48.840 --> 45:51.960]  I mean, if you have 4.9 that's pretty much everybody gives it a five star except maybe
[45:51.960 --> 45:52.960]  one or two people.
[45:52.960 --> 45:59.320]  Patriot blend 100% organic coffee only available at info wars store dot com.
[45:59.320 --> 46:03.960]  We told you it was coming under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore for eight
[46:03.960 --> 46:04.960]  months.
[46:04.960 --> 46:09.040]  They've made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that makes them a social distance and
[46:09.040 --> 46:12.040]  report them back to cell towers to track for every movement.
[46:12.040 --> 46:13.040]  This is for everybody.
[46:13.040 --> 46:18.560]  The way it gets better now France has programs in their factories government push and sponsor
[46:18.560 --> 46:23.960]  to make everyone wear actual dog collars to make a social distance and report back to
[46:23.960 --> 46:24.960]  simple computers.
[46:24.960 --> 46:29.960]  They're turning us into a commodity human animal clones have been around for 50 years.
[46:29.960 --> 46:31.080]  It's all being announced.
[46:31.080 --> 46:36.240]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete and big corporations
[46:36.240 --> 46:41.080]  now play that they own us with these gene therapy systems and patents that they produced.
[46:41.080 --> 46:45.800]  Do you understand it is a takeover of the entire species of the genetic level and now
[46:45.800 --> 46:50.080]  they're coming with dog collars and they're announcing in public schools in the U.S. starting
[46:50.080 --> 46:51.360]  next year it will begin.
[46:51.360 --> 46:56.680]  Did you hear me dog collars for your children all based on a hoax all based on a lot in
[46:56.680 --> 47:01.920]  poor wars continue to spread the word to fight back.
[47:01.920 --> 47:09.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:09.720 --> 47:14.600]  I also have some news to share on the president's response to domestic violent extremism.
[47:14.600 --> 47:20.120]  The January 6th assault on the capital and the tragic deaths and destruction that occurred
[47:20.120 --> 47:25.240]  underscored what we have long known the rise of domestic violent extremism is a serious
[47:25.240 --> 47:27.640]  and growing national security threat.
[47:27.640 --> 47:32.480]  The Biden administration will confront this threat with the necessary resources and resolve.
[47:32.480 --> 47:36.720]  We're committed to developing policies and strategies based on facts on objective and
[47:36.720 --> 47:49.480]  rigorous analysis and honor respect for constitutionally protected free speech and political activities.
[47:49.480 --> 47:55.840]  Well Jen Pesaki the White House Press Secretary former Obama minion now serving as a Biden
[47:55.840 --> 48:03.440]  chief spokesperson gave a press conference on Friday and said that non-governmental organizations
[48:03.440 --> 48:08.440]  the Southern Poverty Law Center in the ADL are going to advise them on what Americans
[48:08.440 --> 48:12.120]  to put on the extremist terror list no judge no jury.
[48:12.120 --> 48:16.040]  Our initial work on DV will broadly fall into three areas.
[48:16.040 --> 48:21.560]  The first is a tasking from President Biden sent to the ODNI today requesting a comprehensive
[48:21.560 --> 48:27.960]  threat assessment coordinated with the FBI and DHS on domestic violent extremism.
[48:27.960 --> 48:32.600]  This assessment will draw on the analysis from across the government and as appropriate
[48:32.600 --> 48:35.280]  non-governmental organizations.
[48:35.280 --> 48:40.320]  The key point here is that we want fact-based analysis upon which we can shape policy.
[48:40.320 --> 48:45.080]  So this is really the first step in the process and we will rely on our appropriate law enforcement
[48:45.080 --> 48:48.240]  and intelligence officials to provide that analysis.
[48:48.240 --> 48:54.280]  And then the military the FBI local police everyone will disrupt these terrorist networks
[48:54.280 --> 48:58.480]  now that's the same language when you heard disrupt Al Qaeda networks that means go kill
[48:58.480 --> 49:03.560]  people let me set people up that means infiltrate it means take their bank accounts and they
[49:03.560 --> 49:07.600]  wasted no time taking the president's corporate bank accounts in New York and now his private
[49:07.600 --> 49:12.880]  bank accounts in Florida and if they can get Trump they get anybody just like I said they
[49:12.880 --> 49:17.320]  could shut me down online a few years ago they were coming for you next Congress must
[49:17.320 --> 49:23.320]  act and take action this is beyond authoritarianism this is more sophisticated than what Hitler
[49:23.320 --> 49:24.320]  did.
[49:24.320 --> 49:29.080]  The second will be the building of an NSC capability to focus on countering domestic
[49:29.080 --> 49:35.080]  violent extremism as a part of this the NSC will undertake a policy review effort to determine
[49:35.080 --> 49:40.120]  how the government can share information better about this threat support efforts to prevent
[49:40.120 --> 49:44.080]  radicalization disrupt violent extremist networks and more.
[49:44.080 --> 49:50.040]  There's important work already underway across the interagency in countering DV and we need
[49:50.040 --> 49:55.600]  to understand better its current extent and where there may be gaps to to address so we
[49:55.600 --> 49:57.520]  can determine the best path forward.
[49:57.520 --> 50:01.720]  The third will be coordinating relevant parts of the federal government to enhance and accelerate
[50:01.720 --> 50:03.800]  efforts to address DV.
[50:03.800 --> 50:09.520]  This considered NSC convened process will focus on addressing evolving threats radicalization
[50:09.520 --> 50:15.400]  the role of social media opportunities to improve information sharing operational responses
[50:15.400 --> 50:16.400]  and more.
[50:16.400 --> 50:19.720]  You have to understand the southern part of your law center spokesperson sauceburg Cohen
[50:19.720 --> 50:25.760]  said a few years ago last year as their spokesperson he said we need to arrest the heads of big
[50:25.760 --> 50:28.080]  tech if they don't do what we say.
[50:28.080 --> 50:31.480]  And so you understand the ADL the southern part of your law center they are funded by
[50:31.480 --> 50:34.960]  George Soros and other criminal groups that have overthrown foreign governments many
[50:34.960 --> 50:40.320]  times and betting its currencies and really it behaves like a James Bond villain and he's
[50:40.320 --> 50:43.880]  teamed up with Klaus Schwab who's literally a James Bond villain bringing in the great
[50:43.880 --> 50:48.600]  reset so this is an incredible time to be alive my friends and you need to go see the
[50:48.600 --> 50:54.240]  video it's on info wars.com for yourself because we've become accustomed to tyranny like the
[50:54.240 --> 50:58.200]  frog in the pot that's boiling and now it's at high boil we're about to die politically
[50:58.200 --> 51:03.400]  and the Democrats admit this is a systematic takeover they say they want reeducation camps
[51:03.400 --> 51:08.400]  for libertarians Christians they say that anybody that doesn't take the covid shots
[51:08.400 --> 51:12.200]  or doesn't allow the contact tracers into their homes will be sent to these facilities
[51:12.200 --> 51:16.400]  to be locked up and we're all following UN directives they're all making the same announcements
[51:16.400 --> 51:22.000]  in Australia and in Canada and in the U.S. all in the blue cities and blue states and
[51:22.000 --> 51:27.440]  now they're going to further bankrupt the country with an ongoing lockdown get everybody
[51:27.440 --> 51:31.280]  at each other's throats get everybody on the government dole bringing a universal basic
[51:31.280 --> 51:37.200]  incomes they can control every aspect of your life and so this is the last straw for America
[51:37.200 --> 51:42.120]  this is going to break our back completely we need Congress we need the governors we need
[51:42.120 --> 51:47.040]  coalitions of individuals to come together and say no to this clear and present criminal
[51:47.040 --> 51:52.800]  danger you can't have private groups like the southern property law center in ADL openly
[51:52.800 --> 52:00.740]  advising CIA and FBI at threat centers on on on who needs to be routed out and and who
[52:00.740 --> 52:05.880]  needs to be disrupted those are the terms they use Brennan was on last week former head
[52:05.880 --> 52:10.960]  of the CIA top levels running us the military actions against the people he said we need
[52:10.960 --> 52:15.240]  to use the military we need to use the FBI we need to use all local police to root out
[52:15.240 --> 52:20.680]  the Trump supporters from Christians who are extreme we believe in God and who aren't
[52:20.680 --> 52:25.600]  for abortion down to libertarians it's so much more difficult today because of what
[52:25.600 --> 52:29.920]  we have seen not just over the last two weeks but that certainly has riveted our attention
[52:29.920 --> 52:34.600]  but because of this growth in polarization in the United States and domestic violence
[52:34.600 --> 52:40.320]  and white supremacist groups so I know looking forward that the members of the the Biden team
[52:40.320 --> 52:46.720]  who have been nominated or have been appointed are now moving in laser like fashion to try
[52:46.720 --> 52:52.080]  to uncover as much as they can about what looks very similar to insurgency movements
[52:52.080 --> 52:56.720]  that we've seen overseas where they germinate in different parts of the country and they
[52:56.720 --> 53:02.480]  gain strength and it brings together an unholy alliance frequently of religious six religious
[53:02.480 --> 53:10.160]  extremists authoritarians fascists bigots racist nativists even libertarians and unfortunately
[53:10.160 --> 53:14.280]  I think there has been this momentum that has been generated as a result of unfortunately
[53:14.280 --> 53:19.000]  the demagogic rhetoric of people that's just the part of government but also those who
[53:19.000 --> 53:24.840]  continue in the halls of Congress and so I really do think that the law enforcement
[53:24.840 --> 53:29.600]  homeland security intelligence and even the defense officials are doing everything possible
[53:29.600 --> 53:36.120]  to root out what seems to be a very very serious and insidious threat to our democracy in our
[53:36.120 --> 53:42.000]  republic it is illegal for the federal government to use the CIA domestically against the American
[53:42.000 --> 53:46.760]  people it is illegal to use the military in a political fashion to spell the American
[53:46.760 --> 53:51.360]  people all of this is illegal but what's even more outrageous and illegal is to have the
[53:51.360 --> 53:57.240]  southern poverty law center ADL and other organizations controlled by multinational corporations
[53:57.240 --> 54:02.520]  and foreign funders like George Soros to be involved in private intelligence gathering
[54:02.520 --> 54:06.840]  against the American people and then interfacing with the national security apparatus of the
[54:06.840 --> 54:14.040]  state this is the purge the purge isn't coming the purge is here Americans don't have reflexes
[54:14.040 --> 54:17.920]  to fight tyranny because we have never seen something like this since our founding but
[54:17.920 --> 54:21.800]  this is the same thing the Russians went under the same thing the Nazis went under the same
[54:21.800 --> 54:27.200]  thing the poor Chinese went under and we now have private security networks controlled
[54:27.200 --> 54:31.960]  by master criminal George Soros the southern poverty law center and ADL working from offshore
[54:31.960 --> 54:36.720]  bank accounts with billions running private intelligence networks who have been arrested
[54:36.720 --> 54:42.320]  before for breaking into police stations and getting files on US citizens to then create
[54:42.320 --> 54:46.800]  false information false files on their enemies and handed over the Democratic Party now they're
[54:46.800 --> 54:51.760]  simply making this criminal activity have been involved in the decades a public operation
[54:51.760 --> 54:56.600]  against the American people and against the world but you have to understand I'm not the
[54:56.600 --> 55:00.240]  target they have to get rid of the opposition before they fully bankrupt the nation put
[55:00.240 --> 55:05.440]  us into receivership and phase the dollar into this new global UN Chinese back currency
[55:05.440 --> 55:09.320]  it's all been announced so if you speak up against this if you realize this is a plan
[55:09.320 --> 55:14.000]  to shut down the economy if you realize it's a plan to make you a financial slave if you
[55:14.000 --> 55:19.880]  realize there's a plan to shut down our energy systems and and fully make a serfs then still
[55:19.880 --> 55:22.840]  elements that are good in Congress and elements that are good inside the state governments
[55:22.840 --> 55:26.880]  can unify now and say no to this plan we're covering it all at band.video and info wars
[55:26.880 --> 55:40.560]  dot com god bless and good luck war terrible war widows orphans a motherless child this
[55:40.560 --> 55:46.440]  was the uprising that rocked our land thirteen districts rebelled against the country that
[55:46.440 --> 55:53.600]  fed them loved them protected them brother turned on brother until nothing remained
[55:53.600 --> 56:10.560]  and then came the peace hard fought so only one a people rose up from the ashes and a
[56:10.560 --> 56:19.440]  new era was born but freedom has a cost when the traitors were defeated we swore as a nation
[56:19.440 --> 56:27.240]  we would never know this reason and so it was decreed that each year the various districts
[56:27.240 --> 56:34.040]  of Pan Am would offer up in tribute one young man and woman to fight to the death and the
[56:34.040 --> 56:42.080]  pageant of honor courage and sacrifice the lone victor bathed in riches would serve
[56:42.080 --> 56:53.880]  as a reminder of our generosity this is how we remember our past this is how we safeguard
[56:53.880 --> 57:02.720]  our future students at Harvard now want to set up kind of a reeducation camps and moral
[57:02.720 --> 57:09.920]  rehabilitation centers and institutions for vetting people who had the chutzpah to work
[57:09.920 --> 57:16.120]  in the Trump administration and the question is how are we going to pick this special report
[57:16.120 --> 57:21.880]  back up with these compilations just showing you what the left or the democrat party the
[57:21.880 --> 57:28.640]  liberal progressive movement has in store for you and for us and when you get to the
[57:28.640 --> 57:33.320]  brass tacks of it it's pretty frightening but uh well you got to admit it's clownish
[57:33.320 --> 57:39.920]  in its approach and in its execution totally unpopular but like alex said we don't have
[57:39.920 --> 57:44.200]  the will we don't have the reflexes we're just allowing these people to make us slaves
[57:44.200 --> 57:51.520]  because we just told we can't fight back anybody listening to my voice simply search
[57:51.520 --> 58:00.440]  in the term davos group technocracy or technocrats you will get claus schwaab and john codd yunker
[58:00.440 --> 58:06.960]  and all the new world order globalists like gg pink saying that they no longer want elected
[58:06.960 --> 58:12.480]  leaders over governments but they want businessmen technocrats over them and that's who claus
[58:12.480 --> 58:16.640]  schwaab is you might want to look into the guy that says they've watched the covid-19
[58:16.640 --> 58:20.240]  lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor you might want to find out who this super
[58:20.240 --> 58:25.560]  villain is you see he believes because he's hidden playing you and you're not speaking
[58:25.560 --> 58:28.880]  out against it that he has the right to do it you might want to find out who he works
[58:28.880 --> 58:35.360]  for yours directly for prince charles he developed since the 80s the plan for global sustainability
[58:35.360 --> 58:40.880]  that means worldwide neo feudalism in his own works so you might want to find out how he
[58:40.880 --> 58:45.080]  talks about using vaccines to sterilize you before you take those shots you might just
[58:45.080 --> 58:50.080]  want to find out who this villain is all right
[58:50.080 --> 58:55.160]  don't pay for it in colorado thank you for holding how you doing alex man i'm just working
[58:55.160 --> 58:58.600]  as hard as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you i love you man i
[58:58.600 --> 59:04.160]  want to make a quick plug that dna force i love it i've been using it quite a while
[59:04.160 --> 59:08.720]  and i just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see that it contains
[59:08.720 --> 59:16.440]  corsets in which according to some published studies that dr mercola has cited is an ion
[59:16.440 --> 59:22.760]  of four similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cell so
[59:22.760 --> 59:28.680]  people might want to take a look at that all i know is with dna force we went out and looked
[59:28.680 --> 59:33.520]  at these high end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription
[59:33.520 --> 59:36.960]  but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product
[59:36.960 --> 59:41.320]  and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top
[59:41.320 --> 59:51.880]  brands together and that's what produced this so thanks thanks for the plug
[59:51.880 --> 1:00:00.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:00.920 --> 1:00:15.760]  you found it the tip of the spear it is how are we going to really almost deprogram these
[1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:22.080]  people who have signed up for the cult of trump experts say they see cult like behavior
[1:00:22.080 --> 1:00:31.880]  we have there are millions of americans almost all white almost all republicans who somehow
[1:00:31.880 --> 1:00:38.320]  need to be deprogrammed there it's as if they go they they they're members of a cult the
[1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:44.760]  trumpets cult and we have to be deprogrammed because they've been brainwashed joy i really
[1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:49.960]  believe that they have been brainwashed by this misinformation campaign so how do you
[1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:56.520]  de-radicalize these people joining us now is steven hasson he's a mental health professional
[1:00:56.520 --> 1:01:01.720]  who has been helping deprogram people out of cults for decades he's also the author
[1:01:01.720 --> 1:01:08.880]  of the cult of trump there are millions of people who believe that the election was rigged
[1:01:08.880 --> 1:01:15.640]  how do you begin to deprogram them once we educate them we coach them on how to interact
[1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:19.920]  and empower the person to start thinking for themselves i think a lot of people are going
[1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:27.320]  to have to be deprogrammed we had a program addressing white supremacists that we had
[1:01:27.320 --> 1:01:35.040]  programs federal programs that went towards funding organizations like these that de-radicalized
[1:01:35.040 --> 1:01:44.000]  people and president trump pulled the plug on federal funding for some of these programs
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:49.360]  and so one thing that we know is that we have to get that funding right back up and we probably
[1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:56.720]  need to double triple quadruple or increase funding for these de-radicalization programs
[1:01:56.720 --> 1:02:03.240]  we can look to history though what ultimately breaks that power structure in the south is
[1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:08.720]  enforcement right there has to be consequences david akins is a dnc member as you said he's
[1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:17.200]  also the leader of the california democrats and he is suggesting that over half our country
[1:02:17.200 --> 1:02:22.040]  needs to be reprogrammed not just 75 million people that voted for trump but the conservatives
[1:02:22.040 --> 1:02:27.640]  in this country a bernie sanders staffer was caught on undercover camera saying that trump
[1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:31.640]  voters should be sent to reeducation camps what are we going to do with those people
[1:02:31.640 --> 1:02:39.560]  that resist the change because that's a big deal well i'll tell you what in cuba what
[1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:51.400]  do they do to reactionaries they shot him on the beach
[1:02:51.400 --> 1:03:09.520]  they felt that this counterrevolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing
[1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:16.760]  reeducation centers in the southwest where we would take all the people who needed to
[1:03:16.760 --> 1:03:24.280]  be reeducated into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be
[1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:29.560]  i ask well what is going to happen to those people that we can't reeducate that are diehard
[1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:37.120]  cap capitalists and the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated and when i pursued this
[1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:43.280]  further they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these reeducation
[1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:49.280]  centers and when i say eliminate i mean kill 25 million people so part of it is we have
[1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:53.840]  to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong
[1:03:53.840 --> 1:03:57.760]  to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities once it's everybody's
[1:03:57.760 --> 1:04:03.040]  responsibility and not just the households then we start making better investments i
[1:04:03.040 --> 1:04:11.920]  have decided we really need camps for adults and we need the kind of camps that you all
[1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:17.840]  run i mean really the bottom line is all of america needs the programming because we've
[1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:24.920]  all been negatively influenced by donald trump and now arise a political extremism white
[1:04:24.920 --> 1:04:34.200]  supremacy domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat believe me folks
[1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:41.480]  i understand your first reaction to this it's mine too run run run from these psychopaths
[1:04:41.480 --> 1:04:45.800]  but here's the problem it's not just a bunch of hot air going out over the airwaves or
[1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:50.960]  out of biden's mouth at the democrat party they have the political will to enslave you
[1:04:50.960 --> 1:04:59.200]  do they have the physical will to murder

[1:06:03.840 --> 1:06:12.000]  the spear leading the fight to take back the nation it's olyn shroyer you're listening
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:21.360]  to the alex jones show we go back now to a special report from alex jones on how the
[1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:28.720]  great reset is being used to make america dependent on foreign energy which will eventually
[1:06:28.720 --> 1:06:37.000]  of course collapse our country meteorologists are reporting that this is one of the coldest
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:41.520]  winners in north america in many many decades but that doesn't stop the left from saying
[1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:47.000]  we have global warming and so you need to turn over control of all oil all gas all natural
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:51.480]  resources to them because again carbon is a bad thing think about that you're made up
[1:06:51.480 --> 1:06:58.360]  out of carbon the life cycle on this planet is the sun water carbon dioxide oxygen you
[1:06:58.360 --> 1:07:02.880]  gotta have those four things for life and they've named one of them toxic and bad and
[1:07:02.880 --> 1:07:08.480]  so they're saying all us power plants that put off any type of carbon dioxide must be
[1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:12.600]  banned and shut down even we have the cleanest plants in the world china has no controls
[1:07:12.600 --> 1:07:18.960]  on their plants and has energy about 20% the cost of ours when it comes from coal power
[1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:25.120]  if we don't have cheap electricity you can have factories and businesses and industries
[1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:29.960]  here in the united states that's why elon musk announced yesterday to the texas railroad
[1:07:29.960 --> 1:07:34.480]  commission that runs oil and gas drilling that he's going to drill super deep wells
[1:07:34.480 --> 1:07:39.080]  all around his space launch bases that he just so happened to put his bases at knowing
[1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:44.240]  he needs his own fuel in the future but if obama has his way those new permits will not
[1:07:44.240 --> 1:07:48.920]  be issued did you hear what i just had to say it's very simple so turning a light switch
[1:07:48.920 --> 1:07:54.520]  from on to off as soon as trump got in four plus years ago the stock market went straight
[1:07:54.520 --> 1:08:01.160]  up because america was open for business again as soon as biden got in all the futures have
[1:08:01.160 --> 1:08:06.040]  gone straight down because he said we're going to phase out a fossil fuels period even natural
[1:08:06.040 --> 1:08:12.040]  gas that is totally clean ladies and gentlemen with one signature president joe biden put
[1:08:12.040 --> 1:08:19.400]  the whole project in jeopardy 17 executive orders in action signed by president joe biden
[1:08:19.400 --> 1:08:25.200]  in his first few hours in office this represents an immediate loss of 10 000 union jobs pink
[1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:29.600]  slips will be going out unfortunately in the very near future and so they believe whatever
[1:08:29.600 --> 1:08:34.280]  the un says whatever bill gates says and whatever the environmental groups say are good because
[1:08:34.280 --> 1:08:38.800]  they believe they're actually saving the earth but they're not saving the earth they're only
[1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:43.800]  selectively cutting off the energy to europe and the united states spain is the most advanced
[1:08:43.800 --> 1:08:48.040]  in bringing in the shutdown of fossil fuels in the last decade and they're in an ongoing
[1:08:48.040 --> 1:08:53.240]  depression upwards of half their population is unemployed and their youth in some areas
[1:08:53.240 --> 1:08:58.100]  it's even worse this is the post industrial world where we're built off of fossil fuels
[1:08:58.100 --> 1:09:02.640]  were built off of industry and now they're taking it away but only in select areas in
[1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:07.720]  world war two when british and u.s. bombers began to retake europe the first thing it
[1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:14.120]  did was bomb oil refineries pipelines and power plants well day one joe biden hours
[1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:18.520]  ever been sworn in ever being installed as the presidential dictator by the communists
[1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:23.400]  chinese shut down the keystone pipeline that's already completed from canada down to poor
[1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:29.400]  arthur texas that was set to bring in it was about to be opened thirty million barrels
[1:09:29.400 --> 1:09:34.520]  of oil a day out of canada cementing the u.s. is the number one energy exporter in the
[1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:39.560]  world but instead that being shut down now bill gates and warren buffett along with soros
[1:09:39.560 --> 1:09:45.240]  own and control the railway that goes out to the west coast of canada where the giant
[1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:49.480]  chinese tankers will now load the oil and take it to china so literally this is like
[1:09:49.480 --> 1:09:55.400]  a giant game of risk but it's more sophisticated why did the saudi arabians fund all the anti
[1:09:55.400 --> 1:10:00.360]  fracking movements because they want to shut us down while they're open for business it's
[1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:06.000]  it's so transparent this is all again a military action against you and your family and people
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:10.680]  get convinced to root for their own destruction that is the purest form of mind control and
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:15.800]  brainwashing china's refusing to sign on to the paris accords so are other countries
[1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:20.760]  and so it's going to be impossible to develop anymore here you'll only go to invest there
[1:10:20.760 --> 1:10:26.440]  and that's why they call it the chinese communist century that's why ggp is celebrating helping
[1:10:26.440 --> 1:10:31.520]  get joe biden in through fraud because this is real military conquest now right over here
[1:10:31.520 --> 1:10:35.720]  there's a local hotel where we're hanging out here in america's you know beautiful
[1:10:35.720 --> 1:10:43.040]  mountains and it's a perfect allegory of what energy does and what plentiful cheap fossil
[1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:48.960]  fuel energy does versus not having so this is really a stranglehold on our energy supplies
[1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:53.080]  and incredibly destructive and incredibly dangerous and it'll cause a lot of people
[1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:56.440]  to lose their jobs become very very poor in the united states but that's part of the great
[1:10:56.440 --> 1:11:02.640]  reset the class problem and others want i think it's uh very important to know is that
[1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:11.000]  the covid-19 pandemics just has accelerated certain trends which we had seen before at
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:19.240]  which actually were discussed in davos this year like the lack of paying sufficient attention
[1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:27.200]  to the environment so what we will see now is the acceleration of those trends and of
[1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:36.120]  course a unique opportunity to reset our global agenda to do something about all those negative
[1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:42.960]  developments i include also the lack of international cooperation so you see leftist followers are
[1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:48.600]  really just useful idiots they are helping bring in total corporate discrimination or
[1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:55.160]  siege an act of war to cut off western europe the united states australia new zealand and
[1:11:55.160 --> 1:12:01.280]  canada's energy but then every other country and other every other major multinational
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:07.400]  corporation can still use energy with no restrictions or controls and the taxes off
[1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:13.280]  of what card more allowed to use are paid into private mercantile carbon trading systems
[1:12:13.280 --> 1:12:18.480]  literally owned by bill gates the Rothschilds the Rockefellers and others bill clinton allegor
[1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:23.360]  they're all huge investors and even own part of the company's large pieces so here's a
[1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:28.360]  great allegory we're out here in the freezing cold cheap plentiful natural gas allows this
[1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:34.360]  amazing fire for us to warm our hands just like the sun gives almost all of the energy
[1:12:34.360 --> 1:12:38.520]  to the earth we need for life to be sustainable so again if certain countries couldn't have
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:42.760]  the sun and other countries could have the sun would that be discriminatory well if certain
[1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:47.680]  countries can't have natural gas and oil and coal that's also very discriminatory so this
[1:12:47.680 --> 1:12:52.560]  is really an act of war and we've been convinced that oh it's for the earth oh fossil fuels
[1:12:52.560 --> 1:12:57.040]  are bad and it's just not true the very same big multinational corporations have been suppressing
[1:12:57.040 --> 1:13:03.280]  a lot of new systems of energy that are almost free and then you also see bill gates who's
[1:13:03.280 --> 1:13:07.440]  been involved with the mid 90s with geoengineering they've now declassified he's running a planetary
[1:13:07.440 --> 1:13:13.440]  program to practice blacking out the sun for certain countries again it's all about full
[1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:19.720]  spectrum dominance it's all about total energy control so we need energy we need the sun we
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:25.320]  need volcanic energy we need hydro thermal energy we need hydroelectric energy we need
[1:13:25.320 --> 1:13:30.320]  fossil fuel energy we can make take all these energies and make them extremely clean in
[1:13:30.320 --> 1:13:34.680]  fact they we've made them clean but now we're being told we can't have them at all this
[1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:38.520]  is dangerous this is war and it gives total power and control to the IMF the World Bank
[1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:43.360]  the UN and the Davos group that admit this is about a planetary takeover called the great
[1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:48.400]  reset which is really the great leap forward that Mao Zedong engaged in that David Rockefeller
[1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:52.560]  engineered and wrote articles about in the New York Times so again we have got to move
[1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:58.840]  against traders in Congress with the political truth and we have to support those in Congress
[1:13:58.840 --> 1:14:02.840]  that are actually exposing this before our main energy systems are shut down this is
[1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:05.880]  going to become very very apparent in the next few months as economy implodes because

[1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:22.200]  segments trump and conservative news remains an existential threat to this country but
[1:21:22.200 --> 1:21:26.280]  of course the irony is in the statement we're the ones that want to save the country we're
[1:21:26.280 --> 1:21:30.440]  the ones with the slogan make america great again we're the ones talking about the bill
[1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:35.080]  of rights we're the ones wanting to preserve the flag in our history they're the ones that
[1:21:35.080 --> 1:21:38.680]  burn the flag they're the ones that destroy our history they're the ones that say america
[1:21:38.680 --> 1:21:44.160]  is bad but then they say we're a threat to america we're a threat to the republic we
[1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:51.400]  are america we are the republic you are aliens in your nature in your human nature you are
[1:21:51.400 --> 1:22:01.560]  aliens to the idea of human freedom but notice the attacks against trump continue including
[1:22:01.560 --> 1:22:09.520]  the lies like in this story from vox fake news vox donald trump's presidency was the
[1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:14.960]  worst thing that happened to the trump brad and it talks about how bad his business has
[1:22:14.960 --> 1:22:19.800]  been since then and he can't sell the stuff that he normally sells and now the buildings
[1:22:19.800 --> 1:22:25.200]  where his name is up on it but that he doesn't own they want to take his name down and terminate
[1:22:25.200 --> 1:22:30.960]  his lease and all this other stuff and so and it's it's it's trump's presidency no it's
[1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:38.360]  your lies about trump it's your negative coverage of donald trump it's it's it's the total inversion
[1:22:38.360 --> 1:22:43.280]  of reality of what the trump presidency was but that's what they do they attack trump
[1:22:43.280 --> 1:22:47.600]  they lie about trump they demonize trump they lie about him some more they label them things
[1:22:47.600 --> 1:22:52.360]  that he isn't and then they say wow boy that trump was really bad wasn't he who now his
[1:22:52.360 --> 1:23:02.480]  brand suffers no you did that the death by a thousand cuts that's what they're doing
[1:23:02.480 --> 1:23:12.280]  to this country what they think they've done to donald trump here's another lie in fact
[1:23:12.280 --> 1:23:17.520]  i bet you the crew couldn't even find this if they tried i i briefly tried myself headline
[1:23:17.520 --> 1:23:23.120]  from the new york times joe biden watch geek in chief but there is a line in here that
[1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:32.360]  really had me rolling uh mr biden laid his hand on the family bible yeah give me a break
[1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:43.160]  what he thinks in that bible wearing a stainless steel rolex datejust with a blue dial a model
[1:23:43.160 --> 1:23:49.640]  that retails for more than seven thousand dollars and is a far cry from the everyman
[1:23:49.640 --> 1:23:59.320]  timepieces that every president not named trump has worn conspicuously in recent decades wait
[1:23:59.320 --> 1:24:06.800]  what so joe biden is an elitist where's a rolex i guess is what their side insinuating
[1:24:06.800 --> 1:24:11.320]  here but saying no he's doing it classily by the way i'll be honest i am kind of a
[1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:15.000]  bit of a watch guy not not the biggest watch guy you'll meet rolexes are actually some
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:20.200]  of the worst made watches constantly need repairs and they fall off your wrist they just fall
[1:24:20.200 --> 1:24:31.040]  off they just break and fall off not even kidding but so they say a far cry from the
[1:24:31.040 --> 1:24:37.800]  everyman timepieces that every president not named trump has worn so they're saying oh don't
[1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:41.400]  worry because it's all about biden's one of us like he's not an elitist no he's totally
[1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:45.800]  an elitist it's all he is an elitist so he wears a rolex hey that's fine i like me wearing
[1:24:45.800 --> 1:24:52.360]  expensive watches rolexes are nice watches like i said i'm a watch guy i have no problem
[1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:55.000]  with people wearing watches people want to make fun of you wearing watches no but it's
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:58.520]  see it's like when aoc had that expensive watch well she's a dirty commie so for her
[1:24:58.520 --> 1:25:02.400]  to wear an expensive watch she she pretends like she's not an elitist she is same thing
[1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:06.200]  goes for biden so they're trying to say oh don't worry about biden's rolex it's it's
[1:25:06.200 --> 1:25:12.640]  okay biden's rolex is okay trumps rolex is bad biden's rolex is good here's the catch
[1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:21.800]  again his seven thousand dollar rolex a far cry from the everyman timepieces that every
[1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:26.640]  president not named trump has worn ladies and gentlemen and i'll challenge the crew for
[1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:35.960]  this right now but with biden prize a fake chinese rolex anyway donald trump and president
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:43.200]  trump never wears watches he literally never wears watches guys go ahead do a google search
[1:25:43.200 --> 1:25:48.920]  sometimes he'll wear one if he's in his uh trump polo for golfing other than that the
[1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:53.240]  guy doesn't wear watches with his suits never wears watch you can go type in president trump
[1:25:53.240 --> 1:26:01.440]  don trump in his suit his classic navy suit tie uh sleeve cuffs cuff links never wears
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:05.840]  watch trump literally never wears watch i in fact i guarantee that i would bet the new york
[1:26:05.840 --> 1:26:11.600]  times can't even find a picture of trump while he was the president wearing a rolex unless
[1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:14.840]  they have such great zoom when they're spying on him on the golf course that maybe he was
[1:26:14.840 --> 1:26:21.880]  wearing one on the golf course but trump rarely wears watches so yeah there's where he wears
[1:26:21.880 --> 1:26:27.040]  watches on the golf course he likes to wear the watch with polo he rarely wears watches
[1:26:27.040 --> 1:26:33.920]  when he's when he's in his suit i'm not convinced by that i'm not really convinced by that could
[1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:40.040]  be it could be something else point is joe biden wears a rolex they're like oh don't
[1:26:40.040 --> 1:26:44.720]  worry he's not elitist he's not elitist oh no no no with his you know four or five properties
[1:26:44.720 --> 1:26:48.960]  taking tens of millions of dollars from foreign nations he's not elitist he can wear a rolex
[1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:53.560]  it's okay yeah there's a story recent presidents not named trump have tended to wear every man
[1:26:53.560 --> 1:26:59.720]  timepieces such as timex and shinola and trump just he never wears watches so it's just it's
[1:26:59.720 --> 1:27:05.520]  all a big lie but of course it shouldn't even matter they're successful men they want to
[1:27:05.520 --> 1:27:11.680]  wear a nice watch they wear a nice watch but see trump he's not allowed to wear a rolex
[1:27:11.680 --> 1:27:16.280]  he's an elitist if he's a wears a rolex demonize trump for wearing a rolex oh but biden wears
[1:27:16.280 --> 1:27:22.440]  a rolex they call him the watch geek in chief and they say oh biden's rolex good trump rolex
[1:27:22.440 --> 1:27:29.240]  bad so that's just the basic that's just the basic framework of the media's approach to
[1:27:29.240 --> 1:27:36.600]  anything trump or biden apparently what is trump out to and what is trump up to out in
[1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:42.200]  florida trump drafting enemies listed republicans for his patriot party to challenge in primaries
[1:27:42.200 --> 1:27:50.680]  sounds like a setup but that's what's being reported on the daily mail i don't believe
[1:27:50.680 --> 1:27:57.080]  this to you josh howley ted cruce the approval ratings dip in wake of capital riot do you
[1:27:57.080 --> 1:28:04.360]  believe that for a second i don't i don't believe any of these polls so polls are a
[1:28:04.360 --> 1:28:10.840]  big lie even our elections are a big lie social media numbers are a big lie tv ratings numbers
[1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:15.760]  are a big lie these people are manipulating everything now everything and so the only
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:21.600]  reality that you can trust in is what you see in front of your own eyes which is sad
[1:28:21.600 --> 1:28:26.480]  to say but that's kind of how it was meant to be anyway so it shouldn't be that big
[1:28:26.480 --> 1:28:32.200]  of a deal but of course it is when they're rigging all the numbers for biden 15 000 dislikes
[1:28:32.200 --> 1:28:36.040]  to a thousand likes and they just say nope those dislikes don't count take them down
[1:28:36.040 --> 1:28:40.840]  all the commonance on biden's instagram and youtube all saying hey you're a pedophile
[1:28:40.840 --> 1:28:45.360]  hey quit molesting kids hey quit taking money for china hey you lost the election youtube
[1:28:45.360 --> 1:28:51.360]  says nope and the comments nobody's allowed to comment you share any evidence of an election
[1:28:51.360 --> 1:28:54.880]  theft from 2020 oh you're banned you're not allowed to talk oh that's free speech though
[1:28:54.880 --> 1:28:58.960]  yeah real real tolerance the pope came out yesterday and announced a global government
[1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:04.640]  corporate alliance to redistribute wealth create a planetary universal income which of course
[1:29:04.640 --> 1:29:08.520]  the united nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone
[1:29:08.520 --> 1:29:14.240]  and finally a chip under your skin it's all now completely official part of the un great
[1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:19.440]  reset of the devils group and clout swab all officially written about it hundreds of books
[1:29:19.440 --> 1:29:24.720]  by swab and rocker feller foundation all the rest of them at 10 to 21 to 20 30 it's here
[1:29:24.720 --> 1:29:29.760]  and only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject
[1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:37.240]  it all and the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle the first evil and stopping
[1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:42.600]  abortion we must start valuing human life again we must start saying that we are not
[1:29:42.600 --> 1:29:49.160]  expendable that we are not disposable that we are essential until we do that we are all
[1:29:49.160 --> 1:29:58.520]  slaves we must stand up and declare our basic god-given human rights now three two one here

[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:35.480]  how you know Biden didn't win how you know the covid's fake master do anything just kind
[1:35:35.480 --> 1:35:40.120]  of hear this and it's like oh finally people are waking up you know took him a took him
[1:35:40.120 --> 1:35:44.040]  a while but hey they're they're waking up and they're they're nice people they're not
[1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:47.320]  you know loud or boisterous but they you know they want you to know so they kind of give
[1:35:47.320 --> 1:35:54.040]  it and I met this immigrant family from Vietnam they have a nineteen year old son and he was
[1:35:54.040 --> 1:35:59.880]  just cracking me up just ripping the liberal media and I mean first generation american
[1:35:59.880 --> 1:36:05.400]  he gets it but of course see the the the first generation immigrants actually get it whose
[1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:10.120]  parents came here through the legal method and who fled socialism and communism didn't
[1:36:10.120 --> 1:36:17.680]  come here for handouts they get it and they see the threat more than anybody sad though
[1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:22.080]  there is buyers remorse happening on the left though on the liberal progressive democrat
[1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:38.160]  side like uh lee una a union that campaign for biden and did marketing for biden on
[1:36:38.160 --> 1:36:44.240]  the internet saying he stands with us so we stand with him liuna for biden did all this
[1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:51.400]  promotion of him to get him over the hump and then uh ooh what's this from liuna pipeline
[1:36:51.400 --> 1:36:56.200]  construction has been a lifeline for many liuna members across the country the anticipated
[1:36:56.200 --> 1:37:01.840]  decision to cancel the keystone pipeline will kill thousands of good paying union jobs oops
[1:37:01.840 --> 1:37:22.720]  e ouch ooh that's that's your voters remorse face right there am i nailing it you want
[1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:29.160]  some more there's a little more here lauren wolf in fact there's more from this one uh
[1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:33.640]  former new york times writer now we'll get to that in a second yeah yeah we'll get to
[1:37:33.640 --> 1:37:39.720]  this guys hold on though it's hilarious this refrain of cancel culture as if it's actually
[1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:43.960]  anything the lauren wolf from the new york times oh there's no such thing as cancel culture
[1:37:43.960 --> 1:37:55.920]  what's this my friend and family lauren wolf was just fired by the new york times after
[1:37:55.920 --> 1:38:03.720]  she after they were pressured by fascists for what she said when she said she had chills
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:10.240]  after witnessing biden's landing on the 20th oops there's no such thing as cancel culture
[1:38:10.240 --> 1:38:19.680]  you're canceled how does that one taste voters remorse
[1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:26.160]  but pull up the site guys or the so there's a twitter account and there's websites now
[1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:32.360]  that are fully dedicated to the voters remorse that biden voters are going through right
[1:38:32.360 --> 1:38:39.400]  now guys put it put it biden voters posting their elves online at biden elves this thing
[1:38:39.400 --> 1:38:47.200]  has been active for less than a week guys i'm telling you it's the same thing i look
[1:38:47.200 --> 1:38:51.520]  i feel bad i shouldn't be laughing but it is kind of comical to see all these people
[1:38:51.520 --> 1:38:56.000]  that voted for biden that are now like he just i just lost my job because of biden he
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:04.640]  just stabbed all the unions in the back i've been canceled what is going on like you see
[1:39:04.640 --> 1:39:10.600]  i forget they really believe the mainstream media they really believe the mainstream
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:15.560]  media they really believe their own lies they really believe their own fantasy land and
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:23.680]  so it's it's it's odd behavior it's very childlike really to be shocked by this but but they
[1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:28.160]  they have been mentally retarded that's what it is it's it's it's arrested development
[1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:32.840]  i'm not talking about the tv show it's arrested development in that they can't develop their
[1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:39.520]  minds to live in reality they want to they still live in the fantasy la la land of Santa
[1:39:39.520 --> 1:39:44.480]  Claus comes down the chimney and puts presents under the tree of course that's ridiculous
[1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:49.720]  but but children believe in that it's an arrested development you don't have the developed mind
[1:39:49.720 --> 1:39:54.040]  so you just believe in it all the propaganda is around you so you just believe in that
[1:39:54.040 --> 1:39:59.440]  that's that's the modern day liberal leftist sadly that's the modern day democrat voter
[1:39:59.440 --> 1:40:04.560]  oh yeah biden stands with the unions biden's for free speech and then boob biden gets in
[1:40:04.560 --> 1:40:08.280]  half the people on the internet are canceled and he cuts all of our energy and gives it
[1:40:08.280 --> 1:40:15.520]  to china so voters are more for biden is only just beginning a little voters are more it
[1:40:15.520 --> 1:40:19.680]  should have been bernie but he didn't they stole it from bernie anyway but the story
[1:40:19.680 --> 1:40:25.760]  is that the federalist so the bernie sanders meme legendary viral it from the inauguration
[1:40:25.760 --> 1:40:30.040]  where you're sitting like this with the gloves everybody knows it right in the gloves well
[1:40:30.040 --> 1:40:37.040]  the woman story from the federalist the woman behind bernie sanders iconic mittens had
[1:40:37.040 --> 1:40:51.160]  to shut down her business because high taxes killed her small business oops her name is
[1:40:51.160 --> 1:40:57.080]  jen ellis she commented people have been contacting me thinking that they can get mittens and
[1:40:57.080 --> 1:41:02.840]  i actually they can't i don't have anymore and i did have much i didn't have much of
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:06.760]  a mitten business anymore because it really wasn't worth it independent crafters get really
[1:41:06.760 --> 1:41:11.160]  taken for a ride by the federal government we get taxed to the nth degree and it wasn't
[1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:15.640]  really worth it pursuing that as a business even as a side hustle exactly that's what
[1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:21.400]  taxes do that's the entire new world order in in a microcosm economy nutshell shut down
[1:41:21.400 --> 1:41:27.120]  the little guy that's why all the movie theaters are being shut down i mean look even an independent
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:31.200]  movie theater will air i mean we will probably fill all of its theaters with the mainstream
[1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:35.640]  media propaganda movies anyway but it's the notion that they could not it's the notion
[1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:38.720]  that they could air something else it's the notion they could air in a documentary from
[1:41:38.720 --> 1:41:41.840]  denesta susan it's the notion that they could air whatever they want so they have to shut
[1:41:41.840 --> 1:41:46.800]  down all the movie theaters that's happened because of covid same thing with the restaurant
[1:41:46.800 --> 1:41:50.920]  businesses why do they go after the restaurants it's the notion that a restaurant could feed
[1:41:50.920 --> 1:41:55.520]  you good food it's a notion that a restaurant will feed you a big juicy steak but see they
[1:41:55.520 --> 1:42:00.200]  want total corporate control of all the restaurants so eventually you don't get me you can eat
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:12.480]  like a bug nugget or a veggie burger and that's what they're now doing and by the way right
[1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:21.520]  on time right on tickety time twitter suspends antifa accounts with more than seventy one
[1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:27.000]  thousand followers so now they're going after antifa they're arresting the antifa that destroyed
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:31.980]  the democrat headquarters in portland and now they're banning all the twitter accounts
[1:42:31.980 --> 1:42:36.480]  that antifa has been allowed to have for four years or whatever been using to organize so
[1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:42.880]  now they're coming after you we told you it was coming you called us fascist we warned

[1:47:41.280 --> 1:47:57.200]  shortly but first the latest report from paul joseph watson
[1:47:57.200 --> 1:48:11.440]  there have been over 14 000 covid deaths since joe biden took office on wednesday and biden is
[1:48:11.440 --> 1:48:17.440]  personally responsible for every single one of them hey you made the rules not me 200 000 dead
[1:48:17.440 --> 1:48:22.240]  as you said over seven million infected in the united states but is what it is because you or who
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:27.520]  you are that's why it is but just be thankful that we're in the safe hands of biden's new
[1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:32.080]  assistant health secretary the individual who pulled her own mother out of a nursing home
[1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:38.000]  after issuing a statewide order forcing them to accept covid patients it's okay when we do it her
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:43.600]  department also issued guidance to ensure the continuation of the crucial activity of covid
[1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:49.040]  safe orgies personally i'd be totally comfortable being at the mercy of this salubrious trio
[1:48:49.040 --> 1:48:56.080]  trump supporters disgracefully rioted on the very night of the inauguration oh my bad that was blm
[1:48:56.080 --> 1:49:02.240]  and antifa again not only was trump blamed for his own supporters storming the capital he was also
[1:49:02.240 --> 1:49:07.680]  blamed for seven months worth of blm and antifas mostly peaceful riots so now they're rioting
[1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:14.160]  under a biden administration who should take the blame for that come on man what happened in dc
[1:49:14.160 --> 1:49:18.960]  last night was horrible these terrorists broke into the capital and were being violent towards these
[1:49:18.960 --> 1:49:24.560]  poor police officers all cops are bastards it's okay when we do it but hey at least they only
[1:49:24.560 --> 1:49:30.320]  smashed up police stations and set fire to buildings the precious historical books of women in politics
[1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:35.760]  remained untouched joe biden signed an executive order to mandate mask wearing on federal property
[1:49:35.760 --> 1:49:41.600]  but you know who's apparently exempt from that rule joe biden and his entire family it's okay
[1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:48.560]  when we do it well still at least the same media that hyperventilated whenever trump failed to
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:53.760]  wear a mask was hot on the story no way a single question was asked by a fox news reporter and he
[1:49:53.760 --> 1:49:59.760]  was immediately brushed off why weren't president biden and all members of the biden family masked
[1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:05.360]  at all times on federal lands last night if he signed an executive order that mandates masks on
[1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:10.560]  federal lands at all times i think we have bigger issues to to worry about at this moment in time
[1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:16.240]  legacy media also had far more pressing issues to pursue like the color of biden dereplain
[1:50:16.800 --> 1:50:22.080]  will he keep donald trump's air force one color scheme changed this is such a good question the
[1:50:22.080 --> 1:50:28.480]  cnn covid death toll tracker was also mysteriously disappeared i think we have big bigger issues to
[1:50:28.480 --> 1:50:34.160]  to worry about bigger issues like welcoming our new deal leader those lights that are that are
[1:50:34.160 --> 1:50:39.600]  just shooting out from the lincoln memorial along the reflecting pool i look it's like almost
[1:50:39.600 --> 1:50:47.360]  uh extensions of joe biden's arms embracing america joe buying today certainly he was commander in
[1:50:47.360 --> 1:51:10.480]  shape it was also papper in chief
[1:51:10.480 --> 1:51:21.440]  today's inauguration felt more like a church service like a priest explaining
[1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:26.000]  something from the bible like after a good sermon the congregation didn't want to go home
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:30.960]  and the sun started shining during his ceremony wolf he is the better angel president
[1:51:30.960 --> 1:51:41.280]  jesus christ jesus christ who are you what can you sacrifice the most popular president in u.s history
[1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:56.080]  thank you it's from my district
[1:51:56.080 --> 1:52:04.880]  the odds are not in your favor and while they tell us to put our masks on both literally and
[1:52:04.880 --> 1:52:10.640]  metaphorically there's come off the world is about to be reminded that the military industrial
[1:52:10.640 --> 1:52:15.840]  complex for whom joe biden is a puppet is infinitely more dangerous than donald trump's
[1:52:15.840 --> 1:52:21.120]  offensive tweets president biden is considering reversing trump's drawdown in iraq by adding
[1:52:21.120 --> 1:52:26.240]  thousands of troops to combat growing terror threats in the region wow it took the resistance
[1:52:26.240 --> 1:52:31.120]  president all of 24 hours to turn the war machine back on we're sorry for that four-year
[1:52:31.120 --> 1:52:36.160]  interruption and now back to our regularly scheduled programming finally a return to normal
[1:52:36.160 --> 1:52:41.360]  see biden may be about to return american foreign policy to the obama days of catastrophic
[1:52:41.360 --> 1:52:46.400]  interventionism harming jihadist toppling secular leaders empowering islamists and causing
[1:52:46.400 --> 1:52:51.680]  international migrant crises middle east 2021 to 2025 but hey at least if you want to complain
[1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:56.800]  about any of that the white house website will guarantee to record your proper pronouns president
[1:52:56.800 --> 1:53:01.600]  biden has removed the diet coke button when i interviewed donald trump in 2019 we became
[1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:06.240]  fascinated by what the little red button did eventually trump pressed it and a butler swiftly
[1:53:06.240 --> 1:53:11.200]  brought in a diet coke on a silver platter it's gone now yeah you're sure it just hasn't been
[1:53:11.200 --> 1:53:15.520]  repurposed toward the drone strikes on middle eastern wedding parties i am especially proud
[1:53:15.520 --> 1:53:31.440]  to be the first president in decades who has started no new wars
[1:53:33.440 --> 1:53:40.000]  now that trump's gone the real authentic grassroots resistance is back to save america
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:50.400]  the bowing company goldman sacks and bank of america
[1:53:54.400 --> 1:53:59.920]  yay four years of bombing kids in the middle east while hollowing out america's economy for
[1:53:59.920 --> 1:54:04.400]  the benefit of weapons contractors wall street and predatory transnational corporations
[1:54:04.400 --> 1:54:12.240]  all hailed the resistance just a hunch but if your political consensus is shared and
[1:54:12.240 --> 1:54:17.920]  amplified by every major cultural institution establishment media empire and billionaire
[1:54:17.920 --> 1:54:26.400]  tech oligarch in the world maybe just maybe call me crazy but maybe maybe you're not the
[1:54:26.400 --> 1:54:31.360]  resistance just a hunch but with orange man bat having lived rent free in their heads for the
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:44.000]  past five years some leftists are struggling from withdrawal symptoms trump isn't even aware of your
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:49.520]  existence but yeah you've totally owned him by having a badly drawn dick permanently ingrained
[1:54:49.520 --> 1:54:54.960]  on your body for life this leftist celebrates a biden's victory by defying his dying trump
[1:54:54.960 --> 1:55:00.560]  supporting father's wishes to be buried by having him cremated dumping his ashes in the garbage
[1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:06.560]  then bragging about it on reddit for dopamine and social media clout hands are we the baddies
[1:55:06.560 --> 1:55:12.000]  can't be said enough we topple the dictator because as everybody knows the only way to
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:16.800]  topple a dictator is to vote him out of office in a democratic election how white liberals
[1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:24.000]  think fascism works you're finished no please no more waking up at 3 a.m full of existential dread
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:29.120]  tonight we sleep like we used to when we were five and we fell asleep in the backseat of the car
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:36.720]  knowing that dad was in charge and nothing bad could happen good night america yeah dad's in charge
[1:55:36.720 --> 1:55:42.240]  now come on man at least biden's admitting like i said earlier that they're in arrest and development
[1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:47.440]  they're all like little children the vast majority of whom continue to hold the creation of an nkvd
[1:55:47.440 --> 1:55:51.920]  style secret police to treat trump supporters like domestic terrorists have them removed from
[1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:56.720]  society and thrown into reeducation camps radical extreme conservatives also known as
[1:55:56.720 --> 1:56:03.680]  domestic terrorists so much healing so much unity quick question joe but how can there be
[1:56:03.680 --> 1:56:08.960]  unity and healing when many of your supporters want to literally expunge tens of millions of
[1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:17.680]  americans from society but if leftist has stormed the capital you'd support him yes they are fighting
[1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:22.800]  for a good cause fascists are fighting for a very bad cause this should not be difficult it's okay
[1:56:22.800 --> 1:56:28.240]  when we do it after it was revealed that the capital riot was almost entirely planned on facebook
[1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:32.880]  and twitter both were banned from the app store had their servers pulled and were completely wiped
[1:56:32.880 --> 1:56:37.840]  off the internet oh no that was parlor it's okay when we do it trump himself went out on a whimper
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:42.400]  announcing a pardon list that was the most depressing since shinlers julian assange and
[1:56:42.400 --> 1:56:48.080]  edward snowden were told to go whistle while a bunch of criminal rappers were set free including a
[1:56:48.080 --> 1:56:53.040]  mate of snoop dog who lobbied for the pardon of drug kingpin michael harry o harris snoop dog
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:59.840]  being the guy who literally simulated assassinating trump in a 2017 video you know what i think i'm
[1:56:59.840 --> 1:57:05.680]  finally tired of winning there are a lot of people that want us to take action against facebook and
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:12.880]  against twitter and frankly against amazon yep amazon also a lot of people want us to take action
[1:57:12.880 --> 1:57:19.760]  are you going to i can't say that i can't say
