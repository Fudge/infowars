[06:03.360 --> 06:30.360]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:30.360 --> 06:41.360]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[06:41.360 --> 06:54.360]  Going down the flames, move! Get out the way! Move, bitch! Get out the way! Get out the way! Move, bitch! Get out the way!
[06:54.360 --> 07:01.360]  Go hosting today with me is Madam President.
[07:01.360 --> 07:12.360]  Woo!
[07:12.360 --> 07:23.360]  Alright, we are live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide, and it is just an orgy of globalists falling apart and following on their disgusting snouts.
[07:23.360 --> 07:35.360]  It is just amazing to see victory after victory after victory after victory after victory after victory after victory after victory after victory after victory after victory after victory.
[07:35.360 --> 07:42.360]  America's back! Get out the way! Get out the way! Get out the way!
[07:42.360 --> 07:49.360]  That was our theme song for Hillary's fall and her destruction at the hands of the truth.
[07:49.360 --> 07:56.360]  And it is the first annual People's Choice Fake News Awards today.
[07:56.360 --> 08:01.360]  I told you we were going to do this seven days ago. So much has been happening. It snuck up on me.
[08:01.360 --> 08:05.360]  I was sitting there getting ready for the show, looking at all the headlines. I went, wait a minute.
[08:05.360 --> 08:10.360]  I said we were going to have the People's Choice Fake News Awards.
[08:10.360 --> 08:17.360]  I've already beta tested it and kind of had some of the talk show hosts around here have done their own little talk show, you know, Info Wars Fake News Awards.
[08:17.360 --> 08:30.360]  But then it hit me seven days ago when the president moved back his fake news extravaganza when he, the president, will pick who he believes are the top winners that get the Oscars of deception
[08:30.360 --> 08:38.360]  and fake news as we strike back against the globalists and the disinformation, operations to their total horror.
[08:38.360 --> 08:48.360]  But then it hit me. We're going to have the People's Choice Fake News Awards. You're going to be able to call in.
[08:48.360 --> 08:53.360]  You're going to be able to tweet at Real Alex Jones. We're going to have Paul Watson riding shotgun with us.
[08:53.360 --> 08:56.360]  We're going to have Owen Shroyer. We're going to have Rob Dew. We're going to have Roger Stone.
[08:56.360 --> 09:08.360]  We're going to have everybody putting in their two cents on the top 10 fake news stories of 2017, the People's Choice.
[09:08.360 --> 09:14.360]  And then at four o'clock central in the middle of the war room with myself, Owen Shroyer and Roger Stone and others.
[09:14.360 --> 09:17.360]  This is Alex Jones right here live. This is Info Wars Live.
[09:17.360 --> 09:27.360]  Doing this broadcast at this same time slot for 20 years now, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. But we've launched the Real News of David Knight doing a great job in the morning at 8 a.m.
[09:27.360 --> 09:35.360]  And we've got the war room with Owen and everybody at three o'clock central. Our goal is to go at least 20 hours live a day by the end of 2018.
[09:35.360 --> 09:39.360]  So we're busy little beavers, as you can see.
[09:39.360 --> 09:54.360]  But if you go to infowars.com, deep state in panic tries to drop fusion GPS out of the news as it becomes apparent that it is a total fake.
[09:54.360 --> 10:07.360]  Global survey finds nuclear war cyber threats among top concerns and the big one conspiracy theorist CNN refuses to believe bipartisan doctor of four presidents who said Trump is physically fit.
[10:07.360 --> 10:12.360]  15 pounds overweight has the heart of like a 40 year old.
[10:12.360 --> 10:20.360]  He said that's what's really phenomenal and that he has yet a perfect 30 out of 30 on the cognitive tests.
[10:20.360 --> 10:27.360]  And if you don't pay absolute total focused attention on that particular lengthy test, they didn't give him a short one.
[10:27.360 --> 10:30.360]  You will lose a couple points.
[10:30.360 --> 10:36.360]  He got it perfect, which showed total complete focus.
[10:36.360 --> 10:40.360]  So, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be breaking all of that down.
[10:40.360 --> 10:49.360]  But this is the day it is here, ladies and gentlemen, it is unfolding.
[10:49.360 --> 10:51.360]  Now, I see an article on infowars.com.
[10:51.360 --> 10:55.360]  I'm not disagreeing with my great crew, but I don't oversee and hot show everything.
[10:55.360 --> 10:59.360]  And I remember Trump saying there ought to be fake news awards.
[10:59.360 --> 11:05.360]  And then I remember we did fake news awards, but I really think it's Trump's idea.
[11:05.360 --> 11:08.360]  That's November 27, 2017.
[11:08.360 --> 11:10.360]  Then let's see when we first called for it.
[11:10.360 --> 11:11.360]  Not that it matters.
[11:11.360 --> 11:15.360]  I just see that on infowars and I'm like, huh?
[11:15.360 --> 11:18.360]  And there are the guys doing the fake news awards.
[11:18.360 --> 11:20.360]  Let's see when they did it.
[11:20.360 --> 11:24.360]  Let's see the date on that.
[11:24.360 --> 11:28.360]  Oh, that's the that's a live feed right now.
[11:28.360 --> 11:34.360]  So we're going to hit the bottom of it, but it doesn't matter, ladies and gentlemen, because we're going to be taking your phone calls.
[11:34.360 --> 11:47.360]  Here today, we're going to be hearing what your main nominations are for the worst, most out of control, egregious disinformation from mainstream media.
[11:47.360 --> 11:50.360]  And I really don't know what number one should be.
[11:50.360 --> 12:03.360]  Maybe the fake polls of 2017 that Trump was 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 points behind CNN had some phone polls where Hillary was winning by 68%.
[12:03.360 --> 12:07.360]  And they were over sampling Democrats by 30 plus percent.
[12:07.360 --> 12:09.360]  Remember that in their methodology.
[12:09.360 --> 12:17.360]  I think fake polls in 2017 are right back into 16.
[12:17.360 --> 12:23.360]  I think the New York Times saying that Hillary Clinton had more than a 99% chance.
[12:23.360 --> 12:25.360]  Remember the New York Times?
[12:25.360 --> 12:31.360]  The New York Times said that she had a first 99% chance with her computer algorithm by election day.
[12:31.360 --> 12:34.360]  It was 96%.
[12:34.360 --> 12:35.360]  There it is.
[12:35.360 --> 12:40.360]  Hillary has an 85% chance to win on and on and on and on.
[12:40.360 --> 12:42.360]  And that was on election day.
[12:42.360 --> 12:44.360]  Ridiculous.
[12:44.360 --> 12:47.360]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[12:47.360 --> 12:50.360]  But you're going to say, well, that's 2016.
[12:50.360 --> 13:00.360]  I think there's overlap here in the first annual 2017 fake news awards because the fact that they claim she really won and that he stole the election when the evidence was.
[13:00.360 --> 13:05.360]  She stole at least six states, according to Homeland Security, the state level.
[13:05.360 --> 13:09.360]  And they had millions of people voting in the names of dead people.
[13:09.360 --> 13:13.360]  That's all been confirmed by Harvard studies worse than what the president said.
[13:13.360 --> 13:19.360]  It was fake news when they came out and said that the president was wrong, that no illegals and no dead people voted.
[13:19.360 --> 13:23.360]  Well, technically no dead people voted, but people voted on the voter rolls, the names of dead people.
[13:23.360 --> 13:24.360]  That's another big fake news story.
[13:24.360 --> 13:26.360]  What about General Flynn?
[13:26.360 --> 13:31.360]  General Flynn, a couple of months ago, supposedly said, I'm a Russian agent.
[13:31.360 --> 13:39.360]  The Russians ran the campaign and you had the video of the view and everybody just in ecstasy.
[13:39.360 --> 13:40.360]  Joy Bayhart.
[13:40.360 --> 13:43.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got breaking news.
[13:43.360 --> 13:44.360]  Oh my gosh.
[13:44.360 --> 13:46.360]  Flynn is going to testify.
[13:46.360 --> 13:48.360]  He wears a fur Russian hat.
[13:48.360 --> 13:51.360]  His mother was Vi Lenin.
[13:51.360 --> 13:55.360]  Trump is born in Russia and is a secret KGB agent.
[13:55.360 --> 14:01.360]  And they admit that they lied to the FBI and they're all going down.
[14:01.360 --> 14:03.360]  It's all over.
[14:03.360 --> 14:10.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, so that's in the running.
[14:10.360 --> 14:12.360]  And then it just goes on and on.
[14:12.360 --> 14:22.360]  17 agencies unanimously have put on down that Donald Trump works for the Russians and they hacked into the elections and they stole the election.
[14:22.360 --> 14:30.360]  Well, it's 15 agencies, it's 12 agencies, it's nine agencies, it's six agencies, it's three agencies, it's one agency, it's no agency.
[14:30.360 --> 14:34.360]  It was three guys that have worked in four agencies.
[14:34.360 --> 14:48.360]  They went up on TV and said, unanimously, all 17 agencies say that Trump is guilty, guilty, guilty.
[14:48.360 --> 14:51.360]  So there you go.
[14:51.360 --> 14:57.360]  And he was the bad guy saying 17 agencies didn't say it because he was already president-elect and talked to them.
[14:57.360 --> 14:59.360]  And they said, sir, we never said this.
[14:59.360 --> 15:00.360]  This is malarkey.
[15:00.360 --> 15:01.360]  Where's the report?
[15:01.360 --> 15:02.360]  Trump said there is no report.
[15:02.360 --> 15:07.360]  Oh, the fake news that the media said that Trump was wrong, that Comey was the leaker.
[15:07.360 --> 15:10.360]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[15:10.360 --> 15:11.360]  Absolutely.
[15:11.360 --> 15:15.360]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[15:15.360 --> 15:16.360]  Absolutely.
[15:16.360 --> 15:26.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, always love those little surprises, but that's going to be part of the incredible extravaganza today of surprises here live on the air, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:26.360 --> 15:34.360]  So I'm very excited whether you're listening on local radio or whether you are watching on the internet at infowars.com forward slash show.

[18:02.360 --> 18:09.360]  I'm also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[18:09.360 --> 18:13.360]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[18:13.360 --> 18:16.360]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[18:16.360 --> 18:21.360]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[18:35.360 --> 18:42.360]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[20:24.360 --> 20:27.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:48.360 --> 20:52.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, when you get excited about the broadcast,
[20:52.360 --> 20:57.360]  when you take action, when you spread the word, when you spread the articles, the live links, the live transmission,
[20:57.360 --> 21:02.360]  when you tell people about the local AM and FM stations and TV stations and cable stations
[21:02.360 --> 21:08.360]  that are picking up the radio slash TV simulcast of the rebirth of the Second American Revolution,
[21:08.360 --> 21:10.360]  you change the world.
[21:10.360 --> 21:15.360]  We have beaten Google, we have beaten Facebook, we have beaten Twitter, we have defeated their algorithms,
[21:15.360 --> 21:23.360]  we have defeated them saying Hillary was a 99% chance she was going to win until Election Day and then they, you know, drop it down to 85%.
[21:23.360 --> 21:26.360]  It's all fraud. It's all the perception.
[21:26.360 --> 21:31.360]  Well, guess what? We're taking the narrative back. They want to call real news, fake news.
[21:31.360 --> 21:42.360]  Now they beg us not to use that term. Well, this is the People's Choice InfoWars first annual fake news awards
[21:42.360 --> 21:50.360]  that is preceding the President's Choice fake news awards at four o'clock central.
[21:50.360 --> 22:00.360]  We're going to be tearing it live with analysis and more infowars.com forward slash show.
[22:00.360 --> 22:11.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, and we've got live feeds on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and newswars.com
[22:11.360 --> 22:21.360]  where you can go get the news article that we have that says right there, watch the first annual People's Choice fake news awards
[22:21.360 --> 22:32.360]  preceded by President Trump's fake news awards at four o'clock today airing at infowars.com
[22:32.360 --> 22:37.360]  and if you get that link out to everybody or if you tell local stations that are carrying the war room,
[22:37.360 --> 22:43.360]  people can tune in and hear it and this is so important because it absolutely infuriates the globalist.
[22:43.360 --> 22:48.360]  They can't stand it when we organize against them. They can't stand it when we organize them award shows
[22:48.360 --> 22:52.360]  and make fun of them how Hollywood has their own stupid award shows and they all worship each other.
[22:52.360 --> 22:59.360]  It's a joke. I don't like any award shows, but I like award shows where we roast them for their fraud,
[22:59.360 --> 23:02.360]  for their deceit, for their garbage.
[23:02.360 --> 23:11.360]  What's one of the big 2017 lies that President Trump is mentally deficient, that President Trump is in bad health,
[23:11.360 --> 23:16.360]  that President Trump has early onset of Alzheimer's and dementia.
[23:16.360 --> 23:27.360]  Well, a doctor that's worked for four different presidents and been the direct physician for three has come out, Ron Jackson,
[23:27.360 --> 23:32.360]  and said his heart is what's incredible. His brain is great as well.
[23:32.360 --> 23:40.360]  He got a 30 out of 30 on an in-depth psychological cognitive exam and we did the heart test and the stress test
[23:40.360 --> 23:46.360]  and the president went in for days to, you know, off and on to be able to do all of these tests
[23:46.360 --> 23:52.360]  and now they brought out the information you can look at him climbing over hills and nobody else says
[23:52.360 --> 23:58.360]  bear crawling up hills when he's playing golf.
[23:58.360 --> 24:03.360]  It just goes on and on and on.
[24:03.360 --> 24:08.360]  We're going to play some of those clips coming up a little bit later in the transmission.
[24:08.360 --> 24:14.360]  There's so much news up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[24:14.360 --> 24:22.360]  Nobel Prize winner Trump has launched a nationalist revolution against the elite.
[24:22.360 --> 24:30.360]  And more and more true intellectuals, more and more true historians have to admit the truth.
[24:30.360 --> 24:33.360]  Davos Globalists seek to derail populist uprising.
[24:33.360 --> 24:42.360]  Nobel Prize winning economist and globalist Robert Schiller says that President Trump has launched a national revolution against the elite.
[24:42.360 --> 24:48.360]  And is he a good guy? No, but at least he's honest about the fact that we are defeating them.
[24:48.360 --> 24:51.360]  And now Trump's going to go to Davos.
[24:51.360 --> 24:56.360]  I was saying we're going to send some reporters and I'm trying to get Paul to go, but a lot of this stuff isn't even in the budget here,
[24:56.360 --> 25:00.360]  ladies and gentlemen, because it's so expensive to run this operation.
[25:00.360 --> 25:02.360]  So let's get this started.
[25:02.360 --> 25:06.360]  I've cleared the decks of guests today because I want to take your phone calls.
[25:06.360 --> 25:11.360]  I want to hear what fake news stories of really the last year and a half.
[25:11.360 --> 25:14.360]  This first annual has been such an epic companion of time.
[25:14.360 --> 25:20.360]  And they've taken all the old lies and regurgitated them into 2017 and 2018, the last year and a half.
[25:20.360 --> 25:24.360]  So we can go back into the election 2016 as well.
[25:24.360 --> 25:26.360]  I think that's all fair game.
[25:26.360 --> 25:34.360]  The toll-free number to join us is 877789 Alex, 8777892539.
[25:34.360 --> 25:38.360]  Just specifically what the story was, what they did.
[25:38.360 --> 25:41.360]  We can search the engine, we can pull it up.
[25:41.360 --> 25:43.360]  Every nomination, guys, try to print it for me.
[25:43.360 --> 25:51.360]  Every nomination, like I've done the nomination, I'm saying, look, Hillary, Madam President, 200,000 plus copies already printed by Newsweek.
[25:51.360 --> 25:58.360]  They have fake photos in here of her accepting the night, her acceptance speech, her victory speech, how it all happened, all completely fake.
[25:58.360 --> 26:00.360]  This is how stupid they think you are.
[26:00.360 --> 26:03.360]  They did not pre-print up Mr. President's deals.
[26:03.360 --> 26:09.360]  The fake polls that they admittedly added 10, 15, 20, 30 plus points to it, depending on a poll, saying Trump would lose.
[26:09.360 --> 26:11.360]  That's a big nomination.
[26:11.360 --> 26:15.360]  The media saying illegal aliens and others weren't voting in the names of dead people.
[26:15.360 --> 26:23.360]  That's been totally confirmed by Harvard, Mason-Dixon University, George Washington University, Wall Street Journal studies, and much more.
[26:23.360 --> 26:27.360]  There's just been so much fake news.
[26:27.360 --> 26:33.360]  Russia Gate in general, but specifically Flynn confessing he's a Russian agent and Trump's a Russian agent, total hoax.
[26:33.360 --> 26:39.360]  All 17 agencies saying, President, is a Russian agent or that the Russians stole the election.
[26:39.360 --> 26:41.360]  That's a total hoax.
[26:41.360 --> 26:53.360]  The Piscate dossier isn't just criminal, in my view, $2 million from the FBI to family members and Justice Department family members to create it.
[26:53.360 --> 27:01.360]  But the fact that they all colluded in the text messages and emails as an insurance policy to stop the president and to remove him from office.
[27:01.360 --> 27:02.360]  That's incredible.
[27:02.360 --> 27:06.360]  The fake news defending the FBI at the top, defending Comey.
[27:06.360 --> 27:11.360]  The fake news saying that Hillary didn't do anything illegal with her server.
[27:11.360 --> 27:14.360]  The fake news saying Uranium One wasn't a big issue.
[27:14.360 --> 27:17.360]  We could go on for days.
[27:17.360 --> 27:21.360]  But there's so many angles, so many pieces of fake news.
[27:21.360 --> 27:23.360]  So many areas to get into.
[27:23.360 --> 27:25.360]  What are your nominations?
[27:25.360 --> 27:28.360]  The People's Choice 2017.
[27:28.360 --> 27:30.360]  Of course, it's 2018 right now.
[27:30.360 --> 27:32.360]  We are just days away.
[27:32.360 --> 27:36.360]  We are now two and a half days away from 365 days.
[27:36.360 --> 27:40.360]  One standard Earth orbit around the sun.
[27:40.360 --> 27:44.360]  The planet itself rotated 365 days.
[27:44.360 --> 27:48.360]  We are, we are a few days away from one year.
[27:48.360 --> 27:59.360]  And if you look at Infowars.com and if you look at DrudgeReport.com with what's happening with the economy, every day it just gets more and more insane.
[27:59.360 --> 28:03.360]  Manufacturing output rising further than the previous record.
[28:03.360 --> 28:07.360]  Stock market optimism hits the highs in 32 years of up 26,000.
[28:07.360 --> 28:12.360]  A year in post-Trump town in America, Flake speaks to nearly empty chamber.
[28:12.360 --> 28:15.360]  We've got that clip coming up when we come back.
[28:15.360 --> 28:23.360]  Flake saying that Trump's like Stalin to challenge the media and say they're lying when they lie.
[28:23.360 --> 28:27.360]  So defending yourself free speech is now Stalin cracking down on the press.
[28:27.360 --> 28:30.360]  Know what Hillary and Obama and the globalists tried to do?
[28:30.360 --> 28:32.360]  Say they wanted to shut down DrudgeReport Infowars.
[28:32.360 --> 28:36.360]  That, ladies and gentlemen, in congressional hearings is what Stalin would do.
[28:36.360 --> 28:40.360]  Calling Trump Hitler when he has nothing to do with Nazis is what Stalin would do.
[28:40.360 --> 28:42.360]  Saying he's mentally ill is what Stalin would do.
[28:42.360 --> 28:47.360]  That's all Soviet tactic, GRU tactic.
[28:47.360 --> 28:53.360]  Globalist beatnik tactics that we infected Russia with that's still here in America.
[28:53.360 --> 28:56.360]  I'm Alex Jones, Infowars.com. Stay with us.
[28:58.360 --> 29:00.360]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[29:00.360 --> 29:02.360]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[29:05.360 --> 29:07.360]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[29:07.360 --> 29:11.360]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[32:34.360 --> 32:39.360]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.

[33:20.360 --> 33:33.360]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:33.360 --> 33:37.360]  Now, right now, over 200 AM and FM radio stations are picking up the broadcast.
[33:37.360 --> 33:40.360]  Dozens of UHF, VHF stations and cable systems.
[33:40.360 --> 33:43.360]  This is Infowars Live with your host Alex Jones.
[33:43.360 --> 33:52.360]  But we are hosting, and we're kicking off right now, the first annual People's Choice Fake News Awards for 2017.
[33:52.360 --> 33:58.360]  Just like they have a lot of times, you know, on TV, the People's Choice ahead of the Grammys, the Emmys, the Oscars.
[33:58.360 --> 34:06.360]  We're having the People's Choice ahead of the big event at 4 o'clock central that we're going to carry live, uncensored, unedited.
[34:06.360 --> 34:10.360]  Because you know Main Street Media is going to only carry pieces of it and carry it out of context.
[34:10.360 --> 34:13.360]  We're going to carry it live, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:13.360 --> 34:17.360]  In fact, I think it's so important we're going to let our local radio stations know.
[34:17.360 --> 34:21.360]  A lot of them are going to want to do this to pick up the war room.
[34:21.360 --> 34:26.360]  In the second and third hour of the war room, we're going commercial-free.
[34:26.360 --> 34:32.360]  When the president is up there giving this incredible award, it's so important to destroy the Main Street Media,
[34:32.360 --> 34:36.360]  to expose them, to ridicule them, to show their fraud, to show their lies,
[34:36.360 --> 34:42.360]  to get back that we're going commercial-free in the second and third hour of the war room today.
[34:42.360 --> 34:47.360]  Our stations are absolutely welcome to roll their ads over us if they need to do that.
[34:47.360 --> 34:51.360]  But things that are really important, occasionally, every once in a while,
[34:51.360 --> 34:55.360]  I haven't skipped any breaks, what, four or five months, since we changed the new clock.
[34:55.360 --> 34:59.360]  But we're not going to do it during my broadcast today, but when the president goes on,
[34:59.360 --> 35:02.360]  and his awards may be 30 minutes, they may be an hour. The award is they're going to be an hour.
[35:02.360 --> 35:08.360]  We are going to be commercial-free as to not have any of our affiliates miss any of this,
[35:08.360 --> 35:12.360]  because these affiliates are the real news. They're standing up for what's right.
[35:12.360 --> 35:16.360]  They're standing up. They're the reason you've got a record stock market,
[35:16.360 --> 35:20.360]  and record low black unemployment, and record low white unemployment, Hispanic unemployment.
[35:20.360 --> 35:23.360]  But the black unemployment is incredibly low now, lowest ever.
[35:23.360 --> 35:27.360]  The reason you've got all this exuberance, the reason you've got 2,000 new factories,
[35:27.360 --> 35:32.360]  and 2 million new jobs, and 400 billion new investment, it was 200 billion a few months ago,
[35:32.360 --> 35:37.360]  it's the reason the country's coming roaring back, roaring back, roaring back,
[35:37.360 --> 35:45.360]  because there was a boot on our neck. Globalism artificially had chained us down.
[35:45.360 --> 35:49.360]  Trump knew this. A five-year-old would know this as well.
[35:49.360 --> 35:53.360]  And I'm not saying he's a five-year-old, Bernie Sanders.
[35:53.360 --> 36:03.360]  He wants to cut the taxes from 40% to 15% on the corporations that make trillions of dollars.
[36:03.360 --> 36:07.360]  Not one of those big corporations supported Trump.
[36:07.360 --> 36:15.360]  They all wrote the laws to have the taxes be prohibitive here to move overseas
[36:15.360 --> 36:19.360]  as a program to deindustrialize us, to bring us to heal.
[36:19.360 --> 36:23.360]  Like Hillary said, black people and predators bring them to heal like a dog.
[36:23.360 --> 36:28.360]  The globalist writings, all they talk about is bringing America under their control.
[36:28.360 --> 36:33.360]  And that means getting rid of the farms, the ranches, getting rid of the small machine shops,
[36:33.360 --> 36:39.360]  getting rid of the tinkers, getting rid of your local control, getting rid of the factories,
[36:39.360 --> 36:42.360]  getting rid of the industry, getting rid of real education,
[36:42.360 --> 36:48.360]  taking full control of education, of medicine, of housing, of food, and you've got slaves.
[36:48.360 --> 36:57.360]  That's another big, fake news story of 2017, that the president's tax plan won't help the poor people.
[36:57.360 --> 37:04.360]  White people don't know what it's like to tear people up.
[37:04.360 --> 37:07.360]  I bankrupt companies and take them all over them.
[37:07.360 --> 37:09.360]  It's all right, liberal.
[37:09.360 --> 37:13.360]  Swindle, that's swindle, that's swindle.
[37:13.360 --> 37:19.360]  The country is going to just get my boot on your neck like we did the Russians for 85 years.
[37:19.360 --> 37:22.360]  It's show you.
[37:22.360 --> 37:24.360]  Let me stop channeling him.
[37:24.360 --> 37:29.360]  So continuing, they said that the tax cut would hurt the economy.
[37:29.360 --> 37:30.360]  It just exploded.
[37:30.360 --> 37:33.360]  And they said that it was to benefit only the rich.
[37:33.360 --> 37:34.360]  Total lying.
[37:34.360 --> 37:41.360]  When the ultra rich don't want this and want our president's head on a spike, on a spike.
[37:41.360 --> 37:53.360]  So it is the first annual 2017 People's Choice Fake News Awards, leading up to the big kahuna,
[37:53.360 --> 37:59.360]  Donald John Trump, the promise keeper, the man that delivers.
[37:59.360 --> 38:10.360]  I'm not calling him Moses yet, the deliverer, but he's delivering, which is the subset of that overall historical term.
[38:10.360 --> 38:15.360]  Here we are 20 years ago today, BBC, arrival of the digital age.
[38:15.360 --> 38:26.360]  Lewinsky blames Drudge, took three days before others to report the dress, the cigar, the drama, all about independent media, forcing them to report something so critical.
[38:26.360 --> 38:28.360]  Overall, Lewinsky is that important?
[38:28.360 --> 38:32.360]  No, but him lying about it, the media trying to cover it up, their failure.
[38:32.360 --> 38:33.360]  That was the shot.
[38:33.360 --> 38:36.360]  Heard around the world, heralding in their own words, the digital age.
[38:36.360 --> 38:42.360]  And now 20 years later, the London Independent, even the Associated Press and others say,
[38:42.360 --> 38:47.360]  Drudge is the number one most powerful journalist in the world.
[38:47.360 --> 39:00.360]  After thousands of publications heralded his collapse, his fall, the end of Drudge, knowing the entire time it was the metaphoric rise.
[39:00.360 --> 39:06.360]  Just as they've said about Info Wars, and just as they try to block you sharing the articles, the videos, the live links.
[39:06.360 --> 39:15.360]  So infowars.com forward slash show, share that link and tell folks it's the first annual People's Choice fake news awards with President Trump.
[39:15.360 --> 39:26.360]  Because he's coming up and the headline just went live at infowars.com with the live feeds from Facebook, Google, the YouTube system and Twitter.
[39:26.360 --> 39:30.360]  With the live feeds of the People's Choice right now.
[39:30.360 --> 39:32.360]  It's an Info War.
[39:32.360 --> 39:34.360]  So get that link with the live feeds.
[39:34.360 --> 39:36.360]  I know you're listing a local M&F and that's fine.
[39:36.360 --> 39:37.360]  That's wonderful.
[39:37.360 --> 39:38.360]  Get it out to everybody.
[39:38.360 --> 39:49.360]  You don't say, hey, did you know the President's fake news awards is live and introing it is the People's Choice fake news awards.
[39:49.360 --> 39:54.360]  Now, when we do these special live events, there's usually outside of our regular audience of three, four million a day,
[39:54.360 --> 39:57.360]  only a half million to a million that tune into them.
[39:57.360 --> 39:59.360]  And that's, it's a three or four hour show.
[39:59.360 --> 40:01.360]  It's 24 hours, maybe a million, two million extra.
[40:01.360 --> 40:02.360]  That's very important.
[40:02.360 --> 40:03.360]  It's new people.
[40:03.360 --> 40:04.360]  It's how we grow.
[40:04.360 --> 40:11.360]  But when you get excited, we've had over 35 million people in one day tune into the streams.
[40:11.360 --> 40:18.360]  Now, more and more, you got to go to infowars.com forward slash show and get off our feet because Twitter, Google and people will kill the feeds and play games.
[40:18.360 --> 40:24.360]  But everybody's welcome to pick up our feed and infowars.com forward slash show or the backup.
[40:24.360 --> 40:34.360]  That's an even better HD for members at prisonplanet.tv and mirror it on your Facebook, mirror it on your Twitter, stream it on your own system.
[40:34.360 --> 40:42.360]  We're in a total war right now infowars.com forward slash show to get our feed.
[40:42.360 --> 41:06.360]  But the really important ones to make them go mega viral is on the front page of infowars.com and newswars.com with the headline right now that you can watch President Trump host the first annual fake news awards with the people's choice right now for the next three, four hours leading into it.
[41:06.360 --> 41:14.360]  And your phone calls are starting. Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines on the other side and we've got flake saying this is Stalinistic.
[41:14.360 --> 41:17.360]  This is the most evil thing in the galaxy.
[41:17.360 --> 41:23.360]  Let's go to that clip right now as we go to break here is the senator demonizing fighting back.
[41:23.360 --> 41:33.360]  It is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Joseph Stalin to describe his enemies.
[41:33.360 --> 41:41.360]  It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase enemy of the people that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use.
[41:41.360 --> 41:52.360]  Telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of quote annihilating such individuals unquote who disagreed with a supreme leader.
[41:52.360 --> 41:56.360]  This alone should be the source of great shame for us in this body.
[41:56.360 --> 42:03.360]  Especially for those of us in the president's party, for they are shameful repulsive statements.
[42:03.360 --> 42:06.360]  And of course the president has it precisely backward.
[42:06.360 --> 42:09.360]  Despotism is the enemy of the people.
[42:09.360 --> 42:15.360]  The free press is the despots enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy.
[42:15.360 --> 42:17.360]  He's not ending the free press.
[42:17.360 --> 42:21.360]  When a figure in power reflexively standing up to you lying scumbags.
[42:21.360 --> 42:25.360]  It is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.
[42:25.360 --> 42:27.360]  Oh, you're not the press.
[42:27.360 --> 42:36.360]  I dare say that anyone who has had the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive supporters of fake news are dubious at best.
[42:36.360 --> 42:38.360]  Who ever said you was one.
[42:38.360 --> 42:44.360]  Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas all around the globe,
[42:44.360 --> 42:52.360]  encounter members of US based media who risk their lives and sometimes lose their lives reporting on the truth.
[42:52.360 --> 42:58.360]  So they're implying Trump's trying to kill journalists when they're the ones going hashtag hunt Republicans and pushing all the violence.
[42:58.360 --> 42:59.360]  I'm so excited.
[42:59.360 --> 43:09.360]  The new product at infowarslife.com in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real Red Bull.
[43:09.360 --> 43:18.360]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[43:18.360 --> 43:24.360]  And frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients.
[43:24.360 --> 43:30.360]  But it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[43:30.360 --> 43:39.360]  And I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers non GMO made right here in America 120 capsules.
[43:39.360 --> 43:48.360]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglonone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[43:48.360 --> 43:51.360]  It is amazing.
[43:51.360 --> 43:58.360]  Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com and your purchase fives the operation.
[43:58.360 --> 44:01.360]  Matt and Ohio, you're on the air.
[44:01.360 --> 44:02.360]  Another Matt, go ahead.
[44:02.360 --> 44:12.360]  Hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of info wars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic.
[44:12.360 --> 44:16.360]  And that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the info war.
[44:16.360 --> 44:24.360]  It might seem like a simple thing, but they particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[44:24.360 --> 44:32.360]  Thank you. My favorite new one is the don't tread on me, but said it says won't tread on me. And it's a big day glow snake, Gadsden snake.
[44:32.360 --> 44:35.360]  And then it's got the American flag info wars.com on the right arm.
[44:35.360 --> 44:42.360]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[44:42.360 --> 44:52.360]  And the newest one is trigger warning t-shirt trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign and then info wars.com on the back.
[44:52.360 --> 44:59.360]  This is the new shirt of the mind available exclusively at infowarstore.com.
[44:59.360 --> 45:02.360]  I want to plow into all of this.
[45:02.360 --> 45:17.360]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com,
[45:17.360 --> 45:19.360]  you are funding the revolution.
[45:19.360 --> 45:25.360]  I cannot say it any clear. And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[45:25.360 --> 45:32.360]  And I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it.
[45:32.360 --> 45:34.360]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[45:34.360 --> 45:37.360]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[45:37.360 --> 45:44.360]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well infowarslife.com or triple a two five three three one three nine.
[45:44.360 --> 45:51.360]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[45:51.360 --> 46:19.360]  And that's who they are. And they know we know who they are. And they're coming back against us. So we need your support.
[46:19.360 --> 46:39.360]  Thank you so much, Alex for the infowarslife products. They are quality. I can't wait to get some more. And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[46:39.360 --> 46:40.360]  Absolutely.
[46:40.360 --> 46:49.360]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems going on.
[46:49.360 --> 47:11.360]  We can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves. We can take our country back.
[47:19.360 --> 47:34.360]  All right, Charles, John, Steve, Ben, John, James, Kevin, Mad, Chris, Josh, Jason. Sometimes I get like all women, sometimes I get all men.
[47:34.360 --> 47:43.360]  But that's who's on the board right now. We've got the 2017 People's Choice Fake News Awards that's going to be running right up till four o'clock today.
[47:43.360 --> 48:02.360]  And then we're going to carry live President Trump's awards at four o'clock Central, five o'clock Eastern, and we are going to then see how our ideas, your ideas, all the fake news that MSM got caught in, which ones that we picked match up with the president.
[48:02.360 --> 48:12.360]  I mean, is it that Hillary was going to win the election? 99% chance. New York Times Newsweek already had it printed up. She was Madam President with a fake magazine showing her give the victory speech.
[48:12.360 --> 48:15.360]  I mean, that's pretty, pretty close.
[48:15.360 --> 48:27.360]  No illegals voted when it was all confirmed. Millions did the lying polls saying Trump was sick and had the mind of a five year old when he doesn't top medical reports don't come out.
[48:27.360 --> 48:37.360]  Meanwhile, we got more dirty tricks. Hackers messaged Donald Trump with former Fox News House Twitter accounts, Greta Van Cestern and others.
[48:37.360 --> 48:48.360]  They got the feeds probably inside jobs because those are now derelict accounts from Twitter with the vicious, you know, Twitter spying on its users spying on them having sex sharing the videos.
[48:48.360 --> 48:51.360]  There's nothing Silicon scum won't do.
[48:51.360 --> 48:58.360]  The skill of Silicon scum a con valley of scum. We've got that.
[48:58.360 --> 49:07.360]  So two personalities Trump followed on Twitter apparently hacked as they tried to use them as ways to private message. I think the prime suspects are operatives inside Twitter.
[49:07.360 --> 49:11.360]  They've been caught doing it before. Twitter's already killed his account before.
[49:11.360 --> 49:16.360]  As a beta test, we're going to be discussing that as well.
[49:16.360 --> 49:22.360]  So huge fake news stories. We're going to be taking your calls on all of those.
[49:22.360 --> 49:35.360]  You've also seen hundreds of fake news stories about crosses burned, poop swastikas, Jewish dormitories being attacked, Jewish cemeteries being attacked, Muslims being attacked by Trump supporters.
[49:35.360 --> 49:53.360]  Every single one of them, it turned out 2017 of hundreds was fake. Info wars, Breitbart, Fox all wrote detailed articles chronicling just the dozens and dozens and dozens of examples per article per month.
[49:53.360 --> 50:03.360]  So that's a big fake news awards is the media going with these hate crime hoaxes to try to create a racially charged atmosphere.
[50:03.360 --> 50:07.360]  Total free number to join us when you're somebody hang up. That's your chance to get on air.
[50:07.360 --> 50:17.360]  Matt's doing a great job and they're taking your calls. H777892539 or briefly because we got to find the operation.
[50:17.360 --> 50:25.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, you are the people that make real news brazen in your face wearing it on our sleeve that we love Liberty.
[50:25.360 --> 50:39.360]  We promote the truth. You are what funds this information warfare operation. And when you buy the products, when you buy the videos, when you buy the books, when you buy the air filtration, the water filtration, the non GMO heirloom seeds,
[50:39.360 --> 50:48.360]  all the highest quality, high quality solar powered shortwave radios, emergency radios, thousands and thousands of whatever the coolest items are, we can get the best prices on.
[50:48.360 --> 50:56.360]  Let's make a catalog soon. We put in three for every order because we really are a big catalog now. It funds us. That's how we're funded.
[50:56.360 --> 51:07.360]  So shop with the good guys today. Please. So many great products at infowarslife.com. So many great supplements, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:07.360 --> 51:18.360]  Now, we're announcing a new product today that is so well documented. And ours is a particular concentrate of this that is directly from France.
[51:18.360 --> 51:28.360]  And we are announcing pollen block. It's normally 3495 waiting competitors are up to $60. Our sales price is 1776 out of the gates.
[51:28.360 --> 51:42.360]  You know, that's close to what it costs is 51% off pollen block with all of the seasonal stuff that's out there and all the sniffling and all of the irritation that goes on pollen block.
[51:42.360 --> 51:49.360]  It's not like Clarin and D or Zyrtec D that works pretty good. But it makes me, you know, want to beat people up. I mean, you know, it's like methamphetamine.
[51:49.360 --> 52:00.360]  That's why I can't take it. So I started taking this months before it actually came out and it has assuated many of the seasonal issues that we all get.
[52:00.360 --> 52:10.360]  And it blows me away how well it works. I'd say about a 70% reduction. So infowarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[52:10.360 --> 52:18.360]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways.
[52:18.360 --> 52:23.360]  Eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing. This is pollen block.
[52:23.360 --> 52:27.360]  The problem about a third of Americans experience some sort of seasonal discomfort.
[52:27.360 --> 52:34.360]  Nobody wants to be forced to stay indoors during some of the best times of the year. It's time to get back out in the open air.
[52:34.360 --> 52:47.360]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like running nose, itchy watery eyes and excessive mucus production.
[52:47.360 --> 52:59.360]  They began studying the effects in their published trials and eventually perfected the technique to naturally harvest the secret, bioactive portion.
[52:59.360 --> 53:06.360]  This is the secret process of the eggs and concentrated into an effective small dose tablet.
[53:06.360 --> 53:23.360]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Just two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[53:23.360 --> 53:31.360]  The product comes in a convenient small plastic to go container so you can take it with you hiking, hunting, fishing or watching the game.
[53:31.360 --> 53:38.360]  Pollen block is a simple, natural and effective way to enjoy the outdoors again without the use of artificial pharmaceuticals.
[53:38.360 --> 53:48.360]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block available now at InfowarsLife.com or by calling toll-free.
[53:48.360 --> 54:13.360]  We also now have in stock a immune wall. It's 25% off with the beta-glucans, the olive leaf and a bunch of other concentrated, new, high-tech, patented, studied systems with ancient things like concentrated olive leaves that the Romans took to both their immune systems,
[54:13.360 --> 54:21.360]  or especially take once they started getting sick. That was one reason they could defeat their enemies, just like the British discovered limes when nobody else knew what vitamin C was 300 years before everybody else.
[54:21.360 --> 54:29.360]  So when they faced down the Spanish or the French or the Dutch or others 3,000 miles away, they'd be ready to fight on the decks of their ships.
[54:29.360 --> 54:36.360]  And this has also got the concentrated organic lemon peel and orange peel in it for the vitamin C.
[54:36.360 --> 54:47.360]  It is powerful. It is immune wall with all the concentrated mushrooms and so much more, and your purchase funds this operation to the total chagrin of the enemy.
[54:47.360 --> 54:53.360]  It devastates them when you shop with the good guys, when you get an additional 10% off and sign up for auto ships.
[54:53.360 --> 54:58.360]  You don't forget to support ourselves in the Infowar yourself and everybody together.
[54:58.360 --> 55:06.360]  So go to infowarstore.com and it's got to end because Secret 12 is 50% off about to sell out. Survival Shield is close.
[55:06.360 --> 55:09.360]  And I may just go ahead and let it sell out the next week if I don't have any more for a month.
[55:09.360 --> 55:16.360]  And SuperMell Vitality, all very close. There's still 50% off. Again, we had to get rid of the free shipping just because we cannot operate so much of it.
[55:16.360 --> 55:23.360]  We sold a ton of stuff, but didn't bring in as much funding because, again, there's less money per order.
[55:23.360 --> 55:28.360]  People take advantage of it and that's great. And I kind of come up with my specials myself.
[55:28.360 --> 55:41.360]  And so the accountants are like, kind of hit me on the head with pencils saying, listen, you need to really stop it because you don't do like Walmart does or Target where they say, oh, we're having a sale and they raise the price 50% one week, then lower it the next week.
[55:41.360 --> 55:46.360]  And then it's really the regular price. When we say 50% off, folks, it's 50% off.
[55:46.360 --> 55:54.360]  So pollen block is incredible. You've heard about what local honey does for seasonal issues and distress in the dust and all the rest of it in the pollen.
[55:54.360 --> 56:04.360]  It helps some, but nothing has helped like this other than Zyrtec D and Claredon D. And that makes me, I mean, I'm naturally bouncing off the walls off one cup of coffee today.
[56:04.360 --> 56:12.360]  I never even finished my cup. Okay. I can't take it. And yes, it makes me feel better, except it makes me feel crazy.
[56:12.360 --> 56:20.360]  Well, this doesn't do it. And I don't know how the Japanese quail eggs fed this special diet in France, how this was discovered.
[56:20.360 --> 56:29.360]  But obviously, you know, the birds have got some things in them that are, you know, they're out there in the middle, all the, all the dust and all the garbage and all the pathologies and everything.
[56:29.360 --> 56:35.360]  And they'd transmit it through the eggs to you. And they don't, it's all very secret.
[56:35.360 --> 56:45.360]  It took us about a year to be able to get ahold of the folks, to be able to get the deal made. You know, it's kind of like we have to go to the Mississippi, America to get the bio PQQ that's actually real for DNA force.
[56:45.360 --> 56:52.360]  I mean, these are real high quality things. Okay, I'm done. I am done. I will not plug to the end of the next hour. I'm going to come back.
[56:52.360 --> 57:05.360]  You know, I've got all these clips of the, of the head surgeon saying Trump's great and 30 out of 30, a perfect cognitive score. Well, that proves their fake news is just that fake news.
[57:05.360 --> 57:10.360]  We've got Stelter saying Hillary's in perfect health, but then freaking out about Trump's health and making stuff up.
[57:10.360 --> 57:23.360]  But it's the first annual people's choice, fake news awards and we'll be carrying President Trump's fake news awards from the White House coming up at four o'clock central five o'clock Eastern.
[57:23.360 --> 57:34.360]  So info wars.com forward slash show again. I am your host and please we're in a total censorship war. You're our only hope.

[57:52.360 --> 58:03.360]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[58:03.360 --> 58:15.360]  Right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[58:15.360 --> 58:21.360]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it.
[58:21.360 --> 58:29.360]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.

[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:31.360]  To a minimum, my tongue to a minimum. And I've just gotta have you make your point.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:39.360]  We'll vet it. We'll pull up an article confirming it was fake news. We'll print it off, put it in the stack, and it will go into the hopper to be nominated for the top 10.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:49.360]  And then we're gonna have the top three nominated fake news stories 2017, $2,000 prize, $1,000 prize, and a set of steak knives for the third prize.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:01:03.360]  But if I think you're going into the nomination hopper, I'm gonna say we're gonna put you on hold and the great Matt or the other wonderful crew will get on the phone with you and we'll get your name and number.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:17.360]  And then after the president has his awards tonight, we're gonna mesh up our awards, the ones we choose by 4 o'clock, with the ones that the president has, and then we're gonna kind of put those together.
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:28.360]  It's gonna be interesting. We're gonna carry that live at 4 o'clock today. So you are watching the live feed where you're gonna have President Trump and his first annual fake news awards as the American people stand up and point out the lies of mainstream media.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:36.360]  No, just sit there and take it. And we welcome people to investigate us and go over us and see what we're doing.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:48.360]  You know, they got all our supplements and tested them over and over again. Couldn't find anything wrong with them. So there's a very high quality out there. And I said, you know what they're gonna do next? You know, you know what they did.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:57.360]  It's not hard to, you know, so much this just figure out, you know, hey, you go out walking out there in the middle of the, you know, black ice on the street, you might fall down and break your butt.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:03.360]  And it happens, you know, it's like, wow, if they can't get his fair and square, what are they gonna do?
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:12.360]  So we can anticipate what these folks are up to. It's very, very important to expose them. So we're gonna do that today.
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:20.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, now, I don't want to cut Charles off and John and Steve and Ben and John and James and Kevin and all these folks.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:23.360]  So I'm gonna do this. We're gonna have a one minute break. Come back and go write your calls.
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:37.360]  But I want to go ahead and play since I mentioned it. This is Ron Jackson. I worked for four presidents directly for three of them, friends with Obama, said great things about Obama, bipartisan, very respected, saying this guy's as healthy as a horse, okay?
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.360]  And the media's flipping out about it. Here's part of it.
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:51.360]  Number one, there have been some questions as part of your exam. One of you talked to the president about this, but the president's mental fitness, he has pushed back on that, calling the table genius. Can you assess the president's mental fitness for office?
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:03:03.360]  Absolutely. So many of you may have picked up on the fact that we did do a cognitive assessment as part of the exam. And initially, you know, I had no intention of including a cognitive assessment in this exam because to be honest with you,
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:16.360]  per all the guidelines that are out there, it just, it's not indicated at this time. A lot of the guidelines would suggest that you do, that you do cognitive screening questions, and that if you have a positive or concerning answer in the screening questions,
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:30.360]  that then you engage with a cognitive screening tool. So I had no intentions whatsoever doing that. Like I said, because right out of the Soviet Union, the reason I didn't think it was clinically indicated is because I've spent almost every day in the president's
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:43.360]  presence since January 22,000, or, you know, last year, when he got into office. And I've seen him every day. I've seen one, two, sometimes three times a day because of the location of my office. We have conversations about many things.
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.360]  Most of not, most don't.
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.360]  How long do we have to respond to every fake thing they say?
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.360]  I've got to know him pretty well.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:04:05.360]  If you don't have a fork tail, Trump, tell us your body or his, you know, his neurological function. So I was not going to do a cognitive exam. I had no intention of doing one. The reason that we did the cognitive assessment is plain and simple because the
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:18.360]  president asked me to do it. He came to me and he said, is there something we can do a test or some type of screen that we can do to assess my, you know, my cognitive ability. And so I looked into it. And once again, and my initial question was that I didn't think it was
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:30.360]  indicated and I didn't think we should do it. After looking at some of the guidelines, there are a few guidelines out there that lean in the direction of potentially doing it, you know, the Medicare guidelines and some of the NIA.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:39.360]  Hold on. It paused. There's only a minute left. I've got to have the part where he does the test and he gets a 30 out of 30. And they don't know what to do. Now the media is saying this guy's lying.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:49.360]  Well, okay, that a guy that's mentally retarded defeated your entire power structure. So what does that say about you, Stelter? What does that say that a mental deficient defeated you?
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:05:12.360]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels. Up, up, up, optimum levels. With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:23.360]  Up, up, up, up, optimum levels. B vitamins we need every day. Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption. Up, up, up, up, optimal absorption.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:32.360]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory and lethargy. Secret 12, up, up, up, up, optimal absorption.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:44.360]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your inner cellular processes. B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system. Up, up, up, up, optimum levels.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:06:08.360]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake. Head to infowarslife.com and support optimal brain and body function with Secret 12. That's infowarslife.com.

[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:49.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have just tuned in to the first annual infowars.com People's Fake News Choice Awards. It is the Fake News Awards, the People's Choice.
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:07:03.360]  Also, carry the President's live awards show coming up at 4 o'clock Central, 5 o'clock Eastern, infowars.com, 4 o'clock Show. Please tell everybody about the local stations you're listening to. It's so critical, I cannot stress that enough.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:22.360]  And also go to infowars.com or newswars.com and share the live page, Watch Live, the 2017 Fake News Awards hosted by President Trump. Full coverage, the first annual People's Choice Fake News Awards presented by InfoWars.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:36.360]  Share this link. So up until 4 o'clock today, right through my transmission into the war room with Owen Schreuer and Roger Stone and others, I'll be there as well. Then we'll have the President's live event.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:48.360]  Then we'll have commentary and we'll match up your calls, your nominations, what you thought the most important mainstream news, fake news of the year was, or if something we said was wrong.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:08:01.360]  I mean, I'll tell you a fake news award. Hundreds of publications say that I said there are children living as slaves on Mars. I said no such thing.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:13.360]  Buzz Aldrin said that there is an obelisk on the one moon of Mars. And I talked about that when I had a CIA guy on that said some weird stuff.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:24.360]  I said nothing like that. Either there's no video, there's no audio, but I am constantly confronted by people. It's not I'm a Russian agent anymore. That's all falling apart.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:35.360]  The whole thing that Trump's dying, that's all falling apart. In fact, he was going to rip all that. No, it's that I am saying that there are slave colonies on Mars.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:47.360]  Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie. Okay, without further ado, the first caller of the people's choice, fake news awards.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:55.360]  We'll see how many of our fake news awards line up with the President's now coming up in T-minus three hours and 51 minutes, 10 seconds.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:05.360]  MFullWars.com forward slash show. MFullWars.com. Get the article, spread it. It's how we reach new people. I keep hammering it. They're having congressional hearings saying they're censoring us.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:14.360]  They're trying to shut down drugs. They're trying to shut down talk radio. They're trying to remake the fairness doctrine. Thank God we got Trump in, but we're still fighting. They're trying to remove him.
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:27.360]  They're trying to block the recovery. They're trying to block. He's repealed the mandate on Obamacare. We are delivering. You are delivering. We are winning, but we're not out of this fight yet.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:35.360]  We've got to have a heart here for the fight. You know, I didn't realize we had like the real Jean-Claude von Domin here yesterday.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:45.360]  I mean, I knew he was a world champion movie tie fighter, but for the country of Thailand and stuff, world champion in his weight, bare knuckles boxing, bare knuckles movie tie.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:56.360]  This, that's kicking and punching and all that stuff that they make movies about, but the real deal. I mean, I knew who he was, former Special Operations guy and friends with, you know, Quentin and the other guys that were in here.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:05.360]  One guy couldn't put himself on television. It's just crazy. We need to have him back sometime just to talk about that because people get killed all the time doing that. That's crazy.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:20.360]  So that's something interesting as a side issue. All right, ladies and gentlemen, Charles, John, Steve, Ben, John, James, Kevin, Mad, Christian, Chris, Josh, Jason, Frank, we're going to you right now.
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:29.360]  And why are we doing this? To point out the lies. They want to just move forward. Think we forget about all their other lies. Tell us Obamacare is going to be free.
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:38.360]  And then it's not. Member Gruber said, thank God you don't have an attention span. You have the attention span of Dory in Finding Nemo.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:45.360]  He says, thank God, well, we do have an attention span. And that's what infowars.com does. We'll show you where they said something two years ago.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:51.360]  We'll show you where they say it now, or we'll show you unfiltered what somebody's saying when they're being accused of something.
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:57.360]  And point out, hey, lawyers are paying people to say this. Here what Stephen Segal has to say directly from him.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:03.360]  And that's what they hate is they want to put out the only narrative and not let you decide for yourself. All right, I'm done.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:11.360]  Without further ado, let's go to John in Wyoming. John, thank you for calling. Thank you for holding.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:16.360]  You are the first caller of the People's Choice Fake News Awards 2017. Go ahead.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:20.360]  Thank you, Alex. And happy New Year to all of you guys. Thank you.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:30.360]  Thank you. I want to talk about these phony posters. My award goes to these people who keep lying to the American people how Trump's popularity ratings are down.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:35.360]  They're the same liars who said that Hillary was going to win by 12 points.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:46.360]  They're the same liars who in 1984 said Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferrara were going to steamroll all over Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:56.360]  Yet when the 84 election concluded, Reagan and Bush had won 49 states with 525 electoral college votes.
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:04.360]  And Mondale and Ferrara only won Mondale's home state of Minnesota with just 13 electoral college votes.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:09.360]  Now, my question to them is, whatever happened to Wally and the beaver?
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:23.360]  Exactly. So, I mean, I think that that's in the running. Fake polls, fake pollsters getting together with their own methodology admitting adding 9, 10, 15, 20, sometimes 30 plus points to Hillary.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:31.360]  That really is the big takeaway because they keep saying Trump's illegitimate. Right into 2017, they still keep hammering these fake polls.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:40.360]  Well, also, they're the ones who didn't want to talk about a 60 minutes interview that they had with Bill and Hillary Clinton about 20 years ago.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:47.360]  And rather than seated on a sofa, they had Bill and Hillary sitting on these high wooden bar stools.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:51.360]  And in the midst of the interview, a studio light popped behind them.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:58.360]  They thought they were under fire and they both immediately leapt to their feet and Hillary screamed at the top of her lungs,
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:08.360]  Jesus, Joseph and Mary, and then jumped into Bill's lap while he was standing and she was crying and shivering uncontrollably.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:13.360]  And that's the same media who was trying to tell us what a tough, strong leader Hillary.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:19.360]  You know, it's funny you say that. She says that she's on tarmacs getting shot up and she's caught lying like Brian Williams.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.360]  These are known liars. We'll play that video when we come back.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:29.360]  She actually hops around like a chimpanzee. She goes, and then hops in his lap. You're absolutely right.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:33.360]  John, you're one of the guys I want to start hosting a show. We've been talking about it for years.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:37.360]  We've tried to call your number. I'm going to put you on hold again to make sure that happens.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:43.360]  But you're also getting your number because you're in the running with your nomination of the pollsters to be one of the winners.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:50.360]  We're going to see right now in the people's choice because whoever ends up, you know, getting the best ones that match up with the president,
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:55.360]  we're going to end up having them win. I have a sneaking suspicion you may win here, John. Let's put John on hold.
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:01.360]  Thank you so much, John. Okay, let's get one more in before we go to break.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:07.360]  Let's go to Ben. We're going to go to Kansas and talk to Ben in Kansas. You're on the air, Ben.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.360]  Hey, how you doing, Alex? Good.
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:20.360]  Oh, right. Well, I think everyone knows the biggest host of this whole election episode was the fact that the Russians stole the election.
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:27.360]  And, you know, everyone, all the channels covered, oh, it's the Russians. That's why Hillary lost.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:32.360]  There could be no other reason, you know, because she got the poll said she won.
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:40.360]  So, you know, that's that's my that's my guess. And I think you'll agree. I mean, that's that's probably the biggest.
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:44.360]  Exactly. But do you just say Russia gate in general is the biggest fake news?
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:52.360]  Because you've got to give an award to a particular media outlet like ABC saying that Flynn had confessed and they were all Russian agents.
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:59.360]  Exactly. Exactly. So, yeah, that's that's one of them, you know, CNN.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:05.360]  So does the dossier win? I mean, does the does the FBI win?
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:10.360]  I mean, I'm not bashing the general FBI, but the Democrats at the top. I mean, do they win for funding the fake dossier?
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:15.360]  Because, you know, it's not just media that's in the news business. The FBI is now in the fake news business with the Clintons.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:19.360]  They're trying to clean house. But does fusion GPS when does the FBI win this?
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:25.360]  Comey when does ABC when who wins that in the whole Russia's constellation?
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:30.360]  What's the brightest lie of them all? I think CNN.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:33.360]  You pick who? CNN.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:39.360]  Okay, CNN leader in fake news for Russia gate. Let's put Ben on hold and get his number.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:46.360]  These are all so good. We have like 100 people to call back. Let's get Ben's info because I think he's right on target as well.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:56.360]  We'll be back in just a few minutes with the first annual People's Choice fake news awards hosted by yours truly Alex Jones.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:03.360]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:06.360]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:15.360]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break in. Go to fakeTV.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV.

[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:28.360]  Hail Putin and his great minion Donald J. Trump to make America great again. We pledge this plan to destroy the Americans to save their economy and their people and their border and their military.
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:32.360]  Hail Putin. Hail Russia. We will never surrender.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:47.360]  Hail Russia and America for the people's friendship.
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:09.360]  The biggest start-ups in factories since World War II all because they're taking the boot off our neck.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:17.360]  And that's why the elite that had run this country in the ground are so angry. They are the criminal elite that had total control.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:22.360]  We're going to go to Josh in Oregon here in just a moment. We're going to go to Chris in Virginia and others. Boom, boom, boom.
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:33.360]  With your nominations, this is the people's choice 2017 held on Wednesday, January 17, 2018. Fake news awards.
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:40.360]  We're printing off all the nominations, printing off articles to substantiate your statements, putting them in a big stack.
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:49.360]  That's critical to then, you guys can print those off and bring them to me. Thank you. So then we can bring in all the nominations.
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:58.360]  On the war room at three o'clock, go over them and decide who's going to win. And then guess how it's going to line up with President Trump that we're going to carry live and follow it live.
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:05.360]  So if people want to watch the fake news awards, really upsets the globals when we do this. Tell folks, watch President Trump live here.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:11.360]  Don't watch it filtered through the media where they'll censor it or make stuff up or block it. See it unedited live today.
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:22.360]  4 o'clock central info wars.com forward slash show and spread the articles that get Daniels posted with the same title. Okay, right now, we'll normally promote, promote, promote, but this is critical.
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:30.360]  This really upsets them. It really gets to them. And there were so close to destroying them completely. They're trying to destroy us with lies and censorship and corporate power.
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:37.360]  We're destroying them with the truth. Speaking of destroying them, the poster boy for what looks like a psychotic Humpty Dumpty.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:49.360]  Brian Stelter is being nominated by Josh in Oregon. Josh, you're on the air. Tell us about your nomination for fake news kingpin in 2017.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:23:01.360]  We keep hearing CNN from the listeners and you've nominated Brian Piranha Faiz Stelter. Go ahead.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:13.360]  Absolutely. Thank you, Alex. Yeah, so I think Brian Stelter, I think he may, he may take the cake. I mean, there's a lot of, there's a lot of contenders for fake news, fake news award, but I think he might just take the cake.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:23.360]  And the reason why is during the campaign, he was one of the lead people pushing the idea that it was conspiracy theory if you question Hillary Clinton's health whatsoever.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:32.360]  And then he is now the person leading the actual conspiracy theory saying that Donald Trump is indeed mentally unfit for office.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:38.360]  Why don't I hear like ice cream truck music and think of like white van when I look at him?
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:44.360]  Yeah, definitely. I bet he has a closet full of trench coats. I could almost guarantee you that.
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:53.360]  I mean, look, he doesn't know how psychotic he looks in these photos. I mean, how would you post for a photo and then go look? I mean, this is a great glamour shot. We're going to put this out.
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:24:00.360]  Look. Hi, Brian Stelter. Hi. Sorry, go ahead.
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:15.360]  Yeah, he has quite the psychotic disconnect in his eyes for sure. I mean, it's just, it really is the look of these people, though. And I truly think it is sort of a spirit that they channel kind of.
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:26.360]  It is. It's the look of a traitor. It's a look of what the evil running this planet comes up with. Because let's face it, it's hard to get really strong, powerful, you know, men to be pieces of crap.
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:32.360]  You've got to trick them. You've got to manipulate them. But willing accomplices, they're always little sacks of garbage.
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:43.360]  Oh, absolutely. And I mean, there's historical context for this. I mean, we know that Hitler himself, he admitted, this is actual mainstream history that after he got gasped in World War, World War One, he had these crazy supernatural.
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:51.360]  He had hallucinations and was possessed by a spirit that showed everything was going to happen that only betrayed him at the end. Same thing with Charles Darwin.
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:25:00.360]  Yeah. Oh yeah. Absolutely. I mean, so yeah, there's definitely historical context for it. And I don't think, I don't think Brian Settler's got a high level demon like, like old, old Hillard did.
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.360]  I think he's probably got a lower level, little, little, you know.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:10.360]  Well, you can see that. I mean, he looks like a gremlin. He's not even a goblin.
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:13.360]  Wormtongue, Wormtongue Grimer for sure.
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:32.360]  All right, brother, God bless you. So Brian Settler, my gosh, that is, that is, you know, really, really, really hard not to say that he is right up there at the top of just the icon of disingenuous, narcissistic, blind arrogance, not realizing he shaves his head to look old.
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.360]  He's like 32.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:42.360]  I mean, there's just nothing more fake about this condescending enemy of humanity. I mean, that's just he would win the enemy of humanity awards.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:53.360]  I mean, if I was a Hollywood director, I know what I'd cast him for, though, every time you hear the ice cream truck ice cream.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:26:03.360]  Here comes the ice cream man, the ice cream man. If he can't, nobody can ice cream man. Brian Seltzer ice cream ice cream candy and puppies.
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:07.360]  All so fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you, Josh. I appreciate your call.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:13.360]  Okay, we certainly know he enjoys annihilating the truth.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:27.360]  Okay, let's go ahead now and let's go to another caller here in the fake news awards, the People's Choice. Let's talk to Charles in Atlanta, Georgia. You're on the air, my friend.
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:31.360]  Hey, Alex, great job out there, man. You're definitely a patriot of the highest order.
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:37.360]  No, you are. I'm under attack. I'm not rolling over. That's who I am. And we're brothers. Go ahead.
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:50.360]  We'd be toast without you, my friend. Look, man, my, my fake news award goes to faux news. And I don't know if you saw Judge Jeanine on Saturday night, but it was one of the most egregious insulting examples I've ever seen.
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:58.360]  She had Sheriff Joe on the show. Guys been in law enforcement for over half a century since she's probably been in grade school. Now he's running for Senate.
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:04.360]  So she brings up the false alarm going on in Hawaii on Saturday afternoon and says, oh, you feel really strongly about this.
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:13.360]  And he says, yeah, he points out the fact that he had the long, the ongoing investigation into the forged documents in Hawaii and says, you know, they can't even solve that.
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:21.360]  Judge Jeanine immediately cuts him off and says, you know, that document, the long form was filed. So let's put that one away.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:31.360]  What do you mean filed liar? What was filed? It was forged. So he tries to push back. She immediately cuts him off and says, well, all right, let's keep moving because they did solve that.
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:36.360]  And I'm going to keep pushing back on that. Pushing back on what? Two different experts.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:51.360]  So anyway, they hired sure they hired the top firm in Italy and what another one in England or Germany to look at it. What we found out an hour, they put it in six layers on purpose, used Microsoft Word with the fake typewriter font.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:57.360]  So all the letters are supposedly going to be individual from a typewriter because each splat is like a fingerprint or snowflake. It was the same deal.
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:00.360]  And then of course, years later, the top scientists say what we said.
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:10.360]  Again, why did they make it so fake on purpose to make it a debate about that? Why did he say he was from Kenya, born in Kenya in the Harvard Law Review that he was the editor of?
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:21.360]  Why did his wife say it in speeches as the double cover that he's really Frank Marshall Davis, his son, he's lived with him. It's admitted there's photos of him on the same couch that his mom shot porn in.
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:26.360]  It's all confirmed. So that was the whole setup. It's why they did all that to us on purpose.
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:31.360]  Yeah, I mean, full news has been covered for those of the fraud for six years.
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:35.360]  All you're right. Fox News has certain things they won't let get touched.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:45.360]  And one of them is 9 11 truth. The other big one is the birth certificate, which again was ridiculously fake.
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:53.360]  I mean, it was we opened it up. It was in layers. They didn't flatten the fake forgery on purpose to make us take the bay.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.360]  We'll be back.
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:02.360]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon. I'm talking thick, meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:06.360]  I buy some, I use some, I store some. Awesome.
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:17.360]  No refrigeration needed with a 10 year shelf life, NASA pack technology, bacon, fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon or warm and serve.

[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:25.360]  Alex Jones, the foray conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:33.360]  Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:39.360]  Scotland, Russian, Scotland.
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:43.360]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:53.360]  Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:03.360]  Why am I so in Trump's corner? Because I'm a man of my word.
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:08.360]  It's all I got in this world. Most important possession.
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:13.360]  You don't possess your children. They're the most important thing in my life.
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:20.360]  But my most important possession, not even my health, not my looks, not money.
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:25.360]  It's that if I say I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it or I'm going to try real hard to get it done.
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:30.360]  And if I can't get it done, I'm going to come to you and tell you why I couldn't.
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:37.360]  Because that's the kind of world I want to live in is where people do what they say they're going to do.
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:40.360]  Where people stand for what they stand for.
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:47.360]  So my children and your children have a future together around honorable people where we don't put up with corruption and lies.
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:52.360]  And when there is corruption and lies, it's at a very low level and dealt with.
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:57.360]  Because if you don't deal with corruption and evil, it will run wild.
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:05.360]  That's an absolute incontrovertible fact of common sense and common law and natural law in this universe.
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:10.360]  We're beginning to hit the bottom of a very deep, decadent, twisted, satanic cycle.
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:14.360]  It's happened in every other culture, every other cycle in history.
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:24.360]  But there's a compaction and acceleration to this because of technology and population and science.
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:30.360]  And so things are compressed, but they're also amplified.
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:37.360]  And that's why the real game of life isn't just having a bigger pool or a bigger house or trying to keep your wife or husband happy.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:40.360]  None of that's ever going to make you happy.
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:42.360]  What's going to make you happy is a purpose-driven life.
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:43.360]  And I know you know that.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:46.360]  And I was even reading CNN this morning as they tell the truth sometimes.
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:50.360]  And they were like, all Trump wants to do is overturn Washington.
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:52.360]  He's committed. It is true.
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:56.360]  Our sources say he's up at 6 a.m. at 7 a.m.
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:01.360]  in the Yellow Oval, as it's called, on the second floor.
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:02.360]  And he makes all the decisions.
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:10.360]  He makes a whole bunch of phone calls and reads documents in between watching television, Twitter, and surfing the Internet.
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:16.360]  And that everything he does is just insane commitment to doing what he said he'd do.
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:18.360]  So they oscillate between, he's crazy.
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.360]  He does what he says he's going to do.
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:21.360]  A promise keeper.
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:24.360]  Now that's crazy because it's not pragmatic with them.
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:26.360]  They don't compromise with them.
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.360]  They're not pragmatic. They're globalist.
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:36.360]  You can't be pragmatic with cancer or cyanide or jumping off a cliff, sticking your arm in a wood chipper.
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:40.360]  There's no pragmatic about it. It's a one-way street.
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:44.360]  And the president has to compromise some.
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:48.360]  He's not a dictator, despite what Senator Flakes says.
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:51.360]  We'll play that clip in a moment.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:56.360]  And so all he can do is fight back against their lies in real time
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:37:01.360]  and not just let them put out a big lie and lay there and take it and roll over to the media.
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:07.360]  Now in Hollywood, if someone makes an accusation, everyone piles on and says,
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:11.360]  well, I know that's true, even though I never saw it happen.
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:16.360]  And I think the person that reportedly did this is a horrible person.
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:19.360]  And then there's no evidence ever even given.
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:27.360]  And then it turns out the police will say about half of the rape cases or sexual assault cases you hear are made up.
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:35.360]  It doesn't lessen the real ones.
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:44.360]  But it just shows who's deploying this, who's pushing all this hysteria to cover up for the real stuff they're doing.
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:49.360]  I just saw Schwarzenegger, who's a famous groper.
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:53.360]  I wouldn't call him a rapist, but really pushes himself on people.
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.360]  He doesn't deny it. I don't know people that know him.
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.360]  I mean, the guy could have sex five times a day.
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:01.360]  And him and Will Chamberlain would have contests on the sets of movies.
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:04.360]  How many women they could have sex with, reportedly. Chamberlain talked about it.
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:08.360]  Sometimes 10, 15 women a day. Arnold couldn't do that, like Chamberlain could.
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:12.360]  Chamberlain said, I think he's had sex with like 10,000 women. People think that might be an exaggeration.
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:20.360]  I see Schwarzenegger out going condemning somebody from some movie 25, 30 years ago.
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:24.360]  Because the young woman who was 12 at the time makes the allegation.
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:26.360]  And then just instantly, it's absolutely true.
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:29.360]  And everybody turns on the guy and it may be true.
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:35.360]  The point is, is you say, well, this is terrible. I hope this isn't the case, but we need to investigate.
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:39.360]  No, when there's real pedophilia, died in the wool going on an industrial scale.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.360]  They hire people that are convicted pedophiles to run movies and be directors. Weinstein does.
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:48.360]  They protect them. They get caught raping kids and they get jobs again and nothing's done.
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:55.360]  They let Muslims rape kids and marry nine year old girls in the U.S. and in Canada and in Europe and no one gets in trouble.
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:39:01.360]  But then the very same left points their finger at you and says, if you ever touch a woman on her knee,
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:07.360]  or a woman hugs you when you touch her and her shirt comes up and you touch her back, you're fired.
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:09.360]  And it's meant to just be like, hey, don't hug.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:13.360]  Now they're saying high schoolers and people shouldn't hug or you can't have a best friend.
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:16.360]  First they get rid of dodgeball, then running, then, you know, all the rest of it.
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:22.360]  And then now, oh, we're getting rid of recess altogether and oh, you can't have best friends because that discriminates against somebody.
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:26.360]  That's a cult.
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:28.360]  I'm going to go to your phone calls when we come back.
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:31.360]  I'm going to just rampage through them. I'm going to go to Steve.
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.360]  I'm going to go to Natasha. I'm going to go to James, Kevin, Matt.
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:37.360]  I'm going to go bam, bam, bam.
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:41.360]  Your phone calls one after the other on the other side.
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:51.360]  But we are involved in the People's Choice 2017 Fake News Awards on this Wednesday, the 17th day of January, 2018.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:55.360]  There's a live feed on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:57.360]  Please share that link with everybody you know.
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:05.360]  Watch live the 2017 Fake News Awards hosted by President Trump.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:07.360]  And get on Twitter, get on Facebook.
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:09.360]  They're going to have the bots criticize you for it.
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:10.360]  So what? Move forward.
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:12.360]  A lot of the bots don't know what President Planet or News Wars is.
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:17.360]  If you want to get around them, you can send out a News Wars link.
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:23.360]  Tell people to tune in and tell them to tune in particularly at four o'clock when the president hosts his Fake News Awards.
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:24.360]  We're the People's Choice.
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:27.360]  We're going to see how that lines up with the president's choice.
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:33.360]  The guy that's really been hammered, who gets to therapeutically fire back his mainstream media admits in their own documents.
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.360]  They hope.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:35.360]  Gruber says it.
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:36.360]  WikiLeaks says it.
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:37.360]  Memory says you're dumb-effors.
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.360]  He was hired to triple prices on you.
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:40.360]  You're an idiot.
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:42.360]  All the professors sit around and learn how to lie.
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:43.360]  And he goes, this is how you lie.
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:45.360]  I will teach you how to take control and lie.
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.360]  I'm the best liar.
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:47.360]  And they're like, yes, sir, yes.
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:48.360]  You're amazing, sir.
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:52.360]  Seven speeches, talking about how he lies and how he hates you.
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:54.360]  Look it up yourself.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:57.360]  And their touchstone is you don't have a memory.
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.360]  Well, you do have a memory.
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:08.360]  And so Trump is going to bring back the last year of their whopper of lies that crossed over from 2016 to 2017.
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:12.360]  99% chance he's going to win.
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:22.360]  Newsweek, Time, CNN, New York Times, Adam President, already had him all printed up.
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:25.360]  The issue itself shows her victory night, giving the victory speech totally fake.
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:26.360]  You know she didn't win.
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.360]  You know she didn't have a victory speech that night.
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:29.360]  She wouldn't even show up.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:31.360]  She was throwing such a fit.
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:33.360]  Yeah, they had it at 99 at first.
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:41.360]  But by the night of it was forecast 98 on the New York Times, the Huffington Post, which is the George Soros post.
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:44.360]  Briefly, we have two new items.
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:47.360]  Immune wall that is incredible for everybody's immune system.

[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:16.360]  And I've never seen anything that's worked this good from my running nose, burning eyes, and all the rest of it with the seasonal discomfort and the seasonal issues.
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:18.360]  Seasonal discomfort that takes place.

[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:03.360]  Cell force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:07.360]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:09.360]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:14.360]  Cell force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria,
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:20.360]  much like a cellular engine overhaul because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency,
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:23.360]  then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:28.360]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage,
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:31.360]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:36.360]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:43.360]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:48.360]  Boost, protect, and adapt with cell force from info wars life.
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:55.360]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:59.360]  Matt and Ohio, you're on the air. Another Matt, go ahead.
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:04.360]  Hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of info wars,
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:09.360]  and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic,
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:14.360]  and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the info war.
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:21.360]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:27.360]  Well, thank you. My favorite new one is the don't tread on me, but said it says won't tread on me,
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:33.360]  and it's a big day glow snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, infowars.com on the right arm.
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:40.360]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:50.360]  And the newest one is trigger warning t-shirt. Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign in the infowars.com on the back.
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:47:05.360]  That is the new shirt of the mind, available exclusively at infowars.com.
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:38.360]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, and we've got live coverage of President Trump's first annual fake news awards that kicks off in, what, three hours and about 13 minutes?
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:45.360]  But ladies and gentlemen, we are going to be having live coverage of the people's choice right back to your phone calls in just a moment.
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:52.360]  We're taking quite a few of them. We're doing a pretty good job, and I want to move really quick now to get your examples of fake news uncensored.
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:58.360]  Maybe you think we did something that was wrong. We'd love to hear from you. The toll-free number to call in is 877-789-ALAKS.
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:03.360]  We've got about 30 people online here, but we'll get to you. 877-789-ALAKS.
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:07.360]  I want to play this clip one more time, because I didn't get to all of it earlier.
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:15.360]  This is Jeff Flake. His name fits. A Flake is a Flake by any other name. A Rose is a Rose by any other name.
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:25.360]  Continuing, really, the theme of the last two years of fake news. Russian collusion. I think that's the big fake news. I think that's what's going to win.
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:37.360]  Then you have to say, but what area? Saying that they had wiretapped the president. Then saying they had proof. Then saying they hadn't. Then leaking. Then lying about the leaking.
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:45.360]  Saying that all 17 agencies said Russia stole the election when none of them said it. What happened with, of course, General Flynn saying,
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:55.360]  Oh, look, it's come out ABC News. He admits they're all Russian agents. It's incredible devastation. He's going to testify. Perry Mason moment.
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:03.360]  Trump's going to jail. They're all going to prison. Yay. Yay. And the media all said that they're going to prison. That's it. The morning show. You're going to jail.
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:14.360]  Clearly, Russiagate has been the fake news. And the attempt to block the recovery has been a big part. And trying to steal the election and using fake polls and misquoting the president.
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:30.360]  And saying the president's racist, all of it goes together. But flake, you noticed yesterday is attacking the president because he knows that he is about to have the fake news awards saying criticizing the lying fake media back is like Stalin.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:41.360]  It's authoritarian. No. Having fake media lie about people owned by foreign corporations and authoritarian and laying down to it is what they want.
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:53.360]  The president criticizing media is not shutting media down. It's Obama and Hillary that wanted to shut down talk radio wanted to use the federal elections commission and the federal trade commission in hearings saying shut info wars down.
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:50:03.360]  They're the ones that are authoritarian. They're the ones that ideologically in the blue blood Republican and Democratic Party that want communism for the general public. They're the ones backing authoritarianism.
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:12.360]  They're the ones. So again, more fake news from Jeff leaving the Senate because he's a loser flake. Here it is.
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:22.360]  It is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Joseph Stalin to describe his enemies.
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:40.360]  It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase enemy of the people that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use. Telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of pausing and we the people is on the declaration of independence.
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:55.360]  In the preamble. It's in the Magna Carta from 1212 15 battle of running meat. Because communists use that term. Oh, now we can't.
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:51:04.360]  You see, you see the deception. Everything he says is a lie. Continue. Sorry, annihilating such individuals, unquote, who disagreed with a supreme leader.
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:19.360]  This alone should be the source of great shame for us in this body. The great leader. President Trump was elected. President Trump's a populist. Stalin was the opposite. Again, it's this narrative that he's a Russian.
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:21.360]  That's why they do this. Continue.
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:40.360]  Especially for those of us in the president's party, for they are shameful, repulsive statements. And of course, the president has it precisely backward. Despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despots enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy.
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:53.360]  Again, state run, global run, just like Hitler had a press that was run. And Stalin had a press. The idea that a press in general is the best thing since sliced bread. No, not when it's an authoritarian lying press. I mean, let it be there.
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:58.360]  We're not saying take it away from him. But again, he's inverting reality. Let's continue.
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:05.360]  When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn't suit him fake news. It is that person who should be.
[01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:19.360]  Because again, CNN invented or brought into use fake news, and they put it on myself, Trump and others. And the public just simply said the shoe fits on you. So they want to slug in the face. They want to dish it out, but they can't take it. Go back.
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:40.360]  Not the press. I dare say that anyone who has had the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of fake news are dubious at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas all around the globe and counter members.
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:51.360]  Let's pause again. Oh, like Brian Williams said, he got shot down on a helicopter like Hillary said she did. All lies. Oh, now we're against the troops, you see. I mean, who writes this crap? Let's continue.
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:53:03.360]  Media who risk their lives and sometimes lose their lives reporting on the truth to dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:12.360]  Okay, so Trump always says there are some good reporters in the New York Times are CNN and he always differentiates. But see, they lie.
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:23.360]  We're live right now, folks, breaking all their lives down. Let's go right back to your calls. Natasha. Natasha, you're on the air calling in from Arizona. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:33.360]  Yes. Well, no, she was just super nervous. She didn't want to talk to you, but she's on there. No, no, no. Don't let her be nervous. Just give her the phone. Go ahead.
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:47.360]  Well, she wants me to talk. This is from both of us. Our fake news award goes to fake tapper as CNN. It's the interview with John Brennan and Eric Clapper.
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:59.360]  And they pretty much called the president for saying he's colluded with the Russians. So that's right. We're talking about the one where they said 17 agencies unanimously told us and it was all a complete lie.
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:11.360]  It is fake tapper CNN. He's our nomination fake tapper. All right. Thank you so much. Yes. Jake tapper is right up there with Brian Stelter when it comes to truly deceptive people.
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:21.360]  Thank you, husband of Natasha. Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Steve in West Virginia. Steve, thank you for holding her on the air.
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:35.360]  Yes. Well, I know they're not mainstream media, but they have a big platform. They were constantly trying to demonize other platforms to make themselves look better than anybody else.
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:51.360]  They blight about you and Mr. Stone at the convention. They constantly push the narrative against the honorable president that he's racist because he wants to know who's entering this country from other war-torn countries.
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:57.360]  I don't want to, I can go on and on and on, but there's other collars. So I'm nominating young Turks.
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:08.360]  Well, you're absolutely right. They are state funded by Gulf states by Gulf dictatorships. They are force fed by Google, the Tantai free market, and they are a pack of liars in my view.
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:22.360]  And they are constantly caught in all sorts of behavior. And then young, the young Turk leader wrote that he believes women are genetically insufficient and have genetic problems, a classic Islamic view.
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:30.360]  And he names himself after the group that carried out the extermination of a million and a half Christian Armenians. What do you make of that?
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:52.360]  It's against Christians. You know, that's another example. Like I said, I can go on and on and on. But instead of trying to demonize these other medias like you, Drudge, Burotas, they want to demonize them. They want to be number one. Instead of trying to pull them together like you all do for a greater good for this country, they want to destroy it.
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:57.360]  It's like a globalist. They put the globalist agenda just as bad as anybody else out there does.
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:09.360]  No, I agree. They're probably, well, that would be an award of who's the worst, like not just who's the biggest liars, but who's the nastiest. Who's the most arrogant saying women are subhuman and Armenian genocide didn't happen.
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:16.360]  But we name ourselves after the group and saying anybody that calls somebody fat should be arrested and screaming. I'm a big fat piece of garbage.
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:23.360]  And then saying Roger Stone tried to storm the stage and implied that he broke into their warehouse when it was a public area for press that was let in.
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:30.360]  And Stone did not try to get on their stage. So yes, they are. And then they spit in my face and everything else and said that I did that.
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:36.360]  And then they had YouTube delete our video within minutes. They were on the YouTube stage. I made a big deal about it and they put it back up.
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:43.360]  That's the control just like Twitter gets in your personal stuff. The young Turks literally are jacked into Google. They're just.
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:50.360]  But again, how do you think this guy thinks he's better than you? Okay. He thinks he's going to capture your country. He thinks he runs you.
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:58.360]  But guess what? My friend, he doesn't anymore. Does he Steve? That's right. Well, you hit a daughter now head there. You take a better and I'll get to you for better and sit down.
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:04.360]  Well, I meant better. And if they sit down and wants that show, they would absolutely get angry.
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:10.360]  Well, I know this. I know this. I saw them with the next to Susie who got put in jail for nine months for getting his friends to make political contributions.
[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:17.360]  It didn't write the right paperwork. It's totally legal. Didn't follow that paperwork. Hillary got billions in illegal stuff.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:23.360]  And when he debated domestic Susie, the left and everybody in the room agreed and said, you need to go to prison. You're a criminal.
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:33.360]  They're like, basically you didn't go to jail long enough and then they defended Hillary. I mean, that's monstrous pig creatures who want to put a director in prison.
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:39.360]  He's as big as Michael Moore and he's conservative. Think about that. These are dangerous people that want to shut down our free speech.
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:48.360]  Stay with us. Hour number three straight ahead. Spread the live links. That's how we defeat the globalist.
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:16.360]  Natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times instead of containing fluoride.
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:25.360]  Our super blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand selected for their oral health benefits.
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:32.360]  Super blue fluoride free mouthwash and toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:39.360]  Xylitol, nano silver and iodine. Notice the difference with our super blue fluoride free products.

[01:59:50.360 --> 02:00:00.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:09.360]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:18.360]  We are getting the nominations right now for the People's Choice Fake News Awards 2017.
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:32.360]  Of course, we're less than a month into the new year. We're only a few days out, two and a half days out from the first anniversary of the inauguration of the really spectacular POTUS.
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:36.360]  The whole thing is just even more delicious.
[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:50.360]  And if you know behind the scenes how the president makes fun of himself and the orange hair and everything and the sense of humor and the doggedness to defeat the globalists and defeat them by bringing in prosperity and justice and the total commitment.
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:55.360]  They call that mental illness because he doesn't want to dominate the average person.
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:01:00.360]  He wants to dominate globalists, which is what a man really should want to do.
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:10.360]  He stands up for people. Doesn't mean he's perfect, but he has a soft spot for the average American and seen us screwed over and he's turning things around because it was artificially done.
[02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:14.360]  You're holding somebody underwater. Folks, you let them come up. They'll come up. Just like a beach ball.
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:21.360]  And Trump is letting the beach ball come up and they are crapping their britches because they're going to go to prison.
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:31.360]  They know is the Domino's fall. It's going to get worse. That's why they're fighting with their lives. If I fill muds on TV from the CIA saying, we're going to kill the president.
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:35.360]  Good luck. There's come back.
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:41.360]  All right. So this is a short segment, long segment coming up. I want to go to the calls down the order of who's been holding the longest.
[02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:44.360]  Who's been holding the longest here? That'd be James in Florida.
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:50.360]  And we'll go to Chris and we'll go to Frank and we'll go to Jason and everybody else in order here.
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:54.360]  Let's go ahead. What is your nomination, James?
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:58.360]  Well, first of all, I'd like to say happy new year to you and your crew.
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:03.360]  Thank you. You guys are outstanding. I have been listening now for a year and a half or so.
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:07.360]  Open my eyes to a whole new world of things and I appreciate that.
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:09.360]  We appreciate you, brother.
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:17.360]  Being a vet, it means a lot. I know you guys are out there and there's more of us out there fighting for this freedom.
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:23.360]  All right. The dossier is my nomination for fake news.
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:29.360]  I was going to say Fusion GPS, but then I realized it's a news organization we need.
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:37.360]  So I came up with CNN, Brian Stelter especially.
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:41.360]  Does Brian Stelter disgust you?
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:48.360]  I would say when I see him, I get bouts of stomach pains.
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:54.360]  His face to me looks like a, I don't know, I don't even want to go there.
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:58.360]  Exactly. We know what he looks like and they don't know we don't see him.
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:05.360]  How could anybody look at that and then here where it comes out of his mouth, you would never turn your back on him.
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:11.360]  All I know is if my kid ever went to a van, an ice cream van and he was driving.
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:18.360]  Yeah, there would be things happening in a not so good way for him.
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:23.360]  Oh boy. It's incredible, but we're going to get these fleas off our back.
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:25.360]  James, I think that's a great point. I appreciate you holding.
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:30.360]  I think a picture is appearing that the dossier and CNN promoting it.
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:35.360]  I mean, it came out of Buzzfeed, but it's emerging that CNN really is public enemy number one.
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:41.360]  People aren't even saying MSNBC. It's CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN,
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:45.360]  Humpty Dumpty, Humpty Dumpty, Brian Stelter.
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:48.360]  So thank you so much. I appreciate your call. Anything else?
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:55.360]  I just want to say that I just started taking your alpha power a couple of weeks ago and amazing.
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:57.360]  It's doing some good things for me.
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:00.360]  Was it as strong as I said, as it varies person to person?
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:06.360]  Well, like, yeah, I was actually hearing what you said and I was a little nervous to take it at first,
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:11.360]  but it didn't affect me like it seems to have affected you.
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:19.360]  I have really bad soft tissue issues in my knees and it seems to actually be helping that.
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:25.360]  And I feel stronger. I'm 41 years old, so it's definitely giving me more of a life back.
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:29.360]  Well, people ask, why do we have Anthroplex? Why do we have SuperMail? Why do we have alpha power?
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:34.360]  They're all different formulations and they work different for different people.
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:37.360]  I mean, that's like different brands of coffee, different brands of whiskey.
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:40.360]  I mean, I don't complain about whiskey, but, you know, they're different brands, different brands of car.
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:43.360]  Some of them are like a Dodge, we're like a Ford, some of them are like a Toyota.
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:47.360]  But yeah, I know this. The formulation is very, very strong.
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:49.360]  You're probably already pretty naturally amped up.
[02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:55.360]  If you've not been amped up, that's when you really, really feel it in the libido area. Thank you, sir.
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:59.360]  I'm so excited. The new product at m4warslife.com.
[02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:06.360]  In a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:12.360]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:15.360]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:21.360]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:27.360]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:31.360]  And I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers.
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:36.360]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:39.360]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:45.360]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:48.360]  It is amazing.
[02:05:48.360 --> 02:06:10.360]  Red pill now available at m4warsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:41.360]  You are dead smack right in the middle of the resistance right now.
[02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:47.360]  George Soros and the mainstream media and the big mega corporations and Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan,
[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:50.360]  they're now calling themselves the resistance to what we're doing.
[02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:54.360]  And the Davos group is just getting ready to meet the head of the Davos group.
[02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:57.360]  Stories up on m4wars.com right now.
[02:06:57.360 --> 02:06:59.360]  A Nobel Prize winner has come out and said,
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:04.360]  Trump is leading a global insurrection of populist nationalism, threatening global governance.
[02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:11.360]  And if he is able to convert the nation states into their own economic system, we are finished.
[02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:14.360]  Just like they said, if Hillary loses, it's the big domino.
[02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:17.360]  There may be no way to reverse our new world order.
[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:22.360]  That's in the high level globalist trade publications.
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:29.360]  That's what's so frustrating for me is they come right out folks and say they're going to set up a one world government,
[02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:35.360]  actuary everything to make humans obsolete, then make you get sterilized at first just to get government welfare,
[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:37.360]  but everybody's going to be basically on it.
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:38.360]  They're going to say everybody's dependent.
[02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:40.360]  They're going to make you dependent.
[02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:42.360]  And then they're just going to phase you out.
[02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:44.360]  And that's the end of humanity.
[02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:46.360]  People are like, that's crazy, Jones.
[02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:52.360]  Well, Elon Musk comes out and says it word for word because it's what they're doing.
[02:07:52.360 --> 02:08:02.360]  Elon Musk, Bill Joy, only a few other billionaire tech heads are warning you.
[02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:08.360]  I mean, John Harmon, my oldest producer still doesn't work for us.
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:16.360]  John Harmon was there when Roth Cop head of the Kissinger Group offered me a deal to come work for them.
[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:20.360]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, that wasn't an off the record offer.
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:21.360]  They just blurted it out.
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:22.360]  So I talk about it.
[02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:28.360]  The other offers, if it's off record and it's not criminal, I don't talk about off the record offers from big companies.
[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:33.360]  But I was offered Glenn Beck's job one year before I ever heard his name.
[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:38.360]  I said, I want you to move to LA or New York, maybe DC.
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:42.360]  You will get a million and a half dollars a year.
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:48.360]  There will be producers and you will do what they say when they say we will have editorial control, but you're going to be a star.
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:51.360]  And I heard this from local people right up to National.
[02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:55.360]  You want to be a star?
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:03.360]  Or do we continue to be on this failed crusade and then the money went up to 10 million dollars a year.
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:04.360]  Book deals.
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:06.360]  And they said, listen, you'll probably have a show on Fox.
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:08.360]  There'll be book deals, imprint deals.
[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:20.360]  They were looking for their Glenn Beck because they could see where the future was going and what we were trailblazing and what Drudge was trailblazing, what Ron Paul was trailblazing.
[02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:24.360]  And they could see there was going to be a movement against this, but they thought we'll just buy it up.
[02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:26.360]  Guess what?
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:31.360]  I didn't take your Benjamin's baby.
[02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:43.360]  I didn't take the safe path to curl up under your evil wings and let you vomit into my mouth like I was an evil baby bird stolen loot you got from other people.
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:46.360]  I'm my own man.
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:55.360]  They'll come back in the next segment with Elvis is my way because that's what America is all about.
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:00.360]  It isn't about how rich you are, how cool you are, some, you know, some, some big fancy pants thing.
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:03.360]  It's about what you do as a rugged individualist.
[02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:09.360]  And I'm not saying I'm the perfect person, but man, a global diabolical plan for world authoritarianism.
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:13.360]  I grew up reading about, you know, World War II and my grandpa's in it and everything.
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:16.360]  And that's what bad guys do. We're going to kick their butt.
[02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:18.360]  Doesn't mean America is perfect either.
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:23.360]  But, you know, I wasn't going to go along with this and that's all we're doing.
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:29.360]  And we are changing the world and they admit we're right and they fear us.
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:39.360]  The globalists, the Democrats on the Democratic side of the aisle at the House Intelligence and the Senate Intelligence and the House Armed Services Committee and the telecommunications committees.
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:44.360]  They're in there saying we want Alex Jones shut down.
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:46.360]  We want Paul Watson shut down.
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:48.360]  Shall I play the videos again?
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:50.360]  Four hearings in the last year.
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:57.360]  Other people don't get named other than Drudge.
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:11:04.360]  They say we want the Federal Elections Commission, the Federal Trade Commission to shut him down.
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:11.360]  They have FCC hearings where you got half the commission calling for it.
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:17.360]  But the chairman's got a power to veto if it's not a clear majority.
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:24.360]  We're that close to them shutting us down and sending federal regulators in here to shut the lights off, okay?
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:31.360]  And then they got flake up there on television with the nerve to point his finger at Trump and say he criticizes the press.
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:37.360]  He's a dictator for calling it fake news when they say horrible lies about him and unnamed sources.
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:47.360]  President Trump, if he defends himself against this darling of the globalists, this follower, this little boy.
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:49.360]  Yeah, flake is a flake.
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:52.360]  He took the money.
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:57.360]  And it's still never going to change the fact that his soul's crooked just like that nose is.
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:02.360]  He looks like he got hit in the side of the head with a shovel.
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:03.360]  I don't usually type it for how they look.
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:07.360]  It's just you can't help it.
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:14.360]  I guess it looks like a directional sign or something.
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:15.360]  That's troll in the media.
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:17.360]  That'll get picked up.
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:22.360]  Jones makes fun of Jeff Flake's nose.
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:31.360]  No, Jeff Flake is a telling sycophantic softice because he doesn't come up with his own stuff.
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:33.360]  Back with the Russian narrative.
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:41.360]  Now, Trump isn't in the back pocket or isn't the, you know what, holster, as Stephen Colbert said, a Putin.
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:45.360]  No, no, no, he is Stalin.
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:48.360]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:50.360]  Frank, I got to go quick now.
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:51.360]  I'm sorry.
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:52.360]  Frank in North Carolina.
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:53.360]  Thanks for holding so long.
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:56.360]  I think it's emerging that Russia gate and the dossiers yet.
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:12:57.360]  Go ahead.
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:00.360]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:03.360]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:05.360]  It just gets old, man.
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:07.360]  I'm going to shut you down right now.
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:10.360]  Okay, we're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:15.360]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down behind the scenes?
[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:17.360]  They've sued me now eight times.
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:18.360]  They're trying to shut us down.
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:21.360]  They're having congressional hearings saying shut us down.
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:24.360]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:26.360]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:32.360]  It's like saying Colonel Travis at the Alamo sending a letter saying we need help is bragging.
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:35.360]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:38.360]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:40.360]  You know what, Alex?
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:41.360]  I put him on pause again.
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:46.360]  Hey, Frank, I just talked about drugs too.
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:50.360]  They have one vote away.
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:59.360]  They called for criminal charges against me at the Federal Elections Commission and the Federal Trade Commission.
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:04.360]  And I'm under FBI espionage investigation for working with Russia.
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:06.360]  I didn't do that.
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:11.360]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:16.360]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:19.360]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:21.360]  Do you understand I need your help, Frank?
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:23.360]  I need your help, Frank.
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:24.360]  They're censoring us.
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:25.360]  They're blocking our advertising.
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:27.360]  They're blowing us up.
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:30.360]  Do you understand I need your help, Frank?
[02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:32.360]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:35.360]  So I'm sorry if I'm mad at you, man, but it ain't bragging, bro.
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:36.360]  It's asking for help.
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:38.360]  Do you understand that?
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:41.360]  You keep saying they, who is they?
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:49.360]  Congressman Quigley, the board of governors of the FCC, you can pull up their names.
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:52.360]  You can pull them up.
[02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:53.360]  Say God.
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:54.360]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:56.360]  You've been calling in for 10 years or so.
[02:14:56.360 --> 02:14:58.360]  I've probably played these clips 30 times the last few months.
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:14:59.360]  You want me to play them again?
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:01.360]  Are you saying they aren't real?
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:07.360]  I'm saying you'll never talk about who's at who they are.
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:10.360]  Powerful global corporations that have hijacked this country.
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:13.360]  How come almost all of them are Jewish?
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:15.360]  Oh, well then why is Matt Drudge?
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:19.360]  They're trying to shut down who's Jewish.
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:22.360]  Well, I mean, you know, there are a few things.
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:25.360]  Why are they trying to arrest Benjamin Netanyahu?
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:29.360]  And why is Netanyahu trying to back an American recovery right now?
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:31.360]  I don't buy that at all.
[02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:36.360]  That's some kind of inside, that's some kind of inside fight going on there.
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:39.360]  Frank, I wanted to know what you think the,
[02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:41.360]  because if I let you do this and everybody will do it,
[02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:43.360]  I want to, so we're actually getting to some calls today, Frank.
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:45.360]  But I want to hear your fake news awards.
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:47.360]  You want to give it to me, that's fine.
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:49.360]  But let's come back and I'll give you 60 seconds.
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:16:15.360]  Unbelievable.

[02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:38.360]  If you owe more than 10,000 in taxes,

[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:01.360]  Are you happy paying high prices?

[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:40.360]  infowarslife.com or triple-A-253-3139.
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:42.360]  And your purchase of the products stands with us,
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:44.360]  stands with America, stands with Trump,
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:47.360]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:50.360]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are,
[02:19:50.360 --> 02:20:18.360]  and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[02:20:18.360 --> 02:20:29.360]  I want to stand.
[02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:30.360]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:32.360]  We're right in the middle of the People's Choice
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:35.360]  Fake News Awards 2017.
[02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:41.360]  The president seven days ago punted and moved the awards
[02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:44.360]  ceremony back to today at 4 p.m. central.
[02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:46.360]  Now, we don't know because New York Daily News
[02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:48.360]  is fake news most of the time.
[02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:51.360]  They've written incredible lies about yours truly.
[02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:53.360]  But no one in the White House,
[02:20:53.360 --> 02:20:55.360]  they're trying to keep the president from speaking.
[02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:57.360]  They're trying to keep him intimidated.
[02:20:57.360 --> 02:20:59.360]  Not saying Sanders is, but a lot of them are.
[02:20:59.360 --> 02:21:01.360]  Because Jeff Flake came out and said,
[02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:03.360]  the president, if he has an awards ceremony,
[02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:06.360]  pointing out lies of the media, why, that's Stalin.
[02:21:06.360 --> 02:21:08.360]  And so New York Daily News says,
[02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:10.360]  after Jeff Flake's powerful speech
[02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:13.360]  that no one even attended in the Senate Hall,
[02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:16.360]  it looks like Trump may cancel it.
[02:21:16.360 --> 02:21:18.360]  Yes, fake news awards.
[02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:19.360]  This is probably fake news.
[02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:22.360]  Absent from Trump's White House schedule,
[02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:24.360]  dismissed as potential event.
[02:21:24.360 --> 02:21:26.360]  President Trump's so-called fake news awards
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:29.360]  were up in the air on the eve of the bizarre celebration.
[02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:31.360]  Oh, the bizarre celebration of journalists
[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:33.360]  at odds with the White House rhetoric, no?
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:35.360]  It's showing how you're liars.
[02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:36.360]  Showing where you did it.
[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:38.360]  Showing how you're wrong.
[02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:40.360]  Showing how your Russian narrative fell apart into total lies.
[02:21:40.360 --> 02:21:42.360]  When asked about the ceremony, Tuesday afternoon,
[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:44.360]  President Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders
[02:21:44.360 --> 02:21:48.360]  dismissed Trump's awards as a potential event.
[02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:50.360]  By nightfall, the mysterious awards are absent
[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:52.360]  from the president's public schedule today.
[02:21:52.360 --> 02:21:54.360]  Sanders told White House reporters
[02:21:54.360 --> 02:21:58.360]  she would divulge details of the awards.
[02:21:58.360 --> 02:22:00.360]  At an unspecified time.
[02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:02.360]  So we don't know, because I mean,
[02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:04.360]  the president always does what he says
[02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:05.360]  unless they try to block it.
[02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:07.360]  He initially scheduled the awards in January 8th
[02:22:07.360 --> 02:22:09.360]  before pushing back the event in January 17th.
[02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:11.360]  Senator Jeff Flake has planned a Senate floor speech
[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:12.360]  which he did.
[02:22:12.360 --> 02:22:14.360]  Okay, so let's just go to the search engine,
[02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:15.360]  type in fake news awards,
[02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:17.360]  and let's see what the very latest does for me.
[02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:19.360]  Thank you.
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:21.360]  But it doesn't matter,
[02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:23.360]  because you're calling in with your fake news awards
[02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:25.360]  and we've got the cash prizes coming up,
[02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:28.360]  and we're going to go right through and do it ourselves.
[02:22:28.360 --> 02:22:30.360]  See how that happens?
[02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:33.360]  One way or another,
[02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:36.360]  I'm going to get you, get you, get you, get you, get you.
[02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:39.360]  One way or another,
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:41.360]  not going away, not stopping,
[02:22:41.360 --> 02:22:44.360]  and they fight to keep him from his fireside chats.
[02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:46.360]  They fight to keep him from going out and giving speeches.
[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:48.360]  They fight to keep him up his Twitter,
[02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:50.360]  because all the media tells them,
[02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:53.360]  don't do that and we'll be nice to you.
[02:22:53.360 --> 02:22:55.360]  Just like in Saving Private Ryan,
[02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:57.360]  where the soldier convinces the guy to stop fighting
[02:22:57.360 --> 02:22:59.360]  and then he gets to stab him.
[02:22:59.360 --> 02:23:01.360]  No, we're not going to stop.
[02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:03.360]  We're going to go on to the end, whatever the cost may be.
[02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:06.360]  All right, Frank, go ahead and finish your point.
[02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:08.360]  North Carolina.
[02:23:08.360 --> 02:23:10.360]  Yeah, thanks for the 60 seconds, Alex.
[02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:14.360]  The obvious, longest-running fake news story of 2017 for me
[02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:16.360]  is Russiagate.
[02:23:16.360 --> 02:23:18.360]  But I would, I gotta say though,
[02:23:18.360 --> 02:23:21.360]  if any foreign state has a criminal level of influence
[02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:23.360]  over U.S. elections, it's Israel.
[02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:24.360]  That's the deep state.
[02:23:24.360 --> 02:23:25.360]  It's Zog.
[02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:29.360]  It's Israel and it's agents in the media of the United States,
[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:31.360]  mainstream media and in the government.
[02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:33.360]  They're the ones that have criminal,
[02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:37.360]  the criminal level of influence over our elections.
[02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:38.360]  Not Russia.
[02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:39.360]  And you know, it's funny.
[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:43.360]  All these Jews were fine with Russia and the communism
[02:23:43.360 --> 02:23:44.360]  and all that hell.
[02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:47.360]  Bernie Sanders took his wife there for their honeymoon
[02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:50.360]  because that's where he felt most comfortable.
[02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:52.360]  I don't understand why all these American,
[02:23:52.360 --> 02:23:55.360]  these young Americans think Bernie Sanders is some big hero.
[02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:57.360]  He's a freaking commie.
[02:23:57.360 --> 02:24:00.360]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[02:24:00.360 --> 02:24:01.360]  Here's the deal.
[02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:03.360]  Israel is a diverse political system.
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:05.360]  There is clearly an Israel lobby
[02:24:05.360 --> 02:24:07.360]  that is heavily involved getting our defense secrets
[02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:09.360]  and selling it to China.
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:11.360]  I've had guests on even last week about that.
[02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:13.360]  It's a serious issue.
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:15.360]  My problem with the anti-Israel crowd is
[02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:17.360]  is it's so tunnel-visioned
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:19.360]  and never talks about anything else.
[02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:21.360]  This is breaking news.
[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:25.360]  Infowars.com, Project Veritas, new video.
[02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:27.360]  We told you it was coming.
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:30.360]  James O'Keefe exposes Twitter ban users
[02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:33.360]  pressured from the communist Chinese government.
[02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:37.360]  That video is coming up after I've taken more calls.
[02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:40.360]  And then we have the article from the Washington Post
[02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:42.360]  finally telling the truth a few days ago
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:44.360]  where they come out and admit
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:46.360]  that major universities have basically been taken over
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:48.360]  by the Chinese communist government.
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:50.360]  Let me tell you who took over Hollywood,
[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:51.360]  the communist Chinese.
[02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:53.360]  Let me tell you who took over
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:55.360]  a lot of the Fortune 100, the communist Chinese.
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:58.360]  Let me tell you who's got 97% of rare earth's minerals,
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:01.360]  the communist Chinese.
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:03.360]  Let me tell you who the biggest group of immigrants
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:07.360]  are here now, Chinese women to have their babies for free.
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:11.360]  China is screwing us so hard it makes my head spin.
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:15.360]  And the anti-Israel crowd
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:18.360]  have a lot more credibility with me
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:21.360]  if they talked about the commie pope pushing world government
[02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:23.360]  or they talked about the communist Chinese or any of that.
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:26.360]  But it's always the same thing, man.
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:29.360]  And then they attribute magical powers to Jews
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:32.360]  and then I'm run by Jews and all that stuff.
[02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:35.360]  And then I volunteer things
[02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:39.360]  like my ex-wife's mother was half Jewish.
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:41.360]  And it turns into
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:45.360]  and my ex-wife doesn't practice Judaism, she's a Christian.
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:47.360]  And then I'm supposedly going to go to Israel
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:50.360]  because I work for them and I'm a Jewish person
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:52.360]  and it's just crazy.
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:54.360]  If I was Jewish, I'd be proud of it.
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:56.360]  But it's just craziness, man.
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:58.360]  And then they were like, look at my sponsors and go,
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:00.360]  that's a Jew, that's a Jew.
[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:02.360]  And almost none of them were even Jewish.
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:04.360]  But if they had a German last name, they were all Jews.
[02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:06.360]  It's the craziest.
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:09.360]  The Nazis say Jones is a Jewish last name.
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:12.360]  I guess there have been Jews before that have taken that name.
[02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:15.360]  But I mean, it's just mental illness and I'm not into it.
[02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:17.360]  I'm not against the Chinese people.
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:19.360]  People say, oh, you're against Chinese.
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:21.360]  You're against the communist Chinese.
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:23.360]  No, I'm against Chinese. They're out of control.
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:25.360]  Chinese government.
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:30.360]  China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China.
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:33.360]  And has Israel, to some extent,
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:36.360]  sold us out to China? You bet your boots Israel has
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:38.360]  and so is our own government. It's wrong.
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:40.360]  But it doesn't mean I'm foaming at the mouth
[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:43.360]  and I get the leftist press calling me anti-Semite all the time
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:46.360]  and I criticize George Soros for being a Nazi collaborator.
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:48.360]  They say it's anti-Semitic. It's a joke.
[02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:50.360]  I get the left beats people over the head with that.
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:53.360]  I get there's a lot of arrogant folks in Hollywood, you know,
[02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:55.360]  they're doing stuff, but it's just,
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:59.360]  it is not the whole shooting match there, brother.
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:01.360]  Yeah, there's an article.
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:03.360]  Chinese buying up large chunks of land across America.
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:06.360]  They own the majority of our debt on and on and on.
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:08.360]  Are people like Lloyd Blank fine though?
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:10.360]  Cheerleading against America?
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:13.360]  In common is China saying you'll never come back America.
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:16.360]  We're investing in China. Yeah.
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:21.360]  So is Lloyd Blank fine saying he's anti-American? Absolutely.
[02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:24.360]  So, you know, we just report the facts here, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:29.360]  and I want a big tent for people that are non-radical Islamists,
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:33.360]  Jews, Christians, agnostics, atheists, animists, whatever.
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:36.360]  These people, if you want free market, I like it.
[02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:38.360]  If you want to have a free society, I like it.
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:41.360]  Speaking of free society, we're funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:44.360]  The network, you know, has sponsors and stuff like that,
[02:27:44.360 --> 02:27:46.360]  but that wouldn't finance what we've built here.
[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:52.360]  And infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or AAA-2533139.
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:55.360]  We had 60 plus things, you know, a few weeks ago for 50% off,
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:27:57.360]  but most of them sold out.
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:00.360]  But our best sellers are still in because we order so much of it,
[02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:02.360]  but they're getting close.
[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:05.360]  50% off secret 12, the highest quality of item B12 from our research.
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:08.360]  Third party group's tested, said it's the best out there.

[02:33:28.360 --> 02:33:30.360]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[02:33:30.360 --> 02:33:32.360]  you are the resistance.
[02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:35.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:37.360]  All right, we are back live.
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:40.360]  Look, remember a week and a half ago,
[02:33:40.360 --> 02:33:43.360]  Trump was lying, he was going to bring in DACA
[02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:45.360]  and legalize 40 million people
[02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:47.360]  and let people bring in their 14th cousins
[02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:49.360]  and he was a total fraudster and evil
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:51.360]  and none of that was true.
[02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:53.360]  The DACA was not reasonable.
[02:33:53.360 --> 02:33:55.360]  It wasn't what he said during the campaign trail.
[02:33:55.360 --> 02:33:57.360]  A vetted people that have been there for a long time
[02:33:57.360 --> 02:33:59.360]  that are contributing members of society.
[02:33:59.360 --> 02:34:01.360]  You can't bring in, you know,
[02:34:01.360 --> 02:34:03.360]  even your first cousins, you just bring in direct family.
[02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:05.360]  He was trying to do something more reasonable.
[02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:07.360]  Give those folks a path, not direct instant,
[02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:10.360]  like Obama was doing, just totally opening the borders.
[02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:12.360]  And they said on the conservative news
[02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:15.360]  and the fake news, the mainstream news,
[02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:17.360]  they said that he had betrayed everybody
[02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:20.360]  and then he didn't.
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:22.360]  But this is a little more ominous
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:24.360]  because we haven't heard anything from Sarah Huckabee Sanders
[02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:26.360]  yesterday or today. She said it's a potential event.
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:28.360]  It was going to be held at four o'clock today.
[02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:30.360]  That's in like two and a half hours,
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:32.360]  two hours, 25 minutes.
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:35.360]  And now they're saying, well, maybe he's going to cancel it
[02:34:35.360 --> 02:34:39.360]  because Jeff Flake said he's like Stalin
[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:41.360]  if he attacks the news
[02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:43.360]  and this isn't very presidential.
[02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:45.360]  If that's the case, whoever's advising the president
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:47.360]  is an idiot.
[02:34:47.360 --> 02:34:49.360]  Because you can see where this is going.
[02:34:49.360 --> 02:34:51.360]  They're going to say the fake news
[02:34:51.360 --> 02:34:54.360]  is that he said he was going to have fake news awards.
[02:34:54.360 --> 02:34:57.360]  They're not going to say, oh, look, he was a nice guy.
[02:34:57.360 --> 02:35:01.360]  They're going to say he couldn't even find any fake news.
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:03.360]  He couldn't even come up with anything
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:06.360]  because we've never made a mistake and we've never lied,
[02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:08.360]  even though it's in all the WikiLeaks
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:10.360]  that we lie to you on purpose every day.
[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:17.360]  So you think about that.
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:22.360]  Trump's fake news awards are shaping up to be a total flop,
[02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:26.360]  says the fake news king's Jeff Bezos owned.
[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:28.360]  Washington Post.
[02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:30.360]  Finally, the fake news awards.
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:34.360]  Here's how Trump can win big or lose big lead.
[02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:36.360]  That's out of Forbes.
[02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:39.360]  Are the fake news awards just fake news?
[02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:41.360]  Why now?
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:43.360]  Teased Wednesday's ceremony for weeks,
[02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:48.360]  but now it's just a potential event.
[02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:50.360]  You know, Trump met with the New York Times
[02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:52.360]  two, three weeks ago, two and a half weeks ago
[02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:54.360]  and more long ago and said we're going to make a deal.
[02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:56.360]  Let's work together for the better of the country.
[02:35:56.360 --> 02:35:58.360]  Let's have that honeymoon period.
[02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:00.360]  You normally get the first 200 days that this president ever got.
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:02.360]  Come on, admit you're beaten.
[02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:04.360]  It's hurting you politically to keep coming after me.
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:05.360]  The stock market's back.
[02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:07.360]  Black unemployment's the lowest ever.
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:10.360]  Are the veterans on and on and on increasing their pay?
[02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:12.360]  Can you just...
[02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:14.360]  And they reportedly, as I said back then,
[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:17.360]  said we've capitulated you're right, we're going to stop.
[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:19.360]  And it's all lies.
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:22.360]  They've stopped nothing, nothing.
[02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:26.360]  So who knows if this is true out of the likes of the Washington Post
[02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:31.360]  and New York Daily News and the rest of it?
[02:36:31.360 --> 02:36:33.360]  I mean, who knows?
[02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:35.360]  Because New York Daily News says that I say
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:37.360]  there's Martian bases with slave children.
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:39.360]  There's no video, there's no audio, I never wrote it.
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:40.360]  It's total.
[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:42.360]  I mean, it's like saying New York Daily News says
[02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:43.360]  there's Martian slave children.
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:44.360]  It's not true either.
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:46.360]  So they're a pack of line scum.
[02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:47.360]  Does it mean they tell the truth?
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:49.360]  Sometimes fine, but here's the deal.
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:51.360]  We're doing the fake news awards.
[02:36:51.360 --> 02:36:53.360]  The People's Choice taking your phone calls,
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:55.360]  collating them right up to four today.
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:56.360]  And if he doesn't have that press conference,
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:36:58.360]  I know they got a bunch of clips lined up
[02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:00.360]  of the big lies of 2017.
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:03.360]  We're going to play those clips, talk about your nominations,
[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:07.360]  have the award $2,000 first place, $1,000 second place,
[02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:10.360]  set a steak knife third place to have fun,
[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:12.360]  pointing out the lies that they hope you forget about.
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:14.360]  That's why this is so critical.
[02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:15.360]  It's why they hate it.
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:17.360]  And if Trump doesn't do this, it could be
[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:19.360]  because there's some secret North Korean nuke strike
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:21.360]  test about to happen.
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:23.360]  And they said, sir, it's too serious.
[02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:24.360]  You know, we can't do that today.
[02:37:24.360 --> 02:37:26.360]  And I'm telling you, if that's what it is,
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:29.360]  if Trump isn't doing this, it's because of too serious
[02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:33.360]  of stuff that's been going on.
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:34.360]  And they're coming to him saying, sir,
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:35.360]  we need you in the situation room.
[02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:37.360]  Because that's how they're managing him.
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:39.360]  But he's so used to stress, he's saying,
[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:40.360]  I have 18 hours a day.
[02:37:40.360 --> 02:37:41.360]  He's able to handle it.
[02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:42.360]  Okay, bam, bam, bam.
[02:37:42.360 --> 02:37:43.360]  We're going to your calls now.
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:45.360]  I'm going to go to all these calls for the hour ends.
[02:37:45.360 --> 02:37:48.360]  Who's been holding Jason the longest and John?
[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:55.360]  No, Chris, Mad Christian, Kevin, and then Mike.
[02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:57.360]  I'm getting to all of you first right now.
[02:37:57.360 --> 02:37:58.360]  Jason, thanks for holding you're a trooper.
[02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:01.360]  From California, thank you for holding.
[02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:03.360]  Alex, it's a privilege.
[02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:05.360]  Thank you for what you do.
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:06.360]  Thank you, brother.
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:08.360]  The biggest fake news story has got to be
[02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:10.360]  that President Trump is a racist.
[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:13.360]  This is pushed by all the fake news networks.
[02:38:13.360 --> 02:38:16.360]  But I would have to say that Don Lemon and CNN
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:17.360]  has got to be the worst.
[02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:20.360]  He has no remorse for his race-baiting life.
[02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:23.360]  And I want you to think about before he announced
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:24.360]  his intention to run.
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:27.360]  There was no hint of any racism from him.
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:30.360]  His golf courses were some of the first to be inclusive.
[02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:33.360]  His friends and celebrities were of all races
[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:34.360]  and all backgrounds.
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:36.360]  He had that woman, that homeless woman,
[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:39.360]  living in Trump Tower that many didn't talk about.
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:40.360]  How about Haiti?
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:43.360]  We just found out that he helped Rand Paul go to Haiti
[02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:45.360]  to give vision to a bunch of children down there.
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:48.360]  But from the very beginning, in his very first announcement,
[02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:50.360]  they misquoted his words to say that all Mexicans
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:52.360]  were killers and rapists.
[02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:54.360]  But anyone could go to the video and see for themselves
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:57.360]  that that was not what he said.
[02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:00.360]  But they still pushed it and they still do today.
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:02.360]  Well, the proof's in the pudding.
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:05.360]  What about the lowest black unemployment ever recorded
[02:39:05.360 --> 02:39:06.360]  in less than one year?
[02:39:06.360 --> 02:39:09.360]  That is miraculous.
[02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:13.360]  Oh, you know, they can't keep up with what he's getting done.
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:15.360]  You know, you go back to a year ago
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:17.360]  and what we were hoping he would get through.
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:19.360]  You remember we would say if he gets 15% of this pushed,
[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:21.360]  then that's a success.
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:25.360]  I think he's way past that already in his first year.
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:26.360]  You're right, Jason.
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:28.360]  We're going to put you on hold and get your info
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:30.360]  because you're in the running for nominating
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:32.360]  one of the key proven fake news stories.
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:34.360]  So that's not number one.
[02:39:34.360 --> 02:39:35.360]  That's number two.
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:36.360]  But we'll see.
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:37.360]  Let's keep talking to everybody.
[02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:38.360]  Thank you, Jason.
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:40.360]  Let's go to John in Ohio.
[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:44.360]  Thank you for holding so patiently, John.
[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:45.360]  Hello?
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:47.360]  Yes, sir. Go ahead.
[02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:49.360]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:50.360]  Good, brother.
[02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:52.360]  I don't know if it's a story.
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:53.360]  I don't think it's.
[02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:58.360]  I'm going to go with the DNC staffer Seth Rich.
[02:39:58.360 --> 02:39:59.360]  Oh, sure.
[02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:00.360]  And how they said that.
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:01.360]  Oh, he didn't really work for us.
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:02.360]  Oh, or he wasn't murdered.
[02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:04.360]  He was shot in the back, but it was no big deal.
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:06.360]  And, you know, he's not the leaker,
[02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:08.360]  but what he looks basically says it is.
[02:40:08.360 --> 02:40:10.360]  I mean, there's a bunch of stuff though,
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:12.360]  said it's basically been proven that, you know,
[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:16.360]  it was the information was leaked, not hacked by Russia.
[02:40:16.360 --> 02:40:18.360]  And, you know, that's basically one of the,
[02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:21.360]  I've heard Russia all night about how that's one of the top stories.
[02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:22.360]  Well, I mean, I think.
[02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:23.360]  No, you're right.
[02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:25.360]  Again, Russiagate is whatever is what 90% of people are saying.
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:26.360]  And I tend to agree.
[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:28.360]  And then inside of Russiagate,
[02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:31.360]  what particular news item was the most fake?
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:35.360]  And you're saying the fact that they said it was a Russian hack
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:38.360]  when the evidence shows now top forensic experts,
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:42.360]  former head of the NSA and others say it was an inside job.
[02:40:42.360 --> 02:40:44.360]  Yeah, I've been proven that it was,
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:47.360]  it was a leaked document physically leaked, you know,
[02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:49.360]  from a USB driver, something like that.
[02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:50.360]  It wasn't a hack.
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:51.360]  Russia didn't have it.
[02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:52.360]  Sure.
[02:40:52.360 --> 02:40:53.360]  And that's a big part of the Russiagate.
[02:40:53.360 --> 02:40:56.360]  Let's put you in the running within the whole Russiagate situation.
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:40:58.360]  And again, people, we know Russiagate's fake.
[02:40:58.360 --> 02:41:02.360]  We're bringing all this up to remember all the things they lied about
[02:41:02.360 --> 02:41:04.360]  so that they know we're watching.
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:05.360]  They hate this more than anything.
[02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:07.360]  This is what they count on us not doing.
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:08.360]  Great points.
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:09.360]  Okay.
[02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:10.360]  Who's up next here?
[02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:12.360]  Let's go to Chris in Virginia.
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:14.360]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:16.360]  Hey, Chris in Virginia.
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:17.360]  Chris in Virginia.
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:18.360]  Welcome.
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:21.360]  Yeah, I was going to go with a fusion GPS,
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:27.360]  but I had to think about it in terms of the spirit of fake news.
[02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:30.360]  So I went with Buzzfeed because in the end of the day,
[02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:32.360]  Buzzfeed is probably just going to lose money.
[02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:34.360]  Other people, because of what they did,
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:37.360]  but we're going to find out what's eventually going to come out in the end.
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:39.360]  Other people may go to jail behind it.
[02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:41.360]  Buzzfeed may get off with just losing money
[02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:44.360]  because they published this fake document.
[02:41:44.360 --> 02:41:49.360]  I personally experienced Buzzfeed tell whole lies about my custody trial
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:52.360]  with my children and work to have me lose my children.
[02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:55.360]  I mean, these are monstrous people.
[02:41:55.360 --> 02:42:01.360]  Yeah, they're monsters, but they're only going to lose money.
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:04.360]  We know that this stuff is made up
[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:07.360]  and look at all the stuff that's happened because of it.
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:10.360]  Trump is handicapped on foreign policy
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:13.360]  when it comes to Russia and other things around the world.
[02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:19.360]  Congressional hearings, investigations, blah, blah, blah,
[02:42:19.360 --> 02:42:23.360]  just that other people standing up trying to stream Russia all over the place.
[02:42:23.360 --> 02:42:25.360]  And in the end of the day, it was from a made-up document.
[02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:27.360]  Chris, don't hang up. Your points are too good.
[02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:30.360]  I want to come back and give you a few minutes because you're really on target.
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:33.360]  What is the damage fake news has done?
[02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:36.360]  We laugh about it and everything because it's important to expose it, but you're right.
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:42.360]  How much better would things be a year later if, wow, I just got chills thinking about that
[02:42:42.360 --> 02:42:46.360]  because I'm looking at things positively, but think about all the bad they did
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:48.360]  and all the, ugh, I'm getting chills.
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:51.360]  It makes me sick how bad these people are.
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:43:13.360]  They're robbing all of us in our future.
[02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:58.360]  Feel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by Infowars Life.
[02:43:58.360 --> 02:44:01.360]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process
[02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:06.360]  and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:11.360]  They also help prevent discomfort from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:14.360]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:18.360]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:21.360]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:25.360]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:28.360]  and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets.
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:32.360]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability
[02:44:32.360 --> 02:44:36.360]  and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:41.360]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates
[02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:44.360]  so you can fully digest all types of meals.

[02:46:58.360 --> 02:47:06.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:06.360 --> 02:47:19.360]  Regrets, I've had a few, but then again, too few to mention.
[02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:32.360]  I did what I had to do, saw it through without exemption.
[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:45.360]  I planned each chartered course, each careful step along the byway.
[02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:56.360]  And more, much more than this, I did it my way.
[02:47:56.360 --> 02:48:03.360]  Bye bye, Madam President, fake news, America's coming roaring back.
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:09.360]  We got the boot off our neck, blood's getting back to our brain.
[02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:20.360]  All you globalists like Brian Stelzer, you can go right back to hell where you came from.
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:26.360]  This is Frank Sinatra that originally did my way, but I was thinking of the Elvis rendition of that.
[02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:31.360]  I love Frank Sinatra, too.
[02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:35.360]  Frank Sinatra, my way.
[02:48:35.360 --> 02:48:41.360]  And Trump is definitely doing it his way, and just the delivery is insane.
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:47.360]  I'm always trying to be positive, because positive things are happening, but imagine what has been held up.
[02:48:47.360 --> 02:48:50.360]  Imagine what they have blocked, imagine what they're getting in the way of it.
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:54.360]  Imagine if they're successful, what they're going to do.
[02:48:54.360 --> 02:48:57.360]  That was a great point, Chris. Please continue.
[02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:05.360]  I'll say we're at a point now where Trump is, he's still getting more power of the government.
[02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:10.360]  And by having everybody talking about the fake news, it keeps damaging the fake news,
[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:15.360]  because they have to keep talking about it themselves and keep trying to stand theirself up.
[02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:18.360]  And they're missing the point about what Trump's doing with the economy.
[02:49:18.360 --> 02:49:23.360]  He put his faith in American people, in American worker, and the proof is in the pudding,
[02:49:23.360 --> 02:49:30.360]  more people are going back to work, and if he can figure out to get Congress to shut down immigration,
[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:35.360]  or at least get it to where it wanted to be, we win economically, and we'll win for years.
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:37.360]  And he just got to keep exposing fake news.
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:46.360]  Like I said, BuzzFeed is going to be at one of the center of one of the worst political scandals in our lifetime.
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:50.360]  This is definitely history in the making, and there's going to be a lot of scandals coming out,
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:56.360]  but a rusty game is going to be one of the top ones to come out, and I'm just glad.
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:50:01.360]  Well, I totally agree, and think about how it's gone from them denying it was a hoax to it's admitted it's a hoax,
[02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:06.360]  and they're running scared, and then Jeff Flake comes out from under the bottom of a rock,
[02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:10.360]  and starts saying Trump's stalling because he fights back.
[02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:12.360]  You ever notice Trump never attacks?
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:15.360]  He tries to be nice, and then he fights back, and then when he fights back,
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:19.360]  they can't believe that when they call him all these horrible lies, and all this horrible stuff,
[02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:24.360]  that he talks back to him, and they actually whine and complain about it, and call him stalling,
[02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:27.360]  and say he's shutting down the press, Chris.
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:31.360]  Yeah, I looked at it, I laughed, and it was whining.
[02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:34.360]  You know, you're mightier than thou, you're holier than thou.
[02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:39.360]  I see what happens when I used to watch C-Span on why they talk the way they do.
[02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:43.360]  Like, the gentlemen from this, the gentlemen from that, the gentlemen from this, the gentle woman,
[02:50:43.360 --> 02:50:48.360]  they say that talk because the average census ban of the average person, you'll change the channel quick if you listen,
[02:50:48.360 --> 02:50:58.360]  and you won't pay attention to the Flick stuff in my bag that they do when they try to pump across their propaganda and pass the law.
[02:50:58.360 --> 02:51:03.360]  Well, sure, America was about getting rid of all the royal crown, upper class stuff,
[02:51:03.360 --> 02:51:09.360]  and not getting rid of manners, but getting rid of all the par-launch that was to keep the average person from being involved in government.
[02:51:09.360 --> 02:51:10.360]  You're right.
[02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:18.360]  And all of that, all of that blue blood stuff suit garbage, it isn't about parliamentary procedure,
[02:51:18.360 --> 02:51:23.360]  it is about how wonderful and powerful and big they are, and it's disgusting.
[02:51:23.360 --> 02:51:24.360]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[02:51:24.360 --> 02:51:26.360]  Great points, Chris.
[02:51:26.360 --> 02:51:30.360]  This is the People's Choice Fake News Awards, meant to build up to the president,
[02:51:30.360 --> 02:51:32.360]  supposedly going to go live at four o'clock.
[02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:35.360]  Can we pull up his Twitter feed and see if he said anything about it yet?
[02:51:35.360 --> 02:51:38.360]  We were just checking earlier, and now the media is saying, oh, it's fake news.
[02:51:38.360 --> 02:51:39.360]  Oh, he backed off.
[02:51:39.360 --> 02:51:40.360]  Oh, he didn't do it.
[02:51:40.360 --> 02:51:44.360]  The only way he'd do this is if there was some major military emergency.
[02:51:44.360 --> 02:51:48.360]  North Korea is about to test an atomic weapon or a hydrogen bomb or about to shoot another missile,
[02:51:48.360 --> 02:51:50.360]  and they said, sir, we need you in the situation room.
[02:51:50.360 --> 02:51:51.360]  You can't do it.
[02:51:51.360 --> 02:51:52.360]  There's some big international thing.
[02:51:52.360 --> 02:51:56.360]  And that's how they actually control presidents they don't like, like Kennedy and other people,
[02:51:56.360 --> 02:51:59.360]  is they just keep crises going where they can never get their bearing.
[02:51:59.360 --> 02:52:03.360]  And that's where Michael Moore said they'd get the president would be on foreign affairs
[02:52:03.360 --> 02:52:05.360]  by blocking him internally.
[02:52:05.360 --> 02:52:07.360]  That's what Chris was kind of getting to earlier.
[02:52:07.360 --> 02:52:08.360]  Okay, who's up next?
[02:52:08.360 --> 02:52:10.360]  Mad Christian, thank you for holding.
[02:52:10.360 --> 02:52:14.360]  During the People's Choice Fake News Awards 2017, because the information war goes on,
[02:52:14.360 --> 02:52:17.360]  regardless of whether Trump arrives at four o'clock or not.
[02:52:17.360 --> 02:52:19.360]  But I wouldn't count him out yet.
[02:52:19.360 --> 02:52:21.360]  Go ahead, Mad Christian.
[02:52:21.360 --> 02:52:26.360]  Alex Jones, ladies and gentlemen, and snowflakes.
[02:52:26.360 --> 02:52:28.360]  All right.
[02:52:28.360 --> 02:52:30.360]  I can't just come up with one, Alex.
[02:52:30.360 --> 02:52:31.360]  There are so many.
[02:52:31.360 --> 02:52:32.360]  I've got 10 myself.
[02:52:32.360 --> 02:52:38.360]  I can go through them in 30 seconds during no particular order because that would be racist.
[02:52:38.360 --> 02:52:44.360]  But let's start off with Congresswoman Wilson, who said that Trump's phone call to the window
[02:52:44.360 --> 02:52:46.360]  was, you know, disrespectful.
[02:52:46.360 --> 02:52:48.360]  And that came out to be fake news.
[02:52:48.360 --> 02:52:49.360]  Oh, yeah.
[02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:50.360]  Oh, yeah.
[02:52:50.360 --> 02:52:56.360]  Who's the CNN reporter that said that Trump didn't visit Scalise?
[02:52:56.360 --> 02:52:58.360]  Not sure.
[02:52:58.360 --> 02:53:00.360]  Which one was that?
[02:53:00.360 --> 02:53:01.360]  I always forget his name.
[02:53:01.360 --> 02:53:02.360]  Sorry.
[02:53:02.360 --> 02:53:03.360]  Go ahead.
[02:53:03.360 --> 02:53:04.360]  Okay.
[02:53:04.360 --> 02:53:12.360]  We had Byron Ross reporting that Mike Flynn was instructed to contact the Russians during
[02:53:12.360 --> 02:53:13.360]  the campaign.
[02:53:13.360 --> 02:53:14.360]  Okay.
[02:53:14.360 --> 02:53:23.360]  One of the big ones to me was Yahoo published the AP report that President threatened to
[02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:27.360]  invade Russia.
[02:53:27.360 --> 02:53:32.360]  On January 26th, we had the Washington Post said that the entire State Department had
[02:53:32.360 --> 02:53:34.360]  resigned.
[02:53:34.360 --> 02:53:41.360]  And then we have stupid ones like Dana Schwartz who tweeted about Trump's hands and that they
[02:53:41.360 --> 02:53:44.360]  were photoshopped.
[02:53:44.360 --> 02:53:47.360]  The Martin Luther King bus being moved.
[02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:55.360]  Oh, yeah, the Detroit reported that a local businessman flew to Iraq for his sick mother.
[02:53:55.360 --> 02:54:01.360]  And while there, she died because she could get back to get medical treatment because
[02:54:01.360 --> 02:54:04.360]  of the quote unquote Muslim ban.
[02:54:04.360 --> 02:54:05.360]  Sir, you are awesome.
[02:54:05.360 --> 02:54:06.360]  This is what I wanted to do there.
[02:54:06.360 --> 02:54:12.360]  Are you reading off a news article or a list of the mainstream media's lies in 2017?
[02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:14.360]  Or do you just have a memory that's good because I remember this.
[02:54:14.360 --> 02:54:18.360]  And also remember last week, they said that a bunch of our ambassadors to Africa and Haiti
[02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:20.360]  resigned and none of that was true.
[02:54:20.360 --> 02:54:22.360]  They're always trying to create these hoaxes.
[02:54:22.360 --> 02:54:24.360]  Oh, another one.
[02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:30.360]  Remember this one, the Guardian stated that rumor that transgender teenagers were committing
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:35.360]  suicide at such a high rate because of Trump's election.
[02:54:35.360 --> 02:54:36.360]  Yep.
[02:54:36.360 --> 02:54:41.360]  And it just goes on and on and on with these people.
[02:54:41.360 --> 02:54:46.360]  But the dossier is probably the big one.
[02:54:46.360 --> 02:54:51.360]  Well, just you're in the running.
[02:54:51.360 --> 02:54:53.360]  We're going to put you in the running for the contest.
[02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:54.360]  I don't know what to say about.
[02:54:54.360 --> 02:54:57.360]  You're just for your shotgun effect of exactly.
[02:54:57.360 --> 02:54:58.360]  And I just forget these.
[02:54:58.360 --> 02:54:59.360]  They're back there talking about the lies, too.
[02:54:59.360 --> 02:55:01.360]  And everybody's easy to think about this.
[02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:06.360]  So we remember what scum we're dealing with and then call into C-SPAN, call to talk radio.
[02:55:06.360 --> 02:55:09.360]  Just tell folks about their lies, remind people about the lies.
[02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:10.360]  That's what burns them.
[02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:13.360]  And then we should talk about info wars, not bragging.
[02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:14.360]  How much have we talked about?
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:16.360]  That's all of the show that turned out to be accurate.
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:22.360]  How much did we predict it was dead on, brother?
[02:55:22.360 --> 02:55:23.360]  Quite a bit.
[02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:25.360]  We're going to put Mad Christian on hold.
[02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:27.360]  I think Mad Christian will be one of the guys.
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:28.360]  I want to launch a show soon.
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:29.360]  I'm doing it.
[02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:31.360]  So put their name on the board, phone numbers in a file.
[02:55:31.360 --> 02:55:32.360]  We can't we do it?
[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:33.360]  And I forget.
[02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:34.360]  And I go, where's their names?
[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:35.360]  This fellow, whoever.
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:40.360]  I want listeners that are interesting.
[02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:42.360]  Black, white, old, young.
[02:55:42.360 --> 02:55:44.360]  I want to do a show with men.
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:49.360]  I want to do a show with women where it's people on the phone, people on Skype, people here.
[02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:53.360]  And we have these big round table discussions with our listeners, commercial free for hours.
[02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:56.360]  I want to just, I want to put our listeners on air.
[02:55:56.360 --> 02:55:58.360]  And you're all great callers.
[02:55:58.360 --> 02:56:00.360]  I mean, the guy before that, I should have got his name and number.
[02:56:00.360 --> 02:56:02.360]  I just, it's going to be exciting.
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:04.360]  You're like, well, that's kind of what callers are, Alex.
[02:56:04.360 --> 02:56:08.360]  I know, but the particular callers that kind of didn't leave the other callers in taking the calls.
[02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:11.360]  Mad Christian, we're got you on hold.
[02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:15.360]  We're going to go to Kevin and we're going to go to everybody else who's been holding right when we come back.
[02:56:15.360 --> 02:56:16.360]  Boom, boom, boom.
[02:56:16.360 --> 02:56:18.360]  Mike is up next as well.
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:21.360]  Again, just briefly, we had free shipping.
[02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:22.360]  We had it for almost a month.
[02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:23.360]  We had to get rid of it.
[02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:26.360]  I don't get a dollar 48 like Bezos does of taxpayer money.
[02:56:26.360 --> 02:56:28.360]  And it's basically killing us doing the free shipping.
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:29.360]  But I did it.
[02:56:29.360 --> 02:56:30.360]  We got a lot of orders.
[02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:33.360]  People supported us, but the free shipping is gone, but it's still very low price.
[02:56:33.360 --> 02:56:39.360]  But we still got 50% off on secret 12 X to supermail vitality and four other products.
[02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:40.360]  That's got to end.
[02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:41.360]  Okay.
[02:56:41.360 --> 02:56:47.360]  Because those and we've got the new pollen block from the Japanese quail eggs fed a special diet in France.

[02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:08.360]  That's a typo.
[02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:09.360]  We say 50 is 51%.
[02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:17.360]  It's 1776 promotes healthy sinus function, optimizes respiratory wellness, clinically studied ingredient.

[02:59:22.360 --> 02:59:28.360]  I mean that's a great way just to meet like minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[02:59:28.360 --> 02:59:38.360]  And the newest one is trigger warning t-shirt trigger warning t-shirt which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign and then info wars dot com on the back.
[02:59:38.360 --> 02:59:47.360]  That is the new shirt of the mind available exclusively in info wars store dot com.
[02:59:47.360 --> 02:59:54.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:54.360 --> 03:00:07.360]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones Roger Stone is coming up riding shotgun and the war room kicks off and Trump supposedly going to have this fake news award.
[03:00:07.360 --> 03:00:12.360]  I mean he's the guy that delivers he's the guy that keeps his promises even mainstream media has to admit that now.
[03:00:12.360 --> 03:00:16.360]  They're big fake news he's racist with the lowest black unemployment ever recorded.
[03:00:16.360 --> 03:00:26.360]  That's old news it's in 17 years now it's ever recorded since Bureau Labor Statistics and it's good numbers for everybody give you want to work.
[03:00:26.360 --> 03:00:30.360]  Problem is a lot of millennials I don't care what color they are lazy.
[03:00:30.360 --> 03:00:38.360]  So they're CNBC record low black unemployment and you know I'm all for that type of affirmative action.
[03:00:38.360 --> 03:00:46.360]  For these deindustrialized urban areas you know the rust belt Trump is incentivizing companies to move there.
[03:00:46.360 --> 03:00:59.360]  And they're incentivizing folks to that's like the White House Kelly said listen we're not getting a lot of resumes for women and minorities he said you're qualified you're getting a job and you do a good job you're going to be in charge.
[03:00:59.360 --> 03:01:08.360]  And that's how Trump operates so I got all the awards for women's groups gay groups African American groups because he opened up golf courses.
[03:01:08.360 --> 03:01:15.360]  You can believe this 35 40 years ago this was still going on that no blacks were allowed at that's just amazing or Jews.
[03:01:15.360 --> 03:01:23.360]  You know there's this whole thing that Jews write everything and then there was a police golf course is just 20 30 years ago when it stopped that Jews couldn't go to.
[03:01:23.360 --> 03:01:31.360]  But I mean those blue blood things are so elitist it's just unbelievable the point is is that everything you hear about Trump is not true.
[03:01:31.360 --> 03:01:40.360]  And it's not some butt kissing contest here it's like Stephen Colbert said I know that the Trump's genitals aren't small because I'm too busy kissing his butt all day.
[03:01:40.360 --> 03:01:46.360]  You know what I'm trying to have prosperity and freedom and I guess I'm kissing the truth's butt.
[03:01:46.360 --> 03:01:54.360]  And you know Colbert says that Trump's mouth is the you know what holster for Vladimir Putin's genitals.
[03:01:54.360 --> 03:02:02.360]  That's all funny to him and I just simply say why because the media attacked Trump's genitals and said he said big red button because he has small genitals.
[03:02:02.360 --> 03:02:10.360]  Remember all that and they took it out of context like I was just bringing up his genitals and I get it it makes it funny but it's all lies.
[03:02:10.360 --> 03:02:16.360]  They didn't take what I said to make it funny they edited it to make it funny.
[03:02:16.360 --> 03:02:24.360]  They made it look like he's crazy is out of the blue going I got a big red button and I got powerful nukes Kim Jong-un said we're going to nuke you we're going to first strike you.
[03:02:24.360 --> 03:02:30.360]  We got a red button on my desk and Trump said well we got a bigger red button and ours works.
[03:02:30.360 --> 03:02:36.360]  And it brought North Korea to the table.
[03:02:36.360 --> 03:02:41.360]  And that's all coming up we're going to take your calls with Roger Stoney loves taking calls.
[03:02:41.360 --> 03:02:44.360]  I tell you what a cliffhanger.
[03:02:44.360 --> 03:02:48.360]  They're now going to say Trump choked Trump backed off on the fake news awards.
[03:02:48.360 --> 03:02:54.360]  He could be baiting them like a few weeks ago that he moves it again and they go oh you're scared oh you're not going to do it.
[03:02:54.360 --> 03:03:02.360]  He's either baiting them so that it's really big when he has it he knows they'll say he choked or he's scared when it's such a great extravaganza.
[03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:14.360]  Or what I think has happened if he doesn't go live at four there's a big crisis with North Korea or the Middle East right now and he's in a situation room in the bunker.
[03:03:14.360 --> 03:03:22.360]  He's been pretty quiet on Twitter let's pull up the Twitter which let's put the president's Twitter on screen.
[03:03:22.360 --> 03:03:26.360]  Yeah no tweeting for a while.
[03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:30.360]  21 hours seven hours Eric Trump on Fox and Friends.
[03:03:30.360 --> 03:03:33.360]  No one went out this morning but scroll down.
[03:03:33.360 --> 03:03:41.360]  And 21 hours ago executive order protecting nation from foreign terrorist.
[03:03:41.360 --> 03:03:49.360]  And if you scroll down new report on DOJ DHS three and four individuals convicted of terrorism related charges are far and born.
[03:03:49.360 --> 03:03:52.360]  They have submitted to Congress a list of resources and reforms.
[03:03:52.360 --> 03:03:54.360]  You got to stop bringing in terrorists.
[03:03:54.360 --> 03:03:57.360]  Today is my honor to welcome president.
[03:03:57.360 --> 03:04:05.360]  He's going to show up at four thirty late after it reaches fever pitch to punk him or there's a national security crisis going on.
[03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:06.360]  You can bet your buck.
[03:04:06.360 --> 03:04:07.360]  That's what's happening.
[03:04:07.360 --> 03:04:08.360]  And here's the good news.
[03:04:08.360 --> 03:04:15.360]  The next two and a half hours we're going to find out an info wars is covering it live unfiltered MSM will twist whatever happens.

[03:05:04.360 --> 03:05:11.360]  The testosterone levels begin to decline starting around thirty at a rate of about one to two percent per year.
[03:05:11.360 --> 03:05:18.360]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue low energy low sex drive and muscle loss.
[03:05:18.360 --> 03:05:24.360]  Alpha power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[03:05:24.360 --> 03:05:33.360]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms including.

[03:05:36.360 --> 03:05:38.360]  Makarou from Peru.
[03:05:38.360 --> 03:05:42.360]  Horny goat wheat from China and tribulus from India.

[03:06:29.360 --> 03:06:35.360]  We'll be co-hosting right into the war room with Owen Shroyer Rob doing many others today because this is the people's choice.
[03:06:35.360 --> 03:06:45.360]  Fake news awards the first annual for 2017 held on Wednesday January 17th 2018.
[03:06:45.360 --> 03:06:52.360]  Now Roger Stone obviously former head of the Trump campaign Trump Confidant for forty three years.
[03:06:52.360 --> 03:06:55.360]  Has given us incredible intel on what's going on with the president.
[03:06:55.360 --> 03:07:04.360]  He's going to break exclusive news right now on the FISA court and what happened last week in that vote and the tweets that went back and forth that were contradictory.
[03:07:04.360 --> 03:07:08.360]  And he's also going to get into the mind of the president to understand how real he is.
[03:07:08.360 --> 03:07:10.360]  That's why they hate him.
[03:07:10.360 --> 03:07:15.360]  And it's not flip flopping it's influenced by evidence in his gut.
[03:07:15.360 --> 03:07:20.360]  And he's got other big breaking news we're going to continue with your calls and your nomination for the fake news awards.
[03:07:20.360 --> 03:07:22.360]  I asked Roger during the break.
[03:07:22.360 --> 03:07:27.360]  I said do you think he's trolling him eight days ago canceling it or moving it back.
[03:07:27.360 --> 03:07:29.360]  Then today not saying anything.
[03:07:29.360 --> 03:07:31.360]  They say oh you're scared there's no fake news.
[03:07:31.360 --> 03:07:38.360]  There is a ocean of them in fake news that we've been going over we're going to recap here.
[03:07:38.360 --> 03:07:44.360]  But this is just amazing and I know you haven't talked to him in a little while so we don't have any intel on that particularly.
[03:07:44.360 --> 03:07:46.360]  But I like to give people the big news right up front.
[03:07:46.360 --> 03:07:48.360]  There's always more big news coming.
[03:07:48.360 --> 03:07:50.360]  We don't like the cliffhanger folks here.
[03:07:50.360 --> 03:07:53.360]  They call that plant the hook and radio we say coming up.
[03:07:53.360 --> 03:07:58.360]  We still say coming up because there is something coming up but there's just coming up coming up coming up.
[03:07:58.360 --> 03:07:59.360]  We give it to you up front.
[03:07:59.360 --> 03:08:07.360]  So Roger Stone my friend let's go ahead and get into the big news you were telling me during the break.
[03:08:07.360 --> 03:08:09.360]  Well several things have happened Alex.
[03:08:09.360 --> 03:08:18.360]  I as you know was in Washington on Monday and I had an opportunity to talk to a number of my sources inside the administration.
[03:08:18.360 --> 03:08:32.360]  You'll recall that the president was watching Fox and Friends when he saw Judge Andrew Napolitano make a compelling case against the reauthorization of the Surveillance Act by the Congress last week.
[03:08:32.360 --> 03:08:50.360]  Essentially re-upping the Patriot Act and the broad surveillance put in place by the Bushes after 9-11 and correctly as Trump said used to spy on the Trump campaign spy on the Republican candidate for president of the United States.
[03:08:50.360 --> 03:09:04.360]  The president put out a very strong tweet that caused heads to explode at the NSA and in the Congress. General Kelly got Paul Ryan on the phone with the president and they convinced him to reverse himself.
[03:09:04.360 --> 03:09:15.360]  Now I learned yesterday that the president subsequently sent the message to Judge Napolitano that he agreed with him but he felt his hands were tied.
[03:09:15.360 --> 03:09:24.360]  So it is yet another example of the deep staters around the president whose instincts are so unerringly good.
[03:09:24.360 --> 03:09:33.360]  Just his gut instincts and these quizlings that are around him I think they serve him. It's a perfect example.
[03:09:33.360 --> 03:09:45.360]  The FISA reauthorization yesterday came very close. It had to do with the absence of John McCain but we were within a vote or two.
[03:09:45.360 --> 03:10:04.360]  The greatest disappointment Alex is that the amendment carried by Ron Paul and Democrat Ron Wyden to the surveillance vote in the Congress that I just referred to failed narrowly. That would have required a warrant if the deep staters want to spy on an American citizen.
[03:10:04.360 --> 03:10:17.360]  Let's be clear. We under the Constitution can spy on foreign powers, foreign individuals but they're admittedly using it for total control. Google, Facebook and Twitter are spying on people.
[03:10:17.360 --> 03:10:24.360]  They're bigger than the NSA. Twitter is basically run by the Communist Chinese. That just broke just like Hollywood is.
[03:10:24.360 --> 03:10:34.360]  The US Veritas bomb to drop at infowars.com and drudgereport.com has it up right now as well. The University of Texas, they caught the Chinese Communist taking it over last week. That's even the Washington Post.
[03:10:34.360 --> 03:10:43.360]  And we have Communist Chinese coming out of our ears here while they obsess over Russia all day. This is unbelievable. I mean, I've been told it is the Chinese or communist.
[03:10:43.360 --> 03:10:57.360]  It was Michael Savage. He's always in the top 10 New York Times of a seller. They printed tens of thousands of his first book on China. Then the publisher got threatened. They would not ship it to the stores two years ago.
[03:10:57.360 --> 03:11:09.360]  So it is just massive censorship and then Flake has the nerve to get up there and say if the president criticizes media when they attack him, he's stalling and that's book burning and authoritarianism.
[03:11:09.360 --> 03:11:20.360]  So to have our free speech or the president to have free speech to talk to that, I mean, if I was going to have somebody cast to play a loan shark or criminal in a movie, I'd hire Jeff Flake.
[03:11:20.360 --> 03:11:28.360]  I mean, he comes off like a serious serial killer or bank robber. I mean, I'm sorry. He just looks like one and acts like one. But anyway, see what I was saying.
[03:11:28.360 --> 03:11:39.360]  It's just sick. It's just sick to see this crap. And the more I love the president as he is in battle like a lion surrounded by hyenas, it makes me sick.
[03:11:39.360 --> 03:11:49.360]  The lowest black unemployment ever. The veterans getting twice as many visits now and getting privatized care. The veterans getting their biggest pay increase ever.
[03:11:49.360 --> 03:12:05.360]  The border 70% controlled the 26,000 stock market did NAFTA being renegotiated TPP pulled out of on and on and on and on and on Davos meeting saying they've got to stop America and Trump and the communist president saying he'll help defeat Trump.
[03:12:05.360 --> 03:12:16.360]  I mean, it's insane. It's so obvious who side he's on. What side is America? What side of these millennials? What is their problem? What don't they want prosperity and freedom? Damn it.
[03:12:16.360 --> 03:12:25.360]  You know, I must say, Alex, the Davos thing surprises me. The only reason the president should go to Davos is to announce that everyone there is under arrest.
[03:12:25.360 --> 03:12:36.360]  This is a conclave of international criminals and corporatists who have been feeding the deep state and the two party duopoly. These are the globalists.
[03:12:36.360 --> 03:12:44.360]  No, I agree. But I don't buy the media going, Oh, look, he betrayed you. He's going to globalist meeting. He goes to the G 20 and G seven and gets in their face and doesn't wear their pin.
[03:12:44.360 --> 03:12:54.360]  He's going to take a victory lap. He's going to stick it up there. I understand Trump entirely and I kind of like it because he's about to crash their little tea party.
[03:12:54.360 --> 03:13:12.360]  But continuing with the breaking news here, Alex, I have also had sources confirmed for me that in the very near future, General HR McMaster will get his fourth star and be packed off to the Korean front to work on an upcoming activity in Korea.
[03:13:12.360 --> 03:13:16.360]  I'm not sure what that could be. And are you ready for the kicker?
[03:13:16.360 --> 03:13:43.360]  Deena Powell is pushing Condoleezza Rice to be the national security advisor in the Trump White House. Now this was overheard at a party at Cafe Milano, a going away party for Deena Powell. Wow.
[03:13:43.360 --> 03:13:58.360]  And henchwoman. She certainly is not by any stretch of the imagination, a non interventionist like the president. I believe that she was out that she was forced out for leaking.
[03:13:58.360 --> 03:14:15.360]  But there's going to be a serious play to try to put Condoleezza Rice back in the White House. This boggles the mind. This is the woman who is the architect of the Iraq war. I cannot believe the president will go for this, but they are going to try to sell it to him.
[03:14:15.360 --> 03:14:27.360]  This is the same woman that got a call from Mayor Willie Brown, not the fly on 9 11 who worked directly with Saudi Arabia, covering up their role of the 28 pages and the September 11 attacks.
[03:14:27.360 --> 03:14:50.360]  Her best friends are Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. So what more do we need to say? Also Joy Ann Reed. This is a cabal. Now she is a consummate brown noser. She's done an extraordinary job of trying to suck up to the president and she can be very charming.
[03:14:50.360 --> 03:15:16.360]  I heard her and Dubby had a relationship. I don't think that's true, actually. I think that was Al Gore Smear. I can explain that to you when we're off camera. But more importantly, the graphic we just showed was the legal secretary of state on the right, Rex Tillerson, and on the left, the de facto secretary of state.
[03:15:16.360 --> 03:15:20.360]  That's what you've been saying for a year. She's the shadow secretary of state.
[03:15:20.360 --> 03:15:29.360]  Yes, I think that's true. And that's why we're still in Afghanistan despite the president's correct instincts. It's time to get out of there.
[03:15:29.360 --> 03:15:51.360]  The big news is McMaster packed off to be the new MacArthur in the giant war with North Korea. We'll talk about that and go directly to your phone calls in the middle of the People's Choice. Fake News Awards 2017. And in the next two hours will the president cancel his fake news? Will he make that fake news? I don't think so, but we'll see together.

[03:18:00.360 --> 03:18:06.360]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy. They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:18:06.360 --> 03:18:13.360]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[03:18:13.360 --> 03:18:20.360]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[03:18:20.360 --> 03:18:28.360]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:18:28.360 --> 03:18:33.360]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:18:33.360 --> 03:18:41.360]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.

[03:21:03.360 --> 03:21:08.360]  One reason we have newswars.com is Twitter, Facebook, Google and others really hate InfoWars.
[03:21:08.360 --> 03:21:13.360]  They try to block the spread of that, but news wars, you can slip through on them a lot easier.
[03:21:13.360 --> 03:21:19.360]  This is a day-by-day war, but just recapping the bombshells that you were telling me during the break.
[03:21:19.360 --> 03:21:24.360]  This is an exclusive, Roger, what you're about to give people.
[03:21:24.360 --> 03:21:26.360]  So more on this Condoleezza Rice situation.
[03:21:26.360 --> 03:21:29.360]  But first, on Davos, the head of Davos says,
[03:21:29.360 --> 03:21:36.360]  Trump is leading a global rebellion against globalism with populism and admit he is their main enemy.
[03:21:36.360 --> 03:21:42.360]  So why would Trump travel to the foot of the seat of power of Mordor?
[03:21:42.360 --> 03:21:47.360]  He's doing a victory lap. He wants to stick it up their keyster.
[03:21:47.360 --> 03:21:52.360]  They're losing. He's winning. These are the people, Alex, who said he would never be president.
[03:21:52.360 --> 03:21:56.360]  These are the people who said the stock market would crash if he became president.
[03:21:56.360 --> 03:22:01.360]  These are the people who thought he would lose the Electoral College or a recount.
[03:22:01.360 --> 03:22:07.360]  They despise him because he emboldens or embodies a reform agenda.
[03:22:07.360 --> 03:22:15.360]  It's not an agenda they like because it entails American sovereignty, American exceptionalism,
[03:22:15.360 --> 03:22:20.360]  American independence, and that's not part of their program, as you well know.
[03:22:20.360 --> 03:22:26.360]  So the president is going there, I think, to rub their nose in it. I love it.
[03:22:26.360 --> 03:22:33.360]  We just put on screen an article from 366 days ago, one day before this last year,
[03:22:33.360 --> 03:22:38.360]  where the Chinese president promised to go there to profit globalism, the Chinese dictator.
[03:22:38.360 --> 03:22:43.360]  Once he got there, he pledged to stop Trump and stop nationalism.
[03:22:43.360 --> 03:22:49.360]  Well, here we are, 366 days later, that's blown up in his face spectacularly.
[03:22:49.360 --> 03:22:54.360]  I am so proud of supporting Trump. I am so proud with going with my gut.
[03:22:54.360 --> 03:22:57.360]  I am so proud of the audience. I am so proud of you, Roger.
[03:22:57.360 --> 03:23:05.360]  Well, Alex, also breaking is this enormous tug of war that's going on
[03:23:05.360 --> 03:23:14.360]  between inside the White House where, incredibly, the president's lawyers, Dowd and Ty Cobb,
[03:23:14.360 --> 03:23:20.360]  are urging him to grant an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller.
[03:23:20.360 --> 03:23:24.360]  This is the most obvious perjury trap I have ever seen,
[03:23:24.360 --> 03:23:31.360]  whereas you have outside legal experts from Judge Napolitano on the right to Alan Dershowitz on the left.
[03:23:31.360 --> 03:23:37.360]  No matter what the president does, he's going to say it's perjury according to the God Emperor Mueller.
[03:23:37.360 --> 03:23:42.360]  There's no way in the world he should go and give these guys what they're looking for.
[03:23:42.360 --> 03:23:46.360]  It's all a game where they try to catch you in some little inconsistency
[03:23:46.360 --> 03:23:51.360]  that they can then try to conflagrate into, you know, a firestorm.
[03:23:51.360 --> 03:23:54.360]  This is really not sound political advice.
[03:23:54.360 --> 03:23:59.360]  I really hope the president will decide to tell Mueller to pound sand.
[03:23:59.360 --> 03:24:07.360]  The only reason that Mueller wants to interview him is to discuss the termination of James Comey as the FBI director.
[03:24:07.360 --> 03:24:13.360]  That's why Steve Bannon has been subpoenaed by Mueller.
[03:24:13.360 --> 03:24:15.360]  That is why some of the people who work for him...
[03:24:15.360 --> 03:24:18.360]  And it's their last shot. Why step on a hand grenade?
[03:24:18.360 --> 03:24:22.360]  Why step on a landmine that that creature laid for him?
[03:24:22.360 --> 03:24:25.360]  Well, now with that, the other thing that's interesting is we've now gone full cycle.
[03:24:25.360 --> 03:24:29.360]  We started with Comey's firing, then we took this detour into Russian collusion.
[03:24:29.360 --> 03:24:31.360]  Oops, we didn't find anything.
[03:24:31.360 --> 03:24:33.360]  Now we're right back at James Comey.
[03:24:33.360 --> 03:24:34.360]  You know what it tells me?
[03:24:34.360 --> 03:24:36.360]  Mueller's got nothing.
[03:24:36.360 --> 03:24:41.360]  He's got this trumped up process charge, as I've said, for some weeks now.
[03:24:41.360 --> 03:24:45.360]  But it is essential that the president pour wax in his ears.
[03:24:45.360 --> 03:24:49.360]  He should not listen to these dummies he has.
[03:24:49.360 --> 03:24:51.360]  Absolutely. He's already gone too far bending over to this.
[03:24:51.360 --> 03:24:55.360]  He has a unitary executive. He has at least equal power in the other branches.
[03:24:55.360 --> 03:24:58.360]  And these people have no public support. They're laughing stocks.
[03:24:58.360 --> 03:25:00.360]  He ought to chew him out about...
[03:25:00.360 --> 03:25:04.360]  He ought to interrogate him about Fusion GPS and about, you know,
[03:25:04.360 --> 03:25:07.360]  the Justice Department waiver he got to be involved with Russia
[03:25:07.360 --> 03:25:11.360]  and interrogate him about Deputy Director McCabe
[03:25:11.360 --> 03:25:14.360]  and how he was involved fixing the fake info.
[03:25:14.360 --> 03:25:18.360]  And he ought to demand an apology out of his ass and videotape it.
[03:25:18.360 --> 03:25:21.360]  The only way ought to happen is to march his ass in there in front of the carpet
[03:25:21.360 --> 03:25:23.360]  and chew his butt out.
[03:25:23.360 --> 03:25:26.360]  I could not agree more.
[03:25:26.360 --> 03:25:30.360]  It would be a site to see.
[03:25:30.360 --> 03:25:33.360]  As you know, the Trump Justice Department
[03:25:33.360 --> 03:25:36.360]  and the Trump Central Intelligence Agency
[03:25:36.360 --> 03:25:40.360]  are still trying to figure out how to arrest Julian Assange
[03:25:40.360 --> 03:25:45.360]  for the alleged crime of publishing classified documents.
[03:25:45.360 --> 03:25:49.360]  Yet Donald Trump's personal lawyers in the lawsuit against me
[03:25:49.360 --> 03:25:53.360]  and Donald Trump by Project Democracy are arguing...
[03:25:53.360 --> 03:25:55.360]  Which, by the way, even liberal publications admit
[03:25:55.360 --> 03:25:58.360]  is beyond McCarthyism and admits to destroy free speech
[03:25:58.360 --> 03:26:02.360]  and complete made-up crap. Just insane asylum BS.
[03:26:02.360 --> 03:26:05.360]  Absolutely true. But isn't it odd that the president's personal lawyers
[03:26:05.360 --> 03:26:10.360]  are arguing in one court that the publication by WikiLeaks violates no law
[03:26:10.360 --> 03:26:13.360]  while his Justice Department and his CIA director
[03:26:13.360 --> 03:26:17.360]  are arguing that Assange should be detained and prosecuted?
[03:26:17.360 --> 03:26:20.360]  How's that one for inconsistency?
[03:26:20.360 --> 03:26:22.360]  We've got to go to calls as promised.
[03:26:22.360 --> 03:26:24.360]  But let's just briefly go right back to calls, I promise.
[03:26:24.360 --> 03:26:27.360]  Here in the Fake News Awards, the people's choice,
[03:26:27.360 --> 03:26:29.360]  whether Trump shows up an hour and a half or not,
[03:26:29.360 --> 03:26:31.360]  we're covering it all live here.
[03:26:31.360 --> 03:26:33.360]  That's the bottom line. Spread the links.
[03:26:33.360 --> 03:26:35.360]  Record audience tuning in right now on those screams.
[03:26:35.360 --> 03:26:37.360]  Record audience this year so far.
[03:26:37.360 --> 03:26:40.360]  Getting back to this.
[03:26:40.360 --> 03:26:43.360]  That shows you how isolated they admit their main job
[03:26:43.360 --> 03:26:46.360]  is to keep your info and my info away from the president.
[03:26:46.360 --> 03:26:48.360]  He still sneaks off and calls you sometimes.
[03:26:48.360 --> 03:26:51.360]  But I know it's harder and harder to get a hold of him.
[03:26:51.360 --> 03:26:55.360]  Condoleesa Rice, the neocon architect.
[03:26:55.360 --> 03:26:57.360]  I hope this isn't a race card thing he's doing.
[03:26:57.360 --> 03:27:00.360]  There are a lot of really qualified black people
[03:27:00.360 --> 03:27:02.360]  that could be a national security adviser.
[03:27:02.360 --> 03:27:04.360]  There's no question.
[03:27:04.360 --> 03:27:08.360]  But this woman has a horrific war record as a war monger,
[03:27:08.360 --> 03:27:11.360]  and she bears responsibility for the Iraq war.
[03:27:11.360 --> 03:27:14.360]  Do you think she voted for Donald Trump?
[03:27:14.360 --> 03:27:16.360]  I wouldn't bet on it.
[03:27:16.360 --> 03:27:19.360]  She's part and parcel of the Bush family machine.
[03:27:19.360 --> 03:27:22.360]  Why is he bringing Alan West or something?
[03:27:22.360 --> 03:27:25.360]  That guy's super smart in combat and everything else.
[03:27:25.360 --> 03:27:27.360]  You know what? They'd be better off with John Bolton.
[03:27:27.360 --> 03:27:29.360]  John Bolton may have been a neocon,
[03:27:29.360 --> 03:27:32.360]  but that's because he was reflecting the views of his boss.
[03:27:32.360 --> 03:27:35.360]  But he's still fiercely anti-globalist.
[03:27:35.360 --> 03:27:40.360]  And he endorsed and campaigned aggressively for Donald Trump
[03:27:40.360 --> 03:27:44.360]  when all the other country club Republicans cut and ran,
[03:27:44.360 --> 03:27:46.360]  ran for the high grass.
[03:27:46.360 --> 03:27:48.360]  So I think Bolton gets credit for sticking in the fort
[03:27:48.360 --> 03:27:50.360]  and standing up for the party nominee.
[03:27:50.360 --> 03:27:53.360]  He worked very hard giving surrogate speeches for Trump.
[03:27:53.360 --> 03:27:54.360]  But that's still saying a lot,
[03:27:54.360 --> 03:27:56.360]  because Bolton's got serious issues.
[03:27:56.360 --> 03:27:58.360]  You're right. Compared to Rice, he's better.
[03:27:58.360 --> 03:28:03.360]  Well, I mean, it is like night and day.
[03:28:03.360 --> 03:28:06.360]  You're going to have a big turnover here, I think,
[03:28:06.360 --> 03:28:08.360]  in the Trump administration.
[03:28:08.360 --> 03:28:13.360]  There's going to be a reshuffling of the deck chairs very shortly.
[03:28:13.360 --> 03:28:15.360]  It appears that Gary Cohn, for example,
[03:28:15.360 --> 03:28:19.360]  the president's economic advisors all dressed up with no place to go.
[03:28:19.360 --> 03:28:23.360]  It is now believed that McMaster will go to take this,
[03:28:23.360 --> 03:28:25.360]  get his four-star and go to the Korean front.
[03:28:25.360 --> 03:28:27.360]  I was about to say that's the good news.
[03:28:27.360 --> 03:28:30.360]  Even CNN admits at this executive time for four hours in the morning,
[03:28:30.360 --> 03:28:32.360]  he reads documents, makes phone calls, watches TV,
[03:28:32.360 --> 03:28:35.360]  surfs the Internet, and then makes decisions himself.
[03:28:35.360 --> 03:28:37.360]  So even though they've surrounded him,
[03:28:37.360 --> 03:28:39.360]  he's still making most of the decisions.
[03:28:39.360 --> 03:28:41.360]  We're going to come right back to the phone calls.
[03:28:41.360 --> 03:28:43.360]  But I think it's time to take a run at the Clintons again
[03:28:43.360 --> 03:28:45.360]  and to bring Danny Williams back on.
[03:28:45.360 --> 03:28:46.360]  That just hit me.
[03:28:46.360 --> 03:28:48.360]  I want to talk about that as well.
[03:28:48.360 --> 03:29:13.360]  Let's go.
[03:29:18.360 --> 03:29:25.360]  The answer to being in control of your own healthcare is
[03:29:25.360 --> 03:29:27.360]  freedom from insurance.
[03:29:27.360 --> 03:29:29.360]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients
[03:29:29.360 --> 03:29:32.360]  that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[03:29:32.360 --> 03:29:35.360]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month
[03:29:35.360 --> 03:29:37.360]  and $347 for families.
[03:29:37.360 --> 03:29:39.360]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[03:29:39.360 --> 03:29:42.360]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[03:29:42.360 --> 03:29:43.360]  See guidelines.
[03:29:43.360 --> 03:29:46.360]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[03:29:46.360 --> 03:29:48.360]  Go to libertyoncall.org.
[03:29:48.360 --> 03:30:17.360]  That's libertyoncall.org.
[03:30:18.360 --> 03:30:20.360]  Brain Force Plus is the next generation
[03:30:20.360 --> 03:30:24.360]  of advanced neural activation and new tropics.
[03:30:24.360 --> 03:30:27.360]  And now we've added a brand new ingredient
[03:30:27.360 --> 03:30:30.360]  called black pepper fruit extract
[03:30:30.360 --> 03:30:32.360]  that gives you an added kick.
[03:30:32.360 --> 03:30:36.360]  Other ingredients include vitamin B12
[03:30:36.360 --> 03:30:39.360]  and neurological tonic and cognitive enhancers
[03:30:39.360 --> 03:30:42.360]  that will allow you to flip the switch
[03:30:42.360 --> 03:30:45.360]  and supercharge your state of mind.
[03:30:45.360 --> 03:30:47.360]  It's the real deal.
[03:30:47.360 --> 03:30:49.360]  Brain Force Plus.
[03:30:49.360 --> 03:31:18.360]  This is the real deal.
[03:31:19.360 --> 03:31:21.360]  This is the real deal.
[03:31:49.360 --> 03:31:53.360]  At InfowarsStore.com, that's InfowarsStore.com.
[03:31:53.360 --> 03:31:54.360]  I'm so excited.
[03:31:54.360 --> 03:31:57.360]  The new product at InfowarsLive.com
[03:31:57.360 --> 03:32:01.360]  in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to the brim,
[03:32:01.360 --> 03:32:04.360]  filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:32:04.360 --> 03:32:08.360]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic
[03:32:08.360 --> 03:32:10.360]  that doesn't have any stimulants in it,
[03:32:10.360 --> 03:32:13.360]  but boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[03:32:13.360 --> 03:32:17.360]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors
[03:32:17.360 --> 03:32:19.360]  prescribing to their patients,
[03:32:19.360 --> 03:32:21.360]  but it wasn't prescription,
[03:32:21.360 --> 03:32:25.360]  but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[03:32:25.360 --> 03:32:27.360]  and I came up with our own formula
[03:32:27.360 --> 03:32:29.360]  working with some scientists and developers.
[03:32:29.360 --> 03:32:34.360]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:32:34.360 --> 03:32:37.360]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[03:32:37.360 --> 03:32:40.360]  which is the precursor to all the hormones
[03:32:40.360 --> 03:32:43.360]  that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:32:43.360 --> 03:32:46.360]  It is amazing.
[03:32:46.360 --> 03:32:49.360]  Red pill, now available at infowarsstore.com
[03:32:49.360 --> 03:32:52.360]  and your purchase fuzz the operation.
[03:32:56.360 --> 03:32:59.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:04.360 --> 03:33:06.360]  He's going the distance.
[03:33:06.360 --> 03:33:09.360]  He's going for speed.
[03:33:09.360 --> 03:33:11.360]  She's all alone.
[03:33:11.360 --> 03:33:14.360]  All alone in a time of need.
[03:33:14.360 --> 03:33:16.360]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:33:16.360 --> 03:33:18.360]  Roger Stone, normally host this hour,
[03:33:18.360 --> 03:33:20.360]  and I'm hosting it with him.
[03:33:20.360 --> 03:33:22.360]  He's in the behind showing it with us a little bit
[03:33:22.360 --> 03:33:25.360]  into the next hour, and we've got Owen Schreuer coming in.
[03:33:25.360 --> 03:33:27.360]  Scheduled an hour and a half,
[03:33:27.360 --> 03:33:30.360]  the president, an hour and 27 minutes to be precise,
[03:33:30.360 --> 03:33:33.360]  is scheduled to do what he's been talking about for several weeks.
[03:33:33.360 --> 03:33:35.360]  That is his fake news awards,
[03:33:35.360 --> 03:33:38.360]  that is just total genius, the president's idea.
[03:33:38.360 --> 03:33:41.360]  We were the first to implement it, Rob do,
[03:33:41.360 --> 03:33:44.360]  and Owen right after he talked about it a few months ago,
[03:33:44.360 --> 03:33:47.360]  but now it's the president's supposed to be going to do it.
[03:33:47.360 --> 03:33:50.360]  I know there are arguments if he is going to put the kibosh on it
[03:33:50.360 --> 03:33:53.360]  for now, Lay low, the whole crap hole comment,
[03:33:53.360 --> 03:33:56.360]  and all the rest of it, but you've got to do what you're going to do.
[03:33:56.360 --> 03:33:58.360]  You've got to do what he said you'll do,
[03:33:58.360 --> 03:34:01.360]  and the media is not going to leave you alone if you don't go after him.
[03:34:01.360 --> 03:34:03.360]  They've had Flake come out and say,
[03:34:03.360 --> 03:34:05.360]  it's authoritarian for the president to stand up for himself
[03:34:05.360 --> 03:34:07.360]  when they tell lies.
[03:34:07.360 --> 03:34:10.360]  So we're going to be looking at all of that briefly.
[03:34:10.360 --> 03:34:12.360]  We had 60 plus products at 50% off.
[03:34:12.360 --> 03:34:14.360]  We had more than 10 products at 60% off.
[03:34:14.360 --> 03:34:19.360]  Most of those products sold out or got so close to selling out
[03:34:19.360 --> 03:34:23.360]  because year-end that we put them back to regular price till more comes in.
[03:34:23.360 --> 03:34:26.360]  It may be months till we get some of those best-selling items back in,
[03:34:26.360 --> 03:34:30.360]  but we have a whole bunch of our best-selling products
[03:34:30.360 --> 03:34:34.360]  that are still at 50% off.
[03:34:34.360 --> 03:34:40.360]  And again, that is Survival Shield X-Tube, Secret 12, Supermell Vitality.
[03:34:40.360 --> 03:34:44.360]  If you scroll down, there's three others that are still 50% off there.
[03:34:44.360 --> 03:34:46.360]  Caveman is incredible, folks.
[03:34:46.360 --> 03:34:50.360]  Next-level protein powder with all the key essence of the bones.
[03:34:50.360 --> 03:34:54.360]  That's why it's got 2,000 plus reviews, 4.6 review.
[03:34:54.360 --> 03:34:56.360]  Caveman is just amazing.
[03:34:56.360 --> 03:35:01.360]  MFullWarsLive.com, MFullWarsStore.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[03:35:01.360 --> 03:35:05.360]  And the new item that I'm not going to belabor because I want to go to your calls,
[03:35:05.360 --> 03:35:08.360]  you should go read about dealing with seasonal issues with the sinuses,
[03:35:08.360 --> 03:35:12.360]  with all the pollen and stuff out there that irritates people so badly.
[03:35:12.360 --> 03:35:17.360]  Go read the summary of pollen block and how it is the patented, proven,
[03:35:17.360 --> 03:35:21.360]  proprietary secret system developed in France with Japanese quail.
[03:35:21.360 --> 03:35:24.360]  They found a long time ago that fed certain diets.
[03:35:24.360 --> 03:35:27.360]  They produced a secret food ingredient.
[03:35:27.360 --> 03:35:31.360]  So this isn't even in the drug class or the supplement class that has been known
[03:35:31.360 --> 03:35:33.360]  to just knock out seasonal discomfort massively.
[03:35:33.360 --> 03:35:39.360]  I take ClarinD or ZertikD, and it works, but I mean, it's like speed.
[03:35:39.360 --> 03:35:41.360]  I can't take it. I turn into a jerk.
[03:35:41.360 --> 03:35:44.360]  I'm already like this, just having a cup and a half of coffee today.
[03:35:44.360 --> 03:35:46.360]  Okay, I don't need it.
[03:35:46.360 --> 03:35:49.360]  And so I can't take it.
[03:35:49.360 --> 03:35:53.360]  I just mean, that's the few times I actually blow up here at the office or whatever,
[03:35:53.360 --> 03:35:55.360]  is when I'm on that, or on air.
[03:35:55.360 --> 03:35:59.360]  That's not fake when I blow up. I mean, I'm almost always on something for those issues.
[03:35:59.360 --> 03:36:02.360]  But pollen block, incredible.
[03:36:02.360 --> 03:36:04.360]  And you just got to remember to take it every day.
[03:36:04.360 --> 03:36:07.360]  During the time, there's a lot of dust out there, whatever time of year, different things,
[03:36:07.360 --> 03:36:09.360]  types of pollen affect you.
[03:36:09.360 --> 03:36:14.360]  And it is amazing. Seasonal discomfort support, and it's 51% off.
[03:36:14.360 --> 03:36:15.360]  That's what it came to.
[03:36:15.360 --> 03:36:17.360]  34.95, it's a great deal.
[03:36:17.360 --> 03:36:21.360]  17.76, that's 51% off, declare independence against all that garbage today
[03:36:21.360 --> 03:36:24.360]  and help support the Second American Revolution globally.
[03:36:24.360 --> 03:36:26.360]  I'm going to call us right now.
[03:36:26.360 --> 03:36:31.360]  But just briefly, Roger, looking at what's happening with Trump
[03:36:31.360 --> 03:36:36.360]  and looking at his agenda going through and how they just keep attacking and keep getting worse
[03:36:36.360 --> 03:36:40.360]  and all the things that are happening and all the things that are going on.
[03:36:40.360 --> 03:36:44.360]  What would you say the mood of the globalist is right now
[03:36:44.360 --> 03:36:46.360]  as the stock market hits 26,000 and all the rest of this?
[03:36:46.360 --> 03:36:49.360]  I mean, that's really how he proves himself is delivering.
[03:36:49.360 --> 03:36:51.360]  Black unemployment, the lowest ever.
[03:36:51.360 --> 03:36:53.360]  I keep harping on this. Good Lord.
[03:36:53.360 --> 03:36:55.360]  This is messianic. What's happened?
[03:36:55.360 --> 03:37:02.360]  What I see Alex from the Deep Staters and the establishment Terrians is fear.
[03:37:02.360 --> 03:37:09.360]  This past week, the president appointed John Berman as the U.S. attorney
[03:37:09.360 --> 03:37:11.360]  for the Southern District of New York.
[03:37:11.360 --> 03:37:15.360]  That includes New York City, replacing Preet Mahara,
[03:37:15.360 --> 03:37:19.360]  one of the most corrupt prosecutors in American history.
[03:37:19.360 --> 03:37:25.360]  Now we learn that Senator Gillibrand has blue-slipped Mr. Berman's appointment,
[03:37:25.360 --> 03:37:28.360]  which means the president has appointed Berman.
[03:37:28.360 --> 03:37:36.360]  Berman can serve for 128 days and then his nomination either has to be sent to the Senate or withdrawn.
[03:37:36.360 --> 03:37:41.360]  Senator Gillibrand has announced her intention to blue-slip him,
[03:37:41.360 --> 03:37:48.360]  which means through senatorial courtesy, the Senate Judiciary Committee would not hear Berman's nomination.
[03:37:48.360 --> 03:37:53.360]  Sadly, Senator Chuck Grassley has announced that he will honor the blue-slip.
[03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:57.360]  He has not honored a blue-slip for some judicial appointments.
[03:37:57.360 --> 03:37:58.360]  What is this all about?
[03:37:58.360 --> 03:38:03.360]  Well, they say it's about the fact that Berman at some point in his career
[03:38:03.360 --> 03:38:08.360]  did some legal work for Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Bank was a large lender
[03:38:08.360 --> 03:38:11.360]  to Donald Trump's real estate endeavors.
[03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:17.360]  I don't see the conflict unless, of course, you think that the Russians laundered money through Deutsche Bank,
[03:38:17.360 --> 03:38:19.360]  which there's no evidence whatsoever about.
[03:38:19.360 --> 03:38:22.360]  Well, that's like saying if I had a bank account with Bank of America in high school,
[03:38:22.360 --> 03:38:25.360]  I got rid of it, but I did, it was the first one I got,
[03:38:25.360 --> 03:38:30.360]  that somehow decades later I couldn't hire somebody that worked at Bank of America.
[03:38:30.360 --> 03:38:33.360]  Meanwhile, the Clintons literally put all their own cronies in,
[03:38:33.360 --> 03:38:37.360]  have foreign governments give them money in emails directly for pay-for-play,
[03:38:37.360 --> 03:38:41.360]  like, you give me two million, you get this, that's not an issue.
[03:38:41.360 --> 03:38:46.360]  Wow, and of course, the Democrats admit they're trying to block all these new appointments
[03:38:46.360 --> 03:38:49.360]  to sabotage the Make America Great Again movement.
[03:38:49.360 --> 03:38:55.360]  Now, what's particularly disappointing here is the backstory of what Gillibrand is really doing.
[03:38:55.360 --> 03:39:01.360]  The last thing that Chuck Schumer wants is an independent prosecutor in New York City,
[03:39:01.360 --> 03:39:07.360]  because a first-year law student could take a list of Chuck Schumer's campaign contributions
[03:39:07.360 --> 03:39:12.360]  and the dates of them and the list of his votes in the United States Senate
[03:39:12.360 --> 03:39:17.360]  and you would very quickly see that Chuck Schumer can be bought and very, very cheaply.
[03:39:17.360 --> 03:39:20.360]  There's a direct correlation.
[03:39:20.360 --> 03:39:24.360]  So they have always fought to make sure that they have a prosecutor in New York City
[03:39:24.360 --> 03:39:28.360]  who's in the tank who won't look at Chuck Schumer.
[03:39:28.360 --> 03:39:31.360]  What you're saying is Trump getting an honest actor in there
[03:39:31.360 --> 03:39:35.360]  could tip the entire thing of dominoes in the giant globalist nest
[03:39:35.360 --> 03:39:38.360]  of people that have invaded the great state of New York and New York City?
[03:39:38.360 --> 03:39:43.360]  Well, what we now know, unfortunately, that Senator McConnell and Senator Grassley
[03:39:43.360 --> 03:39:48.360]  say they're going to honor this senatorial hold on Berman's nomination.
[03:39:48.360 --> 03:39:52.360]  The president should attack saying this is a cover-up.
[03:39:52.360 --> 03:39:57.360]  They don't want an honest prosecutor like Berman because they have so much to cover up.
[03:39:57.360 --> 03:39:59.360]  That would be the truth.
[03:39:59.360 --> 03:40:01.360]  Key, this is how we drain the swamp.
[03:40:01.360 --> 03:40:03.360]  Trump's trying to get swamp drainers in there.
[03:40:03.360 --> 03:40:06.360]  I mean, look at this guy that he brought in at the Federal Trade Commission,
[03:40:06.360 --> 03:40:08.360]  the trust buster. I mean, he's really doing it.
[03:40:08.360 --> 03:40:10.360]  Kevin, in Canada, you're on the air.
[03:40:10.360 --> 03:40:12.360]  Thank you for holding so patiently.
[03:40:12.360 --> 03:40:14.360]  Who is your nominee for fake news?
[03:40:14.360 --> 03:40:16.360]  2017, my friend.
[03:40:16.360 --> 03:40:21.360]  Do you remember in the 1990s when CNN did those live reports from Iraq?
[03:40:21.360 --> 03:40:25.360]  Yeah, they said Skud Messels were attacking there on top of building in Atlanta.
[03:40:25.360 --> 03:40:29.360]  So to me, pointing out fake news from fake news organizations,
[03:40:29.360 --> 03:40:32.360]  it's kind of like pointing out the turd and the toilet bowl.
[03:40:32.360 --> 03:40:36.360]  It's much better for self-reflection, and I'd like to give my fake news story.
[03:40:36.360 --> 03:40:42.360]  So my fake news story of the year is definitely how you, Alex Jones,
[03:40:42.360 --> 03:40:46.360]  supported and dignified Steve Bannon.
[03:40:46.360 --> 03:40:53.360]  Well, at the same time, I don't want to say you were hurting Ivanka or Jared,
[03:40:53.360 --> 03:40:58.360]  but definitely you weren't on their side. You were more on Steve Bannon's side.
[03:40:58.360 --> 03:41:03.360]  I think that's much more intellectually smart to go down that way
[03:41:03.360 --> 03:41:06.360]  and discuss rather than just discussing fake news.
[03:41:06.360 --> 03:41:08.360]  It's been around since God.
[03:41:08.360 --> 03:41:11.360]  Well, sure. I mean, we're saying, though, pointing out mainstream media's lies,
[03:41:11.360 --> 03:41:14.360]  but I'm going to say this right now. You were in the running,
[03:41:14.360 --> 03:41:17.360]  and I'm kind of going to be the, I feel like this is third place at least, the steak knives,
[03:41:17.360 --> 03:41:22.360]  because I absolutely, when I'm wrong, I've made a huge deal out of the fact
[03:41:22.360 --> 03:41:26.360]  that I got suckered by Bannon and it found out he was the big leaker
[03:41:26.360 --> 03:41:28.360]  and the really bad guy and Stone warned me eight months ago.
[03:41:28.360 --> 03:41:30.360]  And I said, I don't know if I'm going to hire you because I don't like infighting.
[03:41:30.360 --> 03:41:32.360]  He said, look, it's not infighting. He's the one bringing them all in.
[03:41:32.360 --> 03:41:34.360]  He's the bad guy. I've discovered it.
[03:41:34.360 --> 03:41:38.360]  And I'm kind of sad that I even got Roger, which I never even do behind the scenes,
[03:41:38.360 --> 03:41:41.360]  that he kind of was a team player and we didn't go after Bannon with a look and see.
[03:41:41.360 --> 03:41:44.360]  So you're absolutely right. I wouldn't call it like fake news.
[03:41:44.360 --> 03:41:47.360]  Like I tried to lie, but a mistake. You're right.
[03:41:47.360 --> 03:41:50.360]  Fake news 2017, Alex Jones' support of Stephen Bannon.
[03:41:50.360 --> 03:41:53.360]  Get his name, put him down in the running for the steak knives
[03:41:53.360 --> 03:41:57.360]  or the $1,000 prize or whatever. I got to say it, Roger. He's right.
[03:41:57.360 --> 03:42:02.360]  Oh, but in your defense, Alex, Bannon was talking like one of us.
[03:42:02.360 --> 03:42:07.360]  He made enormous promises to Trump supporters to bring them into the administration.
[03:42:07.360 --> 03:42:10.360]  He ended up delivering on none of them.
[03:42:10.360 --> 03:42:15.360]  We know that Breitbart was publishing excellent investigative journalism.
[03:42:15.360 --> 03:42:17.360]  Sure, but I don't make a lot, but you warned me. You warned me.
[03:42:17.360 --> 03:42:20.360]  You said, what do we do? This is bad. I'm worried you were obsessed with it.
[03:42:20.360 --> 03:42:24.360]  You brought up clock continually and I thought, do you having a pissing contest with him?
[03:42:24.360 --> 03:42:28.360]  Is this what this is? Because I go, you're like, no, and you, so I was wrong.
[03:42:28.360 --> 03:42:33.360]  So the caller's right. Let's admit, you're the one who smells like a rose in this side. It's true.
[03:42:33.360 --> 03:42:38.360]  I put out the fake news that Bannon was a good guy, but you're right.
[03:42:38.360 --> 03:42:41.360]  He was doing the right thing on the surface, so he didn't know.
[03:42:41.360 --> 03:42:51.360]  So it's not, still, it's a fair thing for the caller. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[03:46:17.360 --> 03:46:18.360]  Thank you.
[03:46:18.360 --> 03:46:20.360]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[03:46:20.360 --> 03:46:24.360]  For you folks who aren't big, normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[03:46:24.360 --> 03:46:27.360]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWarsLife products.
[03:46:27.360 --> 03:46:28.360]  They are quality.
[03:46:28.360 --> 03:46:30.360]  I can't wait to get some more.
[03:46:30.360 --> 03:46:33.360]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[03:46:33.360 --> 03:46:34.360]  Absolutely.
[03:46:34.360 --> 03:46:39.360]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women
[03:46:39.360 --> 03:46:46.360]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves,
[03:46:46.360 --> 03:47:15.360]  we can take our country back.
[03:47:16.360 --> 03:47:29.360]  All right, I'm going to be co-hosting right into the next hour, though, and Troy and others.
[03:47:29.360 --> 03:47:35.360]  The president is at this Bob Dole Center Announcement Award.
[03:47:35.360 --> 03:47:36.360]  Bob Dole's in a wheelchair.
[03:47:36.360 --> 03:47:38.360]  Bob Dole, you say what you want about him.
[03:47:38.360 --> 03:47:39.360]  He was a pretty good guy in a lot of ways.
[03:47:39.360 --> 03:47:44.360]  He got shot up in Italy in World War II, and some of the same ground my dad's dad chewed.
[03:47:44.360 --> 03:47:46.360]  So, you know, whatever.
[03:47:46.360 --> 03:47:49.360]  Bob Dole, I know you worked for Bob Dole, didn't you?
[03:47:49.360 --> 03:47:51.360]  Didn't you, Roger?
[03:47:51.360 --> 03:47:58.360]  Yeah, I was a staff assistant to Senator Bob Dole from 1973 to 1974.
[03:47:58.360 --> 03:48:01.360]  I think he's a great American patriot.
[03:48:01.360 --> 03:48:08.360]  You notice that after the Republican Party nominated Donald Trump and the Bushes refused to endorse him and headed for the hell.
[03:48:08.360 --> 03:48:09.360]  Dole backed him.
[03:48:09.360 --> 03:48:11.360]  Now he backed him.
[03:48:11.360 --> 03:48:17.360]  At his age, he got in an airplane and he was barnstorming across the country for him.
[03:48:17.360 --> 03:48:21.360]  So, he worked in the system and when he saw a shot, he got behind it.
[03:48:21.360 --> 03:48:24.360]  He's a great, great patriot.
[03:48:24.360 --> 03:48:28.360]  And, you know, he does not have, as you know, the use of his right hand.
[03:48:28.360 --> 03:48:32.360]  His arm was shattered by an enemy shell in World War II.
[03:48:32.360 --> 03:48:35.360]  He was told that he would never walk again.
[03:48:35.360 --> 03:48:37.360]  He was told he would never be able to feed himself.
[03:48:37.360 --> 03:48:40.360]  He got basically cut in half with a machine gun.
[03:48:40.360 --> 03:48:41.360]  Exactly.
[03:48:41.360 --> 03:48:54.360]  And he nursed himself back to health, got himself elected to the U.S. House, got himself elected to the U.S. Senate, came to the attention of one Richard M. Nixon, who made him Republican National Chairman.
[03:48:54.360 --> 03:48:57.360]  He is a great, great patriot.
[03:48:57.360 --> 03:49:00.360]  Well, I agree compared to these other people.
[03:49:00.360 --> 03:49:05.360]  Like you said, you kind of find out with backing Trump who's who, haven't we?
[03:49:05.360 --> 03:49:10.360]  Well, you know, it's nothing like adversity to tell you who your friends are.
[03:49:10.360 --> 03:49:18.360]  The K6 and the Flakes and the McCain's and the Bush's, these people are midgets.
[03:49:18.360 --> 03:49:21.360]  Bob Dole is a giant, truly a giant.
[03:49:21.360 --> 03:49:30.360]  We shouldn't forget, we came within one millimeter with the whole fake edited, grabbed by the, you know, what deal when, when the vice president almost dove on him.
[03:49:30.360 --> 03:49:34.360]  And I'm not bragging, but you remember, you called me and I was like, we're going straight forward here.
[03:49:34.360 --> 03:49:37.360]  I mean, because this is a war, folks.
[03:49:37.360 --> 03:49:40.360]  We know the globalists don't want our dog in the fight, Trump.
[03:49:40.360 --> 03:49:42.360]  We backed the dog.
[03:49:42.360 --> 03:49:44.360]  Well, you never wavered, Alex.
[03:49:44.360 --> 03:49:56.360]  I remember it very distinctly when I called and told you that the party leaders were talking about convening the Republican National Committee, dumping Trump as the nominee, replacing him with Pence.
[03:49:56.360 --> 03:49:59.360]  And you said, if they do that, they will lose.
[03:49:59.360 --> 03:50:01.360]  We've got to stick with Trump.
[03:50:01.360 --> 03:50:02.360]  This will pass.
[03:50:02.360 --> 03:50:06.360]  And within about 48 hours, it did pass.
[03:50:06.360 --> 03:50:11.360]  Which again, we're going to see hoax after hoax after hoax after hoax after hoax.
[03:50:11.360 --> 03:50:12.360]  So just get ready for it.
[03:50:12.360 --> 03:50:14.360]  Let's take some more phone calls here with Roger Stone.
[03:50:14.360 --> 03:50:16.360]  This is we're going to take a lot more calls next hour.
[03:50:16.360 --> 03:50:17.360]  I kind of not much this hour.
[03:50:17.360 --> 03:50:20.360]  This is the first guest we've had today is Roger Stone.
[03:50:20.360 --> 03:50:23.360]  And he's had his office invaded by some folks, but that's fine as well.
[03:50:23.360 --> 03:50:25.360]  We're going to go to the calls.
[03:50:25.360 --> 03:50:28.360]  We've been holding the longest here, Mike in North Dakota.
[03:50:28.360 --> 03:50:29.360]  You're on the year with Roger Stone.
[03:50:29.360 --> 03:50:31.360]  Thanks for holding.
[03:50:31.360 --> 03:50:32.360]  Yes, Alex.
[03:50:32.360 --> 03:50:33.360]  Thank you.
[03:50:33.360 --> 03:50:37.360]  I've been listening since 2010, the first time that I've been able to call in.
[03:50:37.360 --> 03:50:39.360]  So happy to do so.
[03:50:39.360 --> 03:50:40.360]  Thank you, sir.
[03:50:40.360 --> 03:50:41.360]  God bless.
[03:50:41.360 --> 03:50:42.360]  What's on your mind?
[03:50:42.360 --> 03:50:43.360]  Okay.
[03:50:43.360 --> 03:50:46.360]  I got a few bullet points to this point.
[03:50:46.360 --> 03:50:53.360]  My nomination is going to all the way back to the beginning when President Trump gave
[03:50:53.360 --> 03:50:58.360]  his inaugural speech and his announcement.
[03:50:58.360 --> 03:51:05.360]  The next day it was CNN and then other places picked it up of how all Mexicans were criminals.
[03:51:05.360 --> 03:51:06.360]  They're rapists.
[03:51:06.360 --> 03:51:08.360]  They're bringing in their worst.
[03:51:08.360 --> 03:51:10.360]  They're horrible people.
[03:51:10.360 --> 03:51:16.360]  And the reason why this is so important is it's the origin of Trump as a racist.
[03:51:16.360 --> 03:51:17.360]  He's not.
[03:51:17.360 --> 03:51:18.360]  He's Hitler.
[03:51:18.360 --> 03:51:26.360]  All his supporters are Nazis, white nationalists and all this, which laid the foundation for
[03:51:26.360 --> 03:51:38.360]  this crazy liberal social hysteria that in turn laid the groundwork and basically validated
[03:51:38.360 --> 03:51:45.360]  the radical sect of Black Lives Matter and Antifa when they had all these riots and massive
[03:51:45.360 --> 03:51:49.360]  protests and all that starting when they shut down Trump's speech in Chicago.
[03:51:49.360 --> 03:51:52.360]  It caused millions and millions and millions of dollars of damage.
[03:51:52.360 --> 03:51:58.360]  Which, by the way, we have the WikiLeaks, Hillary did fund to then blame Trump and blame Sanders.
[03:51:58.360 --> 03:52:00.360]  She had folks dressed up like Sanders people.
[03:52:00.360 --> 03:52:03.360]  I first learned it from Matt Dubio, who knows the police, and then Roger Stone.
[03:52:03.360 --> 03:52:07.360]  Later it was all confirmed that indeed they staged that.
[03:52:07.360 --> 03:52:09.360]  But did Bernie Sanders get mad at Hillary?
[03:52:09.360 --> 03:52:11.360]  No, because he just went along with it.
[03:52:11.360 --> 03:52:12.360]  It's truly sickening.
[03:52:12.360 --> 03:52:13.360]  So I agree.
[03:52:13.360 --> 03:52:15.360]  Up there at the top, Russia's huge.
[03:52:15.360 --> 03:52:19.360]  But what's been more effective, the whole Russia thing's been fake, is the race thing.
[03:52:19.360 --> 03:52:22.360]  You can't really debunk it because it's just made up to begin with.
[03:52:22.360 --> 03:52:26.360]  And so, I mean, I agree that the whole Trump as a racist thing is right up there at the top.
[03:52:26.360 --> 03:52:28.360]  Let's put you in the running.
[03:52:28.360 --> 03:52:31.360]  That's been one of the slowest level calls we've gotten.
[03:52:31.360 --> 03:52:34.360]  Only four or five of, like, 100 we've taken saying it's the race thing.
[03:52:34.360 --> 03:52:37.360]  I think the race thing's right up there with Russia in the fake news.
[03:52:37.360 --> 03:52:38.360]  We'll put you on hold.
[03:52:38.360 --> 03:52:39.360]  Thank you, Mike.
[03:52:39.360 --> 03:52:42.360]  Roger, I mean, for you, what is the biggest fake news the last year?
[03:52:42.360 --> 03:52:46.360]  Is it the race based narrative or that Trump doesn't want to help the people narrative?
[03:52:46.360 --> 03:52:47.360]  You know, that lie?
[03:52:47.360 --> 03:52:48.360]  Or is it the Russiagate thing?
[03:52:48.360 --> 03:52:49.360]  We know it's all a lie.
[03:52:49.360 --> 03:52:50.360]  My God.
[03:52:50.360 --> 03:52:56.360]  I mean, you know, I'm not for straight-up affirmative action, just because, you know,
[03:52:56.360 --> 03:52:59.360]  like they always say, they're going to let Asians now have top grades because, you know,
[03:52:59.360 --> 03:53:00.360]  they're Asian.
[03:53:00.360 --> 03:53:01.360]  They're getting them all.
[03:53:01.360 --> 03:53:02.360]  Asians have the top, top nine slots.
[03:53:02.360 --> 03:53:05.360]  Most white folks are on the side of the road when it comes to comparatively.
[03:53:05.360 --> 03:53:06.360]  But I won't help everybody.
[03:53:06.360 --> 03:53:11.360]  But Trump's doing direct investment in mainly black areas because he said he would do it.
[03:53:11.360 --> 03:53:13.360]  And, you know, he wants to prove that.
[03:53:13.360 --> 03:53:15.360]  He wants to break the back of that lie.
[03:53:15.360 --> 03:53:17.360]  But where are the black leaders thanking Trump?
[03:53:17.360 --> 03:53:20.360]  Well, we know most of the King family is.
[03:53:20.360 --> 03:53:25.360]  Alex, to answer your question, I think the single greatest fake news story of the year
[03:53:25.360 --> 03:53:31.360]  is the assertion that Donald Trump was not under surveillance at Trump Tower, that the
[03:53:31.360 --> 03:53:34.360]  deep state was not spying on him.
[03:53:34.360 --> 03:53:37.360]  We have proven that to be a lie repeatedly.
[03:53:37.360 --> 03:53:38.360]  You recalled it.
[03:53:38.360 --> 03:53:41.360]  Well, first they said they were surveilling.
[03:53:41.360 --> 03:53:42.360]  Then they said they never had.
[03:53:42.360 --> 03:53:43.360]  Sorry.
[03:53:43.360 --> 03:53:44.360]  Go ahead.
[03:53:44.360 --> 03:53:47.360]  Well, the judge and Apollo Tano reported that for Fox.
[03:53:47.360 --> 03:53:54.360]  They waited until after five o'clock in the LA Times past the deadline on the East reported
[03:53:54.360 --> 03:53:57.360]  that Napolitano had been fired.
[03:53:57.360 --> 03:54:01.360]  And then they said that he had been suspended and neither thing were true.
[03:54:01.360 --> 03:54:08.360]  And to this day, he has never gotten an apology from either Fox or from the LA Times, despite
[03:54:08.360 --> 03:54:12.360]  the fact that he's been proven entirely correct.
[03:54:12.360 --> 03:54:17.360]  The fact that they did have Donald Trump and his aides, including yours truly in that story
[03:54:17.360 --> 03:54:18.360]  under surveillance.
[03:54:18.360 --> 03:54:21.360]  Oh, they said he was a kingpin of it in a day later.
[03:54:21.360 --> 03:54:22.360]  They said they never said it.
[03:54:22.360 --> 03:54:26.360]  So let me ask you this question.
[03:54:26.360 --> 03:54:27.360]  What is our legal recourse?
[03:54:27.360 --> 03:54:30.360]  I don't want to just sue people, but you know, you're watching congressional hearings.
[03:54:30.360 --> 03:54:31.360]  I should tell you a year ago.
[03:54:31.360 --> 03:54:32.360]  I'll stop it.
[03:54:32.360 --> 03:54:33.360]  It's a joke.
[03:54:33.360 --> 03:54:37.360]  But once they were saying I was a Russian spy, I flipped out because I know it's not true
[03:54:37.360 --> 03:54:38.360]  and it's it's incredible.
[03:54:38.360 --> 03:54:42.360]  And then they're the ones on the uranium one payroll.
[03:54:42.360 --> 03:54:49.360]  No, this has been the the Hutzpah award should be given to these people because time and
[03:54:49.360 --> 03:54:55.360]  time again, what they have accused us of is exactly what they are doing.
[03:54:55.360 --> 03:55:02.360]  I still believe today, the single greatest threat that we face is the effort by the tech
[03:55:02.360 --> 03:55:08.960]  science, Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter to try to limit our ability to communicate
[03:55:08.960 --> 03:55:12.480]  with the legions of the president beyond fake news.
[03:55:12.480 --> 03:55:14.360]  That's the end of news.
[03:55:14.360 --> 03:55:19.320]  That is the great censorship that we're going to cover next hour.
[03:55:19.320 --> 03:55:21.560]  And again, Trump is still at the Bob Dole event.
[03:55:21.560 --> 03:55:25.680]  Do you think he's he's he's going chomping the media trolling him?
[03:55:25.680 --> 03:55:26.680]  He's going to go to the White House.
[03:55:26.680 --> 03:55:28.040]  Is he going to do a live feed?
[03:55:28.040 --> 03:55:30.480]  What's going to happen in an hour?
[03:55:30.480 --> 03:55:36.400]  The only thing that's predictable about Donald Trump is that he is entirely unpredictable.
[03:55:36.400 --> 03:55:37.400]  I know that.
[03:55:37.400 --> 03:55:39.080]  But let's put your money on it.
[03:55:39.080 --> 03:55:43.720]  You got to place your bet right now, Roger Stone, 90 percent of the time he delivers
[03:55:43.720 --> 03:55:44.960]  on what he says.
[03:55:44.960 --> 03:55:48.120]  He's already moved this once, though, telling me he wants a bunch of production done that
[03:55:48.120 --> 03:55:49.280]  hadn't been done.
[03:55:49.280 --> 03:55:50.520]  Maybe he's being sabotaged.
[03:55:50.520 --> 03:55:52.920]  Maybe maybe there's a national security crisis.
[03:55:52.920 --> 03:55:55.600]  Other than that, you know, I mean, why wouldn't he deliver?
[03:55:55.600 --> 03:55:59.840]  They're going to say he choked while he also understands the news cycle.
[03:55:59.840 --> 03:56:03.280]  So maybe he's stretching this out to get several stories.
[03:56:03.280 --> 03:56:06.840]  I can't wait till he presents the very first tapper.
[03:56:06.840 --> 03:56:10.000]  That's what they're calling the fake news award, the little statuette.
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:11.000]  It's called a tapper.
[03:56:11.000 --> 03:56:13.440]  Oh, wait, you were told that?
[03:56:13.440 --> 03:56:15.680]  I heard somebody say that at the White House.
[03:56:15.680 --> 03:56:16.680]  Yeah.
[03:56:16.680 --> 03:56:20.760]  Now, I don't know if it was facetious or whether it was real, but it's a pretty damn good idea.
[03:56:20.760 --> 03:56:26.000]  I blur on air off here, and I want to be careful that I don't say something that's secret.
[03:56:26.000 --> 03:56:32.920]  But you specifically talked to an individual where the president said, my hands are tied,
[03:56:32.920 --> 03:56:34.600]  but you don't want to say who it was.
[03:56:34.600 --> 03:56:39.320]  But I mean, the president directly said my hands are tied, meaning they're saying, look,
[03:56:39.320 --> 03:56:42.320]  we're all going to get blown up and killed even though we're spying on you if you don't
[03:56:42.320 --> 03:56:43.520]  let us do this.
[03:56:43.520 --> 03:56:49.720]  Well, the person that told me this said facetiously said, well, they probably showed him a video
[03:56:49.720 --> 03:56:52.840]  of John Kennedy being killed.
[03:56:52.840 --> 03:56:58.080]  Unfortunately, that's not that far from the truth in the sense that we've had two coups
[03:56:58.080 --> 03:56:59.080]  in this country.
[03:56:59.080 --> 03:57:02.400]  One was a political coup, 1974.
[03:57:02.400 --> 03:57:05.920]  The other one was a violent coup, 1963.
[03:57:05.920 --> 03:57:10.600]  And I do think that the enmity of the establishment for Trump is such.
[03:57:10.600 --> 03:57:15.760]  You see lunatics advocating his assassination on Twitter every single day.
[03:57:15.760 --> 03:57:17.920]  Would the deep state stoop to that?
[03:57:17.920 --> 03:57:18.920]  They've done it before.
[03:57:18.920 --> 03:57:20.400]  Hell, much as they're going to kill him.
[03:57:20.400 --> 03:57:21.400]  All right, all right.
[03:57:21.400 --> 03:57:23.600]  I don't know if you're coming up the next hour and check your schedule, but we're going
[03:57:23.600 --> 03:57:24.600]  to come back.
[03:57:24.600 --> 03:57:28.520]  I'm going to continue hosting with Owen Schreuer and the rest of the great career, Roger Stone.
[03:57:28.520 --> 03:57:29.520]  You name it.
[03:57:29.520 --> 03:57:30.520]  Straight ahead.
[03:57:30.520 --> 03:57:31.520]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:57:31.520 --> 03:57:34.400]  This is the People's Choice Fake News Awards with your calls.
[03:57:34.400 --> 03:57:36.920]  I will finish these seven or eight callers right now.
[03:57:36.920 --> 03:57:38.880]  And then we're going to see if the president shows up or not.
[03:57:38.880 --> 03:57:41.080]  If not, we just roll forward with the award.
[03:57:41.080 --> 03:57:42.080]  Spread the word.
[03:57:42.080 --> 03:57:44.280]  Not a group you develop living defense for us.
[03:57:44.280 --> 03:57:45.680]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:57:45.680 --> 03:57:47.400]  Why is this so good?
[03:57:47.400 --> 03:57:52.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:57:52.000 --> 03:57:56.680]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[03:57:56.680 --> 03:57:57.680]  my system.
[03:57:57.680 --> 03:58:02.960]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[03:58:02.960 --> 03:58:08.240]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading
[03:58:08.240 --> 03:58:09.480]  disease around.
[03:58:09.480 --> 03:58:12.080]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:58:12.080 --> 03:58:13.080]  These are all parasites.
[03:58:13.080 --> 03:58:14.440]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said.
[03:58:14.440 --> 03:58:15.800]  There's so many things that are out there.
[03:58:15.800 --> 03:58:17.040]  You have the neem in there.
[03:58:17.040 --> 03:58:20.120]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:58:20.120 --> 03:58:23.400]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:58:23.400 --> 03:58:24.400]  All right.
[03:58:24.400 --> 03:58:26.600]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:58:26.600 --> 03:58:27.760]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:58:27.760 --> 03:58:29.600]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[03:58:29.600 --> 03:58:30.600]  And folks, you can't lose.

[03:58:52.960 --> 03:58:57.920]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order

[03:58:59.520 --> 03:59:03.360]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[03:59:03.360 --> 03:59:07.440]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[03:59:07.440 --> 03:59:12.680]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[03:59:12.680 --> 03:59:16.800]  Customers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[03:59:16.800 --> 03:59:18.560]  the products that you need each month.

[03:59:31.600 --> 03:59:32.960]  this is a sure win.
