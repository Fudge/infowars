[01:05.240 --> 01:09.280]  The president will sign the measure into law Tuesday in Denver.
[01:09.280 --> 01:13.840]  And Chrysler and GM are racing towards a Tuesday deadline to submit plans to show the government
[01:13.840 --> 01:17.640]  how they will become viable and repay billions in loans.
[01:17.640 --> 01:20.920]  But GM talks with auto workers have broken off.
[01:20.920 --> 01:21.920]  Here's Tom Christianer.
[01:21.920 --> 01:25.000]  They're kind of on a treadmill that really not much is being accomplished, but they're
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.400]  still talking at Chrysler.
[01:26.400 --> 01:30.800]  Ford has said it can make it through 2009 without government help.
[01:30.800 --> 01:35.120]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[01:35.120 --> 01:38.280]  Men and women, if you've got 10 to 30 pounds or more to lose, please listen carefully.
[01:38.280 --> 01:40.080]  Guys, many of us tend to overeat.
[01:40.080 --> 01:42.540]  We eat too much red meat, fast foods and processed foods.
[01:42.540 --> 01:44.920]  This keeps the belly flabby and keeps our bodies overweight.
[01:44.920 --> 01:47.160]  Ladies, have you ever said, I feel fat today?
[01:47.160 --> 01:48.520]  Or do you have this bloated feeling?
[01:48.520 --> 01:51.640]  And how many of you have been trying to lose the same 10 to 20 pounds for years?
[01:51.640 --> 01:54.400]  There's a healthy and faster way to lose weight than any diet pill.

[02:01.960 --> 02:04.160]  to the colon walls like spackle or paste.
[02:04.160 --> 02:06.520]  Two weeks of EverCleanse may be equal to months of dieting.
[02:06.520 --> 02:07.520]  It's simple too.

[02:34.960 --> 02:40.420]  The Obama administration has agreed to participate in planning for a UN conference on racism.
[02:40.420 --> 02:45.640]  The State Department, however, says it will decide later on whether to attend the conference.
[02:45.640 --> 02:46.640]  Here's Carlotta Bradley.
[02:46.640 --> 02:50.360]  A statement says the group that takes part in the planning meeting will review the direction
[02:50.360 --> 02:54.160]  of the conference preparations and whether the US should even be part of the event.
[02:54.160 --> 02:58.160]  It says the goal is to work with other countries that want the conference to responsibly and
[02:58.160 --> 03:00.840]  productively address racism around the world.
[03:00.840 --> 03:05.000]  In residence at the small New York town where a commuter plane went down or trying to deal
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  with the tragedy the best they can, everyone in the tiny Buffalo suburb seems to have
[03:10.000 --> 03:11.680]  known a victim.
[03:11.680 --> 03:16.120]  Clearance Emergency Coordinator David Besanat says there's a snowstorm on the way predicted
[03:16.120 --> 03:17.120]  for this Wednesday.
[03:17.120 --> 03:22.400]  It will only force us to pick up the pace to our absolute best.
[03:22.400 --> 03:24.400]  No one wants to work in extreme conditions.
[03:24.400 --> 03:28.200]  We're very fortunate to have these couple of days of clear sky.

[04:04.800 --> 04:10.520]  The Iraqi Election Commission acknowledges there was fraud in some cases in last month's
[04:10.520 --> 04:11.520]  elections.
[04:11.520 --> 04:12.520]  Here's Robert Reed.
[04:12.520 --> 04:18.040]  Iraqi officials say they've nullified results from the January 31 election at more than
[04:18.040 --> 04:23.120]  30 polling stations around the country due to fraud in last month's balloting.
[04:23.120 --> 04:28.320]  But officials say those cases were not significant enough to require a new vote in any province.
[04:28.320 --> 04:33.280]  Also today, a bomb hidden in a garbage pile killed one person and injured 18 others in
[04:33.280 --> 04:36.840]  Setter City, a section of Baghdad.
[04:36.840 --> 04:41.400]  Hillary Clinton heads for Asia today on her first trip abroad as Secretary of State.
[04:41.400 --> 04:45.560]  And as she prepares to leave, there may be an olive branch from North Korea where Puyang
[04:45.560 --> 04:50.520]  Yang's ceremonial head of state says the country is ready to improve relations with
[04:50.520 --> 04:52.040]  friendly countries.
[04:52.040 --> 04:57.280]  U.S. nuclear envoy Christopher Hill says North Korea must honor its commitment to give
[04:57.280 --> 04:58.280]  up nuclear weapons.
[04:58.280 --> 05:05.760]  The DPRK needs to get on with things and complete the denuclearization.
[05:05.760 --> 05:10.240]  And we've had too many interruptions and the interruptions have slowed us down too much.
[05:10.240 --> 05:15.000]  And China isn't too happy about parts of the U.S. stimulus package that favors the use
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.400]  of American goods to help rebuild the economy.
[05:18.400 --> 05:19.400]  Here's Henry Sanderson.
[05:19.400 --> 05:24.040]  They said measures like this were reminiscent of measures the U.S. took during the Great
[05:24.040 --> 05:29.040]  Depression of the 1930s that tried to protect American jobs but actually just worse than
[05:29.040 --> 05:30.040]  the recession.
[05:30.040 --> 05:34.720]  I'm Jody Jordan for IRN-USA Radio News.
[05:34.720 --> 05:35.920]  People.
[05:35.920 --> 05:37.800]  Your engine is the heart of your vehicle.
[05:37.800 --> 05:41.320]  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to determine whether it's going to go the long run?
[05:41.320 --> 05:44.640]  Or should you dump your vehicle before you experience a major expense?
[05:44.640 --> 05:49.120]  The military has developed such a technology and it's called oil analysis.
[05:49.120 --> 05:53.600]  By taking a mere four-ounce sample during an oil change, you can get an easy-to-read
[05:53.600 --> 05:59.760]  complete report by an independent laboratory covering engine wear, oil condition and contamination.
[05:59.760 --> 06:04.320]  You could expect to pay hundreds of dollars or more for someone to look inside your engine.
[06:04.320 --> 06:10.040]  But now, for only $14.95, we will send you a test kit with easy-to-follow directions.
[06:10.040 --> 06:12.480]  Yes, just $14.95.

[07:02.400 --> 07:09.440]  525. Now live from Austin, Texas. Here's Alex Jones.
[07:15.920 --> 07:20.240]  Welcome. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday evening
[07:22.320 --> 07:27.600]  or Sunday morning or some cases Monday, depending on where you are in the world.
[07:27.600 --> 07:31.200]  Thank you so much for joining us. We'll be here for the next two hours live.
[07:32.880 --> 07:38.240]  It is the 15th day of February 2009.
[07:40.480 --> 07:46.240]  Well, Barack Obama said that not one minute could be wasted. They absolutely had to have the
[07:46.880 --> 07:52.320]  $800 plus billion spending package passed immediately or we would have a depression.
[07:52.320 --> 07:58.800]  And there was a big debate Thursday and Friday that no one had been allowed to see the bill
[07:58.800 --> 08:05.040]  or read the bill. The bill was made public one hour before it was finally passed.
[08:06.640 --> 08:08.800]  It had been in conference between the House and the Senate.
[08:10.000 --> 08:16.240]  One hour later, the 1100 plus page, 1100 plus page bill, one hour after it was made public,
[08:16.240 --> 08:22.560]  was passed. And then Obama said, I'm going on a three-day vacation, but that's not enough.
[08:22.560 --> 08:29.360]  I'm then going to sign it maybe next Thursday in Denver. Maybe. It's a big joke on everybody.
[08:29.360 --> 08:35.840]  Going back to the end of George Bush's days back in early October, October 3rd to be precise.
[08:36.640 --> 08:40.400]  They said no one can read the bill. No one can see the bill. We've got to have the banker
[08:40.400 --> 08:46.560]  bailout $700 billion. It really turned out to be $8.5 trillion so far. That's Bloomberg AP,
[08:46.560 --> 08:50.800]  because it's unlimited. No one can read it. No one can see it. It's got to pass now or we'll
[08:50.800 --> 08:57.200]  have a depression next week. Then on Saturday, the day after it passed, October 4th, Secretary
[08:57.200 --> 09:02.800]  of the Treasury of the time, Mr. Paulson said, you know what? We don't even need it for mortgages
[09:02.800 --> 09:06.640]  anymore. We're not going to say what we're going to use it for. This is on record. Like they came
[09:06.640 --> 09:11.120]  before Congress. I have the testimonies. It's in my upcoming film. I'm making the Obama deception
[09:11.120 --> 09:16.800]  and Obama's people, they bragged that the Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, was the quote,
[09:16.800 --> 09:21.280]  architect of the bailout and Han showed it through the House and Senate when he was a Democratic
[09:21.280 --> 09:26.080]  leader in the House. He just resigned a few months ago. And of course, the both parties are involved
[09:26.080 --> 09:31.360]  because they're both owned by the offshore banks. The issue here is they didn't want anybody reading
[09:31.360 --> 09:38.000]  the bill. And you know why they didn't want you reading the bill? It has health care rationing
[09:38.960 --> 09:44.640]  in it. It says that the elderly will not be given basic health care. Tom Daschel literally wrote
[09:44.640 --> 09:49.280]  the legislation and he wrote a book about it two years ago saying, yeah, old folks just have to
[09:49.280 --> 09:53.760]  accept that you're not meant to be treated for these ailments. And so rationing of health care.
[09:54.640 --> 09:58.800]  In the past, they would deny that with socialist health care, but they say it's the British model
[09:58.800 --> 10:03.200]  where people wait 18 months for brain tumor surgery and of course die for treatable brain
[10:03.200 --> 10:07.200]  tumors and things like that. Or you could have a couple thousand dollar surgery on your eyes,
[10:07.200 --> 10:14.480]  but they just let you go blind. Things like that. And Bloomberg did a report on this and we covered
[10:14.480 --> 10:19.680]  it on Friday. You can actually read the subsections because that subsection of the bill was made
[10:19.680 --> 10:24.880]  public because they had tagged it on and admitted they tagged it on the larger bill. It was the
[10:24.880 --> 10:30.720]  bill, the entirety of the bill itself that was a secret. Remember two years ago, they said, oh,
[10:30.720 --> 10:38.000]  it's a secret bill on fixing immigration, fixing it. No one could see it, but trust us, there's
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.640]  no amnesty. And then Senator Session violated Senate rules and gotten trouble for it, but thank
[10:42.640 --> 10:50.240]  God he did and leaked the bill. You can Google 20 loopholes in immigration bill and you can read the
[10:50.240 --> 10:55.680]  20 loopholes from two years ago. And it was worse than total amnesty for 30 million illegal aliens.
[10:55.680 --> 10:59.840]  It allowed felons who were felons to stay here. It allowed anyone who wanted to come
[10:59.840 --> 11:05.520]  for six years to come here instantly legalized. So it was more than just an amnesty for the,
[11:05.520 --> 11:11.120]  quote, 14 million they claimed were here. Though Congress has even studied the problem and set
[11:11.120 --> 11:17.280]  over 30 million. So this is the type of deception that we see. But here's the big issue. I got a call
[11:17.280 --> 11:25.520]  Friday and another call Saturday from the same congressional source that told me they'd been
[11:25.520 --> 11:30.160]  threatened with martial law back in October of last year if they didn't pass the bill. And we
[11:30.160 --> 11:35.680]  reported the martial law threat before it was on the news. Then it ended up coming out on C-Span,
[11:35.680 --> 11:40.960]  the floor of the house, and then made national news. Just like a year and a half before, it was
[11:40.960 --> 11:46.640]  made public that the federal government secretly hired now 26,000 preachers training their flock
[11:46.640 --> 11:52.880]  to go to FEMA camps to turn in their guns to submit to government. Romans 13, people didn't
[11:52.880 --> 11:56.160]  believe us. And then a year and a half later, it came out in mainstream news and is now public.
[11:57.760 --> 12:04.480]  This congressional source, it's always been accurate, said that gun control, more gun bans,
[12:05.040 --> 12:12.000]  particularly HR 45, total national gun registration, psychological testing, own a gun.
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.040]  You've ever had a misdemeanor, you can't own a gun, that that had been introduced and tagged on
[12:17.680 --> 12:24.720]  through a part of the health spending bill. Well, last night, I went ahead and spent three hours
[12:24.720 --> 12:29.520]  reading most of the 1100 page bill. Remember, we didn't get it till an hour before it passed,
[12:29.520 --> 12:33.280]  and I was on air at the time. And then Friday went home and saw my family and then didn't get
[12:33.280 --> 12:39.760]  around to reading until Saturday. And yes, that congressional aid was correct. Now you'd say,
[12:39.760 --> 12:44.800]  why doesn't the aid just go public? Because under house rules, they get in trouble. See,
[12:44.800 --> 12:49.680]  they didn't have these house rules 100 years ago. It's now a dictatorship of the committee chairman.
[12:49.680 --> 12:54.000]  And so they're in these meetings are not allowed to tell the public when it's in conference.
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.520]  So they have to leak this to us, just like Senator Sessions did and others. First, he leaked it,
[12:59.520 --> 13:04.800]  people said it wasn't true. Then he just released the bill. And legally, he's really allowed to,
[13:04.800 --> 13:13.040]  was just a house, a Senate rule in that case. But, but regardless of that, they stripped out
[13:13.040 --> 13:19.680]  the language about guns, but left the HR 45 language on the mental screening in there
[13:20.560 --> 13:26.720]  for total federalization of all medical records and to make all the psychologists and psychiatrists
[13:26.720 --> 13:31.520]  going back 30, 40 years to load all these records in. So let's say in high school,
[13:31.520 --> 13:35.680]  you went to the psychologist because your parents were, you know, upset because you were depressed
[13:35.680 --> 13:40.640]  and were popping your zits or whatever. Well, now you don't get on a gun. All the military
[13:40.640 --> 13:44.560]  medical records, they've already done this to some extent, but now all the military records,
[13:44.560 --> 13:49.280]  any psychological designation for any reason, you don't get a second amendment.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.880]  And a lot of police are going to be losing their, their peace officers license.
[13:56.160 --> 14:00.880]  I warned you now, we'll see if they're able to implement this, but the language is in there.
[14:00.880 --> 14:07.040]  And last night, I almost did an emergency broadcast. I got my board ops down to the station.
[14:07.040 --> 14:11.200]  I was about to go on there and I just said, you know what, I got to go finish this Obama film.
[14:11.840 --> 14:15.760]  A bunch is going on. I've got this congressional aid warning me high level,
[14:17.520 --> 14:20.880]  but I'm going to wait and see if any of the gun groups pick up on this because I can always
[14:20.880 --> 14:26.640]  cover it Monday. It's already passed. So I didn't go on air at like 11 o'clock last night after
[14:26.640 --> 14:31.120]  I'd been reading the bill and confirmed it. And then I went to gun owners of America this morning.
[14:31.120 --> 14:36.000]  Sure enough, they're on to it. It's a headline on their site. So not just Alex Jones saying it.
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.920]  We now have it right here from gun owners of America.
[14:41.920 --> 14:46.400]  Pork bailout bill could ban guns from millions of Americans. This from gun owners of America,
[14:46.400 --> 14:50.400]  the second largest gun organization, second amendment group in the United States with
[14:50.960 --> 14:55.760]  was the 300,000 members. So they analyze it and warn you right there. So there you have it.
[14:55.760 --> 14:58.640]  But you don't have to go off my secret congressional source.
[14:59.200 --> 15:02.880]  They picked up on it. So it's there for everybody to see.
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.120]  There's a bunch of other gun banning and gun restricting and ban all semi autos, most hand
[15:09.120 --> 15:13.840]  guns, most rifles. There's another bill where the attorney general can just give an order
[15:14.400 --> 15:18.640]  and ban any guns he wants. Like he's a petty God or something, some demigod.
[15:20.880 --> 15:24.640]  And don't think they won't try to pass that because what did the bill,
[15:24.640 --> 15:28.960]  they passed on October 3rd of last year's say known as the banker bailout. It was really a
[15:28.960 --> 15:33.120]  banker takeover. It said in the subsections, and we've read this on air many times,
[15:33.840 --> 15:40.160]  that no agency, no group of government, no one can look into these numbers. It is secret. So,
[15:40.160 --> 15:46.240]  so Congress passes a law handing over their authority and ceding some letter of mark to
[15:46.240 --> 15:51.840]  offshore private banks to literally be above the law. That's fraud. They can't do that.
[15:51.840 --> 15:57.440]  But they did. And now I have all these congressional hearings the last few months where they call
[15:57.440 --> 16:02.560]  up federal reserve chairman in New York, the Fed chairman himself, Bernanke. And they just say,
[16:02.560 --> 16:08.480]  we don't have to tell you. And then Greenspan goes on Lair NewsHour and says, we're above the law.
[16:08.480 --> 16:13.280]  No one can investigate us. We've played that clip before you just Google Greenspan fed above the
[16:13.280 --> 16:20.240]  law. You'll see Lair NewsHour. There's a bunch of other stuff in the bill. It is a total nightmare.
[16:20.240 --> 16:25.520]  But that's why they wanted to rush it through so nobody could read it just like the Patriot Act.
[16:27.920 --> 16:30.880]  We're going to cover all this when we get back and take a lot of phone calls. And we have a big
[16:30.880 --> 16:36.240]  guest coming on with a huge story about FEMA camps and mass grave. The headlines are clear.

[20:48.000 --> 20:51.680]  That's right. The children of the beast are the ones taking over our country,
[20:52.720 --> 20:59.600]  our world. That's all we see throughout history is tyrants, corrupt, wicked criminals getting
[20:59.600 --> 21:04.880]  control of government and then taking control of societies and doing horrible things.
[21:06.240 --> 21:11.440]  Now remember, it had to be passed. No one could read it. They couldn't even have one day to look
[21:11.440 --> 21:16.720]  at the 1100-plus page bill. For the last two weeks they wouldn't let the public see it. They kept
[21:16.720 --> 21:21.680]  changing and it kept going back and forth between the House and Senate. The Revitalization Act,
[21:21.680 --> 21:26.880]  the stimulus bill, it had to be passed. 800 to something billion but it has mandates in it
[21:26.880 --> 21:34.240]  according to CNBC of over $9 trillion in the next four years. So it's really a
[21:34.240 --> 21:39.280]  $9 trillion quote stimulus. It's really an expansion of federal takeover of the states
[21:39.280 --> 21:42.560]  where they take our tax money then bring it back into the states for control.
[21:43.840 --> 21:48.560]  And then, well, let me, here's an article right here. What's the rush, urgent stimulus,
[21:48.560 --> 21:56.000]  on hold for the Obama's weekend off after pushing Congress for weeks to hurry up and
[21:56.000 --> 22:02.080]  pass the massive $787 billion stimulus plan President Obama probably took off for a three-day
[22:02.080 --> 22:08.320]  holiday getaway. Obama arrived at the home in Chicago on Friday and treated his wife to a
[22:08.320 --> 22:17.040]  Valentine's Day dinner downtown last night. The couple was spotted leaving upscale table 52
[22:17.040 --> 22:23.200]  which specializes in southern cuisine with the first lady toting would appear to be a doggy bag.
[22:23.200 --> 22:27.760]  The president plans to spend the president's day weekend in the windy city and is unexpected
[22:27.760 --> 22:34.080]  to sign the bill until Tuesday when he travels to Denver to discuss his economic plans. He's
[22:34.080 --> 22:40.320]  going to wait, cut aside at Friday, he's going to wait one, two, three, four, five days to sign that.
[22:40.320 --> 22:45.200]  Both the House and the Senate passed the bill Friday. The push to get the bill through before
[22:45.200 --> 22:53.600]  the holiday weekend was so frantic, members of Congress didn't have a chance to read the 1071
[22:53.600 --> 22:59.280]  pages of the document before they could vote. In a perfect world, it would have been nice to have
[22:59.280 --> 23:06.560]  had more time to process it, said Ian Kiosky, a spokesman, Representative Gerald Nadler Democrat
[23:06.560 --> 23:10.400]  in New York. Meanwhile, Governor Patterson called yesterday for fiscal restraint with the maximum
[23:10.400 --> 23:14.720]  influx of federal aid. His budget office estimated that New York will receive $24.6
[23:14.720 --> 23:20.880]  billion over the next two years, $4 billion more than first believed. So meet the new boss,
[23:20.880 --> 23:25.840]  same as the old boss, got fooled again. They did the same thing. If the Democrats and Republicans
[23:25.840 --> 23:33.040]  together bought and paid for by Wall Street, they passed the banker bill that is now over
[23:33.040 --> 23:38.720]  $8 trillion, according to major financial publications. But Congress has asked for
[23:38.720 --> 23:42.720]  specifically where the money was spent and they're told, hey, you passed the bill saying no oversight
[23:42.720 --> 23:49.040]  by any agency or any government, period, or any court. And so they said they're laughing at Congress.
[23:49.040 --> 23:53.920]  Most of them are out on the payroll. So why do they care as Rome burns, as Rome collapses around
[23:53.920 --> 24:00.480]  them? That's the idea of a fire sale, implode the economy. And by the way, the supposed banker
[24:00.480 --> 24:05.920]  bailout money, that goes to the banks, taxpayers pay for it. And then the banks loan it back to
[24:05.920 --> 24:11.520]  the government in the stimulus plan. And then I've heard a lot of economists admit that this
[24:11.520 --> 24:20.320]  actually froze more credit because the money going to the banks basically held up any other money
[24:20.320 --> 24:24.240]  actually getting out of the population because it all went right back into government or to offshore
[24:24.240 --> 24:31.840]  banks. So there you have it. They had to have the bill passed. They had to have it passed now.
[24:33.200 --> 24:37.760]  They had to have it passed yesterday, but now they're going to wait four to five days before
[24:37.760 --> 24:42.640]  signing the bill. And it's all a big joke. The whole point was they didn't want anybody
[24:42.640 --> 24:48.000]  reading the bill and no one did read the bill. This is up on info wars.com and present planet.com
[24:48.000 --> 24:54.320]  is from governors of America. Pork bailout bill could ban guns for millions of Americans.
[24:56.400 --> 25:00.560]  And they've already done this. The first thing Bill Clinton did, well, the last thing he did,
[25:00.560 --> 25:10.320]  but they immediately put it into function, was go after veterans. And people always wondered why
[25:10.320 --> 25:14.960]  since the days of Korea, that if you collapse from heat exhaustion or you collapse from being on
[25:14.960 --> 25:19.280]  the front lines for three or four days with no sleep, they would give you a month of leave,
[25:19.280 --> 25:23.360]  but then you would have a psychological designation of post traumatic stress or other things. And
[25:23.360 --> 25:28.720]  then that would be with you for the rest of your life. And then when you now try to go buy a gun
[25:28.720 --> 25:35.760]  since 2000, suddenly veterans everywhere with no criminal record can't buy guns. And they go to the
[25:35.760 --> 25:40.160]  NICS instant check system, the instant registration system. And they're told, well, you, you had a
[25:40.160 --> 25:44.480]  post traumatic stress. And they put hundreds of thousands of vets in there, but they stopped in
[25:44.480 --> 25:52.560]  2002 because of lawsuits. Well, now it's happening again. But it's worse than that. They said that
[25:53.200 --> 25:57.600]  what I see for staff, Rahm Emanuel, you can pull this up just Rahm Emanuel gun control,
[25:57.600 --> 26:02.560]  no fly list. It'll come up for you. And he said in a recent speech and in speeches previous to
[26:02.560 --> 26:09.600]  that, there's quite a few of them that, well, we need to have like a no gun list, like a no fly
[26:09.600 --> 26:15.280]  list. Firstly, so we need to have a no fly list and put you on there. And then you can own a gun
[26:15.280 --> 26:20.000]  over a million Americans in it, a black list, no judge, no jury, no arrest. They just put you on
[26:20.000 --> 26:26.080]  there and it's ever growing. But they said, we need to have a no gun list just, just like that,
[26:26.080 --> 26:30.400]  that's a quote, no criminal list, but they don't arrest you. They don't charge you. You just can't
[26:30.400 --> 26:36.800]  own a gun. And that's done extra judicially. It's outside the courts. It's outside. It's,
[26:36.800 --> 26:41.040]  it's extra legislative. It's just done separately by the bureaucracy.
[26:43.680 --> 26:47.280]  So we have that going on. But here's this article from governors of America.
[26:47.280 --> 26:53.120]  Pork bailout bill could ban guns for millions of Americans. The Obama administration is
[26:53.120 --> 26:57.760]  putting a lot of pressure on Congress to slam through the most recent $800 billion
[26:57.760 --> 27:02.400]  dollar bailout package before anyone has an opportunity to read it. The Obama administration
[27:02.400 --> 27:07.280]  intones that the details are unimportant. The only thing that matters is the bigness. And by
[27:09.200 --> 27:15.280]  shipping a bill of nearly 900 billion plus interest to our children and grandchildren,
[27:15.280 --> 27:19.440]  the package is really, really big, bigger. In fact, the new budget of our entire government
[27:19.440 --> 27:25.760]  for the last 170 years of our country's experience. But now that some of the details are finally
[27:25.760 --> 27:30.720]  starting to leak out of Washington gun owners, and a lot of other analysts are beginning to
[27:30.720 --> 27:36.160]  look at the fine print. And some of it is particularly scary. A particular concern to gun
[27:36.160 --> 27:47.680]  owners are sections 13101 or 13,101 through 13,434 of HR1, which would set up the infrastructure
[27:47.680 --> 27:51.920]  to computerize the medical records of all Americans in a government coordinated database.
[27:51.920 --> 27:58.880]  Now, this was separately in HR45, and they brought it into the bill. And this is to give
[27:58.880 --> 28:04.560]  people psychological designations to then ban their gun ownership. This is bigger than the
[28:04.560 --> 28:11.120]  68 Gun Control Act that restricted felons access to firearms. And it goes on. This
[28:11.120 --> 28:19.280]  would do by establishing a national coordinator for health information technology tasked with,
[28:19.280 --> 28:23.600]  among other things, providing information to help guide medical decisions at a time
[28:23.600 --> 28:30.480]  and place of care. And they state in HR45 that they're going to use this to restrict people
[28:30.480 --> 28:35.360]  who ever had a mental designation from owning a firearm. And notice how the last 30 years,
[28:35.360 --> 28:38.720]  they advertise, oh, you're depressed, oh, you had a car wreck, oh, you're in high school,
[28:38.720 --> 28:43.040]  oh, go to the counselor, oh, get on Ritalin, oh, get on Prozac, over 100 million prescriptions
[28:43.040 --> 28:48.160]  in 2008 for Prozac. And to get that paid for by insurance, they have hundreds and hundreds of
[28:48.160 --> 28:53.920]  mental designations. And they say, oh, you got ADHD, or oh, you got post traumatic stress, or
[28:53.920 --> 28:57.840]  oh, you're bipolar, or oh, you've got chronic depression, we're going to put you on this drug
[28:57.840 --> 29:04.000]  and it's all paid for. And they state understand the new attorney general holder stated in lawsuits
[29:04.000 --> 29:08.720]  in court and before the Supreme Court, Rahm Emanuel introduced bills previously, the new chief of
[29:08.720 --> 29:13.360]  staff. This whole crew says they're going to ban you from owning guns. And they're going to do it
[29:13.360 --> 29:21.840]  outside of law through this new database, just do it executively themselves. Coming up your phone
[29:21.840 --> 29:26.240]  calls. And then is FEMA and DHS preparing for mass graves in Marshall Lawner, Chicago? We've
[29:26.240 --> 29:34.400]  got the reporter on that broke the story and talked to one of the emergency planners. Stay with us.
[29:34.400 --> 29:39.760]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential

[29:56.560 --> 30:02.160]  the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection. Now you can fight internal

[33:56.160 --> 34:04.000]  Also, Hillary Clinton, a whole bunch of other people, the new energy secretary Steven Chu.
[34:05.120 --> 34:09.200]  I mean, I've seen five, six articles last day where they're all announcing
[34:09.200 --> 34:16.320]  U.S. senators are announcing we need a carbon tax on all human activity that will fund the
[34:16.320 --> 34:21.520]  government in a shortfall. Now, when I made the film in-game blueprint for global enslavement,
[34:22.080 --> 34:26.560]  I noticed that they were denying that that was their plan and, of course, we would show there's
[34:27.440 --> 34:32.640]  somewhat confidential and in some cases secret documents from the North American Union meetings
[34:32.640 --> 34:38.320]  and other things they've been having and it was all there. But people said, oh, I was making
[34:38.320 --> 34:45.280]  that up. There wasn't any plan for taxes to, quote, save the earth. But now they are admitting that.
[34:45.280 --> 34:50.160]  Buried in the New York Times article, replete with pontification of Obama's energy secretary,
[34:50.160 --> 34:55.440]  Steven Chu, we find what the globalists have in mind for us, carbon taxes, so crippling,
[34:55.440 --> 35:00.400]  they will drive more jobs out of the economy and send energy costs through the stratosphere,
[35:00.400 --> 35:05.360]  Curt Demo writes for infowars.com. According to the New York Times, Dr. Chu said reaching
[35:05.360 --> 35:09.600]  agreement on legislation to combat climate change would be difficult in the current
[35:09.600 --> 35:14.080]  recession because any scheme to regulate greenhouse gas emissions would probably cause
[35:14.080 --> 35:19.920]  energy prices to rise and drive manufacturing jobs out of the country to other countries where
[35:19.920 --> 35:26.000]  energy is cheaper. Well, or where they won't have the carbon tax rules like China, India,
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.360]  Mexico, and 160 others. In fact, they have no carbon restrictions and so it will actually increase
[35:31.360 --> 35:35.920]  the carbon footprint. But the globalists aren't worried. They know carbon dioxide is what plants
[35:35.920 --> 35:41.040]  breathe and is actually good. It's just a fraud for the dummy Uppies in America so they can
[35:41.040 --> 35:48.640]  regulate every facet of your life. So that's there as well. All those denials, yet we are right again,
[35:48.640 --> 35:53.120]  not because we're smart. We know how to read the globalist documents and they rule the planet. So
[35:54.160 --> 35:57.520]  we're accurate. They just don't want you to know about it until it's too late.
[35:57.520 --> 36:05.280]  So we'll get into that report as well. There was a mysterious plane crash that all of you
[36:05.280 --> 36:12.080]  heard about back on Friday. 9-11 activists who sued government killed in Buffalo plane crash.
[36:12.080 --> 36:16.960]  One of the passengers aboard the plane that crashed into a house 10 miles from Buffalo,
[36:16.960 --> 36:22.320]  New York airport was actually late on Thursday was a 9-11 widow who had questioned the official
[36:22.320 --> 36:29.280]  account of the attack, sued the government and consistently lobbied for an investigative commission
[36:29.280 --> 36:35.440]  to investigate 9-11. And she of course had, I had interviewed her years ago, many others
[36:35.440 --> 36:40.480]  had interviewed her. She believed that 9-11 clearly was an inside job. She got a meeting with Obama
[36:41.120 --> 36:47.520]  privately and she's dead now. I am suing because unlike other investigative avenues,
[36:47.520 --> 36:52.800]  my lawsuit requires all testimony be given under oath and fully uses powers to compel evidence.
[36:52.800 --> 36:58.720]  Eckhart wrote in December 2003 in a statement entitled my silence cannot be bought. The victim's
[36:58.720 --> 37:04.880]  fund was not created in the spirit of compassion. Lawmakers capped the liability of the airlines
[37:04.880 --> 37:09.120]  at the behest of lobbyist. By the way, she lost her husband on the 96th floor of one of the towers.
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.240]  She continues at the behest of lobbyist who descended on Washington while the September
[37:14.240 --> 37:19.760]  11th fire still smoldered, she wrote. Other September relatives who accepted settlements
[37:19.760 --> 37:24.320]  forfeited their right to sue the airline airport security companies or other US organizations
[37:24.320 --> 37:30.640]  that could have been faltered for negligence and inadequate security measures. This ensured
[37:30.640 --> 37:36.640]  that very little details of the attacks emerged outside of the government appointed 9-11 commission.
[37:36.640 --> 37:45.440]  She went on to write in her statement, I want to know what went on so wrong with our intelligence
[37:45.440 --> 37:51.760]  and security systems that a band of religious fanatics was able to turn four US passenger jets
[37:55.120 --> 38:00.880]  into an enemy force, attack our cities and kill 3,000 civilians with terrifying ease.
[38:00.880 --> 38:08.000]  I want to know why 210 story skyscrapers collapsed in less than two hours and why escape and rescue
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.280]  options were so limited and that went on from there. She was the co-founder of the steering
[38:13.280 --> 38:19.120]  committee of the group Voices for September 11th. Ms. Eckhart joined other activists in pushing
[38:19.120 --> 38:28.720]  for an investigative commission. She met with Obama days before she died. Obama remarks on
[38:28.720 --> 38:39.520]  plane crash stimulus. Thank you all for being here. Before I begin, I want to say a brief word
[38:40.480 --> 38:45.680]  with the terrible tragedy that took place outside of Buffalo last night. Our thoughts and prayers
[38:45.680 --> 38:50.000]  are with the families and friends who lost loved ones and as always our thanks goes out to the
[38:50.000 --> 38:55.920]  brave first responders who arrived immediately. It goes on tragic events such as these remind us
[38:55.920 --> 39:00.720]  of the fragility of our life, the value of the end of every single day. One person who stood
[39:02.160 --> 39:07.680]  that will, this is him babbling because it's not me reading, one person who stood that well
[39:07.680 --> 39:13.920]  was Beverly Eckhart who was on that flight and who I met with just days ago. You see,
[39:13.920 --> 39:18.720]  Beverly lost her husband on 9-11, became a tireless advocate for those families whose lives
[39:18.720 --> 39:23.920]  were forever changed on September 11th day. Of course, she knows Hillary Clinton is a high
[39:23.920 --> 39:29.680]  power Democrat. She was, she's dead now. So, there is that report right there, very, very
[39:29.680 --> 39:38.960]  suspicious. If you do the actuary math on someone who lost a husband from 9-11 with someone who
[39:38.960 --> 39:44.080]  had just met with the president, with someone who just died in a plane crash and the fact that she
[39:44.080 --> 39:50.240]  was a 9-11 truther and it is billions to one conservatively. I want to go to Pat Tripp, Joe,
[39:50.240 --> 39:56.400]  Lindsay and others, but first let's go to Zandra in Texas. You are on the air, Zandra.
[39:56.960 --> 40:02.960]  And I believe I'm speaking to you. I'll thank you very much. I'm from St. Louis, Missouri and I moved
[40:02.960 --> 40:09.280]  here to San Antonio. I worked for FEMA. I was a night auditor at a small hotel right outside of
[40:09.280 --> 40:14.800]  Tyler and they had tornadoes in different counties, Smith County being one of them. Can you hear me?
[40:14.800 --> 40:22.000]  Yes, I can. Oh, okay. They came in at night, set up at the old courthouse that was vacant
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.920]  and I thought everything was fine. You know, they hired me. They called me a local hire because
[40:25.920 --> 40:32.080]  they hired me on the spot as an auditor. So, I'm looking at all the 18-wilders come in with all
[40:32.080 --> 40:39.120]  the equipment and the desk and the chairs and the phone lines putting in. Okay, everything seemed
[40:39.120 --> 40:47.120]  perfect. And then at 5.01 when the day was over with, I'm looking at these same people who were
[40:47.120 --> 40:53.680]  so articulate during the day come to, I guess, werewolves. I don't know another name because at
[40:53.680 --> 40:58.480]  night, they would party not in the hotel that I happened to be an auditor, but across the streets
[40:58.480 --> 41:05.440]  of Ammanian. Get on top of the pool table, raise their dresses up, have all... Well, ma'am, ma'am,
[41:05.440 --> 41:10.480]  ma'am, just to be specific, so you were a contract worker for FEMA. When was this?
[41:11.520 --> 41:16.800]  This was, I guess, the early 90s. It's right outside of Tyler. It's called...
[41:16.800 --> 41:20.640]  Well, I mean, we know a lot of government people like to party. A lot of folks, period, do that.
[41:20.640 --> 41:24.000]  Specifically, I'm not trying to poo-poo what you're saying, but...
[41:24.000 --> 41:24.400]  No.
[41:24.400 --> 41:27.680]  I mean, where's the story going? Just there, a bunch of all of them.
[41:27.680 --> 41:31.120]  Oh, okay. I just saw a lot of the equipment come up missing.
[41:31.120 --> 41:35.840]  Oh, well, I mean, there's billions and billions of years stolen by the Pentagon alone,
[41:35.840 --> 41:40.480]  just in equipment, but the Pentagon, according to the Associated Press, has stolen $4 trillion
[41:40.480 --> 41:45.520]  out of the pension funds since 1998 until last year. They've had congressional hearings,
[41:46.160 --> 41:50.640]  and Homeland Security and others in the Department of Defense won't say where the money went.
[41:50.640 --> 41:55.520]  So, yes, there is massive fraud. That's what government is throughout history,
[41:55.520 --> 41:59.920]  and criminals gravitate into government positions of power to take advantage of that,
[41:59.920 --> 42:02.320]  but it's good to hear from you. I appreciate you calling.
[42:02.320 --> 42:04.960]  Let's talk to Lindsey in Idaho. Lindsey, you're on the air.
[42:05.520 --> 42:07.040]  Hello, Alex. How are you today?
[42:07.040 --> 42:07.440]  Good, sir.
[42:08.800 --> 42:14.880]  Interesting thing. You're always asking people that listen to you how to fight this thing
[42:16.720 --> 42:25.840]  with nonviolent uses, and I think that one of the best ways is logic and using their own words
[42:25.840 --> 42:33.040]  against them, and I refer to an article on your site today about traded gun for a rose.
[42:33.040 --> 42:34.400]  I'm sure you're familiar with it.
[42:34.400 --> 42:36.800]  Yeah, I have it here right in front of me. Let me give people the headline,
[42:37.760 --> 42:43.440]  Traded Gun for a Rose in South Carolina on Valentine's Day. This is done to have the news
[42:43.440 --> 42:45.600]  images of people handing in guns to...
[42:45.600 --> 42:46.240]  Beautiful.
[42:46.240 --> 42:52.400] ...to semantically train them to turn their guns in and to have the idea that guns are dirty
[42:52.400 --> 42:57.600]  and guns are bad, and they have the police saying this, and they have these gun buybacks everywhere.
[42:57.600 --> 43:00.320]  Now, here is my point, Alex.
[43:01.360 --> 43:05.840]  Logically speaking, if you read the article, which I'm sure most of the listeners have,
[43:06.400 --> 43:12.720]  it was about, okay, quote, a handgun was worth $100 gift card while the rifle or shot gun
[43:12.720 --> 43:16.960]  netted $50. Here it is. This is the key.
[43:16.960 --> 43:18.960]  Stay there. We'll come back to you after the break, okay?
[43:18.960 --> 43:19.760]  Okay, please.
[43:19.760 --> 43:22.320]  Put you on hold. We'll come back to Lindsay after the break.
[43:23.120 --> 43:25.360]  Yeah, they're getting you ready for gun confiscation.
[43:25.360 --> 43:28.160]  They're training the police that it's all kosher and acceptable.
[43:28.160 --> 43:30.960]  They want your guns. They want you to be their slave. It's that simple.
[43:30.960 --> 43:32.800]  They can't stand the fact you're free and independent.
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.480]  What will you do when the economy collapses?
[43:36.480 --> 43:39.440]  Store shelves are empty and your stored food is gone.

[45:34.080 --> 45:37.840]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a
[45:37.840 --> 45:42.160]  pH-balanced alkaline environment. But as you know, most people are overly acidic
[45:42.160 --> 45:45.280]  due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[45:45.280 --> 45:49.920]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of
[45:49.920 --> 45:54.480]  disease. People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar,
[45:54.480 --> 45:59.040]  mental clarity, and loss of weight. It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline
[45:59.040 --> 46:02.720]  water. But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[46:02.720 --> 46:06.560]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[46:06.560 --> 46:11.360]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.

[46:36.640 --> 46:40.480]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[46:40.480 --> 46:43.920]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science,
[46:43.920 --> 46:49.200]  one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors. These emergency backup systems provide life-saving
[46:49.200 --> 46:54.480]  electrical power when you need it most. Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly,
[46:54.480 --> 46:59.040]  emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free. It's like having an electric power plant
[46:59.040 --> 47:03.680]  running quietly in your own home. Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers,
[47:03.680 --> 47:08.560]  and even keep food from spoiling. Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts,
[47:08.560 --> 47:11.600]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[47:11.600 --> 47:16.640]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.

[47:45.440 --> 47:51.280]  All right, we are back. Let's go back to Lindsey in Idaho. He was bringing up this article,
[47:51.280 --> 47:57.920]  and I see these every week all over the country. They have gun buybacks, and it's normally old
[47:57.920 --> 48:04.880]  women whose husband has died, and they'll go turn in. I've seen cases where it's these fine,
[48:04.880 --> 48:10.640]  carved English shotguns. They might be worth $10,000 in some cases, and they get 50 bucks,
[48:10.640 --> 48:15.440]  100 bucks, a gift card. They're, uh, it's dirty. It's bad. They'll show them the news. I mean,
[48:15.440 --> 48:18.960]  get rid of it. Please, it's devilish. Get an officer's like, absolutely. I'll get rid of that
[48:18.960 --> 48:22.400]  evil thing for you, ma'am, and they are caught many times selling them out the back door at the
[48:22.400 --> 48:29.120]  police station. A lot of police have been in trouble for that. And, um, but the women feel
[48:29.120 --> 48:36.320]  safe predominantly. It's mainly women with the cops, with handguns on their sides. See, it's
[48:36.320 --> 48:41.680]  safe when government has a gun, but not when a slave has it. This is the domestication,
[48:41.680 --> 48:46.160]  the institutionalization of the population. They have billboards up all over the country for at
[48:46.160 --> 48:51.520]  least a decade that show a picture of a revolver pointed at you threateningly. And it says report
[48:51.520 --> 48:57.280]  illegal guns. And then people looking at that think all guns are illegal. This is a perception
[48:57.280 --> 49:02.880]  battle when they're not, and it's been done by design. And it's the same thing here with
[49:02.880 --> 49:06.560]  these gun buybacks, the news image of people lined up turning guns. And then they say on the
[49:06.560 --> 49:09.920]  article, we're doing background checks and ballistics on all the guns, and we're going to
[49:09.920 --> 49:13.120]  come arrest you of anything illegal has been done with them. I mean, what idiot would go
[49:13.120 --> 49:18.480]  incriminate themselves and do this to have themselves registered and turned it in? But
[49:18.480 --> 49:23.600]  look, don't worry criminals in government record gun sales record ammo sales. They're selling out
[49:23.600 --> 49:29.280]  of ammo and guns everywhere now. We are on to you. So you may have some idiots that will come
[49:29.280 --> 49:34.720]  turn the guns into you as if there's something evil. But the public knows the truth. They know
[49:34.720 --> 49:38.400]  Hitler was for gun control. They know the first gun control laws this nation where it gets black
[49:38.400 --> 49:44.080]  people. They know that criminal governments as the founding fathers said want your guns.
[49:45.040 --> 49:51.920]  But go ahead and make your point there, Lindsey. Okay, Alex, here's the logic in the rest of the
[49:51.920 --> 49:59.920]  article. As it said, one man turned in six handguns were $600 and gift cards. Now quickly,
[50:00.640 --> 50:06.800]  there was no amnesty for those turning in guns. The weapons were checked to see if they were stolen.
[50:06.800 --> 50:13.360]  And then I love this part names and addresses were jotted down makes it sound kind of you know,
[50:13.360 --> 50:22.880]  no big deal jotted down. Here is my point. This guy that turns in six handguns in South Carolina,
[50:22.880 --> 50:29.360]  if you want to debunk associated press and whoever wrote this article and about all this,
[50:29.360 --> 50:38.240]  this guy ought to be on the front page news as the best American in the country. He turned
[50:38.240 --> 50:48.720]  in six handguns. Who is he? My point being, I think this is Psyup. I don't think this person
[50:48.720 --> 50:56.640]  exists. Sir, sir, in 1998 or was it not the the Texas legislature was in session. It made
[50:56.640 --> 51:01.440]  national news. We're in there and they bring up these two young black men to say we're gangbangers,
[51:01.440 --> 51:07.120]  we're dangerous, you know, you need to ban the guns or people. It was playing race card.
[51:07.120 --> 51:13.120]  Absolutely. Then we caught the guy who had brought them there paying them off and it
[51:14.080 --> 51:17.840]  came out in the statesman that was illegal. The legislature had to admit it,
[51:18.400 --> 51:23.520]  violated health, house ethics rules. The whole point is that was staged. And yes,
[51:23.520 --> 51:27.840]  I guarantee you this was handgun control incorporated. They've been caught at other events
[51:27.840 --> 51:33.440]  staging these because nobody's really showing up in mass. I'm saying Alex is simply this.
[51:33.440 --> 51:40.640]  If anybody was to write in to South Carolina newspaper AP, I don't care and say this guy is
[51:40.640 --> 51:46.080]  great. We need his name. We want to put him on the front page. I would be willing to bet
[51:46.080 --> 51:53.280]  what's left of my money that he doesn't exist. Absolutely. There's no doubt. And that's
[51:53.280 --> 51:59.360]  meant to prime the pump with the news cameras. They have this on TV too. So old ladies then
[51:59.360 --> 52:04.640]  get into the pack mentality, the herd mentality, the sheet mentality and run down and turn their
[52:04.640 --> 52:12.560]  guns in. It's absolutely unbelievable. And again, AP, all I'm saying Alex is simply this.
[52:12.560 --> 52:20.480]  If people would read what is even given to them by the AP and then dissect it and then logically
[52:20.480 --> 52:27.200]  say, okay, let's go at it this way. That is a good way to fight the disinformation that's coming
[52:27.200 --> 52:32.400]  down in this day and time. Now, I agree. There was a big professor up at the University of Chicago
[52:32.400 --> 52:38.240]  about six years ago who wrote a big book saying the colonies were anti-gun. Five percent of people
[52:38.240 --> 52:43.520]  owned rifles. It wasn't a pro-gun culture. The war wasn't started over guns. He used fake census
[52:43.520 --> 52:48.480]  and church records of births. And then we got on air and said, this is fake. This is a lie. We
[52:48.480 --> 52:52.880]  know the history. And people did an investigation. It turned out it was all lies and he was kicked
[52:52.880 --> 52:59.280]  out and lost his tenure. And absolutely that's how they operate is deception. That's their
[52:59.280 --> 53:03.200]  favorite tool. Look, I would have gotten to the story. Notice it was in my stack, but I wasn't
[53:03.200 --> 53:07.040]  going to get to it because I don't have time. I've got too many news stories, too many calls,
[53:07.040 --> 53:11.760]  too much to cover. But yes, I have stacks of similar news. You notice you called about it and I had
[53:11.760 --> 53:15.600]  it in the stack every day. But understand it creates the perception. The article is written
[53:15.600 --> 53:20.400]  like who their names are written down who they might get in trouble as if the guns were illegal.
[53:20.400 --> 53:25.360]  And that's why they were turning them in as if this, the average handgun probably costs 400 bucks.
[53:26.320 --> 53:31.520]  This guy could have gone to make thousands off these six guns, selling them, selling them to
[53:31.520 --> 53:37.680]  a gun dealer, totally legal, but it didn't happen. Let's go to Pat in Canada. Pat, you're on the air.
[53:37.680 --> 53:48.000]  Okay. Go ahead, Pat. Okay, let's talk to Tripped in Wisconsin. You're on the air.
[53:48.960 --> 53:56.160]  Oh, that was the wrong caller. Now, Tripped, go ahead. Alex? Yes. How you doing? Good. I originally
[53:56.160 --> 54:01.760]  called him to talk about the internet too, but the gun thing brought up an interesting point.
[54:01.760 --> 54:08.880]  When they were taking these guns away in South Carolina, it reminded me of the UK where they
[54:08.880 --> 54:15.360]  took all the guns away. Well, in the UK, in the UK first for decades, they had gun buybacks
[54:15.360 --> 54:20.720]  and gun amnesty before they were illegal. It creates the perception. Then they registered them,
[54:20.720 --> 54:26.320]  then they confiscated them just like they've started in Canada. Go ahead. Right. And it was
[54:26.320 --> 54:31.280]  funny because I was watching a video, Britain's warning to Americans where all these Britons
[54:31.280 --> 54:36.000]  are saying, please learn from our mistakes. Don't let them do this to you. We're trying our best
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.800]  to reverse it, but once it's done, it's almost impossible to reverse. I go back and check the
[54:40.800 --> 54:46.880]  video a few days ago. It says YouTube had to pull this video because the NRA requested that it be
[54:46.880 --> 54:53.360]  taken down. I just thought that was pretty funny. That's right. The NRA is a pro gun control group,
[54:53.920 --> 54:58.960]  and more and more of that's coming out. They pushed the 68 Gun Control Act and got it passed.
[54:58.960 --> 55:04.560]  They were set up by the federal government in 1870. They're there to neutralize and control gun
[55:04.560 --> 55:09.920]  owners. And now gunners of America is now on record. The NRA is a pro gun control group,
[55:09.920 --> 55:16.160]  but they pose like their pro gun. Look, bottom line, the criminals in government are criminals.
[55:16.160 --> 55:20.800]  They're looting. They're robbing you. We're in offshore bank receivership. One of the first
[55:20.800 --> 55:25.200]  things the IMF and World Bank do when they take over third world nation is order them to confiscate
[55:25.200 --> 55:30.640]  the guns if they want more loans. That's what's happening here in the United States. It's happening.
[55:30.640 --> 55:36.640]  They've introduced bills to ban all semi-automatic rifles, all semi-automatic handguns. It's
[55:36.640 --> 55:41.680]  introduced. It's happening. Let's go ahead and talk to Bill in Pennsylvania. Bill, you're on the air.
[55:42.800 --> 55:48.320]  How are you doing, Alex? You're a great American. Hey, I wanted to tell you two things. I've been
[55:48.320 --> 55:56.160]  changing a lot of people's minds about 9-11 just by showing them now the articles about NIST
[55:56.720 --> 56:02.320]  and building number seven versus the Beijing Hotel that burned. And if you've been watching CNN,
[56:02.320 --> 56:07.200]  they've been showing really, really close pictures of the ground of the plane that fell in Buffalo.
[56:07.200 --> 56:13.440]  And you can see the tail section. The NTSB guy came out and said that we found the engines,
[56:13.440 --> 56:18.960]  the wings, and everything. And they showed it when it was on fire and how it all flamed up.
[56:18.960 --> 56:25.200]  Well, I'm showing people that picture and that video, and then I show them the video in Pennsylvania
[56:25.200 --> 56:28.960]  that the plane hit the ground. And obviously, it was nothing but a hole when all that is wood
[56:28.960 --> 56:34.400]  should have been torched. Well, let me add something. It's up on infowars.com right now.
[56:34.960 --> 56:39.200]  I interviewed the firefighters four years ago when they were in the Philadelphia Daily News
[56:39.200 --> 56:45.040]  saying they found three of the four black boxes from the planes that hit tower one and two.
[56:45.040 --> 56:50.160]  The FBI grabbed the boxes, declared national security. That was in the news. Now several
[56:50.160 --> 56:54.800]  federal agencies have come out and said, yes, we found the boxes and we don't know why the FBI
[56:54.800 --> 56:59.680]  won't release them. That was mainstream news on Friday. Steve Watson did a story about it. Paul
[56:59.680 --> 57:04.960]  Watson did a story about it at prisonplanet.com. So the point is, it is an inside job, folks.
[57:04.960 --> 57:11.520]  Most definitely, Alex. And I tell you right now, you have one of the greatest shows and you have
[57:11.520 --> 57:17.680]  the greatest listening group out there. And I think it's time that we organize and march to
[57:17.680 --> 57:22.880]  Washington and sit on their porch and say, hey, it's time for answers. Thanks a lot.
[57:22.880 --> 57:26.640]  Hey, I appreciate your call. Well, the American people can't march. They're savior,
[57:26.640 --> 57:31.600]  Obama's here. He's going to save us for everything Bush did. Meanwhile, I've never seen this many
[57:31.600 --> 57:37.360]  lobbyists put into power. He swore, he pledged no lobbyists or no one that's given me donations
[57:37.360 --> 57:42.640]  and power positions. And I'm making the Obama deception film right now and I had too many
[57:42.640 --> 57:48.800]  examples. I only give like 10, every major cabinet position, not just lobbyists, top lobbyists,
[57:48.800 --> 57:56.160]  top Raytheon, top Goldman Sachs. If they're over health care, health and human services,
[57:56.160 --> 58:00.880]  they're the former top lobbyists for the big hospitals or the big drug companies. And it'll
[58:00.880 --> 58:06.000]  be 10, 20, 30, 40 deep where every position is lobbyist. He said he was going to get us out of
[58:06.000 --> 58:11.280]  Iraq in six months, then 16. Now it's 23. Now he says maybe never. Doubling the troops in Afghanistan.
[58:11.280 --> 58:15.760]  Why about that? Said he didn't nap, didn't get. Now says he's going to expand nap, didn't get.
[58:15.760 --> 58:21.920]  I mean, the lies go on and on and on and on. But he smiles nice. He tells you he loves you.
[58:22.800 --> 58:28.000]  Oh my goodness. Hi, this is Ted Anderson introducing a new way to listen to GCN on

[58:55.840 --> 59:00.640]  forcing Americans into poverty, is free enterprise, flawed, or is our monetary system forcing us into
[59:00.640 --> 59:04.720]  perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes. The answers are in Griffin's book,
[59:04.720 --> 59:08.240]  The Creature from Jekyll Island. Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about
[59:08.240 --> 59:12.320]  the Fed and central banking. Hi, Ted Anderson, I will give a US silver dollar to everyone who

[59:27.760 --> 59:31.920]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[59:31.920 --> 59:37.360]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver,
[59:37.360 --> 59:41.920]  who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein,
[59:41.920 --> 59:47.120]  nitrates, or saline solutions. Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles,
[59:47.120 --> 59:52.320]  it can be better utilized at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they
[59:52.320 --> 59:57.200]  can to modern-day antibiotics. Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements,
[59:57.200 --> 1:00:01.440]  including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-bag guarantee on the colloidal
[1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:05.920]  products we produce. For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts
[1:00:05.920 --> 1:00:10.800]  against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.

[1:00:26.720 --> 1:00:38.720]  Thank you for listening to GCS. E.K.L.B.J. Alston, it's 5 o'clock.
[1:00:38.720 --> 1:00:44.560]  I.R.N. USA Radio News. I'm Jody Jordan. President Barack Obama will sign his 787
[1:00:44.560 --> 1:00:48.400]  billion economic stimulus bill into law this Tuesday in Denver.
[1:00:48.400 --> 1:00:52.720]  This morning, I'm pleased to say that after a loggily debate, full of healthy differences of
[1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:56.960]  opinion, we've delivered real and tangible progress for the American people.
[1:00:56.960 --> 1:01:01.280]  It's a big victory for the new president. Democrats say the money will create millions
[1:01:01.280 --> 1:01:05.120]  of good-paying jobs and help keep families in crisis afloat.
[1:01:05.920 --> 1:01:11.360]  China isn't too happy about parts of the U.S. stimulus package that favors the use of American
[1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:17.600]  goods to help rebuild the economy. An editorial by China's official news agency calls the bill
[1:01:17.600 --> 1:01:24.800]  poison that will hurt efforts to solve the global financial crisis. And the grim task of removing
[1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:30.560]  the bodies of the victims killed in Thursday's plane crash outside Buffalo, New York continues today.
[1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:37.680]  This is I.R.N. USA Radio News. Men and women, if you've got 10 to 30 pounds or more to lose,

[1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:40.800]  People at church services across Australia today mourn the victims of the deadly wildfires.
[1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:45.840]  More than 180 people were killed in some 1,800 homes destroyed.
[1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:51.520]  U.S. National Park Service spokesman Doug Alexander tells the Australian counterparts
[1:02:51.520 --> 1:02:56.080]  that American firefighters want to help. I've heard that they're extremely bad. You've had a
[1:02:56.080 --> 1:03:07.840]  terrible loss of light, a fantastic fire spread, cities burned. We've heard a lot in the last two
[1:03:07.840 --> 1:03:14.160]  weeks, so it's been good and I can understand your folks are fatigued. So that's why we're here to help.
[1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:18.880]  And leftover damage from Hurricane Ike didn't keep hundreds of revelers from gathering in
[1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:25.200]  Galveston, Texas yesterday to celebrate an annual Mardi Gras tradition. It's parade. We're open for
[1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:30.720]  a good party, pay back all our bills. We didn't get nothing from REMA. For more news and analysis,

[1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:11.120]  Northern Illinois University has held a candlelight vigil to mark one year since a suicidal
[1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:17.280]  gunman shot and killed five students before turning the gun on himself. Here's Rupa Chenoy.
[1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:23.520]  It began with the memorial service and it was kind of in the darkened auditorium and there were hundreds
[1:04:23.520 --> 1:04:28.400]  of people there and it was very interesting to see this kind of community that was formed from the
[1:04:28.400 --> 1:04:34.560]  tragedy kind of reunite. NIU is also planning a commemoration and a wreathling for the one-year
[1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:40.640]  anniversary. Some Republicans in the Illinois House want Democratic U.S. Senator Roland Burras
[1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:47.680]  investigated for perjury. Here's John O'Connor. Senator Burras now says that he was approached by
[1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:53.920]  Robert Blagojevich, the former governor's brother and campaign chairman to host a fundraiser for
[1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:59.120]  the governor. The disclosure yesterday is at odds with Burras's testimony to a state house
[1:04:59.120 --> 1:05:05.040]  impeachment committee in January. And negotiators for the United Auto Workers have walked out of
[1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:11.200]  concession talks with General Murs. Here's Tom Krishna. The GM talks broke off because of a
[1:05:11.200 --> 1:05:16.800]  dispute over this retiree health care trust that the company is required to pay into. The contract
[1:05:16.800 --> 1:05:22.880]  requires that GM pay billions of dollars into this trust fund. GM wants to swap those cash payments
[1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:28.800]  out for GM stock. GM has until Tuesday to submit a plan to the government showing how it can become
[1:05:28.800 --> 1:05:37.200]  viable. I'm Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News. SouthSummit.com is the place for top name brand

[1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:22.160]  It is hour number two of this abbreviated Sunday transmission. I'm live four hours a day, 11 a.m.
[1:07:22.160 --> 1:07:27.040]  to 3 p.m. central standard time. I come back on Sunday for an abbreviated four to six p.m.
[1:07:27.040 --> 1:07:33.920]  central standard time. Thank you for joining us. You know, normally I don't go with stories that
[1:07:33.920 --> 1:07:39.680]  aren't completely documented out in the open, but when I am aware separately that everything
[1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:44.960]  in the story has already been proven and admitted in other mainstream or government documents,
[1:07:44.960 --> 1:07:49.600]  then I cover it. Again, a year and a half, this is now three years ago, but a year and a half
[1:07:49.600 --> 1:07:54.080]  before it became mainstream news, I was sent secret FEMA documents from a pastor. Then I got
[1:07:54.080 --> 1:07:59.600]  a second group of them. FEMA found out which particular pastor had sent it to me, went and
[1:07:59.600 --> 1:08:05.600]  threatened them, and it said that they were paying preachers, now 26,000 of them. This ties in with
[1:08:05.600 --> 1:08:10.640]  InfraGuard. You can Google that with 20 plus thousand executives that have shoot-to-kill orders,
[1:08:10.640 --> 1:08:15.040]  martial law powers, and they're expanding that. It's part of continuity of government
[1:08:15.040 --> 1:08:18.960]  infrastructure protection. And in the documents it says, this is how you teach your flock to
[1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:24.720]  take force inoculations, to go to the FEMA camp, to follow the orders of troops, to turn their
[1:08:24.720 --> 1:08:30.320]  firearms in. Now that's been on mainstream TV and radio and in government documents, and FEMA
[1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:34.560]  now admits it because we exposed it and they had to put their spin on it. But it's now mainstream
[1:08:34.560 --> 1:08:39.040]  news, and it's mainstream news. They're going to put our putting 20,000 regular army troops to
[1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:42.880]  patrol American streets, and they're going to use Marines, and that's now in the news that they're
[1:08:42.880 --> 1:08:48.160]  suddenly at DUI checkpoints and car wrecks for PR. They're unveiling it under PR. You know,
[1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:51.840]  you're not against getting people out of wrecked cars, are you on the highway? The Marines are
[1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:58.880]  here to help. You're not for drunk drivers, are you? Now I remember a Rocky Mountain news story
[1:08:58.880 --> 1:09:04.480]  out of Colorado in 2002 with the headline, Governor prepares mass graves and incinerators for
[1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:10.880]  bio weapons release. And FEMA and the CDC now admit that they're prepared for this. Now when
[1:09:10.880 --> 1:09:16.800]  county officials get shocked by it, they don't know where to go look for the original backstory.
[1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:22.000]  Also, FEMA lies to them, even though it's open source documented and they could find out if they
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:27.040]  knew where to look. That's like towns where they see an army base that have thousands of federal
[1:09:27.040 --> 1:09:33.040]  and state prisoners on it in, quote, forced labor. They sign a waiver to get a shorter sentence to
[1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:38.320]  then be under labor, but then they're basically slaves. They don't know how to Google civilian
[1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:44.320]  inmate labor camp program. Civilian inmate labor camp program. It was secret in 86 when they started
[1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:48.800]  it. The feds were doing it to train military how to keep U.S. prisoners that were non-military
[1:09:48.800 --> 1:09:55.760]  related. And they declassified it in 97 and we've covered it ever since. But neighbors who were
[1:09:55.760 --> 1:10:01.280]  by these camps all over the country, like Aniston, Alabama, there's 24 of them now. There was 12
[1:10:01.280 --> 1:10:06.160]  when they first started it back in the 90s when it first leaked out. It started in the 80s. So
[1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:12.160]  there's some backstory that FEMA indeed with these integration centers, with these threat
[1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:18.400]  integration centers, fusion centers are federalizing everything. And there's now executive orders out
[1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:23.840]  in PDD 51 and John Warren Defense Authorization Act and Pentagon Directives saying they're going to
[1:10:23.840 --> 1:10:27.600]  have camps and put people in them and they've built the camps and it's been in the Houston
[1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:32.080]  Chronicles. So all that's public. But then city officials and county officials, when they know
[1:10:32.080 --> 1:10:38.320]  about it, they're then scared to talk to the public. Now a reporter has done the full interview.
[1:10:38.320 --> 1:10:41.920]  This reporter we're about to talk to has heard the full interview. He knows the county official.
[1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:46.160]  He's in Indiana on the Illinois border, but we're not going to release the official's name
[1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:51.760]  and emergency management because the person, I guess, is scared and we'll find out. But the
[1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:56.960]  point is it's documented. We'll just leave it at that. And so I want to go ahead and bring up now
[1:10:57.680 --> 1:11:03.520]  Doug Williams and Doug Williams writes for Daily Newscaster. The headline is,
[1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:09.200]  is FEMA and DHS preparing for mass graves in Marshall Law near Chicago? And sir, thanks for
[1:11:09.200 --> 1:11:13.760]  joining us. Well, thank you for having me on today, Mr. Jones. I did that little bit of background
[1:11:13.760 --> 1:11:18.160]  for folks to understand. Everything that's in your article is already public. Just this particular
[1:11:18.160 --> 1:11:22.880]  case isn't because the individual won't go public. Yeah, that's correct. You know, the people in
[1:11:22.880 --> 1:11:28.720]  this position, they worry about retribution and possible responses to them coming out into the
[1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:35.600]  open. Give us your, I mean, you know the official year near the county. I mean, give us any your
[1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:39.360]  concerns why you wrote the story. Well, I'm concerned for a couple reasons. One, I've been
[1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:43.760]  following the Marshall Law story for quite a while. I've been doing the research on it. I've
[1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:52.800]  looked into NSPD 51 into the other documents they have setting up FEMA camps, setting up the legalities
[1:11:52.800 --> 1:12:00.560]  to make it possible for the federal government to co-op local county officials to execute national
[1:12:00.560 --> 1:12:07.680]  plans and programs. And one of those programs is, you know, setting up a police apparatus
[1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:21.840]  for controlling the population. Yes, sir, do we lose your phone? I'm back. There was a hiccup
[1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:27.440]  right there. I understand. These are, this is an important issue. These are real issues. These are
[1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:32.000]  things that are happening right now. And when someone's willing to come out and speak about
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:38.160]  their experiences with DHS and with FEMA employees, I think it's important for people to find out
[1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:43.760]  about that. So we wanted to put that out and share that with the public. Now, again, when I say every
[1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:47.440]  part of this article, I've separately confirmed for years, we've talked about how they order
[1:12:47.440 --> 1:12:54.960]  county and city officials to send police, firemen, medical workers to these FEMA meetings that that
[1:12:54.960 --> 1:12:59.520]  it's unfunded mandate. They order them to go to these classes where they scare the daylights out of
[1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:04.160]  them, but then are also very deceptive with them and tell them, oh, this is for earthquakes and
[1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:09.120]  hurricanes and then say, well, it's for terrorism. Then they start demonizing gun owners. They ask,
[1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:14.000]  who are the local troublemakers? And then the ears go up on the locals. In fact, I had a fireman
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  shoot video of FEMA in Kansas City saying the founding fathers are bad. You know, we're setting
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:24.560]  this up for the people's own good. So I mean, I've got a lot of this stuff. It's really creepy.
[1:13:24.560 --> 1:13:28.960]  The problem is I'm tired of these county officials being scared to go public. They need to go public
[1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:35.040]  now like Thomas Sanchez did with me in 1999, the Kingsville emergency manager, when they told him
[1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:38.720]  we're getting ready for gun confiscation. That's what these military drills are for. Well, you
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:43.840]  know, part of the process is, you know, people are scared. They're intimidated. They're brought
[1:13:43.840 --> 1:13:48.320]  into these, these conference rooms. They're brought into these situations with these federal
[1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:55.360]  authorities. And, you know, they're either through oath and sometimes through contract. They are
[1:13:55.360 --> 1:14:00.480]  not permitted to discuss certain things. They will actually classify some of these meetings.
[1:14:01.520 --> 1:14:05.120]  Now, yeah, these federalization meetings, tell folks about this particular clip. We're going to
[1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:08.880]  play after the break. And then you've heard the full clip, but this is edited for you. I've heard
[1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:14.800]  the unedited clip. This is a municipal official. I vetted out the, I'm not on the tape myself.
[1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:21.840]  I vetted out the individual in a Northwestern county here in Indiana, not too far from Chicago.
[1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:26.720]  And they were required by law to have six, to actually have more conversations and meetings,
[1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:32.400]  but they had to have a minimum of six meetings with federal authorities, particularly DHS and FEMA,
[1:14:32.400 --> 1:14:38.480]  to basically answer their questions. And at first it was about instituting a hazard mitigation
[1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:42.720]  program. And that was explained as something to prepare for tornadoes. Yeah, they always use
[1:14:42.720 --> 1:14:47.040]  something reasonable. Like the army's going to help stop drunks on the streets and then it's,
[1:14:47.040 --> 1:14:51.280]  and take guns. But go ahead. And that's exactly how they got them involved and got them started in
[1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:56.960]  it. And then the questions, the verbal questions, the written questionnaires, the information they
[1:14:56.960 --> 1:15:03.280]  wanted to know about infrastructure, telling them to plan for just unbelievable disaster scenarios
[1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:08.240]  that are just unrealistic for the area. You know, they were, it caused concern, you know, what were
[1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:13.280]  these meetings really about? Because they didn't actually seem to be about preparing for tornadoes.
[1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:20.080]  And then they said, oh, it's mass graves. Oh, it's martial law. Oh, it's for 400,000 people
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:24.240]  flooding your county. Oh, you need hardened bunkers. And they said, why? And they said, oh,
[1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:28.800]  in case jets fly into them, they said, no, jets were in the countryside in cornfields. Well,
[1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:33.200]  we all know it's really to fight the American people. Yeah, they looked, they had a map and they
[1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:38.560]  had it out on the table in one of the conferences and asked the people there from the county said,
[1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:43.280]  you know, if we need to locate mass graves, where, point us, point a good area out, where would we
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:49.360]  do that? And that was odd enough on its own. And then they asked them, would they accept bodies
[1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:55.600]  from other counties? Well, you know, this is the incredible thing. FEMA, we found the purchase
[1:15:55.600 --> 1:16:00.080]  orders where they bought millions in different locations around the country, these plastic
[1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:06.960]  coffins for mass death. And then when you try to ask FEMA about it, they deny that they're really
[1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:11.040]  coffins. And then we can call the company up that makes them and find the purchase order for them.
[1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:15.680]  So they're gearing up for something really big, ladies and gentlemen. We're going to talk about
[1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:20.480]  it more and play this clip and break it down and analyze it with a head emergency manager in a major
[1:16:20.480 --> 1:16:26.800]  county in Indiana on the border with Illinois and Chicago. It's all coming up after the break.

[1:20:49.920 --> 1:20:54.400]  All right, we're back live. Anything else you want to say before we play this clip,
[1:20:54.400 --> 1:21:02.160]  if you can come back and comment on it, Doug Williams with the Daily Newscaster. I'm sorry,
[1:21:02.160 --> 1:21:05.520]  Mr. Jones, what was that? Anything you'd like to say before we play this clip?
[1:21:05.520 --> 1:21:09.760]  You know, it's just people need to realize that these preparations are going on and when
[1:21:09.760 --> 1:21:16.400]  preparations like this happen, they're not for no reason. That needs to be kept in mind,
[1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:22.000]  you know, that they're doing this for a reason. Well, also, if the establishment really wanted to
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:26.640]  have true emergency preparedness, they would involve the community with the old-fashioned
[1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:33.840]  civil defense. But FEMA, and this is on record. We reported this the day it happened during Katrina.
[1:21:34.400 --> 1:21:38.480]  It was in local news and no one believed us, but it came out in congressional testimony
[1:21:38.480 --> 1:21:43.280]  and I interviewed the head of the parish that New Orleans, that's the name of the counties there,
[1:21:43.280 --> 1:21:51.200]  in the parish, Mr. Rashard, on record, the feds jammed the police cell phones and then said,
[1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:56.480]  oh, look at how the locals, 80% of the cops just walked off the job. They jammed their cell phones,
[1:21:56.480 --> 1:22:01.600]  went in, cut down the police radio lines and then the police found out three days in and had to fix
[1:22:01.600 --> 1:22:07.840]  it and guard it and FEMA showed up with guns in an armed standoff and wanted to cut the lines
[1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:12.560]  and we later came out. They wanted to have it be a disaster so they could use it as a quote
[1:22:12.560 --> 1:22:19.120]  laboratory to test gun confiscation. They then sent in the regular troops, Lair News Hour admits,
[1:22:19.120 --> 1:22:25.520]  and there's YouTube clips of this, that Israeli troops, Israeli contractors were used, Blackwater
[1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:32.240]  was used, high and dry, gun confiscation. I'm not pointing at this, FEMA is completely evil
[1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:37.920]  and keeping all of this secret and under PDD 51, Congress, they say, doesn't have any authority
[1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:42.960]  when Congress is co-equal with the president. The covert nature of all this questioning should
[1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:48.640]  really be the red flag. If this were legitimate, it would be public. They would involve the
[1:22:48.640 --> 1:22:54.960]  community. It would be out in the daylight. Absolutely. Let's go ahead and play this club.
[1:22:54.960 --> 1:23:02.240]  Here it is. There's some things going on here and again that I'm sure people are generally
[1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:13.200]  unaware of. And I have some contacts and I had made a contact with Superfaith to talk with him a
[1:23:13.200 --> 1:23:19.040]  little bit, but I'm not sure what happened. I think he had an ice storm down there and I don't
[1:23:19.040 --> 1:23:26.720]  know if he's out of it for a while or not. Yeah, he's disappeared. No one knows what, I think he's
[1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:32.080]  just focusing on the family right now, but you wrote a lot of things in your email. Why don't
[1:23:32.080 --> 1:23:36.480]  you just go through a lot of the time and break it down for us? What do you see? What's going on?
[1:23:36.480 --> 1:23:41.120]  About a year and a half to two years ago, we started being contacted by FEMA saying,
[1:23:41.120 --> 1:23:51.200]  you've got to put some plans together. The first plans had to do with, you know, the reason was
[1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:58.960]  avian flu. Now, you know, I don't know. My brother's a doctor and he had a couple hundred people around
[1:23:58.960 --> 1:24:07.520]  the world that died from bird flu and not really a serious threat right now unless they know something
[1:24:07.520 --> 1:24:14.960]  that we dealt with. The point is that we were to put together a plan to vaccinate every person in
[1:24:15.840 --> 1:24:22.880]  county within 48 hours. You're kidding me. Wow. And then that plan has to be practiced
[1:24:22.880 --> 1:24:29.200]  two or three times. I mean, literally, we've gotten every police officer we can and buses and
[1:24:29.200 --> 1:24:36.960]  and volunteers and set it up. And, you know, logistically, it's just really not possible
[1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:41.760]  to do. I mean, we've run through this thing a hundred times and in our heads and several times
[1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:47.680]  driving runs. It's just not logistically possible. But the point is they want to be able to vaccinate
[1:24:47.680 --> 1:24:54.880]  people very fast for some reason. It might be bird flu, but my brother's saying that, you know,
[1:24:54.880 --> 1:25:02.000]  bird flu is really an event right now unless they know something we don't know. Then the
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:08.080]  Sheriff's Department started getting long questionnaires. I got one myself. I didn't fill it out.
[1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:14.800]  And lots of questions. You know, what kind of resources do we have? What kind of,
[1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:22.160]  how many officers? What can we handle? What are you going to do if Chicago has an emergency and
[1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:30.960]  you have 400,000 people heading in your county? Where can you put mask braves? We need to know
[1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:37.680]  spaces and mask braves. How many can you handle? Can you handle bodies from surrounding counties
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:42.480]  and those types of things? And what the heck are you guys talking about? I don't tell us what's
[1:25:42.480 --> 1:25:48.880]  going on. Hold up and nothing's going on. We're just contingency plans. If something ever happens,
[1:25:48.880 --> 1:25:56.800]  you know, we just really need to know how to handle things. And then I was contacted by Homeland
[1:25:56.800 --> 1:26:05.280]  Security through our, what we have to do is have what is called a hazard mitigation plan.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:09.280]  Right, well that sounds good. And what they're saying is female is saying that
[1:26:10.480 --> 1:26:16.400]  disasters are costing them too much money. So we've got to have a plan to mitigate the
[1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:23.760]  the damage from disasters if a disaster ever happens. And I understand you've got New Orleans,
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:30.320]  you've got fires in California, and you've got the tornadoes in Oklahoma. You have those things
[1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:34.560]  going on, but we're looking at them going, you know, look, we're in the middle of a cornfield.
[1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:42.320]  What kind of disasters are we talking about? Oh, earthquakes and, you know, fires and flooding
[1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:50.800]  and tornadoes. Okay, well what interest, what are the real chances of those things happening?
[1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:55.520]  Because oh, it's very rare, but still we want to have mitigation plans. What kind of stuff you
[1:26:55.520 --> 1:27:02.080]  talked about? I just had my last meeting today with them, in fact. And, you know, they're literally
[1:27:02.080 --> 1:27:11.520]  telling me that they want to harden our fire stations. What do you mean by that? Well, you know
[1:27:11.520 --> 1:27:20.880]  how when a 747 hits, here's what he said today, when a 747 hits a nuclear reactor and just slides
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:29.120]  off of it, that kind of hardening we're talking about. What the heck? Oh my god. Well, first off,
[1:27:29.120 --> 1:27:34.240]  you know, I mean, for what reason, you know, if a 747 lands in the middle of town, it's not
[1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:39.600]  worried about the whole town, forget the fire department. Yeah, oh god. Well, you know, that's
[1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:43.840]  just an example. Well, it'll harden against water. What do you think's going to happen? Well,
[1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:50.240]  think just maybe high wind. Well, those are two different things you're talking about there.
[1:27:50.240 --> 1:27:58.080]  You know what? What is going on? And, you know, they're just, so we've had to put together and
[1:27:58.080 --> 1:28:02.080]  I actually went to the first two meetings. There's six mandatory meetings. That was the first two
[1:28:02.080 --> 1:28:06.720]  and I said, this is a waste of time. You know, if you don't, if you can't show, if you don't show,
[1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:10.800]  well, what's going to happen? Well, we don't know. But the law says you have to be involved in this.
[1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:17.280]  So we set up this meeting today and had this final meeting. But when we first got there,
[1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:25.120]  they made this map out. It's like 10 feet by 5 feet of the whole county. And it said, we want to know
[1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:33.680]  every important thing in this county. We want to know where police departments are, where weapons
[1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:39.200]  are stored, hazardous material. Where can we land in helicopter? Where are the airports? How
[1:28:39.200 --> 1:28:44.480]  big of a plane can you land in those airports? Where are all the bridges? Where are all the power
[1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:49.840]  stations? Where are all the generating stations? Where are all the substations? I mean, they literally
[1:28:49.840 --> 1:28:54.960]  want to know everything else because of this or, you know, I'm thinking, man, what's going to happen
[1:28:54.960 --> 1:28:59.360]  is there's a martial law. Yeah, that's the kicker. He says it looks like martial law. We're going to
[1:28:59.360 --> 1:29:03.920]  come back, play this, finish up with our guest who's been writing about the story. Stay with us.

[1:30:37.840 --> 1:30:42.880]  the recent bailout. International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis
[1:30:42.880 --> 1:30:48.000]  to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as savior. But we've only seen the beginning.
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:52.160]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[1:30:52.160 --> 1:30:56.720]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land. The insiders have
[1:30:56.720 --> 1:31:02.560]  discovered that they must control two things to seize total power. Phase one is a one-world currency
[1:31:02.560 --> 1:31:07.280]  which we are currently being prepared to accept. Phase two of their insidious plan is complete

[1:33:44.880 --> 1:33:50.880]  Okay, let's finish the very end of that clip with this confirmed. Our guest again has a full
[1:33:50.880 --> 1:33:54.560]  tape, the name, which county, but we're not putting it out because the county official
[1:33:54.560 --> 1:33:58.320]  doesn't want it out. Dealing with FEMA, is FEMA the agency that's preparing for mass graves and
[1:33:58.320 --> 1:34:02.480]  martial law in their Chicago? Yes, they are, and nationwide. Finish up the clip.
[1:34:03.360 --> 1:34:08.960]  When we first got there, they made this map out. It's like 10 feet by 5 feet of the whole county.
[1:34:09.920 --> 1:34:17.840]  And it said, we want to know every important thing in this county. We want to know where
[1:34:17.840 --> 1:34:24.880]  police departments are, where weapons are stored, hazardous material, where can we land a helicopter,
[1:34:24.880 --> 1:34:28.640]  where are the airports, how big of a plane can you land in those airports,
[1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:33.520]  where are all the bridges, where are all the power stations, where are all the generating
[1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:38.160]  stations, where are all the substations. I mean, they literally want to know everything.
[1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:45.200]  I said, you know, I'm thinking, man, if there was ever a martial law, this kind of information
[1:34:45.200 --> 1:34:50.080]  is exactly the kind of stuff they're going to want because we're just laying it all out for them right there.
[1:34:51.280 --> 1:34:54.880]  All right, so there you have it. I've got some points I want to make, but
[1:34:55.680 --> 1:35:01.040]  we're talking to the reporter that helped break the story, D.H. Williams, with the Daily Newscaster.
[1:35:01.040 --> 1:35:05.200]  Go ahead. Yeah, you know, can I share a quick anecdotal story of why this...
[1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:10.640]  Yeah, your phone cut out again. I think you got somebody calling you on call waiting.
[1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:16.000]  Actually, this line doesn't have call waiting. Can I share a quick anecdotal story why this is
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:24.160]  so important? Sure. Back in 1986, I was serving at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. I was attached to a
[1:35:24.160 --> 1:35:30.160]  unit, about 20 men. To be in the unit, you had to have at least a secret clearance or above,
[1:35:30.160 --> 1:35:34.640]  and the reason for that is we would have secret meetings where we would go into an
[1:35:34.640 --> 1:35:40.960]  uncond... in the middle of summer, go into an un-air conditioned building, close the windows, close the shades.
[1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:46.480]  We would pull out a big map, lay it out on the table, and we would talk about potential missions
[1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:53.600]  that may happen. For example, in the summer of 86, we had a map of Panama. What we would talk about
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:35:59.360]  is the location of the airports, the location of power generation, the communications location,
[1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:05.200]  where's the Panamanian Defense Force cadre located, where's their officer school located.
[1:36:05.200 --> 1:36:11.200]  We wanted to know about their infrastructure. Well, three years later, just before Christmas,
[1:36:11.200 --> 1:36:16.400]  that information was put into use when Panama was invaded. And they never told you that was a plan.
[1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:21.280]  They said it was just an exercise. All we knew is it was four Panama, because we had a map,
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:26.800]  we had locations, we had names, but they do not get into specifics. Let me stop you. I was interviewing
[1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:33.280]  Representative Shea out of Oregon this week, and he's all aware of the martial law. He was also in
[1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:38.960]  the Army. He's aware of the plan and the FEMA camps, and anybody who's had this training can see what
[1:36:38.960 --> 1:36:43.600]  it is, but we don't even have to sit there and read between the lines. FEMA admits they're
[1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:48.880]  preparing to take over the states that the governors have no power for total martial law.
[1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:53.200]  And that was my point. In fact, I have a bunch of them here. I want to go through them with you
[1:36:53.200 --> 1:36:58.240]  quickly. Force shots. They admit they have a plan for force shots for the entire population.
[1:36:58.240 --> 1:37:02.240]  They tried five years ago to make all first responders take the smallpox shots to get them
[1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:06.640]  ready to nationally force it. They refuse so that program fell apart. They've trained police
[1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:11.520]  nationwide to use buses for force roundups for those on the red list. That's part of the training.
[1:37:13.040 --> 1:37:16.320]  They're telling, and I've talked to city officials, higher up, they tell them,
[1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:20.320]  yes, we're preparing for war with the American people during rebellion when they find out foreign
[1:37:20.320 --> 1:37:24.480]  banks have taken over. That's why they're building these bunkers all over the nation. That's what
[1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:30.640]  they said. We want you to harden these city locations. Now, back during urban warfare drills
[1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:35.920]  in Texas and all over the country that we went to, they would practice taking over the city halls,
[1:37:36.800 --> 1:37:44.160]  the police stations, the governor's mansion, the state capitals, and they even admitted it was
[1:37:44.160 --> 1:37:48.960]  for the United States. So I videotaped that. I know they've been quietly preparing forever. So
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:56.640]  there's that. Please comment on that. Well, that's exactly right. All any unit needs is the information
[1:37:56.640 --> 1:38:02.800]  that's being collected from these county officials. You know, 1967, Detroit, there was a riot.
[1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:09.280]  People think it's odd or unusual for the military to be brought in, but 1967, I think it said,
[1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:16.800]  Aben, 67, the 82nd Airborne went into Detroit to quell a riot. The military does do these things.
[1:38:16.800 --> 1:38:21.440]  It can happen here. And all they need is the information that's being gathered.
[1:38:21.440 --> 1:38:24.960]  But this is being done in conjunction for gun confiscation.
[1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:29.120]  That's the point. Let me continue with these.
[1:38:31.360 --> 1:38:34.800]  They also are telling all these local counties that everybody has to have FEMA training
[1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:38.320]  to deal with IEDs or improvised explosive devices on roadside.
[1:38:38.320 --> 1:38:42.720]  Well, I can tell you a little something about that as well. That is apparently a big concern.
[1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:48.480]  I have friends that are in law enforcement. Over a year ago, a large group was taken down to New
[1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:57.120]  Orleans for a two-week training course, and it was specifically to identify and learn procedures
[1:38:57.120 --> 1:39:03.600]  about dealing with IEDs. Now, the interesting thing about that training is these police officers
[1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:09.120]  were told that the people they need to be concerned about aren't people hiding in caves with beards,
[1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:12.320]  but they need to be concerned about soldiers returning from the Middle East.
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:16.720]  Yeah, let me expand on that. That's another lie. I have to know this is really four.
[1:39:16.720 --> 1:39:21.920]  They use the ordinance disposal units to first get rid of Posse commentatus
[1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:27.040]  in the major states. Here in Texas, we caught army, regular army checkpoints,
[1:39:27.040 --> 1:39:30.640]  searching cars all over I-35. It's in my film, Road to Terrority.
[1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:35.520]  Now, again, just like they've now announced in the army times, oh, the army is going to help
[1:39:35.520 --> 1:39:39.680]  it car wrecks. That's to get the public used to having the army on their streets with something
[1:39:39.680 --> 1:39:45.840]  that sounds reasonable. To federalize local police, they started out in the late 80s claiming it was
[1:39:45.840 --> 1:39:52.720]  for secret IED or bomb removal, but then we got secret documents that are now public. We got it
[1:39:52.720 --> 1:39:56.160]  when the FBI screwed up at a checkpoint and said, here's a press release idiot, get out of here,
[1:39:56.160 --> 1:40:00.480]  and it under it stapled was the secret not for distribution. It's up on my website. It's in
[1:40:00.480 --> 1:40:05.760]  police state to the takeover and Road to Terrority. And it said, we're here for warrant service,
[1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:13.120]  gun confiscation, whatever you need operating in 1998 already in 77 Texas counties. Now,
[1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:18.080]  let me expand. So, see, that's just how they get the local police ready to work with the military
[1:40:18.080 --> 1:40:23.840]  and teach them that it's not just Al Qaeda. It's black people. It's white people. It's Americans.
[1:40:23.840 --> 1:40:28.240]  Do you see the PSYOP? Absolutely. And that's what they're doing. They're saying it's Americans
[1:40:28.240 --> 1:40:34.000]  coming back. It's soldiers. It's veterans. They're creating the us versus them scenario.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:38.960]  You know, the us being anybody that's a police officer and them being the rest of us.
[1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:44.080]  Now, they're also more importantly in all this urban warfare training and now FEMA takeover
[1:40:44.080 --> 1:40:49.040]  communication. They're identifying what county and city officials are dumb and will work with them,
[1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:52.880]  what county and city officials are criminals that want to know what's going on and want to join
[1:40:52.880 --> 1:40:57.360]  the team, and they're finding out who's going to resist them. Yeah, absolutely. It's basic
[1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:01.760]  recruiting ops. I mean, any intelligence organization, that's, you know, one of the
[1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:05.920]  basic ways to recruit people. Did you ever hear about how I interviewed the San Antonio police
[1:41:05.920 --> 1:41:09.360]  chief, how he wouldn't let them do that in San Antonio, so they brought in bags of cash?
[1:41:10.160 --> 1:41:15.600]  No. Yeah, that's in road to tyranny. You got to see it. I'm not surprised. I mean, you know,
[1:41:16.320 --> 1:41:22.160]  people are compromised constantly. Money will do that. Well, this is the same way for, as you know,
[1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:28.720]  it's now in a history channel piece narrated by Charlton Heston that came out about 10 years ago.
[1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:32.880]  For two years, they were covertly buying off local officials and doing the same thing and doing
[1:41:32.880 --> 1:41:40.240]  drills in Panama, the supposed ally covertly just to desensitize the, the Panamanian defense
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:43.760]  forces. So when the real invasion happened, they would stand down. Oh, absolutely. I mean,
[1:41:43.760 --> 1:41:48.400]  there's, there's so much that goes on. Here's something to consider when you're in the military
[1:41:48.400 --> 1:41:53.280]  and you're flying from, let's say Fort Bragg from Pope Air Force base to attach to Fort Bragg,
[1:41:53.280 --> 1:41:58.480]  you go down to Panama. This is in Noriega's days. You go down to Panama, you get off the
[1:41:58.480 --> 1:42:02.640]  plane, you spend your time in Panama. And then when you return home, you get back on the plane.
[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:07.680]  There's no customs. There's no one there to stop you or check you get on the plane. You fly back
[1:42:07.680 --> 1:42:12.000]  to Fort Bragg. You get off the plane. And the next thing you know, you're in Fayetteville,
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:16.240]  North Carolina. That's why they use the dead bodies in Vietnam packed full of cocaine on record.
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:20.240]  That's correct. All right. Continuing with my points, I want you to comment on,
[1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:25.360]  they're saying it's mandatory meetings that trains them to be under federal control and federal
[1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:31.600]  orders. Yeah, it's an act of submission. They're saying you're going to submit right up front.
[1:42:31.600 --> 1:42:35.520]  This is what we're going to do. And if you balk about it, you know, things are not going to be
[1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:39.920]  good for you. Let me ask you this question. I talked to former special forces, colonels,
[1:42:39.920 --> 1:42:45.520]  generals, the former head of, you know, and of all of special forces on air has said they're
[1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:50.160]  preparing for martial law. I can have police chiefs. I can have them all on. The public still
[1:42:50.160 --> 1:42:54.160]  sucks their thumb. You were obviously in special forces. You're saying it Bragg. I didn't know
[1:42:54.160 --> 1:42:58.720]  that. What are they going to do about the tens of millions of vets who know what this is and
[1:42:58.720 --> 1:43:02.400]  recognize what it is and who aren't going to go along with it? You know, I don't have the exact
[1:43:02.400 --> 1:43:07.120]  number, but exactly what's going to happen. But here's what I think. Unfortunately, there's going
[1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:13.680]  to be a small contingent of soldiers that are going to do what they're told. There could be
[1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:19.120]  some frightening consequences to that. Now, having said that, there's going to be a large number,
[1:43:19.120 --> 1:43:25.120]  particularly older veterans, particularly people in the service or, you know, 20, 25 years. Stay
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:28.720]  there. Stay there. Do the final segment with us and we'll try to jam in a few final calls. This
[1:43:28.720 --> 1:43:33.280]  is too important. They have prepared for martial law, offshore banks have seized the United States.
[1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:39.280]  Stay with us. You don't have to be in the military to enjoy military surplus savings. Right now,

[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:50.240]  Visit GCNLive.com today. I'll tell you the good news. I've been having state reps one or two
[1:47:50.240 --> 1:47:55.440]  on every day of the last few weeks on the weekday show. And most upper military veterans,
[1:47:55.440 --> 1:47:59.840]  they're totally aware. They know all the PDDs. They know about the FEMA camps. But again,
[1:47:59.840 --> 1:48:03.920]  all this is now in mainstream news as well. It's just that those of us warning got laughed at,
[1:48:03.920 --> 1:48:07.440]  now we're not being laughed at. Now understand, this is not the U.S. government.
[1:48:07.440 --> 1:48:11.920]  Foreign offshore banks have taken full control. We're in receivership now. It's in the IMF and
[1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:17.120]  World Bank documents. I wrote about in my book, The Sentent to Terrany in 2002. We predicted 2008,
[1:48:17.120 --> 1:48:23.120]  2009. So much of this is such a big planning operation. It's not hidden. The intelligence
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:27.840]  was all around us. And then by going and covering these events, a lot of it fell into our hands.
[1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:32.560]  And by talking to police chiefs and emergency managers, some who had allowed them in, they
[1:48:32.560 --> 1:48:37.680]  told us foreign troops were involved, like Jack D. Compton, the Alice Texas police chief who's
[1:48:37.680 --> 1:48:44.000]  former DEA himself. It goes on and on. Now they're going to stage the riots. They're going to have
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:48.800]  the local stand down. The FEMA is going to jam police communications. This is one of their plans
[1:48:48.800 --> 1:48:53.840]  to let the riots get bad. The military will come in, fix everything. That'll set the president.
[1:48:53.840 --> 1:49:00.080]  Well, hey, this is a good thing. So see, there's lots of Psyops built into this. And I want to go
[1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:06.960]  back to Doug Williams, who's writing for The Daily Newscaster in his story, FEMA DHS preparing for
[1:49:06.960 --> 1:49:12.880]  mass graves in Marshall Law near Chicago. Anything you want to add to the points I was just making
[1:49:12.880 --> 1:49:18.400]  and then finish up with the question I gave you about if this does go, people resisting?
[1:49:18.400 --> 1:49:22.480]  Well, you know, I think a lot of people in the military will resist. You know, it all depends
[1:49:22.480 --> 1:49:28.080]  on how it plays out. Now here's my hope. My hope is that we can cut this off by exposing the
[1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:34.960]  information, by forcing these people, FEMA, the DHS, force these people out into the open,
[1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:39.600]  make them answer questions, find out why, what they're doing, why they're doing it,
[1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:43.520]  and why they're not doing it in public. And then maybe we can change things because,
[1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:47.200]  you know, a lot of people that want to question your information or my information,
[1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:50.960]  they say, well, you're not telling us when it's going to happen. Well, let me tell you from being
[1:49:50.960 --> 1:49:56.320]  in that position, no one knows when it's going to happen at this point. It's not about knowing
[1:49:56.320 --> 1:50:00.880]  when. It's about being prepared. A phone call is made that says launch the operation. There's
[1:50:00.880 --> 1:50:05.440]  probably only 10 guys in the National Security Council aware of it. And then they go with the
[1:50:05.440 --> 1:50:10.400]  go date, then it happens. That's correct. There's a chain of command and everybody below that
[1:50:10.400 --> 1:50:14.880]  chain of command, they don't know. They're given generalities enough to do their mission.
[1:50:14.880 --> 1:50:18.080]  But do you agree? I've seen them do this in third world countries that they're first going to have
[1:50:18.080 --> 1:50:22.880]  a rollout to set the precedent where the troops come out, they fix everything, now the president
[1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:27.680]  said. Well, that's part of what happened in New Orleans when the 82nd went there. It really hurt
[1:50:27.680 --> 1:50:32.720]  me to see that happen. I was really disappointed. The gun confiscation? Yeah, I was disappointed
[1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:37.040]  to see those guys on the street. And that was their first blood. That was training them to
[1:50:37.040 --> 1:50:42.640]  confiscate the guns. Now, finally here, I want to encourage you to come back on the weekday
[1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:46.560]  shows. We can spend more time and let you have a chance to flesh this out. Because I really respect
[1:50:46.560 --> 1:50:51.600]  your knowledgeable opinion on this, Mr. Williams. But I also want to challenge FEMA workers,
[1:50:52.160 --> 1:50:56.640]  county, city people around the country listening right now on AMFM, shortwave internet satellite
[1:50:56.640 --> 1:51:04.640]  to email my producer joeyv at infowars.com to CC it to Aaron with two A's at infowars.com.
[1:51:04.640 --> 1:51:09.120]  And we're good at keeping your anonymity. That's what you want. But this is the time the country
[1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:14.320]  needs. I just go public. You're allowed as an American to expose this. So more of you
[1:51:14.320 --> 1:51:19.760]  can come out because you're right, Mr. Williams. If we expose this, then they lose the element of
[1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:24.080]  surprise and they won't be able to get away with it. Well, they just won't be able to have the same
[1:51:24.080 --> 1:51:28.560]  results. It just, you know, they won't be able to control opinion. They won't be able to, it's a
[1:51:28.560 --> 1:51:33.920]  production. It's a performance. And if you, if you ruin the performance, if you tell the magician's
[1:51:33.920 --> 1:51:38.560]  trick before he does it, it simply doesn't have the same effect on the audience. We're in a life
[1:51:38.560 --> 1:51:43.440]  and death info war. And you know, Mr. Williams, 90% of war is info war. Absolutely. And you know,
[1:51:43.440 --> 1:51:49.200]  people should not discount open source intelligence. 90% of all Intel is open source. It's just
[1:51:49.200 --> 1:51:53.920]  about digging and getting the information. It doesn't have to be super secret or something
[1:51:53.920 --> 1:51:59.040]  only a few people know. Usually those secrets are usually there's nothing there or nothing to
[1:51:59.040 --> 1:52:03.680]  those at all. Well, yeah, because they'll have 20 battle plans. What you can't miss is the overall
[1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:08.640]  architecture and the system. I mean, when I went and videotaped Marines in Haber and Maryland or
[1:52:08.640 --> 1:52:12.880]  Oakland, California training to confiscate guns with roleplayers screaming, I'm an American,
[1:52:12.880 --> 1:52:18.320]  please don't take my guns. You know, I mean, right there, we know what this is. One other
[1:52:18.320 --> 1:52:23.680]  key point. Who's watched C-span the last year? Every time FEMA is up speaking, it's generals in
[1:52:23.680 --> 1:52:32.000]  uniform in the FEMA positions now. You know, that's what really concerns me is the senior
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:38.960]  officers that seem to have a different program. They seem to be involved in something that I
[1:52:38.960 --> 1:52:44.960]  don't recognize for my years of service. Well, I told everybody they were going to build up the
[1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:49.600]  anti-terror apparatus in the name of fighting al-Qaeda that they would then announce white al-Qaeda,
[1:52:49.600 --> 1:52:55.280]  which CNN and Fox have done and claim that all Americans could be al-Qaeda. And it's now happened.
[1:52:55.280 --> 1:53:00.880]  They're swinging the whole apparatus around against the people and training police that the American
[1:53:00.880 --> 1:53:05.600]  people are the enemy, and the Army admits they're preparing to, quote, engage the American people
[1:53:05.600 --> 1:53:10.720]  during insurrection. And PDD 51 says, and the John Warren Defense Authorization Act, really the big
[1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:16.480]  one, says that the governors are just puppets and serve as dual-headed officers of the federal
[1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:22.320]  government. And that Congress doesn't, Congress wants to see the full text of PDD 51 for now a year,
[1:53:22.320 --> 1:53:28.400]  Mr. Williams, and they won't show it to Congress. Well, the times are urgent. 20 years ago, 25 years
[1:53:28.400 --> 1:53:33.680]  ago, these types of things were just not even something that could be considered. The idea of
[1:53:33.680 --> 1:53:39.120]  Northcom existing would have been abhorrent. You know, that's not something we talked about. We
[1:53:39.120 --> 1:53:45.840]  used to sit around and, in a formal way, discuss the Geneva Conventions and discuss Posse Commentatus.
[1:53:45.840 --> 1:53:50.560]  We weren't even allowed to wear our battle dress uniforms off the, off the Fort.
[1:53:50.560 --> 1:53:56.000]  Well, that's it. And now Northcom is an operational command over the United States as a war zone,
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:54:01.360]  and the entire infrastructure of face scanning cameras, FEMA bunkers, is all under Colorado
[1:54:01.360 --> 1:54:06.960]  Springs, Colorado, and Northcom. And now it's not just Alex Jones warning you or General Stubblebine
[1:54:06.960 --> 1:54:12.400]  when I've had him on, former head of Special Forces. Now they admit the battle program. They admit
[1:54:12.400 --> 1:54:17.280]  the profile because that means they're about to go with it or considering it. When they finally
[1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:24.640]  start the PSIOP to unveil it with PR and package it with Siki Sweetness, that means they are,
[1:54:24.640 --> 1:54:28.320]  they have the safety off, the gun is to the Republic's head, and they're beginning to pull
[1:54:28.320 --> 1:54:34.000]  the trigger. Well, what we need to be concerned about is how, what kind of circumstances do
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:40.880]  they set? What stage do they set to roll it out? You know, because they're going to create an
[1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:45.360]  emergency, I believe. I don't know what, but I think they'll use the guys that were here to help you.
[1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:50.160]  Well, here's exactly, but here's the problem. People are going to see through the PSIOP of
[1:54:50.160 --> 1:54:54.640]  we're here to help you. And I believe it's going to turn into a shooting war, and I don't want that.
[1:54:54.640 --> 1:54:58.560]  And I believe in the end, the globalists are going to lose on this. That's the absolute
[1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:06.720]  last thing we want. I would, believe me, that is, you do not, we do not want to go up against these
[1:55:06.720 --> 1:55:11.680]  guys with the training that they have. That would not be a good scenario. And I don't want to see
[1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:17.600]  that happen. Well, let me just say this, this is not Panama City. And if they try gun confiscation
[1:55:17.600 --> 1:55:22.480]  nationwide with the PSIOP, I wouldn't want to be the guys coming to get the guns though.
[1:55:22.480 --> 1:55:27.600]  No, no, I just, I just don't want to see any bloodshed. You know, I really think the information
[1:55:27.600 --> 1:55:33.040]  wars, where it's at, I really think exposing people. I think, you know, your program, what you do,
[1:55:33.040 --> 1:55:37.440]  is just so important. We've got to get this information out. It's open source or what I
[1:55:37.440 --> 1:55:42.080]  call open secrets. And it just needs to be made public. So these people realize that they don't
[1:55:42.080 --> 1:55:46.400]  have the right, they don't have the authority to do what they're doing. FEMA doesn't have the
[1:55:46.400 --> 1:55:50.880]  authority. They're using, if you go into the history of all this, we're running out of time, but
[1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:56.640]  you know, they've used memorandums of understanding. They've used color of law. They've used
[1:55:56.640 --> 1:56:04.240]  programs to erode our legal system and turn it into a, the rule of man instead of the rule.
[1:56:04.240 --> 1:56:08.160]  Well, that's what I was going to say is that to claim that Congress has no involvement in
[1:56:08.160 --> 1:56:12.800]  emergencies now, I mean, in the founding documents, Congress is above the executive,
[1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:16.560]  then they made the executive co-equal. Now they're claiming Congress isn't involved.
[1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:21.840]  Google it folks. Congress not even allowed to see martial law plans, mainstream news.
[1:56:21.840 --> 1:56:27.280]  I mean, here's a headline out of McClatchy newspapers dealing with the bailout, dirty secret
[1:56:27.280 --> 1:56:33.360]  of the bailout, 32 words that none dare utter. And it says here, decisions by the secretary of
[1:56:33.360 --> 1:56:37.920]  pursuant to the authority of the sector, non-renewable, reviewable, and committed agency
[1:56:37.920 --> 1:56:42.720]  discretion and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency. Folks,
[1:56:42.720 --> 1:56:50.480]  we're being robbed by the IMF, by the World Bank, and all of us are together in this against the
[1:56:50.480 --> 1:56:56.080]  globalist. We must say no, but we also need to let them know, Mr. Williams, that we're not going
[1:56:56.080 --> 1:57:00.160]  to FEMA camps. We're not taking force inoculations and we're not turning our guns in.
[1:57:00.160 --> 1:57:04.960]  Well, that's absolutely the case. You know, anybody that would even allow that to happen to
[1:57:04.960 --> 1:57:09.440]  themselves or their family, it would be a huge mistake. You don't want to cooperate with that.
[1:57:09.440 --> 1:57:15.680]  It's not your responsibility. I support my best friends, the most greatest people I've ever met,
[1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:19.920]  still friends with today, where people I've met in the military, some people still serving in the
[1:57:19.920 --> 1:57:23.920]  military. I have nothing but... When you talk to them, are they aware of what's going on?
[1:57:23.920 --> 1:57:28.720]  Yes, they are. That's the word I get from thousands of sources is the majority of the
[1:57:28.720 --> 1:57:33.600]  military sees them hiring gangbangers, illegal aliens, felons. They know they're creating a
[1:57:33.600 --> 1:57:37.840]  criminal cadre. They're getting rid of all the spree decor. They're getting rid of all the great
[1:57:37.840 --> 1:57:44.880]  history, everything, and that the real troops are very upset. They are. There's real concerns in
[1:57:44.880 --> 1:57:51.200]  the community without a doubt. Again, I really think we can stop this and we can do it the way
[1:57:51.200 --> 1:57:55.760]  you're doing it, the way these state legislators are doing it. Saying they're not going to go along
[1:57:55.760 --> 1:58:00.480]  with martial law, 21 states saying they're saying no to the globalist. I want to get you back on
[1:58:00.480 --> 1:58:05.600]  the show later this week, Mr. Williams, okay? Sure, I'd be glad to. We'll be contacting you
[1:58:05.600 --> 1:58:10.000]  tomorrow. I'm sorry I didn't get to your other calls. This was too important, folks. I'm risking
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:16.080]  my life, my family. This stuff is real. I told you 12, 14 years before all this came out.
[1:58:16.080 --> 1:58:20.160]  What was going to happen? I'm risking my life. This is real. They're going to steal everything
[1:58:20.160 --> 1:58:24.000]  you've got unless you say no. God bless you all. Get out there and take on tyranny.

[1:59:04.640 --> 1:59:08.240]  correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the
