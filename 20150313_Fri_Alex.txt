[00:39.000 --> 00:42.360]  guests joining us I'll tell you about that in the next segment obviously a few
[00:42.360 --> 00:47.560]  days ago we saw two police officers shot in Ferguson and the subsequent
[00:47.560 --> 00:53.020]  celebrations in in Ferguson in New York and other major cities we've also heard
[00:53.020 --> 00:58.520]  claims this even in mainstream news on Fox News that it was a false flag with
[00:58.520 --> 01:05.240]  no evidence is the issue but the people celebrating is that a false flag too no
[01:05.240 --> 01:10.640]  we don't really see any evidence of this being a staged event what we see is the
[01:10.640 --> 01:15.840]  larger false flag of George Soros and others stirring up what they hope to be a
[01:15.840 --> 01:20.820]  civil war in this country that I've been warning of for years and you now see it
[01:20.820 --> 01:25.280]  beginning to unfold because I know the globalist playbook you'd have to be
[01:25.280 --> 01:32.000]  blind you'd have to have a lobotomy not to be able to see this and the public
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.560]  is starting to figure it out we're gonna break that down Benjamin yet and

[01:54.240 --> 01:59.040]  Senate committee advanced the cyber security bill in secret session yet
[01:59.040 --> 02:06.400]  again yet again that is just some of the news that is coming up here today
[02:06.400 --> 02:11.280]  Obama of course is weighing in trying to stir up the whole Ferguson situation
[02:11.280 --> 02:15.560]  because it's all he's got is diverting the population we have the first lab
[02:15.560 --> 02:20.240]  grown burger now a test tube chicken is next hey big deal they use baby parts
[02:20.240 --> 02:24.520]  for pepsi-pepsi flavor testing I mean you're an extremist or a racist if you're
[02:24.520 --> 02:30.360]  not for growing baby parts inside cows all this and more as we fight for human
[02:30.360 --> 02:35.640]  integrity as we fight to awaken the general population of the planet to the
[02:35.640 --> 02:40.320]  humanization that's taking place the rise of humanity against the
[02:40.320 --> 02:44.040]  technocratic tyranny it's all coming up today government approval rating is at
[02:44.040 --> 02:49.040]  an all-time low this shows the giant is awakening and here's John bounds report
[02:49.040 --> 02:53.040]  we'll be back after the break a major survey has revealed that American
[02:53.040 --> 02:57.640]  confidence in all three branches of government has reached record lows the
[02:57.640 --> 03:02.720]  2014 general social survey has mined the political climate for 40 years their
[03:02.720 --> 03:07.520]  studies now show that only 23% of Americans have a great deal of
[03:07.520 --> 03:12.480]  confidence in the Supreme Court a meager 11% in the executive branch and a
[03:12.480 --> 03:17.800]  pitifully dismal 5% in Congress American confidence in the Supreme Court is
[03:17.800 --> 03:22.800]  reaching a record 40 year low 2 and 10 have zero confidence in the Supreme
[03:22.800 --> 03:27.640]  Court just 3% of Republicans have confidence in the president while
[03:27.640 --> 03:35.520]  Democrats have dropped from 25% in 2010 to 18% in 2014 and Congress well
[03:35.520 --> 03:40.640]  Congress is a sick joke to most Americans a very very sad day when we
[03:40.640 --> 03:46.520]  have to make a Hobson's choice of either funding our national security or
[03:46.520 --> 03:52.800]  standing for the Constitution confidence was almost non-existent with 7% of
[03:52.800 --> 03:58.600]  Democrats 5% of independence and 3% of Republicans with a great deal of
[03:58.600 --> 04:04.840]  confidence first of all any conversation I have with these senators or
[04:04.840 --> 04:09.400]  senator Mendez or anyone else I do my best to make them private if that's how
[04:09.400 --> 04:12.800]  they're initiated that's how they should stay senator Mendez has done a
[04:12.800 --> 04:16.520]  stalwart job as chair of the committee and as far as I'm concerned he's been an
[04:16.520 --> 04:21.880]  outstanding senator 45 years ago 25% of Americans expressed a great deal of
[04:21.880 --> 04:27.840]  confidence in the press now 7% of Americans have confidence while 44%
[04:27.840 --> 04:33.280]  have no confidence at all and one American in 10 has confidence in
[04:33.280 --> 04:38.080]  television a recent Gallup poll named government as the number one problem in

[12:35.840 --> 12:38.640]  and that's why the system is scared to death and what do you do when the
[12:38.640 --> 12:42.320]  people start waking up and coming together
[12:42.320 --> 12:45.360]  you fund radical islamist system let them take over the middle east and then
[12:45.360 --> 12:48.240]  our troops have got to go fight them and then you have the left sit around and
[12:48.240 --> 12:52.480]  curse our military as a bunch of murdering uh criminals when all they
[12:52.480 --> 12:56.240]  are is being shoved in under orders into a false narrative set up by the
[12:56.240 --> 12:59.760]  globalist what do you do well you federalize the
[12:59.760 --> 13:05.040]  police you militarize them you train them you set up a phony drug war
[13:05.040 --> 13:08.720]  then cops start getting killed at epidemic levels
[13:08.720 --> 13:14.000]  in the last 20 years actual shootings and killings are down the last 20 cops
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.120]  being killed is up the last 20 the police that get into a fear
[13:17.120 --> 13:19.920]  mongering base start seeing the public as their
[13:19.920 --> 13:25.040]  enemy george soros pumps in 35 million or whatever it was 34 million
[13:25.040 --> 13:28.400]  seen different numbers to get riots going
[13:28.400 --> 13:33.040]  to fund all the white college kids showing up in black neighborhoods
[13:33.040 --> 13:37.920]  chanting kill the cops then cops start getting shot in the head all over the
[13:37.920 --> 13:45.280]  country from florida to new york to ferguson and the answer is
[13:46.560 --> 13:50.240]  we need more of this according to the establishment because it gets everyone
[13:50.240 --> 13:53.200]  at each other's throats and then it will legitimize
[13:53.200 --> 13:57.680]  the federalization of police which obama signed an order on last week totally
[13:57.680 --> 14:01.120]  unconstitutional to accelerate the federalization of the police
[14:01.120 --> 14:05.200]  all part of the imploding the borders coming after the guns extra
[14:05.200 --> 14:10.080]  traditionally extra legislatively coming after our sovereignty they are
[14:10.080 --> 14:14.720]  moving on every front grabbing the internet you name it
[14:14.720 --> 14:20.400]  oh and before the cop killing chant started going
[14:20.400 --> 14:23.760]  who was telling you five years ago that this was going to start
[14:23.760 --> 14:27.200]  and they were going to try to start a civil war in this country it's because
[14:27.200 --> 14:30.800]  i have learned how the enemy has operated in other countries they've done
[14:30.800 --> 14:33.760]  this in other countries as well this is a
[14:33.760 --> 14:38.880]  destabilization program to degrade the sustainability
[14:38.880 --> 14:42.400]  and the sovereignty and the security and the prosperity
[14:42.400 --> 14:46.640]  and the tranquility and the peace of this country
[14:46.640 --> 14:50.800]  and you're seeing it you're seeing the socialist
[14:50.800 --> 14:58.800]  chicago social engineer the community organizer the acorn organizer
[14:59.120 --> 15:03.120]  play class warfare ladies and gentlemen instead of everybody of every race
[15:03.120 --> 15:06.560]  color creed and religion coming together around private property and due
[15:06.560 --> 15:10.240]  process and freedom i've got a stack of news
[15:10.240 --> 15:15.040]  articles here where cops choke a teen and brain damage them
[15:15.040 --> 15:20.320]  and the cop gets charged i've got a stack of news articles here where bad cops
[15:20.320 --> 15:22.320]  are out of control cops are getting in trouble
[15:22.320 --> 15:26.880]  but see those stories never get focused on because the bad cops need to get in
[15:26.880 --> 15:30.240]  trouble no they always focus on some nebulous
[15:30.240 --> 15:34.400]  case like the brown case or or or trevon martin
[15:34.400 --> 15:38.080]  and then have the justice department caught in both cases behind the scenes
[15:38.080 --> 15:46.080]  stirring the pot stirring the pot
[15:46.080 --> 15:49.840]  and when you get a black cop shooting somebody in their car because they have a
[15:49.840 --> 15:53.200]  gun and the cop jumps the gun scared and shoots them
[15:53.200 --> 15:57.040]  do you hear a bunch of race riot garbage no the justice department doesn't pick up
[15:57.040 --> 16:01.680]  on that to just attack police in general they pick up on white on black to make
[16:01.680 --> 16:05.120]  it racial which then can be projected onto all
[16:05.120 --> 16:08.800]  white people and all black people to get us in a fight with each other
[16:08.800 --> 16:13.120]  when the real fight is against the globalist taking over it is so
[16:13.120 --> 16:18.320]  elementary it is so simple but you can go to the comments on info wars.com
[16:18.320 --> 16:22.000]  or the comments on cnn or the comments on youtube and it's all the same
[16:22.000 --> 16:27.840]  a bunch of people hurling racial epitads at each other
[16:29.120 --> 16:32.800]  people saying yeah the cops deserve it time we start killing a bunch of them
[16:32.800 --> 16:35.600]  and on the other side all you blacks are going to get it fine we're going to start
[16:35.600 --> 16:38.160]  killing you
[16:39.840 --> 16:43.200]  see how they've now set it up to be racially based
[16:43.200 --> 16:47.040]  manipulating us like a bunch of idiots and the wu-tang clan
[16:47.040 --> 16:51.440]  uh rapper comes out and says you know you reap what you sow
[16:51.440 --> 16:57.600]  really so by that thought if a black man shoots a police officer no matter what
[16:57.600 --> 17:01.360]  color they are then another random black person because i guess they're wearing a
[17:01.360 --> 17:05.840]  skin color uniform deserve to be shot
[17:09.600 --> 17:16.560]  because if you go and shoot a random cop then do the cops get to come randomly
[17:16.560 --> 17:19.760]  shoot someone or the race that shot them or vice versa
[17:19.760 --> 17:23.440]  because a bad cop might do something wrong
[17:23.440 --> 17:26.640]  then you're randomly going to go to some other jurisdiction
[17:26.640 --> 17:30.720]  seven states away and shoot some cop sitting in his quad car
[17:30.720 --> 17:34.320]  filling out paperwork i mean that is the most ridiculous
[17:34.320 --> 17:39.600]  garbage but that's collectivism and that's the so-called multiculturalism
[17:39.600 --> 17:44.720]  ultimate racism see the mind game they claim it's about equality
[17:44.720 --> 17:48.160]  but it's not about judging people individually on what they've done
[17:48.160 --> 17:51.920]  it's about saying whole groups are guilty
[17:51.920 --> 17:59.760]  this is mindless tribalism and while all of this is going on
[17:59.760 --> 18:04.400]  u.s military concerned isis fighters returning to caribbean
[18:04.400 --> 18:10.880]  could reach border the times of israel has the headline is net and yahoo
[18:10.880 --> 18:14.720]  about to lose the election its campaign has grown frantic its
[18:14.720 --> 18:17.840]  activist or morbid and though it would be wrong to
[18:17.840 --> 18:22.160]  bury the ruling lakud party its supporters are right to be worried
[18:22.160 --> 18:25.600]  well lakud will just grease whoever gets elected like
[18:25.600 --> 18:29.760]  will have happened before with ravine
[18:29.760 --> 18:35.040]  but it is true that a lot of israelis are sick of the lakudniks
[18:35.040 --> 18:37.760]  so we're going to be breaking that down and following
[18:37.760 --> 18:43.360]  that here today we do have the net neutrality
[18:43.360 --> 18:47.760]  regulations and i know paul watson's listening i know that
[18:47.760 --> 18:51.840]  a don salazar kit daniels mckelthalon curtain ammo
[18:51.840 --> 18:56.640]  and our other writers are all listening i've just barely had time this morning
[18:56.640 --> 18:59.840]  because i just learned an hour or two ago that these came out
[18:59.840 --> 19:04.160]  to go over the 400 plus pages it's not 300 but we've already found
[19:04.160 --> 19:08.400]  the key areas and i'm going to cover that at the bottom of the hour so
[19:08.400 --> 19:11.120]  for all the writers listening i'm going to give you the subsection
[19:11.120 --> 19:15.680]  and where to go with this because this is really bad
[19:15.680 --> 19:20.480]  this is really bad there's a reason they waited two weeks to release this
[19:20.480 --> 19:23.280]  or two weeks in a day it was two weeks in a day ago that they made the
[19:23.280 --> 19:25.920]  announcement it's exactly what we thought it was
[19:25.920 --> 19:30.320]  it is the fcc's power grab model they've had with the radio
[19:30.320 --> 19:36.720]  and broadcast tv vhfu hf it's bad real bad because no one's reading the
[19:36.720 --> 19:40.480]  enforcement section they're just reading what they claim they're going to do
[19:40.480 --> 19:43.760]  in these declaratory statements but then if you read deeper
[19:43.760 --> 19:47.520]  there are unlimited power grab statements so
[19:47.520 --> 19:52.240]  katie bar the door and get ready because the fcc is trying to eat the
[19:52.240 --> 19:56.000]  internet it's bad no wonder they tried to hide this
[19:56.000 --> 19:59.360]  and then leak this out on a friday we'll be back stay with us
[19:59.360 --> 20:03.280]  i'm mike huckabee i was the governor of arkansas and ran for president in 2008

[24:44.320 --> 24:47.760]  office during the break so i'm just caught my breath
[24:47.760 --> 24:51.360]  this is unbelievable and we just search engine
[24:51.360 --> 24:56.000]  some of these terms in the news no one that we know of yet is reporting what's
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.880]  really in this oh my gosh so i've got Kit Daniels and
[25:00.880 --> 25:05.360]  everybody else working on this right now this is really really bad
[25:05.360 --> 25:09.360]  i don't even have words to describe how bad this is
[25:09.360 --> 25:12.720]  when they say that i'm reeling or my head is spinning
[25:12.720 --> 25:16.960]  when you hear that term like i'm not going to talk about it right now i've
[25:16.960 --> 25:22.320]  got to compose myself this is this just symbolizes everything
[25:22.320 --> 25:26.800]  we're dealing with the wanton out of control power grab as the enemy moves
[25:26.800 --> 25:31.760]  on every front they've got a rural affairs commission
[25:31.760 --> 25:35.840]  under the pentagon to federalize the states and all rural areas
[25:35.840 --> 25:40.080]  they're setting up a national stability stabilization police force
[25:40.080 --> 25:43.280]  they're federalizing the police the borders have been completely lowered
[25:43.280 --> 25:48.560]  without even an executive order they're giving the illegals free everything
[25:48.560 --> 25:52.880]  just to bankrupt the country they're still moving forward with the ammo
[25:52.880 --> 25:55.840]  ban ladies and gentlemen they're just shelving it for a week or two till
[25:55.840 --> 26:00.880]  opposition dies down they are rampaging forward on every front
[26:00.880 --> 26:03.920]  and there is opposition to the gun grabs so they're going to play possum
[26:03.920 --> 26:08.320]  which is an example of if we took action we could actually route these people
[26:08.320 --> 26:11.840]  if folks understood just how much evil we're dealing with
[26:11.840 --> 26:15.120]  and then we've got video of wellness checks
[26:15.120 --> 26:19.520]  code for gun confiscation with actual video
[26:19.520 --> 26:25.520]  of the military training to confiscate our guns i mean my god
[26:25.520 --> 26:28.960]  and so many people are conditioned they go wait i support our military elix
[26:28.960 --> 26:32.240]  it's yeah if you support our military make washington stop giving them
[26:32.240 --> 26:36.800]  unconstitutional criminal missions that if they ever try it is going to start a
[26:36.800 --> 26:40.080]  civil war
[26:40.080 --> 26:44.480]  the federal government's been seized it doesn't have a blank check
[26:44.480 --> 26:48.080]  for foreign governments and corporations to line up and gang rape
[26:48.080 --> 26:52.560]  this country and our children's future
[26:53.120 --> 27:00.160]  they are raping us with a baseball bat covered nails and glass man
[27:00.160 --> 27:04.080]  i mean and i hate to use horrible analyses like that but that isn't strong
[27:04.080 --> 27:07.360]  enough of an analogy we are in deep
[27:07.360 --> 27:13.600]  trouble for five years pepsi uses baby parts
[27:13.600 --> 27:19.280]  in their flavor development for 20 years plus they've been growing
[27:19.280 --> 27:25.840]  humanoids in cows it's facebook in fact i didn't see
[27:25.840 --> 27:30.480]  this in my stacks i saw it last night i wouldn't rather terms and conditions
[27:30.480 --> 27:34.560]  and it was sure enough in a press release but facebook's going to activate
[27:34.560 --> 27:37.760]  your microphone and your camera but it said don't worry
[27:37.760 --> 27:41.440]  we have computers that aggregate the info and protect your identity
[27:41.440 --> 27:44.000]  and then it's just put into an aggregation what you're talking about
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.760]  and saying in your house and they just say it like it's popping fun like oh
[27:47.760 --> 27:51.280]  hi i'm gonna drop by and switch your throat tonight
[27:51.280 --> 27:55.360]  i mean i want to go to people's doors knock and say hi i'm here to plant
[27:55.360 --> 27:59.040]  microphones in your house it's no big deal it's fun i'm wearing a pink shirt
[27:59.040 --> 28:02.560]  with polka dots it's like if you had jerry luis show up
[28:02.560 --> 28:06.160]  and say hi i'm gonna you know beat your wife's brains out of you like oh sure
[28:06.160 --> 28:09.600]  come on in you're not wearing a black uniform
[28:09.600 --> 28:14.240]  see the nazis wore black uniforms to scare people made by hugo boss
[28:14.240 --> 28:17.840]  sharp uniforms but they wanted to project power openly
[28:17.840 --> 28:25.440]  now it's a hi we're trendy oh oh well we're watching you and listening
[28:25.440 --> 28:28.560]  when you when you go and set log into facebook i mean it's
[28:28.560 --> 28:34.000]  worse than i thought twilight zone
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.840]  i mean the fact that george soros would spend almost 35 million dollars that
[28:37.840 --> 28:41.760]  that's mainstream news let's just pull up the article for him
[28:41.760 --> 28:46.080]  to fund the hardcore democrat groups we saw the signs i said it was so it was in
[28:46.080 --> 28:48.160]  the news because i could i went and looked at who was
[28:48.160 --> 28:51.600]  funding it they said the name of groups he funds on there to have people walk
[28:51.600 --> 28:55.920]  around and chant deck the halls with dead cops
[28:55.920 --> 29:00.880]  and to promote violence basically how does he get away with that because he's
[29:00.880 --> 29:04.560]  got a green light people
[29:04.560 --> 29:08.400]  george soros funds Ferguson protest hopes first civil action
[29:08.400 --> 29:13.440]  33 million but then they dug deeper about a week later it was like 35 million
[29:13.440 --> 29:18.240]  and that's on the washington times i mean you're like well i am sick of the cops
[29:18.240 --> 29:22.240]  there where the rubber meets the road so the the globalist on top
[29:22.240 --> 29:26.400]  want to get us all fighting with each other the policies made above them
[29:26.400 --> 29:30.400]  and you're not going to reform the police shooting them in the head
[29:30.400 --> 29:34.000]  that is meant to prime the police state takeover
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.360]  and with it all our rights we are sitting on top a
[29:37.360 --> 29:41.120]  warehouse of tnt right now and george soros and obama
[29:41.120 --> 29:44.080]  are running around with flamethrowers shooting them in the air
[29:44.080 --> 29:48.800]  any minute it's going to set off folks and all hell is going to break loose

[33:47.520 --> 33:51.440]  just the last few hours with my crew
[33:51.440 --> 33:58.560]  go over what exactly is in the 400 plus not 300 plus pages of the telecom
[33:58.560 --> 34:06.080]  not legislation but regulatory rules that the FCC just released
[34:06.080 --> 34:10.720]  two weeks after they said they would and it's all written in legalese it's all
[34:10.720 --> 34:15.520]  written very dry i've worked in talk radio
[34:15.520 --> 34:19.120]  in four different radio stations physically
[34:19.120 --> 34:25.280]  i've been on air 20 years and run my own media telecommunications
[34:25.280 --> 34:28.560]  organization so i know about copyright i know about telecom rules
[34:28.560 --> 34:33.440]  i know about FCC rules i know a lot about the FCC i've been involved in
[34:33.440 --> 34:36.640]  micro fm quite frankly leading a movement to have that
[34:36.640 --> 34:40.960]  sprout up around the country about 18 years ago
[34:40.960 --> 34:45.760]  and i'm just going to leave it at that so i know what i'm talking about when i
[34:45.760 --> 34:48.320]  get into this
[34:49.600 --> 34:52.880]  it'll take the media days to digest what's in here
[34:52.880 --> 34:56.000]  there are a few mainstream news articles that are just saying oh
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.600]  they said they're going to protect the internet here's the sections
[34:59.600 --> 35:03.600]  where they do it and yes they make some claims in there
[35:03.600 --> 35:07.920]  but if you read the enforcement and the powers
[35:07.920 --> 35:12.160]  and the jurisdictions that they are claiming
[35:12.160 --> 35:19.200]  the document 295 times says enforce
[35:20.400 --> 35:25.680]  you can search the term penalty fines
[35:25.680 --> 35:29.920]  sanctions it says in here that you basically can't appeal
[35:29.920 --> 35:36.240]  remember it's the FCC that you're going to be dealing with here
[35:36.240 --> 35:39.120]  and here's what's really bad it does announce
[35:39.120 --> 35:44.400]  as telecom the us code subsection over cable
[35:44.400 --> 35:48.480]  and over internet and basically over all data transmission through the air or
[35:48.480 --> 35:52.400]  downlines this is a total 360 takeover of all
[35:52.400 --> 35:59.360]  communications by the FCC says fines 24 times
[36:00.720 --> 36:06.400]  get ready i mean this is unbelievable
[36:07.200 --> 36:10.720]  in fact print me the whole document i know i've just got subsections here
[36:10.720 --> 36:13.440]  i had the whole document we're tearing it apart and then print me a whole fresh
[36:13.440 --> 36:17.200]  copy please and exactly how many pages is it we'll put it on screen for tv
[36:17.200 --> 36:19.440]  viewers radio listeners go to info wars dot
[36:19.440 --> 36:25.520]  com we have the whole document posted there 400 pages 400 exactly
[36:25.520 --> 36:33.920]  thank you CJ um you go to
[36:35.360 --> 36:38.160]  you go to
[36:38.560 --> 36:43.280]  section 36 of five
[36:43.280 --> 36:51.360]  of FCC 15-24 regulations and it talks about enforcement it
[36:51.360 --> 36:55.760]  defines enforcement and it says the commission may
[36:55.760 --> 36:58.800]  enforce the open internet rules through investigation
[36:58.800 --> 37:02.000]  and processing of complaints both formal and formal this is how they do it
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.920]  broadcast to everything i mean they go in and
[37:05.920 --> 37:08.880]  define it as they've done in broadcast that means complaining about speech
[37:08.880 --> 37:11.680]  everything i mean this is this is so horrible
[37:11.680 --> 37:15.440]  no wonder they sat on this in addition the commission may provide guidance
[37:15.440 --> 37:19.600]  through the use of enforcement advisories and advisory opinions that
[37:19.600 --> 37:25.280]  means they sue you and it will appoint an omnibuds person
[37:25.280 --> 37:28.400]  in order to provide the commission with additional understanding particularly
[37:28.400 --> 37:32.240]  of technical issues the order delegates to the enforcement bureau
[37:32.240 --> 37:36.160]  the authority did you hear that the enforcement bureau
[37:36.160 --> 37:40.400]  it's in every state in every major city to request a written opinion from an
[37:40.400 --> 37:44.080]  outside technical organization that means the telecoms
[37:44.080 --> 37:47.200]  or other corporate groups or otherwise to obtain objective advice
[37:47.200 --> 37:50.960]  from industry standards setting bodies or similar organizations
[37:50.960 --> 37:56.960]  then it goes into the investment with title two to fund the power grab
[37:56.960 --> 38:01.120]  how to tax you how to regulate how the industry
[38:01.120 --> 38:07.040]  has 271 billion dollars a year uh how they're planning to grab some of that i
[38:07.040 --> 38:12.560]  mean this when you know how to read the legalese here boy you better watch out
[38:12.560 --> 38:16.240]  i mean this you know how much they fine and fee and regulate and tax to have an
[38:16.240 --> 38:20.560]  am or fm station uhf vhf
[38:22.160 --> 38:27.600]  enforcement and relationship to existing transparency rule
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.880]  and they go on
[38:34.880 --> 38:41.280]  to basically create a bunch of regulations to harass anybody with
[38:41.280 --> 38:44.720]  any type of media organization if you've got 50 customers on an email
[38:44.720 --> 38:47.920]  account and run some tiny local internet company in some
[38:47.920 --> 38:55.440]  little town they're coming on page 120 you've got
[38:55.440 --> 39:01.280]  272 for informal complaints and investigations the enforcement bureau
[39:01.280 --> 39:04.320]  efforts will continue to be informed by resolutions or formal
[39:04.320 --> 39:06.640]  complaints and will also continue to be informed
[39:06.640 --> 39:11.280]  by the standards developed by existing multi stakeholder
[39:11.280 --> 39:15.360]  that means the globalist companies industry and consumer groups
[39:15.360 --> 39:18.800]  that means all the leftist consumer groups see they'll have a vote on what's
[39:18.800 --> 39:22.080]  done not you the enforcement bureau will also work
[39:22.080 --> 39:26.080]  see when a bunch of george soros NGO's complain oh they're coming
[39:26.080 --> 39:30.560]  the enforcement bureau that's what george soros funded 196 mil to get this in
[39:30.560 --> 39:33.360]  it's always the same guy not demonizing him it's just always him
[39:33.360 --> 39:37.200]  the in one riot and shoot the cops george soros
[39:37.200 --> 39:39.920]  want world government want to turn the guns in george soros want to shut down
[39:39.920 --> 39:43.920]  alex jones george soros want to find the internet takeover george soros
[39:43.920 --> 39:48.960]  want to find a russian war george soros i mean it's just the guys
[39:48.960 --> 39:52.480]  probably smells like sulfur or something and they guys like blz bob in a red
[39:52.480 --> 40:00.000]  red pajamas man the joke a literal nazi collaborator
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.520]  and he's running around in the open screwing the country over the
[40:03.520 --> 40:06.480]  enforcement bureau will also work with interested parties
[40:06.480 --> 40:10.160]  on an informal basis i mean secretly with informants to identify ways to
[40:10.160 --> 40:13.840]  promote compliance with the open internet rules
[40:13.840 --> 40:17.680]  oh promote compliance and then they go into that lawsuits you name it legal
[40:17.680 --> 40:20.160]  authority and this is where you go then find
[40:20.160 --> 40:25.760]  under this title lawsuits fines regulations
[40:25.760 --> 40:30.480]  we ground the open internet rules we adopt today in multiple sources of legal
[40:30.480 --> 40:34.480]  authority section 706 title two title three of the telecommunications
[40:34.480 --> 40:36.720]  act we're going to go to that in a moment
[40:36.720 --> 40:40.480]  we marshal all of these sources of authority towards a common statutory
[40:40.480 --> 40:45.040]  supported goal they're creating a new mega law to protect or a new uniform
[40:45.040 --> 40:49.040]  commercial code to protect and promote internet openness is a platform of
[40:49.040 --> 40:52.880]  competition free expression innovation a driver of economic growth and an
[40:52.880 --> 40:56.800]  engine of virtuous cycle of broadband deployment but we know how they've
[40:56.800 --> 40:59.920]  always really acted and we know obama and soros are for it
[40:59.920 --> 41:03.520]  doesn't matter what they claim they're doing give me the keys to your house
[41:03.520 --> 41:06.640]  why because i want to come and kiss you at night and pat you on the head
[41:06.640 --> 41:12.480]  well you know what no thank you 274 we therefore invoke multiple
[41:12.480 --> 41:17.280]  complementary sources of legal authority as a number of parties point out
[41:17.280 --> 41:23.840]  over authority under section 706 is not mutually exclusive with our authority
[41:23.840 --> 41:27.760]  under so they're just saying basically we do anything we want
[41:27.760 --> 41:31.120]  titles two and three of the act so they're saying we have more power than
[41:31.120 --> 41:34.080]  that rather we read our statute to provide several
[41:34.080 --> 41:37.520]  alternative sources of authority that work in concrete towards
[41:37.520 --> 41:40.720]  common ends as described below under section 706 the
[41:40.720 --> 41:43.760]  commission has the authority to adopt these open internet rules
[41:43.760 --> 41:47.360]  to encouraging and accelerate the deployment of broadband to all americans
[41:47.360 --> 41:51.680]  and that's what they announced five years ago that quote the gut member obama
[41:51.680 --> 41:57.360]  got feds to provide free broadband to all you deserve it like a chicken every
[41:57.360 --> 42:00.800]  pot then they'll bring their regulatory control they'll
[42:00.800 --> 42:04.400]  undercut industry they'll put their messages over
[42:04.400 --> 42:08.400]  and branding and they will certainly give preferential treatment in europe
[42:08.400 --> 42:12.560]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot com is already banned in most train
[42:12.560 --> 42:15.600]  stations libraries you've seen the news articles
[42:15.600 --> 42:18.720]  so that's where this is going this is internet to
[42:18.720 --> 42:22.080]  from the government with select corporations branding at a safe internet
[42:22.080 --> 42:27.360]  which they're going to tax section 706 and b each provided express affirmative
[42:27.360 --> 42:31.760]  grant of authority to the commission and the rules we adopt today
[42:31.760 --> 42:35.360]  fall well within their scope so this is they're basically saying the power we
[42:35.360 --> 42:39.440]  have over broadcast we now have over cable telecoms and all internet
[42:39.440 --> 42:44.080]  transmissions i mean that is huge this isn't we're
[42:44.080 --> 42:50.160]  going to sue somebody uh if they go in and and and don't
[42:50.160 --> 42:52.880]  let certain websites have their information over
[42:52.880 --> 42:56.720]  no no that's already going on it's saying we're going to take it over and
[42:56.720 --> 43:02.240]  provide it for free to everybody and make i mean this is so scary
[43:02.240 --> 43:08.480]  listen to this this is their declaratory statement
[43:08.480 --> 43:15.520]  47 usc 1302 a section 706 a provides in full the commission each state
[43:15.520 --> 43:21.280]  commission that's the state local group oh boy
[43:21.280 --> 43:26.640]  remember they opened up broadband uh on amfm digital where you could have
[43:26.640 --> 43:29.440]  hundreds of local stations if you wanted and they gave them basically to
[43:29.440 --> 43:32.960]  nobody local but they'll give one one channel of hundreds of new ones to
[43:32.960 --> 43:36.640]  some socialist group or some low recon keys to open borders group
[43:36.640 --> 43:39.600]  that's what they've done in austin they've been given actually two channels
[43:39.600 --> 43:43.440]  so the most anti-gun vile garbage gets a
[43:43.440 --> 43:48.320]  fm channel but nobody else does and then all these commercial interests get it
[43:48.320 --> 43:51.760]  see another so it's not even truly socialist where they just hand it out
[43:51.760 --> 43:56.720]  randomly to groups or there's a lottery no all the little pet groups to take
[43:56.720 --> 44:01.280]  over the media who man this is bad
[44:01.280 --> 44:04.400]  the commission each state commission with regulatory jurisdiction over
[44:04.400 --> 44:08.480]  telecommunication services shall encourage the deployment
[44:08.480 --> 44:12.080]  of a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunication capability
[44:12.080 --> 44:17.040]  to all americans see they will decide who gets it
[44:17.040 --> 44:20.880]  not the market including in particular elementary and secondary schools and
[44:20.880 --> 44:23.600]  classrooms by utilizing in a manner consistent with the public
[44:23.600 --> 44:30.880]  interest convenience and necessity price cap regulation price cap oh my gosh
[44:30.880 --> 44:36.080]  that's nixonian or soviet but nixon did do that as well that's why it sounds
[44:36.080 --> 44:43.280]  weird soviet and nixonian yeah price cap they actually use the word price cap
[44:43.280 --> 44:48.800]  regulatory for bayants measures that promote competition i love how they
[44:48.800 --> 44:52.480]  say price caps competition in a local telecommunications
[44:52.480 --> 44:57.040]  market or other regulating methods that remove barriers infrastructure
[44:57.040 --> 45:02.560]  investment well that's antitrust and that's congress not the fcc
[45:02.560 --> 45:07.520]  oh my gosh folks this this just gets worse 281 of page 123 of the open
[45:07.520 --> 45:11.280]  internet rules fall well in the scope of our section 706 authority
[45:11.280 --> 45:17.520]  so they now basically claim broadcast control over everything so
[45:17.520 --> 45:20.320]  what they've done with broadcast they're gonna do with the internet and they're
[45:20.320 --> 45:25.440]  going to create a quote utility that's free well your
[45:25.440 --> 45:28.640]  electricity is not free
[45:30.400 --> 45:33.360]  your gas isn't free but they're saying this is free
[45:33.360 --> 45:36.560]  which is going to be giant giveaways to the big telecoms
[45:36.560 --> 45:40.400]  that play ball just like the obama phone scam
[45:40.400 --> 45:43.840]  so the fcc within and has so many frauds but
[45:43.840 --> 45:47.840]  that's another headline right off that subsection
[45:47.840 --> 45:51.680]  fcc to provide free internet like obama phone
[45:51.680 --> 45:58.880]  as political payoff i mean unbelievable and then carlo swim has made
[45:58.880 --> 46:02.160]  last number i saw in the wall street journal
[46:02.160 --> 46:06.240]  keon's part of the new york times was something like four billion dollars
[46:06.240 --> 46:10.720]  off the obama phone we didn't even give it to an american company
[46:10.720 --> 46:15.440]  to make the billions of dollars off the boondoggle of the free obama phones
[46:15.440 --> 46:20.160]  four billion dollars to the mexican kingpin
[46:20.160 --> 46:23.760]  involved in everything you can imagine
[46:24.960 --> 46:29.200]  oh my god folks i've only gotten into one small area of this i mean this is
[46:29.200 --> 46:34.960]  just unbelievable but what is the media running with
[46:34.960 --> 46:38.080]  the media i'm going to get to in a moment is the controlled media is
[46:38.080 --> 46:41.840]  with what they say they're doing this for because obama care is going to give
[46:41.840 --> 46:44.800]  you something free and we're going to take your guns protect the children
[46:44.800 --> 46:47.840]  it's got all these statements of intent
[46:47.840 --> 46:51.440]  which as we know means nothing what matters is what they actually announced
[46:51.440 --> 46:56.320]  in the teeth of the enforcement and what they claim the powers they have
[46:56.320 --> 46:59.360]  e enforcement of the open internet rules
[46:59.360 --> 47:03.360]  background and they go into how they're going to enforce
[47:03.360 --> 47:06.400]  they're going to hear from consumers that's the socialists that complain
[47:06.400 --> 47:10.160]  and stakeholders that's the big companies
[47:10.160 --> 47:15.920]  and then they write down how they will do it with lawsuits and other mechanisms
[47:15.920 --> 47:18.720]  that they've used under then they miss mentioned the subsections they've used
[47:18.720 --> 47:25.760]  in broadcasts which is armed raids arrest fines fees i mean get ready the
[47:25.760 --> 47:31.120]  FCC i was on a tiny ferry first i saw him on big
[47:31.120 --> 47:34.560]  ferries this weekend done in port aransas a ferry that goes about 200 yards 300
[47:34.560 --> 47:37.520]  yards across there at aransas pass and they had a tsa
[47:37.520 --> 47:42.640]  got bugging his eyes out on people when you're going across takes 60 seconds
[47:42.640 --> 47:47.440]  and it was tsa and if you try to go to galveston at the ferry they search
[47:47.440 --> 47:50.000]  every car that comes through and check under the hood everywhere but the
[47:50.000 --> 47:54.160]  border stays wide open and they fund ISIS it's nothing but internal
[47:54.160 --> 47:58.400]  checkpoints i mean i'm just showing how the tsa is taking over
[47:58.400 --> 48:03.840]  everywhere now as well i mean it is just a federal power grab
[48:03.840 --> 48:10.480]  page 105 designing an effective enforcement process
[48:10.480 --> 48:16.640]  and then it goes through how they will establish
[48:16.640 --> 48:22.720]  department of justice referrals for department of justice visits that's
[48:22.720 --> 48:26.560]  in 228 and how they will also use the state
[48:26.560 --> 48:29.920]  bureaus of the FCC under existing code and when you read
[48:29.920 --> 48:37.040]  the existing code it is in some cases armed FCC agents
[48:37.040 --> 48:40.720]  and they've got stuff in here about oh open to the blind or the deaf
[48:40.720 --> 48:44.560]  so now if you have a tiny website and you don't sign up to google
[48:44.560 --> 48:48.960]  or whatever to then provide translation oh now they're going to come shut you
[48:48.960 --> 48:54.160]  down and they've been talking about that forever i mean this is just a
[48:54.160 --> 48:57.200]  i just don't even have words at this point i mean this is just exactly what
[48:57.200 --> 49:00.000]  we thought it would be a more
[49:01.200 --> 49:04.240]  they say you can find requests for advisory opinions
[49:04.240 --> 49:08.720]  to follow this at via commission's website or with
[49:08.720 --> 49:14.000]  office of the secretary and must be copied to the commission staff
[49:15.040 --> 49:21.440]  so it's the same thing this is so out of control
[49:22.160 --> 49:25.200]  oh here's the best part the enforcement bureau will have discretion
[49:25.200 --> 49:29.600]  to choose whether it will respond to request to their actions so
[49:29.600 --> 49:32.800]  you know they may sue you or shut you down or swat team raid you
[49:32.800 --> 49:36.480]  and then you just they may not even talk to you that really sounds like freedom
[49:36.480 --> 49:38.560]  doesn't it boy thanks for saving the internet
[49:38.560 --> 49:44.800]  obama 234 of 107 although the enforcement bureau
[49:44.800 --> 49:47.520]  will attempt to respond to request for advisory opinions
[49:47.520 --> 49:51.600]  expeditiously we did decline to establish any firm deadlines
[49:51.600 --> 49:58.640]  to rule on them or issue a response talk to the hand
[49:58.640 --> 50:02.960]  it's an obama phone scam to the big telecoms at the top and the minions at
[50:02.960 --> 50:07.760]  the bottom it's a total power grab it's it's it's it's just
[50:07.760 --> 50:14.240]  it's just unbelievable but don't worry in appendix final rules
[50:14.240 --> 50:18.400]  they just have some statements about 8.5 no blocking
[50:18.400 --> 50:23.680]  8.7 no throttling 8.9 no paid
[50:24.480 --> 50:29.920]  prior prioritization i guess that's where you
[50:29.920 --> 50:33.600]  you know pay to have your stuff pushed out more and they're actually saying that
[50:33.600 --> 50:37.360]  may stop google ads because you pay there to get your
[50:37.360 --> 50:41.200]  ad promoter more but that's just how it works and there's a bunch of lawsuits
[50:41.200 --> 50:43.760]  getting ready to over this and we'll just become a big battle of paying off
[50:43.760 --> 50:46.160]  politicians to decide how it ends up
[50:46.160 --> 50:49.760]  regulatory being shut up and so it's just putting the internet up on the
[50:49.760 --> 50:52.720]  chopping block is what this is doing there'll be a huge fight
[50:52.720 --> 50:56.160]  billions will be spent on lawyers by all sides and in the end the telecoms
[50:56.160 --> 50:59.440]  will come in and take over the internet as they plan in the beginning

[55:51.360 --> 55:56.880]  want the FCC to save the internet the FCC works for the big corporations and
[55:56.880 --> 55:59.520]  they help consolidate media down to four companies
[55:59.520 --> 56:03.200]  and they always have and they always will and the big corporations couldn't get
[56:03.200 --> 56:06.320]  it done so they had the FCC come in like it was
[56:06.320 --> 56:08.880]  going to save it and now they're going to have a two three year
[56:08.880 --> 56:13.280]  battle and carve it up but we've got a public with an
[56:13.280 --> 56:17.040]  attention span of about six and a half minutes used to be about 15

[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:52.320]  the FCC has gobbled up the internet they're claiming they're going to use
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:57.200]  broadcast rules and justice department and local enforcement through their
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.280]  federal bureaus at the state level to power grab the only other outlet that's
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:07.120]  reporting on any of this is rt and they've got a report out five things
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:11.280]  you need to know it is really really bad that's all up on infowars.com
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:16.000]  and we're going to post the whole rt article with my commentary as soon as

[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:36.000]  just start grabbing stuff during the show live that's key intel and then putting
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.280]  that out as little pieces and then put the whole out later that something needs
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:43.520]  to be implemented immediately we've got an increase output in the face of the
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:49.200]  globalist you notice their power grabbing everything and trying to start
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:54.560]  race wars and mix anti-police garbage into it and again i'm the guy
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.240]  constantly criticizing the federalization and corruption of police but
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:04.240]  that is not criticizing the police they want to turn us into a third world
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:08.320]  country so that's how they work you're anti-government

[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:44.640]  plus percent of the scientists in the epa and fda twice
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.480]  have gotten together in the last decade and sent letters to their superiors
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.360]  at the head of the fda and epa saying ban it
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:55.040]  that so the people in government are actually good it's that the bureaucracies
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.520]  run by big corporations that are blocking all this
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:01.360]  when the damn breaks of the cover-up it's over
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:05.760]  here's another one fluoride in drinking water may trigger depression weight gain
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.160]  warrant scientists in a new study and it goes into frying or thyroid
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:16.480]  pancreas depression obesity absolutely let's continue
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.160]  that is out of the london telegraph impact of flora neurological development
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.560]  children of these two last articles were from this week
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:26.720]  this one's from a few years ago that's harvard
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:31.280]  here is environmental health perspectives developmental fluoride
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:36.720]  neurotoxicity a systematic review of meta analysis
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.720]  and this goes into a huge study on brain damage you name it i mean you wonder
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:44.080]  how people are dumb and in a fog but here's what's more important
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:48.400]  prozac derivatives run off into all major water supplies
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:52.960]  hydrofluorosalic acid is fluoride that's basically been electrically charged
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:57.600]  i've had physicists scientists toxicologists brain surgeons on medical
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.440]  doctors you name it endocrinologists they all concur it's been in the
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.000]  literature forever they knew back in the 30s
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.880]  that fluoride was an adjuvant and dumb people down and made them submit the
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.880]  soviets and the nazis put in the water that's a
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:14.240]  pull surprise winning books look it up nuremberg problem
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:18.240]  but they also found it accelerates other drugs in the body
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.680]  it magnifies like an amplifier their effect
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:26.080]  that's why they put it in folks it is accelerating all the other toxins and
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.520]  we're going to talk to dr ever group whose dad was a famous chemist dr
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:33.840]  groups and massive studies on this one of the leading experts
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:37.920]  now i went over all that because i've also got
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:41.760]  another article here study confirms chronic kidney failure
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:45.840]  five times higher in glyphosate ridden areas and the studies just two of them
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:49.120]  found five times higher we put in the youtube headline
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:52.960]  may be linked to it i mean info wars whoever wrote that head on the month
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.480]  mad but we actually kind of whitewashed it we need to stop doing that to all my
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:59.360]  crew i just i talked to the whole crew here on air you're great
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:03.040]  but the study said there was five times fold increase
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:06.560]  so the headline we have is five times fold increase in kidney failure in
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:09.440]  areas of the glyphosate and water then you can go read the study and make your
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:12.800]  own decision but i mean this is killing people
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.760]  there's a reason they're opening up dialysis places all over and you look
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.160]  at a map of where roundup shoes around the world
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.520]  they didn't have all this kidney failure in brazil 20 years ago they bring it in
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:25.680]  suddenly it's skyrockets or guatemala or nigeria
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:31.680]  or thailand and or shrillanka that that's what's in these studies
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:36.560]  now joining us is dr evergrip i'm gonna try to shut up so you can roll over all
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:39.920]  this but first i'm gonna plug that didn't plug last hour because it happens to
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:43.280]  dovetail with exactly why he came in today and we'll show folks a shot of
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:47.680]  these household products that are admitted
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:51.920]  testosterone blockers you wonder why males in the west
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:55.120]  have testosterone level about two-thirds lower than the average third world
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:58.400]  male why genitalia in blacks whites hispanics doesn't matter
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:03.040]  are shrinking in size why 87 to 96 depending on what country you're in
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:08.400]  of the sperm are dead basically or non-mobile they don't have tails
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:13.120]  why is this happening because these chemicals are known to fry
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:17.840]  your entire male system i mean it works great if you want a big
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:21.360]  giant prostate and diet cancer we're going to talk about all this
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:25.840]  coming up with dr evergrip but
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.760]  he developed super male superfemale vitality superfemale vitality sold out
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:33.600]  right now we just got it in fortuitously the day he was already
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.640]  scheduled to be here and arrived on the truck
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.960]  we are going to be able to now offer super male vitality sold out for two
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.520]  weeks and i've got even better news it is a super male vitality
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.360]  that has three new ingredients in it one of the ingredients we can no longer
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.400]  get and start to fire organic and it was just a detoxifier that we have in the
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.880]  fluoride shield when we have to discontinue that the
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:58.800]  chelogy of an organic type it didn't matter that wasn't one of the
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:01.760]  boosters that was just one of the cleaners so we added
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:06.160]  three things for the one thing we took out and i had an advanced batch before
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.120]  we manufactured it a few months ago and quite frankly
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:12.480]  i still like superfemale the best but this is better than the original super
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:16.400]  male and each batch is different i've taken three
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:20.080]  times a day unbelievable because what it does
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.760]  and dr evergrip will talk about this is helps get your organs going helps get
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.160]  the glands going because we're bombarded with estrogen
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:29.840]  mimicers and these toxins and so i used to be against
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.160]  doing stuff like this because i thought well i don't need more testosterone
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:36.560]  that makes you crazy well yeah if it's a moderate amount
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:39.200]  that's what you're naturally supposed to have guys that are all roided out it's
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:41.760]  terrible but the natural way to do it is avoid
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.720]  these products and then take the proper herbs to boost it
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:47.840]  now dr group that's a five minute rant we're going to skip this network break

[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:34.320]  dr group before you do your presentation on forget getting super male
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:37.280]  there's things you can do as you were telling me earlier
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.040]  right now to boost your testosterone a bunch of other things and and to
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:44.160]  keep the estrogen mimicers out of you without buying diddly
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:48.640]  jack squat from us okay it's very simple but infowarslife.com
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:52.800]  new super male is available infowarslife.com
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:56.480]  talk about super male the new formulation then get into your presentation
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:00.640]  okay so what we wanted to do with the new super male was make it more bio
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:05.040]  available and then since we had the original super male vitality out there
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:09.360]  for a long time we were noticing that we could actually take a few of the herbs
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:12.560]  and change them around and strengthen some of them
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:16.880]  and then weaken a couple of the other ones the whole goal was to create a
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:22.480]  stronger more potent formula using advanced extraction
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:27.040]  methodologies and just to explain that people what herbal extraction is cold
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:31.120]  press concentrated no most of the herbal supplements you're going to get
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.680]  out there are extracted using solvents and that's alcohol which is an endocrine
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.480]  disrupting chemical and other types of chemical
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:43.120]  solvents and they use high heat but what we were trying to do especially
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:46.640]  and we did that with the original super male but now we've taken it to the next
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.320]  level to where we're able to actually capture
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.680]  the potency of the essential oils in the plant
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:58.080]  where the resins in the plant all of the components that made the original
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:02.240]  super male vitality so effective so this formula has a kind of a new
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:07.360]  processing technique and is actually I would say the results are
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:10.160]  extremely better from the people that have tried it
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:13.920]  over the last it's only been out for maybe two or three months in testing
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.960]  phase it doesn't taste as good because it's stronger I can tell that
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.800]  you can definitely taste more of the plant components but as far as I mean
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.600]  it didn't taste good before but now you taste like you're drinking something
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.240]  serious I mean I'm gonna be honest with folks
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:32.320]  the the libido aspect of it the mental acuity aspect of it just
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:36.640]  feeling the fat burning ability all of the things that you got with the
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:39.280]  super the original super male vitality
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:44.480]  now you're getting even increased effects with the new super male vitality
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:48.240]  and the fact that we have the folvic acid in there which acts to carry those
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:51.360]  those plant constituents into the cells deeper
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:56.480]  and make them more bio available so all in all I would say it's probably 20 to
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.680]  30 percent more potent than the original super male vitality was
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:03.440]  it doesn't taste bad it just you you know you taste it and it's like wow that
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:07.440]  that's something serious yeah it is and one of the things you know you have so
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:10.960]  many males out there right now that are on testosterone either the patches or
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:14.640]  the injections but the main concern that that we talk
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:19.200]  about on this show all the time is the estrogen levels the high estrogen levels
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:22.960]  and today I actually testosterone breaks down into estrogen
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:26.000]  right yes and in the male it's estradiol and so
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.120]  one of the reasons why you're having side effects in the FDA
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:33.040]  coming down and saying testosterone causes strokes and heart attacks
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:36.880]  is not necessarily because of the testosterone that you're on but it's
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:40.800]  because of the high estrogen levels again the far I've talked to weight
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:44.880]  lifters and people who for years did take tests on things and they said listen
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:48.320]  and people I know personally they said man this isn't a joke I thought it was
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.400]  you know quack stuff because I've tried other supplements
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:54.080]  this stuff is like hardcore what in the world's in it
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.880]  I know some of them have been around here you've talked to them I mean but but
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:00.640]  this is natural and explain people this doesn't mimic testosterone
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:04.880]  explain to me how it works it you get your body's glands just to wake up or
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:09.200]  okay so how it works is the herbs that we chose are designed to
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:14.480]  boost the body's own production of testosterone balancing the levels of
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:18.000]  testosterone to estrogen or estradiol in the body
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000]  as well as boosting the net your natural growth hormone production so it
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.520]  actually causes the body to say well do I need
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:28.560]  more to to produce more testosterone today it actually
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:32.400]  activates your reproductive system to produce more testosterone tell folks the
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:35.200]  things you've added to the formula because you've added more things and
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:39.280]  remove one thing well we actually didn't add anything we just moved
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:42.640]  things around a little bit and the reason we did well that I misunderstood you I
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:46.000]  guess you increase some of things yeah we increased some of the herbs
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.680]  herbs and made them stronger we did switch to some organic herbs some better
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:54.720]  sources and suppliers but it was really more of the extraction process and the
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.320]  process the only thing that's different than is the
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:01.040]  shilajit the only thing that's different is we the the strength of the
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:04.880]  individual herbs that we put in there and we took the shilajit out
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:09.440]  and and added fulvic acid which really shilajit is mostly fulvic acid anyway it's
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:14.880]  a fulvic acid and humic acid blend so and what does the fulvic acid do
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:17.120]  that's an adjuvant right at turbo charges
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:20.400]  fulvic acid is it makes everything in there stronger it makes what makes it
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:25.600]  more bioavailable it makes it stronger and fulvic acid in itself is a healing
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:32.160]  agent it contains multiple minerals inside the fulvic acid so if you combine
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:37.120]  you know 50 60 different minerals into that formula as well it's almost like
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:42.320]  you have the soil and the actual herb inside the bottle at once
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:45.280]  so you're going to you're going to get the humic and the fulvic
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:48.720]  content usually in in good compost so it's almost like we're
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:53.760]  we're taking the whole plant with the soil and processing it all together and
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:58.320]  the end product is a herbal extraction that's done with
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:02.800]  a cold processing system that we we're the first we're 10 or 15 years
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:06.160]  ahead of the time as far as extraction because we're able to
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:10.160]  concentrate all of the components especially the active components of the
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:13.040]  herb so it's not like dry herbs have been in a warehouse for five years and
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:17.200]  are basically dead it's fresh raw organic concentrated
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:20.640]  and that's why it's having such a big effect well one of the things that we
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:24.480]  try to do as much as we can is get the herbs as fresh as we can and a lot of
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:28.560]  times it's good to dry them or even freeze dry them and
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:33.040]  and that preserves the components in those individual herbs but yes
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:37.520]  not using the high heat and when we can get herbs as fresh as we can we get them
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:43.120]  cut and sifted instead of powdered you know anytime you buy powdered herbs
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:46.480]  you the since the herbs are already in a fine powder then they
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:50.480]  they oxidize and you lose some of those essential oils i mean essential oils
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:55.040]  are one of the most powerful forms of medicinal
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:58.160]  qualities that you have so really to be fair from a layman's perspective when
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:01.760]  you read these ingredients these are really concentrated
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:06.800]  mixtures or formulas of essential oils from the plants
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:09.920]  the old alchemists that's why they're so thick i mean this is oil yeah this is
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:13.600]  this is we're doing like an extraction and then another extraction i mean
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.120]  we're making these this concentrated resin almost that's
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:21.360]  then mixed in it's it goes back to the old alchemist ways of
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:26.400]  paracelsus where spegeric processing is separating and
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.560]  then recombining back to life so the old way they used to do it is distill
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.840]  out the essential oils and then and then ferment the plant
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:37.120]  material and then you know use other different types of
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:41.840]  solvents but now with the technology we can actually take the plant material
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:45.840]  and and combine and not lose the essential oils and the resins and all
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:49.520]  the active components of the plant any alcohol tincture that you find on the
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:53.600]  market out there is only probably 40 percent to 50 percent
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:57.840]  of the actual components constituents well my issue isn't the tiny bit of
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:01.600]  alcohol you get and it's that obviously the alcohol is going to
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:06.960]  basically suck out the nutrients and and as a solvent break down the different
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:09.680]  ring structures of the trace elements and things
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:13.840]  that are in there it's going to kill like a microwave what was there
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:17.200]  to put it in layman's terms is that right right and alcohol in itself is an
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.760]  endocrine disrupting chemicals so it besides the fact that most
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:25.280]  alcohol is is made from corn and is genetically modified and that's
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:28.560]  and that's one of the reasons why you know the
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:31.920]  even with net neutrality i mean the government the pharmaceutical companies
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:35.280]  we look all around us and it's all a chemical attack and the chemical
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:39.440]  attack is to reduce your immune system create illness
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:43.200]  and then try to come on the back end and manage that illness well that's what
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:49.920]  i was going to get to next is that when you look at main line news week main
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:53.440]  line harvard main line london telegraph yes
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.440]  fluoride is making you fat is giving you cancer is making your thyroid
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:01.040]  screw up you know either get lower high thyroid it says
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:04.960]  is causing adhd that's everything you and dr blalock
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:08.880]  and everybody had been saying for decades it's in the medical literature
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:12.320]  just like vaccines hurting people are how long
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:15.920]  can they keep covering it up a and then b
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:20.160]  what do you make of the schizophrenia where national geographic
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:25.600]  in the in one issue said that fluoride's really bad for you but then in the next
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.360]  issue made fun of people what's going on because used to they just said it's
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:34.320]  good for your shut up now what is mainstream
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:40.320]  doing telling the truth finally i mean the more people that get educated on
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:43.360]  the negative effects of fluoride the better i think it's coming to a point
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:46.960]  where people are demanding the truth and and so many journalists have brain
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:49.360]  damaged kids nothing will wake you up like you're
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.920]  taking your two-year-old for a shot and they start bleeding out the nose never
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:54.720]  talk again that'll that'll kind of wake you up won't it and that's the same
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.760]  thing that's happening i think really across the board i mean look what
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:01.440]  happened with bpa with the with the uh baby bottles i mean there was a big
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:05.520]  outcry and i think once the public gets to a certain point
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:10.160]  then and like you said uh once once these studies come out
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:13.200]  it's getting into the mainstream it's getting into the journals i mean you
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.880]  can look at the mainstream medical journals
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:21.280]  across the board and yes they still do put out a lot of bad stuff but at the
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:24.880]  same time there's a demand that people want to know about
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:28.800]  uh phthalates and the effects on the thyroid there's independent scientists
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:32.880]  independent doctors that are pushing what about mcdonald's and drier's ice cream
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:36.640]  i mean it's it's no exaggeration 1015 companies a week but mcdonald's is the
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:40.960]  biggest you know the number one retail food seller out there for fast food
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:45.280]  worldwide they're pulling gmo wheat gmo corn they
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:49.120]  say uh they're they're pulling high fructose corn syrup they claim
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:52.720]  they're going in that direction they claim they're pulling the synthetic
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:58.640]  growth hormone out of their milk i mean these are devastating victories
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:02.800]  they are devastating victories which are great i mean i've always said the best
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:07.360]  way to attack this is to not buy the things that are
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.080]  dangerous that are ruining the environment and ruining your health well
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:12.640]  what is the elite going to do though is people start to wake up and actually
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:16.720]  read the vaccine insert i mean i know this since i started reading the
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.240]  inserts on air every week erotically they are coming after us man they are
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:22.640]  mad they just because we're reading the insert
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:26.640]  from what i hear they're going to start vaccinating people through the air
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.440]  that's what bill gates is funding yeah ends with food you know there's nothing
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:32.240]  you can do about that i mean if they mix vaccines in with the chem
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:36.080]  trails and they already have all these quadrivalent and hexavalent and trivalent
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:39.840]  things and as they can you know easily surround
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:43.440]  them with lipid profiles and stuff like that to where they're not going to be
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:47.440]  damaged in the air by you know they can float down right on time release
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:51.280]  nasally delivered that's the thing that that's part of the reason why they
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:55.200]  were saying oh let's contain this measles outbreak at disneyland at disney
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:59.680]  world or whatever they're starting to say okay
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:06.480]  we in the future we can rope off an area by air or you know
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:10.240]  set up military you know personnel around that area or whatever
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:14.080]  and it's going to be a lot easier to just go over and spray the whole city
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:17.680]  yeah for those that don't read it for those that don't read in people
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:21.840]  the crew can pull this up bill gates developing
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:26.720]  vaccines in bananas vaccines in corn vaccines to be sprayed by air vaccines
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:31.200]  to be delivered by mosquito quote so people can't get away with avoiding it
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:33.920]  and you know they're already testing on the third world
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:38.320]  yeah that's right so what what i've been saying is don't buy the round up the
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:42.000]  glyphosate i mean really would you look at it if you if you look at the why are
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.920]  you racist against kidney failure because i don't want to see kidney failure i
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:48.560]  don't want to see people go through and that's a good point that you made with
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.040]  all the dialysis i don't even remember a dialysis
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:54.560]  center when i was growing up but not only are you seeing dialysis centers
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:57.600]  everywhere you're seeing infertility clinics everywhere by the way look at
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:01.440]  those headlines bill gates unleashes swarm of
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:04.720]  mosquitoes crowd fox news that then you go back to the
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.680]  bill and one the gates website it's all on there
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:12.080]  yeah bill gates is uh he is he's just as bad looking about source but i mean bill
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:15.280]  gates is just as bad and and you know probably worse
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:19.440]  probably probably but i don't know how at 87 or whatever it is

[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:28.240]  well the wu ten clan head rappers come out and said the police basically got
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:32.640]  what they deserved if you reap what you sow
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:37.520]  so by that extension if police just randomly go out and
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:42.080]  shoot black men uh they deserve it because they're black
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:45.120]  and undoubtedly there are probably some racist scared cops out there that will
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:48.480]  probably be trigger happy now and shoot blacks we put an
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:52.560]  article up about a month ago we had to repull that it was a mainline news
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.720]  article but we broke it down in an article
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:58.880]  where police are twice as likely to shoot a white or hispanic
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:02.160]  statistically according to population that's not saying there are more
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:05.680]  Hispanics or whites whose numbers are about equal now in the country
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:09.440]  this all just people i'm so sick of using these terms the point is
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:14.240]  is that blacks are much less likely to get shot
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:19.840]  most cops do not want all the paperwork and the lawsuits and to go to jail
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:24.640]  do they shoot innocent blacks sometimes yeah but a lot of these videos they
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:28.080]  don't and it turned out in the brown case it wasn't the case
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:30.480]  it doesn't matter george soros the justice department had been there
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:34.080]  stirring it all up dr grip just briefly then i want to get into

[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:14.240]  how we can at least mitigate some of this by by getting natural products and in
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:18.320]  many cases are less expensive than the toxic forms of them
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:22.720]  well uh originally when i was doing my research as to the root cause of all
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:25.920]  disease it all linked back to chemicals but then when you start
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:29.840]  looking at the chemicals and saying okay how does that affect the body
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:33.280]  if the big picture starts coming into play because you realize that the
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:37.120]  majority of the chemicals are going to have an effect on the thyroid gland
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:40.720]  or they're going to have an effect on the intestinal lining those are all
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:44.080]  endocrine glands and those produce hormones that's what keeps you happy
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:47.920]  that's what keeps you strong pretty much all the symptoms that people
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:52.480]  develop negative symptoms in their life are all due to some form of chemical
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:57.760]  but the link with the hormones was really uh incredible
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:01.360]  because it got deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper because you can we
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:04.480]  started linking everything in the kitchen you know
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:08.160]  you can link it to micro the introduction to microwave ovens i mean
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:13.200]  and then the plastic foods that go into microwave ovens the phthalates
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:16.800]  all of the chemicals and and linking back to the chemical
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:21.200]  companies the pharmaceutical companies and the relationship between all of them
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:24.880]  that they don't even have to list most of the chemicals on the label there's
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:28.560]  80 000 toxic carcinogenic chemicals that are
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:34.160]  allowed by the FDA by the USDA by our government that are allowed to be
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:38.640]  put in household products and they know that if they can affect your hormone
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:44.320]  problems number one you're going to have a population control system going on
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:47.440]  because you're the male sperm counts going to go way down
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:53.200]  you're going to have high high estrogen content in males and females
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:58.000]  obesity rates going to rise diabetes rates exponentially if you mess with the
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.040]  hormone levels you're going to see a rise in every
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:04.640]  single degenerative disease you're going to see a rise in death and you're also
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:10.560]  going to see a reduction of births and you know with
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:13.440]  fertility you're going to start seeing infertility and sterility and the
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:18.400]  scary thing about this is and in all these chemicals by the way
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:23.120]  document everything erotically put up sperm counts plummet in the west
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:28.240]  and it'll show 86 to 90 something percent it'll be bbc ap Reuters hit the
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:31.280]  enemy hard and that's why the enemy hates us we just show
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:34.560]  everything all we're doing showing people what's actually admitted go ahead
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:37.840]  and that's and that's and that's all traceable back because you're not going
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:40.480]  to get any of these chemicals are going to come in through your skin or they're
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:43.200]  going to come in through your mouth wall street journal the decline in male
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:45.200]  fertility look at that hit them and hit them hard
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:48.720]  yep and you said earlier the glyphosate and not only glyphosate but the
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:54.000]  atrazine and those are two heavily produced hormone endocrine disrupting
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.680]  chemicals that are sprayed on 80 percent of the crops that have all gotten into
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:02.000]  the water system you know how do you avoid all these things men
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.600]  ask me what are some of the most common things that i'm doing that i can
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:10.080]  eliminate right now look at that headline tv 20 hours a week
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:13.600]  cut sperm count in half according to new study what source is that
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:16.160]  that's not a one independent i mean i already knew that and cause the
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:20.000]  neurological disorders the television is a weapon right and cell phones
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:25.680]  cell phones also alter the production of testosterone and alter the sperm they
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:29.760]  break the dna they cause sperm mutations right that's right so
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:34.000]  you know you can go through your house and find a majority of things but really
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.440]  one of the key things is men i mean women have
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:41.120]  hormone imbalances too i mean but they're they're more attuned to theirs
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:44.400]  men they just start getting lethargic they start losing their energy levels
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:48.240]  they start accumulating fat around their stomach and that's that fat around the
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:50.800]  stomach is all due to high estrogen level
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:54.000]  estradiol levels in males in low testosterone
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.440]  also something that's not talked about a lot is males actually
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:01.520]  produce progesterone as well and we're seeing that progesterone levels in
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:06.240]  male are almost nil so you have high estradiol levels
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:10.880]  extremely low testosterone levels and virtually non-existent progesterone
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:16.560]  levels and those hormones really control everything there's no reason
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:19.920]  that that our grandfathers were super good-looking skinny
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:23.440]  and would eat giant meals and didn't even really work out other than do
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:26.640]  them stuff on the ranch or whatever and then now
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:30.160]  i've seen the studies that we eat less than people used to
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:33.920]  it's just the additives and the crud and all of it that's why you have these
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:38.240]  giant fat people everywhere practically every cosmetic product
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:41.920]  i mean just just for example most men use deodorants let's talk about these
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:45.360]  products you're not just singling out speed stick or dial i mean it's in all
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:48.000]  of them but these are these are just what to look for
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:53.520]  a matter of fact like 95 percent of the deodorants out there and you you don't
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:57.360]  think that that's a big deal just putting one one or two strips of deodorant on
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:00.400]  every morning but you have to remember that deodorant has aluminum which is a
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:04.000]  metalloestrogen and it's it's a hormone disrupting
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.360]  chemical an adjuvant right yep and all of the chemicals that are
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:11.280]  in here are all plasticizers it's in a plastic bottle
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:14.320]  these are all bends you know you can't even pronounce half of them there's
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:20.000]  polyethylene glycol in here 90% of the chemicals inside deodorant
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.440]  including the aluminum are toxic to the body explain your dad was a famous
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:27.280]  petrochemical chemist they have all these
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:30.720]  distillates the stuff that the store get rid of so they just put it in thousands
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:33.920]  of products right and actually what most people don't know is
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:37.520]  the toxic chemicals are listed under fragrance when you and that's how they
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:41.360]  get away with listing the most toxic chemicals because the fda allows them
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:45.440]  to put fragrance on there because it's a proprietary chemical formula
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:48.480]  and most of the most damaging estrogen mimicers
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:53.200]  and and toxic chemicals that disrupt your hormone levels are actually listed
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:56.000]  under fragrance and you're going to see that in all
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.320]  cos in all cosmetic products my dad actually was a co-developer of saran wrap
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:03.840]  he was one of the the first inventors of pvc plastics
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:08.000]  actually so uh and i just found out recently that he was
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.560]  about to come out with a report that a study
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:16.800]  saying that the plastics are directly linked to cancer
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:19.680]  and hormonal deficiencies and everything which is now proven and then what
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:23.120]  happened to him right well happened right he was killed
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:26.800]  i mean you know all of a sudden he got cancer in his throat one day and in a
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:30.000]  week later he was dead and then a bunch of guys in suit showed up at my mom's
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.160]  house i was there when they came in they had a stack of paperwork this thick
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:36.560]  you know i was young i didn't really understand what's going on she was
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:40.080]  grieving and they basically said look we're going to give you $250,000
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:44.320]  sign all these documents and then that's it and then they put a memorial
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:47.840]  from my dad they built a whole lake and they put a little memorial thing up
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:53.040]  there at the exxon baytown facility we ought to go to that show that
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:55.840]  new documentary about that yeah we should i don't even know if it's
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:58.880]  still there but i had pictures of it i went out there one time they had the
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:03.680]  bench and everything i'm sure it's there but my family history goes back to
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:07.520]  the webter's the the appellateia webster who was the original
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:12.720]  author of the us constitution and my you know the group family goes back to the
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:16.000]  webster family on my on my grandmother's side and know a
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.280]  webster who's my great great great great grandfather was the one that
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:22.400]  wrote the webster's dictionary and also put the hidden
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:26.080]  you know masonic code in the webster's dictionary too so
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:30.000]  i have a long history with the us and the consider and my great great great
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.240]  great great grandfather is the one that actually
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:34.960]  well a lot of folks that settle texas do yeah
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:38.560]  yeah so i mean getting back to the personal care products and you know it's
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:42.080]  a combination of things that that happened that you can that you're
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:46.240]  putting on your skin every single day i mean just take standard soap for example
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:49.040]  you have trickle sand in there which is it which is an endocrine
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:52.720]  disrupting chemical you have phthalates in there you have
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:57.520]  all different polyethylene glycol there's probably 20 explain to folks what
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:01.120]  polyethylene glycol is well that's just antifreeze basically you drink that
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:03.840]  you're dead in the hammer right and you're putting all that on your skin
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:06.640]  and when you're in the shower i mean where do you put a nicotine
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:11.600]  strip on your skin you imagine under your arm it's even more absorbed
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:14.320]  what's the word right what's the word absorbing
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:17.760]  yes i mean it's being directly absorbed through your skin
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:21.120]  let's show some of the and the camera can zoom in let's show some of the
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:26.320]  so your standard soap your body spray you know all your body sprays body gels i
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:29.440]  put aftershave but believe it or not perfumes and
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:32.880]  colognes because they have the toxic fragrances in there and people spray
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:35.280]  those all over their body
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:39.200]  another thing that's extremely damaging is the spray
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:42.480]  sunscreen oh you go to the beach or martin springs
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:46.000]  you're just breathing and these idiots are spraying all over them right and
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.200]  and they're too lazy to all over their skin and all that's doing is going in
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:53.040]  and producing massive amounts of estrogen what's in barbisol
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:56.400]  what's in barbisol that's going to be your shave cream
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:00.480]  and you have steric acid you have trimethylamine
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:06.480]  chymethanolamine you have isobutane you have butane actually in there that's a
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:10.320]  bastard gas mommy worth 23 sodium laurel sulfate you
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:14.080]  have propane and again you have fragrance propane and propane
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:17.360]  accessories that's right so you put you're actually
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:20.480]  putting all those chemicals right on your face and you're putting it in on your
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:23.440]  skin and that's you know that's disrupting
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:27.440]  all of your normal endocrine gland function
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:31.840]  disrupting your hormone balance which is why
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:35.440]  one of the reasons why we developed super female vitality and super male
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:38.880]  vitality because yes you need water is another
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:42.320]  is another big thing that you talked about with the fluoride well
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:47.360]  if you just use the water filtration system and you just drink clean and pure
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.440]  water you're already eliminating the fluoride
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:55.920]  the pesticide residue the insecticide residue all the endocrine disrupting
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:59.360]  hormones but they know when you disrupt your
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:02.880]  hormone levels that that's going to cause anxiety and it's going to cause
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:06.880]  depression and it's going to cause weight gain and lack of confidence so
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:11.040]  what happens then you go to your psychologist you
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:13.840]  tell your psychologist that you're feeling depressed
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:17.120]  and what do you what does your psychologist put you on paxil
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:21.440]  put you on antidepressants anti-anxieties which are made of fluoride
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:25.200]  so you're calcifying your pineal gland your body's getting worse your immune
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:28.880]  systems being depressed on a regular basis
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:35.760]  so the solution is clean out your body avoid all of the chemical
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:39.680]  substances don't buy anymore round up for your yard anymore
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:43.040]  now you can go online and find you know do it yourself
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:47.840]  uh natural organic insecticide mixes pesticide get rid of all your cleaning
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:50.560]  products in your house replace them with natural
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:54.000]  substitutes and you're eliminating number one all the hormone
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.600]  disrupting chemicals and not only hormone disrupting chemicals but
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:03.280]  disease causing chemicals number two you're not supporting anymore the big
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:06.320]  companies that are creating the chemical and then that will make the new
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:09.600]  dominant market the healthy stuff and that's exactly what's happening i mean
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:13.520]  now you're starting to see the dominant market mcdonald's you're starting to see
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:16.960]  people that were you know i'd like to see monsanto
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:20.240]  stopped all the gmo stuff and stopped the round up and come out with an
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:23.520]  organic natural alternative but you will see that
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:26.960]  over time other because the demand is there
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:30.960]  the organic movement the natural movement is billion billions of dollar
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:34.160]  industry it's growing rapidly all of the stores the

[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:21.200]  it can cause organ damage and everything else

[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:34.560]  boats like 50 people they went out about 40 miles and my son
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:38.000]  was in on catching as they let four different people battle it took hours
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.160]  a seven foot mako talk about a scary looking shark that's the number one
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:45.520]  attacker in open water they i mean they go after people on purpose

[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:50.960]  not mako they come at you and then of course
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:55.280]  cj was pointing out one time he was um just on the east coast and a bullshark
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:58.640]  chasty man those are the ones that attack you in shallow water
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:03.200]  uh but uh he he gaffed him everything we he's got some video
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:07.520]  uh that was shot on a phone i've got to get it off my dad's phone
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:12.160]  uh but um it's pretty dramatic and i mean he went in i'm really it's 12 years old
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:15.680]  my dad said he's gonna be way more manly than you you you never would have handled
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:19.520]  it wasn't be 12 hour trip but with the fishing was so good
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:22.800]  that they did 16 hours in like just really bad weather
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:26.560]  we still and um yeah i went out didn't go out
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:31.200]  and he was just out there battling and catching grouper and snapper and he
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:34.880]  caught five sharks uh caught a reef shark that had to let go
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:39.040]  was four feet long um he got a grouper up so big but the
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:43.440]  the uh huge grouper but the uh the hook came out
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:46.800]  he's been out deep sea fishing probably 10 times he said this was
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:50.480]  better than all of them combined that's what's so great about our planet
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:53.760]  and and just how interesting it is and how wonderful it is and the adventure
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:57.120]  of it i don't know why i just went off in that direction
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:01.040]  well that's great i mean you know i always say people need to do more things
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:04.640]  for fun because a lot of times they don't take enough time to do things and
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:08.000]  and to relieve their stress levels and right now we're living in such a
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.200]  negative society even though there's a lot of change and i'm always like
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:15.280]  positive positive positive because there's always solutions for every
[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:18.720]  situation um but one of the things that we used
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:22.320]  to do is ask patients when they came in you know what makes you happy and a lot
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:24.800]  of the patients that were sick they came in nothing
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:27.760]  let's say they would say nothing or they would just start crying i didn't know
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:31.440]  you were going to say that but yeah yeah all working no play makes jack a dull
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:36.320]  boy and for like the last 10 years well going back 15 years for about 10 years
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:38.480]  i kind of just got so focused and depressed fighting
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:41.920]  tyranny that i just gained like 80 pounds didn't care
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:45.680]  had no fun worked 14 hours a day not anymore
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:48.880]  i'm going to have a good time in the midst of all this evil i'm not going to
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:52.720]  let them get me down i'll tell you what i've noticed a huge
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:56.400]  difference in my life by taking the super male vitality and just because
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:01.200]  every guy over the age of 30 and i mean the sad thing is you're
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:05.520]  starting to see children and that are you know having
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:09.600]  gender bending qualities and and are becoming
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:13.120]  boys that are becoming feminine because of all the estrogens but
[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:16.480]  the fact and they know what studies that's happening yeah i mean it's not
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:20.800]  like we're making this up the fact is that we are running out of testosterone
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:24.800]  anyway without all the the estrogen mimicry what would you do with a son if
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:28.880]  you had a kind of sickly boy who wasn't you know
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:33.840]  manning up i well what's too young to take your old boy
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:37.200]  and i have a six-year-old boy what's too young to take super male
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:41.200]  uh well i actually give my my boy both of my boys
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:44.880]  super male you know maybe once every couple of weeks or just to just to kind
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:48.800]  of stimulate that testosterone they i don't have any estrogen
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:52.160]  mimicers around but even if you don't have it you're still going to be exposed
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:54.880]  to it if you eat out at any restaurant you're
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:58.320]  going to have endocrine disrupting chemicals because restaurants always use
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:01.920]  tap water to cook with plus they have teflon lined pans
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:05.600]  they had they used gmo oils to to cook with
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:09.360]  so i mean you know you can't live in a bubble either you just have to keep
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:12.400]  yourself clean and avoid as best as you can but

[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:34.320]  what's in that cocktail no there's more and more studies coming out every day i
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:37.680]  mean they're injecting you know scientists are injecting eggs with
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:41.520]  the with phthalates which or fragrances or some of these endocrine
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:44.720]  disrupting chemicals and inside the egg the males
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:49.040]  are turning into females the water supply you know they're they're seeing
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:53.120]  frogs that are hermaphrodite uh frogs there's why are you why are you a
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:55.600]  sexist against hermaphrodite frogs let's not discuss why they're
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:58.800]  having hermaphrodite problems let's just accept it and take the shot to become
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:04.640]  one to prove you're not racist because the frogs are being exposed to
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:09.200]  chemicals which are changing them which leads to these poor children who don't
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:12.720]  know whether they're a male or a female in their mind and then to even have a
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:15.120]  clear sex role is now hurtful to someone else
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:19.280]  we have to get rid of all of it and the social aspect is of course acceptance
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:23.040]  and all that but again they're not addressing the root cause of the
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:26.080]  problem and that's the problem in the united states with the government
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:29.280]  everything nobody addresses the root cause of the financial
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:32.640]  situation we're in nobody addresses the root cause of
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:36.720]  you know why disease exists nobody addresses the root cause of why we're
[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:40.160]  starting wars over in the middle east nobody addresses the root cause of any
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:43.920]  of these issues and the root cause of the way of why
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:48.800]  these children are having thoughts or these male
[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:52.400]  children think they're female or these female children think they're male is
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:56.160]  because of these chemicals and that's not
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:59.920]  and i'm not just well i never thought that proven i never felt like that in my

[02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:58.240]  richard belzer let me ask you a question sure
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:01.680]  why do you think and the republicans are backing the fcc grab the republican
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:05.920]  leadership did so it's bipartisan the borders being gotten rid of
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:11.520]  executive orders um all these other power grabs going on
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:15.680]  government is just i mean the senate committee advanced cyber security bill
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:19.920]  that's basically sopa and sysba together in secret won't let the public
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:25.200]  see the bill uh what's this news i mean this new power grab about about what
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:28.720]  do you think's happening well it's the old story of controlling
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:33.600]  information and uh i you know it's amazing how they
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:38.480]  are selling this uh internet bill as a great thing and it's going to open it
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:41.440]  up and but as you pointed out you know
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:45.680]  once the republicans coming on board and business interests in bed with the
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:48.560]  justice department it's clear that it's kind of a
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:52.160]  mini coup within the government to take over the internet
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:55.200]  while making it look like it's a good thing for the people
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:58.480]  and that's you know you know lincoln said it's possible
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:02.000]  uh to fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.200]  but you can't fool all the people all the time well Alex you can fool all the
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:08.080]  people all the time because the government
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:11.680]  and the press are now in bed together and i just
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:16.320]  was reading today the history of you know post world war two and

[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:37.760]  where every you know and then there's hundreds of
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:41.840]  stories we have we have assets in europe hundreds of them
[02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:47.200]  and the cia feeds them stories to either undermine the local government or
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:51.360]  or you fulfill our agenda but then someone in america sees the story
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:54.880]  and prints it in the american press and the american people take it
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:58.480]  as the truth when in fact it's a lot and it's illegal
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:01.360]  as you're saying to have the cia do that until last year
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:05.840]  but the congress quote legalized without law they just said regulators could do
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:10.800]  this domestic cia propaganda in the u.s so that's why
[02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:13.840]  we're seeing such an intensification of disinformation
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:17.600]  we'll put that article on screen that propaganda that's an important article
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:21.360]  yeah it's amazing this that's what i'm saying why are the
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:25.120]  floodgates of tyranny being opened well i think it's
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:29.280]  they're arrogant it's like you know it's almost like the winter com song you
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:33.440]  know war is over and the good guys lost but there always be good guys and we'll
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:36.480]  never lose you know it's like you know you're at
[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:41.440]  jeffersonian as i am you know it's about he wasn't the farmers and people who
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:45.680]  work with their hands and you know uh government was a gentlemanly
[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:49.520]  thing where you went home every weekend and they had other professions they were
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:52.720]  farmers or whatever it's not like it is today with these
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:57.600]  this kind of malignant greed uh i just want to read a quick quote to you which
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:01.760]  really is telling um when john kennedy wanted
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:06.240]  something to be in the press he would call a new york times writer
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:09.920]  arthur croc so when arthur croc had a piece
[02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:14.720]  he said a highs you know a high source in the white house said so that would be
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:20.240]  kennedy and uh when kennedy in 1963 around september
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:24.720]  kennedy had given orders he was pissed off because the cia went
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:28.240]  beyond its charter and actually started the war in vietnam
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:33.040]  which you know is completely insane you know kennedy wanted to take the cia
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:37.680]  and fold it into the the state department and the defense department
[02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:43.200]  you know generals kind of take over you know he said that um there's a malignant
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:48.000]  see that the white house could not control and this is the quote from kennedy
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:51.920]  if the u.s ever experiences an attempt at the coup to overthrow the government
[02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:55.920]  it will come from the cia and not the pentagon the agency represents a
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:16:00.080]  tremendous power and total unaccountability to anyone
[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:04.720]  six weeks later they exploded his head and you know these
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:08.560]  you know presidents to me the alex are part-time workers
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:11.680]  they come in and they're told okay you can do this and you can do that
[02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:15.520]  but they show them there's a proto-film they say you know you can do what you
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:19.360]  want but if you cross us you know well we'll do what they did to
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:23.200]  well you don't have to kill nixon they just you know ruined him in a different
[02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:26.160]  way you don't have to kill people anymore they can destroy them
[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:29.600]  you know with information that falls information
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:33.760]  i agree where do you think it's all going this arrogance
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:37.680]  it's all going with the right where do you think all this arrogance is leading
[02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:41.680]  us well um it's funny i think today about
[02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:46.400]  ten years ago i was with my friend gordo da we're going to lunch and
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:51.360]  in hollywood and he was really angry got in the car and he said
[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:55.040]  and i don't mean this as a total disrespect because i don't think the
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:58.800]  american people are stupid i think they're ill informed to a degree
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:02.640]  it's not a question of intelligence it's the way information is shaped and
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:06.640]  presented and he said he was amazed that there
[02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:10.080]  wasn't a revolution a literal revolution
[02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:14.240]  the way the government was you know crushing the working class and
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:18.800]  and starting uh senseless wars and you know taking
[02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:23.200]  taxing people to a degree that was uh you know extortion
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:26.320]  and you know and he's no raging maniac he's you know he's one of the smartest
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:30.560]  people i've ever ever met how if i have a question for you
[02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:36.480]  if i may sure um the congress has a 10 percent approval rating
[02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:43.200]  and 94 percent of them are reelected i think i know there's a job in there
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:46.640]  somewhere but i'll tell you what's happening there
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:50.160]  people like their particular congressperson
[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:55.200]  or they just vote along party lines and so the eight to ten percent approval
[02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:59.600]  rating that gallup shows for congress the lowest in history the last six years
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:02.560]  is basically a vote against the government itself
[02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:07.200]  without politicizing a name when it comes to their
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:10.160]  their republican democratic leader but going back to gore vidal who we
[02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:13.120]  interviewed many times including in person he was a very
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:16.000]  very smart person and exposed false flag terror and
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:20.000]  so much more uh but the late gore vidal
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:24.240]  was absolutely right that the american people needed to have a quote revolution
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:27.600]  i don't even so much get mad at them they are in a trance they are being
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:32.320]  brainwashed yes i exactly that's what i'm thinking
[02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:35.600]  you know this this has been going on and so i say they're arrogant i mean they've
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:39.120]  been going this has been going on for decades
[02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:43.920]  alex and they just keep floating different things that some of them work
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:47.440]  some of them don't and you're talking about um
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:52.320]  eddie bernay's a while back the inventor of public relations
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:58.160]  uh do you know why he was hired initially uh because it was a mining
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:01.520]  disaster that the that the rockefellers owned
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:05.120]  and women and children were slaughtered by the
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:08.000]  the so-called national guard which is really working for the rockefellers
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:12.960]  the miners were striking for just decent pay and safety conditions that was in
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:16.240]  colorado wasn't it no i think it was in illinois there were a
[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:18.640]  bunch of those there where the rockefellers had whole
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:21.920]  mining towns mowed down oh the illinois one yeah that's right
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:25.200]  yeah that's the most and so the eddie bernay's came in and said
[02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:29.440]  and helped them spin it and say that all the people died because a stove
[02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:32.720]  tipped over and and so that was the beginning and this
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:36.480]  there was a guy who worked for the rockefellers his name escapes me now
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:40.480]  but he said look you guys have a hundred and this isn't the teens
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:43.840]  alex you guys have a hundred million dollars
[02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:47.440]  there and the word public relations wasn't around hold on stay there tell us

[02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:17.120]  Richard Belzer is our guest we were just talking about the arrogance of
[02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:21.360]  government and corporations intensifying
[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:24.400]  but the ether in which all this corruption grows is that we do have an
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:27.040]  industrial society there's more food there's more
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:29.920]  diversions there's more of a dumb down population
[02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:34.080]  some of that's our own doing and so as we become corrupt and decadent
[02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:37.760]  the elites are given a very very long leash
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:40.720]  and they're attempting to put us on a leash now a police state
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:45.600]  to protect themselves and that's where this whole situation's going but
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:49.520]  you were getting into Edward Bernays and some of the propagandists
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:53.360]  there were Rockefeller exterminations in New Jersey Illinois
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:56.720]  Colorado I mean used to they just sit in Pinkerton security
[02:24:56.720 --> 02:25:00.240]  or the army and they would just mow down whole whole groups of people that
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:03.120]  didn't you know families yeah ride them down with horses you
[02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:06.560]  name it kind of like the bonus marchers at the end of world war one but to go
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:09.840]  ahead and break that down well you know um you were talking
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:14.240]  about women's health before and uh Eddie Bernon the tobacco
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:17.680]  industry was his client and they wanted to figure out how to sell
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:20.640]  cigarettes to women because it was you know it wasn't
[02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:25.360]  cool for women to smoke in the early 20s or late teen it was early 20s
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:29.840]  so Bernays got a bunch of dead mutants and girls
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:33.200]  college girls whatever to go to Times Square
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:37.040]  and light up a cigarette and they call the torches of freedom
[02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:40.640]  and they likened it to women the women's equality
[02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:44.800]  so it's like the women's movement started with cancer
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:48.000]  I mean millions of women have gotten you know
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:52.240]  emphysema and lung cancer because Eddie Bernays and the tobacco industry
[02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:55.040]  glamorized cigarettes and made them a symbol
[02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:58.320]  they're calling torches of freedom and torches of death
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:01.680]  well Richard that's a microcosm of everything the globalists do
[02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:06.800]  they take legitimate civil rights movements cultural movements you name it
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:12.160]  and then they attach their people to it to then Pied Piper lead the group
[02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:16.560]  when what they really want to do is enslave them and that's why the CIA
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:21.200]  founded Miss Magazine and Gloria Steinemann record not to empower women
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:25.600]  but to break up families by the way you know that absolutely CIA
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:30.480]  and that's declassified so so how do we navigate something like this
[02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:34.320]  well you know I think thank god you know
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:38.080]  for you and my people with George Norrie and others who are open
[02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:41.760]  to these ideas and the thing is that millions of people
[02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:45.920]  are with us Alex and it's just that you don't see it on the front page of
[02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:50.720]  the corporate press because they're terrified of people getting information
[02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:55.040]  that's why they try to doctor information but you know 1984 goes
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:58.640]  both ways Alex they can watch us but now we're watching them
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:02.160]  and we can expose things sooner than ever before
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:04.880]  and just keep hitting the nail on the head I mean
[02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:08.240]  it's like the myth of Sisyphus you know he rolled the rock up
[02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:11.520]  to the top of the hill only for it to fall down the other side
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:14.800]  but in his mind it was the triumph of getting the rock
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:18.960]  up there not the futility of it I don't want to get too esoteric but
[02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:22.960]  I think there's a lot of brave smart people in America with
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:27.360]  big hearts who are angry confused and misinformed
[02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:32.720]  and you know we got to stick together and the thing in
[02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:38.560]  in the shooting of those police officers you know
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:44.480]  this is a class you remember Operation Paperclip where we imported Nazis
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:48.080]  part of those part of those Nazis that we
[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:54.400]  you know got out of Nuremberg were propaganda experts and they
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:59.200]  counseled people in our government to keep racial strife going
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:02.560]  because when you divide people you can control them better
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:05.840]  race relations could have probably gotten along
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:10.320]  much quicker than they have and there's still clear serious problems
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:14.400]  but there's there are forces at work that that keep this in play
[02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:18.400]  and that just kills me it breaks my heart that you know they would set
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:22.720]  one against the other when we're all we're all under this umbrella of
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:26.400]  oppression and yet we're fighting each other instead of the umbrella
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:30.240]  and I guess that's why we have George Soros the admitted Nazi collaborator
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:34.400]  funding 30 not true by the way it is unwitting that
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:39.120]  I mean you can criticize them but that's not a fair accusation I studied this
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:43.520]  quite deeply well I wanted to make that with you because because I saw him on
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:47.280]  60 minutes say that he's not ashamed of what he did because it helped him
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:50.800]  survive and that he'd have been killed if he didn't help round up people
[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:53.840]  well I mean if somebody stuck a gun to my head to set round up people I'd say
[02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:58.160]  pull the trigger well yeah you have a point
[02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:00.880]  you have a point I mean see that's all that's so
[02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:04.560]  happened he was a kid he was a little kid yeah he was like 14
[02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:07.520]  yeah well you could be terrified when you're 14 but
[02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:10.880]  you and I have much more fruitful things to discuss no no I hear you but then
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:14.320]  why would George Soros the guy that funds so much to the left wing
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:18.240]  why would he the fake left wing the like ever bernays led the fake women's
[02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:21.600]  movement to control it why then would he spend 30 plus
[02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:25.200]  million dollars help stir up the Ferguson stuff because it's a distraction
[02:29:25.200 --> 02:29:29.280]  from the fact that Obama has spending the money on Alex do what sir
[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:33.920]  what's up where's that money going it's going to just foam it and stir stuff up
[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:36.880]  I don't want to go too far with it but let's get your comment on Soros the
[02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:39.760]  other side then let's shift gears into the big mystery
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:43.200]  someone is hiding something the new book by Richard Belzer George Norrie and

[02:33:15.280 --> 02:33:17.920]  by the way i was just talking to richard belzer during the break he was not
[02:33:17.920 --> 02:33:22.240]  being an apologist for uh George soros he was just sick of all the divide and
[02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:25.680]  conquer stuff he was mentioning to me and i've forgotten this the report last
[02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:29.040]  year on extremist by the southern poverty law center
[02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:33.040]  that's really discredited its mandate and they had myself or richard belzer in
[02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:35.840]  there is extremist with a huge swastika above us
[02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:39.280]  they and they mail these out to prominent people my dad gets them in the
[02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:44.160]  mail uh magazine and there it is uh southern poverty
[02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:48.400]  law center richard belzer uh and then in the print edition they had a
[02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:52.000]  swastika on the page of course belzer's jewish and
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:55.920]  but he was we were mentioning cross the comedian put out a movie
[02:33:55.920 --> 02:33:59.200]  where they have a guy and they're saying i hate black people and jews i learned
[02:33:59.200 --> 02:34:02.800]  it from alex jones and belzer had some words to say about that so
[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:05.120]  so that i mean they're definitely trying to get everybody fighting with each
[02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:07.840]  other what do you think's going on here
[02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:11.840]  uh i mean they had us right next to each other in the southern poverty law
[02:34:11.840 --> 02:34:15.680]  center what do you make of this well i think that you know
[02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:21.760]  this has been as you know as well as anyone marginalized people that question
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:26.880]  the status quo marginalize them you know when fascists come in and take over a
[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:30.480]  country they kill the professors the artists the students you know what i
[02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:34.000]  mean they there's a thing that's well known
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:39.520]  in the fascist circles is that uh you have to kill all the smart people first
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:43.040]  and then you can control things so the fact that you
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:48.800]  you know are so incendiary and you know 90 percent of what you say
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:53.440]  as you say your research is impeccable so even if you disagree
[02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:57.680]  how do you disagree with the truth so you know there's been a lot of psychological
[02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:00.480]  tests about people who when they're presented with something
[02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:04.560]  that threatens their their perception of the world they get very defensive and
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:06.880]  they lash out and they don't try to reason
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:10.000]  and i think a lot of that is going on i think the government is smart enough to
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:13.360]  know about what parts of the brain literally
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:16.560]  can be triggered to make people either submissive
[02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:20.720]  or contentious or distrust another ethnic group i mean
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:23.920]  they're playing you know they're playing people like a record
[02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:28.080]  and you know so you and i and others not not that i'm in your company but oh
[02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:30.960]  you're doing a great job and that's why they put us together
[02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:34.880]  in this report of 50 people next to david duke and all the rest of these folks
[02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:39.520]  because because we dare they say we dare question the kennedy assassination
[02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:42.320]  i mean in national polls upwards of 90 percent
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:45.600]  don't believe the official story are 90 percent nazis
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:49.040]  yeah i mean you write books exposing the nazis
[02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:52.960]  and and so you're now a nazi i mean this is or you're now in with nazis this is
[02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:56.240]  crazy it is it is crazy and uh you know
[02:35:56.240 --> 02:35:59.840]  90 percent of people believe that kennedy was killed by conspiracy the other
[02:35:59.840 --> 02:36:02.800]  10 percent worked for the press of the government
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:06.160]  exactly so i mean i think it's a badge of honor
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:09.280]  and i think they've overused this race card stuff so much
[02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:12.960]  that it's disgusting it doesn't work anymore my problem is
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:16.080]  now what they're legitimate really hateful people out there who deserve to
[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:19.360]  be criticized now it actually gives them cover
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:23.040]  because the adl and southern probably lost center just attack all these innocent
[02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:26.480]  people yeah and you know i was stopped in the
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:29.920]  street in new york by someone a well-dressed gentleman
[02:36:29.920 --> 02:36:33.040]  and said i saw that article you know it's like you know
[02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:38.160]  can be a break that's like you did something wrong to question
[02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:41.520]  kennedy assassination so now you're mixed in with neo nazis
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:44.880]  yeah exactly i mean there's not even any logic to it
[02:36:44.880 --> 02:36:48.160]  but they keep selling this stuff out there you know like this warrant error
[02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:52.320]  this is a joke i just read that a top member of the jihadist group
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:56.640]  that the government and nato armed and funded and the overthrow of qaddafi now
[02:36:56.640 --> 02:37:01.120]  he is in charge of the isis that's right that's right somebody we created
[02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:04.720]  is now in charge that's an admitted fact and now they say that they're in the
[02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:08.320]  caribbean it may come up here and when stuff gets blown up god forbid
[02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:12.000]  then they'll take more of our liberties and poses savers it's really simple
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:16.080]  let's get into your book something up and blame
[02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:20.400]  them exactly either or it's still a false flag from exactly
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:23.760]  someone is hiding something what happened to malaysian airlines flight
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:28.400]  370 you've got maps you've got graphs you work with george norrie and
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:31.840]  david wane on this new york times best-selling authors

[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:41.840]  well brother you're tell us about the book i mean let's go to the highlights
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:46.720]  of it and why it's so important well you know it's an incredible mystery
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:50.400]  that once again it's an event where they insult the
[02:37:50.400 --> 02:37:54.400]  intelligence of everyone and put out their version
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:58.960]  you know of what they think it should be and there's so many things about it
[02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:03.760]  you know first of all a plane that size has a million pieces to it
[02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:08.800]  and people wonder you know can a plane totally disappear
[02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:12.320]  in this day and age can it be lost and the answer is no
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:16.560]  there are way too many systems that work you know even the backup systems have
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:20.560]  backup systems military radar would have picked up the flight if it was still
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:23.920]  airborne the black boxes have transmitters
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:29.200]  and another thing that i don't see much in the press but in our book about
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:32.560]  military operations going on in the area is that sound familiar
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:36.800]  oh where you know during a military operation
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:42.800]  there had been accidental shootdowns as you know twa flight 800s open and shut
[02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:47.760]  yes and and you know 9-11 there was a big um
[02:38:47.760 --> 02:38:52.640]  operation going on uh remember the guy said is this real or
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:56.560]  remember when they yeah is this real a part of the ongoing simulation
[02:38:56.560 --> 02:39:00.400]  yes and that's how they've done that before they did it in england with the
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:04.880]  train with you know with that train where they had they were doing a
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:09.760]  a test of the exact trains and the exact bus at the exact time and then they
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:13.360]  admitted on the bbc that they ran the drill with scotland yard at the same
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:16.960]  time impossible yeah and they just that's why i
[02:39:16.960 --> 02:39:21.920]  say it's so insulting and you know on the on the plane uh there were men
[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:25.840]  speaking of the twin towers you know the patronis towers
[02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:31.440]  there was a uh in kuala lumpur there was a feeling that that plane was hijacked to
[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:37.600]  go hit that like um like the twin towers
[02:39:37.600 --> 02:39:41.760]  well i don't know uh you you've researched this
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:45.360]  in depth my listeners are always asking my opinion of it somebody think it was
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:49.920]  diverted to diego garcia or shot down
[02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:57.440]  is that a parrot in the background or is that dogs fighting
[02:39:57.440 --> 02:40:00.720]  it's kind of like what is it is it five dogs i'm sorry no it's all right i know
[02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:05.120]  how it is i've got dogs as well oh my god deanie
[02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:11.520]  are you okay honey oh no oh my god and not on a daddy
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:15.680]  oh the one of the dog wise wine that's the biggest crime in this house
[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:21.920]  anyway also um the plane was near uh diego garcia which is you know bigger
[02:40:21.920 --> 02:40:26.160]  than area 51 and that's where they rendered people
[02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:30.480]  and there's submarine bases there and if there was a plane missing
[02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:33.920]  you know they'd send up something to check it out right
[02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:36.800]  so let me ask you this question from all the different theories that you cover
[02:40:36.800 --> 02:40:41.440]  in the book go over some of the main theories and then what you think happened
[02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:48.560]  well um you know the the pilot was simulating landing at
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:53.040]  diego garcia in his home on his computer he raced it but they retrieved it that's
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:56.720]  very very suspicious some experts say there were
[02:40:56.720 --> 02:41:00.800]  there could have been a fire on board which killed everyone
[02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:04.240]  but the plane would have still been flying on a sound till it ran out of
[02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:07.760]  fuel um what about a brain heist because there was a
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:12.240]  bunch of people on board right a what a brain heist a bunch of
[02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:15.520]  scientists were on board could have been a brain heist of some type of government
[02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:19.040]  yeah i know that's a good point there were like i think 14 people that were
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:23.120]  experts in this device to use by the military that was
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:27.440]  you know very very valuable and they had
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:31.280]  between them the brain trust you know had all the knowledge
[02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:34.880]  of what this device did and you know they're blown out
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:37.920]  some people think that the plane actually landed and then
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:41.440]  was overtaken because if it was hijacked it would have to
[02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:46.160]  refueled and we would know where it is you know i think they knew
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:51.760]  and also they sent the the searchers in the wrong direction
[02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:56.720]  knowingly so that's very strange my feeling is that
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:03.760]  um if i had to be pushed on it i'd say the plane was commandeered
[02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:07.840]  because we know that you can hijack a plane from the ground
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:12.800]  been able to do that for a long time uh they killed my friend by hijacking his
[02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:17.200]  Mercedes and smashing it to a tree remember hasty yes so they can hijack
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:22.080]  these planes from the ground i think they probably landed it at that base
[02:42:22.080 --> 02:42:25.760]  and uh like you say commandeer the brain trust and
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:31.200]  you keep that plane there for future use that's my that's my theory i don't you
[02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:35.040]  know well that's my theory and i haven't even read your book yet
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:39.360]  that it was it was diverted the pilot was involved the double agent they told
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:42.400]  him the plane i have been involved but he could have been
[02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:45.280]  well i'm not saying he was i'm saying he could have been involved since that was
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:48.160]  on his home computer and then they basically tell everybody the
[02:42:48.160 --> 02:42:51.360]  planesman hijacked it lands and then they basically take everybody into
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:54.720]  custody black bag them because we know under under operation north was they
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:58.480]  talk about putting you know uh cia people with fake names on board aircraft
[02:42:58.480 --> 02:43:03.040]  diverting it crashing another one i mean they've done stuff like this before
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:06.800]  that's right and there are two guys on the plane who's had fake passports and
[02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:10.640]  they said oh no don't worry about it yeah just like to happen with the
[02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:15.120]  underwear bomber let me ask you this what do you make of its sister plane same
[02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:18.960]  make model being only gets shot down over russia and then another plane out of
[02:43:18.960 --> 02:43:22.320]  malaysia goes down i mean there's hundreds of different airlines in the
[02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:26.480]  world hundreds of air forces what's going on with these malaysian airlines
[02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:30.640]  yeah the odds of that there are people that make a connection between the two
[02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:34.080]  flights there's some serious you know writers that i've that we've looked at
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:38.160]  and we talk about in the book that the state is a definite connection between
[02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:42.640]  the two aircraft but um i'm at a loss as to know
[02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:47.920]  i'm just fearful that the one of them are that one uh is going to be used for
[02:43:47.920 --> 02:43:54.160]  something that's my fear that aircraft that you know is at that base i don't
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:59.360]  know for what but north witz comes to mind
[02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:03.360]  well i tell you it's an important book people really obsess over this and i'm
[02:44:03.360 --> 02:44:05.680]  glad you've written a book about it because if they can just start
[02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:10.160]  disappearing airplanes i know one of the theories uh is that it could have been
[02:44:10.160 --> 02:44:13.760]  a dimensional time warp i don't get into that stuff but could have been space
[02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:17.040]  aliens i mean i mean i think it's a lot easier to believe that it was
[02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:21.760]  diverted to diego garcia um because this is an area of the world pretty much in
[02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:26.800]  control of the us what do you say i mean there there's a chapter on uh
[02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:32.160]  other dimensions because you know there are people who seriously
[02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:35.520]  and get into that stuff i know it's been laughed out of the room but
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:39.280]  uh i mean i don't think it was an interdimensional event but i you know i
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:44.400]  wouldn't be shocked if it was well i wonder if nothing surprises me
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:50.640]  i wonder if the if the uh southern poverty loss center
[02:44:50.640 --> 02:44:54.400]  will attack you or george norray for daring
[02:44:54.400 --> 02:44:57.760]  to write a book questioning what happened to the plane because it appears
[02:44:57.760 --> 02:45:01.920]  being a conspiracy theory just means you question mysteries or you don't
[02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:06.560]  believe known liars what do you make of the conspiracy theory uh labeled
[02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:11.120]  well it's another way of marginalizing you know the the founding of this
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:17.280]  country was a conspiracy i mean it's just you know it means to breathe
[02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:19.840]  together two people have an idea and they do
[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:24.080]  it's it's been so marginalized and it's so jokingly
[02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:28.800]  still to this day you know very smart people that i know
[02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:33.760]  just you know scoff and raise their eyebrows and a lot of this stuff and
[02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:37.360]  that's another thing that fascinates me about the way people's brains work
[02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:41.920]  and what highly intelligent people cannot accept reality
[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:48.240]  you know that's really disturbing it's like uh i've had discussions with
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:52.320]  really i mean i don't drop any names but you know some of the brightest people
[02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:57.520]  in the world who won't believe some basic facts even when they're laid out to
[02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:00.160]  them so that's not so to me it's nothing to do with
[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:03.760]  intelligence it's an emotional level that the government
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:07.920]  somehow figured out how to play that string and make us fearful
[02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:11.520]  et cetera well take vivian kubrick you know hadn't done but like two interviews
[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:14.960]  in 15 years she's a listener we've interviewed her on radio and in person
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:17.680]  stanley kubrick's daughter who was his protege you know
[02:46:17.680 --> 02:46:22.400]  a connoisseur he was a genius absolutely they made a joke about general jack
[02:46:22.400 --> 02:46:25.760]  t ripper not wanting fluoridation but i've talked to her she knows fluoride's
[02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:28.720]  bad what are they going to do as newsweek the
[02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:32.080]  london guardian the british medical science you know
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:35.760]  government admit okay fluoride's brain damaging people causing thyroid
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:39.600]  problems and obesity that's the classic kook thing
[02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:46.080]  that's being admitted now uh precious bodily fluids mandrake exactly
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:50.320]  there's plans to even fluoridate ice cream mandrake yeah i remember when it
[02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:55.200]  when they started this is how old i am when when fluoridation came in
[02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:59.120]  and there was you know people were were terrified of it because they thought it
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:03.680]  was communist or something but you know as you know better than anyone
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:08.320]  fluoride is a waste material that he couldn't figure out what to do with it
[02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:12.240]  and it does affect you know brains of people and
[02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:14.960]  it's you know all the things that you pointed out that's another thing i
[02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:18.320]  appreciate what you do about health issues because
[02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:21.680]  you know people are inundated with commercials on television for products
[02:47:21.680 --> 02:47:25.200]  that'll kill them well i mean i got really unhealthy
[02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:28.960]  about 10 years ago from not caring that's why i researched it more and
[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:31.680]  wasn't even following my own advice i've gotten a little bit healthier a lot
[02:47:31.680 --> 02:47:34.320]  healthier getting away from some of this stuff pretty good
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:37.680]  oh your sweetheart you know i want to ask you this question because the article
[02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:41.120]  just went up on info wars.com it's got my video from the first
[02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:45.200]  part of the show where i break it down we need this to go mega viral folks the
[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:49.920]  FCC held back their regulations for two weeks and one day so that they could
[02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:51.840]  put out the lie they were protecting the web
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:55.520]  i've been under FCC regulation for 20 years being a talk show host i've had to
[02:47:55.520 --> 02:47:59.200]  go to legal seminars i've seen FCC complaints come in
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:02.640]  i've had them done on me i've been on howard's turn you know what he's been
[02:48:02.640 --> 02:48:07.280]  through regardless they use it to tax and control and only give big corporations
[02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:11.040]  the airwaves big corporations couldn't take over the web
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:14.240]  so they had the FCC
[02:48:14.240 --> 02:48:20.800]  they had the FCC basically come in claiming to protect it and grab it
[02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:24.160]  now they're gonna have a big legal fight the corporations will write the new regs
[02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:28.400]  but they say they're gonna apply the stuff they've done with television
[02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:33.280]  on to cable internet now with criminal enforcement so i'm here to tell you
[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:36.960]  what does that mean criminal enforcement alex it means they're going to use their
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:40.720]  FCC offices and the and referral to the justice department
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:45.040]  under the FCC i mean i i went over the subsections in the first hour
[02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:50.400]  which nobody else is doing this is really bad the article is on info wars.com
[02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:55.440]  and prisonplanet.com right now what do you make of this whole debate in general
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:48:59.360]  well you know this is the orwellian nightmare that we've all
[02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:03.200]  it's just another not i want to say incremental because it's a big step it
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:07.440]  just another way of controlling information
[02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:11.920]  and um you know it's chilling because it's being sold on the guys of all the
[02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:16.240]  internet it's going to be okay now you know that's what i mean about how they
[02:49:16.240 --> 02:49:21.120]  how they sculpt reality and make it make it palatable to people when it's
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:25.760]  really against their best interest which is another thing that fascinates me how
[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:29.680]  people will vote against their own best interest because of some
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:34.880]  social issue. Well i tell you people better get on this
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:38.480]  issue you know it's super technical uh kit did a great
[02:49:38.480 --> 02:49:41.840]  job writing this article fast off my notes and off the documents but he has
[02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:46.640]  headline FCC to cease cable tv radio and broadband that would be internet radio
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:50.160]  that's the headline yes but i mean that's a good headline
[02:49:50.160 --> 02:49:54.480]  yeah but i really think you know it's official FCC to cease entire
[02:49:54.480 --> 02:50:00.240]  internet cable spectrum uh apply broadcast rules to the web
[02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:04.960]  so they're going to further control the issuance of licenses and what is allowed
[02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:09.040]  to be said and done on the air exactly what mark cuban warned of a few weeks

[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:27.440]  someone is hiding something what happened to malaysian airlines flight

[02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:37.520]  uh... you'd like to add uh... richard concerning the flight
[02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:41.520]  uh... well if the powers that they seem to be a lot more comfortable with
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:44.160]  disclosing the door and moving on
[02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:48.240]  you know whatever their plans are on the whole geopolitical test game but
[02:55:48.240 --> 02:55:51.600]  we get glimpses of the truth but really the whole story i think
[02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:56.640]  that's why you know people would be to be a citizen that you have to kind of work
[02:55:56.640 --> 02:56:02.560]  at getting full disclosure uh... and finding out what's really going on
[02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:07.120]  i would say uh... every newspaper headline in the corporate press
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:10.640]  is suspect and that every threat
[02:56:10.640 --> 02:56:14.400]  should be looked at and uh... not immediately
[02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:17.760]  be uh... you know relent to the fear factor
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:21.760]  and know that the agenda of the ruler in class so-called
[02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:26.880]  is to keep us at each other's throats and to control what information we get
[02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:30.480]  so the better we get along and the more we learn
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:34.400]  uh... we can live up to the jeffersonian ideal
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:38.000]  well i love the jeffersonian ideal it's true freedom
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:41.760]  it's true capitalism what we have now uh...
[02:56:41.760 --> 02:56:46.400]  capitalism of social justice is a hijack liberal and conservative movements
[02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:50.240]  creating kind of a synthetic system that just lets things get more and more
[02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:53.440]  consolidated and they see our individuality

[03:00:10.480 --> 03:00:15.760]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central we're here we're now in
[03:00:15.760 --> 03:00:19.120]  overdrive i can spend an hour on this piece the
[03:00:19.120 --> 03:00:22.640]  video is up on info wars.com and from kids perspective
[03:00:22.640 --> 03:00:26.800]  writing from info wars.com it's funny how stupid they are
[03:00:26.800 --> 03:00:31.040]  going yeah we want guns from areas where you can legally get them because
[03:00:31.040 --> 03:00:34.000]  we're criminals we want to go kill people in our states
[03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:37.600]  it's the areas that have less gun laws that have lower crime on record
[03:00:37.600 --> 03:00:40.080]  it's the areas that have the gun bans that have the highest crime rate
[03:00:40.080 --> 03:00:42.800]  the criminals come into the areas where people are
[03:00:42.800 --> 03:00:46.320]  disarmed and that's where they engage in their predator activity
[03:00:46.320 --> 03:00:49.440]  so from kids perspective this is really stupid and looks ridiculous
[03:00:49.440 --> 03:00:52.880]  remember they're targeting jello heads that have grown up in front of
[03:00:52.880 --> 03:00:56.160]  television who don't even know how to tie their shoelaces and are scared of
[03:00:56.160 --> 03:00:59.680]  everything the opposite of skinnabuck run a
[03:00:59.680 --> 03:01:03.040]  trotliner go get you know deep-sea fishing and 15 foot waves
[03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:07.760]  i mean these people are just jellyfish they all have their own bodyguards
[03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:10.720]  basically out in hollywood they don't want you to have them so yeah you can
[03:01:10.720 --> 03:01:15.120]  laugh at the stupid video but you have to understand
[03:01:15.120 --> 03:01:18.400]  it's like laughing at obama saying that two plus two equals five
[03:01:18.400 --> 03:01:24.160]  they got people that believe it okay and remember we're eating what michelle
[03:01:24.160 --> 03:01:27.600]  obama says in schools nationwide so they're in control
[03:01:27.600 --> 03:01:30.640]  and they get to tell us that the world's flat if they want to
[03:01:30.640 --> 03:01:34.480]  because they're trendies and this was funded by the brady campaign funding
[03:01:34.480 --> 03:01:39.280]  funny or die which has done some funny videos uh here is the disinformation
[03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:41.600]  video
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:45.840]  that's kind of like when they throw the millennium falcon in gear and it goes
[03:01:47.840 --> 03:01:52.000]  there it is funny or die before now it's been difficult for criminals like us
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:55.360]  to know which states have loose gun laws how would a criminal like me
[03:01:55.360 --> 03:01:59.040]  know which states permit me to carry loaded guns in their amusement park
[03:01:59.040 --> 03:02:02.880]  golf courses or beaches a criminal
[03:02:02.880 --> 03:02:06.240]  isn't going to care about the gun laws dummy
[03:02:06.240 --> 03:02:11.920]  that's why they're criminals uh let's go back to the mindlessness no logic here
[03:02:11.920 --> 03:02:15.360]  just just just pure idiocy but that's their audience
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:19.040]  you've seen the mark dice interviews with people that can't tie their shoelaces
[03:02:19.040 --> 03:02:22.400]  and think hitler's goat or whatever or if they say lock up all the gun owners
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:26.080]  this is who they're preying on these people know they're preying on their

[03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:50.720]  let's go back to the clip sergeant reverie says what he witnessed
[03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:54.800]  i guess i'm not meant to play this clip today because the computer

[03:03:18.720 --> 03:03:22.720]  leather jackets and scream at women and we want to find out which states we can
[03:03:22.720 --> 03:03:27.200]  buy and sell guns easily crimadvisor.com that's the site to
[03:03:27.200 --> 03:03:30.880]  find out where it's easiest for felons and fugitives to buy carry and even
[03:03:30.880 --> 03:03:33.760]  traffic guns that's why i love arizona where i
[03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:38.000]  can go see the beautiful grand canyon and carry a loaded gun without even
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:41.760]  having to get a background check you would fail that background check
[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:45.920]  i'm sure of it now what about a road trip what states can i go to to fill my
[03:03:45.920 --> 03:03:49.760]  trunk with guns and take it back home for my even more dangerous friends
[03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:54.640]  crimadvisor has a list for that that's so unreasonable our traffickers top 10
[03:03:54.640 --> 03:03:59.280]  nevada what happens in vegas may have to stay in vegas but your guns don't
[03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:03.520]  bring them over to california and sell them the market up there no that's not
[03:04:03.520 --> 03:04:06.960]  true you've restricted guns there i understand the crimadvisor.com will tell
[03:04:06.960 --> 03:04:10.800]  me which states really cater to us criminals something i always do is they
[03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:14.560]  always aim guns at their faces and do stupid stuff with them as if legal
[03:04:14.560 --> 03:04:17.760]  gun owners do that i mean this is just unbelievable
[03:04:17.760 --> 03:04:21.520]  propaganda let's go back to the final bit but what about the states where we're
[03:04:21.520 --> 03:04:25.600]  not so welcome the ones that don't get us i don't even like saying the name of
[03:04:25.600 --> 03:04:29.760]  these states but california connecticut maryland and new york
[03:04:29.760 --> 03:04:32.960]  all have laws to keep guns out of the hands of people like us and they still
[03:04:32.960 --> 03:04:35.680]  have mass shootings in them for you so bad
[03:04:35.680 --> 03:04:39.520]  boo california i'm gonna shoot a piece on this for the nightly news wow
