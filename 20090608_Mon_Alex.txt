[00:31.000 --> 00:37.440]  studio in the last hour former treasury agent who resigned when he found out the
[00:37.440 --> 00:42.520]  IRS is a collection agency for private offshore banks I was the first to
[00:42.520 --> 00:48.880]  interview him back in the late 1990s while I was in Oakland California
[00:48.880 --> 00:52.960]  covering Operation Urban Warrior where the Marines and foreign troops were
[00:52.960 --> 00:56.320]  doing drills practicing the takeover of the United States and gun
[00:56.320 --> 01:00.760]  confiscation in my film police state 2000 while we were there we went on
[01:00.760 --> 01:03.760]  interview Joe banister because I'd heard from some writers that were about to do
[01:03.760 --> 01:07.680]  cover stories on him that he was about to resign and go public by the time I
[01:07.680 --> 01:12.880]  talked to him he had resigned we'll talk to him now again for the second time in
[01:12.880 --> 01:17.560]  person I've interviewed him many times via the telephone here in studio in
[01:17.560 --> 01:22.040]  austin texas he's going to be up in an event in Dallas over the weekend coming
[01:22.040 --> 01:26.960]  up got a chance to see him and his son over here at the office last night while
[01:26.960 --> 01:35.200]  I was doing some work great to see him so that is coming up today JT coyote
[01:35.200 --> 01:43.080]  real name I guess Jack Travis nice fella that's his handle on the web he got
[01:43.080 --> 01:49.080]  rated by the DEA and I want to have him on because this illustrates
[01:49.080 --> 01:58.520]  carpet cleaners realtors plumbers I've had a lot of friends and neighbors and
[01:58.520 --> 02:05.400]  even cousins rated a lot of old ladies get rated my grandmother didn't get
[02:05.400 --> 02:11.760]  rated but she would be rated today she was always growing orchids and lilies
[02:11.760 --> 02:16.560]  and she'd have a little grow light back in the back of her house and she'd move
[02:16.560 --> 02:20.840]  the plants in and outdoors she was an expert at it I don't know exactly what
[02:20.840 --> 02:26.000]  she was doing the point is that people will walk in and see plants with blue
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.520]  flowers that look nothing like marijuana and SWAT teams hit you and hit your heart
[02:30.520 --> 02:38.240]  now JTJT coyote was doing reloading and they put in the police report the
[02:38.240 --> 02:42.920]  police warrant report that well they saw firearms and so that meant he was a
[02:42.920 --> 02:47.480]  meth dealer they hit him hit him hard would have hit him a lot harder but the
[02:47.480 --> 02:51.680]  sheriff came and warned him beforehand so that's coming up an hour and a half
[02:51.680 --> 02:56.000]  but and I want you understand folks these big plumbing companies and these
[02:56.000 --> 03:02.000]  pizza companies and carpet cleaning companies many of them filing in their
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.880]  federal taxes we read mainstream news reports on this they make more money off
[03:06.880 --> 03:12.800]  of ratting on you than they do off their job just like I saw a 60 minutes
[03:12.800 --> 03:19.120]  report a decade ago about people at airports who were getting $30,000 a
[03:19.120 --> 03:23.160]  year for being a ticket teller but one lady made a hundred thousand in one
[03:23.160 --> 03:28.800]  year alone just on bounties and fines and fees and percentages on people she
[03:28.800 --> 03:32.200]  turned in somebody you know they see you pull out a lot of cash try this for
[03:32.200 --> 03:36.480]  yourself walk up with a wallet with $2,000 in it try to pay for a ticket

[04:20.040 --> 04:28.960]  and the subpoenas had gag orders in them obviously a subpoena puts you under
[04:28.960 --> 04:32.320]  gag order but I still went on air and said I don't know what they're here for
[04:32.320 --> 04:35.800]  but the FBI is there and I'm not allowed to talk about it under penalty of federal
[04:35.800 --> 04:41.920]  perjury people like oh you're a liar you're you're making it up alex just

[08:31.400 --> 08:36.200]  more into eugenics a lot of news in the mainstream media about that as they push
[08:36.200 --> 08:40.840]  their agenda as county city states inside the u.s. announced carbon taxes
[08:40.840 --> 08:46.000]  carbon regulators home inspections all the hell but the club of Rome UN and
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.360]  CFR have promised to bring in they're doing mainstream news is now
[08:49.360 --> 08:54.120]  announcing all over the place with newscasts that over spraying the
[08:54.120 --> 08:58.280]  atmosphere to save you from the sun's rays and global warming they're now
[08:58.280 --> 09:02.680]  just admitting chemtrailing is real because we've exposed it those of you
[09:02.680 --> 09:06.360]  out there and by the way we're very close to getting an haste on the show
[09:06.360 --> 09:10.440]  they are listeners of the show they do have this new movie that's premiered in
[09:10.440 --> 09:14.680]  Australia about chemtrails and we're gonna get the director and her on here
[09:14.680 --> 09:18.200]  in the next few weeks they want to the next month or so when that coincides
[09:18.200 --> 09:24.640]  with the release here in the United States of what toxic skies so that is
[09:24.640 --> 09:32.240]  coming up as well it's just crazy but I'm gonna cover this first I have had
[09:32.240 --> 09:36.200]  the Secret Service here twice and then calls from the Secret Service another
[09:36.200 --> 09:44.960]  time we've dealt with the FBI twice and when FBI agent delivers you into your
[09:44.960 --> 09:49.680]  hands a federal subpoena and points out that you're not allowed to talk about it
[09:49.680 --> 09:55.000]  in the subpoena that is the the contents of the subpoena I called my lawyers up
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.080]  and they said well you can talk about how you were subpoenaed and you don't
[09:58.080 --> 10:01.640]  know why you were subpoenaed but you can't talk about what's in it unless you
[10:01.640 --> 10:08.160]  want to challenge a federal contempt of court and then Alex goes bye-bye for
[10:08.160 --> 10:13.440]  several years in prison can you imagine what it's like to have the FBI and
[10:13.440 --> 10:17.000]  Secret Service at your office can you imagine what it's like to have them
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.680]  there and then they won't tell you why they're there just that you've got to
[10:21.680 --> 10:31.360]  give them this material but the subpoena was proper it was very specific and I
[10:31.360 --> 10:35.880]  go on air and I tell people I say the FBI's been here the Secret Service has
[10:35.880 --> 10:42.040]  been here and all these YouTube videos get made all these phone calls all these
[10:42.040 --> 10:44.760]  mean emails oh you liar publicity stunt your piece of
[10:44.760 --> 10:50.880]  filth you know oh big stunt this was happening of four days before I was
[10:50.880 --> 10:55.640]  about to release the Obama deception and the FBI agent one of them was asking my
[10:55.640 --> 11:00.640]  employees so tell me about the Obama deception tell me about Alex's company
[11:00.640 --> 11:04.360]  tell me about his servers where they are and and I'm going well what is this
[11:04.360 --> 11:08.960]  about well as you read the subpoena now yeah your subpoena is only asking for
[11:08.960 --> 11:12.320]  these IP addresses you're not allowed to be asking these questions so we're not
[11:12.320 --> 11:18.000]  going to answer and so I said this may be with dealing with the Obama deception
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.800]  because they're asking about it see I live in the real world folks where I
[11:21.800 --> 11:27.960]  deal with the FBI I deal in the real world where I deal with Secret Service
[11:27.960 --> 11:34.240]  coming to my office we've even got them on surveillance camera here at the
[11:34.240 --> 11:37.520]  office to protect ourselves but I'm not gonna sit there and start fights and
[11:37.520 --> 11:42.120]  punch them in the nose and put that video out this is the type of stuff I
[11:42.120 --> 11:46.080]  deal with and then and then these little children who aren't in the real world
[11:46.080 --> 11:55.320]  sit there and say I'm lying Alex Jones never lies Alex Jones takes action takes
[11:55.320 --> 11:59.160]  on the new world order and that's why so many people are jealous and so many
[11:59.160 --> 12:02.600]  people attack us and a lot of it's paid for we are under such co-enthaled pro
[12:02.600 --> 12:05.720]  attack because ladies and gentlemen we're an example of taking action we're
[12:05.720 --> 12:09.320]  an example of taking on the globalist we're an example of of alerting the
[12:09.320 --> 12:13.400]  people and setting bushfires in the minds and of men and women everywhere we're
[12:13.400 --> 12:18.440]  an example of leadership that mean we're perfect but we're doing the best we can
[12:18.440 --> 12:22.880]  with the tools God gave us and praying every day that God lead God and direct
[12:22.880 --> 12:33.000]  us but I deal with this stuff and you know now that we posted this article up
[12:33.000 --> 12:40.520]  on info wars.com dealing with an individual being arrested for comments
[12:40.520 --> 12:46.760]  they made on the info wars.com message board that's when I guessed it was about
[12:46.760 --> 12:54.920]  I went on there and I said I think this is about comments on the site but the FBI
[12:54.920 --> 13:00.440]  won't tell me and I told the listeners I said listen don't go on info wars.com
[13:00.440 --> 13:07.760]  and post a cop's name and home address and say go kill his family that's in the
[13:07.760 --> 13:15.880]  wrong and you should get in trouble and I got the big argument with the FBI on a
[13:15.880 --> 13:18.520]  separate issue I didn't know it was connected and it still mean it still
[13:18.520 --> 13:23.160]  may be something else they won't ever tell you. FBI calls up and says we
[13:23.160 --> 13:26.920]  noticed you took down those in a separate incident we noticed you took down
[13:26.920 --> 13:31.120]  those comments and I go yeah we didn't used to have moderators but we have to
[13:31.120 --> 13:34.600]  when they post cops houses and their names and say tell them and the FBI
[13:34.600 --> 13:38.200]  agents like leave it up that's evidence. He said you're gonna be getting a
[13:38.200 --> 13:42.920]  subpoena soon and I said I'm not leaving a cops home address and name and people
[13:42.920 --> 13:47.120]  saying go kill his family regardless of the fact that he killed that poor black
[13:47.120 --> 13:50.840]  guy in cold blood I'm not gonna be part of that and I should and then the agent
[13:50.840 --> 13:53.800]  calls back goes yeah actually that's the right thing to do take it down so then
[13:53.800 --> 13:59.080]  I start thinking are they trying to set me up telling me to leave up to see we
[13:59.080 --> 14:03.520]  already taken this down before we ever got called by the FBI and I don't have
[14:03.520 --> 14:07.640]  the money folks I don't have moderators I don't have the money so I got people
[14:07.640 --> 14:11.680]  part-time trying to go you know when they're saying kill cops kill the
[14:11.680 --> 14:20.120]  president kill kill kill I remember years ago before I got rid of another
[14:20.120 --> 14:27.760]  message board I had secret service calls up they say are you working with this
[14:27.760 --> 14:31.240]  person in Tennessee that says kill the president this was Bush and I said I
[14:31.240 --> 14:34.200]  don't even I'm not aware of this of this comment I went and looked at it and I
[14:34.200 --> 14:41.360]  called him back and I said no they said well we're just making sure and then a
[14:41.360 --> 14:45.680]  month later was in the newspaper the secret service in Tennessee rated the
[14:45.680 --> 14:49.560]  guy turned out he'd been a mental patient who'd gotten back out and he
[14:49.560 --> 14:57.920]  admitted what he'd done and they took him away I mean listen this is real folks
[14:57.920 --> 15:02.320]  there's always these comments about Alex you need to call for violence you need
[15:02.320 --> 15:07.240]  to call for a shooting war anybody who calls for a shooting war and doesn't get
[15:07.240 --> 15:13.200]  arrested is a fed and you know who I'm talking about and it did come out that
[15:13.200 --> 15:18.480]  Hal Turner was a fed even the Southern probably Law Center had to admit that
[15:18.480 --> 15:21.800]  they're the folks that ran the Elohim City white supremacist compound
[15:21.800 --> 15:26.200]  connected to the bombing of Oklahoma City Timothy McVeigh-Andres Strossmire
[15:26.200 --> 15:31.000]  that came out in FBI documents that's been in major newspapers very sinister
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.600]  group and that guy would say kill this judge kill that person and I said for
[15:35.600 --> 15:39.720]  years I said that guy's a fed then his emails came out then it was admitted that
[15:39.720 --> 15:43.720]  he was there trying to get crazies to come out so they could put him in prison
[15:43.720 --> 15:48.320]  it's the same thing with all these African American groups in Miami and in
[15:48.320 --> 15:52.800]  New York and New Jersey and in Indiana and in Pennsylvania it's always the same
[15:52.800 --> 15:56.000]  they go out and find teenagers or people at a bar they're normally on
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.600]  welfare mentally ill drug addicts they never seem to be Muslim they're always
[15:59.600 --> 16:04.880]  like rastafarian lack liberation and the FBI will create with an informant a
[16:04.880 --> 16:11.040]  group and they will then command them and say I'll give you a hundred thousand
[16:11.040 --> 16:14.440]  dollars to work ammo and go videotape the federal building and then the feds
[16:14.440 --> 16:17.600]  bust them and say they were planning to wage war on America and that's even come
[16:17.600 --> 16:35.680]  out mainstream news now that that is all staged and completely fake I mean this

[24:29.640 --> 24:36.080]  but first I want to finish up with this story imagine you're here at your
[24:36.080 --> 24:40.160]  office and the FBI shows up with subpoenas they're calling your employees up
[24:40.160 --> 24:43.000]  they're showing up and talking to your employees and you're saying what is this
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.440]  about the subpoena doesn't say they go we're not at liberty to compromise the
[24:46.440 --> 24:50.280]  investigation by the way tell me about your company where your servers are
[24:50.280 --> 24:56.760]  located tell me about free speech systems your company tell me about the
[24:56.760 --> 25:00.760]  Obama deception oh I like your website I look at it every day and I'm just like
[25:00.760 --> 25:07.560]  sitting here knowing this is the FBI that literally carried out the 1993 bombing
[25:07.560 --> 25:10.560]  I mean it was in the night it was in the newspaper in the New York Times that
[25:10.560 --> 25:14.280]  they cooked the bomb trained the driver gave them the detonators and let them do
[25:14.280 --> 25:19.200]  it it's on record they created clan groups in Dallas and try to get them to
[25:19.200 --> 25:26.040]  blow up chemical plants Texas Monthly gave my bum steer award in 1998 I mean
[25:26.040 --> 25:29.000]  it's on record all the horrible things they've done and I'm not saying all FBI
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.000]  agents are bad I know most of them are compartmentalized and investigating
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.280]  bank robberies and stuff like that and government corruption kind of keeping
[25:38.280 --> 25:45.320]  the states in line as they say violate the 10th Amendment but you know the
[25:45.320 --> 25:53.520]  anti-terrorism cadre these are terrorists it the BATF were blowing up
[25:53.520 --> 25:58.960]  rider trucks six months before 9-11 in New Mexico I mean before Oklahoma City on
[25:58.960 --> 26:03.640]  record and you can prove they were the ones that bombed ok see because they
[26:03.640 --> 26:06.480]  got in a bad name at Waco and they thought this would get them a good name
[26:06.480 --> 26:11.400]  again I mean these are some sickos folks and they're here and I don't know why
[26:11.400 --> 26:14.520]  they're here and it's four days before the Obama deception comes out and they're
[26:14.520 --> 26:22.320]  asking me about this stuff and so that's why I released the Obama deception well
[26:22.320 --> 26:27.600]  I think it's over this now but then there was some other visits by the Secret
[26:27.600 --> 26:33.400]  Service on other issues so it's hard to tell Roanoke man charged with making
[26:33.400 --> 26:37.800]  online threats Jeffrey L. Weaver is accused of posting threatening comments
[26:37.800 --> 26:42.600]  against two police officers on info wars.com a Roanoke man faces charges of

[33:13.240 --> 33:17.240]  on a long and lonesome highway
[33:17.240 --> 33:20.240]  in the east of Omaha
[33:20.240 --> 33:26.240]  you listen to the engine the morning out is one song
[33:26.240 --> 33:35.240]  you think about the woman the girl you knew the night before
[33:39.240 --> 33:46.240]  but your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
[33:46.240 --> 33:52.240]  when you're riding 16 hours there's nothing much to do
[33:52.240 --> 34:02.240]  and you don't feel much like riding you just miss the triples too

[34:18.240 --> 34:23.240]  here I go
[34:23.240 --> 34:28.240]  here I go
[34:28.240 --> 34:34.240]  and I pour every ounce of energy I've got to fighting the globalist
[34:34.240 --> 34:37.240]  and all I want to do is
[34:37.240 --> 34:41.240]  infect other people with the same passion to defeat the globalist I have
[34:41.240 --> 34:45.240]  because I know we can defeat them I know we can bring them down
[34:45.240 --> 34:48.240]  and break it back up
[34:57.240 --> 35:00.240]  most times you can hear them talk
[35:00.240 --> 35:03.240]  most times you can hear them talk
[35:03.240 --> 35:06.240]  other times you can
[35:06.240 --> 35:09.240]  all the same old cliches
[35:09.240 --> 35:13.240]  is it woman, is it man
[35:13.240 --> 35:16.240]  and you always see my number
[35:16.240 --> 35:21.240]  for damn it gets taken
[35:21.240 --> 35:25.240]  be yourself
[35:25.240 --> 35:29.240]  here I am
[35:29.240 --> 35:32.240]  on the road again
[35:32.240 --> 35:35.240]  there I am
[35:35.240 --> 35:38.240]  upon the stairs
[35:38.240 --> 35:41.240]  here I go
[35:41.240 --> 35:44.240]  upon the stairs
[35:44.240 --> 35:47.240]  here I go
[35:47.240 --> 35:53.240]  to the field
[35:53.240 --> 35:55.240]  there it is baby
[35:55.240 --> 35:58.240]  I'm there in the spotlight
[35:58.240 --> 36:01.240]  you're a million miles away
[36:01.240 --> 36:04.240]  every ounce of energy
[36:04.240 --> 36:08.240]  you're trying to give away
[36:08.240 --> 36:11.240]  when the sweat pours out your body
[36:11.240 --> 36:15.240]  like a music that you play
[36:15.240 --> 36:17.240]  that says it all
[36:17.240 --> 36:21.240]  literally pours out of my soul
[36:21.240 --> 36:24.240]  here in the evening
[36:24.240 --> 36:27.240]  you lie awake in bed
[36:27.240 --> 36:31.240]  with the echoes of the amplifiers
[36:31.240 --> 36:34.240]  ringing in your head
[36:34.240 --> 36:37.240]  you smoke the day's last cigarette
[36:37.240 --> 36:40.240]  remembering what she said
[36:40.240 --> 36:42.240]  what she said
[36:42.240 --> 36:45.240]  what she said
[36:49.240 --> 36:51.240]  now I don't normally play songs
[36:51.240 --> 36:54.240]  most of the way through let's just stop right there
[36:54.240 --> 36:56.240]  but when I get into all the world news
[36:56.240 --> 36:58.240]  all the important info is coming up
[36:58.240 --> 37:01.240]  and I want to rant about this because this
[37:01.240 --> 37:03.240]  brings up so many different points
[37:03.240 --> 37:05.240]  that affect our society so many important areas
[37:05.240 --> 37:07.240]  that we dealt with
[37:07.240 --> 37:09.240]  so imagine everybody's like
[37:09.240 --> 37:11.240]  Alex you need a message board
[37:11.240 --> 37:13.240]  you need comments on your stories
[37:13.240 --> 37:15.240]  and then we go okay we'll do it
[37:15.240 --> 37:17.240]  so I buy the programs and build it
[37:17.240 --> 37:19.240]  and try to get an extra webmaster
[37:19.240 --> 37:21.240]  to be able to set it all up
[37:21.240 --> 37:23.240]  and then right away the reason I shut one down
[37:23.240 --> 37:25.240]  four or five years ago
[37:25.240 --> 37:27.240]  is it's let's kill the president
[37:27.240 --> 37:29.240]  let's go after the police
[37:29.240 --> 37:31.240]  let's do that all these anonymous posters
[37:31.240 --> 37:33.240]  and I started getting the secret service
[37:33.240 --> 37:35.240]  FBI at my office and this happened years ago
[37:35.240 --> 37:37.240]  and I go that's it pull it pull the plug in
[37:37.240 --> 37:39.240]  oh you censor you to
[37:39.240 --> 37:41.240]  censor us saying go to the police
[37:41.240 --> 37:43.240]  house and kill them
[37:43.240 --> 37:45.240]  of course those are probably feds
[37:45.240 --> 37:47.240]  or co-intellect right there
[37:47.240 --> 37:49.240]  I mean they would bitch about anything
[37:49.240 --> 37:51.240]  they would make something up about any issue
[37:51.240 --> 37:53.240]  anything we do fabricating
[37:53.240 --> 37:55.240]  and then I have the FBI here
[37:55.240 --> 37:57.240]  the secret service here
[37:57.240 --> 37:59.240]  subpoenas federal subpoenas
[37:59.240 --> 38:01.240]  all of this stuff
[38:01.240 --> 38:03.240]  they won't tell me what it's about
[38:03.240 --> 38:05.240]  they're asking me about the Obama deception
[38:05.240 --> 38:07.240]  and laughing at me and stuff
[38:07.240 --> 38:09.240]  and I go on there and I go
[38:09.240 --> 38:11.240]  I don't know if it's about the Obama deception
[38:11.240 --> 38:13.240]  but they were asking about it get it out get it out early
[38:13.240 --> 38:15.240]  and oh look at him and his publicity stunned
[38:15.240 --> 38:17.240]  you know there's nothing going on
[38:17.240 --> 38:19.240]  he just releases films that tens
[38:19.240 --> 38:21.240]  of millions of people see
[38:21.240 --> 38:23.240]  you know it's just totally started the 9-11
[38:23.240 --> 38:25.240]  truth movement energize the entire
[38:25.240 --> 38:27.240]  liberty movement as we know it today
[38:27.240 --> 38:29.240]  and Ron Paul on record says half his
[38:29.240 --> 38:31.240]  support came from Alex Jones
[38:31.240 --> 38:33.240]  I mean this this guy in his audience there
[38:33.240 --> 38:35.240]  nothing oh yeah
[38:35.240 --> 38:37.240]  FBI sure
[38:39.240 --> 38:41.240]  well here it is one of
[38:41.240 --> 38:43.240]  the jackasses one of the poor fools
[38:43.240 --> 38:45.240]  who I'm sure didn't mean this he was just acting tough
[38:47.240 --> 38:49.240]  but it's the real world
[38:49.240 --> 38:51.240]  when you say something on one of our
[38:51.240 --> 38:53.240]  comment pages or on info wars
[38:55.240 --> 38:57.240]  that's it look I gotta raise more money
[38:57.240 --> 38:59.240]  I've got to hire either maybe I should
[38:59.240 --> 39:01.240]  do a poll that curtain I'll put a poll up
[39:01.240 --> 39:03.240]  should I
[39:03.240 --> 39:05.240]  make the message boards and comment
[39:05.240 --> 39:07.240]  on pages listeners sponsored and I got to have
[39:07.240 --> 39:09.240]  two moderators
[39:09.240 --> 39:11.240]  full-time 24
[39:11.240 --> 39:13.240]  really that'd be three to be full-time
[39:13.240 --> 39:15.240]  and then the weekends that'd be four I can't
[39:15.240 --> 39:17.240]  afford four people I can't afford
[39:17.240 --> 39:19.240]  one person but then
[39:19.240 --> 39:21.240]  I can't put a banner at
[39:21.240 --> 39:23.240]  up try to pay for bandwidth I can't put a banner
[39:23.240 --> 39:25.240]  at up without being bitched out about advertising
[39:25.240 --> 39:27.240]  how do you think I pay for the radio studio
[39:27.240 --> 39:29.240]  and the employees and the $30,000 a month
[39:29.240 --> 39:31.240]  of bandwidth and all of this stuff
[39:31.240 --> 39:33.240]  I got to constantly work just to fund
[39:33.240 --> 39:35.240]  this operation so I can then
[39:35.240 --> 39:37.240]  in the extra time fight the new world order
[39:37.240 --> 39:39.240]  you know how frustrating that is
[39:39.240 --> 39:41.240]  you know how hard that is
[39:47.240 --> 39:49.240]  how hard that is to deal with
[39:49.240 --> 39:51.240]  and
[39:53.240 --> 39:55.240]  and then meanwhile
[39:55.240 --> 39:57.240]  I got the FBI and Secret Service in here
[39:57.240 --> 39:59.240]  so so either I get
[39:59.240 --> 40:01.240]  because it doesn't work just to have one
[40:01.240 --> 40:03.240]  moderator you know they go oh let's kill
[40:03.240 --> 40:05.240]  the president oh Alex
[40:05.240 --> 40:07.240]  censored me
[40:07.240 --> 40:09.240]  no
[40:09.240 --> 40:11.240]  I own my website I own info wars
[40:11.240 --> 40:13.240]  and prison planet and prison planet
[40:13.240 --> 40:15.240]  form those are mine
[40:15.240 --> 40:17.240]  censorship would be if you owned
[40:17.240 --> 40:19.240]  a newspaper or a website and I came
[40:19.240 --> 40:21.240]  and shut it down and I was the government
[40:23.240 --> 40:25.240]  it isn't
[40:25.240 --> 40:27.240]  censorship if you were invited to a
[40:27.240 --> 40:29.240]  backyard barbecue in my backyard
[40:29.240 --> 40:31.240]  and you went over and squatted in the bushes
[40:31.240 --> 40:33.240]  and started defecating
[40:33.240 --> 40:35.240]  and I came over and said look
[40:35.240 --> 40:37.240]  I want you to leave that wouldn't be
[40:37.240 --> 40:39.240]  censorship it'd be private property
[40:41.240 --> 40:43.240]  that's what you do you come in you hike your leg
[40:43.240 --> 40:45.240]  in the middle of my website
[40:45.240 --> 40:47.240]  and I mean people work overtime
[40:47.240 --> 40:49.240]  to distract and divert you know we'll have a big
[40:49.240 --> 40:51.240]  article about 190 sponsors
[40:51.240 --> 40:53.240]  to end the Federal Reserve by auditing
[40:53.240 --> 40:55.240]  it that will end it
[40:55.240 --> 40:57.240]  and it's like oh yeah Alex is a fed
[40:57.240 --> 40:59.240]  he just wants to
[40:59.240 --> 41:01.240]  you know just all your and the sick part is
[41:01.240 --> 41:03.240]  most of them aren't feds and go and tell pro
[41:03.240 --> 41:05.240]  the sick part is they're just mentally ill
[41:05.240 --> 41:07.240]  detritus and wreckage
[41:07.240 --> 41:09.240]  of this society
[41:11.240 --> 41:13.240]  we got a good chance of beating the globalist
[41:13.240 --> 41:15.240]  and taking action but number one we have to
[41:15.240 --> 41:17.240]  ignore the diversions and the distractions
[41:17.240 --> 41:19.240]  and good people have to be heard
[41:19.240 --> 41:21.240]  good people have to speak out
[41:21.240 --> 41:23.240]  and start radio shows and access tv shows
[41:23.240 --> 41:25.240]  and websites and calling to talk radio
[41:25.240 --> 41:27.240]  and go on message boards and comment
[41:27.240 --> 41:29.240]  and counter these people not just on info wars
[41:29.240 --> 41:31.240]  but everywhere
[41:31.240 --> 41:33.240]  but that's why we're having
[41:33.240 --> 41:35.240]  the money bomb coming up Thursday which I haven't
[41:35.240 --> 41:37.240]  even promoted there's a video up on info wars
[41:37.240 --> 41:39.240]  dot com ten minute video where I break down
[41:39.240 --> 41:41.240]  our plans and why we need more funds
[41:41.240 --> 41:43.240]  please donate big time
[41:43.240 --> 41:45.240]  and the first thing I'm going to do is hire
[41:45.240 --> 41:47.240]  what I'll do is I'm going to hire
[41:47.240 --> 41:49.240]  not one webmaster I'm going to hire two
[41:49.240 --> 41:51.240]  so they can be webmasters and
[41:51.240 --> 41:53.240]  moderators so there's more news
[41:53.240 --> 41:55.240]  getting posted on info wars in prison planet
[41:55.240 --> 41:57.240]  and so they can be moderating
[41:57.240 --> 41:59.240]  and then I'm going to try to get some of the other crew here to part time do it
[41:59.240 --> 42:01.240]  because it's just
[42:01.240 --> 42:03.240]  constant and the fact that I have to talk about it
[42:03.240 --> 42:05.240]  means more stuff they'll go on and say
[42:05.240 --> 42:07.240]  kill cops kill cops from proxy
[42:07.240 --> 42:09.240]  IPs trying to get me in trouble
[42:09.240 --> 42:11.240]  we've always been nonviolent
[42:11.240 --> 42:13.240]  here when it comes to offensive
[42:13.240 --> 42:15.240]  attacks on the government don't go to a FEMA
[42:15.240 --> 42:17.240]  camp don't let CPS take your kids without
[42:17.240 --> 42:19.240]  due process stand up for liberty
[42:19.240 --> 42:21.240]  fight the new world order the globalists
[42:21.240 --> 42:23.240]  want to have a physical fight that's why
[42:23.240 --> 42:25.240]  they stage 9 11 a stage Oklahoma City
[42:25.240 --> 42:27.240]  that's why Hitler firebomb his own Reichstag
[42:27.240 --> 42:29.240]  attack his own military base to blame it on Poland
[42:29.240 --> 42:31.240]  and 39 they do this trick
[42:31.240 --> 42:33.240]  over and over again
[42:33.240 --> 42:35.240]  and I'm asking for your support
[42:35.240 --> 42:37.240]  ladies and gentlemen I need

[42:47.240 --> 42:49.240]  when everybody they can wait till Thursday
[42:49.240 --> 42:51.240]  to donate because we want to
[42:51.240 --> 42:53.240]  you know have that big event have that money
[42:53.240 --> 42:55.240]  bomb and I want to raise more than $250,000
[42:55.240 --> 42:57.240]  because if I hire a couple more webmasters
[42:57.240 --> 42:59.240]  an extra video editor
[42:59.240 --> 43:01.240]  expand the TV studio
[43:01.240 --> 43:03.240]  I mean that's easily $250,000 we blew
[43:03.240 --> 43:05.240]  through that 250 grand that is nothing
[43:05.240 --> 43:07.240]  and it really helped us
[43:07.240 --> 43:09.240]  and you can go watch the video what it helped us do
[43:09.240 --> 43:11.240]  up on info wars dot com
[43:11.240 --> 43:13.240]  but I got to hire a couple moderators or I got
[43:13.240 --> 43:15.240]  to shut it down
[43:15.240 --> 43:17.240]  and I tried to recruit volunteer moderators but they got
[43:17.240 --> 43:19.240]  lives and they get
[43:19.240 --> 43:21.240]  some of it down but that only seems to encourage people
[43:21.240 --> 43:23.240]  posting horrible stuff
[43:23.240 --> 43:25.240]  and so we just
[43:25.240 --> 43:27.240]  got to slam in there and get total control
[43:27.240 --> 43:29.240]  over the forums and all of this or it's got to be
[43:29.240 --> 43:31.240]  shut down because I can't
[43:31.240 --> 43:33.240]  let the feds use this to come
[43:33.240 --> 43:35.240]  after us ladies and gentlemen
[43:35.240 --> 43:37.240]  row and oak man charged
[43:37.240 --> 43:39.240]  with making online threats on info wars
[43:39.240 --> 43:41.240]  dot com row and oak times
[43:41.240 --> 43:43.240]  authorities traced the post to weavers internet
[43:43.240 --> 43:45.240]  protocol addresses
[43:45.240 --> 43:47.240]  which they say
[43:47.240 --> 43:49.240]  use several days earlier than they
[43:49.240 --> 43:51.240]  started contacting our server companies about that
[43:51.240 --> 43:53.240]  they went to our ISPs too
[43:53.240 --> 43:55.240]  they wouldn't tell them what it was about
[43:55.240 --> 43:57.240]  you imagine your ISPs when the FBI starts visiting
[43:57.240 --> 43:59.240]  them that's not fun either
[43:59.240 --> 44:01.240]  authorities traced
[44:01.240 --> 44:03.240]  the post to weavers internet protocol
[44:03.240 --> 44:05.240]  see they don't tell you who they're going after
[44:05.240 --> 44:07.240]  in case you would warn them it's an investigation
[44:07.240 --> 44:09.240]  people are like well tell us why the FBI
[44:09.240 --> 44:11.240]  was dead then they wouldn't
[44:11.240 --> 44:13.240]  tell us
[44:13.240 --> 44:15.240]  that's how this works
[44:15.240 --> 44:17.240]  god forbid it ever happens to you you'll find out
[44:17.240 --> 44:19.240]  and they show up in their suits
[44:19.240 --> 44:21.240]  with their firearms and black sunglasses
[44:23.240 --> 44:25.240]  authorities traced the post to weavers internet protocol
[44:25.240 --> 44:27.240]  address which they say was used
[44:27.240 --> 44:29.240]  several days earlier to make even more
[44:29.240 --> 44:31.240]  menacing comments about the fatal shooting
[44:31.240 --> 44:33.240]  of an unarmed man by police officers
[44:33.240 --> 44:35.240]  on a trained platform in Oakland
[44:35.240 --> 44:37.240]  the new
[44:37.240 --> 44:39.240]  year's
[44:39.240 --> 44:41.240]  death of 22 year old oscar grant led to
[44:41.240 --> 44:43.240]  violent street protest and was also featured
[44:43.240 --> 44:45.240]  on info wars dot com
[44:45.240 --> 44:47.240]  I guess it's my fault that guy got shot then it always is
[44:47.240 --> 44:49.240]  if I find out
[44:49.240 --> 44:51.240]  this is what he said for somebody edits this which they do
[44:51.240 --> 44:53.240]  and say I said it they really are trying hard
[44:53.240 --> 44:55.240]  in fact I'm not even going to read what this guy said
[44:55.240 --> 44:57.240]  because people will just edit it and say I said it
[44:57.240 --> 44:59.240]  I'm already trying that all over the web I'm sure a lot of you have seen the attacks
[44:59.240 --> 45:01.240]  it's unbelievable
[45:01.240 --> 45:03.240]  if I
[45:03.240 --> 45:05.240]  find out who that pig is I want to
[45:05.240 --> 45:07.240]  bleep
[45:07.240 --> 45:09.240]  the pig who bleeped him
[45:09.240 --> 45:11.240]  weaver wrote on a January 5th according
[45:11.240 --> 45:13.240]  to the complaint
[45:13.240 --> 45:15.240]  a short time later the address of one of the police officers involved in the shooting
[45:15.240 --> 45:17.240]  was posted on the website
[45:17.240 --> 45:19.240]  thanks for the address I remember seeing this one
[45:19.240 --> 45:21.240]  Saturday morning and I called Nemo and I said get it down
[45:21.240 --> 45:23.240]  he's like okay
[45:23.240 --> 45:25.240]  Nemo works like seven days a week
[45:25.240 --> 45:27.240]  he's like we ought to you know I like these comments
[45:27.240 --> 45:29.240]  we just got to get rid of them and we can't
[45:29.240 --> 45:31.240]  cause I'm always calling going oh my god they're saying
[45:31.240 --> 45:33.240]  here's a person's address kill them get it off quick
[45:33.240 --> 45:35.240]  and usually you know the feds don't catch it I'm like
[45:35.240 --> 45:37.240]  get it off they're saying kill people
[45:37.240 --> 45:39.240]  they're saying where the local cop lives they're saying murder this judge
[45:39.240 --> 45:41.240]  get it off get it off
[45:41.240 --> 45:43.240]  then I had the FBI going no you don't take that stuff down
[45:43.240 --> 45:45.240]  I'm like you want me to leave up cops addresses
[45:45.240 --> 45:47.240]  and where to go kill them
[45:49.240 --> 45:51.240]  I said no
[45:51.240 --> 45:53.240]  I hadn't got the subpoena yet and I said you better
[45:53.240 --> 45:55.240]  not put that in that subpoena and he goes
[45:55.240 --> 45:57.240]  called back goes yeah I guess you've got a point
[45:57.240 --> 45:59.240]  yeah I got a point use your head numbskull
[46:01.240 --> 46:03.240]  you people are stupid
[46:03.240 --> 46:05.240]  the FBI told me to leave the cops address
[46:05.240 --> 46:07.240]  on the web now I can finally talk about it
[46:09.240 --> 46:11.240]  of course I found out about that after I
[46:11.240 --> 46:13.240]  panicked thinking it was about the Obama
[46:13.240 --> 46:15.240]  deception because they still wouldn't say exactly what it was about
[46:15.240 --> 46:17.240]  thanks for the address the next post read
[46:17.240 --> 46:19.240]  now that I know where he is
[46:19.240 --> 46:21.240]  and where his family is it's only a matter of time
[46:21.240 --> 46:23.240]  the complaint quoted we were to saying as he planned
[46:23.240 --> 46:25.240]  to kill the officer's wife and child before
[46:25.240 --> 46:27.240]  killing him this isn't a
[46:27.240 --> 46:29.240]  threat it's a effing promise the message
[46:29.240 --> 46:31.240]  continued that was real smart
[46:31.240 --> 46:33.240]  you're going to go away to federal
[46:33.240 --> 46:35.240]  prison for a long time dumbass
[46:35.240 --> 46:37.240]  on May 29 federal agents
[46:37.240 --> 46:39.240]  search weavers row and oak home
[46:39.240 --> 46:41.240]  he told them he frequents info wars dot
[46:41.240 --> 46:43.240]  com admitting making the postings according to the
[46:43.240 --> 46:45.240]  complaint
[46:45.240 --> 46:47.240]  that was another real smart thing he did
[46:47.240 --> 46:49.240]  you know
[46:49.240 --> 46:51.240]  memo to people out there and I don't think
[46:51.240 --> 46:53.240]  you should ever go out and do anything offensively violent
[46:53.240 --> 46:55.240]  but if you ever were how about you not talk
[46:55.240 --> 46:57.240]  about it
[46:57.240 --> 46:59.240]  but obviously you weren't going to go to California and kill his family
[46:59.240 --> 47:01.240]  you're an idiot
[47:01.240 --> 47:03.240]  I don't think we should fill the prison space
[47:03.240 --> 47:05.240]  with you
[47:05.240 --> 47:07.240]  maybe a year to teach the guy a lesson but he's an idiot
[47:07.240 --> 47:09.240]  an idiot
[47:09.240 --> 47:11.240]  you go on a site that the entire new world
[47:11.240 --> 47:13.240]  watches closely
[47:13.240 --> 47:15.240]  and you go on there and you say go to the cops
[47:15.240 --> 47:17.240]  house and kill his kids
[47:17.240 --> 47:19.240]  and that you promise you're going to do it
[47:19.240 --> 47:21.240]  what is your problem
[47:23.240 --> 47:25.240]  weaver said he was angry at the time
[47:25.240 --> 47:27.240]  but insisted he did not
[47:27.240 --> 47:29.240]  intend to harm anyone
[47:29.240 --> 47:31.240]  after hearing testimony friday us magistrate john
[47:31.240 --> 47:33.240]  michael
[47:33.240 --> 47:35.240]  urmansky ruled there was probable
[47:35.240 --> 47:37.240]  cause to support the charges and ordered
[47:37.240 --> 47:39.240]  weaver held without bond
[47:39.240 --> 47:41.240]  urmansky rejected an argument
[47:41.240 --> 47:43.240]  by the public defender fey spence
[47:43.240 --> 47:45.240]  who said weaver's actions were protected by the first
[47:45.240 --> 47:47.240]  amendment
[47:47.240 --> 47:49.240]  no you can't say go to this person's house and kill their kids
[47:49.240 --> 47:51.240]  or i'm going to go kill them
[47:51.240 --> 47:53.240]  by the way that's exactly
[47:53.240 --> 47:55.240]  why
[47:55.240 --> 47:57.240]  michael reagan got up and said
[47:57.240 --> 47:59.240]  kill palestinian children
[47:59.240 --> 48:01.240]  put hanger nades in their rectum and kill them
[48:01.240 --> 48:03.240]  we can play the clip
[48:03.240 --> 48:05.240]  pull up
[48:05.240 --> 48:07.240]  the clip of just youtube
[48:07.240 --> 48:09.240]  he always tries to take it down but it's everywhere
[48:09.240 --> 48:11.240]  michael reagan says kill palestinian children
[48:11.240 --> 48:13.240]  kill 911 truthers
[48:13.240 --> 48:15.240]  and he said i will pay for the bullets call me
[48:15.240 --> 48:17.240]  i will pay anyone he solicited murder
[48:17.240 --> 48:19.240]  8 million listeners
[48:19.240 --> 48:21.240]  fifth biggest show in the country
[48:21.240 --> 48:23.240]  he said i solicit murder
[48:23.240 --> 48:25.240]  i want you to kill mark
[48:25.240 --> 48:27.240]  dice in a firing squad and i will pay you
[48:27.240 --> 48:29.240]  and i want 911 truthers killed
[48:29.240 --> 48:31.240]  the fbi would do
[48:31.240 --> 48:33.240]  nothing
[48:33.240 --> 48:35.240]  nothing
[48:35.240 --> 48:37.240]  nothing that is a thousand times more
[48:37.240 --> 48:39.240]  dangerous than somebody shooting their mouth
[48:39.240 --> 48:41.240]  on a message board who's done it a hundred times
[48:41.240 --> 48:43.240]  on little sites not knowing he's in the big time
[48:43.240 --> 48:45.240]  on a big site doing it
[48:45.240 --> 48:47.240]  kill
[48:47.240 --> 48:49.240]  mark dice i will pay you
[48:49.240 --> 48:51.240]  i will buy the bullets murder him
[48:51.240 --> 48:53.240]  i will pay you he lives in san diego
[48:53.240 --> 48:55.240]  nothing
[48:55.240 --> 48:57.240]  nothing
[48:57.240 --> 48:59.240]  instead we put that clip out trying to defend ourselves
[48:59.240 --> 49:01.240]  and michael reagan was one of the ones we found out
[49:01.240 --> 49:03.240]  filing the copyright infringement
[49:03.240 --> 49:05.240]  to shut down the alex jones channel along
[49:05.240 --> 49:07.240]  with the pittsburgh post gazette
[49:07.240 --> 49:09.240]  filed federal countersuits and blocked the son
[49:09.240 --> 49:11.240]  of a bitch i'm sorry to talk like that i'm just

[49:13.240 --> 49:15.240]  right now
[49:17.240 --> 49:19.240]  you can't get up on the radio
[49:19.240 --> 49:21.240]  reagan and tell people to commit murder
[49:21.240 --> 49:23.240]  you have a responsibility you
[49:23.240 --> 49:25.240]  idiot and obviously
[49:25.240 --> 49:27.240]  you meant it flippantly you're still a jackass
[49:27.240 --> 49:29.240]  and need to go to jail for it
[49:29.240 --> 49:31.240]  at least a year so that people
[49:31.240 --> 49:33.240]  understand you can't yell fire in
[49:33.240 --> 49:37.240]  a theater
[49:37.240 --> 49:39.240]  you can't call from cold blood

[49:57.240 --> 49:59.240]  the bogus political labels of left and right
[49:59.240 --> 50:03.240]  well finally some mainstream media got that right

[54:29.240 --> 54:33.240]  of everything that starts
[54:33.240 --> 54:35.240]  the end
[54:35.240 --> 54:37.240]  you know Friday
[54:37.240 --> 54:39.240]  I wrote a story about David Carradine
[54:39.240 --> 54:41.240]  I guess dying last Thursday
[54:41.240 --> 54:43.240]  and I haven't talked about it because we've got so many other big issues to cover
[54:43.240 --> 54:45.240]  but it is an interesting case point
[54:45.240 --> 54:47.240]  example in how the media works
[54:47.240 --> 54:49.240]  Larry King live had his lawyer
[54:49.240 --> 54:51.240]  and friends and family on
[54:51.240 --> 54:53.240]  saying he was investigating secret
[54:53.240 --> 54:55.240]  societies and gonna do some
[54:55.240 --> 54:57.240]  production on it in the future
[54:57.240 --> 54:59.240]  and gonna be going public
[54:59.240 --> 55:01.240]  and I had separately heard from some folks in Hollywood
[55:01.240 --> 55:03.240]  that David Carradine was indeed
[55:03.240 --> 55:05.240]  involved in that
[55:05.240 --> 55:07.240]  and I'd actually been contacted
[55:07.240 --> 55:09.240]  about a year ago by someone close
[55:09.240 --> 55:11.240]  to Carradine and I'd just been so busy
[55:11.240 --> 55:13.240]  I played phone tag with David Carradine
[55:13.240 --> 55:15.240]  I mean literally I get calls from
[55:15.240 --> 55:17.240]  Hollywood people all the time and I'm just so busy
[55:17.240 --> 55:19.240]  and they're busy and like we talked
[55:19.240 --> 55:21.240]  to the director of the film
[55:21.240 --> 55:23.240]  that Ann Hayes is in and you know
[55:23.240 --> 55:25.240]  their listeners they're aware of the show
[55:25.240 --> 55:27.240]  she wants to come on but who knows that will even ever happen
[55:27.240 --> 55:29.240]  because people get so busy
[55:29.240 --> 55:31.240]  busy people got stuff going on but the issue is
[55:31.240 --> 55:33.240]  I should have gotten Carradine on
[55:33.240 --> 55:35.240]  I should have gotten
[55:35.240 --> 55:37.240]  Hunter S. Thompson on turned out
[55:37.240 --> 55:39.240]  one of his best friends writer for the
[55:39.240 --> 55:41.240]  Toronto Star came on the show
[55:41.240 --> 55:43.240]  and said no he was aware of your work
[55:43.240 --> 55:45.240]  in the New World Order and was gonna write a book
[55:45.240 --> 55:47.240]  about Bohemian Grove which was bizarre
[55:47.240 --> 55:49.240]  because he'd been accused in a book
[55:49.240 --> 55:51.240]  of being involved in Bohemian Grove
[55:51.240 --> 55:53.240]  which I find curious because
[55:53.240 --> 55:55.240]  then he did write
[55:55.240 --> 55:57.240]  some articles talking about
[55:57.240 --> 55:59.240]  the elites and how they were a bunch of pedophiles
[55:59.240 --> 56:01.240]  so very very strange but I never reached out
[56:01.240 --> 56:03.240]  here's another example
[56:03.240 --> 56:05.240]  I get sent a signed lithograph
[56:05.240 --> 56:07.240]  for me of an empty bird cage
[56:07.240 --> 56:09.240]  by Kurt Vonnegut I talked to his well known
[56:09.240 --> 56:11.240]  business partner
[56:11.240 --> 56:13.240]  Joe Pietro I got Joe on Joe said he'd come on
[56:13.240 --> 56:15.240]  I just get so busy with the news I don't think to do it
[56:15.240 --> 56:17.240]  and he said no Kurt likes your films
[56:17.240 --> 56:19.240]  wanted me to send you this he's real old
[56:19.240 --> 56:21.240]  right now and doesn't want to do any public speaking
[56:21.240 --> 56:23.240]  but he might do your show
[56:23.240 --> 56:25.240]  and he just given a speech saying
[56:25.240 --> 56:27.240]  I'm done he gave it his alma mater
[56:27.240 --> 56:29.240]  and said I'm gone now you won't see me again
[56:29.240 --> 56:31.240]  and then he died of your later
[56:31.240 --> 56:33.240]  but in my house I have
[56:33.240 --> 56:35.240]  signed Kurt Vonnegut to Alex
[56:35.240 --> 56:37.240]  you know bird cage
[56:37.240 --> 56:39.240]  I mean a lithograph he did
[56:39.240 --> 56:41.240]  Kurt Vonnegut I mean he doesn't get any
[56:41.240 --> 56:43.240]  cooler than that I grew up my parents
[56:43.240 --> 56:45.240]  we had huge fans of Kurt Vonnegut
[56:45.240 --> 56:47.240]  Slaughterhouse 5 Sirens of Titan
[56:47.240 --> 56:49.240]  I read that stuff when I was a teenager
[56:49.240 --> 56:51.240]  I guess that went into forming my political views
[56:51.240 --> 56:53.240]  and then he was dead
[56:53.240 --> 56:55.240]  I guess with these
[56:55.240 --> 56:57.240]  you know I'm going to call Keanu Reeves up
[56:57.240 --> 56:59.240]  I'm going to call Woody Harrelson up
[56:59.240 --> 57:01.240]  I'd forgotten I did have his number
[57:01.240 --> 57:03.240]  I'm going to really just go ahead and start trying to push
[57:03.240 --> 57:05.240]  to get these celebrities on because it's always
[57:05.240 --> 57:07.240]  it's so much news attention and
[57:07.240 --> 57:09.240]  really then that hype
[57:09.240 --> 57:11.240]  helps reach a whole new audience and I'm just not
[57:11.240 --> 57:13.240]  starstruck is my point
[57:13.240 --> 57:15.240]  I'm kind of struck with all the news and information
[57:15.240 --> 57:17.240]  so I never remember to cover all the key info
[57:17.240 --> 57:19.240]  and I could get set up I could get arrested
[57:19.240 --> 57:21.240]  I could get killed
[57:21.240 --> 57:23.240]  those David Carradine things shows that and they always like to kill you
[57:23.240 --> 57:25.240]  in a sexually embarrassing way
[57:25.240 --> 57:27.240]  I predicted that if they ever kill me
[57:27.240 --> 57:29.240]  one of the ways they'll do it is to drive by shooting
[57:29.240 --> 57:31.240]  or a carjacking or
[57:31.240 --> 57:33.240]  grab me, drug me up
[57:33.240 --> 57:35.240]  put me dead in the hotel room and kill a hooker next to me
[57:35.240 --> 57:37.240]  that's one of their favorite ways to do it
[57:37.240 --> 57:39.240]  and I have no doubt they probably killed David Carradine
[57:39.240 --> 57:41.240]  because I knew he was working on this
[57:41.240 --> 57:43.240]  but we wrote a story
[57:43.240 --> 57:45.240]  just
[57:45.240 --> 57:47.240]  mentioning
[57:47.240 --> 57:49.240]  Larry King live on their TV shows saying
[57:49.240 --> 57:51.240]  he was about to come out with conspiracies
[57:51.240 --> 57:53.240]  and then German news
[57:53.240 --> 57:55.240]  is saying we're reporting it
[57:55.240 --> 57:57.240]  no CNN is
[57:57.240 --> 57:59.240]  but German newspapers are reporting off info wars
[57:59.240 --> 58:01.240]  such as classic media
[58:01.240 --> 58:03.240]  this is not our conspiracy theory
[58:03.240 --> 58:05.240]  news is saying conspiracy theory website infowars.com
[58:05.240 --> 58:07.240]  it's not a conspiracy theory
[58:07.240 --> 58:09.240]  okay
[58:09.240 --> 58:11.240]  it's not a conspiracy theory
[58:11.240 --> 58:13.240]  this stuff is going on
[58:13.240 --> 58:15.240]  and my gut tells me
[58:15.240 --> 58:17.240]  they killed David Carradine
[58:17.240 --> 58:19.240]  and I have no doubt that what's been reported on
[58:19.240 --> 58:21.240]  that his dad was part of some organizations
[58:21.240 --> 58:23.240]  and that's probably true
[58:23.240 --> 58:25.240]  most of Hollywood especially at that time was
[58:25.240 --> 58:27.240]  my experience now
[58:27.240 --> 58:29.240]  is Hollywood
[58:29.240 --> 58:31.240]  at the star levels rebelled against all that
[58:31.240 --> 58:33.240]  sick of their Crowley in roots

[1:01:35.240 --> 1:01:37.240]  i had it happen to me with carpet cleaners
[1:01:37.240 --> 1:01:39.240]  but i had a bad feeling and called the carpet place
[1:01:39.240 --> 1:01:41.240]  we tried to call the cops
[1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:43.240]  yes we tried to explain to our cleaner that guns are legal in texas
[1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:45.240]  and but there have been a whole debate
[1:01:45.240 --> 1:01:47.240]  about whether to call the cops on me or not
[1:01:47.240 --> 1:01:49.240]  so i'm telling you this is dangerous
[1:01:49.240 --> 1:01:51.240]  somebody needs to start a company
[1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:53.240]  like plumbing and carpet cleaning
[1:01:53.240 --> 1:01:55.240]  and stuff that advertises we don't spy on you
[1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:57.240]  when you're in your and when we're in your house
[1:01:57.240 --> 1:01:59.240]  see cops got to get a warrant to go in your house
[1:01:59.240 --> 1:02:01.240]  but not all these repair people

[1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:05.240]  man they're just they're looking they're all getting a little cut off that
[1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:07.240]  and

[1:02:11.240 --> 1:02:13.240]  who've been raided but i know old women
[1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:15.240]  who get raided
[1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:17.240]  for fish tanks if cleaner men

[1:02:31.240 --> 1:02:33.240]  i forget the scientific name for studying fish
[1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:35.240]  and they saw a bunch of fish tanks in her house
[1:02:35.240 --> 1:02:37.240]  and you know they raided her
[1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:39.240]  knocked her door down
[1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:41.240]  and i had a good friend
[1:02:41.240 --> 1:02:43.240]  nick help actually work on
[1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:45.240]  america's web by design
[1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:47.240]  he and his girlfriend live next door to me
[1:02:47.240 --> 1:02:49.240]  in the apartments or a few doors down
[1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:51.240]  we're friends totally clean cut
[1:02:51.240 --> 1:02:53.240]  you know this guy was like zero percent fat
[1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:55.240]  running five miles a day lifting weights
[1:02:55.240 --> 1:02:57.240]  and we worked out some
[1:02:57.240 --> 1:02:59.240]  that's why it was so funny the guy wouldn't even really drink
[1:02:59.240 --> 1:03:01.240]  when uh
[1:03:01.240 --> 1:03:03.240]  he is uh
[1:03:03.240 --> 1:03:05.240]  they knocked his door down
[1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:07.240]  the swat team came because his girlfriend
[1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:09.240]  was taking botany at ut and had some
[1:03:09.240 --> 1:03:11.240]  little flowers growing with a growlite
[1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:13.240]  he just said i mean you can't have
[1:03:13.240 --> 1:03:15.240]  a growlite in america you're gonna be swat team
[1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:17.240]  you understand that i mean this just
[1:03:17.240 --> 1:03:19.240]  happened to jt coyote i've got
[1:03:19.240 --> 1:03:21.240]  the police reports and everything right here they're up on info wars
[1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:23.240]  dot com
[1:03:23.240 --> 1:03:25.240]  and it says two firearms were seen
[1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:27.240]  you look you don't have firearms
[1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:29.240]  in colorado do you understand that
[1:03:29.240 --> 1:03:31.240]  it doesn't matter if they're legal swat teams are coming
[1:03:31.240 --> 1:03:33.240]  that's how this country
[1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:35.240]  operates that's why there's billboards up
[1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:37.240]  i can be in new york california texas
[1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:39.240]  i've seen them for at least a decade
[1:03:39.240 --> 1:03:41.240]  these billboards that show a revolver pointed at you
[1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:43.240]  threateningly and it says report illegal guns
[1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:45.240]  well the slave public
[1:03:45.240 --> 1:03:47.240]  that doesn't own guns half the population
[1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:49.240]  they think guns illegal that billboard
[1:03:49.240 --> 1:03:51.240]  is it is false advertising
[1:03:51.240 --> 1:03:53.240]  it's meant to say revolvers are
[1:03:53.240 --> 1:03:55.240]  illegal
[1:03:55.240 --> 1:03:57.240]  alright i'm done talking about that
[1:03:57.240 --> 1:03:59.240]  since we're live at prisonplanet.tv
[1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:01.240]  i'm gonna air this michael reagan clip in the next
[1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:03.240]  segment and think it into other news
[1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:05.240]  this michael reagan clip is him
[1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:07.240]  last year saying murder mark dies
[1:04:07.240 --> 1:04:09.240]  i will pay for the bullets and kill other 9-11 truthers
[1:04:09.240 --> 1:04:11.240]  and
[1:04:11.240 --> 1:04:13.240]  for soliciting murder on air to 8 million people
[1:04:13.240 --> 1:04:15.240]  he should be arrested
[1:04:15.240 --> 1:04:17.240]  now i said earlier
[1:04:17.240 --> 1:04:19.240]  that this fool
[1:04:19.240 --> 1:04:21.240]  rowan oak man charged with making
[1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:23.240]  online threats on info wars dot com
[1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:25.240]  rowan oak newspaper
[1:04:25.240 --> 1:04:27.240]  he went on there and said
[1:04:27.240 --> 1:04:29.240]  kill this cop kill that cop he went on there and said
[1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:31.240]  go to their house kill their family
[1:04:31.240 --> 1:04:33.240]  that's horrible to say kill somebody's
[1:04:33.240 --> 1:04:35.240]  children and he's now been arrested
[1:04:35.240 --> 1:04:37.240]  he should get in trouble
[1:04:37.240 --> 1:04:39.240]  but this was obviously across the country
[1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:41.240]  had some danger
[1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:43.240]  but nothing compared to michael reagan to
[1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:45.240]  8 million people saying it he didn't get in trouble
[1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:47.240]  why we're gonna ask that question we get back

[1:08:01.240 --> 1:08:03.240]  Alex Jones on the GCN
[1:08:03.240 --> 1:08:05.240]  Radio Network
[1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:07.240]  Coming up
[1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:09.240]  an AP headline
[1:08:09.240 --> 1:08:11.240]  all businesses
[1:08:11.240 --> 1:08:13.240]  bond market route
[1:08:13.240 --> 1:08:15.240]  lifts mortgage costs
[1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:17.240]  the Federal Reserve announced
[1:08:17.240 --> 1:08:19.240]  a 1.2 trillion plan three months ago
[1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:21.240]  designed to push down mortgage rates
[1:08:21.240 --> 1:08:23.240]  and breathe life into the housing market
[1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:25.240]  but this and other big government spending programs
[1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:27.240]  are turning out to have the opposite effect
[1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:29.240]  rates and mortgages and US Treasury debts
[1:08:29.240 --> 1:08:31.240]  are now marching higher
[1:08:31.240 --> 1:08:33.240]  as nervous bond investors fret
[1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:35.240]  about the re-insurgence of inflation
[1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:37.240]  again I don't have the staff and crew to do this
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:39.240]  but it's very effective
[1:08:39.240 --> 1:08:41.240]  with new listeners and viewers online
[1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:43.240]  if listeners will go back to

[1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:49.240]  I said this will increase
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:51.240]  on every show
[1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:53.240]  I said this will increase
[1:08:53.240 --> 1:08:55.240]  the amount of mortgages
[1:08:55.240 --> 1:08:57.240]  and then I explained why
[1:08:57.240 --> 1:08:59.240]  we've seen the IMF and World Bank do this
[1:08:59.240 --> 1:09:01.240]  hundreds of times in third world countries
[1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:03.240]  and in western countries
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:05.240]  this is a shaken bank
[1:09:05.240 --> 1:09:07.240]  it's like people go you're a genius

[1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:15.240]  whipped it and put it on a griddle
[1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:17.240]  I mean this is what they do
[1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:19.240]  it's like Alex Jones is incredible
[1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:21.240]  he took me to Africa and took me out in the savannah
[1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:23.240]  and said watch that tiger

[1:09:27.240 --> 1:09:29.240]  I don't know how he does it
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:31.240]  15 years ago I took you to a bulls game
[1:09:31.240 --> 1:09:33.240]  and I said watch this
[1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:35.240]  that guy right there Michael Jordan

[1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:39.240]  he's going to go over and slam dunk a ball
[1:09:39.240 --> 1:09:41.240]  and then he slam dunks it
[1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:43.240]  and they go how did you know that

[1:09:49.240 --> 1:09:51.240]  this stuff is so simple
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:53.240]  it's all stated on record
[1:09:53.240 --> 1:09:55.240]  they openly run giant eugenics
[1:09:55.240 --> 1:09:57.240]  foundations they say world government
[1:09:57.240 --> 1:09:59.240]  is going to be put in place to carry out
[1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:01.240]  our orderly extermination and I give you all
[1:10:01.240 --> 1:10:03.240]  the articles and documents every day
[1:10:05.240 --> 1:10:07.240]  I shoot you straight here
[1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:09.240]  but you don't have to believe me you can go check it out
[1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:11.240]  I tell you biological
[1:10:11.240 --> 1:10:13.240]  diversity assessments
[1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:15.240]  89, 95, 96
[1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:17.240]  they all talk about getting rid of 80% of the population
[1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:19.240]  I put screenshots of it in my films
[1:10:19.240 --> 1:10:21.240]  you can go to the UN
[1:10:21.240 --> 1:10:23.240]  online and read it
[1:10:25.240 --> 1:10:27.240]  I mean I'm telling you
[1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:29.240]  the truth but trust but verify
[1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:33.240]  trust but verify
[1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:35.240]  speaking of Reagan we're going to get into all that
[1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:37.240]  here's Michael Reagan the adopted son of Ronald Reagan
[1:10:39.240 --> 1:10:41.240]  Ronald Reagan would never get up on the air
[1:10:41.240 --> 1:10:43.240]  and say go out and buy
[1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:45.240]  you know I'll buy the bullets
[1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:47.240]  I'll buy the guns go out and kill Mark Dias
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:49.240]  the prominent 9-11 truther that said mail
[1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:51.240]  my dvds terror storm
[1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:53.240]  to troops overseas to show them
[1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:55.240]  the history of government sponsored terror
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:10:57.240]  from the CIA history page
[1:10:57.240 --> 1:10:59.240]  I mean that's from CIA.gov
[1:10:59.240 --> 1:11:01.240]  in the film they bragged they staged
[1:11:01.240 --> 1:11:03.240]  terror attacks in Iran
[1:11:03.240 --> 1:11:05.240]  they staged attacks and blamed it
[1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:07.240]  on the government and said
[1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:09.240]  kind of a reverse false flag have you like
[1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:11.240]  of the government today some other
[1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:13.240]  government staged a terror attack and made it look like
[1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:15.240]  her government did it you know very sophisticated
[1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:17.240]  what they did is they shot
[1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:19.240]  mosque bomb mosque killed imams
[1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:21.240]  because most of that was trying to keep the Muslim
[1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:23.240]  extremist out of control he was a secular
[1:11:23.240 --> 1:11:25.240]  you know person who wanted to build
[1:11:25.240 --> 1:11:27.240]  up the country but wouldn't give BP
[1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:29.240]  British petroleum and Dutch will shell all the
[1:11:29.240 --> 1:11:31.240]  oil and Anglo-American oil at the time
[1:11:31.240 --> 1:11:33.240]  and so they went in and staged
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:35.240]  terror attacks and printed up tens of thousands
[1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:37.240]  of handbills saying most of that had done it
[1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:39.240]  as if it was from most of that saying look I've
[1:11:39.240 --> 1:11:41.240]  I'm attacking the Muslims
[1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:43.240]  see
[1:11:43.240 --> 1:11:45.240]  you go back to 1953 there are the radical
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:47.240]  Muslims working for the globalist
[1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:49.240]  they've radicalized them at least
[1:11:49.240 --> 1:11:51.240]  to keep them under their control
[1:11:51.240 --> 1:11:53.240]  Iraq the women 60% of doctor
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:55.240]  and lawyer graduates
[1:11:55.240 --> 1:11:57.240]  and period 60%
[1:11:57.240 --> 1:11:59.240]  across the board was women
[1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:01.240]  women didn't wear the headdresses women
[1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:03.240]  have the same rights as men women were in the highest
[1:12:03.240 --> 1:12:05.240]  levels of government industry not anymore
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:07.240]  they wear burqas you don't see their faces
[1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:09.240]  it's now an Islamic
[1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:11.240]  government that's what the
[1:12:11.240 --> 1:12:13.240]  the Muslim extremist
[1:12:13.240 --> 1:12:15.240]  work for the new world order and they think you'll never
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:17.240]  figure that out but it's so obvious
[1:12:17.240 --> 1:12:19.240]  it's the White House admits
[1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:21.240]  the last White House this White House they have
[1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:23.240]  four al-Qaeda groups attacking Iran
[1:12:23.240 --> 1:12:25.240]  bombing dams bombing police stations
[1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:27.240]  attacking school buses trying to get the Iranians
[1:12:27.240 --> 1:12:29.240]  to attack the US and to attack the fleet
[1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:31.240]  the Iranians go on TV and say police stop
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:33.240]  staging terror attacks police stop staging terror
[1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:35.240]  attacks and the US admits
[1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:37.240]  they're staging but that isn't the US
[1:12:37.240 --> 1:12:39.240]  that's the bankers that control us and are using
[1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:41.240]  us
[1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:43.240]  they publicly used al-Qaeda to attack the Serbs
[1:12:43.240 --> 1:12:45.240]  same story over and over again
[1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:47.240]  the Serbs defend themselves
[1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:49.240]  all the Serbs are engaged in a massacre
[1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:51.240]  we've now got to go take the Serbs over
[1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:53.240]  and the UN comes in and takes over
[1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:55.240]  so that's what's going on here
[1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:57.240]  now let me just
[1:12:57.240 --> 1:12:59.240]  finish with this I'm going to do a brief recap
[1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:01.240]  as I covered this last hour then I'm going to get into all the news
[1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:03.240]  then JT coyotes coming up
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:05.240]  and then Joe Bannister in studio
[1:13:05.240 --> 1:13:07.240]  in the third hour today I'm going to get into the latest
[1:13:07.240 --> 1:13:09.240]  eugenics info some key info
[1:13:09.240 --> 1:13:11.240]  I want to cover there coming up
[1:13:11.240 --> 1:13:13.240]  and your calls
[1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:15.240]  Roanoke man charged with making
[1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:17.240]  online threats this is
[1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:19.240]  out of the Roanoke Times
[1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:21.240]  the major paper in Roanoke, Virginia
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:23.240]  and it says he went on
[1:13:23.240 --> 1:13:25.240]  infowars.com you can read this at infowars.com
[1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:27.240]  we have links to it it says he
[1:13:27.240 --> 1:13:29.240]  went on my site
[1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:31.240]  and because I remember seeing the post
[1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:33.240]  and calling Curt Nimmo saying delete it because we don't even
[1:13:33.240 --> 1:13:35.240]  have full-time moderators we got to get them or shut it down
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:37.240]  I think I'll just
[1:13:37.240 --> 1:13:39.240]  maybe shut the forums down
[1:13:39.240 --> 1:13:41.240]  until we are able to hire the moderators
[1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:43.240]  maybe that's the answer
[1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:45.240]  but then if the money doesn't come in I can't do it
[1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:47.240]  but side issue
[1:13:49.240 --> 1:13:51.240]  it says
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:53.240]  he said go to the cops house
[1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:55.240]  get him get his family
[1:13:55.240 --> 1:13:57.240]  you think this is a threat it isn't it's a promise is what he said here
[1:13:57.240 --> 1:13:59.240]  and I know
[1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:01.240]  I saw the comments I erased them
[1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:03.240]  and the FBI calls it days later and says you erased that
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:05.240]  we want you to put that back up
[1:14:05.240 --> 1:14:07.240]  and I said look
[1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:09.240]  I'm not putting that back up and they said okay well we're going to subpoena you for it
[1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:11.240]  and I said whatever
[1:14:11.240 --> 1:14:13.240]  and the subpoena came in and then another subpoena
[1:14:13.240 --> 1:14:15.240]  and they said well we can't say it has to do with this
[1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:17.240]  tell us about the Obama deception
[1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:19.240]  they were like messing with me trying to make me think it was about that
[1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:21.240]  and asking my employees about
[1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:23.240]  my films and my work
[1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:25.240]  and about me and I was going is this about this guy
[1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:27.240]  making threats or is this about Alex Jones
[1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:29.240]  they'd say sorry I can't tell you that
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:31.240]  but don't talk about it
[1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:33.240]  or you'll be in contempt of federal
[1:14:33.240 --> 1:14:35.240]  grand jury
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:39.240]  and I'm like
[1:14:39.240 --> 1:14:41.240]  okay
[1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:43.240]  so I go talk to my lawyers got to pay for that
[1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:45.240]  and they say well you can say they came in there and subpoenaed you
[1:14:45.240 --> 1:14:47.240]  but no I don't say what it's about
[1:14:47.240 --> 1:14:49.240]  I go hell I can't say what it's about I don't know what it's about
[1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:51.240]  well now we know at least one of them it's this guy
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:53.240]  and
[1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:55.240]  you know the issue is
[1:14:55.240 --> 1:14:57.240]  what he did is wrong and bad
[1:14:57.240 --> 1:14:59.240]  he did is wrong and bad
[1:15:01.240 --> 1:15:03.240]  but what about the cop that did
[1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:05.240]  kill the guy in handcuffs and then lie about it
[1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:07.240]  and try to cover up the video surveillance
[1:15:07.240 --> 1:15:09.240]  which then came out of him executing him in handcuffs
[1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:11.240]  you know he's now been indicted
[1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:13.240]  he's now been arrested and he's going to prison
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:15.240]  see justice is being served
[1:15:15.240 --> 1:15:17.240]  you don't need to go after the cop
[1:15:17.240 --> 1:15:19.240]  or then the guy says go after the guy's family
[1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:21.240]  how dare you
[1:15:21.240 --> 1:15:23.240]  this cop's family's done nothing
[1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:25.240]  we don't torture in America we don't
[1:15:25.240 --> 1:15:27.240]  torture people's family in America
[1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:29.240]  we're the good guys you start doing that
[1:15:29.240 --> 1:15:31.240]  you descend into total tyranny
[1:15:31.240 --> 1:15:33.240]  the BATF murdering those children at Waco
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:35.240]  we don't lower ourselves to the level
[1:15:35.240 --> 1:15:37.240]  of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
[1:15:37.240 --> 1:15:39.240]  formally the BATF
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:41.240]  now the BATFE
[1:15:41.240 --> 1:15:43.240]  we don't lower ourselves to their level
[1:15:43.240 --> 1:15:45.240]  we don't kill children
[1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:47.240]  we don't talk about it
[1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:49.240]  so just like don't walk out in front
[1:15:49.240 --> 1:15:51.240]  of a bus do you deserve life in prison
[1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:53.240]  like you're probably going to get in a federal prison
[1:15:53.240 --> 1:15:55.240]  probably at least to serve 15 years
[1:15:57.240 --> 1:15:59.240]  you probably don't
[1:15:59.240 --> 1:16:01.240]  but they're going to go ahead and throw the book at you
[1:16:01.240 --> 1:16:03.240]  because the cops are scared
[1:16:03.240 --> 1:16:05.240]  they know they're carrying out tyranny
[1:16:05.240 --> 1:16:07.240]  they know the system's imploding and they want to intimidate people
[1:16:07.240 --> 1:16:09.240]  by throwing the book at them for stuff like this
[1:16:09.240 --> 1:16:11.240]  because they're scared
[1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:13.240]  and I don't blame them
[1:16:13.240 --> 1:16:15.240]  they're doing a lot of wrong but a lot of them are doing good
[1:16:15.240 --> 1:16:17.240]  a lot of them aren't bad
[1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:19.240]  and this is rule of law folks
[1:16:19.240 --> 1:16:21.240]  rule of law for the globalist
[1:16:21.240 --> 1:16:23.240]  rule of law for us
[1:16:23.240 --> 1:16:25.240]  now that said, here is the hypocrite and chief
[1:16:25.240 --> 1:16:27.240]  Michael Reagan, I'm not going to play the clip of him saying
[1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:29.240]  do things anally to children
[1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:31.240]  if you want to go watch it on YouTube
[1:16:31.240 --> 1:16:33.240]  you can, I'm not playing that audio here
[1:16:33.240 --> 1:16:35.240]  it's too extreme
[1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:37.240]  he said murder children
[1:16:37.240 --> 1:16:39.240]  I can't even say how he does it
[1:16:39.240 --> 1:16:41.240]  this is Jeffrey Dahmer but this is him saying
[1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:43.240]  kill 9-11 truthers, he'll pay for the bullets
[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:45.240]  soliciting murder and he doesn't get in trouble
[1:16:45.240 --> 1:16:47.240]  but this guy across the country
[1:16:47.240 --> 1:16:49.240]  who doesn't have 8 million listeners
[1:16:49.240 --> 1:16:51.240]  and Gordon says it
[1:16:51.240 --> 1:16:53.240]  and he gets in trouble
[1:16:53.240 --> 1:16:55.240]  which he should but so should Michael
[1:16:55.240 --> 1:16:57.240]  Reagan, here it is
[1:16:57.240 --> 1:16:59.240]  hopefully you get one
[1:16:59.240 --> 1:17:01.240]  well what's going to be going on
[1:17:01.240 --> 1:17:03.240]  mail call is a little bit different now
[1:17:03.240 --> 1:17:05.240]  they're going to be getting mail
[1:17:05.240 --> 1:17:07.240]  but they're not going to be care packages
[1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:09.240]  there is a group that's sending
[1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:11.240]  letters to our troops in Iraq
[1:17:11.240 --> 1:17:13.240]  and DVDs
[1:17:13.240 --> 1:17:15.240]  claiming 9-11
[1:17:15.240 --> 1:17:17.240]  was an inside job
[1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:19.240]  and that they should rethink
[1:17:19.240 --> 1:17:21.240]  why they're fighting
[1:17:21.240 --> 1:17:23.240]  they ought to take these
[1:17:23.240 --> 1:17:25.240]  excuse me folks, I'm going to say this
[1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:27.240]  we ought to find the people who are doing this
[1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:29.240]  take them out and shoot them
[1:17:29.240 --> 1:17:31.240]  really
[1:17:31.240 --> 1:17:33.240]  just find the people who are
[1:17:33.240 --> 1:17:35.240]  sending those letters to our troops
[1:17:35.240 --> 1:17:37.240]  to demoralize our troops and do what they're doing
[1:17:37.240 --> 1:17:39.240]  you take them out, they are traitors of this country
[1:17:39.240 --> 1:17:41.240]  and shoot them
[1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:43.240]  you have a problem with that?
[1:17:43.240 --> 1:17:45.240]  deal with it
[1:17:45.240 --> 1:17:47.240]  anybody who would do that
[1:17:47.240 --> 1:17:49.240]  doesn't deserve to live
[1:17:49.240 --> 1:17:51.240]  you shoot them, you call them traitors
[1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:53.240]  that's what they are
[1:17:53.240 --> 1:17:55.240]  and you shoot them dead
[1:17:55.240 --> 1:17:57.240]  I'll pay for the bullet
[1:17:57.240 --> 1:17:59.240]  Mark Dice
[1:17:59.240 --> 1:18:01.240]  the founder of the resistance
[1:18:01.240 --> 1:18:03.240]  which he calls
[1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:05.240]  a media watchdog group
[1:18:05.240 --> 1:18:07.240]  says that the US government was responsible
[1:18:07.240 --> 1:18:09.240]  for the September 11 terrorist attacks
[1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:11.240]  and that the armed forces should know it
[1:18:11.240 --> 1:18:13.240]  people want the facts
[1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:15.240]  the Marines are hungry for the truth
[1:18:15.240 --> 1:18:17.240]  what got them there in Iraq
[1:18:17.240 --> 1:18:19.240]  why are they risking their lives
[1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:21.240]  and we're going to help them understand that
[1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:23.240]  so he's going to send letters
[1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:25.240]  and
[1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:27.240]  the classified government documents
[1:18:27.240 --> 1:18:29.240]  that he says can prove the government's
[1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:31.240]  responsibility for the terrorist attacks
[1:18:31.240 --> 1:18:33.240]  that killed nearly 3,000 people
[1:18:33.240 --> 1:18:35.240]  and he's urging others to do the same
[1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:41.240]  now
[1:18:41.240 --> 1:18:43.240]  Captain Pete Hexeth
[1:18:43.240 --> 1:18:45.240]  executive director of vets for freedom
[1:18:45.240 --> 1:18:47.240]  you got to get him on too Brad
[1:18:47.240 --> 1:18:49.240]  I'm on it
[1:18:49.240 --> 1:18:51.240]  he says you know something
[1:18:51.240 --> 1:18:53.240]  he's going to end up in the trash
[1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:55.240]  or they're going to end up in the toilet
[1:18:55.240 --> 1:18:57.240]  or they're going to end up
[1:18:57.240 --> 1:18:59.240]  on the firing range
[1:18:59.240 --> 1:19:01.240]  how about you take Mark Dice
[1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:03.240]  out and put him in the middle
[1:19:03.240 --> 1:19:05.240]  of the firing range
[1:19:05.240 --> 1:19:07.240]  tie him to a post
[1:19:07.240 --> 1:19:09.240]  don't blindfold him, let it rip
[1:19:09.240 --> 1:19:11.240]  and have some fun with Mark Dice
[1:19:11.240 --> 1:19:13.240]  these people are just folks
[1:19:13.240 --> 1:19:15.240]  I'm telling you outrageous
[1:19:15.240 --> 1:19:17.240]  now we know where the Ron Paul supporters went
[1:19:17.240 --> 1:19:19.240]  oh my god
[1:19:19.240 --> 1:19:21.240]  the soliciting murder
[1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:23.240]  goes on and on from there
[1:19:23.240 --> 1:19:25.240]  he continues soliciting for murder
[1:19:25.240 --> 1:19:27.240]  right wing military writer
[1:19:27.240 --> 1:19:29.240]  we may have to kill war journalist
[1:19:29.240 --> 1:19:31.240]  we broke this, Kurt Nemo wrote the original story
[1:19:31.240 --> 1:19:33.240]  seeing this video at an EOcon conference
[1:19:33.240 --> 1:19:35.240]  then Raw Story picked it up a few weeks ago
[1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:37.240]  right wing military writer
[1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:39.240]  says kill war journalist
[1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:41.240]  there's video and audio of it
[1:19:41.240 --> 1:19:43.240]  he says kill journalist in America
[1:19:43.240 --> 1:19:45.240]  that criticizes the government
[1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:47.240]  kill them overseas
[1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:49.240]  so see where this is going with our first amendment
[1:19:49.240 --> 1:19:51.240]  so I guess for the FBI
[1:19:51.240 --> 1:19:53.240]  it's okay that he's saying kill us
[1:19:53.240 --> 1:19:55.240]  for our free speech
[1:19:55.240 --> 1:19:57.240]  and Michael Savage says put you in prison
[1:19:57.240 --> 1:19:59.240]  for your free speech
[1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:01.240]  but then when he gets his free speech taken
[1:20:01.240 --> 1:20:03.240]  he whines and viches

[1:22:04.240 --> 1:22:06.240]  humanity Barack Obama
[1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:08.240]  is the tip of the spear
[1:22:08.240 --> 1:22:10.240]  we've got to give them a steak
[1:22:10.240 --> 1:22:12.240]  in creating the kind of world order
[1:22:12.240 --> 1:22:14.240]  that I think all of us would like to see
[1:22:14.240 --> 1:22:16.240]  the Obama deception
[1:22:16.240 --> 1:22:18.240]  completely destroys the myth
[1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:20.240]  that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:22:20.240 --> 1:22:21.240]  of the American people
[1:22:21.240 --> 1:22:23.240]  Obama's already fudging
[1:22:23.240 --> 1:22:25.240]  he's fudged since day one in this election
[1:22:25.240 --> 1:22:27.240]  if you have a demagogue
[1:22:27.240 --> 1:22:29.240]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:22:29.240 --> 1:22:31.240]  who is imposing the program
[1:22:31.240 --> 1:22:33.240]  of a group of extreme bankers
[1:22:33.240 --> 1:22:35.240]  and finance oligarchs
[1:22:35.240 --> 1:22:37.240]  that's fascism
[1:22:37.240 --> 1:22:39.240]  it's not about left or right

[1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:43.240]  this film documents
[1:22:43.240 --> 1:22:45.240]  who Obama works for
[1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:47.240]  the lies he is told

[1:24:23.960 --> 1:24:34.280]  Here's a raw story. And then here's the article he wrote, Kurt Nimmer originally reported on this.
[1:24:34.280 --> 1:24:41.640]  Wishful thinking and indecisive wars. Ralph Peters. This is the top neocon. This is his blog, his words,
[1:24:41.640 --> 1:24:48.200]  what he has to say. It says, pretending to be impartial, the self-cerigating
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:54.840]  personalities drawn to media corrals overwhelmingly take a side, and that side is rarely ours.
[1:24:54.840 --> 1:24:59.320]  That means foreign offshore banks that use us as their Hessian mercenaries. Although it seems
[1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:05.720]  unthinkable now, further future wars may require censorship, news blackouts, and ultimately military
[1:25:05.720 --> 1:25:10.440]  attacks on partisan media. They already do that. They already killed U.S. journalists and their
[1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:14.760]  journalists in Iraq, and they already say they want to kill journalists here. This is a talking
[1:25:14.760 --> 1:25:23.080]  point Glenn Beck puts out about using the military on journalists. This is their system. It goes on,
[1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:29.000]  but freedom of the press stops when it abuses and kills our soldiers and strengthens our enemies.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  Such a view arouses disdain today, but a media establishment that has forgotten any sense of
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:37.880]  sober patriotism may find that it has become tomorrow's conventional wisdom, conventional
[1:25:37.880 --> 1:25:42.920]  wisdom to kill, to kill me, to kill you. Or as Michael Savage said over and over again,
[1:25:42.920 --> 1:25:47.160]  I'm sure you've all heard it, put anybody that disagrees with the war in a forced labor camp,
[1:25:47.160 --> 1:25:50.920]  put us in prison, and his argument was we shouldn't have to pay to have you in prison,
[1:25:50.920 --> 1:26:00.200]  so let's make you work. Now, this is the same thing that was done in Soviet Russia, communist China,
[1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:04.280]  that's been done in every dictatorship in history. You know, they always have their excuse
[1:26:04.280 --> 1:26:08.840]  how they need to do this, and they're training the kids to spy on their parents, and all the
[1:26:08.840 --> 1:26:13.400]  things that go along with tyranny are now happening in our society, and controlling the resources
[1:26:13.400 --> 1:26:19.640]  themselves, you know, resource crimes, carbon credit crimes, carbon footprint crimes.
[1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:26.360]  And he goes on to talk about how they need to kill journalists. So when you hear Michael Reagan
[1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:31.960]  saying that, know that it's very, very serious. But now at least some of the mystery of why
[1:26:31.960 --> 1:26:36.840]  the Secret Service and FBI have been here in multiple visits is cleared up with this latest
[1:26:36.840 --> 1:26:42.440]  news article, because I'm no longer underneath that subpoena, which they still wouldn't tell me
[1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:48.840]  exactly what it was, so I wasn't sure. Hopefully that is the end of it. But that's why we have a
[1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:53.960]  video up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Click on that. Let's just show people that video.
[1:26:53.960 --> 1:26:59.160]  I'm going to play it later in the show where I asked listeners, I should have turned the lights
[1:26:59.160 --> 1:27:03.720]  on and done it all I can hear. I kind of just one night said, Hey, Rob, you know, Saturday,
[1:27:03.720 --> 1:27:07.720]  let's do a promo for the money bomb. I haven't promoted that. So I kind of just the fluorescent
[1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:11.880]  lighting. I'm in here with it all glowing going, Hey, you know, this is our office. Support us
[1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:21.160]  with the money bomb. But I really lay out the points. See, there it is. Alex Jones calls for
[1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:28.040]  aid to expand an info war against the global elite. That's the article. I really explain that
[1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:33.400]  we're having more effect in the fight against the globalists than all of George Soros' funding
[1:27:33.400 --> 1:27:37.160]  for the globalist. I mean, he spent another spent millions and millions of dollars for
[1:27:37.160 --> 1:27:41.400]  these films. They're putting out for free like we do, but pushing carbon taxes, world government.
[1:27:42.680 --> 1:27:46.600]  And we are really, really starting to counter them and really having an effect. And
[1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:51.640]  we have a chance at victory against these people. If folks just take action, but we need
[1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:57.080]  more personnel, bottom line, we need your support to get it done. So infowarsmoneybomb.com
[1:27:57.080 --> 1:28:03.080]  that's coming up on Thursday. If you don't want to support us that way, you can always support
[1:28:03.080 --> 1:28:07.960]  us just by buying the books and videos. I have the new video out Aaron Russo's reflections and
[1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:12.520]  warnings. And that's not really a documentary. It's more of a presentation. I show the interview
[1:28:12.520 --> 1:28:16.680]  I didn't put out for free years ago, but also added footage I hadn't put out some behind the scenes
[1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:23.880]  interviews with him. And of course, I update things with the latest information that film
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:28.280]  needs to be seen. Everybody asked for it. Everybody was requesting. I put it on DVD
[1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:34.840]  and they're just sitting in there. I wish it was hot like the Obama deception or like an end game,
[1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:38.040]  but, you know, Aaron was a hardworking guy and really fought the new world order. And I think
[1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:42.360]  this is a nice testament to what he did and what he said. And it's a key testimony people need.
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:47.800]  So order reflections and warnings with Aaron Russo. We now have three months of the monthly
[1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:52.840]  best of the DVD arsenal. Those are now three months of those are now available. Great interviews
[1:28:52.840 --> 1:29:00.600]  with Ron Paul. You name it footage that we shot sending a crew to the tent cities of California.
[1:29:00.600 --> 1:29:04.680]  And these are really well produced and in high quality cover a host of topics.
[1:29:04.680 --> 1:29:08.600]  We have a states rights section in one of the new videos about the rebellion against the feds
[1:29:08.600 --> 1:29:12.840]  states rights declaring their sovereignty, the states standing up against the new world order.

[1:30:01.560 --> 1:30:06.440]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China
[1:30:06.440 --> 1:30:11.720]  have now penetrated our power grid. Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get
[1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:16.280]  closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid. Some say that this summer's demand
[1:30:16.280 --> 1:30:22.040]  for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages
[1:30:22.040 --> 1:30:27.320]  across the country putting us all in the dark. Are you prepared for the next round of storm
[1:30:27.320 --> 1:30:32.360]  related outages or government created blackouts? Have you ever thought about taking steps to get
[1:30:32.360 --> 1:30:38.200]  off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power? If so, this will be the most
[1:30:38.200 --> 1:30:43.480]  important information you have ever heard. Solar powered generators are finally available. They

[1:33:18.280 --> 1:33:22.120]  and he's one of the great posters and writers at the PrisonPlanet.com forum
[1:33:22.120 --> 1:33:29.880]  and a few years ago we he's one of the volunteer moderators on there trying to keep the feds off
[1:33:29.880 --> 1:33:33.640]  stirring up trouble and calling for the murder of police on there. So we really appreciate him
[1:33:33.640 --> 1:33:37.400]  and I've gotten to know him. He's been a guest on. I talked to some of the state reps. He is the guy
[1:33:37.400 --> 1:33:43.960]  who had the idea back in the early 1990s and went to one of the state representatives in Colorado
[1:33:44.600 --> 1:33:48.760]  and became a volunteer to help get the states rights movement there that passed in Colorado
[1:33:48.760 --> 1:33:52.760]  then passed in Oklahoma and the feds bombed Oklahoma City to try to demonize the Patriot
[1:33:52.760 --> 1:33:58.040]  movement. Now 30 plus states have passed or are passing not succession like the media says.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:04.200]  A declaration of sovereignty saying we're not under federal control. Well he got
[1:34:04.200 --> 1:34:09.880]  SWAT teamed last week and he said I don't want to come on this week. Let me get you the police
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:14.440]  reports. Let me get you the police warrant and we got those. We called. We confirmed that's up
[1:34:14.440 --> 1:34:20.920]  on info wars.com with his his his given name of Jack Travis. That's a great name. Sounds like a
[1:34:20.920 --> 1:34:28.440]  hero in a Louis Lamour book. But whenever he's related to Colonel Travis from Alamo fame
[1:34:29.480 --> 1:34:33.400]  and he got then hit by SWAT team. So we're going to talk to him about 1015 minutes. I'm going to get
[1:34:33.400 --> 1:34:37.560]  into the latest economic news and then cover eugenics and take your calls in the hour after
[1:34:37.560 --> 1:34:42.600]  that. Then in studio former federal treasury agent who exposed the private nature and criminal
[1:34:42.600 --> 1:34:46.520]  nature of the IRS. I'll be in studio with this Joe Bannister. That should be very informative.
[1:34:46.520 --> 1:34:52.440]  I look forward to that. He's traveling through Texas with his son. So that is coming up. I
[1:34:55.320 --> 1:35:02.200]  again want to mention that we have the incident reports. The warrant. It's all posted up on
[1:35:02.200 --> 1:35:08.840]  info wars.com. Nothing you're going to hear here is our opinion. This is cold hard fact
[1:35:08.840 --> 1:35:16.520]  that is up on info wars.com right now with the police phone numbers with the names of the realtor
[1:35:16.520 --> 1:35:22.600]  that call the police on him. This is the incident report. Then there's the warrant. There's the
[1:35:22.600 --> 1:35:31.400]  after action report that is all posted up on info wars.com for anybody that wants to go see this.
[1:35:31.400 --> 1:35:36.280]  We document all of this just like when I tell you the FBI was here and I've been subpoenaed and I'm
[1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:40.040]  allowed to talk about it in a federal subpoena. You're not allowed to because it's an ongoing
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:45.800]  investigation. Well, now I can. It's in the newspaper. Why the FBI was here and all you people
[1:35:45.800 --> 1:35:49.720]  that say we're liars always get made to look like fools later. But again, I understand you. You're
[1:35:49.720 --> 1:35:54.200]  getting paid to do that most of you. It's just it's just unbelievable to be an honest, truthful
[1:35:54.200 --> 1:36:01.880]  person. I have to deal with your crap. Now going back to JT Coyote as he's known on the web and
[1:36:01.880 --> 1:36:10.360]  I guess his name of American name. Um, he's in Colorado, good, upstanding guy, no criminal record,
[1:36:10.360 --> 1:36:14.920]  friends with a sheriff. He gets a visit from the sheriff at night and he says you're about to get
[1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:20.680]  hit by a DEA SWAT team. They saw your guns, some of your reloading stuff and they think it's a meth
[1:36:20.680 --> 1:36:26.520]  lab and that's in the report. Oh, they saw some brass casings. They saw some guns. We think it's
[1:36:26.520 --> 1:36:34.520]  a meth lab because down in his basement bathroom, he was down there doing reloading. And so anything
[1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:38.040]  out of the ordinary, I mean, I see this in the news all the time where they end up killing old
[1:36:38.040 --> 1:36:44.920]  vets and people and I've seen weird inside the LAPD show that I saw probably 10 years ago,
[1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:53.240]  made a big deal out of on air and it was a World War two vet and the neighbors hadn't seen them
[1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:58.600]  in a week. So they go in and he's dead on the floor of a heart attack or stroke. I forget
[1:36:58.600 --> 1:37:03.240]  and the cops come up and go, look at this guy's Bronco. He's got an NRA sticker. What's scum?
[1:37:03.240 --> 1:37:10.360]  And they, and look, he's a World War two vet and they call him scum for having the NRA sticker
[1:37:10.360 --> 1:37:15.560]  and they go in and they just say, look at these gun, you know, these gun nuts, filth and the cops
[1:37:15.560 --> 1:37:20.280]  openly are stealing his guns on TV. They're so criminal. They think it's normal to say, I want
[1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:29.800]  this gun. I want that gun. And, you know, just incredible. And it's the same thing. Now I'm
[1:37:29.800 --> 1:37:33.480]  not saying all police are like this. A lot of cops are good, but I mean, this is on video.
[1:37:33.480 --> 1:37:37.560]  These cops are so evil and so corrupt. It's happening right there. And I've told the famous
[1:37:37.560 --> 1:37:42.440]  story. It's famous now. I've told it probably 50 times, warning people of I used to do my
[1:37:42.440 --> 1:37:47.720]  radio show out of my house and I got a, I didn't have children then. This is like eight years ago
[1:37:47.720 --> 1:37:52.280]  and there was a gun rack with a shotgun, a Winchester Defender, cheap pump shotgun
[1:37:53.640 --> 1:37:59.560]  up there on the wall. And the carpet cleaner said, I can't go in there, sir. And I said,
[1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:03.320]  why? And he goes, that, that gun, isn't that illegal? And I said, why? He goes, well, it's
[1:38:03.320 --> 1:38:08.520]  black and it's, it's looks scary. And I said, well, don't worry, sir, it's up on a gun rack.
[1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:13.080]  It's just for self-defense up there. And, you know, since they're locked up as I have kids,
[1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:18.840]  but I can still get in them quickly. And he, he looked upset and I said, look, the second
[1:38:18.840 --> 1:38:24.040]  then that isn't illegal. I said, I know you, I said, you watch a lot of TV, don't you? You know,
[1:38:24.040 --> 1:38:33.240]  my spiel. And he said, huh? And, and as, and he said, look, look, I just not going to clean that
[1:38:33.240 --> 1:38:37.640]  room. And I said, okay, fine. I said, but I'm going to, you know, not pay for it because I,
[1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:45.000]  you know, already agreed to a contract to clean the whole house. And I guess I'm recounting this
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:49.480]  too slowly with too much to tell to make a long story short. I had this tendency to kind of flash
[1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:56.760]  back to the actual events and creep along telling it, but I pick up a newspaper article because
[1:38:56.760 --> 1:39:00.600]  I'd just been in the front page of the Metro and state at a pro second amendment rally.
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:06.120]  And I just caught bribery at the Capitol on video. And so it was a picture of me shouting at the
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:11.080]  Capitol. And I said, see, Alex Jones, you know, protesting for second amendment rights at the
[1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:16.680]  Capitol. And here's another story right by it about house ethics committee says payments illegal.
[1:39:16.680 --> 1:39:21.880]  I said, see, it's Texas. It guns aren't illegal. I go, I know you watch TV and the shows are based
[1:39:21.880 --> 1:39:26.840]  in New York where guns are illegal. And I sure you serve those gun shops all over town. And the
[1:39:26.840 --> 1:39:30.600]  guy kind of got mad. Like I was trying to act like I was smart or something. He was real stupid.
[1:39:31.400 --> 1:39:35.560]  He was a white guy. I still remember him because we're the carpet cleaner place. You have the
[1:39:35.560 --> 1:39:40.120]  main carpet guy, then you have his his assistant that drags it along behind him. It was this
[1:39:40.120 --> 1:39:45.480]  Hispanic guy. And that guy kind of got mad and walked outside and the Hispanic guy goes, yeah,
[1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:48.760]  he's an idiot. He does this all the time. I think I'm going to quit this job.
[1:39:50.200 --> 1:39:54.360]  And then they leave and I have a bad feeling a couple hours later. So I call the carpet cleaner
[1:39:54.360 --> 1:40:00.920]  place with Stanley steamer carpet cleaner. And I call Stanley steamer carpet cleaner.
[1:40:00.920 --> 1:40:06.840]  And I say, yeah, this is Alex Jones. I had a carp player here and he goes, and it's the
[1:40:06.840 --> 1:40:16.520]  manager. Yes, I know. Yes. Oh, yes, you know. Yes, you know. And he said,
[1:40:18.920 --> 1:40:21.800]  he said, how can I help you? And I said, well, one of your guys was acting all freaked out about
[1:40:21.800 --> 1:40:26.680]  a shotgun in my office up on a gun rack. And I said, that's completely legal. And he goes,
[1:40:26.680 --> 1:40:30.200]  I know, I know, we're not calling the police. And I said, you're not calling the police. He
[1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:35.000]  was no, it was discussed. We explained you're allowed to have a firearm, but he's not comfortable
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:39.640]  around it. So, you know, he didn't clean the room. And I said, well, whatever. Then I go on
[1:40:39.640 --> 1:40:44.040]  access TV that night and the Hispanic helper calls in to the show. And it's his same voice.
[1:40:44.040 --> 1:40:48.360]  And he says, Hey, Alex, just wanted you to know that I didn't want to say anything today that
[1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:52.200]  I'm a fan too. And I got an argument with that guy and he did try to call the cops at the office
[1:40:52.200 --> 1:41:01.560]  and they fired me today. So they fired the guy, the helper, the assistant because he got an argument
[1:41:01.560 --> 1:41:06.680]  explaining this is crazy. And there was reportedly some big debate and they almost called the cops
[1:41:06.680 --> 1:41:16.200]  on me. This is America folks. So now we go to JT Coyote joining us from Colorado JT Coyote in a
[1:41:16.200 --> 1:41:23.960]  nutshell, tell folks what happened. Well, Alex, it was pretty crazy. It's good talking to you,
[1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:28.120]  by the way. Good having you on with us. Glad you weren't killed by the SWAT team.
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:35.000]  Man, I tell you, it could have turned ugly real quick. You know, I'm a gunsmith. And I run my
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:42.520]  business out of my home. So, you know, century 21 did well, though. They did their job under,
[1:41:42.520 --> 1:41:50.520]  under infregard. You know, it's just, it's amazing how quickly they worked too. But any time
[1:41:51.400 --> 1:41:57.080]  a federal warrant is issued, you know, they came in, they were two hours late, they came in,
[1:41:57.080 --> 1:42:04.760]  they were supposed to be a one realtor and a buyer that was interested. Not, well, it turned out to
[1:42:04.760 --> 1:42:14.120]  be a, like a convention of century 21 real estate agent. And, you know, I mean, they were interested,
[1:42:14.120 --> 1:42:20.280]  you know, they came in. The one guy was interested in my telescope. Another guy interested in my dog.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:25.880]  And they found out all over the place. Yeah, that's an excuse. They were running probably a black
[1:42:25.880 --> 1:42:30.920]  op. You know, they get, they get kickback goodies for whoever they're at. All they had to do was
[1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:37.000]  see something that they could, that they could say was, and the firearms were secondary. They saw
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:44.040]  my annealing apparatus in the lower bathroom, where I annealed 100 year old cartridge cases to
[1:42:44.040 --> 1:42:49.720]  make them usable again for these old antique firearms, you know, people like to shoot their
[1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:56.200]  old relics. And, but they do describe in the warrant that the guns were seen. Oh, yeah. Oh,
[1:42:56.200 --> 1:43:03.400]  my God. And this is, and it said this is consistent with a meth lab. The firearms mean you're a meth
[1:43:03.400 --> 1:43:10.920]  lab. That's, you know, in, in their head. And so he, this guy goes down and swears a complaint
[1:43:10.920 --> 1:43:16.600]  against me. And because he used that term meth lab that automatically brings in the DEA, so a
[1:43:16.600 --> 1:43:23.480]  federal warrant is issued. Well, the sheriff in the county, anytime a federal warrant is issued,
[1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:30.040]  he has to honor that. And, you know, when he found out that it was me, you know, I've known John for
[1:43:30.040 --> 1:43:35.800]  years. And he goes, Oh, no, we're not going to have one of those in here. Not with him.
[1:43:35.800 --> 1:43:39.400]  Thank God you had a good sheriff who wasn't drunk at the bar at night. He actually was
[1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:44.600]  watching the warrants coming across his desk like he's supposed to. Exactly. John Minor is a
[1:43:44.600 --> 1:43:51.640]  constitutional sheriff par excellence. And he's what everyone prays they have as a sheriff in
[1:43:51.640 --> 1:43:58.280]  their county. He, he was off duty. He hadn't slept. He'd been up, you know, I mean, the
[1:43:58.280 --> 1:44:04.120]  sheriff's work has never done. And, you know, in street clothes, him and the chief of police,
[1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:11.080]  Mark Hamsmith, they both knew that this was I could go ugly because they all know what I do.
[1:44:11.880 --> 1:44:17.080]  And, you know, I keep loaded of weapons around, you know, we live in an area where
[1:44:17.080 --> 1:44:22.680]  well, the biggest drug bust in the county history happened two years ago, two blocks from my house.
[1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:31.240]  So we're, you know, we're in that gray zone between commercial and residential. So, you know,
[1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:37.160]  I'm, I'm, I'm like you, Alex, you got that 357 in the drawer there. I've got, I've got several
[1:44:37.160 --> 1:44:42.120]  right here. You betcha. I got several of them. And, you know, my daughter, she's pretty.
[1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:48.360]  And some of these, some of these young boys from south of the border, she's pretty in that way.
[1:44:48.920 --> 1:44:58.200]  You know, she's, she's, the Indian is favored in her. And she's, you know, she's got stalkers.
[1:44:58.200 --> 1:45:02.680]  She's 17 years old, you know, and you don't know who's going to come through that door.
[1:45:02.680 --> 1:45:12.120]  So the, the, the problem here was the way the whole thing went down in, in town. I mean,
[1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:15.880]  they invented stuff. I don't know. Did you read that incident report?
[1:45:15.880 --> 1:45:21.960]  Oh, it was just absolutely insane. This is, this is how America is. I mean, this is what they do.
[1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:26.840]  Listen, folks, when workers are in your house now and see a bruise on your kid's leg, you don't know
[1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:32.040]  of SWAT teams coming because that's the new, all of America's being converted to the Defense
[1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:36.600]  Department and the private agencies that the defense contractors owning the red lights,
[1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:41.800]  the threat fusion centers, the police training, most of the new college grads are law enforcement
[1:45:41.800 --> 1:45:46.920]  related. Literally, they're converting everything over. So that's how those realtors make their
[1:45:46.920 --> 1:45:53.080]  money is getting a cut off of who they ran out. So they just run around 24 seven, tattling on people.
[1:45:53.080 --> 1:45:57.320]  Or if they can get a property, see, we was telling our house, that's why they're,
[1:45:57.320 --> 1:46:02.840]  they were here. If they can get a property condemned as a meth lab, they can pick it up for nickels
[1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:08.440]  on the dollar. No, I know. I mean, for people that don't know, this country has collapsed already.
[1:46:08.440 --> 1:46:12.040]  People just haven't figured it out yet. It's kind of like somebody dies next to you at the theater
[1:46:12.040 --> 1:46:16.280]  and at the end of the movie, you know, the guy sweeping up the popcorn and then they go, sir,
[1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:19.880]  sir, and they found out he's dead. He's been dead for two hours. Yeah. I mean, the country's pretty
[1:46:19.880 --> 1:46:24.920]  much dead. We might be able to defibrillate it, you know, with some shockers if we wake up now
[1:46:24.920 --> 1:46:29.800]  and do it. But I mean, it's just total tattletales, spies, news admits the kids were being trained
[1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:35.080]  to turn in their parents. This isn't freedom. While the government ships the heroin and cocaine in
[1:46:35.080 --> 1:46:40.040]  and pushes Ritalin and Prozac on the kids JT Coyote. But but but thank God the sheriff came.
[1:46:40.040 --> 1:46:44.440]  He told you now the SWAT team's coming around the door. What happened next? Well, after when
[1:46:44.440 --> 1:46:49.560]  when he showed up, you know, the dog started barking, he showed up him and Mark and they
[1:46:49.560 --> 1:46:54.760]  knocked on the door. They were both dressed in street clothes with their, you know, sheriff blazer
[1:46:54.760 --> 1:47:00.440]  blazers. Neither one of them was armed. They said, JT, we got to talk to you. And I said,
[1:47:00.440 --> 1:47:05.080]  well, come on in. I'll put on a pot of coffee. They said, no, we're going to have to talk outside.
[1:47:05.080 --> 1:47:12.120]  Right. That's when I knew something was up with John. I mean, he apologized profusely. It should
[1:47:12.120 --> 1:47:19.800]  have never gone that way had they contacted the sheriff to begin with. And, you know, he's he
[1:47:19.800 --> 1:47:28.040]  says in about two minutes of a DEA SWAT team is going to be searching your home. And I laughed.
[1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:35.720]  I couldn't believe it. I just and and he gave the high sign. The boys came over and, you know,
[1:47:35.720 --> 1:47:40.200]  John had had prepped them. You know, he says, look, you're in my county. This is going to be
[1:47:40.200 --> 1:47:45.320]  done my way. And they were so anyways, they went around your house and came out and met
[1:47:45.320 --> 1:47:49.080]  and nothing was there. And then one of them shook your hands for doing reloading because a lot of
[1:47:49.080 --> 1:47:54.600]  cops are in the guns. Well, you know, if you walk through my house, Alec, every room, there's at
[1:47:54.600 --> 1:47:59.400]  least four or five firearms waiting up against the wall because you're a gunsmith. You're allowed
[1:47:59.400 --> 1:48:04.200]  to have your job. It's what you do. You're not evil. Exactly. Exactly. That's what I do.
[1:48:04.200 --> 1:48:12.120]  And and and the guys, we sat around for about 20 minutes and we discussed what could have happened
[1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:17.160]  had the sheriff not intervened. They were still acting like you were your friends,
[1:48:17.160 --> 1:48:20.680]  you know, because they the creeps admit they were recording you the whole time you were
[1:48:20.680 --> 1:48:27.320]  friendly talking to the whole thing was going on. And and the thing is that the questions,
[1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:36.040]  you know, I just wanted to know if they were training real estate agents to to identify meth
[1:48:36.040 --> 1:48:44.600]  labs. And the answer to that was yes. And this guy had gone through an 80 hour course,
[1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:53.480]  80 hours. And he's calling my reloading equipment, a meth lab. Now, what does that tell you about
[1:48:53.480 --> 1:48:57.640]  the level of instruction? Well, I would know what reloading equipment was in a half a second.
[1:48:57.640 --> 1:49:02.600]  I've seen it in so many rural homes in my own family. But I guess to them, a big cranking,
[1:49:02.600 --> 1:49:08.040]  you know, stamper, the parts, the casings, I guess it looked like drugs to him. Well,
[1:49:08.040 --> 1:49:15.320]  basically, if all you had in your house was American Idol and Janet Jamison videos,
[1:49:15.320 --> 1:49:19.560]  everything would have been OK. Yeah, but you had guns and we all know that's why this happened.
[1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:22.760]  And yeah, they're taking all these different industry people with InfraGuard
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:27.560]  and training them for anti terror, anti drug. You see these FBI ads about recruiting farmers
[1:49:27.560 --> 1:49:31.720]  to fight al-Qaeda. Once they get to the meeting, it's does your neighbor have a well that's not
[1:49:31.720 --> 1:49:37.880]  metered? Yeah, you know, is your neighbor smoking pot? Is your neighbor not paying taxes? And
[1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:41.480]  people show up to these anti terror meetings and they find out the people are the terrorist.
[1:49:41.480 --> 1:49:45.000]  And they say, oh, we're going to tattle and spoil neighbors to fight al-Qaeda,
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:49.640]  because that sounds reasonable. Then once you get there, it's does your neighbor spank their kids?
[1:49:49.640 --> 1:49:54.920]  And I've shown those news articles and federal documents here on air. This is what everything's
[1:49:54.920 --> 1:49:59.480]  being converted to. Now, what would have happened if the SWAT team would have come kicking in the
[1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:02.920]  door half the time they don't even announce police? You'd have been sitting there. You said
[1:50:02.920 --> 1:50:08.200]  at your computer at night, probably moderatingprisonplanet.com. As a matter of fact, I was on
[1:50:08.200 --> 1:50:14.200]  InfraWars deleting all kinds of stuff because, you know, what you were talking about earlier,
[1:50:14.200 --> 1:50:18.840]  and that's a whole different story. So you're on there deleting, you know, do this to the cops,
[1:50:18.840 --> 1:50:24.600]  kill this, kill that, and then they're coming cops. Alex, the ones that get through are one percent
[1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:30.760]  of the ones that get posted. So it's just insane. It's insane. And, you know, and, you know, I,
[1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:36.120]  for me, it's exciting because I, at that time of the day. No, no, I'm not griping at you and the
[1:50:36.120 --> 1:50:40.360]  three or four volunteer moderators. I'm saying I got to get full-time people here doing it,
[1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:46.840]  or get rid of it, because it's like just FBI people popping up, Secret Service here at the office,
[1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:50.760]  subpoenas and guys with guns and sunglasses. And I mean, it's getting out of control.

[1:55:20.160 --> 1:55:23.320]  you know just thirty years ago forty years ago my dad going to public
[1:55:23.320 --> 1:55:24.040]  school
[1:55:24.040 --> 1:55:26.240]  he would bring his shotgun to school
[1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:29.120]  he go out with friends after school he was going over to their house their
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:29.880]  ranch
[1:55:29.880 --> 1:55:32.520]  he was going to pretty big high school out in the country
[1:55:32.520 --> 1:55:34.880]  he would take his firearms
[1:55:34.880 --> 1:55:36.840]  and uh... now
[1:55:36.840 --> 1:55:38.800]  it's a complete and total freak out

[1:56:10.040 --> 1:56:11.800]  you know to a cannon fight
[1:56:11.800 --> 1:56:14.560]  and and to be clear because you're saying you would you might not have done
[1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:16.080]  it was police
[1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:17.600]  uh... the same you know
[1:56:17.600 --> 1:56:20.200]  you might not have known that was police will know
[1:56:20.200 --> 1:56:21.200]  uh... that the
[1:56:21.200 --> 1:56:24.740]  the what direction they came in i don't have the access to the view
[1:56:24.740 --> 1:56:28.120]  i've got my computer set up to where i can look out the front door
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:29.480]  but i can't see
[1:56:29.480 --> 1:56:33.720]  the direction they came from plus i have a view of all three entrances into
[1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:34.960]  the house
[1:56:34.960 --> 1:56:36.520]  so you know and
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:39.880]  alec i have i have a couple of firearms sitting here and they're loaded in
[1:56:39.880 --> 1:56:41.880]  chamber you know it
[1:56:41.880 --> 1:56:44.240]  you know there's no small children here
[1:56:44.240 --> 1:56:45.600]  so you know it
[1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:46.400]  purely
[1:56:46.400 --> 1:56:47.620]  i'm a gunsmith
[1:56:47.620 --> 1:56:51.800]  you know what you grab one of my old antique rifles
[1:56:51.800 --> 1:56:55.480]  and that's enough to buy your do the paper your drug habit
[1:56:55.480 --> 1:56:56.480]  for a month
[1:56:56.480 --> 1:56:58.600]  because some of these are worth
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:00.600]  many thousands of dollars
[1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:02.360]  and so you know this
[1:57:02.360 --> 1:57:06.120]  this whole thing could have gotten ugly real quick and and the sheriff knew
[1:57:06.120 --> 1:57:07.280]  that
[1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:12.160]  and it's all because you needed those guys a favor those d a guys a favor
[1:57:12.160 --> 1:57:17.120]  they'll stop the drugs stop the government shipping and and bozos know that
[1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:18.000]  now they uh...
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:21.120]  uh... this is but i mean i mean the issue is uh...
[1:57:21.120 --> 1:57:22.200]  j.c. county
[1:57:22.200 --> 1:57:23.560]  is that
[1:57:23.560 --> 1:57:25.080]  you can't
[1:57:25.080 --> 1:57:26.520]  have the services
[1:57:26.520 --> 1:57:28.840]  you can't just have a real tour in your house
[1:57:28.840 --> 1:57:31.520]  you you know you can't just have a plumber in your house
[1:57:31.520 --> 1:57:34.600]  and not all of them are doing this with the big outfits generally are it's that
[1:57:34.600 --> 1:57:37.720]  it's the big but there was a section there too well i should have realized
[1:57:37.720 --> 1:57:39.720]  that our realtor was told
[1:57:39.720 --> 1:57:41.960]  that it would be one realtor and a
[1:57:41.960 --> 1:57:45.280]  a hot perspective buyer and it ended up being
[1:57:45.280 --> 1:57:48.720]  a group of sentry twenty one realtors
[1:57:48.720 --> 1:57:51.200]  that's that right there is uh...
[1:57:51.200 --> 1:57:53.080]  under false pretenses
[1:57:53.080 --> 1:57:56.840]  so there's that you know we're we're checking the uh... legal ramifications
[1:57:56.840 --> 1:57:58.600]  about because we have the
[1:57:58.600 --> 1:58:00.080]  conversation
[1:58:00.080 --> 1:58:02.760]  between our realtor and this guy
[1:58:02.760 --> 1:58:03.880]  on tape
[1:58:03.880 --> 1:58:05.840]  uh... it was on an answering
[1:58:05.840 --> 1:58:06.520]  so
[1:58:06.520 --> 1:58:09.880]  you know that this isn't by any means over these guys
[1:58:09.880 --> 1:58:13.000]  there has to be some responsibility for
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  people like
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:16.120]  uh... realtors and
[1:58:16.120 --> 1:58:18.080]  and uh... carpet cleaners

[1:58:20.680 --> 1:58:23.120]  killed you need to pay
[1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:25.760]  and uh... they never do they give a metals

[2:00:38.800 --> 2:00:43.520]  know i've got j.t. coyote on the line he was talking about he is a gunsmith and
[2:00:43.520 --> 2:00:48.520]  the sheriff knows him he's known the community center 21 came by saw some of
[2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:54.040]  his guns saw a reloader and described it as a meth lab and so then the da swat
[2:00:54.040 --> 2:00:58.600]  team team over it and thank god they weren't really corrupted and plant
[2:00:58.600 --> 2:01:02.680]  something on him to legitimize it they said oh sorry and left but I mean I keep
[2:01:02.680 --> 2:01:06.240]  trying to explain to listeners this is an informant society now and they've got
[2:01:06.240 --> 2:01:09.160]  people who think they're trained who are just looking for something because
[2:01:09.160 --> 2:01:12.200]  they're getting money off of it right not actually I'm familiar with the story
[2:01:12.200 --> 2:01:18.240]  because I'm a big fan of your website so I watched I saw the article about JT and
[2:01:18.240 --> 2:01:22.440]  then I've been just listening on the radio on the way here so absolutely and
[2:01:22.440 --> 2:01:26.560]  I just read the article about the CHP California Highway Patrol enlisting
[2:01:26.560 --> 2:01:30.840]  drivers out on the California highways and byways to report out of state
[2:01:30.840 --> 2:01:36.200]  license plates absolutely as if and then that gives them some they think legal
[2:01:36.200 --> 2:01:39.880]  tenuous thing to say oh we got a call about your car
[2:01:39.880 --> 2:01:43.400]  California's full of foreign plates driving around this is literally I've
[2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:46.440]  noticed all these federal training reports and state training they make it as
[2:01:46.440 --> 2:01:49.720]  broad as possible does the guy wear blue jeans does he have a cell phone that's
[2:01:49.720 --> 2:01:54.440]  in these federal reports I'm sure you've seen them are do they have a road almanac
[2:01:54.440 --> 2:01:59.400]  I mean I've got one of those who doesn't have a road atlas so it's just do they
[2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:03.240]  have a libertarian bumper sticker it's it's to get everybody taddling on
[2:02:03.240 --> 2:02:07.760]  everybody well it's right in fact before I left the IRS I did a search warrant
[2:02:07.760 --> 2:02:12.320]  and we saw a bunch of materials in this guy's house and I had those materials in
[2:02:12.320 --> 2:02:16.960]  my own library because I was starting to learn the truth so it's amazing what
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:20.280]  you'll what you'll see that you may possess yourself and they considered
[2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:25.800]  illegal and somehow a problem for a free society so listen I was wearing a
[2:02:25.800 --> 2:02:29.600]  Minuteman shirt at the beach two weeks ago and you would have thought I had a
[2:02:29.600 --> 2:02:33.040]  dead baby on my shirt I mean the people were scared and I could tell it was cops
[2:02:33.040 --> 2:02:37.280]  you know you know someone handsome you know well-built middle-aged with their
[2:02:37.280 --> 2:02:40.080]  wives walking on the beach and because other folks would like walk by not
[2:02:40.080 --> 2:02:44.040]  notice you can tell they were cops and they'd see it and kind of and kind of be
[2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:47.840]  scared just walking back I was about to kill him like I got a big teeth were
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:51.520]  about to grow out and I was about to ah you know just jump I mean what is their
[2:02:51.520 --> 2:02:55.320]  deal well I mean typical of law enforcement is training right and
[2:02:55.320 --> 2:02:58.520]  whenever you get into a situation because you're supposed to be in a
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:02.760]  condition ready for a problem and so I think they're automatically harkening
[2:03:02.760 --> 2:03:06.680]  back to their training and a lot of their training deals more and more with
[2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:10.720]  people like us and you see a tricornered hat that's that's George Washington you
[2:03:10.720 --> 2:03:13.960]  can't have that all right Joe we're gonna see you in an hour thanks for coming
[2:03:13.960 --> 2:03:18.080]  in man thanks Alex great to see you bro JT Cali just finishing up in two minutes

[2:03:21.800 --> 2:03:28.360]  race off info wars in prison plant oh buddy between last Thursday when the
[2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:35.320]  Virginia shooting article showed up and when mine showed up you know because a
[2:03:35.320 --> 2:03:39.480]  lot of people don't like me because I will delete their seven and anytime I
[2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:47.000]  see them they're gone I probably deleted 500 posts off of info wars alone and of
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:55.520]  those good 20% were bordering on direct death threats against the cop or against
[2:03:55.520 --> 2:04:01.640]  me or against the realtor of all things and in that article and you know it
[2:04:01.640 --> 2:04:08.000]  just people forget that just because that they're anonymous doesn't mean that
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:12.760]  they can't be found and when you make the threats like that you're going to be
[2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:18.160]  you know you're you're hurting you're hurting the forum now the prison planet
[2:04:18.160 --> 2:04:24.040]  forum the the regular chat forum where we all started out here a couple years
[2:04:24.040 --> 2:04:28.720]  ago that runs itself because the the people that we have in there we can

[2:08:21.360 --> 2:08:28.040]  I've been talking more and more about eugenics because that's what our society
[2:08:28.040 --> 2:08:32.320]  orbits around the global elite believe there are too many people they're also
[2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:36.880]  targeting intelligent people that could rival them and control the power
[2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:40.880]  structure this is all stated on record we covered my film in-game blueprint for
[2:08:40.880 --> 2:08:45.160]  global enslavement and these are monopoly men they want to control
[2:08:45.160 --> 2:08:51.480]  societies through state controlled systems that conduit the profits to
[2:08:51.480 --> 2:08:56.240]  private offshore interest that are bigger than in any one nation and the
[2:08:56.240 --> 2:09:00.320]  globalist play nations off against each other and and if one nation ever gets to
[2:09:00.320 --> 2:09:03.920]  uppity and tries to defeat the new world order they can then finance and
[2:09:03.920 --> 2:09:07.760]  sick the other countries to go in and take down that country so this is a
[2:09:07.760 --> 2:09:12.280]  system that the elites figured out to keep global empire financial global
[2:09:12.280 --> 2:09:16.920]  empire in place so I'm gonna go over some of that coming up in a few minutes
[2:09:16.920 --> 2:09:24.920]  but what segues into this is this story out of the associated press all
[2:09:24.920 --> 2:09:30.600]  businesses bond market route lifts mortgage cost the Federal Reserve
[2:09:30.600 --> 2:09:35.400]  announced a 1.2 trillion plan three months ago designed to push down
[2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:40.640]  mortgage rates and breathe life into the housing market but this another big
[2:09:40.640 --> 2:09:44.440]  government spending programs are turning out to have the opposite effect we told
[2:09:44.440 --> 2:09:49.040]  you that on October 3rd and 4th and 5th when this stuff passed we said it will
[2:09:49.040 --> 2:09:53.040]  have the opposite effect because the globalist were on record with what they
[2:09:53.040 --> 2:09:57.960]  were gonna do let me continue but this and other big government spending
[2:09:57.960 --> 2:10:00.880]  programs are turning out to have the opposite effect rates for mortgages in
[2:10:00.880 --> 2:10:06.320]  US Treasury debt are now marching higher as nervous bond investors fret about a
[2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:10.840]  reassurgence of inflation that's the cash 22 threatening to make an awful
[2:10:10.840 --> 2:10:15.640]  housing market potentially worse oh the money's gonna make it worse oh you bet
[2:10:15.640 --> 2:10:18.840]  but don't worry then they'll take even more money and make it worse and then
[2:10:18.840 --> 2:10:23.160]  more money and make it worse and you don't like it SWAT teams are swelling
[2:10:23.160 --> 2:10:27.520]  paramilitary forces are ready they're gonna rape us good and if we don't like
[2:10:27.520 --> 2:10:33.280]  it you can go in a ditch and get your head blown off that's the catch 22
[2:10:33.280 --> 2:10:37.440]  threatening to make an awful housing market potentially worse and keep the
[2:10:37.440 --> 2:10:43.000]  economy stuck in a funk kick starting economy requires higher spending but
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:46.640]  rising rates means fewer Americans will be able to refinance their home loans
[2:10:46.640 --> 2:10:50.920]  and some potential buyers will be shut out of the market by higher monthly
[2:10:50.920 --> 2:10:55.080]  payments they won't be able to afford to understand how this is all connected
[2:10:55.080 --> 2:10:59.520]  you have to think like a bond trader and it goes on okay let's stop right there
[2:10:59.520 --> 2:11:04.680]  this is the media trying to explain why nobody for the last year as they've
[2:11:04.680 --> 2:11:09.320]  been injecting these trillions because they had all those spending packages
[2:11:09.320 --> 2:11:12.960]  before the October 3rd thing eight months ago so we're a year into all
[2:11:12.960 --> 2:11:18.720]  this spending 14.8 trillion plus just in the US over 10 trillion globally from
[2:11:18.720 --> 2:11:23.440]  Japan to Iceland to Greenland to Germany to France to Belgium to Mexico
[2:11:23.440 --> 2:11:29.960]  they're all spending from Holland to Denmark to Romania to Hungary to Russia
[2:11:29.960 --> 2:11:34.480]  I mean it's Europe and England alone it was 10 trillion last time I checked and
[2:11:34.480 --> 2:11:38.400]  the US is 14.8 trillion a month ago so I don't know it's just unbelievable amounts
[2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:43.800]  of money now now what is this this isn't just governments creating money
[2:11:43.800 --> 2:11:48.800]  they're going to the private central banks and saying so our fiat money has
[2:11:48.800 --> 2:11:53.040]  value you know we're controlled by your private central banks we're going to
[2:11:53.040 --> 2:11:58.640]  borrow this let's say 30 trillion it's probably more than that globally 30
[2:11:58.640 --> 2:12:04.520]  trillion dollars from you and then we're gonna give the 30 trillion we borrow to
[2:12:04.520 --> 2:12:11.200]  you we're gonna borrow 30 trillion and give it to you but it gets better I mean
[2:12:11.200 --> 2:12:19.000]  this scheme doesn't stop there this scheme doesn't stop there then we're
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:23.960]  going to pay compound interest to the very banks that we are giving the money
[2:12:23.960 --> 2:12:29.480]  to now if you study the IMF World Bank documents that were released in late
[2:12:29.480 --> 2:12:33.760]  2001 early 2002 BBC reported on it Joseph Stick let's quit and spoke about it
[2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:38.200]  chief economist the World Bank Nobel Prize winner we've had him on the show
[2:12:38.200 --> 2:12:41.200]  and you look what they've done in third-world nations for hundreds of
[2:12:41.200 --> 2:12:46.400]  years this is standard what John Perkins talks about the economic hitman this is
[2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:55.040]  standard operating procedure they the the big central banks are hoarding the
[2:12:55.040 --> 2:12:59.800]  30 plus trillion so they don't have to spend any money they're using federal
[2:12:59.800 --> 2:13:04.680]  regulators to go out and sees healthy regional and local banks and credit
[2:13:04.680 --> 2:13:10.280]  bureaus and and credit unions and insurance companies openly the federal
[2:13:10.280 --> 2:13:14.200]  regulators come into banks that are solvent and say the fed say you're
[2:13:14.200 --> 2:13:17.440]  under and they give the CEO a golden parachute look you're gonna get 20
[2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:21.720]  million if you shut up if not we see you know everybody's got irregularities
[2:13:21.720 --> 2:13:25.280]  there's no way to follow the rules they pass all these laws so high that no one
[2:13:25.280 --> 2:13:29.360]  can follow them then then no one is forced to take them and follow them but
[2:13:29.360 --> 2:13:32.720]  then they selectively enforce on who they want you understand how that works
[2:13:32.720 --> 2:13:36.880]  they say look we found a few regularities take the 20 million you'll be on
[2:13:36.880 --> 2:13:41.000]  the board of one of our subsidiaries or if you talk about what's happening and
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  don't turn your bank over we're gonna put you in prison and they go by the way
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:47.360]  we got FBI standing by right outside you know these are federal regulators you're
[2:13:47.360 --> 2:13:51.200]  gonna hand over that you know this bank and all these farmers and this whole
[2:13:51.200 --> 2:13:55.280]  co-ops money same thing with co-op water systems and power systems and
[2:13:55.280 --> 2:13:59.520]  everything it's all just mafia they march in in suits with guns and say
[2:13:59.520 --> 2:14:03.320]  we're here we're taking over you can have the money or you can go to prison and
[2:14:03.320 --> 2:14:08.840]  so all of that is going on with the economy and I said this on October 3rd
[2:14:08.840 --> 2:14:14.520]  I'm begging listeners to go back to my October 3rd October 4th October 5th last
[2:14:14.520 --> 2:14:18.320]  time I asked listeners to do this where we predicted that they were gonna cut
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:22.160]  fuel prices by at least half because Bilderberg had said so and people
[2:14:22.160 --> 2:14:25.680]  went and found those clips of me over a year ago saying it then I asked people
[2:14:25.680 --> 2:14:29.400]  to find where I said they're gonna launch a fake flu in the next few months I
[2:14:29.400 --> 2:14:34.000]  said that March 5th and it happened a month and a half later exactly as I
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:37.840]  said I understand the enemy but I don't even have the personnel to go find all
[2:14:37.840 --> 2:14:40.600]  those clips I didn't then put it with this new clip because that really
[2:14:40.600 --> 2:14:44.080]  impresses the slaves and I want to show the slaves we're not making this stuff
[2:14:44.080 --> 2:14:47.640]  up so that's a something for the volunteers you want to help us out
[2:14:47.640 --> 2:14:51.000]  there the great prison planet dot TV things then I've got to make sure we get
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:54.720]  it and get it posted on info wars dot com prison planet dot com but my guys are
[2:14:54.720 --> 2:14:58.080]  so overworked they miss half the great stuff people do and send us so it doesn't
[2:14:58.080 --> 2:15:01.280]  have as big an effect so we've got to hire more people that goes back to the
[2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:05.480]  same catch 22 of I don't like having to grub and raise money and try to hustle
[2:15:05.480 --> 2:15:08.720]  to get the money in to fund this thing because then it takes the time away from
[2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:12.560]  everything else I'm doing then I got to have the money to run the operation but
[2:15:12.560 --> 2:15:20.000]  I digress now I digress big time there the point I wanted to finish up making
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:31.240]  about all of this is that they take $30 trillion and they stop lending the
[2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:35.080]  $30 trillion wasn't to get them lending the $30 trillion was so they can sit out
[2:15:35.080 --> 2:15:40.000]  buy up healthy banks insurance companies credit unions and buy up ports
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:43.760]  roads infrastructures for pennies on the dollar they usually just buy off the
[2:15:43.760 --> 2:15:47.160]  state senators and people on record then the state senators are allowed to own
[2:15:47.160 --> 2:15:50.600]  their own private banks over the toll roads like we have locally in central
[2:15:50.600 --> 2:15:55.840]  Texas with the same state senator who is openly pushing the CPS not have to
[2:15:55.840 --> 2:15:59.440]  have warrants when they kidnap your kids that's open I mean you can't make this
[2:15:59.440 --> 2:16:02.640]  stuff up how criminal these people are on record and I've called them out as
[2:16:02.640 --> 2:16:07.440]  criminal by name and you know they don't respond because they know it's true so I
[2:16:07.440 --> 2:16:11.600]  told everybody over and over and over again they were going to use these tens
[2:16:11.600 --> 2:16:14.480]  of trillions of dollars to buy up the infrastructure for pennies on the
[2:16:14.480 --> 2:16:19.040]  dollar because by imploding the economy the banks now get to come in with the
[2:16:19.040 --> 2:16:23.880]  tens of trillions of fiat currency and buy everything up then they buy up real
[2:16:23.880 --> 2:16:27.480]  assets then the tens of trillions they've printed and issued and credit to
[2:16:27.480 --> 2:16:31.240]  themselves then it hits his hyperinflation but they don't care because
[2:16:31.240 --> 2:16:34.720]  they've already bought brick and mortar and superconducting supercolliders and
[2:16:34.720 --> 2:16:40.720]  power plants and battleship factories and cruise missile factories and ABC and
[2:16:40.720 --> 2:16:47.560]  CBS and Fox and CNN see how that works this is conquering right now they
[2:16:47.560 --> 2:16:51.760]  destroy confidence panic everybody and say let us have unlimited money let us
[2:16:51.760 --> 2:16:55.480]  be totally secretive about where the money goes let us be totally secretive
[2:16:55.480 --> 2:16:59.840]  about what we do with it we're above the law pass that in the bill allow us to
[2:16:59.840 --> 2:17:04.720]  keep all the money for ourselves and we'll turn the economy back on so it's
[2:17:04.720 --> 2:17:10.320]  done the American people weren't suckered 98% in Gallup polls 2001 phone
[2:17:10.320 --> 2:17:14.040]  calls to Congress saying we don't want the bailout they still do it it's
[2:17:14.040 --> 2:17:19.920]  criminal it's unconstitutional it's wrong it's out of control it's evil it's bad
[2:17:19.920 --> 2:17:25.080]  it's larceness it's it's completely criminal openly and publicly the people
[2:17:25.080 --> 2:17:29.000]  don't want it it's unconstitutional doesn't matter it happens and then
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:35.920]  lending is totally shut off as soon as they got the money that's what they
[2:17:35.920 --> 2:17:40.200]  always do in the third world they always come in engineer collapse in Argentina
[2:17:40.200 --> 2:17:45.680]  or in Nigeria or in Sri Lanka or you know hundreds of countries they've done
[2:17:45.680 --> 2:17:49.800]  this to or in Eastern Europe in Hungary or in the Czech Republic and then
[2:17:49.800 --> 2:17:52.960]  documents come out later they're all public where they brag how they set this
[2:17:52.960 --> 2:17:59.160]  up in the 70s and 80s and 90s and 2000 and 2003 and 2005 and the Asian crisis in
[2:17:59.160 --> 2:18:03.840]  the late 90s they do this over and over again they come in they panic people with
[2:18:03.840 --> 2:18:06.640]  the media they own they've bought off the politicians they say we've got to go
[2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:12.040]  into debt 20 billion dollars the IMF World Bank that's it 30% interest and a
[2:18:12.040 --> 2:18:15.600]  20 billion dollar loan five years later is a hundred billion dollar debt they've
[2:18:15.600 --> 2:18:18.200]  already paid back you know a hundred billion and still another hundred
[2:18:18.200 --> 2:18:23.520]  billion just on the interest and they always say we got to have this spending
[2:18:23.520 --> 2:18:28.040]  package to get the Brazilian economy going to get the Argentinian economy
[2:18:28.040 --> 2:18:34.120]  going and it doesn't do that so we now are in the clutches of what the globalists
[2:18:34.120 --> 2:18:37.680]  have done to third world countries and as things get worse and worse they'll
[2:18:37.680 --> 2:18:41.160]  say oh well Obama youth brigades will save us and if you're against that you
[2:18:41.160 --> 2:18:44.800]  don't want to get the economy going and federalization will fix things and local
[2:18:44.800 --> 2:18:49.600]  federal hospitals at the old army base and yeah there's a stockade to there's
[2:18:49.600 --> 2:18:53.360]  been a lot of homeless people a lot of rioting there's a federal stockade yeah
[2:18:53.360 --> 2:18:57.720]  there's a federal stockade at pier 57 in New York and there's a federal stockade
[2:18:57.720 --> 2:19:02.680]  at the old Austin Robert Mueller Airport and yeah there's a federal stockade here
[2:19:02.680 --> 2:19:07.480]  and there's a federal stockade there we got to do it society's collapsing after
[2:19:07.480 --> 2:19:13.600]  all and see as the bankers make society implode crime explode because of people
[2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:17.640]  being hungry and starving and or not getting their welfare checks and wanting
[2:19:17.640 --> 2:19:22.240]  drug money whatever the case may be as things unravel and fall apart more and
[2:19:22.240 --> 2:19:27.320]  more there there is the central power with more police more military oh we're
[2:19:27.320 --> 2:19:30.440]  sorry you got to put troops on the streets but there's rioting and starving
[2:19:30.440 --> 2:19:34.360]  people oh we're sorry the banks had to be given unlimited power and control it
[2:19:34.360 --> 2:19:40.520]  was done for your own interest but here it is in the AP admitting they took
[2:19:40.520 --> 2:19:44.800]  those trillions and then hoarded it for themselves not just for bonuses but to
[2:19:44.800 --> 2:19:50.480]  go buy healthy banks so that they then turn off lending they got to shut down
[2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:54.280]  the local banks from lending they got to keep them from lending and saving the
[2:19:54.280 --> 2:19:58.800]  economy they get you addicted to debt then they totally cut it off bankrupt
[2:19:58.800 --> 2:20:03.760]  everything and then consolidate the whole pod the word catastrophe is defined

[2:21:34.200 --> 2:21:38.480]  servicing debt is this capitalism or was Jefferson correct when he said a
[2:21:38.480 --> 2:21:42.320]  central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of
[2:21:42.320 --> 2:21:46.440]  the people in a standing army hi Ted Anderson I'm placing a silver dollar
[2:21:46.440 --> 2:21:50.160]  inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works call for your
[2:21:50.160 --> 2:21:58.320]  copy 1-800-686-2237 isn't it time to understand the system call 800-686-2237
[2:21:58.320 --> 2:22:05.840]  that's 800-686-2237 in the New World Order's war against humanity Barack
[2:22:05.840 --> 2:22:10.440]  Obama is the tip of the spear we've got to have a civilian national security
[2:22:10.440 --> 2:22:16.240]  force that's just as powerful just as strong just as well funded the Obama

[2:24:26.400 --> 2:24:29.640]  about this some last week but I want to talk about it now you understand what
[2:24:29.640 --> 2:24:33.480]  the bankers are doing they're bankrupting the world economy by design hoarding
[2:24:33.480 --> 2:24:39.240]  all the tens of trillions they said you must pass this October 3rd on that
[2:24:39.240 --> 2:24:44.880]  Friday the banker takeover bill not a bailout the bill gave him unlimited
[2:24:44.880 --> 2:24:48.760]  anonymity power secrecy nobody can investigate him but that's a fraudulent
[2:24:48.760 --> 2:24:54.120]  bill and you got all these congressmen on record saying banks openly run
[2:24:54.120 --> 2:24:58.680]  Congress both parties this is the takeover this is just a ruthless criminal
[2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:02.560]  takeover and remember they said we will have a depression by next week the
[2:25:02.560 --> 2:25:07.440]  stock market will plunge everything will end this was on Monday if you don't
[2:25:07.440 --> 2:25:12.520]  pass this and the stock market fell over 1500 points all the yuppies panicked
[2:25:12.520 --> 2:25:17.360]  and so it went from 2000 to one phone calls they were saying about 100 to one
[2:25:17.360 --> 2:25:22.600]  in Congress that was their support you know having a 98% against it and if you
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:25.920]  said I don't like it but I guess we have to and then they went ahead and ran the
[2:25:25.920 --> 2:25:29.200]  stock market down a few thousand points more out of panic and they ran it back
[2:25:29.200 --> 2:25:34.640]  up with fiat currency now they took all that money horded into themselves and
[2:25:34.640 --> 2:25:39.760]  the Saturday after one day after they passed it Paulson said you know what
[2:25:39.760 --> 2:25:43.160]  we're not going to spend any of it for unclogging bad debt now that's not the
[2:25:43.160 --> 2:25:46.240]  problem which it was really true but he knew that to begin with it was
[2:25:46.240 --> 2:25:49.880]  derivatives the tens of trillions it was to pay them off on their derivatives the
[2:25:49.880 --> 2:25:53.320]  big banks and so they kept all that money and now they're using it to buy up
[2:25:53.320 --> 2:25:57.600]  banks in the times of London admits financial times of London admits excuse
[2:25:57.600 --> 2:26:02.520]  me that they're using this money to consolidate banks in fact Google that
[2:26:02.520 --> 2:26:07.440]  people so they can see it big banks using tart money to buy other banks or to
[2:26:07.440 --> 2:26:11.040]  buy other institutions show people at prison planet TV it'll be hundreds of
[2:26:11.040 --> 2:26:15.200]  articles they admit all this in financial pages they just never call it the
[2:26:15.200 --> 2:26:21.920]  outrage it is this is a formula just like I said in the first hour like making
[2:26:21.920 --> 2:26:26.320]  pancakes I mean if I had some native in my house that had never seen pancakes
[2:26:26.320 --> 2:26:31.840]  made and they saw me suddenly take a box of canned stuff and dump it in a bowl
[2:26:31.840 --> 2:26:36.160]  and stir it and make pancakes they think it was amazing it's not amazing it's a
[2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:44.960]  set formula shaken back I mean that's all it is it is a formulaic system where
[2:26:44.960 --> 2:26:48.720]  they create these bubbles get everybody in debt everybody gets real passive goes
[2:26:48.720 --> 2:26:51.720]  along with the tyranny while it's being set up goes along with foreign wars they
[2:26:51.720 --> 2:26:55.560]  get lots of cheap money then they implode it everything falls apart the
[2:26:55.560 --> 2:26:58.640]  banks get more power and money the name of unclogging things they use that to
[2:26:58.640 --> 2:27:03.360]  further freeze things they set out where everything falls apart so they can
[2:27:03.360 --> 2:27:07.480]  consolidate they love the fact that real estate's going down they love the fact
[2:27:07.480 --> 2:27:10.240]  that everything's falling apart they love the fact that US industries are all
[2:27:10.240 --> 2:27:13.640]  going bankrupt and that governments coming in and seizing them and saying
[2:27:13.640 --> 2:27:17.840]  here fee out of Europe owned by a Bilderberg group member that we
[2:27:17.840 --> 2:27:24.880]  videotape and put in endgame my film here you get Chrysler that's been bailed
[2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:31.480]  out over and over again by the US government oh here Europe and Russia
[2:27:31.480 --> 2:27:40.600]  get these parts of GM and China gets these sections of GM and Brazil you get
[2:27:40.600 --> 2:27:45.800]  the Saturn line I mean have you read the news they're taking it all there's gonna
[2:27:45.800 --> 2:27:50.000]  be a few factories left here to build a few things and that's gonna be
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:53.520]  government run while the rest is given to globalist and you go look at the
[2:27:53.520 --> 2:27:56.720]  companies all of their CEOs are Bilderberg group members the three or
[2:27:56.720 --> 2:28:03.080]  four companies being given G General Motors as GM goes so goes the nation
[2:28:03.080 --> 2:28:08.600]  they're just giving it away and they all and and and their subplots within
[2:28:08.600 --> 2:28:12.360]  subplots they debate 30 billion to GM all day instead of tens of trillions to
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:16.680]  foreign banks and bitching complain and say oh the GM doesn't deserve it we
[2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:22.280]  shouldn't you know that there's gonna be tough decisions to save GM and instead
[2:28:22.280 --> 2:28:27.600]  they take the money and use that to offshore GM
[2:28:27.600 --> 2:28:47.400]  absolutely incredible absolutely amazing it is just so mind-blowing to see
[2:28:47.400 --> 2:28:52.240]  this going on to know this is going on to know this is happening and to know
[2:28:52.240 --> 2:28:57.880]  that this is only the beginning to know that they are only going to intensify all
[2:28:57.880 --> 2:29:03.480]  of this to know that they are only going to expand all of this to know that
[2:29:03.480 --> 2:29:09.580]  they are only going to make this worse and worse and worse and worse and worse
[2:29:09.580 --> 2:29:20.440]  and worse it's unbelievable it's horrible and to know that the public
[2:29:20.440 --> 2:29:23.520]  has been trained to trust the government and the media, even though they're figuring out
[2:29:23.520 --> 2:29:28.000]  they're being lied to at certain levels now, they can't help it.
[2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:33.520]  They're just giving in to all of this, at least passively, thinking, well, I guess the
[2:29:33.520 --> 2:29:34.520]  government will work it out.
[2:29:34.520 --> 2:29:37.040]  I guess everything's going to turn out to be okay.
[2:29:37.040 --> 2:29:42.120]  No, it's not going to be all right, like Professor Griff says in the Obama deception.
[2:29:42.120 --> 2:29:44.080]  Everything is not going to be all right.
[2:29:44.080 --> 2:29:46.000]  The more of this we put up with, the worse it's going to get.
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:49.640]  These are ruthless, arrogant, bold usurpers.
[2:29:49.640 --> 2:29:52.000]  We'll cover the eugenics thing when we get back.
[2:29:52.000 --> 2:29:55.720]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[2:29:55.720 --> 2:30:01.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:01.560 --> 2:30:06.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:07.000]  this summer.
[2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:10.880]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:30:10.880 --> 2:30:15.440]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:30:15.440 --> 2:30:16.680]  allows you to have.
[2:30:16.680 --> 2:30:21.840]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:30:21.840 --> 2:30:25.960]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[2:30:25.960 --> 2:30:28.360]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[2:30:28.360 --> 2:30:31.920]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[2:30:31.920 --> 2:30:35.600]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[2:30:35.600 --> 2:30:40.120]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:30:40.120 --> 2:30:44.280]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:30:44.280 --> 2:30:45.960]  a longtime sponsor of ours.

[2:31:07.000 --> 2:31:08.000]  important than ever.

[2:31:10.720 --> 2:31:13.760]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[2:31:13.760 --> 2:31:17.640]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[2:31:17.640 --> 2:31:20.040]  in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[2:31:20.040 --> 2:31:23.280]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation with you.

[2:34:08.100 --> 2:34:16.020]  the facets going over everything they did, it is absolutely mind blowing to see the
[2:34:16.020 --> 2:34:21.860]  eugenics they're pushing and the things they're saying and the things they're doing.
[2:34:21.860 --> 2:34:24.420]  Just absolutely mind blowing.
[2:34:24.420 --> 2:34:27.620]  This is how the psychology works.
[2:34:27.620 --> 2:34:34.380]  In these TV shows, in these movies, they basically say you're going to be paying $9 a gallon
[2:34:34.380 --> 2:34:42.900]  of milk or for half gallon of milk because the earth is dying.
[2:34:42.900 --> 2:34:45.860]  They say humans, because there's too many humans, that's why you're not going to do
[2:34:45.860 --> 2:34:47.180]  well resource-wise.
[2:34:47.180 --> 2:34:51.180]  So they're setting up a classic resource war between humans and humans with the state
[2:34:51.180 --> 2:34:55.780]  moderating this ultimate divide and conquer and then only the carbon credits and only
[2:34:55.780 --> 2:34:59.300]  eugenics and only population control can save us.
[2:34:59.300 --> 2:35:09.620]  And that's what's all over the news as world leaders meet to push for population reduction
[2:35:09.620 --> 2:35:15.220]  and world leaders push for tax on cars and all airline travel and a tax on oil at the
[2:35:15.220 --> 2:35:16.220]  wellhead.
[2:35:16.220 --> 2:35:19.980]  Going to the private banks, it's not enough to the banks to have the governments give
[2:35:19.980 --> 2:35:22.460]  them tens of trillions of dollars and bankrupt everything.
[2:35:22.460 --> 2:35:25.060]  Now they want to have you pay taxes directly to them.
[2:35:25.060 --> 2:35:26.260]  How do we know this decades ago?
[2:35:26.260 --> 2:35:30.100]  The Bilderberg group's own minutes say that, now it's been announced all over the news.
[2:35:30.100 --> 2:35:33.020]  Now the yuppies can't deny this.
[2:35:33.020 --> 2:35:35.220]  But see, the yuppies feel like they're part of the establishment.
[2:35:35.220 --> 2:35:38.820]  They think they're David Rockefeller because they make $100,000 a year, they're complete
[2:35:38.820 --> 2:35:39.820]  idiots.
[2:35:39.820 --> 2:35:43.340]  We've got to explain to them through self-preservation, they've got to wake up and realize they're
[2:35:43.340 --> 2:35:44.820]  not part of the establishment.
[2:35:44.820 --> 2:35:48.780]  Same thing with mainline right wing people, mainline leftists, that they're all drinking
[2:35:48.780 --> 2:35:50.660]  different flavors of Kool-Aid.
[2:35:50.660 --> 2:35:56.180]  One's orange, one's grape, one's lemon, one's cherry, but it's all political controlled
[2:35:56.180 --> 2:35:59.500]  limited paradigms that come out of the same Kool-Aid factory.
[2:35:59.500 --> 2:36:03.220]  It's the same crap, sugar and a different flavored dye.
[2:36:03.220 --> 2:36:04.220]  That's the only difference.
[2:36:04.220 --> 2:36:05.980]  It's still from Kool-Aid, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:36:05.980 --> 2:36:07.780]  And they are drinking the Kool-Aid.
[2:36:07.780 --> 2:36:08.780]  And I've got these articles.
[2:36:08.780 --> 2:36:11.940]  Levio International Air Travel could fund climate change flight.
[2:36:11.940 --> 2:36:14.980]  I did it for about 50 least developed countries.
[2:36:14.980 --> 2:36:17.620]  So they pose it like, oh, the poor people want this.
[2:36:17.620 --> 2:36:23.940]  Those are third world nations controlled by the IMF and World Bank in Hawk to infinity.
[2:36:23.940 --> 2:36:29.180]  And twice about green transport, say scientists, yeah, this is out of AP, it says, you worry
[2:36:29.180 --> 2:36:32.180]  a lot about environment and do everything you can to reduce your carbon footprint.
[2:36:32.180 --> 2:36:35.340]  The emissions of greenhouse gases that drive dangerous climate change.
[2:36:35.340 --> 2:36:37.260]  See how they make it sound like it's real?
[2:36:37.260 --> 2:36:38.260]  Oh, it's real.
[2:36:38.260 --> 2:36:42.660]  See, it's just a stated fact now, but then it tells you that some of the climate change
[2:36:42.660 --> 2:36:43.660]  fixes aren't right.
[2:36:43.660 --> 2:36:44.980]  So that makes it sound credible.
[2:36:44.980 --> 2:36:49.860]  It's criticizing the current climate change fixes, but admitting that overall climate
[2:36:49.860 --> 2:36:51.780]  change is man-made and we've got to do it.
[2:36:51.780 --> 2:36:55.500]  And the carbon dioxide, the life-giving gas is evil.
[2:36:55.500 --> 2:37:00.300]  So you always prefer to take the train of the bus rather than plane and avoid using a car
[2:37:00.300 --> 2:37:04.940]  whenever you can, faithful to the belief that this inflicts less harm on the planet.
[2:37:04.940 --> 2:37:07.700]  See reinforcing the lie that cars are bad.
[2:37:07.700 --> 2:37:10.420]  Well, there could be a nasty surprise this war for you.
[2:37:10.420 --> 2:37:14.900]  For taking public transport may be as green, may not be as green as you automatically thinks
[2:37:14.900 --> 2:37:16.380]  as a new U.S. study.
[2:37:16.380 --> 2:37:20.660]  It authors point out that array of factors are often unknown to the public.
[2:37:20.660 --> 2:37:25.860]  These are hidden or displaced emissions that ramp up the simple tailpipe tally, which is
[2:37:25.860 --> 2:37:29.620]  based on how the carbon is spewed out and the fossil fuels that make the trip.
[2:37:29.620 --> 2:37:33.580]  And they go through the bureaucracy in the system and how trains and buses actually have
[2:37:33.580 --> 2:37:35.660]  bigger carbon footprints, which I say good.
[2:37:35.660 --> 2:37:40.460]  I'm actually now four trains and buses because plants breathe carbon dioxide and put out
[2:37:40.460 --> 2:37:42.180]  higher levels of oxygen.
[2:37:42.180 --> 2:37:47.100]  That increases plankton blooms, which increase krill, which increase the smaller feeder fish,
[2:37:47.100 --> 2:37:51.940]  which increase the first level of predator fish right down to the blue whale, right down
[2:37:51.940 --> 2:37:55.100]  to the sperm whale.
[2:37:55.100 --> 2:37:58.420]  In the food chain, they've done the ice core samples.
[2:37:58.420 --> 2:38:02.460]  The earth has had upwards of 14 times higher oxygen and carbon dioxide.
[2:38:02.460 --> 2:38:05.340]  We are oxygen and carbon dioxide poor right now.
[2:38:05.340 --> 2:38:08.140]  We're in a red level emergency.
[2:38:08.140 --> 2:38:13.780]  We need more carbon dioxide, ladies and gentlemen, and you can look at the different maxims in
[2:38:13.780 --> 2:38:15.660]  the last 20,000 years with ice cores.
[2:38:15.660 --> 2:38:18.700]  Every time there's a peak, you see human development explode.
[2:38:18.700 --> 2:38:20.220]  We need hotter weather.
[2:38:20.220 --> 2:38:23.180]  It's better for life around the globe.
[2:38:23.180 --> 2:38:28.540]  Ice ages are bad for the overall life mass on earth and life isn't a drag on life.
[2:38:28.540 --> 2:38:35.540]  Life actually creates more complex biodiversity and generates more life on top of it.
[2:38:35.540 --> 2:38:40.260]  They're selling you that life always negatively affects other life, teaching you it's a zero
[2:38:40.260 --> 2:38:46.380]  sum game instead of a three-dimensional pie that is always growing.
[2:38:46.380 --> 2:38:50.060]  And then if you can think about that three-dimensional pie in your mind, that takes you to the fourth
[2:38:50.060 --> 2:38:54.620]  dimension, the true fourth dimension.
[2:38:54.620 --> 2:39:00.980]  Environmental engineers, Mikhail Chester and Aparod Horvath, let's get them on, and
[2:39:00.980 --> 2:39:05.660]  the University of California, Davis, say that when the costs are included, a more complex
[2:39:05.660 --> 2:39:07.500]  and challenging picture emerges.
[2:39:07.500 --> 2:39:10.500]  And that's that a train uses more per person than an SUV.
[2:39:10.500 --> 2:39:12.780]  You can go read that if you want.
[2:39:12.780 --> 2:39:14.700]  But the environmentalists don't care.
[2:39:14.700 --> 2:39:16.420]  They want your house and your car.
[2:39:16.420 --> 2:39:19.940]  The local environmentalists most of them know it's a scam, the mid-level ones.
[2:39:19.940 --> 2:39:21.560]  They want a job enforcing.
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:23.380]  They get off on coming on your property.
[2:39:23.380 --> 2:39:24.460]  They get off on poking you.
[2:39:24.460 --> 2:39:28.180]  They get off and love guys with ponytails and swat gear with their little guns, you
[2:39:28.180 --> 2:39:30.460]  know, running around harassing farmers and ranchers.
[2:39:30.460 --> 2:39:33.940]  They're parasite filth degenerate control freaks.
[2:39:33.940 --> 2:39:36.180]  I've run into them.
[2:39:36.180 --> 2:39:41.540]  They got the stupid roid heads back a mob, you know, with their machine guns and their
[2:39:41.540 --> 2:39:47.140]  bureaucracy with the animal ID and the premises ID and all of these systems.
[2:39:47.140 --> 2:39:51.860]  And they're creating giant bureaucracies to track and trace and categorize and chronicle
[2:39:51.860 --> 2:39:52.860]  everything you do.
[2:39:52.860 --> 2:39:57.540]  I said that years ago now the White House and now Nancy Pelosi admit that in speeches.
[2:39:57.540 --> 2:39:58.980]  Everything you do is going to be tracked.
[2:39:58.980 --> 2:40:03.260]  Schwarzenegger's called for a new sales tax on top of the income tax.
[2:40:03.260 --> 2:40:06.260]  I told you, they're not going to get rid of one tax and get a new one.
[2:40:06.260 --> 2:40:08.260]  They're going to give you more taxes.
[2:40:08.260 --> 2:40:09.260]  Stuff Neil Bortz pushes.
[2:40:09.260 --> 2:40:12.260]  He's paid to do that, by the way.
[2:40:12.260 --> 2:40:17.460]  Anyways, all of this is going on.
[2:40:17.460 --> 2:40:18.460]  Here it is.
[2:40:18.460 --> 2:40:20.420]  Schwarzenegger suggests state consider a flat tax.
[2:40:20.420 --> 2:40:24.100]  So it just goes on and on.
[2:40:24.100 --> 2:40:25.100]  This is the system.
[2:40:25.100 --> 2:40:29.460]  Now, as the economy gets worse, as the inflation of the bankers comes on, at first the money
[2:40:29.460 --> 2:40:34.220]  still works, something they buy real assets, then pass the inflation back to us as a way
[2:40:34.220 --> 2:40:38.340]  to then pay them back an inflated currency, which is gathering interest.
[2:40:38.340 --> 2:40:40.180]  So they went into the future model.
[2:40:40.180 --> 2:40:41.700]  See how this fraud model works?
[2:40:41.700 --> 2:40:43.660]  They make money on going up with the bubble.
[2:40:43.660 --> 2:40:47.660]  They make even more and get more power when it pops.
[2:40:47.660 --> 2:40:52.020]  And then as things inflate after the popping, first a depression in the economy, then an
[2:40:52.020 --> 2:40:56.620]  inflation with a steel, having a main street depression, hyper stag inflation, I've coined
[2:40:56.620 --> 2:40:58.140]  now being picked up by Tarpley and others.
[2:40:58.140 --> 2:40:59.140]  I appreciate that.
[2:40:59.140 --> 2:41:07.980]  Now, the yuppies and the college kids and the high school kids, they're going to wonder
[2:41:07.980 --> 2:41:11.620]  why milk a few years down the road is going to be $9 we're half going.
[2:41:11.620 --> 2:41:14.580]  They're going to wonder why everything's going to cost more.
[2:41:14.580 --> 2:41:16.860]  They're going to wonder why they're bankrupt, why they have no future.
[2:41:16.860 --> 2:41:22.060]  Well, they've got TV shows two of them the last week and George Soros and others funded
[2:41:22.060 --> 2:41:23.060]  one of them.
[2:41:23.060 --> 2:41:30.140]  You know, I'm going to play those trailers in a moment.
[2:41:30.140 --> 2:41:31.660]  I got my producer coming in to give me something.
[2:41:31.660 --> 2:41:32.660]  What's going on?
[2:41:32.660 --> 2:41:36.780]  I'm going to push him back to the next segment.
[2:41:36.780 --> 2:41:37.780]  Okay.
[2:41:37.780 --> 2:41:38.780]  Thank you.
[2:41:38.780 --> 2:41:39.780]  Let me try to focus.
[2:41:39.780 --> 2:41:40.780]  This is key here.
[2:41:40.780 --> 2:41:41.780]  Okay.
[2:41:41.780 --> 2:41:46.980]  Let me gather my thoughts again.
[2:41:46.980 --> 2:41:47.980]  It's the same trick.
[2:41:47.980 --> 2:41:51.620]  I talk about this trick a lot because it's one of their favorite tricks on thousands
[2:41:51.620 --> 2:41:53.020]  of issues.
[2:41:53.020 --> 2:41:56.860]  They will put up billboards saying firearms are illegal saying report illegal gun showing
[2:41:56.860 --> 2:41:58.700]  a picture of a revolver.
[2:41:58.700 --> 2:42:02.580]  Doesn't matter if you're in Tennessee or Texas or Alabama or Oregon where there's not all
[2:42:02.580 --> 2:42:06.820]  these gun laws, your neighbors will call the cops on you happens every day.
[2:42:06.820 --> 2:42:10.220]  I see it in the news where somebody puts their dear rifle in their car, SWAT team pulls them
[2:42:10.220 --> 2:42:14.340]  over five minutes later, beats the hell out of them because the citizen saw the gun and
[2:42:14.340 --> 2:42:17.700]  the citizen will say, I saw him waving the gun around.
[2:42:17.700 --> 2:42:19.780]  Everything's about false reports.
[2:42:19.780 --> 2:42:22.200]  Everything's about bull.
[2:42:22.200 --> 2:42:26.580]  It's the same thing with perception just like they make people perceive revolvers are illegal
[2:42:26.580 --> 2:42:30.700]  when they're not by having it in dramas and TV shows and billboards that it is.
[2:42:30.700 --> 2:42:31.700]  They're going after the idiot mass.
[2:42:31.700 --> 2:42:34.940]  That's why they want to dump everybody down so they have all these easy to dumb down and
[2:42:34.940 --> 2:42:40.020]  control manipulate people.
[2:42:40.020 --> 2:42:44.340]  It's the same trick with running all these TV shows that say you want to know why milk's
[2:42:44.340 --> 2:42:47.580]  going to cost $7, $8, $9 a gallon.
[2:42:47.580 --> 2:42:49.660]  You want to know why you're going to lose your job and have no future.
[2:42:49.660 --> 2:42:51.980]  You want to know why there's going to be rioting.
[2:42:51.980 --> 2:42:58.260]  You want to know it's because there's too many people and global warming caused it.
[2:42:58.260 --> 2:43:00.800]  You want to know why there's malaria, global warming.
[2:43:00.800 --> 2:43:05.700]  You want to know why suddenly we have drug resistant tuberculosis and trichinosis worms
[2:43:05.700 --> 2:43:07.780]  infecting people in the U.S., global warming.
[2:43:07.780 --> 2:43:13.380]  It's not all the illegal aliens, 30 million of them flooding all over us and no testing.
[2:43:13.380 --> 2:43:17.100]  So they basically say, if you have a headache, global warming did it.
[2:43:17.100 --> 2:43:18.900]  If you stub your toe, global warming did it.
[2:43:18.900 --> 2:43:21.100]  If you have a fight with your wife, global warming did it.
[2:43:21.100 --> 2:43:25.620]  And the public's like, oh my God, because they know rioting is coming, $9 a half gallon
[2:43:25.620 --> 2:43:26.740]  milk's coming.
[2:43:26.740 --> 2:43:28.660]  They know all of this is coming.
[2:43:28.660 --> 2:43:32.860]  And so they advertise in all these things and they show tornadoes, you know, if a tornado
[2:43:32.860 --> 2:43:38.620]  hits Texas or Oklahoma, which they hit thousands of times a year, always happened going back
[2:43:38.620 --> 2:43:40.220]  in history books, 300 years.
[2:43:40.220 --> 2:43:41.460]  People first were in Texas and Oklahoma.
[2:43:41.460 --> 2:43:43.260]  They reported it 250 years ago.
[2:43:43.260 --> 2:43:44.260]  Doesn't matter.
[2:43:44.260 --> 2:43:45.540]  There's now a tornado in the local news.
[2:43:45.540 --> 2:43:47.180]  They say global warming did it.
[2:43:47.180 --> 2:43:49.660]  If there's a storm, global warming did it.
[2:43:49.660 --> 2:43:53.300]  If it freezes, you know, they're having unseasonably cold temperatures because the sun just cooled
[2:43:53.300 --> 2:43:54.300]  down.
[2:43:54.300 --> 2:43:57.260]  They say, oh, it's colder because of global warming.
[2:43:57.260 --> 2:44:00.140]  And so see, it's all just real emotional, real stupid.
[2:44:00.140 --> 2:44:06.220]  So when people in a year or two see $7, $8 milk, they'll go, oh God, global warming.
[2:44:06.220 --> 2:44:10.520]  It's not that the big dairies with federal regulations shut down the smaller dairies
[2:44:10.520 --> 2:44:11.820]  and jacked up prices.
[2:44:11.820 --> 2:44:15.700]  It's not that the currency's devalued and so it costs more.
[2:44:15.700 --> 2:44:16.780]  It's not inflation.
[2:44:16.780 --> 2:44:17.980]  It's global warming.
[2:44:17.980 --> 2:44:22.220]  It's real simple and people won't even remember why they think it's global warming when they
[2:44:22.220 --> 2:44:26.660]  see riots over people not having food or people not getting their welfare checks.
[2:44:26.660 --> 2:44:32.060]  They will just remember kind of in the back of their mind, oh, it's global warming.
[2:44:32.060 --> 2:44:35.620]  Here in Texas, my whole life growing up, sometimes in the late spring, early summer, there's
[2:44:35.620 --> 2:44:41.540]  big rainstorms and there'll be this haze all over the cities and all over the country.
[2:44:41.540 --> 2:44:42.740]  And my dad's a pilot.
[2:44:42.740 --> 2:44:47.900]  He knows that's haze, you know, a private pilot.
[2:44:47.900 --> 2:44:50.240]  And I remember growing up, you know, we'd get to weather reports and they'd say there's
[2:44:50.240 --> 2:44:54.860]  low lying haze or there's, you know, you know, humidity's high today.
[2:44:54.860 --> 2:45:00.100]  Every time in Texas now that there's haze, regular water condensation haze, they get
[2:45:00.100 --> 2:45:05.780]  on the news and they say, Austin is covered by smog.
[2:45:05.780 --> 2:45:08.020]  And then you can go up in an airplane or drive hundreds of miles.
[2:45:08.020 --> 2:45:09.020]  It's the same haze.
[2:45:09.020 --> 2:45:10.500]  It's, it's water.
[2:45:10.500 --> 2:45:12.320]  Sometimes there's hazy days.
[2:45:12.320 --> 2:45:15.820]  Sometimes there's misty clouds, not anymore.
[2:45:15.820 --> 2:45:18.100]  And now it's global warming.
[2:45:18.100 --> 2:45:21.460]  So let's go ahead and play these two trailers here for the listeners.
[2:45:21.460 --> 2:45:24.740]  You can listen to it for people who are watching prisonplanet.tv.
[2:45:24.740 --> 2:45:25.740]  You'll see it live.
[2:45:25.740 --> 2:45:28.780]  We also have these videos posted up at infoworks.com if you want to watch it there and you're just
[2:45:28.780 --> 2:45:29.780]  a radio listener.
[2:45:29.780 --> 2:45:32.540]  It's posted, of course, up there on the side for those that aren't watching live.
[2:45:32.540 --> 2:45:33.540]  Here it is.
[2:45:33.540 --> 2:45:39.540]  In my life, I've seen New York City under full quarantine, the Midwest overrun, devastated
[2:45:39.540 --> 2:45:45.020]  by pests, plague sweep across California, stop right there.
[2:45:45.020 --> 2:45:46.020]  Stop right there.
[2:45:46.020 --> 2:45:51.220]  You see, oh, we got 30 million illegal aliens with drug resistant TB, with leprosy now back
[2:45:51.220 --> 2:45:55.620]  in the U.S., trichinosis, brain worms now killing people all over the place, all this
[2:45:55.620 --> 2:45:57.260]  hepatitis spreading in.
[2:45:57.260 --> 2:46:00.700]  What do they do when the illegal aliens in Mexico crap on the crops and people get hepatitis
[2:46:00.700 --> 2:46:01.820]  from it?
[2:46:01.820 --> 2:46:02.820]  That's what did it.
[2:46:02.820 --> 2:46:06.180]  They just federal regulations shot down U.S. crops.
[2:46:06.180 --> 2:46:07.180]  Nothing to do with it.
[2:46:07.180 --> 2:46:10.580]  See, oh, if plagues come in, it's global warming.
[2:46:10.580 --> 2:46:15.900]  If the globalist released plagues, it was global warming, okay, go ahead and start it
[2:46:15.900 --> 2:46:16.900]  over again.
[2:46:16.900 --> 2:46:17.900]  Here it is.
[2:46:17.900 --> 2:46:20.780]  And then what happened next was something none of us saw coming.
[2:46:20.780 --> 2:46:25.620]  It became a race against time to save our future, to even have a future.
[2:46:25.620 --> 2:46:29.020]  It's the year 2100 and I survived.
[2:46:29.020 --> 2:46:34.540]  To change the future, first you have to imagine it, Tuesday at 9-8 Central on ABC.
[2:46:34.540 --> 2:46:35.940]  So they say this is the future.
[2:46:35.940 --> 2:46:37.100]  They're making school kids.
[2:46:37.100 --> 2:46:38.100]  I looked it up.
[2:46:38.100 --> 2:46:39.340]  I knew they'd do it and I Googled it.
[2:46:39.340 --> 2:46:43.240]  They have school kids are being made to watch this under federal grants nationwide.
[2:46:43.240 --> 2:46:44.900]  They set them down and scare them.
[2:46:44.900 --> 2:46:48.700]  And if you give up your carbon taxes, track and trace everything you do, give up all of
[2:46:48.700 --> 2:46:52.620]  your rights, give up all of your liberties, give up all of your freedoms, let bureaucrats
[2:46:52.620 --> 2:46:57.820]  come in your house, join the Obama Youth Brigades, had everything you do chronicled and tracked
[2:46:57.820 --> 2:47:03.380]  on your new carbon credit ration card where even if you have money, when you buy over
[2:47:03.380 --> 2:47:09.660]  the amount of steaks and ice cream or beer or carbon causing food, that then you get
[2:47:09.660 --> 2:47:10.900]  an extra tax on it.
[2:47:10.900 --> 2:47:12.500]  That's the new global sales tax.
[2:47:12.500 --> 2:47:14.020]  They've announced this years ago.
[2:47:14.020 --> 2:47:17.300]  Now they're just announcing it in mainstream media.
[2:47:17.300 --> 2:47:20.900]  It was in academic papers a decade ago, see, that's how I knew all this.
[2:47:20.900 --> 2:47:22.340]  Now it's being announced.
[2:47:22.340 --> 2:47:23.340]  And so the kids are just scared to death.
[2:47:23.340 --> 2:47:26.460]  They say, what do I do in the school says you report on your parents in the New York
[2:47:26.460 --> 2:47:28.980]  Times says, oh, look at the children.
[2:47:28.980 --> 2:47:30.820]  They tell their mother not to take a bath.
[2:47:30.820 --> 2:47:32.420]  It's too high a carbon footprint.
[2:47:32.420 --> 2:47:35.780]  Too high a water foot and the mother goes, yes, I love my five year old telling me what
[2:47:35.780 --> 2:47:36.780]  to do.
[2:47:36.780 --> 2:47:37.780]  It's great.
[2:47:37.780 --> 2:47:40.580]  Then once the kids train to tattle on them for that, then it's do they have drugs?
[2:47:40.580 --> 2:47:41.580]  Do they spank you?
[2:47:41.580 --> 2:47:43.580]  And then parents don't spank anymore.
[2:47:43.580 --> 2:47:46.700]  Then it's do your parents raise your voice and a little snot nose eight year old gets
[2:47:46.700 --> 2:47:51.100]  a drug off to a pedophile CPS rape room after they tattle, but they don't care because the
[2:47:51.100 --> 2:47:55.620]  kids out of the school now doesn't warn the other eight year olds, hey, don't tell on
[2:47:55.620 --> 2:48:00.500]  your parents for yelling at you or a big fat pedophile rapes you.
[2:48:00.500 --> 2:48:04.820]  Really this is how it works, ladies and gentlemen, hell pits of evil.
[2:48:04.820 --> 2:48:08.940]  Let's go to the next one for 2010, 2000 100 and it's even worse.
[2:48:08.940 --> 2:48:14.100]  By the way, this, this TV show funded by Soros that's free that they're trying to counter
[2:48:14.100 --> 2:48:16.220]  our viral marketing system.
[2:48:16.220 --> 2:48:23.460]  This thing is all over the internet, all over everywhere and they're having viewing parties
[2:48:23.460 --> 2:48:24.460]  for it.
[2:48:24.460 --> 2:48:27.940]  It's called home project and it's teaching you your evil and your carbon footprint.
[2:48:27.940 --> 2:48:29.780]  I mean, this is a full takeover.
[2:48:29.780 --> 2:48:31.940]  They're coming with the new tyranny.
[2:48:31.940 --> 2:48:33.540]  Imagine if the Soviets would have figured this out.
[2:48:33.540 --> 2:48:36.140]  Oh, we have to restrict your re your resources.
[2:48:36.140 --> 2:48:37.140]  Oh, we have to kill you.
[2:48:37.140 --> 2:48:39.540]  Oh, we have to have one child policy for the earth.
[2:48:39.540 --> 2:48:41.100]  That's what the communist Chinese do.
[2:48:41.100 --> 2:48:45.140]  They were funded by the IMF and World Bank and the big Rockefeller foundation to do that
[2:48:45.140 --> 2:48:47.220]  on record.
[2:48:47.220 --> 2:48:53.500]  Now you're about Ted Turner and George Soros and David Rockefeller and all these and Oprah
[2:48:53.500 --> 2:48:58.100]  Winfrey meeting at the Rockefeller Foundation two weeks ago for this.
[2:48:58.100 --> 2:49:01.180]  They mean business.
[2:49:01.180 --> 2:49:03.180]  This is the mega tyranny.
[2:49:03.180 --> 2:49:14.580]  Let's go to the next clip.
[2:49:14.580 --> 2:49:27.380]  Oh, Rome fell.
[2:49:27.380 --> 2:49:28.380]  The Aztecs fell.
[2:49:28.380 --> 2:49:29.380]  New York is abandoned.
[2:49:29.380 --> 2:49:36.100]  I picture some explorer coming to Manhattan saying those ignorant people, how on earth
[2:49:36.100 --> 2:49:41.220]  could they have ever expected to pause to survive exactly the system tells us getting
[2:49:41.220 --> 2:49:42.220]  compact cities.
[2:49:42.220 --> 2:49:43.220]  They get control of us.
[2:49:43.220 --> 2:49:48.540]  And then they say, we're all going to die in the compact cities.
[2:49:48.540 --> 2:49:52.540]  If we don't give up all our rights to this social engineer, see, he knows best.
[2:49:52.540 --> 2:49:54.020]  He knows how to plan your future.
[2:49:54.020 --> 2:49:58.180]  And when you talk to these people, they get off, they're going to be the planners after
[2:49:58.180 --> 2:49:59.940]  they already planned this civilization.
[2:49:59.940 --> 2:50:04.820]  Now they're going to plan the new one as they try to make it where people that buy new property
[2:50:04.820 --> 2:50:06.980]  in the country can't grow crops on it.
[2:50:06.980 --> 2:50:11.340]  See, oh, we want it to be sustainable, but then they don't want it to be sustainable.
[2:50:11.340 --> 2:50:13.020]  You see how these people operate?
[2:50:13.020 --> 2:50:15.420]  They new land being sold all over the U.S.
[2:50:15.420 --> 2:50:17.980]  You can't farm on.
[2:50:17.980 --> 2:50:20.380]  They have incentives so you can't move to the country.
[2:50:20.380 --> 2:50:22.700]  So they make you go in the city and then tell you, oh, you're bad.
[2:50:22.700 --> 2:50:23.700]  You've got to die.
[2:50:23.700 --> 2:50:26.860]  You've got to at least have only one child and then be licensed if we say so.
[2:50:26.860 --> 2:50:32.340]  Go back to the control freak saying those ignorant people how on earth could they have
[2:50:32.340 --> 2:50:40.100]  ever expected to to survive?
[2:50:40.100 --> 2:50:44.340]  We are running out of oil, running out of water, running out of atmosphere, we're poisoning
[2:50:44.340 --> 2:50:45.340]  the whole planet.
[2:50:45.340 --> 2:50:46.840]  Stop right there.
[2:50:46.840 --> 2:50:51.020]  We're running out of atmosphere to pay to breathe.
[2:50:51.020 --> 2:50:55.100]  And this guy's saying you can't have carbon dioxide that creates oxygen in the plants.
[2:50:55.100 --> 2:51:01.980]  We will run out of, we're able this son of a bitch, we'll be right back.
[2:51:01.980 --> 2:51:06.940]  With food prices soaring to all time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what
[2:51:06.940 --> 2:51:11.100]  can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to

[2:54:20.220 --> 2:54:26.140]  on it though in the future to know that they're openly bragging this is a total control grid
[2:54:26.140 --> 2:54:31.220]  of tyranny has nothing to do with the environment meanwhile they're genetic engineering and
[2:54:31.220 --> 2:54:35.740]  doing all these horrible open air things that really do threaten humanity the planet's
[2:54:35.740 --> 2:54:41.180]  pretty tough but does threaten a lot of species and I am against pollution and things like
[2:54:41.180 --> 2:54:44.020]  that has nothing to do with that.
[2:54:44.020 --> 2:54:49.100]  This is tyranny and they mean business it doesn't matter if 98% of Americans don't
[2:54:49.100 --> 2:54:53.980]  want it they're just implementing it and they're brainwashing your kids in the schools speaking
[2:54:53.980 --> 2:55:00.060]  of that every day or two I see government institutions universe for these having conferences
[2:55:00.060 --> 2:55:05.660]  called the new world order this new world order that globalization global governance

[3:08:18.020 --> 3:08:23.700]  for the balance of the hour in studio joe banister he'll be in studio for an hour tonight before he
[3:08:23.700 --> 3:08:29.300]  drives back to dallas for an event he's going to be at over the weekend outside dallas joe banister
[3:08:29.300 --> 3:08:35.060]  he was a treasury agent and the great record as a treasury agent rated people for not paying their
[3:08:35.060 --> 3:08:40.900]  taxes to the irs the collection agency for the private federal reserve and uh he went to his
[3:08:40.900 --> 3:08:47.140]  superiors and said this is baloney and or what first said i need you to explain this to me
[3:08:47.140 --> 3:08:50.180]  because i didn't believe these people's claims and i've looked into it and it looks like there's
[3:08:50.180 --> 3:08:54.340]  some validity to it can you explain to me what's really going on here they said no go ahead and
[3:08:54.340 --> 3:08:59.860]  resign then he resigned years later they tried to indict him did indict him he went to court the jury
[3:08:59.860 --> 3:09:06.020]  found he not guilty of just having free speech and telling people the irs was a fraud and you
[3:09:06.020 --> 3:09:10.260]  know here's the issue i expose the irs but i don't tell people to stop paying their taxes
[3:09:11.060 --> 3:09:15.300]  because it's the mafia it's a criminal group like erin russo says reflections and warnings the new
[3:09:15.940 --> 3:09:21.060]  presentation we put out on dvd that you'll get hurt i'm not going to advise people to do things
[3:09:21.060 --> 3:09:25.780]  that are risky and dangerous that's up for you yourself to do i still pay the mafia and i have
[3:09:25.780 --> 3:09:30.820]  accountants and tax lawyers and we pay on the uh you know very conservative side
[3:09:32.100 --> 3:09:38.340]  and we pay more and so i try to spend almost all the money in here on the business so that uh
[3:09:38.340 --> 3:09:43.700]  and i'm getting the word out so that they don't get a lot uh and some years i end up with a little
[3:09:43.700 --> 3:09:47.300]  bit of money i got to pay him or and i'm like darn it i should have bought more equipment or i should
[3:09:47.300 --> 3:09:51.220]  have hired more employees or i should have you know done that but it's kind of a balancing act
[3:09:51.220 --> 3:09:57.780]  i've also got to have some reserves you know to run the operation so i just want to advise
[3:09:57.780 --> 3:10:02.500]  people to understand this is a criminal group and we didn't have the income tax until 1913
[3:10:02.500 --> 3:10:07.780]  and it wasn't popularized and wasn't more than a few percentage points of your income until the 50s
[3:10:07.780 --> 3:10:11.140]  so people should know that the country was built without the income tax there's lots of
[3:10:11.140 --> 3:10:17.140]  constitutional uh taxes but but the iris is outside the law the iris is outside the bill rights
[3:10:17.140 --> 3:10:21.620]  constitution they're outside due process so is cps and the family courts that were founded to carry
[3:10:21.620 --> 3:10:26.180]  out eugenics operations and the good news is we've gone for people laughing at us saying the fellow
[3:10:26.180 --> 3:10:30.340]  reserve was private and was going to hijack america and set up a carbon tax 10 years ago
[3:10:30.340 --> 3:10:34.500]  to now they're doing it and people are going whoa this guy made a film 10 years ago saying that
[3:10:34.500 --> 3:10:38.340]  you know these people talked about this 20 30 years ago if they were gee ever griffin and others
[3:10:38.340 --> 3:10:45.780]  and now we've got 190 sponsors just 22 short of passing it to audit the fed which will shut
[3:10:45.780 --> 3:10:49.940]  it down it's so criminal and even as they fight it and hire lobbies try to beat it people say
[3:10:49.940 --> 3:10:53.780]  well why are you hiding everybody else gets audited you know why are you on the news saying
[3:10:53.780 --> 3:10:58.740]  you're above the law people now know about made-off founding the stock exchange the nasdaq they now
[3:10:58.740 --> 3:11:03.140]  know about all these crooks they now know about the cia and money laundering and drug dealing
[3:11:03.140 --> 3:11:07.300]  and so it's all coming out and their credibility is falling that's what they're trying to bring a
[3:11:07.300 --> 3:11:13.700]  tyranny in right now and arresting and sitting to prison a shila jackson irs agent that's why
[3:11:13.700 --> 3:11:20.340]  they're trying to intimidate people so i've decided to pick my enemies to to pay the criminals
[3:11:20.340 --> 3:11:25.860]  so that they can indict me and set me up on that i mean i'm under a magnifying glass to go along
[3:11:25.860 --> 3:11:30.500]  with their little corrupt system while i have my first amendment to expose them now they're
[3:11:30.500 --> 3:11:34.740]  starting to say joe bannister doesn't have a first amendment now they're starting everyone shifts
[3:11:34.740 --> 3:11:38.660]  in prison for writing a book and they said you publish any more of those books explaining how
[3:11:38.660 --> 3:11:42.660]  we operate you're going to go to prison now they're saying they can't put out the movie hillary
[3:11:42.660 --> 3:11:47.380]  exposing hillary that's an associated press court saying it's illegal now they're saying they may
[3:11:47.380 --> 3:11:53.060]  ban free speech on the internet new york times now i've got articles i read earlier with a top
[3:11:53.060 --> 3:11:59.620]  pentagon uh people saying kill media that criticizes the government so we're now down to the wire
[3:11:59.620 --> 3:12:03.460]  here ladies and gentlemen joe bannister thank you so much for coming in thanks alex thanks for
[3:12:03.460 --> 3:12:08.580]  having me it's good to have you here uh here's joe bannister folks uh here in studio uh with us
[3:12:09.220 --> 3:12:16.100]  today uh joe uh tell the listeners just recapping a little bit about yourself your life's journey
[3:12:16.100 --> 3:12:21.860]  and where you see this country going you know where you see us 10 down 10 years down the road
[3:12:21.860 --> 3:12:26.420]  if we take action and stand up and fight versus if we don't take action to stand up and fight
[3:12:26.420 --> 3:12:33.060]  uh well 46 years old um worked in the private sector after graduating from college in 1986
[3:12:33.700 --> 3:12:39.460]  and then in 1993 i accepted appointment for the internal revenue service criminal investigation
[3:12:39.460 --> 3:12:45.140]  division to be a special agent in that division and i spent about five and a half years in the
[3:12:45.140 --> 3:12:51.220]  division i expected to spend a full 20 years and actually retire from the irs after having
[3:12:51.220 --> 3:12:58.820]  served a full law enforcement career um but about three years into my iris career i was
[3:12:58.820 --> 3:13:06.260]  listening to a talk radio show of not much unlike your own uh where this woman named dv kid came on
[3:13:06.260 --> 3:13:12.340]  the show and claimed that the federal income tax was not required to be paid by the vast majority
[3:13:12.340 --> 3:13:18.500]  of americans and uh when i heard this claim i thought well that can't be true because why do i
[3:13:18.500 --> 3:13:23.860]  have this six hour nine millimeter handgun and all these special equipment to enforce the income
[3:13:23.860 --> 3:13:29.780]  tax it can't be voluntary and it must be mandatory but i checked into it because of the credibility
[3:13:29.780 --> 3:13:36.660]  of the host um and i went and checked into it it took me about two years of part time evenings
[3:13:36.660 --> 3:13:42.260]  weekends driving my family crazy with all the reading that i did but i came to the conclusion
[3:13:42.260 --> 3:13:46.740]  that her claims were true probably not unlike the people that listened to you the first time and
[3:13:46.740 --> 3:13:50.820]  think what's this guy talking about and then when you actually look into it you find that
[3:13:51.460 --> 3:13:57.700]  there's a lot of evidence to back it up so i went ahead and presented my findings to my supervisors
[3:13:57.700 --> 3:14:04.020]  at the irs and i requested that they evaluate it and show me the error of my analysis if any
[3:14:04.740 --> 3:14:10.980]  and rather than evaluating it making any comments uh walking me through where i might have went wrong
[3:14:10.980 --> 3:14:17.380]  if i had gone wrong they instead told me that i should resign and uh being that i had taken
[3:14:17.380 --> 3:14:22.900]  an oath to support and defend the constitution uh and being that i could see clearly that if
[3:14:22.900 --> 3:14:27.620]  i were to continue in that position there would be no way that i could adhere to my oath uh that
[3:14:27.620 --> 3:14:34.020]  i had no choice but to resign and so that was uh february 25th of 1999 uh a little over 10 years
[3:14:34.020 --> 3:14:38.900]  ago and i interviewed you just uh i think a few weeks after that it happened that's the last time
[3:14:38.900 --> 3:14:43.540]  we met in person we've spoken to each other many times over these 10 years but that was our first
[3:14:43.540 --> 3:14:48.180]  and last meeting was about 10 years ago it's been quite a journey for you you almost went to prison
[3:14:48.180 --> 3:14:54.340]  for your free speech absolutely the irs tried various ways to trip me up and then finally they
[3:14:54.340 --> 3:14:59.540]  accused me of conspiring with one of my clients to defraud the united states of america because
[3:14:59.540 --> 3:15:05.700]  you're a cpa yeah well not anymore thanks to the irs yeah they're chipping away at me at slowly
[3:15:05.700 --> 3:15:10.580]  but yeah they indicted me for conspiring to defraud the united states of america uh the problem with
[3:15:10.580 --> 3:15:16.180]  their case is that they had no case uh and i you know that's what an investigation is all about
[3:15:16.180 --> 3:15:21.220]  you're supposed to find evidence um and then prosecute but if you don't find evidence you go
[3:15:21.220 --> 3:15:27.620]  and hunt for the next target but in my case they made an exception and prosecuted me anyway um but
[3:15:27.620 --> 3:15:33.060]  they couldn't even make up uh bad evidence about me and the the jury kind of looked at each other
[3:15:33.060 --> 3:15:37.780]  and said you know where's the beef here there's no evidence of wrongdoing but they still took
[3:15:37.780 --> 3:15:42.260]  that to trial they still took to trial and then kelly rushing in line port kentucky was in the
[3:15:42.260 --> 3:15:47.380]  newspaper they arrested him for giving a police officer a ron paul video and also had one of my
[3:15:47.380 --> 3:15:52.820]  films but they gave him two charges of threatening a police officer for ron paul speech and my film
[3:15:52.820 --> 3:15:57.780]  wrote a tearing and i called the judge at home the judge said yeah no we're trying him and the
[3:15:57.780 --> 3:16:01.860]  jury found him not guilty but they were going to put him in jail for a ron paul video i mean these
[3:16:01.860 --> 3:16:07.060]  people are nuts well that they absolutely at least that in the tax movement in the irs uh they they
[3:16:07.060 --> 3:16:13.060]  love prison as the ultimate scare tactic because if you went to prison that means two things number
[3:16:13.060 --> 3:16:18.580]  one uh that you were wrong and the government was right and that you know that will be the uh
[3:16:18.580 --> 3:16:25.380]  insinuation and number two that it discredits you for the rest of your life so but i mean i
[3:16:25.380 --> 3:16:30.980]  morally won't lie about somebody if i do little things i feel guilty all i have is that i'm a good
[3:16:30.980 --> 3:16:35.460]  person that's what hurts my feeling people lie about me i don't know i've seen it with the police
[3:16:35.460 --> 3:16:40.660]  and people i don't understand how they could burn and ruin people's lives and feel good about it you
[3:16:40.660 --> 3:16:45.300]  were in that culture i know it's gotten worse the last 10 years and i guess you saw that and got out
[3:16:45.300 --> 3:16:50.420]  how do they live with themselves i mean it's kind of like a third of the people on death row it turns
[3:16:50.420 --> 3:16:54.180]  out are innocent i mean this i mean this country's got one of the most corrupt criminal justice
[3:16:54.180 --> 3:16:59.540]  systems out there i think the problem is uh in my experience that there's a lot of law enforcement
[3:16:59.540 --> 3:17:06.100]  people who are just as apathetic as the general public and so they don't take the time out of you
[3:17:06.100 --> 3:17:11.700]  know the watching a football game or going to play golf to sit down and do some research it's just
[3:17:11.700 --> 3:17:15.620]  like you might be against 50 million abortions since roe v wade but you really don't think about
[3:17:15.620 --> 3:17:20.580]  it or care right it's like oh i don't yeah like oh yeah we screw up sometimes but overall it's for
[3:17:20.580 --> 3:17:24.980]  the betterment you know right and as soon as you start to look into it you find just how deep the
[3:17:24.980 --> 3:17:30.580]  rabbit hole goes and of course that's i found out i thought it was deep when i resigned from the irs
[3:17:30.580 --> 3:17:36.100]  and then uh when i when i was introduced to you and your work and of course all your staff i mean
[3:17:36.100 --> 3:17:42.180]  it's it's like a bottomless pit and i continue to try to explain to people it's always worse than
[3:17:42.180 --> 3:17:46.580]  what i thought people think i'm saying it's bad i mean they're in canada right now with world leaders
[3:17:46.580 --> 3:17:50.180]  meeting openly saying they're setting up world government and they put out a press release
[3:17:50.180 --> 3:17:54.900]  saying this and then if i go on local radio and talk about it they'll call me crazy i can
[3:17:54.900 --> 3:17:59.700]  say here's video of them saying and they go shut up crazy i mean that is spiritual blindness i mean
[3:17:59.700 --> 3:18:04.580]  that's that's ignorance at a spiritual level it's a choice they've made right well i think i mean
[3:18:04.580 --> 3:18:10.420]  the devil you know evil that's what they try to do is to work on they know that we're all vulnerable
[3:18:11.060 --> 3:18:15.620]  to those kinds of attacks and so it really takes uh you know a spiritual balancing
[3:18:16.420 --> 3:18:20.180]  constantly to be able to withstand those kinds of attacks i've been going through a lot of
[3:18:20.180 --> 3:18:23.940]  tribulations lately i'm i'm not whining about it it actually makes me know i'm doing good work
[3:18:23.940 --> 3:18:28.900]  but it's getting really crazy every day insanity that i can't really get into air because it just
[3:18:28.900 --> 3:18:33.940]  intensifies it and like the fbi the times they've been here in the secret service the people are
[3:18:33.940 --> 3:18:38.180]  like well why don't you tell us about it well i get subpoenas with federal gag orders you can't
[3:18:38.180 --> 3:18:42.660]  talk about it and then now it's in the newspaper what what one of the cases was about so i can't
[3:18:42.660 --> 3:18:47.700]  talk about it but it's not fun right and i'm sure that maybe with your situation that they tend to go
[3:18:47.700 --> 3:18:52.340]  around to talk to other interview exactly and all of a sudden well there must be something wrong with
[3:18:52.340 --> 3:18:58.100]  alex if the fbi is asking about him and you know it's hard to you can't ever repair those
[3:18:58.100 --> 3:19:02.740]  kinds of damage no they do that with landlords they do that and it's constant i'm sick of it right
[3:19:02.740 --> 3:19:07.140]  and i know what we're fighting but well joe what i'm saying is it brings it home and lets you know
[3:19:07.140 --> 3:19:12.420]  how real it is when they persecute you and i haven't been indicted yet knock on wood like you have
[3:19:12.980 --> 3:19:16.260]  but that's tough i brought a little shirt don't want to show you when i was president of my
[3:19:16.260 --> 3:19:22.820]  training class i don't know let me say this when i was president of my training class one of my
[3:19:22.820 --> 3:19:29.460]  duties was to choose the the t-shirt for the class so it's a fedora wearing fed with his gun and
[3:19:29.460 --> 3:19:33.940]  badge and it says i'm your worst nightmare and accountant with a gun and then on the front
[3:19:33.940 --> 3:19:37.700]  you've got your federal treasury agent yeah so we didn't we didn't wear this this would be more
[3:19:37.700 --> 3:19:42.740]  the raid shirt that we used to wear with the treasury emblem and it would say a us agent on
[3:19:42.740 --> 3:19:48.740]  the back which this one doesn't but uh thought i lighten it up and of course i had to uh change
[3:19:48.740 --> 3:19:53.380]  out of my front sight t-shirt uh to dress up because you were so nicely by the way i always

[3:24:11.540 --> 3:24:18.580]  last night on the phone hi jimmy well i'm a fan of joe banister he's a fan of me jimmy's a fan of
[3:24:18.580 --> 3:24:24.100]  me i'm a fan of him uh we're all fans of people that love liberty okay joe banister uh here's one
[3:24:24.100 --> 3:24:30.020]  of your other shirts you wear on the raids where is this country going where do you see the movement
[3:24:30.020 --> 3:24:36.180]  to expose the illegal irs going because the federal reserves is getting close to being audited people
[3:24:36.180 --> 3:24:43.220]  now know let a bunch of made-offs get the money from the irs but it goes to debt it goes to servicing
[3:24:43.220 --> 3:24:48.660]  the national debt which is all a fictitious fraud can you explain that to people as a accountant
[3:24:48.660 --> 3:24:55.060]  uh as far as the federal reserve sure uh that basically the government uh when they need it's
[3:24:55.060 --> 3:25:00.260]  basically like a credit card advance if you if you think about the solicitations you get in the
[3:25:00.260 --> 3:25:04.420]  mail to get a credit card and they say you're pre-approved and you know you can go out and
[3:25:04.420 --> 3:25:10.740]  spend five ten grand uh even though you may not have the means to pay for it later but
[3:25:10.740 --> 3:25:15.540]  meanwhile in the mail in the mail will come a check for five or ten thousand dollars uh on your
[3:25:15.540 --> 3:25:20.980]  signature and you can go out and spend it on whatever you want and uh you know hopefully
[3:25:20.980 --> 3:25:24.420]  you can pay it back but the banks are going to charge a high enough interest rate that they're
[3:25:24.420 --> 3:25:30.420]  going to make money on you or at least the the majority uh the overall cut for the bank will
[3:25:30.420 --> 3:25:36.100]  be huge uh so in a sense i look at it that way in terms of what the federal government does they
[3:25:36.100 --> 3:25:42.980]  have a blank checkbook that is basically like a cash advance and then their collateral or security
[3:25:42.980 --> 3:25:48.660]  on those loans is uh all of the blood sweat and tears of all of us and it doesn't go to the country
[3:25:48.660 --> 3:25:53.940]  like the old taxes did it goes directly to debt to offshore bankers before i forget i want to talk
[3:25:53.940 --> 3:25:59.060]  about this how do people support you in your work your book your website what you're doing because
[3:25:59.060 --> 3:26:03.780]  i know that they've you know first you resign because you wouldn't go along with their criminality
[3:26:03.780 --> 3:26:09.860]  then they took your cpa license away now how are how are you funding yourself i basically just work
[3:26:09.860 --> 3:26:14.580]  as an accountant or what they call a forensic accountant i do a lot of the same kind of uh
[3:26:14.580 --> 3:26:20.500]  reconstructive work that i did at the irs is just that now i'm working for the good guys so uh that's
[3:26:20.500 --> 3:26:29.060]  what i do for a general living um but my website is freedomabovefortune.com and uh the main thing i
[3:26:29.060 --> 3:26:34.580]  would ask is just people uh join my email list so that they can get updates on what's happening
[3:26:34.580 --> 3:26:40.740]  uh in my activism and i also share activism in other areas such as you know the stuff that you
[3:26:40.740 --> 3:26:47.860]  do uh i have a little radio show myself uh it's quite um quite i really want to talk about it
[3:26:47.860 --> 3:26:52.820]  given what the the beauty that i see here uh oh give me a break tell us about your show come on
[3:26:52.820 --> 3:26:57.620]  i got this little uh little piece of equipment you know i bought at the guitar center uh anyway
[3:26:57.620 --> 3:27:01.860]  it's on liberty works radio network so yeah they're good folks that's great yeah with john
[3:27:01.860 --> 3:27:07.300]  john cotmire yeah uh tom crier the attorney uh who was also prosecuted by the iris is there
[3:27:07.300 --> 3:27:13.460]  so i have a show on saturday mornings from seven to nine a.m pacific every saturday so yeah i should
[3:27:13.460 --> 3:27:18.260]  get in touch with liberty works radio network you know i was probably on about 15 radio stations in
[3:27:18.260 --> 3:27:25.700]  1998 97 98 and john cotmire at that time had like i don't know 30 or something stations he was leasing
[3:27:25.700 --> 3:27:29.860]  and he called up and he said i'm going to put you on these stations you got a hot show and that
[3:27:29.860 --> 3:27:36.020]  that was like the detonator it went boom i mean the show was already getting big because i was on
[3:27:36.020 --> 3:27:41.060]  like 45 all of a sudden and then these were some big stations in big markets right and then other
[3:27:41.060 --> 3:27:45.700]  stations heard and picked it up and i kind of almost got up to about 80 or 90 stations and then 9
[3:27:45.700 --> 3:27:50.340]  11 happened i said it was an inside job it was fine i was bashing bill clinton all these conservative
[3:27:50.340 --> 3:27:54.420]  stations not cotmire but the others said no i think and then cotmire of course i was unable
[3:27:54.420 --> 3:27:58.500]  to keep funding all that but he's a great guy so i love plugging cotmire in fact maybe i
[3:27:58.500 --> 3:28:02.260]  should have him on and plug him in they ought to carry my show again that'd be good for me
[3:28:02.260 --> 3:28:05.940]  i don't know how many stations they're leasing this time don't think they have too many he's
[3:28:05.940 --> 3:28:10.580]  basically i can't remember the reasons but that the network that you described from the old days
[3:28:10.580 --> 3:28:15.780]  it was skyrocketing but somehow i think the government or sponsors were able to derail it
[3:28:15.780 --> 3:28:19.300]  yeah the government would have sponsors and stuff right after cotmire that's what people
[3:28:19.300 --> 3:28:24.340]  need to financially support us i mean i could never go out in least 30 or 40 big radio stations
[3:28:24.340 --> 3:28:29.060]  i mean cotmire did everything you know put everything on the line all his life's money
[3:28:30.020 --> 3:28:34.180]  i think he got some money from race car racing or something but i mean the whole issue is
[3:28:34.180 --> 3:28:38.580]  he did that and then people are like yeah you shouldn't have sponsors you shouldn't ask for
[3:28:38.580 --> 3:28:43.460]  donations we need funds ladies and gentlemen it's it's tough i i guess people think because we have
[3:28:43.460 --> 3:28:49.140]  these little jackets for our suits that we were independently wealthy and uh you know i i think
[3:28:49.140 --> 3:28:54.660]  ultimately god provides for us according to our needs as long as we ask or that it's bad that we even
[3:28:54.660 --> 3:28:59.380]  i mean the government forces you to give them your money and then they use that to propagandize you
[3:28:59.380 --> 3:29:02.980]  we're here doing a show it's free market if you want to donate or buy the books and videos
[3:29:02.980 --> 3:29:07.060]  that's your business people say no you're not supposed to even sell a book or video
[3:29:07.060 --> 3:29:10.740]  you're not supposed to have a tv show you're not supposed to create your own media see how it's
[3:29:10.740 --> 3:29:17.140]  double think the media you know lockheed martin and and and and mcdonald douglas and g e bomb makers
[3:29:17.140 --> 3:29:22.340]  they can own nbc and stuff and that's basically taxpayer money and put out government propaganda
[3:29:22.340 --> 3:29:27.540]  but then we can't make a film and sell it joe right well i think part of the reason alex is that the

[3:33:01.100 --> 3:33:21.100]  Joe Bannister is our guest again he'll be on tonight first hour with Jason Burmese
[3:33:21.100 --> 3:33:33.100]  I want to just have you roll whatever you think is important that people need to know about instead of me just throwing questions out in the time we have with you Joe and let's not have it be ten years again until you're back in studio with us
[3:33:33.100 --> 3:33:37.100]  why are you in texas and then get into whatever subjects you like
[3:33:37.100 --> 3:33:55.100]  I'm attending a training class with my son Robert in the Dallas area and you know I really love coming to Texas I got a lot of friends here and I just saw well I don't know the geography that well and I said well let's see how far is Austin three hours you know what let's drive to Austin and see if we can say hi to Alex
[3:33:55.100 --> 3:34:09.100]  is that for frontside you're here in town no I've been to two frontside trainings and I try to wear this shirt in you know appropriate environments like like your show and so this is what I was wearing when I came in earlier the frontside
[3:34:09.100 --> 3:34:25.100]  I was just wondering why you mentioned it because we just got contacted by the owner of frontside and I heard from so many people that it really is a great training course one of the best out there you went through the Treasury Department training is it good yes I've been to two of the four day handgun courses for for frontside it's
[3:34:25.100 --> 3:34:43.100]  outside of Las Vegas in a town called Perump a little bit of a drive but it's really fantastic I'd say the training is actually better than what I received with the Treasury Department and of course my training was you know 15 years ago but excellent excellent
[3:34:43.100 --> 3:34:58.100]  excellent training they treat you with a lot of respect and I mean my son Robert attended the class with me he had handled the firearm a couple times but I mean by the end of those four days he was an accomplished holster drawing
[3:34:58.100 --> 3:35:14.100]  shooter well that's the issue I grew up with the kind of the frontiers men type training I didn't know until I read history books later that four year old sediment a lap with a 410 shotgun teach them the danger then never let them touch the gun just you know
[3:35:14.100 --> 3:35:28.100]  make an objective of of of great power and admiration that I would get to when I was five or six and start learning safety first they show you the power you don't want to get near the Zinnitoy then they teach you about it then they would take me out you
[3:35:28.100 --> 3:35:41.100]  really get on you take it away if you did something wrong they will work on it tomorrow then the target and by the time I was like 12 I was an incredible shot I didn't realize people weren't everybody wasn't being given that training you know how to breathe how to squeeze how to always point at the ground
[3:35:41.100 --> 3:35:51.100]  or point at somebody unless you're going to shoot them you know all those basics of shooting how to you know lead something how to follow then how to use a scope you know as I got older this was just normal you know for me and people in the
[3:35:51.100 --> 3:36:05.100]  rural areas so I always encourage folks that are getting into firearms to be sure that they do go out and take some training because you will get in a lot of trouble if you don't have the training plus it's almost youth like useless if you don't have some basic
[3:36:05.100 --> 3:36:17.100]  training but I'm gonna shut up go ahead well as you you're talking about I mean there's a culture that developed in our our country and even before our country was founded and of course doesn't that dovetail with the Second
[3:36:17.100 --> 3:36:31.100]  Amendment it doesn't say a militia it says a well regulated militia and of course regulation deals with training not with choking you with with paperwork absolutely it certainly does you were telling me a story about your son during the break
[3:36:31.100 --> 3:36:48.100]  yeah I have two sons one just turned 21 Robert who's with me and Ryan who want wanted to be with us is 17 almost 18 and you're two ago Ryan came to me and you know he's was learning things about the bigger world out there and he said
[3:36:48.100 --> 3:37:02.100]  dad there's this guy his name's Alex Jones and I'm really learning a lot from him he said you ever heard of him I said well as a matter of fact Ryan I have you know he interviewed me back in 1999 when I left the IRS and I
[3:37:02.100 --> 3:37:16.100]  you know we haven't we don't talk all the time but I'd say we're friends and he said you're friends with Alex Jones so you know my my sons and I wouldn't say through any prodding that I've done you know that's got to be great that
[3:37:16.100 --> 3:37:27.100]  certainly he got on the right path and that's another testament to I better do a better job because we really are reaching millions of people that's what I keep trying to point out listeners is a lot of us just take for granted the millions you've been
[3:37:27.100 --> 3:37:41.100]  reaching the millions I've been reaching I mean in those front page ads in USA Today you reach millions alone I mean we and you they tried to put you in prison for that and I'm not trying to whine and say support us we're we're really in you know
[3:37:41.100 --> 3:37:52.100]  double I want folks to know we are doing this because we love liberty and freedom because it's the right thing to do but to also realize this isn't a game the New World Order really is real
[3:37:52.100 --> 3:38:11.100]  absolutely and I think the thing is Alex that as you know very well know that now today we're reaching the the the mainstream much more than we ever have 3040 years ago the so called you know tax protest movement was largely cloistered and you know incestuous and so the
[3:38:11.100 --> 3:38:21.100]  government wasn't really worried about it what they're worried about is us being able to enlighten people who otherwise would never know about this or question it and that's why they persecute people like yourself for free
[3:38:21.100 --> 3:38:33.100]  absolutely they want to have a chilling effect back back as I said that you know if they don't show an Erwin Schiff or a Joe Bannister behind bars then we people question well wait a second how can Joe Bannister be saying what he's saying
[3:38:33.100 --> 3:38:46.100]  and still be walking to the grocery store and walking out there free that that won't that won't register with people so the the government has to try to imprison us and of course as you've also probably learned though is as difficult as it is to be
[3:38:46.100 --> 3:39:02.100]  attacked a lot of times those attacks can turn into the most horrendous victories for all of us because it really you know that's what I've learned every time somebody makes up some new horrible liar tries to set me up or all the things the
[3:39:02.100 --> 3:39:14.100]  shenanigans I don't spend a lot of time talking about it in the past but now I realize it's starting to come to a head so I'm kind of warning folks stuff's getting crazy that every time I just say all right God I'm gonna trust you go through this we get blessed after it
[3:39:14.100 --> 3:39:26.100]  happens absolutely yeah the blessings they come veiled as things we may not recognize but of course you know God has a plan that is only somewhat been revealed to us and we have to trust in him and that's the
[3:39:26.100 --> 3:39:45.100]  course been my the strength that I've been able to drop on of course my friends supporters and people like yourself but ultimately all Maddie God is always there for you you just have to open up yourself to him and realize that he'll protect you sometimes it may not look like protection to us but again
[3:39:45.100 --> 3:39:57.100]  and occasionally if you've really committed and I'm not trying to be all high and mighty or this is what I've learned and what I've you know in history if you fully committed to God and said do whatever it takes use me sometimes God will let you be destroyed
[3:39:57.100 --> 3:40:10.100]  or killed but that is going to water the tree of liberty like Thomas Jefferson said that will sometimes create the giant resistance or awakening and I mean maybe that's people's journey to because I know I've told God whatever it takes
[3:40:10.100 --> 3:40:26.100]  I mean I mean I mean God's gonna do it God's gonna do anyways but I've told God if it means they destroy me and kill me or destroy my name my treasure my name no matter what crap they make up I am committed to this and I think it's that attitude that spirit of total commitment
[3:40:26.100 --> 3:40:37.100]  that that the enemy is afraid of absolutely not you know Christians especially I'm sure maybe other religions have but you know Christians have the martyrs if it weren't for martyrs in the early years of Christianity
[3:40:37.100 --> 3:40:58.100]  Christianity wouldn't be here and it's people I'm sure having to make that same kind of realization that Lord you know let your will be done and if I'm meant to be killed or be tortured or to be prosecuted or persecuted or you know bad things are said about me
[3:40:58.100 --> 3:41:11.100]  each one of those things you have to offer up and just realize that there's there's a reason for it and as long as you're obeying the commandments and that you are trying to do the right thing according to your conscience you know you'll come out on the other side
[3:41:11.100 --> 3:41:28.100]  well that's the thing I try to be a good moral person and I am God fearing and I catch myself doing things when we really are fallen species but we also you know have you can reach for the stars at the same time I can't imagine just giving myself totally over to you I mean that must be horrible
[3:41:28.100 --> 3:41:43.100]  I can't imagine it myself I you know we ask ourselves how do they sleep at night but then again if they've totally given themselves over to evil maybe it's not too difficult but you know you're I and I'm sure I mean all the people I've met here and your crew and so many people that I've met
[3:41:43.100 --> 3:41:57.100]  they're the complete opposite the complete antithesis of what the government told me they would be the government said they're greedy they just don't want to pay their taxes you know they're just miscreants they want to make trouble and it's not like that
[3:41:57.100 --> 3:42:06.100]  well you know I've looked at most the original Patriots in the kind of the last wave the last 50 years before us kind of the G. Ebert Griffin's and Bob Chapman's at the tail end of that
[3:42:06.100 --> 3:42:21.100]  mainly they were military people and intelligence people who were let in on this stuff and a lot of them were like you know Red Beckman in the Air Force all these guys they were I mean they saw this and they heard the U.N. is going to take over America and we're going to have a world
[3:42:21.100 --> 3:42:31.100]  government they said and they saw the IRS shaking people down without due process and they knew the Bill of Rights and Constitution and they were saying look this isn't you know this is a bunch of baloney
[3:42:31.100 --> 3:42:43.100]  well I think you know I wouldn't mind putting out the word there to law enforcement and military not to make you feel bad or to judge you but you know one of the things that I keyed in on was that I know we are not to bear false witness
[3:42:43.100 --> 3:42:56.100]  and if you know something is a fact and you know that people's lives are at stake the government's poisoning us or doing something you may need to judge how you're going to exit or what you're going to do to make things better
[3:42:56.100 --> 3:43:08.100]  but remember that it's wrong to bear false witness against your neighbor and if you're helping these evil people and maybe you didn't know you were but if you're a link in that chain
[3:43:08.100 --> 3:43:15.100]  you need to think really hard about that and you need to pray about it and see what your role may be in trying to put a stop to it
[3:43:15.100 --> 3:43:23.100]  well here's an example CPS and I covered the bill yesterday I left it in my car I forgot on the right or on the right and get it out of the trunk the bill number
[3:43:23.100 --> 3:43:34.100]  and I read the bill I saw the headlines and couldn't believe it and I read it it's Senator Kurt Watson State Senator introduced a bill and it openly says no more warrants not even fake judge family court orders
[3:43:34.100 --> 3:43:47.100]  just CPS or their designates can just grab kids without even asking parents do medical tests you name it word for word in the bill it it didn't pass the bill passes an anti CPS bill to restrict their
[3:43:47.100 --> 3:44:00.100]  that he's a key senator he put it on as a tag on after it been voted on the Texas Legislature's real corrupt the rules they've changed where he tagged it on after it was in committee and went to the governor to let him do whatever they want
[3:44:00.100 --> 3:44:13.100]  and I mean are so the police are I guess now we're going to start going kidnap and kids without any order without any warrant without any I mean folks this isn't freedom I mean that's evil and they're so scared of losing their jobs
[3:44:13.100 --> 3:44:23.100]  ladies and gentlemen if you all just start saying no this evil stop growing but when you have the attitude of oh I want to lose my job I remember when I had a popular talk show
[3:44:23.100 --> 3:44:31.100]  I'd already started a syndicated show at a home but I was in here locally one of the number one shows in Austin and they came in and said no more Bill Clinton no more New World Order 99 or you're fired
[3:44:31.100 --> 3:44:39.100]  and I said well gee I'm it's a popular show is it not they said yeah but you're fired and they said you got a few weeks to stop it and I didn't stop and they said you're fired dumbass
[3:44:39.100 --> 3:44:46.100]  and you'll never have it that's the word for word you'll never have another job in radio they even know I'd already started another one but I was blessed by that
[3:44:46.100 --> 3:44:54.100]  and I didn't feel bad when I left their fire I felt good and if I never would have been on the radio again it doesn't matter you cannot continue to just give in to everything
[3:44:54.100 --> 3:45:01.100]  and I sound like a hypocrite then saying well I'm paying the IRS no I'm choosing my battles you know that's the issue I'm making
[3:45:01.100 --> 3:45:08.100]  I totally agree I mean when I left the IRS I had my you know typical human anxieties about how am I going to pay my bills
[3:45:08.100 --> 3:45:16.100]  but you end up able to do it just trust in God you know hang in there and you'd be amazed at what things you can do
[3:45:16.100 --> 3:45:22.100]  and what things you really need to survive God will take good care of you
[3:45:22.100 --> 3:45:32.100]  here's the bill SB1440 will allow CPS to kidnap and sell people's children just like they did to the FLDS 401 children in April
[3:45:32.100 --> 3:45:38.100]  the court made them give all but one of the children back to the parents because they didn't have any court order even from a judge
[3:45:38.100 --> 3:45:44.100]  just went and did it but our legislators and CPS people want to keep up their kidnapping unhindered by the Constitution the rule of law
[3:45:44.100 --> 3:45:51.100]  and I went and read the bill that's true they just added it on just no bill of rights of any type now
[3:45:51.100 --> 3:45:59.100]  well I think you know as you know well Alex the powers that be are always poking around looking for weak links and of course attacking our children
[3:45:59.100 --> 3:46:07.100]  attacking our relationship with our children attacking how we decide that we're going to discipline our children or teach them
[3:46:07.100 --> 3:46:15.100]  those are our weak links have you seen the new pamphlets they have nationwide where it says yelling at your kid they'll take them
[3:46:15.100 --> 3:46:22.100]  I haven't seen that yet I'm not kidding we have the pamphlet in fact I had it in here a few weeks ago the state gives parents it says raising your voice
[3:46:22.100 --> 3:46:29.100]  in fact called Janet in here right now called Janet in here right now they try to take one of my employees eight year old and she's got the pamphlet
[3:46:29.100 --> 3:46:36.100]  gave it to me it's out there on those folders I think I heard about you talking about this a few weeks ago yeah and then they gave her an order
[3:46:36.100 --> 3:46:42.100]  it was a made up little order you know they have it themselves saying do not raise your voice during the 15 day investigation period
[3:46:42.100 --> 3:46:48.100]  now do not raise your voice is now abused I guess I gotta be thankful that my youngest is two months away from being 18
[3:46:48.100 --> 3:46:53.100]  but I mean that is the Soviet Union yes the other Soviet Union the same kind of stuff
[3:46:53.100 --> 3:47:00.100]  well you know it's it's a Soviet to station of America and I remember when I first was researching the stuff back in the 90s
[3:47:00.100 --> 3:47:07.100]  I remember that that theme was was present there and I you know I kind of thought I was new to it how could this be and what is she talking about
[3:47:07.100 --> 3:47:16.100]  was a TV kid talking about her Alex Jones but as you continue to go down that rabbit hole you see I mean it is absolutely exactly a carbon copy
[3:47:16.100 --> 3:47:23.100]  of what the Soviet Union is about you were showing me a document earlier how they list people dangerous even if they criticize the IRS
[3:47:23.100 --> 3:47:32.100]  yeah it's a potentially dangerous taxpayer the acronym is PDT and I discovered through freedom of information act request that I myself am a PDT
[3:47:32.100 --> 3:47:39.100]  by the way did you know I've done that three times they won't give me my stuff I've got to get a lawyer and sue them they won't give it to any federal agency
[3:47:39.100 --> 3:47:49.100]  they will not give me my not even blacked out pages no redactions nothing they just give you nothing no respond at all no maybe I should hire you to file it for me
[3:47:49.100 --> 3:48:00.100]  and I'm seriously maybe you had success I yeah so this is in 25.4.1.1 and boy I tell you that's amazing here it is yeah here it is
[3:48:00.100 --> 3:48:10.100]  a parents guide to child protective services investigation and we asked her to show me the park as I forget where it says you're not allowed to raise your voice
[3:48:10.100 --> 3:48:23.100]  keep talking to y'all to find it well I mean it's sadly the state governments of course I'm in Nevada and at least our legislature seems a little more approachable and have a little more common sense
[3:48:23.100 --> 3:48:36.100]  but that's just in comparison to states like California or as you're saying with Texas so you know I would also encourage listeners to monitor your state and local governments as well
[3:48:36.100 --> 3:48:44.100]  because I think ultimately those are going to be our last lines of defense in terms of government because obviously the federal government is not accountable
[3:48:44.100 --> 3:48:55.100]  whatsoever to the people and our only prayer is to have at least some sliver of accountability with our local and state officials
[3:48:55.100 --> 3:49:02.100]  it says verbally attacked or accused being yelled at there's a part where it says you can't raise your voice
[3:49:02.100 --> 3:49:07.100]  so I imagine they can determine what's a raised voice from a non raised voice
[3:49:07.100 --> 3:49:13.100]  well the issue is there is no law that you can't yell at your kids spanking is not illegal anywhere you just can't cause serious physical harm
[3:49:13.100 --> 3:49:19.100]  but meanwhile they're going to taser you now have you seen the court ruling where they say they can taser you to force a DNA sample
[3:49:19.100 --> 3:49:24.100]  so they can beat you over the head of the night stick but if you yell at your kid you're going to go to jail
[3:49:24.100 --> 3:49:34.100]  it's our well in fact I just went to the bookstore down the street and bought 1984 for my younger son
[3:49:34.100 --> 3:49:44.100]  it's you know read books like 1984 read what it was like in the Soviet Union and look at today's America and I challenge you to find a bunch of a difference
[3:49:44.100 --> 3:49:50.100]  well in 1984 they have cameras in their houses now people buy Xboxes with a camera that watches you
[3:49:50.100 --> 3:49:56.100]  they have cameras on computers Google admits they're using to watch you but they say a computer is watching you and recording the audio
[3:49:56.100 --> 3:50:03.100]  and creating ads they hear a dog bark it puts a dog food ad up that's already going on Google announced it three years ago
[3:50:03.100 --> 3:50:10.100]  and then I'm the weirdo for talking about it right the public doesn't isn't aware of it largely and you talk about it and there's something wrong with you

[3:54:57.260 --> 3:54:59.060]  We've certainly upgraded what we're doing.
[3:54:59.060 --> 3:55:00.780]  Joe Bannister, four minutes left.
[3:55:00.780 --> 3:55:05.620]  Great having you here in studio with us, freedomabovefortune.com.
[3:55:05.620 --> 3:55:08.460]  Anything else you'd like to impart to our listeners out there?
[3:55:08.460 --> 3:55:10.260]  I mean, they're getting ready to audit the Fed.
[3:55:10.260 --> 3:55:12.300]  It looks like we're very close to that.
[3:55:12.300 --> 3:55:13.940]  People are waking up.
[3:55:13.940 --> 3:55:18.180]  I see a lot of positive things, but also the negative that the enemy is coming in like
[3:55:18.180 --> 3:55:19.420]  a ton of wrecks on us.
[3:55:19.420 --> 3:55:24.580]  Well, I think we may have already reached the point, Alex, but people ought to go out
[3:55:24.580 --> 3:55:28.340]  and exercise the First Amendment rights because they may not be too long and you won't really
[3:55:28.340 --> 3:55:30.580]  be able to do that anymore.
[3:55:30.580 --> 3:55:36.180]  We have it written there on the paper on the Constitution, but try actually exercising
[3:55:36.180 --> 3:55:38.700]  your rights and see what happens to you.
[3:55:38.700 --> 3:55:42.820]  So you still have an opportunity as just an average citizen out there when you're shopping
[3:55:42.820 --> 3:55:48.340]  or with your friends and family to speak up about these kinds of things.
[3:55:48.340 --> 3:55:53.380]  And I'd like to also say, and I've watched quite a few of your films.
[3:55:53.380 --> 3:55:59.300]  Just watched the Aaron Russo film last night, and those are very powerful tools to educate
[3:55:59.300 --> 3:56:00.300]  people.
[3:56:00.300 --> 3:56:06.540]  If you can at least sit them down for a couple hours and hook them, they'll see that you
[3:56:06.540 --> 3:56:09.900]  have so much truth and evidence in what you present.
[3:56:09.900 --> 3:56:13.460]  And that's really what ultimately converts people is the truth.
[3:56:13.460 --> 3:56:17.180]  Well, that's what's frustrating is when I get up and I say, every one of these new
[3:56:17.180 --> 3:56:21.140]  ruler meetings they have years later, we get their minutes and now they even brag and they
[3:56:21.140 --> 3:56:25.220]  say that we want a world government to reduce your population and we're going to micromanage
[3:56:25.220 --> 3:56:26.660]  every fast of your life.
[3:56:26.660 --> 3:56:31.380]  And people don't realize because they haven't lived in a real bondage.
[3:56:31.380 --> 3:56:32.380]  It's horrible.
[3:56:32.380 --> 3:56:35.860]  I studied history and have an idea and fighting the globalist, I've experienced some of their
[3:56:35.860 --> 3:56:36.860]  tyranny.
[3:56:36.860 --> 3:56:37.980]  You've experienced it.
[3:56:37.980 --> 3:56:43.740]  And so those of us that are deeper into the fight against them, we have seen things they
[3:56:43.740 --> 3:56:45.140]  haven't quite seen yet.
[3:56:45.140 --> 3:56:48.800]  And I hope they wake up before it's too late because if we all just wake up and take action,
[3:56:48.800 --> 3:56:50.300]  this doesn't have to happen.
[3:56:50.300 --> 3:56:51.300]  Absolutely.
[3:56:51.300 --> 3:56:58.220]  And as it was said in the Aaron Russo film, Nick Rockefeller was, you asked Aaron about
[3:56:58.220 --> 3:57:03.140]  his demeanor and Aaron said, well, he just didn't seem to care.
[3:57:03.140 --> 3:57:05.420]  He didn't care about people.
[3:57:05.420 --> 3:57:08.940]  And I think that's something that's going to become criminalized.
[3:57:08.940 --> 3:57:12.020]  You'll be criminalized to care about people because when you care about them, you have
[3:57:12.020 --> 3:57:16.300]  to speak up about them, you have to actually step in the way, you know, if a police officer
[3:57:16.300 --> 3:57:18.940]  is trying to beat somebody for no reason.
[3:57:18.940 --> 3:57:24.380]  And as you attempt to care for your fellow man, it'll be criminal to do so.
[3:57:24.380 --> 3:57:31.140]  So we better do as much as we can, as fast as we can now, before that comes upon us.
[3:57:31.140 --> 3:57:32.140]  What are you doing in the future?
[3:57:32.140 --> 3:57:35.140]  Still going around and speaking to groups, still writing articles, still doing a radio
[3:57:35.140 --> 3:57:36.140]  show?
[3:57:36.140 --> 3:57:40.140]  Yeah, when I'm invited, I really don't spend as much time at it as maybe I should, you
[3:57:40.140 --> 3:57:45.340]  know, just try to support the family and, and certainly go whenever I'm invited.
[3:57:45.340 --> 3:57:49.820]  And in this case, I kind of invited myself because I was just so excited to, to see,
[3:57:49.820 --> 3:57:50.820]  see you in person.
[3:57:50.820 --> 3:57:51.820]  Are you, are you kidding?
[3:57:51.820 --> 3:57:54.340]  You're one of those evil super patriots we hear about in the DHS.
[3:57:54.340 --> 3:57:58.180]  You care and you don't feel like you're doing enough and that's the real mark of somebody
[3:57:58.180 --> 3:57:59.180]  that cares.
[3:57:59.180 --> 3:58:02.020]  And I remember you even put your book out for free when you did that, even though you were
[3:58:02.020 --> 3:58:03.020]  broke at the time.
[3:58:03.020 --> 3:58:06.940]  Again, that same mark of somebody that just wants to reach out and warn their fellow man,
[3:58:06.940 --> 3:58:11.900]  their fellow woman and stand up for liberty, you're a shining example of what type of police
[3:58:11.900 --> 3:58:16.820]  officers and peace officers that we need in this country, guardians of the truth, guardians
[3:58:16.820 --> 3:58:20.300]  of the Republic, Joe Bannisher, freedomabovefortune.com.

[3:58:52.060 --> 3:58:56.620]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer

[3:59:01.340 --> 3:59:06.740]  These have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
