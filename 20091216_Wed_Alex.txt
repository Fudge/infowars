[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:33.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.000]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you so much for joining us today
[00:39.000 --> 00:51.000]  we're going to be live here for the next four hours Nigel Paul Farage British
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.000]  politician leader of the United Kingdom independence party will be joining us
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.000]  coming up an hour and a half today he's a gentleman who's given impassioned
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.000]  speeches many times as a European Union member of Parliament from the UK on the
[01:05.000 --> 01:11.000]  nature of the criminal takeover that has been unfolding through the European Union
[01:11.000 --> 01:20.000]  now expanding to a global government and so that is coming up today with Nigel
[01:20.000 --> 01:28.000]  Farage joining us for a full hour with his final report from Copenhagen for us
[01:28.000 --> 01:35.000]  for a full hour out of the gates tomorrow at the start of the broadcast we have Lord
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.000]  Christopher Moncton joining us and there have been a lot of trials and tribulations
[01:41.000 --> 01:48.000]  quite a soap opera with his lordship over there in the last week and a half and so
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.000]  he'll be giving us his final report from Copenhagen with the event in disarray
[01:53.000 --> 01:59.000]  imploding tomorrow at the start of the broadcast Lord Christopher Moncton will
[01:59.000 --> 02:08.000]  be joining us we have some other surprise guests tomorrow and Friday as well I
[02:08.000 --> 02:16.000]  have a key stack here on the health care bill we have a chance to beat it but if
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  we believe the mainstream media that it's a foregone conclusion it's going to
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.000]  pass it will probably pass and I'll say 6040 right now but we do have a decent
[02:25.000 --> 02:34.000]  chance 40% chance of beating this especially in the House because they got to
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  have a conference committee even if it passes the Senate they got to line the two
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  up between the House and Senate and that's where the real fight is I believe
[02:40.000 --> 02:46.000]  it's going to pass the Senate it already passed the House but some of the really
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  bad stuff has been stripped out of the Senate version horrible stuff is still
[02:49.000 --> 03:00.000]  there the House version is even worse it's the original you know five years in
[03:00.000 --> 03:07.000]  prison quarter million dollar fines if you don't have insurance and Democrats
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  and Republicans who voted for it in the House are admitting they know it's
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000]  political suicide I mean they are politically dead unless they can get
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  electronic fraud machines which a lot of cities and counties do have in their
[03:20.000 --> 03:25.000]  districts I mean minus selection fraud and there is a lot of that going on
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  that's why they don't seem to care as much now minus that they are all
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.000]  politically dead ducks in one year all of them that are up for reelection and
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.000]  that's everybody in the House they're up every two years that's a great part
[03:37.000 --> 03:43.000]  of a natural form of term limits built into there the Senate's got six years
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  they think you'll forget but there are some senators up it's staggered every
[03:49.000 --> 03:55.000]  two years a certain percentage what one-third of the senators are up for
[03:55.000 --> 04:02.000]  up for vote what 33 so that is going on there we're going to be breaking that
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  down and the latest on Copenhagen obviously and we'll get a British
[04:07.000 --> 04:14.000]  perspective on EU hegemony with Nigel Farage coming up in an hour and a half
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  from now or now an hour and 25 minutes I want to do what I did yesterday though

[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  and he's the gentleman we played his clips before who has royally skewered skewered
[08:55.000 --> 09:03.000]  is the word the European Union members of Parliament as well as Herman von
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.000]  Rumpi in fact let's get some of those clips I forgot to tell you guys let's get
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  some of those clips I aired a few weeks ago Watson knows the clips he wrote
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  articles about it where he destroys von Rumpi for his corruption and exposes
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  their world government takeover plan I want to play a few of those in the
[09:18.000 --> 09:27.000]  run-up to Nigel Farage European Union member of Parliament joining us
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.000]  head of the United Kingdom independence party so that is coming up today we're
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  going to have tons of news and open phones during the balance of the time
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.000]  here's the really big financial news that I'm going to get into at the start
[09:40.000 --> 09:48.000]  of the second hour directly Gulf Petro powers to launch currency and latest
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  threat to dollar hegemony see there's no doubt that they're killing the dollar
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.000]  the decision has been made they've gone in the last year from debating killing
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.000]  the dollar to deciding how are they going to kill it it's kind of like you
[10:02.000 --> 10:08.000]  got a bunch of cows out your back 40 and you're going to butcher them yourself
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  like my daddy did when he was growing up and they'd go out and pick usually a
[10:12.000 --> 10:19.000]  year year and a half you know younger juicy plump cow that they wanted to
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.000]  take around back and shoot in the head and haul up by its hooves and butcher
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  it themselves and put it in the deep freeze for family meat for the next
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  six months or so and so they were looking out there deciding if they were
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  going to kill the cow and now they've marched out and they've picked to kill
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.000]  the dollar and now they've taken it around behind the barn and they've got
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  the little 22 rifle out and they're walking over to Missy the you know the cow
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  or LC give it whatever name you want the United States and they're putting the
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  22 to the side of our head and about to pop us a couple times you know you
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  don't want to have a mess about to put a 22 bullet into our brain it'll bounce
[11:00.000 --> 11:09.000]  around nicely inside and so it's now happening and I really want to discuss
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.000]  what this is going to mean for everyone in this country you think the economy is
[11:14.000 --> 11:19.000]  bad now just wait and the Federal Reserve has been lovingly engineering all
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.000]  this the Arabs wouldn't be doing this unless they've been given authorization
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.000]  this has all been planned and set up for a long time so that is coming up we
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  also will get into the latest and there are big developments the Copenhagen
[11:32.000 --> 11:41.000]  event is falling apart blowing up in their face even more spectacularly than
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.000]  we had originally thought it would so this is certainly great news and all of
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.000]  you getting the word out deserve the lion's share of the credit so I salute
[11:48.000 --> 11:54.000]  all of you out there exposing these fraudsters for what they are we'll go
[11:54.000 --> 12:04.000]  over that the bad news is the Senate is going to pass by Christmas the smart
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  money is on the fact they're going to pass the health care bill but they've
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  got to then go into conference and make sure the two bills integrate together
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.000]  at the house level and that's where people are really getting scared that
[12:16.000 --> 12:22.000]  voted for it and so there is a big exodus of rats leaving the sinking ship
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  there we got a chance to kill this as well but we've got a absolutely call
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  every member of the house that voted for it call the committee that's involved
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.000]  over it we've got to go ahead and keep calling Lieberman and let that rat know
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  that he's saying now he's going to vote for it I told you he was he's only
[12:42.000 --> 12:50.000]  grandstanding the guy is a piece of work well regardless that's all coming up
[12:50.000 --> 12:56.000]  very important information today police state news dealing with the persecution
[12:56.000 --> 13:02.000]  of people selling vitamins and herbs the state department is kidnapping
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  American citizens who have set up factories even people that are naturalized
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.000]  citizens of say Ecuador they're kidnapping them now using CIA squads
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  snatching grab squads I mean the snatching grab squads are for everybody
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.000]  and I want you to know it was confirmed remember that video got millions of views
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  from Pittsburgh a few months ago where men in army uniforms jump out and grab
[13:26.000 --> 13:31.000]  protesters and put them in cars and drive away and the neocon sites came out
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.000]  and said it was staged it wasn't real Michelle Malcolm who said that wasn't a
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  real puppy the Marines throughout the cliff little puppy holding its legs up
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  under it I mean anybody can tell you that's a real puppy whimpering and of
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  course later the Marines were charged with it and they did kill a puppy but
[13:47.000 --> 13:53.000]  again psych warfare though always tells you it's not real and it's the same
[13:53.000 --> 14:03.000]  thing on the earlier case I was just talking about but they're being caught
[14:03.000 --> 14:11.000]  red-handed there as well so the G20 put out a press release they were on this
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  we have the G20 head security officer call here they dialed Rob Jacobson's
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  extension and I called him back and they wouldn't give me their name but I
[14:19.000 --> 14:26.000]  checked the number and it was one of the sub-prefects of the G20 head
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.000]  security office and they just said that was our security people working with the
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  army we are in control this is under our jurisdiction while we're here under
[14:35.000 --> 14:42.000]  agreements with the city in the county Allegheny County it's the same thing
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  with the UN and Copenhagen they have you and police running around with side
[14:45.000 --> 14:52.000]  arms in the city saying we are in control they just show up and announce we are
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  over you our jurisdiction is in control and they had snatch and grab teams out
[14:57.000 --> 15:02.000]  there grabbing people and Michelle Malcolm fake neocon came out and said oh
[15:02.000 --> 15:09.000]  that's fake too yeah honey it's it's real fake just like the Pentagon admitting
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  they torture people's children in front of them that's in the to goomba army
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  report back when the neocons thought they had the public sold on all this
[15:18.000 --> 15:25.000]  tyranny they were admitting in 2002 they were torturing people's wives and
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  children in front of them that's what the good guys do what you're for the good
[15:29.000 --> 15:36.000]  guys aren't you everybody knows taking a five-year-old and torturing them
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  including sexually in front of their parents is what the red white and blue

[24:25.000 --> 24:30.000]  governed by UN edicts and the states and counties and school districts follow it
[24:30.000 --> 24:36.000]  because it's tied to federal funds all children in America by law even if your
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.000]  homeschooled they're now trying to implement it under the new freedom

[24:50.000 --> 24:55.000]  the goal is to go from 20% of kids on drugs over 50 it's purely to drug you
[24:55.000 --> 25:02.000]  mean they admit themselves it's a fraud BATF runs programs the United Nations
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  two weeks ago it got declassified is running local public schools from
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  Australia to Canada to the United States to Europe it's all standardized all the
[25:10.000 --> 25:15.000]  same curriculum they have the kids come home and write up dossiers on their
[25:15.000 --> 25:22.000]  parents and their climate footprint and parents tend to submit to the school and
[25:22.000 --> 25:29.000]  we are a nation who full grown men shake in fear when a teacher says tell me
[25:29.000 --> 25:35.000]  what's in your gun case most it's federal law by the way that totally illegal
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  and unconstitutional that when you go into a pediatrician they ask the parents
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.000]  to leave and they say does mommy and daddy have guns do you have access to
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.000]  them do you ever get spanked they're trying to take your kids everyone's been
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.000]  turned into an agent now a lot of people just ignore it they still have some
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.000]  America left in them some freedom some John Wayne left in them some George
[25:55.000 --> 26:02.000]  Washington is his is the real John Wayne and they just don't follow this just
[26:02.000 --> 26:07.000]  like seven years ago they said I can't talk about my political views six weeks
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.000]  before an election everybody just ignores it I'm an American I'll talk
[26:11.000 --> 26:18.000]  about whatever I want under your campaign finance reform so ma'am
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  specifically Lisa in Texas tell us your school district get past the fear
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  you're a free person you're not in the Soviet Union yet but if we give in they
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  will win as Alexander Schultz and it's a said oh how we burned in the camps
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.000]  later wishing we would have stood up you got to stand up Lisa you've done that
[26:34.000 --> 26:39.000]  calling in today but specifically give us the school district at least you know
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000]  a generality of what graders child's in the name of the handbook because I can
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  probably just Google it it's probably online and I'm familiar with literally
[26:47.000 --> 26:52.000]  hundreds of these but next it's going to be I guarantee you if they're doing
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  this they're asked he's doing on computer little dossiers on you but
[26:56.000 --> 27:02.000]  specifically what is this called Lisa it's the PEC powerhouse investigation
[27:02.000 --> 27:08.000]  yes see everything's an investigator so it's the sitting in the PEC powerhouse
[27:08.000 --> 27:15.000]  investigation and that is a that is a yes that is a carbon footprint assessment
[27:15.000 --> 27:21.000]  PEC powerhouse investigation and see children love being given power
[27:21.000 --> 27:24.000]  parents aren't taught the secrets to getting your children to do what you
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.000]  say you make them like my son is the is the head of security in the house it's
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.000]  his job to make sure all the doors are double locked whenever people are in
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.000]  the house and then because I give him petty power he then serves me dutifully
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.000]  but that's what you're meant to do instead they tell you to never they teach
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  you how to not teach your children and then they actually have the ways to
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  actually have the children under their control go ahead ma'am
[27:48.000 --> 27:54.000]  oh I'm sorry he did not want to do it we had a good discussion with him we
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  there's 12 schools in central district central Texas that are doing this and
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.000]  we were chosen as one of them and they were starting him with a zero if he
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.000]  did not complete this to come home we'll see again the UN has stated the school
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  will take over America they're fully federalized slash institutionalized
[28:12.000 --> 28:18.000]  internationalized and they just fully come in we ma'am we need to make a big deal
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.000]  about this your headline should be parents you know children threatened with
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.000]  zeros on grades if they don't create dossiers of family home spy on parents

[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  doing it and once they get them trained a lot of parents go oh good you're spying
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.000]  on me you're tattling on me for the environment next it's your medicine
[35:09.000 --> 35:14.000]  cabinet they ask them our mommy and daddy arguing that's not illegal still
[35:14.000 --> 35:19.000]  you get a CPS visit look at Tiger Woods getting CPS trying to take his kids now
[35:19.000 --> 35:23.000]  this is how America works folks we're not in a free country these creeps are
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.000]  everywhere but I don't particularly need her to send me that now did you send
[35:27.000 --> 35:32.000]  Kurt and and and Paul the I am link to the Pyrton Alice river authority power
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.000]  authority will as soon as I leave actually as soon as I head back out I'll
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  get that over to them as soon as you're not on air exactly okay Ryan works here
[35:40.000 --> 35:45.000]  in our office Ryan you actually work for these guys I worked for Austin Energy
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.000]  for five years as a customer service representative just got the bills paid
[35:49.000 --> 35:54.000]  but one thing that hit during those years in December of 2008 was a big
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  shake-up in Pedernales regarding payments that were made to a law firm
[35:58.000 --> 36:04.000]  Clark Thomas and winners which actually got filtered through and sent directly
[36:04.000 --> 36:11.000]  to the brother of the CEO Benny full fuelberg and the scandal was very big
[36:11.000 --> 36:15.000]  same thing at LCRA all of these authorities are private cash machines
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  they have their own SWAT teams they run the schools they literally just rule
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  everyone they just let you know you are scum we own you know SWAT teams hitting
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  people's homes it's just it's just hell for us out in the hill country just
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  ravaging us just literally waving machine guns in the air I mean I I've been to
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.000]  the homes I've been to the families of people you know living in 150 year old
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  German houses just goat farmers and they're like SWAT team came by again
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  I've been literally one time was old German guy dying of cancer he's like
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.000]  and they shut my wallet against the wall and they said they's the boss now
[36:49.000 --> 36:55.000]  because I live by the river and I don't know why they've been by here three times
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.000]  and that's not enough for them now the kids report on what's going on in your
[36:59.000 --> 37:04.000]  house because it's America and they're gonna do it and you're gonna love it
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  I'm sorry go ahead
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.000]  all right well Paternalis basically has had a history it's a long history as you
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.000]  mentioned from their founder even of scandals
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  LBJ was never involved in corruption
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.000]  exactly and it's very common right now for a lot of utility companies to
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.000]  basically get the kids to do what what
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  but their quasi government is the issue
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.000]  exactly and I mean they've got SWAT teams they've got LCA has cameras all over
[37:33.000 --> 37:37.000]  central Texas they're in with T-Boone pickings grabbing the water supply get
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  ready for that to go up then they brainwash the kids there's no water
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.000]  they're teaching kids who in 15 years will be paying taxes or 10 years paying
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.000]  taxes that water is all about to go up yeah because they're seizing it all
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.000]  yeah and you don't really have a choice in the matter you need electricity
[37:51.000 --> 37:56.000]  no we're a third world nation run by by by by guys with private armies
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.000]  exactly and in the case of for example Austin Energy it's a city-run utility
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  and everyone in Austin has no other choice they have to go through that one
[38:04.000 --> 38:08.000]  with Paternalis any market they're in they're extremely dominant they're very
[38:08.000 --> 38:12.000]  dominant you almost have to choose them unless you want to pay an exorbitant amount
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  but they do have community fish fries and the directors of it we're cowboy hats
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.000]  walk around to all the locals and they can feel important and make and make
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.000]  fake country boy noises they go I'm serious I've seen LCA and Pertanalis
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.000]  Authority little propaganda pieces they play on Channel 17 in the county
[38:30.000 --> 38:35.000]  and literally the you know these guys just swindle around with all the good old boys
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  just in this country is a rat-infested wormhole we have got to admit what we've
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.000]  turned into but it's not enough they get all your money and have their private
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.000]  SWAT teams now your kids work for them exactly and leave our children alone
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.000]  your dirt bags get out of our families I said I'd take calls I just can't handle
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  it anymore I can't handle the scum anymore and and just to give you a little
[38:57.000 --> 39:01.000]  idea of some of the reasons why all these green initiatives are coming from
[39:01.000 --> 39:04.000]  the power companies which are really nothing green it means they take your
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  property at the point of a gun here here's what they do down here they want
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.000]  your rancher farm it's theirs most of their money in fact about 90% of any
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  utility company's money comes from selling their electricity to other third
[39:15.000 --> 39:20.000]  party electric companies so the less the people in the country they always pay
[39:20.000 --> 39:25.000]  for the power and pay for the plant and then it's shipped and sold to the big
[39:25.000 --> 39:30.000]  cities exactly and the the less energy you use the more energy they can sell
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.000]  at a higher rate to another your electric company which will then in a small
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.000]  community for example and your kids are going to be there we're bugging you and
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  spying on you exact and the better part is the less you use they can even then
[39:40.000 --> 39:46.000]  charge you even more exact artificial scarcity the favorite rape tool but
[39:46.000 --> 39:50.000]  it doesn't matter they're going to double the energy prices they've admitted
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.000]  double the water prices the public will love it they'll love their kids wearing
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.000]  little armbands rebuking them that's what America is see that America isn't
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.000]  1776 to the average American thinks 1984 when they read it they think oh this is
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  a wondrous place they think this is where I want to live I mean it must be
[40:07.000 --> 40:11.000]  because that's what America is turning into Ryan absolutely that's what I mean
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  though any group think about the feds though literally every community group
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.000]  they're even giving money to rotary clubs they're giving money to the Masons
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.000]  the Masons are running around getting DNA kits all the kids and giving it to the
[40:22.000 --> 40:26.000]  feds I mean they're just just piranhas everywhere feeding on us and you talk to
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.000]  the average moron who's part of these groups they think it's good they think
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  they're doing good no you're not doing good you're not good you understand
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.000]  you're just like some Soviet agent who thought they were good in 1939 Russia
[40:39.000 --> 40:46.000]  you're not good you're bad you understand that you're bad
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  I didn't mean to go into complete rant will you send those paternalist documents
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  well that doesn't matter all over the country kids are coming home to an
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.000]  environmental audits and they got kids like shows like climate cops is now on
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.000]  in the US produced in Australia where they where they go around and give you
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.000]  tickets of your but you save money that's what's fun about it but what they're
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  doing is they're setting the precedent that they boss your life they come in
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.000]  your home they run your life that's right if they can get you to knock your
[41:12.000 --> 41:18.000]  kilowatt hour usage down from through all of the extensive green initiatives
[41:18.000 --> 41:21.000]  that they put through they can get you to knock it down they'll just bump the
[41:21.000 --> 41:25.000]  price per kilowatt hour and they'll sell the excess over to another company they
[41:25.000 --> 41:29.000]  profit in two different way but it's worse than that that's just for the local
[41:29.000 --> 41:34.000]  pimps you know local dons up higher every initiative is to get your kids to
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.000]  literally in some school districts a third of their work is writing dossiers
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.000]  on their family and the parents sit there and let this happen they're taking
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  your children away from you right in front of you and now it's going to be
[41:46.000 --> 41:52.000]  year-round school I mean how stupid are people incredibly stupid they'll walk
[41:52.000 --> 42:00.000]  into it smiling well they I don't deserve what's happening we can say oh well
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.000]  they get what they deserve that won't do it just because you got a bunch of
[42:03.000 --> 42:06.000]  sheep out there that think wolves are their friends doesn't mean that we
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  don't have to stand up we've got to do something Ryan absolutely I'm going to
[42:10.000 --> 42:15.000]  start by making sure we get an article posted about this situation especially
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  well it's not just per analysis when doing everybody and money laundering I
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.000]  mean it's all these groups literally literally the the the larger issue is
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.000]  these guys are putting up surveillance systems to surveil all of us they're
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  they're becoming the new environmental authorities I mean it was in the
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.000]  statesmen that a former special forces colonel runs the environmental
[42:35.000 --> 42:40.000]  carbon footprint program I mean it's paramilitary because if you can control
[42:40.000 --> 42:46.000]  resources you've got feudal slaves these guys all have slot teams this is a
[42:46.000 --> 42:51.000]  iron tyranny with a green glove on it and the biggest the biggest offenders
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.000]  for their green initiatives the biggest offenders on carbon footprints is
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  normally the people at the top they're sponsoring all of these projects that
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.000]  they but it's not offending anything so what if some water runs down the ditch
[43:03.000 --> 43:08.000]  that's what it's always done so what we need to have more resources humans make
[43:08.000 --> 43:13.000]  a lot of areas they move into better but they sell us that we're bad so we'll
[43:13.000 --> 43:16.000]  let them rape us it has nothing to do with the environment Ryan thanks for
[43:16.000 --> 43:21.000]  coming in said I'm gonna go to calls I'm just ranting here because it just
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.000]  reminds me how sick everything is see I know too much folks it's like that's
[43:25.000 --> 43:30.000]  Narls Barkley song you know I'm crazy I went crazy but not because I didn't
[43:30.000 --> 43:35.000]  know didn't know enough I just know too much I mean I just start thinking about
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  everything they're doing and it's just unbelievable it's like a house that's
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.000]  had termites for 20 years and you put a new coat of paid on it looks fine but
[43:43.000 --> 43:47.000]  you walk on the porch your foot falls through you open the door it falls off
[43:47.000 --> 43:51.000]  its hinges you you lean up against the wall with your hand your hand goes through
[43:51.000 --> 43:56.000]  the wall it's all completely rotten you peel back the government propaganda
[43:56.000 --> 44:02.000]  paint anywhere it's just termites they've eaten everything
[44:12.000 --> 44:16.000]  it's unbelievable I can't believe that most smart people that learn about this
[44:16.000 --> 44:21.000]  decide to go join it they say well the public's a bunch of idiots and there's
[44:21.000 --> 44:26.000]  a criminal enterprise if you can't beat them join them I'm gonna go rob everybody
[44:26.000 --> 44:32.000]  and then and I talked to so many well-to-do focused intelligent even handsome
[44:32.000 --> 44:37.000]  people you would think would be noble and they're just like it's the way of the
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.000]  world Alex you better just join it now I'm never going to join it you people
[44:42.000 --> 44:49.000]  make me sick do you understand that once you have that attitude
[44:49.000 --> 44:53.000]  just given to corruption it's over you become North Korea you become Mexico
[44:53.000 --> 44:58.000]  you become a cross between the two you become Saudi Arabia you become
[44:58.000 --> 45:05.000]  communist China can't believe it I love this country so much
[45:05.000 --> 45:10.000]  there's just criminals everywhere and now the criminals like the Soviets are
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.000]  getting in power completely and now saying if you're good you're bad
[45:14.000 --> 45:18.000]  they teach the police that gun owners and veterans and conservatives and
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.000]  libertarians are the big threat to America and then so conservatives go along
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.000]  with it they put up a picture of a guy in a turban and say give up your rights
[45:26.000 --> 45:32.000]  to beat this guy and conservatives go all right I will
[45:32.000 --> 45:36.000]  sorry Bubba you can't own a gun anymore you're on a no fly no by list we won't
[45:36.000 --> 45:40.000]  tell you why but it's for America I don't like it but as long as it's to stop
[45:40.000 --> 45:48.000]  El Cada I guess I'm for it stop being gullible morons get angry when the
[45:48.000 --> 45:53.000]  public schools sit there and tell you that your kids work for them and a third
[45:53.000 --> 45:57.000]  of their schoolwork currently is writing dossiers on mommy and daddy and
[45:57.000 --> 46:05.000]  everything you do that isn't freedom that's as bad as tyranny gets and now
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.000]  we've got confirmed reports of the Pentagon snatching citizens off the streets
[46:09.000 --> 46:15.000]  all over America and I'll tell you this I'm nonviolent I'm not looking for
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.000]  trouble but I'm not getting in any army truck and anybody tries to grab me and
[46:19.000 --> 46:26.000]  put a bag over my head I'm gonna give fight who's so radical Alex won't run into
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.000]  the pit and be shot in the back of the head you know what all these stupid cops
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.000]  and all these dumb military people that think they're patriots and think that
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.000]  tyranny's good do you fools have any idea what's gonna happen when one percent
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.000]  of gun owners are forced to stand up against you and a million five hundred
[46:43.000 --> 46:48.000]  thousand combatants have only got to go out and go after one person apiece and
[46:48.000 --> 46:58.000]  then never do anything else again and you are destroyed annihilated but you're
[46:58.000 --> 47:05.000]  like a bully you just can't help it you just got to keep pushing and pushing and
[47:05.000 --> 47:13.000]  pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing I gotta sit here and read army
[47:13.000 --> 47:18.000]  reports where you're torturing people's kids in front of them you dirty dark evil
[47:18.000 --> 47:24.000]  people and you gotta tell me you're the good guys at least a lot of other bad guys
[47:24.000 --> 47:28.000]  in histories were strong willed enough to believe they you know to know they were
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  the bad guys not delusionally believe they were the good guys
[47:30.000 --> 47:35.000]  oh see I take one call like that it just sends me into a red haze of anger
[47:35.000 --> 47:44.000]  oh what are we gonna do what are we they're not gonna stop the bankers are
[47:44.000 --> 47:48.000]  not gonna stop they are not gonna stop raping do you understand that they are
[47:48.000 --> 47:53.000]  not gonna stop I had a national TV host call me yesterday they want to come down
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  here early January and interview me I can't say no even though it'll all be
[47:57.000 --> 48:05.000]  rigged it'll all be taped I have to walk in the lion's den regardless but they
[48:05.000 --> 48:09.000]  are really figuring out that we're waking people up
[48:09.000 --> 48:29.000]  oh man that's just we're an evil country so we're gonna fall period until we
[48:29.000 --> 48:33.000]  repent in the Bible's right folks we it's we've got to individually change
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.000]  ourselves to change the whole this couldn't have happened if on average we
[48:37.000 --> 48:43.000]  weren't a wicked country wicked nations go into bondage period Joe in New York
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.000]  thanks for holding her on the air go ahead hey Alex you are a little crazy
[48:48.000 --> 48:53.000]  but that's alright because once you can have fun with this all and look at it as
[48:53.000 --> 48:58.000]  like a really crazy I mean I'm crazy I've studied history and I know that when
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.000]  the government starts taking over people's kids and having them reporting on
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  their parents that you're in the most hardcore tyranny you could possibly be
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.000]  in and I'm crazy to be upset trying to warn my fellow mammals I mean the
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.000]  chimpanzee a chimpanzee knows how to put out a scream to warn people when a
[49:12.000 --> 49:18.000]  when a lion is about to eat them I mean is that chimpanzee crazy I'm crazy too
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.000]  listen I say in a good way once you can look at the world and see as like a
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  Jonathan Swiss satire and just how crazy everything is around you you're doing
[49:26.000 --> 49:32.000]  okay and I commend you for that but there's a point I want to make here
[49:32.000 --> 49:38.000]  because people do get pessimistic people get you know they shrink and you know
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.000]  when a big moment could find a big people it doesn't happen because people
[49:42.000 --> 49:48.000]  they they cower in fear and just recently people know that when you're cowering
[49:48.000 --> 49:52.000]  is when you're weak oh it is don't understand the evil doesn't go away
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.000]  just because you cower it gets worse you got to stand up and fight it yes it does
[49:56.000 --> 50:01.000]  and just recently I blew up at my town hall meeting with my congressman

[54:19.000 --> 54:23.000]  to kill you paying compliance snatch and grab teams

[54:31.000 --> 54:35.000]  is and
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.000]  they admit they're bribing the senators to vote for the healthcare
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.000]  bill I've got all this news on that I mean it's just total criminals
[54:43.000 --> 54:47.000]  everywhere and they'll burn them
[54:47.000 --> 54:51.000]  governor for going to hookers or for something else a little low level stuff but never
[54:51.000 --> 54:55.000]  the big stuff and they give awards to Bernanke who swindled trillions
[54:55.000 --> 54:59.000]  of dollars the last year from you and won't say where the money went
[54:59.000 --> 55:03.000]  and then they put him up all over the news is this big hero I mean
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.000]  it's just a sick joke it's all a sick
[55:06.000 --> 55:10.000]  joke
[55:10.000 --> 55:14.000]  Joe in New York what did you say to run the scallywag to ground
[55:14.000 --> 55:18.000]  the meeting started out with him talk well it was primarily on healthcare
[55:18.000 --> 55:22.000]  and then I interrupted and I told him he's a liar and that
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.000]  he failed to mention the bailout Wall Street and the city of London
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  and that so long as we can bail out banks and cut healthcare
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.000]  for people that's a fascist policy and then I proceeded to ask
[55:34.000 --> 55:38.000]  him when is he going to stop because my congressman
[55:38.000 --> 55:42.000]  is John Hall I'm not afraid to say it's a free country and
[55:42.000 --> 55:46.000]  he's the trader not me so I told him I
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.000]  very well known to me that he's part of the Nancy Pelosi clique
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.000]  and that he's hiding behind the power financier such as George Soros
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.000]  and Felix Rowatin and that it's just morally reprehensible
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.000]  and at that he scurried away
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  and right out of the room quickly especially after because he tried to tell me
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  the economy is getting better so then I told him
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  then how come in 1968 George Ball called for the
[56:14.000 --> 56:18.000]  intentional destruction of the United States economy to bring in the world corporation
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.000]  and that's when they harried him
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.000]  Oh they said uh oh we got a thinker evacuate evacuate I appreciate
[56:26.000 --> 56:30.000]  your call did you videotape it because the key is videotape
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.000]  your confrontations and put them on the web to show others it's okay because see
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.000]  you know you had to get the courage to go do it and the courage to even say his name
[56:38.000 --> 56:42.000]  that's not courage that's survival that's your instincts kicking in
[56:42.000 --> 56:46.000]  that's becoming human becoming honorable and I salute you Joe
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  but you need to buy a cheap camera and videotape it
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.000]  can I make one more point Alex? you know Joe I really sure I don't be able to get to other callers
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.000]  go ahead all right it'll be very quick um because we're talking about the house and all that
[56:58.000 --> 57:02.000]  there's currently a strategic campaign being run in the country um there's someone
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.000]  running against Barney Frank Nancy Pelosi and P. Olsen out in Texas even
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  um they're all part of the LaRouche youth movement and um
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  they're having websites put up soon and it's I mean they're in the fight just like you are
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.000]  and God bless you Alex and everything you do all right I appreciate your call
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.000]  you know I think the LaRouche people put out good info on
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  what's happening but not good info on the solutions I disagree with their solutions

[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  nice old Farage European Union Member of Parliament from England
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  being head of the
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  British Independence Party that is coming up
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  outspoken critic of the New World Order
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  right now I'm continuing to take your phone calls
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  here today you know we were talking about in the last
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  hour now public school children
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  private school students as well
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  have BATF the Department of Energy the Department of Labor
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  the US Census local power companies in fact in England
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  they run the climate cops one of the biggest power companies
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  trains them how to spy on their parents how their parents are bad
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  Al Gore teaches the kids to rebuke your parents
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  the state's taking your kids away from you and you love it
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  you've been taught that the government and uniforms are God
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  and you're a slave and you have to pay taxes
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  for the air you breathe
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  but every week I see an article like this one
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  where they say an art class draw a picture of your father so they draw a picture of their dad
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  is in the army they get arrested and I've seen multiple cases where it's the last
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  day of school
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  and it's always the valedictorian or the salutator
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  and it's always a woman for some reason always a girl and they
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  buy a cake for their teacher
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  and they have a few friends after school and there's two cases of this
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  that I've seen I've had them both on and the security guards know what to look for
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  they come in and say oh you got a cake
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  did you bring a tablecloth and stuff yeah it's right here in this bag
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  and you pull out the little Dixie cup box of knives spoons
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  forks and they arrest you
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  I mean they're looking for a slave they're looking for somebody to hurt
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  they're looking for somebody to get in a grid
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  but in this case they were asked to draw a Christmas picture
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  and the boy drew a picture of Jesus on the cross
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  that's what he'd seen at church and they suspended him and are now
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  having him do psychological evaluations saying it's violent and all it
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  is is a picture of Jesus on the cross because he goes to church
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  and they don't care the school's not apologizing that's the way it is
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  because it's a crime to draw a picture of Jesus see
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  separation of church and state now means you don't talk about God
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  that's why schools all over the country kids will have a Bible in their bag
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  they'll throw it away and freak out like it's pornography
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  separation of church and state was a letter
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  by a founder to a newspaper
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  it's not in there but the issue is you don't have government running religion
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  not you don't have religion anywhere in the society but the point is
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  just Soviet Union I don't think on the Soviet Union they expelled kids for drawing
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  a picture of a kid on the cross I mean this is the hatred of
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  Christians and you got to remember Trotsky was the main guy that killed millions of Christians
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  in Russia and blew up their churches and in Ukraine
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  and then he got kicked out and came to the U.S. and his top lieutenant
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  was William Crystal's father
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  I mean that's a fact that the neocons are
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  actually just nation records these are revolutionaries and they got

[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com

[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  the genesis communications radio network probably presents
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  music
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  music

[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  yeah that's the freedom of the new America
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  you caught with a plastic knife in your lunchbox you go to jail
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  you draw a picture of your dad on a hunting trip you go to jail
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  they tell you draw a picture for Christmas you get suspended and
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  the biological testing ordered because it was seen as bizarre
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  by them to draw a picture of Jesus on the cross
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  you can see the photo up at infowars.com and prismplanet.com
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  mass boys suspended over Jesus on cross self-portrait
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  the eight year old special needs student boy they just
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  batter those kids that's somebody they probably hit with a bunch of
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  mercury in their shots the eight year old special needs student near Boston will be
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  changing schools after being suspended and given a psychological evaluation
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  for a Christmas drawing of himself as Jesus on the cross
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  but it's not himself he just said that to spin it
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  the boy drew the stick figure crucifixion after his teacher
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  at max ham elementary school asked for a class for his pictures
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  that reminded them of the holidays the Christ figure
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  had X's for eyes and the boy wrote his name above that
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  well what child watching TV wouldn't see stuff like that that alarmed the teacher
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  considered a violent drawing the boy was suspended in order to be evaluated
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  at his parents expense I mean think of all the violent video games
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  the culture says just give your kids and all the violence on TV but then the minute
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  I mean I've seen no exaggeration more than 50 times I mean it's got
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  I'm just estimating probably a hundred you've seen it over and over again where
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  you'll have some 14 year old no criminal
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  record on the football team in one case
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  was for creative writing in the sophomore
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  year in high school writes a story about
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  zombies attacking a fictitious high school
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  and his parents reported him and the school commended them
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  and he was arrested and it's now been charged facing
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  all these years in prison for planning an attack on the school
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  and the police are on record saying well we I mean folks
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  for fiction articles they arrest you now
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  well that's zero tolerance
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  you always hear we found out about a plan to
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  bomb the school and you find out it's always some
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  essay written
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  see do as we say not as we do put all this violence and stuff
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  out in the culture all the new top video games
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  you rape and kill prostitutes for money are you walking to airports and run false flags
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  killing US citizens to blame it on your enemies you know people fantasizing of the government
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  staging terror oh I mean I know multiple top games
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  right now you do that like Call of Duty and others I can show you the video
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  Russian stage false flags the American stage false flags of course
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  the real Army manual 2004 teaches
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  Army captains how to stage terror attacks I mean they're teaching captains
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  how to stage terror attacks and then the video games teach them how to do it too
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  but God forbid you draw a picture of Jesus baby you're going to jail
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  you're going to jail
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  you're getting kicked out of school you're getting a psychological
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  evaluation this is the secret police grid in America
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  with all of our
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  psychological minders see they start political correctness
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  with something that sounds reasonable don't deny that Hitler was bad and killed a bunch of people
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  or will arrest you don't use the N word or will arrest
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  you and then at next it's don't deny global warming's man made or will arrest you
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  they're calling for Lord Moncton in the London Guardian to be arrested
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  and executed
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  anyone who questions at a press conference is arrested or
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  detained you have press credentials at a UN event
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  you go up and ask about climate gate men with guns run up and drag you out
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  oh that's freedom we've been trained to be slaves
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  we have to rediscover what freedom is let me just tell you
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  in a free society half the billboards driving down the highway aren't government
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  admonishments bossing you around setting the precedent that they're the bosses
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  and you're the criminals I mean you go watch a movie like
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  running man released in 1984 and every other billboard is a government
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  announcement and announcements about how to turn family members in
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  now I turn on Austin news and see Austin police department adds
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  enrolling children with credit cards they get 200 bucks
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  when you turn into family member I'm living in the running man
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  we're only one step away from Ben Richards going to his brother's apartment
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  saying where is my brother well after you got arrested Mr. Richards
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  he got complained so he got permanently detained
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  that means killed
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  and Ben Richards looks up in shock
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  now they're starting
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  the snatching grabs of citizens they have created
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  giant cadres of criminal CIA officers and
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  private contractors who think it's funny to grab citizens off the street
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  in a bag over their head or come in your house at night and drag you off and you're never seen again
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  they like torturing people they like hacking fingers off with hatchets
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  you know Chuck Norris made movies like Delta Force where the Muslims put
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  drills into our troops legs did you know actually the CIA manual
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  they use drills on people that's what they do
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  oh but it's bad when the Muslims use drills fictitiously
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  but when our government uses drills it's good
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  Jeffrey Dahmer use drills on people
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  but it's bad when he does it but not bad when the CIA does it
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  we have a bankrupt moral
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  government it's morally bankrupt it's rotten rotten to
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  its very maggot filled core
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  and the sooner we wake up to that the better
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  now you think 23.7 trillion
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  that's a four month old number it's probably over 30 trillion following the graph but
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  23.7 trillion stolen is bad
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  when they start gutting the dollar which is already beginning
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  but when they devalue it by two thirds that's probably what they're going to go at least half
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  in just the next year or so that's currently what they're doing
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  the standard of living
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  you'll have less jobs lower pay but things
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  will cost more hyper depression
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  an inflationary depression the worst thing there is
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  they didn't have that during the great depression it was just a depression
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  there wasn't inflation it was actual deflation
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  hyper
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  stag inflation is what I call it stagnation with inflation
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  now
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  we could go after the bankers we could
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  expose them as the criminals and that's what I keep pointing out bypass the Republicans and Democrats
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  point out the source of the dictatorship the source of the fraud
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  Bernanke, Paulson, Summers, Rubin
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  that's why you see all the news now just saying Bernanke is God
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  Bernanke will save you he's man of the year he he kept you from having a depression
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  he loves you
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  the policies and have told the world to go ahead and devalue the dollar
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  the decision was made in the last three G20 meetings here is the times of London today
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  I have another London Telegraph article also an AP article on this
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  Gulf Petro powers to launch currency in latest threat to
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  dollar hegemony the Arab states of the Gulf region
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  have agreed to launch a single currency modeled on the euro hoping to blaze a trail
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  towards a pan-american monetary union swelling to the ancient
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  borders
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  and then it goes into one of the
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  Turkish Imams Ottoman Empire so they want the whole
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  system from Turkey into Afghanistan to have
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  this new currency the Gulf Monetary Union pact has come into
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  effect said Kuwait's finance minister Mustafa Al
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  Shamali speaking at the Gulf Cooperation Summit
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  at GCC summit Kuwait the move will give the
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  hyper rich club of oil exporters a petro currency of their own
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  greatly increasing their influence folks that is the end of the dollar because
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  you got about half the fuel in the world being bought from these guys
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  little more than half and
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  they're saying we're not going to take your stinking dollars you got to transfer your euros your dollars
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  whatever the case is into our petro dollar and the dollars been the petro
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  dollar that's it I'm going to cover this more coming up in the next
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  segment before Nigel Farage joins us from England but I wanted to bring Ted Anderson
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  up Ted this is it this is the end of the dollar guaranteed
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  they're launching it this is the end there may be some
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  big currency wars some type of North American currency may come roaring back later
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  that's how they'll sell it but regardless for the average American
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  you think you're in bad financial straits you will get at least twice as bad now
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  because of this and this will start hitting in the next 12 months Ted Anderson
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  yeah I was looking at the same article this morning Alex and they say it right here
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  it says the US dollar has failed and we need to delink ourselves
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  from the US dollar that's why the Arabs are trying to get away from it
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  and they're saying you got to buy oil from us in this so that's the end of the dollar
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  this is it it really is it was the last reason why countries like China
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  had to have US dollars as reserves because they needed to use it to buy
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  energy but everybody's hearing about how great
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  Bernanke is how evil Tiger Woods is and we're hearing about
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  Obama's wife's latest dress because
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  Ted that's what really matters you know will the Cowboys win next Sunday
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  Ted not the total destruction of our future Ted
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  no you're right about that Alex and gold is running up today went up to 1140
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  and it's been a strong marketing goal and here we are back on that
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  as you said a week ago when it when it plunged and Bob Chapman others have
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  predicted the correction that it would go down maybe a hundred maybe more
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  and then surge right back up in the new year go past it
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  and to explain it people had positions they were dumping it and profit taking
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  they've been short gold a bunch of central banks went in to try to drive it down
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  but it's like a beach ball they can only hold it down so long and the longer they hold it down
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  the more explosively it comes up you're right about that and that's what's going
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  on right now the dollar is hit taking a hit again today there was a lot of
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  propping up of the dollar that occurred here in the last week week and a half
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  did take a dive down to about 1116 it's jumping right back
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  up again the market is becoming bullish I mean I just
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  I had a great opportunity to accumulate things at lower prices
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  I think we should talk about that yeah folks get your pens and paper ready so you can check
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  these deals for yourself and see how good they are quickly I'm going to get more into this article
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  or group of articles as they dump the dollar as the dollar dies
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  as the world reserve currency and the yuppies have no idea what's
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  even happening they're just sucking their thumbs

[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  I have tremendous influence on our president in congress
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  all of us as American citizens to pay attention

[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  unconsciousness
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  I'd like to have another
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  kiss
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  another flashing
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  chance
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  another kiss
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  another kiss
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  we're going live at prismplanet.tv
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  at the start of the next segment
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  fire out the gold and silver you've got
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  did you have any left from the really low price from a month or so ago
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  when gold made its dip or is the new lower prices you've got
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  the latest dip despite the fact that I don't know gold's up 30 something bucks the last two days
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  when gold shot it up to $1,240 an ounce
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  we pretty well sold out of that stuff that we had down there at that 1,050 range
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  right now I'm working at about 1116 which obviously
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  is a good buy when we're looking at $1,140 an ounce today
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  Frank's right now are at 260 they were just
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  up to 266 here just a short time ago I was able
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  to drop the price accordingly because of that the British sovereigns right now
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  at 322 are going to cost closer to 328
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  the Montana silver coin people are starting to take a look at those
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  it's the Montana people trying to set up their own currency
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  I don't blame them for doing it right now they're at $20.99
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  they just came up off of that $22 level and the
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  the Lakota coin right now is at 2319 and everybody knows that one
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  is at $225 so there's a lot of things that are going on right now in the marketplace
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  I was able to buy in here I'm guessing that we'll be back up over that
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  $1,200 an ounce just like Bob Chapin had said it would I mean we're watching
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  the dollar right now and like you said oil separating from the US
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  dollar means that there's going to be a tremendous weakness in the dollar because there's
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  a lot of countries that are sitting on reserves and they're going to be needing to sell
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  to get out on to another currency in order to buy this energy now
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  absolutely Ted
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  I mean I just hope that people do get involved in gold and silver because
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  there's not much more you can do to defend yourself against the bankers and how they've
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  purposefully set up the fall of the dollar again they ran the dollar up
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  they printed tens of trillions of it and issued it issued debt on
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  its back on the taxpayers now they're announcing that they're just
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  going to devalue it and then on top of the devaluation that Americans are going to have to have
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  devalue added tax and a sales tax and they're having all the fake conservatives
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  and neocons and fake libertarians like Beck and O'Reilly
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  say that it's conservative to have tax hikes instead of
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  just saying no the government tripled under Bush quadrupled the first
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  year under Obama we need to reduce the size of government
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  no instead they're just going to basically hold you by your ankles and shake every
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  dime out of your pocket and now is the time to get into gold and silver
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  Ted throw out the offer tell folks the gold and silver that you've got and just how good
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  a deal it is because I've seen the numbers yeah the Franks currently right now
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  are 260 British sovereigns at 322 Montana
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  silver coins I mean I'm looking at $18 silver now it's
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  poking into that level that's going to be back up there at that $22 level
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  instead of 2099 Lakota's are going to be going up too I mean everything
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  that I have I've accumulated lately at that
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  $1116 level you know
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  I'm you know what do you do I mean I run out of inventory and now
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  I'm going to have to buy in closer to 240 or 1140 and
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  you know we're looking at $1,200 I just need to tell you right now
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  there's just too many things that are happening the dollars going to be in trouble and I think
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  you should call 1-800-686-2237
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  get involved in this market man if you've been sitting on the sideline because
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  you think gold was too high at that $1,200 level right now you're
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  getting that opportunity to buy it at about $100 less and I just
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  have to tell you I think it's a great time to be doing it and you should be doing it before we hit
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  the new year here because like you say the Christmas time happens to be a lol for
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  gold historically January happens to be a time where it all bounces
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  back up again and I have no expectation that it's going to go the other
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  direction not at this point not with what's going on in the global economy
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  800-686-2237
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  800-686-2237
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  Ted buys it when it's low
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  sells it for low when it's high that's his free market system
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  it's like getting in a time machine and going back and buying gold when it was less
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  same thing with silver 800-686
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  2237 and it's key to tell
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:10.000]  them it's the Alex Jones Ted Anderson radio special or you will be paying the higher
[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  price which is also a discounted great deal but to get the lower
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  price 800-686-2237
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  800-686-2237
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  take action today
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  or check out mitusresources.com Ted thank you so

[1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:05.000]  of the Irish saying no to the Lisbon Treaty
[1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:08.000]  you had rammed that treaty through the British Parliament
[1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:12.000]  and you've done it breaking a specific
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:14.000]  you see I said you were popular
[1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:17.000]  you did it breaking a specific messed up pledge
[1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  that you would give the British people a referendum on the constitutional treaty
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  shame on you Prime Minister for doing that
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  you have devalued democracy in our country
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  you have devalued the trust that voters have got in you as a British Prime Minister
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  but of course we know the reason why
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  the reason why is that we would have voted no
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  you said in your speech that none but those on the extremes
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  oppose European Union
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  well that may be right amongst professional career politicians
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  but a clear majority of the British people
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  want us to have friendship and free trade with the European Union
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  but do not want to be members of this political union
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  you cannot continue against public opinion
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  to build this European Union
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  if you do it against the will of the people
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  you are storing up enormous social and political problems for the future
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  please please let the peoples of Europe decide their destiny
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  don't have it done in parliaments like this
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  and parliaments like Westminster
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  it won't work
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  and as far as the economy is concerned
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  you've told us that somehow you're the economic guru
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  you're the man that can save the world
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  well I remember very well
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  your first big actors Chancellor
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  when you sold 400 metric tons of gold
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  to the world's exchanges at $275 an ounce
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  at today's valuation that would be $10 billion higher
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  but it isn't just the fact you got it wrong
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  because we can all get it wrong
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  it was the fact that you announced in advance
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  how much you were going to sell
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  and on what day you were going to sell it
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  it was an era so basic that the average A-level economic student
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  even in these educationally devalued times
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  wouldn't have done
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  and after that you've destroyed our private pension system
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  you took away from the Bank of England
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  its ability to regulate the banks
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  and gave it to the tick box bureaucrats at the FSA in Canary Wharf
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  and we haven't heard an apology
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  your government has apologized for the Ambritsar massacre
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  you've apologized for slavery
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  you've apologized for virtually everything
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  will you please apologize for what you did as British Chancellor
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  and then perhaps we might just listen to you
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  thank you
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  through the fractions
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  find out more about it
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  well that's Nigel Farage
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  member of the European Union Parliament from England
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  also the head of the UK Independence Party
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  one of the fastest growing parties in the UK
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  he just resigned from that position
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  so he can run against someone in higher office
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  he'll explain to us all the intricacies of that
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  but we're very very excited to have Mr. Farage on with us
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  thank you for joining us
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  thank you very much indeed
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  the website is UKIP.org
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  or UK Independence Party
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  for Americans that don't know who you are
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  a lot of folks know who Lord Moncton is and others
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  and you have a lot of fans here as well
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  for standing up against EU corruption and tyranny
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  in a nutshell tell us about yourself
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  about the UK Independence Party
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  and why you've resigned as the head of your party
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  to intensify the fight
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  I was in business
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  I left school
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  I went straight into the city of London
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  and I was going about a fairly normal life
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  you know I played four handicapped golf
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  I went to the local pub on Sunday lunch times
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  I had children growing up at school
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  I was running a business in the city
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  and to all intents and purposes
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  I wasn't involved in politics
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  on a day-to-day basis at all
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  but in the early 1990s
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  I saw a disastrous attempt
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  by the British government
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  with no opposition at all
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  to peg the level of sterling against the Deutsche Market
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  it was called the exchange rate mechanism
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  and I predicted that it would go badly wrong
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  and sure enough it did
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  and then I realized that this was part of a bigger project
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  a project that the British political elite
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  were engaged in
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  along with the elites from the other European countries
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  and that was to take something
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  that we'd been told was a common market
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  a European economic community
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  but actually
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  surreptitiously and without ever telling the truth
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  or giving anyone a say
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  to turn that into a political union
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  and the day I realized
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  that whether it was Labour or Conservative
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  it made no difference because their high commands
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  were all sold
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  by this idea of a new
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  supranational form of European government
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  I thought I can't live with this anymore
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  I thought I've got to get involved in politics
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  and so I did
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  and so about 12 of us sat in a room
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  in the early-mid-1990s
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  and we formed the UK Independence Party
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  and our battle is
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  we want to be friends with our European neighbors
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  we want to trade with them
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  we want to cooperate with them
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  and we're quite happy for people from Paris
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  to work in London and vice versa
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  what we don't want is for the situation
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  by 75%
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  of our laws that are made every year
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  are made in foreign institutions
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  and so through the 90s
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  this became kind of a crusade for me I guess
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  and in the end I was elected
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  to the European Parliament in 1999
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  we were still then a very small party
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  but the things that we've been saying
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  are now really hitting home with the British public
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  and in the European elections
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  this year in June
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  UK Independence Party
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  came second across the entire
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  United Kingdom
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  so that's a fantastic
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  rate of progress
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  we've got the British public with us
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  we're educating them, they're coming on side
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  with our point of view
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  I find myself now
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  leading the opposition group in the European Parliament
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  I've got 33 MEPs
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  from several different countries
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  who've got the same opinion
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  so I am the voice of opposition
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  inside this European Parliament
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  but I was also having to run
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  the United Kingdom as well
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  and given that we've got a general election coming up
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  in about six months time
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  the prospect of running a group here
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  and of leading a campaign
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  with 550 candidates
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  for the National Parliament
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  the party's outgrown one man doing it
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  so I've stood down as leader of the National Party
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  I'm staying on
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  for the moment as leader of the group in the Parliament
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  and I'm breaking
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  with what's supposed to be a convention
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  and that is the speaker
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  of the House of Commons
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  and any of you that watch Prime Minister's Question Time
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  you know the great punch and duty
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  show that we have in Westminster once a week
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  we'll see there's a guy in the chair
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  who's the speaker, well the new guy we've got
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  I consider wholly unsuitable
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  and in previous times
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  he was always reelected unopposed
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  but I'm now taking him on
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  and I'm fighting him for his Westminster seat
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  in the next general election
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  so you are boldly taking action
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  and you've been very successful in business previously
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  I did great in college
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  you know had a successful business career
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  you were forced to go into this
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  extremely eloquent
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  you absolutely just
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  have devastated
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  Von Ruhm Pooey
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  and Gordon Brown in the European Parliament
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  you
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  the papers in Europe really are singling you out
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  as the leading force energizing
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  people from across Europe
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  that know that the European Union
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  has become dictatorial
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  if nations vote to get out of it
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  they just expand it
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  they've lied in England for those that don't know
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  please enlighten our audience
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  saying that the British people
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  would get to vote on whether or not
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  they went under EU control
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  but that's being done by stealth
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  just like the United States is being brought into the European
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  Union sway
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  through agreements
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  and through the North American Union
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  agreement of the SPP
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  we have the SPP documents where they talk about
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  this being done by stealth
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  we have the Club of Rome documents
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  we have the EU documents
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  we have Von Ruhm Pooey now
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  saying it's a global government
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  I mean this really is a group of
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  would-be dictators
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  and so your fight on the continent
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  against this is so important
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  when we have UK polls
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  of over 80%
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  don't want to be part of the EU
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  but still England is being sucked
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  by this octopus in
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  down for us
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  a European Union member of parliament
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  Nigel Farage
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  what's happening in the European Union
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  is not happening in isolation
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  we have a political class across the world
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  that are basically aiming
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  for a form of global governance
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  if you don't believe me
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  look at what's happening as we speak in Copenhagen
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  I mean what's happening there
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  is governments are sitting around a table
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  trying to sign us up
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  to treat us
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  as a very questionable
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  concept
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  of global warming caused by CO2 emissions
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  but if they get these deals
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  in theory
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  we're bound for the next 20 or 30 years
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  and it doesn't matter who we vote for
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  and my take on this
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  is that the real battle that is going on
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  in the western world right now
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  it's a battle of democracy
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  versus bureaucracy
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  and the bureaucrats
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  and our arrogant politicians at the moment
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  are starting to win
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  we're starting to win with public opinion
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  and in the end
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  they can push these things as far as they like
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  but in the end public opinion
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  will tear all of this down
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  and frankly as far as I'm concerned
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  the sooner the better
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  and I'm doing this and I'm saying these things
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  and yes I'm being singled out by the European media
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  because there's virtually nobody else in elected politics from Britain
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  that has actually got the courage
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  to stand up and say it
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  and people sidle up to me and lift
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  their MEPs and MPs
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  and say oh well Nigel you know
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  we're very pleased that you've got the courage
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  to stand up and say these things
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  because we agree with you
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  well they might agree with us
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  but they're not saying it
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  so I'm going to go on fighting these people
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  and I believe that I'm going to go on winning
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  the battle for public opinion
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  not just in Britain
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  but right across Europe too
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  and I hope act as a bit of a warning
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:29.000]  to you guys in the states as well
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  thank you
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  oh it absolutely is
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  two years ago
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  a judicial watch
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  a public interest law firm sued
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  and got all this because they wouldn't release it
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  through four year but they finally did
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  and Bush in 2005
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  signed a treaty saying
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  we're already part of an American union
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  with his private corporate board
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  running things
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  but our national media will not
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  talk about it
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  the European union celebrated 50 years
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  but I thought it wasn't founded till
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  2000 so you have this
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  European union by stealth
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  through an economic agreement
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  and then now they admit it's a union
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  and the same thing is happening here
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  but you spoke about
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  a huge awakening taking place
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  you spoke about the fact
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  that if we just point out
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  what illegitimate tyrants these people are
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  that they will fall
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  and you talk about people thanking you
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  and go out and do it alone
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  we have the moral high ground
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  we have the law on our side
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  we have history on our side
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  the problem is the bureaucracy has all the big banks
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  and the big money
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  that want to set up their own private
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  global corporate government
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  behind them so speak specifically
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  to the state of the world
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  from your in-depth position
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  as a key member of the European union parliament
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  from England and tie that
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  into Copenhagen and the open announcements
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  of Paul Gore, Gordon Brown
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  Herman von Rupey and all of them
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  openly saying this is
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  world government through this environmentalist
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  tyranny.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  What they do of course
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  and it's a well established technique
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  they try and use any crisis
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  now whether it's a real crisis
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  or whether it's a crisis
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  of their invention
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  they use the crisis to extend
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  the argument for
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  a loss of democracy
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  loss of freedom of the individual
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  and the increasing global governance
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  and I can think of two
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  very good examples of this
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  the first of course is the so called
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  war on terror
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  that you know we face a threat from Al Qaeda
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  or whoever else it may be
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  and because of this
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  we have to give the state
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  more power over our lives
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  and a lot of the
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  judicial safeguards that we've enjoyed
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  in Britain are now being thrown out of the window
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  in the name
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  the war on terror
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  and they're being used against non-terrorist
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  and they're being used, well of course
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  this is what happens isn't it
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  this is what happens is that
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  once governments, once police forces
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:05.000]  once they have these extra powers
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  they of course then use them in any way
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  that they see fit and I'm afraid
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  that the result of this
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  now nine year nearly war on terror
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  is that
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  our loss of individual freedoms
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  across the western world is simply
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:21.000]  enormous, it's as if the terrorists
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  have won because our own politicians
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  have used this
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  as an excuse to get more power
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:29.000]  similarly the same phenomenon
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:31.000]  is happening with global warming
[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  and I mean Al Gore, I mean
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:35.000]  God help us
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  here's a man
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:39.000]  who lost the presidential election
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  who has now
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  gone on to make many millions himself
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  and this shouldn't be forgotten
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  he's made many millions himself
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  out of this, this scaremongering
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  frankly, absolute scaremongering
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  over
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  whether CO2 emissions, as he says
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  are inextricably leading to temperatures
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  going up, now of course the fact
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:01.000]  that we know the temperatures have
[1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  not gone up, they've actually now gone down
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  since 1998 or 2002
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  depending where you set the bar
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  is irrelevant, but it's
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  now they've changed it to weather
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  changes, climate
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  changes are natural
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  well that's right and you know
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  they were hooked on global warming
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  they say global warming less now because
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  it's cooling, but anytime
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  there's a hurricane, anytime there's a flood
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  anytime anything happens we're told
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  this is because of CO2 emissions
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  and we have the amazing situation
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  with Copenhagen where
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  we may or may not be signing up
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  for some new ridiculous deal over the next few weeks
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  and I mean we've just
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  just give an example of how mad this is
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  we've just seen
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  Britain's oldest steelworks
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  up in a place called Middlesbrough
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  in the northeast of England that steelworks
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  announced last week that it's closing down
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  in doing so
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  the parent company
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  an Indian firm called Tata
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  will be given 600 million
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  pounds worth of carbon
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  credits, right, for closing down that
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  for closing down that plant
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  and then
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  what will happen is all of that production
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  will shift across to India
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  who of course have no intention
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  of listening to any of this stuff
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  I mean in the name
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  of fighting
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  against carbon emissions
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  we're actually
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  literally exporting jobs from our country
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  to countries like India
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  which clearly makes no sense at all
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  and we've got a situation
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  where we're going to be signed up to
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  trees which means that we can't
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  change these agreements
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  by how we vote at future elections
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  now the whole principle
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  of democracy
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  whatever level it's at
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  sovereignty
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  sovereignty is
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  all about not being dominated
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  by some foreign
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  offshore corporation
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  British East India company or empire
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  but a member of parliament
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  a member of European parliament
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  I want you to get into this key point here in just a moment
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  but I don't want to just run over the key fact
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  you just laid out as we got a break here
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  you just pointed out
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  not only are they paying them
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  hundreds of thousands of pounds
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  hundreds of thousands not millions of dollars
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  to shut a steel mill down
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  in the UK and jobs
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  but when they go to India
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  there'll be zero
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  emissions control so even if you believe
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  carbon dioxide
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  is this murderous toxic waste
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  chemical weapon even if you believe that fraud
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  and polar bears can't swim and all the rest of it
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  penguins are drowning
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  the most incredible aquatic birds there are
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  the ice caps are getting bigger
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  even if you believe all that
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  this will produce more CO2
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  under the UN's plan is what you're saying
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  absolutely and you know
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  the other big response in Europe
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  to this is we are building
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  tens of thousands
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  of these ludicrous windmills
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  right across Europe
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  and we're told this is wonderful
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  this will be a wonderful source of renewable energy
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  now I'm not against the concept
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  of renewable energy but I'll tell you this
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  in Germany they built
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  19,000 wind turbines
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  but not a single coal, oil
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  or gas fired power station has closed down
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  because in the depths of winter
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  when a big anticyclone
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  sits over northern Europe
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  not a single one of those 19,000 wind turbines
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  moves around and produces
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  any electricity
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  even if cutting carbon emissions
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  was vital to the environment
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  the way we're going about it is mad
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  bad and wrong
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  absolutely we're going to break
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  we'll come back and finish the point I interrupted you on
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  but it's not a windmills fine on your house
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  because you don't have power
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  lost down the lines
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  I have family that works in different power stations
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  here in Texas
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  you lose tons of power
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  down line
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  you have to have incredible power just to get it
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  to places the power is too low from windmills
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  to let you transfer it
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  and transport it so you lose most of it
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  it's very wasteful

[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  Union parliament
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:23.000] ometer
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:28.200]  Well, in England, and we've got him for another 35 minutes with us, we really appreciate him
[1:54:28.200 --> 1:54:29.200]  joining us.
[1:54:29.200 --> 1:54:30.200]  He's a very busy man.
[1:54:30.200 --> 1:54:33.760]  Okay, sir, I interrupted you when you were getting on to the point about the fact that
[1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:37.840]  this is dictatorial, and then I wanted to ask you, are we beginning to get headway?
[1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:38.840]  Are we winning?
[1:54:38.840 --> 1:54:44.480]  And being around these European Union members for close to a decade, I mean, they're openly
[1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:47.080]  on television saying dictatorial world government.
[1:54:47.080 --> 1:54:48.840]  What do they say behind the scenes?
[1:54:48.840 --> 1:54:49.840]  Go ahead, Mr. Farage.
[1:54:49.840 --> 1:54:54.840]  Right, let's just consider what concept democracy is.
[1:54:54.840 --> 1:55:01.200]  Now, there's an old saying, an old Westminster saying, and I'm going back now to the English
[1:55:01.200 --> 1:55:06.880]  Civil War in the 17th century, and the whole point about electing people to our House of
[1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:12.680]  Commons, to our Parliament in Westminster, was that no parliament may bind its successor.
[1:55:12.680 --> 1:55:18.480]  Now, that may be old-fashioned English, but what it actually means is there's nothing
[1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:23.640]  in a proper democratic parliament that is nothing that one government or one parliament
[1:55:23.640 --> 1:55:30.080]  does that cannot be undone by any successive government or parliament, right?
[1:55:30.080 --> 1:55:32.320]  That's why we have elections for goodness sake.
[1:55:32.320 --> 1:55:39.200]  Now the whole point about European Union, for example, is we currently face a mass of
[1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:45.040]  regulations that are going to do severe damage to the city of London, to our financial services
[1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:47.720]  sector where I spent 20 years on my working life.
[1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:51.760]  And once those regulations have gone through, it won't matter a damn whether David Cameron
[1:55:51.760 --> 1:55:56.400]  becomes a Prime Minister or Gordon Brown gets re-elected because there's nothing we can
[1:55:56.400 --> 1:56:02.320]  do as voters in Britain to change those European laws, so that is an absolute total denial
[1:56:02.320 --> 1:56:03.320]  of democracy.
[1:56:03.320 --> 1:56:10.560]  And it turns your parliament into a vestigial ceremonial dress of the European Union.
[1:56:10.560 --> 1:56:17.240]  Yeah, the whole thing has become a complete charade because 75% of our laws are made somewhere
[1:56:17.240 --> 1:56:21.960]  else, and that's before they got this new European Constitutional Treaty passed.
[1:56:21.960 --> 1:56:26.160]  And now we're told that even in areas like foreign policy, we can't do our own thing.
[1:56:26.160 --> 1:56:28.240]  We'll have to do it at a European level.
[1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:30.560]  So it is literally, it is the death.
[1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:35.240]  Being part of a European Union, this European Union, is the death of democracy.
[1:56:35.240 --> 1:56:40.480]  I believe the very same principles apply to these agreements that started back at the
[1:56:40.480 --> 1:56:45.360]  time of Kyoto and could be coming out of Copenhagen over the next period of time, because if
[1:56:45.360 --> 1:56:52.840]  we sign up to a series, if Obama signs up and if Britain signs up to a whole set of
[1:56:52.840 --> 1:56:59.760]  targets 20, 30 years hence from now, then by definition, you've broken that principle
[1:56:59.760 --> 1:57:02.720]  of no parliament may bind its successor.
[1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:07.680]  Now of course, we're always told that, you know, we have to operate together.
[1:57:07.680 --> 1:57:13.720]  We have to operate at a European level or a global level to deal with the CO2 crisis
[1:57:13.720 --> 1:57:16.600]  or the war on terror or whatever else it may be.
[1:57:16.600 --> 1:57:19.280]  But that is a complete denial of democracy.
[1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:22.640]  And I've been fighting and making these points.
[1:57:22.640 --> 1:57:28.080]  And during the last few years, we've had the French in a referendum saying no.
[1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:30.600]  We've had the Dutch in a referendum saying no.
[1:57:30.600 --> 1:57:33.840]  We've had the Irish in a referendum saying no.
[1:57:33.840 --> 1:57:37.340]  The British of course, who were promised referendums all the way through, have just
[1:57:37.340 --> 1:57:38.840]  been denied them.
[1:57:38.840 --> 1:57:44.800]  But as I start to make these arguments, I can see the fear in the eyes of the leaders
[1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:47.520]  of this European Union project.
[1:57:47.520 --> 1:57:49.600]  I sit on the front bench of this parliament.
[1:57:49.600 --> 1:57:54.360]  I'm literally within feet of these people that are doing this to our democracy.
[1:57:54.360 --> 1:57:58.000]  And I can see the fear in their eyes when I make these arguments, because they know
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:03.400]  what I'm saying is right, and their response to me has been truly extraordinary.
[1:58:03.400 --> 1:58:07.360]  And there are clips that you could find on the EU parliament website.
[1:58:07.360 --> 1:58:12.040]  I've been called mentally ill because of what I stand for, which of course is very
[1:58:12.040 --> 1:58:13.040]  reminiscent, isn't it?
[1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:16.920]  Well, they've said you're a naked monkey up in a tree, and then when you try to defend
[1:58:16.920 --> 1:58:19.960]  yourself, you're told you can't name call.
[1:58:19.960 --> 1:58:30.000]  So it's like some Kafka-esque Soviet apparatchik court where it's la-la land.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:33.400]  They can call you names, but you can't have free speech.
[1:58:33.400 --> 1:58:37.520]  You can't criticize the EU, but they can call you a naked monkey.
[1:58:37.520 --> 1:58:39.160]  By the way, that clip is coming up.
[1:58:39.160 --> 1:58:40.160]  Stay there.
[1:58:40.160 --> 1:58:42.200]  Nigel Farage is our guest.

[1:58:57.160 --> 1:59:01.480]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:59:01.480 --> 1:59:05.800]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:59:05.800 --> 1:59:07.120]  allows you to have.
[1:59:07.120 --> 1:59:12.840]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:59:12.840 --> 1:59:17.160]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:59:17.160 --> 1:59:21.160]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:59:21.160 --> 1:59:24.640]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:59:24.640 --> 1:59:28.360]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[1:59:28.360 --> 1:59:33.040]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:59:33.040 --> 1:59:36.880]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:59:36.880 --> 1:59:38.280]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[1:59:55.680 --> 1:59:58.040]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:59:58.040 --> 2:00:07.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:07.480 --> 2:00:12.280]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:00:12.280 --> 2:00:13.280]  You want answers?
[2:00:13.280 --> 2:00:15.440]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:15.440 --> 2:00:19.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:19.600 --> 2:00:25.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:25.120 --> 2:00:32.600]  Nigel Farage is our guest, UK member of the European Union Parliament, the leader of opposition
[2:00:32.600 --> 2:00:36.960]  to the New World Order in government in Europe.
[2:00:36.960 --> 2:00:42.680]  This is the man who is eloquently every week standing up to these people.
[2:00:42.680 --> 2:00:47.440]  Now they just turn his mic off, call him names, and then don't let him respond.
[2:00:47.440 --> 2:00:51.440]  The United Nations all over Copenhagen has their armed police on the streets declaring
[2:00:51.440 --> 2:00:57.880]  in a UN zone, at accredited press events, if you ask Al Gore or the IPCC head about
[2:00:57.880 --> 2:01:00.520]  Climate Gate, you are drug out at gunpoint.
[2:01:00.520 --> 2:01:03.080]  I mean, these are authoritarians.
[2:01:03.080 --> 2:01:07.760]  These are the children of Joe Stalin, of Mao Zedong, of Adolf Hitler.
[2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:09.560]  And when I say that, I mean it.
[2:01:09.560 --> 2:01:10.720]  I've watched them.
[2:01:10.720 --> 2:01:14.680]  They want control, and they want to squash all dissent.
[2:01:14.680 --> 2:01:19.400]  Nigel Farage, you've been around them for nine years with these vipers.
[2:01:19.400 --> 2:01:20.720]  How would you describe them?
[2:01:20.720 --> 2:01:26.240]  They are truly dreadful people, and I don't by that mean I disagree with their point of
[2:01:26.240 --> 2:01:27.240]  view.
[2:01:27.240 --> 2:01:28.880]  They are truly dreadful people.
[2:01:28.880 --> 2:01:31.120]  They will stop at nothing to get their goal.
[2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:33.400]  I remember a nice little anecdote.
[2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:38.680]  On the night of the Dutch referendum a few years ago on the EU constitution, and the
[2:01:38.680 --> 2:01:42.720]  result came out and two-thirds of the Dutch had said, no, we don't want this.
[2:01:42.720 --> 2:01:49.120]  And I was with about 50 skeptics in the European Parliament, in the members bar, having a bit
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:54.480]  of a party, celebrating what I hoped would be the triumph of democracy over bureaucracy.
[2:01:54.480 --> 2:02:01.080]  And at that moment, a German MEP, a guy called Mr. Leinem, walked past me, and he'd be one
[2:02:01.080 --> 2:02:03.880]  of the authors of this constitution.
[2:02:03.880 --> 2:02:08.840]  And I said to him, oh, Joe, I said, do you want to join us for a drink to celebrate democracy
[2:02:08.840 --> 2:02:09.840]  in the Netherlands?
[2:02:09.840 --> 2:02:11.360]  And he looked at me.
[2:02:11.360 --> 2:02:13.480]  He said, no, I won't accept your drink.
[2:02:13.480 --> 2:02:16.760]  He said, in any way, you enjoy your little victories tonight.
[2:02:16.760 --> 2:02:19.440]  He said, we have 50 different ways to win.
[2:02:19.440 --> 2:02:23.600]  And it was chilling, because it just about summed it up.
[2:02:23.600 --> 2:02:28.080]  There is literally nothing that will stop these people from achieving their goal.
[2:02:28.080 --> 2:02:29.080]  They are fanatics.
[2:02:29.080 --> 2:02:32.840]  You know, we got rid of Mussolini and Hitler.
[2:02:32.840 --> 2:02:35.800]  We got rid of what would seem to be those extreme nationalisms.
[2:02:35.800 --> 2:02:40.360]  Well, we've got a new one now, and it's called the European Union, and it's every bit as
[2:02:40.360 --> 2:02:42.640]  dangerous as those things that went before.
[2:02:42.640 --> 2:02:48.000]  I was reading the Treaty of Rome, 1957, that really established the EU, and it states that
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:49.720]  by stealth.
[2:02:49.720 --> 2:02:56.080]  And they talk about, oh, we've learned from Napoleon and Hitler not to do this militarily.
[2:02:56.080 --> 2:03:00.680]  We're going to do this via bureaucracy and taxation and creeping.
[2:03:00.680 --> 2:03:07.080]  This is a premeditated system funded by mega rich that want monopolies using communists
[2:03:07.080 --> 2:03:12.120]  as their henchmen who just want a piece of the middle classes pie.
[2:03:12.120 --> 2:03:17.400]  I mean, this is a truly piratical group from my study who know they're criminal.
[2:03:17.400 --> 2:03:19.800]  I mean, this is a very wicked group.
[2:03:19.800 --> 2:03:25.560]  How many of them are just true acolytes who believe in collectivism, and how many of them
[2:03:25.560 --> 2:03:26.560]  are true pirates?
[2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:31.720]  Well, that's always a tough one to answer, but I can tell you, I mean, you know, we've
[2:03:31.720 --> 2:03:37.560]  had for the last five years one of the European commissioners, a man from Hungary, Mr. Kovacs,
[2:03:37.560 --> 2:03:43.280]  who was for many, many years the right-hand man of the dictator, Mr. Kovacs, in Hungary,
[2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:47.240]  a fully paid up member of the Soviet Communist Party, he's been an EU commissioner for the
[2:03:47.240 --> 2:03:49.760]  last five years.
[2:03:49.760 --> 2:04:01.360]  So, can you start over something, cut out your phone line, go back to the communist commissars
[2:04:01.360 --> 2:04:03.480]  now in the EU?
[2:04:03.480 --> 2:04:09.120]  Yeah, of the 27 EU commissioners that we have now, and these are the people with the real
[2:04:09.120 --> 2:04:12.840]  power in Europe, they're not elected, they're appointed, but these are the people who have
[2:04:12.840 --> 2:04:18.040]  the sole right to propose legislation that is effective in all our countries, six of
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:24.280]  those were directly for the Soviet Communist regime before the war came down.
[2:04:24.280 --> 2:04:29.680]  And that isn't going to improve particularly because we've got Mr. von Rompuy, who's going
[2:04:29.680 --> 2:04:34.880]  to take over as the European president, but the new foreign minister that's taking over
[2:04:34.880 --> 2:04:42.360]  is a lady called Baroness Ashton from Britain, and from 1980 to 82, she was the treasurer
[2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:47.920]  of the campaign for nuclear disarmament in Britain, a campaign that wanted us to unilaterally
[2:04:47.920 --> 2:04:53.560]  disarm and an organization that was directly in receipt of funds from the Communist Party
[2:04:53.560 --> 2:04:54.560]  of Great Britain.
[2:04:54.560 --> 2:04:55.560]  Stay there.
[2:04:55.560 --> 2:04:58.080]  Stay there Nigel Farage, a member of parliament.
[2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:03.080]  We have that clip of where you confront them coming up and we'll go right back to you.
[2:05:58.080 --> 2:06:07.720]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:06:07.720 --> 2:06:10.880]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:06:10.880 --> 2:06:15.200]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[2:06:15.200 --> 2:06:16.200]  at home.
[2:06:16.200 --> 2:06:21.360]  I've turned an innocent influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[2:06:21.360 --> 2:06:22.360]  shots.
[2:06:22.360 --> 2:06:27.320]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:06:27.320 --> 2:06:32.640]  The fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[2:06:32.640 --> 2:06:37.320]  held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:06:37.320 --> 2:06:41.680]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[2:06:41.680 --> 2:06:43.720]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[2:06:43.720 --> 2:06:49.720]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington D.C., we have seen a fall
[2:06:49.720 --> 2:06:51.040]  of the republic.
[2:06:51.040 --> 2:06:57.600]  Get your copy of fall of the republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now

[2:07:00.760 --> 2:07:05.880]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:07:05.880 --> 2:07:10.240]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[2:07:10.240 --> 2:07:11.240]  do you want?
[2:07:11.240 --> 2:07:13.240]  My answer would be all I can get.
[2:07:13.240 --> 2:07:18.260]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[2:07:18.260 --> 2:07:19.480]  How much do you want?
[2:07:19.480 --> 2:07:20.480]  When do you want it?
[2:07:20.480 --> 2:07:22.560]  Now or after the battle starts?
[2:07:22.560 --> 2:07:23.680]  When will you need it?
[2:07:23.680 --> 2:07:25.800]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:07:25.800 --> 2:07:27.160]  Will there be any food?
[2:07:27.160 --> 2:07:28.620]  Will it make your children sick?
[2:07:28.620 --> 2:07:32.760]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[2:07:32.760 --> 2:07:33.920]  and be immunized?
[2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:37.720]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:07:37.720 --> 2:07:41.280]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:07:41.280 --> 2:07:42.520]  How much will you need?
[2:07:42.520 --> 2:07:43.520]  We don't know.
[2:07:43.520 --> 2:07:44.520]  How much do you want?
[2:07:44.520 --> 2:07:45.520]  All you can get.
[2:07:45.520 --> 2:07:46.520]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:07:46.520 --> 2:07:49.800]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[2:07:49.800 --> 2:07:56.560]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:07:56.560 --> 2:08:01.720]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[2:08:01.720 --> 2:08:04.400]  This morning, I thought this was going to be a big proud moment.
[2:08:04.400 --> 2:08:10.760]  I mean, it's taken you eight and a half years of bullying, of lying, of ignoring democratic
[2:08:10.760 --> 2:08:11.760]  referendums.
[2:08:11.760 --> 2:08:16.560]  Eight and a half years it's taken you to get this treaty through and on the 1st of December,
[2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:17.560]  you will have it.
[2:08:17.560 --> 2:08:22.360]  And of course, the architect of all of this, Jessica, wanted from this constitutional
[2:08:22.360 --> 2:08:26.880]  treaty for the European Union to have a big global voice.
[2:08:26.880 --> 2:08:31.000]  But I'm afraid the leaders have suffered from a collective loss of nerve.
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:35.200]  They've decided that they want their faces to be up on the global stage, not somebody
[2:08:35.200 --> 2:08:41.220]  from the European Union, and so we've got appointed a couple of political pygmies.
[2:08:41.220 --> 2:08:46.440]  The Kissinger question of who to call in Europe hasn't really been answered, has it?
[2:08:46.440 --> 2:08:51.040]  I guess the answer can only be Mr. Barroso, because he's the only one that anybody in
[2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:55.000]  the world has ever heard of, and is probably the big winner.
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:09:00.640]  Out of these posts, no wonder, sir, you look so happy this morning.
[2:09:00.640 --> 2:09:04.360]  And we have a new president of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy.
[2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:07.560]  Doesn't exactly trip off the tongue, does it?
[2:09:07.560 --> 2:09:12.400]  I can't see him stopping the traffic in Beijing or Washington.
[2:09:12.400 --> 2:09:18.320]  I doubt anybody in Brussels would even recognize who he is, and yet he's going to be paid
[2:09:18.320 --> 2:09:23.720]  a salary that is bigger than Obama's, which tells you all you need to know about this
[2:09:23.720 --> 2:09:26.800]  European political class and how they look after themselves.
[2:09:26.800 --> 2:09:33.560]  But at least he's an elected politician, unlike Baroness Cathy Ashton, who really is
[2:09:33.560 --> 2:09:37.320]  the true representation of the modern-day political class.
[2:09:37.320 --> 2:09:39.480]  In some way, she's ideal, isn't she?
[2:09:39.480 --> 2:09:44.120]  She's never had a proper job, and she's never been elected to anything in her life.
[2:09:44.120 --> 2:09:46.840]  So I guess she's perfect for this European Union.
[2:09:46.840 --> 2:09:48.480]  Excuse me, Mr. Farage.
[2:09:48.480 --> 2:09:51.960]  I would like to put down your postages.
[2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:55.400]  You made your presentation is enough for us.
[2:09:55.400 --> 2:09:56.400]  Calm down, Chaps.
[2:09:56.400 --> 2:09:57.400]  Okay.
[2:09:57.400 --> 2:09:58.400]  Please continue.
[2:09:58.400 --> 2:09:59.400]  Calm down.
[2:09:59.400 --> 2:10:03.040]  But I mean, she's never been elected to anything, and no one knows who she is.
[2:10:03.040 --> 2:10:07.880]  Even the Prime Minister was talking about Baroness Ashton as opposed to Ashton.
[2:10:07.880 --> 2:10:10.680]  I mean, no one has ever heard of her.
[2:10:10.680 --> 2:10:13.480]  She's even less well-known than Herman Van Rompuy.
[2:10:13.480 --> 2:10:16.640]  I mean, that takes some doing, doesn't it?
[2:10:16.640 --> 2:10:18.160]  She's risen without trace.
[2:10:18.160 --> 2:10:20.880]  She's part of this post-democratic age.
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:22.280]  She married well.
[2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:27.480]  She married an adviser and a friend and supporter of Tony Blair and got put in the House of
[2:10:27.480 --> 2:10:28.480]  Lords.
[2:10:28.480 --> 2:10:33.240]  When she was in the House of Lords, she was given one big job, and the job was to get the
[2:10:33.240 --> 2:10:40.600]  Lisbon Treaty through the House of Lords and to do so, pretending that it was entirely
[2:10:40.600 --> 2:10:43.000]  different to the EU constitution.
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:45.520]  So she's good at keeping a straight face.
[2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:50.080]  And she vigorously crushed any attempt in the House of Lords for the British people
[2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:51.080]  to elect her.
[2:10:51.080 --> 2:10:52.080]  There you go.
[2:10:52.080 --> 2:10:55.920]  He's about five feet from her, telling her to her face, then the current head, the sitting
[2:10:55.920 --> 2:11:01.360]  chair of the EU shuts him down, tells him to shut up, and then turns his mic off and
[2:11:01.360 --> 2:11:09.360]  cuts to the head of the Poland delegation to call him a bare-butted monkey.
[2:11:09.360 --> 2:11:12.280]  And then they tell him, you're not allowed to call names, which he's not doing.
[2:11:12.280 --> 2:11:13.960]  He's exposing their fraud.
[2:11:13.960 --> 2:11:16.560]  But then we're allowed to call you names.
[2:11:16.560 --> 2:11:22.680]  European Union Member of Parliament from the UK or UEP, Nigel Farage, is our guest.
[2:11:22.680 --> 2:11:24.400]  Thank you so much for being on with us, sir.
[2:11:24.400 --> 2:11:28.280]  Tell us about that little exchange, because it continues on for some time.
[2:11:28.280 --> 2:11:34.680]  What's up on the UK Independence Party website, UKIP.org, if folks want to see the full 30
[2:11:34.680 --> 2:11:35.680]  minutes of it?
[2:11:35.680 --> 2:11:36.680]  It's a classic exchange.
[2:11:36.680 --> 2:11:44.240]  I mean, okay, you know, my tone may be somewhat cutting or biting or sarcastic, but I didn't
[2:11:44.240 --> 2:11:51.200]  say anything that wasn't 100% true, and I didn't use language that was abusive or wrong
[2:11:51.200 --> 2:11:52.200]  or foul.
[2:11:52.200 --> 2:11:58.320]  I merely pointed out that Mr. von Rompuy was a bureaucrat, and that Baroness Ashton had
[2:11:58.320 --> 2:12:03.760]  had these very worrying links, in my opinion, with the campaign for nuclear disarmament,
[2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:06.240]  which was being funded by the Soviets.
[2:12:06.240 --> 2:12:10.480]  And for that, I was told by the President of the European Parliament that what I'd
[2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:16.320]  said was unacceptable, but it simply wasn't right that I should behave in this way.
[2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:20.800]  And whilst I was speaking, I was being cheered and barracked for abuse.
[2:12:20.800 --> 2:12:22.480]  I mean, that always happens now.
[2:12:22.480 --> 2:12:23.480]  Every time I get up to speak.
[2:12:23.480 --> 2:12:26.080]  Yeah, we can hear lots of chanting, but we can't make it out.
[2:12:26.080 --> 2:12:28.080]  I mean, were they just hissing and cussing or?
[2:12:28.080 --> 2:12:32.040]  Yeah, they shout and they scream and all the rest of it, but I mean, I guess all that
[2:12:32.040 --> 2:12:36.280]  you, you know, what you really get from the microphone is me, but no, they're always very
[2:12:36.280 --> 2:12:38.160]  abusive towards me.
[2:12:38.160 --> 2:12:41.280]  But it's perfectly okay for them to say that I'm mentally ill.
[2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:44.520]  It's perfectly okay for them to call me a monkey.
[2:12:44.520 --> 2:12:50.280]  It's fine for them to say that if people support Mr. Farage, it will open the door to fascism.
[2:12:50.280 --> 2:12:57.360]  I mean, they can, you know, there is no term of abuse that these people will not sink to,
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:01.800]  to battle against those of us that are arguing for democracy and are arguing for people to
[2:13:01.800 --> 2:13:04.600]  have their own voice and to say what they want to say.
[2:13:04.600 --> 2:13:10.480]  And in fact, after that, after that exchange, I was, I was called up to meet the President
[2:13:10.480 --> 2:13:15.240]  of the Parliament at five o'clock that night and it reminded me of being in trouble at
[2:13:15.240 --> 2:13:20.200]  school and having to go and see the headmaster, you know, and you wait outside the study and
[2:13:20.200 --> 2:13:27.840]  I went in and I said, look, I said, there's nothing I said or did here that could be deemed
[2:13:27.840 --> 2:13:32.920]  to be unparliamentary or wrong in any way at all was there, Mr. President.
[2:13:32.920 --> 2:13:39.200]  And he said, well, you called them pigmits and I had trouble not laughing or wetting
[2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:40.200]  myself.
[2:13:40.200 --> 2:13:44.080]  I said, but surely, you know, to call people pigmits, I mean, I said, they're not exactly
[2:13:44.080 --> 2:13:50.440]  giants, are they? I said, in future, I'll call them lilliputians if that makes you happy.
[2:13:50.440 --> 2:13:55.040]  You know, when it came to it, there was nothing they could say, I am not abusive, I am not
[2:13:55.040 --> 2:13:58.920]  foul mouth, I am not rude, and I'm a hundred percent factual.
[2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:03.240]  And it reminds me, Alex, of a time five years ago, when I revealed to the Parliament that
[2:14:03.240 --> 2:14:09.320]  the French Commissioner had in fact been convicted of embezzlement in the year 2000.
[2:14:09.320 --> 2:14:14.400]  And I revealed this to the Parliament, well, it was like a hand grenade had gone off.
[2:14:14.400 --> 2:14:20.960]  They all stood up and they abused me and point of order after point of order was made.
[2:14:20.960 --> 2:14:26.480]  The Parliament was told, wasn't it terrible that Mr. Farage would behave like this?
[2:14:26.480 --> 2:14:31.000]  Somebody else said I'd behave like a football hooligan, which I took real exception to.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:37.040]  I was told by the then president of the Parliament that I should withdraw my statement so that
[2:14:37.040 --> 2:14:43.760]  it could be expunged from the record or face the full legal ramifications of what I'd just
[2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:49.520]  done. And of course, nothing happened because it was entirely true. The bloke had been convicted
[2:14:49.520 --> 2:14:55.000]  of embezzlement. But this is what you're up against here. Continually, they throw the
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:58.200]  abuse at us and we fight back with that.
[2:14:58.200 --> 2:15:04.560]  European Union Member of Parliament from the UK, Nigel Farage is our guest. I want to skip
[2:15:04.560 --> 2:15:09.840]  ahead in the 30 minutes that this went on to just one of the people on Mike, where he's
[2:15:09.840 --> 2:15:14.320]  telling you you're not allowed to criticize them, but then he doesn't tell her she's wrong
[2:15:14.320 --> 2:15:21.520]  for calling you a monkey, the taller you climb up the tree, the more your butt is exposed.
[2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:26.960]  Here is the clip from the, from the commissar from Poland. Here it is.
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:33.800]  Save their integrity, personal integrity. And Mr. Farage, I'd like to say something Hungarian
[2:15:33.800 --> 2:15:38.000]  quotation for you. It's good that you are here because if the monkey goes up to the
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:40.800]  tree, it's better seen how red is his popo.
[2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:52.240]  What can you say? They can call me what they like. I don't care. They can call me what
[2:15:52.240 --> 2:15:57.720]  they like. You know, if they think they're really helping their cause by just throwing
[2:15:57.720 --> 2:16:02.880]  continual abuse at me, they're wrong. They're doing it because they're frightened. And what
[2:16:02.880 --> 2:16:07.840]  they're frightened of is that the majority of people in Britain and France and Germany
[2:16:07.840 --> 2:16:12.680]  and right across Europe, the vast majority of them want to live in democratic nation
[2:16:12.680 --> 2:16:14.800]  states. They do not want this.
[2:16:14.800 --> 2:16:18.440]  Absolutely. I mean, the statement you're making, I mean, you're clearly in the right. All of
[2:16:18.440 --> 2:16:24.360]  us for liberty and sovereignty and true free republics, representative democracy, we're
[2:16:24.360 --> 2:16:28.560]  in the right. They're in the wrong. And for decades, when we would try to cover the plan
[2:16:28.560 --> 2:16:33.440]  for the European Union to go global, when we would read official UN documents calling
[2:16:33.440 --> 2:16:38.200]  for global government, global governance, the media would call us cooks and nuts trying
[2:16:38.200 --> 2:16:40.580]  to keep people from having a real debate.
[2:16:40.580 --> 2:16:44.960]  But now that their systems out in the open, it's actually backfired on them because hundreds
[2:16:44.960 --> 2:16:49.960]  of millions of people have learned about the new world order. We're told it didn't exist.
[2:16:49.960 --> 2:16:54.520]  Now they're admitting it exists, but saying it's good. And you talk about the fear in
[2:16:54.520 --> 2:16:58.880]  their eyes. I'm seeing that here. And they beg us. They go, please don't talk about how
[2:16:58.880 --> 2:17:02.600]  we're tyrants. Please don't talk about how we're undemocratic. Please don't talk about
[2:17:02.600 --> 2:17:07.200]  how we're robbing people and want socialism. Please, please, please, because people will
[2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:12.200]  think you're a cook. No, they're begging us not to stand up against them. Your comments
[2:17:12.200 --> 2:17:13.200]  on that.
[2:17:13.200 --> 2:17:19.040]  Well, we've got to stand up and fight. There's a fantastic quotation from a guy called Burke,
[2:17:19.040 --> 2:17:23.880]  who was an English philosopher. And he wrote, and again, it's 17th century stuff, but often
[2:17:23.880 --> 2:17:29.240]  these old principles remain good. And he wrote that all it takes for evil to prosper is for
[2:17:29.240 --> 2:17:33.600]  good men to do nothing. And I would put it to you, Alex, and I would put it to your audience,
[2:17:33.600 --> 2:17:37.080]  that what is actually happening in terms of democracy and sovereignty around the Western
[2:17:37.080 --> 2:17:42.760]  world is nothing short of evil. And it's our duty to stand up and fight for this.
[2:17:42.760 --> 2:17:48.800]  You know, those that went before us in previous generations, you know, they had to fight it
[2:17:48.800 --> 2:17:55.240]  out in muddy trenches in northern France, and in many cases give up their lives to have
[2:17:55.240 --> 2:18:00.840]  democracy, freedom, and self-respect. What we're being called upon to do is nothing like
[2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:05.160]  us at Erkham or as difficult as that, but we have to stand up and do it. And I'm pleased
[2:18:05.160 --> 2:18:09.040]  to say that increasingly on this side of the pond, people are beginning to do so.
[2:18:09.040 --> 2:18:13.360]  Well, I don't want to take away from World War II veterans and people, amazing folks,
[2:18:13.360 --> 2:18:20.400]  but I've read a lot of psychology perspective on this. And sometimes it's harder to morally
[2:18:20.400 --> 2:18:29.120]  stand up against a political system when the political system is advertising itself as
[2:18:29.120 --> 2:18:35.240]  the only orthodoxy. Sometimes moral courage is harder than when you know people are shooting
[2:18:35.240 --> 2:18:39.360]  at you and everybody's on your side, on your side, and they're on their side and you're
[2:18:39.360 --> 2:18:44.480]  fighting. That's a lot cleaner and more focused. And you know what you're dealing with, dealing
[2:18:44.480 --> 2:18:49.160]  with the duplicity of, you know, as you said, this German member of the EU said, look, we'll
[2:18:49.160 --> 2:18:55.080]  just beat you 50 underhanded ways. You know, I mean, it's the fact that it's a covert operation
[2:18:55.080 --> 2:19:00.280]  that we're countering. And so what can people do in the UK, because you talked about your
[2:19:00.280 --> 2:19:06.280]  party just exploding, how do folks get behind the UK Independence Party, how do people from
[2:19:06.280 --> 2:19:12.000]  your own perspective become leaders against the New World Order, against this global group
[2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:18.240]  of tyrants who are networked on a planetary scale? From your experience, what can people
[2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:22.400]  do in Texas, and in England, and in Germany, and all over the world?
[2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:26.560]  Well, at the end of the day, however much our democracies have been devalued and they
[2:19:26.560 --> 2:19:31.680]  have, and however much our freedoms have been taken away from us, which they have, but still,
[2:19:31.680 --> 2:19:36.160]  at the end of the day, we do have a system where the people that have the power to commit
[2:19:36.160 --> 2:19:43.880]  these things have to be voted in by us, all right? So the ultimate power, short of rioting,
[2:19:43.880 --> 2:19:49.200]  you know, I hope you won't get to that, but the ultimate power that we have over the political
[2:19:49.200 --> 2:19:55.440]  class is the ability to get rid of them, is the ability for them to lose their positions.
[2:19:55.440 --> 2:20:00.680]  And you know, that's why, okay, it's taken time, these things don't happen overnight,
[2:20:00.680 --> 2:20:04.880]  and your point about moral courage being a difficult thing to show them, and I accept
[2:20:04.880 --> 2:20:09.680]  that, and that is a perfectly good point. But increasingly, what we're finding in England
[2:20:09.680 --> 2:20:14.760]  is that people are gaining the confidence and are feeling that they've got to speak
[2:20:14.760 --> 2:20:20.040]  out, not just because it's a moral duty, but also because, you know, anyone that's got
[2:20:20.040 --> 2:20:25.000]  children and grandchildren can surely see the lessons of history, and the lessons of history
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  are clear. If you force people, as we're doing in Europe, to live in a different state under
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:35.600]  a different form of government over which they have no effective control, that is a
[2:20:35.600 --> 2:20:41.560]  recipe in the future, not for peace, but for civil disorder, and possibly even for war.
[2:20:41.560 --> 2:20:47.360]  So we are beginning to see people showing the courage, breaking out of their normal tribal
[2:20:47.360 --> 2:20:53.560]  party political lines, and they'll come a point, they'll come a point where UKIP becomes
[2:20:53.560 --> 2:20:59.200]  so big that something will give in our political system. But it's having the willingness to
[2:20:59.200 --> 2:21:03.720]  take away from those politicians the one thing they need, which is your vote at election
[2:21:03.720 --> 2:21:04.720]  time.
[2:21:04.720 --> 2:21:10.120]  Well, that's a great point. And then obviously, every man and woman listening to your voice
[2:21:10.120 --> 2:21:15.520]  across the globe, we're on satellite, shortwave internet, AM and FM stations all over North
[2:21:15.520 --> 2:21:20.280]  America, needs to understand that none of us are going to save the world overnight. It's
[2:21:20.280 --> 2:21:26.880]  everybody doing a little bit to educate someone, to explain to them about the unelected tyranny
[2:21:26.880 --> 2:21:34.600]  of this global corporate system that's been set up, and to understand that, as you pointed
[2:21:34.600 --> 2:21:41.080]  out, Mr. Farage, that every generation has to face tyranny. And the tyranny we're facing
[2:21:41.080 --> 2:21:49.400]  is cloaked in respectability, cloaked in Madison Avenue, public relations propaganda,
[2:21:49.400 --> 2:21:55.080]  but is even more deadly than some of the past corruptions that we've dealt with, and that
[2:21:55.080 --> 2:21:57.680]  people had better get moving against this now.
[2:21:57.680 --> 2:22:05.000]  Yes, they've got to get mobilized. And your point is right, that really successful revolutions
[2:22:05.000 --> 2:22:12.640]  happen, and real momentum happens by many tens of thousands of little things happening.
[2:22:12.640 --> 2:22:17.240]  And it's people talking to each other at the golf club or in the local bar or wherever
[2:22:17.240 --> 2:22:22.920]  they go and meet people or over Sunday lunch with the family. It's lots of little conversations
[2:22:22.920 --> 2:22:28.920]  that develop momentum and make a real difference. I'm absolutely convinced of that. I'm also
[2:22:28.920 --> 2:22:35.920]  convinced that across the Western world, there has never been less confidence in our traditional
[2:22:35.920 --> 2:22:40.200]  career politicians. So I think the mood is right for it. And I think that people are
[2:22:40.200 --> 2:22:45.040]  beginning to realize that this stuff is now affecting them directly. I mean, look, whatever
[2:22:45.040 --> 2:22:50.520]  they sign up to in Copenhagen next week affects every man and woman in England and in the
[2:22:50.520 --> 2:22:55.320]  USA, because what they're going to do is they're going to tax us more and continue to export
[2:22:55.320 --> 2:23:01.000]  our jobs to India and places like that. So I think this stuff is beginning to hit home.
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:05.680]  I think it's why we're beginning to win the argument. But I mean, hey, there's no room
[2:23:05.680 --> 2:23:08.520]  for complacency. We've got a long, long way to go yet.
[2:23:08.520 --> 2:23:13.680]  Absolutely. They can't win unless we just sit down and shut up because they always create
[2:23:13.680 --> 2:23:19.000]  the crisis or use a crisis to get more power. The crisis gets worse than they use that to
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:25.600]  get more power. If we just point out that they are the main progenitors of our deindustrialization,
[2:23:25.600 --> 2:23:31.120]  the dependency, the welfare, the open borders, all the problems, there's no way they can
[2:23:31.120 --> 2:23:36.600]  stand if we just stand up like the little boy saying the emperor is wearing no clothes
[2:23:36.600 --> 2:23:40.800]  in closing in the last five, six minutes we have left. We were very appreciative in your
[2:23:40.800 --> 2:23:47.320]  busy schedule, sir, specifically with the Copenhagen greenhouse gas initiative. It looks
[2:23:47.320 --> 2:23:52.040]  like this agreement's falling through, but they will agree to meet again in Mexico City
[2:23:52.040 --> 2:23:58.960]  and Obama has said, I don't care if Senate won't ratify. I'm going to implement through
[2:23:58.960 --> 2:24:04.080]  the bureaucracy. Same thing. Gordon Brown and Tony Blair have done with EU expansion.
[2:24:04.080 --> 2:24:10.400]  How do you counter the lawlessness of the bureaucracies of the prime ministers of the
[2:24:10.400 --> 2:24:16.480]  presidents and their bureaucracies who don't care even when the the elected bodies do the
[2:24:16.480 --> 2:24:21.640]  right thing? I'm afraid I remember very well when Obama was elected and it was seen in
[2:24:21.640 --> 2:24:25.600]  England like the second coming of the Lord, you know, all the media wasn't it wonderful
[2:24:25.600 --> 2:24:31.440]  and I was on a big TV show and I was asked my opinion and I said I was very concerned
[2:24:31.440 --> 2:24:35.880]  about many of the things that Obama stood for and I was somewhat vilified at the time
[2:24:35.880 --> 2:24:43.280]  for that, but I think Obama's response to Copenhagen, I think Obama's attitude towards
[2:24:43.280 --> 2:24:51.120]  your own parliamentary bodies is quite extraordinary and I think this marks Obama out to be frankly
[2:24:51.120 --> 2:24:57.040]  and I don't come on the show to offend Americans, but I honestly think that Obama is a very
[2:24:57.040 --> 2:25:04.920]  dangerous man who doesn't really truly believe in democracy and I would have thought that
[2:25:04.920 --> 2:25:10.080]  if this is how he's going to behave as American president, then it is your duty as Americans
[2:25:10.080 --> 2:25:14.920]  if you believe in democracy and if you believe as I believe in the principle that you know
[2:25:14.920 --> 2:25:19.400]  no parliament may bind its successor and that the job of parliaments is to hold the executive
[2:25:19.400 --> 2:25:23.560]  in your case, the president to account, then you've got a jolly wall make sure that he
[2:25:23.560 --> 2:25:28.080]  doesn't get reelected for a second term. It's just as simple as that.
[2:25:28.080 --> 2:25:32.040]  Absolutely. In the three and a half minutes we've got left sir. I just want to encourage
[2:25:32.040 --> 2:25:39.480]  people to go to UKIP.org, UKindependenceparty.org and learn a lot more and certainly set up
[2:25:39.480 --> 2:25:44.720]  our own sovereignty groups outside of the Republicans because just as Mr. Farage talks
[2:25:44.720 --> 2:25:49.560]  about both the big parties, Labor and Tories being controlled over in England, our two
[2:25:49.560 --> 2:25:54.360]  parties are controlled. Obviously things are moving quicker right now under Obama than
[2:25:54.360 --> 2:26:00.640]  they would have under a Republican administration, but regardless it's Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
[2:26:00.640 --> 2:26:05.400]  Everybody needs to mobilize as Lord Monkton's talked about a worldwide freedom party in
[2:26:05.400 --> 2:26:10.320]  every nation saying we want sovereignty, we want free market, we don't want to be run
[2:26:10.320 --> 2:26:15.360]  by a bunch of bureaucrats. In closing sir, any other points you'd like to make, any
[2:26:15.360 --> 2:26:20.520]  other information you'd like to relay about EU expansion, one question I had, I saw press
[2:26:20.520 --> 2:26:27.200]  reports about multiple nations are threatening to pull out of the EU, so the EU is collapsing
[2:26:27.200 --> 2:26:31.600]  even as it tyrannically expands its labenstrah.
[2:26:31.600 --> 2:26:35.960]  Yeah, I mean just at the very point where they get their constitutional treaty through,
[2:26:35.960 --> 2:26:39.240]  where they get their president, where they get their foreign minister, where they get
[2:26:39.240 --> 2:26:44.080]  total power over the member states, even at this very point it's becoming clear that the
[2:26:44.080 --> 2:26:48.520]  electorates of the member states don't want it, it's becoming clear that countries like
[2:26:48.520 --> 2:26:53.160]  Greece and Ireland, which mistakenly joined the monetary system and took the euro as their
[2:26:53.160 --> 2:26:58.400]  currency now find themselves in an impossible position with nothing to do. And I would just
[2:26:58.400 --> 2:27:05.000]  say this, you know if you look through history there is no example of any free people willingly
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:09.640]  giving up the right to govern itself and yet what has happened to us in England is we have
[2:27:09.640 --> 2:27:16.000]  been betrayed by Labour and Conservative politicians successively over the last 40 years to the
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:22.160]  point where our parliament has become nothing more than a charade and I will go on fighting
[2:27:22.160 --> 2:27:27.120]  and I will go on standing up because I believe that the best people to govern Britain are
[2:27:27.120 --> 2:27:31.840]  the British people themselves and I want my four kids to grow up in a country that they
[2:27:31.840 --> 2:27:37.080]  can call their own and I believe this is a great historic battle and we are going to
[2:27:37.080 --> 2:27:39.080]  win this battle.
[2:27:39.080 --> 2:27:43.360]  Well sir, obviously you're all over radio and TV in the UK, you don't need much of
[2:27:43.360 --> 2:27:48.680]  our help but we do have a large internet audience and satellite audience in the UK, specifically
[2:27:48.680 --> 2:27:53.560]  there's a lot of folks probably never got involved in politics but they're now, how
[2:27:53.560 --> 2:27:57.400]  can people help you get elected to the UK Parliament?
[2:27:57.400 --> 2:28:03.840]  They want to help me in any way they can, go to UKIP.org, go to our website, register
[2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:08.440]  with us and say to yourself, say to yourself that you're going to give a little bit, just
[2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:13.080]  a little bit of your time and money to fight to get the independence, the sovereignty,
[2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:18.000]  the self-respect and pride of the United Kingdom back. As I said earlier, the sacrifice I'm
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:22.640]  asking you to make is of nothing compared with that your grandfathers and great grandfathers
[2:28:22.640 --> 2:28:26.840]  had to make in two world wars. We're doing this because it's right, we're doing this
[2:28:26.840 --> 2:28:31.640]  because we've been led up the garden path and totally betrayed by our politicians. This
[2:28:31.640 --> 2:28:35.560]  is the fight back, it's real, it's happening, get on board.
[2:28:35.560 --> 2:28:39.960]  Well it was Cicero who said that, to paraphrase, the enemy that comes to your gate openly
[2:28:39.960 --> 2:28:46.480]  with their banners is not the real threat, it's the traitor within who knows your language,
[2:28:46.480 --> 2:28:52.600]  who knows your customs and so again, whereas machine guns firing at our ancestors was what
[2:28:52.600 --> 2:28:57.960]  was a terrible thing and they were very noble to fight, it's this creeping death that's
[2:28:57.960 --> 2:29:02.920]  so hard to deal with, I think people should give a lot because if we allow this scientific
[2:29:02.920 --> 2:29:08.160]  dictatorship as the UN calls itself and many of its documents to continue to grow and put
[2:29:08.160 --> 2:29:13.240]  its police state grid in, they know people are going to revolt and resist, they're racing
[2:29:13.240 --> 2:29:19.200]  to get their system in place to oppress the people and thanks to leaders like yourself,
[2:29:19.200 --> 2:29:25.560]  Nigel Farage, the UK member of the EU parliament, we have a fighting chance because we know
[2:29:25.560 --> 2:29:31.040]  you there in airstrip one are on the front lines against Europe who is setting up this
[2:29:31.040 --> 2:29:36.720]  planetary world government, this dictatorship, so again UKIP.org, let me say bye to you during
[2:29:36.720 --> 2:29:40.440]  the break, we'll let you go sir, but thank you very much for spending time with us.
[2:29:40.440 --> 2:29:42.080]  Thank you, not at all, not at all.

[2:32:02.280 --> 2:32:06.920]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:32:06.920 --> 2:32:11.280]  Number 1, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:32:11.280 --> 2:32:15.920]  Number 2, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[2:32:15.920 --> 2:32:16.920]  you to have.
[2:32:16.920 --> 2:32:21.540]  That's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[2:32:21.540 --> 2:32:22.640]  is coming.
[2:32:22.640 --> 2:32:26.960]  Number 3, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[2:32:26.960 --> 2:32:30.960]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:32:30.960 --> 2:32:34.440]  Number 4, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:32:34.440 --> 2:32:38.160]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[2:32:38.160 --> 2:32:42.920]  Number 5, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:32:42.920 --> 2:32:46.680]  Folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:32:46.680 --> 2:32:48.080]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[2:32:48.080 --> 2:32:55.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com, remember the government
[2:32:55.000 --> 2:33:20.840]  doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[2:33:20.840 --> 2:33:29.440]  I know we have John Cynthia, Roger, John and others, 1-800-259-9231, oh and I forgot to
[2:33:29.440 --> 2:33:36.400]  add Alan Watt of cutting through the matrix is going to be joining us in the next hour.
[2:33:36.400 --> 2:33:40.280]  We're going to set him up for a full 2 hours early in the new year.
[2:33:40.280 --> 2:33:46.120]  I'm a little tripped out right now to use the 80's term.
[2:33:46.120 --> 2:33:53.080]  I'm tripping as the guys would say over a big national TV host says they're coming,
[2:33:53.080 --> 2:33:58.120]  I talked to them yesterday, talked to their producer, coming here to interview me face
[2:33:58.120 --> 2:33:59.120]  to face.
[2:33:59.120 --> 2:34:04.720]  We're having a lot of globalists come through the office lately and they have finally recognized
[2:34:04.720 --> 2:34:13.640]  that I am creeping through Mordor with the ring towards, well through Sirith Ungle and
[2:34:13.640 --> 2:34:18.920]  towards Mount Doom itself.
[2:34:18.920 --> 2:34:24.440]  I've always enjoyed, I've never really liked being on national TV or never liked really
[2:34:24.440 --> 2:34:25.440]  having them figure it out.
[2:34:25.440 --> 2:34:30.880]  I mean, I know their operatives already know it, their assessors know it, but we're actually
[2:34:30.880 --> 2:34:35.280]  getting the attention of all the old men and the old globalists now, they're like, I want
[2:34:35.280 --> 2:34:45.960]  you to go find that boy's Achilles heel and destroy him, but it doesn't work anymore.
[2:34:45.960 --> 2:34:51.400]  When the national media attacks me, no matter how bad it is, people know the media is a
[2:34:51.400 --> 2:34:58.920]  bunch of lying corrupt thugs and so it'll be good, but they can't help it.
[2:34:58.920 --> 2:35:02.400]  They don't understand, they're like shooting a gun at me that's empty.
[2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:09.160]  They're like, die, die, die, pulling the trigger and it's not working.
[2:35:09.160 --> 2:35:15.200]  I'm going, you're out of bullets there.
[2:35:15.200 --> 2:35:19.320]  I'd be scared of the national media coming out and saying I was good.
[2:35:19.320 --> 2:35:22.920]  If they were really smart, that's how they defeat me.
[2:35:22.920 --> 2:35:28.600]  They would just come out and say, oh, Alex Jones is good, oh yes, and then try to co-opt
[2:35:28.600 --> 2:35:29.600]  the message.
[2:35:29.600 --> 2:35:30.600]  They're smart.
[2:35:30.600 --> 2:35:31.600]  They're doing that with Glenn Beck.
[2:35:31.600 --> 2:35:36.480]  They're a clown who for most people comes off as disingenuous and sneaky and like some
[2:35:36.480 --> 2:35:37.480]  kind of pervert.
[2:35:37.480 --> 2:35:41.520]  I mean, I mean, if I look at Glenn Beck, that's what he comes off as like, if I had a neighbor
[2:35:41.520 --> 2:35:45.480]  like that, I'd tell my kids, hey, when you're playing in people's front yards, if he's in
[2:35:45.480 --> 2:35:49.520]  the garage working on his car, don't, don't, don't go, that's creepy.
[2:35:49.520 --> 2:35:50.520]  That neighbor's creepy.
[2:35:50.520 --> 2:35:51.920]  I don't want, well, why daddy?
[2:35:51.920 --> 2:35:52.920]  He just looks creepy.
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:35:59.160]  If he's offering you soda pop, you know, I'm sorry, I'm not saying Glenn Beck's like that.
[2:35:59.160 --> 2:36:09.440]  I just, he comes off as, well, I mean, he's always like on a show, he's like always trying
[2:36:09.440 --> 2:36:14.240]  to act non-threatening and sweet and he's the teacher he's going to show you.
[2:36:14.240 --> 2:36:17.840]  And I'm like, ladies and gentlemen, look out for that guy.
[2:36:17.840 --> 2:36:18.840]  That's all.
[2:36:18.840 --> 2:36:19.840]  I mean, where is your discernment?
[2:36:19.840 --> 2:36:20.840]  All right.
[2:36:20.840 --> 2:36:29.000]  I'm, I'm now digressing and I have all this news to cover, but see, they don't know how
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:31.520]  to deal with me because I got all my problems.
[2:36:31.520 --> 2:36:33.200]  I'm not perfect.
[2:36:33.200 --> 2:36:38.600]  I'm a little bit hickish, a little bit hillbilly-ish, all that, but I'm real and they don't know
[2:36:38.600 --> 2:36:40.480]  how to deal with that.
[2:36:40.480 --> 2:36:42.320]  They don't know how to deal with somebody.
[2:36:42.320 --> 2:36:49.360]  They can't buy off who doesn't really have any skeletons in my closet.
[2:36:49.360 --> 2:36:53.480]  What I eat too much and like beer, don't even do that anymore.
[2:36:53.480 --> 2:36:58.360]  I mean, there's really nothing and they may manufacture stuff, but I'm not worried.
[2:36:58.360 --> 2:37:03.040]  I'll be like, use it, say whatever you want about me, I'll use the attention to exposure
[2:37:03.040 --> 2:37:04.040]  a bunch of frauds.
[2:37:04.040 --> 2:37:06.280]  I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm so committed.
[2:37:06.280 --> 2:37:10.960]  All they can do is plant drugs on me or kill me and that's not going to work either because
[2:37:10.960 --> 2:37:15.640]  then everybody will go, my gosh, it is for real.
[2:37:15.640 --> 2:37:19.600]  And the other good news about all this is, is that we've reached so many people in the
[2:37:19.600 --> 2:37:26.840]  system that a lot of police, a lot of military, a lot of FBI people, a lot of federal marshals,
[2:37:26.840 --> 2:37:28.680]  they know we're telling the truth.
[2:37:28.680 --> 2:37:32.640]  They heard us talk 10, 15, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, they laughed at us.
[2:37:32.640 --> 2:37:37.600]  Now they've seen it all come true and they're going, okay, okay, I'm listening because they're
[2:37:37.600 --> 2:37:38.600]  not criminals.
[2:37:38.600 --> 2:37:39.600]  They're like the general public.
[2:37:39.600 --> 2:37:45.120]  They were kind of mesmerized or eased into corruption incrementally.
[2:37:45.120 --> 2:37:49.920]  And now that the corruption is really clear, it's honorable.
[2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:54.120]  Now that it's finally clear, they're going, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, as long as you turn
[2:37:54.120 --> 2:37:57.200]  back and don't consciously be part of evil.
[2:37:57.200 --> 2:38:00.800]  If you did some stuff that was bad in the past, but didn't know you were being bad,
[2:38:00.800 --> 2:38:02.440]  it's not bad.
[2:38:02.440 --> 2:38:05.120]  All of us have done stuff that was wrong.
[2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:10.240]  I mean, I was like a devil or something when I was 18, 19, 20 years old, man.
[2:38:10.240 --> 2:38:11.800]  I mean, I liked to get in fights.
[2:38:11.800 --> 2:38:14.920]  I like people to start fights and I could beat them up.
[2:38:14.920 --> 2:38:19.040]  You know, I mean, I did all sorts of, I mean, I wasn't classically wouldn't think of it
[2:38:19.040 --> 2:38:20.040]  as bad.
[2:38:20.040 --> 2:38:22.960]  I think of it as bad today.
[2:38:22.960 --> 2:38:28.800]  I mean, you know, I, I liked women quite a bit.
[2:38:28.800 --> 2:38:34.440]  I mean, you know, that's why I can't sit here and be a hypocrite about other people.
[2:38:34.440 --> 2:38:37.520]  I mean, Rush Limbaugh, it's caught taking painkillers.
[2:38:37.520 --> 2:38:39.760]  He really did have back surgery.
[2:38:39.760 --> 2:38:41.920]  That stuff's highly addictive.
[2:38:41.920 --> 2:38:46.880]  The medical system knew when they were prescribing synthetic heroin to people that 90 plus percent
[2:38:46.880 --> 2:38:48.960]  of people that took it were going to get addicted.
[2:38:48.960 --> 2:38:53.680]  I don't judge Rush Limbaugh because he got addicted to drugs, but I do judging because
[2:38:53.680 --> 2:38:59.440]  he says put people who were caught with cocaine or heroin in prison, the first offense for
[2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:01.960]  10 years.
[2:39:01.960 --> 2:39:04.840]  The whole time he was bombed out of his brain.
[2:39:04.840 --> 2:39:08.600]  I've talked to people who worked with him in radio, huge pot smoker.
[2:39:08.600 --> 2:39:09.800]  I mean, he sits up there.
[2:39:09.800 --> 2:39:10.800]  He likes to drink.
[2:39:10.800 --> 2:39:11.800]  He likes marijuana.
[2:39:11.800 --> 2:39:12.800]  He likes pills.
[2:39:12.800 --> 2:39:16.760]  And then none of that's good Limbaugh, but I'm not up here judging you.
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:18.640]  I never had problems with marijuana.
[2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:23.520]  I never had problems with pills like you, but I could imagine how that could happen.
[2:39:23.520 --> 2:39:27.600]  I don't sit up here on my high horse going, look at Rush Limbaugh.
[2:39:27.600 --> 2:39:31.600]  He got caught taking a hundred oxy cottons a day, a hundred.
[2:39:31.600 --> 2:39:33.240]  That would kill like eight horses.
[2:39:33.240 --> 2:39:38.440]  He had such a tolerance from eating so many of them over the last decade.
[2:39:38.440 --> 2:39:43.840]  My problem with Rush Limbaugh is that he still gets up there and says, throw the key away
[2:39:43.840 --> 2:39:46.480]  with people that are caught with illegal drugs.
[2:39:46.480 --> 2:39:51.440]  You're taking an over the counter drug, a prescription drug, but from behind the prescription
[2:39:51.440 --> 2:39:58.720]  counter that you got from a pharmacy that is the molecule is even more addictive than
[2:39:58.720 --> 2:40:02.760]  heroin.
[2:40:02.760 --> 2:40:07.760]  And you want to throw a heroin or crack head in jail, but you don't want to go to jail.
[2:40:07.760 --> 2:40:16.440]  See I'm sick of hypocrisy and see I've never been a hypocrite about anything I've done.
[2:40:16.440 --> 2:40:19.320]  And I sit here and think about how they're going to come at me, angles they might, and
[2:40:19.320 --> 2:40:20.320]  you know what?
[2:40:20.320 --> 2:40:21.320]  They're going to build strong men.
[2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:25.280]  They're going to make stuff up because that's what they've always done with Cointel Pro.
[2:40:25.280 --> 2:40:30.960]  There's nothing they can do to me short of setting me up or killing me, nothing.
[2:40:30.960 --> 2:40:38.960]  There is nothing they can do, nothing.
[2:40:38.960 --> 2:40:45.100]  Any way they cut it, any angle they go at me, it blows up in their face.
[2:40:45.100 --> 2:40:46.360]  So they're going to make stuff up.
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:50.520]  That's the only angle they've got, and they've made so much stuff up about everybody else
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:54.920]  that no one even believes it.
[2:40:54.920 --> 2:40:58.520]  That's what's great about all the Cointel Pro lies about me.
[2:40:58.520 --> 2:41:05.520]  One crazier than the last, always more insane, always based in lies.
[2:41:05.520 --> 2:41:09.080]  Anyway, enough about Alex Jones.
[2:41:09.080 --> 2:41:12.720]  It's just to get this phone call, they've been calling me for weeks, finally got a hold
[2:41:12.720 --> 2:41:17.680]  of us, and they'll be talking to a huge national television host who wants to come down here
[2:41:17.680 --> 2:41:22.400]  into a profile on me, and they have newspapers in here every other day, big magazines.
[2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:31.200]  I mean, they finally are paying attention, and I'm having some gallows humor here.
[2:41:31.200 --> 2:41:34.480]  I mean, this is what I've asked for.
[2:41:34.480 --> 2:41:36.240]  I wanted to change the world.
[2:41:36.240 --> 2:41:41.520]  You've helped me do it together with listeners, and now here we are.
[2:41:41.520 --> 2:41:46.840]  We're really going to the next level.
[2:41:46.840 --> 2:41:50.000]  I asked for it, so I'm ready.
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  I'm ready.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:55.760]  It's kind of like a few times when I was growing up, and I'd see some big bully beating up
[2:41:55.760 --> 2:42:01.800]  some little kid, and the guy'd be twice my size, and I'd walk up and say, buddy, you
[2:42:01.800 --> 2:42:06.160]  better stop doing that, and I knew what I was in for when I did that.
[2:42:06.160 --> 2:42:09.640]  I knew this guy was going to turn around, start pounding on me, but I would just go
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:13.400]  past the fear, step in, punch him under, cut him the nose, their whole nose would just
[2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:17.400]  tear off with blood spraying out everywhere, or maybe they got me down.
[2:42:17.400 --> 2:42:18.680]  Maybe they started pounding my head in.
[2:42:18.680 --> 2:42:23.000]  You just got to get a good old boy gut up and roll him over and just start gouging their
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:24.120]  eyes out.
[2:42:24.120 --> 2:42:27.240]  You got to do what it takes, and it's the same thing politically.
[2:42:27.240 --> 2:42:30.360]  I came up with a new world order, and I slapped him upside the head, and I said, why don't
[2:42:30.360 --> 2:42:33.480]  you stop picking on all those kids you see PS and you kidnap?
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:35.920]  Why don't you stop all that corruption you're doing?
[2:42:35.920 --> 2:42:39.600]  They turned around to me, this little bitty guy, and you know what?
[2:42:39.600 --> 2:42:41.720]  They smashed me flat in the pancake.
[2:42:41.720 --> 2:42:47.280]  The blood that comes out of me, the blood of patriots and tyrants, will only make the
[2:42:47.280 --> 2:42:48.400]  tree of liberty grow.
[2:42:48.400 --> 2:42:50.760]  I just win any way you cut it.
[2:42:50.760 --> 2:42:54.600]  The only way to really win in life is to do the right thing, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:42:54.600 --> 2:42:58.720]  The only way to truly win in life is to do the right thing.
[2:42:58.720 --> 2:43:00.280]  You're not going to be fulfilled.
[2:43:00.280 --> 2:43:01.840]  You're not going to be happy.
[2:43:01.840 --> 2:43:05.920]  Your life is not going to be one-tenth as good as it could be until you start fighting
[2:43:05.920 --> 2:43:06.920]  corruption.
[2:43:06.920 --> 2:43:13.440]  I mean, the stupid Young Turks show, millions of viewers a week on YouTube where they play
[2:43:13.440 --> 2:43:19.440]  the part of the middle of the road, laughing, joking newscast, did an attack piece on me
[2:43:19.440 --> 2:43:22.720]  saying, what's Alex so upset about CPS?
[2:43:22.720 --> 2:43:23.720]  What is that?
[2:43:23.720 --> 2:43:25.320]  Why is he angry at the CPS?
[2:43:25.320 --> 2:43:26.320]  What is that?
[2:43:26.320 --> 2:43:31.680]  How could five-year newscasters, been around for five years, they have a show on XM Serious
[2:43:31.680 --> 2:43:32.680]  2?
[2:43:32.680 --> 2:43:35.440]  How could they not know what CPS is?
[2:43:35.440 --> 2:43:41.800]  How could they think I was a weirdo for getting angry knowing that over a million kids a year
[2:43:41.800 --> 2:43:48.560]  taken without due process by the Child Protective Services nationwide under a UN program and
[2:43:48.560 --> 2:43:53.520]  that the CPS is five times more likely in Europe at seven times to abuse children than
[2:43:53.520 --> 2:43:56.240]  any other group?
[2:43:56.240 --> 2:44:04.160]  I mean, do the Young Turks not know about CNN four years ago, 3,500 kids missing in Florida
[2:44:04.160 --> 2:44:07.600]  and they found a bunch of them dead that had been in CPS custody?
[2:44:07.600 --> 2:44:10.160]  They raped these kids and then kill them?
[2:44:10.160 --> 2:44:12.840]  You don't think raping and killing kids is a big deal?
[2:44:12.840 --> 2:44:15.120]  No, no, you do think it's a big deal.
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:20.880]  You just are so ignorant, you don't know what CPS is and you take a clip out of context
[2:44:20.880 --> 2:44:24.080]  of me getting angry about children being abused.
[2:44:24.080 --> 2:44:25.520]  What's wrong with you?
[2:44:25.520 --> 2:44:31.460]  What type of person doesn't get angry at children being raped by big fat government pedophiles?
[2:44:31.460 --> 2:44:35.880]  What type of person is so screwed up that they don't know this stuff's going on?
[2:44:35.880 --> 2:44:41.440]  What type of person doesn't get angry at that?
[2:44:41.440 --> 2:44:43.120]  What is your problem?
[2:44:43.120 --> 2:44:45.360]  You are the people that are screwed up.
[2:44:45.360 --> 2:44:49.040]  You are the people that don't get upset by tyranny.
[2:44:49.040 --> 2:44:53.280]  You don't get upset by Bush having secret arrest teams that snatch and grab and torture
[2:44:53.280 --> 2:44:58.600]  people and then now they're putting them on trial after 5, 6, 7, 8 years of torture, depending
[2:44:58.600 --> 2:44:59.680]  on the case.
[2:44:59.680 --> 2:45:02.680]  That doesn't freak you out.
[2:45:02.680 --> 2:45:07.840]  Having tyrannical government doesn't scare you.
[2:45:07.840 --> 2:45:13.440]  The only real monsters in this world, folks, outside a man are things like great white
[2:45:13.440 --> 2:45:15.040]  sharks and grizzly bears.
[2:45:15.040 --> 2:45:18.280]  And what do they kill, 10, 15, 20 people a year?
[2:45:18.280 --> 2:45:19.280]  But you're scared of them.
[2:45:19.280 --> 2:45:23.600]  When you're out in the woods in Colorado, you're walking around you thinking, man, there's
[2:45:23.600 --> 2:45:27.040]  grizzly bears around here.
[2:45:27.040 --> 2:45:31.040]  Full grown men are scared of grizzly bears because you're supposed to be.
[2:45:31.040 --> 2:45:37.120]  But you're not scared of criminal big government that killed 200 million people in the 20th
[2:45:37.120 --> 2:45:40.560]  century conservatively, the number one cause of unnatural death.
[2:45:40.560 --> 2:45:49.000]  And you tell me I'm a weirdo because my instincts are tuned up and I know how dangerous big
[2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:53.480]  government is and I know it's taken over and I know what it does.
[2:45:53.480 --> 2:45:58.720]  And I'm here screaming, telling my fellow homo sapiens, sapiens, I'm like a chimpanzee
[2:45:58.720 --> 2:46:04.160]  in a tree jumping up and down, warning other chimpanzees when I see a big cat coming through
[2:46:04.160 --> 2:46:05.400]  the woods.
[2:46:05.400 --> 2:46:11.040]  I'm like a bird that sees a cat coming up to eat some of the other birds and I flap my
[2:46:11.040 --> 2:46:12.120]  wings and fly off.
[2:46:12.120 --> 2:46:23.360]  I'm the weirdo because I'm sitting in the tree going, I mean, don't you understand anthropology,
[2:46:23.360 --> 2:46:24.360]  sociology?
[2:46:24.360 --> 2:46:27.880]  Don't you understand that I'm up here going, my God, they're building FEMA camps, they're
[2:46:27.880 --> 2:46:31.320]  brainwashing the public, they're training your kids to spy on you, they're launching
[2:46:31.320 --> 2:46:35.240]  all these wars, they admit they torture people's kids in front of them to get answers.
[2:46:35.240 --> 2:46:41.320]  The police nationwide are using paying compliance, torture to get answers out of people.
[2:46:41.320 --> 2:46:43.280]  All courts of rule, they can do it.
[2:46:43.280 --> 2:46:48.360]  See, I'm a homo sapiens sapiens, so I sit here with words warning you.
[2:46:48.360 --> 2:46:53.680]  A chimpanzee can't talk, so they just go, you understand that?
[2:46:53.680 --> 2:46:56.800]  See I'm normal, you're not normal.
[2:46:56.800 --> 2:47:00.520]  I'm out at a boat dock somewhere and I see a family swimming around by boat docks and
[2:47:00.520 --> 2:47:02.160]  I see a water moccasin.
[2:47:02.160 --> 2:47:04.440]  I go, hey, watch out, there's a snake over here.
[2:47:04.440 --> 2:47:07.440]  Am I the weirdo or are you the weirdo?
[2:47:07.440 --> 2:47:12.240]  Everybody that thinks the world's all this funny, happy football and Christmas shopping
[2:47:12.240 --> 2:47:17.240]  and everything's cute and everybody acts trendy because the television through the social
[2:47:17.240 --> 2:47:22.640]  art typing tells you the cool guy's stupid and doesn't care and makes jokes and everything
[2:47:22.640 --> 2:47:27.240]  and you imprint on that like a baby duck.
[2:47:27.240 --> 2:47:31.720]  I didn't imprint on television and the fake image of a stupid male.
[2:47:31.720 --> 2:47:37.360]  They teach everybody, be stupid, be vapid, be shallow, don't be decisive.
[2:47:37.360 --> 2:47:42.240]  Don't take action, don't rally people, don't get upset.
[2:47:42.240 --> 2:47:49.400]  That's what human beings do, that's what men do, you fools, you castrated cowards.
[2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:55.000]  But you've been so domesticated, so castrated from birth, set in front of the TV set to
[2:47:55.000 --> 2:48:00.400]  rot in your crap filled diapers that when you see somebody, trying to be a man, trying,
[2:48:00.400 --> 2:48:05.000]  doesn't mean I got all the answers, doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:10.840]  Trying to be a man, trying to be a warrior for humanity, you get shocked by that.
[2:48:10.840 --> 2:48:16.840]  You should look in the mirror and be shocked by what you are.
[2:48:16.840 --> 2:48:24.160]  I'm done talking to you scum and you are your scum and we're all once scum in our lives
[2:48:24.160 --> 2:48:27.400]  till we get woken up and take action.
[2:48:27.400 --> 2:48:32.160]  I was once dumb as dirt, you don't have to be dumb as dirt, you don't have to think
[2:48:32.160 --> 2:48:38.960]  tyranny's cute and funny.
[2:48:38.960 --> 2:48:41.720]  I'm going to come back Jim if you calls in the now and what's coming up and we'll go
[2:48:41.720 --> 2:48:43.320]  over all the news with him.
[2:48:43.320 --> 2:48:48.000]  Yeah, I shouldn't get upset about the Arabs announcing they're fully dumping the dollar.
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:51.040]  Oh, you'll be upset when your standard of living falls, jackass.
[2:48:51.040 --> 2:48:55.200]  See, I get upset about real things.
[2:48:55.200 --> 2:49:01.360]  I don't care if the cowboys lose, I do care about the dollar dying.
[2:49:01.360 --> 2:49:04.800]  Who's head screwed on straight, mine or yours?
[2:49:04.800 --> 2:49:09.800]  I want to tell you about a sponsor, Eat Foods Direct.

[2:52:04.960 --> 2:52:08.680]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:52:08.680 --> 2:52:11.840]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:52:11.840 --> 2:52:16.200]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[2:52:16.200 --> 2:52:17.200]  at home.
[2:52:17.200 --> 2:52:22.360]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the
[2:52:22.360 --> 2:52:23.360]  shots.
[2:52:23.360 --> 2:52:28.240]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:52:28.240 --> 2:52:31.480]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[2:52:31.480 --> 2:52:37.320]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[2:52:37.320 --> 2:52:38.320]  world government.
[2:52:38.320 --> 2:53:06.800]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[2:53:06.800 --> 2:53:10.720]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[2:53:10.720 --> 2:53:15.480]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride, at less than 2 cents per
[2:53:15.480 --> 2:53:16.480]  gallon.
[2:53:16.480 --> 2:53:21.440]  Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine fluoride
[2:53:21.440 --> 2:53:23.520]  and contaminants from municipal water.
[2:53:23.520 --> 2:53:27.840]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for
[2:53:27.840 --> 2:53:29.640]  rainwater collection systems.
[2:53:29.640 --> 2:53:34.480]  From the smallest to the largest systems, bigberkeywaterfilters.com has what you need.

[2:54:10.200 --> 2:54:11.700]  Alan Watts coming up.
[2:54:11.700 --> 2:54:13.200]  Let's talk to Paul in Texas.
[2:54:13.200 --> 2:54:14.200]  Thanks for holding Paul.
[2:54:14.200 --> 2:54:15.200]  Hey, Alex.
[2:54:15.200 --> 2:54:16.200]  Hey, buddy.
[2:54:16.200 --> 2:54:23.520]  Hey, I'm Debra Medina's coordinator here in Austin in Travis County.
[2:54:23.520 --> 2:54:26.840]  And man, I've been trying to get home to Chuck North.
[2:54:26.840 --> 2:54:32.040]  And I was just wondering if you knew if he had any plans on endorsing or if he's talked
[2:54:32.040 --> 2:54:36.320]  about anybody in the governor's race, and if not, man, how can we get him on board with
[2:54:36.320 --> 2:54:37.320]  Debra?
[2:54:37.320 --> 2:54:38.320]  It seems like it's a little tricky.
[2:54:38.320 --> 2:54:39.320]  Well, Paul, I appreciate your call.
[2:54:39.320 --> 2:54:40.320]  You know, we've had Debra in.
[2:54:40.320 --> 2:54:41.320]  We like her for governor.
[2:54:41.320 --> 2:54:42.320]  And we've supported her.
[2:54:42.320 --> 2:54:46.160]  And I've gotten calls at home from people saying, you know, get Chuck Norris on the phone
[2:54:46.160 --> 2:54:47.160]  with her.
[2:54:47.160 --> 2:54:49.600]  It's not like I just call Chuck Norris up and say, hey, Chuck, get over here and do
[2:54:49.600 --> 2:54:50.600]  this.
[2:54:50.600 --> 2:54:54.000]  I mean, I can do that with like Charlie Sheen and a few other people I know really well.
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:57.840]  But Chuck's been a listener for more than a decade.
[2:54:57.840 --> 2:54:59.480]  He likes the show.
[2:54:59.480 --> 2:55:01.120]  He knows a lot more than he's letting on.
[2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:03.680]  He's starting to show people how much he knows.
[2:55:03.680 --> 2:55:07.160]  But maybe a few years down the road, I can call myself good buddies with Chuck Norris.
[2:55:07.160 --> 2:55:10.960]  But you know, these people all like me because I don't bug them.
[2:55:10.960 --> 2:55:12.160]  I don't bug celebrities.
[2:55:12.160 --> 2:55:13.320]  I don't ask them for stuff.
[2:55:13.320 --> 2:55:18.720]  I don't hassle them.
[2:55:18.720 --> 2:55:20.320]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in New York.
[2:55:20.320 --> 2:55:21.320]  John, you're on the air.
[2:55:21.320 --> 2:55:22.320]  Welcome.
[2:55:22.320 --> 2:55:23.320]  How you doing there, Alex?
[2:55:23.320 --> 2:55:24.320]  Hey, buddy.
[2:55:24.320 --> 2:55:30.400]  Yeah, this is John here with We Are Change, Hamburg, New York, a new chapter in the fight
[2:55:30.400 --> 2:55:31.400]  against tyranny.
[2:55:31.400 --> 2:55:32.400]  Well done.
[2:55:32.400 --> 2:55:35.840]  That kind of thing.
[2:55:35.840 --> 2:55:37.520]  Just wanted to bring a point to you.
[2:55:37.520 --> 2:55:41.480]  You know, let you know that we just started up here in Western New York.
[2:55:41.480 --> 2:55:46.680]  Today I went to Ms. Nancy, I was the doctor's man.
[2:55:46.680 --> 2:55:51.400]  It's, you know, the doctor there that came up with a good slogan, just get your damn
[2:55:51.400 --> 2:55:52.400]  shot.
[2:55:52.400 --> 2:55:53.400]  Yes.
[2:55:53.400 --> 2:55:54.400]  Yes.
[2:55:54.400 --> 2:55:55.400]  Yeah.
[2:55:55.400 --> 2:55:59.600]  Well, we went to her blog today and we posted a paper that we released on Facebook not long
[2:55:59.600 --> 2:56:02.320]  ago called The Pandemic Hopes.
[2:56:02.320 --> 2:56:06.760]  Essentially, what it is, is it's a paper that pretty much looks at the statistics as they're
[2:56:06.760 --> 2:56:08.760]  posted to today's date.
[2:56:08.760 --> 2:56:09.760]  Yeah.
[2:56:09.760 --> 2:56:14.440]  This flu is killing about 20% of what the regular flu does this far into the year.
[2:56:14.440 --> 2:56:20.000]  There's now indictments coming down in Europe of EU members, UN members, where the scientists
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:21.840]  are all making money off the hype.
[2:56:21.840 --> 2:56:24.880]  It is a pack of criminals, but it doesn't stop there.
[2:56:24.880 --> 2:56:28.280]  They're adding chemicals to the vaccines.
[2:56:28.280 --> 2:56:30.040]  Appreciate the call, John.
[2:56:30.040 --> 2:56:31.400]  It's worse than that.
[2:56:31.400 --> 2:56:36.400]  You're paying them to get Alzheimer's and cancer and to be sterilized.
[2:56:36.400 --> 2:56:38.320]  Cynthia in New Jersey.
[2:56:38.320 --> 2:56:39.320]  Go ahead.
[2:56:39.320 --> 2:56:40.320]  Oh, hi.
[2:56:40.320 --> 2:56:41.320]  It's a privilege.
[2:56:41.320 --> 2:56:47.600]  I wanted to tell you that I called Time Magazine today because of Ben Bernanke being named Man
[2:56:47.600 --> 2:56:49.000]  of the Year.
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:54.280]  Nobody there wants to talk to me, but I did leave several messages.
[2:56:54.280 --> 2:57:00.840]  I just felt that I wanted them to know that we know that they gave the prize to the man
[2:57:00.840 --> 2:57:04.920]  who caused this whole economic collapse.
[2:57:04.920 --> 2:57:10.280]  Well, let's say one of the top lieutenants of Summers in Rubin and others that set it
[2:57:10.280 --> 2:57:12.800]  up under Clinton and worked it under Bush.
[2:57:12.800 --> 2:57:15.240]  Yes, one of the king criminals.
[2:57:15.240 --> 2:57:20.520]  It's like giving Adolf Hitler an award for fighting Nazis.
[2:57:20.520 --> 2:57:24.400]  But I just wanted them to know that that we know and they're not fooling anyone.
[2:57:24.400 --> 2:57:25.400]  Good.
[2:57:25.400 --> 2:57:28.600]  I mean, don't subscribe to them.
[2:57:28.600 --> 2:57:33.160]  You know, I mean, literally, literally, I mean, I'm just saying Time Magazine is a joke.
[2:57:33.160 --> 2:57:34.620]  Newsweek is even worse.
[2:57:34.620 --> 2:57:38.560]  Every issue I see talks about how great killing old people is.
[2:57:38.560 --> 2:57:41.360]  I mean, it's like a Twilight Zone episode.
[2:57:41.360 --> 2:57:44.680]  Since when did just everything turn to psycho land?
[2:57:44.680 --> 2:57:46.440]  Everything is upside down.
[2:57:46.440 --> 2:57:50.240]  You know, Obama gets the Nobel Prize for warmongering.
[2:57:50.240 --> 2:57:59.920]  So also, to the other caller, the woman who's the child and here in here in Austin and we
[2:57:59.920 --> 2:58:03.080]  confirmed it, we pulled it up.
[2:58:03.080 --> 2:58:08.040]  The corporations have to give the schools money to make the kids write dossiers on their
[2:58:08.040 --> 2:58:09.040]  parents.
[2:58:09.040 --> 2:58:10.040]  Go ahead.
[2:58:10.040 --> 2:58:11.040]  Yes.
[2:58:11.040 --> 2:58:17.200]  My son's 26, but when he was 18 and he had his last checkup with the pediatrician, my
[2:58:17.200 --> 2:58:21.480]  husband called and said, do not give him the hepatitis vaccination.
[2:58:21.480 --> 2:58:23.200]  And they tried to get it to him.
[2:58:23.200 --> 2:58:26.920]  He went in there by himself because he was 18 years old and I waited for him in the waiting
[2:58:26.920 --> 2:58:33.000]  room and I couldn't believe that they tried to give him the vaccination when my husband
[2:58:33.000 --> 2:58:35.280]  had called ahead and said, do not get him that back.
[2:58:35.280 --> 2:58:36.280]  There's a bounty.
[2:58:36.280 --> 2:58:37.280]  Absolutely.
[2:58:37.280 --> 2:58:38.800]  There's a bounty on getting that soft kill weapon in there.
[2:58:38.800 --> 2:58:41.560]  Of course, the doctor doesn't care, he just wants to go to the golf course and have sex
[2:58:41.560 --> 2:58:44.840]  with his mistress.
[2:58:44.840 --> 2:58:47.960]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:47.960 --> 2:58:53.520]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:53.520 --> 2:58:56.520]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:58:56.520 --> 2:59:00.880]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[2:59:00.880 --> 2:59:01.880]  do you want?
[2:59:01.880 --> 2:59:07.400]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[2:59:07.400 --> 2:59:08.880]  Food is your only ammunition.
[2:59:08.880 --> 2:59:10.120]  How much do you want?
[2:59:10.120 --> 2:59:11.120]  When do you want it?
[2:59:11.120 --> 2:59:13.160]  Now or after the battle starts?
[2:59:13.160 --> 2:59:14.280]  When will you need it?
[2:59:14.280 --> 2:59:16.400]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:59:16.400 --> 2:59:17.720]  Will there be any food?
[2:59:17.720 --> 2:59:19.200]  Will it make your children sick?
[2:59:19.200 --> 2:59:23.320]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[2:59:23.320 --> 2:59:24.480]  and be immunized?
[2:59:24.480 --> 2:59:28.280]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:59:28.280 --> 2:59:31.840]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:59:31.840 --> 2:59:33.080]  How much will you need?
[2:59:33.080 --> 2:59:34.080]  We don't know.
[2:59:34.080 --> 2:59:35.080]  How much do you want?
[2:59:35.080 --> 2:59:36.080]  All you can get.
[2:59:36.080 --> 2:59:37.080]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:59:37.080 --> 2:59:40.120]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[2:59:40.120 --> 2:59:47.600]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:59:47.600 --> 2:59:55.920]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[2:59:55.920 --> 2:59:58.160]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:59:58.160 --> 3:00:12.440]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:12.440 --> 3:00:15.840]  We're going to continue with John, Jeremy, Andy, John, many others.
[3:00:15.840 --> 3:00:18.840]  The toll-free number for China is 1-800-259-9231.
[3:00:18.840 --> 3:00:22.840]  This is an abbreviated only one-hour interview with Alan.
[3:00:22.840 --> 3:00:25.960]  That's normally a full interview, but Alan's got so much to say and I've got so much to
[3:00:25.960 --> 3:00:26.960]  add.
[3:00:26.960 --> 3:00:29.840]  We're getting back on for a couple hours early in January.
[3:00:29.840 --> 3:00:33.880]  In fact, let's make sure we set that up with him in his calendar before he leaves us.
[3:00:33.880 --> 3:00:39.200]  He is a big part of Fall of the Republic, the presidency of Barack H. Obama, detailing
[3:00:39.200 --> 3:00:43.320]  the global government banking slash carbon tax takeover.
[3:00:43.320 --> 3:00:45.440]  This film couldn't have come out at a better time.
[3:00:45.440 --> 3:00:48.280]  It is exploding like no film I've ever produced.
[3:00:48.280 --> 3:00:54.240]  You can get a free Obama as the Joker t-shirt or a free Don't Tread on Me t-shirt with it
[3:00:54.240 --> 3:00:58.040]  at infowars.com until Christmas.

[3:01:15.360 --> 3:01:21.200]  Going to Alan Watt of Cuttingthemedritch.com, first off, I haven't talked to you since we
[3:01:21.200 --> 3:01:25.160]  got you a copy of it when the guys came to interview you a few months ago in Canada.
[3:01:25.160 --> 3:01:28.720]  What's your take on Fall of the Republic, Alan?
[3:01:28.720 --> 3:01:30.240]  It's having a great impact.
[3:01:30.240 --> 3:01:36.840]  It's all over the planet now and I get emails from so many people saying I've seen it and
[3:01:36.840 --> 3:01:41.920]  it's really, it's hitting them between the eyes, some of them, which is a darn good thing
[3:01:41.920 --> 3:01:47.000]  because with no time to lose here and catching up, we're going to be shocked into reality
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:49.160]  and I think it helps to do that.
[3:01:49.160 --> 3:01:50.560]  What do you think of the film yourself?
[3:01:50.560 --> 3:01:52.160]  I mean, I want your honest review.
[3:01:52.160 --> 3:01:53.560]  Oh, it's well done.
[3:01:53.560 --> 3:01:54.560]  It's well done.
[3:01:54.560 --> 3:02:00.640]  I mean, even the camera guys when they were here doing the take, they knew their stuff
[3:02:00.640 --> 3:02:01.640]  as well.
[3:02:01.640 --> 3:02:06.440]  Everything was well on and I don't know who did the editing and so on, but it's a good
[3:02:06.440 --> 3:02:13.120]  job of patching all the different pieces together to make it flow and the topics flowing so
[3:02:13.120 --> 3:02:17.360]  that people who didn't know too much could get an understanding and take them right through
[3:02:17.360 --> 3:02:23.080]  it in a condensed form and that's what we have to do today because we cannot give a
[3:02:23.080 --> 3:02:30.480]  complete lifetime's education to people in a fast move except by condensing it for them
[3:02:30.480 --> 3:02:34.800]  and giving them important parts and really stressing how it's done and where it is going
[3:02:34.800 --> 3:02:37.280]  if they don't participate in their own future.
[3:02:37.280 --> 3:02:40.960]  Yeah, I mean, we're showing people here's the globalist agenda.
[3:02:40.960 --> 3:02:43.400]  Here's their own documents, here's their own statements.
[3:02:43.400 --> 3:02:45.800]  Do you want this for yourself and your future?
[3:02:45.800 --> 3:02:50.280]  Do you want to be a slave who was eventually euthanized?
[3:02:50.280 --> 3:02:51.880]  The decision is up to you.
[3:02:51.880 --> 3:02:57.280]  One of the few criticisms I've gotten for Follow the Republic is, well, I already knew
[3:02:57.280 --> 3:03:01.240]  a lot of this or this has a lot of basics in it.
[3:03:01.240 --> 3:03:06.880]  Yes, that's the whole point of the Obama deception in Follow the Republic is to be slickly done,
[3:03:06.880 --> 3:03:12.000]  well produced, highest level graphics and it has a lot of new information as well.
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:17.920]  But yes, it gives people the basics because we're trying to reach people who have no idea
[3:03:17.920 --> 3:03:20.080]  of what's going on.
[3:03:20.080 --> 3:03:24.920]  And plus when you get people together who know, with people who don't know, rather than
[3:03:24.920 --> 3:03:30.800]  just go over stuff through books and weekly meetings, if you've all shared the same video
[3:03:30.800 --> 3:03:35.320]  and then discussed it yourself and chipped and it's a good way to catch up quickly to
[3:03:35.320 --> 3:03:39.560]  speak as to what's happening, you could have something in common and something you've
[3:03:39.560 --> 3:03:43.800]  all either seen or read in common and that's how it's done today.
[3:03:43.800 --> 3:03:48.760]  We don't have time to give a history of the last hundred or years, we don't have time.
[3:03:48.760 --> 3:03:54.040]  So you have to condense it to put an important part so that the beginners can understand
[3:03:54.040 --> 3:03:58.240]  and bring them up to speak so they can then converse with you with the knowledge that
[3:03:58.240 --> 3:03:59.240]  you're sharing.
[3:03:59.240 --> 3:04:04.120]  And then once they have a basic blueprint of just part of the system, it's too complex
[3:04:04.120 --> 3:04:05.120]  to give somebody the full view.
[3:04:05.120 --> 3:04:08.800]  I mean, I'm still learning every day, it's so big and complex and they've had so many
[3:04:08.800 --> 3:04:13.760]  specials working for so long on different parts of this matrix system, but once people
[3:04:13.760 --> 3:04:19.840]  have a basic snapshot, a basic crash course in brain surgery, then they can start picking
[3:04:19.840 --> 3:04:26.640]  up the other rabbit trails and larger gestalts for themselves as their palate develops.
[3:04:26.640 --> 3:04:32.280]  That's correct, you understand that we're up against organization.
[3:04:32.280 --> 3:04:36.440]  Organization has been working steadily for well over a hundred years with non-governmental
[3:04:36.440 --> 3:04:43.800]  organizations who are trained in a school-type format, gradually updated with their vision
[3:04:43.800 --> 3:04:44.800]  of the future.
[3:04:44.800 --> 3:04:50.160]  As I say, they're organized, they're funded, and some of them are full-time employees
[3:04:50.160 --> 3:04:54.720]  in fact to get salaries from the big foundations and pension funds.
[3:04:54.720 --> 3:04:57.320]  That's what we're up against, massive organization.
[3:04:57.320 --> 3:05:01.840]  We have to do it with what we have and we have to do it very quickly.
[3:05:01.840 --> 3:05:07.520]  Your illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[3:05:07.520 --> 3:05:08.520]  you to eat.
[3:05:08.520 --> 3:05:12.000]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:14.960]  sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[3:05:14.960 --> 3:05:17.840]  You don't have to cooperate, there is a solution.
[3:05:17.840 --> 3:05:21.480]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[3:05:21.480 --> 3:05:26.280]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[3:05:38.920 --> 3:05:39.920]  manager.
[3:05:39.920 --> 3:05:44.640]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee, infused with herbal extracts to boost your
[3:05:44.640 --> 3:05:45.840]  immune system.

[3:07:02.520 --> 3:07:07.160]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[3:07:07.160 --> 3:07:11.480]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:07:11.480 --> 3:07:15.800]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:07:15.800 --> 3:07:17.120]  allows you to have.
[3:07:17.120 --> 3:07:22.840]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:07:22.840 --> 3:07:27.200]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[3:07:27.200 --> 3:07:31.200]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[3:07:31.200 --> 3:07:34.680]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[3:07:34.680 --> 3:07:38.400]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[3:07:38.400 --> 3:07:43.120]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:07:43.120 --> 3:07:46.920]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:07:46.920 --> 3:07:48.300]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[3:07:48.300 --> 3:07:54.240]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[3:07:54.240 --> 3:08:02.040]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[3:08:08.040 --> 3:08:12.840]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[3:08:12.840 --> 3:08:14.240]  You want answers?
[3:08:14.240 --> 3:08:16.000]  Well, so does he.
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:20.200]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:20.200 --> 3:08:24.560]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:08:34.560 --> 3:08:40.480]  By the way, I was just now plugging fall in the republic, which really is my best film.
[3:08:40.480 --> 3:08:46.840]  Most produced, most information, most timely, highest quality, and Weldon Henson, the head
[3:08:46.840 --> 3:08:52.040]  of our shipping department, just explained to me, UPS can normally ship anywhere in
[3:08:52.040 --> 3:08:54.520]  the U.S. in four days.
[3:08:54.520 --> 3:09:01.240]  They say six working days out from Christmas, so tomorrow, orders that get in today and
[3:09:01.240 --> 3:09:08.720]  tomorrow are guaranteed by UPS anywhere in the United States before Christmas.
[3:09:08.720 --> 3:09:14.520]  Now, most places, it's two or three days, but that's how we ship UPS.
[3:09:14.520 --> 3:09:18.880]  If people want regular mail, you can always order that way too, but we found UPS is, I
[3:09:18.880 --> 3:09:21.520]  mean, the U.S. mail is really bad.
[3:09:21.520 --> 3:09:25.080]  I've seen a bunch of reports about mail offices just throw your mail away now.
[3:09:25.080 --> 3:09:26.440]  They just don't even care.
[3:09:26.440 --> 3:09:31.880]  Pension checks, toys, it's the government, and if you don't like it, a SWAT team will
[3:09:31.880 --> 3:09:32.880]  drop by.
[3:09:32.880 --> 3:09:35.960]  I mean, you know, they got the SWAT teams, they got your tax money, I don't want to
[3:09:35.960 --> 3:09:36.960]  bash the whole post office.
[3:09:36.960 --> 3:09:39.040]  There's some great people at the post office.
[3:09:39.040 --> 3:09:44.960]  The point is, if you want to order, follow the Republic and get a free end game, or if
[3:09:44.960 --> 3:09:50.000]  you want to order, follow the Republic and get a free reflections and warnings, come
[3:09:50.000 --> 3:09:52.000]  on in, Weldon.
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:53.000]  Weldon is now here.
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:09:56.240]  I was trying to get him down here earlier real fast.
[3:09:56.240 --> 3:10:00.760]  So if their order gets into day or tomorrow, you guys can get it out by the next day and
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:04.520]  then UPS guarantees it will get there before Christmas.
[3:10:04.520 --> 3:10:12.320]  If you place your order before eight o'clock tomorrow morning, you'll get it before Christmas
[3:10:12.320 --> 3:10:13.320]  guaranteed.
[3:10:13.320 --> 3:10:16.880]  Oh, so it's eight o'clock tomorrow morning because you guys want to get everything out
[3:10:16.880 --> 3:10:17.880]  tomorrow.
[3:10:17.880 --> 3:10:18.880]  Yes.
[3:10:18.880 --> 3:10:19.880]  Well, and everything will be out.
[3:10:19.880 --> 3:10:24.880]  If you order today, even it'll be out today, but we feel like we'll be able to do it tomorrow
[3:10:24.880 --> 3:10:25.880]  too.
[3:10:25.880 --> 3:10:29.720]  Now, well, we used to, we were a week or two behind on shipping until we got Weldon.
[3:10:29.720 --> 3:10:32.920]  Now we're shipping a lot of times on the day it comes in.
[3:10:32.920 --> 3:10:34.640]  We're up right now to day.
[3:10:34.640 --> 3:10:35.640]  Yeah.
[3:10:35.640 --> 3:10:38.360]  Anybody that places their order this morning is going out today.
[3:10:38.360 --> 3:10:40.000]  So, well, that's good.
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:48.280]  There's going to be a lot of little evil elves climbing down chimneys, bringing people DVDs.
[3:10:48.280 --> 3:10:50.960]  Are you guys wearing elf hats back there?
[3:10:50.960 --> 3:10:51.960]  Not yet.
[3:10:51.960 --> 3:10:52.960]  Well, I'll make them wear that.
[3:10:52.960 --> 3:10:54.600]  Hey, the public believes polar bears can't swim.
[3:10:54.600 --> 3:10:56.760]  Why not say elves exist?
[3:10:56.760 --> 3:10:57.760]  There you go.
[3:10:57.760 --> 3:10:59.260]  Why not?
[3:10:59.260 --> 3:11:00.760]  Maybe Al Gore Santa Claus.
[3:11:00.760 --> 3:11:03.560]  Oh, that'll be interesting to see.
[3:11:03.560 --> 3:11:04.840]  He's not going to like this.
[3:11:04.840 --> 3:11:05.840]  This present.
[3:11:05.840 --> 3:11:06.840]  Uh-uh.
[3:11:06.840 --> 3:11:07.840]  That's the one he won't like.
[3:11:07.840 --> 3:11:12.000]  Again, free t-shirts right now that you can pick from when you get Fall of the Republic.
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:13.640]  I just want people to have this.
[3:11:13.640 --> 3:11:14.640]  That's right.
[3:11:14.640 --> 3:11:16.160]  We'll get them to.
[3:11:16.160 --> 3:11:21.960]  Now, now a lot of UPS stuff shipping out even by this Friday, you'll still get to most
[3:11:21.960 --> 3:11:22.960]  people around the country.
[3:11:22.960 --> 3:11:23.960]  Right?
[3:11:23.960 --> 3:11:24.960]  Yeah.
[3:11:24.960 --> 3:11:25.960]  Yeah.
[3:11:25.960 --> 3:11:26.960]  Most people it will.
[3:11:26.960 --> 3:11:28.800]  Most locations, it takes, you know, three business days.
[3:11:28.800 --> 3:11:32.040]  We just set the deadline to make sure that it covered everybody.
[3:11:32.040 --> 3:11:38.040]  Uh, so, I mean, folks, even that order, majority of folks that order even on all day tomorrow
[3:11:38.040 --> 3:11:41.960]  or Friday morning, it'll still probably get it, but we just can't guarantee it.
[3:11:41.960 --> 3:11:45.680]  So guaranteed to get it if you order by eight o'clock tomorrow morning.
[3:11:45.680 --> 3:11:48.400]  Good chance you're still going to get it if you order by Friday.
[3:11:48.400 --> 3:11:49.400]  Good.
[3:11:49.400 --> 3:11:50.400]  We should have been plugging that all week.
[3:11:50.400 --> 3:11:53.480]  And of course you can always get a present planet dot TV membership and share it as a
[3:11:53.480 --> 3:11:54.480]  gift with others.
[3:11:54.480 --> 3:11:56.800]  Well, then thank you so much for coming in and talking to us.
[3:11:56.800 --> 3:11:57.800]  Good job there.
[3:11:57.800 --> 3:11:58.800]  Okay.
[3:11:58.800 --> 3:11:59.800]  I'm going to shut up now.
[3:11:59.800 --> 3:12:00.800]  I'll go back to Alan Watt.
[3:12:00.800 --> 3:12:04.280]  Alan Watt, enough with Christmas and fall of the Republic.
[3:12:04.280 --> 3:12:09.120]  We have total mind control being established in the country.
[3:12:09.120 --> 3:12:15.320]  We have all over the United States, Europe, the Western world, children on record writing
[3:12:15.320 --> 3:12:16.640]  reports on their parents.
[3:12:16.640 --> 3:12:23.160]  We confirmed that the Perdinallis power authority in Texas, Central Texas is making the kids
[3:12:23.160 --> 3:12:27.760]  fill out dossiers on their parents through the public schools, or they get a zero on
[3:12:27.760 --> 3:12:28.840]  their grade.
[3:12:28.840 --> 3:12:34.920]  I have a report here of where a boy drew an image of Jesus and was kicked out of school
[3:12:34.920 --> 3:12:39.640]  and is having a psychological assessment done in fact show prison planet dot TV viewers
[3:12:39.640 --> 3:12:40.640]  an image of this.
[3:12:40.640 --> 3:12:45.720]  I mean, we really are living in a secret police style tyranny.
[3:12:45.720 --> 3:12:50.080]  The Rand corporation is already announcing that all your local police departments are
[3:12:50.080 --> 3:12:57.880]  openly federalized, regular army garrisons will be stationed as domestic police as a
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:13:02.840]  rapid reaction force to take over local police departments.
[3:13:02.840 --> 3:13:06.120]  That's in this Rand corporation report.
[3:13:06.120 --> 3:13:07.120]  So much is going on.
[3:13:07.120 --> 3:13:13.400]  Go over that Alan Watt and then your take on what's happening at Copenhagen.
[3:13:13.400 --> 3:13:16.200]  Is their program really in deep trouble?
[3:13:16.200 --> 3:13:25.000]  Well, we find that the U.S. is the last country to be basically completely socialized as the
[3:13:25.000 --> 3:13:27.000]  socialist system.
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:31.680]  It's already completely through Europe, especially Britain, Britain is an incredible country
[3:13:31.680 --> 3:13:38.480]  right now where back in the 80s in fact they federalized, at least they put a chief police
[3:13:38.480 --> 3:13:43.880]  association in charge of all of the police across Britain and supposedly they were going
[3:13:43.880 --> 3:13:50.240]  to use martial law back in the 80s, Britain had to be sacrificed for first nuclear strikes
[3:13:50.240 --> 3:13:52.400]  in order for the U.S. to survive.
[3:13:52.400 --> 3:13:57.200]  So it's never got out of that mode, maybe easier for the federalized government to take
[3:13:57.200 --> 3:14:01.120]  over and this is a socialized system.
[3:14:01.120 --> 3:14:05.560]  I tell people so often don't get confused with fascism, communism, socialism.
[3:14:05.560 --> 3:14:11.080]  It's all the same thing, you see, and that's what's being used today.
[3:14:11.080 --> 3:14:16.240]  A long time ago it was decided by the big powers and economists and those who ruled
[3:14:16.240 --> 3:14:21.640]  the banking system of the world along with the politicians and the Fabian society that
[3:14:21.640 --> 3:14:26.320]  they'd have to bring in a socialist system and train the public, train them gradually
[3:14:26.320 --> 3:14:33.400]  to allow the experts at top to simply handle all the big problems while we were taught
[3:14:33.400 --> 3:14:34.400]  to play at the bottom.
[3:14:34.400 --> 3:14:39.880]  That's been very successful since mainly from the 60s onwards and so we're out of the
[3:14:39.880 --> 3:14:41.360]  loop, most of us were quite content.
[3:14:41.360 --> 3:14:46.960]  That's right, they made it a moral right, like it's cool that men and women don't care
[3:14:46.960 --> 3:14:47.960]  and aren't involved.
[3:14:47.960 --> 3:14:50.040]  It's uncool to be involved.
[3:14:50.040 --> 3:14:52.240]  It's fun to be an idiot.
[3:14:52.240 --> 3:14:55.720]  That's correct and while we're all being idiots and playing in this group, credit
[3:14:55.720 --> 3:15:02.000]  cards with everyone and they gave us a youth culture, a perpetual youth culture for anyone
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:05.440]  over a certain age is just non-existent.
[3:15:05.440 --> 3:15:11.440]  They didn't want older, wiser people coming into the game and teaching people what was
[3:15:11.440 --> 3:15:13.760]  really going on by their knowledge and history, etc.
[3:15:13.760 --> 3:15:15.240]  That's been very, very successful.
[3:15:15.240 --> 3:15:19.880]  You don't revere your elders, they're just people to be exterminated and now time and
[3:15:19.880 --> 3:15:24.680]  newsweek have articles about, let's just murder all the old people, it's so liberal.
[3:15:24.680 --> 3:15:29.920]  That's correct and that is coming down, they started off in Holland with euthanasia.
[3:15:29.920 --> 3:15:32.360]  Britain has just passed laws on it too.
[3:15:32.360 --> 3:15:39.000]  The U.S., I think, is their first main one this year in fact, earlier this year, openly.
[3:15:39.000 --> 3:15:40.000]  And so that's the agenda.
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:44.240]  This is all written again, going back to the days of H.G. Wells and the Utopians, the
[3:15:44.240 --> 3:15:50.160]  Fabians and also population control is a ramp up abortion and sterilization on one end,
[3:15:50.160 --> 3:15:55.760]  which is coming down by the way as part of the Copenhagen Treaty.
[3:15:55.760 --> 3:15:57.760]  Then the ramp up the other side too.
[3:15:57.760 --> 3:16:01.440]  Obama's all made him meet the communist statements and that's what it is folks, you're under
[3:16:01.440 --> 3:16:02.440]  that system right now.
[3:16:02.440 --> 3:16:05.560]  If you don't know it, look at all the people who are in it's staff right now, they're
[3:16:05.560 --> 3:16:11.920]  all, many of them are card-carring communists and they're true believers in the world Fabian
[3:16:11.920 --> 3:16:14.200]  system of socialism for experts.
[3:16:14.200 --> 3:16:19.640]  But just like the media told us communism didn't exist for 1991, they tell us no new
[3:16:19.640 --> 3:16:26.200]  world order exists even as they announce it, even as I was reading two weeks ago in a mercantile
[3:16:26.200 --> 3:16:30.760]  report that the number one shirts are hammer and sickle shirts.
[3:16:30.760 --> 3:16:31.760]  That's correct.
[3:16:31.760 --> 3:16:35.200]  A lot of the U.S. ph's are wearing them, I think it's all cool and trendy.
[3:16:35.200 --> 3:16:41.080]  I'm going to remember too that back in the 50's remember the re-commission authorized
[3:16:41.080 --> 3:16:47.440]  by the U.S. Congress and the Senate did investigations into the tax-free foundations, the big Rockefellas,
[3:16:47.440 --> 3:16:53.120]  Ford, Carnegie, all the other ones there, who are funding what appeared to be to them
[3:16:53.120 --> 3:16:59.840]  all the far left communist groups and Senator Norman Dodd and he's up on YouTube talking
[3:16:59.840 --> 3:17:00.840]  about this.
[3:17:00.840 --> 3:17:06.800]  It was astonished when he was told by the CEO of the Ford Foundation that their job
[3:17:06.800 --> 3:17:12.040]  of the foundation was to fund NGOs and so on, so it changed society and culture within
[3:17:12.040 --> 3:17:16.320]  the western world and especially America that it eventually blended seamlessly with
[3:17:16.320 --> 3:17:18.400]  that of the Soviet system.
[3:17:18.400 --> 3:17:19.880]  That has happened.
[3:17:19.880 --> 3:17:26.040]  That has happened and they're going now for the next step because in Marxian economics
[3:17:26.040 --> 3:17:30.200]  they must have everything centralized under world government, that's what the United Nations
[3:17:30.200 --> 3:17:34.960]  was established to become with the IMF there at the top, the World Bank and all the rest
[3:17:34.960 --> 3:17:35.960]  of it.
[3:17:35.960 --> 3:17:41.120]  Alan, to interrupt from your study, how does Russia tie in because Russia is paying people
[3:17:41.120 --> 3:17:46.120]  to have kids now because they've lost 45 million people thanks to the global agenda.
[3:17:46.120 --> 3:17:48.920]  They're talking about the New World Order on their television.
[3:17:48.920 --> 3:17:54.640]  I mean, is Russia going rogue from the New World Order or bidding for a better position
[3:17:54.640 --> 3:17:55.640]  in the New World Order?
[3:17:55.640 --> 3:18:00.520]  Yeah, a better position, but however too, you understand too, when the Bolshevik Revolution
[3:18:00.520 --> 3:18:07.360]  took over Russia, the Bolsheviks were comprised of non-Russians primarily who moved into the
[3:18:07.360 --> 3:18:13.360]  Soviet Union and they ran the entire Soviet Union through the Soviet era.
[3:18:13.360 --> 3:18:17.520]  It was mainly people from Brooklyn that came over and ran it and they got kicked out and
[3:18:17.520 --> 3:18:19.440]  then now they're the neocons, yeah.
[3:18:19.440 --> 3:18:24.160]  And that's correct as well and after the war came down and prior to it many of them moved
[3:18:24.160 --> 3:18:30.200]  out, many of them went to Israel, others moved into, a lot of them moved into California
[3:18:30.200 --> 3:18:36.960]  at Toronto and other places to continue the agenda of the merger over here.
[3:18:36.960 --> 3:18:42.680]  Now Gorbachev himself, who remember was the president of the Soviet Union, who was taken
[3:18:42.680 --> 3:18:47.840]  round the world on a world tour by Margaret Thatcher by her arm, arm and arm.
[3:18:47.840 --> 3:18:52.240]  And she introduced him to the world as a new type of communist.
[3:18:52.240 --> 3:18:57.440]  So they'd already chosen him to lead the Soviet Union as if it brought down the walls and
[3:18:57.440 --> 3:18:58.440]  we've got to go back to Lenin.
[3:18:58.440 --> 3:19:04.920]  Lenin said the dictatorship would last about 70 or 80 years and then it would emerge into
[3:19:04.920 --> 3:19:10.400]  the West where the new system would emerge not quite capitalist, not quite communist
[3:19:10.400 --> 3:19:16.600]  as the socialist, Fabian system worldwide, run by experts, eugenicists, all the guys
[3:19:16.600 --> 3:19:23.840]  on top, a planned society, a planned population and that's what's happening right now as we
[3:19:23.840 --> 3:19:24.840]  live.
[3:19:24.840 --> 3:19:31.760]  We're watching the people appointed on Obama's system, but we know who they all are.
[3:19:31.760 --> 3:19:37.360]  They've got tremendous histories of involvement in this communistic technique and the Fabian
[3:19:37.360 --> 3:19:38.360]  society holding it.
[3:19:38.360 --> 3:19:42.560]  And by the way, this is not Joseph McCarthy up here.
[3:19:42.560 --> 3:19:46.760]  This isn't Alex Jones or Alan Watt, Alan, because I've read all the same books.
[3:19:46.760 --> 3:19:55.640]  He's reading books written by Gorbachev, written by HG Wells, written by Leon Trotsky, written
[3:19:55.640 --> 3:19:58.720]  by Joseph Stalin, by Vladimir Lenin.
[3:19:58.720 --> 3:20:03.600]  We're telling you what they said and now their world government's here.
[3:20:03.600 --> 3:20:05.400]  You may be new to freeze dry foods.

[3:20:10.580 --> 3:20:12.360]  broke in the process.
[3:20:12.360 --> 3:20:13.720]  Welcome to the freeze dry guy.

[3:21:03.120 --> 3:21:07.320]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[3:21:07.320 --> 3:21:09.800]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[3:21:09.800 --> 3:21:14.920]  Unfortunately with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many
[3:21:14.920 --> 3:21:17.940]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[3:21:17.940 --> 3:21:22.240]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing
[3:21:22.240 --> 3:21:26.160]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[3:21:26.160 --> 3:21:29.920]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book The Creature
[3:21:29.920 --> 3:21:31.320]  from Jekyll Island.
[3:21:31.320 --> 3:21:35.320]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[3:21:35.320 --> 3:21:36.320]  power.
[3:21:36.320 --> 3:21:40.200]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[3:21:40.200 --> 3:21:41.720]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[3:21:41.720 --> 3:21:46.440]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[3:21:46.440 --> 3:21:51.280]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[3:21:51.280 --> 3:21:54.360]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[3:21:59.160 --> 3:22:04.080]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[3:22:04.080 --> 3:22:07.840]  Residents of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:22:07.840 --> 3:22:11.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:22:11.000 --> 3:22:15.360]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[3:22:15.360 --> 3:22:16.360]  at home.
[3:22:16.360 --> 3:22:21.000]  I have turned a tremendous influence on our President and Congress and they really are
[3:22:21.000 --> 3:22:22.000]  calling the shots.
[3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:27.360]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:22:27.360 --> 3:22:33.360]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel hell-bent
[3:22:33.360 --> 3:22:37.480]  on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:22:37.480 --> 3:22:41.800]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[3:22:41.800 --> 3:22:44.000]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:22:44.000 --> 3:22:49.840]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[3:22:49.840 --> 3:22:51.200]  of the Republic.

[3:23:02.240 --> 3:23:06.680]  When the electricity goes out, how will you boil water, cook dinner, light your home, or
[3:23:06.680 --> 3:23:08.000]  get news reports?
[3:23:08.000 --> 3:23:11.480]  Most families are not prepared for even the shortest power outages due to hurricanes,
[3:23:11.480 --> 3:23:13.240]  tornadoes, ice storms, and so on.
[3:23:13.240 --> 3:23:17.440]  But you can prepare your family for emergencies and not spend a lot doing it with the amazing
[3:23:17.440 --> 3:23:18.680]  products from Carol Stove.

[3:24:04.160 --> 3:24:14.280]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:24:14.280 --> 3:24:23.000]  By the way, Fox News is playing the 10 biggest stories of 2009.
[3:24:23.000 --> 3:24:28.800]  One of them is how the Japanese government wants to put lithium, an anti-psychotic,
[3:24:28.800 --> 3:24:29.800]  in the water supply.
[3:24:29.800 --> 3:24:33.520]  Let me give you a news flash.
[3:24:33.520 --> 3:24:38.600]  Most U.S. municipal supplies already have lithium added.
[3:24:38.600 --> 3:24:42.680]  You can go over the toxicology reports for your city's water.
[3:24:42.680 --> 3:24:49.040]  You'll find it's not leaching in, they're adding it.
[3:24:49.040 --> 3:24:54.200]  The national media calls me all the time, Alan White, when they say, you're crazy.
[3:24:54.200 --> 3:24:56.520]  You're saying they're putting cancer viruses in vaccines.
[3:24:56.520 --> 3:24:58.400]  You say they're drugging the water.
[3:24:58.400 --> 3:25:02.240]  And then I start emailing them mainstream articles and they shut up real fast.
[3:25:02.240 --> 3:25:03.800]  They always think they've gotten me.
[3:25:03.800 --> 3:25:08.760]  Then I'll be talking to some yuppie producer and I'll say, don't you care about your kids?
[3:25:08.760 --> 3:25:14.800]  And they'll start really, really realizing for their petty power position of lying that
[3:25:14.800 --> 3:25:17.840]  they're really assaulting their own children.
[3:25:17.840 --> 3:25:20.600]  But they still just giggle and go on with it.
[3:25:20.600 --> 3:25:27.280]  Briefly from your research, cancer viruses in vaccines and comative toxins in the water.
[3:25:27.280 --> 3:25:29.640]  Very, very old techniques.
[3:25:29.640 --> 3:25:34.120]  They started off with fluoride, of course, in the early days.
[3:25:34.120 --> 3:25:37.760]  They knew about this stuff at the beginning of the 1900s.
[3:25:37.760 --> 3:25:42.200]  And what it did to the people, it made them more pliable and more easily managed.
[3:25:42.200 --> 3:25:47.600]  But it was Japan, too, where they first noticed that a particular village in Japan, many
[3:25:47.600 --> 3:25:51.960]  years ago, were much more plastered than the average villager.
[3:25:51.960 --> 3:25:55.880]  And they realized, if they test the water, there was natural lithium in it.
[3:25:55.880 --> 3:25:57.840]  So that's where the idea sprung from.
[3:25:57.840 --> 3:26:02.720]  If you add this to other people's supplies, they'll make them more docile and easily managed.
[3:26:02.720 --> 3:26:06.480]  They won't care much what's happening in the big world or what's kind of coming down in
[3:26:06.480 --> 3:26:07.720]  the future.
[3:26:07.720 --> 3:26:09.840]  And that's why they're adding it across the world.
[3:26:09.840 --> 3:26:12.720]  They couldn't understand and go back to Julian Huxley.
[3:26:12.720 --> 3:26:19.680]  Julian Huxley, the brother of Aldu Huxley, his grandfather was Sir Thomas Huxley, the
[3:26:19.680 --> 3:26:21.440]  best friend of Charles Darwin.
[3:26:21.440 --> 3:26:24.280]  And Darwinism is a big part of this whole socialist agenda.
[3:26:24.280 --> 3:26:28.960]  It gave them ammunition for their purpose and for their planning for the future based
[3:26:28.960 --> 3:26:32.560]  on superior types, inferior types, and so on.
[3:26:32.560 --> 3:26:39.720]  And Julian Huxley talked about the coming system of control, but it would definitely
[3:26:39.720 --> 3:26:49.440]  use pharmacology, and it used hypnosis techniques of persuasion on television, and so on.
[3:26:49.440 --> 3:26:53.480]  That's what they would use for the public, and it's been very successful already.
[3:26:53.480 --> 3:26:57.840]  Never mind all the stuff that's naturally prescribed by the physicians in the tranquilizing
[3:26:57.840 --> 3:26:58.840]  business.
[3:26:58.840 --> 3:27:03.840]  They also put it into the water, and you've got to go into the writings, too, of another
[3:27:03.840 --> 3:27:09.200]  hardline communist, by the way, who worked for AMI-5, like most of them did.
[3:27:09.200 --> 3:27:12.440]  And that was Arthur Kessler, as declassified.
[3:27:12.440 --> 3:27:20.640]  He was an agent for them, and he worked with the United Nations during the 60s on projects
[3:27:20.640 --> 3:27:26.920]  to find ways of lobotomizing the human brain chemically, or through viral or bacterial
[3:27:26.920 --> 3:27:27.920]  means.
[3:27:27.920 --> 3:27:34.320]  They discussed the means of directing bio-warfare techniques right to the brain itself by injections.
[3:27:34.320 --> 3:27:38.040]  He said we can do it through the foot, we could do it through the water supply.
[3:27:38.040 --> 3:27:43.240]  Their only problem was how to actually introduce it, and of course the public weren't to know.
[3:27:43.240 --> 3:27:47.240]  And the UN had different teams all working on the same project, millions of dollars went
[3:27:47.240 --> 3:27:48.240]  into investigations.
[3:27:48.240 --> 3:27:56.080]  Russia went the straightforward way of mandatorily lobotomizing people physically.
[3:27:56.080 --> 3:28:01.240]  The criminal element, those who spoke out with the wrong thing or had inflexibility
[3:28:01.240 --> 3:28:05.840]  of opinion, that was a psychiatric disorder, they would lobotomize them, but they found
[3:28:05.840 --> 3:28:10.720]  that they could do it by inoculations where they could carry something right to the brain,
[3:28:10.720 --> 3:28:17.680]  fever develops in the baby, and they're short of few cents off the dollar from then on.
[3:28:17.680 --> 3:28:19.840]  That's all been done, I think, to go on.
[3:28:19.840 --> 3:28:20.840]  Which is good.
[3:28:20.840 --> 3:28:27.520]  I mean, you then get a partially lobotomized biological robot that you can then program,
[3:28:27.520 --> 3:28:33.600]  because programming doesn't work if it isn't started early, and if the person has an advanced
[3:28:33.600 --> 3:28:38.000]  intellect that will then later in life discover the programming, it'll then be hard to get
[3:28:38.000 --> 3:28:44.560]  rid of all of it, but then stronger willed people who are also intelligent can counterman
[3:28:44.560 --> 3:28:45.800]  the programming.
[3:28:45.800 --> 3:28:49.320]  But for a lot of people who are already just going to be average intelligence, they're
[3:28:49.320 --> 3:28:53.080]  now borderline retarded, and that's why you can't reach out to them.
[3:28:53.080 --> 3:29:00.480]  And officially the United Nations has lowered the official average IQ by about four or five
[3:29:00.480 --> 3:29:02.320]  points in the last four years.
[3:29:02.320 --> 3:29:05.760]  Yeah, pretty soon, geniuses will be able to tie their shoelaces.
[3:29:05.760 --> 3:29:06.760]  That's correct.
[3:29:06.760 --> 3:29:07.760]  That's correct.
[3:29:07.760 --> 3:29:08.760]  Yeah.
[3:29:08.760 --> 3:29:12.760]  And they giggle and laugh about this, and their argument is, hey, look, the public doesn't
[3:29:12.760 --> 3:29:14.440]  care we're brain damaging them.
[3:29:14.440 --> 3:29:17.440]  They deserve to be brain damaged further.
[3:29:17.440 --> 3:29:23.520]  And now we have the mass campaigns now with the fake flu pandemic and so on to terrify
[3:29:23.520 --> 3:29:29.520]  the public and to compliance, to get the liters upgraded by a warfare technique to lobotomize
[3:29:29.520 --> 3:29:30.520]  them.
[3:29:30.520 --> 3:29:35.840]  And it's still part of the team, just that we can't ask for volunteers.
[3:29:35.840 --> 3:29:37.680]  Alan Watts, stay there.
[3:29:37.680 --> 3:29:43.640]  I want to get into the flu, your take on that, then Copenhagen, and then some phone calls,
[3:29:43.640 --> 3:29:48.720]  and we'll play that clip from Fox News about drugging your water.
[3:29:48.720 --> 3:29:50.720]  It's the newest, coolest thing.
[3:29:50.720 --> 3:29:53.640]  Of course, they've already been doing it.
[3:29:53.640 --> 3:29:54.920]  We're on the march.
[3:29:54.920 --> 3:29:57.360]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:57.360 --> 3:30:01.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.040 --> 3:30:08.840]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:30:08.840 --> 3:30:13.680]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[3:30:13.680 --> 3:30:17.680]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[3:30:17.680 --> 3:30:22.040]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[3:30:22.040 --> 3:30:27.560]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[3:30:27.560 --> 3:30:34.440]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream, with continued
[3:30:34.440 --> 3:30:37.880]  legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[3:30:37.880 --> 3:30:43.480]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:30:43.480 --> 3:30:48.720]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[3:30:48.720 --> 3:30:55.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[3:30:55.000 --> 3:30:56.320]  Lungs Generator.
[3:30:56.320 --> 3:31:04.440]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[3:31:04.440 --> 3:31:08.160]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:31:08.160 --> 3:31:11.320]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:31:11.320 --> 3:31:15.680]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[3:31:15.680 --> 3:31:16.680]  at home.
[3:31:16.680 --> 3:31:21.680]  We've turned an endless influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling
[3:31:21.680 --> 3:31:22.680]  the shots.
[3:31:22.680 --> 3:31:27.680]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:31:27.680 --> 3:31:33.120]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[3:31:33.120 --> 3:31:37.840]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:31:37.840 --> 3:31:40.200]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:31:40.200 --> 3:31:44.360]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:31:44.360 --> 3:31:50.200]  They seem like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[3:31:50.200 --> 3:31:51.200]  of the Republic.
[3:31:51.200 --> 3:31:57.640]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right

[3:32:03.320 --> 3:32:06.360]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:32:06.360 --> 3:32:10.720]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[3:32:10.720 --> 3:32:11.720]  do you want?
[3:32:11.720 --> 3:32:13.720]  My answer would be all I can get.
[3:32:13.720 --> 3:32:18.760]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[3:32:18.760 --> 3:32:20.000]  How much do you want?
[3:32:20.000 --> 3:32:21.080]  When do you want it?
[3:32:21.080 --> 3:32:24.160]  Now or after the battle starts, when will you need it?
[3:32:24.160 --> 3:32:26.280]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:32:26.280 --> 3:32:27.600]  Will there be any food?
[3:32:27.600 --> 3:32:29.080]  Will it make your children sick?
[3:32:29.080 --> 3:32:33.200]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[3:32:33.200 --> 3:32:34.400]  and be immunized?
[3:32:34.400 --> 3:32:38.160]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:32:38.160 --> 3:32:41.760]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:32:41.760 --> 3:32:43.000]  How much will you need?
[3:32:43.000 --> 3:32:44.000]  We don't know.
[3:32:44.000 --> 3:32:45.000]  How much do you want?
[3:32:45.000 --> 3:32:46.000]  All you can get.
[3:32:46.000 --> 3:32:47.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:32:47.000 --> 3:32:50.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[3:32:50.000 --> 3:32:57.480]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:32:57.480 --> 3:33:24.800]  Again that number, 1-800-409-5633 Yeah, here's Fox News and I've seen MSNBC,
[3:33:24.800 --> 3:33:31.080]  Clips on YouTube, where they propose putting Prozac in the water and the federal government's
[3:33:31.080 --> 3:33:35.080]  also proposing putting statins in the water.
[3:33:35.080 --> 3:33:39.040]  They're now teaching kids that five-year-olds need anti-cholesterol drugs, which completely
[3:33:39.040 --> 3:33:40.040]  eat your liver.
[3:33:40.040 --> 3:33:43.200]  It just doesn't even help you with cholesterol.
[3:33:43.200 --> 3:33:45.360]  It's all lies.
[3:33:45.360 --> 3:33:49.880]  Now over 150 chemicals on average are put in US drinking water.
[3:33:49.880 --> 3:33:51.640]  Same thing in Canada, the UK.
[3:33:51.640 --> 3:34:00.800]  Some have over 300 and it's lithium, everything, of course lithium's a heavy metal, very toxic.
[3:34:00.800 --> 3:34:06.000]  It's the same thing with fluoride, sodium fluoride, but when you hear fluoride, that's
[3:34:06.000 --> 3:34:10.520]  a catch-all term under federal regulations for over 300 chemicals they're allowed to
[3:34:10.520 --> 3:34:16.560]  put in and mercury, they are killing you.
[3:34:16.560 --> 3:34:21.080]  Okay, that's why people look so bad, even if they exercise and try to eat healthy.
[3:34:21.080 --> 3:34:23.920]  I mean, these are sickos, okay?
[3:34:23.920 --> 3:34:26.640]  They openly write textbooks, how they want to kill us, and we're going to talk to Allen
[3:34:26.640 --> 3:34:28.840]  Watt about that in a moment.
[3:34:28.840 --> 3:34:31.760]  Real expert on this stuff and a big part of Fall of the Republic.
[3:34:31.760 --> 3:34:33.760]  But here's Fox Television.
[3:34:33.760 --> 3:34:37.120]  I'm going to share that with only two weeks left of 2009.
[3:34:37.120 --> 3:34:41.160]  We're taking a look back at some of the most interesting healthcare discoveries of the
[3:34:41.160 --> 3:34:42.160]  past year.
[3:34:42.160 --> 3:34:45.920]  Joining us is Fox 9 medical expert, Dr. R. Kel Georgia, to talk about it.
[3:34:45.920 --> 3:34:46.920]  Good morning.
[3:34:46.920 --> 3:34:52.640]  Our first theorist has been adding a fluoride to its public water supply for decades, and
[3:34:52.640 --> 3:34:54.280]  it's a question to prevent tooth decay.
[3:34:54.280 --> 3:35:00.080]  All researchers from Japan are suggesting that we add lithium, so why is that?
[3:35:00.080 --> 3:35:04.240]  Well, they're actually not suggesting it, but they're certainly looking into it.
[3:35:04.240 --> 3:35:08.680]  Lithium is a medication that in prescription doses treats mood disorders in people with
[3:35:08.680 --> 3:35:11.640]  bipolar disorder or manic depressive illness.
[3:35:11.640 --> 3:35:17.760]  What these researchers found in Japan is that lithium is present in trace amounts in the
[3:35:17.760 --> 3:35:22.880]  normal water supply in some communities, and in those communities they have a lower suicide
[3:35:22.880 --> 3:35:23.880]  rate.
[3:35:23.880 --> 3:35:28.520]  And so they're really investigating whether trace amounts of lithium can just change the
[3:35:28.520 --> 3:35:33.440]  mood in a community enough to really, in a positive way, without having the bad effects
[3:35:33.440 --> 3:35:36.640]  of lithium, to really affect the mood and decrease the suicide rate.
[3:35:36.640 --> 3:35:37.640]  Very interesting concept.
[3:35:37.640 --> 3:35:43.440]  You know, it's the same reason why we put iodine and salt, fluoride, and water.
[3:35:43.440 --> 3:35:48.560]  There's many different examples of when we put trace amounts of chemicals in the normal
[3:35:48.560 --> 3:35:51.120]  supply of food or water to help people's health.
[3:35:51.120 --> 3:35:52.120]  Right.
[3:35:52.120 --> 3:35:55.640]  Although not, this is at first where they're actually affecting people's moods and, you
[3:35:55.640 --> 3:35:56.640]  know, the brain.
[3:35:56.640 --> 3:35:59.920]  So that, I'm sure, puts up a lot of red flags for people.
[3:35:59.920 --> 3:36:00.920]  All right.
[3:36:00.920 --> 3:36:01.920]  Moving on.
[3:36:01.920 --> 3:36:05.000]  So what they do is they pitch it to you as a great thing.
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:06.560]  It's already being done.
[3:36:06.560 --> 3:36:07.760]  Something's already put in your water.
[3:36:07.760 --> 3:36:08.760]  Okay.
[3:36:08.760 --> 3:36:09.760]  Let me give everybody the news flash.
[3:36:09.760 --> 3:36:14.360]  You can pull up an EPA report for any major city, and sure, they could say small towns
[3:36:14.360 --> 3:36:16.520]  have natural trace amounts.
[3:36:16.520 --> 3:36:21.400]  Some towns have natural trace amounts of mercury or arsenic or cyanide.
[3:36:21.400 --> 3:36:23.960]  Does it mean you want to go drink it, Alan Watt?
[3:36:23.960 --> 3:36:27.840]  This is, they're really getting us ready for this because they know we're exposing that
[3:36:27.840 --> 3:36:29.480]  they're already putting it in the water.
[3:36:29.480 --> 3:36:33.600]  So they're going, yeah, we're chemtrailing you, John P. Holdren, this year admitted it,
[3:36:33.600 --> 3:36:35.600]  and yeah, we're putting stuff in your water.
[3:36:35.600 --> 3:36:37.240]  What's wrong with that?
[3:36:37.240 --> 3:36:42.960]  We have to go back again quite some time to realize that this is nothing new about the
[3:36:42.960 --> 3:36:51.320]  idea that the big boys had global meetings back in the 30s even, 40s, 50s, always looking
[3:36:51.320 --> 3:36:57.120]  towards this future world society they were going to bring it to be, and they talked to
[3:36:57.120 --> 3:37:00.880]  us about ways of doing it, and pharma was to be a big part of it.
[3:37:00.880 --> 3:37:06.400]  No doubt about that, they all talked about using pharma, and you find with Dick New-Brasinski,
[3:37:06.400 --> 3:37:10.880]  who pretty well says he's got his own man, and as the president now because he trained
[3:37:10.880 --> 3:37:17.000]  him, in his book, Between Two Ages, that he published back in the 1970s, he talked about
[3:37:17.000 --> 3:37:18.000]  mind control.
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:22.320]  He talked about the tectonatronic era, but he talked about other methods too, where the
[3:37:22.320 --> 3:37:28.760]  public would be basically made docile, he said it can be done electronically by using
[3:37:28.760 --> 3:37:33.640]  standing waves across a whole continent if need be, which means it was already tested
[3:37:33.640 --> 3:37:39.480]  out back in the 70s, that's what works, but they also mentioned other methods as well.
[3:37:39.480 --> 3:37:45.320]  And then I saw Baltimore Sun article about eight years ago, where it said, oh DARPA in
[3:37:45.320 --> 3:37:50.320]  major cities is testing calming waves to make everyone happy.
[3:37:50.320 --> 3:37:54.040]  What's wrong with calming waves, Alan?
[3:37:54.040 --> 3:37:55.440]  Why are you and I different?
[3:37:55.440 --> 3:38:00.720]  Why don't we love the government putting a toxic heavy metal in the water to brain damages?
[3:38:00.720 --> 3:38:03.400]  Why don't we like mind control towers?
[3:38:03.400 --> 3:38:08.200]  Why don't we like police and black uniforms and secret arrest and torture?
[3:38:08.200 --> 3:38:10.040]  What's wrong with us, Alan, what?
[3:38:10.040 --> 3:38:15.000]  I think there's something wrong with the uptake in our brains for these particular chemicals,
[3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:20.800]  perhaps, really somewhere else, which actually does happen in some people's physiologies.
[3:38:20.800 --> 3:38:25.760]  As the same with inoculations, they found that with the standard childhood inoculations,
[3:38:25.760 --> 3:38:29.840]  the doctors are all trained to tell the mother, don't worry, they go home with a fever as
[3:38:29.840 --> 3:38:30.840]  based in the head.
[3:38:30.840 --> 3:38:35.800]  Well, when you have an inflammation in the head, you have an inflammation in the brain,
[3:38:35.800 --> 3:38:40.800]  inflammation causes brain cells to die off, so this is all supposedly normal.
[3:38:40.800 --> 3:38:46.520]  Don't worry, we just brain damage your child and lower their IQ by three points, and after
[3:38:46.520 --> 3:38:50.840]  50 shots, they're going to be retarded, don't worry, I've got power, I wear a white lab
[3:38:50.840 --> 3:38:51.840]  coat.
[3:38:51.840 --> 3:38:53.880]  Oh, I love my mistress, so go ahead.
[3:38:53.880 --> 3:38:58.840]  And then some people, there's always a few individuals where because these particular
[3:38:58.840 --> 3:39:04.600]  bio warfare chemicals will attach themselves to uptake, I mean, you ask it to go to the
[3:39:04.600 --> 3:39:10.480]  brain because of different physiology, sometimes it's really somewhere else into the intestine,
[3:39:10.480 --> 3:39:13.920]  and to other parts of the body, they'll end up with various allergies, it's a very common
[3:39:13.920 --> 3:39:14.920]  stuff.
[3:39:14.920 --> 3:39:18.520]  And then there's serenity, based on the, well, I mean, you may have seen it, but for those
[3:39:18.520 --> 3:39:25.200]  that don't know, they go to this planet where everybody's died to find out, and they discover
[3:39:25.200 --> 3:39:30.160]  the government was putting basically Prozac into the air, but they found that one percent
[3:39:30.160 --> 3:39:32.320]  of people, it makes them psycho killers.
[3:39:32.320 --> 3:39:36.040]  So that's the establishment kind of saying, what we're doing is having some unintended
[3:39:36.040 --> 3:39:37.040]  consequences, go ahead.
[3:39:37.040 --> 3:39:41.920]  Yes, and it's the same when they inject you with various things, not everyone comes down
[3:39:41.920 --> 3:39:48.160]  with it with the fever, but often those children will come down with asthma or intestinal problems
[3:39:48.160 --> 3:39:49.160]  the rest of their life.
[3:39:49.160 --> 3:39:55.360]  They admit that all Crohn's cases have the measles and other vaccine antibodies, because
[3:39:55.360 --> 3:40:00.920]  oh, the autoimmune attack didn't eat your brain and ate your guts, oh.
[3:40:00.920 --> 3:40:05.400]  And so you often find people who have these problems are a bit brighter, they're more
[3:40:05.400 --> 3:40:08.400]  aware of what's going on because the brain was unaffected.
[3:40:08.400 --> 3:40:14.760]  Now they're going for everyone now with pharma, the calmatives as they call them, openly.
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:20.800]  And remember after 9-11, I think it was Rumsfeld, he was on television in the U.S., it was broadcast
[3:40:20.800 --> 3:40:26.200]  on Canadian TV, and he was asked by a reporter, what are you going to do if another major
[3:40:26.200 --> 3:40:27.200]  crisis breaks out?
[3:40:27.200 --> 3:40:34.160]  He says, contingency plans, he says, we aerosolize Valium and Prozac, he said, we can spray
[3:40:34.160 --> 3:40:39.240]  over entire cities or whole areas, and I thought, well, carefully, because if the Valium kicks
[3:40:39.240 --> 3:40:44.320]  in quick, you see, of course the Prozac takes about a week to build up in the system and
[3:40:44.320 --> 3:40:45.580]  then takes over.
[3:40:45.580 --> 3:40:50.440]  So they've already had these things discussed and ready to go for who knows in many decades.
[3:40:50.440 --> 3:40:53.600]  And now they've been spraying us, so John P. Holder can come out and say, yes, we're
[3:40:53.600 --> 3:40:54.680]  spraying you.
[3:40:54.680 --> 3:40:58.960]  He can tell the Associated Press, there can be video of it, and people just go, they're
[3:40:58.960 --> 3:40:59.960]  not spraying me.
[3:40:59.960 --> 3:41:02.000]  Well, the White House scientists just said they are.
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:03.000]  No, they're not.
[3:41:03.000 --> 3:41:10.560]  In fact, there was a TV show in New York yesterday, and a news hour just came out, and advised
[3:41:10.560 --> 3:41:16.480]  people who have children with asthma to move out of the East Side for overnight if possible
[3:41:16.480 --> 3:41:21.400]  because of heavy metallic spraying, that's all they said in this little clip.
[3:41:21.400 --> 3:41:22.400]  Oh.
[3:41:22.400 --> 3:41:26.480]  No justification, no follow-up, no wise, that's all they said.
[3:41:26.480 --> 3:41:30.120]  Well, Alan, what's wrong with having aluminum dioxide sprayed on you?
[3:41:30.120 --> 3:41:32.080]  I mean, they're only helping you.
[3:41:32.080 --> 3:41:33.080]  That's right.
[3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:36.760]  And then the barrier mobile help build up, and if they cancer early, so you're not a
[3:41:36.760 --> 3:41:41.080]  burden on the coming healthcare system.
[3:41:41.080 --> 3:41:44.760]  These are really loving people, they're just so loving.
[3:41:44.760 --> 3:41:49.920]  You know, you have to go into the characters behind all of this, and who, is that the Copenhagen
[3:41:49.920 --> 3:41:55.440]  meeting, for instance, and the big eugenicist there, the big utopian there, Dennis Meadows
[3:41:55.440 --> 3:41:58.000]  is there, he was one of the big boys of the Club of Rome.
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:41:59.000]  In fact, talk about that.
[3:41:59.000 --> 3:42:03.520]  The head of the Chinese delegation said, we own your debt, this is for those Monday-associated
[3:42:03.520 --> 3:42:10.920]  press and others, and we want global government, one-child policies for Americans, and our
[3:42:10.920 --> 3:42:14.600]  government suddenly announced, yeah, we're looking at this, so, I mean, they're just
[3:42:14.600 --> 3:42:15.600]  out, go ahead, Alan.
[3:42:15.600 --> 3:42:22.040]  And don't forget, as they look at the panel appointed in the U.S. Congress, there's John
[3:42:22.040 --> 3:42:28.400]  Holdren there who wrote the book, Ecoscience, back in the 70s with another mainline communist,
[3:42:28.400 --> 3:42:35.200]  and they are communists, by the way, hardline communists, and Holdren himself said he wants
[3:42:35.200 --> 3:42:38.400]  compulsory sterilization of the public.
[3:42:38.400 --> 3:42:45.120]  He said, we can't do the same in America, as we do in India, because people in America
[3:42:45.120 --> 3:42:50.880]  are better educated, they might catch on, so they'll have to do it surreptitiously, covertly,
[3:42:50.880 --> 3:42:56.080]  and basically sterilize the people by other means, and they discussed what the ideal population
[3:42:56.080 --> 3:42:57.080]  should be.
[3:42:57.080 --> 3:43:01.360]  These characters are all on board, and you have your Holdrens, and every government
[3:43:01.360 --> 3:43:07.000]  of the Western world right now, that's not by chance, they're all on board right now,
[3:43:07.000 --> 3:43:13.000]  appointed, and the whole agenda is now set to roll forth at an incredible pace.
[3:43:13.000 --> 3:43:17.560]  Remember too, in communism, the planks of communism was a destruction of the family
[3:43:17.560 --> 3:43:20.720]  unit.
[3:43:20.720 --> 3:43:24.040]  Families contaminate the children, according to them, so that Bertrand Russell, he agreed
[3:43:24.040 --> 3:43:29.040]  with this, by passing on outmoded family values.
[3:43:29.040 --> 3:43:34.040]  Yeah, you've got to have the state purely programming, and now everywhere, under the
[3:43:34.040 --> 3:43:40.040]  environment, police, that most of the kid's curriculum is dossiers on mommy and daddy,
[3:43:40.040 --> 3:43:41.040]  on record.
[3:43:41.040 --> 3:43:47.480]  Yes, and they also said in the communist manifesto, the family was an enemy, because the state
[3:43:47.480 --> 3:43:52.760]  must be able to talk to you directly, with no relatives around to stand up with you.
[3:43:52.760 --> 3:43:56.440]  And because we've had a couple generations raised in Europe and the U.S. and Canada on
[3:43:56.440 --> 3:44:01.640]  this, the parents are in the news, locally, and going, I'm glad my child is my boss and
[3:44:01.640 --> 3:44:04.240]  writes reports on me.
[3:44:04.240 --> 3:44:08.160]  And that was all part of the push for single moms, by the way, that people don't realize
[3:44:08.160 --> 3:44:11.560]  that they don't give a darn about mothers and women's rights.
[3:44:11.560 --> 3:44:17.960]  They use them all for a different purpose, to divide families and get them down until
[3:44:17.960 --> 3:44:23.000]  it's just you, the unit, like always 84, with that camera, I can pull you up and say, yeah,
[3:44:23.000 --> 3:44:25.720]  you Smith, and there's nobody around to help you.
[3:44:25.720 --> 3:44:30.160]  That's what government, and we all said that we will never win until we can talk directly
[3:44:30.160 --> 3:44:35.080]  to each citizen, and there's no other citizen who will stand up beside them.
[3:44:35.080 --> 3:44:37.080]  That's already here.
[3:44:37.080 --> 3:44:42.640]  But you have to understand, too, another plank of the manifesto was the distribution
[3:44:42.640 --> 3:44:44.480]  of wealth.
[3:44:44.480 --> 3:44:48.040]  And they could not bring it through under disguise because everyone knew, at least not
[3:44:48.040 --> 3:44:50.120]  so long ago, what communism was.
[3:44:50.120 --> 3:44:55.240]  But now it's for the earth, you pay Al Gore, and the polar bears live.
[3:44:55.240 --> 3:45:01.040]  Yes, they brought it back under different guise, much more clever, and wrapped some scientific
[3:45:01.040 --> 3:45:05.040]  jargon and a lot of fakery over it, and a lot of hype and terror and fear, if you don't
[3:45:05.040 --> 3:45:06.040]  comply.
[3:45:06.040 --> 3:45:11.320]  And they're bringing it out, and it's the vaccine, and they promised new technologies
[3:45:11.320 --> 3:45:15.120]  to free everyone while they really set up a scientific dictatorship that doesn't allow
[3:45:15.120 --> 3:45:16.720]  new technologies to develop.
[3:45:16.720 --> 3:45:17.920]  That's actually in the treaty.
[3:45:17.920 --> 3:45:21.560]  Actually, the communists, that was their favorite thing 80 years ago, Alan.
[3:45:21.560 --> 3:45:22.560]  Yes.
[3:45:22.560 --> 3:45:26.600]  I'm going to understand it never died, and never died, as the Reese Commission showed,
[3:45:26.600 --> 3:45:28.400]  it was to blend with the West.
[3:45:28.400 --> 3:45:33.120]  By the time it would blend, the West would already be degraded culturally, and we have
[3:45:33.120 --> 3:45:40.280]  been degraded by thanks to Hollywood and television, and again, through the academia system because
[3:45:40.280 --> 3:45:45.960]  at two, we must have an international academic authority, and that was set up eventually
[3:45:45.960 --> 3:45:46.960]  the United Nations.
[3:45:46.960 --> 3:45:50.640]  So everything's standardized to the point where the average person tuning in who's a
[3:45:50.640 --> 3:45:54.800]  new listener just thinks we're gibbering and jabbering.
[3:45:54.800 --> 3:45:58.600]  I see people on YouTube everywhere, they watch these videos, they go, what are they talking
[3:45:58.600 --> 3:45:59.600]  about?
[3:45:59.600 --> 3:46:00.600]  Yeah.
[3:46:00.600 --> 3:46:04.600]  And it's like, we're weird because we know the names of government groups, so that's
[3:46:04.600 --> 3:46:05.600]  bad.
[3:46:05.600 --> 3:46:06.600]  That's right.
[3:46:06.600 --> 3:46:10.640]  It's also been trained, like Brzezinski said, that unless it's on mainstream media, that
[3:46:10.640 --> 3:46:15.360]  they will not believe it, by the same token, if something is on mainstream media, which
[3:46:15.360 --> 3:46:20.440]  is totally fictitious, they will believe it, like the fake flu pandemic.
[3:46:20.440 --> 3:46:28.200]  But I was contacted recently by a group under Ted Turner's group, Massive Network System,
[3:46:28.200 --> 3:46:34.560]  asking me if I come on and talk about global warming before the Copenhagen thing came up,
[3:46:34.560 --> 3:46:39.320]  and the two producers, a man and a woman, talked to me for quite some time.
[3:46:39.320 --> 3:46:43.160]  And I caught on right away that they wanted someone who didn't know their facts.
[3:46:43.160 --> 3:46:46.840]  They wanted someone who would just be anti this or anti that.
[3:46:46.840 --> 3:46:52.760]  And I was dishing out names, speeches, comments made by the big boys themselves on creating
[3:46:52.760 --> 3:46:57.560]  the fake global warming crisis like the Club of Rome, and the two founders that mentioned
[3:46:57.560 --> 3:46:59.240]  them, I mentioned their book.
[3:46:59.240 --> 3:47:05.080]  I said they came up with the idea and admitted in their book, and I mentioned the fact after
[3:47:05.080 --> 3:47:10.120]  fact after fact for an hour, and I knew by the end of the hour, these folks would not
[3:47:10.120 --> 3:47:14.360]  have me on, because they didn't want someone on who could present the facts.
[3:47:14.360 --> 3:47:20.560]  They wanted somebody on to say, I like global warming, means I'll be able to surf more.
[3:47:20.560 --> 3:47:22.560]  You would have been on TV.
[3:47:22.560 --> 3:47:23.560]  That's right.
[3:47:23.560 --> 3:47:29.000]  They wanted someone who would just go up there and be emotional and angry and so on, but
[3:47:29.000 --> 3:47:31.240]  they have no fact to back anything up.
[3:47:31.240 --> 3:47:36.480]  They have discredited all the rest of them who had the fact that they were never heard.
[3:47:36.480 --> 3:47:41.400]  But the system is so discredited that even if that was the case, I mean, that's why
[3:47:41.400 --> 3:47:43.320]  the globalists are running out of steam.
[3:47:43.320 --> 3:47:48.000]  Their scientific dictatorship, look at this, Wembley School teaches students to be detectives.
[3:47:48.000 --> 3:47:50.440]  And it says they come home and investigate their parents.
[3:47:50.440 --> 3:47:54.040]  This is outside Austin, but this is done in Austin too.
[3:47:54.040 --> 3:48:00.000]  They come home and inspect their parents and write up detectives' reports on their parents'
[3:48:00.000 --> 3:48:01.920]  carbon footprint.
[3:48:01.920 --> 3:48:04.880]  This is going on nationwide, oh, the freedom.
[3:48:04.880 --> 3:48:05.880]  Yes.
[3:48:05.880 --> 3:48:12.040]  And now in Britain, they're going after people who live in rural communities.
[3:48:12.040 --> 3:48:17.040]  Remember, Agenda 21 at the United Nations, they're all at all times together where the
[3:48:17.040 --> 3:48:24.000]  rural folk be crushed into the already overcrowded cities as this generation is to die off.
[3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:27.560]  That's the key to it over the next 30, 40 years.
[3:48:27.560 --> 3:48:32.480]  And they're going after people's stoves in Britain if you heat by a certain particular
[3:48:32.480 --> 3:48:33.480]  oil type stove.
[3:48:33.480 --> 3:48:35.120]  It eats the house and it eats the...
[3:48:35.120 --> 3:48:40.000]  Yeah, they're shutting off everybody's industry, and this is all in their own statements to
[3:48:40.000 --> 3:48:41.920]  destroy your independence.
[3:48:41.920 --> 3:48:45.080]  Let's talk to John and Main, and then Andy and David in the next segment.
[3:48:45.080 --> 3:48:46.080]  John, you're on the air.
[3:48:46.080 --> 3:48:47.080]  Go ahead.
[3:48:47.080 --> 3:48:48.080]  Well, hey, Alex.
[3:48:48.080 --> 3:48:49.080]  How are you doing?
[3:48:49.080 --> 3:48:51.080]  Go ahead, sir.
[3:48:51.080 --> 3:48:56.960]  Yeah, so I've been listening to you for about two weeks now, and a lot of the stuff you've
[3:48:56.960 --> 3:49:01.560]  been saying has really been matching up with my experience after working on Wall Street
[3:49:01.560 --> 3:49:03.800]  for about 10 years.
[3:49:03.800 --> 3:49:09.080]  I worked for Deutsche Bank, Private Bank, and I was just involved, basically, in an
[3:49:09.080 --> 3:49:16.080]  enormous money laundering operation that a lot of the very same people who were calling
[3:49:16.080 --> 3:49:22.000]  for higher taxes have all their money in these offshore accounts with layer upon layer of
[3:49:22.000 --> 3:49:26.120]  legal protection so that people will never buy their money.
[3:49:26.120 --> 3:49:27.880]  And it's all selectively enforced.
[3:49:27.880 --> 3:49:32.560]  They only burn the little people who are offshore and steal their money for themselves.
[3:49:32.560 --> 3:49:39.160]  Yes, it's private banks, private bankers, that now run the government and run the IRS.
[3:49:39.160 --> 3:49:40.760]  Any more comments, John?
[3:49:40.760 --> 3:49:45.520]  No, well, the only other thing I wanted to say is that I was working down in the Miami
[3:49:45.520 --> 3:49:53.280]  Office, and these banks are involved in huge drug, money laundering operations as well.
[3:49:53.280 --> 3:49:55.280]  That's all.
[3:49:55.280 --> 3:49:59.840]  You should write a report about it, but I mean, they now admit on British television
[3:49:59.840 --> 3:50:02.920]  that our government grows the opium, but says, oh, it's a good thing.
[3:50:02.920 --> 3:50:06.160]  I mean, there really is a coming out on the open now, isn't there?
[3:50:06.160 --> 3:50:10.800]  I think it was just yesterday, there's an article in the Canadian newspaper and in a
[3:50:10.800 --> 3:50:17.040]  U.S. newspaper, which stated after a survey and investigation that the banks that were
[3:50:17.040 --> 3:50:21.040]  kept afloat during the supposed, and that's a planned crisis, obviously.
[3:50:21.040 --> 3:50:25.520]  Yeah, the U.N. said drug money kept us afloat, drug money is good, yeah.
[3:50:25.520 --> 3:50:26.520]  That's right.
[3:50:26.520 --> 3:50:27.520]  That's right.
[3:50:27.520 --> 3:50:28.520]  They came out there, drug money did it.
[3:50:28.520 --> 3:50:32.440]  And of course, there'll be no investigation as to who's responsible because they all
[3:50:32.440 --> 3:50:33.440]  know who's responsible.
[3:50:33.440 --> 3:50:38.200]  But if you're caught with a matchbox of it, you're going to a slave prison.
[3:50:38.200 --> 3:50:39.200]  You're correct.
[3:50:39.200 --> 3:50:44.440]  Someone in the state's formula day and said they could not believe it, they're 65 and
[3:50:44.440 --> 3:50:48.200]  they were asked why they wanted to buy a box of matches.
[3:50:48.200 --> 3:50:55.120]  Oh, yeah, everywhere, matches, spray paint, over-the-counter drugs, everyone's being asked
[3:50:55.120 --> 3:50:56.120]  questions.
[3:50:56.120 --> 3:50:59.560]  All the clerks are being trained to ask questions like we live in Red Dawn.
[3:50:59.560 --> 3:51:00.560]  That's correct.
[3:51:00.560 --> 3:51:05.520]  I mean, just folks, we are gone.
[3:51:05.520 --> 3:51:06.520]  This is not a drill.
[3:51:06.520 --> 3:51:08.520]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[3:51:08.520 --> 3:51:11.120]  Gun cells are on a staggering pace.
[3:51:11.120 --> 3:51:14.920]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now
[3:51:14.920 --> 3:51:18.240]  want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[3:51:18.240 --> 3:51:22.640]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[3:51:22.640 --> 3:51:27.040]  You'll learn step by step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals
[3:51:27.040 --> 3:51:31.280]  will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should
[3:51:31.280 --> 3:51:34.920]  never hide your guns under any circumstance.
[3:51:34.920 --> 3:51:38.760]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons
[3:51:38.760 --> 3:51:42.040]  safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[3:51:42.040 --> 3:51:46.920]  But listen up, for security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear
[3:51:46.920 --> 3:51:48.920]  without warning at any time.
[3:51:48.920 --> 3:51:58.600]  Go to hideyourguns.com or call 877-327-0365 before they come for your guns.

[3:52:01.240 --> 3:52:08.520]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:52:08.520 --> 3:52:11.440]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:52:11.440 --> 3:52:16.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[3:52:16.000 --> 3:52:17.000]  at home.
[3:52:17.000 --> 3:52:21.480]  I have determined the members' influence on our president and Congress and they really
[3:52:21.480 --> 3:52:22.760]  are calling the shots.
[3:52:22.760 --> 3:52:27.960]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:27.960 --> 3:52:31.320]  The fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[3:52:31.320 --> 3:52:37.160]  The criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[3:52:37.160 --> 3:52:38.160]  world government.
[3:52:38.160 --> 3:52:42.520]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and their arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[3:52:42.520 --> 3:52:44.680]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:52:44.680 --> 3:52:50.080]  Today, it seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[3:52:50.080 --> 3:52:51.920]  a fall of the Republic.
[3:52:51.920 --> 3:52:58.480]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now

[3:53:03.480 --> 3:53:07.840]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[3:53:07.840 --> 3:53:11.080]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[3:53:11.080 --> 3:53:15.320]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our
[3:53:15.320 --> 3:53:18.040]  lives and our family's health are in jeopardy.
[3:53:18.040 --> 3:53:22.800]  If we the people do not diligently assert these rights, they may be taken away and lost
[3:53:22.800 --> 3:53:23.800]  forever.
[3:53:23.800 --> 3:53:28.520]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom and we will not meekly allow ourselves
[3:53:28.520 --> 3:53:33.520]  to be led as lambs to the slaughter, sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery
[3:53:33.520 --> 3:53:36.720]  that are being placed on America is not an option.
[3:53:36.720 --> 3:53:39.280]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.

[3:54:17.040 --> 3:54:28.680]  We have a group of criminal pirates running our society.
[3:54:28.680 --> 3:54:32.280]  They're training your children to spy on you and despise you.
[3:54:32.280 --> 3:54:36.080]  They're teaching them, they're the boss, Al Gore on tape.
[3:54:36.080 --> 3:54:39.640]  Your parents don't know, you do, you're in control now.
[3:54:39.640 --> 3:54:44.480]  Time magazine for kids saying your parents belong to a bygone pathetic age, you know freedom
[3:54:44.480 --> 3:54:49.600]  and you want the microchip, that's a paraphrase quote, I mean just bizarre and it's over the
[3:54:49.600 --> 3:54:50.600]  top.
[3:54:50.600 --> 3:54:54.360]  They just intimidate you into accepting tyranny, they just throw it in your face and you just
[3:54:54.360 --> 3:54:55.360]  capitulate.
[3:54:55.360 --> 3:54:58.000]  Alan Watt comments on that.
[3:54:58.000 --> 3:55:03.400]  That's true because they are organized, they can't help but be organized because the biggest
[3:55:03.400 --> 3:55:06.200]  bankers on the planet are in on this whole future.
[3:55:06.200 --> 3:55:14.360]  I used to be astonished as to why Victor Rothschild, Lord Victor Rothschild has now been disclosed
[3:55:14.360 --> 3:55:18.720]  and he knew it all along in the 60s, in the 40s, even the 50s.
[3:55:18.720 --> 3:55:23.160]  He was a member of the Communist Party, he joined the Cambridge.
[3:55:23.160 --> 3:55:28.080]  So he was a man from the richest, not the richest banking family on the planet.
[3:55:28.080 --> 3:55:37.280]  He also belonged to the Mossad later on and he sold out all of the plans of Britain including
[3:55:37.280 --> 3:55:42.440]  the A-bombs to the Russians, he gave it to them basically and his personal belief and
[3:55:42.440 --> 3:55:47.880]  this is what's so important was, his personal belief was that the right sort of people would
[3:55:47.880 --> 3:55:53.560]  eventually rule the world and these were the most intelligent, once again on the Darwinian
[3:55:53.560 --> 3:55:59.520]  principle, who'd come down through centuries accumulating, getting to the top, holding
[3:55:59.520 --> 3:56:03.920]  on to wealth for instance, while they had the right to rule but he believed that money
[3:56:03.920 --> 3:56:11.000]  and he was a truthful character, a banker, he said money is only a system of controlling
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:17.360]  people and gaining power for those in the top, everyone works, as Karl Marx said, by
[3:56:17.360 --> 3:56:20.520]  labor, labor is the only real producer there is.
[3:56:20.520 --> 3:56:26.280]  That's right, the banks don't need more tax money, it's a system of control.
[3:56:26.280 --> 3:56:30.440]  And he believed that money can be anything, it's already proven that after the Britain
[3:56:30.440 --> 3:56:34.080]  Woods Agreement when it brought into action on the reserve, or the coal power.
[3:56:34.080 --> 3:56:38.280]  And speaking of that, they are now announcing the Arabs are fully going off the dollar,
[3:56:38.280 --> 3:56:40.200]  it is the end of the dollar.
[3:56:40.200 --> 3:56:45.160]  That's correct and they knew this back, remember when they signed the GAT treaty, the public
[3:56:45.160 --> 3:56:50.400]  were kept out of it, it was never explained to them by any media what the general agreement
[3:56:50.400 --> 3:56:56.800]  on creating tariffs was, never told them that yes, we would be, the taxpayer would be funding
[3:56:56.800 --> 3:57:02.160]  for their own factories to uproot and go to China, they never said the taxpayers will
[3:57:02.160 --> 3:57:05.360]  pay these corporations for 10 years.
[3:57:05.360 --> 3:57:10.240]  And by the way, you're not just saying that, of the 50 billion GM bailout, more than half
[3:57:10.240 --> 3:57:14.880]  of it went to pay to move the factories to Brazil, China, and Eastern Europe.
[3:57:14.880 --> 3:57:19.000]  We literally pay.
[3:57:19.000 --> 3:57:23.800]  And the public were utterly ignorant, even when suddenly everything started to be made
[3:57:23.800 --> 3:57:29.640]  in China, made in China, they didn't, because most of the public are never conscious.
[3:57:29.640 --> 3:57:35.880]  They love paying to lose their job, they love SWAT teams, they love open borders, they love
[3:57:35.880 --> 3:57:40.960]  their kids coming home and ordering them around, they love drinking fluoride, they love, they
[3:57:40.960 --> 3:57:41.960]  love it.
[3:57:41.960 --> 3:57:48.560]  They do and they love to play and that's a problem and that is a big problem.
[3:57:48.560 --> 3:57:54.320]  They are the middle people who will do nothing, they'll go whichever way the winner goes.
[3:57:54.320 --> 3:57:55.320]  That's how it works.
[3:57:55.320 --> 3:57:56.320]  That's right, that's why they do it.
[3:57:56.320 --> 3:58:00.160]  They think the globalists are winning and so even now that it's proven we're going
[3:58:00.160 --> 3:58:06.480]  into a tyrannical world government, they're going, I like it, I love my kids, I keep my
[3:58:06.480 --> 3:58:07.480]  head down.
[3:58:07.480 --> 3:58:08.480]  That's their attitude.
[3:58:08.480 --> 3:58:13.800]  Well, it's like the guy in 1984 who's bragging on his kid being a spy and when his kid denounces
[3:58:13.800 --> 3:58:17.400]  him, he says, I don't know what little guy denounced me, but I'm sure he was right.
[3:58:17.400 --> 3:58:20.520]  I'm so proud of him and it's the same thing.
[3:58:20.520 --> 3:58:26.120]  I mean, listen, Alan, great interview, we're going to have you on what, early January or
[3:58:26.120 --> 3:58:30.360]  two full hours to take more calls, sorry to all the callers, get to more of you tomorrow.
