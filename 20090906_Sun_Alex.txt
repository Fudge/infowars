[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.160 --> 00:31.960]  Texas Alex Jones we're gonna be going the whole nine yards today ladies and
[00:31.960 --> 00:42.360]  gentlemen it is the sixth day of September 2009 on this Sunday edition we
[00:42.360 --> 00:46.480]  have the founder and head of architects and engineers for 911 truth Richard
[00:46.480 --> 00:53.760]  Gage joining us in the second hour today to respond to the extremely shoddy
[00:53.760 --> 00:59.920]  peace trying to demonize 911 truth and those questioning government-sponsored
[00:59.920 --> 01:07.720]  terrorism that was actually funded by a foreign country that's who produced it
[01:07.720 --> 01:11.800]  and funded it for the National Geographic Channel we're gonna play
[01:11.800 --> 01:18.160]  some clips from the show and debunk the debunkers in the second hour today with
[01:18.160 --> 01:26.640]  Richard Gage look forward to having him on the show with us this ties in with
[01:26.640 --> 01:34.840]  Van Jones the White House green jobs are resigning last night for supposedly
[01:34.840 --> 01:42.920]  signing a 2004 petition to reopen the investigation of 911 now seven members
[01:42.920 --> 01:49.120]  of the 10 member commission have said that but this is a little known secret
[01:49.120 --> 01:54.720]  and so that's just a standard leftist or democratic position because they thought
[01:54.720 --> 01:59.520]  it would burn George Bush I'm a political I go where the truth is I'm
[01:59.520 --> 02:04.080]  exposing Barack Obama I'm exposing George Bush the facts are the media want
[02:04.080 --> 02:09.720]  to make this a left-right issue about 911 truth when it isn't I am the founder
[02:09.720 --> 02:14.880]  of 911 truth I'm the first person to talk about 911 the attack on the World
[02:14.880 --> 02:18.280]  Trade Center talked about it months and months before it happened said they were
[02:18.280 --> 02:22.920]  probably gonna blow up the towers and blame it on their CIA asset who some have
[02:22.920 --> 02:30.680]  been lauding so if anybody can speak today or 911 truth it's me a dangerous
[02:30.680 --> 02:34.280]  position but I'm happy to take it because if we don't expose government
[02:34.280 --> 02:40.280]  sponsored terrorism the establishment with 911 and 7 7 and many other events
[02:40.280 --> 02:45.880]  are going to continue to stage events and use that as a pretext to clamp down
[02:45.880 --> 02:55.760]  and take the liberties of the general public as the club of Rome has said as
[02:55.760 --> 02:59.360]  many other government documents have stated council and farm relations
[02:59.360 --> 03:03.800]  documents Pentagon documents operation Northwood's army field manuals they're
[03:03.800 --> 03:08.000]  all declassified explaining why the government stages terror attacks or
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.920]  provocateurs attacks or funds criminal groups to carry out attacks and then
[03:12.920 --> 03:19.840]  burns a patsy or two there's different variants of this a real terror attack not
[03:19.840 --> 03:25.720]  funded by the people being attacked is extremely rare they do exist though you
[03:25.720 --> 03:32.920]  could count them on one hand that we know of because whoever's being attacked
[03:33.320 --> 03:37.520]  gets to play the part of the victim and gets to strike back out so how do you
[03:37.520 --> 03:44.000]  start preemptive wars you have a self-inflicted wound how many college
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.880]  students have been caught painting swastikas on their dorms or sending
[03:48.880 --> 03:54.440]  inward emails to themselves how many synagogues have been caught painting
[03:54.440 --> 03:59.480]  swastikas on their buildings to get sympathy and funding in every case that
[03:59.480 --> 04:02.680]  we know of this is what's happening this is what's developing this is what's
[04:02.680 --> 04:10.520]  unfolding that's another form of false flag terror attack so we're going to
[04:10.520 --> 04:16.640]  break that down today and a bunch of other big issues coming up after this
[04:16.640 --> 04:20.840]  break but I'm gonna get into Van Jones why he really had to resign they're just

[07:14.160 --> 07:18.800]  especially on March 5th did four hours on my weekday show saying they're gonna
[07:18.800 --> 07:22.600]  stage some type of flu event I had emergency managers on the show
[07:22.600 --> 07:26.880]  journalists on the show I mean we had the intel we told you that in April we
[07:26.880 --> 07:30.760]  were really at level six four months later the media admitted okay we were
[07:30.760 --> 07:35.960]  really at level six already under you in control so so you need to listen to
[07:35.960 --> 07:40.760]  us when we break this down the information we're about to cover we know
[07:40.760 --> 07:45.920]  what we're talking about this is directly from the World Health Organization
[07:45.920 --> 07:52.700]  hidden in plain view this came out Friday evening this came out in plain
[07:52.700 --> 07:56.640]  view and this is even being mentioned in the mainstream media but as minor foot
[07:56.640 --> 08:03.400]  notes like it's no big deal now if you're a present planet dot TV member we
[08:03.400 --> 08:09.080]  also saw will cast the radio show as a TV show and if you're not a prison
[08:09.080 --> 08:12.320]  planet dot TV member and don't watch the show live don't worry it always gets
[08:12.320 --> 08:15.840]  ripped to the forewinds all over the internet which we love don't want to
[08:15.840 --> 08:19.280]  thank all the folks out there doing that but especially the prison planet dot TV
[08:19.280 --> 08:23.160]  members because it's one thing for people to hear this on the radio and not go to
[08:23.160 --> 08:27.440]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot com where we post everything we talk
[08:27.440 --> 08:31.080]  about on the radio show every day so you can read along with us even if you're
[08:31.080 --> 08:34.040]  not a prison planet dot TV viewer you can go to the site and read all these
[08:34.040 --> 08:39.720]  documents but for people watching they get to see the documents so here is the
[08:39.720 --> 08:45.120]  World Health Organization document right here ladies and gentlemen and we're
[08:45.120 --> 08:51.680]  going to be going over this it is safety of pandemic vaccines pandemic h1n1
[08:51.680 --> 09:10.000]  2009 briefing note 6 and this came out way back August 6 it took us about 27 28
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.320]  days to find this again and its listeners that pointed this out it's
[09:14.320 --> 09:17.800]  people that found this information just like in the health care bill there's an
[09:17.800 --> 09:22.640]  implantable microchip section Jason Burman showed me that two weeks ago in
[09:22.640 --> 09:25.640]  the office and I kind of rolled my eyes and forgot about it and then its
[09:25.640 --> 09:30.960]  mainstream ABC news last week the point is don't think we're noticing and seeing
[09:30.960 --> 09:35.360]  all this it's you giving us the tips that allow us to ferret this out what am I
[09:35.360 --> 09:42.200]  talking about what is this new United Nations document who admits to releasing
[09:42.200 --> 09:48.720]  pandemic viruses into population via mock-up viruses now remember back in
[09:48.720 --> 09:57.440]  April having different medical doctors on 10 penny and a bunch of other people
[09:57.440 --> 10:01.480]  quite frankly I can't remember which one it was that said it but they said
[10:01.480 --> 10:07.760]  there's a good chance was it Steve quail I forget that this is a simulant weakened
[10:07.760 --> 10:12.440]  virus they've released and that they're tracking the spread of it and that the
[10:12.440 --> 10:20.400]  government is doing this to quote give people an immunity to a weaponized swine
[10:20.400 --> 10:24.360]  flew down the road that was kind of the angle being put out by people that were
[10:24.360 --> 10:31.400]  trying to be devil's advocate because clearly this is the key the flu virus
[10:31.400 --> 10:38.120]  the H1N1 part human part pig part bird was clearly manufactured in a lab I mean
[10:38.120 --> 10:42.560]  that's been admitted in the BBC and Reuters and top virologists are on record
[10:42.560 --> 10:46.720]  so then why were they hyping it up and freaking out like it was the end of the
[10:46.720 --> 10:50.800]  world in April why they've been making secret preparations in January and
[10:50.800 --> 10:56.160]  February for mass graves crematoriums martial law homeland security brigade
[10:56.160 --> 11:02.000]  homeland now they want 400,000 troops on the streets of America the Hill newspaper
[11:02.000 --> 11:08.360]  and the progressive are both reporting fact here's that article on the 400,000
[11:08.360 --> 11:12.720]  troops got that for people Pentagon wants authority to post almost 400,000
[11:12.720 --> 11:17.840]  military personnel in the US that's the from the progressive what why did we see
[11:17.840 --> 11:21.240]  all this big preparation for something that hadn't even showed up yet then
[11:21.240 --> 11:25.880]  exactly what they said was going to show up shows up the virologist look at it
[11:25.880 --> 11:31.360]  under electron microscopes and say this was made in a lab but then we notice it's
[11:31.360 --> 11:36.360]  not killing that many people and then people folks noticed in the patents
[11:36.360 --> 11:44.080]  issued by several big vaccine makers they mentioned virus simulants or weakened
[11:44.080 --> 11:51.360]  viruses and then now the who is saying these were released and they just make
[11:51.360 --> 11:55.160]  this announcement like they're talking about the price of gasoline or the price
[11:55.160 --> 12:01.160]  of milk or the price of you know natural gas I mean they're just announcing it
[12:01.160 --> 12:07.880]  real calmly like it's some boring stat when this is a huge development we know
[12:07.880 --> 12:11.880]  this was manufactured so if it starts killing a bunch of people or the
[12:11.880 --> 12:17.320]  vaccine starts killing a bunch of people this is an inside job now we don't know
[12:17.320 --> 12:21.600]  we don't know this is a cover for the federalization internationalization and
[12:21.600 --> 12:26.040]  the UN directing all the nations of the planet a big beta test for world
[12:26.040 --> 12:29.440]  government I mean the UN admits they're using it for that and say it's a great
[12:29.440 --> 12:33.120]  day for globalization and global governance but the question is does it
[12:33.120 --> 12:38.480]  stop there I don't know you can't look into the future and tell exactly what's
[12:38.480 --> 12:45.840]  going to happen I mean it's bad enough they're making tens of billions off
[12:45.840 --> 12:48.760]  these vaccines it's bad enough it has mercury in it they're admitting it does
[12:48.760 --> 12:53.880]  it's bad enough that it has the accelerants the chemicals in it that
[12:53.880 --> 12:58.480]  cause an autoimmune response that are triggering diabetes brain damage autism
[12:58.480 --> 13:04.560]  I had a brain surgeon top neurologist on for an hour and 45 minutes Friday Dr.
[13:04.560 --> 13:10.880]  Blalock breaking down I mean the medical literature the terms were discovered
[13:10.880 --> 13:17.760]  by him in the last 20 years I mean this is like the brainiac that all of the you
[13:17.760 --> 13:25.080]  know brain experts and the experts on Alzheimer's being a chronic inflammation
[13:25.080 --> 13:29.080]  of the brain they know it's MSG they know it's aspartame they know it's the
[13:29.080 --> 13:31.960]  mercury in the shots and they know that once you take enough of this stuff
[13:31.960 --> 13:35.680]  that's it you're gonna have brain and I mean that's why these Alzheimer patients
[13:35.680 --> 13:39.800]  fade in and out it's the inflammation but look and the government's not going
[13:39.800 --> 13:43.440]  to tell you this folks they did it to you it's a chemical weapon a cocktail of
[13:43.440 --> 13:51.240]  chemical weapons regardless I'm digressing we know that it's a stage
[13:51.240 --> 13:58.960]  vaccine we know all the fear mongering is staged and then I've got AOL news AP
[13:58.960 --> 14:05.320]  swine flu seconds 2000 at one University alone ladies and gentlemen this came

[14:18.200 --> 14:30.200]  you've got more than 1% 1 out of 10 2000 at 18,500 is more than more than 1
[14:30.200 --> 14:36.840]  out of 10 or more than 10% with it this is gonna be a massive flu season and we
[14:36.840 --> 14:42.760]  know it's manufactured that's not debated now what to make of this I don't
[14:42.760 --> 14:46.280]  know I mean we're looking at the pieces but there's only a few more pieces to
[14:46.280 --> 14:53.440]  put in place here and it didn't look in good so let me just go over this for you

[20:18.960 --> 20:24.600]  over 36,000 Americans die every year from the regular run-of-the-mill flu out
[20:24.600 --> 20:32.240]  of nowhere comes this engineered super flu doesn't have super bad kill rates
[20:32.240 --> 20:38.240]  it just spreads super fast and they say it could potentially mutate into the
[20:38.240 --> 20:44.280]  mega death I mean if 40 million were killed by the 1918 Spanish flu different
[20:44.280 --> 20:48.200]  headlines say this could kill hundreds of millions even billions I don't know
[20:48.200 --> 20:53.840]  if that's true all we know is the World Health Organization just calmly out in
[20:53.840 --> 20:59.080]  the open admits that governments are releasing flu viruses on purpose now
[20:59.080 --> 21:04.840]  remember what happened in trials in Europe just this year a whole bunch of
[21:04.840 --> 21:08.840]  homeless people were killed in flu trials and people have gone to jail for
[21:08.840 --> 21:13.160]  that but not the pharmaceutical companies that hired city officials to
[21:13.160 --> 21:17.360]  administer it to homeless in fact let's just do that for people watching and
[21:17.360 --> 21:22.320]  listening in case they doubt just search engine homeless die in flu trials and they
[21:22.320 --> 21:26.320]  gave it to a hundred at one clinic and 23 died we'll show you that headline
[21:26.320 --> 21:34.160]  London Telegraph BBC AP you name it now then Baxter Pharmaceutical mixes
[21:34.160 --> 21:39.120]  weaponized bird flu that has a 90 plus percent kill rate in humans with
[21:39.120 --> 21:44.800]  vaccines by the grace of God a vaccine distributor test it finds it when it was
[21:44.800 --> 21:50.600]  still in the larger vaccine preparations hadn't been put into single
[21:50.600 --> 21:56.640]  use vials yet now you add that now with all this talk of martial law and the
[21:56.640 --> 22:01.320]  government saying get ready for martial law and flu's coming and it's going to
[22:01.320 --> 22:05.960]  be this big crisis and suddenly you have congressman Brown and congressman
[22:05.960 --> 22:10.360]  Paul and former Republican leader Dick army is in the Dallas morning you news
[22:10.360 --> 22:16.440]  two weeks ago saying they may use the flu as a controlled crisis a stage crisis
[22:16.440 --> 22:26.680]  to pass health care reform and then you have this Bloomberg today Obama may need
[22:26.680 --> 22:34.240]  sense of crisis to revive health care overhaul president Barack Obama returns
[22:34.240 --> 22:38.120]  to Washington next week in search of one thing that can revive his health care
[22:38.120 --> 22:43.040]  overhaul a sense of crisis and guess what that sense of crisis could be the
[22:43.040 --> 22:48.120]  flu facing polls showing a drop in his approval to manage support from
[22:48.120 --> 22:54.560]  independence factors within his own Democratic Party and factions and the
[22:54.560 --> 22:58.600]  United Republican opposition Obama must recapture the sense of urgency that
[22:58.600 --> 23:05.880]  led to the passage of the economic rescue package in February analyst said and
[23:05.880 --> 23:10.800]  they say what is that crisis going to be and then here's the big news from
[23:10.800 --> 23:15.000]  Markola dot com natural news dot com we have all these stories posted up at
[23:15.000 --> 23:21.360]  info wars dot com right now with direct links to the world health organization
[23:21.360 --> 23:26.080]  that's the United Nations that's the private corporate holding company that
[23:26.080 --> 23:31.000]  is carrying out the eugenics medical tyranny who admits to releasing pandemic
[23:31.000 --> 23:36.600]  virus into population via mock-up vaccines the document on the website link
[23:36.600 --> 23:41.200]  below states that it is common procedure to release pandemic viruses into the
[23:41.200 --> 23:45.920]  population in order to get a jump ahead of the real pandemic so as to fast track
[23:45.920 --> 23:51.920]  the vaccine for when it is needed and Europe some manufacturers have conducted
[23:51.920 --> 23:56.800]  advanced studies using so-called mock-up vaccine mock-up vaccines contain an
[23:56.800 --> 24:01.520]  active ingredient for an influenza virus that is not circulated recently in
[24:01.520 --> 24:07.320]  human populations and thus mimics the novelty of the pandemic virus and right
[24:07.320 --> 24:11.080]  before all this broke out in Mexico City they were doing these inoculation
[24:11.080 --> 24:15.440]  trials according to the World Health Organization such advanced studies can
[24:15.440 --> 24:20.360]  greatly expedite regulatory approval sources said and I remember having
[24:20.360 --> 24:25.200]  guessed on who went to the nor vitus effect it was Dr. Lynn Horowitz was the
[24:25.200 --> 24:29.920]  main one and went and showed Baxter and a couple other companies and he he
[24:29.920 --> 24:35.880]  mentioned their own patents in 97 98 99 where they were talking about releasing
[24:35.880 --> 24:41.800]  simulants and he went wild on air he was one of the guests saying these may be
[24:41.800 --> 24:45.800]  simulants already released because their documents said it well now here's the
[24:45.800 --> 24:49.600]  who's saying it's been done so there needs to be an investigation who did
[24:49.600 --> 24:54.200]  this did it cause the deaths what's in the vaccine I mean folks this is
[24:54.200 --> 25:00.520]  staring you in the face and our to talk show hosts last night Kenny Romar was
[25:00.520 --> 25:06.720]  listening to a show mentioned that he was watching one of those I think was who
[25:06.720 --> 25:09.520]  wants to be a millionaire whatever where the person calls in you have the
[25:09.520 --> 25:14.800]  lifelines and they asked the people how many US senators are there and no one
[25:14.800 --> 25:18.400]  can answer it and then the person called their lifeline and they didn't know that
[25:18.400 --> 25:24.480]  queue up miss South Carolina for me folks miss South Carolina is what the
[25:24.480 --> 25:29.760]  general public's like listen you better get as informed about the history of
[25:29.760 --> 25:33.720]  biological weapons and governments releasing them on people you better get
[25:33.720 --> 25:38.920]  as informed about eugenics and eugenical systems as you are about applying
[25:38.920 --> 25:44.160]  makeup or are acting tough or going to the gym or driving a big truck with big
[25:44.160 --> 25:48.880]  tires I don't care if you wear cowboy hats have big tires have tattoos I don't
[25:48.880 --> 25:52.480]  care I don't care if you're a yuppie who wears sweaters tied you know in a knot
[25:52.480 --> 25:56.560]  around their neck I don't care what I care about is that your experts in all
[25:56.560 --> 26:01.160]  of that but not experts in the real world the host made a good point I mean
[26:01.160 --> 26:05.360]  what has become of this country most people don't know the three branches of
[26:05.360 --> 26:10.520]  government nothing they don't understand that the Pentagon admits and Dick
[26:10.520 --> 26:14.560]  Cheney wrote even the Austin American statesman decried this to their credit
[26:14.560 --> 26:20.360]  in 2001 that he wanted to release race specific bio weapons you know what a
[26:20.360 --> 26:25.360]  race specific bio weapon is it's more important than your hair falling out
[26:25.360 --> 26:29.800]  it's more important than the UT Longhorns one last night and what Matt
[26:29.800 --> 26:34.880]  Brown says and I'm not saying it isn't important to care about Matt Brown and
[26:34.880 --> 26:38.760]  the Longhorns fine you're supposed to have a good time in life sometimes but
[26:38.760 --> 26:44.160]  you're supposed to also know that foreign banks stole 23.7 trillion and
[26:44.160 --> 26:48.000]  want to fully bankrupt the country and want an excuse to bring in martial law
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.280]  and they may do it with this flu situation unless we get the word out and
[26:52.280 --> 26:58.440]  warn them play miss South Carolina here is this moron recent polls have shown a
[26:58.440 --> 27:05.240]  fifth of Americans can't locate the US on a world map why do you think this is
[27:05.240 --> 27:14.600]  I personally believe that US Americans are unable to do so because some people
[27:14.600 --> 27:20.320]  out there in our nation don't have that and I believe that our education like
[27:20.320 --> 27:26.600]  such as in South Africa and Iraq everywhere like such as and I believe
[27:26.600 --> 27:33.000]  that they should our education over here in the US should help the US or should
[27:33.000 --> 27:38.280]  help South Africa it should help that I recommend Asian countries so we will be
[27:38.280 --> 27:44.760]  able to build up our future for our job thank you very much South Carolina just
[27:44.760 --> 27:49.760]  and you watch those shows maybe 60% of those women are just like that they
[27:49.760 --> 27:54.160]  don't know what planet they're on they're all obsessed with their lips and
[27:54.160 --> 27:58.240]  their skin instead of walking out at night and going I mean last night I
[27:58.240 --> 28:02.160]  walked outside at 9 o'clock outside the studio giant red moon right on the
[28:02.160 --> 28:06.560]  horizon I was just stunned by the beauty of the universe and the clouds and
[28:06.560 --> 28:11.840]  and and just everything and meanwhile most people are looking down on the dirt
[28:11.840 --> 28:15.840]  they're insecure Madison Avenue's made them feel like they're worthless they
[28:15.840 --> 28:20.520]  don't know anything about the real world the the beauty of the world much less

[34:20.120 --> 34:25.360]  viruses now let's move on just kind of like oh yeah Charles Manson's gonna be
[34:25.360 --> 34:29.920]  over for dinner tonight it's no big deal let's just move on here or kind of like
[34:29.920 --> 34:33.640]  you know your dad comes over and says I killed 25 people they're buried in the
[34:33.640 --> 34:38.880]  basement I'm a serial killer you know and then no one acts like it's any big
[34:38.880 --> 34:44.640]  deal just oh government released it oh they're having flu trials in Europe and
[34:44.640 --> 34:48.640]  it's killing a bunch of people but the vaccines oh I just showed you the
[34:48.640 --> 34:53.520]  headlines oh there's all these internal government reports about how it's in the
[34:53.520 --> 34:57.560]  past and currently linked to Gillian Bernays disease and all these other
[34:57.560 --> 35:05.640]  neurological disorders so let me put it in boiled down layman terms for miss
[35:05.640 --> 35:13.880]  South Carolina okay three major vaccine makers that just so happened to get the
[35:13.880 --> 35:21.240]  government contracts the last two months put patents in for the exact strain
[35:21.240 --> 35:28.280]  and mutation of the H1N1 that we're currently seeing and in their own
[35:28.280 --> 35:34.960]  filings and in the World Health Organization's own filings
[35:34.960 --> 35:43.320]  simulant viruses manufactured viruses that can still kill you but are quote
[35:43.320 --> 35:47.920]  weaker they say have been released and they say because they've already
[35:47.920 --> 35:52.400]  released it it allows them to get quicker approval for the vaccine so they
[35:52.400 --> 35:55.840]  had these viruses they've been messing with them engineering them all these
[35:55.840 --> 36:00.040]  years and the rationale from the different and here's the problem I had
[36:00.040 --> 36:04.600]  Dr. Horowitz Dr. Tenpenny a whole bunch of doctors medical doctors and others
[36:04.600 --> 36:07.640]  here and I'm trying to remember because I remember you know we're all learning
[36:07.640 --> 36:11.840]  together back during April and all this was going on I'm going excuse me and
[36:11.840 --> 36:15.040]  they're going yeah look at this document and this patent filing this
[36:15.040 --> 36:19.560]  company says that they're preparing to release simulant viruses and look at
[36:19.560 --> 36:23.240]  this UN document and just now is this getting attention see I don't have all
[36:23.240 --> 36:34.320]  the answers because it's so big hidden in plain view it's so outrageous that
[36:34.320 --> 36:40.000]  I don't even know how to deal with this so let's get Dr. Marcol on let's get
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.640]  Dr. Horowitz on next week let's get Tim Penny Dr. Tenpenny on and then let me
[36:45.640 --> 36:49.240]  go back into my files out there from April because I remember talking to a
[36:49.240 --> 36:52.160]  physician at the state level who gave us that secret document that we were
[36:52.160 --> 36:55.280]  really at level six and everybody laughed at me and then months later they
[36:55.280 --> 36:59.080]  go oh we were level six back then we have the document had names of the state
[36:59.080 --> 37:03.000]  and federal doctors and their phone numbers people just like I broke the
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.720]  Mayak report in the DHS report saying veterans and gun owners were the number
[37:06.720 --> 37:15.920]  one terrorist and Homeland Security was set up for us I mean I can't help it
[37:15.920 --> 37:19.720]  that we break so much here we broke the secret FBI training video last week
[37:19.720 --> 37:27.360]  where they're saying all Americans are basically terrorist that's a real FBI
[37:27.360 --> 37:35.960]  training video I mean but but that's why they've got a leg up on us is because
[37:35.960 --> 37:40.960]  this is so outrageous and just so in your face it's like dad coming home when
[37:40.960 --> 37:44.080]  you're a kid sitting out at the intertable and going oh I got three dead
[37:44.080 --> 37:46.960]  bodies out in the trunk in the car come on out home to get them out you know
[37:46.960 --> 37:53.560]  you're just not registering it you know it it's it it's so over the top
[37:53.560 --> 37:58.960]  dr. muck dr. more cola writes on June 11th the World Health Organization raised
[37:58.960 --> 38:03.480]  its swine flu pandemic from five to six was really raised in April phase six is
[38:03.480 --> 38:06.080]  the highest level alert reflects the speed with which the virus is
[38:06.080 --> 38:10.120]  spreading not at severity this classification also allows for vaccine
[38:10.120 --> 38:14.520]  quantity for fast-track procedure for licensing and approval and the process
[38:14.520 --> 38:19.360]  is now ongoing for the swine flu vaccine what you may not know however is at
[38:19.360 --> 38:22.920]  the hood together with health officials regulatory authorities and vaccine
[38:22.920 --> 38:28.040]  manufacturers yes a revolving door at the who with the executives of the vaccine
[38:28.040 --> 38:32.680]  companies have been working since 2007 long before this new threat of the
[38:32.680 --> 38:36.000]  swine flu emerge to explore a broad range of issues surrounding the
[38:36.000 --> 38:41.360]  regulatory approval for pandemic vaccines according to the website ways
[38:41.360 --> 38:45.240]  were sought to shorten time between the emergence of a pandemic virus and
[38:45.240 --> 38:49.000]  availability of safe effective vaccines and that's what they say in these
[38:49.000 --> 38:54.640]  filings oh we'll release the H1N1 but weaker in case it ever really got out
[38:54.640 --> 38:59.600]  this is a virus they made so that if it ever does come out we'll have a vaccine
[38:59.600 --> 39:04.840]  ready and we can study how it mutates in people this is kind of like we're gonna
[39:04.840 --> 39:10.240]  go ahead set fire to your house just to do a test and see if it ever gets caught
[39:10.240 --> 39:17.360]  on fire how to deal with it and then even if you buy into this sick logic where
[39:17.360 --> 39:21.880]  the whole world's a test tube and these mad eugenics scientists are playing
[39:21.880 --> 39:26.120]  games with our lives why is it this a bigger issue why is it just hidden in
[39:26.120 --> 39:30.320]  plain view in the filings with the vaccine makers it's kind of like the
[39:30.320 --> 39:34.080]  government admits mass graves mass quarantines forced inoculation
[39:34.080 --> 39:37.960]  preparations every day we post different states federal government other
[39:37.960 --> 39:42.320]  governments admissions but it's hardly ever in the news and people send me
[39:42.320 --> 39:47.480]  emails saying are you making this up yes it's real no we're not making it up
[39:47.480 --> 39:52.160]  yes we documented all does that mean they're going to a real pandemic they've
[39:52.160 --> 39:55.820]  already declared one does that mean millions are gonna die I don't know
[39:55.820 --> 40:00.800]  these people are capable of anything and let me tell you something if you and
[40:00.800 --> 40:06.920]  your wife and children get a weaponized flu and you die in a matter of hours
[40:06.920 --> 40:12.440]  from the hemorrhagic autoimmune response where your lungs fill with water within
[40:12.440 --> 40:17.560]  a matter of minutes you have an autoimmune response and you're dying or
[40:17.560 --> 40:23.840]  your child is dead this is not a game this is more important than your local
[40:23.840 --> 40:29.120]  college football team this is more important than getting your hair done
[40:29.120 --> 40:34.640]  this is more important than your yard being green and not having dead spots
[40:34.640 --> 40:41.760]  this I mean all I'm asking people is get informed I mean you don't have to
[40:41.760 --> 40:45.600]  believe my interpretation of things you don't have to buy into what I'm saying
[40:45.600 --> 40:52.000]  you don't have to believe my views just for heaven's sakes when I get up here and
[40:52.000 --> 40:58.440]  I show you and read the headline on air World Health Organization briefing note
[40:58.440 --> 41:06.840]  6 August 6 2009 where they admit they're releasing viruses to mimic the one
[41:06.840 --> 41:11.520]  that's now out and then scientists look at the current H1N1 and clearly say
[41:11.520 --> 41:15.920]  it's manufactured this is a serious crime but you're not gonna get
[41:15.920 --> 41:21.000]  investigations from the FBI and why because that's controlled from the top
[41:21.000 --> 41:26.040]  by these eugenicists and I want to ask FBI agents I mean is it fun when your dad
[41:26.040 --> 41:30.200]  dies of Lou Gehrig's from the vaccines is it fun when you get Alzheimer's when
[41:30.200 --> 41:34.000]  you're 45 now all these young people getting it is it fun that your daughter
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.080]  takes the HPV shot Gardasil and and and has autoimmune response and gets
[41:38.080 --> 41:42.720]  sterilized I mean don't believe me just Google Gardasil deaths here do it right
[41:42.720 --> 41:46.520]  now for us on screen again we're simulcasting at prison planet TV the
[41:46.520 --> 41:53.200]  radio show in living color I mean you know this has to be addressed I'm not
[41:53.200 --> 41:57.000]  here calling for revolution I'm not here calling for confrontation the
[41:57.000 --> 42:01.440]  military the police the FBI all of us are being treaded on whether you're an
[42:01.440 --> 42:05.680]  auto mechanic a radio talk show host a doctor a lawyer I mean you know don't
[42:05.680 --> 42:10.640]  tread on us stop it stop putting sodium fluoride and hundreds of other
[42:10.640 --> 42:15.160]  chemicals in the water I got a tour of the Austin water treatment plant they
[42:15.160 --> 42:18.960]  admitted they put hundreds of chemicals in the water and the people there said
[42:18.960 --> 42:26.640]  we don't like it I mean you know I mean ladies and gentlemen death toll link to
[42:26.640 --> 42:31.560]  Gardasil vaccine rises complications include shock foaming at mouth

[46:52.960 --> 47:01.120]  at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633
[47:16.640 --> 47:22.600]  as I said the media is reporting about quarantines all over the country with
[47:22.600 --> 47:28.640]  universities where the government has control they're beta testing and showing
[47:28.640 --> 47:31.960]  the public how the lockdowns are going to happen how the inoculations are going
[47:31.960 --> 47:43.560]  to happen they're creating the fear the panic for the vaccine that was patented
[47:43.560 --> 47:49.200]  in 2007 and 2008 by different companies the exact same genetic code and then
[47:49.200 --> 47:53.240]  the virologist look at the vaccine and say this was engineered we can all put
[47:53.240 --> 47:58.920]  two plus two together now is this a staged event just to sell vaccine or is
[47:58.920 --> 48:03.000]  there something in the vaccine or do they know this virus in the human body
[48:03.000 --> 48:08.640]  or the vaccine itself is going to cause mutations do they know it's going to
[48:08.640 --> 48:11.320]  turn into something hyper deadly because when you read the White House
[48:11.320 --> 48:17.680]  science are and George Bush seniors advisor Ehrlichman writing textbooks
[48:17.680 --> 48:22.440]  praising eugenics and saying we need a deadly flu deadly Ebola to wipe out most
[48:22.440 --> 48:28.720]  the earth and then you know the history of chemical biological radiological
[48:28.720 --> 48:35.640]  testing on the people of the world and then now this whole police state grid is
[48:35.640 --> 48:40.440]  in place it really makes you have a lot of concern so we'll continue to cover
[48:40.440 --> 48:51.280]  that throughout the week okay let me get into free speech now this Oakland
[48:51.280 --> 48:57.600]  admitted hardcore Maoist communist I mean he admits he's a communist we played
[48:57.600 --> 48:59.800]  those clips last week we're going to play some more coming up here in a
[48:59.800 --> 49:06.720]  moment van jones why would have did administration that got four times the
[49:06.720 --> 49:12.360]  money from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase than John McCain again I'm not
[49:12.360 --> 49:16.520]  saying I was for John McCain John McCain was even in the running it was always
[49:16.520 --> 49:21.640]  about Obama that's why would the ultra rich put Obama in power and then he
[49:21.640 --> 49:27.040]  brings in masses of on the record communist
[49:27.040 --> 49:41.760]  then and why why do we even call that leftist big money always wants fascism
[49:41.760 --> 49:46.200]  communism socialism they want command and control they want to centralize
[49:46.200 --> 49:50.080]  power no matter if you're a communist or socialist or fascist country there's
[49:50.080 --> 49:56.040]  police in black ski masks black uniforms spies cameras tattletale groups the
[49:56.040 --> 50:00.720]  president is on big telescreens and movie theater screens announcing to the
[50:00.720 --> 50:05.720]  youth the the president or the dictator the furor always reaches out to the
[50:05.720 --> 50:10.520]  youth see the establishment gives you all these fake choices of command and
[50:10.520 --> 50:15.440]  control fascist communist socialist but it always ends in the same thing and then
[50:15.440 --> 50:21.280]  van jones it came out called republicans scum and all these cuss words he
[50:21.280 --> 50:25.920]  called for total wealth redistribution he called for boycotts and shutting down
[50:25.920 --> 50:32.920]  talk radio so that made him an enemy of the mainline conservatives and he was
[50:32.920 --> 50:40.640]  already going to be discarded then it came out that van jones in fact we'll
[50:40.640 --> 50:45.560]  punch up a picture of him on screen for everybody watching then it came out that
[50:45.560 --> 50:55.120]  van jones was a 9-11 truth and we've now confirmed in 2002 he took part in a
[50:55.120 --> 51:00.400]  march we've confirmed in 2004 he signed the petition and that's the only good
[51:00.400 --> 51:04.520]  thing to his credit but see you notice though he didn't do that once he became
[51:04.520 --> 51:09.880]  a czar with incredible power over green jobs and the takeover of our economy you
[51:09.880 --> 51:15.720]  notice once he got into position of power van jones shut up about it and he
[51:15.720 --> 51:21.960]  denied 9-11 truth once he got put under pressure for it because he was only
[51:21.960 --> 51:26.840]  doing it for political control and power that's what these poverty pimps do is
[51:26.840 --> 51:33.840]  they go and join every group 9-11 truth is not a left-winger right-wing issue I
[51:33.840 --> 51:43.440]  want to read to everybody out there what the 9-11 Commission said bipartisan and
[51:43.440 --> 51:50.760]  appointed by bush and we have this article posted up on info wars.com it's
[51:50.760 --> 52:03.040]  highly credible people. Normally I'd show this on TV but it's got an email up
[52:03.040 --> 52:13.720]  in the corner I don't want to put on TV. 9-11 Commissioners the co-chairs the
[52:13.720 --> 52:18.880]  9-11 Commission Thomas Keane and Lee Hamilton said that the CIA and lightly
[52:18.880 --> 52:22.480]  the White House obstructed our investigation the co-chairs the 9-11
[52:22.480 --> 52:26.800]  Commission also said the 9-11 Commissioners knew that the military
[52:26.800 --> 52:31.000]  officials misrepresented the facts of the Commission and the Commission
[52:31.000 --> 52:36.880]  considered recommending criminal charges for such false statements yet didn't
[52:36.880 --> 52:44.400]  bother to tell the American people. Indeed the co-chairs the Commission now
[52:44.400 --> 52:48.080]  admit that the Commission largely operated based on political
[52:48.080 --> 52:52.440]  considerations there's links to mainstream news on all of this this is
[52:52.440 --> 52:57.920]  Washington Post 9-11 Commission co-chair Lee Hamilton says I don't believe for a
[52:57.920 --> 53:02.480]  minute we got everything right that the Commission was set up to fail that
[53:02.480 --> 53:06.200]  people should keep asking questions about 9-11 the 9-11 debate should
[53:06.200 --> 53:12.640]  continue the 9-11 Commission report was only the first draft of history 9-11
[53:12.640 --> 53:17.080]  Commissioner Bob Kerry said that there are sample or an ample reasons to
[53:17.080 --> 53:23.560]  suspect that there may be some administrative and some alternative to
[53:23.560 --> 53:28.920]  what we outlined in our version we didn't have access to 9-11 Commissioner
[53:28.920 --> 53:34.360]  Timmy Timothy Romer said we were extremely frustrated with the false
[53:34.360 --> 53:39.480]  statements we were getting former 9-11 Commissioner Max Cleland resigned from
[53:39.480 --> 53:43.720]  the Commission stating it is a national scandal the investigation is now
[53:43.720 --> 53:48.580]  compromised and one of these days we will have to get a full story because the
[53:48.580 --> 53:52.900]  9-11 issue is so important to America that the White House wants to cover it
[53:52.900 --> 53:58.840]  up 9-11 Commissioner John Lehman said we purposely put together a staff that
[53:58.840 --> 54:04.560]  had in a way conflicts of interest the senior counsel the 9-11 Commission John
[54:04.560 --> 54:09.400]  Farmer who led the 9-11 staff inquiry said I was shocked at how different the
[54:09.400 --> 54:14.040]  truth was from the way it was described the tapes told a radically
[54:14.040 --> 54:20.880]  different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years this
[54:20.880 --> 54:30.160]  is not spin what we were told is not true so I babbled through those but the
[54:30.160 --> 54:34.880]  point is the 9-11 Commission said this was a complete fraud and a lie and what
[54:34.880 --> 54:40.000]  happened on 9-11 was a lie we have declassified government documents like
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.520]  Operation Northwoods that ABC News and Baltimore Sun reported on where the US
[54:44.520 --> 54:48.440]  government planned to bomb US cities to blame it on foreign enemies the Pentagon
[54:48.440 --> 54:53.880]  has declassified that they staged all sorts of attacks Gulf of Tonkin USS
[54:53.880 --> 54:59.800]  Liberty to get us into wars or to try to get us into wars so to say that no one
[54:59.800 --> 55:03.600]  should investigate this and no one should ask questions well why doesn't the
[55:03.600 --> 55:08.680]  media attack the 9-11 Commission members they don't they just lie and say that
[55:08.680 --> 55:12.280]  the Commission members are in total agreement on the official story we're
[55:12.280 --> 55:16.600]  gonna play a clip of that from National Geographic's latest propaganda
[55:16.600 --> 55:21.840]  brainwashing piece coming up in the next hour of Richard Gage but here is van
[55:21.840 --> 55:27.520]  Jones the green jobs coordinator engaging in the Higalian dialectic not
[55:27.520 --> 55:32.800]  just a problem-reaction solution but he talks about things like integration
[55:32.800 --> 55:38.440]  not discriminating blacks having rights you agree with that then he drops in
[55:38.440 --> 55:44.480]  the middle total redistribution of all wealth going farther than linen and
[55:44.480 --> 55:53.000]  Mao and Stalin okay you understand so notice you sigh up here then he goes on
[55:53.000 --> 55:57.920]  to say the green system is a total revolution to take over the American
[55:57.920 --> 56:01.960]  society and that's what it is only select corporations and businesses are
[56:01.960 --> 56:05.400]  gonna be able to operate they admit under the green bill that's past the
[56:05.400 --> 56:08.640]  House not the Senate yet the global warming bill that they can regulate
[56:08.640 --> 56:13.200]  selectively whatever they want that 35 agencies are given unlimited power this
[56:13.200 --> 56:17.480]  is a mafia takeover let's start playing the van Jones clip one of the things that
[56:17.480 --> 56:21.960]  has happened I think too often to progressives is that we don't understand
[56:21.960 --> 56:27.880]  the relationship between minimum goals and maximum goals right after Rosa
[56:27.880 --> 56:32.600]  Parks refused to give up her seat if the civil rights leaders had jumped out and
[56:32.600 --> 56:38.800]  said okay now we want reparations for slavery we want redistribution of all
[56:38.800 --> 56:42.640]  wealth and we want to legalize mixed marriages that have been there they come
[56:42.640 --> 56:47.680]  out with a maximum program the very next day they'd have been last day instead
[56:47.680 --> 56:50.800]  they came out with a very minimum program you know we just want to integrate
[56:50.800 --> 56:54.600]  these buses the students a few years later come out with a very minimum
[56:54.600 --> 56:59.640]  program we just want to sit at the lunch counter but inside that minimum
[56:59.640 --> 57:07.360]  demand was a very radical kernel that eventually meant that from 1954 1968
[57:07.360 --> 57:12.200]  you know complete revolution was on the table for this country and I think that
[57:12.200 --> 57:15.720]  this green movement has pursued those same steps and stages right now we're
[57:15.720 --> 57:21.200]  saying we want to move from suicidal gray capitalism to some kind of eco
[57:21.200 --> 57:26.680]  capitalism where you know at least we're not you know that tracking the
[57:26.680 --> 57:31.680]  destruction of the whole planet will that be enough no it won't be enough we
[57:31.680 --> 57:35.680]  want to go beyond existence of exploitation and oppression altogether
[57:35.680 --> 57:40.200]  but that's a process and I think what's great about the movement is beginning to
[57:40.200 --> 57:44.960]  emerge is that the crisis is so severe in terms of joblessness violence and now
[57:44.960 --> 57:51.080]  ecological folks next hour coming up we'll finish up with this the illusion
[57:51.080 --> 57:55.520]  created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to

[1:02:21.640 --> 1:02:28.320]  about releasing weaker versions of the virus into the atmosphere as a type of
[1:02:28.320 --> 1:02:33.640]  group herd immunity for our own good and then oh my gosh the actually mutates
[1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:37.560]  into something more deadly and they've got a vaccine for you and the World
[1:02:37.560 --> 1:02:41.800]  Health Organization is just admitting this calmly we've got to force this out
[1:02:41.800 --> 1:02:53.200]  and do the media as a major issue we've got to do this now this is of paramount
[1:02:53.200 --> 1:03:06.120]  paramount importance and so we're working on those stories as well and then
[1:03:06.120 --> 1:03:10.800]  there's other tidbits of important news like Obama regulations are advocated
[1:03:10.800 --> 1:03:16.040]  removing people's organs without explicit consent cyber news service and it's got
[1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:22.920]  his quotes ties into all the other eugenics Taliban bombs came from us
[1:03:22.920 --> 1:03:29.480]  non-Iran it's now admitted that the Sunnis in Iraq have been given bombs to
[1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:33.920]  bomb our own troops that's been declassified it's been declassified the
[1:03:33.920 --> 1:03:38.880]  Taliban al-Qaeda or funded continually up until 9 11 and after civil Edmunds
[1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:45.760]  what FBI translator running that the FBI that the CIA was running al-Qaeda up
[1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:53.680]  until 9 11 till the day now the Asia Times in support of the official United
[1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:58.080]  States assertion that Iran is aiming its swore and arming its sworn enemy the
[1:03:58.080 --> 1:04:02.400]  Taliban the head of the office of the director of national intelligence Dennis
[1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:06.000]  Blair has cited a statement by a Taliban commander last year attributing
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:10.880]  military success against North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces to Iranian
[1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:18.320]  military assistance when become a Muhammad Karzai the US puppet says no
[1:04:18.320 --> 1:04:24.360]  Iran is helping fight the Taliban that's the Sunni the opposite of the Shiite
[1:04:24.360 --> 1:04:29.440]  Iranian government but the Taliban commander's claim is contradicted by
[1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:33.040]  evidence from US Defense Department Canadian forces in Afghanistan the
[1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:37.280]  Taliban themselves at the increased damage to NATO tanks and Taliban forces
[1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:44.360]  has come from anti-tank missiles provided by the United States so see how is
[1:04:44.360 --> 1:04:50.080]  the United States people of control us going to stay in Afghanistan to get the
[1:04:50.080 --> 1:04:55.280]  500 billion a year in opium they're gonna kill our own troops as a pretext to
[1:04:55.280 --> 1:05:01.240]  stay there real simple they manufacture the terror this is Alex Jones with five
[1:05:01.240 --> 1:05:04.840]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer

[1:05:08.640 --> 1:05:13.040]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your

[1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:20.800]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[1:05:20.800 --> 1:05:24.640]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded especially
[1:05:24.640 --> 1:05:28.360]  with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane and dangerous
[1:05:28.360 --> 1:05:31.920]  summer storm season is here again every year thousands of families lose their
[1:05:31.920 --> 1:05:35.920]  power from weather related outages number five a solar power generator
[1:05:35.920 --> 1:05:39.800]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in
[1:05:39.800 --> 1:05:43.200]  the solar power generators offered by solutions from science a long-time

[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:06.800]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[1:06:06.800 --> 1:06:13.400]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:06:16.520 --> 1:06:21.560]  coming up in just a few minutes Richard Gage you don't know who he is you're
[1:06:21.560 --> 1:06:25.920]  about to find out big hit piece attacking him with this info and the
[1:06:25.920 --> 1:06:30.720]  entire 9-11 truth movement is airing every other day it seems preparing last
[1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:35.800]  week on the National Geographic Channel that's coming up in a moment but I
[1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:44.200]  wanted to get into this situation with the president two weeks ago his office
[1:06:44.200 --> 1:06:50.000]  of the Department of Education his educations are sent out federal mandate
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:54.720]  to schools taking any federal funds and we've shown the official letter head
[1:06:54.720 --> 1:06:59.880]  and read it in the White House doesn't deny that saying that if you take federal
[1:06:59.880 --> 1:07:06.480]  money you've got to make your school children watch this telecast of the
[1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:12.720]  president literally like 1984 on the big screen projector that we have an article
[1:07:12.720 --> 1:07:16.640]  up on prisonplanet.com Paul Watson wrote where it shows Obama as big brother we
[1:07:16.640 --> 1:07:19.960]  ought to it's over in the news and focus section if you want to go look at
[1:07:19.960 --> 1:07:23.280]  it on the right hand side of prisonplanet.com I mean this is right out of
[1:07:23.280 --> 1:07:28.520]  Nazi Germany Soviet Russia now then they remove those areas of the curriculum
[1:07:28.520 --> 1:07:32.320]  saying how you're going to help the president how you're going to write
[1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:36.280]  letters explaining how you're going to serve him creating this weird
[1:07:36.280 --> 1:07:41.920]  relationship with the president this hyper authority figure reaching out to
[1:07:41.920 --> 1:07:46.960]  your kids this isn't George Bush senior giving a 1991 speech saying stay off
[1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:56.120]  drugs stay in school then Obama shifts gears changes the story and says well
[1:07:56.120 --> 1:07:59.920]  we're not going to do that now and then a few days later they say we were never
[1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:03.520]  going to do it it's a conspiracy theory and now he's going to give a milk toast
[1:08:03.520 --> 1:08:09.520]  speech don't use drugs make good grades you can be successful but it this is the
[1:08:09.520 --> 1:08:14.120]  takeover of education I mean we played the clips last week I've been playing
[1:08:14.120 --> 1:08:17.320]  them every week for months I'm not going to play him again today you can search
[1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:21.880]  engine Barack Obama calls for national security force just as big just as strong
[1:08:21.880 --> 1:08:26.160]  as our military and then his White House chief of staff introduced the bill to
[1:08:26.160 --> 1:08:31.680]  make everybody from junior high to 65 serve in different brigades with weapons
[1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:37.160]  in uniforms domestically I mean you can't make this up in fact scroll down
[1:08:37.160 --> 1:08:40.440]  for folks that are watching on prisonplanet.tv it's indoctrination
[1:08:40.440 --> 1:08:45.160]  of Obama youth in schools accelerates is our article and in the article we
[1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:50.200]  have all the clips right there for everybody where you can watch the
[1:08:50.200 --> 1:08:55.920]  video clips of Barack Obama saying it and doing it everybody pledging to serve
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:08:59.680]  him and you know they mix it in with the civil rights movement it's all very
[1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:06.360]  deceptive and I was just playing Van Jones saying we're gonna have total
[1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:12.560]  wealth redistribution and see they're on screen or the youth in the uniforms
[1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:15.960]  training and chanting his name so that's what it is we're going to Richard
[1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:21.400]  Gates just a moment lastly go ahead and finish up Van Jones he didn't get kicked
[1:09:21.400 --> 1:09:24.920]  out for being a 9-11 truth or he got kicked out for saying I'm a communist
[1:09:24.920 --> 1:09:30.280]  the green jobs is to take over your life for total wealth redistribution here he
[1:09:30.280 --> 1:09:36.160]  is Van Jones we were gonna push it and push it and push it and so it
[1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:40.200]  becomes the engine for transforming the whole society my guest has been Van
[1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:45.480]  Jones president of green for in fact back up about a minute I want listeners
[1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:49.080]  because we end of the hour with that we're going right to Richard Gage I
[1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:53.360]  want listeners to hear this because he already says redistribution of wealth
[1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:57.880]  and then he says incremental takeover deception here it is
[1:09:57.880 --> 1:10:05.040]  Colonel that eventually meant that from 1954 1968 you know complete revolution
[1:10:05.040 --> 1:10:09.120]  was on the table for this country and I think that this green movement has to
[1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:13.800]  pursue those same steps and stages right now we're saying we want to move from
[1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:20.280]  suicidal gray capitalism to some kind of eco-capitalism where you know at least
[1:10:20.280 --> 1:10:24.800]  we're not you know that tracking the destruction of the whole planet will that
[1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:30.440]  be enough no it won't be enough we want to go beyond existence of exploitation
[1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:34.440]  and oppression altogether but that's a process and I think what's great about
[1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:39.280]  the movement is beginning to emerge is that the crisis is so severe in terms of
[1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:44.400]  joblessness violence and now ecological threats that people are willing to be
[1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:50.200]  both very pragmatic and very visionary that's enough the point is is he admits
[1:10:50.200 --> 1:10:53.760]  they're incrementally doing this with deception now he was already gonna have
[1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:59.400]  to resign over saying shut down talk radio get rid of free speech Republicans
[1:10:59.400 --> 1:11:04.920]  are all these cuss words black supremacist statements about whites being the
[1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:09.360]  devil but then he also signed some 911 truth statement they're trying to use
[1:11:09.360 --> 1:11:13.280]  that to demonize 911 truth and say oh look he's unpopular because of this no
[1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:18.320]  New York Times poll three years ago 84% believe the government's line about 911
[1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:22.520]  I just read to you seven of the 10 Commission members saying it was a
[1:11:22.520 --> 1:11:27.840]  whitewash and a lie and there needs to be a new investigation now for the next
[1:11:27.840 --> 1:11:32.680]  15 minutes for the balance of the show here want to welcome San Francisco Bay
[1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:38.280]  Area architect Richard Gage architects and engineers founder he's an AIA member
[1:11:38.280 --> 1:11:41.240]  of the American Institute of Architects and founder of architects and engineers
[1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:46.040]  911 truth now with well over 800 members calling for an investigation in the
[1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:52.000]  destruction of three World Trade Center high rises on 911 and he is on with us
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.960]  today very honored to have him to talk about all these big TV hit pieces coming
[1:11:56.960 --> 1:12:01.920]  out against him I think he did the best job on the show of all the people that
[1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:06.560]  were on it and I really appreciate Richard Gage coming on with us Richard
[1:12:06.560 --> 1:12:11.000]  good to have you here thank you Alex it's my honor we're gonna break here in a
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:14.760]  few minutes but just in a nutshell this National Geographic piece I mean they
[1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:19.320]  shot a missile into a chicken coop and said that that a missile would have blown
[1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:23.920]  up the entire Pentagon they they just I mean the whole thing I mean as an
[1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:28.360]  architect and an engineer what did you think of this well it was they were
[1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:37.080]  doing their job Alex they set up a piece that was designed to quell the truth
[1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:43.880]  and to not display any of the evidence really that we had brought into the
[1:12:43.880 --> 1:12:48.320]  interview so there's a whole lot to discuss here and what I'm looking
[1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:53.200]  forward to taking it piece by piece with you but certainly it was
[1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:59.200]  extremely unscientific and composed of these three ridiculous so-called
[1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:05.760]  experiments more like magic tricks than anything else well I mean there's so
[1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:09.280]  many points but but then they also examine our psychology like we're
[1:13:09.280 --> 1:13:13.840]  mentally ill and schizophrenic psychology today has a big cover story on me
[1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:18.160]  saying the Bilderberg doesn't exist and you know I go to these hotels and cover
[1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:23.360]  the global elite and have full-born hallucinations that's not gonna work they
[1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:27.000]  also say in the piece that the government's never changed its story and
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:30.240]  the 9-11 and the 9-11 Commission's never changed its story I just
[1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:34.880]  read quotes of seven of the ten members saying it was a complete and total
[1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:41.760]  fraud yeah and that it was that's that's given in fact in fact Max
[1:13:41.760 --> 1:13:47.960]  Cleveland was one of them and he resigned citing this is a national scandal the
[1:13:47.960 --> 1:13:54.320]  investigation is compromised yeah that's an exact quote from the Washington post
[1:13:54.320 --> 1:13:58.240]  well when we come back I'm gonna try to sit back mr. Gage we're gonna punch your
[1:13:58.240 --> 1:14:03.160]  website up on screen go over the debunking of the thermite the thermate
[1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:07.760]  the collapse all of it whatever areas as a architect engineer who built large
[1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:11.520]  buildings and plus the other 800 members that you have of what really
[1:14:11.520 --> 1:14:14.560]  happened then we're gonna play some clips of this but as we go to break I
[1:14:14.560 --> 1:14:19.420]  just want to point out that I've seen the thermite reactions that Professor
[1:14:19.420 --> 1:14:26.400]  Jones of BYU now retired has done I mean a small cup of real thermite goes
[1:14:26.400 --> 1:14:30.560]  right through an engine block NASA admits they use it for the coupler
[1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:34.840]  separators not even explosive thermite and they put a hundred and something
[1:14:34.840 --> 1:14:40.120]  pounds on a column and it barely even sparkles like a regular sparkle I dare
[1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:46.040]  say that wasn't real thermite oh interesting well even if it was real
[1:14:46.040 --> 1:14:55.240]  thermite it it needs to be contained in order to be effective and so we know in
[1:14:55.240 --> 1:15:00.280]  for instance in 1984 interestingly enough there was there might there was a
[1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:09.240]  patent for a thermite cutter charge that ejected molten iron in just a thousand
[1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:14.000]  seconds of a second making it more effective than normal cutter charges
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:20.280]  with high energy explosives like C4 and RDX not only that another patent that
[1:15:20.280 --> 1:15:26.880]  device it may continue it is the shell casing of these cutter charges is
[1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:32.560]  consolidated thermite it is self-consuming so that the only product
[1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:38.280]  left behind in the residue is molten metal and you gave all that's a national
[1:15:38.280 --> 1:15:44.480]  geographic and they laugh at you and professor Jones and others and just
[1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:49.280]  laugh and say there's no such thing as it I mean it's insane there are all these
[1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:52.520]  patents the Pentagon's involved just so happens some of the NIST
[1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:57.800]  investigators are world experts in explosive thermite working on the towers
[1:15:57.800 --> 1:16:00.440]  we'll be right back

[1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:08.280]  a solar power generator this summer number one new climate legislation could
[1:19:08.280 --> 1:19:12.120]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:19:12.120 --> 1:19:16.240]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[1:19:16.240 --> 1:19:19.960]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:24.160]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:27.600]  is dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:31.560]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again every
[1:19:31.560 --> 1:19:35.240]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages number
[1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:39.240]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:42.640]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:46.000]  solutions from science a long-time sponsor of ours you can get more

[1:20:01.840 --> 1:20:15.160]  I was a highway man along the coach roads I did ride
[1:20:15.160 --> 1:20:20.040]  with sword and pistol by my side
[1:20:20.040 --> 1:20:28.120]  many a young man lost her bobbles to my tree and listen when I say Richard Gage
[1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:33.480]  did the best job I've been on national television history channel PBS for these
[1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:39.120]  9-11 truth hit pieces they come interview you two three four five six times
[1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:44.320]  over several days several months happens different ways different times and
[1:20:44.320 --> 1:20:48.880]  then they just get the one time you stumble the one mistake you make the
[1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:53.760]  one time you rub your nose the one time you pick your face and there's some of
[1:20:53.760 --> 1:20:59.480]  that in the piece but not by Richard Gage and Professor Jones did a good job
[1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:04.400]  G ever Griffin did a good job the problem is Griffin's nice though they go
[1:21:04.400 --> 1:21:08.960]  well you know couldn't the hypothesis that fire brought the buildings down be
[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:15.560]  true and Gage is you know focused with him G ever Griffin not G ever Griffin I
[1:21:15.560 --> 1:21:21.480]  always get the two mixed up G ever yes David Ray Griffin I've got so much on
[1:21:21.480 --> 1:21:24.320]  my mind folks you'll find out Tuesday why that I'm getting everything wrong not
[1:21:24.320 --> 1:21:28.600]  you ever Griffin David Ray Griffin he's so polite when they ask him well
[1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:33.200]  couldn't it be something else he goes well I guess so they use his niceness so
[1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:36.680]  they all did a pretty good job too there's no way to do a good job the way
[1:21:36.680 --> 1:21:43.560]  they edit things okay Mr. Gage you and Professor Jones and Professor you know
[1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:49.440]  all you guys did a great job with what you were facing better job than I've
[1:21:49.440 --> 1:21:53.720]  done you've got the floor break down the real science this is pretty
[1:21:53.720 --> 1:21:58.480]  interesting series of events and I want to tell you how it worked out Alex
[1:21:58.480 --> 1:22:04.240]  because we were invited down there for the first interview and I spent one
[1:22:04.240 --> 1:22:10.560]  hour highlighting all of the evidence for explosive controlled demolition in
[1:22:10.560 --> 1:22:16.840]  this first interview including the constant acceleration of the twin towers
[1:22:16.840 --> 1:22:22.360]  at two-thirds of freefall acceleration the improbable symmetry of the degree of
[1:22:22.360 --> 1:22:27.000]  distribution the rapid onset of destruction which is not characteristic
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:31.400]  of any collapse even though by the way fires never brought down a steel frame
[1:22:31.400 --> 1:22:35.920]  high-rise I told them about the hundred first responders reporting
[1:22:35.920 --> 1:22:40.680]  explosions and flashes of light at the onset of collapse I told them about the
[1:22:40.680 --> 1:22:46.680]  multi-ton steel sections ejecting at 60 to 70 miles an hour out of the sides of
[1:22:46.680 --> 1:22:51.560]  the twin towers 600 feet the midair pulverization of 90,000 tons of
[1:22:51.560 --> 1:22:58.160]  concrete massive volumes of pyroclastic like clouds of a suspended
[1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:04.160]  concrete 1200 foot diameter distribution field symmetrically placed outside the
[1:23:04.160 --> 1:23:08.520]  footprint of these towers the fact that there's no pancake floors found at the
[1:23:08.520 --> 1:23:12.840]  base of either tower just a two-story pile of rubble and how these squids
[1:23:12.840 --> 1:23:16.920]  are these I gotta stop you I'm sorry I lied saying I would interrupt
[1:23:16.920 --> 1:23:20.960]  national geographic did put a press release out a week before the airing of
[1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:25.480]  this latest piece of disinfo apologizing and admitting that it wasn't pancake
[1:23:25.480 --> 1:23:31.840]  now that they were wrong they have a new bogus made up fraud go ahead yeah that's
[1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:37.840]  called the column failure theory either way we would expect 110 floors found at
[1:23:37.840 --> 1:23:42.560]  the base of either of these maybe 50 of them but we don't find any floors we don't
[1:23:42.560 --> 1:23:47.040]  find macroscopic chunks of concrete we don't find people we don't find 10,000
[1:23:47.040 --> 1:23:51.760]  bio cabinets all of it has been systematically pulverized and spread up
[1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:58.280]  to 600 feet away we have several tons of molten iron with video and photographic
[1:23:58.280 --> 1:24:02.600]  analysis and eyewitness testimony from the first responders I explained all of
[1:24:02.600 --> 1:24:09.040]  this to them including the evidence of high-tech nano thermite very high tech
[1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:15.280]  stuff which Dr. Jones also went through in detail with them we talked about the
[1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:20.480]  FEMA's analysis of the steel from World Trade Center 7 where they document
[1:24:20.480 --> 1:24:26.400]  sulfidation oxidation intergranular melting all of this evidence was
[1:24:26.400 --> 1:24:32.040]  presented for them not only for the twin towers but for the 47 story collapse of
[1:24:32.040 --> 1:24:37.920]  the building 7 at freefall acceleration for at least a hundred feet and the
[1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:43.400]  molten metal found underneath it that was a classic implosion it's very clear
[1:24:43.400 --> 1:24:48.720]  now what National Geographic showed that the collapse of building 7 but they
[1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:53.600]  didn't say anything about it nor did they give any of the evidence so there I
[1:24:53.600 --> 1:24:59.840]  am being quoted as talking about the evidence for controlled demolition but
[1:24:59.840 --> 1:25:04.360]  they didn't play any of it and then you have this jerk Ken Blanchard from Pro
[1:25:04.360 --> 1:25:10.520]  Tech saying there's no evidence of controlled demolition it's a classic
[1:25:10.520 --> 1:25:16.040]  straw man and then they get so cheap a separate issue the Pentagon they fire a
[1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:21.360]  plant a pound of plastic explosive on a missile into a fiberglass chicken coop
[1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:24.880]  and say if a missile would have hit the Pentagon it would have blown the whole
[1:25:24.880 --> 1:25:28.920]  Pentagon up now side issue I know you're not getting into the Pentagon it's just
[1:25:28.920 --> 1:25:33.560]  that it's almost like they made it ridiculous as a hit piece to make people
[1:25:33.560 --> 1:25:37.960]  wake up I mean I know that wasn't their intention but have you ever seen a hit
[1:25:37.960 --> 1:25:44.000]  piece this shoddy no no this this is this takes the cake I I can only imagine
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  that of the Americans that are not yet aware of the 9-11 truth that I I sure
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:57.680]  hope that at least 50% of them seeing this will will clearly see the
[1:25:57.680 --> 1:26:03.680]  incredible bias in the manner of presentation the tone of voice the
[1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:09.360]  declaring us truthers in a condescending way and conspiracy theorists in a
[1:26:09.360 --> 1:26:13.000]  condescending way they did the language of film to they would put truth or
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:17.320]  crooked down at the bottom to make your name plates even look screwed up but
[1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:21.560]  then the people that were debunking you was all done with precision that's what
[1:26:21.560 --> 1:26:24.800]  popular mechanics the fathers of yellow journalism that actually own part of
[1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:28.400]  history channel now that's what they did they blow up my face make it all
[1:26:28.400 --> 1:26:32.640]  yellow then they show popular mechanics glistening stainless steel never tell
[1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:36.400]  people that popular mechanics owns history channel the whole thing's an
[1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:41.960]  ad for their debunking book all lies go ahead well not only that but to Rupert
[1:26:41.960 --> 1:26:49.480]  Murdoch owns Fox News and which owns 60% of National Geographic Channel that you
[1:26:49.480 --> 1:26:53.360]  would they know Robert Erickson of creative differences the producer of
[1:26:53.360 --> 1:26:58.560]  this hippies very well understands where which which side the table is that is
[1:26:58.560 --> 1:27:04.960]  buttered on this is this is really important for people to understand that
[1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:08.800]  wait a minute creative differences called me last year wanted me to be in a
[1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:14.280]  JFK thing and I said no man the this is boy I tell you it's like they have one
[1:27:14.280 --> 1:27:19.520]  production company for all this disinformation well yes and relative
[1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:24.920]  to creative differences when we went down there for our first interview for
[1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:29.360]  our second interview we were shown what's called the rough cut then this was
[1:27:29.360 --> 1:27:36.480]  about three months later and I don't know about four months ago and we were
[1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:42.400]  shown David Ray Griffin Dylan and I what was going to be on the final piece
[1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:48.640]  and guess what most of that evidence that I just highlighted to you was in
[1:27:48.640 --> 1:27:53.560]  there and I'm going my god this is great I can't believe you they're not going to
[1:27:53.560 --> 1:27:58.720]  let you play this Bob is what I told him and he says well they've never edited me
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:04.040]  before so go and behold what comes out and I just thought the other day thank
[1:28:04.040 --> 1:28:08.160]  you for sending it to me because I don't get the National Geographic Channel I
[1:28:08.160 --> 1:28:13.960]  look in there and not one piece of our evidence is is shown and all they show
[1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:21.040]  is us reacting you know coldly having not seen any of these experiments before
[1:28:21.040 --> 1:28:27.120]  having not been consulted at all about they just show you these stage deals
[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:31.960]  where I mean it's patented that thermite cuts right through steel and is used
[1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:36.360]  for that the explosive thermate and they just I mean they show you some
[1:28:36.360 --> 1:28:41.680]  sparkler held up to the side of one doesn't even explode and then you guys
[1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:45.400]  are like that's interesting you're being shown a video tape of something and
[1:28:45.400 --> 1:28:51.080]  they go oh but that didn't convince the crazies nothing will no we just have the
[1:28:51.080 --> 1:28:54.320]  firemen and police saying get back we're blowing up seven we've been told

[1:32:11.960 --> 1:32:16.080]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[1:32:16.080 --> 1:32:19.760]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:32:19.760 --> 1:32:23.960]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[1:32:23.960 --> 1:32:27.400]  is dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[1:32:27.400 --> 1:32:31.360]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again every
[1:32:31.360 --> 1:32:35.040]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages number

[1:33:01.640 --> 1:33:17.200]  we recommend will help prevent such a disaster from ever happening again the
[1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:34.120]  government timeline of events has been consistent traveling at 440 miles per
[1:33:34.120 --> 1:33:38.080]  hour and carrying about 10 and then they go on to say that the government's
[1:33:38.080 --> 1:33:43.960]  never changed its story NIST has changed its story six times giving different
[1:33:43.960 --> 1:33:49.640]  reasons both the big towers fell then 47 story building seven where the CIA was
[1:33:49.640 --> 1:33:55.960]  housed hit by nothing small fires implodes perfectly in its own footprint
[1:33:55.960 --> 1:34:01.440]  the media false scripts announced 25 minutes before on BBC and CNN that it's
[1:34:01.440 --> 1:34:07.160]  fallen from fire completely in its own footprint while it's still standing I've
[1:34:07.160 --> 1:34:12.240]  interviewed the police environment and EMTs on air where they're going everybody
[1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:17.240]  get back there's a government countdown 1098 and the cops are all running the
[1:34:17.240 --> 1:34:22.120]  government blew it up hundreds of police environment and medical workers are on
[1:34:22.120 --> 1:34:26.120]  record you can see democracy now Amy Goodman's out there reporting and she's
[1:34:26.120 --> 1:34:30.240]  like they say get out of here it's a countdown and then they're all running
[1:34:30.240 --> 1:34:35.080]  and they building seven falls but none of that gets to be in the piece Richard
[1:34:35.080 --> 1:34:39.200]  I remember about five six months ago having you on and I'm not beating you
[1:34:39.200 --> 1:34:43.360]  up I remember we kind of had a debate on air about whether this was going to be a
[1:34:43.360 --> 1:34:48.000]  hit piece or not you said no they're taking I'm sorry that you remembered that
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:53.760]  conversation Alex no no no no I've been put through this as well they will sit
[1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:58.280]  there and go I swear to you this is not a hit piece we believe your side and
[1:34:58.280 --> 1:35:02.600]  we're going to show your evidence I promise Operation Northwoods and I had
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:08.080]  History Channel when it was done laugh at me in the parking lot and say you're
[1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:14.480]  an idiot we're gonna get you oh I mean oh yeah they love these people knowingly
[1:35:14.480 --> 1:35:19.040]  live for a living listen the same production crew wanted me to go be in a
[1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:23.880]  JFK film and I talked to the people they were discussing you know with a fake
[1:35:23.880 --> 1:35:28.360]  president's head full of green jelly and the car wasn't the right spot and it
[1:35:28.360 --> 1:35:32.480]  doesn't matter 92% of Americans in a Gallup poll believe the government killed
[1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:36.920]  Kennedy 84% of New York Times poll believe the government's lying about 911
[1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:42.800]  seven of the ten commissioners say it was a fraud no lie and a cover-up so but
[1:35:42.800 --> 1:35:46.840]  but I think that's key evidence though that they told you your evidence would
[1:35:46.840 --> 1:35:51.880]  be in there they showed you a fake cut again that goes to their credibility like
[1:35:51.880 --> 1:35:57.240]  nothing else oh yeah and this is the stunning given the reputation National
[1:35:57.240 --> 1:36:03.880]  Geographic has for you know a reputation certainly of of honesty and
[1:36:03.880 --> 1:36:11.920]  scientific pursuit this is this is an absolute joke at this point and you're
[1:36:11.920 --> 1:36:20.120]  right that was a double-cross on the part of Robert Erickson of creative
[1:36:20.120 --> 1:36:26.080]  differences I'm stunned I've got another opportunity in New York next week
[1:36:26.080 --> 1:36:31.280]  where I will be interviewed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation only
[1:36:31.280 --> 1:36:38.360]  rumok of the fifth estate program on the CBC up there and where he's doing a
[1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:42.360]  special on the scientific side they've actually done some fair jobs on that
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:47.400]  very popular national program I'm glad to hear that because I haven't done the
[1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:52.960]  research yet in the past the fifth of state has done some of the most fair
[1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:56.760]  and objective reporting in the world like they'll cover the US government
[1:36:56.760 --> 1:37:01.800]  admits they've staged over 200 terror attacks in other countries US researchers
[1:37:01.800 --> 1:37:06.000]  believe that 9-11 may have been the same let's look at both sides I was in a
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  report they did like five years ago I don't know this is a different a
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  producer but but overall the show at least we'll look at you know we're not
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:19.120]  just crazily thinking this it's like if you have a neighbor who just got out of
[1:37:19.120 --> 1:37:22.840]  jail for robbing banks and one week after he gets out of jail another bank
[1:37:22.840 --> 1:37:27.120]  gets robbed and the description fits you're not a conspiracy theorist to say
[1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:31.960]  maybe Bob did it but but but listen Richard I got you here now give out the
[1:37:31.960 --> 1:37:36.080]  architects and engineers site the documents the videos we sell some of the
[1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:40.080]  great films you guys have produced with your evidence at info wars dot com in
[1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:44.200]  the in the online video bookstore but regardless tell folks about the website
[1:37:44.200 --> 1:37:48.040]  so people can actually go see the evidence for themselves and not see it
[1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:54.000]  distorted through the lens of the CIA I mean of this company creative
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:38:03.480]  differences yeah our website is called the AE 911 truth dot org which is
[1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:09.440]  stands for architects and engineers for 9-11 truth AE 9-11 truth dot org and
[1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:15.160]  you can get the DVD there where we lay out two hours and the two-hour research
[1:38:15.160 --> 1:38:22.800]  edition of our 9-11 blueprint for truth DVD and we also now by the way Alex we
[1:38:22.800 --> 1:38:28.520]  have another DVD which is the companion edition it has the abridged version
[1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:33.800]  there's a 10 minute a 30 minute and a 60 minute version all on this DVD so you
[1:38:33.800 --> 1:38:38.560]  don't have to ask a friend or a colleague to sit through two hours of of the
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:43.720]  DVD in 10 minutes you know we give the follow the crucial evidence for Bill
[1:38:43.720 --> 1:38:48.640]  that's right you've got a key boil down YouTube type video on the front page and
[1:38:48.640 --> 1:38:51.720]  then a bunch of others for people that you don't want to get the down and dirty
[1:38:51.720 --> 1:38:57.840]  quick skinny and then watch the National Geographic piece and it really becomes
[1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:04.800]  a laughingstock yeah especially when if you watch the DVD by Stephen Jones the
[1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:08.960]  only brand new you know it's only come out in the last month
[1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:15.360]  nanothermite what in the world it is as nanothermite doing in the World Trade
[1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:21.760]  Center dust this is that his whole this is the whole documentary of his 27 page
[1:39:21.760 --> 1:39:27.360]  peer-reviewed paper in which he documents the findings of these small
[1:39:27.360 --> 1:39:32.480]  chips of nanothermite found in all of the dust samples that he's collected and
[1:39:32.480 --> 1:39:38.600]  others have collected throughout the lower Manhattan and now and now separate
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:43.640]  universities separate professors have gone to groups cities and counties that
[1:39:43.640 --> 1:39:48.760]  got steel for their own memorials and have tested it I know Jones has done
[1:39:48.760 --> 1:39:53.840]  scores of samples from people's homes that documented live there whose homes
[1:39:53.840 --> 1:39:58.680]  have been demolished or being demolished and but this the show tries to imply he
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:01.840]  never had a chain of custody well when you've got all these different
[1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:05.120]  universities all these different professors and Jones from all these
[1:40:05.120 --> 1:40:09.720]  different sources finding the same evidence of nanothermite and then you
[1:40:09.720 --> 1:40:13.680]  have this this this this piece saying there's no such thing as explosive
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:19.760]  thermite when it's patented and on record I mean this is incredible yeah it is
[1:40:19.760 --> 1:40:23.440]  patented and on record and that was over 10 years ago Lawrence Livermore lab
[1:40:23.440 --> 1:40:28.400]  Los Alamos lab documents this stuff and the particles of the iron oxide and
[1:40:28.400 --> 1:40:33.520]  aluminum are a thousand times smaller than a human hair the iron oxide particles
[1:40:33.520 --> 1:40:38.800]  are perfectly rhomboidal in shape at 40 nanometers and the aluminum plates are
[1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:43.440]  about the same size and perfectly uniform and they are mixed in this one
[1:40:43.440 --> 1:40:49.920]  third two-third proportion that you have to have for this ideal thermite
[1:40:49.920 --> 1:40:53.640]  reaction and that's not because of the surface area is so small it becomes
[1:40:53.640 --> 1:40:59.280]  extremely explosive which is why it's called a super thermite or and made of
[1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:03.480]  and that's what they use with just a thin caulking to separate the missile
[1:41:03.480 --> 1:41:09.440]  sections or rocket sections of an ICBM or a Saturn type rocket now also they
[1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:15.120]  show the hot steel pouring out of the side the molten iron from the steel
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:19.000]  being melted and they say oh that's aluminum but Jones and others have done
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:23.880]  the test and it shows aluminum comes out white and flaky doesn't keep any color
[1:41:23.880 --> 1:41:27.960]  for more than a second and only a few feet this is falling hundreds and hundreds
[1:41:27.960 --> 1:41:33.600]  of feet and staying yellow and then orange and then red only iron does that
[1:41:33.600 --> 1:41:40.760]  and then separately we have the videos from New York TV the firefighters saying
[1:41:40.760 --> 1:41:46.240]  thousands and thousands of degrees above jet fuel molten lava molten steel and
[1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:52.720]  iron down in the pits a month after the collapse 1800 degree jet fuel can't do
[1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:57.840]  that the firefighters are saying molten iron only molten iron can be caused by
[1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:03.600]  massive thermite yeah there's no iron in in the building first of all there's
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:07.840]  iron in steel columns of course but it's an alloy and what dr. Jones finds is
[1:42:07.840 --> 1:42:12.800]  this these previously molten iron chunks which he's analyzed are indeed
[1:42:12.800 --> 1:42:17.400]  not melted structural steel because there's abundant manganese in them and
[1:42:17.400 --> 1:42:24.900]  very little chromium too so this is clearly another a third an additional
[1:42:24.900 --> 1:42:29.280]  component that's not in building materials and so where did it come from
[1:42:29.280 --> 1:42:34.400]  well it could only come from thermite thermite byproduct is molten iron all
[1:42:34.400 --> 1:42:39.720]  of the evidence is supporting the control hypothesis theory well we normally
[1:42:39.720 --> 1:42:45.920]  take calls on the show but I've been so busy with this information we have but
[1:42:45.920 --> 1:42:53.640]  we'll take a few calls for Richard Gage straight ahead 888-201-2244 888-201-2244

[1:44:06.920 --> 1:44:11.000]  recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor they found that
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:15.440]  over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water many
[1:44:15.440 --> 1:44:19.080]  of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and
[1:44:19.080 --> 1:44:22.840]  developmental system diseases now what are you going to do about it the

[1:46:04.320 --> 1:46:08.120]  a solar power generator this summer number one new climate legislation could
[1:46:08.120 --> 1:46:11.960]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:46:11.960 --> 1:46:16.080]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:19.760]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:46:19.760 --> 1:46:24.080]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:46:24.080 --> 1:46:27.400]  dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[1:46:27.400 --> 1:46:30.960]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[1:46:30.960 --> 1:46:34.600]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages
[1:46:34.600 --> 1:46:38.760]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[1:46:38.760 --> 1:46:42.480]  peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[1:46:42.480 --> 1:46:45.840]  solutions from science a long-time sponsor of ours you can get more

[1:47:13.760 --> 1:47:19.480]  ladies and gentlemen two program notes on Tuesday's radio show I'm gonna have
[1:47:19.480 --> 1:47:26.160]  huge breaking news that I'm asking for all of you to join us in something very
[1:47:26.160 --> 1:47:32.000]  very important huge breaking important news that you will be involved in and
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:37.720]  it's it's it's big biggest thing we've ever done coming up Tuesday you don't
[1:47:37.720 --> 1:47:42.000]  want to miss that we're gonna have some foreshadowing of some idea of it in a
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:47.240]  post tomorrow at prisonplanet.com and info wars.com but then look for it
[1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:52.960]  Tuesday also there's a new film was the main selection the winner of this year's
[1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:57.480]  out by Southwest New World Order and I'm the main featured individual and that
[1:47:57.480 --> 1:48:03.080]  is now out on DVD with an expanded extras available at info wars.com of
[1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:07.360]  course there's my two latest films government sponsored terrorism terror
[1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:14.520]  storm and the the 9-11 Chronicles all available at info wars.com be of the
[1:48:14.520 --> 1:48:17.640]  safe secure online video bookstore shopping cart we also have Richard
[1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:21.440]  Gage documentaries and all the great books t-shirts and materials that get
[1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:26.320]  the word out I want to take a few calls for our guest coming up here but in three
[1:48:26.320 --> 1:48:30.400]  or four minutes before we take some final calls you'll have a full hour with
[1:48:30.400 --> 1:48:34.880]  less ads coming up on the Wednesday show professor Stephen Jones is also on
[1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:40.200]  other key points about this piece and and and this attempt to debunk 9-11
[1:48:40.200 --> 1:48:44.040]  truth I mean if 9-11 truth wasn't important and wasn't exposing stage
[1:48:44.040 --> 1:48:47.680]  terror the whole pretext the establishment uses for control they
[1:48:47.680 --> 1:48:52.920]  wouldn't be trying to debunk you yeah this is true where this is good news
[1:48:52.920 --> 1:48:58.880]  let's take it as that Alex we there's a there's a serious attempt to make a
[1:48:58.880 --> 1:49:07.000]  very unscientific analysis to label us as conspiracy theorist and show but I
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:12.040]  think it all backfired I really do it was so shoddy as you suggest that it
[1:49:12.040 --> 1:49:17.160]  can't I can't hold water with thinking people it simply can't I mean we have
[1:49:17.160 --> 1:49:22.080]  800 architects and engineers now signed on to the petition virtually every
[1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:27.120]  architect and engineer who looks at our who's at our presentation or reviews our
[1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:32.280]  DVD ends up going oh my god well I can't believe I didn't know about all of this
[1:49:32.280 --> 1:49:37.440]  how come I hadn't heard about this of course this makes sense you're right
[1:49:37.440 --> 1:49:41.520]  and they end up signing our petition that's pretty extraordinary I mean we
[1:49:41.520 --> 1:49:46.400]  have incredible response right now show of hands everywhere we go around the
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:49.800]  world well that's the big dirty secret is that every time they do these shoddy
[1:49:49.800 --> 1:49:54.840]  hit pieces it just wakes more people up it's like they're saying the world is
[1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:59.040]  flat we're saying it's round they do TV special saying it's flat they're
[1:49:59.040 --> 1:50:04.320]  discrediting themselves the question is why do they keep doing it they have to
[1:50:04.320 --> 1:50:09.960]  respond somehow and I guess they just don't do a real good job of manipulating
[1:50:09.960 --> 1:50:15.960]  up maybe that's maybe that's the best they're capable of I'm I you know it's
[1:50:15.960 --> 1:50:21.240]  disturbing that I I spent a half an hour to an hour presenting very detailed
[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:26.320]  evidence for all of this stuff and it doesn't get on but I've learned to not
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:32.080]  take it personally and to almost expect it and we think any exposure like this
[1:50:32.080 --> 1:50:38.040]  is is better than none particularly when they help us by doing such a bad job
[1:50:38.040 --> 1:50:45.240]  of it let's play a short little clip here where they then spent where they
[1:50:45.240 --> 1:50:53.080]  then spend the second half of the piece bumbling and babbling on national
[1:50:53.080 --> 1:50:58.400]  propaganda National Geographic saying this is what we want to believe and that
[1:50:58.400 --> 1:51:02.800]  we're basically delusional here it is
[1:51:02.800 --> 1:51:16.000]  theories the reality is this far out no one has been able to provide a single
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:19.480]  piece of evidence that those buildings were explosively demolished and the
[1:51:19.480 --> 1:51:25.280]  reason is they weren't by presenting this new evidence to the truthers they
[1:51:25.280 --> 1:51:31.520]  and we might learn more about their theories their beliefs and perhaps most
[1:51:31.520 --> 1:51:37.160]  importantly why they want to believe you take out some of those experiments you
[1:51:37.160 --> 1:51:40.760]  paid a lot of money for but don't prove anything you're gonna have a lot of I
[1:51:40.760 --> 1:51:44.960]  mean folks it is a complete joke let's take some phone calls for Richard Gage
[1:51:44.960 --> 1:51:51.080]  John and Louisiana you're on the air go ahead how you doing Alex good are you
[1:51:51.080 --> 1:51:57.840]  doing Richard I would I would like to ask you Richard how long do you think that
[1:51:57.840 --> 1:52:02.440]  because you know they know for my very very small not very noticeable how long
[1:52:02.440 --> 1:52:06.560]  do you think they could have been present in the towers it was painted on
[1:52:06.560 --> 1:52:12.960]  clearly and we even know they say unconventional fireproofing was put on
[1:52:12.960 --> 1:52:18.280]  but that's what one of the underwriters with you underwriting laboratories said
[1:52:18.280 --> 1:52:23.400]  here on the show but go ahead yeah well Kevin Ryan has done some analysis
[1:52:23.400 --> 1:52:27.840]  indicating that there were indeed fireproofing retrofits that in the floors
[1:52:27.840 --> 1:52:31.280]  above and below the point of jet plane impacts which are different in each of
[1:52:31.280 --> 1:52:35.160]  the north tower and the south tower so that's a very interesting he documents
[1:52:35.160 --> 1:52:40.360]  that in the Journal of 911 studies dot com relative to your question about how
[1:52:40.360 --> 1:52:45.560]  long this stuff's been available for about 10 years we know for the last nine
[1:52:45.560 --> 1:52:49.960]  months that there was an elevator retrofit going on the largest elevator
[1:52:49.960 --> 1:52:56.760]  modernization in history actually where all the core elevators the elevators in
[1:52:56.760 --> 1:53:02.080]  the core of each tower were were were changed out they had 85 employees in
[1:53:02.080 --> 1:53:08.400]  fact from a elevator on a scatter the morning of 911 after the first jet
[1:53:08.400 --> 1:53:12.480]  plane hit they were supposed to stick around and help the first responders
[1:53:12.480 --> 1:53:18.320]  but some somebody perhaps in the guise of an elevator modernization could have
[1:53:18.320 --> 1:53:22.920]  had access to the core columns and beams in the building and they had all sorts of
[1:53:22.920 --> 1:53:28.480]  weird terror drills evacuating thank you John finish up Richard yeah so there
[1:53:28.480 --> 1:53:33.960]  was access there so when we when we talk about who might have been able to do
[1:53:33.960 --> 1:53:37.480]  this we have to have say who had access to the they also say where's the debt
[1:53:37.480 --> 1:53:41.160]  cord we would have seen debt cord well FEMA was all secretive everything was
[1:53:41.160 --> 1:53:45.840]  blown into tiny pieces there were all these maintenance shafts and maintenance
[1:53:45.840 --> 1:53:51.160]  floors we have a timed devices that are very small very high-tech now you don't
[1:53:51.160 --> 1:53:56.240]  need that cord this is wireless this is wireless technology now absolutely let's
[1:53:56.240 --> 1:54:03.960]  jam in another seal in Canada you're on the air hello there hi how well mister
[1:54:03.960 --> 1:54:08.960]  Jones general Jones and gentlemen I'm so glad to talk to you today calling you
[1:54:08.960 --> 1:54:13.520]  from Alberta up here in the foothills of the Rockies and you know this comment
[1:54:13.520 --> 1:54:17.600]  by National Geographic where they say why they want to believe it's more
[1:54:17.600 --> 1:54:21.360]  better said who they want to believe I mean who you're gonna believe you're
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:24.200]  gonna believe these people that they're bringing these chemtrails and this wine
[1:54:24.200 --> 1:54:27.680]  flu and all the questions of that all these people that are dead that were
[1:54:27.680 --> 1:54:31.680]  students that that made this wine flu bacteria and all the rest of it who are
[1:54:31.680 --> 1:54:35.720]  you gonna believe absolutely I appreciate your call yeah I mean it's
[1:54:35.720 --> 1:54:40.280]  declassified that half a million Americans were sterilized illegally that
[1:54:40.280 --> 1:54:45.160]  foster children were taken and tested pesticides chemicals radiologicals
[1:54:45.160 --> 1:54:50.480]  that all of this goes on that our own troops were nerve gas to death and so
[1:54:50.480 --> 1:54:54.080]  if the government would do this in the past why wouldn't they do this now
[1:54:54.080 --> 1:55:00.520]  Richard Gage that I have to leave that question for for somebody else we do
[1:55:00.520 --> 1:55:05.160]  focus on the evidence that the World Trade Center for the explosives absolutely
[1:55:05.160 --> 1:55:08.480]  absolutely you're looking at the science but if you have a history of the
[1:55:08.480 --> 1:55:11.800]  government that stage terror attacks and treats human life like it's a
[1:55:11.800 --> 1:55:16.000]  negative not just doesn't care about it you got to think about that Bill in
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:20.760]  Texas last caller got about a minute and a half left Bill go ahead hey Alex
[1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:24.080]  certainly nice to talk to you finally listen I'm members of both of you guys
[1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:28.560]  websites and I have two questions one is is the pilots for 9-11 truth which is
[1:55:28.560 --> 1:55:32.680]  another group similar architects and engineers they most of them believe that
[1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:37.680]  no planes were used at least they think that the maneuvers that were called on
[1:55:37.680 --> 1:55:42.080]  the hijackers to do were impossible for them to be them do you guys believe there
[1:55:42.080 --> 1:55:46.480]  were planes let me let me take this here they have people in the nationals
[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:51.840]  geographic special the leaders of the no-plane group in wearing pictures of me
[1:55:51.840 --> 1:55:56.480]  on their body and dressed up like dragons this is disinfo government
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:02.360]  period now we're saying questionable Pentagon because of witnesses when we say
[1:56:02.360 --> 1:56:06.600]  cargo planes but not regular planes that's an operation Northwoods
[1:56:06.600 --> 1:56:10.920]  declassified so we have to look at it see the government and their disinfo
[1:56:10.920 --> 1:56:15.480]  ops want you to get off another stuff and I've talked to pilots from 11 truth
[1:56:15.480 --> 1:56:19.920]  the majority of them do not believe that and so that was a strong and false
[1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:23.880]  statement but hell of a way to end the show Richard gaiger back up on the show
[1:56:23.880 --> 1:56:28.120]  Wednesday with professor Stephen Jones will really go through the science then
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:33.400]  play more clips of it Jason Burmese is gonna do three hours on this coming up
[1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:37.040]  right when the show ends on the internet streams at info wars dot com and on the
[1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:42.280]  M&F M's that carry the info warrior that sundays 6 to 9 p.m. central time but
[1:56:42.280 --> 1:56:47.160]  Richard gauge your comments I would imagine on the plane stuff is you stick
[1:56:47.160 --> 1:56:51.720]  to the science what you can prove yeah well we of course planes hit the world
[1:56:51.720 --> 1:56:56.040]  trade center twin towers there's no question in our minds about that the
[1:56:56.040 --> 1:57:00.760]  damage was real all the government can do is just put in kooky conspiracy
[1:57:00.760 --> 1:57:04.600]  theories to try to get I mean that's like what garrison had people popping up
[1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:09.480]  saying you know that yeah yeah yeah yeah saying kooky things in the trial to
[1:57:09.480 --> 1:57:12.240]  discredit go ahead
[1:57:14.080 --> 1:57:18.800]  this acknowledges that the structure of the building did their job it was the
[1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:23.680]  weakening by fire that they say brought the buildings down but as you mentioned
[1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:27.720]  earlier fire cannot create several tons of molten metal found by the first
[1:57:27.720 --> 1:57:33.240]  responders and others and seen the photos and videos throughout so it makes
[1:57:33.240 --> 1:57:39.440]  no sense the official story is that the rug has been pulled out absolutely yeah
[1:57:39.440 --> 1:57:44.000]  we're not who doing other theories and ideas we're sticking with what we can
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  prove Richard gauge thank you so much we'll see you Wednesday thank you Alex
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:59.000]  god bless you all huge news Tuesday
