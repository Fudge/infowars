[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Is the U.S. involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling
[00:09.680 --> 00:15.940]  anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?
[00:15.940 --> 00:18.300]  To Turkey?
[00:18.300 --> 00:22.440]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[00:22.440 --> 00:26.200]  How is it that this organization is so well funded, so organized?
[00:26.200 --> 00:31.040]  Islamic state-linked militants have gained a stronger foothold in Libya, seizing new
[00:31.040 --> 00:33.600]  economically vital areas of the country.
[00:33.600 --> 00:39.440]  The leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdel Hakim Bel-Haj, and of course he
[00:39.440 --> 00:41.600]  was armed to the teeth by NATO.
[00:41.600 --> 00:46.120]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[00:46.120 --> 00:50.600]  The Russians say they're negotiating with North Korea to hold joint military exercises.
[00:50.600 --> 00:55.600]  Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin teaming up, creating an ominous alliance against the United
[00:55.600 --> 00:56.600]  States.
[00:56.600 --> 01:01.280]  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal
[01:01.280 --> 01:04.400]  that the U.S. government is negotiating with Iran.
[01:04.400 --> 01:09.040]  Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to conduct attacks
[01:09.040 --> 01:10.040]  on Iran.
[01:10.040 --> 01:14.840]  We have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order.
[01:14.840 --> 01:21.240]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine and played an important part in events now.
[01:21.240 --> 01:25.600]  Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of the International Monetary Fund aid package,
[01:25.600 --> 01:30.400]  where we have the appropriate deal to transition power in Ukraine.
[01:30.400 --> 01:34.680]  Vladimir Putin is on the move.
[01:34.680 --> 01:40.280]  Only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of the
[01:40.280 --> 01:45.560]  opportunities presented by this new and involving world order.
[01:45.560 --> 01:52.560]  As known as the Bilderberg Group, could their objective be world domination?
[02:45.560 --> 02:48.800]  We've got the Director of Elections here at the Secretary of State office that won't
[02:48.800 --> 02:49.800]  talk to us.
[02:49.800 --> 02:57.400]  It takes one look at the press and turns it on and walks off.
[02:57.400 --> 03:02.360]  David I for infowareers.com, we're here in Austin, Texas at the Capitol at the Secretary
[03:02.360 --> 03:03.360]  of State office.
[03:03.360 --> 03:08.480]  We want to ask the Director of Elections why there have been so many orders to counter
[03:08.480 --> 03:13.960]  vene the law that would give us an audit trail for electronic voting machines.
[03:13.960 --> 03:18.760]  We all are concerned about knowing whether or not we're going to have honest elections,
[03:18.760 --> 03:20.200]  the integrity of the elections.
[03:20.200 --> 03:25.640]  And yet we've seen time and time again that the Director here of Elections has judged
[03:25.640 --> 03:29.760]  in favor of the vendors rather than in favor of integrity.
[03:29.760 --> 03:34.280]  If the vendors machines that he wants to buy don't conform to the election law, they change
[03:34.280 --> 03:35.280]  the election law.
[03:35.280 --> 03:40.320]  So we want to ask him why he's shutting down paper trails at the different precincts, why
[03:40.320 --> 03:45.280]  they are turning away monitors at the elections and other issues about electronic voting
[03:45.280 --> 03:46.840]  that many people are concerned about.
[03:46.840 --> 03:52.640]  It is a nationwide concern and we're going to ask him what he can tell us to reassure
[03:52.640 --> 04:10.560]  voters that these elections are not rigged.
[04:10.560 --> 04:15.560]  You want to talk to us?
[04:15.560 --> 04:16.560]  Really?
[04:16.560 --> 04:18.760]  You don't want to talk to us at all?
[04:18.760 --> 04:20.240]  People concerned the elections are going to be rigged.
[04:20.240 --> 04:25.680]  I guess they're really going to be concerned if they see you turn your back on us.
[04:25.680 --> 04:26.840]  Well can I talk to him?
[04:26.840 --> 04:30.920]  Will anybody here talk to us or do you want to rig this?
[04:30.920 --> 04:33.360]  Why are you cutting off all these audit trails?
[04:33.360 --> 04:39.000]  Why are you cutting down the paper audit trails?
[04:39.000 --> 04:40.440]  Well there you go.
[04:40.440 --> 04:41.440]  That should tell you something.
[04:41.440 --> 04:45.400]  People concerned about elections being rigged, you've got the Director of Elections here
[04:45.400 --> 04:49.160]  at the Secretary of State office that won't talk to us, takes one look at the press and
[04:49.160 --> 04:51.000]  turns it on and walks off.
[04:51.000 --> 05:01.880]  That should tell you a great deal from Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[05:01.880 --> 05:03.720]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[05:03.720 --> 05:04.720]  Michael Moore.
[05:04.720 --> 05:07.600]  Trump's election will be the biggest FU in history.
[05:07.600 --> 05:09.920]  An article up by Paul Joseph Watson.
[05:09.920 --> 05:14.080]  During a speech for his new one man state performance Trumpland, Michael Moore remarked
[05:14.080 --> 05:17.920]  that the election of Donald Trump will be the biggest FU in history.
[05:17.920 --> 05:21.760]  Moore began by saying he knew a lot of people in Michigan who were going to vote for Trump,
[05:21.760 --> 05:25.680]  who were not racist or rednecks, but were sick of their jobs being offshore to places
[05:25.680 --> 05:26.680]  like Mexico.
[05:26.680 --> 05:32.280]  Trump's promise to slap a 35% tariff on Ford cars made in Mexico and sent back to America
[05:32.280 --> 05:37.320]  was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
[05:37.320 --> 05:41.400]  Whether Trump means it or not is kind of irrelevant because he's saying the things
[05:41.400 --> 05:46.040]  of people who are hurting and it's why every beaten down worthless forgotten working stiff
[05:46.040 --> 05:50.320]  who used to be part of what was called the middle class loves Trump, arguing that Trump
[05:50.320 --> 05:54.320]  was the human Molotov cocktail that they've been waiting for, the human hand grenades
[05:54.320 --> 05:58.480]  that they can legally throw into the system that stole the lives from them.
[05:58.480 --> 06:01.560]  You can find more reports like this at Infowars.com.
[06:01.560 --> 06:03.440]  I'm Alex Jones with a simple question.
[06:03.440 --> 06:07.720]  Will you and your family be financially protected if there's another economic meltdown?
[06:07.720 --> 06:11.120]  Like many experts, I believe another devastating crash is coming.
[06:11.120 --> 06:13.440]  I think it's a matter of when, not if.
[06:13.440 --> 06:16.200]  But wait for another crisis that could wipe out your hard-earned money.
[06:16.200 --> 06:21.760]  Do what I did and call United States Gold Vault at 844-541-ALIX.
[06:21.760 --> 06:23.160]  It's a company I trust.
[06:23.160 --> 06:27.800]  They're offering gold and silver coin survival packs that could help safeguard your money
[06:27.800 --> 06:29.040]  in an economic meltdown.
[06:29.040 --> 06:32.360]  I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks.
[06:32.360 --> 06:35.800]  China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is
[06:35.800 --> 06:36.800]  on the move.
[06:36.800 --> 06:41.800]  Gold and silver are recognized worldwide as one of the most stable means of protecting
[06:41.800 --> 06:42.800]  finances.
[06:42.800 --> 06:48.280]  You can delay, call 844-541-ALIX now and get a rugged, double-locked bank bag to securely
[06:48.280 --> 06:50.480]  store your coins, absolutely free.
[06:50.480 --> 06:55.040]  These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority.
[06:55.040 --> 06:57.840]  I personally own these survival packs and you should too.
[06:57.840 --> 07:01.320]  Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALIX now.
[07:01.320 --> 07:04.560]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[07:04.560 --> 07:10.120]  Keep cleansed by InfowarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocoloidal zeolites and
[07:10.120 --> 07:14.120]  organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[07:19.360 --> 07:25.840]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, phobic acid, orange peel, zeolites
[07:25.840 --> 07:28.680]  and others, deep cleanse doesn't hold back.
[07:28.680 --> 07:33.200]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old
[07:33.200 --> 07:37.440]  scientific research that put together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[07:37.440 --> 07:42.400]  Look, there's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary

[07:55.960 --> 08:19.440]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[08:26.960 --> 08:30.440]  Oh my gosh, it's big breaking national news.
[08:30.440 --> 08:33.040]  The New York Times might get a Pulitzer Prize.
[08:33.040 --> 08:38.080]  AT&T is paid by the NSA to spy on you.
[08:38.080 --> 08:40.680]  Of course, we broke that in 1996.
[08:40.680 --> 08:42.800]  Like I said, we broke it.
[08:42.800 --> 08:50.160]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that they would spend up to $5 billion a year
[08:50.160 --> 08:55.720]  paying the telecoms to set up the spy hubs for the NSA and pass all your data through
[08:55.720 --> 08:56.720]  it.
[08:56.720 --> 09:00.200]  Now, it ended up being closer to $10 billion a year by the time that the act was fully
[09:00.200 --> 09:10.960]  implemented under law October 1, 2001, statutorily, one month after 9-11.
[09:10.960 --> 09:20.800]  They had it scripted five years before to have a statutorily be in place the entire grid.
[09:20.800 --> 09:26.760]  One month after 9-11, right when they magically passed all the accompanying legislation to
[09:26.760 --> 09:29.360]  make it legal.
[09:29.360 --> 09:30.360]  You know what that is?
[09:30.360 --> 09:36.280]  It's called continuity of agenda, continuity of purpose.
[09:36.280 --> 09:39.680]  It's how the big telecoms communicate with each other all around the world.
[09:39.680 --> 09:44.960]  When you read the big white papers, you learn that they are building a planet that will
[09:44.960 --> 09:47.240]  not need people.
[09:47.240 --> 09:53.720]  How the future doesn't need us is the term they most often use, where humans are obsolete,
[09:53.720 --> 10:01.240]  obsolescent, the final technotronic technocrat dream.
[10:01.240 --> 10:07.040]  And so I've got big stacks of news here in front of me where men, no matter what color
[10:07.040 --> 10:12.240]  you are, are at record numbers out of the workforce at a level higher than the Great
[10:12.240 --> 10:20.360]  Depression, and that ties into Anheuser-Busch has had the first autonomous 18-wheeler delivery
[10:20.360 --> 10:28.680]  of cold beer in Colorado, and it's being hailed as the greatest thing ever, self-driving trucks'
[10:28.680 --> 10:33.040]  first mission of beer run, isn't that just special?
[10:33.040 --> 10:41.080]  That ties in to the fact that this is an innovation, an economy is being built worldwide that ends
[10:41.080 --> 10:47.160]  the human species as we know it, and that is the officialdom plan.
[10:47.160 --> 10:55.680]  But it doesn't matter to pseudo-intellectuals like John Ronson, the journalist, who talks
[10:55.680 --> 11:06.360]  about how I am the, what's the quote?
[11:06.360 --> 11:13.360]  I am the most, because I was just reading this last night, the most reckless person
[11:13.360 --> 11:28.520]  in the world, the most out of control, and I just sit back and I'm out of control because
[11:28.520 --> 11:35.360]  I talked to NSA whistleblowers in 1996, and they pointed out how the whole system worked,
[11:35.360 --> 11:45.160]  and we've been proven right, and so I'm bad again because it's scary to people that have
[11:45.160 --> 11:50.320]  bet on the system and who believe that the establishment's on their side because I'm
[11:50.320 --> 12:02.120]  exposing to them that it's all a fantasy land.
[12:02.120 --> 12:07.640]  Obamacare, we're now learning, according to Obama, he told us, so you can bet it's
[12:07.640 --> 12:12.880]  going to be a lot higher, is going to boost the average premium, including that of poor
[12:12.880 --> 12:19.600]  people, 25%.
[12:19.600 --> 12:26.600]  And of course, we've already seen massive premium increases, and then of course we have the
[12:26.600 --> 12:32.240]  Hillary Rodham Clinton emails where she says, I want it to go bankrupt, then we'll have
[12:32.240 --> 12:33.240]  a single pair.
[12:33.240 --> 12:34.880]  Well, we always told you that was the plan.
[12:34.880 --> 12:39.120]  In fact, they were so arrogant, they would simultaneously say we were conspiracy theorist
[12:39.120 --> 12:48.720]  or racist or a combination of both, but then Ezekiel Emanuel would go on television, on
[12:48.720 --> 12:51.920]  Fox, I've played it in other channels and say, of course, we're trying to bankrupt
[12:51.920 --> 12:55.800]  health care and bring in a single pair.
[12:55.800 --> 13:02.240]  But isn't some utopian communist single pair, it's big mega corporations that will basically
[13:02.240 --> 13:07.280]  make you go to them and work through their system at prices even higher than what you're
[13:07.280 --> 13:08.280]  seeing now.
[13:08.280 --> 13:14.800]  It is a looting, but because Obama goes on the entertainment shows and acts like he's
[13:14.800 --> 13:19.840]  your little buddy, a lot of these people have childlike minds and they really believe that
[13:19.840 --> 13:31.480]  Obama is their friend and out to help them, despite the fact that it's in all of the emails
[13:31.480 --> 13:41.480]  that they are deceiving us, just like it was in data dump 16 on Podesta's emails that we're
[13:41.480 --> 13:45.400]  going to work with the entire press and the entire polling industry to oversample for
[13:45.400 --> 13:52.440]  Hillary, we want to get ahead of this early and have her dominate right through the election.
[13:52.440 --> 14:00.800]  Now we don't need the Podesta email to see unparalleled fraud by the polling industry
[14:00.800 --> 14:05.080]  as a whole.
[14:05.080 --> 14:08.160]  And the way the polling industry works, if they don't like you, they won't even conduct
[14:08.160 --> 14:16.000]  a poll the way you want it, or they won't even do it fairly, 10 years ago I did quite
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.360]  a bit of polling because it became a way to make points in the news and I would call
[14:21.360 --> 14:28.320]  up Reuters and Gallup and others and I would talk to them and they would come back about
[14:28.320 --> 14:34.320]  a day later with the pollster or a manager and say you're a conspiracy theorist, we will
[14:34.320 --> 14:39.640]  not give you our services and I said well you're not a conspiracy theorist, I understand
[14:39.640 --> 14:44.640]  you control reality, you decide what's real and what isn't, so how about you even set
[14:44.640 --> 14:51.800]  the poll for me, I'm sure you'll do it fair, show me the methodology and they're like no.
[14:51.800 --> 14:58.640]  In fact, I don't remember the actual numbers but I want to say that I would go through
[14:58.640 --> 15:08.120]  maybe 10 polling companies before I'd find one that would even do our poll, now you think
[15:08.120 --> 15:15.840]  about that and I was ready to spend $10,000, $15,000 you name it on a real poll sampling
[15:15.840 --> 15:24.880]  thousands of people, wouldn't do it, so look if Donald Trump was really behind I'd tell
[15:24.880 --> 15:29.560]  you that, he's not, Donald Trump depending on which battleground state you're in, those
[15:29.560 --> 15:37.000]  are the ones that matter, are 5, 10, 15 points ahead and that's why you've got Washington
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.680]  Post polls that show Hillary 12 points ahead of him and you've got CNN polls that show
[15:41.680 --> 15:50.920]  her 25 points ahead, it's because they're not sampling as many Republicans as they
[15:50.920 --> 15:55.120]  do Democrats, it's that simple, a lot of times they'll have Hillary Clinton and ABC News
[15:55.120 --> 16:02.000]  public coverage day, 12 points ahead in Florida, do you know how much they over sample Democrats
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.000]  in the poll, 12%, now that would have them in a dead heat in Florida until you look at
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.880]  all the independent and that's where they really hide the fraud, because you don't know
[16:09.880 --> 16:14.120]  who they're really polling there but that's where they in the past have been caught engaging
[16:14.120 --> 16:20.280]  in the fraud, but they'll argue hey you signed a contract with us, we're a polling company,
[16:20.280 --> 16:25.880]  we conduct it the way we want with our science and our methodology and then you just accept
[16:25.880 --> 16:32.080]  it kind of like you get a Dallas Cowboys ticket, you know ride on the 50 yard line and it says
[16:32.080 --> 16:37.520]  on the back of the ticket this is for entertainment purposes, this game isn't even real and you're
[16:37.520 --> 16:42.840]  not even guaranteed that they'll even be a game, you have all your rights and that's
[16:42.840 --> 16:46.880]  the thing about vaccines or NFL tickets or any of it, they don't want you to read the
[16:46.880 --> 16:56.160]  fine print, well guess what, info wars read the fine print and we have a very corrupt
[16:56.160 --> 17:00.160]  elite in this country that back dictators all over the world, now why is that important,
[17:00.160 --> 17:04.360]  they'll back a dictator, communist, socialist, fascist, they don't care, over an elected
[17:04.360 --> 17:09.600]  government that's even pro-america because they don't want people to be self-determined
[17:09.600 --> 17:13.240]  and the very same elites that don't want other countries to be free, they don't want us to
[17:13.240 --> 17:18.200]  be free, so you can bet whatever they're promoting or whatever they're pushing is about globalism,
[17:18.200 --> 17:23.800]  I have a stack of articles and videos today of illegals recruited by the democratic party
[17:23.800 --> 17:32.360]  openly to knock on doors and to basically tell immigrant groups how to go vote, now
[17:32.360 --> 17:38.960]  can you imagine if in China where they don't even have voting or Mexico if there were people
[17:38.960 --> 17:43.760]  going around beating on doors who weren't citizens, say this is how you should vote,
[17:43.760 --> 17:47.840]  the Mexicans would kill you because that's just normal nationalism, despite all their
[17:47.840 --> 17:54.320]  problems they would attack you, only in America we have stuff like this rubbed in but then
[17:54.320 --> 18:01.800]  it gets more fun, it's now back in the news that the security force of the private corporation
[18:01.800 --> 18:08.160]  that founded modern Europe under the Marshall plan, the OECD, that is the root of the world
[18:08.160 --> 18:15.040]  government, that's it, the Robert Barons in 1945 set up the OECD and did the reconstruction
[18:15.040 --> 18:18.600]  of Europe, Europe's never gotten out from under its control, that's why the EU was
[18:18.600 --> 18:25.680]  put in place without voting, it's a dictatorship, they have voting but the ministers aren't
[18:25.680 --> 18:30.880]  in control, that's why they've had four Goldman Sachs presidents appointed as presidents and
[18:30.880 --> 18:36.000]  prime ministers in Europe in places like Greece and Italy just the last few years, I mean
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.600]  they're in the news saying it's a new form of government, technocracy where you don't
[18:40.600 --> 18:46.800]  elect your leaders, they say it openly and I'll sit there with some journalist who begs
[18:46.800 --> 18:50.280]  for an interview and promises and swears it's not a hit piece and then I'll tell them this
[18:50.280 --> 18:54.680]  stuff and show them quotes and their eyes glazed over and so that's back in the news
[18:54.680 --> 19:00.400]  today that we have all these foreign observers here, with the feds making sure Trump and
[19:00.400 --> 19:05.840]  the Russians don't steal it but then again we live in La La land, there's no such thing
[19:05.840 --> 19:10.280]  as fraud, it's insane, doesn't exist but Russian takeover of the election is imminent, oh my
[19:10.280 --> 19:18.880]  god thank goodness, the security force of the OECD, that's like the Pinkerton Railroad
[19:18.880 --> 19:28.600]  men of Europe, they're here to run our election and Homeland Security is federalizing it,
[19:28.600 --> 19:33.160]  it's a setup, US officials warn that Russians will undermine elections with fake documents
[19:33.160 --> 19:37.360]  showing voter fraud, that's right ladies and gentlemen there's no voter fraud even though
[19:37.360 --> 19:41.000]  it's on local radio and WOAI that the machines are all turning off and votes are flipping
[19:41.000 --> 19:44.480]  and we have all these witnesses and our stories on Drudge, none of that's happening, there's
[19:44.480 --> 19:48.640]  never a problem, tell they might even take Texas and just give it to Hillary, they might
[19:48.640 --> 19:54.040]  give her all 50 states, why not give her 100% of the vote, hell 200%, I mean we've already
[19:54.040 --> 19:58.960]  got the emails where they admit they're stealing the election, they just hope the public doesn't
[19:58.960 --> 20:05.480]  see that, we use mobile devices right against our bodies every day but growing scientific

[23:38.720 --> 23:42.640]  heritage, and beef was for supper.

[23:56.480 --> 23:59.080]  Revelation, the movie.info.
[23:59.080 --> 24:06.080]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[24:29.400 --> 24:32.800]  Bottom line, they are getting ready to steal this election big time.
[24:32.800 --> 24:34.800]  We're 13 days out.
[24:34.800 --> 24:38.640]  14 of you know by Fox's numbers, they count the day of the election November 8th as another
[24:38.640 --> 24:43.480]  day, so I mean I guess in a way they're right, it's like 14 days.
[24:43.480 --> 24:49.960]  It'll be 14 days until we're really knowing how the voting's going.
[24:49.960 --> 24:53.960]  They tried to put out this big hoax in every major publication out there in the last month
[24:53.960 --> 24:57.320]  that well when early voting comes in, it's going to show Hillary clearly dominating.
[24:57.320 --> 25:02.600]  And that hasn't happened yet despite all their ballot stuffing and bussing people around
[25:02.600 --> 25:05.000]  to vote over and over again that's on record.
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.720]  We have it from the top election officials, the head of the New York elections, we have
[25:08.720 --> 25:11.880]  it from the people actually stealing the election, then we have the emails about stealing the
[25:11.880 --> 25:15.560]  election, and then we have the emails about faking the polls, and we have the emails about
[25:15.560 --> 25:20.320]  keeping the public dumb and making us poor and bankrupting the healthcare system to screw
[25:20.320 --> 25:21.320]  us even more.
[25:21.320 --> 25:26.000]  See that's the thing, it's always get you in a worse position than preside over the
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.760]  crisis and get more power.
[25:28.760 --> 25:32.360]  That's what's so frustrating, and they have all these pseudo-intellectuals and followers
[25:32.360 --> 25:40.840]  and cowards that sit there and preside over the destruction of this nation, and they all
[25:40.840 --> 25:45.400]  just go along with it because they're not innovative, they can't build their own system.
[25:45.400 --> 25:49.760]  All they know how to do is say yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, and all our corrupt leaders
[25:49.760 --> 25:53.600]  can do is say yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, the communist Chinese and every other evil
[25:53.600 --> 26:00.760]  organization until there is no bottom to how far we could fall.
[26:00.760 --> 26:05.280]  But I know starting three years ago, my parents got kicked off their insurance they'd had
[26:05.280 --> 26:10.000]  for 30 years that they never even used, and it doubled in prices, and then it tripled,
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.280]  and then everybody else right down the line, including people that are right above the
[26:15.280 --> 26:21.280]  poverty line, are getting the fines, up to $5,000 a year for not having it, and the employers
[26:21.280 --> 26:28.440]  are getting it, and you go in to try to get the insurance, because thanks to Obamacare,
[26:28.440 --> 26:33.720]  GCN had insurance for some people, I had it there for like 18 years, got rid of it, so
[26:33.720 --> 26:37.440]  I went out and got my own insurance, and it was way higher, and now they're telling me
[26:37.440 --> 26:42.760]  in letters it's going to go up more, and so I've gone out and shopped around, and no
[26:42.760 --> 26:57.360]  matter what I do, I'm going to pay a lot more. It's the gullibility of the Democrat voter,
[26:57.360 --> 27:00.120]  Lord knows the Republicans are gullible as well, but the Democrats are a whole nother
[27:00.120 --> 27:06.160]  animal. I've told the story many times, but used to I would go swim almost every day when
[27:06.160 --> 27:10.000]  it was warm enough at one of the biggest freshwater pools in this country called Barton Springs
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.640]  in downtown Austin, and everybody knew who I was out there, and they have a lot of life
[27:15.640 --> 27:25.480]  cards, sometimes as many as 20 on duty, and right before Obamacare was being rammed through,
[27:25.480 --> 27:29.000]  I was in the paper and stuff, fighting it, and you know, that was how I was so racist
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.560]  and evil, because this was a black man, and I didn't want him to succeed, I mean, this
[27:32.560 --> 27:39.980]  is just crazy talk, and I remember the people that worked there started getting grumpy towards
[27:39.980 --> 27:44.800]  me and not talking to me, which was fine, and then as soon as Obamacare went through
[27:44.800 --> 27:48.520]  and they all got cut to part time, and they didn't get the free healthcare they had been
[27:48.520 --> 27:54.400]  promised, they all, I mean, when I say all, I mean, dozens of people came over and apologized
[27:54.400 --> 27:59.280]  to me, and including city workers that would go there and swim, because it's like the government
[27:59.280 --> 28:05.840]  hang out, and go, my God, I'm being cut, my prices are going up, and then I don't really
[28:05.840 --> 28:12.800]  go to the hospital, but if I get an infection, or you know, or I think I pull a muscle, I
[28:12.800 --> 28:18.640]  go one of these clinics, I've been going the same one for 20 years, because I know the
[28:18.640 --> 28:22.000]  doctors and people that worked there, and their listeners, and I sit there in the waiting
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.240]  room for like an hour, like you do sometimes, you go to a clinic, and I watch all these
[28:27.240 --> 28:31.720]  old women go up to counter, but for some reason, the first time I went in after Obamacare
[28:31.720 --> 28:34.880]  went in, it was mainly old black women, for whatever reason we're in this clinic, I was
[28:34.880 --> 28:38.400]  going to, they'd walk over, they were getting their checkup, they were getting their medicine,
[28:38.400 --> 28:43.520]  they were like, but that's not right, it used to be, it used to be $40, it's an honor,
[28:43.520 --> 28:48.040]  they'd be whispering, they'd be, why, and I'd be turning the TV down so I could listen,
[28:48.040 --> 28:52.920]  and they'd be like, oh, I'm sorry, man, it's the Affordable Care Act, it's not us, it's
[28:52.920 --> 29:01.360]  just what it is now, it's gonna hurt me, and who was really hurting was me, to see, I care,
[29:01.360 --> 29:07.240]  I don't want to screw over some old lady, let me tell you something, you read these
[29:07.240 --> 29:13.040]  WikiLeaks, what Hillary thinks about you, you basement-dwelling baristas, you underemployed
[29:13.040 --> 29:19.720]  dumbass scum, she's gonna rule you and suck what you got right out, this is a woman that
[29:19.720 --> 29:26.600]  steals everything everywhere she goes, a kleptocrat, she's a kleptomaniac, I mean, and I harp on
[29:26.600 --> 29:32.760]  that because that's confirmed and admitted, she wants to hurt you, and she's going to
[29:32.760 --> 29:38.160]  hurt you bad, you think you've been hurt so far, the breaking of this country has just
[29:38.160 --> 29:45.640]  begun, they want to make you a permanent, dumb-down, poor people to control, they want
[29:45.640 --> 30:00.320]  you, permanent peons, peons, serfs on the land, we're on the march, the empires on the
[30:00.320 --> 30:03.920]  run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network, hey there, this is Joe Biggs with infowars.com
[30:03.920 --> 30:08.240]  with a fun and exciting report by the sun, he virtually rubbed a microtch, woman sexually
[30:08.240 --> 30:13.080]  assaulted it in virtual reality, the VR version was trying out the new technology for the
[30:13.080 --> 30:19.360]  first time with a game called Weaver, with a man using the pseudonym Big Bro 442 virtually
[30:19.360 --> 30:23.800]  grotes her, we have decided not to name the woman, she wrote, in between a wave of zombies
[30:23.800 --> 30:29.440]  and daemons to shoot down, I was hanging out next to Big Bro 442, suddenly Big Bro 442's
[30:29.440 --> 30:34.280]  disembodied helmet faced me dead on, and he started virtually rubbing my chest, the woman's
[30:34.280 --> 30:39.360]  first foray into virtual reality started off well as he experienced one me over, lock stocking
[30:39.360 --> 30:44.880]  barrel, but just after 3 minutes in the virtual world, Big Bro 442 showed up and ruined everything,
[30:44.880 --> 30:51.320]  the woman cried stop, to deter the heavy tech breather, Big Bro 442 came back at her again
[30:51.320 --> 30:55.640]  and she added, women after all are supposed to be cool and take on any form of sexual
[30:55.640 --> 30:59.320]  harassment with a laugh, but I still told him to stop, you can find more reports like
[30:59.320 --> 31:14.080]  thisinfowars.com, I've been working all day, I took a couple hours off coaching basketball,
[31:14.080 --> 31:18.800]  I get in here at 830, I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was going
[31:18.800 --> 31:22.440]  to make it, and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview, I got my bottle of brain
[31:22.440 --> 31:26.680]  force right there, I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later, it's like bing, everything
[31:26.680 --> 31:32.040]  just kind of clears up, got 4 and a half stars, people really love it, read about it, find
[31:32.040 --> 31:36.360]  out why, third party, nutraceutical sites give it such high praise, because it really

[32:06.520 --> 32:11.480]  talking about in the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid, the potential

[34:01.480 --> 34:08.640]  who we have in triplicate via WikiLeaks and other sources, it's being done by people that
[34:08.640 --> 34:15.040]  are engaged in this activity consciously, now I want to go over Obamacare and the latest
[34:15.040 --> 34:21.560]  developments with that, but I want to explain to everybody, we have the WikiLeaks, we have
[34:21.560 --> 34:31.600]  Ezekiel Emanuel, we have the congressional testimony, they always wanted to throw out
[34:31.600 --> 34:36.640]  the old crop of doctors that made the United States the best healthcare system in the world,
[34:36.640 --> 34:41.240]  so that you would adopt the socialist model where there's a doctor on every corner but
[34:41.240 --> 34:47.720]  there's no MRI machines, there's no drugs, there's no treatment, you hurt your knee,
[34:47.720 --> 34:58.080]  here's a cane, going blind, here's a cane, got the flu, go home and die, and this is
[34:58.080 --> 35:04.240]  what big pharma wants that runs healthcare, so this is their plan, this is their modus
[35:04.240 --> 35:09.040]  operandi, and understand something, that's not our opinion, I'm going to show you the
[35:09.040 --> 35:15.120]  WikiLeaks, you can google it for yourself, WikiLeaks, Hillary wanted Obamacare to fail,
[35:15.120 --> 35:25.280]  but what's frustrating is, when I'm listening to local news, I don't even hear, conservative
[35:25.280 --> 35:28.920]  talk show hosts point out that it was supposed to be free for most people and be the cost
[35:28.920 --> 35:32.680]  of a phone bill for others and was going to massively reduce prices and give us all these
[35:32.680 --> 35:41.600]  wonderful choices when they knew the entire time that that's not what it was, okay, so
[35:41.600 --> 35:47.240]  I'm going to get to all of that in a presentation and then you're welcome once we put it out
[35:47.240 --> 35:51.480]  in the podcast or put it on YouTube or Facebook, you know, tonight to take the clip that we're
[35:51.480 --> 35:55.240]  about to break down and send it to friends and family and just say, listen, do you want
[35:55.240 --> 35:58.960]  to be caught in the rest of your life because here's the deal, Hillary gets in, she's going
[35:58.960 --> 36:03.680]  to complete her program and that's in the emails, now we told you this back at the time
[36:03.680 --> 36:11.880]  because we understand their blueprint, but now it's confirmed and I got to be honest
[36:11.880 --> 36:18.560]  with you, it's hard to believe they're this diabolical, I mean, even for me and I understand
[36:18.560 --> 36:24.120]  this is scary stuff to talk about, but it's what's happening, they know Obamacare will
[36:24.120 --> 36:28.080]  bankrupt the economy, they know it'll shut down small businesses and medium size, they
[36:28.080 --> 36:34.560]  know that's their admitted program, I keep trying to explain this people, they want you
[36:34.560 --> 36:42.400]  broke, they want you destitute, they do not want you to be successful, they want total
[36:42.400 --> 36:50.400]  class warfare, now before I go any further, we're running a special, it's going to end,
[36:50.400 --> 36:55.160]  I think Friday is about to sell out of it, but luckily more is coming in a few weeks,

[39:24.720 --> 39:29.760]  you know and say, hey, this is true, you know, behind the scenes, reportage and cutting edge
[39:29.760 --> 39:34.800]  analysis, this is the guy they're demonizing, this is the organization that killer everybody's
[39:34.800 --> 39:39.480]  attacking, don't believe the mainstream media, find out for yourself what we're really covering,
[39:39.480 --> 39:47.320]  because you'll find the reason they're so scared of us is we just have a memory and
[39:47.320 --> 39:53.120]  all we're doing is pointing out what they said they were going to do versus what they've
[39:53.120 --> 39:57.360]  done and some people say, oh, they're always corrupt, you can't change that, no, things
[39:57.360 --> 40:01.960]  have gotten more corrupt, they're coming to a head, we're on the verge of a financial
[40:01.960 --> 40:07.960]  blow up, there's all these wars starting, all major analysts agree with me on that,
[40:07.960 --> 40:13.280]  it's incontrovertible, we need to have an awakening about this so we don't go over the
[40:13.280 --> 40:18.720]  edge of the abyss, another mainstream refrain they put out is Alex Jones is always saying
[40:18.720 --> 40:22.320]  the world's about to end, no, I'm saying don't listen to the big main line church is saying
[40:22.320 --> 40:28.720]  it's about to end, we can fix it with God's help, I'm saying we can stop major world war,
[40:28.720 --> 40:32.240]  we don't have to fund jihadis, we don't have to open our borders, we don't have to deindustrialize,
[40:32.240 --> 40:37.280]  we don't have to attack the family, so again they misrepresent what we say because they're
[40:37.280 --> 40:41.840]  liars and they set up there securely thinking because they're part of the establishment
[40:41.840 --> 40:45.960]  or one of these that it's okay to lie, but they're speaking to a smaller and smaller
[40:45.960 --> 40:51.280]  crowd, we're speaking to a larger and larger crowd.
[40:51.280 --> 40:57.720]  So it's coming to a head, Gerald Solin says coming up today, he hadn't been on in months,
[40:57.720 --> 41:02.760]  I'm told he's wound up, he has a big presentation he wants to put on showing Michelle Obama
[41:02.760 --> 41:08.680]  and her lauded speech against Trump for an edited 11-year-old tape which the Bush nephew
[41:08.680 --> 41:12.880]  admitted he'd go to him into over an hour conversation and to step together into three
[41:12.880 --> 41:16.680]  minutes, goading him and goading him and telling me sex stories, telling me sex stories, it
[41:16.680 --> 41:21.840]  was all set up folks, him losing his job and all that, it's just a foil to divert by that
[41:21.840 --> 41:29.000]  guy's CIA, just like the sun came up this morning and Gerald wants to show these rappers
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.440]  and play some clips of them, it's very vulgar, but it's been a presidential race issue,
[41:33.440 --> 41:36.680]  these folks meet at the White House with Michelle and Obama, they go to parties together, they
[41:36.680 --> 41:43.440]  hang out, word is they use drugs, that's going on big time.
[41:43.440 --> 41:48.520]  And the thing is they're hypocrites, I mean you got these rappers talking about I'm on
[41:48.520 --> 41:53.200]  the yacht with the champagne, give her a Molly, knock her out, she didn't know what hit her,
[41:53.200 --> 42:03.160]  they were talking about raping women and imagine if Trump had songs about flipping women pills
[42:03.160 --> 42:08.440]  with their champagne so they pass out so you can date rape them, imagine if Trump was hanging
[42:08.440 --> 42:13.520]  out with folks like that and my thing is we never even raised this about Obama, but they
[42:13.520 --> 42:18.360]  want to sit there and raise it about Trump, let's get that straight, because every time
[42:18.360 --> 42:23.400]  they put out some twisted BS and we respond they go oh don't attack Obama for this, well
[42:23.400 --> 42:30.720]  you're the ones bringing it up.
[42:30.720 --> 42:36.200]  And then Mark Moreno is coming on with huge climate tax, global government info, Paul
[42:36.200 --> 42:40.440]  Watson always informative, host the fourth hour today, oh and Roger Stone is popping
[42:40.440 --> 42:46.480]  in at 1.30 central, 2.30 Eastern, show in the middle of the third hour, that's coming
[42:46.480 --> 42:51.440]  up as well, all right.
[42:51.440 --> 42:56.680]  I want to go to these Obamacare clips right now, if you're a new viewer you just tuned
[42:56.680 --> 43:01.080]  in, let's put back on screen the WikiLeaks from two weeks ago, I think it was like data
[43:01.080 --> 43:08.680]  dump eight or nine on Podesta's emails, Hillary wants Obamacare to fail, don't worry staff,
[43:08.680 --> 43:12.400]  stop being freaked out by it, this is designed to wreck the economy, it's designed to create
[43:12.400 --> 43:18.280]  a train wreck and then we'll take back over and come in with an even bigger screw job,
[43:18.280 --> 43:23.960]  so we'll put that back up on screen for TV viewers, but anybody can Google WikiLeaks,
[43:23.960 --> 43:28.800]  Hillary wanted Obamacare to fail, okay.
[43:28.800 --> 43:36.360]  We'll scroll that up, everybody to see it, WikiLeaks, Hillary wants Obamacare to unravel,
[43:36.360 --> 43:40.360]  the email suggests Clinton rooting for Affordable Care Act to collapse, why?
[43:40.360 --> 43:46.960]  To get the full plan they always wanted, and we told everybody this day one, and since
[43:46.960 --> 43:52.000]  I talk about it, let's go ahead and play Ezekiel Emanuel if we can first, we got Charlie Rose
[43:52.000 --> 43:55.720]  a few weeks ago laughing at everybody with the lawyers and writers that helped write
[43:55.720 --> 43:59.800]  the different terms like if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor and the price
[43:59.800 --> 44:04.680]  of a phone bill and also their BS, and of course Obama originally came out and said
[44:04.680 --> 44:09.920]  he never said that two years later, but then we had the clips, that's how stupid they think
[44:09.920 --> 44:13.960]  you are, and they're hoping you're not going out and finding it, well what about when your
[44:13.960 --> 44:18.920]  premium goes way up and now you've got to buy it, boy only in America would insurance
[44:18.920 --> 44:22.080]  companies get a law written where you have to buy something from private groups that
[44:22.080 --> 44:25.240]  they can charge you whatever they want, you think they're going to get together and check
[44:25.240 --> 44:33.000]  up your prices, gee no thinking now involved, you've seen them double, triple, this announcement
[44:33.000 --> 44:38.320]  of oh it's going to go up 25% this year, that's just some vague number, that's on the low end
[44:38.320 --> 44:45.200]  of your working class blue collar, it's going to go up 25%, if you're middle class or middle
[44:45.200 --> 44:50.920]  class it's going to just continue until you stop putting up with it, Thomas Jefferson
[44:50.920 --> 44:55.960]  was asked what's the level of tyranny that's possible, and he said the level you will accept
[44:55.960 --> 45:02.880]  and put up with, and so people just keep wondering why it's getting so bad because we're a nation
[45:02.880 --> 45:14.880]  of sheep, a nation of soft, cowardly, feeble sports fans, who know how to get upset if
[45:14.880 --> 45:20.600]  someone tells someone in the office their dress looks nice, we're a nation of basically
[45:20.600 --> 45:26.240]  three year olds now, and the states are mommy, except mommy basically breezes like cattle
[45:26.240 --> 45:32.000]  and we're what's for dinner, you know in the New World Order it didn't beef, that's for
[45:32.000 --> 45:38.800]  dinner, it's dehumanization, so here is Ezekiel Emanuel, this is three years ago laughing
[45:38.800 --> 45:42.840]  at everyone right after it got passed, because they all had a celebration after it passed,
[45:42.840 --> 45:49.160]  they didn't want you to know till it passed, that it was a global tax, here it is, people
[45:49.160 --> 45:52.400]  who knew the law as it was being written knew the president wasn't telling the truth, the
[45:52.400 --> 45:56.600]  grandfather provision written into the law itself was too narrow, and frankly they wrote
[45:56.600 --> 46:00.800]  a regulation intentionally trying to get people out of the individual market, they want the
[46:00.800 --> 46:04.960]  people to go into the exchanges, because there's a lot of people in the individual market, the
[46:04.960 --> 46:09.200]  whole point of the exchanges is to close down the individual insurance market over time,
[46:09.200 --> 46:15.000]  they wanted to move millions of people into the exchange, insurance companies don't like
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.280]  the individual market as it's constructed, they see the future, that individual market
[46:19.280 --> 46:22.760]  is going away, they don't want to invest in it, that's why the president said, let me
[46:22.760 --> 46:27.320]  finish, let me switch, this is just like self driving cars, I'm not against self driving
[46:27.320 --> 46:32.720]  cars, that's what you choose, Uber came out a year ago, which is also run by Rahm Emanuel's
[46:32.720 --> 46:38.720]  brother, you cannot make this stuff up, talk about villains, and they said, by 2025 there
[46:38.720 --> 46:42.160]  will be no cars that are not autonomous, and we're going to have a global monopoly, because
[46:42.160 --> 46:45.480]  we're going to work with the government, to only let our company operate, that is our
[46:45.480 --> 46:50.360]  investment plan, and billions flows in, China says, you got a deal, you want a monopoly
[46:50.360 --> 46:58.600]  in China, come on in, oh but it's okay, because the Emanuel's are liberals, this is the guy
[46:58.600 --> 47:04.800]  who famously, in the Clinton administration, whenever they were talking about democrats
[47:04.800 --> 47:09.200]  that weren't doing what they were told, that would take a knife at the table, and start
[47:09.200 --> 47:14.440]  stabbing it, breaking the table, breaking the knife, screaming death, murder, ah, just
[47:14.440 --> 47:20.280]  start in front of everyone, and then when he, because he was only on the sidelines during
[47:20.280 --> 47:24.520]  the Clinton administration, with Obama, in the first administration is what I'm going
[47:24.520 --> 47:30.000]  to get to, he would then tell Obama to shut up in cabinet meetings, I'm in command, and
[47:30.000 --> 47:37.120]  Obama would do what he said, let me tell you, the Emanuel's are mafia, and you know I was
[47:37.120 --> 47:40.480]  thinking, they're always trying to claim that if I talk about world government and corruption,
[47:40.480 --> 47:44.800]  I'm anti-Semitic, there's mafia's of all different stripes and groups, but since you
[47:44.800 --> 47:49.280]  want to talk about it, the Emanuel's are Jewish mafia, so there you go, but I mean it's not
[47:49.280 --> 47:53.520]  the Jews are bad, it's just they are the head of the Jewish mafia in the United States,
[47:53.520 --> 47:57.720]  they run Uber, they run the healthcare, they're going to scam you, they're going to hurt you,
[47:57.720 --> 48:01.560]  and then they got weirdos that they're allied with, like George Soros, who's a literal Nazi
[48:01.560 --> 48:06.400]  collaborator, and then you got Marilyn Albright, who was a Nazi collaborator, her dad was,
[48:06.400 --> 48:11.440]  being up Jews, I mean it's like, if being against Jews that are weirdo Nazi collaborators
[48:11.440 --> 48:16.200]  and gangsters makes me anti-Semitic, then fine, I'm not against Jews, but at a certain
[48:16.200 --> 48:20.520]  point when you people call you out, I've been called out hundreds of newspapers the last
[48:20.520 --> 48:25.480]  month as being anti-Semitic, because I talk about a global corporate combine, well why
[48:25.480 --> 48:31.520]  are you labeling the TPP Jewish, I mean it's got Jews involved in it, just like it's got
[48:31.520 --> 48:38.000]  everybody else, it's communist Chinese, global government, Japan, I mean all these groups,
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.560]  but again, I'm going to skip this break, it's injected into it that you must be anti-Semitic,
[48:43.560 --> 48:47.600]  so I was just sitting back I go, well let me, let me then I guess I better do some exposes
[48:47.600 --> 48:55.160]  on the Jewish mafia, and you know a guy foaming at the mouth with knives at cabinet meetings
[48:55.160 --> 49:05.440]  basically threatening the president, totally crazed, who's got his fingers in everything
[49:05.440 --> 49:11.920]  screwing us over, I mean how do you come up with this stuff, how, well where does this
[49:11.920 --> 49:22.040]  come from, why, it's disgusting, so you just heard Ezekiel Emmanuel saying of course these
[49:22.040 --> 49:25.440]  insurance companies know the way we're going, just like they're announcing there won't be
[49:25.440 --> 49:28.560]  anybody driving cars anymore, because the insurance companies which are owned by the
[49:28.560 --> 49:31.920]  big banks are going to raise your premium until you've got to go driverless, and then
[49:31.920 --> 49:36.400]  all the new cars coming out already have driverless car software in them boys and girls, so you
[49:36.400 --> 49:39.840]  pay for the stuff you don't even want, and you pay for your own enslavement and they're
[49:39.840 --> 49:43.160]  going to tax you by the mile and it's all been announced, everything I told you 20 years
[49:43.160 --> 49:48.480]  ago is now public, and they say how did you know 20 years ago, because it was in the big
[49:48.480 --> 49:53.200]  tech publications, it was in the MIT quarterly, it was in all the documents, and I have NSA
[49:53.200 --> 49:59.760]  whistleblower sources, but I don't even need anymore, it's all passé, it's all out in
[49:59.760 --> 50:07.480]  the open, and we've got horrible communist Chinese government mafia, with horrible Islamic
[50:07.480 --> 50:12.760]  mafia, with horrible German socialist mafia, and horrible French mafia, and the Islamic
[50:12.760 --> 50:18.160]  mafia, and the Jewish mafia, and just all these Russian mafias, and Italian mafias,
[50:18.160 --> 50:24.760]  and all this CIA wasp mafias, and it's just organized crime that doesn't want a free
[50:24.760 --> 50:29.520]  market, and they come in with this Obamacare and double and triple and screw people over
[50:29.520 --> 50:37.520]  and cut 35 million people to part time, and then sit there and say, shut up, you're anti-Semitic.
[50:37.520 --> 50:42.480]  We're going under a world government, we're going under a TPP, we're going under unelected
[50:42.480 --> 50:46.800]  systems, and no amount of BS changes that.
[50:46.800 --> 50:51.160]  No amount of BS changes the fact they're getting ready to steal the election for Hillary Clinton.
[50:51.160 --> 50:57.080]  You've got Andrea Mitchell married to Alan Greenspan, who ran the country, and who says
[50:57.080 --> 51:01.240]  the Federal Reserve is above the law, and outside of government, but is a governmental
[51:01.240 --> 51:03.720]  institution, which it's not.
[51:03.720 --> 51:08.400]  With Hillary last week, with her chief of staff, with her press secretary, handing
[51:08.400 --> 51:12.840]  her the phone, she nods and then reads the question about, oh, he's bullying women.
[51:12.840 --> 51:17.040]  I mean, it's so rigged, you've got the Federal Reserve, and the media, and Hillary, just
[51:17.040 --> 51:23.920]  all there like we're idiots right in front of us, and then they've got such a flaming
[51:23.920 --> 51:28.600]  heart on to destroy America, destroy what's left of Christianity and the Renaissance, that
[51:28.600 --> 51:33.800]  literally led the way of human liberty, that they've branded the West as what's evil, and
[51:33.800 --> 51:41.560]  the West is what's bad, and they're bringing in the most horrible backwards 80% men, military
[51:41.560 --> 51:47.160]  aged men, into the United States and Europe to do God knows what, all because it's incompatible
[51:47.160 --> 51:54.040]  and they want to just mutilate and trash everything.
[51:54.040 --> 52:00.040]  Let's go to the next one.
[52:00.040 --> 52:06.240]  Here's Obama promises lower health insurance premiums by $2,500 per year.
[52:06.240 --> 52:07.240]  Remember that?
[52:07.240 --> 52:11.400]  Well, now you're going to get 25% increases every year if you're lucky on the low end.
[52:11.400 --> 52:15.960]  So, remember this, they hate the fact that we go back on the time machine, here's Obama
[52:15.960 --> 52:19.520]  a few years ago.
[52:19.520 --> 52:26.360]  To lower your premiums by up to $2,500 per family per year, we will start by reducing
[52:26.360 --> 52:30.200]  premiums by as much as $2,500 per family.
[52:30.200 --> 52:34.960]  Here's what change is saying to people who already have health insurance and the employers
[52:34.960 --> 52:37.800]  who are providing it will work to lower your premiums.
[52:37.800 --> 52:38.800]  That's enough.
[52:38.800 --> 52:41.280]  There's no need to have him say it 18 more times.
[52:41.280 --> 52:47.480]  Here's the headline, Obamacare premiums to go up by double digits in the lowest bracket.
[52:47.480 --> 52:50.320]  That's McClatchy Associated Press.
[52:50.320 --> 52:52.240]  They'll just respond and say conspiracy theory.
[52:52.240 --> 52:55.520]  Okay, let's go ahead and go, because you know, that's all you got to do to be intellectual,
[52:55.520 --> 52:56.720]  just say conspiracy theory.
[52:56.720 --> 53:02.000]  CBS anchors confused just a few years later about why Obamacare premiums are skyrocketing.
[53:02.000 --> 53:03.000]  Here it is.
[53:03.000 --> 53:09.600]  Billions of Americans will face big price hikes and fewer choices when Obamacare open
[53:09.600 --> 53:10.960]  enrollment begins.
[53:10.960 --> 53:15.160]  The government says the cost of mid-level health plans next year will increase by an
[53:15.160 --> 53:17.320]  average of 25%.
[53:17.320 --> 53:20.520]  That will hit consumers in 39 states.
[53:20.520 --> 53:23.080]  Major carriers are dropping out in some markets.
[53:23.080 --> 53:28.080]  About one in five consumers will be able to choose from only one provider.
[53:28.080 --> 53:32.680]  Government numbers show about two and a half million Americans not currently enrolled could
[53:32.680 --> 53:37.520]  be eligible for subsidies to offset cost increases.
[53:37.520 --> 53:41.320]  That's their whitewash numbers, but you know, since we mentioned Rose, I don't mean to throw
[53:41.320 --> 53:45.520]  you guys off, I've only got five more clips, can we go back to Rose two weeks ago with
[53:45.520 --> 53:49.480]  the White House writers on celebrating, laughing, and giggling?
[53:49.480 --> 53:52.840]  I mean, it's not as powerful audio-wise.
[53:52.840 --> 53:56.400]  It's more powerful if your TV viewer can actually see it in FullWars.com.
[53:56.400 --> 53:58.680]  But it is redonkulous.
[53:58.680 --> 54:04.120]  This is just like river laughing and saying, thank God you're dumb and all the rest of
[54:04.120 --> 54:05.120]  it.
[54:05.120 --> 54:06.120]  Here is Charlie Rose.
[54:06.120 --> 54:10.440]  The point is, do you have an equal impact on serious speeches because it's about style,
[54:10.440 --> 54:12.880]  use of language, you said?
[54:12.880 --> 54:18.000]  I really like, I was very, the joke speech is the most fun part of this, but the things
[54:18.000 --> 54:24.680]  I'm the most proud of were the more serious speeches, I think, healthcare, economic speeches.
[54:24.680 --> 54:29.320]  And I think, love it, wrote the line about, if you like your insurance, you can keep it.
[54:29.320 --> 54:30.320]  How dare you?
[54:30.320 --> 54:38.160]  And it's all these know-it-alls who've inherited the United States, who've been, who've taken
[54:38.160 --> 54:42.680]  over power, and then they just enjoy screwing everyone.
[54:42.680 --> 54:50.520]  And by the way, I didn't go far enough with a manual, Rahm Emanuel and his brother being
[54:50.520 --> 54:54.920]  basically Jewish mafia in my research for you, Rahm Emanuel's dad, and again, everybody
[54:54.920 --> 55:00.480]  knows I'm not an Israel basher, I'm just saying, this guy's the worst of the worst.
[55:00.480 --> 55:10.120]  His dad led the Israeli force that would do false flags, this is in the Jerusalem Post.
[55:10.120 --> 55:14.840]  He led the group that basically founded Israel, but the way they did it was staging terror
[55:14.840 --> 55:18.720]  attacks to blame the Arabs.
[55:18.720 --> 55:22.480]  Like bombing the King David hotel and stuff like that.
[55:22.480 --> 55:26.120]  So I just thought I'd add that in there for you, just to understand who Rahm Emanuel
[55:26.120 --> 55:27.120]  is.
[55:27.120 --> 55:30.960]  Since they, I mean, if I'm going to get accused of being anti-Semitic, I'm not as well just,
[55:30.960 --> 55:36.240]  you know, actually expose that I am anti-mafia.
[55:36.240 --> 55:41.280]  I don't like the Chinese mafia, the Italian mafia, the Jewish mafia, the Irish mafia.
[55:41.280 --> 55:44.320]  The mafia never flew too well down here in Texas because people wouldn't put up with
[55:44.320 --> 55:46.600]  it.
[55:46.600 --> 55:51.680]  And I guess I'm just a throwback here, but I'm not putting up with it.
[55:51.680 --> 55:57.760]  And it's disgusting to watch these different mafias all involved in a gang rape of this
[55:57.760 --> 55:58.760]  Republic.
[55:58.760 --> 56:03.280]  Now, President Obama claims premium rates increases are not due to Obamacare.
[56:03.280 --> 56:05.680]  This is just a few days ago.
[56:05.680 --> 56:06.680]  It's not Obamacare.
[56:06.680 --> 56:08.240]  No, enough of you didn't get registered.
[56:08.240 --> 56:10.400]  You didn't do what you were supposed to.
[56:10.400 --> 56:11.560]  It's your fault.
[56:11.560 --> 56:13.080]  Don't worry, Hillary's coming in though.
[56:13.080 --> 56:14.920]  You'll finally get the freebie with her.
[56:14.920 --> 56:16.640]  It is.
[56:16.640 --> 56:20.720]  And then in some cases insurers just set their prices too low at the outset because they
[56:20.720 --> 56:23.760]  didn't know what the insurance pool was going to look like.
[56:23.760 --> 56:26.600]  And then they started losing money.
[56:26.600 --> 56:32.560]  And so now they've decided to significantly increase premiums in some states.
[56:32.560 --> 56:38.120]  That's these premium increases in some of the states in the marketplace that sometimes
[56:38.120 --> 56:42.480]  attracts negative headlines.
[56:42.480 --> 56:47.460]  However, these premium increases won't impact most of the people who are buying insurance
[56:47.460 --> 56:52.600]  through the marketplace because even when premiums go up, the tax credits go up to offset
[56:52.600 --> 56:54.280]  the increases.
[56:54.280 --> 57:01.000]  So people who qualify for tax credits, they may not even notice their premiums went up
[57:01.000 --> 57:02.000]  because...
[57:02.000 --> 57:03.000]  All right, but that's enough.
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.760]  You know, the numbers they just gave you on CBS News are the cooked ones.
[57:05.760 --> 57:06.840]  It's much worse than what they're saying.
[57:06.840 --> 57:09.760]  This is more bamboozling, more con games.
[57:09.760 --> 57:14.360]  In the first year of Obamacare, global insurance company profits went up over 40% just on the
[57:14.360 --> 57:17.200]  US's back.
[57:17.200 --> 57:22.640]  And CPAs in the last decade, they passed laws that would say they are held accountable
[57:22.640 --> 57:24.880]  if you get audited.
[57:24.880 --> 57:27.360]  So you go into CPAs, you say, I want all these deductions.
[57:27.360 --> 57:31.800]  They say, get another CPA and you can't find CPAs that will give them to you.
[57:31.800 --> 57:34.760]  You got to go to get a tax lawyer.
[57:34.760 --> 57:39.040]  So the average person doesn't even know how they're getting screwed over.
[57:39.040 --> 57:42.920]  They just know they're getting less money or they know that they were now forced to
[57:42.920 --> 57:43.920]  go get healthcare.
[57:43.920 --> 57:47.760]  So see, you know, there's the argument, well, you can't have folks come in and get their
[57:47.760 --> 57:48.760]  healthcare for free.
[57:48.760 --> 57:51.640]  So we got to force everybody to buy it because we're going bankrupt, but then they bring
[57:51.640 --> 57:55.880]  in 30 million illegals and tell them everything's free to accelerate the bankruptcy and let
[57:55.880 --> 58:00.120]  folks come into the country with TB, tuberculosis, everything else you can imagine.
[58:00.120 --> 58:06.720]  Then we have ABC tells Obamacare users get ready for some sticker shock.
[58:06.720 --> 58:11.160]  Let's, let's play that clip ABC will get ready for some sticker shock.
[58:11.160 --> 58:14.920]  If you're looking into the price of Obamacare plans, the average premiums are expected to
[58:14.920 --> 58:18.560]  rise by 25% next year.
[58:18.560 --> 58:22.640]  Many consumers will also be limited to choosing plans from just one provider.
[58:22.640 --> 58:23.640]  All right.
[58:23.640 --> 58:28.560]  Now the final clip I'll play when we come back is MSNBC.
[58:28.560 --> 58:30.640]  Democrats are going to have to answer for Obamacare rates.
[58:30.640 --> 58:35.000]  Now, why would MSNBC suddenly tell the truth because they said I was deeply racist and
[58:35.000 --> 58:36.840]  didn't want a black man to succeed.
[58:36.840 --> 58:39.880]  I mean, we, we've got that clip cause I was going to Obamacare, we're going to explain
[58:39.880 --> 58:41.600]  what they're really up to here.
[58:41.600 --> 58:45.200]  See now we're getting ready to totally bankrupt it and bring in the new scam.
[58:45.200 --> 58:48.200]  So now they can tell you what a horrible deal it was.
[58:48.200 --> 58:53.680]  Not a group you develop living defense for us.
[58:53.680 --> 58:55.040]  It took you over a year to do it.
[58:55.040 --> 58:56.800]  Why is this so good?
[58:56.800 --> 59:01.240]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[59:01.240 --> 59:06.080]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[59:06.080 --> 59:07.080]  my system.
[59:07.080 --> 59:13.080]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[59:13.080 --> 59:18.840]  that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees, spreading disease around.
[59:18.840 --> 59:21.440]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[59:21.440 --> 59:22.440]  These are all parasites.
[59:22.440 --> 59:25.160]  Tell us about all the stuff I said, there's so many things that are in it.
[59:25.160 --> 59:26.400]  You have the neem in there.
[59:26.400 --> 59:29.480]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[59:29.480 --> 59:32.760]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[59:32.760 --> 59:33.760]  All right.
[59:33.760 --> 59:35.960]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[59:35.960 --> 59:37.120]  It just came back in yesterday.
[59:37.120 --> 59:40.760]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com and folks, you can't lose, it's full of stuff that's
[59:40.760 --> 59:42.800]  great for your body, period.
[59:42.800 --> 59:46.080]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[59:46.080 --> 59:48.280]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[59:48.280 --> 59:54.400]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[59:54.400 --> 01:00:14.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:19.880]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:30.080]  So it's your fault that you didn't sign up if you're 20 years old for your free Obamacare,
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.080]  which isn't free.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:38.160]  It'll cost you on average about $5,000 a year, but then it's also the old people's fault
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.760]  because they're using the system too much.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:44.600]  See, once they get you in a collective of system, they can hold everybody hostage.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:50.320]  But all the left needs to know is you're right about big mega corporations being very, very
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:54.200]  criminal on average, doing a lot of horrible things, but you're always saying big government
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:59.800]  will stop them when they're the ones pushing for big government 100 times out of 100.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:06.200]  Hillary has gotten 21 donations from millionaires that Trump got.
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:10.640]  That's Bloomberg, because the number is probably even less than that.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:16.960]  He's gotten the most small donations of any candidate ever, and he's broken all records.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:23.080]  But see, you really don't want to be anti-establishment that made this country great and gave us innovation.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.680]  You don't care.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.920]  You want to feel like you're part of the winning team and kind of waddle around, and I get
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:29.920]  it.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:34.240]  But understand, in the WikiLeaks, they talk about how stupid you are.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.720]  Hell, they do it on C-SPAN.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:40.360]  They do it on PBS.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:47.480]  And it is so frustrating to sit there and watch all these pseudo-intellectuals really
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.440]  pretend in their own minds that they're part of the establishment going along with it when
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.880]  they're being screwed as well.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.640]  So let's go ahead and go to MSNBC.
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.520]  Democrats are going to have to answer.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:02.600]  Now, they can only do this now, because they got it through.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.240]  Remember, they said, there are no death panels.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.240]  It's free.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.240]  Keep your doctor.
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:10.240]  Then it's the price of a phone bill, then the price of a cable bill, blah, blah, blah,
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.240]  blah, blah.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.160]  There's no penalties.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.160]  Thousands of news articles.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.920]  Matt Drudge is a liar.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:21.960]  There is no penalty that started three years ago.
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.800]  And now it's up to $5,000 a person.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:25.960]  There is no penalty.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.320]  It's a lie of racist.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.320]  It's a lie.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.360]  There are no increases.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:35.520]  Coming up next on All Things Considered, we're going to talk in soft voices because we are
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:42.440]  the intellectuals, and we use big words, and we have large thesauruses, a bunch of heartless
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:53.640]  mercenary trash who sit around and talk about how I have a dark heart and how I'm reckless.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:58.040]  Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice, but I'm not reckless with the truth.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.720]  I'm reckless in my resistance, because I know that's one of the things that history has
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.720]  ever changed anything.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.880]  A few people are disgraceful, and everybody knows it.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.720]  I'm telling you, Hillary is going to lose it only in slide, folks.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:14.640]  The evidence, that's coming up in the next segment, it's overwhelming.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:22.000]  Kane, Drudge Report has a story with the photos, her VP went to Florida where she supposedly
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.760]  is so far ahead in all the polls, because they over sample massive numbers more of Democrats.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.640]  I know I keep harping on that.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.640]  They admit it.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.200]  I don't believe the public has done it.
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:41.000]  Kane plays to 30 in Florida, and you click on the story, and there's literally hardly
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.600]  anyone even in front of a stage, and they said it was 30 people, and it was mainly their
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.600]  campaign operatives.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.480]  I mean, this is a joke.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.480]  There's video of it.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.600]  In fact, let's just dopplegang the story up to info wars.com.
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:54.600]  This is so important.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.600]  Just copy the whole thing.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.600]  Get out to everybody.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:02.520]  Let's go out to break, though, with this MSNBC, Democrats are going to have to answer for
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.520]  Obamacare.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.520]  Here it is.
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:08.120]  It's a real problem, both for the Clinton campaign and potentially for Democrats heading
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:13.920]  in to what's going to be the first year of a new administration, a new Congress.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:18.800]  This is exactly what Republicans were warning about when they opposed this law, and both
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:23.360]  sides have been so dug in on trying to make changes to this law.
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:27.120]  Democrats have refused basically to reopen it because they think that Republicans would
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:32.160]  take an opportunity to make changes to the law to essentially gut it and completely get
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.160]  rid of it.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:38.280]  So they've been at this standstill for years now, really, and the people that are paying
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.280]  the price.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.280]  She goes on.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.520]  Now, suddenly, they're so truthful and so good, and suddenly, her teleprompter's loaded
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:48.600]  with stuff because the Republicans helped write this bill.
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.280]  This is part two of screwing you.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:58.280]  They're all together with their knives sharpened, and now, oh, they're going to fix it, though.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:01.760]  Oh, yeah.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.600]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.600]  Michael Moore.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.480]  Trump's election will be the biggest FU in history.
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.800]  An article up by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:13.960]  During a speech for his new one-man stage performance, Trumpland, Michael Moore remarked
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:17.800]  that the election of Donald Trump will be the biggest FU in history.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:21.640]  Moore began by saying he knew a lot of people in Michigan who were going to vote for Trump,
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:25.560]  who were not racist or rednecks, but were sick of their jobs being offshore to places
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.560]  like Mexico.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:32.160]  Trump's promise to slap a 35% tariff on Ford cars made in Mexico and sent back to America
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:37.320]  was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:41.840]  Whether Trump means it or not is kind of irrelevant because he's saying the things of people who
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:46.440]  are hurting, and it's why every beaten-down, worthless, forgotten, working stiff who used
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.920]  to be part of what was called the middle-class loves Trump, arguing that Trump was the human
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:55.360]  Molotov cocktail that they'd been waiting for, the human hand grenade that they can legally
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:58.360]  throw into the system that stole the lives from them.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:24.760]  You can find more reports like this at infowars.com.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:29.760]  Oh yeah.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.760]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:32.760]  It's time to ride, boys.
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.760]  We need a thousand paul reviewers.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:40.760]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:47.280]  And beef was for supper, revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:53.160]  on demand, DVDs now available, starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, special ops general
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:07:00.320]  Jerry Boykin, want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue, revelation, the movie.info.
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:01.760]  Let's fix it.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.760]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:11.120]  a lot of money while you get high-quality products and fund the info war, a 360 win.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:16.080]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.680]  at infowarsore.com.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:21.520]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.600]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:30.840]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:34.920]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.720]  the products that you need each month.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:41.320]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:44.440]  choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:49.720]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com,
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.120]  this is a sure win.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:57.080]  10% off on auto ship, win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:04.960]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.800]  We are on the march.
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.840]  The empire is on the run.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:25.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:47.400]  Remove Donald Trump from the equation and just look at dozens of foreign governments
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:52.440]  including the communist Chinese, talk about abuse of women, forced abortions, killing
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:57.680]  newborn babies, treating women as third class citizens, killing Buddhist monks, killing
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:02.920]  people that are caught practicing Buddhist exercises, selling their organs, but not a
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:05.120]  word from the liberal trendies.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:09.840]  I mean to the liberals credit back in the 80s and 90s that was criticism of Tiananmen
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:14.120]  Square and the one child policy, but not now.
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:20.760]  His authoritarianism is so in vogue and you've got all these foreign leaders and the corrupt
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:28.800]  pope and you've got the Saudi Arabian mafia and just all these groups telling us we can't
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:32.720]  have Donald Trump and we've got the IMF and World Bank and the UN coming in with the EU
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.480]  security force that's in Reuters again today to oversee our election because it's imminent
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:43.040]  the Russians are going to steal it, but there's no election fraud and it doesn't exist and
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:50.200]  Trump's insane, but the OECD security unit from the EU is here because they're worried
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.120]  about Trump supporters trying to intimidate voters.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:10:00.560]  I've got Reuters, AP, you name it, here today, saying today 13 days out that Trump's planning
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:06.840]  to steal the election, but he's insane when he first raised the issue of election integrity.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:14.280]  Again, we've reached this otherworldly place where we're now into data dump 17 from WikiLeaks,
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:18.040]  Joe Biggs which is showing me more emails on top of the last four or five data dumps
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:23.560]  where POTUS, president of the United States, is using a pen name, a nom de plume as French
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:28.360]  coup d'etat, which is French for coup d'etat, it's a joke from the movie Hop, pretty funny
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:35.040]  kids movie, and you've got all these establishment people just running around foaming at the mouth
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:39.120]  and Biggs are showing me new emails where they actually say, oh my God, they know that
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:44.240]  POTUS is communicating with her via this server, we've got to cover this up, it actually says
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:54.360]  we've got to cover this up and clean this up, that is 100% pure felonies up one side
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:11:01.160]  and down the other knowingly committing crimes, using a nom de plume to circumvent the Freedom
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:06.280]  Information Act and to get around Congress and to get around the people and to get around
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:10.600]  all of this and then they're caught.
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:15.000]  The smoking gun, Cheryl Mills tells POTUS that we need to clean this up, Obama has emails
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:22.400]  from her, that's today, that just broke zero hedge, I didn't know it was up yet, it just
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.040]  came out this morning, Biggs has got the emails as well, he's going to come in here
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:29.080]  and cover it briefly at the bottom of the hour with Gerald Salente who's about to join
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:37.040]  us from his studios in Kingston, New York, but for me it's just so crazy, there's new
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:42.720]  emails out, this is an article, just went up on m4wars.com, Clinton campaign admits making
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:49.640]  false claims against Trump and then they're in the emails admitting it's basically all
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:53.480]  fake, just like they admit in the POTUS email that came out yesterday, we've got to get
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:57.920]  ahead of this, we've got to get with all the major pollsters and tell them to oversample,
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:05.320]  so it looks like Hillary's the winner early on, they oversample the ABC poll yesterday,
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:11.840]  in Florida she wins by 12 points, they oversampled 12 points, but that's nothing, they oversampled
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:16.280]  45-50 points in some, this is so, I don't know what to call this because I mean I know
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:20.400]  he's been a best selling author, was a lobbyist before that, worked in and out of government,
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:26.880]  really smart guy, Gerald Salente, trendsresearch.com, he wants to get into their hypocrisy today
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:30.480]  and which is something I should have done, I'm glad he wanted to do this because we never
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.320]  pre-script what he's going to cover, I always know he has something amazing, he's got like
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:36.200]  great restaurants to go to, there's not even a menu, they say hey you're going to like
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:39.960]  it, and he's got this whole deal of clips we're going to play where these rappers are
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:43.720]  saying I'm drugging women, I'm raping them, it's great, and then meanwhile they're hanging
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:49.120]  out with Michelle and Obama, and then meanwhile she comes out and gives this big speech that
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.920]  Glenn Beck and everybody else lauded, oh it was the best speech ever, we're talking about
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:56.280]  oh the misogynistic behavior of Donald Trump, we won't put up with that, when you're the
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:01.160]  ones literally pushing the hip hop gangster culture that is about the worst culture in
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:06.240]  the world after Saudi Arabia for women, or communist China, that's what I'm saying, they
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:11.240]  just are, Donald Trump isn't even the same universe towards abusing women as communist
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:18.040]  China or the rest of it, so we've got so much to go over with Gerald Salente, we've got
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:26.160]  Madonna pledges oral sex for Clinton voters, remember that last week, I mean imagine if
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:32.280]  Trump's people were talking like this, and it's crazy, so we're 13 days out, we've got
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:37.600]  reports here in Texas, this is infowars.com, it's on W.O.A.I. to San Antonio, the machines
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.960]  are all turning off, everybody's votes are flipping, it's bad, they might just take
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:46.280]  Texas and give it to Hillary, they've already been siopping but suddenly about to go blue,
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:51.440]  report vote switch from Trump to Hillary in Texas, director of elections then runs, this
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:57.560]  is a powerful video, runs from our own David Knight, when they try to just talk to him
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:01.320]  about the Capitol, he actually runs, Michael Morris says Trump's election will be the biggest
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:09.040]  F.U. in history, alleged Clinton fixer, New York Times has become the national inquirer,
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:15.520]  Obama's death spiral double digit cost spikes, disappearing choices, it was a monopoly takeover,
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.320]  buy big banks that own the insurance companies, same thing with driverless cars, they're gonna
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:23.200]  raise your taxes, raise the regulations to where you gotta be the driverless car, this
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:29.320]  is how they control society, and the Ron Mangels brother runs Uber and says I'm gonna get you
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:34.600]  out of your car within 10 years and you're gonna pay me, and he talks like this thug
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:41.800]  so he gets all the investment, but he's shown he delivers, Obamacare, Uber taking over transportation,
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:50.760]  taking over healthcare, taking over everything, not with innovation, but screw jobs.
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:55.280]  But I go back to this, wow, Tim Cain holds rally and only 30 people show up, that's up
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:00.240]  on DrudgeReport.com and MFullWars.com, powerful video, I don't know if it's 30 people, but
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:06.600]  we're meant to believe there's gonna be this landslide, Gerald Salente joins us, TrendsAtResearch.com,
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:10.240]  really doesn't need any introduction, thanks for joining us, where do you want to start
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:16.040]  first, but obviously we can get into a situation with the hypocrisy, you've got a long laundry
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:21.000]  list of it here that should be attacked, but what do you make of just this other worldliness,
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.560]  because the mainstream media is on fumes, they have almost no viewers, but still they
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.440]  are just doubling down, Gerald.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:34.040]  Well, I think the big issue is, for example, if you go to Politico or any of the other
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:40.880]  states, it's the attacks against Donald Trump for his, quote, locker room talk, and that's
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:44.640]  why you're getting a lot of women that are going to be voting for Hillary Clinton.
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:52.160]  And I want to say today, at this point, at this moment, that this could be a game-changing
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:59.960]  event if it's promoted by you and others and put in the context that it deserves.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:05.400]  Michelle Obama is a disgusting fraud.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:11.160]  Just like her husband, birds of a feather flock together.
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:19.920]  She's going around the country, how heartbroken she is, how disgusting it is of what Donald
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:28.040]  Trump has said, compared to what Donald Trump has said, and the people that the Obama's
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:30.280]  promote.
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.880]  This is kiddie talk.
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:41.760]  The Obamas are promoting the most disgusting, low-life individuals that are destroying the
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:49.920]  culture of society, and as Michelle Obama preaches around the country, how our little
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:57.840]  children are hearing these disgusting things about Trump, she's ignoring the fact that
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:06.560]  both Barack Obama and Michelle Obama are promoting the most disgusting human beings on the planet
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:09.640]  that are really infecting the children.
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:15.560]  Little kids, Alex, aren't tuned in to the presidential reality show.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:22.680]  They're listening to rap, and the rap that the Obamas are promoting are the ones that
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.680]  they bring into the White House.
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:35.640]  Be the people, our White House, they invite this low-life scum that degenerates women
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:42.920]  at a disgusting and obscene level with language and details that don't even come close.
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:46.880]  And let's be clear, we're going to go through the lyrics of this, I know it's a family audience,
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:49.200]  but you're right, this has always been the hottest thing with kids.
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:53.560]  Even back when I was in school, I liked the more gutter type rap stuff, too short to name
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:54.560]  it.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:57.840]  But not even liking it, this is what they have.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:02.440]  This is what, it's not a family audience, this is what they're playing on radio.
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.440]  I agree.
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:08.040]  Somebody just had this point, Gerald, because what you're saying is so key.
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.280]  This is secretly recorded Donald Trump stuff that they're forcing on everybody.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:14.040]  Meanwhile, they're at the White House with the scum that target kids.
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.040]  Go ahead.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:21.800]  Yeah, and not only that, she's preaching about how our little girls and our little children
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:28.080]  are hearing this, and that loving fathers are sickened by daughters being exposed to
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:34.440]  this vicious language about women, and they're bringing these people into the White House.
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:39.520]  Barack and Michelle, are you playing this stuff in front of your kids?
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:46.680]  Oh, and by the way, we the people are footing the bill for this as they bring this low-life
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:51.240]  scum into the White House to sing about it.
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.200]  Put on some of those clips.
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.920]  Put on the clips of Rick Ross.
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:59.680]  Put on the clips of Big Sean.
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:04.800]  These are the people that they invited into the White House, and they're talking about
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.680]  what Trump is saying.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:08.480]  This doesn't even come close.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:12.280]  We're going to show the lyrics on screen for TV viewers, and I'll read some of them, but
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.280]  I can't really on FCC.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:17.520]  We're on over 200 stations now, it's well over 200 now, folks, so we can't obviously
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.520]  play this.
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.320]  But they have the bleep versions that they have for our kids.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.600]  But this is what's being pushed, this is what's being put out.
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:28.520]  This is who they invite to the White House, and again, Hollywood trying to sexualize our
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.040]  children, all of it.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:36.240]  Then they flip around and act like they're in the Victorian age, sitting there demonizing
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:37.240]  Donald Trump.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.240]  It's the height of hypocrisy.
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.680]  And Gerald Zelimpe is right.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:43.880]  We should take these clips and put out special reports that can be internet-only so we can
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:47.800]  actually show the vulgarity to show people the type of brainwashing that's going on.
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:52.440]  We'll break a lot of this down on the other side with Gerald Zelimpe of Trends Research.
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:57.800]  I'm Alex Jones, TrendsResearch.com, Infowars.com, stay with us.

[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.880]  Come and take it.
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.680]  Hi, my name is Stephen Holstein.
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:06.880]  In my 20s, I abused stingulins and anabolic steroids at the point where my adrenal glands
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:07.880]  were shot.
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:10.760]  I suffer from extreme fatigue and an inability to handle stress.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:15.560]  Over six years, I have been taking adrenal supplements including herbs, glandulars, vitamin
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:17.360]  C, and vitamin B5.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:21.280]  All these supplements did was treat the symptoms and produced only minimal results.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:26.560]  Now, just after one month on Synergy One and ADR Medics, I truly feel rejuvenated.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:31.320]  I have never felt such relaxation before from any adrenal supplement, and I did just ten
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:33.400]  minutes after taking ADR Medics.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:37.840]  I then noticed Synergy One made me wake up rested and with much more energy.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:40.800]  No more hungover, groggy feeling upon arising.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:45.080]  I had almost considered going to another country for stem cell therapy as a last resort, but
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:49.800]  now I truly feel rejuvenated on Synergy One and ADR Medics.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:51.680]  Success happens with synergistic nutrition.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:23:01.000]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit 1worldway.com, that's 1worldwhey.com.

[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.560]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.120]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:10.160]  help you too.

[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:05.440]  We're back with Gerald Salunta.
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.440]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:08.240]  Let's play that clip with Michelle Obama.
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:11.160]  This is her lauded speech she's giving across the country.
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:17.360]  The outrage of a secretly recorded, highly edited tape that the Bush creature admits
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:21.880]  he goaded Trump into basically saying.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:25.680]  So this is all part of their clandestine operations, forced fed to the media and then
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:31.520]  they blame Trump for this being in the news when it's a secretly recorded rat recording.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:35.920]  Meanwhile, they have people to the White House that literally talk about drugging women and
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:36.920]  raping them.
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:40.680]  And they have these people around their kids and then the daughters are out twerking and
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:41.680]  everything at the concerts.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.960]  But that's okay, well fine.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:49.320]  But then don't sit there and judge Trump, who never claimed he was some perfect angel.
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.320]  Here is that clip.
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:57.240]  This was not just a lewd conversation, this wasn't just locker room banter.
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:05.360]  This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:10.920]  and actually bragging about kissing and groping women using language so obscene that many
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:16.520]  of us were worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV.
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:21.960]  Again, they've called this sexual assault saying women would throw themselves at him
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:23.240]  and he could do whatever he wanted to.
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:24.800]  It sounds a little bit like a pig.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:25.800]  I'm not like that.
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:28.680]  But hey, Trump never claimed to be an angel.
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:30.000]  Now here's a clip of Madonna.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  We can play this.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.840]  The other ones have too much cussing and we're going to read some of the transcripts here
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:34.840]  with Gerald Salenta.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:35.840]  But he's absolutely right.
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.840]  We've got to put these videos together and point this out.
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:38.840]  I had this idea weeks ago.
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:39.960]  I just never got around to it.
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.760]  All the rap stars and the rest of it.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.120]  Mark Dice has pointed this out.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.760]  It's very key.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:46.760]  So here's Madonna.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:54.880]  One more thing before I introduce this genius of comedy.
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:59.040]  If you vote for Hillary Clinton, I will give you a vote on.
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.040]  Okay?
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:01.040]  Fair enough.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:04.560]  So she says if you vote for Hillary, I will give you oral sex.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.360]  I mean, this is just the trashiness these people.
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:12.400]  And then this trash, at least she's not talking about raping women like the rappers did.
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:16.000]  This trash then points their finger at Trump in some edited secret recording.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.920]  I guess that's what's got you so hot because I know you're not a big Trump supporter.
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:21.040]  You're just pointing out the hypocrisy, Gerald.
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.040]  Yes.
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:29.480]  And the hypocrisy of Michelle Obama, as I said, both her and her husband are disgusting
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.640]  frauds.
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:35.280]  You know Michelle's line and you know Barack's line.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:40.520]  When they go low, we go high.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:42.640]  How low can they go?
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:48.160]  Hey, maybe the high they're talking about is all these rappers coming in there.
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:50.800]  Yeah, they may really get high.
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:58.160]  You cannot get lower than the people that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama have invited
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:01.280]  into we the people's White House.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:07.640]  These low life disgusting people talking about getting women drugged out, getting them drunk
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:13.920]  and having sex with them, bragging how many women they could get at one time.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:20.520]  And if you bring your friends over here, I'll do them to them to one dirty land piece of
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:29.880]  language after another coming from the mouths of the people that Barack Obama and better
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:35.960]  than now, Michelle Obama invite to the White House.
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:40.560]  And bragging, bragging, doing the dancing with them.
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:45.680]  And of course, Michelle shooting her mouth off all over the country.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:46.680]  How loving father.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:50.920]  Well, then there's the thing about Hillary that basically harasses women and makes them
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:51.920]  have sex with her.
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:52.920]  That's well known.
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:53.920]  That's not coming out.
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:28:00.160]  Well, again, just staying on this one point about them going after Trump for stuff that's
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:02.160]  minor league.
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:10.160]  And again, I'm not defending him, but compared to the filth, the poison minds of children.
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.160]  There's no doubt.
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.160]  There's no doubt.
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:18.280]  Nickelodeon MTV is all targeting the preteens with horrible sexualized, just ghetto, you
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:21.640]  know, prison garbage and continuing here.
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:24.320]  Then let's start getting into some of the people they've invited over, Gerald.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:27.960]  I mean, let's talk about who's coming to the White House, what they're saying specifically.
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:32.680]  I mean, I've got big Sean, Mona Lisa lyrics.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:36.240]  I mean, I can't even read this on air, but read, read some of them.
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:39.120]  What we could get your blank out the dirty parts.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:42.440]  And again, just talks about drugging women and raping them.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:50.400]  And I mean, but read, but again, these, this is Michelle Obama with that arrogant attitude,
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:57.080]  just like a husband going around the country talking about Donald Trump and criticizing
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:07.080]  him as they are promoting and inviting these vile people into the people's White House,
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.080]  entertaining them.
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:13.200]  Oh, and by the way, us picking up the tab, that's right, taxpayers paying for people
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:20.160]  that put out lyrics about drug dealing, exploitation of women ain't gonna lie.
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:24.220]  I got a million dollar chick with a billion dollar bleeper.
[01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:30.120]  Every time I come, I swear to God, I feel like I'd be rich and it just goes on and
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.120]  on and on.
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.120]  I'm a drug.
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:33.120]  Come on, reach some more of it.
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:37.840]  Yeah, trying to get that hotel money, but you know them crackers ain't gonna let you
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:38.840]  get the rits.
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:43.400]  They ain't gonna let you get the fountain in the front with the fist.
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:44.680]  They gonna give you court side.
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:45.680]  It just goes on.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:50.080]  Just all about raping women and all the rest of it, getting them drunk and raping them.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:51.080]  Hold on.
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.080]  Well, that's, you know, that's liberal though.
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:53.080]  That's okay.
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:54.080]  Don't be racist.
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:55.080]  That's fine.
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:58.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:05.880]  Hey there, this is Joe Biggs with infowars.com with a fun and exciting report by The Sun.
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:07.720]  He virtually rubbed a microtch.
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:10.280]  Woman sexually assaulted in virtual reality.
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:15.320]  The VR version was trying out the new technology for the first time with a game called Weaver,
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:20.200]  what a man using the pseudonym Big Bro 442 virtually groaned her.
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:22.160]  We have decided not to name the woman.
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:26.000]  She wrote, in between a wave of zombies and daemons to shoot down, I was hanging out next
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.520]  to Big Bro 442.
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:32.680]  Suddenly Big Bro 442's disembodied helmet faced me dead on and he started virtually
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:33.880]  rubbing my chest.
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:38.120]  The woman's first foray into virtual reality started off well as he experienced one me
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:39.120]  over.
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.120]  Lock, stock and barrel.
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:44.800]  But just after three minutes in the virtual world, Big Bro 442 showed up and ruined everything.
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:48.840]  The woman cries stop to deter the heavy tech breather.
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:53.560]  Big Bro 442 came back at her again and she added, women after all are supposed to be
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:58.160]  cool and take on any form of sexual harassment with a laugh but I still told him to stop.

[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:05.040]  You ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:08.920]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.240]  Something's wrong and we all know it.
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:14.240]  I'm Charity Daniels and I'm here to tell you about it.
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:19.240]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:26.280]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:32.520]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.880]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.320]  We're the solution.
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:39.000]  Americans, ain't nothing more to it than that.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:45.280]  Star in Alex Jones, Charity Daniels and Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin, theatrical screenings
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:47.280]  on demand, DVDs now available.
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:52.320]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue?
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.360]  Revelation, the movie.info.
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:33:00.000]  Americans need to see this film, Revelation, the movie.info.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:12.000]  Let's fix it.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:18.000]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on, for your mind.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:24.480]  All right, a couple of key items here.
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:29.000]  We're about to add more updates to the free app at infowars.com forward slash app.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.240]  We launched it about a month ago.
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:38.120]  Last time I checked, it says like 400,000 downloads, and it's about 50-50, apple versus
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:39.280]  droid.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:44.160]  That sounds great, but I mean, we've got four or five million people terrestrially tuning
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:47.400]  in every day, and this has got video feeds, audio feeds.
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:52.880]  We're about to add news updates, alerts, special video feeds, special reports.
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:57.720]  All the reporters will be able to go through this platform live, give you an alert, go
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:05.240]  live, and then archive it there, and then we can HD upload it to other platforms.
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:09.640]  I mean, this is a weapon system, and I intend down the road to have trusted people that
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:13.240]  are auxiliary reporters and stuff, get their own profile on this.
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:17.080]  I'll just let you know that now so that you can get to a big audience whenever you need
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:18.080]  to.
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:20.080]  We've got to vet those folks who do that, obviously.
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:23.640]  So go get the free app, infowars.com forward slash app.
[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:27.520]  Tell people about it, because, okay, 400,000 people.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:29.200]  We need 10 million people.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:32.080]  I mean, again, I'm so frustrated.
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.520]  There's this Trump speech that I think is the most powerful he's given.
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:37.600]  I named the video.
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:42.400]  This video could win the election for Trump, and it's only gotten like 500,000 views on
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.160]  the two platforms.
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:45.160]  It's so weird.
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:48.000]  If I really want something to be big, it doesn't happen.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.400]  But then I know I just churn out research and info, and then it's just the random stuff
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.520]  is like 30 million views, 20 million views, 10 million views.
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:03.080]  Every week, we're getting videos with 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 million views, 30 million.
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:09.920]  The press conference in our feeds now has 30 million views of the Danny Williams press
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:12.600]  conference last week before the debate.
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:18.920]  And a little bit of info gets out, but it's just like really 30 million people watch this.
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:23.320]  And it's like the Daily Beast trying to interrupt and attack him and say he just wants money.
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:27.360]  And a little bit of info got out, but it's like, whoa, CNN doesn't have 30 million viewers
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:30.000]  in a week, people.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  So I'm not complaining.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.760]  I just, we've got lightning in a bottle.
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:35.320]  I just can't control it.
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:39.360]  And that's what's really frustrating is that we could really hurt them if the right videos
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:44.160]  like Lexa Lente just said, I could see his energy, never seen him as hyped up.
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:45.160]  Great minds think alike.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:48.680]  Two weeks ago, I saw a Mark Dice video similar to that we're saying, showing these horrible
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:53.280]  rappers, the things they're doing, and then the fact that, compared to what Trump did,
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:54.520]  it's nothing.
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:36:00.320]  And then she blames that this is public on Trump when they secretly recorded it and edited
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:01.320]  it.
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:04.000]  And it's 11 years old while they're at the White House.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.880]  I mean, I fight to keep my children away from gangster rap.
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:08.280]  It's addictive.
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:09.280]  I hear it.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.280]  I start getting brainwashed by it.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:16.880]  But it's what, why didn't the CIA in the 90s had this weaponized, this is admitted, top
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:19.680]  rappers have gone public, but I've talked to the top of checks from, you know, I've talked
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:22.840]  to top rock stars that were in the meetings, they said, listen, you go with gangster type
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:24.400]  stuff or we're not putting you on air.
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:26.280]  We're like, we're selling 20 million records a year.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:27.280]  What do you mean?
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:28.280]  Shut up.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.280]  It's going to happen.
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:30.280]  Music is culture.
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:35.280]  Going back a thousand years ago, the king could be overthrown by one gesture, one, you know,
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:39.160]  one guy playing his little banjo with ballads about the king.
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.360]  And you know how King John's corrupt.
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:44.520]  I mean, that didn't just in Disney movies, that really happened.
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:48.000]  So they know how to control that and look what they've done to the black community with
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.880]  this stuff and it's happening everywhere else.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:52.880]  It is a poison.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:57.480]  We're going to go back to Gerald Salente of trendsresearch.com here in a moment.
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:59.280]  Before I go any further, we are listed supported.
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:04.480]  We have the Hilary for prison shirt that has revolutionized the campaign, been absolutely
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:08.040]  a bellwether pointed out she's a criminal, but all things come to an end.
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:10.480]  It's still a best seller, but when it runs out, it runs out.
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:11.480]  We're not making any more.
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:14.920]  It'll probably be less than 13 days till it sells out because we're not making any more
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:15.920]  of Hillary for prison.
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:18.720]  Got info wars.com on the back legalized freedom.
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:21.040]  There's another shirt is limited edition made in America.
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:26.040]  That's the Gadsden locker up the Gadsden snake taken on Hillary.
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.760]  That is limited edition about to sell out five star review on that.

[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:03.880]  Hello.
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:04.880]  Yeah, you're back.
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:05.880]  Sorry, Gerald.
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:07.000]  You know, I'm in that movie.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.160]  I'm in that movie as well, you know, revelations.
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.160]  Yes, sir.
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:11.160]  I should have mentioned that.
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:12.160]  That's right.
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:13.160]  Yeah.
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:22.720]  You know, you said I'm very upset and I am because again, Michelle Obama, like her husband,
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:25.560]  they're disgraceful, disgusting frauds.
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.560]  He's a critical pig.
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:31.680]  I want to read to you some of her comments.
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:38.360]  She said, I'm campaigning against hurtful, hateful language about women.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:46.280]  She said, language as parents, we have to protect our children and protecting them against
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:54.280]  our, our children of sexually predatory behavior, language so obscene that many worry about our
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:55.280]  children.
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:00.800]  Now, remember, she's talking about this in context to what Donald Trump said.
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:11.760]  Now they invite these rappers that speak openly about sexually predators, more, way more disgusting
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:12.760]  than that.
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:15.360]  Let's name the predators and let's, let's go over some of the lyrics.
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:20.960]  Here, here, Rick Ross, invited to the White House, we the people, picking up the tab for
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:25.840]  this guy, put Molly in all her champagne.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.840]  She ain't even know it.
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:31.920]  I took her home and I enjoyed that.
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:34.680]  She ain't even know it.
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:41.880]  So Michelle, you mean he fed her a load of champagne, got a drunk, had sex with her when
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:45.880]  she passed out and you're talking about Trump.
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.040]  You are as disgusting.
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:53.120]  Michelle Obama meets with, with a date rate promoter.
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:54.120]  You got it.
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:41:00.840]  Big Sean, another person they invite to the White House, that we the people pick up the
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:08.560]  tab for as she's shooting a mouth off around the country with this better than now attitude.
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:15.240]  How low Trump is, hey, when they go low, we go high, yeah, they go high.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:20.080]  They bring in the people that get the highest hit of anything.
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:25.320]  These people, Big Sean, you read some of his lyrics, here is some more.
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:32.040]  I believe in God in rubbers, hey, Michelle, did you have your kids out there when he was
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:33.040]  singing that?
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:43.280]  No, maybe for this next lyric, even we sex you and not my lover, hit you on the couch
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:48.400]  and not the covers, hey, you mean you do them anywhere, huh?
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:54.760]  Oh, when you're talking about Trump's dirty language, you hypocrite and all you little
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:42:02.080]  prostitutes out there, your little Anderson Coopers, all of you little nobodies out there
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:09.880]  with big mouths that won't repeat these words or call out the Obamas for lying, freaking
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:16.400]  frauds they are to invite this scum into we the people's house.
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:17.400]  Let me continue.
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:19.600]  And make us pay for it.
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:28.240]  And yeah, and if you bring your friend, then we got to effort, hey, you bring your friend,
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.240]  we got that.
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:34.720]  Oh, are you going to use the couch in the White House when you're effort, hey, let's
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:37.400]  go on.
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:45.200]  My life is my odyssey, my dogs to the right of me, oh, hey, that's what you call them.
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:48.280]  And he keeps going on and on.
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:53.800]  My mamas say I'm a poet, oh, hey, mamas said, then you must be.
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:43:03.240]  You hating praying, I blow it, but this life I made through, I show a bad bitch what she
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:10.440]  made for, hey, you don't want your children to hear what Trump said.
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:19.120]  Of course not, Ms. Obama, that's why you invite these low life rappers into we the people's
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:20.120]  house.
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:21.840]  And then have the nerve to go around in her life.
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:22.840]  Let me add this point.
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:26.440]  Look, I didn't agree with Tipper Gore trying to take over labeling and getting involved
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:28.600]  in the free press is at least on a dangerous road.
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:29.600]  It's up to parents.
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:35.360]  But if Tipper Gore came out and was criticizing Trump, she would have some standing, even
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:38.880]  though, you know, her husband's been accused of raping the rest of it, because at least
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:42.720]  she had spoken out against the stuff before separately.
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:46.360]  But with the Obamas that are bringing it all in, Hollywood's pushing it, mainstream media
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:51.240]  is pushing it, to then turn around and act like Trump in some secret recording saying
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:56.680]  much milder stuff is the devil again, just shows that it's pure fraud, pure garbage being
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:43:58.360]  foisted on us.
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:02.960]  Hey, when they go low, we go high.
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:04.160]  That's their line.
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:06.480]  You can't go lower than the Obamas.
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:12.840]  Look, this little nothing of a community organizer that organized nothing, light his way into
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:17.200]  office as an anti-war candidate.
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:20.600]  And now we're in wars longer than any other president's been in office.
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:21.880]  And Obamacare is screwing us.
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:23.200]  Don't forget Obamacare.
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:24.200]  Obamacare.
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:26.200]  Oh, it's beautiful.
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:28.200]  Again, a fraud.
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:34.440]  Hey, folks, first day in office, I'm going to close Guantanamo within a year.
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:36.920]  Then lie after another.
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:46.040]  She's on the campaign trail out there lying her about what Trump is saying and failing.
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:53.280]  None of the media is picking up whereby they are bringing in the people that are corrupting
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:58.720]  the children's minds the most while everyone's ignoring that.
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:04.560]  And again, just to make this clear, little kids aren't listening to the campaign.
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:05.560]  No, absolutely.
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:08.480]  They're listening to weaponized media and gangster hip hop.
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:11.560]  That's what the average 10-year-old is forced fed in this culture.
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:12.560]  So you made your point.
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:14.400]  And that's what the Obamas are promoting.
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:18.720]  The Obamas are promoting this more than anybody else.
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:22.160]  Hey, the fish rots from the head down.
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:24.280]  And they can't stop promoting this.
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:26.600]  Like you said, where's Obama now?
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:34.200]  He's 43rd time out in California with the so-called entertainment industry, raising
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:37.800]  money for more of this.
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:39.240]  Joe Salente, you've made your point.
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:42.680]  I think we're going to take this interview and some of these clips of these rappers and
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:43.680]  actually put it out.
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:52.520]  And with the headline, you know, Obamas meet with promoters of date rape.
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:57.920]  And everybody takes the videos and points out what incredible hypocrites these people
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:45:58.920]  are.
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:01.640]  I mean, they're beyond hypocritical because the magnitude is five, 10 times what the
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:02.880]  edited Trump tape is.
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:07.120]  But again, it goes to, you've been around Washington, you've been around state houses,
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:10.680]  you've been around this world, Gerald.
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:14.480]  Why is Hollywood really out to get the average American?
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:19.560]  Why is there this crazy anti-Christian, anti-free market garbage?
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:23.080]  I mean, I know you're a political atheist, so am I.
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:27.680]  But when we look at this, there really is like, by the elite that run this country,
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:32.440]  like they've got, it's like they're in a pissing contest with a ghost of America that doesn't
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:36.520]  even exist anymore and they're running us in the ground and they're lying and the climate's
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:38.080]  gotten so crazy.
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:43.720]  Is this the death row of this establishment or is this just the beginning of the madness?
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:47.440]  It's because you got a bunch of low life freaks running this show.
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:52.720]  Again, let's compare the Obamas to, there used to be a guy, most people never heard
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:53.720]  of him.
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:58.440]  His name was General Dwight D. Eisenhower, five-star general, supreme commander, the
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:02.240]  allied forces and a two-term president.
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:06.080]  You know who one of his great friends was that he used to bring to the White House?
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:10.480]  They never heard of this guy, Louis Armstrong.
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:15.240]  That's right, they used to call him the ambassador of goodwill.
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:22.240]  Louis Armstrong is great jazz performer, traveled behind the iron curtain all over the world,
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:26.400]  bringing what the world loved the best about America.
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:29.040]  It's great music, it's jazz.
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:35.920]  We've gone from fine elegance and jazz and Louis Armstrong and Dwight D. Eisenhower
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:40.280]  to a lot of bad rap and I've had it with this bad rap.
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:45.200]  I don't want to hear, and it's not music, I don't want to hear that either.
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:46.200]  It's rap.
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:53.120]  My mama says, I'm a poet, I call you almost cell phone, I call you almost cell phone.
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:58.520]  It ain't music, Jack, it's your attitude, there's not an instrument in it, there's not
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:05.440]  a fine musician playing it, it's all your attitude and that's what this country's become.
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:14.760]  One bad rap and we got a two-bit rapper that was a community organizer in Chicago that
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:20.640]  would be nowhere if he didn't have all that dough and now he's out there kissing them
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:28.440]  up again, 43rd time out in Hollywood and they closed down the joint so we the little people
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:31.520]  can't even travel around as a president.
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:35.280]  Wow, Gerald Salenta, you're on fire, I think you've hit on something here.
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:41.240]  This is the rise of the con artist because you look at anybody from Michelle Obama to
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:46.680]  Michael Moore to Hillary Clinton, it's all a confidence game and they just spew crazier
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:51.360]  and crazier BS all the time, they're actually losing credibility, the evidence we see is
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:54.760]  a huge landslide for Trump, they're getting ready to steal it, they're bringing in the
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:59.400]  UN to run the elections, I mean this has really reached twilight zone level and I look at
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:04.840]  the con game and the confidence game of the swagger of Obama and the swagger of Biden
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:08.920]  and I think they're mentally ill and are megalomaniacs and are smoking their own dough.
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:13.560]  Well again, hey, smoking their own dough, what do you think these rappers are straight
[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:20.280]  man, are they ever straight, what do you think they're not doing drugs over there, come on,
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:27.160]  look who they're bringing there, look what they talk about, these cats are high man,
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:32.320]  but hey, when they go low, we go high.
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:36.360]  I know funding ISIS to take over starting war with Russia and I have liberals just laugh
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:39.600]  at me and say so do we have a war with Russia, I mean it's just like total mental illness
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:40.600]  to set in.
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:46.160]  Well look at Hillary Clinton, look listen to her speech over there and it wasn't, these
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:50.800]  aren't debates either, these are presidential reality shows, you have two minutes to talk
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:57.280]  about your foreign policy and what's a foreign policy, more war, no fly zone, oh you talked
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:03.080]  about those Hollywood creeps, they're holding a hundred thousand dollar a plate dinner, right
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:09.400]  now as we speak for Obama's fifth to raise money for the Democrats, these little low
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:17.160]  life scum wouldn't give us one penny for occupied peace, not a penny, but boy they give money
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:23.000]  for war, anybody that votes for Hillary Clinton, all you women out there that don't like Trump's
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:30.560]  talk, you are an accomplice to murder, Hillary Clinton said it on the last debate, no fly
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:37.600]  zone over Syria and we're going to do more fighting, more wars.
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:42.320]  And back on the wrong people, and Gerald, don't forget, she said if we have any unsubstantiated
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:45.960]  cyber attack from the territory of Russia, hit them militarily.
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:46.960]  You got it.
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:50.480]  And then meanwhile she's got a secret, hold on we're going to come back for a break, meanwhile
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:54.280]  we have a secret service guy basically holding her up, telling her it's okay, it's okay,
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:59.280]  her mind is gone half the time, he's obviously hopped up on mesonphetamine, he'll be right

[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:33.440]  Charlie Daniels, he's always defended the Second Amendment.
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:37.240]  Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21, individual rights.
[01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:39.600]  We'll have to take them back to the state, to the collective.
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:41.480]  Well, you know, the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:43.040]  It's gonna be coming after your guns.
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:46.280]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag.
[01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:48.440]  And beef was for supper.
[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:51.240]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:53.080]  The ethical screenings on demand.
[01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:54.600]  DVDs now available.
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:57.680]  Warnish heads and tears over the red, white, and blue.
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:00.040]  Revelation, the movie.info.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:20.280]  By the way, we're gonna be broadcasting for two days live on the day of the election,
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:21.280]  right through the next day.
[01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:23.160]  It's probably gonna be a major circus.
[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:25.840]  We're already getting election fraud all over Texas.
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:27.560]  We just go with the facts, folks.
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:28.560]  They stole it from Gore.
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:30.760]  I'm nonpartisan.
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:33.000]  They're stealing this from Trump right now.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.120]  It's overwhelming.
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:37.400]  And the stakes are so huge.
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:40.160]  I wanted to bring Joe Biggs in, because he'll be covering this morning night on the nightly
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:44.360]  news, but more of the WikiLeaks have come out with data dumps, 17 or 18, from Podesta
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:50.160]  emails, where they say, keep us in the dark, keep us dumb, rig the polls, steal the election.
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:53.240]  You know, hey, we're run by the Russians, or at least funded by them, so let's blame
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:54.240]  Trump.
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:55.240]  I mean, it's all there.
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:56.240]  It's so incredible.
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:59.040]  How does she survive this, even if she cheats and gets in?
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:00.040]  But now they have nothing to lose.
[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:01.040]  So that's the problem.
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:04.000]  But you were bringing up some really interesting points, Joe Biggs.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.440]  So let's go over one of the latest ones, where they're saying, we've got to cover this up.
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:10.840]  The president's been caught using a numb to plume.
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:15.640]  The head of the EPA five years ago, remember, she had to step down, when she got caught
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:21.880]  using fake, fake email to get around the foyer, to get around the Frim Information Act.
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:25.920]  Well, yeah, last month we got information from Huma Abedin, and an email says, how is
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:27.080]  this not classified?
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:31.440]  Obama used a code name to talk with Hillary on her personal email, as new FBI records
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:35.240]  reveal that even her top aid, Huma, was shocked by unsecure.
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:36.240]  And that's daily mail.
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:37.240]  So now, though, it goes further.
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:38.240]  Here's what they want.
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:42.280]  Now we have the smoking gun, Cheryl Mills tells Podesta, we need to clean this up.
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:46.640]  Now what that's in reference to is actually have the emails here from WikiLeaks, it says,
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:50.520]  Jen, you probably have more on this, but it looks like Podesta said, he found out Hillary
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:54.240]  Rodham Clinton was using her personal email when he saw it in the news.
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:59.040]  So he lies and says he finds out about this in the news, like everyone else.
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:03.360]  But then while he's communicating with her with a fake name, and we've got his people
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:07.560]  saying we got to cover this up and then share open and shut prison time for all of you.
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:11.080]  Then Cheryl writes to John Podesta, we need to clean this up.
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:12.520]  He has emails from her.
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:14.600]  They do not say state.gov.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:20.880]  So he knows that he's using these, but he goes on TV and he goes, well, I found out
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:22.560]  about it like you did on TV.
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:23.640]  I didn't know anything about it.
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:28.680]  And again, the issue is they're sending generals to prison for literally nothing because they
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:30.840]  took a few documents home in their briefcase.
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:33.760]  These are people in charge of our national security and they're sitting there talking
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:36.360]  about how the Russians are the ones hacking.
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:37.760]  No, anybody could have figured this out.
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:38.760]  We're going to go on the next one.
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:42.480]  We've only got six, seven minutes left, I think we're about to go to break, but Gerald,
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:45.960]  what do you make of this whole WikiLeaks phenomenon where there's all the proof?
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:50.360]  Everything we ever said, foreign global government wanting to make us dumb, wanting to bankrupt
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:53.360]  us, wanting to keep us stupid, laughing at us.
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:54.360]  I mean, these are demons.
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:55.360]  They talk like criminals.
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:56.360]  Yeah.
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:00.560]  And the mainstream media is hardly covering it at all.
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:03.200]  And it's a neo-feudal society.
[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:08.560]  There's different rules to weed a little people left to obey every letter of the law.
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:13.640]  And the criminals, the economic elite and the political nobility that could steal all
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:19.560]  our money, lie, cheat, take us to war based on lies, and they get no time at all.
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:22.640]  Have all the rappers saying rape women at the White House, hanging out with their kids,
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:25.440]  and then Trump in some secret tape, he's the devil, exactly.
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:26.440]  Total hypocrisy.
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:27.440]  Total.
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:28.440]  Total.
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:33.360]  And that's my anger, is the hypocrisy and the arrogance of the Obamas.
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:38.000]  Oh, and all those little liberals out there, by the way, I know they're not listening to
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.120]  your show.
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:41.160]  And I know you love Clintons.
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:43.560]  You like those GMOs.
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:44.560]  You like those bovine robes.
[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:48.200]  That's another point you point out, the Clintons are the ones that ran it all through.
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:49.200]  Tell them.
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:50.200]  You got it.
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:51.560]  They were no such thing.
[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:53.440]  They allowed that to happen.
[01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:55.920]  They've sold us out so much.
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:57.040]  Listen to Halia's speech.
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:04.240]  As I said, anyone that votes for Hillary Clinton is an accessory to murder.
[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:09.120]  You've seen the clips when they asked her how she felt when Gaddafi was killed.
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:10.120]  We came.
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:11.120]  We saw.
[01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:12.120]  He died.
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:13.760]  And now she's talking about putting her down.
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:14.760]  No way.
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:15.760]  She's not worse than that.
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:16.760]  Let me do the imitation.
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:17.760]  We came.
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:18.760]  We saw.
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:19.760]  He died.
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:20.760]  Yeah.
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:25.960]  So anyone that votes for her is voting.
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:30.320]  If you know, I say, hey, listen, Alex, I need some money to buy some guns.
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:32.280]  I want to kill some people.
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:35.480]  Can you give me the money to buy those guns?
[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:36.480]  You got it.
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:43.640]  Everyone that votes Democratic for Hillary Clinton is an accessory to mass murder.
[01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:44.640]  Go to Libya.
[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:46.600]  Well, hell, they want World War III.
[01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:48.960]  Back in 70 finals, same one, Gerald Salente.
[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:51.960]  Stay with us.
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:54.400]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:55.920]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:59.960]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:04.920]  Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting
[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:08.000]  and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.720]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:17.320]  The reality is it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our
[01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:18.320]  modern diets.
[01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:25.040]  Secret 12 is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:26.320]  natural systems.
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:31.300]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:35.120]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:37.000]  in the body's natural processes.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.480]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:44.120]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:47.640]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:54.320]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[01:59:54.320 --> 02:00:01.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:35.560]  I was thinking this morning about history, about what America really stands for.
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:44.280]  And later in the broadcast, I'll spend a couple minutes on it to try to crystallize it.
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:48.680]  The reason they demonize the West is because it has an idea of freedom.
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:52.200]  Not that we ever even attained it, but just the grasping at that took us to levels we
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:54.520]  never before seen.
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:56.520]  I want to invite him back.
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:00:59.960]  He's probably the fan favorite for the show and I know he's a busy guy.
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:00.960]  He should be on every week.
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:02.160]  My God, he does his own shows as well.
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:05.800]  You can find out about those at trendsresearch.com and it's good to know there's other great
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:10.040]  people out there that are pissed off because here's the deal.
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:11.040]  I'm successful in life.
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:12.200]  Gerald's successful.
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:13.200]  We could do our own thing.
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:18.840]  But I hate seeing these scammers screw everybody and then laugh about it and then destroy our
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:19.840]  prosperity.
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:23.480]  You're going to run a little shotgun with me when Mark Moreno joins us here, but pop
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:24.480]  at any time.
[02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:29.000]  But just in closing, Gerald, we're going to be broadcasting for 48 hours live starting
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.960]  right through the election and the day after it.
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:35.000]  And I would like to invite you to pop in several times for a full hour if you'd like.
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.480]  We're getting millions of people outside of even our terrestrial radio audience that
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:39.480]  come in.
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:44.120]  And I think that's a bellwether of hope that InfoWars does these live events now.
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:47.920]  And the smallest shows get like a million people that tune in when we do stuff, do a
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:48.920]  few hours.
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:50.400]  There's just internet only.
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:51.400]  Sometimes four or five million.
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:52.680]  This is getting very, very exciting.
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:58.080]  I think we're going to have 10 million viewers just on our streams coming up.
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:00.360]  Well, first of all, I'd love to be on.
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:03.800]  But secondly, you are the future and the present.
[02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:11.240]  What you are doing and myself, but you know, InfoWars and the team of people that you have,
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:12.240]  you're the voice.
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:13.480]  There's no voice anymore.
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:15.120]  Look what's going on.
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:18.640]  Just pick up yesterday's papers.
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:20.840]  There's a firing people daily.
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:22.640]  They're shrinking the news hole.
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:24.640]  You turn on the major media.
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:27.920]  It's the same clowns that you hear over and over again.
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:31.420]  You are the present and you are the future.
[02:02:31.420 --> 02:02:37.520]  This is the way and after this election, it's even going to become much bigger.
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:40.400]  And that's why they openly say they're coming after our free speech and they've announced
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:41.400]  that.
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:42.400]  Will they be successful?
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:43.400]  No.
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:46.560]  Unless they kill us, which they may well do.
[02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:49.360]  I mean, look at the track record that they have.
[02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:54.000]  Now, I agree with you and they've even got their fans saying it's time to basically arrest
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  us.
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.800]  They've even got major publications saying that, Gerald.
[02:02:56.800 --> 02:02:59.480]  That's why I'm glad you're there and so many others are there because I think we've reached
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:00.480]  a tipping point.
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:02.560]  We've got enough people on air that know what's happening.
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:03.800]  And before it was just a few of us down.
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:04.800]  There's quite a few.
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:06.280]  I think that brings a lot of safety.
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:10.080]  Well, again, the people are disgusting what was going on.
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:14.880]  Look what's going on around Europe with all these parties, they populist parties.
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:16.920]  Yeah, populist for us.
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:24.120]  The AFD, the Alternative for Deutschland, the Freedom Party, Le Pen's Party, Catalonia.
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:25.320]  One after another.
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:27.640]  So we can do it too.
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:32.680]  And your voice is bigger than anyone else's out there.
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:35.600]  That's putting out the alternative message.
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:39.640]  And you scared me with the Washington Post and even the Austin American statesman admitted
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:43.160]  in articles last week that info wars is bigger than anything out there.
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:45.520]  They now know the metrics and they're crapping their pants.
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:47.800]  Look, you turn into any of these.
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:52.800]  You know the data coming out of CNN and the others, yet they're in the tank.
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:53.800]  Nobody's listening to them.
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:55.240]  An average show, 100,000 viewers.
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:58.040]  I mean, yeah.
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:03:59.920]  So you're the future and the present.
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:01.400]  This is where it's going.
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:05.120]  And after this election, it's always only going to get bigger.
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:10.800]  Man, I tell you, I mean, I know that we just do you do what's right, Gerald.
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:13.760]  And it's not the Trump's perfect, but obviously he's a populist against him.
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:15.440]  But I don't want to get Machiavelli in here.
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:17.480]  But if he gets in, it's going to be a hard road.
[02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:21.200]  It's almost better if Hillary gets in because it'll totally destroy the whole system or
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:22.440]  maybe I'm wrong.
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:23.440]  I don't think so.
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:25.840]  I think if Trump gets in, it would be very big changes.
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:29.080]  Again, I don't agree with him on a lot, but I agree with him on some.
[02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:31.640]  No, no, obviously he will do stuff that will help our economy and stuff.
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:33.560]  But I'm saying then they'll try to sabotage him.
[02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:34.560]  We get Hillary.
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:35.560]  It goes to rock bottom.
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:36.560]  But I agree.
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:37.960]  We got to get Trump in because she wants to start World War Three.
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:39.600]  There's no Congress.
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:41.560]  That's the other thing.
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:43.800]  There's nobody there to stop anybody.
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:45.840]  There are a bunch of look at look at the people.
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:46.840]  Look at the name.
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:47.840]  Gerald, you're on fire.
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:51.040]  Please come back this week if you'll do it and please, you know, join us a lot.
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:52.040]  Gerald Salenta.
[02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:53.960]  People can find his show and more at friendsresearch.com.
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:54.960]  God bless you.
[02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:55.960]  You're amazing.
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:56.960]  Thank you very much for having me.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.960]  Thank you for all you do.
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:04:58.960]  Thank you.
[02:04:58.960 --> 02:04:59.960]  He's on target about these rappers.
[02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:00.960]  We've got to expose their hypocrisy.
[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:01.960]  We'll be back.
[02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:03.560]  Joe Bates here with infowars.com.
[02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:04.560]  Michael Moore.
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:07.480]  Trump's election will be the biggest FU in history.
[02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:12.360]  An article up by Paul Joseph Watson during a speech for his new one man stage performance
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:13.360]  Trumpland.
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:17.800]  Michael Moore remarked that the election of Donald Trump will be the biggest FU in history.
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:21.600]  Moore began by saying he knew a lot of people in Michigan who are going to vote for Trump,
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:25.560]  who are not racist or rednecks, but were sick of their jobs being offshore to places
[02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:26.560]  like Mexico.
[02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:32.160]  Trump's promise to slap a 35% tariff on Ford cars made in Mexico and sent back to America
[02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:37.320]  was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:41.840]  Whether Trump means it or not is kind of irrelevant because he's saying the things to people who
[02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:46.440]  are hurting and it's why every beaten down worthless forgotten working stiff who used
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:50.920]  to be part of what was called the middle class loves Trump, arguing that Trump was the human
[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:54.840]  Molotov cocktail that they've been waiting for, the human hand grenade that they can
[02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:58.360]  legally throw into the system that stole the lives from them.
[02:05:58.360 --> 02:06:01.520]  You can find more reports like this at infowars.com.
[02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:03.400]  I'm Alex Jones with a simple question.
[02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:07.680]  Will you and your family be financially protected if there's another economic meltdown like
[02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:08.680]  many experts?
[02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:11.080]  I believe another devastating crash is coming.
[02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:13.400]  I think it's a matter of when, not if.
[02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:16.120]  Don't wait for another crisis that could wipe out your hard earned money.
[02:06:16.120 --> 02:06:21.680]  Do what I did and call United States Gold Vault at 844-541-ALEX.
[02:06:21.680 --> 02:06:23.080]  It's a company I trust.
[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:27.720]  They're offering gold and silver coin survival packs that could help safeguard your money
[02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:28.960]  in an economic meltdown.
[02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:32.240]  I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks.
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:35.720]  China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is
[02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:36.720]  on the move.
[02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:41.520]  Gold and silver are recognized worldwide as one of the most stable means of protecting
[02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:42.520]  finances.
[02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:48.200]  Don't delay call 844-541-ALEX now and get a rugged double locked bank bag to securely
[02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:50.400]  store your coins absolutely free.
[02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:54.960]  These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority.
[02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:57.760]  I personally own these survival packs and you should too.
[02:06:57.760 --> 02:07:01.400]  Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALEX now.
[02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:07.800]  We're selling a product DNA force that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce
[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:11.120]  about a group you took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:14.560]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:16.760]  it's very, very important.
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:23.400]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:25.680]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:27.760]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:32.120]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:34.960]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:36.640]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:39.560]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:42.720]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:43.760]  It's in powder form.
[02:07:43.760 --> 02:07:46.480]  We have so many five star reviews.
[02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:47.480]  I take this.
[02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:49.280]  This is the product that I take.
[02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:51.960]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:52.960]  We fight the global.
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:53.960]  We fight the new world order.
[02:07:53.960 --> 02:08:00.520]  We cure your DNA force today at infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:23.960 --> 02:08:26.760]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:31.800]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:32.800]  All right.
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:37.280]  They tried to get him arrested when he was in Paris premiering this film earlier this
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:38.280]  year.
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:41.960]  He's a former top advisor to Congress on climate change for the committees.
[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:42.960]  He's Marparano.
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:47.960]  He, of course, helped Han Show with Lord Monks and others to release the emails and information
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:51.400]  proving they were hiding the decline six years ago and covering up what's happening.
[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:52.400]  It's all about a carbon tax.
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:57.360]  Now they're trying to pass laws here in the U.S. to arrest people that deny climate change.
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:08:58.960]  Well, we don't deny the climate change.
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:01.280]  We're saying it in man-made.
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:05.560]  And then separately, Russia's coming out saying it's a carbon tax to shut down countries
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:06.960]  so they want to sanction them for it.
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:10.480]  They've been meeting with, what is it, 15 attorney generals trying to figure out ways
[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:12.000]  to indict Mark Moreno.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.080]  So I mean, they mentioned Mark Moreno.
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:15.080]  Okay.
[02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:17.880]  They want to arrest this guy, whether you agree with him or not.
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:21.480]  And by the way, they say the science has settled.
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:22.480]  It's all part of the mind control.
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:24.920]  The science is anything but settled.
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:29.440]  From their perspective, I mean, carbon dioxide, we're at a very low point in our history.
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:32.360]  But I'm not going to get into that, okay?
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:35.560]  The point is, is that this is social control over energy.
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:36.880]  We're now carrying with EVD.
[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:38.240]  It just came out.
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:43.760]  It's climate hustle available at infowarstore.com, extremely powerful.
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:44.760]  Show it to your church.
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:47.320]  Show it to your local library.
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:48.320]  Donate a copy of the library.
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:50.880]  It'll be watched hundreds of times.
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:51.880]  There's no reviews yet.
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:55.840]  It's just went on sale today, but the reviews from other critics have been astounding.
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:10:01.160]  And again, working with Lord Monks and others, they got it where they pulled the whole inconvenient
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:05.440]  fraud movie, an inconvenient truth by Al Gore out of British schools because it was all
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:06.440]  lies.
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:08.640]  You know, polar bears can't swim and all those other crap.
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:12.400]  This is what they do, ladies and gentlemen, to create this guilt and then take over the
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:14.640]  entire environmental movement and distract it.
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:15.640]  But tremendous.
[02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:22.040]  Al Thomas, dynamite, Breitbart News, national review, brutal and extremely funny.
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:23.040]  Climate hustle.
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:26.720]  Are they trying to control climate or you?
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:29.640]  You've got to get it now at infowarstore.com.
[02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:32.440]  That way you're supporting the great work of Mark Moreno.
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:33.440]  You're supporting the info war.
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:34.440]  It's a 360 win.
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:36.360]  Joe Biggs is riding a shotgun with me for the hour.
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:38.080]  Just to add commentary anytime he likes.
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:40.200]  Working on a bunch of big investigative reports right now.
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:44.720]  We have Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign and the media has figured out one
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:46.760]  of his only advisers he listens to.
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:51.040]  That's the great part about Trump listening to anybody unless you straight shoot him.
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:53.040]  That's the big secret.
[02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:54.840]  And it's just like a pitch to a boss.
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:55.840]  He's like, hit him.
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:58.520]  And then if he gets the pitch, then you got Trump's here.
[02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:02.120]  Everybody else he doesn't listen to, but they're totally flipping out his way ahead in real
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:03.120]  polls.
[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:04.280]  That's why they're getting ready to try to steal it.
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:06.800]  So we'll talk about everything with Mark Moreno.
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:07.800]  ClimateDepote.com.
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:11.800]  Mr. Moreno, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:13.280]  Thank you, Alex and Joe.
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:14.880]  Happy to be here today.
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:15.880]  Thank you.
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:16.880]  Well, so much going on.
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:17.880]  I mean, let's talk about the film.
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:19.800]  Obviously, our listeners are informed.
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:22.360]  They need to now get this out there.
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:23.360]  Let's talk about the film.
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:24.360]  You went through to put it out.
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:25.600]  Why it's so powerful.
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:27.840]  And then let's get into the current attacks we're witnessing.
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:28.840]  Sure.
[02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:29.840]  Okay.
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:30.840]  The film came out.
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:35.320]  Actually, as you mentioned, Alex, we had our premiere back in Paris last December.
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:39.440]  And the morning of our premiere, we had it in a 100 year old theater in downtown Paris
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:42.720]  right during the United Nations climate summit.
[02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:45.520]  They had wanted posters of me all over the city.
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:49.520]  Wanted for being a, quote, climate criminal, the local environmental groups.
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:52.920]  And they actually, and it was a couple other people they went after.
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:57.600]  One of them was an Australian energy CEO who left Paris because they felt like their physical
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:11:58.600]  safety was being threatened.
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:11:59.600]  Yeah.
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:00.600]  This isn't tongue-in-cheek.
[02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:01.600]  This isn't tongue-in-cheek.
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:02.600]  They want you arrested.
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:03.600]  They do.
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:08.320]  In fact, we have United States senators pushing racketeering charges against global warming
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:09.320]  skeptics.
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:13.360]  In the film, Alex, Climate Hustle, you get to see Robert F. Kennedy Jr. say, we need
[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:18.200]  to put climate skeptics at the Hague with three square meals and a cop with all the
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:19.840]  other war criminals.
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:25.200]  And we have NASA's lead global warming scientist talk about trying skeptics for, quote, crimes
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:27.320]  against humanity, unquote.
[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:29.960]  Does that phrase sound familiar?
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:34.240]  This is what they want to do to skeptics because we're in their way.
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:38.720]  And you're making the analogy of you open up about talking about Donald Trump in a way
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:44.960]  it's almost identical type, belittling and trashing and mainstream media attacks on
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:45.960]  skeptics.
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:51.960]  They're trying to make us toxic, put us in jail, minimize us, ridicule, they're making
[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:52.960]  everyone afraid.
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:53.960]  Sure.
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:54.960]  Everybody overuses Nazi analogies.
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:12:58.160]  But this is what the Nazis did for five, six years before they started the roundup
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:12:59.160]  of Jews.
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:06.680]  Well, in fact, in our film, they actually compare climate skeptics to Holocaust deniers.
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:10.960]  And they'll say a Holocaust denier climate skeptic, there is no difference between them.
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:13.680]  And they go through a whole bunch of stuff and they want us in jail.
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:18.680]  They try to tie us to any negative thing in their minds that they can think of.
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:21.360]  And so this is where we are right now.
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:25.960]  I just got back from Brussels last week and I premiered the film at the EU Parliament.
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:30.640]  And we had some, you know, some global warming activists show up and try to challenge us
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:31.640]  in the Q&A.
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:36.240]  But I was very excited that a lot of members of parliament showed up from Germany, from
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:37.240]  the UK.
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:42.480]  That's the positive news is, just like WikiLeaks, we have the emails, people forget where they
[02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:43.480]  admit it's all fraud.
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:45.000]  I mean, we have them.
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:48.600]  Yeah, we have on the emails at the, at the, at the, at the, at the, at the, at the, called
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:49.760]  the climate gate scandal.
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:55.480]  We have the top scientists of the United Nations, essentially admitting in these emails that
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:59.120]  they are colluding to create a narrative on global warming.
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:03.840]  And they openly talk about in emails, if any scientists disagree, they go after the journal
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:08.400]  editors that would publish their work, they go after ruining these scientists career.
[02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:12.560]  And they admit it's a giant campaign cause and it's all meant everything's got to be
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:14.480]  on message or you're out.
[02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:19.720]  And in climate hustle, we actually have United Nations lead authors who've turned against
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:23.480]  the UN because they say it's essentially a political organization.
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:27.760]  Sure, let's expand on that because it parallels Hillary, where you've got Andrea Mitchell getting
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:31.520]  the phone from the press secretary and then asking the question, rigging it in front of
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:35.560]  us, rigged polls, the emails come out, they're rigging everything, but they're, they're sitting
[02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:37.760]  people to attack Trump rallies and blaming him.
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:45.440]  I mean, it's just such a paradox where the media is in such lockstep as they implode.
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:49.840]  But then I wonder, will they get across the finish line and bring an authoritarianism
[02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:53.480]  as they're calling for, to shut down Drudge, to shut down you, to shut down us.
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:55.880]  I mean, they all say, you know, I'm a dark heart.
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:14:56.880]  I don't have a right to exist.
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:01.680]  I mean, now I have Hillary saying my name, her surrogate saying, shut him down, he's
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:02.680]  evil.
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:06.280]  I mean, and you read the newspaper, I'm racist and then they don't say why I'm racist or
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:08.560]  you're a criminal, you need to be hit with racketeering.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:15.160]  They name you by name because you dare, I mean, these people are crazy.
[02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:20.720]  It's gotten to such a point where they honestly believe that they cannot tolerate any debate
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:24.480]  and the only solution is to shut us down and shut us down completely.
[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:29.320]  Now, one of the ways they're going to do that now, and they're going after energy, our sources
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:34.320]  of energy, we at Al Gore attend a New York City press conference with the state's attorney
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:36.920]  general, several of them back in March of this year.
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:41.200]  I actually made it to the press conference at the very end and they laid out their plan.
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:45.560]  What they're going to do, Alex, is they're going to essentially call every weather event
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:49.080]  now fossil fuel poisoned weather, you know, every hurricane.
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:50.080]  Well, how are they doing that?
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:51.640]  I've seen them beta test.
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:52.640]  Anything happens.
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:56.480]  I mean, you saw them, they said the latest hurricane was caused by humans.
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:15:59.600]  And first thing that I want to do, that Washington Post, a former reporter for the Washington
[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:04.520]  Post actually came out, they're calling for a new metric now, a new way to measure hurricanes.
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:05.520]  Why?
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:07.920]  Because we're an historic record low hurricane.
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:08.920]  That's right.
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:12.560]  The main U.S. has not been hit in nine years directly by one, the lowest ever recorded
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:13.720]  in modern history.
[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:15.160]  That's even the weather channel.
[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:19.800]  But meanwhile, I saw NBC News, ABC and others say, this is why Obama needs the climate deal
[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:21.360]  because of this hurricane.
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:22.680]  Exactly.
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:27.160]  So every time they basically said, many bad things will happen with global warming.
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:31.040]  So now every time a bad thing happens, and I mean, any time a bad thing.
[02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:35.800]  In fact, in New York Times, yesterday or this morning, I actually had an article about child
[02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:40.040]  marriage forced child marriages are going to go up because of global warming.
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:42.080]  They actually said a, quote, surge.
[02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:47.200]  Oh, they say war is going to cause, actually studies show war goes down during global warming
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:48.200]  because there's more food.
[02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:52.280]  The problem is cooling actually causes more waters, there's less damn food, excuse me.
[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:53.280]  Yes.
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:58.360]  So essentially on hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts on every single measure, either declining
[02:16:58.360 --> 02:16:59.960]  or no trend in it.
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:04.320]  But the only way they can get these unprecedented is they want a new way to measure.
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:06.440]  We already know they've altered past temperatures.
[02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:12.000]  They've cooled the 1930s they've made to basically show cooling, warming trends that didn't
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:13.000]  previously exist.
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:16.680]  It's like a company losing money and you hire a new accountant, he read us all the
[02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:21.440]  time, we just put mainline headlines up, New York Times, you name it.
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:24.040]  They're now going to redefine hurricanes to make more of them.
[02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:27.800]  So, oh, the record lows, we'll just say, because the earth's cooling, you're going to have
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:28.800]  less of them.
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:31.160]  So now they'll just redefine them.
[02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:34.760]  And what they're going to do with that redefinition now, again, we have climate activists like
[02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:37.560]  Brad Johnson who call it fossil fuel poison weather.
[02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:39.160]  Every time is a bad storm.
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:44.400]  They are now going, say New Jersey gets flooded by the remnants of a tropical storm or hurricane.
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:46.280]  They're now going to go after Exxon Mobil.
[02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:50.800]  They're going to go after any other corporation, any, any energy source and say the attorney
[02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:56.960]  generals are and say, you created this by your fossil fuel production, therefore you owe
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:17:57.960]  millions.
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:17:58.960]  Sure.
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:01.840]  So it's a total shakedown and then General Electric and others will be exempt.
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:04.960]  So, so my brain, let's get back to this because you're a stalwart guy, you're probably the
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:05.960]  number one, number two guy.
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:09.640]  It's either you or Moncton worldwide fighting this, you travel the planet.
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:10.640]  You've gone through hell.
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:12.800]  I'm trying to lionize you, but you're a hero for all of us.
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:14.720]  This is the global government taxing mechanism.
[02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:15.720]  You're the champion.
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:20.560]  And I read the news and they say people like Mark Moreno need to be looked at for indictment
[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:24.320]  for racketeering because he's lying about this threat to humanity.
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:26.160]  I mean, this is so crazy.
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:29.960]  So speaking to that, where is this going with 15 attorney generals meeting in secret?
[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:33.200]  We learned three months ago, trying to figure out how to indict you and others.
[02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:35.600]  In fact, I've been told I'm now on the list as well.
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:36.600]  So hold on.
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:41.160]  Are you saying that they're going to reclassify so a tropical storm would now be a hurricane?
[02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:42.160]  Yes.
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:43.160]  And they're just going to go all the way down.
[02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:46.040]  So it's going to be a tropical storm, like a flood or something?
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:47.040]  Yeah.
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:48.040]  This is ridiculous.
[02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:49.040]  You did it, Joe.
[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:50.040]  You need to pay money.
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:53.560]  But separately, they want to arrest him.
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:54.800]  It's not talk now.
[02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:59.440]  This is the most ridiculous thing that these people can actually sit here and actually
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:05.040]  alter how we've been doing this, scientifically monitoring and classifying these hurricanes.
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:06.240]  And now they want to drop it down.
[02:19:06.240 --> 02:19:07.240]  They're going to unfit this agenda.
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:08.240]  I mean, that's just...
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:10.800]  Well, they're telling us they're going to redefine mother and father and marriage.
[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:16.920]  It's all about they're a cult of bean counting pinheads that want to control reality.
[02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:20.280]  These people are the biggest control freaks because, listen, those that teach have never
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:21.280]  done.
[02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:24.880]  And I'm not bashing all teachers and professors, but they've never done anything.
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:28.360]  All they want to do is make us do stuff to build it the way they want.
[02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:29.360]  Mark Moreno.
[02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:30.360]  And it's even more interesting.
[02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:35.520]  In the film, Climate Hustle Allege, you'll see Al Gore talk about there's too many...
[02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:38.600]  Africa is projected to have too many people, essentially.
[02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:42.360]  And he actually says we need to make fertility management ubiquitous.
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:45.360]  Now, here we have a white, wealthy Western politician.
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:46.960]  Let's get rid of black people.
[02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:47.960]  Oh, I know.
[02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:48.960]  Exactly.
[02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:49.960]  You can't have cars.
[02:19:49.960 --> 02:19:50.960]  You can't have air conditioning.
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:51.960]  And we've got to kill your babies.
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:53.480]  But it's okay because we're liberal.
[02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:55.360]  Specifically, we talk about that.
[02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:56.360]  We talk about that.
[02:19:56.360 --> 02:19:57.360]  This is incredible.
[02:19:57.360 --> 02:19:58.360]  Yes.
[02:19:58.360 --> 02:19:59.360]  And that's a huge one.
[02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:03.760]  The Sierra Club has come out with whole proposals to limit the one child, essentially
[02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:07.920]  one child per family policy, but many environmental groups are calling for.
[02:20:07.920 --> 02:20:12.280]  We have people going around college campuses preaching against having any children because
[02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:14.800]  the earth can't handle it.
[02:20:14.800 --> 02:20:21.600]  Jude Apanao, the big Hollywood producer, recently came out and did a pro-overpopulation control.
[02:20:21.600 --> 02:20:24.400]  Overpopulation is as big a part of global warming as a lot of the other...
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:25.400]  Sure.
[02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:26.400]  It's eugenics.
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:27.400]  That's the excuse to turn the energy off.
[02:20:27.400 --> 02:20:30.040]  When the truth is, if you just leave stuff alone, it's going to crest at 9 billion.
[02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:31.560]  If you don't then stabilize, things will collapse.
[02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:34.240]  You've got to have two kids to take care of two parents.
[02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:36.240]  All the actuaries are 100%.
[02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:37.240]  No one's denying that.
[02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:39.920]  So what's the larger agenda, A, B?
[02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:41.600]  How is it going for them right now?
[02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:44.840]  Because it seems like we're winning the information war, correct me if I'm wrong, but they just
[02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:45.840]  don't care.
[02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:46.840]  They're just moving forward.
[02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:49.120]  Here's the problem.
[02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:53.240]  Skeptics, we have absolutely not only won the information war, previously we'd won
[02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:54.800]  the political battles.
[02:20:54.800 --> 02:20:58.960]  Again, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010.
[02:20:58.960 --> 02:21:01.680]  Every year climate bills came up before the United States Congress.
[02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:03.680]  They were defeated soundly.
[02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:07.280]  Switchboards, I worked on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
[02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:11.600]  Switchboards would come in overwhelmingly, 10 to 1, against climate bills.
[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:12.600]  So what happened?
[02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:15.840]  President Obama said, I don't need no stinking Congress.
[02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:20.400]  He did, through executive order, he did what Congress would never have done because the
[02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:22.040]  people would never have allowed him.
[02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:26.360]  He passed essentially domestic climate legislation through the EPA.
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:28.880]  He's declared what we exhale from our mouth.
[02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:33.360]  Human breath is now toxic according to the United States federal government, carbon dioxide.
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:36.080]  But we inhale oxygen, we exhale carbon dioxide.
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:37.840]  We are now a pollutant.
[02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:42.880]  Human beings are breathing out a pollutant, which is now regulated by the government.
[02:21:42.880 --> 02:21:44.600]  The public isn't even aware of this.
[02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:46.560]  The Congress had no vote on it.
[02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:51.240]  And good luck in the courts trying to get Obama and Clinton judges to over, frankly,
[02:21:51.240 --> 02:21:52.240]  Bush judges.
[02:21:52.240 --> 02:21:55.440]  I was about to say, because of the Supreme Court just judgment, what, 10 years ago,
[02:21:55.440 --> 02:21:59.120]  saying that the EPA can operate on its own.
[02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:03.120]  They said that the EPA can actually determine whether carbon dioxide is a pollutant, which
[02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:04.320]  is all they needed to hear.
[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:08.800]  So now that that's a pollutant, skeptics have lost that battle.
[02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:12.280]  We have domestic climate legislation without a single vote at Congress and without the
[02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:13.280]  public being aware.
[02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:15.600]  I tell leftists, I go, China has no controls.
[02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:16.600]  All our jobs are moving there.
[02:22:16.600 --> 02:22:18.080]  They have dirty plants.
[02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:19.080]  Ours are clean.
[02:22:19.080 --> 02:22:21.280]  You understand that the energy there is three times cheaper.
[02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:22.280]  We'll never have a job.
[02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:23.680]  And they just go, shut up.
[02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:24.680]  I'm saving the earth.
[02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:26.600]  And I'm like, they've got dirty plants.
[02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:28.320]  Mexico has dirty plants.
[02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:29.600]  This just doesn't even make sense.
[02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:34.440]  Yeah, I was just, when I got, I was just in Brussels last week, all of the European, what's
[02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:40.440]  left of European manufacturing, what's left of any of any semblance of European economic
[02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:45.960]  growth is literally being choked out by the central planners in Brussels and it's going
[02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:46.960]  everywhere else.
[02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:47.960]  China.
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:51.280]  I was about to say clearly how the West was conquered by globalists was doing these trade
[02:22:51.280 --> 02:22:53.520]  deals, energy deals to shut us off.
[02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:57.160]  So that's why we have Brexit, why Russia is pulling out of the new world order.
[02:22:57.160 --> 02:22:58.160]  We're pulling out.
[02:22:58.160 --> 02:23:02.680]  We put the whole Trump phenomenon is about Mark Moreno, the new film, it's award winning
[02:23:02.680 --> 02:23:03.680]  came out last December.
[02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:07.840]  Now available on DVD, climate hustle at infowarstore.com.
[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:13.120]  Such a powerful film, so key, very entertaining, very funny, way better than a Michael Moore
[02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:14.120]  film.
[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:15.120]  Folks, get aggressive.
[02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:16.120]  Show it to your church.
[02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:17.120]  Show it to your Sunday school.
[02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:18.800]  Show it to your neighbors.
[02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:20.040]  This is an info war.
[02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:21.720]  People are now hungry for the truth.
[02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:26.400]  We're winning the info war, but we're not winning because centrally the controllers are
[02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:29.100]  still there, but we're we're at that tipping point.
[02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:33.680]  Get climate hustle infowarstore.com, get it at climate hustle.com for Mark Moreno.
[02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:34.680]  I don't care.
[02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:36.160]  Just get it and get it out.
[02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:39.600]  So and jump in any time Joe, basically because I got you here is your hot on the subject.
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:42.040]  Mark Moreno, one of the chief fighters of this fraud worldwide.
[02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:46.000]  When I talked to actual liberals, most of them now admit this is a fraud.
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:49.040]  They just admit though this is their global government funding mechanism.
[02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:50.760]  So they just want to play an economy.
[02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:53.440]  They see themselves living in coffin apartments.
[02:23:53.440 --> 02:23:57.440]  They see themselves as like flagellating or beating themselves with whips.
[02:23:57.440 --> 02:23:59.080]  This is some type of austerity.
[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:00.640]  That's a beautiful, pious thing to do.
[02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:04.320]  Well, it's only going to be a matter of time before people see that this is BS as well.
[02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:07.560]  You know, a lot of these people, those liberals don't see that yet, but you're starting to
[02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:11.640]  see a great awakening happening on Twitter, on social media, especially with these Podesta
[02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:12.640]  emails coming up.
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:14.360]  Because people are starting to see that collusion.
[02:24:14.360 --> 02:24:17.800]  People are starting to see how the DNC, the Democrats are lying about everything.
[02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:21.560]  And it's only going to be a matter of time before that rolls over onto where people
[02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:23.600]  start going, well, what else are they lying about?
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:25.240]  Well, what else have I been lied about too?
[02:24:25.240 --> 02:24:28.000]  And eventually they're going to see this movie or they're going to hear about it and
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:31.640]  they're going to go, well, you know, maybe this entire time I did have a bunch of BS
[02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:35.480]  pumped into my head and maybe the people on the right aren't so crazy.
[02:24:35.480 --> 02:24:36.480]  Maybe this is ridiculous.
[02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:37.480]  Sure, Mark.
[02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:38.480]  Great point, Mark.
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:39.480]  Yeah, Joe.
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:40.480]  Absolutely.
[02:24:40.480 --> 02:24:44.080]  In fact, one of the things about climate hustle that we did, we interviewed a friend.
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:50.200]  We have a French socialist scientist, Dr. Claude Allegra, who originally screamed the alarm
[02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:52.080]  about global warming in the 1990s.
[02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:57.080]  He has now reversed himself as one of the leading skeptical scientists in Europe right
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:24:58.080]  now.
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:00.440]  We have a Dr. Robert Geingach, University of Pennsylvania.
[02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:04.760]  He voted for Al Gore, thinks he's a smart man, but he thinks that global warming is,
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:06.040]  they have it completely wrong.
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:11.360]  And he talks about the historic level levels of CO2 and says CO2 is not the control knob.
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:16.360]  We interview Dr. Caleb Rosseter, a climate statistician from American University, an
[02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:23.240]  anti-war liberal Democrat, all the things that a Republican would say, he has now reversed
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:24.440]  himself on global warming.
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:28.480]  And he talks about once he came out as a skeptic, all of his partners in the Democratic
[02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:32.080]  Left, he was stripped of his role in organizations.
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:34.000]  He wouldn't let him publish his material.
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:37.840]  We interviewed other scientists, Dr. Dennis Rancourt, a man of the political realm.
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:38.840]  Sure.
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:39.840]  Let me ask you this.
[02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:43.560]  Isn't it the persecution we're seeing is accelerating the resistance, though, because
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:46.840]  they thought people were just going along with this because of intimidation.
[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:50.640]  Now that intimidation is actually open and naked, it seems like opposition is only forming
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:51.640]  more.
[02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:52.640]  Absolutely.
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:58.080]  In fact, the more and more opposition to these scientists speaking out, it has forced other
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:25:59.080]  scientists to come out.
[02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:00.760]  Well, you'll see that in the film.
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:02.040]  It actually has backfired.
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:07.480]  We actually feature Lord Moncton talking about how this anti-free speech and intimidation
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:09.880]  has backfired and forced other scientists.
[02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:13.920]  We interviewed a scientist, a statistician from Cornell, who literally says the only
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:19.040]  reason he finally spoke out was because Al Gore and the United Nations chief were smearing
[02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:21.800]  skeptics and ridiculing and belittling them.
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:23.600]  So in that regard, they're coming out.
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:26.600]  Unfortunately, they all admit it hasn't helped their careers.
[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:33.160]  We have the first woman PhD meteorologist, Dr. Joanne Simpson, worked at NASA for 50
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:34.160]  years.
[02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:35.160]  She was a practicing meteorologist.
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:37.600]  Didn't say a word about skepticism.
[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:42.360]  She retires from NASA and says, now that I'm retired, I can say I'm a skeptic.
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:47.960]  That is how powerful the, I guess you'd call it, the narrative is for scientists.
[02:26:47.960 --> 02:26:51.720]  The first woman PhD scientist was beaten into silence until after she retired.
[02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:52.720]  Sure.
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:53.720]  Well, I'll tell you what's frustrating, Mark.
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:56.280]  And you know all this because you've been on the committee and in the Senate that has
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:27:02.560]  all the science, but just to basically put a gestalt out there, they know if you go back
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:07.960]  millions of years ago, I mean, CO2 was hundreds of times higher.
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:09.240]  Now it's this tiny trace gas.
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:15.000]  A lot of evidence shows Mars had an atmosphere, lost its CO2, it collapsed, and the planet
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:16.000]  died.
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  Okay.
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.840]  And that's what mainline science believes now Mars was, we're probably from there.
[02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:25.520]  But the whole point is, is that we know it's super low.
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:27.360]  We know it's all a lie.
[02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:31.720]  We know that it's not correlated to the temperature at the ways they're saying.
[02:27:31.720 --> 02:27:37.200]  So why the hell are they trying to do this if the planet's losing its atmosphere?
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:41.800]  Well, the very simple reason is that in fact, the EU climate commission, again, I was in
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:45.880]  Brussels, has actually on record a few years ago, it's saying, even if we're wrong in the
[02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:47.960]  science, we're doing right by policy.
[02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:52.440]  In other words, they admit, the leaders of this admit it's not about science.
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:57.880]  It's all about essentially planning our economy and using whatever the latest environmental
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:02.280]  scare is, Amazon rainforest overpopulation and now global warming.
[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:06.240]  And it's always, no matter what the scare is, the solution is always the same, more
[02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:10.360]  central planning, more command and control, and more, and Al Gore's
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:14.200]  We only got a minute and a half left, Mark Moreno, ClimateDepot.com is obviously your
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:15.200]  big news site.
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:17.200]  Climate Hustle, the new film available at infowarstore.com.
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:22.040]  Folks, powerful, get it out to everybody.
[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:24.960]  Just a summation to one minute, where is the fight right now?
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:27.120]  Clearly, they want to tax the carbon cycle.
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:28.120]  Where's the fight?
[02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:31.240]  Well, the biggest fight right now is this election.
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:36.440]  Donald Trump is the first Republican presidential nominee to declare himself a bold skeptic
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:41.560]  and actually have a plan to defund the United Nations climate panel to withdraw from the
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:44.560]  UN treaty and to overturn the executive orders.
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:51.000]  Donald Trump compared to George HW Bush, Bob Dole, George W. Bush, McCain and Romney.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:55.120]  There is no, I don't understand it, how these some conservatives say, oh, I can't vote for
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:56.560]  Trump because he's not conservative.
[02:28:56.560 --> 02:29:00.640]  There has never been a Republican nominee that has ever staked out a position on climate
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:01.640]  like this ever.
[02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:05.240]  Mitt Romney hung out and used Obama's advisers on climate.
[02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:07.320]  John McCain supported climate bills.
[02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:11.400]  George W. Bush rubber stamped and accepted every United Nations report.
[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:14.240]  And George HW Bush got us into this mess.
[02:29:14.240 --> 02:29:17.640]  What Republican can you compare Donald Trump to unfavorably?
[02:29:17.640 --> 02:29:18.640]  It makes no sense.
[02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:22.480]  Other, you have to go back to Reagan to find out maybe a president of equal to Donald,
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:23.480]  with Donald Trump.
[02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:28.240]  He models himself after absolutely if China doesn't have carbon taxes, we don't.
[02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:29.240]  Debates over.
[02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:30.240]  We don't do it till you do it.
[02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:31.240]  Forget even debating whether it's good or not.
[02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:32.240]  We know it's a fraud.
[02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:33.240]  Till you do it, we don't do it.
[02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:36.320]  That's why the whole power structure we hate is against Trump.
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:37.320]  Trump or bust.
[02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:40.320]  Do you think there's going to be a landslide or will they try to seal it, Mark?
[02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:41.840]  That's a very good question.
[02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:44.120]  It's a question of how it's the Brexit model.
[02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:46.920]  How many people the pollsters are missing are going to come out?
[02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:47.920]  It could be a squeaker.
[02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:48.920]  It's hard to say.
[02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:49.920]  All right.
[02:29:49.920 --> 02:29:50.920]  The film available at infowarstore.com.
[02:29:50.920 --> 02:29:51.920]  Great job, Mark.
[02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:52.920]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.920 --> 02:29:54.920]  It's set to fire on the run.
[02:29:54.920 --> 02:29:57.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:57.560 --> 02:30:05.800]  Hey there, this is Joe Biggs with infowars.com with a fun and exciting report by The Sun.
[02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:10.220]  He virtually rubbed a microdge woman sexually assaulted in virtual reality.
[02:30:10.220 --> 02:30:15.240]  The VR version was trying out the new technology for the first time with a game called Weaver.
[02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:20.160]  What a man using the pseudonym Big Bro 442 virtually grobether.
[02:30:20.160 --> 02:30:22.120]  We have decided not to name the woman.
[02:30:22.120 --> 02:30:26.160]  wrote, in between a wave of zombies and demons to shoot down, I was hanging out next to Big
[02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:32.600]  Bro 442. Suddenly, Big Bro 442's disembodied helmet faced me dead on and he started virtually
[02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:36.840]  rubbing my chest. The woman's first foray into virtual reality started off well as he
[02:30:36.840 --> 02:30:41.280]  experienced one me over, lock, stock, and barrel. But just after three minutes in the
[02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:47.040]  virtual world, Big Bro 442 showed up and ruined everything. The woman cried, stop! To deter
[02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:52.400]  the heavy tech breather. Big Bro 442 came back at her again and she added, women after
[02:30:52.400 --> 02:30:56.600]  all are supposed to be cool and take on any form of sexual harassment with a laugh, but
[02:30:56.600 --> 02:31:26.560]  I still told him to stop. You can find more reports like this at infowars.com.

[02:32:24.280 --> 02:32:28.720]  In the history of infowars life, we brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival
[02:32:28.720 --> 02:32:34.320]  Shield X2, SuperMell Vitality, and so many others. But I am most proud of the product
[02:32:34.320 --> 02:32:39.000]  we're now launching today with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing
[02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:45.040]  process designed for maximized effects. This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin
[02:32:45.040 --> 02:32:50.960]  mineral products. The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or

[02:33:06.160 --> 02:33:11.560]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[02:33:11.560 --> 02:33:19.880]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:34.440]  We are now only 13 days out from this incredibly important historic general election. Joe Beggs
[02:33:34.440 --> 02:33:40.280]  is riding shotgun with me. Do we have Roger Stone on the line yet? Good. We're going to him in just
[02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:47.400]  a moment. I have a ton of other news we haven't gotten to yet, but clearly as the New Wiki League
[02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:52.360]  show, they're oversampling for Hillary. That's been the plan all along. What does that signify?
[02:33:53.320 --> 02:33:59.800]  When they add nine at the low end to 40 plus percent more Democrats in a sample. That shows
[02:33:59.800 --> 02:34:03.800]  massive landslide for Trump, but we don't want to make people overconfident where they don't go out
[02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:09.720]  and vote because evidence of vote flipping and machines going out in Texas. We're up on DrudgeReport.com
[02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:13.960]  with all of this. Joe Beggs is here with me. First off, I just talked about this film.
[02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:20.360]  It's now available on DVD here in the United States. It is Climate Hustle put up by Mark
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:26.040]  Moreno, Lord Moncton and others. This is the heart of their takeover plan. People need to get this
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:33.160]  film. It also makes the transmission possible. We've got 25% off on Brainforce, our top new

[02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:51.800]  Solutions from Science. I bought a generator from them 10 years ago. Obviously, they've upgraded it
[02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:57.480]  since then. I bought another one, I guess, last year of the latest design, and I got them as a
[02:35:57.480 --> 02:36:03.240]  sponsor, because I was researching the best affordable, high-quality, low-cost systems that
[02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:08.280]  were expandable. And they've got one, ladies and gentlemen, their perfect power solar generator.
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:11.960]  You get it below cost. If you've never done a special like this, this is their top-of-the-line
[02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:17.080]  model. The one that I use at my house is expandable. Normally, around $6,000 or letting them go for
[02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:23.320]  around $1,500. Visit powergridchaos.com. It's powergridchaos.com, and get yours before they're
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:30.200]  gone. They have a lot of other great products as well. They're on the site. And again, info wars
[02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:36.600]  by necessity. They say necessity is the mother of invention. We are mainly fun about products we
[02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:40.120]  sell, but we also have sponsors. We did that so we wouldn't be beholden to big corporations
[02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:45.000]  or the globalists. This is the future model, and it is you supporting the broadcast, spreading the
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:50.280]  word, but also buying the products that makes it all possible. So thank you all for your support.
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:55.160]  Joe Biggs is here with me. Obviously, he's a busy man from ahead of the Trump campaign.
[02:36:56.040 --> 02:37:01.640]  Best-selling author, Roger Stone. I love him because he's fearless. He's always given us good
[02:37:01.640 --> 02:37:05.720]  intel. Never shared us wrong. That's why they say such a big disinfo opera because it's the opposite.
[02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:11.320]  Roger, so much has happened. What do you want to hit front and center with 13 days out right now?
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:19.320]  Well, Alex, got to be honest with you. All signs point to Hillary attempting to steal this election
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:24.920]  when you look at the massive and enthusiastic turnout at Trump's public appearances,
[02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:33.000]  when you look at the paltry and uninspiring turnout at her public appearances, when you add to that
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:40.040]  the new WikiLeaks information demonstrating a systematic inflating and manipulating of the polls
[02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:51.320]  to create an anticipation level for her support. I think that they will do anything necessary
[02:37:51.320 --> 02:37:56.760]  to hijack this election. I have long thought, and I've said here on InfoWars several times,
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:38:03.880]  that while I do think voter fraud is an issue, it is the machine manipulation that is more
[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:09.240]  concerning to me because you see that's the perfect crime, and that allows them to move
[02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:14.760]  hundreds and thousands of votes, other than one or two here or there, through the old-fashioned
[02:38:14.760 --> 02:38:24.200]  method of voter fraud. It is why I'm hunkered down right now with an undisclosed location
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:30.520]  with a bunch of IT people and computer jockeys and other political scientists and at least
[02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:36.680]  two pollsters who are helping with us to put the finishing touches on the exit poll that we intend
[02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:44.040]  to conduct nationally for StopTheSteel.org. Alex, I know you've been very supportive of this effort.
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:50.920]  It is a non-profit effort. Everybody involved is a volunteer. And by the way, it's got the London
[02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:56.680]  Guardian, the New York Times implying you're involved in manipulating the election, but all
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:39:01.160]  you're doing is trying to push exit polls out of the hallmark of our republic. We're doing...
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:07.160]  And let's go through this. We are only interested in talking to voters after they have voted. This
[02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:12.680]  is not a poll-watching operation. The Trump campaign is doing a massive poll-watching operation.
[02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:18.840]  This is an exit poll. So how could we be intimidating voters after they vote? Secondarily,
[02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:24.600]  our targets are not selected on the basis of race. That is false. I've never said that. They're
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:29.720]  selected on the basis of one-party rule. We're going to go to the places where one party,
[02:39:29.720 --> 02:39:35.480]  the Democrats, control the state, the county, the city, and the local precinct, because that's where
[02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:42.840]  the abnormalities and their regularities will take place. And then, of course, there's the
[02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:49.880]  denigration of our volunteers, roughnecks, thugs, poodrums. No, they're volunteers. They're average
[02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:54.920]  Americans who support Donald Trump. It's funny you say that. This weekend, I was monitoring MBR
[02:39:54.920 --> 02:40:00.440]  and they said Roger Stone's running a campaign to go into black communities and intimidate people
[02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:06.600]  with a bunch of, well, you know, rednecks. So they're really pissed. Yeah, it's not even close to
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:13.000]  true. I mean, some of these communities will be majority minority. Others will not. We're going
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:17.720]  to look at those precincts in Nevada, for example, in Clark County. Well, why are you not supposed
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:23.880]  to look at it? But the security force of the European Union is going to be here overseeing
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:30.920]  our elections. Yeah, look, it's an insult. And this is a massive undertaking, but to be very
[02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:36.920]  clear, we're talking about going into several thousand precincts in strategic states, strategic
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:42.680]  counties, and conducting from the moment the polls open to the moment the polls close a
[02:40:42.680 --> 02:40:49.080]  scientifically based exit poll. We're not loading it for anyone, but let me be very clear on what
[02:40:49.080 --> 02:40:55.160]  the goal is, Alex. The international standard for elections, the standard used by our state
[02:40:55.160 --> 02:41:00.600]  department, standard used by Hillary Clinton herself, is that there can be no more than a
[02:41:00.600 --> 02:41:06.360]  2% deviance between the actual results and exit polls conducted by the US government.
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:13.640]  All we're asking for here is the exact same standard. If we conduct these polls and we find
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:20.360]  that everything is within that two point margin, then we can conclude this wasn't honest in the
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:27.400]  election, fairly conducted and has integrity. If we have widespread pattern of swings, 8, 9, 10,
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:33.000]  12%, well, then you'll have evidence that could be used in court to challenge this election. And
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:40.280]  that is our goal to find out. I'm not making any preconceived prediction. Let's see what the actual
[02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:45.400]  question is. Sure, and jumping into it, you've got a lot of questions. You can't have the cake
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:49.080]  and eat it too and say Trump's trying to steal the election with the Russians. It's the worst
[02:41:49.080 --> 02:41:54.680]  ever. Homeland security's got to take it over and get EU help. But meanwhile, there's no election
[02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:59.560]  fraud. Everything's fine. Well, my buddy owns a call center. He's able to do all these political
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:05.880]  polling things. He can call 20,000 people, 200,000 people, and he does a very non-biasing. He goes,
[02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:11.800]  all right, press one, are you voting this election? I mean, to be clear, your friend runs a group
[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:15.960]  call center that is contracted for polls and tell folks what they're finding.
[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:19.400]  Well, what they're finding is overwhelmingly, they're doing these daily,
[02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:27.960]  65% for Trump almost every time, 15 to 20% for Hillary. The rest is third party or undecided.
[02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:33.400]  And this is day in and day out. When you look at ABCCBS, NBC, all these polls they do,
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:40.440]  they contact 500, 250 people, and they poll people who are largely Democrat. This is unbiased. We're
[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:43.880]  not sure. I mean, they poll folks that call in and then say they want to be part of the poll. In
[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:49.320]  fact, let's go ahead and can you guys cue up the short clip from last week of CNN
[02:42:50.200 --> 02:42:54.120]  with the focus group and 10 people are for Trump, five for Hillary, six undecided.
[02:42:54.120 --> 02:43:00.360]  That happens over and over again. So what I'm saying is I see massive, massive, massive landslide
[02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:04.120]  with Trump and reality. I'm not just saying that. That's what I see. I mean,
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:09.720]  Kane has 30 people in Florida at his event. It's up on info wars.com and drugreport.com.
[02:43:09.720 --> 02:43:14.280]  So Roger, I mean, I know you want to be the pessimist, so we're safe here, but really,
[02:43:14.280 --> 02:43:21.080]  what's going on? I think that it's closer than that. I don't foresee a landslide because I do
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:26.680]  understand the Democrats ability to get a number of these key constituency groups to the polls.
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:33.640]  And to vote 10 times a piece. And there is great prospect for both voter fraud and voter manipulation.
[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:40.440]  That's why I'm putting 100% of my time between now and the election to being able to chart exactly
[02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:44.520]  what happened. So let me ask you this question. I mean, let's say we get a bunch of videos of
[02:43:44.520 --> 02:43:48.120]  people being driven around voting over and over again. We get evidence of vote flipping,
[02:43:48.120 --> 02:43:52.680]  massive. I mean, you helped run the recount that took down Gore, obviously, and there was some
[02:43:52.680 --> 02:43:56.520]  evidence there on both sides. But I mean, what do we do when they try to steal? They're obviously
[02:43:56.520 --> 02:44:00.040]  demonizing Trump, knowing he intends to fight for this, just like he did the nomination.
[02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:06.200]  Well, and that decision will be up to him. I am sick of the people attacking him saying that
[02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:11.400]  he's tearing at the fabric of our democratic society. He's undermining our democratic process
[02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:16.440]  because he refuses to endorse an election which hasn't happened yet, in which he can't see whether
[02:44:16.440 --> 02:44:20.440]  there's evidence of fraud. And which they're federalizing because they say that the Russians
[02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:25.160]  are taking over. Well, yeah, exactly. So in the one breath, they tell you this is ridiculous,
[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:28.840]  these machines can't be hacked. And then the next breath, they tell you, but they're concerned
[02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:35.240]  that the Russians are going to hack them. I met yesterday with a fellow who's an expert on the
[02:44:35.240 --> 02:44:41.960]  machine who assures me that they can be manipulated from the central, from the central server,
[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:47.400]  meaning not the entity, the county entity that bought them or leased. No, but the George Soros
[02:44:47.400 --> 02:44:56.200]  controlling 16%. Exactly. Precisely. Precisely. Well, let's elaborate on that because that's
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:45:00.520]  really important, obviously, that Soros controls 16% of the voting in the country. He has connections
[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:06.040]  to others. But separately, yeah, these computers phone home. They're hooked into the internet.
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:10.600]  Obviously, the companies have the back doors. They're controlling it. We already see power outages,
[02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:15.560]  computers turning off all over Texas. Our stories are on drugs, vote flipping. It looks like they're
[02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:21.720]  already engaged in major hanky-panky. Every education I've seen was the blackouts we had on
[02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:25.880]  the internet on the Eastern seaboard last week came from inside the United States.
[02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:32.440]  The idea, this isn't yet another scare tactic. Oh, the Russians are closing down our internet.
[02:45:32.440 --> 02:45:40.440]  I don't think so. And I reiterate again that all of these intelligence professionals, as he recalls,
[02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:45.720]  I'm saying that the Russians are going to hack our elections. They're all political appointees.
[02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:51.400]  None of the Republicans on the House or Senate Intelligence Committee who are fully certified
[02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:56.920]  to see classified and secret information, top secret information, have seen any evidence
[02:45:56.920 --> 02:46:02.280]  of this. So yes, the use of the intelligence community professionals of the Clinton campaign
[02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:08.440]  talking points, I find that deeply disturbing. They blame it on the Russians, but they blame it
[02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:14.600]  on the Russians, but you have Podesta using a password that's P at symbol SSWRD. And it comes
[02:46:14.600 --> 02:46:20.200]  out as a payroll like it's family. Anybody that's a 10-year-old or older can probably figure that
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:25.000]  out if they have it. Well, it goes to the Americans. I agree. Roger, other things that are on the radar,
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:31.400]  where is Hillary weakest? A, B, do they have any sleeper BS folks that are getting ready to come
[02:46:31.400 --> 02:46:37.960]  out with new bull against Trump in the last 13 days? You never know what they may have up their
[02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:43.000]  sleeve. But I will say at this point, thanks to James O'Keefe and the excellent work done by
[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:50.280]  Veritas and the drip, drip, drip of extraordinary information from WikiLeaks, Hillary and her
[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:54.920]  ilk are on defense and they know it. That's why today's New York Times or probably yesterday's
[02:46:54.920 --> 02:47:00.600]  New York Times headline was seeing victory ahead, you know, Hillary begins to play it.
[02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:03.880]  Seeing what victory ahead? Who wrote that headline? Carlos Slim?
[02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:10.920]  By the way, I saw that. That was at CNN. Roger, that was everywhere that she's planning. We played
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:16.440]  the clip. CNN, ABC, you name it. Yesterday, we're all saying she's already won. Go to sleep. It's
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:22.680]  over. She's now planning to take over the White House. Again, trying to create an air of inevitability
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:27.400]  so that when they steal this, nobody will be the wiser. Are they going to move all the stuff they
[02:47:27.400 --> 02:47:32.840]  stole back in when they go in, if they do? By the way, I want to just add something here. We're
[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:38.440]  selling at cost a whistle designed by Roger Stone. It says Clinton rape whistle infowars.com.
[02:47:38.440 --> 02:47:42.760]  We're selling these at costs along with the Hillary for Prison shirt and you need to order this today,
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:47.960]  folks, and then go out to any of their rallies, their surrogates rallies and blow the rape whistle
[02:47:47.960 --> 02:47:51.400]  and the press comes over and asks why you're doing it. You're exposing people that have physically
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:56.200]  raped folks, covered up rapes and are raping the country for the communist, Chinese, the Russians
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:48:02.920]  and others. So it's time to blow the whistle with the infowars, Bill Clinton rape whistle,
[02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:08.760]  and the Bill Clinton rape shirt at infowarsstore.com. Roger? Yes, and we will be publishing Bill's
[02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:13.080]  campaign schedule and we ask patriots, get your whistle at infowars, get your t-shirt,
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:18.520]  and go to his rallies and peacefully protest. It's unfortunate that we have to use these
[02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:24.360]  guerrilla tactics, break through the mainstream media blackout of Bill's record as a sexual
[02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:28.120]  predator. But they've shut down the press. They've sent people to shut down Trump events.
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:31.320]  We're not trying to shut stuff down. Let's be clear. We're just going to get free speech up.
[02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:35.800]  Yeah, and as you have said repeatedly, if you can get on television with this suit,
[02:48:35.800 --> 02:48:41.880]  with this shirt legally, legally, you know, it breaks through the mainstream media blackout,
[02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:46.600]  because that's what we have. If the mainstream media was covering this issue, we wouldn't have to
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:52.360]  resort to these tactics, but they leave us no choice. And until Bill is greeted with 200
[02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:57.720]  whisklers at some future campaign stop, I'm not going to be happy. And folks, if you don't get
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:02.520]  the whistle from us, just go with the whistle. It gets a lot of attention. It's a great idea.
[02:49:02.520 --> 02:49:05.400]  Now, Roger, I've been asking some of the questions here. Clearly,
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:11.640]  they're trying to steal it. If they try to announce it, how do we fight it? You were there in 2000.
[02:49:11.640 --> 02:49:15.800]  I mean, what's the process? Because now we don't have Scalia. He's out of the way. It's 4-4.
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:20.840]  So we've got a split decision. Well, speed will be the most important thing. In other words,
[02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:25.800]  we're going to have to assess the situation immediately out within hours of the election
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:32.600]  being over and make a presentation to Donald Trump as to exactly what we have found. We will
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:40.280]  have sworn affidavits from each of the volunteers, but now it's really what we need right now. More
[02:49:40.280 --> 02:49:47.240]  than anything else is people. People can go to stop-the-steel.org and sign up to work on election
[02:49:47.240 --> 02:49:54.200]  day conducting exit polls with us. We will train you. We will assign you. We will help you through
[02:49:54.200 --> 02:49:59.400]  the process, but we need good men and good women, patriots, who will donate their time. We need
[02:49:59.400 --> 02:50:05.960]  an army of Info War warriors to help us with this project. 13 days.
[02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:12.440]  Soros, a million. We have the blood, sweat, and toil of the American people. 13 days, 10 hours,
[02:50:12.440 --> 02:50:18.040]  Roger. Don't we know it? The computer jockeys are driving me crazy for the final target.
[02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:25.480]  So we are putting a fine point on this, and we will unveil the app shortly for people to get
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:33.400]  assigned and get trained. Very, very exciting. When we come back, what else is front and center for
[02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:41.240]  you? Well, look, I just continue to be amazed at the quality and extraordinary nature of the
[02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:45.960]  information coming out of WikiLeaks, but even more amazing is the media's attempts to ignore it.
[02:50:48.120 --> 02:50:52.200]  It really is unprecedented. I mean, I'm ashamed. I mean, Hillary should be locked up
[02:50:52.200 --> 02:50:56.360]  five years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years, but much less now. It's just all
[02:50:57.080 --> 02:51:01.000]  crime after crime, covering it up, lying. I mean, we have them.
[02:51:01.800 --> 02:51:05.560]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality,
[02:51:05.560 --> 02:51:09.480]  feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns,
[02:51:09.480 --> 02:51:14.120]  blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall? There's something that is changing
[02:51:14.120 --> 02:51:18.920]  thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them. It's called Heart and Body Extract.

[02:52:33.800 --> 02:52:41.720]  Hello everybody. My name is Charlie Sayles. I'm a Vietnam veteran, a Monica player, vocalist,
[02:52:41.720 --> 02:52:48.120]  and blues songwriter. Now I've been married, been homeless, every witch away. But right now,

[02:52:54.920 --> 02:53:02.680]  This message is brought to you by FeetalRecords.com. In a crisis, your number one need is food,
[02:53:02.680 --> 02:53:08.440]  but not just any food. Experts say everyone needs to have non-perishable, good for 25 years,

[02:53:19.480 --> 02:53:24.120]  Survival food is more important today than ever before, explains Frank Pates, a spokesman for
[02:53:24.120 --> 02:53:28.120]  the company. Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other threats can make obtaining
[02:53:28.120 --> 02:53:34.680]  sufficient food impossible in an emergency. This 72-hour survival kit has 16 servings of delicious
[02:53:34.680 --> 02:53:40.680]  food rated for 25 years of storage. It sells to the general public for $27 plus shipping,
[02:53:40.680 --> 02:53:45.720]  and it's been rated four and a half out of five stars by customers who paid full price.
[02:53:45.720 --> 02:53:50.440]  But listeners who act quickly can get it free, just cover $9.95 shipping.

[02:54:25.640 --> 02:54:30.440]  I mean like central casting of like body snatchers or something, they're all sweating and look like
[02:54:30.440 --> 02:54:35.800]  demons and wearing little festooned amulets around their neck while they sit there worshiping Hillary
[02:54:35.800 --> 02:54:43.480]  Clinton. I grabbed Joe Marx who said it, I just know this, whether Trump wins or loses,
[02:54:43.480 --> 02:54:48.680]  clearly he's way ahead. Clearly she doesn't have any crowds, he doesn't either. I mean he gets 30
[02:54:48.680 --> 02:54:56.920]  people, her VP candidate. The photos are up on inforwars.com right now. We win by taking action.
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:55:00.440]  I'm not just saying that to make everybody feel good in case they steal it. We have exposed
[02:55:00.440 --> 02:55:05.160]  globalism. World government's in trouble. Major issues of Americanism, not globalism,
[02:55:05.160 --> 02:55:09.320]  and all these one-sided trade deals are now front and center. And the movement that we've
[02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:13.960]  started and you've started and Ron Paul pushed and that we see with the exploding with Trump
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:20.360]  is just beginning. This is just absolutely a meteoric rise of nationalistic
[02:55:20.920 --> 02:55:23.720]  constitutional free market awakening. Roger Stone.
[02:55:24.840 --> 02:55:29.960]  I look Alex, I totally agree. This, I'm really getting fed up with this idea that if you are
[02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:36.840]  not for war with the Russians, you are a trader to the United States, you are a Russian agent.
[02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:44.280]  I was on the circus, the showtime show on Sunday, heavily edited by the way. And yet again,
[02:55:45.640 --> 02:55:52.600]  confronted with this whole idea that I either knew in advance who was going to hack, I didn't,
[02:55:53.240 --> 02:56:00.840]  or that I'm in the service of Vladimir Putin and the Russians, meaning I'm a trader to the country
[02:56:00.840 --> 02:56:09.320]  I love. And then on Sunday, I did a CBS interview out of Miami. They played a clip of Congressman
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:19.800]  Elijah Cummings of Maryland saying flatly that I knew in advance of the hacking of John Podesta.
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:24.200]  Consequently, my attorneys are in the process of contacting him. We're going to give him an
[02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:30.200]  opportunity to retract. But if he does not, he has made this statement flatly off the floor of
[02:56:30.200 --> 02:56:35.560]  the US House. So he does not enjoy congressional immunity. And he leaves me no choice but to sue
[02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:41.560]  him because it's a falsehood. It's a lie. And it needs to be put to bed right now.
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:45.240]  Well, Roger, I've had him call me a Russian agent. It really pisses me off. I mean,
[02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:49.960]  these globalists are the ones selling us out all these foreign interests. And it's just crazy.
[02:56:50.520 --> 02:56:55.800]  WikiLeaks specifically, and you jump in too big. I mean, just the bombshells, the latest ones that
[02:56:55.800 --> 02:56:59.320]  came out in today's dump, where they're saying, we got to cover up for Hillary that she was
[02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:02.440]  secretly talking to Obama. He's been caught in a lie. This is so big.
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:12.600]  Where do you think this goes, Roger? Now, well, it kind of depends on whether the mainstream media
[02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:18.440]  is going to finally bow to the newsworthy nature of these disclosures. I mean, NBC
[02:57:18.440 --> 02:57:23.400]  particularly, they act as if it's none of it's happening. It just isn't even happening.
[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:28.120]  It appears that Hannity is about the only one that actually even covers any of this whatsoever.
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:33.720]  But let's remember that only weeks ago, people were attacking both Alex and I
[02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:38.840]  because it became clear that WikiLeaks wasn't going to release anything that was newsworthy.
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:43.960]  And the left was celebrating and high-fiving each other. Now we know that that was wrong.
[02:57:44.520 --> 02:57:51.560]  So again, I think that we have to see, I'm going to focus on the narrow piece of ground that I
[02:57:51.560 --> 02:57:56.840]  care about, which is ensuring that we can determine whether or not this was a fair election,
[02:57:56.840 --> 02:58:01.880]  and if it is not. Sure. And you do it with exit polls because they really want to steal the machines.
[02:58:02.600 --> 02:58:07.400]  That's exactly where I think it will be. The Trump campaign is focused on the question of
[02:58:07.400 --> 02:58:13.480]  voter fraud, the other part of this, and certainly a legitimate part of it at that.
[02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:18.440]  So I think we have the ground covered. Again, I implore good men and good women who have the
[02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:25.000]  time and have the motivation. Patriots, please go to stopthesteal.org and sign up to help us
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:30.680]  on election day. Absolutely. All right. Everybody making your reports ends up national news.

[02:58:33.400 --> 02:58:37.400]  And other sites. Thank you so much, Roger Stone. Talk to you soon. Great to be here. Thanks.
[02:58:37.400 --> 02:58:42.040]  Fourth hour with Paul Watson, straight ahead, infowars.com.com. If your station doesn't carry it,
[02:58:42.040 --> 02:58:45.880]  we're going to continue on with Paul Watson. We've got more to say here with Joe Beggs. I'm Alex
[02:58:45.880 --> 02:58:54.680]  Johnson. Communications radio network. You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in,
[02:58:54.680 --> 02:58:59.640]  one of the biggest issues nobody's talking about on the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability
[02:58:59.640 --> 02:59:07.320]  of the power grid, the potential for power grid chaos, EMP, cyber warfare, onto mentioned dangerous
[02:59:07.320 --> 02:59:13.400]  weather, hurricanes, ice storms, all a very real threat to our grid. My friend's chaos is already
[02:59:13.400 --> 02:59:18.040]  here and it's going to get a lot worse. That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have
[02:59:18.040 --> 02:59:23.240]  a way to produce their own supply of backup electricity. Now I've got the perfect power

[02:59:42.440 --> 02:59:49.800]  perfect power solar generator. This is the one I use in my home. Go to powergridchaos.com and get
[02:59:49.800 --> 03:00:19.720]  70% off. We're on the march. The empire is on the run. We are on the march. The empire is
[03:00:19.720 --> 03:00:28.760]  on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. 13 days. Paul Watson takes over the next segment
[03:00:28.760 --> 03:00:34.360]  from her Britannic Manus, she's London, England. Joe Biggs is here riding shotgun with me.
[03:00:36.120 --> 03:00:39.080]  I haven't gotten to Michael Moore saying, you know, if you elect Trump, he'll be the biggest
[03:00:39.080 --> 03:00:42.920]  FU of the establishment ever. Well, then why don't you go against the establishment? This is so
[03:00:42.920 --> 03:00:46.920]  obvious, Michael Moore, but you can't. You have six bodyguards, but I shouldn't be able to own a gun.
[03:00:46.920 --> 03:00:50.680]  I was asking you during the break, do you think it's a landslide for Trump? You said some really
[03:00:50.680 --> 03:00:54.760]  choice points that I agree with. I repeat those, Joe Biggs. Well, I think he's going to win by
[03:00:54.760 --> 03:00:59.640]  landslide. But the thing is, like you said, it's those machines that you have to worry about.
[03:00:59.640 --> 03:01:03.800]  You know, people do have the ability, I believe, in a lot of areas to request a paper ballot as well.
[03:01:03.800 --> 03:01:08.120]  If you're able to do that, try that out as well. But if you look at the Trump rally yesterday in
[03:01:08.120 --> 03:01:14.440]  Tampa, Florida versus the Kane or the Clinton rallies, he has 20,000, 20,000 turned away.
[03:01:14.440 --> 03:01:23.160]  He has 30. But not just 20,000 people, Alex. 20,000 energized, patriotic, just hopped up on
[03:01:23.160 --> 03:01:28.520]  true freedom. Of every race, color, and creed. Yes, everybody, gay, straight, Catholic, Muslim,
[03:01:28.520 --> 03:01:32.760]  it doesn't matter. There are people from all over the world that travel to go see this man
[03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:38.440]  because he's an amazing individual. But you have to like, you have to pry and pull energy
[03:01:38.440 --> 03:01:40.760]  from people who go to these Kane and Clinton rallies. I mean-
[03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:45.720]  Hillary's like this zombie. I mean, let's put the article up from the Gateway Pundit
[03:01:45.720 --> 03:01:49.160]  that shows the videos and the photos for TV viewers. And then radio listeners should go
[03:01:49.160 --> 03:01:53.400]  to infowords.com and see what Drudge Report has at drudgeport.com. I mean, it's right there.
[03:01:53.400 --> 03:01:57.480]  Wow, Kane holds rally. Only 30 people show up. And it's over and over again. It's like this.
[03:01:57.480 --> 03:02:01.800]  Just scroll down. This isn't out of context. This is while he's speaking is 30 people.
[03:02:01.800 --> 03:02:04.920]  I mean, yeah, I'm sure there's going to be people who don't go to these things. But here's the thing,
[03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:09.480]  though. You can see in mass numbers how many people who love Trump, they're coming out.
[03:02:09.480 --> 03:02:14.760]  They're coming to the Google bot show from 10 to one interest. The major corporations admit
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:20.840]  landslides for Trump. All the internet bots know you've got from 13 to 90, you know, age groups.
[03:02:20.840 --> 03:02:26.040]  People are so excited. I saw a guy who was so old. He was out there on one of those walkers
[03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:30.920]  and he got there late and they had reached, you know, the capacity for that stadium.
[03:02:30.920 --> 03:02:34.680]  And he goes, man, I just wanted to hear him. So I helped him walk up to the front of the door
[03:02:34.680 --> 03:02:38.600]  and he could still see it in here. And he was so excited because the job is this is going to
[03:02:38.600 --> 03:02:41.480]  change everything. Well, that's very touching. I hope you get video of that kind of stuff because
[03:02:41.480 --> 03:02:45.400]  it's amazing how that stuff is going on. What happens if they openly steal it? I mean, they're
[03:02:45.400 --> 03:02:49.480]  really arrogant. They're full of bravado. What happens? You know, I think you're going to see
[03:02:49.480 --> 03:02:53.400]  a lot of this. It's going to have to be forced. It's going to be covered because you're going to
[03:02:53.400 --> 03:02:57.880]  see people extremely mad. You're going to see social media going off the charts about this.
[03:02:58.840 --> 03:03:02.520]  This has been stolen. I'm concerned they could pull a false flag like steal it from Trump and then
[03:03:02.520 --> 03:03:06.360]  to demonize us, you know, blow up a government building or something and blame it on us. I'm
[03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:11.320]  telling you. Yeah, it's possible. You know, I don't think there's any way there's any fair way
[03:03:11.320 --> 03:03:15.400]  that she has a chance of winning. When you go look at her, Vince, there's no one outside that's
[03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:20.040]  excited to be there. You know, they look like the walking dead. It's the most depressing. I don't
[03:03:20.040 --> 03:03:25.720]  mean to be mean, but I mean, Hillary supporters look like they've been run over by cars. I mean,
[03:03:25.720 --> 03:03:30.920]  they look mentally retarded. I mean, I'm not being mean here. I mean, I'll say it. I think they are.
[03:03:30.920 --> 03:03:35.000]  I mean, we're not just saying that though. You go to a Trump rally. I don't care if they're black,
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:41.000]  Hispanic, white, good looking, focused, well spoken, hardworking people. You go to a Hillary thing
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.960]  and they look like they're walking dead, man. I mean, there's something wrong with them.
[03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:48.120]  Well, you go to Trump rallies. These are all small business owners, people who are not lazy.
[03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:52.600]  People are going out there and making a business for themselves, creating something
[03:03:52.600 --> 03:03:57.400]  and giving people jobs and helping people out and helping out the economy and making something
[03:03:57.400 --> 03:04:01.560]  for themselves. And that's what the American dream is all about. Yeah, but ignore the crowd of 20,000
[03:04:01.560 --> 03:04:06.920]  to turn away 20,000 in Tampa. Hillary gets 200, Kang gets 30. They're the winner, dude.
[03:04:07.800 --> 03:04:13.560]  If Trump, Michael Moore said, if emails came out exposing half the stuff that Hillary's done,
[03:04:13.560 --> 03:04:17.560]  I mean, it'd be done, you know, and, you know, you've got a song going. Well, I mean,
[03:04:17.560 --> 03:04:20.600]  we've seen some emails, but it's just the same stuff that he says already,
[03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:26.040]  because he's honest. He's not too faced. He's not a chameleon. He doesn't go on TV and act a certain
[03:04:26.040 --> 03:04:30.120]  way and then go back and then talk crack about the American. That's right. Everybody's hacked
[03:04:30.120 --> 03:04:33.560]  Trump's stuff. There's nothing there. It's just like, dude, he's saying the same thing. Like,
[03:04:33.560 --> 03:04:36.920]  everything you're reading here and this about Trump is the exact same thing he's already said
[03:04:36.920 --> 03:04:40.520]  to speech. So there's nothing we can do. But when you read this stuff, you've got Hillary Clinton
[03:04:40.520 --> 03:04:44.040]  going out there going, Oh, I love the American people. But then you read the email. She hates them.
[03:04:44.040 --> 03:04:48.280]  She hates everyday Americans. You're a super predator. You're deplorable. You're this, you're that.
[03:04:48.840 --> 03:04:52.840]  She's a monster. And that's why they hate it. He doesn't follow polls. He doesn't follow the
[03:04:52.840 --> 03:04:56.600]  directives. Michael Morrison, the best thing is it, this is going to be the biggest eff you
[03:04:56.600 --> 03:05:00.040]  do the establishment. The elites are scared. I'm going to play that and end the baton to Paul
[03:05:00.040 --> 03:05:05.000]  Watson when we come back. Joe Biggs here with info wars.com. Michael Moore, Trump's election will
[03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:10.840]  be the biggest eff you in history. An article up by Paul Joseph Watson during a speech for his new
[03:05:10.840 --> 03:05:15.400]  one man stage performance, Trumpland. Michael Moore remarked that the election of Donald Trump
[03:05:15.400 --> 03:05:19.960]  will be the biggest eff you in history. Moore began by saying he knew a lot of people in Michigan
[03:05:19.960 --> 03:05:24.200]  who are going to vote for Trump who are not racist to rednecks, but were sick of their jobs
[03:05:24.200 --> 03:05:30.120]  being offshore to places like Mexico. Trump's promise to slap a 35% tariff on Ford cars made
[03:05:30.120 --> 03:05:35.240]  in Mexico and sent back to America was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and
[03:05:35.240 --> 03:05:40.680]  Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Whether Trump means it or not is kind of irrelevant because he's saying
[03:05:40.680 --> 03:05:45.400]  the things that people who are hurting and it's why every beaten down worthless forgotten working
[03:05:45.400 --> 03:05:50.280]  stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle class loves Trump, arguing that Trump was
[03:05:50.280 --> 03:05:54.840]  the human Molotov cocktail that they've been waiting for the human hand grenade that they can
[03:05:54.840 --> 03:05:59.160]  legally throw into the system that stole the lives from them. You can find more reports like
[03:05:59.160 --> 03:06:06.760]  this at info wars.com. There was a mighty nation rest above all of create Charlie Daniels. He's
[03:06:06.760 --> 03:06:11.720]  always loved America. He's always offended the second amendment. Let me just read a little
[03:06:11.720 --> 03:06:16.360]  thing here from agenda 21 that American system is justice must be changed to conform to the rest
[03:06:16.360 --> 03:06:21.480]  of the world. Individual rights will have to take a backseat to the collective. Well, you know what
[03:06:21.480 --> 03:06:25.960]  the next move is going to be, don't you? It's going to come after your guns. Oh yeah. I take it ain't
[03:06:25.960 --> 03:06:31.800]  gonna sit well down my way at all. It ain't gonna sit well. Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:06:31.800 --> 03:06:37.080]  It's time to ride, boys. We need a thousand paul reviewers. When I was a boy, it was okay to be

[03:07:03.560 --> 03:07:09.960]  bottle of it. Rob do joins us. You worked, I guess like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brainforce
[03:07:09.960 --> 03:07:15.560]  is. I'd been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8 30.
[03:07:15.560 --> 03:07:19.320]  I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it and I really
[03:07:19.320 --> 03:07:23.160]  wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brainforce right there. I popped two
[03:07:23.160 --> 03:07:28.440]  of them and about 20 minutes later, it's like everything just kind of clears up. It's got four
[03:07:28.440 --> 03:07:33.000]  and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third party

[03:07:41.960 --> 03:07:46.280]  while, but I probably could not have done it without brainforce. I went home about 645 this
[03:07:46.280 --> 03:07:51.560]  morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brainforce and came in. You will find

[03:08:29.800 --> 03:08:34.840]  All right. Paul Joseph Watson is going to get in the seat there. I can see he's not in his seat
[03:08:34.840 --> 03:08:41.000]  yet. Paul Joseph Watson always on target from his Britannic majesties, England. But when he
[03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:45.400]  comes back, we will hand the baton to him because I wanted to talk to Paul Watson. There he is,
[03:08:45.400 --> 03:08:50.760]  the elusive superstar. Paul Joseph Watson. Paul, I want you to take over the show because you're
[03:08:50.760 --> 03:08:55.160]  hard to even get to host one hour a week. You're so busy writing articles and finding the globalist
[03:08:55.160 --> 03:08:59.160]  and dominating Twitter. Everybody says you're like the Twitter guy. Trump loves you. Always
[03:08:59.160 --> 03:09:05.320]  retweeting your stuff. What does your gut tell you? I mean, you don't mean 16 years. I don't say
[03:09:05.320 --> 03:09:09.160]  what I want to believe. I really say what I think. And Trump, I think he's going to win
[03:09:09.160 --> 03:09:15.320]  the landslide. He's got crowds of 20, 30, 40,000. He has 200, K and S 30. There's election fraud news
[03:09:15.320 --> 03:09:21.080]  coming up. We've got all the emails proving she's a total criminal. I mean, even if she states in
[03:09:21.080 --> 03:09:25.160]  and steals it, she's never going to get away with this now. I mean, this makes the previous
[03:09:25.160 --> 03:09:32.280]  email stuff with a comparison. What does your gut tell you, Paul? I really don't Alex. I know that
[03:09:32.280 --> 03:09:37.480]  there's a hell of a lot of very stupid people, not just in America, but around the world. Many of
[03:09:37.480 --> 03:09:42.840]  them will have fallen for the propaganda that Trump is unstable. He's literally Hitler. He's
[03:09:42.840 --> 03:09:47.320]  got his hand on the nuclear button. He's going to destroy the world. You know, and you can understand
[03:09:47.320 --> 03:09:52.680]  if people are weak minded enough to be affected by that propaganda, it would stop them from voting
[03:09:52.680 --> 03:09:58.360]  for Trump. What I don't understand is, you know, he had Robbie MOOC, the Clinton campaign manager on
[03:09:58.360 --> 03:10:04.360]  all the Sunday shows saying, Oh, we're just amazed by the early voter turnout. There's so much enthusiasm.
[03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:10.360]  What kind of person wakes up in the morning on any morning, you know, if not November 8th and
[03:10:10.360 --> 03:10:15.000]  thinks, I know what I'm going to do today, I'm going to go and vote for Hillary Clinton. Who would
[03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:21.640]  have the enthusiasm to vote for Hillary Clinton? Where is all this enthusiasm coming from? You
[03:10:21.640 --> 03:10:28.680]  can see the videos of her supposed supporters at her own sparsely attended rallies. They have to be
[03:10:29.720 --> 03:10:35.240]  made to applaud and cheer exactly what the instigators want them to cheer. They have no
[03:10:35.240 --> 03:10:42.360]  spontaneous enthusiasm whatsoever. She is a cultural corpse, like this weekend with Bernie,
[03:10:43.400 --> 03:10:49.560]  just carting her around. Yeah, I mean, who would wake up an enthusiastically want to vote for Hillary
[03:10:49.560 --> 03:10:53.480]  Clinton? Well, yesterday was early voting. I went out and voted yesterday for Trump and I had that
[03:10:53.480 --> 03:10:58.440]  Trump as my president shirt on. I went and voted and I wore my blue sweater and then I took it off.
[03:10:58.440 --> 03:11:02.680]  I put my I voted sticker on it did like a victory lap on my motorcycle around Austin really quick
[03:11:02.680 --> 03:11:06.120]  for about 20 minutes and everyone's just kind of looking at me. But it was just like, you know,
[03:11:06.120 --> 03:11:10.760]  I was excited to do it. I was happy. I got up and I was like pumped to go out on early voting
[03:11:10.760 --> 03:11:15.320]  and cast mine. I was pretty happy. All right, Paul, I don't want to take your time on hand the baton
[03:11:15.320 --> 03:11:20.040]  to you. But since we mentioned it earlier, I want to play this club. This is Michael Moore. And this
[03:11:20.040 --> 03:11:24.840]  is Michael Moore saying Trump election will be the biggest F you in history. He had met my folks
[03:11:24.840 --> 03:11:30.040]  screwdriver by NAFTA and get but that's what Hillary and Clinton and all them ram through.
[03:11:30.040 --> 03:11:35.240]  And the whole Republican establishment, how could any of these idiots not support Trump? I mean,
[03:11:35.240 --> 03:11:41.960]  more is such an anachronism. Here he is. A millionaire has the same number of votes
[03:11:41.960 --> 03:11:50.200]  as the person without a job one. And there's more of the former middle class than there are
[03:11:50.200 --> 03:11:58.520]  in the millionaire class. So on November eight, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth,
[03:11:58.520 --> 03:12:04.760]  be handed a ballot, close the curtain and take that lever or felt pen or touchscreen and put
[03:12:04.760 --> 03:12:13.640]  a big in the box by the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system
[03:12:13.640 --> 03:12:22.440]  that has ruined their lives. Donald J. Trump. They see that the elites who ruined their lives
[03:12:22.440 --> 03:12:29.400]  hate Trump. Corporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate
[03:12:29.400 --> 03:12:37.880]  Trump. The media hates Trump after they loved him and created him and now hate him. Thank you,
[03:12:37.880 --> 03:12:45.560]  media. The enemy of my enemy is who I'm voting for on November eight. Yes, on November eight, you,
[03:12:46.200 --> 03:12:55.720]  Joe blow, Steve blow, Bob blow, Billy blow, Billy Bob blow, all the blows get to go and blow up the
[03:12:55.720 --> 03:13:04.440]  whole system because it's your right. Trump's election is going to be the biggest you ever
[03:13:04.440 --> 03:13:11.480]  recorded in human history. So it will feel good. So he runs around demonizing Trump all day, but
[03:13:11.480 --> 03:13:14.600]  then I've seen him several times act like he's actually for Trump because he claims this is
[03:13:14.600 --> 03:13:20.760]  grassroots guy. How could he if he's against corporate stuff, the big banks, all the corruption,
[03:13:20.760 --> 03:13:25.240]  they all hate Trump. This must be a serious identity crisis for all these fake liberals,
[03:13:25.240 --> 03:13:30.520]  because Trump is everything they claim they ever want. And then the White House is meeting with
[03:13:30.520 --> 03:13:34.120]  these rappers that talk about raping women and then, you know, they're playing stuff for their
[03:13:34.120 --> 03:13:38.120]  kids. We want all Trump's got some edited stuff from 11 years ago. It's the end of the world.
[03:13:38.120 --> 03:13:42.200]  I mean, that almost sounds like he's for Trump there. What do you think's happening here? I mean,
[03:13:42.200 --> 03:13:46.200]  is the truth coming out Freudian slips? Paul Watson, I'm hanging the baton to you. We're done. Go ahead,
[03:13:46.200 --> 03:13:51.560]  my friend. Okay, thanks, Alex. I mean, maybe Michael Moore is a secret Trump voter. What's
[03:13:51.560 --> 03:13:56.680]  interesting about that clip is it started circulating last night. I got to the top of Reddit,
[03:13:56.680 --> 03:14:02.440]  I believe. And a lot of people were saying that's fake. That's not even Michael Moore saying those
[03:14:02.440 --> 03:14:07.800]  words. And in fact, it took until today, where we got the actual video of Michael Moore sat there
[03:14:07.800 --> 03:14:13.000]  during this Trump planned event, saying those exact words. Yes, it is Michael Moore saying those
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:17.960]  words. But again, it illustrates the fact that, you know, that was so supposedly out of character
[03:14:17.960 --> 03:14:23.960]  for Michael Moore that people thought that audio was actually fake when it's not. But one of my
[03:14:23.960 --> 03:14:29.240]  friends who is a liberal, he's quite prominent, he's a classical liberal in the sense he's not
[03:14:29.240 --> 03:14:35.000]  leftist, he's not an SJW. But he sent me this comment, and it ties in perfectly to the Michael
[03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:41.560]  Moore comments, which is this, I'm just astonished horrified by the way that statements made by
[03:14:41.560 --> 03:14:48.040]  Trump regarding globalization and the rigged system are entirely congruent with a quote liberal
[03:14:48.040 --> 03:14:54.520]  critique of crony capitalism slash lobbying, etc. I mean, they could come out of the mouths of
[03:14:54.520 --> 03:15:00.840]  Clint of Noam Chomsky or Bernie Sanders with hardly a word changed. And yet simply because
[03:15:00.840 --> 03:15:07.400]  they're coming out of Trump's orange mouth, these statements are either randomly ignored or misrepresented.
[03:15:07.400 --> 03:15:12.360]  So again, it goes back to what Michael Moore was saying in that clip. Trump is hated by Wall
[03:15:12.360 --> 03:15:17.160]  Street, he's hated by corporate America, he's hated by the political establishment, and he
[03:15:17.160 --> 03:15:22.760]  represents members of the middle class in America who have been completely screwed over, who have
[03:15:22.760 --> 03:15:28.280]  lost their livelihoods, thanks to big business and thanks to big government, the very interest
[03:15:28.280 --> 03:15:34.040]  that Michael Moore built his career on supposedly opposing. So when you see him come out with
[03:15:34.040 --> 03:15:38.840]  statements like that, obviously that wasn't in the full context, but you know, word for word,
[03:15:38.840 --> 03:15:44.040]  that's what he said. It's not a fake audio tape. It's very interesting. And by the way, we are
[03:15:44.040 --> 03:15:47.560]  showing the video since you mentioned it, that video did later come out, some of the audience
[03:15:47.560 --> 03:15:51.720]  first recorded it and got it out. And the fact that they denied it when clearly he was at the
[03:15:51.720 --> 03:15:56.920]  event, clearly he said it was even in newspapers. They're so in denial, because when he finally
[03:15:56.920 --> 03:16:01.960]  tells the truth, it doesn't fit into the larger narrative. Well, I changed the info wars article.
[03:16:01.960 --> 03:16:06.680]  So now you can actually see the video of him saying it in the article. But again,
[03:16:06.680 --> 03:16:11.640]  he knows that Trump supporters, as he said, they're not just racist rednecks, they're voting for
[03:16:11.640 --> 03:16:16.920]  Trump because he got up in front of the Ford executives and said, if you try and sell those
[03:16:16.920 --> 03:16:23.160]  cars back to America from Mexico, I'm going to slap a 35% tariff on you. He's not going to sell
[03:16:23.160 --> 03:16:29.080]  for that crony capitalism that again, Michael Moore built his career on opposing. So again,
[03:16:29.080 --> 03:16:34.840]  he gets it. A lot of these Hillary supporters in the media, these elitists don't get it. They still
[03:16:34.840 --> 03:16:41.160]  think that Trump's entire support base is formulated. And by the way, you're so on fire here.
[03:16:42.360 --> 03:16:47.000]  This is what Henry Ford pioneered. You've got to make enough money to be able to buy the product.
[03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:51.880]  Globalism is this thing where they make us impoverished by not ever having an economy
[03:16:51.880 --> 03:16:55.240]  to be able to buy the product in the end. And now we're getting towards the end game,
[03:16:55.240 --> 03:17:02.520]  when everybody's going broke, this is not good. No, that's whose interest Trump represents. It's
[03:17:02.520 --> 03:17:07.480]  not just people lashing out because they're racist, but the elites obsession with that,
[03:17:07.480 --> 03:17:13.160]  their misrepresentation, their misconception of that, that that is what drives Trump voters
[03:17:13.160 --> 03:17:18.120]  is what could possibly cost them this election. We saw it with Brexit. Again, they were over
[03:17:18.120 --> 03:17:22.760]  confident right before the vote. They thought, oh, only provincial racists are going to support
[03:17:22.760 --> 03:17:29.960]  Brexit. Well, now it was 17 million people, the biggest vote in a UK election ever. And they lost
[03:17:29.960 --> 03:17:34.600]  and they weren't expecting it because all the polls before said that it was a comfortable
[03:17:34.600 --> 03:17:39.880]  victory for the remainers. They got slapped in the face. They got shocked because they couldn't
[03:17:39.880 --> 03:17:46.280]  identify who was voting for Brexit and why because of their ivory tower elitism. That's what Michael
[03:17:46.280 --> 03:17:51.240]  Moore's talking about in that clip. Plus Paul, they demonize everybody that stands up for common
[03:17:51.240 --> 03:17:56.280]  sense fairness. Nationalism is racist. The average person doesn't want to be called that. So they're
[03:17:56.280 --> 03:18:01.080]  very quiet about their views. And that's what internal pollsters for Trump know is there's a
[03:18:01.080 --> 03:18:07.080]  good 10% of people that are closeted. I mean, I get, I wear Trump stuff out. This is an exercise in
[03:18:07.080 --> 03:18:11.400]  front of my kids and people mess with us. They say stuff here in Austin. They're very nasty.
[03:18:13.400 --> 03:18:19.000]  No, there is that contingent. But again, this has been way underplayed. There's something going on
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:23.880]  behind the scenes, which is not quantifiable by these polls. And yes, it's partly Hillary's
[03:18:23.880 --> 03:18:28.520]  campaign admittedly now in the WikiLeaks document saying, we're going to use this as a tactic to
[03:18:28.520 --> 03:18:34.520]  try and convince Trump supporters to lose enthusiasm, saying that it's all tied up. It's in the bag.
[03:18:34.520 --> 03:18:39.560]  Hillary's won. And then you drill into the polls. And it's the same with the debate polls we've seen.
[03:18:39.560 --> 03:18:47.000]  They oversample Democrats every single time in some cases by like 26% Republicans to 40 odd
[03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:50.280]  percent. And there are easier ways but more sophisticated to steal it. I'm going to skip
[03:18:50.280 --> 03:18:53.080]  this break to have more time, Paul, but this is just riveting here, listening to you talk.
[03:18:54.040 --> 03:18:57.160]  Why are they so arrogant? They've always been arrogant, but it seems like they're completely
[03:18:57.160 --> 03:19:03.160]  mentally ill now, have no idea all the credibility they've lost. We have a press conference and 30
[03:19:03.160 --> 03:19:08.520]  million people watch. CNN doesn't have that in a week, brother. I mean, I don't, you were
[03:19:08.520 --> 03:19:13.800]  currently have videos with 15, 20 million views. We do too. I mean, have they figured out yet
[03:19:13.800 --> 03:19:18.040]  how pathetic they are? I think they're figuring it out. They had a Washington Post article and an
[03:19:18.040 --> 03:19:22.040]  Austin, American Statesman article last week admitting info wars is bigger than quote any
[03:19:22.040 --> 03:19:26.440]  mainstream show. So they're now admitting that fact. We're just one part of this drudge bigger
[03:19:26.440 --> 03:19:30.680]  than all of them combined. Facebook and New York times combined, but they're still so arrogant.
[03:19:30.680 --> 03:19:33.800]  So there's almost like the schizophrenia now. They're still super arrogant,
[03:19:33.800 --> 03:19:37.160]  but they realize we're way bigger than them. So what comes out of that paradox?
[03:19:38.840 --> 03:19:42.600]  I think some of them are starting to get it, but most on, I mean, I talked about that
[03:19:42.600 --> 03:19:47.640]  daily show clip with Trevor Noah freaking out about this conservative Trump supporter getting
[03:19:47.640 --> 03:19:53.160]  tens of millions of views on Facebook. But Brian Stelter of CNN came out last night.
[03:19:53.160 --> 03:19:55.960]  You know, he's this big anti-Trump leftist on CNN,
[03:19:56.920 --> 03:20:02.600]  basically saying Trump only gets 60,000 views on his Facebook videos. Now for a start,
[03:20:02.600 --> 03:20:08.200]  I went on Trump's Facebook about 30 minutes ago, literally every video and they upload
[03:20:08.200 --> 03:20:15.560]  numerous videos a day, 800,000, 900,000, 1.5 million, 2 million views, every single video.
[03:20:15.560 --> 03:20:20.760]  So again, he got that completely wrong. And then he bragged about having 1.35 million
[03:20:20.760 --> 03:20:26.680]  viewers a week on his own show. James O'Keeffe shot back and said, quote,
[03:20:26.680 --> 03:20:33.160]  our YouTube videos have 10 million views in the last seven days, 54 million Twitter impressions
[03:20:33.160 --> 03:20:38.440]  for James O'Keeffe over the last seven days. I mean, just on my little Twitter account,
[03:20:38.440 --> 03:20:44.200]  I'm getting 165 million Twitter impressions every single month.
[03:20:44.200 --> 03:20:48.440]  Paul, if you count all of our channels and affiliated channels, we have 5 million views,
[03:20:48.440 --> 03:20:51.400]  1 billion on one channel. We're trying to take down right now, by the way, folks. We're under
[03:20:51.400 --> 03:20:56.600]  attack. And if you add it all together, we're getting 4 to 5 million views a day just on our
[03:20:56.600 --> 03:21:02.840]  channels, Paul. No, it's insane. And we've only just started properly uploading videos to Twitter,
[03:21:02.840 --> 03:21:07.320]  which is an entirely new avenue. So you can add on, you know, 200, 300,000 views.
[03:21:07.320 --> 03:21:11.800]  We're absolutely kissing their ass. And it's not about measuring our Johnson's here.
[03:21:11.800 --> 03:21:14.440]  The point is they're in decline. We're rising. What do they do?
[03:21:16.840 --> 03:21:22.600]  I think that they haven't realized it yet, Alex. I mean, I get, you know, 300,000 followers on
[03:21:22.600 --> 03:21:27.640]  Twitter. That's the current level of it. And, you know, 165 million impressions. I get more
[03:21:27.640 --> 03:21:33.480]  impressions than celebrities with 10 million Twitter followers. Oh, that's the thing. They put
[03:21:33.480 --> 03:21:38.360]  together these huge Hollywood produced deals with like 30 stars on YouTube with full YouTube push.
[03:21:38.360 --> 03:21:44.040]  It gets 100,090% downvotes. We do nothing to put out a video. It gets a million. I mean,
[03:21:44.040 --> 03:21:46.680]  I'll cut four or five videos in a week and they'll get like 2 or 3 million views
[03:21:46.680 --> 03:21:51.080]  conservatively. And I'm just shooting it at my house. And then they have all these stars
[03:21:51.080 --> 03:21:57.080]  and everyone is saying we hate you. And this, again, we're not bragging. I'll give you another
[03:21:57.080 --> 03:22:01.640]  example. You know, one of these Never Trumpers, Louise Mensch writes an article saying that
[03:22:01.640 --> 03:22:08.760]  I'm in control, Infowars is controlling the Putin troll bots. It gets five comments in 24 hours.
[03:22:08.760 --> 03:22:14.520]  This is on quite a big website. Five comments in 24 hours. The article this morning about the
[03:22:14.520 --> 03:22:20.920]  vote fraud in Texas is probably past 4,000 comments by now. It got over five comments in
[03:22:20.920 --> 03:22:26.440]  probably 10 seconds because our information resonates. And let's be clear. Let's be clear.
[03:22:26.440 --> 03:22:32.040]  It's true that Russian TV takes what we say word for word and Japanese TV and all the others
[03:22:32.040 --> 03:22:37.160]  and mainline talk radio in Congress because we know what we're talking about. We broke Benghazi
[03:22:37.160 --> 03:22:41.880]  first. We broke it all first. It's not that the Russians take their orders. They know truth when
[03:22:41.880 --> 03:22:46.360]  they hear it. We're kicking your ass up one side and down the other. You little arrogant
[03:22:47.240 --> 03:22:54.280]  pencil neck establishment, fake liberal fascist dirtbags. Exactly. I mean, another part of it
[03:22:54.280 --> 03:22:59.160]  is they're very lazy. I mean, we instantaneously react to news. We're able to get on top. We're
[03:22:59.160 --> 03:23:02.760]  completely crazy. We're 18 hours a day. I literally foam at the mouth. Let's just be honest.
[03:23:03.560 --> 03:23:08.120]  Yeah. But I mean, talking about Russia, you've then got comments by the former prime minister
[03:23:08.120 --> 03:23:14.040]  of Sweden, Carl Bill, who put out this tweet, which he claimed that Russia today, you got the
[03:23:14.040 --> 03:23:19.320]  WikiLeaks before WikiLeaks published them simply because they tweeted, for example,
[03:23:19.320 --> 03:23:26.200]  about Podesta email part 17 before WikiLeaks released it on Twitter or tweeted about it on
[03:23:26.200 --> 03:23:31.240]  Twitter. He said, quote, really impressive by Russian state media to report on WikiLeaks releases
[03:23:31.240 --> 03:23:37.400]  before they are released. Contact count. Now, of course, the Podesta emails are released on WikiLeaks
[03:23:37.400 --> 03:23:44.360]  as website way before they actually tweet it out. That's how RT is able to put out that story because
[03:23:44.360 --> 03:23:50.360]  they say they're actually on top of it. Refreshing the website to get on the story first. We're not
[03:23:50.360 --> 03:23:54.920]  lazy. You are. That's why we're kicking your ass and they're not happy about it.
[03:23:57.080 --> 03:24:01.000]  Wow. This is biblical. All right. Well, I said, I'll let you take over. This is just great to
[03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:03.320]  talk to you, Paul. I got ahold of Paul's. I guess you can go on air with us.
[03:24:06.120 --> 03:24:11.400]  What else is coming up in the next 35 minutes? And what are your big concerns? Because, I mean,
[03:24:11.400 --> 03:24:15.560]  let me tell you, they're desperate. They want to be the heroes. I smell false flag. I smell them
[03:24:16.200 --> 03:24:20.280]  killing the election, blowing something up, blaming it on us. I mean, I just see nastiness.
[03:24:20.280 --> 03:24:23.640]  I see the preparation. I want to shut down the media. I think they're going to go all in.
[03:24:23.640 --> 03:24:28.040]  They're either going to back off and realize that they can't stop us and try to just sabotage us
[03:24:28.600 --> 03:24:35.800]  or they're going to go all in, Paul. I think the only guarantee is you will see riots after the
[03:24:35.800 --> 03:24:41.560]  election if Trump wins. I mean, that's the guarantee, isn't it? Now that we know, again, that whole
[03:24:41.560 --> 03:24:46.280]  thing about, oh, Trump's rhetoric is responsible for the violence at his own rallies. Don't you dare
[03:24:46.280 --> 03:24:51.400]  say anyone else is responsible? That's the conspiracy theory. O'Keefe video completely debunked.
[03:24:51.400 --> 03:24:55.880]  They funded it. They arranged it. And we have WikiLeaks on top of it. Not just O'Keefe.
[03:24:56.520 --> 03:25:02.600]  We have the WikiLeaks that couple with it. Exactly. So that's proven. They fund. They
[03:25:02.600 --> 03:25:08.280]  arrange violence against Trump, against his supporters. That's why you see graffiti doped
[03:25:08.280 --> 03:25:13.240]  everywhere, Republican HQs being firebombed. That's what you're going to see if Trump wins.
[03:25:13.240 --> 03:25:17.720]  That's the only guarantee. All because he doesn't want to start a war with someone doing nothing
[03:25:17.720 --> 03:25:23.560]  to us because he's a good person. Well, I mean, that's the problem. While, you know,
[03:25:23.560 --> 03:25:28.680]  Russians are being told where to find their nearest nuclear bunker, Americans are being told to
[03:25:28.680 --> 03:25:35.560]  obsess about some ex porn star who says that Trump asked for her phone number. Just coincidentally,
[03:25:35.560 --> 03:25:40.360]  the day before she's got this big video release or whatever, and she wants national press attention.
[03:25:40.360 --> 03:25:44.200]  That's what Americans are being told to consume. Russians are being told,
[03:25:44.200 --> 03:25:48.280]  find your nearest nuclear bunker because there's a pretty good chance there could be
[03:25:48.280 --> 03:25:52.680]  a massive nuclear holocaust in World War Three if Hillary Clinton is elected.
[03:25:52.680 --> 03:25:56.680]  So again, that's the split. And then they spin it and claim Trump's going to cause World War Three.
[03:25:56.680 --> 03:26:03.880]  Yeah, exactly. But the riots will only happen if Trump wins because those are the people who riot.
[03:26:03.880 --> 03:26:08.040]  Those are the people who are paid to riot by the DNC, by Hillary Clinton.
[03:26:08.040 --> 03:26:11.720]  Well, I want to say this. We have proof Soros is funding in the emails. We already had proof.
[03:26:11.720 --> 03:26:16.200]  We have proof she's doing it. We need to start seeing in grand juries grow up,
[03:26:16.200 --> 03:26:20.600]  not be cowards at the state level, Democrats this whole time and start indicting people.
[03:26:20.600 --> 03:26:24.120]  I mean, we need to start indictments now. And I don't want to hear it. Oh, it's too dangerous.
[03:26:24.120 --> 03:26:28.280]  I'm sticking my neck way out here, folks, to stop being cowards. I mean, you know what I mean, Paul?
[03:26:30.120 --> 03:26:34.760]  Exactly. And the other narrative they've got going is, you know, Barack Obama, oh,
[03:26:34.760 --> 03:26:39.480]  Trump's whining about the rigged election. Well, first up, there's a new poll which shows that
[03:26:39.480 --> 03:26:45.080]  only four in 10 Americans are confident that there won't be election fraud. So Obama's accusing
[03:26:45.080 --> 03:26:51.320]  the majority of the population of the country of whining. Secondly, there's a new study that came out.
[03:26:51.320 --> 03:26:57.720]  They studied coverage on ABC, CBS and NBC Evening News from the 29th of July to October 20,
[03:26:58.520 --> 03:27:05.240]  categorizing how many minutes they spent on each topic. 91% of television coverage
[03:27:05.240 --> 03:27:13.320]  from those dates on ABC, CBS and NBC Evening News was negative, was hostile. 91% of coverage was
[03:27:13.320 --> 03:27:20.840]  hostile about Donald Trump. They broke it down. Controversies involving Trump. 440 minutes spent
[03:27:20.840 --> 03:27:27.080]  on those controversies. Controversies involving Hillary Clinton. Only 185 minutes less than half.
[03:27:27.640 --> 03:27:34.520]  Proof positive of rigged media by the numbers, not by Trump whining. You can look at the coverage
[03:27:34.520 --> 03:27:42.040]  of Trump's alleged sexist behavior compared to Bill Clinton's, a 15 to 1 disparity on those
[03:27:42.040 --> 03:27:45.800]  network news shows. Which basically means total blackout, but it's not working. So what do they do?
[03:27:45.800 --> 03:27:53.320]  Well, I mean, we'll see if it worked. They did a poll which found that 55% thought the media's
[03:27:53.320 --> 03:27:57.720]  coverage had been biased against Trump. It should be way more than that. So as I said,
[03:27:57.720 --> 03:28:01.800]  unfortunately, you've got a lot of weak-minded, stupid people who still support this.
[03:28:01.800 --> 03:28:05.640]  Sure, but isn't the cherry on top? Obamacare is already double premiums on average.
[03:28:05.640 --> 03:28:11.160]  None of their 25% increase was supposed to be free. I mean, can't their constituents
[03:28:11.160 --> 03:28:16.840]  really grow up and realize mainstream media is there to slit their throats? Well, again,
[03:28:16.840 --> 03:28:21.480]  it's this idea of they're losing their power, they're losing their influence, but they still had
[03:28:22.280 --> 03:28:27.320]  a unified narrative. So they all report the same thing on the evening news with the same
[03:28:27.320 --> 03:28:33.320]  thing, the same smear. It's a cult. Yeah, but that's going to wash away increasingly. And,
[03:28:33.320 --> 03:28:37.960]  you know, now they've been completely disprover on the Hillary's health thing. They had to come out
[03:28:37.960 --> 03:28:43.000]  and admit, yeah, we smeared everyone as conspiracy theorists. We were wrong. So we won on that score.
[03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:46.680]  You know, what else is going to come out where they're going to have to at least admit this?
[03:28:46.680 --> 03:28:51.960]  Could there be, there've been rumors of another tape coming out in which Hillary Clinton makes
[03:28:51.960 --> 03:28:56.920]  racist comments we know from eyewitnesses like Tracy Martin, the former Clinton chef,
[03:28:56.920 --> 03:28:59.800]  that she does that on a regular basis? She is a nasty woman.
[03:28:59.800 --> 03:29:04.040]  Everybody I've talked to says that she just spews if she sees anybody with color just,
[03:29:04.040 --> 03:29:08.440]  it's just horrible. It's like, what? I mean, this is crazy to him. And it's not like I'm being
[03:29:08.440 --> 03:29:12.680]  holier than that. Oh my God. She's racist stuff. I mean, I've never heard that except from scum.
[03:29:12.680 --> 03:29:17.240]  It's like this woman is super powerful. She claims she loves these people. They love her.
[03:29:17.240 --> 03:29:21.320]  And then she hates them. I mean, how do you hate people that love you? I don't get it.
[03:29:23.080 --> 03:29:28.440]  Because she's a sociopath and she has extreme difficulty in connecting to other human beings.
[03:29:29.560 --> 03:29:33.080]  Are you take over, Paul? You got to come on the show more. It's always great to have ball

[03:29:57.560 --> 03:30:05.560]  Hey there. This is Joe Biggs with info wars.com with a fun and exciting report by the sun.
[03:30:05.560 --> 03:30:10.840]  He virtually rubbed my crotch woman sexually assaulted in virtual reality. The VR virgin
[03:30:10.840 --> 03:30:14.920]  was trying out the new technology for the first time with a game called Weaver,
[03:30:14.920 --> 03:30:21.320]  what a man using the pseudonym Big Bro 442 virtually grope her. We have decided not to name
[03:30:21.320 --> 03:30:25.720]  the woman. She wrote in between a wave of zombies and demons to shoot down. I was hanging out next
[03:30:25.720 --> 03:30:32.440]  to Big Bro 442. Suddenly Big Bro 442's disembodied helmet faced me dead on and he started virtually
[03:30:32.440 --> 03:30:36.840]  rubbing my chest. The woman's first foray into virtual reality started off well as he
[03:30:36.840 --> 03:30:42.040]  experienced won me over lock stock and barrel. But just after three minutes in the virtual world,
[03:30:42.040 --> 03:30:47.880]  Big Bro 442 showed up and ruined everything. The woman cried stop to deter the heavy tech
[03:30:47.880 --> 03:30:53.800]  breather. Big Bro 442 came back at her again and she added women after all are supposed to be cool
[03:30:53.800 --> 03:30:58.120]  and take on any form of sexual harassment with the laugh but I still told him to stop. You can

[03:33:18.200 --> 03:33:28.920]  we are back it's the fourth hour of the alex jones show with me paul joseph whatson
[03:33:28.920 --> 03:33:32.840]  gonna go to our guest here in a second but i wanted to hit on a couple of headlines
[03:33:33.400 --> 03:33:41.000]  on the same topic these are up on info wars dot com murders in sweden up 80 percent in two years
[03:33:41.000 --> 03:33:47.000]  that's right the liberal basket case of sweden that we so often pick on is still enjoying its
[03:33:47.000 --> 03:33:53.000]  cultural enrichment sweden which again i believe is what eight nine million population is likely to
[03:33:53.000 --> 03:34:01.640]  get around 160 murders this year that compares to 115 murders last year and only 87 murders in
[03:34:01.640 --> 03:34:08.280]  2014 now could that be connected to the tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of
[03:34:08.280 --> 03:34:14.280]  muslim migrants that they've been importing over the last two years surely just a coincidence you
[03:34:14.280 --> 03:34:23.640]  look at neighboring norway which had in comparison just 23 murders in 2015 so a massive disparity
[03:34:23.640 --> 03:34:30.520]  murders are on the rise in sweden we've got areas of sweden like malmo being described as war zones
[03:34:30.520 --> 03:34:36.520]  you've got somali immigrants saying they want to go back home because it's safer in somalia
[03:34:36.520 --> 03:34:42.600]  than it is in some areas of sweden we have another headline sweden bans christmas streetlights to
[03:34:42.600 --> 03:34:49.320]  avoid offending muslim migrants question mark of course the authorities claim that they've banned
[03:34:49.320 --> 03:34:55.880]  christmas streetlights in all these towns and cities for safety reasons it's got nothing whatsoever
[03:34:55.880 --> 03:35:00.600]  to do with offending the tens of thousands of muslim migrants who have poured in people
[03:35:00.600 --> 03:35:05.320]  aren't buying that explanation so we're talking about sweden and now we're going to go to our
[03:35:05.320 --> 03:35:11.560]  guest who has been on the show before he's the angry foreigner that's his moniker on youtube you
[03:35:11.560 --> 03:35:17.480]  can search for that on twitter as well and find him and he's a bosnian immigrant living in sweden
[03:35:17.480 --> 03:35:23.880]  who as i said has built this very popular youtube channel thanks in part and it's very rare to have
[03:35:23.880 --> 03:35:30.120]  this in sweden or in fact in many places in europe due to his willingness to tell the truth about mass
[03:35:30.120 --> 03:35:35.880]  uncontrolled immigration and he put out a video yesterday which i posted on twitter which we're
[03:35:35.880 --> 03:35:41.880]  going to get into in a second but first to set the scene i mean i've got friends that visit sweden
[03:35:41.880 --> 03:35:49.160]  on a regular basis every month specifically malmo the stories they tell me are horrific they're
[03:35:49.160 --> 03:35:54.840]  saying it's far worse than the media is reporting they're talking about it being a common occurrence
[03:35:54.840 --> 03:36:01.000]  for people to walk down the street and just hear fire bombs going off we've seen reports of cars
[03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:08.440]  set on fire sometimes dozens a night we've seen according to them isis flags being flown at islamist
[03:36:08.440 --> 03:36:15.640]  rallies so they walk past the protest and they're literally flying isis flags at these protests
[03:36:15.640 --> 03:36:26.440]  not in raqqa not in mosul in sweden you know they just legalize the isis flag in sweden we've got
[03:36:26.440 --> 03:36:34.280]  people now in sweden in malmo imposing self-imposed curfews because they're afraid of what's happening
[03:36:34.280 --> 03:36:40.200]  migrants harassing women on the street reports of sexual assaults at these music festivals
[03:36:40.200 --> 03:36:45.320]  that the authorities again are trying to keep under wraps now obviously you know it's worse
[03:36:45.320 --> 03:36:49.320]  in some areas compared to others but i want to ask the angry foreigner who joins us now
[03:36:49.960 --> 03:36:55.000]  you know how does the media is reporting and what we learn as outsiders fit with reality
[03:36:55.000 --> 03:37:00.280]  are these problems actually a lot worse than what they're saying than what they're reporting
[03:37:01.640 --> 03:37:06.920]  well i like to say that since the last time we talked things have gotten both worse and better
[03:37:06.920 --> 03:37:11.080]  what's worse is that we're seeing more of the same old issues i mean there's stories about
[03:37:11.080 --> 03:37:15.400]  a new migrant rape almost on a weekly basis now and bathhouses and music festivals have
[03:37:15.400 --> 03:37:20.440]  basically become unsafe places for women we're seeing a new type of sex crime where migrant gangs
[03:37:20.440 --> 03:37:24.760]  team up and molest women what's changed for the better though is that the mainstream media has
[03:37:24.760 --> 03:37:29.640]  actually finally started reporting more on these issues and that changed around the time of the
[03:37:29.640 --> 03:37:35.160]  new year's eve's attack in cologne germany it's like all of a sudden the taboos disappeared
[03:37:35.160 --> 03:37:39.800]  overnight it became acceptable to criticize the view of women and foreign cultures and
[03:37:39.800 --> 03:37:44.680]  immigrant related crime and there's been a bunch of debate articles about that by established people
[03:37:44.680 --> 03:37:49.400]  and established media outlets so i feel like there's an overall change for the better and the
[03:37:49.400 --> 03:37:54.440]  social debate about these things it's more okay to talk about it now and people are even more
[03:37:54.440 --> 03:37:59.080]  fed up with the racist label but we're far from perfect i mean there's a lot of stuff that isn't
[03:37:59.080 --> 03:38:04.040]  being covered and as usual you have to go to the alternative media to get to you know to get the
[03:38:04.040 --> 03:38:09.320]  full picture so to speak and uh what happened on godland recently with the wheelchair bound women
[03:38:09.960 --> 03:38:15.400]  really goes to show that uh we're far from perfect yeah let's get into that again another
[03:38:15.400 --> 03:38:22.200]  harrow you said basically a one rape per week now we post the stories routinely we had this harrowing
[03:38:22.200 --> 03:38:27.560]  incident a woman in a wheelchair gang raped by migrants explain what happened and then the
[03:38:27.560 --> 03:38:33.800]  fallout from that afterwards well basically she was visiting a restaurant in the evening and she
[03:38:33.800 --> 03:38:39.080]  shared a cab home with uh with the migrant uh from what i understand she didn't know me personally
[03:38:39.080 --> 03:38:45.800]  and when she arrived she asked if um she could use this bathroom you know what ended up happening is
[03:38:45.800 --> 03:38:52.600]  that five migrants raped her raped her for hours on end in that bathroom they took the wheelchair
[03:38:52.600 --> 03:38:58.360]  away from her and um when she was finally able to escape the first thing she did was call the police
[03:38:59.000 --> 03:39:03.720]  but what happened then was that they took them into custody for a hearing but released them
[03:39:03.720 --> 03:39:09.720]  shortly after because the prosecutor didn't feel like the woman's story was robust enough and he
[03:39:09.720 --> 03:39:15.800]  didn't feel that she thought back enough so they were released out of custody this is a woman in
[03:39:15.800 --> 03:39:20.360]  a wheelchair and they're saying she didn't fight back enough yeah despite the fact that she had
[03:39:20.360 --> 03:39:27.560]  documented injuries uh so naturally people became absolutely furious and uh a demonstration took
[03:39:27.560 --> 03:39:33.400]  place and the purpose there was just to protest the decision to let these suspects go and to show
[03:39:33.400 --> 03:39:39.240]  support for the women but what ended up happening after that is that every magazine on gotland
[03:39:40.200 --> 03:39:46.440]  labeled them as nazis and the mainstream media in you know sweden as well labeled them as nazis
[03:39:46.440 --> 03:39:53.080]  as well uh basically it was a huge smear campaign against these ordinary citizens who there weren't
[03:39:53.080 --> 03:40:00.120]  even politically aligned in any special team they just felt it was messed up and also the feminist
[03:40:00.120 --> 03:40:06.360]  party and the left party on gotland arranged a demonstration against racism and sexism
[03:40:06.360 --> 03:40:13.320]  because they didn't like the the enticed debates online uh they're the angry reactions they weren't
[03:40:13.320 --> 03:40:20.120]  the protestants so so you had a defenseless woman in a wheelchair being gang raped by migrant men
[03:40:20.120 --> 03:40:26.280]  and the feminist response was to come out and slam people who were upset about that not to actually
[03:40:26.280 --> 03:40:33.640]  defend the defenseless woman right yeah it's it's terribly perverse i mean they did not focus on the
[03:40:33.640 --> 03:40:38.600]  victim at all these people call themselves women's right activists and they didn't focus on a woman
[03:40:38.600 --> 03:40:45.160]  they just use the events to advertise some political point about how sweden is racist or something
[03:40:45.160 --> 03:40:49.400]  one of the spokespersons for the feminist party said something along the lines that
[03:40:50.440 --> 03:40:56.200]  this isn't an issue of immigration or culture it's the problem is the destructive male norm
[03:40:56.200 --> 03:41:02.680]  and the perspective that swedish men need to protect swedish women is part of the problem
[03:41:02.680 --> 03:41:07.960]  the problem that creates rape so to speak uh you can't make this this is what we saw in
[03:41:07.960 --> 03:41:12.520]  norway as well because of course they haven't had anything like the same level of problems but again
[03:41:12.520 --> 03:41:18.520]  there was problems with migrants raping women they came out and blamed it on Nordic drinking culture
[03:41:19.240 --> 03:41:25.560]  they again they it's all about men it's not about a belief system where they literally have a game
[03:41:25.560 --> 03:41:31.480]  called the rape game i would i would argue that that was the problem not the gender of the people
[03:41:31.480 --> 03:41:37.560]  carrying this out right well yeah i mean norway did something great when they introduced uh
[03:41:37.560 --> 03:41:44.520]  basically consent classes for everyone who's a new newly arrived immigrant it's not a perfect solution
[03:41:44.520 --> 03:41:49.880]  doesn't fix everything but it's sure step in the right direction whereas in sweden such a suggestion
[03:41:49.880 --> 03:41:58.040]  is you didn't suggest it is racist uh it's ridiculous now again the stats that we last
[03:41:58.040 --> 03:42:04.920]  had and i think this was from 2014 rapes have skyrocketed by 1400 percent since the mid 70s
[03:42:04.920 --> 03:42:09.480]  and again the left tries to say oh well they changed the definition well fine but still
[03:42:09.480 --> 03:42:14.440]  is a massive problem they've got the second highest number of rapes in the world after lasotho
[03:42:14.440 --> 03:42:21.480]  77.6 percent of the country's rapists are identified as foreigners that number is probably higher now
[03:42:21.480 --> 03:42:27.160]  given the influx of the last two years i mean this is clearly a problem right i mean how how can they
[03:42:27.160 --> 03:42:33.080]  deny that this is a problem when we see these stories every single week and again you talk about
[03:42:33.080 --> 03:42:39.240]  the music festivals that came out that the police they admitted they were covering that up so as not
[03:42:39.240 --> 03:42:45.080]  to give a boost to the sweden democrats which is the anti immigration party so there's clearly a
[03:42:45.080 --> 03:42:50.760]  political objective not only to cover up the terror attacks the low level intensity violence the
[03:42:50.760 --> 03:42:56.280]  fire bombings but these rapes because again the political establishment doesn't want sweden democrats
[03:42:56.280 --> 03:43:04.120]  to use this to get in ahead in the polls yes exactly and the thing is that uh i don't recognize
[03:43:04.120 --> 03:43:11.400]  this 77 number so i'm not sure about that but the thing is we sweden doesn't actually carry out any
[03:43:11.400 --> 03:43:19.480]  statistics or research on perpetrator ethnicity anymore they did back in 2005 i believe was the
[03:43:19.480 --> 03:43:25.000]  last time and what they found was an over representation and what i found come across myself
[03:43:25.000 --> 03:43:30.840]  from various articles and statistics i mean there was one the biggest prison in sweden for rapists
[03:43:30.840 --> 03:43:36.680]  half of the perpetrators couldn't go through treatment because they needed interpreters so
[03:43:36.680 --> 03:43:42.280]  obviously there's a big over representation it's a big problem and i'm sure that you know people
[03:43:42.280 --> 03:43:47.800]  feel more comfortable to press charges nowadays and the definition changing plays a role but we
[03:43:47.800 --> 03:43:53.640]  cannot dismiss the role of immigration as well so i feel like there's there's not much nuance to the
[03:43:53.640 --> 03:44:00.440]  debate here now let me read this out of the express they reported when this first cropped up
[03:44:00.440 --> 03:44:04.280]  about six eight months ago people again thought it was a hoax they thought it was a fake story
[03:44:04.920 --> 03:44:12.280]  lond county in south sweden is now considering giving jihadi defectors that's isis fighters
[03:44:12.280 --> 03:44:18.680]  incentives to reintegrate into society the mooted benefits or housing grants help to re-enter the
[03:44:18.680 --> 03:44:24.280]  workforce and free driving licenses so you've got actual jihadists isis fighters coming back from
[03:44:24.280 --> 03:44:29.560]  iraq and syria they're not turning them away at the border when they try to re-enter sweden
[03:44:29.560 --> 03:44:35.320]  if they do enter sweden they're not deporting them they're giving them benefits and driving
[03:44:35.320 --> 03:44:41.560]  licenses and trying to reintegrate them into the workforce i mean at what point does al-Baghdadi
[03:44:41.560 --> 03:44:47.800]  the leader of isis just you know get on a plane to sweden and declare it an isis caliphate i mean
[03:44:47.800 --> 03:44:53.400]  would he be welcomed at this point well i mean yeah it's crazy because they wouldn't do this
[03:44:53.400 --> 03:45:00.120]  uh with nazis during the second world war they wouldn't do this with isis soldiers it's crazy
[03:45:00.120 --> 03:45:05.880]  how just because these people are immigrants or muslims then we're supposed to pamper them
[03:45:05.880 --> 03:45:10.760]  and this isn't anything new actually i mean this story broke out recently but i remember
[03:45:10.760 --> 03:45:17.160]  about six months ago uh stockholm suggested the same thing and uh before that rebro suggested
[03:45:17.160 --> 03:45:22.200]  the same thing i don't know if they're actually doing it it's a suggestion but i do know that
[03:45:22.200 --> 03:45:30.680]  that one town actually had a jihadist uh having an internship at some place so it wouldn't surprise
[03:45:30.680 --> 03:45:36.680]  me if it were to be put into effect because well nothing surprises me at that at this point to be
[03:45:36.680 --> 03:45:42.120]  honest i mean i wrote a story about i think it was a year ago swedish immigration officer
[03:45:42.120 --> 03:45:47.800]  exposed as jihadist sympathizer this was somebody actually within the government liking isis
[03:45:47.800 --> 03:45:54.760]  post on facebook you had sweden's top islamophobia expert go enjoy in isis so you've got even people
[03:45:54.760 --> 03:45:59.080]  within the government now but again the point we emphasize over and over and this is what
[03:45:59.080 --> 03:46:04.360]  interests me there was a video that came out of germany last week where they spoke to immigrants
[03:46:04.360 --> 03:46:10.360]  who had been there you know for 20 30 40 years and they said and this is what i hear from everyone
[03:46:10.360 --> 03:46:15.240]  including in france where my mom teaches english and speaks to a lot of people who say the same thing
[03:46:15.240 --> 03:46:22.440]  this is a new breed of migrants unlike anything before so these these german migrants were on
[03:46:22.440 --> 03:46:27.080]  tape and yeah we've always had immigration and sometimes they don't integrate but normally
[03:46:27.080 --> 03:46:30.760]  in the past they would keep themselves to themselves it wouldn't be a huge problem but
[03:46:30.760 --> 03:46:36.520]  they were on tape saying since these new migrants have come into germany these migrants who have
[03:46:36.520 --> 03:46:41.640]  been there for 20 34 years they have food stalls they have businesses they're saying we just don't
[03:46:41.640 --> 03:46:47.960]  sell anything anymore they don't buy from us they bring in their own alien culture we've integrated
[03:46:47.960 --> 03:46:52.920]  they don't integrate and it was the long-term immigrants in germany that were calling for
[03:46:52.920 --> 03:46:58.840]  them all to be deported so again that nuance is there isn't it this is a new breed that's unlike
[03:46:58.840 --> 03:47:05.160]  anything we've seen in the past 34 years in europe well exactly i mean i've seen immigrants become
[03:47:05.160 --> 03:47:11.240]  very very worried they live in the ghettos and they notice that the radicalization has become far
[03:47:11.240 --> 03:47:18.040]  worse the past 20 years or so and i think a big issue here is which isn't talked about a lot is
[03:47:18.040 --> 03:47:22.920]  Saudi Arabia i mean they're funding the building of mosques all over the world and then they send
[03:47:22.920 --> 03:47:27.960]  their preachers there to preach Wahhabism which is the most radical interpretation of Islam they're
[03:47:27.960 --> 03:47:32.520]  basically sending preachers all over the world to radicalize the muslim population and this is
[03:47:32.520 --> 03:47:40.120]  this is never talked about really so you need to look at that there too now i mean we heard about
[03:47:40.120 --> 03:47:45.880]  this proposal back at the beginning of the year to deport 80 000 failed asylum seekers you know
[03:47:45.880 --> 03:47:51.000]  you've got the swedish democrats rising in popularity has that process of deportation
[03:47:51.000 --> 03:47:56.280]  actually been happening and do you see any kind of solution in in the sweden democrats as a way
[03:47:56.280 --> 03:48:00.520]  of rolling back some of these policies that have caused this mass uncontrolled immigration
[03:48:00.520 --> 03:48:10.120]  well um last night checked it's basically not possible i mean 50 000 migrants i believe or
[03:48:10.120 --> 03:48:16.200]  maybe it was 80 000 uh were rejected got their asylum application rejected and only a portion a
[03:48:16.200 --> 03:48:20.680]  small portion of these were successfully deported i mean most of these people go underground and
[03:48:20.680 --> 03:48:26.920]  some of them if they are deported they just catch a train ticket and go right back to sweden so i mean
[03:48:26.920 --> 03:48:32.360]  it's it's it costs a lot of money and doesn't have much effect when it comes to sweden democrats
[03:48:32.360 --> 03:48:38.520]  they have in a sense changed i mean they're not an accepted party they're a third biggest party
[03:48:38.520 --> 03:48:43.880]  but there nobody wants to negotiate with them but we can see this over time that they have
[03:48:43.880 --> 03:48:49.320]  made predictions that turned out to be true and ideas that they suggested are now basically
[03:48:49.320 --> 03:48:56.600]  implemented i mean sweden is now finally considering doing age tests of refugee children who often i
[03:48:56.600 --> 03:49:04.360]  mean most of these guys look like they're 25 30 40 so there's a big scam going on here and uh
[03:49:04.360 --> 03:49:10.840]  recently we implemented border controls which which severely reduced the levels of immigration so
[03:49:11.480 --> 03:49:17.960]  you know even though people don't want to admit it um the sweden democrats have changed politics
[03:49:19.560 --> 03:49:23.880]  and again that's that's where that pressure is needed if you get an increasing number of the
[03:49:23.880 --> 03:49:29.240]  population at least just signaling their support for the sweden democrats then again it can cause the
[03:49:29.800 --> 03:49:34.680]  controlling parties to change their behavior of course you had Merkel come out a few days ago
[03:49:34.680 --> 03:49:40.680]  and say that singing christmas carols would be a good way to reassert christianity in germany
[03:49:40.680 --> 03:49:46.920]  after what she's done in importing you know this islamic wave i mean the fact is hillary clinton
[03:49:46.920 --> 03:49:53.320]  wants to import 65 000 quote migrants or refugees that's just a starting number and you know we're
[03:49:53.320 --> 03:49:59.640]  being told by the media in fact you had ads in sweden where it was like a woman in a hijab saying
[03:49:59.640 --> 03:50:06.040]  this is the new reality sweden is now a safe refuge for migrants so they were basically
[03:50:06.040 --> 03:50:12.200]  saying sweden is no longer an individual country with its own identity it's just a refuge it's
[03:50:12.200 --> 03:50:18.840]  basically a giant migrant camp for these quote refugees many of whom aren't even refugees how
[03:50:18.840 --> 03:50:25.400]  do you think swedes feel about that when they see those kind of ads on television well most swedish
[03:50:25.400 --> 03:50:31.400]  people actually uh even though they don't express it they they do believe in common sense they do
[03:50:31.400 --> 03:50:36.760]  believe that sweden should be swedish they do believe in the concept of when in Rome i mean
[03:50:36.760 --> 03:50:42.360]  swedish people wouldn't move to Saudi Arabia in demand that they legalize porn and alcohol so
[03:50:42.360 --> 03:50:47.240]  i mean i don't but i don't buy that multiculturalism is i mean our politicians and journalists try to
[03:50:47.240 --> 03:50:51.240]  push it on a population but i don't think that the population wants that i think they want
[03:50:51.880 --> 03:50:57.240]  their culture to be their culture so i mean i thought we'll be right back with the final
[03:50:57.240 --> 03:51:02.040]  segment of the alex joneshow and the angry foreigners right soon we'll be back my name

[03:55:28.920 --> 03:55:34.680]  cars business is being fire bombed this is the european socialism that barack obama endorsed
[03:55:34.680 --> 03:55:40.280]  that hillary clinton wants to continue the angry foreigner just final comments here and tell people
[03:55:40.280 --> 03:55:47.320]  how they can find your youtube channel and your twitter well first of all 70 percent of the swedish
[03:55:47.320 --> 03:55:51.560]  population want to decrease the immigration so people are fed up and what you're seeing with the
[03:55:51.560 --> 03:55:55.800]  politicians and a journalist doesn't reflect the people they don't represent the people anymore and
[03:55:55.800 --> 03:56:00.520]  i'm actually hopeful for sweden's future because we're seeing a growing resistance and we're seeing
[03:56:00.520 --> 03:56:05.800]  people getting sick of the racist label and more willing to speak up so i'm actually hopeful and
[03:56:05.800 --> 03:56:10.360]  if you want to check out my channel just search angry foreigner and uh you'll come straight to my
[03:56:10.360 --> 03:56:17.080]  videos okay there goes the angry foreigner thanks for joining us and again check out his video on
[03:56:17.080 --> 03:56:22.760]  the woman raped the wheelchair woman raped by migrants that went up yesterday check out his
[03:56:22.760 --> 03:56:28.360]  other videos about sweden welcome to sweden was the big viral here so definitely go and check
[03:56:28.360 --> 03:56:33.400]  out the angry foreigner on youtube final couple of minutes here on the alex jones show we're
[03:56:33.400 --> 03:56:38.920]  going to get into some final news i was talking again earlier about that study this is an mrc
[03:56:38.920 --> 03:56:46.520]  study they took abc cbs mbc evening news they counted the minutes of their coverage split
[03:56:46.520 --> 03:56:51.960]  between hillary clinton and donald trump they found that personal controversies involving trump
[03:56:52.680 --> 03:56:59.320]  covered 440 minutes again this is the evening news between 29th of july and october 20
[03:56:59.320 --> 03:57:06.360]  440 minutes on trump controversies compared to only 185 on clinton so again it was more than
[03:57:06.360 --> 03:57:11.720]  double for trump trump's treatment of women was given more time by news networks than hillary's
[03:57:11.720 --> 03:57:19.240]  pay for play scandal and email scandal combined so those two hillary scandals combined still got
[03:57:19.240 --> 03:57:25.800]  less air coverage compared to trump's so-called treatment of women out of 569 such statements
[03:57:25.800 --> 03:57:32.840]  about the health or prospects of trump's campaign so how well his campaign was doing 85 percent
[03:57:32.840 --> 03:57:40.360]  were negative compared to just 38 percent that were negative for hillary clinton so again
[03:57:40.360 --> 03:57:44.920]  they're not talking about the ok videos they're not talking about the wiki leaks releases
[03:57:44.920 --> 03:57:50.920]  you have barack obama saying that donald trump is whining about the election being rigged about
[03:57:50.920 --> 03:57:57.960]  the media being rigged these facts prove him right it's not whining it's statistics it's
[03:57:57.960 --> 03:58:04.280]  documented right here basket of deplorables hillary clinton got just seven minutes of total coverage
[03:58:04.280 --> 03:58:10.840]  compared to trump's tax returns which got 33 minutes of total coverage on these evening news
[03:58:10.840 --> 03:58:18.520]  networks the verdict is in the media is completely rigged but still they did a poll afterwards which
[03:58:18.520 --> 03:58:25.160]  which found that 55 thought the media's coverage had been biased against trump that should be way
[03:58:25.160 --> 03:58:31.480]  more this is clear the elections being rigged the media is most definitely rigged the wiki
[03:58:31.480 --> 03:58:37.720]  leaks emails have proven it and now how will the american people react on november 8 this is the
