[00:00.000 --> 00:19.440]  This is the most important thing Trump ever said.
[00:19.440 --> 00:25.640]  Always remember they are coming after me because I am fighting for you.
[00:25.640 --> 00:28.880]  That's what's happening.
[00:28.880 --> 00:35.120]  Always remember they are coming after me because I am fighting for you.
[00:35.120 --> 00:37.980]  That's what's happening.
[00:37.980 --> 00:44.600]  Always remember they are coming after me because I am fighting for you.
[00:44.600 --> 00:47.800]  That's what's happening.
[00:47.800 --> 00:53.620]  Always remember they are coming after me because I am fighting for you.
[00:53.620 --> 00:54.620]  That's what's happening.
[00:54.620 --> 00:55.920]  They're coming after you.
[00:55.920 --> 01:03.060]  Well, he's announced his new commission Biden has who's not President-elect, another giant
[01:03.060 --> 01:05.580]  hoax on its face.
[01:05.580 --> 01:10.060]  And in the commission is like a legion of Satan, Ezekiel Emanuel that said he wants
[01:10.060 --> 01:13.380]  death panels of people killed at age 75 under government orders.
[01:13.380 --> 01:17.540]  And he wants to bankrupt the United States under cloud of piven.
[01:17.540 --> 01:19.780]  He says publicly he supports communism.
[01:19.780 --> 01:25.060]  They have another scumbag on the board that says they're going to ration healthcare to
[01:25.060 --> 01:26.720]  Americans.
[01:26.720 --> 01:28.820]  These commies will hurt you real bad.
[01:28.820 --> 01:31.740]  You see what they do to the cities they control.
[01:31.740 --> 01:34.700]  Remember Hillary just a couple of months ago and then everybody else like parents repeated
[01:34.700 --> 01:35.700]  it in the Democratic Party.
[01:35.700 --> 01:40.300]  He said do not conceal under any circumstances because they were projecting a big Trump win
[01:40.300 --> 01:44.020]  and he did win in the states he won by a bigger margin and he was winning by a bigger margin
[01:44.020 --> 01:48.980]  until they closed the polls in those five, six magic states that night.
[01:48.980 --> 01:53.780]  Now they're in full panic mode because Trump just won North Carolina and Alaska.
[01:53.780 --> 01:59.180]  Oh, they've been counting real slow when the states are going for Trump.
[01:59.180 --> 02:04.780]  But when the states were going against Trump, they were all done that night.
[02:04.780 --> 02:06.020]  This is simply incredible.
[02:06.020 --> 02:11.180]  But here's Hillary saying do not conceive the election no matter what and then until
[02:11.180 --> 02:15.660]  the votes are certified by the state, Trump is not reelected.
[02:15.660 --> 02:21.140]  Oh, but now within five days of the election, they told you the media did as the new king
[02:21.140 --> 02:26.140]  makers, because they decided themselves to say that they decide who the president elect
[02:26.140 --> 02:27.140]  is.
[02:27.140 --> 02:28.140]  No, that's not the law.
[02:28.140 --> 02:29.140]  Incredible.
[02:29.140 --> 02:30.140]  Here's Hillary.
[02:30.140 --> 02:35.300]  My advice to Joe Biden, I've told the campaign this obviously is do not concede under any
[02:35.300 --> 02:43.780]  circumstances because I believe the other side is going to cheat and and sneak and try
[02:43.780 --> 02:44.780]  to do everything.
[02:44.780 --> 02:48.340]  He says if he loses, he's not going to leave if he loses.
[02:48.340 --> 02:56.060]  Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out
[02:56.060 --> 03:03.820]  and eventually I do believe he will win if we don't give an inch and if we are as focused
[03:03.820 --> 03:06.900]  and relentless as the other side is.
[03:06.900 --> 03:07.900]  My advice to Joe Biden.
[03:07.900 --> 03:11.300]  So there were two parallel plans, plan A, B, and they actually went with C as I said
[03:11.300 --> 03:13.700]  on Monday and Tuesday with my prediction.
[03:13.700 --> 03:18.100]  A was to try to just steal it outright with so much election fraud, so much hacking, so
[03:18.100 --> 03:21.420]  many scams that they could say Biden won that night.
[03:21.420 --> 03:25.060]  When it became clear that wasn't the case, they paused it, brought in all the extra
[03:25.060 --> 03:29.820]  ballots, all the graph show that straight up, not not organic, but straight lines to
[03:29.820 --> 03:30.820]  get him above.
[03:30.820 --> 03:34.660]  They don't care they're flaunting it in your face.
[03:34.660 --> 03:39.660]  But I said they might go with C where they pause it, but it only goes for a few days
[03:39.660 --> 03:43.660]  and then they start stuffing the ballot boxes and just prematurely announce him without
[03:43.660 --> 03:47.500]  even completing the stuffing.
[03:47.500 --> 03:48.500]  And that's what they did.
[03:48.500 --> 03:52.060]  They did a hybrid of it to make it look like it was legitimate for a few days and no one
[03:52.060 --> 03:54.500]  knows who the real winner is and it's paused.
[03:54.500 --> 03:58.820]  So you would think that process was legitimate so that when the mainstream media announced
[03:58.820 --> 04:02.780]  the winner, you would buy now that mainstream media tells you who's the winner.
[04:02.780 --> 04:10.220]  It's the state clerks, it's the county clerks, it's the legislatures.
[04:10.220 --> 04:14.100]  If that can't be decided, that's the Constitution.
[04:14.100 --> 04:18.180]  Where Joe Biden broke his promise too, he said that he would not declare himself the
[04:18.180 --> 04:20.580]  winner until all votes were counted.
[04:20.580 --> 04:28.500]  But then they flipped that around, now they don't want them counted, here it is.
[04:28.500 --> 04:33.260]  Biden final question for you, will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote
[04:33.260 --> 04:38.700]  is counted and will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently
[04:38.700 --> 04:39.700]  certified?
[04:39.700 --> 04:40.700]  Yes.
[04:40.700 --> 04:41.700]  And here's the deal.
[04:41.700 --> 05:04.340]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed and why is that?
[05:04.340 --> 05:08.940]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there but a giant tree like bush grows from it that
[05:08.940 --> 05:12.500]  produces more mustard seeds.
[05:12.500 --> 05:16.620]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[05:16.620 --> 05:17.620]  They didn't know why.
[05:17.620 --> 05:22.740]  Well, with modern science we know it's one of the purest, cleanest, organic forms of
[05:22.740 --> 05:24.260]  selenium.
[05:24.260 --> 05:32.140]  We have bio-true selenium sold out for months back in stock at infowarsstore.com at 50% off
[05:32.140 --> 05:36.060]  store ride free shipping and triple the Patriot points.

[05:42.980 --> 05:47.740]  in that it funds our operation but if you don't know about selenium, research it.

[06:10.380 --> 06:15.180]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[06:15.180 --> 06:16.900]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:16.900 --> 06:18.460]  Well so does he.
[06:18.460 --> 06:24.940]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:24.940 --> 06:31.620]  The level of historical greatness, the level of historical developments, the level of the
[06:31.620 --> 06:38.540]  magnitude is unparalleled in my lifetime and in anyone else's lifetime living by any historical
[06:38.540 --> 06:40.060]  yardstick.
[06:40.060 --> 06:45.820]  The United States is fighting for its life in an internal civil war inside the federal
[06:45.820 --> 06:52.940]  state and local governments with a multinational consortium that is using stolen CIA tools
[06:52.940 --> 07:00.500]  to hack the election, that information is now coming out and is now confirmed.
[07:00.500 --> 07:06.860]  Evidence is whoring out all over the country as elections, state elections, local elections
[07:06.860 --> 07:10.980]  flip to Republicans, never to Democrats.
[07:10.980 --> 07:14.460]  As the counties realize they're under criminal investigation, they're going back and doing
[07:14.460 --> 07:22.140]  audits and reviews and finding, oh sorry, we flipped all these votes from Trump to Biden
[07:22.140 --> 07:29.900]  and in the process, straight ticket flipped it away from all the other Republicans.
[07:29.900 --> 07:35.740]  There's the headline on infowars.com, global exclusive, civil war inside federal government,
[07:35.740 --> 07:40.260]  raging, Trump moving against deep state coup plotters, watch live.
[07:40.260 --> 07:44.700]  Now I don't just have that from a lot of high level sources at the Pentagon, I don't just
[07:44.700 --> 07:49.500]  have that from CIA sources that have been very accurate in the past, I can watch it
[07:49.500 --> 07:55.660]  happen from the enemy side with Brennan, former director of the CIA, voted for the Communist
[07:55.660 --> 08:01.220]  twice in college, says he's a Communist now, joined Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia, that's Al-Qaeda,
[08:01.220 --> 08:06.260]  that's on record, this America-hating sack of garbage put in all the illegal surveillance
[08:06.260 --> 08:12.260]  grids on junior family spot on the president illegally, he went on TV yesterday and said,
[08:12.260 --> 08:19.460]  we need a palace coup, he invoked the 25th amendment and removed Trump, he's so dangerous
[08:19.460 --> 08:25.300]  because he took over the Pentagon and yes he did, he's the president still, what happened?
[08:25.300 --> 08:30.380]  Well you notice they brought in that former special forces commander who was a protege
[08:30.380 --> 08:39.260]  of General Flynn as secretary of defense and then all these folks who have been very
[08:39.260 --> 08:46.180]  prominent let's just say behind the scenes have all been moved in to the Pentagon and
[08:46.180 --> 08:52.180]  South Com and all the boys down in Florida and so the fight is on and that commie Wahhabist
[08:52.180 --> 08:59.780]  piece of trash Brennan is crapping bricks right now, 70 days left.
[08:59.780 --> 09:06.620]  We are in the 79 days of hell with an actual chai combat coup with thousands of videos
[09:06.620 --> 09:12.260]  and recordings of hundreds saying he's a Chinese agent under the head of Chinese intelligence,
[09:12.260 --> 09:17.900]  the head of it, it's so secret the name's not even known.
[09:17.900 --> 09:24.140]  So I mean this is unbelievable, this would be like having video of the hookers pissing
[09:24.140 --> 09:27.820]  on Trump that never happened, I mean imagine if you had recordings of Trump going, I meet
[09:27.820 --> 09:31.900]  with the head of the Chinese intelligence, he gives me money, I'm under criminal investigation
[09:31.900 --> 09:35.300]  in the southern district, my daddy's mad at me, I got my daddy the 30 million though,
[09:35.300 --> 09:46.740]  my daddy told me do it, I mean this is ridiculous, oh and Ivan Raiklin formerly with the defense
[09:46.740 --> 09:52.500]  intelligence agency and a lawyer is going to bring you the real map, the real map that
[09:52.500 --> 09:58.060]  just so happens to be in the Pentagon right now and other places, you're gonna get a bird's
[09:58.060 --> 10:04.220]  eye view here exclusively in the second hour about what's really going on and where Trump
[10:04.220 --> 10:09.620]  really is, these are the real numbers, he's a constitutional lawyer, he's been counseled
[10:09.620 --> 10:14.260]  to the Pentagon and to other folks and he's gonna be joining us, former Green Beret and
[10:14.260 --> 10:19.260]  a great patriot, so Ivan Raiklin is coming on the transmission and Steve Pochettnik's
[10:19.260 --> 10:23.260]  coming on, he's the guy that said two weeks ago on the show they were gonna fire the
[10:23.260 --> 10:27.300]  secretary of defense and they had the CIA and others, did you hear they all got fired,
[10:27.300 --> 10:30.380]  you probably heard about the CIA director being fired and a lot of other folks being
[10:30.380 --> 10:36.420]  fired, so you better pray to Jesus folks that this turns around because we are in a dangerous
[10:36.420 --> 10:42.500]  situation, we have a foreign chai-com globalist backed attack on America, we have real bonafide
[10:42.500 --> 10:47.300]  election meddling, we have massive voter fraud, election fraud, deep state hacking, we know
[10:47.300 --> 10:55.900]  the tools and we know the programs that they use to do it, scorecard and the hammer and
[10:55.900 --> 10:59.980]  it's all coming out, so when you hear that Trump has the proof and know who did it, he
[10:59.980 --> 11:07.260]  does off scorecard and hammer and these are real contacts inside about the fight that's
[11:07.260 --> 11:16.100]  going on, it is absolutely unprecedented and so edge of your seat that I just can't even
[11:16.100 --> 11:20.980]  imagine growing up all these years, knowing about the new world order, knowing they were
[11:20.980 --> 11:26.540]  infiltrating taking over institutions and to have lived at almost 47 years old as a
[11:26.540 --> 11:30.460]  father of four, someone that loves this country, I know you love this country as well, to watch
[11:30.460 --> 11:35.820]  the actual attempted commie takeover with the consortium of billionaires who were tax
[11:35.820 --> 11:42.340]  exempt going to bankrupt the middle class and to have the new COVID by president-elect
[11:42.340 --> 11:49.420]  which he's not, Biden say permanent lockdown, clowered and pivoted to collapse us and to
[11:49.420 --> 11:54.860]  have club of Rome and the debos groups say we're going to teach Americans to behave,
[11:54.860 --> 11:59.260]  you're not opening for 10 years at least and they said when we're done, you will have
[11:59.260 --> 12:04.500]  basically communism, you will own nothing, you will have nothing, you know Tony Montana
[12:04.500 --> 12:09.180]  is a fictional Cuban and he's being, he's grabbed off the boat and he's sitting there
[12:09.180 --> 12:14.900]  inside customs and immigration and they say, where did you get that, you know, scar?
[12:14.900 --> 12:20.620]  And he says, listen, I want to get away from communist, you own nothing, you have nothing,
[12:20.620 --> 12:25.340]  you eat squid three times a day, you're a slave, you've got a spot every corner watching
[12:25.340 --> 12:29.980]  you, you're censored, you have no free speech, I want my democracy just like Jimmy Carter
[12:29.980 --> 12:30.980]  said.
[12:30.980 --> 12:35.940]  Folks, you look at what Tony Montana says as a fictional character and we're now living
[12:35.940 --> 12:41.860]  under the beginning of that, worse than that, they want to make you poor, they want to control
[12:41.860 --> 12:42.860]  you.
[12:42.860 --> 12:45.980]  I mean, Cuba is such a rich country, it was so rich before, money just, products, great
[12:45.980 --> 12:51.540]  people just pouring out of it, now look at them, they drive 57 Chevys and they can't
[12:51.540 --> 12:58.620]  even get basic medicine and you're witnessing the actual takeover of this country.
[12:58.620 --> 13:04.140]  I mean, this is it, if Biden gets in, it's over, they're going to gut the economy, they're
[13:04.140 --> 13:08.660]  going to bring you to your knees and then make you beg them and literally go to reeducation
[13:08.660 --> 13:11.700]  seminars to even be able to have a job.
[13:11.700 --> 13:15.700]  They're announcing truth and reconciliation commissions and you ask, why would they run
[13:15.700 --> 13:18.580]  a communist program when it's all these billionaires that control it?
[13:18.580 --> 13:22.740]  It was billionaires that put Lenin in power, it was billionaires put Mao Zedong in power,
[13:22.740 --> 13:27.100]  they wrote op-eds of the New York Times, David Rockefeller, they set offshore and give you
[13:27.100 --> 13:33.700]  a communist regime for a decade and let the communists exterminate your ass, enslave you,
[13:33.700 --> 13:38.860]  take all the men out that are strong, break everybody's will and then they always put
[13:38.860 --> 13:44.420]  a bunch of paddling women in as minders to spy on everyone.
[13:44.420 --> 13:48.900]  That's how it's been since the days of Julius Caesar, the Romans have a manual, I never
[13:48.900 --> 13:52.740]  knew about it, I heard Thomas Soule write about it decades ago and I went and looked
[13:52.740 --> 13:58.740]  it up and found references to the manual of sugar cane slave owners in the Caribbean 500
[13:58.740 --> 14:03.540]  years ago and they translated from Latin the Roman management system and they said in
[14:03.540 --> 14:07.860]  there, what we do is we bring in a bunch of slaves, back then it would be German slaves
[14:07.860 --> 14:12.060]  2000 years ago but in the case of this it was African slaves and we get the biggest,
[14:12.060 --> 14:15.580]  strongest man and we beat them to death in front of the women and children and say if
[14:15.580 --> 14:19.700]  you keep your men in line, we won't kill the rest of your men and that's how feminism
[14:19.700 --> 14:24.060]  is set up where everybody knows Aunt Jemima is in the house, the men are out in the slave
[14:24.060 --> 14:25.060]  pit.
[14:25.060 --> 14:31.500]  That's what this is, this is Roman slave techniques and that's just how this operates
[14:31.500 --> 14:36.180]  ladies and gentlemen and so women believe they're protecting everybody by going along
[14:36.180 --> 14:38.340]  with it because they have Stockholm syndrome.
[14:38.340 --> 14:42.980]  Women are about eight times more likely psychologically statistically to go under Stockholm syndrome
[14:42.980 --> 14:48.300]  because it's an adaptation to survive and that's why governments that are corrupt always
[14:48.300 --> 14:51.300]  kill the men because they know they're not going to submit and Aunt Jemima is a nice
[14:51.300 --> 14:55.860]  sweet lady but if she caught any of the black men doing something they weren't supposed
[14:55.860 --> 14:58.780]  to she'd go and have them hung.
[14:58.780 --> 15:03.740]  Well that's your feminism now, they work for Bezos, they work for the billionaires, they
[15:03.740 --> 15:08.220]  work for the slave factories in China and they are breaking this country right now and
[15:08.220 --> 15:11.860]  they are coming in to take over so when you see Black Lives Matter and they all look like
[15:11.860 --> 15:16.900]  Aunt Jemima, they are folks, they are literally Marxist, Leninist, Satan worshippers who follow
[15:16.900 --> 15:22.700]  Mao Zedong and say they hate men's very existence and the only good man is a castrated man and
[15:22.700 --> 15:27.620]  their main sacrament is no families for black people especially and that black men have
[15:27.620 --> 15:29.100]  their testicles removed.
[15:29.100 --> 15:33.260]  I'm not making it up because see they can't outright kill all the black men so they just
[15:33.260 --> 15:34.260]  cut their balls off.
[15:34.260 --> 15:38.580]  Alright when we get back I'm going to break all of this down for you today ladies and
[15:38.580 --> 15:42.300]  gentlemen and the real nature of all of this.

[16:56.020 --> 17:00.540]  The controlled corporate media are mouthpieces for any big corporation or government that
[17:00.540 --> 17:05.700]  will pay them, it's that simple and they've used our open free society against us.
[17:05.700 --> 17:09.020]  The controlled media will talk about a few mistakes I've made over the years and obsess
[17:09.020 --> 17:13.420]  over it and say see he's a liar on purpose even though our success rate, our accuracy
[17:13.420 --> 17:18.420]  rate is way, way better than theirs, we try to tell the truth, they try to lie, they try
[17:18.420 --> 17:19.420]  to deceive.
[17:19.420 --> 17:23.940]  I'm trying to get people to realize that the globalists operate and how they manipulate,
[17:23.940 --> 17:29.580]  how they bamboozle the public, I'm trying to get the public to ask questions and to
[17:29.580 --> 17:31.460]  not believe what they're told in the face.
[17:31.460 --> 17:36.220]  I'm trying to get people to research for themselves.
[17:36.220 --> 17:40.500]  The globalists and their controlled corporate press say that researching and not trusting
[17:40.500 --> 17:46.780]  media is evil and is a conspiracy theory, but again on its face that is a fraud.
[17:46.780 --> 17:50.820]  Listen to everything, question infowars, add your own research to it and then decide what
[17:50.820 --> 17:53.860]  you're going to promote to others and what news sources are accurate.
[17:53.860 --> 17:59.420]  I believe infowars is the best source out there.
[17:59.420 --> 18:23.820]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:23.820 --> 18:31.380]  You are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, live from the infowars.com
[18:31.380 --> 18:33.820]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[18:33.820 --> 18:44.420]  A lot of people are asking how we predicted everything that's unfolded with about 99% accuracy
[18:44.420 --> 18:50.500]  or about 95% accurate before, but the globalists weren't making their big move before.
[18:50.500 --> 18:53.780]  We knew their main operations, we knew their directions, we knew how they were integrating
[18:53.780 --> 18:57.660]  the systems together, we knew what their in-game was because they admitted it just all in
[18:57.660 --> 19:04.500]  different compartmentalized pieces, I reversed engineered it with others, neo-futalistic
[19:04.500 --> 19:12.700]  global fascism, collectivism for us, slavery for us, godlike above the law control for
[19:12.700 --> 19:18.340]  the new superclass and they all write books about it, they all brag about how we're slaves
[19:18.340 --> 19:22.460]  and then they set up this fake touchy feely liberal system where if we have free speech
[19:22.460 --> 19:26.060]  that's evil, we've got to protect people, we've got to take your speech away, you might
[19:26.060 --> 19:30.700]  hurt somebody's feelings, but oh, if you challenge an election or you show fraud we're going
[19:30.700 --> 19:35.980]  to ban you too, and if you challenge a vaccine that damages you we're going to ban that too,
[19:35.980 --> 19:41.900]  but if we want to say a vaccine is bad we're allowed to, it is absolutely oxymoronic suspension
[19:41.900 --> 19:42.900]  of logic tyranny.
[19:42.900 --> 19:49.860]  Again Alex Jones here, back live, let me tell you the big news here, you saw Pompeo come
[19:49.860 --> 19:54.900]  out yesterday, the Secretary of State, not cutting and running like so many other people
[19:54.900 --> 19:59.980]  and he said look, we're going to have a smooth transition to the second Trump administration
[19:59.980 --> 20:04.660]  because they know it's systemic election fraud and they know they've held up Alaska
[20:04.660 --> 20:08.860]  and North Carolina because they don't want to give any wins to the president that push
[20:08.860 --> 20:18.260]  his number up to that number that he needs, that 270, and now as Arizona moves closer
[20:18.260 --> 20:22.820]  and closer they slow the countdown because statistically if you look at the votes he's
[20:22.820 --> 20:29.900]  gained the last few days of recounting, Trump is within 10,000 votes or so, he's getting
[20:29.900 --> 20:41.820]  closer and closer and closer, and remember Fox News, Fox News had called Arizona, but
[20:41.820 --> 20:52.900]  now it's a battleground, well wait a minute, and so what's happened, we've had Decision
[20:52.900 --> 20:58.500]  HQ, one of the seven groups the media said is allowed to call the election, even though
[20:58.500 --> 21:06.380]  it's the state governments certifying the elections, they just quietly admitted that
[21:06.380 --> 21:14.580]  okay Trump just won Alaska and North Carolina, and that happened last night, almost no coverage
[21:14.580 --> 21:19.380]  of that, I've even been telling people about it that I know and they're like really, I
[21:19.380 --> 21:23.380]  didn't hear, he really, he didn't win North Carolina, he didn't win Alaska, well we would
[21:23.380 --> 21:30.020]  have heard about that, I mean the election's over, I mean you saw CNN, they said that it's
[21:30.020 --> 21:36.460]  President-elect Joe Biden, and CNN has this big headline, this info is out there on the
[21:36.460 --> 21:43.860]  internet claiming Joe Biden's not President-elect, well that's by their rules, they claim that
[21:43.860 --> 21:53.660]  that has happened, their rules, they decided with Big Tech a month ago that seven groups
[21:53.660 --> 22:00.540]  could announce who the winner was, and seven groups were accurate, and it turns out almost
[22:00.540 --> 22:04.380]  everything they've said is now being reversed, and is the process of being reversed, and
[22:04.380 --> 22:08.220]  everywhere they do spot recounts, they're finding that the votes were flipped against
[22:08.220 --> 22:14.580]  Trump, and flipped against Republicans, and a bunch of races have already flipped back,
[22:14.580 --> 22:24.380]  so we are now here at the crossroads, and the country is in deep, deep, deep, deep, deep,
[22:24.380 --> 22:27.340]  deep crisis, and if these were just Democrats trying to steal the election, I would still
[22:27.340 --> 22:31.660]  oppose it, but they're chai-com globalists that say they don't want America to exist
[22:31.660 --> 22:36.380]  itself, and that America's ethos is racist, and that America was never great, it'll never
[22:36.380 --> 22:42.900]  be great, that's Cuomo, and they've been caught lying, and they said they were going to contest
[22:42.900 --> 22:47.220]  the election no matter what, and now they just took the election over, and just announced
[22:47.220 --> 22:53.220]  that Trump is the loser when that's not the case, and as the recounts go on, and as the
[22:53.220 --> 22:59.060]  injunctions take place, you're going to find a large portion of the ballots are fake, they've
[22:59.060 --> 23:04.140]  even had the head Georgia election officials come out and say that, they've even had those
[23:04.140 --> 23:09.700]  that are over the election recount at the state level say that if these ballots were
[23:09.700 --> 23:15.740]  falsely postmarked after the election, saying they were before the election, they're being
[23:15.740 --> 23:24.260]  thrown out, and Biden is going to lose Georgia, Biden is going to lose Pennsylvania, Biden
[23:24.260 --> 23:28.780]  is going to lose Michigan, Biden is going to lose Wisconsin, Biden is going to lose
[23:28.780 --> 23:39.860]  Arizona, Biden is going to lose Nevada, if we can get into the ballots, what a moment
[23:39.860 --> 23:45.540]  to be alive, the actual takeover of America, and as Trump said, they want to get me because
[23:45.540 --> 23:50.260]  they want to get you, they got to come through me to get to you, and Biden has already said
[23:50.260 --> 23:54.380]  he's going to kill all oil exploration in the United States, he said all of it, that's
[23:54.380 --> 23:59.740]  the Chinese UN order, we're done, that's more than half our energy, no one will be able
[23:59.740 --> 24:03.500]  to do business here, they said don't worry, we'll give you a universal income where you
[24:03.500 --> 24:09.940]  don't own your car, your apartment, your clothes, everything is owned by the banks,
[24:09.940 --> 24:16.500]  so they can dictate total control, and now the head of the tables group says we engineered
[24:16.500 --> 24:21.500]  this and we're using COVID, it's not even a threat, let's just quote, to take over
[24:21.500 --> 24:26.820]  your life, they even rub it in, and they're mindless supporters, only here they're going
[24:26.820 --> 24:30.500]  to get a check for a few years, and don't think about what happens after that, this
[24:30.500 --> 24:34.780]  is where communism buys you off for a few years, you need to lay around and drink beer
[24:34.780 --> 24:40.900]  and act like a trendy, and then after that, off to the FEMA camp, they call it the fourth
[24:40.900 --> 24:48.260]  industrial revolution, Klaus Schwab just wrote a new book titled COVID-19 and the Great
[24:48.260 --> 24:53.420]  Reset, and they told you what the Great Reset is three years ago, the end of industrialized
[24:53.420 --> 24:58.900]  civilization in Europe and the United States, Canada and Australia, everything moved to
[24:58.900 --> 25:06.220]  China, everything factory farmed, everything GMO, it's just incredible, so when we come
[25:06.220 --> 25:15.140]  back, I'm going to play you, Pompeo, I'm going to play you, Brennan, I'm going to play all
[25:15.140 --> 25:20.220]  of this for you, on the other side of this quick break, and I do need this article, so
[25:20.220 --> 25:24.460]  just for time constraints, I've got to send it over, because I'm going to talk about this
[25:24.460 --> 25:31.860]  in the next segment, and it's very, very important, they've had a little trouble finding it because
[25:31.860 --> 25:38.260]  sometimes CNN changes headlines, but here it is, I'm going to send it on over to you
[25:38.260 --> 25:46.660]  guys to print it for me, misinformation channels claim Biden is no longer president-elect,
[25:46.660 --> 25:54.620]  that's not true, well it's not that he's no longer president-elect, he never was, you
[25:54.620 --> 26:01.940]  can go to the Constitution, and I'll explain that when we come back, it's the states and
[26:01.940 --> 26:07.620]  the state legislatures and the election systems that decide that and certify it at the state
[26:07.620 --> 26:14.220]  level, and then if it's still contested, it goes back to the legislatures, they can also
[26:14.220 --> 26:20.060]  try to get the electors to not go, they try to get the electors not to go with Trump,
[26:20.060 --> 26:23.220]  four years ago that failed because it was obviously a fraud, but these are the checks
[26:23.220 --> 26:33.300]  and balances built into the Constitution, the news websites are infowars.com and of

[28:53.820 --> 28:57.820]  we all know that CNN is the epitome of fake news but there's a headline on their site
[28:57.820 --> 29:04.300]  today that says there are disinformation groups and organizations saying Joe Biden is not
[29:04.300 --> 29:11.780]  president elect. Well on its face, he's not president elect because the votes have not
[29:11.780 --> 29:17.700]  been certified by any of the 50 states and counting is still going on what in seven
[29:17.700 --> 29:23.380]  of the states and Trump is gaining ground in all but one of them and then there's also
[29:23.380 --> 29:29.500]  going to be recounts audits and all the spot checks have already shown massive fraud but
[29:29.500 --> 29:34.940]  in comes the ace card the ace of spades big tech censorship is blocking not just the president
[29:34.940 --> 29:39.980]  not just members of Congress but tens of millions of Americans from even sharing local news
[29:39.980 --> 29:44.820]  stations confirming the fraud. This is a foreign backed multinational takeover of the United
[29:44.820 --> 29:51.020]  States. Trump is battling a Chinese backed new world order system fit on keeping us locked
[29:51.020 --> 29:56.660]  down forever in an economic war and bring us to our knees.
[29:56.660 --> 30:14.100]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. We're at a very
[30:14.100 --> 30:19.100]  historic moment on this Wednesday afternoon. America is in a state of civil war between
[30:19.100 --> 30:24.020]  foreign globalist forces and forces loyal to our republic and our system. While you're
[30:24.020 --> 30:28.460]  really freaked out that you've seen Joe Biden announcing himself as the president elect
[30:28.460 --> 30:31.940]  and having the nerve to put up a big sign behind him saying and the whole media and
[30:31.940 --> 30:36.260]  even Fox News announcing it but under the law it's a fraud but that's what these scammers
[30:36.260 --> 30:39.980]  are trying to do because their past hoaxes have failed. But I've got some good news for
[30:39.980 --> 30:54.140]  you. Ladies and gentlemen the 46th president of the United States. That's right. Here we
[30:54.140 --> 31:00.780]  are ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's not Donald John Trump.
[31:00.780 --> 31:06.940]  He was a 40th president. God rest his name in the annals of history and it's not Joe
[31:06.940 --> 31:13.700]  Biden the Chinese communist globalist agent. No. All you've got to do is be a media outlet
[31:13.700 --> 31:19.260]  and then announce that you are allowed to announce the winner and that no one else is
[31:19.260 --> 31:25.340]  and then you just announce whoever you want is the president elect and so you just have
[31:25.340 --> 31:30.860]  a dark blue background with a presidential seal on it and some white font and you are
[31:30.860 --> 31:36.940]  the president elect 46th president of the United States Alexander Emmerich Jones of Texas.
[31:36.940 --> 31:44.180]  There it is. I've got a graphic office of the president elect Alex Jones. I never thought
[31:44.180 --> 31:48.460]  growing up I'd be the 46th president of the United States but I've got a media outlet
[31:48.460 --> 31:53.420]  and I'm on air and that's all you got to have. I mean big tech told us a month ago they said
[31:53.420 --> 32:00.140]  listen only seven groups are allowed to announce the winner. AP Fox News, ABC CBS NBC and this
[32:00.140 --> 32:06.300]  other consortium group and yeah those groups have called Alaska and they've called North
[32:06.300 --> 32:09.260]  Carolina for the president because he actually won those states but that's not going to be
[32:09.260 --> 32:13.140]  on the news. It's not going to be on the news that the recount in Arizona and other places
[32:13.140 --> 32:17.740]  that Trump's narrowed the lead and statistically is going to win and they haven't even started
[32:17.740 --> 32:20.860]  investigating the fraud yet. I mean they already caught them in the fraud but they haven't
[32:20.860 --> 32:26.300]  been able to get in to the full group of ballots in Pennsylvania and other places so quite a
[32:26.300 --> 32:34.740]  world suddenly on CNN, suddenly on CNN all these states are back in play but I was told
[32:34.740 --> 32:40.780]  last Wednesday, Thursday and Friday that Nevada was going to Biden and Arizona was going to
[32:40.780 --> 32:47.420]  Biden and Colorado was going to Biden and I was told all these states were going to Biden
[32:47.420 --> 32:51.980]  but now because Trump's actually demanding all the votes be counted and now because the
[32:51.980 --> 32:55.620]  votes are showing it's going the other way wow something's happening they don't like
[32:55.620 --> 32:59.460]  so what are they going to do again where they said he will go to jail he is a Russian agent
[32:59.460 --> 33:04.860]  we have the proof it's coming out 100% every media channel said it wasn't true every media
[33:04.860 --> 33:09.700]  channel said he couldn't get the growth rate up to 3% impossible got up to 3.8 every media
[33:09.700 --> 33:14.220]  channel said that he wasn't going to be elected president but he was and then in the states
[33:14.220 --> 33:19.060]  he won he won by bigger margins and the states that he lost they closed the polls they say
[33:19.060 --> 33:27.340]  he lost and then suddenly the graphs went straight up which all the statisticians that
[33:27.340 --> 33:32.780]  are coming out admitting is classic fraud when you see an organic curve and then a perfect
[33:32.780 --> 33:37.340]  straight line going up they're being very very lazy how they did this and so here's
[33:37.340 --> 33:41.980]  what's currently happening and take it from me Alex Jones well I guess the president
[33:41.980 --> 33:48.420]  now president elect I've got to be very formal Alexander Emmerich Jones now that Alexander
[33:48.420 --> 33:56.940]  Emmerich Jones or Alexander E. Jones is now your 46th president now that I'm going to
[33:56.940 --> 34:01.140]  call world leaders we're beginning the transition again I have a graphic because I have a media
[34:01.140 --> 34:06.340]  institution I have info wars most of the time it has more viewers than CNN so if just having
[34:06.340 --> 34:11.780]  viewers means you're credible that info wars is able because even mainstream news admits
[34:11.780 --> 34:15.300]  we have a bigger audience than CNN a lot of the time depending on what we're covering
[34:15.300 --> 34:23.340]  that then I am the president I am the president I am the president I am the 46th president
[34:23.340 --> 34:28.820]  hell they tell us now and Bill and I the science guy that the chromosomes aren't for males
[34:28.820 --> 34:33.380]  and females that there's more chromosomes it's not true but media said so maybe Bill
[34:33.380 --> 34:37.780]  and I science guy'll say he's the president because you know he's got a he's got a popular
[34:37.780 --> 34:41.820]  show millions of viewers so Bill and I the science guys the president hell you're the
[34:41.820 --> 34:47.300]  president but you got to have a big media outlet and you can declare any body you want
[34:47.300 --> 34:52.900]  there they are associated press they are cheering me let's get some audio here they're cheering
[34:52.900 --> 34:59.420]  outside the White House Alexander Emmerich Jones 46th president to replace Donald John
[34:59.420 --> 35:08.660]  Trump so let's get serious ladies and gentlemen I am not the president elect you don't have
[35:08.660 --> 35:13.660]  CNN or info wars or ABC news or anybody announced for the president elect is unless someone's
[35:13.660 --> 35:20.380]  conceded until it's been certified by the states and then once it's certified by the
[35:20.380 --> 35:26.940]  states then the electors move forward and you see the president on January 6th the electors
[35:26.940 --> 35:32.060]  meet and they decide to be faithful and go with who the president is it's been elected
[35:32.060 --> 35:36.140]  whether it be the incumbent or not and then on January 20th you have the inauguration
[35:36.140 --> 35:40.300]  and they're sworn in in that ceremony that's how this works everybody knows that at least
[35:40.300 --> 35:46.100]  they're paying attention but you're told and I'm told we're bad if we don't just believe
[35:46.100 --> 35:53.020]  CNN when they tell us that well look I mean guys pull it up just just type in Joe Biden
[35:53.020 --> 36:01.900]  launches of office of the president elect and it's videos of him standing up there standing
[36:01.900 --> 36:09.740]  up there with a blue background saying he is the new president elect always got selected
[36:09.740 --> 36:15.540]  he's got he's got the shield he's got the symbol and now he's going to brief you on
[36:15.540 --> 36:19.740]  COVID-19 oh and all you Democrats thought the lockdown went in you know you all kind
[36:19.740 --> 36:23.740]  of played along it was hysteria it was to hurt the economy it was to make Americans miserable
[36:23.740 --> 36:28.580]  it was a strike it was a program it was siege and now you're learning you're not essential
[36:28.580 --> 36:32.740]  forever you're never getting your job back but don't worry there's a guaranteed universal
[36:32.740 --> 36:38.500]  income you'll own nothing you'll have nothing and you'll live in a 250 square foot apartment
[36:38.500 --> 36:44.620]  with a roommate that is the wonderful announcement but here's the problem the best laid plans
[36:44.620 --> 36:50.060]  of mice and men often go astray is a great literary master once said I'm going to plagiarize
[36:50.060 --> 36:54.460]  it like Joe Biden would and things aren't going the way they want because Trump just
[36:54.460 --> 36:58.860]  won North Carolina though you won't see that on the news he just won Alaska and everywhere
[36:58.860 --> 37:04.860]  there's a recount he's gaining votes and they're beginning to now engage in the criminal investigation
[37:04.860 --> 37:09.540]  and the attorney general was open to criminal investigation and they've just fired the global
[37:09.540 --> 37:14.420]  secretary of defense they wanted to teach her by that America sucks and white people are bad
[37:14.420 --> 37:18.380]  they've just fired the director of the CIA that ran all the torture and was obviously
[37:18.380 --> 37:24.140]  involved trying to hack this election and Trump is on a berserker spree finally taking
[37:24.140 --> 37:30.660]  the gloves off with 70 days already nine days of hell are over there's 70 days left in the
[37:30.660 --> 37:37.340]  70 days of hell who told you that was coming because one way or the other the enemy was
[37:37.340 --> 37:41.380]  going to steal it and Trump was going to contest it or Trump was going to win it and they wouldn't
[37:41.380 --> 37:45.780]  grab it up front and they would contest it later because they told us and that's the
[37:45.780 --> 37:50.340]  big secret if you actually watch the Clinton global initiative you actually read what these
[37:50.340 --> 37:55.780]  monsters are saying they tell you everything their criminal butts are going to do now we
[37:55.780 --> 38:00.780]  have Ivan Reagan coming on he's a former green beret officer the military constitutional
[38:00.780 --> 38:05.980]  lawyer has worked with general Flynn I'll just leave it at that and of course the new secretary
[38:05.980 --> 38:10.820]  of defense but Ivan's a civilian now and he's going to come on as a lawyer constitutional
[38:10.820 --> 38:17.220]  lawyer with a map that's the war-gamed map but the Pentagon and Trump are looking at
[38:17.220 --> 38:21.020]  we'll just leave it at that but you're gonna get to see this map and we're gonna have it
[38:21.020 --> 38:26.060]  on screen for you we're gonna spend an hour getting into the real numbers and not just
[38:26.060 --> 38:31.340]  a passive victory but a bigger electoral win than Trump got last time a total repudiation
[38:31.340 --> 38:36.140]  of Russiagate the corporate media all their lies all their fraud everything and that's
[38:36.140 --> 38:40.860]  why they quadrupled down with this fraud and had bet the farm and are just saying everywhere
[38:40.860 --> 38:44.700]  he is the president he is the president Joe Biden Joe Biden Joe Biden Joe Biden Joe Biden
[38:44.700 --> 38:48.420]  Joe Biden Joe Biden president like president like president like president like president
[38:48.420 --> 38:54.380]  like president like because they'd already printed up all the effect go pull it off the
[38:54.380 --> 39:00.100]  wall for me again they already printed up last election general election Hillary's madam
[39:00.100 --> 39:06.060]  president I mean the media said so then Newsweek called it for Hillary that means she's the
[39:06.060 --> 39:12.620]  president if the media calls it it means you guys just search madam president Newsweek
[39:12.620 --> 39:17.940]  cover it means that she actually is the president because the media called it think of the power
[39:17.940 --> 39:23.460]  grab of the corporate media saying that the states don't matter that the state attorney
[39:23.460 --> 39:27.900]  generals don't matter that the state of election systems don't matter that the courts don't
[39:27.900 --> 39:32.820]  matter that no madam president Newsweek said Hillary Clinton's historic journey to the
[39:32.820 --> 39:38.580]  White House I guess it's the first lady no it was as president a cheese our president
[39:38.580 --> 39:47.020]  in that alternate dimension this is gonna get crazy though because the establishment
[39:47.020 --> 39:50.180]  was allowed to run all these other hoaxes so now they've run the mother of all hoaxes
[39:50.180 --> 39:58.620]  stay with us
[39:58.620 --> 40:03.060]  in the game and no one has had more skin in the game than our president and he needs
[40:03.060 --> 40:08.180]  our prayers he needs our support he is the president secretary of state Pompeo understands
[40:08.180 --> 40:13.300]  that's why I said yesterday there will be a smooth transition from this Trump administration
[40:13.300 --> 40:18.980]  into the next administration because in all the major states where they're still counting
[40:18.980 --> 40:23.580]  they are gaining ground that is president trump republican party the american people
[40:23.580 --> 40:28.900]  the populace the patriots the enemy the democrats backed by the shy comms backed by the european
[40:28.900 --> 40:32.980]  union backed by hollywood backed by the left the blue cities the blue states they are in
[40:32.980 --> 40:38.300]  a rage trying to gaslight us keep calling by the president elect he's not president has
[40:38.300 --> 40:43.300]  to concede and or all of the states have to certify the vote which hasn't happened yet
[40:43.300 --> 40:47.820]  and then you have to have the electors seek who is going to be the president and this
[40:47.820 --> 40:51.300]  may be a dispute that goes back to the states that's why it's in the constitution and the
[40:51.300 --> 40:56.820]  constitution is kicking in throughout history there have been two basic forms of civilizations
[40:56.820 --> 41:01.980]  and different mixes of the two one is born of remissance the other is born of conquest
[41:01.980 --> 41:07.820]  one bases its power on having strong enlightened focused people with an ethos and a culture
[41:07.820 --> 41:13.780]  and ingenuity art and skill and strength the other is based on the massive number of slaves
[41:13.780 --> 41:20.660]  it controls with a tiny elite above it america is transferring out of a system based on the
[41:20.660 --> 41:26.540]  ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high tech slavery that's why the globalists
[41:26.540 --> 41:30.940]  tell us america was founded on slavery when it wasn't they point out one of our evils
[41:30.940 --> 41:34.940]  so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters a global permanent
[41:34.940 --> 41:39.420]  lockdown is here is already causing millions and millions of starved to death when they're
[41:39.420 --> 41:43.900]  done billions of starved death even the former head of the ministry of defense in england
[41:43.900 --> 41:48.260]  and a top general have come out and said the covered lockdown is going to trigger a giant
[41:48.260 --> 41:55.100]  new world war that's the fact this is the bill gates new world order weapon two info wars

[44:21.900 --> 44:31.420]  war i never come to you it's also i never come to you with anything but that isn't what
[44:31.420 --> 44:37.980]  i really truthfully believe is what's happening and trump won this election the landslide
[44:37.980 --> 44:42.300]  but they tried to steal it and now the evidence is mounting the frauds pouring in and the corporate
[44:42.300 --> 44:46.700]  media that signed off the chai comms and their anti-american activities who want to break
[44:46.700 --> 44:50.820]  this country in a permanent coveted lockdown like what the soviets did for 10 years to bring
[44:50.820 --> 44:59.860]  their people under control in 1917 they're in full panic mode they had all these whistleblowers
[44:59.860 --> 45:09.300]  come out from the usps about post dating ballots after the election saying that they were from
[45:09.300 --> 45:14.660]  before the election my brother-in-law who i wouldn't even say his right wing or left wing
[45:14.660 --> 45:19.780]  he's more pragmatic he was fighting mad the day after the election watching somebody postmarked
[45:19.780 --> 45:28.580]  50 of them or so working with the post office and he said i didn't want to violate federal
[45:28.580 --> 45:31.940]  law and videotape somebody in a polling place it is illegal to videotape that see they use
[45:31.940 --> 45:35.300]  that against us i would have done it because there's a whistleblower protection but i'm
[45:35.300 --> 45:41.140]  not i'm not i'm not knocking alex raveira he's a great guy but he was just flabbergasted
[45:41.140 --> 45:48.780]  he's a smart guy he's a chemist he was sitting there watching it happen that's my family
[45:48.780 --> 45:54.180]  saw that i have stacks of articles i didn't get to yesterday or today of just total proof
[45:54.180 --> 45:58.580]  video of the fraud people admitting it the georgia head of elections admitting their they caught a
[45:58.580 --> 46:04.420]  bunch of fraud and it's all for joe biden of course it is because it's christians and it's
[46:04.420 --> 46:10.900]  conservatives we don't break the rules until a tyranny takes over and then we start breaking
[46:10.900 --> 46:15.620]  a lot more than the rules well i don't want to go down that path i want to turn this country
[46:15.620 --> 46:19.140]  around but let me drop some bombshell when i say bombshell info on you right now
[46:19.140 --> 46:27.220]  again have you seen an end to seeing in any of these channels you're not hearing any of this
[46:27.220 --> 46:33.700]  but it slipped out on mbc last night that trump had just won
[46:38.100 --> 46:38.980]  north carolina
[46:41.300 --> 46:45.860]  and the fact that they showed it they said o f and then cut away
[46:45.860 --> 46:50.180]  away viewers of msnbc were caught off guard when
[46:52.900 --> 46:58.660]  one of their hosts did not respond to a question from host craig melvin and instead appeared to
[46:58.660 --> 47:04.900]  look down at his phone several times and become very visibly alarmed the camera quickly cut away
[47:06.180 --> 47:12.740]  from dilliana and back to melvin who was caught on a momentary loss for words before saying okay
[47:12.740 --> 47:18.420]  we've had to bleep it out but you understand we can show you the cnn maps from 24 hours ago
[47:19.300 --> 47:28.020]  that had biden at 270 and what trump at 214 or whatever and now magically they played this game
[47:28.020 --> 47:34.020]  saying okay you want to play this game all these states that were for trump we're going to say
[47:34.020 --> 47:37.380]  are in contention too because now we are going to count the votes like we promised we do so now
[47:37.380 --> 47:45.940]  they've got trump at 125 and biden at 203 how is that 210 now on the table we were told it was
[47:45.940 --> 47:53.060]  over no matter what why it's the office of the president elect oh remember that just because
[47:53.060 --> 47:57.380]  newsweek printed up a quarter million copies of this four years ago and had them on newsstands
[47:57.380 --> 48:01.780]  the day after the election hillary won the election did you know that because a media outlet said so
[48:01.780 --> 48:09.700]  not the voters not the certification of the boat by the state attorney generals and others
[48:10.260 --> 48:16.500]  no no no no the media said hillary was the one to remember so she is but we all knew that was a
[48:16.500 --> 48:23.540]  lie and so they've done it again in a mammoth hoax but they have quadrillion down not quadrupled
[48:23.540 --> 48:30.100]  down quadrillion fox news radio cnn everything is president elect president elect president elect
[48:30.100 --> 48:33.460]  president elect trump's a resident agent trump's a resident agent trump's a resident agent
[48:35.300 --> 48:41.700]  on and on and on and on and on and on so here's what happened on msnbc
[48:44.980 --> 48:50.500]  kindalini has some new reporting on something that we talked about at the top of the hour
[48:50.500 --> 48:56.100]  how the trump administration is handling the transition with the incoming biden team or
[48:56.100 --> 49:02.100]  or not handling it we should say to a certain extent this time it involves our intelligence
[49:02.100 --> 49:18.340]  community uh ken what have you learned sir okay that's when they flipped it all back
[49:18.980 --> 49:24.980]  and that's what they call crap and bricks right there but notice you're not hearing he just won
[49:24.980 --> 49:28.580]  north carolina you're not hearing he's winning the recounts you're not hearing you just won alaska
[49:31.700 --> 49:37.780]  because these people are sitting up there saying how dare him not transition how dare
[49:37.780 --> 49:44.660]  him not hand the keys to joe biden when we've got them on the run and this is a big article
[49:44.660 --> 49:48.900]  somebody hadn't written the article yet cnn and all of them now change the numbers where it's not
[49:48.900 --> 49:55.620]  joe biden at 270 put that back on screen this is so insane for radio listeners all describe it cnn
[49:56.340 --> 50:02.900]  decision desk hq all these biden 203 trump 125 but see they still set up to make trump
[50:02.900 --> 50:07.300]  like the loser now they'll try to steal those elections or block the recount zone and now
[50:07.300 --> 50:14.180]  they're saying oh texas isn't counted now we know why my brother-in-law the day after the election on
[50:14.180 --> 50:20.820]  wednesday saw a fellow with 50 ballots with his name on it being accepted and postmarked by the
[50:20.820 --> 50:27.460]  post office and again we've been a big article yesterday about california where a woman that
[50:27.460 --> 50:34.980]  lives in texas her mother where she used to live with got a letter from the government saying okay
[50:34.980 --> 50:41.380]  you voted for joe biden thanks for voting she went check the secretary of state's office uh in the
[50:41.380 --> 50:46.180]  state and saw that she voted for biden you know she voted for trump here in texas people like well
[50:46.180 --> 50:51.060]  why do you care they already have california they got it because of fraud it's not really blue
[50:51.620 --> 50:56.580]  everybody's not leaving for no reason it's taken over democrats bring an election fraud like nobody
[50:56.580 --> 51:04.260]  else that's why they're so hard to beat it's like cancer people always think one dimensionally well
[51:04.260 --> 51:08.500]  why do you care they already got california they got it from fraud and now they're gonna do it your
[51:08.500 --> 51:14.660]  town your state here's a Pompeo landed out secretary of state yesterday freaking the global stuff
[51:16.900 --> 51:20.420]  there will be a smooth transition to a second trump administration
[51:22.100 --> 51:27.460]  all right we're ready the world is watching what's taking place here we're gonna count all the votes
[51:27.460 --> 51:32.180]  when the process is complete there'll be a lector selected there's a process the constitution lays
[51:32.180 --> 51:36.980]  it out pretty clearly the world should have every confidence that the transition necessary to make
[51:36.980 --> 51:42.100]  sure that the state department is functional today successful today and successful with the president
[51:42.100 --> 51:48.500]  who's in office on january 20th a minute afternoon will also be successful i went through a transition

[51:56.580 --> 52:00.900]  continue to perform as national security function as we go forward so you believe there's widespread
[52:00.900 --> 52:06.100]  voter fraud that the reports that we're getting from pennsylvania from michigan showing vote totals
[52:06.100 --> 52:11.540]  and massive leads are significant leads with 99 percent reporting are going to be overturned

[52:58.260 --> 53:03.140]  fight is though at the legislature level that's really needs to override all this and make sure
[53:03.140 --> 53:08.420]  that the fair election is executed because the enemy could still win they are gaslighting people
[53:08.420 --> 53:13.380]  to the next level here that reporter why are you saying we didn't have a fraud free election

[54:49.940 --> 54:55.620]  major platforms i warned everybody that was a precedent for the upcoming presidential election
[54:55.620 --> 55:01.540]  and that they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship until effectively
[55:01.540 --> 55:06.820]  there was a total internet kill switch in place against conservatives nationals and populace
[55:06.820 --> 55:11.300]  and now that's happened and then i told everybody that they would then start moving to arrest
[55:11.300 --> 55:17.540]  individuals that demonstrate in protest using a second covid 19 lockdown and that prompt me to
[55:17.540 --> 55:23.140]  get out front and fully repudiate covid 19 is basically an overblown hoax he started to do that
[55:23.140 --> 55:28.020]  in the last few months of the campaign but we have to understand that that's the pincer attack
[55:28.020 --> 55:32.660]  they're going to use they're going to use black lives matter and race war to stir up the american
[55:32.660 --> 55:36.260]  people and divide us and they're going to use economic warfare shutting down the economy
[55:36.260 --> 55:41.700]  to try to control us i hope people will listen now to my warnings because i'm on air telling people
[55:41.700 --> 55:48.260]  what's coming next i get asked all the time by listeners and by the media what am i most proud
[55:48.260 --> 55:53.300]  of when it comes to show and it's the fact that info wars more than 25 years ago doing basic
[55:53.300 --> 55:58.500]  research with what the club of rome and the cfr and others were actually saying developed the
[55:58.500 --> 56:03.940]  hypothesis that communist china had been set up to take our jobs and transform to china and then
[56:03.940 --> 56:08.980]  make us economically destitute and position us into debt well now china owns the debt now china
[56:08.980 --> 56:14.500]  owns hollywood all the one side of trading deals it turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on
[56:14.500 --> 56:20.820]  but again it wasn't that hard the cfr and others admitted what they were doing but still others
[56:20.820 --> 56:26.740]  didn't want to focus on that issue we did and you focused on it by supporting us at info wars
[56:26.740 --> 56:31.300]  so when you go to info wars store dot com and get all the great supplements books t-shirts films

[57:16.900 --> 57:23.380]  coming up but america's hard to kill as von bismarck said god loves children drunks the united
[57:23.380 --> 57:31.220]  states of america here's greg rees's report we'll be back hindsight is 2020 and the enemy is very
[57:31.220 --> 57:37.060]  cunning but now that they have launched their coup against president donald j trump we can see
[57:37.060 --> 57:42.740]  their battle plans he got four years in the white house and they weren't going to give him a second
[57:42.740 --> 57:52.580]  term plans for 2020 began immediately following the 2016 election nine days before trump's inauguration
[57:52.580 --> 57:58.180]  fauci says there is no doubt that president trump will be confronted with a surprise infectious
[57:58.180 --> 58:04.980]  disease two days after the president's inauguration bill gate spoke at davos and warned of a coming
[58:04.980 --> 58:11.540]  deadly pandemic an illegal surveillance operation was already launched before the election and the
[58:11.540 --> 58:18.100]  president was then subjected to four years of non-stop baseless attacks and defamation keeping
[58:18.100 --> 58:24.500]  trump on the constant defense and the american people distracted while the deep state establishment
[58:24.500 --> 58:30.660]  prepared for the 2020 election the covet hoax was in the works years before the election of
[58:30.660 --> 58:38.740]  donald trump but they started fast tracking it in 2017 dr fauci began the controversial program
[58:38.740 --> 58:44.980]  of manipulating a virus to become more infectious to humans this is known as gain of function
[58:44.980 --> 58:53.540]  research in 2018 several cia agents are elected into public office claiming their new mission
[58:53.540 --> 59:01.620]  is to foil trump in 2019 fauci committed 3.7 million dollars to the wuhan lab in china
[59:01.620 --> 59:08.980]  for gain of function work on bat coronaviruses in 2019 dominion voting machines funded by the
[59:08.980 --> 59:17.060]  clinton foundation expanded their 1600 jurisdictions into the state of georgia in october of 2019
[59:17.060 --> 59:24.900]  the gates foundation the world economic forum and john's hopkins sponsored event 201 a tabletop
[59:24.900 --> 59:32.180]  exercise that simulated millions dying from a strain of coronavirus two months later china reports
[59:32.180 --> 59:40.820]  an outbreak of pneumonia in wuhan march 13 2020 the us shuts down for covid thousands of people
[59:40.820 --> 59:48.500]  lose their jobs overnight we are told that masks don't work and yet we are told that we must wear

[59:56.100 --> 1:00:03.940]  coronavirus and suggest mail-in ballots among other changes to the election the media tries to
[1:00:03.940 --> 1:00:11.300]  blame trump fear is injected into the brainwashed masses over an alleged virus less deadly than
[1:00:11.300 --> 1:00:18.900]  the common cold on may 25th soros funded violent protests erupt throughout the country for the
[1:00:18.900 --> 1:00:24.900]  rest of the summer cities burn businesses are looted and people are murdered in the streets
[1:00:25.940 --> 1:00:32.660]  the entire platform of the democrat party becomes if you want the chaos to end vote for joe biden
[1:00:33.540 --> 1:00:39.860]  in september of 2020 the mockingbird media began reporting that trump will refuse to leave the
[1:00:39.860 --> 1:00:46.580]  white house when he is beaten in november on election night just as the president begins to
[1:00:46.580 --> 1:00:53.780]  surge in critical states the election is inexplicably halted thousands of mail-in ballots appear in
[1:00:53.780 --> 1:01:01.140]  the middle of the night all for joe biden while completely ignoring massive evidence of voter
[1:01:01.140 --> 1:01:08.740]  fraud the mainstream media prematurely calls victory for joe biden and now agents of the deep
[1:01:08.740 --> 1:01:14.900]  state are decloaking themselves calling for the president to concede and give full power back to
[1:01:14.900 --> 1:01:21.780]  the crooked establishment if the president concedes the trump family will be forever destroyed
[1:01:21.780 --> 1:01:29.460]  and america will fall into chaos the only route to victory is to win the election in the courts
[1:01:29.460 --> 1:01:34.820]  and go on a massive offensive against the deep state establishment and the mockingbird media
[1:01:34.820 --> 1:01:42.580]  those attempting to overthrow the united states need to be executed the battle is just beginning

[1:03:45.300 --> 1:03:53.380]  oh john brennan obama hillary all these globalists scum that's sold out america that parlayed our
[1:03:53.380 --> 1:03:57.780]  wealth in china they're trying to remove our elected president they've been caught red-handed
[1:03:58.580 --> 1:04:04.100]  clearly north carolina alaska are being called for trump now suddenly cnn's changed the whole map
[1:04:05.140 --> 1:04:12.180]  showing hundreds of of the electoral votes in play but we're told it's all sewn up i mean
[1:04:12.180 --> 1:04:18.980]  joe had 270 it's all over let's put that cnn back on screen well ivan rakeland is a former green
[1:04:18.980 --> 1:04:25.300]  beret constitutional lawyer uh is the general counsel a lot of great online organizations
[1:04:25.300 --> 1:04:31.700]  like duck dot go and yippie dot com he's on twitter at rakeland r a i k l i n one of the
[1:04:31.700 --> 1:04:36.500]  few people i guess still on there but it's been taken down and he's here with us he works with
[1:04:36.500 --> 1:04:44.420]  general flin and we're seeing major removals of the cia director of the defense department head
[1:04:44.420 --> 1:04:50.980]  director the defense department major things are happening and are afoot and so america's
[1:04:50.980 --> 1:04:54.340]  fighting back but the corporate media bought and paid for the globalists is announcing that
[1:04:54.340 --> 1:05:00.100]  it's president elect biden well i could announce that i'm president elect biden or i'm president
[1:05:00.100 --> 1:05:04.180]  elect alec show it's like i did last hour as a joke hell newsweek announced her president elect
[1:05:04.180 --> 1:05:09.220]  elect last year the day after the election talk about getting caught with your pants down jump
[1:05:09.220 --> 1:05:13.860]  with the gun there a little bit so if a mainstream media announces that though it must be they are
[1:05:13.860 --> 1:05:18.340]  really really desperate i want to get into an amazing map he's put together as a lawyer
[1:05:18.340 --> 1:05:22.100]  and i've checked this with a lot of other experts they say it's it's amazing that has trump winning
[1:05:22.100 --> 1:05:27.460]  by more than he won last time but he's got to get the right lawyers involved he's got to do the right
[1:05:27.460 --> 1:05:32.740]  moves or they could steal it that's why they're harassing any of the law firms representing
[1:05:32.740 --> 1:05:37.700]  even the republican party of pennsylvania and and just you try to quote count every vote so
[1:05:38.660 --> 1:05:44.100]  next segment we'll get into all of this with ivan and and he'll have the floor for much the hour
[1:05:44.100 --> 1:05:48.420]  going through the actual nuts and bolts so others can see this understand this and get a real
[1:05:48.420 --> 1:05:52.660]  path to victory but i wanted to play speaking of somebody i think they're a dictator part of this
[1:05:52.660 --> 1:05:58.820]  plutocracy or this oligarchy of bureaucrats that just you know presidents come and go congress
[1:05:58.820 --> 1:06:03.700]  people come and go but they stay here's brennan who voted communist twice a well hobbyist
[1:06:04.260 --> 1:06:07.300]  the spy on the president illegally tried to overthrow the last election as well
[1:06:07.940 --> 1:06:13.460]  here he is saying a palace coup is needed against trump because he's so dangerous well yeah because
[1:06:13.460 --> 1:06:18.340]  he's dangerous because he's a defender of the republic against enemies like you here it is well
[1:06:18.340 --> 1:06:24.260]  if last president pennson the cabinet had an ounce of fortitude and spying and patriotism i think they
[1:06:24.260 --> 1:06:30.020]  would seriously consider invoking the 25th amendment um and you know pushing donald trump out because
[1:06:30.020 --> 1:06:36.580]  he is just very unpredictable now he's like a cornered cat tiger and he is going to lash out
[1:06:36.580 --> 1:06:42.020]  and the fact that again that he has the powers of the presidency in his hands is quite worrisome
[1:06:42.020 --> 1:06:47.060]  now we we know that the attorney general bar has done donald trump's bidding in the past will he
[1:06:47.060 --> 1:06:52.820]  continue to do that vis-à-vis this election i don't know but i do think it's something that
[1:06:52.820 --> 1:06:57.300]  the members of congress the leadership of the republican party really needs to send clear
[1:06:57.300 --> 1:07:03.220]  signals to donald trump that if he goes continues to go along this path they are going to put up
[1:07:03.220 --> 1:07:08.740]  roadblocks what do you make of the attorney general saying that his investigators before
[1:07:08.740 --> 1:07:13.860]  the electoral college will look at substantial allegations of voting irregularities as you
[1:07:13.860 --> 1:07:19.060]  and i both know irregularities is not a legal standard or any kind of criminal rubric but
[1:07:19.060 --> 1:07:24.820]  what do you make of that well i think it's an unprecedented move and again since william bar
[1:07:24.820 --> 1:07:29.220]  has shown that he is willing to be donald trump's personal defense lawyer as opposed to the attorney
[1:07:29.220 --> 1:07:34.340]  general united states i am concerned that he's going to be looking at this in a very one-sided
[1:07:34.340 --> 1:07:39.620]  manner and so i think this is something that's hopefully the the state attorney generals and
[1:07:39.620 --> 1:07:46.420]  others are going to stand fast and also the department of justice professional um professionals
[1:07:46.420 --> 1:07:51.220]  are going to carry out their duties irrespective of whatever type of political wins they feel
[1:07:51.220 --> 1:07:55.700]  are blowing their way john brennan thank you very much for your perspective appreciate it love to
[1:07:55.700 --> 1:08:00.340]  have you back when we see what happens next that is one of the main enemies of this country is
[1:08:00.340 --> 1:08:03.860]  john brennan he literally doesn't believe we should exist here's what pompeo had to say
[1:08:03.860 --> 1:08:07.780]  yesterday briefly about we're gonna have a smooth transition to trump and again you can show the
[1:08:07.780 --> 1:08:14.820]  cnn screen they suddenly flip back to tuesday i mean whoa big stuff's going down man big stuff
[1:08:14.820 --> 1:08:21.540]  here's uh what the secretary of state had to say there will be a smooth transition to a second

[1:08:33.140 --> 1:08:37.620]  the constitution lays it out pretty clearly the world should have every confidence that the
[1:08:37.620 --> 1:08:42.500]  transition necessary to make sure that the state department is functional today successful today
[1:08:42.500 --> 1:08:47.940]  and successful with the president who's in office on january 20th a minute afternoon

[1:08:52.100 --> 1:08:57.140]  now for the rest of the hour let's spend a few minutes here big picture i mean uh trump is moving
[1:08:57.140 --> 1:09:01.620]  general flin's people back in big time new secretary defense you know guys from the defense
[1:09:01.620 --> 1:09:07.860]  intelligence agency uh folks out of florida patriots this is a historic moment how would you
[1:09:07.860 --> 1:09:12.820]  quantify for people just in a three minute four minute gestalt about where we are historically
[1:09:14.180 --> 1:09:18.580]  i think it's an absolutely brilliant move so i'll discuss later how the path of victory
[1:09:18.580 --> 1:09:22.980]  occurred so we know that there's a path to victory and it's very simple at knowing that
[1:09:22.980 --> 1:09:28.180]  but the corporate media does not know that what president trump can do is change the personnel
[1:09:28.180 --> 1:09:32.740]  that he wanted to change over the last four years that wasn't able to because of the political
[1:09:32.740 --> 1:09:38.260]  circumstances now he's in a position to while while the the hyperventilating media is focused
[1:09:38.260 --> 1:09:44.100]  on coordinating the former vice president he can make all of those moves over the next
[1:09:44.100 --> 1:09:49.780]  until january basically 20th and then onward so he's already doing it we saw the secretary
[1:09:49.780 --> 1:09:56.900]  defense uh mark despert gone uh you should expect to see some some other folks that your viewers
[1:09:56.900 --> 1:10:01.780]  know their names uh hopefully the next few days i don't know when that timeline's going to be but
[1:10:01.780 --> 1:10:07.940]  i'm guessing it's going to be very soon and that's about it i mean in terms of there are going to be
[1:10:07.940 --> 1:10:13.300]  people that are on board with the agenda of making america great again and following the
[1:10:13.300 --> 1:10:18.980]  constitution a couple things i want to say though uh just to correct you when you open up the
[1:10:18.980 --> 1:10:23.860]  segment i'm no longer with yippie that's one but then the other pieces i don't listen to that's just
[1:10:23.860 --> 1:10:28.660]  the bio they gave me it doesn't matter so we'll do your bio when we come back to the other side
[1:10:28.660 --> 1:10:34.980]  but but but let's talk about this right now okay let's talk about the reality of of of of where the
[1:10:34.980 --> 1:10:41.780]  country is where the country is where the country right now would you historically call this point
[1:10:43.780 --> 1:10:47.700]  i mean there's there's there's about half the country or probably less at this point
[1:10:47.700 --> 1:10:52.980]  that is living in a fiction land la la land if i call it and then there's a growing number of folks
[1:10:52.980 --> 1:10:58.420]  that are trying to look into reality to determine what's actually going on and i think they're not
[1:10:58.420 --> 1:11:03.060]  able to because there are very few sources of information that project the realities on the
[1:11:03.060 --> 1:11:08.500]  ground based on the laws based on the constitution that's really why i came out to really do a really
[1:11:08.500 --> 1:11:14.500]  hard media press to push out what is actually the legal framework for electing a president
[1:11:14.500 --> 1:11:19.700]  no one's no one's doing that over at cnn uh john brend doesn't even know the constitution apparently
[1:11:19.700 --> 1:11:26.020]  based on what he what he just said uh same thing with uh quomo and then the rest of the folks and
[1:11:26.020 --> 1:11:32.420]  again i'll reiterate i do not listen to fox i do not listen to cnn i listen to the constitution
[1:11:32.420 --> 1:11:38.180]  i've sworn to take an oath to defend it multiple times and that's why the president's going to
[1:11:38.180 --> 1:11:45.620]  win because it's not only the popular vote that gets you the electors it's four components popular
[1:11:45.620 --> 1:11:51.860]  vote the state's legislature the governor of that state has a role as well as the other candidate
[1:11:51.860 --> 1:11:56.660]  on whether or not that they're going to test the race if you give me an opportunity i'll lay that out
[1:11:56.660 --> 1:12:02.580]  in the next segment absolutely so ivan rakeland's here with us constitutional lawyer give people
[1:12:02.580 --> 1:12:08.340]  because i got your old bio here your accurate bio in 30 seconds constitutional lawyer for
[1:12:08.340 --> 1:12:13.540]  for the purposes of this discussion all right so when we come back we're going to lay all this out
[1:12:13.540 --> 1:12:18.500]  with ivan i'm alex jones your host and we've got a map he's put together that's very very accurate
[1:12:18.500 --> 1:12:24.980]  and we've suddenly seen the map switch on cnn uh just insanely so a lot of crazy stuff is going down
[1:12:24.980 --> 1:12:29.780]  they're going to write about this for hundreds of years this is such a historic moment i i can
[1:12:29.780 --> 1:12:36.340]  normally handle stress i'm fried i mean the day after day of this this is such insane level stuff
[1:12:36.340 --> 1:12:41.220]  that i mean you you'll never see this for hundreds of years again this is the most this is this is
[1:12:41.220 --> 1:12:49.860]  going to govern the entire future coming up so tell everybody you know tune in right now
[1:12:49.860 --> 1:12:54.420]  look we all know that cnn is the epitome of fake news but there's a headline on their site today
[1:12:55.060 --> 1:13:01.060]  that says there are disinformation groups and organizations saying joe biden is not president
[1:13:01.060 --> 1:13:09.540]  elect well on its face he's not president elect because the votes have not been certified by any
[1:13:09.540 --> 1:13:15.620]  of the 50 states and counting is still going on what in seven of the states and trump is gaining
[1:13:15.620 --> 1:13:21.940]  ground in all but one of them and then there's also going to be recounts audits and all the
[1:13:21.940 --> 1:13:28.580]  spot checks have already shown nasa fraud but in comes the ace card the ace of spades big tech
[1:13:28.580 --> 1:13:33.780]  censorship is blocking not just the president not just members of congress but tens of millions of
[1:13:33.780 --> 1:13:40.260]  americans from even sharing local news stations confirming the fraud this is a far and back multinational
[1:13:40.260 --> 1:13:46.580]  takeover the united states trump is battling a chinese-backed new world order system fit on

[1:14:41.300 --> 1:15:03.380]  to infowarstore.com today you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:15:11.300 --> 1:15:21.380]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:15:22.980 --> 1:15:30.980]  live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones well ladies and gentlemen mainstream
[1:15:30.980 --> 1:15:37.860]  corporate media has been caught with their pants down they said on saturday that biden had won with
[1:15:37.860 --> 1:15:45.620]  270 the president trump's 214 with all these states still counting and with all the evidence of
[1:15:45.620 --> 1:15:50.260]  fraud coming out they said oh there's no fraud it doesn't exist and now suddenly today cnn and all
[1:15:50.260 --> 1:15:59.060]  the sites have flipped it back and they've got 200 plus electoral votes still on the board what in
[1:15:59.060 --> 1:16:08.260]  hades just happened but hiding in plain view they're telling you that he is president-elect
[1:16:08.260 --> 1:16:17.460]  meaning joe biden just like we were told that hillary clinton is president-elect four years ago
[1:16:18.740 --> 1:16:26.180]  on the cover of newsweek but it wasn't true it's all lies but if mainstream media says
[1:16:26.180 --> 1:16:32.580]  something it must be true that is the incredibly historic moment we're at having great skype
[1:16:32.580 --> 1:16:38.420]  problems with our guests no big deal and we'll get them on tomorrow the point is is that he's
[1:16:38.420 --> 1:16:47.540]  put a good map together iven rakeland constitutional lawyer patriot laying all of this out and how big
[1:16:48.420 --> 1:16:52.980]  this victory for trump's going to be bigger than four years ago and i believe we do have
[1:16:52.980 --> 1:16:58.580]  our guests here with us we'll work on a sound for a moment and get him up but this is a big deal
[1:16:59.140 --> 1:17:02.580]  and again you know as we were saying this five days ago we were saying it two days ago we're
[1:17:02.580 --> 1:17:06.820]  saying a day ago we were saying the numbers aren't right all these races are undecided
[1:17:06.820 --> 1:17:13.140]  the democrats said that they were going to keep all of this open no matter what all those had
[1:17:13.140 --> 1:17:17.460]  to be counted but suddenly they froze it when trump was winning and said no we can't do that
[1:17:17.460 --> 1:17:22.580]  so big picture this is an amazing time to be alive iven rakeland is a former green beret a
[1:17:22.580 --> 1:17:25.860]  patriot constitutional lawyer that works for general fling a lot of things but he's here
[1:17:25.860 --> 1:17:30.580]  today as a citizen his constitutional lawyers done an amazing amount of work looking at the
[1:17:30.580 --> 1:17:37.300]  numbers biden 233 is what he's predicting trump 305 but trump's got to make every move just right
[1:17:37.300 --> 1:17:41.060]  iven tell us about what's unfolding and let's start breaking this down thanks for joining us
[1:17:41.940 --> 1:17:45.300]  now thanks for having me alex so let's take a look at the map you got it up
[1:17:45.300 --> 1:17:51.620]  yes sir we'll put it up i can talk folks through it so here we go the key thing to know about this
[1:17:51.620 --> 1:17:58.340]  the media is only using projections of the voters that is not what the constitution outlines
[1:17:58.340 --> 1:18:03.380]  there's four component there are four components to determining how the electors are going to
[1:18:03.380 --> 1:18:09.220]  be selected and how they will vote the first component is the popular vote in all states
[1:18:09.220 --> 1:18:14.260]  the second component the legislature of that particular state and then the governor has
[1:18:14.260 --> 1:18:20.740]  a role in it and lastly the other candidate if it is uncontested also has a role now if it's
[1:18:20.740 --> 1:18:25.940]  contested they have a they have a role and that's how i determine using this those four components
[1:18:25.940 --> 1:18:32.980]  and that's the law but cnn tells us if the media says so that's who the winner is and i i basically
[1:18:32.980 --> 1:18:38.820]  waited hillary one four years ago so is she president right exactly so you have four components
[1:18:38.820 --> 1:18:44.340]  each of them weighted criteria to determine the different coloring scheme from safe likely
[1:18:44.340 --> 1:18:49.940]  leans to tilt and on the left side you can you can get a further explanation of how i did my further
[1:18:54.500 --> 1:18:58.100]  and again you got to love skype ladies and gentlemen since microsoft bought it it just
[1:18:58.100 --> 1:19:04.740]  gets worse and worse and worse ivan was on though yesterday um with the war room and then
[1:19:04.740 --> 1:19:10.100]  on the election aftermath seven nine days of hell program uh that we have from seven
[1:19:11.780 --> 1:19:16.500]  to nine p.m. every night so so maybe we'll just fly ivan down here that'll be the best way to do
[1:19:16.500 --> 1:19:21.140]  this because i've learned to cut bait at a certain point and we will cut bait at this point and get
[1:19:21.140 --> 1:19:25.700]  ivan on the very near future uh let's let's go to band out video though there are two videos he
[1:19:25.700 --> 1:19:30.420]  did yesterday did a great job did have any problems laying all that out and he does it all here
[1:19:30.420 --> 1:19:33.460]  i'm gonna give the number out now we're done with the interview thank you uh i'm gonna give the
[1:19:33.460 --> 1:19:38.820]  number out here i want to take your phone calls we've taken calls in a few days specifically about
[1:19:38.820 --> 1:19:43.300]  what you think about what's happening this historic moment we're in when what's unfolding
[1:19:43.300 --> 1:19:47.940]  eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine two five
[1:19:47.940 --> 1:19:53.060]  three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine alex will open the phones up and you'll be able to

[1:19:57.060 --> 1:20:02.180]  quickly uh through your phone calls and then dr steve pacinic is going to be coming on he predicted
[1:20:02.180 --> 1:20:06.580]  the firing of the head of the cia the firing of the defense secretary a few weeks ago here on air
[1:20:07.300 --> 1:20:12.420]  he also said last week and it's got like almost five million views at at the band out video
[1:20:13.300 --> 1:20:17.700]  it's one of our biggest videos uh that that there's really secret water marks and it's a sting
[1:20:17.700 --> 1:20:22.660]  operation i think he credibly believes that i'm not saying he's 100 right i'm going to ask him
[1:20:22.660 --> 1:20:27.380]  about that uh here on air i certainly hope that's the case but what about the old fashioned sting
[1:20:27.380 --> 1:20:33.060]  of dead people voting or what about the old fashioned sting of these cia connected groups breaking
[1:20:33.060 --> 1:20:39.060]  in with operation scorecard and of course the southern operation um with this dominion software
[1:20:39.060 --> 1:20:44.180]  and the hammer so we're going to be talking about all of that coming up i mean i'll go to
[1:20:44.180 --> 1:20:46.820]  your calls they open the phone system up right now i'll just i'll just randomly take calls
[1:20:46.820 --> 1:20:49.620]  even though i don't even need their names i'll just boom just go to your call in there you know what

[1:20:54.260 --> 1:20:59.300]  alex i take a minute to get the computer system fired up but we're taking your phone calls in the
[1:20:59.300 --> 1:21:04.980]  middle of this historic moment we're in uh just just the level of the insanity is so crazy i can't
[1:21:04.980 --> 1:21:10.340]  even describe it obviously this is the real deal a globalist foreign attempt to take over the country
[1:21:10.340 --> 1:21:14.980]  and so much more in america waking up and fighting back and the media gaslighting us that give up
[1:21:14.980 --> 1:21:20.420]  give up the wars over uh trump lost when none of that's true i mean this is crazy but they were
[1:21:20.420 --> 1:21:24.980]  going to lose so what else are you going to expect we've already seen hoax after hoax after hoax
[1:21:24.980 --> 1:21:29.700]  what do you think trump should do next what's your view on all this i say pray and be very very
[1:21:29.700 --> 1:21:33.780]  visible and very very politically active against these bullies because if they're able to get biden
[1:21:33.780 --> 1:21:38.340]  in he's owned by the chai comms they're going to exploit and break this country up big time
[1:21:38.340 --> 1:21:42.820]  to bring down our dollar value and launch this new world order global currency for the davos group
[1:21:44.020 --> 1:21:48.740]  this is an important moment is world war one world war two this is so ultra massive just just pray

[1:23:44.660 --> 1:23:51.300]  globalist move in 2020 2020 2020. Remember Hillary Clinton remember Pelosi remember Bill Clinton remember
[1:23:51.300 --> 1:23:57.380]  Obama all of them said we are not going to concede if there's a red mirage we believe it's going to
[1:23:57.380 --> 1:24:01.940]  look like Trump's going to win a landslide because they have the internal polls and indeed Trump won
[1:24:02.580 --> 1:24:06.740]  most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin and when he was set to win the other
[1:24:06.740 --> 1:24:13.940]  ones they froze these seven states on election night and then they brought in all the reserve
[1:24:13.940 --> 1:24:18.020]  ballots they had this is completely transparent so when they say that he is president elect he's
[1:24:18.020 --> 1:24:22.100]  not Trump is not conceded none of the states have certified the vote and now all these
[1:24:22.100 --> 1:24:27.780]  investigations have been opened up and avalanches mountains oceans of election fraud has come out

[1:27:55.540 --> 1:28:00.340]  barely knew about it 10 years ago so even though we're in a fight of our lives and basically i'd
[1:28:00.340 --> 1:28:07.460]  say we're 50 50 in this battle right now on a nice edge a razor's edge look how far we've come and
[1:28:07.460 --> 1:28:11.460]  look how the globalists have been exposed as chinese globalist communist agents and the new
[1:28:11.460 --> 1:28:15.620]  old orders in trouble and ebb steam and the clintons are in trouble and all their different
[1:28:15.620 --> 1:28:19.780]  operatives are being fired and all hell's breaking loose amazing things are happening
[1:28:20.340 --> 1:28:25.140]  and i want to salute this crew as well you know it's easy to be a satanist and only have fun and

[1:28:34.340 --> 1:28:39.380]  cover but we don't turn away from the pain we turn into the pain because that's where we find victory
[1:28:39.380 --> 1:28:44.420]  is taking it on and not denying it but dealing with it so i want to thank the crew the incredible
[1:28:44.420 --> 1:28:50.580]  job they're doing and with ivan rakeland great constitutional lawyer a great guy he did two
[1:28:50.580 --> 1:28:54.980]  breakdowns on trump's path to victory and the real numbers very well researched that are banned

[1:29:22.660 --> 1:29:33.540]  you're on the air sir you know i sure do my friend hey uh so i had a t-shirt idea i thought i'd pitch
[1:29:33.540 --> 1:29:40.500]  to you i was thinking maybe a uh chega vera f that you know that you see all the students in the
[1:29:40.500 --> 1:29:46.900]  communist indoctrination uh compounds otherwise known as college um you know the black and white
[1:29:46.900 --> 1:29:51.700]  type t-shirt the re-education centers where they wear red shirts with chega varra maybe just have
[1:29:51.700 --> 1:29:57.700]  a skull wearing the shag hat and say uh communism kills or what's the idea well i was thinking maybe
[1:29:57.700 --> 1:30:04.180]  having a picture of your ugly mug up there with a bullhorn maybe something out of in game i hear
[1:30:04.180 --> 1:30:08.740]  you brother what do you think about this election next step for trump i think he needs to defeat the
[1:30:08.740 --> 1:30:16.020]  corporate media no i don't know let me ask each caller this where is trump i mean he's given two
[1:30:16.020 --> 1:30:20.740]  little speeches one election night the next day in the early morning on november fourth
[1:30:22.100 --> 1:30:25.620]  and then he gave one little thing about the poll i mean where the hell is the president
[1:30:25.620 --> 1:30:31.380]  uh all i can think is he's got to have some kind of a plan and that's all the face we all
[1:30:31.380 --> 1:30:36.100]  need to have i don't really know i know he's got a plan i mean he's kicking out all the globalist
[1:30:36.100 --> 1:30:41.300]  finally and taking action and challenging election fraud but man that's why i haven't rakeland's
[1:30:41.300 --> 1:30:45.300]  so important as a constitutional lawyer he's looked at the law and getting the legislatures
[1:30:45.300 --> 1:30:50.500]  involved now and getting us mobilized to push legislatures to step in and demand real investigations
[1:30:50.500 --> 1:30:55.220]  they have the power not the county clerks uh you know not even the bureaucrats it's got to be the
[1:30:55.220 --> 1:31:01.620]  legislatures i agree i think that we all just have to have faith and continue to mobilize the way
[1:31:01.620 --> 1:31:06.580]  that you're doing and keep up the good work and i'll listen to you every day i'm trying brother
[1:31:06.580 --> 1:31:12.580]  thank you ryan let's go ahead and talk to kevin in new york kevin you're on the air welcome
[1:31:13.700 --> 1:31:19.060]  like how are you good brother god bless man listen i just want to get it's not a deep dive
[1:31:19.060 --> 1:31:23.940]  analysis uh i was in new york city the day of the announcement of the joe biden fraud
[1:31:23.940 --> 1:31:27.300]  and uh my son and i were driving around with our trump hats kind of looking for
[1:31:27.300 --> 1:31:31.380]  fellow trump people that kind of like protest and we went in front of trump tower and you
[1:31:31.380 --> 1:31:36.660]  can even get near it it was like a block you know uh cordoned off and then we got surrounded by
[1:31:36.660 --> 1:31:41.780]  lunatics with the joe biden signs and the funny thing is none of them had real joe biden signs
[1:31:41.780 --> 1:31:47.060]  they're on cardboard boxes drawn on there you know uh but but then we turned the corner and
[1:31:47.060 --> 1:31:52.340]  they saw our trump hats and they literally and i'm talking about like 14 year old girls got out of
[1:31:52.340 --> 1:31:59.140]  their car started banging on our car yelling at us blasting the f trump song and uh if it's going
[1:31:59.140 --> 1:32:04.820]  in that direction god knows where it's going to go once they flip this well that's why the governor
[1:32:04.820 --> 1:32:09.540]  of florida has prepared basically troops and everything else to shoot looters i i agree with
[1:32:09.540 --> 1:32:13.780]  you sir it's totally insane we appreciate your courage being out there on the street you know
[1:32:13.780 --> 1:32:18.180]  they surrounded all the different trump towers in chicago in dc new york were threatened to burn
[1:32:18.180 --> 1:32:25.700]  them down and it's all young dumb trendies uh who just literally believe the chai comms in the new
[1:32:25.700 --> 1:32:30.340]  old order and joe biden cares about them it's so pathetic i appreciate your call kevin all right
[1:32:30.340 --> 1:32:34.740]  we're moving quick here let's go ahead and take another call let's talk to randy in oklahoma randy
[1:32:34.740 --> 1:32:43.540]  you're on the air alex yes sir we're ready to lock you into the end of the swamp brother
[1:32:43.540 --> 1:32:50.020]  can you hear me yeah i sure can man i'm sure can't hear you yep i hear every caller when you
[1:32:50.020 --> 1:32:57.060]  guys going i hear you all right all right listen one thing real quick for new and some of the
[1:32:57.060 --> 1:33:02.820]  newer listeners you know as a veteran listener for 10 years i'm also a marine corps that uh
[1:33:03.620 --> 1:33:10.100]  i've been tuning in and doing everything i can to take advantage of these products that are
[1:33:10.100 --> 1:33:16.980]  best research the best quality without there and it's a symbiotic relationship i hope people
[1:33:16.980 --> 1:33:24.020]  that are listening recognize or realize that the way we get this information going and circulating
[1:33:24.020 --> 1:33:28.820]  is because they stay healthy and they get the product they share the information with people
[1:33:29.380 --> 1:33:34.420]  and the operation is absolutely sir i mean we're we're nip and tuck stand on air but you know it's
[1:33:34.420 --> 1:33:38.660]  such a historic time we appreciate your support we love your randy and i really appreciate you
[1:33:38.660 --> 1:33:43.460]  what is your view on the vote count trump election and what's unfolding yeah the way it
[1:33:43.460 --> 1:33:48.900]  shakes out i i think that uh i'd like to see trough out there uh until they can actually launch
[1:33:48.900 --> 1:33:54.660]  i think it's like a 10 day window before they can they can uh take certain legal actions but it would
[1:33:54.660 --> 1:34:00.660]  be it'd be powerful to trough to throw the cards down on the table about just like it's been said
[1:34:00.660 --> 1:34:06.980]  with fracking and others that we've got to lay out the case for the fraud the virus you know the
[1:34:06.980 --> 1:34:13.060]  wuhan lab the way it was set up just put it out there for the public and let the media deal with it
[1:34:13.060 --> 1:34:18.180]  i think roge was on yesterday talking about that hey and in the worst case let's say it goes to the
[1:34:18.180 --> 1:34:24.020]  house if they can't resolve it in the court and it goes to the house if you look at article 12
[1:34:25.140 --> 1:34:32.820]  of the uh constitution it says that the state that the house would be the one that votes and
[1:34:32.820 --> 1:34:39.380]  each each delegation each state's delegation gets one vote so you look at how many states have a
[1:34:39.380 --> 1:34:45.220]  republican majority exactly trump wins by that scenario and that's why the the democrats are
[1:34:45.220 --> 1:34:50.660]  so scared you're absolutely right so even the 25th 20th amendment scenario defeats them thank you so
[1:34:50.660 --> 1:34:56.020]  much for the call god bless you randy this is a huge time to be alive if trump just keeps fighting
[1:34:56.020 --> 1:35:00.900]  he's gonna win but the media is gonna say he's illegitimate and try to trigger a race war that's
[1:35:00.900 --> 1:35:06.820]  their next plan they now admit it we are inside the war zone the dogs of war have been released
[1:35:06.820 --> 1:35:12.100]  scott in south carolina i agree with your statement trump's going hard on new world order finally
[1:35:13.540 --> 1:35:20.580]  yes sir alex has nice to talk to you nice talk to you brother um yeah no i think trump should just
[1:35:20.580 --> 1:35:28.180]  fire all missiles um now is the time uh we we have this massive caravan i mean i've been listening
[1:35:28.180 --> 1:35:34.020]  to you for about uh i'd say about nine years i'm 26 and we've always talked i mean we've had
[1:35:34.020 --> 1:35:38.980]  callers call in talk about we need a march on the white house well now is the time all's trump
[1:35:38.980 --> 1:35:44.740]  needed was to see us american patriots standing up for him to act and we're standing up and he's
[1:35:44.740 --> 1:35:52.100]  acting so i think this this this caravan that's happening right now this is is a major a major
[1:35:52.100 --> 1:35:59.060]  stepping stone uh uh in this in this great giant puzzle uh in order to defeat this new world order
[1:35:59.060 --> 1:36:04.420]  is for people to stand up and i feel i feel like you should be on broadcast television all day
[1:36:04.420 --> 1:36:08.980]  long like how come how come there aren't more patriots just on regular tv because that's because
[1:36:08.980 --> 1:36:12.580]  trump and others allowed the total cut off of society they still thought we were in america
[1:36:12.580 --> 1:36:16.900]  they don't have a trouble room but that's okay that's yesterday's war we move forward now the
[1:36:16.900 --> 1:36:20.580]  enemy's out in the open and you're absolutely right scott trump is going hard on the new world
[1:36:20.580 --> 1:36:25.140]  order it's a beautiful time to be alive yeah i think i think he's in the basement i think he's
[1:36:25.140 --> 1:36:32.260]  wargaming right now especially uh uh with this caravan and and and and and and bowser and dc and
[1:36:32.260 --> 1:36:37.060]  all this i think i think he really is wargaming well it's critical for everybody to join the
[1:36:37.060 --> 1:36:42.660]  caravan tonight at lana georgia it's critical for folks to be saturday in dc i'm gonna be there
[1:36:42.660 --> 1:36:50.820]  we'll be right back talk about tomorrow's news today this is all very transparent when you
[1:36:50.820 --> 1:36:56.900]  wargame it out six months ago info was predicted the mail-in ballots would be used to steal the
[1:36:56.900 --> 1:37:02.260]  election from prompt they would simply pause the voting at night and then have an unlimited number
[1:37:02.260 --> 1:37:06.420]  that they had in reserve to bring forward in battleground states to secure the victory and now
[1:37:06.420 --> 1:37:11.060]  that happened now what else did i predict a few months ago and again last week and again last
[1:37:11.060 --> 1:37:17.140]  night all on record that when joe biden was president-elect via fraud trump would challenge it
[1:37:17.140 --> 1:37:22.260]  but biden's next move would be to form his own covet task force say that trump is inept and has
[1:37:22.260 --> 1:37:28.420]  killed 267 thousand americans which is it true and demand trump's removal via the 25th amendment if he
[1:37:28.420 --> 1:37:34.020]  doesn't let joe biden's new covet task force give all the new orders they'll tell trump that if he
[1:37:34.020 --> 1:37:37.940]  backs down and follows their orders and steps down they won't blame him for covet but if he
[1:37:37.940 --> 1:37:41.140]  does that they're gonna blame him for covet but then if he does do what they say he's still gonna
[1:37:41.140 --> 1:37:47.380]  blame him anyways plus this has meant for marshal law destroy the economy i warned you all it's all
[1:37:47.380 --> 1:37:55.780]  on record yale harvard princeton stanford they were all hired a year ago and then again six months
[1:37:55.780 --> 1:38:01.780]  ago to wargame how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic and how to get the public
[1:38:01.780 --> 1:38:07.140]  to take inoculations and they talk about calling people heroes that do it they talk about shaming
[1:38:07.140 --> 1:38:13.300]  those that don't this is all been psychologically tested it's all been psychologically prepared
[1:38:13.300 --> 1:38:17.860]  and once they get you to lock down for 15 days you notice now they say it's permanent that's
[1:38:17.860 --> 1:38:23.140]  how it works oh just put these handcuffs on the serial killer says the woman in the parking lot
[1:38:23.140 --> 1:38:28.980]  and everything will be all right no now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial
[1:38:28.980 --> 1:38:34.740]  killer's van he's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death that's the
[1:38:34.740 --> 1:38:39.940]  allegory we got to bust out of this thing now we got to say no now we got to make a run for it now
[1:38:39.940 --> 1:38:45.140]  we still can't once he gets us in that base but it's going to get a lot a lot worse folks so stop
[1:38:45.140 --> 1:38:51.700]  submitting dna force plus if you did one thing for your immune system it would be get all the
[1:38:51.700 --> 1:38:57.780]  essential things and that's the clean i9 x2 or x3 that's the bio tricillinium that is the vitamin
[1:38:57.780 --> 1:39:01.620]  d3 that is the c that is the zinc there's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential that
[1:39:01.620 --> 1:39:05.300]  of you die and studies show you really need the other ones too but dna force goes beyond that it
[1:39:05.300 --> 1:39:10.580]  helps get all that in the cells and out the cells with pqq and coq 10 of the highest quality sources
[1:39:10.580 --> 1:39:16.660]  with other ingredients that clean out the cells that unclog them so all that stuff can get in
[1:39:16.660 --> 1:39:21.140]  viruses don't get in the good stuff gets in as the NIH website says that if you have all the proper
[1:39:21.140 --> 1:39:25.300]  things they can't replicate like they could but i do this because it's essential like oxygen like
[1:39:25.300 --> 1:39:30.660]  water dna force sold out for months 50 off out of the gates triple patriot points free shipping
[1:39:30.660 --> 1:39:34.740]  info or store dot com dna force election special that's gonna have to end in a week because we
[1:39:34.740 --> 1:39:38.500]  had a limited supply and it was very hard to get the pqq this time a lot of our stuff is you can't
[1:39:38.500 --> 1:39:41.380]  get any more a lot of our products because the supply chain is broken down that's part of the
[1:39:41.380 --> 1:39:46.180]  global's plan info or store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine want to
[1:39:46.180 --> 1:39:50.820]  thank you all for tuning in look we all know that cnn is the epitome of fake news but there's a headline
[1:39:50.820 --> 1:39:57.700]  on their site today that says there are disinformation groups and organizations saying joe biden is not
[1:39:57.700 --> 1:40:05.460]  president-elect well on its face he's not president-elect because the votes have not been
[1:40:05.460 --> 1:40:11.860]  certified by any of the 50 states and counting is still going on what in seven of the states
[1:40:11.860 --> 1:40:17.940]  and trump is gaining ground in all but one of them and then there's also going to be recounts
[1:40:17.940 --> 1:40:24.740]  audits and all the spot checks have already shown master fraud but in comes the ace card the ace
[1:40:24.740 --> 1:40:29.460]  of spades big tech censorship is blocking not just the president not just members of congress
[1:40:30.100 --> 1:40:34.900]  but tens of millions of americans from even sharing local news stations confirming the fraud
[1:40:35.460 --> 1:40:40.980]  this is a foreign-backed multinational takeover the united states trump is battling a chinese-backed
[1:40:41.860 --> 1:40:46.580]  new world order system bit on keeping us locked down forever in an economic war bring us to our knees
[1:40:46.580 --> 1:40:52.580]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:41:16.820 --> 1:41:26.900]  all right a lot of big news is breaking ladies and gentlemen and if you look at the map of real
[1:41:26.900 --> 1:41:31.780]  contested states where votes haven't all been counted this thing is wide open you go to cnn you
[1:41:31.780 --> 1:41:37.220]  can look at any map you want earlier i was like what's the cnn map it shows they've reversed all
[1:41:37.220 --> 1:41:42.660]  this what's just another test map they have what which again shows they can do whatever they want
[1:41:42.660 --> 1:41:46.740]  i was looking at their main map a minute ago they don't even have trump winning north carolina or
[1:41:48.820 --> 1:41:54.740]  alaska but he has won that and then now you go back to their site they do have them winning it so
[1:41:55.780 --> 1:42:01.540]  it just goes to show they can do whatever they want they can play whatever games they want this
[1:42:01.540 --> 1:42:07.540]  is getting truly insane but they reverse pennsylvania they reverse arizona and a few other states that's
[1:42:07.540 --> 1:42:13.380]  done and in the numbers we're seeing coming out that is happening but what we do know is a fraud is
[1:42:13.380 --> 1:42:20.180]  the mail-in ballots the dead people voting the dead cats voting the saying they're going to test the
[1:42:20.180 --> 1:42:26.500]  election that trump contested he's not allowed to get out showing your host here back live very
[1:42:26.500 --> 1:42:32.660]  honored to be here all right let's take a bunch of calls right now brian in new hamster you're on
[1:42:32.660 --> 1:42:38.340]  the air welcome hey what's going on alex world wide broadcast brother so excited to have you on
[1:42:38.340 --> 1:42:43.940]  with us i heard that i just wanted to say real quick about the whole trump thing uh i'll go ahead
[1:42:43.940 --> 1:42:47.860]  and answer the question before you ask me um i don't know where he's at and i've been asking myself
[1:42:47.860 --> 1:42:54.020]  the same thing but you know honestly in my heart i feel like he's kind of just sitting back and pulling
[1:42:54.020 --> 1:42:59.060]  the moves he can and and also just you know trying to get the american people to stand up and do what
[1:42:59.060 --> 1:43:03.460]  they're supposed to because it's not i agree also he wants to get all the evidence of fraud
[1:43:04.100 --> 1:43:09.380]  totally concrete before he goes public with it but if if you go back three months ago remember he
[1:43:09.380 --> 1:43:13.620]  was at that washing machine factory and he said i may be gone for a while because i'm taking on the
[1:43:13.620 --> 1:43:20.820]  deep state remember that yeah yeah what do you make of brennan the uh the uh the the ahobbiest uh
[1:43:20.820 --> 1:43:27.380]  communist former cia director think about that he was a cia director saying that they need to remove
[1:43:27.380 --> 1:43:32.660]  trump other 24th amendment i mean yeah i'm not that right there should tell everyone who the
[1:43:32.660 --> 1:43:37.220]  enemy is straight in their face and i think you know it is time for the people to stop being
[1:43:37.220 --> 1:43:41.540]  scared we need to stand up i know we haven't been able to but i also think something needs to come
[1:43:41.540 --> 1:43:46.660]  out once he does get his data together he needs to do a massive data dump and just show everyone
[1:43:46.660 --> 1:43:50.500]  that he can you know all the information he could put out there without compromising our
[1:43:50.500 --> 1:43:55.860]  our national security and whatnot um just our national security is gone at the chai comms run
[1:43:55.860 --> 1:44:01.300]  things so i just say release at all what do you make of don jr agreeing uh with us and others
[1:44:01.300 --> 1:44:06.740]  that just declassify everything i agree with him 100 i think he's really taken the front
[1:44:06.740 --> 1:44:10.340]  the the you know the front line and coming out and that's what trump needs to do too they all
[1:44:10.340 --> 1:44:15.060]  need to do it they need to i think he needs to come out publicly once he gets his data together
[1:44:15.060 --> 1:44:18.900]  and make a public statement calling on the american people because that'll put the fire
[1:44:18.900 --> 1:44:23.220]  underneath some of these people's asses that haven't gone out there and done anything because they
[1:44:23.220 --> 1:44:28.020]  wait for him to take the orders you know i mean some people just don't have that uh that leadership
[1:44:28.020 --> 1:44:32.820]  push to get through but trump being their idol if he comes down and says look you have to fight for
[1:44:32.820 --> 1:44:37.780]  your country and help me stand up against these globes i think more people will stand up i really
[1:44:37.780 --> 1:44:43.540]  do beautiful brian i totally agree with you all right let's go to elicia in massachusetts you're
[1:44:43.540 --> 1:44:49.540]  on the air welcome hi alex how are you i'm all well i'm pretty stressed out actually i've never
[1:44:49.540 --> 1:44:54.420]  been the stressed out in my life if it takes some of your supplements then i guess come yourself down
[1:44:54.420 --> 1:44:59.220]  i got to remember to take them yeah believe me i've hurt my body without the supplements i couldn't
[1:44:59.220 --> 1:45:05.620]  be operating yeah um i had a question for you because i feel like people maybe don't fully
[1:45:05.620 --> 1:45:10.020]  understand how important this is i mean you've mentioned before this is about good versus evil
[1:45:10.020 --> 1:45:15.460]  i believe this transcends politics there's not been something this is bigger than world war two
[1:45:15.460 --> 1:45:19.700]  for the whole shape of the world i mean the globalists say they're shutting us down forever they're
[1:45:19.700 --> 1:45:24.420]  going to make us poor and make us capitulate to their communist socialist pedophile agenda literally
[1:45:24.420 --> 1:45:28.980]  to turn our kids over to the sexual brainwashing they're going to teach in kindergarten the teachers
[1:45:28.980 --> 1:45:33.780]  are going to masturbate the children the teachers officially are going to molest the children remember
[1:45:33.780 --> 1:45:38.420]  clinton tried to put jocelyn elders in to molest the children she said reach down when they're
[1:45:38.420 --> 1:45:43.540]  five and touch them and teach them touch them and i remember hearing that the tape of that it's so
[1:45:43.540 --> 1:45:50.500]  creepy these are pedophiles and that's their goal is getting the children's energy they're vampires
[1:45:50.500 --> 1:45:54.580]  those of us that aren't pedophiles don't get it we're like what the hell these are psychic vampires
[1:45:54.580 --> 1:46:02.020]  period sorry exactly so no that's fine so um i guess i just wanted to look a little bit more on
[1:46:02.020 --> 1:46:05.540]  that instead of just the political angle i guess i was curious to get your thoughts and for people
[1:46:05.540 --> 1:46:10.180]  to hear your thoughts more on like the the metaphysical angle so spiritually dimensionally
[1:46:10.180 --> 1:46:14.740]  you know what are the ramifications of of either side uh winning just so people can really
[1:46:14.740 --> 1:46:20.740]  understand what this is about we just have to expose how cold what it is now they're creating
[1:46:20.740 --> 1:46:27.380]  a dystopia so we so we accept global extermination hitler was a beta test this is the real move
[1:46:28.180 --> 1:46:32.660]  alicia why do you think the president's been gone i mean i i really don't like it
[1:46:33.300 --> 1:46:37.380]  trump's in hiding what the hell's going on that's that's the real wild card card here
[1:46:37.380 --> 1:46:43.380]  why is trump missing i mean i like to think that he's you know he's focused on his legal battles
[1:46:43.380 --> 1:46:47.380]  he's trying to stay calm i mean you've mentioned how stressed you are i think a lot of people are
[1:46:47.380 --> 1:46:52.020]  stressed i'm sure that he's stressed too i agree but this is an information war he needs to be
[1:46:52.020 --> 1:46:58.100]  resolute desk laying out the election fraud that's pouring out yeah not twittering where they block
[1:46:58.100 --> 1:47:03.060]  his tweets they cannot stop him at the oval office he must be presidential he must take on
[1:47:03.060 --> 1:47:08.900]  biden and say he's not president elect he is a fraud yeah well i guess it's hard to know what's
[1:47:08.900 --> 1:47:12.420]  going on behind the scenes i guess that's why it's great that you have your caravan going i mean if
[1:47:12.420 --> 1:47:16.260]  we can't see him at least people can see uh the support you know the support behind him
[1:47:17.140 --> 1:47:21.140]  but it seems like he's working on it hopefully at least i guess i mean cnn you know changing their
[1:47:21.140 --> 1:47:26.660]  map i mean that is huge i mean i'm in massachusetts i all my friends are very liberal you know i feel
[1:47:26.660 --> 1:47:31.860]  like i can't necessarily talk about my viewpoint um on this so i'm hoping that that some of them
[1:47:31.860 --> 1:47:35.780]  see that i mean interestingly enough i didn't even really come into this again from a political
[1:47:35.780 --> 1:47:40.580]  standpoint i really came into this war from the the spiritual line because i recognize
[1:47:40.580 --> 1:47:44.580]  what this particular race meant and so because of that i've i've tried to become a lot more involved
[1:47:44.580 --> 1:47:48.980]  sure absolutely cnn has thrown out a whole bunch of maps i saw that earlier and was like
[1:47:48.980 --> 1:47:52.660]  is that the official map they're like yeah they went checked it they've got a hundreds of maps
[1:47:52.660 --> 1:47:56.660]  it's all just to confuse everybody but he did just went to Alaska he did just went north carolina
[1:47:56.660 --> 1:48:02.260]  that changed the map so it's all in flux right now they're not god you know newsweek said hillary's
[1:48:02.260 --> 1:48:07.460]  the president it's not true so god bless you i appreciate your call okay let's go ahead and
[1:48:07.460 --> 1:48:14.260]  take another call here let's go ahead and talk to joe and pencil vangie joe go ahead what's going
[1:48:14.260 --> 1:48:20.420]  on alex how are you man people always ask how it's going on i'm on here in austin texas talking to you
[1:48:20.420 --> 1:48:26.580]  joe and we're living in crazy times brother absolutely absolutely sir uh so yeah i wanted
[1:48:26.580 --> 1:48:32.580]  to touch on the dominion software voting systems uh i actually downloaded their 181 page pdf and i
[1:48:32.580 --> 1:48:37.300]  was spent spent some time combing through it last night today uh basically to try to dig up
[1:48:37.300 --> 1:48:42.660]  everything that i can to understand how the software itself works um obviously i'm pretty sure that we
[1:48:42.660 --> 1:48:48.420]  all know that 60 majority shareholder is actually diane feinstein's husband and they had a huge
[1:48:48.420 --> 1:48:53.700]  financial backing from the clinton foundation which either like even though this wouldn't be
[1:48:53.700 --> 1:48:59.140]  enough to incriminate and validate broad it most certainly a clear conflict of interest oh everywhere
[1:48:59.140 --> 1:49:03.380]  it's flipping against trump never against biden that's why all these local races of republicans
[1:49:03.380 --> 1:49:07.460]  are winning now that we're losing as they go and check and they and the county clerks get scared
[1:49:07.460 --> 1:49:12.180]  and flip back because they can go to jail don't hang up joe since you mentioned it here's root
[1:49:12.180 --> 1:49:17.940]  off juliani uh on with steve ban on the war room talking just about what you just mentioned and that's
[1:49:17.940 --> 1:49:22.180]  a combination our next guest is going to be dav colman from i think the great lakes he's one of
[1:49:22.180 --> 1:49:30.740]  these public interest research uh institutions it this lawsuit is a combination of what thor was
[1:49:30.740 --> 1:49:35.300]  working on in colman is that correct in michigan correct and they both and they both have superior
[1:49:35.300 --> 1:49:40.900]  information thor thor has to part of it with the government insiders who basically are turning
[1:49:40.900 --> 1:49:45.540]  let's call it state's evidence that they are democrats who are testifying against the democratic
[1:49:45.540 --> 1:49:52.420]  effort because they were so disgusted that's basically thor's uh people colman has to community
[1:49:52.420 --> 1:49:57.620]  people and he's got the dominion people and they were the ones who were the actual uh
[1:49:58.580 --> 1:50:03.780]  not the poll watches the observers who were excluded who were lied to but two of whom
[1:50:03.780 --> 1:50:08.740]  stayed behind after all the republicans have been left out and they're the ones who got the
[1:50:08.740 --> 1:50:14.660]  evidence on the hundred thousand votes coming in and and they have some photographs also you put
[1:50:14.660 --> 1:50:20.820]  those two together and you've got some very very powerful evidence that that room at the
[1:50:20.820 --> 1:50:26.020]  cove center i think it was was a complete uh let's make up the votes room how much do we
[1:50:26.020 --> 1:50:30.020]  have to make up and let's get there absolutely the democrats want to burn down america they say
[1:50:30.020 --> 1:50:35.620]  they're gonna cheat they've been caught joe go ahead yeah so it like kind of following up on
[1:50:35.620 --> 1:50:40.980]  rudy i i think i have a pretty good understanding now of how they actually got those vote totals
[1:50:40.980 --> 1:50:44.500]  at the wee hours of the morning after they shut down the polling locations in the first place
[1:50:44.500 --> 1:50:49.060]  now it'll happen within a couple of hours and it's won by a couple hundred thousands of votes
[1:50:49.060 --> 1:50:53.460]  which would be pretty close to impossible for people to just hand write ballots but with the
[1:50:53.460 --> 1:50:59.300]  dominion software voting system you have a master computer where you can upload any algorithm
[1:50:59.300 --> 1:51:04.980]  that would be approved by their software um and it will automatically by the way all across the
[1:51:04.980 --> 1:51:09.620]  battleground states they did a patch the day before and then republicans didn't show up and
[1:51:09.620 --> 1:51:15.380]  certified or even check it yes absolutely and now i remember specifically in philadelphia uh
[1:51:15.380 --> 1:51:20.500]  i'm pretty close to philadelphia the hill had posted an article political a lot of people did
[1:51:20.500 --> 1:51:25.300]  joe don't hang up you're a great caller i want to come back to you and all these other callers
[1:51:25.300 --> 1:51:30.180]  our number three straight ahead steve pacinic is joining us as well with big news he predicted
[1:51:30.180 --> 1:51:33.940]  all these big firings as trump takes the deep state of the woodshed we'll be back
[1:51:33.940 --> 1:51:39.460]  Alex Jones here with an important message all of our listeners and viewers i want to thank you
[1:51:39.460 --> 1:51:43.940]  for your support over the years i want to thank you for having skin in the game and no one has
[1:51:43.940 --> 1:51:49.060]  had more skin in the game than our president and he needs our prayers he needs our support he is
[1:51:49.060 --> 1:51:54.420]  the president secretary of state Pompeo understands that's why he said yesterday there will be a smooth
[1:51:54.420 --> 1:52:00.180]  transition from this Trump administration into the next Trump administration because in all the
[1:52:00.180 --> 1:52:05.780]  major states where they're still counting they are gaining ground that is president trump republican
[1:52:05.780 --> 1:52:11.540]  party the american people the populace the patriots the enemy the democrats backed by the shy comms
[1:52:11.540 --> 1:52:16.100]  backed by the european union backed by hollywood backed by the left the blue cities the blue states
[1:52:16.100 --> 1:52:21.780]  they are in a rage trying to gaslight us keep calling biden president elect he's not president
[1:52:21.780 --> 1:52:26.900]  has to concede and or all of the states have to certify the vote which hasn't happened yet
[1:52:26.900 --> 1:52:31.780]  and then you have to have the electors seek who is going to be the president and this may be a
[1:52:31.780 --> 1:52:35.460]  dispute that goes back to the states that's why it's in the constitution and the constitution's
[1:52:35.460 --> 1:52:44.420]  kicking in warning warning warning there is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover
[1:52:45.140 --> 1:52:49.780]  the giant third world collapse and a new world war that is going to be triggered by the new
[1:52:49.780 --> 1:52:56.900]  covid lockdown announced by globalist systems in europe in asia and now in the united states joe
[1:52:56.900 --> 1:53:03.060]  bite is set to announce today that he has a new covid task force that is calling for a national
[1:53:03.060 --> 1:53:09.220]  mask mandate to prove your servitude contact tracing forced inoculations coming but most
[1:53:09.220 --> 1:53:16.020]  importantly a new lockdown that way he can say that trump is to blame for covid and claim that only
[1:53:16.020 --> 1:53:22.500]  a new lockdown will stop covid then of course when that new lockdown doesn't work those of us that
[1:53:22.500 --> 1:53:26.740]  didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it and that's when all the mass arrests
[1:53:26.740 --> 1:53:32.740]  start sometime towards the end of next year this is a permanent martial law plan trump must be
[1:53:32.740 --> 1:53:42.900]  putiated exposed falchion gates and the un takeover not play games with it you're listening to the alex
[1:53:42.900 --> 1:54:05.060]  jones show
[1:54:05.060 --> 1:54:17.780]  it's been said that there are times in history when more things happen in a week or a day that
[1:54:17.780 --> 1:54:21.540]  happened in the previous five years we're in that time right now you're taking your calls
[1:54:21.540 --> 1:54:26.820]  dr steve chennick coming up next segment joe pa was knocking out of the park on election fraud
[1:54:26.820 --> 1:54:31.060]  the voting machines all of it man have we not gotten the globalist out in the open i mean they are
[1:54:31.060 --> 1:54:36.420]  just they are just right out in the open the chai comms are celebrating uh thinking joe biden's the
[1:54:36.420 --> 1:54:44.180]  president this is a crazy moment yes absolutely and uh my number one thing is i think trump is
[1:54:44.180 --> 1:54:48.500]  playing it exactly right just stay in the shadows you never interrupt the enemy while they're in the
[1:54:48.500 --> 1:54:53.620]  process of destroying themselves you let them put themselves out there on the table there's an army
[1:54:53.620 --> 1:54:59.140]  of citizens journalists just like me you and every every listener that we have here that are doing
[1:54:59.140 --> 1:55:02.980]  their due diligence and going through and exposing all of this fraud and corruption trump
[1:55:02.980 --> 1:55:07.700]  doesn't even have to do anything except for keep himself insulated and that's the most important
[1:55:07.700 --> 1:55:15.940]  thing well i'm gonna ask dr patrick why he thinks trump gave that speech at three a.m. on november
[1:55:15.940 --> 1:55:20.180]  third and number fourth and then gave one of the little speech has not been seen for four days five
[1:55:20.180 --> 1:55:24.180]  days i don't think that's a good strategy i think it should be resolute desk but maybe he's waiting
[1:55:24.180 --> 1:55:27.780]  with all the evidence then hit him hard but i think he should address the american people and
[1:55:27.780 --> 1:55:32.660]  say that joe biden's the communist chinese agent and that he's a fraud that's the end of it but
[1:55:32.660 --> 1:55:36.820]  we'll find out what dr patrick his take on that when we come back let's get another call in here

[1:56:10.740 --> 1:56:15.940]  sell us this information that you're giving to us i think now it's our turn to grab this information
[1:56:15.940 --> 1:56:20.420]  and make a difference we've got to get to dc this weekend that's why the enemy is shutting down all
[1:56:20.420 --> 1:56:26.180]  the communication because they're weak we have the truth and that just it's outrageous and all
[1:56:26.180 --> 1:56:31.940]  the censorship all the tyranny all the bullying is only a nerve it's a small taste of what's coming
[1:56:31.940 --> 1:56:37.380]  if we let these monsters take control of our republic i agree and i think people really need
[1:56:37.380 --> 1:56:41.700]  to recognize that and stop being afraid of what people are going to think about you whenever
[1:56:41.700 --> 1:56:46.020]  you decide to go to this thing in dc whenever you decide to go and protest against the main
[1:56:46.020 --> 1:56:50.580]  i mean the democrats are like anybody that voted for trump we have the voter rolls we're going to
[1:56:50.580 --> 1:56:55.300]  persecute you anyone that doesn't support our overthrow of trump will persecuting people like

[1:57:19.860 --> 1:57:24.340]  some wall getting pulled over our eyes and i think that's happening i'm just asking regular people

[1:58:13.060 --> 1:58:18.020]  going to play the sickening running club because this is literally voted for the communist party
[1:58:18.020 --> 1:58:23.940]  twice is a wahhabist saudi arabian pimp and and this this guy thinks he's going to defeat us

[2:00:14.100 --> 2:00:19.620]  lecture selected there's a process the constitution lays it out pretty clearly the world should have
[2:00:19.620 --> 2:00:23.540]  every confidence that the transition necessary to make sure that the state department is functional
[2:00:23.540 --> 2:00:30.180]  today successful today and successful with the president who's in office on january 20th a minute
[2:00:30.180 --> 2:00:34.820]  afternoon will also be successful i went through a transition on the front and i've been on the
[2:00:34.820 --> 2:00:39.540]  other side of this i'm very confident that we will do all the things that are necessary to make
[2:00:39.540 --> 2:00:42.660]  sure that the the government the united states government will continue to perform as national
[2:00:42.660 --> 2:00:48.020]  security function as we go forward well if last president penson the cabinet had an ounce of
[2:00:48.020 --> 2:00:53.220]  of fortitude and spine and patriotism i think they would seriously consider invoking the 25th
[2:00:53.220 --> 2:00:59.220]  amendment um and you know pushing donald trump out because he is just very unpredictable now
[2:00:59.220 --> 2:01:05.220]  he's like a cornered cat tiger and he is going to lash out and the fact that again that he has
[2:01:05.220 --> 2:01:11.220]  the powers of the presidency in his hands is quite worrisome now we we know that the attorney general
[2:01:11.220 --> 2:01:17.300]  bar has done donald trump's bidding in the past will he continue to do that vis-a-vis this election
[2:01:17.300 --> 2:01:21.700]  i don't know but i do think it's something that the members of congress the leadership of the
[2:01:21.700 --> 2:01:27.700]  republican party really needs to send clear signals to doll trump that if he goes continues to go
[2:01:27.700 --> 2:01:33.620]  along this path they are going to put up roadblocks what do you make of the attorney general saying
[2:01:33.620 --> 2:01:39.140]  that uh his investigators before the electoral college will look at substantial allegations
[2:01:39.140 --> 2:01:44.660]  of voting irregularities as you and i both know irregularities is not a legal standard or any kind
[2:01:44.660 --> 2:01:50.660]  of criminal rubric but what do you make of that well i think it's an unprecedented move and again
[2:01:50.660 --> 2:01:55.540]  since william bar has shown that he is willing to be doll trump's personal defense lawyer as
[2:01:55.540 --> 2:01:59.940]  opposed to the attorney general united states i am concerned that he's going to be looking at this
[2:01:59.940 --> 2:02:06.100]  in a very one-sided manner and so i think this is something that's hopefully the the state attorney
[2:02:06.100 --> 2:02:11.620]  generals and others are going to stand fast and also the department of justice professional
[2:02:11.620 --> 2:02:17.460]  uh professionals are going to carry out their duties irrespective of whatever type of political
[2:02:17.460 --> 2:02:22.340]  wins they feel are blowing their way john brennan thank you very much for your perspective appreciate
[2:02:22.340 --> 2:02:27.460]  it love to have you back when we see what happens next well if william bars and on sycophant of
[2:02:27.460 --> 2:02:33.140]  trump which is it true then you're an old sycophant of communist china the wahhabist communist party in
[2:02:33.140 --> 2:02:39.780]  any america hating knuckle dragging satanic murderous group of scum man here's the good news i
[2:02:39.780 --> 2:02:44.900]  don't look at body language and that arrogant sob does not usually look scared he finally because
[2:02:44.900 --> 2:02:50.500]  trump is finally executing looks like he just crapped his diapers dr steve pacinic is the
[2:02:50.500 --> 2:02:54.580]  co-author of many of tom clancy's books he did help found out the force he did run the camp
[2:02:54.580 --> 2:02:59.460]  david accords he is a psychiatrist and a doctor and all the rest of that stuff and he did do over
[2:02:59.460 --> 2:03:04.020]  throws the governments and he is who he says he is uh and he's here with us he did expose 911 as
[2:03:04.020 --> 2:03:09.620]  an inside job he did expose been a lot of us already dead he did predict two weeks on the show that
[2:03:09.620 --> 2:03:14.420]  we would see the head of the cia and the secretary of defense all fired very very soon i thought well
[2:03:14.420 --> 2:03:19.780]  that's lofty things we're gonna go pull the clips everybody heard it you saw it uh and you also
[2:03:19.780 --> 2:03:23.860]  brought up watermarks and all this i haven't seen the proof of that i'm not saying you're wrong
[2:03:23.860 --> 2:03:29.700]  that got four point something million views on info wars with owen uh i think you mean what you say
[2:03:29.700 --> 2:03:34.100]  you might be wrong sometime i hope that's the case but certainly we're seeing the tide turn with
[2:03:34.100 --> 2:03:39.940]  trump winning uh north carolina alaska uh they're really starting to panic right now i see fear in
[2:03:39.940 --> 2:03:44.500]  brennan's eyes it seems like he's kind of the ringleader the king right there uh so where do
[2:03:44.500 --> 2:03:50.980]  you want to start dr steve pacinic let's start with the fact this is very unusual what i just heard
[2:03:50.980 --> 2:03:57.380]  brennan do i mean it was one of the stupidest interviews he's ever done for a man who i consider
[2:03:57.380 --> 2:04:04.020]  to be exceedingly self-destructive now although i was accused of being a shill for the cia i've
[2:04:04.020 --> 2:04:10.900]  never been in the cia but i can't tell you the quality of people who recruited in the cia
[2:04:10.900 --> 2:04:19.220]  is typified by brennan irish catholic totally incompetent messed up in sardar arabia messed
[2:04:19.220 --> 2:04:26.740]  up with george busch who brought him on board then became the director of the cia under obama
[2:04:26.740 --> 2:04:35.140]  the manchurian candidate another obama but what makes this fascinating is john brennan just accused
[2:04:35.140 --> 2:04:43.060]  another operative of being incompetent and who am i talking about bar i've said it on this show
[2:04:43.060 --> 2:04:49.060]  before and i'm going to say it again bar is the attorney general he has never had a lot of
[2:04:49.060 --> 2:04:55.540]  prosecutorial experience but he started as a d i i said this on the show two years ago that's a
[2:04:55.540 --> 2:05:03.060]  analyst at the cia then he became a ddo that's all right so so what's the big picture what what's
[2:05:03.060 --> 2:05:09.300]  the big picture a big picture here is that you have an internal fight going on within the cia
[2:05:09.860 --> 2:05:16.980]  between the military and the civilian intelligence units between the democrats and the republican
[2:05:16.980 --> 2:05:24.100]  this is a full fledged revolution this is what i said months ago i said jenna haspel will leave
[2:05:24.100 --> 2:05:31.620]  she was fired i told you asper would be fired he was fired ray christopher ray will be fired fouchy
[2:05:31.620 --> 2:05:38.420]  will be fired so what's happening now contrary to what everybody believes trump is very much in
[2:05:38.420 --> 2:05:46.420]  control this is what i said before this is sun zoom he's watching the game manipulating it and you
[2:05:46.420 --> 2:05:52.340]  don't see it i told you we set it up whether you believe in the watermarks and that that's not relevant
[2:05:52.340 --> 2:05:58.100]  what you should understand and what i said is that the cryptocurrencies or the
[2:05:58.820 --> 2:06:05.300]  the coding that was done is not just done by the cia or any of those organizations it's done at a
[2:06:05.300 --> 2:06:12.660]  much higher level where you have people in the cyber command cyber communication there's a reason
[2:06:12.660 --> 2:06:19.860]  why i wrote 30 40 years ago before even clancy was around a series of book called net force
[2:06:19.860 --> 2:06:26.180]  cyber command and cyber war i could predict that there would be a future where cyber command and
[2:06:26.180 --> 2:06:32.980]  the fact that we would be monitored all day and every day which is what we are the nsa monitors
[2:06:32.980 --> 2:06:39.300]  us this is what was said by bannon and the general before they monitor us and then they can switch
[2:06:39.300 --> 2:06:45.620]  whatever votes are needed either in florida or anywhere else trump understood this so did a lot
[2:06:45.620 --> 2:06:51.300]  of people in the intelligence community and elsewhere and they wanted to be proactive what
[2:06:51.300 --> 2:06:58.820]  you're seeing now whether you believe it or not is very clear you see sun zoo in action you see the
[2:06:58.820 --> 2:07:06.820]  mastermind trump a president who basically is very quiet went to that went to the national
[2:07:06.820 --> 2:07:12.980]  cemetery did what he had to do on veterans day was very president question why is normally
[2:07:12.980 --> 2:07:17.780]  everywhere ten times a day why is trump normally running around like the sun in the high noon he
[2:07:17.780 --> 2:07:24.260]  everywhere you see him why has he not been seen hardly why does he want why is trump not being seen
[2:07:25.460 --> 2:07:34.420]  because this is a very clever move what you do not want is to understand that he is in this game
[2:07:34.420 --> 2:07:40.820]  manipulating it actively in fact what he is doing is compelling you and others to say
[2:07:40.820 --> 2:07:47.540]  where is he what's happening and in fact the brilliance of his maneuver this is what he's
[2:07:47.540 --> 2:07:54.260]  done in the past is to initiate the strategy he's done that with all his casinos walk away
[2:07:54.260 --> 2:08:01.220]  let you make all the necessary comments self-destruct and more importantly project your own fears and
[2:08:01.220 --> 2:08:08.020]  concerns then he monitors that and then puts it within the system the more fearful you become
[2:08:08.020 --> 2:08:13.700]  the more you ask him to come to the front right now the more he pulls back it's the brilliant
[2:08:13.700 --> 2:08:22.900]  art of war i didn't determine it trump knew this way before i ever met him he knew he knew it in
[2:08:22.900 --> 2:08:27.060]  new jersey when he built the country i don't agree with me dr machinic why does why does
[2:08:27.060 --> 2:08:34.820]  brennan look so scared he's calling for because brennan will be indicted for various criminal
[2:08:34.820 --> 2:08:41.780]  activities unfortunately he's in the he is or was in the cia but he knows he's making a fool of
[2:08:41.780 --> 2:08:48.020]  himself he knows and he's on a self-destructive path he may not be competent but he's not stupid
[2:08:48.020 --> 2:08:53.860]  he knows exactly what's been happening and he's been urged by the democrats who gave him the
[2:08:53.860 --> 2:09:01.140]  access that he needed although bush jr gave it to him as well those days are gone trump is not in
[2:09:01.140 --> 2:09:08.420]  the business of cow towering to the x cia operatives or x military operatives if anything
[2:09:08.420 --> 2:09:14.980]  he's very pro military and those of us in the back and back back back not including me i have
[2:09:14.980 --> 2:09:20.660]  nothing to do with any of the affiliations believe it or not you can read it an american warrior
[2:09:20.660 --> 2:09:27.140]  in crisis the book i wrote i don't belong to any of the organizations that's why i go on your show
[2:09:27.140 --> 2:09:32.740]  allege because you don't belong to anybody let's talk about this when we come back let's let's
[2:09:32.740 --> 2:09:36.660]  talk about the election fraud where you think it's going what you think's going to unfold next and
[2:09:36.660 --> 2:09:41.060]  what the democrats are going to do if they're repudiated saying joe biden is president elect
[2:09:41.060 --> 2:09:47.620]  we'll be right back stay with us election 2020 is here and whether trump wins or loses we have all
[2:09:47.620 --> 2:09:52.820]  won by exposing the commons chinese by exposing the globalist by exposing the pedophile rings
[2:09:52.820 --> 2:09:59.060]  by exposing the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil now i'm personally a
[2:09:59.060 --> 2:10:03.220]  christian i believe in god and i know god's real and i've experienced it in my life but even you
[2:10:03.220 --> 2:10:08.180]  don't believe in god it's important to recognize that there is goodness world there is evil and
[2:10:08.180 --> 2:10:13.220]  there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing that and what i see
[2:10:13.220 --> 2:10:19.140]  happening across the spectrum of different political views is people finally get that they
[2:10:19.140 --> 2:10:25.140]  finally understand that they're not being naive anymore don't ever project your decency and your
[2:10:25.140 --> 2:10:30.340]  goodness onto other people until they've proven what they stand for and who they are or you're
[2:10:30.340 --> 2:10:34.660]  going to get hurt but those of you out there have done your own research and discovered who's good
[2:10:34.660 --> 2:10:38.740]  and who is faithful will then come together with those organizations and support them
[2:10:38.740 --> 2:10:44.020]  like info wars because without your support info wars would not exist i look down here with an
[2:10:44.020 --> 2:10:46.900]  important message all of our listeners and viewers i want to thank you for your support over the
[2:10:46.900 --> 2:10:51.860]  years i want to thank you for having skin in the game and no one has had more skin in the game
[2:10:51.860 --> 2:10:56.740]  than our president and he needs our prayers he needs our support he is the president
[2:10:56.740 --> 2:11:01.220]  secretary of state Pompeo understands that's why he said yesterday there will be a smooth
[2:11:01.220 --> 2:11:07.380]  transition from this trump administration into the next administration because in all the major
[2:11:07.380 --> 2:11:13.140]  states where they're still counting they are gaining ground that is president trump republican party
[2:11:13.140 --> 2:11:18.340]  the american people the populace the patriots the enemy the democrats backed by the chai comms
[2:11:18.340 --> 2:11:22.900]  backed by the european union backed by hollywood backed by the left the blue cities the blue states
[2:11:22.900 --> 2:11:28.580]  they are in a rage trying to gaslight us keep calling biden president elect he's not president
[2:11:28.580 --> 2:11:33.700]  has to concede and or all of the states have to certify the vote which hasn't happened yet
[2:11:33.700 --> 2:11:38.580]  and then you have to have the electors to seek who is going to be the president and this may be
[2:11:38.580 --> 2:11:42.740]  a dispute that goes back to the states that's why it's in the constitution and the constitution's kicking in
[2:11:46.100 --> 2:11:48.740]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:11:57.060 --> 2:12:02.980]  well it was the 79 days of hell election day and 78 more we predicted it well was told us
[2:12:02.980 --> 2:12:07.220]  they'll do it now here we are they said count every vote they're going to contest forever
[2:12:07.220 --> 2:12:12.260]  instead they froze the election with media control and democrat controlled states and
[2:12:12.260 --> 2:12:17.220]  then discounted the trump votes and put the fraudulent in with graphs that were organic
[2:12:17.220 --> 2:12:21.060]  but then went straight up everybody can see it experts have come out and said it's a fraud
[2:12:21.780 --> 2:12:25.460]  the washington post is panicking saying that whistleblowers are frauds and the whistleblowers
[2:12:25.460 --> 2:12:30.100]  come out and say it's not true we didn't say that they are so desperate dr pacinic let me ask
[2:12:30.100 --> 2:12:33.620]  you these questions because you're an author researcher you know you've seen a lot of angled
[2:12:33.620 --> 2:12:38.100]  state department all these different groups from talking to your sources your own research
[2:12:39.700 --> 2:12:43.140]  what would you call this period in american history because it's not just a civil war it's
[2:12:43.140 --> 2:12:48.580]  an outside power trying to control the country and what do you expect to happen i mean is trump
[2:12:48.580 --> 2:12:53.780]  going to win i mean obviously he's winning in reality tell people your your your weather forecast
[2:12:55.060 --> 2:13:01.140]  it's what i said years ago on your show we did a sting operation on hillary clinton she didn't
[2:13:01.140 --> 2:13:08.820]  succeed we are allowing biden to be president for 40 or 60 days and it's over december 14th it
[2:13:08.820 --> 2:13:15.540]  will be over the electoral college will declare that trump won trump will come back in and this
[2:13:15.540 --> 2:13:20.820]  is a period of turbulence that would be expected in the republic admitting he's getting ready with
[2:13:20.820 --> 2:13:27.780]  riot police to shoot looters well i'm not in the business at the local level to do what we did but
[2:13:27.780 --> 2:13:34.660]  i did tell you we did send out national guards and other paramilitary units to make sure that we
[2:13:34.660 --> 2:13:41.220]  didn't have massive riots and we wouldn't have a civil war this is not a civil war we're not going
[2:13:41.220 --> 2:13:47.700]  down as abraham lincoln did and slaughtered southern innocent southern citizens for the mississippi
[2:13:47.700 --> 2:13:56.100]  missouri and new orleans what we're doing here is a proactive move that trump explained years ago when
[2:13:56.100 --> 2:14:05.140]  he said vote hashtag cheek voters he meant that he knew very well that our elections have been nothing
[2:14:05.140 --> 2:14:13.700]  more than a series of corrupt practices with the bushes both bushes both clintons with obama twice
[2:14:13.700 --> 2:14:18.420]  and now with biden i agree so what comes next and how do they respond how do you see this unfolding
[2:14:18.420 --> 2:14:27.540]  what comes next is that trump will declare that he is the president biden will withdraw because
[2:14:27.540 --> 2:14:34.820]  biden will either have to follow out of be faced with prosecutorial indictments serious ones as well
[2:14:34.820 --> 2:14:40.740]  as those against his son it was not an accident we had brought up his son and hunter biden as
[2:14:40.740 --> 2:14:47.220]  well as his two brothers so the more biden comes out which is exactly what trump wants him to do
[2:14:47.220 --> 2:14:52.820]  the more he's basically self-destructing it's like john i was about to say though he is i've never
[2:14:52.820 --> 2:14:57.620]  seen anyone in history this compromise he is caught this isn't like fables about russia
[2:14:57.620 --> 2:15:02.740]  they have the audio of them saying me and my dad worked for chinese intelligence i mean this is like
[2:15:02.740 --> 2:15:11.540]  royal flush stuff so you explained it to me how is a man who was so stupid so incompetent
[2:15:11.540 --> 2:15:18.020]  who has literally been in a position 47 years where he's done nothing except as i said before
[2:15:18.020 --> 2:15:25.700]  go to war in iraq syria syria blah blah blah he did nothing totally corrupt brothers are corrupt
[2:15:25.700 --> 2:15:34.100]  sons are corrupt and he has the gall to say i'm in charge now i mean it is beyond absurdity so you
[2:15:34.100 --> 2:15:40.260]  can call this the theater of the absurd but in reality the man who's writing it directing it and
[2:15:40.260 --> 2:15:47.380]  producing it is donald trump a genius trust me this is not just now that i've seen it i've seen
[2:15:47.380 --> 2:15:55.860]  a word for 30 to 40 years in new york new jersey and all over the world this is exactly how a genius
[2:15:55.860 --> 2:16:03.140]  works he sets it up he puts in the scam he lets the people self-destruct notice hillary clinton
[2:16:03.140 --> 2:16:10.100]  hasn't said a word she's basically she knew she was on notice but biden didn't get the message and
[2:16:10.100 --> 2:16:17.780]  he's right out there with kamala harris whoever she is what nonsense she portrays as an african
[2:16:17.780 --> 2:16:25.140]  american woman her father was a professor emeritus at stanford we knew him he was famous in economics
[2:16:25.140 --> 2:16:31.060]  came out he says he's poor a group on the street so let's talk about this forget i'm sorry i'll
[2:16:31.060 --> 2:16:34.820]  forget dr. steve pacinic forget alex jones forget donald trump forget hillary clinton forget
[2:16:34.820 --> 2:16:41.380]  joe biden they're saying he's president-elect when it's the state attorney generals and it's it's
[2:16:41.380 --> 2:16:47.220]  it's the legislatures that certify the vote that hasn't happened unless someone capitulates and
[2:16:47.220 --> 2:16:53.620]  concedes and so when cnn says oh no he's president-elect i could put up on screen as a media institution
[2:16:53.620 --> 2:16:58.580]  say alex jones is president-elect it's not true so the fact that they're trying to gasline us like
[2:16:58.580 --> 2:17:04.980]  this what does this do to the mainstream media when this fails you hit it on the head alex from
[2:17:04.980 --> 2:17:10.340]  the reason i always chose you is because i knew there was imminent death of the new york times
[2:17:10.340 --> 2:17:18.100]  washington post wall street journal what you have here is basically the collapse of any notion
[2:17:18.100 --> 2:17:24.660]  of a centralized media or media coming out of washington dc if you don't go to project veritas
[2:17:24.660 --> 2:17:30.580]  you don't go to alex jones you don't go to the social media lines where we know their alternative
[2:17:30.580 --> 2:17:36.420]  media you're not going to get the truth and this is really what you see is the implosion
[2:17:36.420 --> 2:17:46.180]  of a system that never thought it would die fox news abc msnbc all of them gone anison cooper
[2:17:46.180 --> 2:17:52.500]  twice was an intern at the cia you're telling me this is a naive well-intentioned liberal
[2:17:52.500 --> 2:17:59.620]  no way he knew exactly what was going on you have all of jake tapper wrote an incredible story
[2:17:59.620 --> 2:18:05.220]  about the outpost in afghanistan military he didn't know what was going on of course he knew what
[2:18:05.220 --> 2:18:13.060]  was going on so this goes on and on and on what you're seeing is a massive change in the media
[2:18:13.060 --> 2:18:18.500]  in the schools now we're seeing what schools we need and what we don't need universities
[2:18:18.500 --> 2:18:23.780]  but for me as you said a few years ago this in school learning is about to be discredited i don't
[2:18:23.780 --> 2:18:29.220]  like to big take takeover at the same time the very teacher unions are buying into this at home
[2:18:29.220 --> 2:18:34.500]  learning and destroying themselves how do they're all destroying themselves how were they tricked
[2:18:34.500 --> 2:18:40.980]  into this because when you're greedy there are two elements and you're hitting it on the head
[2:18:40.980 --> 2:18:48.820]  alex fear and self-aggrandizement and the notion that you don't have to take a risk of the two
[2:18:48.820 --> 2:18:56.580]  elements we don't foster in an entrepreneurial world but we do foster with a pension i can control
[2:18:56.580 --> 2:19:03.460]  any cia operative or any military or any school teacher by simply saying the following you don't
[2:19:03.460 --> 2:19:09.780]  want to do what and then i'll handle your pension i can handle the pension handle their salaries so
[2:19:09.780 --> 2:19:16.820]  what happens in america the people you see who are compromised the school teachers it's unfortunate
[2:19:16.820 --> 2:19:22.980]  their unions got them into bankruptcy moral they might be good people but they're in a communist
[2:19:22.980 --> 2:19:28.900]  cult that's correct i mean here in florida they signed away all think of this they signed away
[2:19:28.900 --> 2:19:36.340]  all of their rights in 1968 how do you sign away your rights in 1968 when you're a teacher and you're
[2:19:36.340 --> 2:19:43.940]  supposed to be giving information to others that's how stupid and that's how fearful we have a society
[2:19:43.940 --> 2:19:49.140]  every time you see somebody wearing a mask that's about to say let's get into covid because this
[2:19:49.140 --> 2:19:54.020]  morning you let it on me you haven't really said this but just say it manufactured virus fear weapon
[2:19:54.020 --> 2:19:59.540]  chai com global still laid out correct let's come back and hit that with dr steve machinic
[2:19:59.540 --> 2:20:02.900]  steve machinic dot com we're gonna lay this out i just looked at the clock and that wasn't a
[2:20:02.900 --> 2:20:07.940]  cliffhanger on purpose i looked at the clock 20 seconds ladies and gentlemen this is epic stuff
[2:20:07.940 --> 2:20:13.380]  going down right now and this is the battle for the republic and now you've got north carolina
[2:20:13.380 --> 2:20:19.460]  and you've got uh alaska won by trump and the media is not even covering it this is so historical
[2:20:19.460 --> 2:20:24.180]  this is edgier seat stuff and i'm just so glad and so blessed you kept us here on air we got
[2:20:24.180 --> 2:20:30.900]  loaded phones too jay dyer is coming up and ever machinic leaves us i will take all these calls
[2:20:30.900 --> 2:20:36.340]  from jenice curt kathy and many others stay with us info wars dot com tomorrow's news today
[2:20:41.460 --> 2:20:47.540]  remember hillary clinton remember polosi remember bill clinton remember obama all of them said
[2:20:47.540 --> 2:20:52.340]  we are not gonna concede if there's a red mirage we believe it's gonna look like trumps gonna win
[2:20:52.340 --> 2:20:57.540]  in the landslide because they had the internal polls and indeed trump won most of the states he won
[2:20:57.540 --> 2:21:02.020]  last time by an even bigger march and when he was set to win the other ones they froze
[2:21:02.740 --> 2:21:08.580]  the seven states on election night and then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had
[2:21:08.580 --> 2:21:13.060]  this is completely transparent so when they say that he is president elect he's not trump is not
[2:21:13.060 --> 2:21:17.060]  conceded none of the states have certified the vote and now all these investigations have been
[2:21:17.060 --> 2:21:22.820]  opened up and avalanches mountains oceans of election fraud has come out and already been
[2:21:22.820 --> 2:21:27.780]  documented in georgia officials are on record saying we've already found fraud so ladies and
[2:21:27.780 --> 2:21:32.660]  gentlemen the fix is in they've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time because the last hoax
[2:21:32.660 --> 2:21:37.220]  failed but now this is the mother of all hoaxes and if they get away with this it's the end of

[2:24:08.980 --> 2:24:22.900]  all i know is this it makes me physically sick not the psychic energy of the socialist and
[2:24:22.900 --> 2:24:28.180]  communist but the american people are so angry i'm tied into them i feel physically sick
[2:24:29.460 --> 2:24:36.980]  and i'm concerned because america is not gonna accept the globalist takeover not gonna accept
[2:24:36.980 --> 2:24:42.820]  the chikams not gonna accept hollywood i don't get why if the globalist have conquered america
[2:24:42.820 --> 2:24:47.620]  already why they want to piss on it instead of grow it it'd be one thing if the globalist just
[2:24:47.620 --> 2:24:52.340]  took over and like we're into freedom they're not they're into everything sick they're self-destructive
[2:24:52.340 --> 2:24:56.340]  and they want us to be destructive with them and it's not gonna happen so i just want to tell
[2:24:56.340 --> 2:25:02.100]  joe biden and whoever the hell is handling him and and all these people notice even gg ping and
[2:25:02.100 --> 2:25:06.740]  putin won't say trump's lost they get this is insane the mexican president had an election stolen from
[2:25:06.740 --> 2:25:10.980]  him he's a socialist he's supporting trump because they recognize this not a pechenic of the nine
[2:25:10.980 --> 2:25:15.060]  minutes we have left you've got the florida at other points but just big picture historically
[2:25:15.060 --> 2:25:19.220]  and what we the people can do to make sure that this election is clean obviously trump won how we
[2:25:19.220 --> 2:25:25.220]  get president trump in to truly keep america great i think what's important is to one understand
[2:25:25.220 --> 2:25:31.620]  the the constitution and the fact that we're a republic we can tolerate these kinds of upheavals
[2:25:31.620 --> 2:25:37.540]  this is part of what a republic is about we're not a democracy that means our founding fathers
[2:25:37.540 --> 2:25:43.460]  understood very clearly that every person could not vote directly otherwise we would have the
[2:25:43.460 --> 2:25:49.060]  french revolution we do not have a french revolution what we do have is an upheaval here
[2:25:49.620 --> 2:25:56.980]  where for 40 years since 9 11 and even before that we brought in an individual who's never
[2:25:56.980 --> 2:26:02.660]  been part of the system remember that this is the first time we've brought in a businessman
[2:26:03.220 --> 2:26:09.380]  and this is the first time in decades where a businessman said this is not correct we're not
[2:26:09.380 --> 2:26:15.460]  going to work in the system that's totally corrupt run by two parties which in fact are not two
[2:26:15.460 --> 2:26:20.900]  parties but totally involved with each other there was no sense that we're choosing either
[2:26:20.900 --> 2:26:27.060]  republican or democrat he then appointed all kinds of individuals who are individualists
[2:26:27.060 --> 2:26:33.060]  look at richard grinnell look at tamban beyondy these are not people who are part of the system
[2:26:33.060 --> 2:26:38.500]  they came into the system and they're fighting i didn't get picked but i understood what was
[2:26:38.500 --> 2:26:44.740]  happening and basically i was given let's say some permission to say what was going on
[2:26:44.740 --> 2:26:51.460]  whether i'm right or wrong is to be proven but i happen to be very clear in my message
[2:26:52.020 --> 2:27:00.500]  trump will win i would ask the people of america just to stay calm do what you're doing go to work
[2:27:00.500 --> 2:27:07.460]  let's get the economy back again i want all the small businesses to come up again this notion
[2:27:07.460 --> 2:27:14.740]  of the pandemic is nonsense oh that's right get into the pandemic fraud as a medical doctor
[2:27:14.740 --> 2:27:20.820]  explain people what's really going on well the medical fraud that you had a corona virus and
[2:27:20.820 --> 2:27:27.780]  you're going to die it's absolutely absurd what you die from usually is what we call a comorbidity
[2:27:27.780 --> 2:27:34.900]  so when you hear on the news that an 18 year old individual died from coronavirus that's not what
[2:27:34.900 --> 2:27:41.300]  happened the usually that individual had high blood pressure diabetes and other concerns the biggest
[2:27:41.300 --> 2:27:48.100]  concern we have in medicine in the united states close to a hundred million people are fat obese
[2:27:48.100 --> 2:27:53.700]  and if you look around you will notice that that's the biggest epidemic we had the biggest
[2:27:54.260 --> 2:28:01.380]  epidemic of infectious disease we conquered that was polio and sabin went to the soviet union
[2:28:01.380 --> 2:28:06.900]  he took out the blood of people who were affected by polio and then transmitted it back into our
[2:28:06.900 --> 2:28:14.980]  bloodlines that's what needs to be accounted for now we're not doing that fauci is a disaster cdc
[2:28:14.980 --> 2:28:23.860]  is a disaster m rna and astrazeneca that that's absolute nonsense monoclonal antibodies m rna
[2:28:23.860 --> 2:28:29.780]  will dissolve very quickly they're not effective vaccines anyway most people eight months ago
[2:28:29.780 --> 2:28:34.260]  they now admit it doesn't even give you real immunity so we can quote never leave our houses
[2:28:34.260 --> 2:28:39.300]  again and and and the head of the devil's group says it's about a carbon tax and locking us down
[2:28:39.300 --> 2:28:46.340]  they now admit it's about being prisoners this is insane well you know remember we're an alternative
[2:28:46.340 --> 2:28:51.780]  media there's no reason for anybody to believe me or believe you we don't really make a living out
[2:28:51.780 --> 2:28:58.500]  of this but the people in the big pharmaceuticals what we call they create what's called a dump
[2:28:58.500 --> 2:29:03.860]  a pump and dump in other words they make believe they have something they have absolutely nothing
[2:29:03.860 --> 2:29:10.740]  and then they dump their money and honestly when this is over i think trump should start going after
[2:29:11.300 --> 2:29:16.900]  all these big companies and break them apart and they've been out of control particularly in the
[2:29:17.460 --> 2:29:24.660]  nutritions in the in the pharmaceutical business and we know exactly who they are more importantly
[2:29:24.660 --> 2:29:31.460]  the coronavirus you listen to a george carlin video i grew up in new york the more exposed you are
[2:29:32.020 --> 2:29:39.780]  to pathogens to infections to dirt the better your immunity system nowhere in our theory
[2:29:39.780 --> 2:29:47.380]  do you put away a innocent or a non-infectious individual into a house that's not heard of
[2:29:47.380 --> 2:29:54.100]  that's nonsense and so what's happening is we created a whole fear this administration
[2:29:54.100 --> 2:30:00.740]  along with the biden's created an entire fear trump understood that he's backtracking on it
[2:30:00.740 --> 2:30:08.180]  Fauci will leave cdc will leave hhs will be taken down and this will be all part of the cleaning
[2:30:08.180 --> 2:30:15.540]  action it's time for you to go outside you're not going to die and we have to stop giving
[2:30:15.540 --> 2:30:21.620]  thirty five thousand dollars to every stupid hospital that claims somebody died of coronavirus
[2:30:21.620 --> 2:30:27.780]  when in fact there was comorbidity meaning there are other people in our area which the small town
[2:30:27.780 --> 2:30:36.260]  i people are 94 97 98 they come in they eat they don't wear masks they're fine so let's get real
[2:30:36.260 --> 2:30:42.340]  but swab admits it he says it's not a real threat he says it's great we're using it to cut carbon
[2:30:42.340 --> 2:30:48.900]  footprint and save the earth while he's super rich i mean this is insane that they just admit
[2:30:48.900 --> 2:30:52.500]  the crimes are committing what is the psychological point of that because you can say oh they're
[2:30:52.500 --> 2:30:59.220]  losers these are the richest guys on earth well let me put it this way you can only have so many
[2:30:59.220 --> 2:31:06.900]  dollars and basically they're not exactly what's happening is they're self-aggrandizing at a point
[2:31:06.900 --> 2:31:12.500]  at which it's nonsensical you know they're the savers of the earth and like like ramsey's ordering
[2:31:12.500 --> 2:31:16.900]  the first born of the israelis or the jews to be killed it's the same deal like you're just you
[2:31:16.900 --> 2:31:22.740]  have nothing i'm saving the earth but i have a jumbo jet correct i mean you know you can listen to
[2:31:22.740 --> 2:31:29.780]  all this nonsense but basically what's disappeared hollywood disappeared completely and at the same
[2:31:29.780 --> 2:31:34.980]  time you have the church disappeared so that's what you're saying is their system's collapsing they
[2:31:34.980 --> 2:31:41.460]  want to take us with them well that's pretty much it i left the council on foreign relation i left
[2:31:41.460 --> 2:31:47.140]  all that other nonsense the world economic forum i never belonged to it but if you have to belong
[2:31:47.140 --> 2:31:54.740]  to a group that has to self-aggrandize my advice is get out do your own thing build your own company
[2:31:54.740 --> 2:32:00.740]  don't worry take the risk and failure is part of capital well i agree with that statement so what is
[2:32:00.740 --> 2:32:05.780]  the corrupt inbred power church going to do when they in their own admissions say their time is over
[2:32:05.780 --> 2:32:10.180]  and and they don't know what to do so they want to annihilate all of us make us poor so they can be
[2:32:10.180 --> 2:32:16.660]  bigger than us that sounds like a recipe of disaster no they're not going to do anything basically
[2:32:16.660 --> 2:32:22.580]  will arrest a whole bunch of people but for the most part they will all disappear back into the
[2:32:22.580 --> 2:32:29.300]  woods or to the ground or the cemeteries wherever they come from but for the most part there's many
[2:32:29.300 --> 2:32:36.100]  institutions that will not be around the main press the tv shows all of that nonsense is gone
[2:32:36.100 --> 2:32:40.980]  hollywood that's right and in covid lockdown is a face saving because i know folks in hollywood
[2:32:40.980 --> 2:32:47.300]  they're telling them none of it's coming back it's all done well you better explain netflix
[2:32:47.300 --> 2:32:53.140]  who really avoided hollywood and is making a fortune and has nothing to do with hollywood
[2:32:53.140 --> 2:32:59.380]  because they are finished and basically the real problem for me is why haven't the christian churches
[2:32:59.380 --> 2:33:05.060]  and spokesmen come to the forefront that is for me a sad commentary they got bought off by the roth
[2:33:05.060 --> 2:33:10.020]  child rockefeller ecumenical movement all right steve patrenik.com find his books material there
[2:33:10.020 --> 2:33:15.860]  steve we really appreciate you thank you for all the time thank you and god bless you know what i
[2:33:15.860 --> 2:33:20.740]  just i kind of did a false start there a false ending come back i got one more question for you
[2:33:20.740 --> 2:33:25.300]  then phone calls and then we got jay dyer taking over i got a serious question because everybody's
[2:33:25.300 --> 2:33:30.020]  talking about election fraud and watermarks and i know those exist a secret service 30 years ago
[2:33:30.020 --> 2:33:33.860]  had it in printer ink and i know all that stuff so that's a real thing i wanted to get your take
[2:33:33.860 --> 2:33:44.180]  on that try to have a steeper tone cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left
[2:33:44.180 --> 2:33:50.020]  it can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept if you have a family member
[2:33:50.020 --> 2:33:55.540]  suffering from this degenerative mental condition buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from

[2:34:07.780 --> 2:34:14.020]  and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses and joints and the digestive system
[2:34:14.020 --> 2:34:21.380]  recent studies have suggested that high epa and dha fish oil can stimulate immune function by
[2:34:21.380 --> 2:34:27.860]  increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells it worked for my family and now
[2:34:27.860 --> 2:34:34.500]  i can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality get your
[2:34:34.500 --> 2:34:40.980]  ultimate fish oil for a friend family member or yourself at info wars store dot com the problem
[2:34:40.980 --> 2:34:48.900]  with social Darwinism is the so-called elites the most cunning smart inventive people believe
[2:34:48.900 --> 2:34:53.860]  that chivalry doesn't exist anymore they don't believe in being aristocrats trying to hold
[2:34:53.860 --> 2:34:59.700]  up civilization and power the people and once the establishment has that predatory idea civilization
[2:34:59.700 --> 2:35:04.500]  collapses very very quickly you can't treat the least of us like garbage and not treat your own
[2:35:04.500 --> 2:35:10.740]  family like that and so it is this lack of empathy that's going to destroy us the globalists can try
[2:35:10.740 --> 2:35:16.100]  to be heartless devil or spurs that commit rituals of all sorts of horrible crimes try to get away
[2:35:16.100 --> 2:35:20.740]  from a humanity but really they can't escape the laws of the universe they may train themselves to
[2:35:20.740 --> 2:35:27.060]  commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves but the repercussions of what they commit always
[2:35:27.060 --> 2:35:32.660]  comes back on them and their families and the very structure itself wealth is created by loving god
[2:35:32.660 --> 2:35:37.220]  wealth is created by having connection to god god is the source of all creation all success

[2:36:44.180 --> 2:36:50.020]  there's a headline on their site today that says there are disinformation groups and organizations
[2:36:50.020 --> 2:36:57.220]  saying joe biden is not president-elect well on its face he's not president-elect because
[2:36:57.940 --> 2:37:04.260]  the votes have not been certified by any of the 50 states and counting is still going on what in
[2:37:04.260 --> 2:37:11.060]  seven of the states and trump is gaining ground in all but one of them and then there's also going

[2:37:35.940 --> 2:37:40.740]  new world order system fit on keeping us locked down forever in an economic war bring us to our knees
[2:37:40.740 --> 2:37:56.660]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[2:38:35.140 --> 2:38:39.780]  in during the break i came to read it all trump is just axing all these people at the pentagon
[2:38:39.780 --> 2:38:45.300]  that are civilians and bringing in all these war heroes right now and again i see the pucker factor
[2:38:45.300 --> 2:38:49.700]  in msm they are visibly scared i've got videos of them learning that trump's winning states are
[2:38:49.700 --> 2:38:54.740]  like cussing on air and panicking uh i mean i just want to see more of this because it's our country
[2:38:54.740 --> 2:38:59.540]  i don't like authoritarianism i don't like military doing domestic actions unless a military and a
[2:38:59.540 --> 2:39:03.300]  foreign power is attacking me then i want the military in there and i cheer it on i mean
[2:39:03.300 --> 2:39:08.260]  we didn't bring ourselves to this point the globalist did i i just smell their destruction i smell
[2:39:08.260 --> 2:39:14.500]  blood right now we hear a good bloodhound i mean your Sherlock Holmes in that way i don't
[2:39:14.500 --> 2:39:20.500]  need it facetiously what you smell and what i had anticipated with a group of others
[2:39:21.060 --> 2:39:29.620]  is that we have a group of incredible generals you may not have heard of general keith alexander
[2:39:29.620 --> 2:39:36.980]  general boykin special forces general nakasone cyber command nsa i mean there's a whole group
[2:39:36.980 --> 2:39:43.780]  of them calling ag kernels i can't tell you the numbers and hundreds and thousands of men and
[2:39:43.780 --> 2:39:50.820]  women who have been involved in this in this whatever you want to call it project to make sure
[2:39:50.820 --> 2:39:57.060]  that our country and republic remains standing and viable what can the american and so this
[2:39:57.060 --> 2:40:03.860]  is simply this attempted steel is only going to escalate their action well in in a way yes but
[2:40:03.860 --> 2:40:09.620]  the best thing the american public can do is support trump show that support and go out and
[2:40:09.620 --> 2:40:16.340]  demonstrate and say i still believe in trump you go back to work we need this economy to increase
[2:40:16.340 --> 2:40:22.740]  to go back and build those businesses that were taken down for whatever reason and let's go and
[2:40:22.740 --> 2:40:29.380]  start the main enemy action shut our economy off so we need to stop that that the the thrust of
[2:40:29.380 --> 2:40:36.500]  america is really a capitalist economy that's why most of the people in big tech can say whatever
[2:40:36.500 --> 2:40:44.180]  they want they will be broken up in time their proposition 230 is going to be reinstituted they're
[2:40:44.180 --> 2:40:51.060]  going to be liable they're going to be broken up they know that it's just a simple question of time
[2:40:51.060 --> 2:40:56.900]  before google gets broken up facebook is broken up dorsey's going to pay a heavy price for what he
[2:40:56.900 --> 2:41:03.620]  did on twitter and what he did on square so all of that will come about as trump comes in there
[2:41:03.620 --> 2:41:10.660]  are people who are working in all parts of this country to keep the republic safe have faith in
[2:41:10.660 --> 2:41:17.700]  that republic continue to support alex jones support project veritas all those alternative
[2:41:17.700 --> 2:41:23.620]  media those are important i can't tell you how important the communication has been because
[2:41:23.620 --> 2:41:30.500]  the main street media has blocked us completely hollywood of course is blackmailed me completely i
[2:41:30.500 --> 2:41:36.980]  can't do anything there and i wouldn't but my point to you is you do not give up you go out
[2:41:36.980 --> 2:41:42.420]  you show your faith in the republic if you want to show the american flag with trump that's fine
[2:41:42.420 --> 2:41:49.300]  i will guarantee you my career in my future trump will be the next president of the united states for
[2:41:49.300 --> 2:41:59.380]  the next eight years not only four years it will be eight years polosi uh feinstein uh all the others
[2:41:59.380 --> 2:42:04.260]  are going to go down and they're either going to leave or they're going to be taken out schumer
[2:42:04.820 --> 2:42:10.180]  all the rest came out of california by the way you don't hear the voting in california do you
[2:42:10.180 --> 2:42:16.420]  if it turns out to be a red state which it may well be you're going to be very surprised but
[2:42:16.420 --> 2:42:22.020]  do not be surprised that trump remains in power and be and remains as a president of the united
[2:42:22.020 --> 2:42:26.820]  states well i'm really upset about these contact tracers where you've been tested you gotta have
[2:42:26.820 --> 2:42:30.900]  to go to a restaurant or a concert they're trying to bring in the global social credit score i mean
[2:42:30.900 --> 2:42:36.580]  big tech is just out of control yeah it's always been out of control but if you really believe that
[2:42:36.580 --> 2:42:43.140]  those tests are effective in any way i don't know i don't even take the i i can't recommend it but i
[2:42:43.140 --> 2:42:48.260]  don't take the flu vaccine because 50 of the time they're not correct they don't know which
[2:42:48.260 --> 2:42:54.820]  flu comes in so it's up to you to decide as a doctor i would say there's a lot of misinformation
[2:42:54.820 --> 2:43:00.020]  here and there's a lot of miscreant behavior going on in the different high tech let me raise that
[2:43:00.020 --> 2:43:04.500]  question trump tries to come up with the fizer when they say he's 90 effective obviously it's
[2:43:04.500 --> 2:43:09.060]  got side effects it's got issues i'm not promoting it but they want to push their m r and a so suddenly
[2:43:09.060 --> 2:43:13.860]  they say take the vaccine he's proven right he has it on time they admit they held it up to make
[2:43:13.860 --> 2:43:17.700]  trump look bad and then they turn that into oh vaccines aren't safe but take ours
[2:43:22.020 --> 2:43:29.060]  well you gotta remember one thing i can control the public any public by creating fear
[2:43:29.060 --> 2:43:35.700]  here in this case we created fear fear was created by saying you know you have a virus
[2:43:36.420 --> 2:43:42.420]  that may not exist and if you do not put a mask on your face or what we consider a diaper
[2:43:42.980 --> 2:43:49.620]  like diaper biden who puts it on and it's just ludicrous then you will contaminate others and
[2:43:49.620 --> 2:43:55.620]  you will become sick yourself now you understand how mueslini came to power you understand how
[2:43:55.620 --> 2:44:01.940]  hitler came to power and you understand how stalin comes to power it's very easy lesson create fear
[2:44:01.940 --> 2:44:09.540]  manipulate the fear be able to assuage the fear and force everybody to act accordingly there you
[2:44:09.540 --> 2:44:17.380]  are basically your mask is the sign of acquiescence and stupidity for me i mean you know you can have
[2:44:17.380 --> 2:44:22.260]  other doctors say what they want but from my point of view the mask does nothing and the
[2:44:22.260 --> 2:44:27.780]  military knows that and if anything the mask has been a real problem well beyond that thing
[2:44:27.780 --> 2:44:34.180]  what about the studies of 1970 1918 flew that most of the deaths were from bacterial pneumonia
[2:44:34.180 --> 2:44:40.100]  they think they were incubated in the mass correct i agree with that number one i said to you
[2:44:40.980 --> 2:44:46.820]  well a year ago that i had the coronavirus and how did i treat it was it for max basically it
[2:44:46.820 --> 2:44:52.980]  was a bacteria that came in after the virus and i was able to not get out when you wear a mask
[2:44:52.980 --> 2:44:58.900]  and that's the spanish flu and all the other flutes you basically create your own critical
[2:44:58.900 --> 2:45:06.260]  mass of bacteria where you will in fact in fact become a victim of pneumonia or bacteria so so
[2:45:06.260 --> 2:45:10.660]  dr let's be clear i mean let's be clear your harvard mt educated but i could read the studies
[2:45:10.660 --> 2:45:16.980]  myself fauci publish one 2008 saying wearing a mask during viral infection the viruses cause lesions
[2:45:16.980 --> 2:45:21.860]  bacteria there bacteria carry and more viruses you wear a mask it lets them incubate and blow back
[2:45:21.860 --> 2:45:27.380]  in uh and that oxygen is what's killing them so by suppressing that up in carbon dioxide you're
[2:45:27.380 --> 2:45:31.860]  allowing them to spread that's what the study says so when they put us in mass they're trying to
[2:45:31.860 --> 2:45:37.300]  cause a higher death toll because there's no way they're just that dumb yes they are my friend
[2:45:37.300 --> 2:45:44.100]  you're the one who just explained the entire rational approach to this you just said it correctly
[2:45:44.100 --> 2:45:49.780]  the mass will create the bacteria and will create the problem that you're trying to avoid there's

[2:48:28.260 --> 2:48:34.980]  ahead the controlled corporate media are mouthpieces for any big corporation or government that'll
[2:48:34.980 --> 2:48:40.820]  pay them it's that simple and then use our open free society against us the controlled media will
[2:48:40.820 --> 2:48:45.860]  talk about a few mistakes i've made over the years and obsess over and say see he's a liar on purpose
[2:48:45.860 --> 2:48:51.700]  even though our success rate our accuracy rate is way way better than theirs we try to tell the truth
[2:48:51.700 --> 2:48:56.820]  they try to lie they try to deceive i'm trying to get people to realize that the globalist operate
[2:48:56.820 --> 2:49:02.900]  how they manipulate how they bamboozle the public i'm trying to get the public to ask
[2:49:02.900 --> 2:49:08.980]  questions and do not believe what they're told in the face i'm trying to get people to research
[2:49:08.980 --> 2:49:14.420]  for themselves the globalists and their controlled corporate press say that researching and not
[2:49:14.420 --> 2:49:21.140]  trusting media is evil and is a conspiracy theory but again on its face that is a fraud question
[2:49:21.140 --> 2:49:25.140]  everything question info wars add your own research to it and then decide what you're
[2:49:25.140 --> 2:49:29.540]  going to promote to others and what new sources are accurate i believe info wars is the best source
[2:49:29.540 --> 2:49:36.180]  out there communist china has been fully open for business for more than six months but the european
[2:49:36.180 --> 2:49:41.300]  union and every other major western nation is still under some form of lockdown and the lockdowns
[2:49:41.300 --> 2:49:45.300]  are getting more intense and people are being told they're going to be arrested and they leave
[2:49:45.300 --> 2:49:51.860]  their houses just like we've seen in australia you see the authoritarians want total control
[2:49:51.860 --> 2:49:56.260]  and because they don't respect this because the general public puts up with so much abuse
[2:49:56.260 --> 2:50:00.980]  they're going for broke why shouldn't they they never get in trouble for the big illegal wars
[2:50:00.980 --> 2:50:05.300]  they never get in trouble for the chinese slave camps they never get in trouble for all the terrible
[2:50:05.300 --> 2:50:10.020]  exploitation in africa they never get in trouble for shipping fentanyl and other deadly drugs into
[2:50:10.020 --> 2:50:16.020]  our country and so why shouldn't they go for broke because so many people are domesticated and
[2:50:16.020 --> 2:50:21.060]  they're soft and they have stock home syndrome they love their abusers they can't believe they're
[2:50:21.060 --> 2:50:26.500]  being lied to they can't believe they're being conned and so they're going into bondage you see
[2:50:26.500 --> 2:50:36.660]  there's always a minority that says no and enforces that minority you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:49.700 --> 2:50:52.900]  welcome back to the alex jones show on your guest host
[2:50:52.900 --> 2:50:59.860]  for this final hour j dire of jaysanalysis.com and since alex and paul joseph watson did a really
[2:50:59.860 --> 2:51:06.340]  great interview yesterday covering what clow swab of the davos world economic forum cabal has been
[2:51:06.340 --> 2:51:10.980]  saying lately i thought we could do a little bit of rehearsal right we would get back into what
[2:51:10.980 --> 2:51:16.020]  clow said and also touch on some of the other statements from the world economic forum let's
[2:51:16.020 --> 2:51:20.900]  talk about the video that they put out first because this really encapsulates everything in
[2:51:20.900 --> 2:51:26.660]  one brief clip i don't know if you guys have that ready but if we if we walk through this video if
[2:51:26.660 --> 2:51:32.740]  we can pull that up what we're going to see is eight points that they laid out back in 2016
[2:51:33.620 --> 2:51:40.100]  and these eight points are going to show every single thing that will be the new order in essence
[2:51:40.100 --> 2:51:46.740]  that is the technocracy in full play all laid out in this two minute video that by the way went viral
[2:51:46.740 --> 2:51:51.780]  in the last few days and in the world economic forum deleted this this this clip so the first
[2:51:51.780 --> 2:51:58.340]  thing that they mentioned if we can pull that up in this video is if not i can look at my copy of it
[2:51:59.620 --> 2:52:06.980]  it starts out by saying that the us will not be a an economic superpower right so
[2:52:08.020 --> 2:52:14.660]  the us is going to decline the us is going to experience possibly some sort of reintegration
[2:52:14.660 --> 2:52:20.180]  into a global federation as claus himself says in his books so remember this is the head of the
[2:52:20.180 --> 2:52:26.340]  world economic forum davos claus schwaab is the guy behind this whole uh this whole project here
[2:52:26.340 --> 2:52:30.980]  and he works with the top elites remember we looked at davos for many years the elites that
[2:52:30.980 --> 2:52:35.460]  go to davos very similar to more of a public version of bill derbergh that kind of a thing
[2:52:36.420 --> 2:52:40.980]  but you'll you'll notice it right away they said we've got to target the us the us has to be destroyed
[2:52:40.980 --> 2:52:47.220]  has to decline and then he ultimately says be reintegrated into some form of global federate
[2:52:47.220 --> 2:52:52.340]  federation the next point he says is that there will be a handful of companies countries that
[2:52:52.340 --> 2:52:59.460]  will dominate um you will now be subject to some group of of countries that they select
[2:52:59.460 --> 2:53:04.180]  right presumably china and other uh countries i think it was kissender said that said that
[2:53:04.180 --> 2:53:08.980]  china is the future that the chinese century according to the globalist right so that's
[2:53:08.980 --> 2:53:13.860]  what you're going to submit to uh the un together with china together with the i and that together
[2:53:13.860 --> 2:53:20.420]  with the world economic forum they're all going to come together and decide what the global policies
[2:53:20.420 --> 2:53:25.460]  will be and of course those countries are themselves fronts for bigger families and
[2:53:25.460 --> 2:53:30.180]  bigger operations that have been subverting those countries for a long time all the way back to
[2:53:31.620 --> 2:53:37.220]  the os s if you if you read bill donovan if you look at the declassified documents of the cia how
[2:53:37.220 --> 2:53:43.220]  the os s went and trained maus gorillas and they set up the present-day communist system
[2:53:43.780 --> 2:53:47.300]  that was done by the rockefeller decision that was not done by
[2:53:48.180 --> 2:53:54.900]  organic communist revolutionaries on the ground right um the next point that they make that you
[2:53:54.900 --> 2:53:59.460]  may have forgotten about but we haven't forgotten about it because i cover all these global elite
[2:53:59.460 --> 2:54:05.060]  books is diet a long long time ago plato said that diet is one of the things that you have to
[2:54:05.060 --> 2:54:10.420]  attack you have to attack people's food supply because that's a basic function of energy and
[2:54:10.420 --> 2:54:16.740]  the economy right in society is people eating to do the slave labor that they're going to do
[2:54:16.740 --> 2:54:24.100]  and they don't want you to be healthy and fit and of course the most nutrient optimal diet for
[2:54:24.100 --> 2:54:30.180]  human being is meat and meat fats and so they want to first and foremost get rid of meat
[2:54:30.180 --> 2:54:36.340]  why do you think so many of these global elitists in the last two years have poured billions of
[2:54:36.340 --> 2:54:44.580]  dollars into veganism into the vegan cult into banning meat into fake meat into making poop
[2:54:44.580 --> 2:54:50.660]  meat i'm not joking by the way that's a bill gates project he actually wants you to eat sh you know
[2:54:50.660 --> 2:54:58.100]  what literally um and so you've got all these other elitists that want to reorganize the human
[2:54:58.100 --> 2:55:03.460]  diet and we'll see why that's so important in claus's book here in a minute but uh that's one
[2:55:03.460 --> 2:55:08.500]  of the fortune 100 especially the food companies and by the way remember there's a couple companies
[2:55:08.500 --> 2:55:15.300]  that control like 90 of food distribution now like four or five major corporations that control all
[2:55:15.300 --> 2:55:21.460]  food and so you have to understand that that's a key way to attack the population to to dumb them
[2:55:21.460 --> 2:55:28.340]  down and to make them weak as play doh said uh many centuries ago in the republic uh i want to
[2:55:28.340 --> 2:55:34.020]  remind you to be sure and support info wars buy their supplements go to the info wars store
[2:55:34.020 --> 2:55:38.260]  and uh we'll be back in just a second i'm j dire this is the outskirts show

[2:56:49.860 --> 2:57:00.020]  well you've got your dine welcome back to me on my social media outlets while i'm still there
[2:57:00.020 --> 2:57:06.020]  um and then you can check me out on parlor as well we were talking about klaus Schwab
[2:57:06.020 --> 2:57:13.060]  davos world economic forum and them basically uncloaking right just like uh hydra if you watched
[2:57:13.060 --> 2:57:18.980]  you know the marvel series more recently with the avengers and captain america you know the hydra
[2:57:18.980 --> 2:57:24.740]  was like this shady institution that was international that was planning all these kinds of depopulation
[2:57:24.740 --> 2:57:30.180]  operations and surveillance and putting into place ai that would basically run the planet
[2:57:30.180 --> 2:57:36.020]  and that's what we're talking about here we're talking about specter that's real right imagine
[2:57:36.020 --> 2:57:41.060]  james bond you know he's fighting specter all these years but in reality james bond works for
[2:57:41.060 --> 2:57:47.060]  specter okay james bond is the agent of specter and that's what we're looking at here is is you
[2:57:47.060 --> 2:57:51.780]  could look at the world economic forum davos literally like specter if you if you saw the
[2:57:51.780 --> 2:57:57.780]  uh the uh actual recent bond film specter from a few years ago you remember there's that scene
[2:57:57.780 --> 2:58:03.380]  where they're all sitting in some place in rome and it's like this darkly lit room this big palace
[2:58:03.380 --> 2:58:07.380]  that they're sitting in or whatever and they're they're reading over like the recent reports from
[2:58:07.380 --> 2:58:14.020]  black markets and it's like mr blofeld's uh we've got uh 23 million people uh trafficked in human
[2:58:14.020 --> 2:58:20.580]  trafficking operations were up five percent from last year yes so we've got 75 uh million uh added
[2:58:20.580 --> 2:58:24.820]  in bonus uh drug trafficking blah blah so they just go through all these stats about the black
[2:58:24.820 --> 2:58:30.900]  markets and that's what we're talking about here is literally a gigantic secret octopus that runs
[2:58:31.460 --> 2:58:37.220]  all of this stuff and their goal and there you go exactly that's the perfect analogy to
[2:58:37.860 --> 2:58:45.700]  a cloud swab right and so their their plan is now fully in the open it's not a conspiracy
[2:58:45.700 --> 2:58:54.420]  um it's not a a theory it's all a plane in there by the way they deleted this tweet this this this
[2:58:54.420 --> 2:59:00.980]  sequence of uh uh claims in this video this plan that we're talking about they deleted this and the
[2:59:00.980 --> 2:59:05.940]  reason they deleted is because it went viral somebody dug this up from the 2016 clip from the
[2:59:05.940 --> 2:59:11.780]  world economic forum it literally says by the way it's not just oh maybe it'll be like this in the tech
[2:59:11.780 --> 2:59:18.740]  uh utopia when we bring in this utopia uh no no this is a plan right and they're already
[2:59:18.740 --> 2:59:25.140]  implementing this now and it's not a utopia it's a dystopia the next thing they say is that you're
[2:59:25.140 --> 2:59:31.380]  going to have to do a better job at uh experiencing open borders and reintegration of foreign
[2:59:31.380 --> 2:59:38.500]  populations now this is an older technique of uh economic and social warfare right which
[2:59:38.500 --> 2:59:43.140]  where you use migrant populations there's a whole book there's there's actually war college
[2:59:43.140 --> 2:59:48.020]  pentagon books on this kelly greenhill wrote a book called weapons of mass migration it's a well
[2:59:48.020 --> 2:59:52.820]  known strategy it's an ancient technique of warfare where you can flood a people group an
[2:59:52.820 --> 2:59:58.340]  existing people group with foreign people groups to disrupt the economy and one easy way to to see
[2:59:58.340 --> 3:00:04.500]  that disruption is uh the stresses that it puts on the existing welfare system but now you can see
[3:00:04.500 --> 3:00:11.540]  why clower and piven this kind of stuff the model is to have more and more welfare and then that puts
[3:00:11.540 --> 3:00:19.300]  a strain on the taxation of the population then feeding into uh the new uh in in moving population
[3:00:19.300 --> 3:00:22.900]  the migrant population it's a form of warfare and that's why you see you know people like
[3:00:22.900 --> 3:00:28.660]  erdogan threatening to to send migrants into uh countries that don't for example do what he wants
[3:00:28.660 --> 3:00:37.940]  to do so you what you're seeing here is the elite themselves saying that it's a full spectrum plan
[3:00:38.980 --> 3:00:45.300]  it's every area of life it's not a conspiracy theory it's the elite themselves saying it's a
[3:00:45.300 --> 3:00:53.940]  full spectrum plan openly a million plus people watch this video time magazine has a cover right
[3:00:53.940 --> 3:01:01.700]  now the great reset and and you've got half of the population thinks this is a conspiracy theory
[3:01:02.420 --> 3:01:08.260]  they think this is crazy well it's not going to be crazy when claus gets his way and when you start
[3:01:08.260 --> 3:01:14.340]  to see the things that claus talks about we're seeing it now right claus talked about shaping
[3:01:14.340 --> 3:01:19.300]  the future and the the revolution that we're going through right now two or three years ago in this
[3:01:19.300 --> 3:01:25.220]  book and then he wrote wrote a book recently on covet he says covet is the perfect thing
[3:01:25.220 --> 3:01:31.220]  to bring in what we want it's the great reset it's the catalyst for the great reset now what's the
[3:01:31.220 --> 3:01:37.540]  great reset well let's go back to our our our series of slides here from this video the next
[3:01:37.540 --> 3:01:43.460]  thing they talk about is polluters what do they mean by polluters well they're talking about the
[3:01:43.460 --> 3:01:48.340]  existing american economy right they're not talking about pollution in other countries and
[3:01:48.340 --> 3:01:53.060]  they're not even talking about pollution they're talking about quote carbon right which is basic
[3:01:53.060 --> 3:01:58.740]  life forms in other words remember every time you see the carbon tax that's a tax on life
[3:01:58.740 --> 3:02:04.980]  that's what it actually means so taxing life you're gonna have to pay life tax to the international
[3:02:04.980 --> 3:02:11.460]  elite to the bankers and this also is an attack on the economy right it's an attack on the existing
[3:02:11.460 --> 3:02:17.780]  structure the existing economy to weaken the us so that it can be integrated into this global
[3:02:17.780 --> 3:02:22.260]  power structure and that's what so many of these leftists and so many of these these the control
[3:02:22.260 --> 3:02:27.620]  freaks the the the the students out on the streets the 50 million americans who think that they're
[3:02:27.620 --> 3:02:35.300]  going to get all this free crap it's not free crap and it's slavery and it's always been the case
[3:02:35.300 --> 3:02:40.420]  that yeah you can have theoretically a local welfare system but when the decentralized federal
[3:02:40.420 --> 3:02:46.500]  government tries to have welfare for the entire country right since what lbj is great society
[3:02:46.500 --> 3:02:51.620]  project and now there's going to be a global welfare system that they're calling the the the
[3:02:52.260 --> 3:02:57.460]  a credit system the social credit score at the universal basic income all the tech elites are
[3:02:57.460 --> 3:03:04.020]  saying this this is insane and in fact claus even says in this book that they're going to make sure
[3:03:04.020 --> 3:03:11.220]  that when they lock down all natural resources including water they're going to say they're
[3:03:11.220 --> 3:03:18.020]  saying we're going to ration it to you you see based on a new set of values which he calls the new
[3:03:18.020 --> 3:03:22.740]  covenant i'm not joking that's what he says in his book he says it's a new religious covenant
[3:03:22.740 --> 3:03:27.620]  he doesn't use the word religion but what is a covenant it's religious it's from the bible
[3:03:28.580 --> 3:03:35.060]  this new covenant will have an ai system that will ration to everyone what they think is the
[3:03:35.060 --> 3:03:42.340]  fair amount of water what's the fair amount of resources and that's why as we'll see in a minute
[3:03:42.340 --> 3:03:46.180]  he says that you're not going to own anything and this is not just him this is some of the
[3:03:46.180 --> 3:03:52.820]  wealthiest people on the planet talking about just basic bitch communism right now they're not
[3:03:52.820 --> 3:03:58.740]  communists they have yachts they have palaces they have underground fortresses like you know
[3:03:58.740 --> 3:04:04.100]  blow fellers you know bond villains no no this is for you this is for everyone else right you're
[3:04:04.100 --> 3:04:07.300]  not going to get the transhumanist stuff you're not going to get the technic this is for them
[3:04:08.340 --> 3:04:15.220]  in their family and their elite groups and that's why it's so sickening is the hypocrisy of these
[3:04:15.220 --> 3:04:22.820]  people right to uh openly own you know palaces yachts private jets you know basically these
[3:04:22.820 --> 3:04:30.180]  corporations have uh their own gdp above many small countries right but they want to enforce
[3:04:30.180 --> 3:04:37.140]  this communistic type of system for the masses and on top of this communistic layer for the masses
[3:04:37.140 --> 3:04:43.060]  there's a fascistic system of technocratic control right so you've got a a sort of quasi fascist
[3:04:43.060 --> 3:04:47.620]  system of the technocracy that's in a public private partnership with the corporations the
[3:04:47.620 --> 3:04:54.900]  fortune 100 enforcing a communistic egalitarian so-called system uh below that where everybody
[3:04:54.900 --> 3:05:01.140]  gets a fair and equal redistribution of resources and what's based on need right what was marx's
[3:05:01.140 --> 3:05:05.620]  famous uh you know dictum about whatever uh to each his own right based on your needs
[3:05:06.660 --> 3:05:11.300]  and then above that is the elite themselves so you've got this basic pyramidal structure of
[3:05:12.180 --> 3:05:19.620]  of a not bound by any laws crop of billionaires and more elites up here the fascistic system of
[3:05:19.620 --> 3:05:23.700]  the tech control here in the middle that pretends to be in place like it's liberal and all this
[3:05:23.700 --> 3:05:31.060]  nonsense and then the sort of communistic shared economy for everybody down below that's almost
[3:05:31.060 --> 3:05:36.100]  like Plato's pyramid except that the middle structure of Plato's pyramid was at least
[3:05:36.660 --> 3:05:43.380]  guardian class warriors right they at least had some sort of noble courage but for the for the masses
[3:05:43.380 --> 3:05:48.820]  everything had to be kind of you know completely controlled and totally under a technocratic idea
[3:05:48.820 --> 3:05:55.460]  but if we look back at the list here from the wef the next thing they say is that and this was
[3:05:55.460 --> 3:06:00.980]  an odd one that i that they threw in there and this could speak to where the next phase of this
[3:06:00.980 --> 3:06:05.460]  program goes in the next five or ten years it's it's entirely possible that they could come up with
[3:06:05.460 --> 3:06:12.260]  some alien mythology some alien nonsense right where they're going to say oh yes we were we were
[3:06:12.260 --> 3:06:18.020]  seated here by uh you know space visitors and all this nonsense and that's the new mythology
[3:06:18.020 --> 3:06:23.300]  or the new religion you know something new agey darwin uh alien or something that's what that's
[3:06:23.300 --> 3:06:27.860]  what claus is talking about here right scientists will have worked out a way to keep you healthy
[3:06:27.860 --> 3:06:35.620]  in space oh you're gonna fly around like kirk and uh you know spock in space it's going to be utopia
[3:06:35.620 --> 3:06:52.820]  right maybe we'll find aliens now it's easier than ever to have band dot video on your iphone

[3:08:28.580 --> 3:08:54.580]  head to infowarstore.com today you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:54.580 --> 3:09:08.980]  on this fourth hour we were talking about the list in the sequence of world economic forum plans
[3:09:08.980 --> 3:09:16.820]  the next in this list was the perhaps discovery of alien life and that humans perhaps were seeded
[3:09:16.820 --> 3:09:22.580]  right by aliens called panspermia and many of the scientific elite for a long time have been
[3:09:22.580 --> 3:09:28.420]  obsessed with this idea many of them have even written white paper reports there was a 1960s
[3:09:28.420 --> 3:09:34.660]  brookings institute paper that said if we promote the idea of alien life and that that's the origin
[3:09:34.660 --> 3:09:41.700]  of perhaps humanity then we can replace the christian biblical values of the west that's
[3:09:41.700 --> 3:09:49.060]  literally what the paper says and so they know from a psychological warfare standpoint that
[3:09:49.060 --> 3:09:55.380]  you can manipulate the mass mind and the belief systems the worldview with these kinds of plans
[3:09:55.380 --> 3:10:01.300]  with these kinds of projects in fact i just tweeted out the a couple days ago a declassified
[3:10:01.300 --> 3:10:08.740]  document about the ci using religious warfare to manipulate worldviews right so using doctrines
[3:10:08.740 --> 3:10:16.820]  using religious ideas twisting them basically playing on divisive areas of different religious
[3:10:16.820 --> 3:10:21.540]  states and nations to split the countries to divide and i think that's what we're seeing here if you
[3:10:21.540 --> 3:10:26.660]  look at for example the roman cali church what is happening in the roman cali church with the
[3:10:26.660 --> 3:10:32.660]  letters that begano and other people have been writing to to trump that you're seeing a split
[3:10:32.660 --> 3:10:39.860]  down the middle over this controversial radical statements of frances who obviously aligns with
[3:10:39.860 --> 3:10:44.180]  clousin all the rest of the globalists right and so the the goal there split that group down the
[3:10:44.180 --> 3:10:49.140]  middle right the roman cali church down the middle the orthodox church the same the same
[3:10:49.140 --> 3:10:54.260]  situation going on split it down the middle especially over the drama in the ukraine the
[3:10:54.260 --> 3:11:00.660]  ci supporting that schism in the ukraine so the orthodox church then is to be split down the middle
[3:11:00.660 --> 3:11:06.740]  and what's happening in the us the democrats the the radicals that are that are involved in this
[3:11:06.740 --> 3:11:09.860]  coup that they've been talking about for months and months and months they said they would do a
[3:11:09.860 --> 3:11:14.500]  coup and here they are doing it they're splitting the u.s. down the middle they want to divide it
[3:11:14.500 --> 3:11:20.660]  they want to get everybody at each other's throats and so this method is very useful it's
[3:11:20.660 --> 3:11:24.820]  classic right this this dividing i'm not just saying dividing conquer it's more sophisticated
[3:11:24.820 --> 3:11:30.900]  than that because it's not just divide and get everybody each other's throats it's also about
[3:11:30.900 --> 3:11:36.740]  the reintegration into the bigger global technocratic picture and that's why the next in
[3:11:36.740 --> 3:11:43.940]  claus's list here from the economic forum is point eight western values will have to be
[3:11:43.940 --> 3:11:52.420]  tested to the breaking point tested to the breaking point in other words we want to break it
[3:11:52.420 --> 3:11:57.380]  we're going to break the west right and if you know the mindset of the global league that's
[3:11:57.380 --> 3:12:00.420]  what he means there i guarantee you that's what they're talking about they're not just saying
[3:12:00.420 --> 3:12:04.980]  oh we're going to test it to see if it works and if it if it works we'll let it continue
[3:12:04.980 --> 3:12:14.980]  no no break it break it and so they're saying the existing system and that's what uh if you saw in
[3:12:14.980 --> 3:12:22.100]  fact there was a recent podcast that claus himself did with none other than prince trawls
[3:12:22.660 --> 3:12:27.700]  claus and prince trawls they did they're doing their own little podcast together right imagine
[3:12:27.700 --> 3:12:34.020]  the prince of england right oh let's do a podcast let's do a podcast class and let's talk about how
[3:12:34.020 --> 3:12:38.980]  to kill everyone right that's what they're doing right and claus says yes we're going to kill some
[3:12:38.980 --> 3:12:47.460]  more in this podcast they talk about the fact that the existing system of the world capitalism as
[3:12:47.460 --> 3:12:52.900]  we know it has to go away it doesn't work and there's a lot of people who have criticisms of
[3:12:52.900 --> 3:12:58.340]  monopolistic capitalism of uh you know finance capitalism and all that and you can have those
[3:12:58.340 --> 3:13:02.420]  criticisms but but here's my problem i had a liberal friend of mine from a long long time
[3:13:02.420 --> 3:13:06.740]  liberal friend the other day he was arguing with me he says he says you don't like these
[3:13:06.740 --> 3:13:11.300]  elites that run things right now they're rich aren't you going to be happy when their system
[3:13:11.300 --> 3:13:17.460]  goes away and i said don't you understand they're not bringing in a nice better system right for
[3:13:17.460 --> 3:13:21.700]  all the problems in the existing system what they're bringing in is going to be 10 times worse
[3:13:22.420 --> 3:13:27.700]  that's what i'm trying to tell you right this is not going to be good for 99 of the people
[3:13:27.700 --> 3:13:35.140]  this is going to be good for 0.001 percent of the elite the 6 000 managerial class that
[3:13:35.140 --> 3:13:40.100]  rothkopf talked about who work underneath these global leaders that's who it's going to be good
[3:13:40.100 --> 3:13:46.340]  for and that's what claus is talking about he says this system these ideas that that create
[3:13:46.340 --> 3:13:52.900]  middle-class wealth and energy that's got to go away and we can't put our system into place which
[3:13:52.900 --> 3:13:59.060]  is a calm down control system under the cloak of liberalism and democracy we can't put that into
[3:13:59.060 --> 3:14:04.660]  place until we get rid of this largely energized middle class right that has to go away now i'm
[3:14:04.660 --> 3:14:09.220]  not saying that everything about the middle class is perfect i'm just saying that for them to bring
[3:14:09.220 --> 3:14:14.820]  in the next phase the previous phase has to die and that's what their whole podcast was about
[3:14:14.820 --> 3:14:23.380]  their whole podcast was him and brit strolls was look we need to reset because the existing system
[3:14:23.380 --> 3:14:27.700]  has problems and what they'll do is hype all the problems in the existing system many of which
[3:14:27.700 --> 3:14:33.380]  they create and promote they like the problems the chaos right never let a good crisis go to waste
[3:14:33.380 --> 3:14:38.660]  arc of crisis according to brzezinski they love the crises so that they can point to the crises and
[3:14:38.660 --> 3:14:44.660]  say look at how bad you are look at all of your over consumption look at all of you people having
[3:14:44.660 --> 3:14:51.300]  kids eating meat don't you feel guilty right it's a guilt manipulation tactic and then they say
[3:14:51.860 --> 3:14:55.620]  we're going to fix that for you we're going to help you out because we love you even though we
[3:14:55.620 --> 3:15:00.900]  want to kill everybody we love you still right we're going to put in a system that's fair
[3:15:02.420 --> 3:15:07.060]  you remember when all the covet stuff started what a what a bill gates saying all of his interviews
[3:15:07.060 --> 3:15:12.020]  oh we want to bring in a system that's fair we're going to fairly distribute every fairly
[3:15:12.020 --> 3:15:17.700]  distribute billions of dollars this guy has billions of dollars is he going to fairly
[3:15:17.700 --> 3:15:24.820]  distribute any of those billions to you of course not he's talking about you the upper middle class
[3:15:24.820 --> 3:15:30.900]  the wealthy class he's talking about taking their money and redistributing it taking your tax money
[3:15:30.900 --> 3:15:37.380]  and redistributing it it's such an obvious scam and it's amazing to me how many people especially
[3:15:37.380 --> 3:15:43.380]  boomers all these boomers that voted for biden that are falling for this well he's going to give me
[3:15:43.380 --> 3:15:48.100]  i'm going to get my my free stuff i'm going to get my medicines i'm going to get my meds now it's
[3:15:48.100 --> 3:15:52.020]  trump that was actually working to get you your meds right boomers on like 20 different meds you
[3:15:52.020 --> 3:15:56.100]  go to a boomers medicine counter they got like 50 meds up there right now you want all those meds
[3:15:56.100 --> 3:16:01.380]  wasn't it trump that was working to give those medicines for you for a cheaper price and you
[3:16:01.380 --> 3:16:07.540]  want to go under biden who says he wants to tank the entire western economy by getting rid of oil
[3:16:07.540 --> 3:16:12.820]  what are you crazy what i mean it's it's mind boggling right i mean
[3:16:16.020 --> 3:16:23.860]  and claus says claus says together with the united nations the imf bill gates and microsoft
[3:16:23.860 --> 3:16:31.300]  bp and other companies we're going to initiate a reset where we heard of the idea of a reset
[3:16:32.260 --> 3:16:38.180]  if you study the french revolution then you know that they had this idea that they could do a reset
[3:16:39.300 --> 3:16:46.020]  where when they destroyed all the existing culture of france they could erect a new society
[3:16:46.020 --> 3:16:51.860]  and by the new society they don't just mean a better running system they're talking about everything
[3:16:51.860 --> 3:16:57.540]  else that you had going away now you understand why they get rid of landmarks and monuments
[3:16:58.260 --> 3:17:04.020]  all of that has to wipe away it's a reset it's a delete on your history on your tradition on your
[3:17:04.020 --> 3:17:09.300]  heritage all that goes away that's the delete the delete button and then one of the french
[3:17:09.300 --> 3:17:15.220]  revolutionaries do they instituted a new calendar because the calendar is religious you christmas
[3:17:15.220 --> 3:17:21.940]  east or this kind of stuff they put in a new calendar of these weird made-up holidays like thermidor
[3:17:21.940 --> 3:17:27.140]  atheist holidays and you can't make this up atheist holidays that are just made-up names
[3:17:27.140 --> 3:17:33.540]  thermidor what like is that right this is jay dive jays now since you're listening to the alex
[3:17:33.540 --> 3:17:40.340]  jones show we'll be back in just a moment warning warning warning there is not long to stop the
[3:17:40.340 --> 3:17:46.260]  complete martial law takeover the giant third world collapse and a new world war that is
[3:17:46.260 --> 3:17:52.420]  going to be triggered by the new covid lockdown announced by globalist systems in europe in asia
[3:17:52.420 --> 3:17:59.700]  and now in the united states joe bite is set to announce today that he has a new covid task force
[3:17:59.700 --> 3:18:05.220]  that is calling for a national mask mandate to prove your servitude contact tracing forced
[3:18:05.220 --> 3:18:11.940]  inoculations coming but most importantly a new lockdown that way he can say that trump is to
[3:18:11.940 --> 3:18:18.660]  blame for covid and claim that only a new lockdown will stop covid then of course when that new
[3:18:18.660 --> 3:18:22.900]  lockdown doesn't work those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed
[3:18:22.900 --> 3:18:27.940]  for it and that's when all the mass arrests start sometime towards the end of next year this is a
[3:18:27.940 --> 3:18:34.420]  permanent martial law plan trump must be putiated exposed faucian gates and the un takeover not play

[3:20:52.980 --> 3:20:58.580]  they came and took it all away welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your
[3:20:58.580 --> 3:21:02.820]  guest host j direb days analysis you'd like to support my work you can subscribe there at
[3:21:02.820 --> 3:21:10.100]  my website jasonalsis.com i do lectures i do summaries analysis of the writings of the elite
[3:21:10.100 --> 3:21:15.780]  we've covered almost 45 or 50 of those in the last couple of years so you can go get yourself a
[3:21:15.780 --> 3:21:22.260]  master's phd level education for 495 a month you can't beat that right and there's no brainwashing
[3:21:22.260 --> 3:21:29.460]  it doesn't come with any uh ponytail the granola bar professor brainwashing it comes just directly
[3:21:29.460 --> 3:21:35.300]  from the writings of the elite and by the way uh i wanted to let you know i had a few conversations
[3:21:35.300 --> 3:21:42.420]  in the last week with some leftists with a former hollywood person a person who was a lead in a
[3:21:42.420 --> 3:21:46.900]  pretty big movie a couple years ago and he and i were going back and forth and he said man he said
[3:21:46.900 --> 3:21:52.340]  i'm starting to realize hollywood's going away it's like i don't have any more work he says i
[3:21:52.340 --> 3:21:56.820]  think the work is drying up and you know i've been turned on to your writings about hollywood
[3:21:56.820 --> 3:22:02.340]  in your books and so even hollywood has been looking at esoteric hollywood so be sure and get a
[3:22:02.340 --> 3:22:07.540]  signed copy of my book esoteric hollywood and even some of the hollywood people have been
[3:22:07.540 --> 3:22:12.020]  looking at that work uh was in a documentary a couple years ago that shone stone did that's
[3:22:12.020 --> 3:22:17.300]  really good by the way i'd recommend with oliver stone shone stone other people it's called hollywood
[3:22:17.300 --> 3:22:21.860]  dc so be sure and check that out if you've never seen it because we were really working to try to
[3:22:21.860 --> 3:22:28.260]  expose this relationship of hollywood as an organ of the deep state right um but that's a different
[3:22:28.260 --> 3:22:33.380]  topic back to claus what was claus saying in his number one what was point number one in this
[3:22:34.420 --> 3:22:40.420]  point number one you will own nothing and you'll be happy in the sequences in the world economic
[3:22:40.420 --> 3:22:47.940]  forum video you will own nothing and you're gonna like it because bill gates said it's going to be a
[3:22:47.940 --> 3:22:53.620]  fair redistribution he says that in the interviews oh we got to make it fair it's going to be fair
[3:22:53.620 --> 3:23:00.900]  uh i'm gonna i'm going to have my uh african companies that uh will basically make me new
[3:23:00.900 --> 3:23:05.700]  balance sneakers for the next 20 years i'll have a monopoly on all the new balance sneakers i'll
[3:23:05.700 --> 3:23:12.260]  own microsoft um i'll own everything i'll own your soul but it's going to be fair i'm going to give
[3:23:12.260 --> 3:23:18.900]  you a ration uh you're going to get a crap burger uh once a week it's going to be delivered by an
[3:23:18.900 --> 3:23:26.900]  amazon drone uh because i'm invested in uh crap burgers literally you think that this is made up
[3:23:26.900 --> 3:23:34.340]  go look up bill gates and the fake food and beyond meat and using crap to make burgers
[3:23:34.340 --> 3:23:44.260]  and if you think these people aren't satanic just think about the weirdness the sicko nature of
[3:23:45.220 --> 3:23:54.820]  making people eat their own refuse and i i think that they get off on that i think alex is 100
[3:23:54.820 --> 3:24:01.860]  right when he says that that's a demonic attitude of really rubbing people's face in it that's what
[3:24:01.860 --> 3:24:10.900]  this is about and a lot of people have stockholm syndrome a lot of people like being tread upon
[3:24:10.900 --> 3:24:17.700]  they like being a slave they like being told that you know you're going to lick the boots
[3:24:17.700 --> 3:24:23.540]  of bill gates and you're gonna like it and i'm not i'm not gonna do that i would just rather
[3:24:23.540 --> 3:24:26.740]  die than do that i mean and i think a lot of people feel that way too they would rather
[3:24:26.740 --> 3:24:33.860]  um not live a life that's just in total servitude to technocrats give me a break i'm i i don't want
[3:24:33.860 --> 3:24:37.700]  to live that kind of life uh so i think most of you out there don't want to live that kind
[3:24:37.700 --> 3:24:41.860]  of life and that's why we're talking about this today is that you have to understand that there
[3:24:41.860 --> 3:24:48.740]  are evil people in the world there are people who are raised uh even to be in these positions
[3:24:48.740 --> 3:24:54.420]  and they're actually trained believe it or not to be evil there's a section in quigley's book
[3:24:54.420 --> 3:24:58.900]  tragedy and hope the famous book where he says that the elite have the tendency to send their
[3:24:58.900 --> 3:25:03.220]  children off to boarding school so that they don't develop an attachment to their mother
[3:25:04.580 --> 3:25:08.420]  and the reason they do that is to make sure that they don't have any sense of empathy
[3:25:09.060 --> 3:25:14.660]  so you're talking about an elite degenerate class that is trained to not have empathy they see that
[3:25:14.660 --> 3:25:19.300]  as a weakness they see that as a i mean i don't know why they would see i mean if you look at
[3:25:19.300 --> 3:25:25.060]  evolution right if you believe in evolutionary theory then the trait of empathy right shouldn't
[3:25:25.060 --> 3:25:31.700]  that be part of the naturalistic deterministic process i mean all of the processes are naturalistic
[3:25:31.700 --> 3:25:37.140]  deterministic processes so i don't know why one trait right uh it would be somehow weakness i would
[3:25:37.140 --> 3:25:41.780]  think that the traits that we have would be you know supposedly is therefore the the purpose of
[3:25:41.780 --> 3:25:47.940]  the survival of the fittest but i presume they think that oh no it's psychopathy right psychopathy
[3:25:47.940 --> 3:25:52.820]  is the trait that would actually further the species because if you are willing to kill
[3:25:52.820 --> 3:25:56.100]  everybody else then you're going to go into the future oh wait a minute but if you kill everybody
[3:25:56.100 --> 3:26:02.180]  else you don't have a species so actually psychopathy is not advantageous to the species
[3:26:02.900 --> 3:26:07.540]  the protection of the other members of the species is what's advantageous to the species
[3:26:07.540 --> 3:26:12.740]  you see so even if you're not a theist even if you believe in just a sort of a naturalistic
[3:26:12.740 --> 3:26:18.820]  process it still doesn't make sense to have a cancerous group of people in charge of the species
[3:26:18.820 --> 3:26:24.820]  and that's literally what they say they want to be right birch and russell jonas song they wrote
[3:26:24.820 --> 3:26:32.980]  entire books survival of the wisest scientific outlook saying the scientific priest class aka the
[3:26:32.980 --> 3:26:39.140]  scientific priest class that's owned by the banking class has to step up and commandeer and control
[3:26:39.140 --> 3:26:45.300]  evolution and the way that we do that is to institute mandatory death panels death care
[3:26:45.300 --> 3:26:52.340]  euthanasia malthusianism right all of the plans that you've heard info wars alex talking about
[3:26:52.340 --> 3:26:59.620]  for 20 years so this last point that claus makes in the in his book and in this series of slides
[3:26:59.620 --> 3:27:03.940]  from this video is that you're not going to own anything because it's going to be what they call
[3:27:03.940 --> 3:27:08.740]  a circular economy now claus talks about this in his book he says that the circular economy is
[3:27:08.740 --> 3:27:16.740]  one in which this mistaken notion of owning property and private property or the right of owning
[3:27:16.740 --> 3:27:23.460]  property is gone and the way that they're going to do that is to make you feel guilty right you've
[3:27:23.460 --> 3:27:29.620]  hurt mother earth because you have a car because you have a house because you have children you're
[3:27:29.620 --> 3:27:37.220]  a danger you're a cancer to mother earth and so inculcate the guilt the false guilt right and by
[3:27:37.220 --> 3:27:43.460]  the way when when people leave the belief in god they don't get rid of theism they just adopt the
[3:27:43.460 --> 3:27:49.620]  new god and the elite know this they know that when you move a population into atheistic views
[3:27:50.980 --> 3:27:57.460]  they will replace it with new types of deities and new idols and you can manipulate their guilt
[3:27:58.020 --> 3:28:04.340]  mechanism in this new system that you put in place so remember you haven't done away with religion
[3:28:04.340 --> 3:28:10.820]  now you have an eco religion which tells you that you're guilty not because of sin the new sin
[3:28:11.700 --> 3:28:21.620]  is ecocide right hurting the planet over consumption and that's what claus says claus says this is the
[3:28:21.620 --> 3:28:28.340]  new covenant he calls it a new covenant in the book the new covenant of morals is one in which
[3:28:28.340 --> 3:28:35.140]  you're guilty for these types of things see yourself as guilty he says inculcate totally new
[3:28:35.140 --> 3:28:41.780]  values for the entire world and especially the west the west especially has to be targeted right
[3:28:41.780 --> 3:28:47.780]  because the west has been such an engine of economic technological progress now the elites
[3:28:47.780 --> 3:28:55.140]  say take that away remove that get rid of it transfer it to us and let them collapse and
[3:28:55.140 --> 3:29:01.460]  integrate into a big global federation run by you know basically eurasia that the elite will
[3:29:01.460 --> 3:29:06.580]  put in power right it's not the chinese people that were you know opposed to or anything like that
[3:29:06.580 --> 3:29:12.820]  it's the elite who were put into power by this specter like cabal right this international group
[3:29:14.100 --> 3:29:20.420]  of the fortune 100 and their controllers so that's what we're talking about here is a circular economy
[3:29:20.420 --> 3:29:25.460]  there there's ted talks go look it up ted talks thousands millions of views on these ted talks
[3:29:25.460 --> 3:29:31.220]  about how the way that we exist presently will have to die because it's killing the planet
[3:29:31.220 --> 3:29:36.500]  the whole of society will be reorganized everything it's all going away it's all dying
[3:29:36.500 --> 3:29:41.460]  so the way that you think of things that this is what these people say is that you're working in
[3:29:41.460 --> 3:29:47.860]  the old model you're in the enlightenment centuries old model of how things are going to work it's
[3:29:47.860 --> 3:29:51.700]  time for the next revolution what's the next revolution it's what alice huxley called the
[3:29:51.700 --> 3:29:56.820]  final revolution the end of man the post human revolution you think that how does that relate
[3:29:56.820 --> 3:30:02.500]  to trump and all this stuff it relates directly to the election because they said that the great
[3:30:02.500 --> 3:30:09.940]  reset can be brought in through this lockdown that's what this is it's not a conspiracy theory
[3:30:09.940 --> 3:30:18.340]  they wrote books on it openly years ago right this is jay dyer of jays analysis be sure and
[3:30:18.900 --> 3:30:24.500]  support info wars in the info war store and be sure and support me at jaysanalysis.com
[3:30:25.220 --> 3:30:29.700]  and we'll be back in just a second to talk a little bit more about what's in claus's book
[3:30:29.700 --> 3:30:32.580]  and maybe what they have in the next phase if we don't stop this
[3:30:34.340 --> 3:30:37.540]  Alex Jones here with an important message all of our listeners and viewers i want to thank you
[3:30:37.540 --> 3:30:41.940]  for your support over the years i want to thank you for having skin in the game and no one has
[3:30:41.940 --> 3:30:47.140]  had more skin in the game than our president and he needs our prayers he needs our support he is
[3:30:47.140 --> 3:30:51.220]  the president secretary of state Pompeo understands that's why he said yesterday
[3:30:51.220 --> 3:30:56.820]  there will be a smooth transition from this Trump administration into the next Trump administration
[3:30:56.820 --> 3:31:02.420]  because in all the major states where they're still counting they are gaining ground that is
[3:31:02.420 --> 3:31:07.620]  president trump republican party the american people the populace the patriots the enemy the
[3:31:07.620 --> 3:31:12.100]  democrats backed by the shy comms backed by the european union backed by hollywood backed by the
[3:31:12.100 --> 3:31:17.540]  left the blue cities the blue states they are in a rage trying to gaslight us keep calling
[3:31:17.540 --> 3:31:23.060]  biden president elect he's not president has to concede and or all of the states have to
[3:31:23.060 --> 3:31:27.780]  certify the vote which hasn't happened yet and then you have to have the electors to seek who is
[3:31:27.780 --> 3:31:32.020]  going to be the president and this may be a dispute that goes back to the states that's why it's in
[3:31:32.020 --> 3:31:36.580]  the constitution and the constitution's kicking in remember hillary clenching remember Pelosi
[3:31:36.580 --> 3:31:42.740]  remember bill clenching remember obama all of them said we are not going to concede if there's a red
[3:31:42.740 --> 3:31:46.420]  mirage we believe it's gonna look like trumps gonna win in the landslide because they have the
[3:31:46.420 --> 3:31:52.580]  internal polls and indeed trump won most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin
[3:31:52.580 --> 3:31:59.300]  and when he was set to win the other ones they froze the seven states on election night and then
[3:31:59.300 --> 3:32:03.140]  they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had this is completely transparent so when they
[3:32:03.140 --> 3:32:08.020]  say that he is president elect he's not trump is not conceded none of the states have certified the
[3:32:08.020 --> 3:32:13.300]  vote and now all these investigations have been opened up and avalanches mountains oceans of election
[3:32:13.300 --> 3:32:19.060]  fraud has come out and already been documented in georgia officials are on record saying we've
[3:32:19.060 --> 3:32:24.260]  already found fraud so ladies and gentlemen the fix is in they've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every
[3:32:24.260 --> 3:32:29.060]  time because the last hoax failed but now this is the mother of all hoaxes and if they get away
[3:32:29.060 --> 3:32:36.500]  with this it's the end of america as we know it we will be venezuela info wars com the miraculous

[3:35:02.020 --> 3:35:07.780]  on all the social media outlets youtube as well under my name j dire we're talking about clouse
[3:35:07.780 --> 3:35:12.660]  we're talking about the world economic forum and the great reset we are talking about the exposure
[3:35:12.660 --> 3:35:20.660]  of the great reset and stopping this ridiculous inane plan of austerity shutdown and neofutilism
[3:35:20.660 --> 3:35:25.620]  the last thing that we said there was the number one you're not going to own anything
[3:35:27.220 --> 3:35:31.940]  bill gates and clouse are going to own everything but don't worry dude it's going to be okay he's
[3:35:31.940 --> 3:35:37.300]  going to fairly distribute the wealth why are you being such a conspiracy theorist bro don't you
[3:35:37.300 --> 3:35:43.540]  think he's going to be fair i mean he gave you all those computers with all that malware right
[3:35:44.420 --> 3:35:50.020]  he wouldn't lie he wouldn't be unfair let's talk about clouse's book a little bit of a
[3:35:50.020 --> 3:35:56.500]  refresher now we did a video on this a couple months ago and uh three months ago i think and
[3:35:56.500 --> 3:36:01.060]  as what alex was talking about yesterday in his show with paul joseph watson uh now when we covered
[3:36:01.060 --> 3:36:07.140]  this book that video got i don't know 40 000 views i mean why doesn't why aren't we getting this out
[3:36:07.140 --> 3:36:14.500]  right people share that video share this video i want this this is designed to be a lecture a
[3:36:14.500 --> 3:36:22.900]  rundown right of understanding and comprehending and working against this idea of great reset so
[3:36:22.900 --> 3:36:27.780]  please share this video please support what we're doing here we're trying to get this message out
[3:36:28.660 --> 3:36:33.300]  and again the mainstream media outlets are not going to cover this in fact again they deleted
[3:36:33.300 --> 3:36:39.700]  that tweet from 2016 with the eight-point plan of bringing in technocratic communism now why
[3:36:39.700 --> 3:36:43.300]  did they delete that because everybody was calling attention to it it went viral it got a million a
[3:36:43.300 --> 3:36:48.900]  million plus views so they deleted it well uh clouse still tweets about it he just tweeted the
[3:36:48.900 --> 3:36:56.580]  other day he said buy my covid book for what do you call it winter must not christmas winter must
[3:36:56.580 --> 3:37:02.660]  you see they don't like jesus they hate christianity they hate religion right the global reset
[3:37:02.660 --> 3:37:09.860]  prepares us for transhumanists right go watch that video i i'm i'm detailing it right from clouse's
[3:37:09.860 --> 3:37:13.700]  book and let's do a little bit of refresher here so what does clouse say he says remember those
[3:37:13.700 --> 3:37:18.820]  revolutions right the the previous revolutions in different centuries type the industrial
[3:37:18.820 --> 3:37:23.780]  revolution etc this is the final one this is the last one this is what alas talks we talked about
[3:37:23.780 --> 3:37:28.900]  he said what does it mean to say that this is the final revolution it means that for humanity
[3:37:28.900 --> 3:37:37.220]  for men mankind humans you're done there's not going to be a fifth revolution this is the last
[3:37:37.220 --> 3:37:45.060]  one because this one relates to technology and technocracy and ascending to the next plane of
[3:37:45.060 --> 3:37:53.940]  existence this is them it's not me this is them through technology and he goes on to say by 2050
[3:37:53.940 --> 3:37:59.940]  our plan is to have this all fully in place right remember 2030 is a project date for
[3:38:00.900 --> 3:38:09.460]  ending private property this kind of stuff 2050 is the plan for the whole system to be fully in
[3:38:09.460 --> 3:38:14.260]  place now there's a lot of infrastructure that they have to put in before they can fully roll out
[3:38:14.260 --> 3:38:19.780]  the whole thing that's what they're doing right now great reset is going to be rolled out through
[3:38:19.780 --> 3:38:25.060]  these lockdowns that's a big part of the phase now it is about trump in part right so i'm not
[3:38:25.060 --> 3:38:29.540]  saying it's not about trump but this is why they had to get rid of him get him out of the way because
[3:38:29.540 --> 3:38:35.060]  he's a road bump in this overall plan for this big thing right and the big thing is the fourth
[3:38:35.060 --> 3:38:41.700]  industrial revolution and they they actually wear it out in decades in 2030 50 right so as you just
[3:38:41.700 --> 3:38:48.820]  saw there 2030 that's when they want to have the eight point plan in in play 2050 is the target date
[3:38:48.820 --> 3:38:53.460]  for the whole thing all of it the whole technocratic system and by the way do you remember Jacques
[3:38:53.460 --> 3:38:58.820]  atelier do you remember in the previous talks i've done we covered Jacques atelier's 2000 book
[3:38:59.540 --> 3:39:03.860]  where he said brief history of the future another one of the technocratic global elitists of France
[3:39:03.860 --> 3:39:12.820]  he says 2050 2050 2050 is the key date so there's these key periods these key uh decades 2030 2050
[3:39:12.820 --> 3:39:21.140]  those are the key periods when it all comes in now claus moves on to say that uh to bring this in
[3:39:21.140 --> 3:39:29.060]  it's going to take decades of schools re-educating children yes schools re-educate the youth for
[3:39:29.060 --> 3:39:34.100]  several decades it's going to take billions of dollars uh brainwashing children in schools
[3:39:35.220 --> 3:39:42.500]  for them to accept the new value system and the new value system is what i've been talking about
[3:39:42.500 --> 3:39:48.740]  right this this ecosystem this you're guilty for existing type of system he goes on and he says that
[3:39:49.540 --> 3:39:53.780]  what we're going to have is a new type of blockchain i'm not saying blockchain itself is
[3:39:53.780 --> 3:40:00.820]  evil but this is claus's plan says let's use a blockchain system to track and trace everything
[3:40:00.820 --> 3:40:06.260]  on the planet through internet of things so that we can barely redistribute everything
[3:40:06.260 --> 3:40:12.980]  that's what he says is everything this is not a plan for some guy in some you know
[3:40:13.620 --> 3:40:19.060]  villa somewhere like a bond villain in the sense of like you know uh one guy in some villa in
[3:40:19.060 --> 3:40:25.620]  france who wants to take over france no no it's a planetary plan it's the whole planet it's the
[3:40:25.620 --> 3:40:33.540]  whole ecosystem he says this new type of blockchain that will put in place will get rid of the idea of
[3:40:33.540 --> 3:40:39.700]  private property in land rights and it will redistribute redistribute everything through
[3:40:40.340 --> 3:40:44.340]  global satellite tracking and tracing via the internet of things
[3:40:46.420 --> 3:40:52.740]  he says yes exactly the carbon footprint will be monitored by the same international satellite
[3:40:52.740 --> 3:40:57.620]  internet of things network so they're going to keep up with how much water you use
[3:40:57.620 --> 3:41:04.580]  how much electricity you're using right all it's going to be allocated and that's why the car the
[3:41:06.260 --> 3:41:09.940]  coffin apartments fit into this because everybody has to be off of the land
[3:41:10.500 --> 3:41:14.900]  herd it into a mega city herd it into a coffin apartment if you're even allowed to live i mean
[3:41:14.900 --> 3:41:20.980]  then the money would just i just say everybody you know over age 30 like in uh logan's run you
[3:41:20.980 --> 3:41:26.180]  know oh it's time to die you get a float off into the incinerator when you're age 30 i mean who knows
[3:41:26.180 --> 3:41:31.060]  right if they've done all of this you think they're going to stop with that no they want
[3:41:32.100 --> 3:41:37.780]  you know like death uh death panels right bill gates has even said that
[3:41:39.540 --> 3:41:47.300]  so claus goes on and he says um the way to bring this about is to get rid of the firewall of nation
[3:41:47.300 --> 3:41:52.420]  states that have regulations that prevent us from bringing in the full on yeah there you go
[3:41:52.420 --> 3:42:00.260]  logan's really float away into the incinerator right um once you hit age 30 by the way they had
[3:42:00.260 --> 3:42:05.620]  a mythology in logan's run if you recall that it was this glorious thing to do it it was like the
[3:42:05.620 --> 3:42:12.020]  high point of your life was to float up into this incinerator yeah you see oh here's the
[3:42:12.020 --> 3:42:17.300]  willing sacrifices oh yes burn me up bill gates i can't wait i can't wait to just put you in that
[3:42:17.300 --> 3:42:21.140]  little microwave i'm gonna we're gonna float you up to the top of this incinerator and it's
[3:42:21.140 --> 3:42:26.500]  going to be glorious you're going to go on to a techno technological virtual uh heaven right so
[3:42:26.500 --> 3:42:31.460]  then that's what they'll tell people to say oh if you float away and incinerate yourself uh you
[3:42:31.460 --> 3:42:36.180]  can go into a virtual world and it'll be like heaven and you could create your own virtual world
[3:42:36.180 --> 3:42:41.700]  no you're gonna die the plan is to get rid of you right but all of these willing dupes are
[3:42:41.700 --> 3:42:47.380]  going to believe it yes they go floating away into the into bill gates's human microwave up there
[3:42:47.380 --> 3:42:54.180]  but class goes on to say that we got to get rid of all the nation states so that we can bring in
[3:42:54.180 --> 3:43:00.820]  the internet of things and get rid of all of these uh national regulations that are in the way
[3:43:01.460 --> 3:43:06.260]  of the internet of things this is what he says this is like a chapter seven iot internet of
[3:43:06.260 --> 3:43:11.620]  things he says that we got to have the 5g infrastructure in place so that when the 5g is in
[3:43:11.620 --> 3:43:21.780]  place then we can give everybody the chips microchips sounds like the apocalypse right
[3:43:21.780 --> 3:43:26.980]  they were read the book of revelation right a chip in your hand and in your forehead right this
[3:43:26.980 --> 3:43:32.740]  kind of stuff it sounds like that whatever you think of the bible whatever you think of the
[3:43:32.740 --> 3:43:39.540]  end times all that i mean doesn't it sound like that and claus even says to to live to breathe
[3:43:39.540 --> 3:43:47.300]  to move to do economic processes transactions to eat you're gonna have to have this
[3:43:49.380 --> 3:43:54.980]  and he says that part of what will be installed is a global fully automated
[3:43:54.980 --> 3:44:04.740]  sense uh system with sensors everywhere sensors everywhere tracking monitoring tracing controlling
[3:44:04.740 --> 3:44:12.260]  everything all links to 5g all linked to satellites and all tattling on you policing
[3:44:12.260 --> 3:44:16.260]  you boss you're a bitch bots you're gonna be bitched around by little robots and everybody's
[3:44:16.260 --> 3:44:21.140]  gonna love it oh it's so fun to have alexa sitting there you know listening to me ha ha it's so cute
[3:44:21.140 --> 3:44:28.500]  oh ask alexa about jesus ask alexa about buddha ask alexa about butts ask alexa about boobs it's
[3:44:28.500 --> 3:44:37.620]  so cute bunny no it's not this is your enslavement this is the end of you don't you understand this
[3:44:37.620 --> 3:44:42.260]  they don't give this stuff out because they're nice because they want you to be happy
[3:44:44.580 --> 3:44:51.140]  they want you to die right what does alex always say from the james bond clip no mr bond
[3:44:51.140 --> 3:44:59.140]  i want you to die they're saying that to you you see and he says um once we pass all the the climate
[3:44:59.140 --> 3:45:06.260]  carbon regulations once we go this in place internet of things once we get the rna nano tech
[3:45:06.980 --> 3:45:16.340]  in place then comes the full-on robot lockdown sky net terminator sky net terminator that's
[3:45:16.340 --> 3:45:23.060]  what claus ends the book with i'm j direb j's analysis and this is the alexa jones show be sure and share this
