[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:12.000 --> 00:19.560]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.560 --> 00:33.240]  Texas Alex Jones we are live it is the second day of June 2011 on this live
[00:33.240 --> 00:39.120]  Thursday edition we're gonna be here for the next three hours we have Catherine
[00:39.120 --> 00:45.960]  Austin of Fitz a big banking finance insider joining us for the second half
[00:45.960 --> 00:49.860]  of the next hour to break down the big stock market plunge yesterday and the
[00:49.860 --> 00:53.520]  sudden announcements that oh my gosh the economy is going over the edge of a
[00:53.520 --> 00:57.840]  cliff the economy went over the edge of a cliff more than three years ago and
[00:57.840 --> 01:02.720]  the system knows that Wall Street saying oh my gosh things are terrible
[01:02.720 --> 01:05.940]  oh they're not terrible for Wall Street they're not terrible for the big
[01:05.940 --> 01:10.280]  megabanks the private Federal Reserve shareholders they have engineered this
[01:10.280 --> 01:14.480]  system on record we're gonna be breaking that down today having had him on
[01:14.480 --> 01:18.560]  probably four or five months the time flies but Alan Watt great researcher of
[01:18.560 --> 01:22.680]  cutting through the matrix is gonna be joining us to talk about the the the
[01:22.680 --> 01:28.120]  current position of the globalist program of establishing and expanding
[01:28.120 --> 01:32.720]  their world government program and what their in-game is he'll be joining us
[01:32.720 --> 01:42.200]  today now there is an article that I read this morning that really spurred my
[01:42.200 --> 01:47.600]  thought processes studying the Federal Reserve over the years and studying
[01:47.600 --> 01:52.320]  their policies worldwide this is just the regional holding company for a
[01:52.320 --> 01:58.480]  collection of private banking families you could say four horsemen you could
[01:58.480 --> 02:02.520]  say five horsemen there's really from our research five megabanks operating in
[02:02.520 --> 02:06.440]  Europe in the United States but excellent article by Dean Henderson at
[02:06.440 --> 02:13.800]  info wars.com and global research.ca the Federal Reserve cartel the eight
[02:13.800 --> 02:19.960]  families and this is part one of a four-part series and mentions the eight
[02:19.960 --> 02:25.080]  families and I agree this is an accurate research but in this first part it
[02:25.080 --> 02:31.720]  gets into detail on two of the families and it's an eight-page article I'm gonna
[02:31.720 --> 02:35.920]  try to go over some of this because the mere fact that they try to keep it
[02:35.920 --> 02:41.200]  secret who owns the Federal Reserve I mean congressmen have to release their
[02:41.200 --> 02:47.640]  financials presidents do but the IRS the CIA nobody can look into the Federal
[02:47.640 --> 02:53.320]  Reserve and we've got the clips we played of Alan Greenspan saying that the
[02:53.320 --> 02:56.920]  Federal Reserve is above the law remember that clip in fact we'll probably
[02:56.920 --> 03:01.600]  dig that out and play that later on Lair News Hour where he said well well no
[03:01.600 --> 03:06.800]  one can look at us no branch of government we are above government think
[03:06.800 --> 03:17.160]  about the magnitude of this hoax how ridiculous it is and then you see the
[03:17.160 --> 03:25.080]  policies of these groups and of these organizations and the type of programs
[03:25.080 --> 03:28.920]  that they're launching against humanity it's not that we just have these
[03:28.920 --> 03:34.760]  shadowy rulers who control the issuance of currency and credit and dominate and
[03:34.760 --> 03:38.400]  sit on the boards of almost every Fortune 500 company because they have
[03:38.400 --> 03:42.480]  unlimited wealth they've they've bought everything up it's the fact that it gives
[03:42.480 --> 03:48.160]  them then the power to have a total continuity of agenda worldwide and so the
[03:48.160 --> 03:52.040]  world we see being built is being built by these individuals from behind the
[03:52.040 --> 03:56.560]  scenes and they're charting our destiny and that's wrong I also have some
[03:56.560 --> 04:01.920]  reports here dealing with the curious thing that's been noticed with some of
[04:01.920 --> 04:06.240]  these genetically modified corn crops and others that it basically has
[04:06.240 --> 04:14.840]  engineered into it a anti fertility component that causes an autoimmune
[04:14.840 --> 04:23.120]  response and there's some more news on that today that we're going to be breaking
[04:23.120 --> 04:29.800]  down but when you come face to face with a group this diabolical creating total
[04:29.800 --> 04:34.400]  war against humanity this total corporate full-spectrum dominance
[04:34.400 --> 04:40.520]  re-engineering of the human society and the human itself to ensure their total
[04:40.520 --> 04:44.360]  victory over humanity it's incredible because these banking money changers
[04:44.360 --> 04:49.760]  have been overthrown countless times in history the last 5,000 years in every
[04:49.760 --> 04:56.120]  culture from China to the Middle East to Europe so they in the last 150 years they
[04:56.120 --> 05:00.200]  sought to create a scientific dictatorship in their own words stay with
[05:00.200 --> 05:06.120]  us hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[05:06.120 --> 05:11.600]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[05:11.600 --> 05:15.080]  will be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned the
[05:15.080 --> 05:19.800]  menace influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[05:19.800 --> 05:24.920]  shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[05:24.920 --> 05:29.480]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[05:29.480 --> 05:34.160]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[05:34.160 --> 05:38.200]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[05:38.200 --> 05:41.880]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[05:41.880 --> 05:46.960]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[05:46.960 --> 05:53.040]  a fall of the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info

[08:28.440 --> 08:33.960]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central standard time and then of course
[08:33.960 --> 08:40.160]  free return to the airwaves Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. central standard time as well
[08:40.160 --> 08:45.800]  former top-level banking insider in the US government Catherine Austin Fitz
[08:45.800 --> 08:50.040]  joins us in the second half of the next hour and then of course globalist
[08:50.040 --> 08:54.280]  anti-globalist researcher Elman Watt will be joining us in the third hour
[08:54.280 --> 08:58.400]  today later in the hour and have open phones into the first half of the next
[08:58.400 --> 09:05.400]  hour okay let me do this I want to get into all these deaths in Europe from
[09:05.400 --> 09:12.480]  the cucumbers because now it's being linked to mutated E. Coli well I wanted
[09:12.480 --> 09:17.360]  to talk about some of the mutations that are being purposely engineered with
[09:17.360 --> 09:23.560]  E. Coli just to give you an example of why we're seeing so many flesh-eating
[09:23.560 --> 09:29.520]  bacteria so many other rogue strains of bacteria that have been directly linked
[09:29.520 --> 09:37.000]  to the modern medical big pharma industrial complex so we've got that
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.120]  we've got obviously the economy now they admit going into freefall well it's
[09:43.120 --> 09:46.960]  always been in freefall in the last three plus years and it's by design
[09:46.960 --> 09:51.680]  engineered by the big mega banks who are all making record bonuses and record
[09:51.680 --> 09:56.720]  profits and who write the laws through the lobbyist exempting themselves in
[09:56.720 --> 10:02.920]  most cases from 100% of taxes if you're more of a porch globalist just getting
[10:02.920 --> 10:08.000]  into the power structure like Bill Gates or Google you might pay a 2.5 a 2.8
[10:08.000 --> 10:15.080]  Google pays what a 2.4 so we're going to be going over all of that today and I
[10:15.080 --> 10:21.080]  saw an article at info wars.com from global research the Federal Reserve
[10:21.080 --> 10:24.280]  cartel the eight families and I read the article and it's extremely accurate and
[10:24.280 --> 10:28.040]  the truth is we know who the eight families are we know who the five
[10:28.040 --> 10:33.480]  mega banks are and there's actually a curl quickly one of their insiders had a
[10:33.480 --> 10:39.520]  political science Georgetown wrote an 1100 page book bragging about it we know
[10:39.520 --> 10:43.800]  from the banker bailouts which are just the grand larceny in front of
[10:43.800 --> 10:50.840]  everybody to the private cartels we know exactly who they are and we know who
[10:50.840 --> 10:57.760]  was at Jekyll Island now a hundred years ago in the two years leading up to
[10:57.760 --> 11:01.320]  the establishment of the private Federal Reserve and that same year the
[11:01.320 --> 11:07.080]  private IRS that is it's a government operation but they take your money and
[11:07.080 --> 11:11.120]  deposit it with the Federal Reserve and 100% of it is Ronald Reagan's Commission
[11:11.120 --> 11:16.520]  in 1981 conclusively found does go to pay interest on the debt to the bankers
[11:16.520 --> 11:21.200]  who created out of nothing so they get the world out of nothing and that's why
[11:21.200 --> 11:30.360]  in the different SEC filings you'll find that the eight big families own the
[11:30.360 --> 11:35.000]  controlling interest in all the major fortune 500 and sit on every board
[11:35.000 --> 11:42.640]  because they have unlimited capital this is the total takeover of our society
[11:42.640 --> 11:50.320]  and I'm gonna be breaking it down in detail at the bottom of the hour also
[11:50.320 --> 11:54.320]  we've people been asking me in the last two days why haven't I covered Wiener
[11:54.320 --> 12:00.200]  who's gone after gold and silver who's tried to demonize anybody that talks
[12:00.200 --> 12:06.000]  about the New World Order and Wiener reportedly has been sending you know
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.920]  sent this photo out with his namesake photographed there Wiener sent out a
[12:11.920 --> 12:21.640]  photo well of his last name and this is standard procedure first he said that
[12:21.640 --> 12:25.800]  somebody must have hacked into his phone and sent a fake photo and that it
[12:25.800 --> 12:32.680]  wasn't him and now he's saying well it may be a photo of Mr. Wiener's well last
[12:32.680 --> 12:41.760]  name Mr. Wiener's his last name is Wiener a photo of his last name so it's
[12:41.760 --> 12:45.640]  possible that the lewd photo is of him he's now saying so he's he's done
[12:45.640 --> 12:49.720]  basically a 160 something a 180 from saying somebody hacked my phone it's
[12:49.720 --> 12:54.920]  fake you can make fake photos you know now he's having to go well that might
[12:54.920 --> 13:01.240]  actually be a photo of Mr. Wiener's Mr. Wiener all right I'm gonna stop joking
[13:01.240 --> 13:06.600]  around on that point but the illustration here is that these guys are
[13:06.600 --> 13:11.720]  out of control they're absolutely out of control and I'm not a fan of Mr. Wiener
[13:11.720 --> 13:17.240]  he's a hundred percent anti-gun pro-globalist anti-gold pro-fetal reserve
[13:17.240 --> 13:28.680]  and but at the end of the day sending out a photo of his proboscis I'd rather
[13:28.680 --> 13:32.480]  go after him for being an anti-gun being a pro-globalist but the issue is he's
[13:32.480 --> 13:37.280]  lied here and they and the system loves to go after politicians for petty
[13:37.280 --> 13:41.680]  things because this doesn't deal with the banker bailout he supported it doesn't
[13:41.680 --> 13:45.520]  deal with all the corrupt wars of the torture of the Patriot Act and the
[13:45.520 --> 13:49.400]  police state and things that most of Congress is guilty of as well that's
[13:49.400 --> 13:53.640]  what I went after Bill Clinton for the cigars and the Monica Lewinsky behavior
[13:53.640 --> 14:00.080]  and the sex and then and the lying about it that I mean Kim Star couldn't go
[14:00.080 --> 14:04.360]  after him for missile secrets and murders and all the corruption because a
[14:04.360 --> 14:07.240]  lot of Republicans were involved in that as well so they went after him for a
[14:07.240 --> 14:13.360]  sexual escapade and it's the same thing with Wiener but I will not cry myself
[14:13.360 --> 14:21.080]  to sleep at night that Congressman Wiener is going down in flames for the
[14:21.080 --> 14:26.400]  lying should have said it was a private photo and was not meant to be sent out
[14:26.400 --> 14:30.120]  and I apologize that would have been the end of it he might have even survived
[14:30.120 --> 14:36.800]  it but the lying the instinct to lie and now he's backtracking again 160 degrees
[14:36.800 --> 14:45.680]  he's almost 180 going okay it might be a photo of my private parts Mr. Wiener
[14:45.680 --> 14:53.040]  said I'm sorry I just hate Wiener I mean I really don't like Wiener I don't like
[14:53.040 --> 15:01.120]  gun grabbing pro-new World Order parasites but Wiener's wife is staying
[15:01.120 --> 15:07.000]  mum on the whole Wiener controversy there's a photo of Mr. Wiener with
[15:07.000 --> 15:11.720]  Mrs. Wiener and of course we could talk to her and find out is that a photo of
[15:11.720 --> 15:18.520]  Mr. Wiener's well you know what all right I'm done that's it now getting into
[15:18.520 --> 15:24.520]  more serious issues on the lighter note here at the beginning of the broadcast
[15:24.520 --> 15:28.920]  as I get into a smattering of some of the other news let's get into what's
[15:28.920 --> 15:33.400]  really serious these globalists think they're God these UN people are above
[15:33.400 --> 15:36.520]  the law they have diplomatic immunity the IMF and World Bank of diplomatic
[15:36.520 --> 15:40.400]  immunity though that's not being extended that's been revoked for Dominique
[15:40.400 --> 15:44.560]  Strauss-Kahn so I believe he did behave like a rutting chimpanzee as one
[15:44.560 --> 15:49.080]  reporter described him in a closed-door session in 2002 going wild and trying to
[15:49.080 --> 15:52.920]  rip her clothes off but then when she said no he backed off it's more of a
[15:52.920 --> 15:59.840]  aggressive peppy-la-pew type behavior and I think it's wrong but when you get
[15:59.840 --> 16:06.680]  into the times of London 1999 had articles about women that escaped from
[16:06.680 --> 16:13.280]  a Rothschild owned castle and she ran to the state police she weighed 85 pounds
[16:13.280 --> 16:18.560]  it reported a memory serves it was in the Burgundy region where they grow that
[16:18.560 --> 16:28.120]  goes great burgundy grapes and when they went to the castle there were women
[16:28.120 --> 16:33.520]  little like concentration camp victims in cages and some dead bodies and it when
[16:33.520 --> 16:36.960]  the story was never seen again you can pull it up and then I've got
[16:36.960 --> 16:40.680]  congressional hearings where the congresswoman says to says to Rumsfeld
[16:40.680 --> 16:45.360]  in 2005 and again in 2006 and those hearings you just search the term
[16:45.360 --> 16:49.800]  Cynthia McKinney grills Rumsfeld and she says Dinecore was running the child
[16:49.800 --> 16:52.840]  kidnapping rings and didn't get in trouble and he says well they were
[16:52.840 --> 16:56.280]  putting a penalty box for a year and couldn't get contracts and she said no
[16:56.280 --> 17:00.080]  they weren't he goes dr. Chew head of the Pentagon financed the time will you
[17:00.080 --> 17:03.280]  talk about that and then they just said we have no comment for you and they
[17:03.280 --> 17:06.760]  don't get in trouble the point is if you're a new listener and you're like oh
[17:06.760 --> 17:11.120]  yeah Dinecore Halliburton running giant child kidnapping rings sure post you
[17:11.120 --> 17:15.040]  think I just day after day say this on air and I'm not sued into oblivion
[17:15.040 --> 17:19.000]  don't be lazy just go search it pull it up we've written articles linked to the
[17:19.000 --> 17:25.800]  Chicago Tribune Houston Chronicle BBC they are allowed to grab children out
[17:25.800 --> 17:29.760]  of backyards put them on planes and fly to Saudi Arabia Israel Thailand they
[17:29.760 --> 17:34.000]  grab men in mass out of Central Europe Eastern Europe the Middle East they

[24:12.280 --> 24:18.160]  studied history and knows how civilizations tend to develop become
[24:18.160 --> 24:23.520]  very wealthy then become decadent then become insanely decadent and then
[24:23.520 --> 24:28.040]  collapse it's frustrating for those of us that have just studied history we're
[24:28.040 --> 24:32.080]  not rocket scientists we're not brain surgery this is how humans act over and
[24:32.080 --> 24:35.760]  over again and the same scams that have been run for thousands of years are
[24:35.760 --> 24:43.560]  being run today just with a modern twist and in every case the Aztecs the
[24:43.560 --> 24:53.240]  ancient Chinese the Babylonians the Israelites the Romans the Greeks every
[24:53.240 --> 25:00.640]  culture goes through these cycles and in every case a priest class arises who
[25:00.640 --> 25:06.720]  are the ruling elite through mumbo jumbo and trickery and they always demand
[25:06.720 --> 25:12.600]  offerings of your oxen and your pigs and your cows and your your sheep and then
[25:12.600 --> 25:16.400]  that's never enough for them in every culture generally within a few hundred
[25:16.400 --> 25:21.560]  years of decadence setting in they begin to demand human sacrifices and you ask
[25:21.560 --> 25:28.240]  why it's the ultimate power trip of the naturally occurring psychopath the
[25:28.240 --> 25:33.080]  different psychological actuaries estimate maybe one psychopath for every
[25:33.080 --> 25:40.400]  200 people maybe one sociopath for every 20 people and there's a lot of
[25:40.400 --> 25:47.760]  psychological studies that make a lot of sense from the research I've done that
[25:47.760 --> 25:52.680]  narcissism is increasing especially with the advent of television and
[25:52.680 --> 25:58.800]  especially in the United States and that that then leads to people becoming
[25:58.800 --> 26:04.840]  sociopaths and we've had of course Dr. Steve Pacenek on to break that down
[26:04.840 --> 26:09.680]  he's going to be a board certified board examining psychiatrist run some of the
[26:09.680 --> 26:12.960]  biggest mental institutions in the country wrote psychological warfare
[26:12.960 --> 26:18.040]  manuals for the government he wants to talk about Weiner and this narcissism
[26:18.040 --> 26:20.480]  tomorrow and a bunch of other issues going to be joining us for about 45
[26:20.480 --> 26:27.840]  minutes but to try to boil down narcissism from my layman's perspective it
[26:27.840 --> 26:34.080]  is when you're three years old and you're into your individual personage as
[26:34.080 --> 26:38.560]  if you are an island and you are the whole world and you see everything
[26:38.560 --> 26:43.760]  through yourself and I remember being three years old and standing on the
[26:43.760 --> 26:48.000]  back porch on a sunny day about to jump off the porch I was Batman or Robin or
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.240]  something with my friends and I suddenly realized this is stupid this is silly
[26:52.240 --> 26:56.840]  I'm not Batman I'm not Robin I'm not a superhero I'm this little creature and
[26:56.840 --> 27:01.000]  there's this whole world around me and there's this ancient history of
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.280]  humanity it had to be an ancestral memory because I didn't know this
[27:04.280 --> 27:09.480]  information it was just self-evident and I had this great understanding that I
[27:09.480 --> 27:15.240]  was a tiny little part of the larger universe now you see children dressing
[27:15.240 --> 27:19.120]  up like superheroes dressing up like a cop and then acting like a cop you see
[27:19.120 --> 27:23.240]  little girls dressing up like princesses and that's what all these beauty pageants
[27:23.240 --> 27:27.640]  for kids are about and you see adults acting like this that's what people are
[27:27.640 --> 27:32.520]  into the bling and the fast you know the cars and the wealth not just for the
[27:32.520 --> 27:38.680]  enjoyment and security of it or that a fast car is fun it's that it's like
[27:38.680 --> 27:43.480]  parrots that are brightly colored in a mating dance for other parrots and so
[27:43.480 --> 27:47.920]  it's natural it's part of our human development but generally in the
[27:47.920 --> 27:52.400]  hierarchy of needs as you become older and attain success you generally if
[27:52.400 --> 27:56.160]  you're healthy start caring about the overall health of the tribe and want to
[27:56.160 --> 27:59.800]  build others up because you then realize you're transient you're not going to be
[27:59.800 --> 28:07.800]  here very long but see that's what a healthy person does we are taking on the
[28:07.800 --> 28:13.640]  global social engineers sociopathy their their psychotic tendencies to the
[28:13.640 --> 28:18.760]  extreme the sadomasochism the tortures good the blood the guts the murder the
[28:18.760 --> 28:25.360]  giggling and laughing at horrible tragedies not an uncomfortable way but
[28:25.360 --> 28:31.840]  in an enjoyment and the weaker and more domesticated and a feat people get in
[28:31.840 --> 28:36.040]  every case in history the more they get into blood and guts and torture and
[28:36.040 --> 28:40.160]  murder the more it becomes a sport that people are being torn apart in the arena
[28:40.160 --> 28:44.760]  or people are being tasered on the news the more people get into groveling to
[28:44.760 --> 28:49.840]  authority we're following that exact same psychology and now because the advent
[28:49.840 --> 28:55.960]  of television and mass-drugging and pharmacia and the programming of society
[28:55.960 --> 29:03.960]  a great cauldron of poison has been has been fomented that has never before been
[29:03.960 --> 29:10.920]  seen and I talked to adults and you'll see them and you'll talk to them they're
[29:10.920 --> 29:16.880]  in a play with themselves they're imagining a role they're in and I have
[29:16.880 --> 29:21.720]  flashbacks being three years old and then after that four five six seven I
[29:21.720 --> 29:26.480]  would catch myself every once in a while in a delusional mindset and would
[29:26.480 --> 29:29.720]  instantly pull out of it and I didn't realize that's very rare most people
[29:29.720 --> 29:34.600]  don't develop that till their 30s or 40s I had it at age three and it's an
[29:34.600 --> 29:42.600]  outside spectrum analysis in the universe gobbling up data versus the
[29:42.600 --> 29:48.960]  delusion the dress-up the play the imagination where where form over
[29:48.960 --> 29:53.400]  function or or I'm gonna talk about it we're on the March the Empire's on the

[33:20.280 --> 33:24.960]  mind info wars.com because there's a war on for your mind and what I'm
[33:24.960 --> 33:30.480]  getting at here is adults real people that are street smart that are close to
[33:30.480 --> 33:37.000]  the ground that live in reality if you go back to our pioneer ancestors or
[33:37.000 --> 33:41.960]  anybody that's had to you know live in the wilds or live in a rough city those
[33:41.960 --> 33:47.320]  are people that are always hard to con and who aren't delusional and who are
[33:47.320 --> 33:54.120]  serious and rugged and are into reality every time you get modern decadent
[33:54.120 --> 34:01.240]  cities with propaganda from a corrupt elite the public becomes delusional and
[34:01.240 --> 34:06.440]  and things get more and more nonsensical more and more crazy and people
[34:06.440 --> 34:11.120]  accept more and more and as it gets down to a breaking point or a flash point

[34:17.560 --> 34:22.880]  ever imagine that Americans would let police under federal grants warrantlessly
[34:22.880 --> 34:27.800]  in every state in the union take blood at checkpoints without warrants who would
[34:27.800 --> 34:32.560]  ever imagine that government wouldn't get in trouble for now a 39 year secret
[34:32.560 --> 34:38.200]  plan declassified the last three years to take all babies blood at birth lie to
[34:38.200 --> 34:42.160]  the parents and say it's a blood test for the health department and send it to
[34:42.160 --> 34:48.480]  the Pentagon and the IBM Cold Springs Harbor eugenics lab in New York who
[34:48.480 --> 34:53.640]  would imagine old-time Americans putting up with politicians lying to them if
[34:53.640 --> 34:58.600]  you if politicians got caught lying even a hundred years ago they were
[34:58.600 --> 35:01.800]  immediately impeached they were immediately overthrown people would
[35:01.800 --> 35:06.560]  physically take over their state houses it was routine because folks knew how
[35:06.560 --> 35:10.960]  dangerous that was they knew that if you let government set a precedent to lie
[35:10.960 --> 35:15.920]  to you and to abuse you tyrants are going to take over and and that our way of
[35:15.920 --> 35:20.560]  life is over and America's never been perfect but it's because we were wildly
[35:20.560 --> 35:26.640]  we were gritty we did live in reality that the most patents the most science
[35:26.640 --> 35:31.800]  the most wealth I mean if you look at the United States compared to many
[35:31.800 --> 35:38.400]  countries resource wise we don't have that many resources Mexico the World
[35:38.400 --> 35:44.000]  Bank estimates has triple the resources the u.s. does but they can't get
[35:44.000 --> 35:48.360]  themselves going because they have such corruption at the top which seeks to
[35:48.360 --> 35:53.760]  shut down upward mobility as a tool of control so we have adults that are
[35:53.760 --> 36:00.760]  delusional they think well if I decide WMDs are Iraq they magically are if I
[36:00.760 --> 36:05.600]  decide that cell phones aren't gonna give me brain cancer they don't if I
[36:05.600 --> 36:10.280]  decide that vaccines aren't gonna hurt my kid and that and that you guys are
[36:10.280 --> 36:13.920]  conspiracy theorist despite all your research and facts magically it makes it
[36:13.920 --> 36:20.760]  okay it's called magical thinking and that's always a sign of a society
[36:20.760 --> 36:27.480]  imploding you take the Indians in the West whenever they were dying they were
[36:27.480 --> 36:34.800]  almost wiped out the invading Europeans were slaughtering them and they were
[36:34.800 --> 36:39.280]  doing ghost dances for a decade they would just do ghost dances and you know
[36:39.280 --> 36:46.120]  believe that magically that it would make the bad dream and and and and and
[36:46.120 --> 36:50.920]  and bring everything back and that's the secret that I know all these people
[36:50.920 --> 36:56.360]  that believe in the secret and and and and magical thinking it isn't real ladies
[36:56.360 --> 37:00.280]  and gentlemen now it is real to be objective and positive and to believe
[37:00.280 --> 37:05.200]  in yourself and to believe in in in building programs to get our liberty
[37:05.200 --> 37:10.400]  back or to have a you know to do you to trust in God the type of camel is the
[37:10.400 --> 37:15.280]  better one say that is one thing that's positive thinking and and and positive
[37:15.280 --> 37:20.360]  research versus magical thinking and they're using magical thinking on you
[37:20.360 --> 37:24.760]  telling you hey the economy two and a half years ago the recession ended
[37:24.760 --> 37:29.360]  oh yeah everything's great the economy's wonderful meanwhile crime is
[37:29.360 --> 37:35.840]  exploding rioting shootings city systems breaking down major cities laying off in
[37:35.840 --> 37:40.120]  some cases more than half their cops taxes going up because the majority of
[37:40.120 --> 37:44.600]  the money is now going to the foreign banks on interest we are becoming a
[37:44.600 --> 37:49.320]  third-world country and there are a lot of people that just think if they deny
[37:49.320 --> 37:57.000]  it if they do a ghost dance that somehow that is going to restore the
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.880]  republic I get emails see comments articles written all the time Alex Jones
[38:01.880 --> 38:06.120]  Ron Paul and his ilk they're being negative about the economy they're
[38:06.120 --> 38:12.840]  going to cause the depression no and we haven't gotten new numbers in over a
[38:12.840 --> 38:20.160]  year in the first two years after October 3rd 2008 even Bloomberg reported
[38:20.160 --> 38:28.080]  27 trillion and boy they clamped down since then we've not gotten numbers 27
[38:28.080 --> 38:34.440]  let me say it again 27 trillion that's more than all the private debts you have
[38:34.440 --> 38:39.360]  in the country the corporate debts the government debts more than all all the
[38:39.360 --> 38:48.720]  debts we supposedly owe 27 trillion dollars just just type in 23.7
[38:48.720 --> 38:53.680]  trillion you'll get Bloomberg AP from two years ago or a year and a half ago
[38:53.680 --> 38:57.600]  and then about a month later they said oh and there was an additional five
[38:57.600 --> 39:05.080]  trillion so it's it's technically over 27 trillion 27 trillion and we broken
[39:05.080 --> 39:11.040]  down the numbers with economists greater than all our debt but here's the deal it
[39:11.040 --> 39:20.920]  isn't a fraction of the 1.5 quadrillion that's 1,500 trillion now but let's say
[39:20.920 --> 39:24.640]  dr. Paul Craig Roberts Webster Tarpley Bob Chapman they're wrong that it's over
[39:24.640 --> 39:31.640]  a thousand trillion let's go with the Washington Post a year ago saying it was
[39:31.640 --> 39:40.800]  six hundred and seventy four trillion and about where the guys just pulled up the 23.7 trillion
[39:40.800 --> 39:48.920]  Bloomberg headline so when I tell you it was they say 64 or 65 67 let me think
[39:48.920 --> 39:55.000]  exact memory hold on what did Washington Post say they said it was six hundred
[39:55.000 --> 40:03.760]  667 trillion guys search this Washington Post let's just test my memory here
[40:03.760 --> 40:10.480]  Washington Post derivatives US derivatives debt over 600 trillion the point
[40:10.480 --> 40:15.880]  is they say it's over 600 trillion so let's just say it's 600 trillion 600
[40:15.880 --> 40:20.760]  trillion these banking families created let's let's say it's not 1.5
[40:20.760 --> 40:24.920]  quadrillion and growing which it's is more than that but let's just say 600
[40:24.920 --> 40:30.800]  plus trillion the bankers get 27 trillion of our tax money we give them
[40:30.800 --> 40:37.040]  the money backed up our taxes our labor our work we are what underwrites all
[40:37.040 --> 40:41.280]  this is chattel slaves on record the Federal Reserve is a debt note that's
[40:41.280 --> 40:45.120]  why your dollar says a Federal Reserve note of debt for a dollar to be created
[40:45.120 --> 40:52.040]  one dollar of debt is created for for eight private families eight private
[40:52.040 --> 40:55.720]  families on record the Rockefellers the Rothschilds I'm gonna go over some of
[40:55.720 --> 41:02.200]  the names the Queen of the Netherlands the Queen of England this is a woman who
[41:02.200 --> 41:07.600]  suspends parliaments routinely owns more than half of Canada owns the
[41:07.600 --> 41:11.240]  controlling stock in British petroleum and a near controlling stock because her
[41:11.240 --> 41:16.200]  cousin has a controlling stock in Dutch roll shell these people's wealth is so
[41:16.200 --> 41:20.360]  giant it's secret and by the way it's a state secret you can type into the
[41:20.360 --> 41:24.820]  search engine Dutch roll family's wealth state secret well it's not a state
[41:24.820 --> 41:31.520]  secret that they own most the shipping lines he found it incredible job here's
[41:31.520 --> 41:36.160]  Washington post politics hamper's ever to reform the 450 trillion in derivatives
[41:36.160 --> 41:43.440]  market yeah you guys found one from April 14 2010 says 450 trillion derivatives
[41:43.440 --> 41:49.000]  I know there's another Washington post a little bit later but that says 600 plus
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  trillion I wanted to get that exact number but great job fighting that so
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.420]  they say 450 trillion the report I had was just American derivatives US
[41:56.420 --> 42:02.280]  derivatives 600 plus krill but why why debate at the point is that our entire
[42:02.280 --> 42:09.760]  national debt corporate debt private debt is less than 27 trillion now we give
[42:09.760 --> 42:16.520]  the bankers 27 trillion and they don't fix the thousands of trillions they've
[42:16.520 --> 42:22.080]  created derivatives that they've sold into the markets and and and and infested
[42:22.080 --> 42:27.200]  our pension funds contaminated the entire economic system and now their
[42:27.200 --> 42:34.960]  answer is worldwide it's the same thing in Ireland Greece Portugal Greenland I
[42:34.960 --> 42:39.000]  mean it comes out in the BBC I read this article over and over again on air
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.120]  where the head of the Irish Central Bank said yes it's true that 90 plus percent
[42:43.120 --> 42:47.640]  of this debt is not owned by Ireland but for the stability of things we are
[42:47.640 --> 42:52.120]  going to raise taxes and pay it to these foreign banks and the and the and the
[42:52.120 --> 42:56.640]  head of the federal bank actually said it's good for Ireland to be run by
[42:56.640 --> 43:02.720]  foreign banks that's a quote head of Irish Central Bank says it's good for
[43:02.720 --> 43:08.920]  foreign banks to own and run Ireland you see that's psychological warfare and I've
[43:08.920 --> 43:12.880]  read criminology reports on really good criminals if they get caught walking
[43:12.880 --> 43:17.960]  out of your house with the jewelry in their hands they'll act completely
[43:17.960 --> 43:21.440]  normal and say oh hey there was a fire I'm here to help you going in there and
[43:21.440 --> 43:25.000]  check hey how you doing they'll act normal or if they're loading stuff in the
[43:25.000 --> 43:28.120]  back of a van your neighbor comes over oh yeah we're ace moving and we're here
[43:28.120 --> 43:32.440]  to help setting oh yeah it's we don't owe this money but it's good to have
[43:32.440 --> 43:36.800]  foreign banks run us and just say it straight out yeah we're gonna stick our
[43:36.800 --> 43:41.600]  hands down your pants it's great yeah we're gonna actually go into the panties
[43:41.600 --> 43:46.040]  of Miss America in Dallas until she writes down and cries I mean they went
[43:46.040 --> 43:50.760]  in her pants in the panties remember just eight nine months ago they would
[43:50.760 --> 43:54.680]  deny that was going on we forced it out in the open with drudge drudge picking up
[43:54.680 --> 43:59.800]  our articles and videos and they went yeah we are going in the pants they found
[43:59.800 --> 44:04.400]  it there it is you guys found it the larger fight over how best to regulate
[44:04.400 --> 44:11.440]  the 600 trillion derivatives market remains unresolved wash them post now
[44:11.440 --> 44:15.440]  there you go yeah there it is Senate votes to keep small banks under
[44:15.440 --> 44:19.200]  federal reserve oversight oh oh yes the small banks that they're busy
[44:19.200 --> 44:25.080]  consolidating did you know that every Fortune 500 company that is publicly
[44:25.080 --> 44:30.480]  traded on record has either the chairman of the board or members of the
[44:30.480 --> 44:35.240]  controlling board not the CEOs they distract us with all day that are part
[44:35.240 --> 44:43.840]  of these eight families eight families on record control the issuance of
[44:43.840 --> 44:49.680]  currency and credit worldwide out of nothing and you're like well let them
[44:49.680 --> 44:53.280]  rule us you know they're great folks oh really did you know that when I read
[44:53.280 --> 44:58.120]  these eight families in every case these families openly funded eugenics
[44:58.120 --> 45:03.400]  scientific dictatorship the modern theories of psychology anthropology
[45:03.400 --> 45:10.640]  sociology biometrics is 154 years old by Sir Francis Galton as a way to
[45:10.640 --> 45:17.480]  control the public oh you think biometrics is 50 years old no look up
[45:17.480 --> 45:24.680]  biometrics these people created our entire modern scientific system to defend
[45:24.680 --> 45:29.400]  their ill-gotten gains and to learn how the human brain works and to take all
[45:29.400 --> 45:33.800]  the knowledge of the collective dictators and deceivers and systems of
[45:33.800 --> 45:38.800]  control and to publicly write blueprints and internal books like
[45:38.800 --> 45:44.480]  curl Quigley's 1968 tragedy and hope breaking down how they scientifically do
[45:44.480 --> 45:50.200]  it now when I see an article out of the examiner this is what's so frustrating
[45:50.200 --> 45:58.760]  or an article out of the Salem news or an article out of oil geopolitics when I
[45:58.760 --> 46:02.200]  read these articles it's pure torture and you know why it's pure torture
[46:02.200 --> 46:07.440]  because everything they say in these articles that I read last night that
[46:07.440 --> 46:12.080]  we're gonna post up at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com for posterity and so
[46:12.080 --> 46:16.440]  the more we'll see them everything in here is true for my research and about a
[46:16.440 --> 46:19.960]  thousand times worse and I'm not saying a thousand times worse as a joke I mean
[46:19.960 --> 46:23.720]  that oh they got Bill Gates saying they're gonna engineer the crops to
[46:23.720 --> 46:26.520]  sterilize you and they've got direct links to him saying it on video oh
[46:26.520 --> 46:31.520]  they've got the top bio scientist engineers coming out admitting that all
[46:31.520 --> 46:40.400]  these major GMO corn soybeans you name it in every case they've gone in and
[46:40.400 --> 46:47.360]  tweaked in the genetics where it causes reduction in fertility well no kidding
[46:47.360 --> 46:52.880]  I've had the top bio scientist on we've interviewed them I got a film coming out
[46:52.880 --> 46:56.560]  breaking it down where in Russia in England everywhere these scientists will
[46:56.560 --> 46:59.840]  be well we're feeding this to guinea pigs these potatoes this wheat this corn
[46:59.840 --> 47:03.480]  and within three generations they're a hundred percent sterile they've got hair
[47:03.480 --> 47:08.160]  growing in their mouth their genitals are shriveled they've got mutations in
[47:08.160 --> 47:16.120]  their intestines post birth that's not supposed to happen what's going on and
[47:16.120 --> 47:22.520]  they say don't worry publicly it's so this wheat last longer and is bigger and
[47:22.520 --> 47:25.640]  has more protein but there's other things in here we got too many people and
[47:25.640 --> 47:29.680]  then I read these reports to the public's finally starting to get this and
[47:29.680 --> 47:32.920]  I'm seeing it now everybody's starting to talk about it is such a blessing it is
[47:32.920 --> 47:37.080]  so fulfilling because no one has been more on the front lines for 16 years
[47:37.080 --> 47:41.760]  covering eugenics forced population reduction the globalist real plan this
[47:41.760 --> 47:44.800]  whole world government is not so the globalist can ride around in in
[47:44.800 --> 47:49.920]  helicopters and jets and and and rule everybody this is their planet in their
[47:49.920 --> 47:53.880]  eyes their psychopaths they couldn't do what they've done unless they were they
[47:53.880 --> 47:58.560]  enjoy murder and death and they openly say in every report that when they get
[47:58.560 --> 48:01.600]  their full government in place they are going to just fly over with drone
[48:01.600 --> 48:06.880]  helicopters and nerve gas every one of us and that's gonna go by the way that
[48:06.880 --> 48:11.640]  came out leaked Marine Corps document 12 years ago in the Marine Corps threatened
[48:11.640 --> 48:15.200]  the local Sunshine Project in Texas and had them remove it it's still on the
[48:15.200 --> 48:20.120]  Google archive though and we wrote articles about it at the time that
[48:20.120 --> 48:23.920]  they've got but but see they won't do that first they'll have control bioplegs
[48:23.920 --> 48:28.400]  lockdown cities total control they'll say oh we've got vaccines to protect you
[48:28.400 --> 48:31.920]  from it that'll further weaken you and and I want you to listen to me because
[48:31.920 --> 48:38.400]  because if we don't beat them up to that point when all this unfolds and no
[48:38.400 --> 48:41.600]  doubt by that time I won't be above ground they're not gonna allow that to
[48:41.600 --> 48:46.520]  happen you need to know it was real later when they're broadcasting on their
[48:46.520 --> 48:50.000]  emergency alert systems you know listen to them do what they say they're gonna
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.520]  take care of you cops when your wife's dropping dead your kids are vomiting their
[48:53.520 --> 48:57.680]  last guts up and you're starting to get ready to roll out and die I want you to
[48:57.680 --> 49:01.400]  at least repent to God that you serve Satan openly in the mass extermination
[49:01.400 --> 49:07.400]  program and before you hit the ground okay before you hit the ground I want
[49:07.400 --> 49:12.320]  you to remember I told you the entire plan all right because it's your soul
[49:12.320 --> 49:16.760]  that matters and some of you'll be able to dig in and they're gonna send the
[49:16.760 --> 49:21.800]  drones in after you after that happens it's it's they admit the Pentagon in
[49:21.800 --> 49:27.080]  1977 put out the Skynet documents that they then incorporated into fiction in
[49:27.080 --> 49:31.920]  movies like Terminator see they don't need troops anymore very soon everything's
[49:31.920 --> 49:37.720]  going robotic and everything's gonna be the drones and the sword robots the
[49:37.720 --> 49:41.960]  public robots they've got are vicious with microwave guns grenade launchers
[49:41.960 --> 49:47.000]  machine guns they've got smaller robots that shoot nerve gas dart sets you that
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.400]  they drop out of drones and then kill everybody in the town I mean and they're
[49:51.400 --> 49:57.000]  taking your tax money and just building gigantic secret side it's 2011 boys
[49:57.000 --> 50:05.280]  and girls okay you understand this is this is mega evil I just can't even
[50:05.280 --> 50:09.440]  believe the magnitude of it and and how do you get a public that can't even get
[50:09.440 --> 50:13.120]  upset about the Federal Reserve being private and being above the law and
[50:13.120 --> 50:16.840]  openly saying the government isn't even allowed to investigate anything they're
[50:16.840 --> 50:21.360]  doing they're openly admitting world government just as we told you they
[50:21.360 --> 50:26.240]  would as the solution to the economic crisis they've engineered and I still
[50:26.240 --> 50:30.280]  have yuppies and people at the Capitol when I was down there last week walk over
[50:30.280 --> 50:34.280]  and laugh at me as the conspiracy theorist I'm not the conspiracy theorist
[50:34.280 --> 50:39.760]  I've read all their documents that are public I know about their program I know
[50:39.760 --> 50:44.400]  about the 150-year plan I understand this is a total global corporate
[50:44.400 --> 50:47.320]  dominance what did the Romans do when they wanted to wipe out a group that
[50:47.320 --> 50:51.040]  kill everybody that's how you fully dominate a group what the Israelites do
[50:51.040 --> 50:54.840]  what does every culture do what did the Americans do to the Indians they're
[50:54.840 --> 51:01.480]  gonna wipe us all out so the world's there she got that it's coming we all
[51:01.480 --> 51:05.320]  know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in

[54:19.360 --> 54:28.760]  you know Ian Fleming was the OSS the MI6 spy chief in British intelligence and
[54:28.760 --> 54:35.520]  he wrote the James Bond novels the ones currently up into the 70s and early
[54:35.520 --> 54:40.880]  80s he wrote Moonraker under a different name where a global master industrialist
[54:40.880 --> 54:45.720]  teams up with other industrialists to release a bio weapon to kill the entire
[54:45.720 --> 54:51.960]  Earth's population so they can create a eugenics Valhalla of the perfect race but
[54:51.960 --> 54:56.000]  it's the liberal version the perfect blacks folks the perfect Asians perfect
[54:56.000 --> 55:02.560]  whites perfect Hispanics and they go off-world to this base they've built the
[55:02.560 --> 55:08.240]  space station for the one-year period while the bio weapon kills everybody but
[55:08.240 --> 55:14.520]  James Bond Roger Moore goes up and kills them well Fleming wrote essays and
[55:14.520 --> 55:20.120]  articles saying everything I put in my books is based on real things that have
[55:20.120 --> 55:23.800]  been discussed that's why the new James Bond movies Fleming's been dead for a
[55:23.800 --> 55:28.160]  long time are you know in the South America where they dam up the water the
[55:28.160 --> 55:31.920]  multinational corporation to triple the prices and bankrupt the economy to

[55:40.520 --> 55:44.880]  engineering that came out a few years ago with his life extension DNA stuff that
[55:44.880 --> 55:50.680]  they're what do you think the elite that that created thousands of trillions in

[1:08:56.360 --> 1:09:00.320]  recovery what's the plan and all of that why are they now backing off their
[1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:06.640]  previous lie that everything was all love and kisses and then long-term
[1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:12.040]  researcher into the globalist master in game plan Alan Watt will be joining us
[1:09:12.040 --> 1:09:18.640]  coming up in the third hour today now I got into this article some it's eight
[1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:23.760]  pages long I can't read the whole thing by Dean Henderson and infowars dot com
[1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:28.320]  appearing at global research dot ca the Federal Reserve cartel by the way this
[1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:32.080]  is in the top tiles of info wars dot com I want to make this a featured story as
[1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:36.160]  well they're in the featured news area the Federal Reserve cartel the eight
[1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:41.080]  families the four horsemen of banking Bank of America JP Morgan Chase city
[1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:45.960]  group and Wells Fargo own the four horsemen of oil and they go through all
[1:09:45.960 --> 1:09:51.320]  the SEC filings Exxon mobile Royal Dutch Shell BP Amaco and Chevron Texaco
[1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:55.240]  that's how they can get the oil companies to accept carbon taxes in tandem
[1:09:55.240 --> 1:09:59.960]  with Deutsche Bank BMP Barclays and other European old money behemoths but
[1:09:59.960 --> 1:10:03.440]  their monopoly over the global economy is not end at the edge of the oil patch
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:08.800]  and the article goes through with all incredibly footnoted with how they
[1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:12.760]  control and have the chairmen ships are on the boards of the entire publicly
[1:10:12.760 --> 1:10:17.600]  traded fortune 500 and it's got the families who are involved in the whole
[1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:23.800]  situation very important article up at info wars dot com meanwhile we have
[1:10:23.800 --> 1:10:28.200]  sickening trailer I don't have time to play but HBO film too big to fail
[1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:37.400]  critics trailer HBO and it worships in fact even the AP said that it makes
[1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:42.520]  Henry Paulson to be a hero and the big banks is great people I mean and every
[1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:47.120]  comment I saw on YouTube was calling him scum saying we're awake to you stop
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:54.600]  lying you're deceiving all these people in the Fed don't get fooled again and it
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:11:04.120]  is literally no one is buying them what a joke what an absolute joke I mean it
[1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:09.280]  did just four or five years ago very few Americans who the Federal Reserve was
[1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:14.200]  private now in polls upwards of 85% know it's private wanted abolished and the
[1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:19.920]  fact that we've now identified you know old-timers back in 1913 fought it and
[1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:23.360]  identified it but the fact that with the general public we've now identified the
[1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:27.400]  true illegitimate shadow government who by the way is financing all the
[1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:32.120]  tyranny the police state to suppress us on record the fact that they're now
[1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:37.720]  identified really begins the end for the New World Order and they've always known
[1:11:37.720 --> 1:11:42.920]  that that's why they say openly in their white papers we can't manage seven
[1:11:42.920 --> 1:11:46.440]  billion people on this planet we've got to get rid of these folks we've got a
[1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:51.000]  highly engineer society and drug the society and control them if you want
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:54.720]  sources on that it's a free film it's online in-game blueprint for global
[1:11:54.720 --> 1:11:58.880]  enslavement what is the in-game comm is a full bibliography of the film with
[1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:05.760]  documents the UN Ted Turner Maury strong hundreds of these people and then the
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:09.520]  university white papers the UN biological diversity assessments I mean look
[1:12:09.520 --> 1:12:13.600]  at these articles just out today the good news is when I was covering this 16
[1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:18.240]  years ago almost no one else was talking about it this was not even on the
[1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:22.200]  radar screen and if I'm proud of anything it's that we pioneered in the
[1:12:22.200 --> 1:12:28.240]  modern age confronting politicians as guerrilla journalism drive by Limbaugh
[1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:31.960]  would call it asking him real questions and watching them blow up that is now
[1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:35.720]  ubiquitous out there I'm very proud and it shows what you can do is well-getting
[1:12:35.720 --> 1:12:40.760]  others to emulate what you've done and even add to it and make it better that
[1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:44.400]  we've pioneered the modern info war against the mainstream media that we've
[1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:48.920]  pioneered getting folks to actually look at the globalist own documents and the
[1:12:48.920 --> 1:12:53.280]  scientific dictatorship I am very proud of that and proud of you the listener
[1:12:53.280 --> 1:12:57.280]  spreading the word as it's a semiotic relationship all of us together the
[1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:03.800]  examiner says GMO created foods may be used as biological weapon and then it
[1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:07.520]  goes through the whole Codex Alimentarius and links through to the
[1:13:07.520 --> 1:13:12.220]  actual documents and it links through the Salem news
[1:13:12.220 --> 1:13:16.480]  antibodies from women with a rare condition known as immune infertility
[1:13:16.480 --> 1:13:21.360]  are using the creation of GMO food there has been a concerted national effort
[1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:25.600]  by citizens that the US government labeled GMOs opposing yet our government
[1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:31.040]  intent not only to keep them unlabeled think about that in the US but efforts
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:33.760]  at the international level by the US government to remove all labeling from
[1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:38.400]  GMOs their Codex the problem is that Codex applies to food and GMOs don't
[1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:42.680]  qualify William Engdahl great researcher wrote in 2010 about USDA funded
[1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:48.040]  project to create a GM corn that sterilizes people and we've been covering
[1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:52.040]  this for a decade Engdahl picks it up now others pick see it takes time you're
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:55.720]  not gonna break this stuff out overnight it takes time and then and then it
[1:13:55.720 --> 1:13:59.480]  links to Engdahl's article that has all the sources the links Bill Gates talking
[1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:04.320]  about it on video Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation it's all there Gates saying
[1:14:04.320 --> 1:14:08.840]  we've got to reduce the population you know down to almost zero all these
[1:14:08.840 --> 1:14:13.680]  bizarre statements I mean the mosquitoes that have vaccines preloaded into them
[1:14:13.680 --> 1:14:19.760]  so you can't escape and here's the Engdahl article Bill Gates talks about
[1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:28.400]  vaccines to reduce population and then and then he goes through the USDA funded
[1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:33.680]  project to engineer this antibody into the corn it's called pharmacological
[1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:37.720]  corn and folks we're not in 1950 anymore I get emails going you can engineer
[1:14:37.720 --> 1:14:42.840]  something to corn ladies and gentlemen they have hundreds of corn crops alone
[1:14:42.840 --> 1:14:49.600]  where the corn pieces grow whatever drug they want in them and they just smash
[1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:56.480]  the corn and take the essence out of it and they've got HIV vaccines they've
[1:14:56.480 --> 1:15:02.200]  got insulin drugs I mean just hundreds of things they're releasing salmon that
[1:15:02.200 --> 1:15:08.400]  are part insect and other fish it we're not in Kansas anymore okay I'm not just
[1:15:08.400 --> 1:15:17.960]  Google spidergoats Google cow is 20% human sheep is 50% human pig is 30%
[1:15:17.960 --> 1:15:24.080]  human chimpanzee is half human and they put this in the Washington Post I mean
[1:15:24.080 --> 1:15:28.000]  they've developed all this in these thousands of laboratories now now now
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:33.440]  here's the issue they have thousands of labs randomly splicing I mean I remember
[1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:38.520]  15 years ago BBC that in Taiwan for a couple hundred dollars you could buy a
[1:15:38.520 --> 1:15:43.240]  glowing rhesus monkey that's part jellyfish and in the dark they glow
[1:15:43.240 --> 1:15:47.160]  because they have stinging cells they admitted they're miserable and they're
[1:15:47.160 --> 1:15:51.640]  in pain all the time but you know rich yuppies in Taiwan you snatch them up
[1:15:51.640 --> 1:15:56.440]  folks won't believe that guys search a monkey part glow-in-the-dark monkeys
[1:15:56.440 --> 1:16:00.960]  part jellyfish it'll be wired it'll be BBC they reported since 15 years ago about
[1:16:00.960 --> 1:16:05.440]  it a lot of times see see this is what's going on so they tell you oh this
[1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:09.400]  this potato lasts longer and tastes better but then oh magically that's just
[1:16:09.400 --> 1:16:13.880]  one genetic change they go in and make another change where in the rat studies
[1:16:13.880 --> 1:16:19.040]  and the guinea pig studies guess what reduced fertility increased cancer all
[1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:24.240]  sorts of other fun goodies and all these bowel diseases all these other
[1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:28.200]  diseases accelerating all these autoimmune diseases exploding deaths
[1:16:28.200 --> 1:16:32.280]  exploding and it's just the background noise is being turned up I'm going to
[1:16:32.280 --> 1:16:35.800]  your calls this is too important now let me give you just a little example there
[1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:41.360]  just glowing monkeys inherit jellyfish genes the genetically engineered
[1:16:41.360 --> 1:16:46.160]  primates could lead to better models for studying disease oh that's an article
[1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:50.680]  about how great it is oh and look they glow in the dark there's photos of it in
[1:16:50.680 --> 1:16:54.400]  that cute of course they really develop just like a Blade Runner for sale at
[1:16:54.400 --> 1:16:59.720]  shops genetic engineering shops in Taiwan oh it's actually in Taiwan I've
[1:16:59.720 --> 1:17:03.400]  seen newscasts like Blade Runner you walk around and oh you got a clone of
[1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:07.200]  this you got a clone oh you got this is it this pigs part human really awesome
[1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:11.480]  cool oh you got a spider weaponized spider with human genetics oh awesome I
[1:17:11.480 --> 1:17:15.720]  want one of those but but again we've got to shut down all our industry because
[1:17:15.720 --> 1:17:20.320]  carbon dioxide that plants breathe they respirate from it's deadly well that's a
[1:17:20.320 --> 1:17:24.000]  corner on all human activity now let me give an example all the top genetic
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:26.960]  engineers I've interviewed many of them were making two three million a year top
[1:17:26.960 --> 1:17:31.600]  of their class and and they would find out hey this is sterilizing all the
[1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:35.480]  guinea pigs they'd say shut up or lose your job never mind that trait we added
[1:17:35.480 --> 1:17:39.480]  well I can't be part of this oh you can't be part of this remember the famous
[1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:44.160]  British scientists went public about it then they get fired and sued and later
[1:17:44.160 --> 1:17:51.520]  get vindicated now here's the issue just one example in Latin it translates
[1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:57.840]  into English into bacteria eating virus and it was approved six years ago just
[1:17:57.840 --> 1:18:03.200]  type in viruses sprayed on meat in US they've also approved radiating the
[1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:08.040]  food marks portions are now radiated including select cutlets they also have
[1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:13.520]  a meat glue which is artificial blood put into the beef injected into it to
[1:18:13.520 --> 1:18:17.920]  beefen it up pun intended but don't believe me just type in beef glue that's
[1:18:17.920 --> 1:18:21.080]  been going on for decades it should genetically engineered artificial blood
[1:18:21.080 --> 1:18:24.960]  is one of the type of beef clues they've got some others they're made up of
[1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:29.600]  other animal blood and they and they they actually grow the fake steaks but
[1:18:29.600 --> 1:18:33.360]  again you don't believe me just enjoy it now now now they spread that these are
[1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:39.120]  vaccines they have giant facilities huge tanks where they breed and of course
[1:18:39.120 --> 1:18:41.720]  they can breed other things that they want but most of time it is an accident
[1:18:41.720 --> 1:18:48.200]  and then all these mega funguses resistant E. coli forms and now resistant
[1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:54.200]  E. coli is in the entire food chain oh don't believe me 1966 Pentagon was
[1:18:54.200 --> 1:19:01.160]  looking at weaponized E. coli when Rumsfeld had just gotten over there later
[1:19:01.160 --> 1:19:04.800]  at Surle he got it approved it's known as aspartame and these weaponized
[1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:11.320]  bacteria they feed them forms of toxic waste then they defecate a toxic but
[1:19:11.320 --> 1:19:16.800]  addictive nerve agent excitotoxin now admitted in the mainline literature that
[1:19:16.800 --> 1:19:20.640]  is an addictive system that eats holes in your brain other organs called
[1:19:20.640 --> 1:19:25.560]  aspartame now in tens of thousands of products you can't find even sugar gum
[1:19:25.560 --> 1:19:30.680]  that doesn't have it added now I challenge you to very hard now that's an
[1:19:30.680 --> 1:19:34.120]  example of the genetically engineered E. coli that's now openly in the
[1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:37.160]  environment oh you didn't know that's what aspartame is oh don't believe me
[1:19:37.160 --> 1:19:42.840]  just search aspartame manufacturing process now the reason I raised that is
[1:19:42.840 --> 1:19:47.280]  we've got all these deaths with E. coli and that it's a mutant now the scientists
[1:19:47.280 --> 1:19:51.760]  have had on it warned that spraying these live vaccines live viruses on the
[1:19:51.760 --> 1:19:55.800]  meat to eat the bacteria so they're just giving you clean meat would cause
[1:19:55.800 --> 1:19:59.600]  mutations and that's really the evidence shows what's causing all this we'll be

[1:22:20.200 --> 1:22:24.960]  control the United Nations would take over America the trilateral Commission
[1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:29.520]  would control the world invisible Empire Chronicles how men of power and
[1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:33.440]  influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive
[1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:37.480]  world government I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a
[1:22:37.480 --> 1:22:41.160]  world constitution for the global financial system global governance with
[1:22:41.160 --> 1:22:45.440]  the establishment of the G20 so it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then
[1:22:45.440 --> 1:22:50.760]  everyone else and I got news for you you're everyone invisible Empire secure

[1:24:00.920 --> 1:24:10.000]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network the
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:20.400]  Hadron superconducting supercollider on the border of Switzerland and France
[1:24:20.400 --> 1:24:26.600]  they admittedly are trying to create any manner strangelets black holes and they
[1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:29.640]  admit they don't know what's gonna happen but it's a low probability that
[1:24:29.640 --> 1:24:32.440]  it could create something that will destroy the planet well they have
[1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:38.240]  another name for a strangelet and well it's basically in the same family from
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:45.640]  the quantum mechanics that I've researched and that is a quark glue on
[1:24:45.640 --> 1:24:56.040]  plasma and major publications are reporting on this here's a headline
[1:24:56.040 --> 1:25:01.280]  large Hadron collider creates incredibly dense pre-mortial matter they're
[1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:04.640]  trying to recreate the big bang now that's really smart the large Hadron
[1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:08.880]  collider see with with stuff 111 years old that max plank envisioned in his
[1:25:08.880 --> 1:25:14.240]  mind in Germany he wrote out the atomic theorems for atomic energy atomic
[1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:18.600]  weapons and then it was envisioned well they've envisioned these and now they've
[1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:22.800]  made one and if it ever starts grabbing mass it will fall to the center of the
[1:25:22.800 --> 1:25:27.680]  earth and we'll do what you've seen in Star Trek but here's another artist
[1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:32.040]  rendering of the latest Star Trek movie where they send in the heavy particle
[1:25:32.040 --> 1:25:38.760]  to the center of the planet and first it falls in reality it takes a few years
[1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:42.680]  to start doubling and then once it starts exponentially growing once that
[1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:46.080]  happens and we'll show you the Star Trek version as well then just within a
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:51.600]  matter of seconds your entire planet collapses into a black hole how does
[1:25:51.600 --> 1:25:55.240]  that sound then it sucks the Sun in and gets bigger and these things are all
[1:25:55.240 --> 1:25:59.360]  over the galaxy and in our photograph and other galaxies just thousands of
[1:25:59.360 --> 1:26:03.240]  black holes super black holes they're all over the place and let's make one
[1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:08.400]  here you know 111 year old technology can destroy the earth today but let's
[1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:13.520]  just do all this now here today again and I talk about this in yuppie send me
[1:26:13.520 --> 1:26:16.920]  emails giggling about it because if you giggle about it everything's okay and
[1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:21.120]  they call me anti-technology no I'm not anti-technology I'm not anti shotgun I
[1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:25.600]  don't shoot myself in the foot with it though and these scientists are
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:28.600]  megalomaniacs playing God that means they write about it well this may destroy
[1:26:28.600 --> 1:26:32.640]  the earth but we're gonna do it because we've got to see what happens here's
[1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:37.080]  another artist rendering of what the beginning of the black hole will look
[1:26:37.080 --> 1:26:41.080]  like and a lot of top physicists have gone on record saying that this is a
[1:26:41.080 --> 1:26:44.320]  probability of happening because they're gonna do thousands of these tests
[1:26:44.320 --> 1:26:49.080]  and they've now made one of these but it didn't get enough mass and imploded so
[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:53.800]  but here it is the Large Hadron Collider has created a super dense building
[1:26:53.800 --> 1:26:58.840]  block of existence scientists operating Large Hadron Collider have announced the
[1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:04.440]  creation of a new instance of quark glue on plasma the densest form of matter
[1:27:04.440 --> 1:27:10.440]  ever observed by humanity the unique material is 100,000 times hotter than
[1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:14.200]  the Sun that's a good idea to make that and denser than any known object other
[1:27:14.200 --> 1:27:19.040]  than a black hole very smart if because it is a precursor of a black hole to put
[1:27:19.040 --> 1:27:22.240]  this in perspective somewhat a neutron star said to be approximately as dense
[1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:28.160]  as the entire a human population compressed into a sugar cube via and it
[1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:32.960]  goes on I know but it gets the point across quark glue on plasma is denser
[1:27:32.960 --> 1:27:39.400]  than that the LHC team leader David Evans says if you have a cubic centimeter
[1:27:39.400 --> 1:27:44.640]  of this stuff it would weigh 40 billion tons that's a very good idea to make
[1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:51.400]  that here on the planet we're basically ghosts compared to this okay we don't
[1:27:51.400 --> 1:27:58.880]  exist compared to this it's its weight is so close approaching infinity okay it
[1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:02.360]  will go right through the earth like a dose of salts they won't go all the way
[1:28:02.360 --> 1:28:05.120]  throughout the other end that wouldn't be that big of a problem that would
[1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:11.840]  reseal it will go to the highest gravity well point in the middle of the spinning
[1:28:11.840 --> 1:28:16.040]  core of the earth and then it will suck everything in on it that that's a really
[1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:20.960]  good idea I tell you the globalists in their quest to be God are gonna just
[1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:25.800]  probably destroy us somehow a material such as this can exist in its current
[1:28:25.800 --> 1:28:29.440]  quantity without destroying everything we know and love the va va he goes on to
[1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:34.840]  say it's believed the universe existed as a quark glue on plasma until it
[1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:40.240]  cooled into what we've made of today the LHC created it by smashing together
[1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:46.360]  lead ions and nearly the speed of light another fabulous idea you know you you
[1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:50.600]  smash uranium and plutonium together and you blow up cities hey let's speed a
[1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:55.960]  light let into each other oh we we made the particles let's do it again right
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:28:59.320]  now sorry I didn't get to your calls this is pretty important jaren brought to
[1:28:59.320 --> 1:29:04.520]  my attention and to show you how jaded I am I saw this a few weeks ago I think
[1:29:04.520 --> 1:29:10.360]  it was a new scientist they were like oh wonderful we made the quark glue on
[1:29:10.360 --> 1:29:17.160]  plasma I remember eight years ago the San Francisco Chronicle an Air Force
[1:29:17.160 --> 1:29:20.920]  General was given a speech you said yeah we've made successfully made any
[1:29:20.920 --> 1:29:27.120]  matter but it's classified oh wonderful idea absolutely wonderful idea 30 years
[1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:37.440]  ago they had fish infusion reactors they artificially made many suns you know
[1:29:37.440 --> 1:29:40.120]  more than half the scientists the Manhattan Project thought that when
[1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:43.960]  they detonated the first a bomb it was gonna burn up the entire world's
[1:29:43.960 --> 1:29:48.080]  atmosphere but guess what they still did it and then they tried to blow up the
[1:29:48.080 --> 1:29:54.040]  Van Allen radiation belt remember that we're on the March the Empire's on the
[1:29:54.040 --> 1:30:02.800]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good
[1:30:02.800 --> 1:30:06.800]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[1:30:06.800 --> 1:30:10.600]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[1:30:10.600 --> 1:30:14.640]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:30:14.640 --> 1:30:18.880]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[1:30:18.880 --> 1:30:23.160]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[1:30:23.160 --> 1:30:27.120]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[1:30:27.120 --> 1:30:31.280]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[1:30:31.280 --> 1:30:35.240]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[1:30:35.240 --> 1:30:39.400]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[1:30:39.400 --> 1:30:43.160]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[1:30:43.160 --> 1:30:46.680]  powered generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[1:30:46.680 --> 1:30:52.640]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[1:30:52.640 --> 1:30:57.400]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[1:30:57.400 --> 1:31:03.640]  1-877-327-0365 it could never happen in America but it's happening right now
[1:31:03.640 --> 1:31:07.920]  gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families as gas
[1:31:07.920 --> 1:31:11.880]  prices and crop failures push high food cost you can still get the best food on

[1:32:00.680 --> 1:32:05.760]  very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[1:32:05.760 --> 1:32:10.280]  important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything
[1:32:10.280 --> 1:32:14.680]  about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate your children and even
[1:32:14.680 --> 1:32:17.800]  how you take care of your health and your own family now this man has made
[1:32:17.800 --> 1:32:21.960]  some outrageous predictions of the years the crazy part is he's usually right
[1:32:21.960 --> 1:32:26.280]  you see he predicted the collapse of GM Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's
[1:32:26.280 --> 1:32:30.600]  biggest mall owner General Growth Properties in fact Barron's called his work a
[1:32:30.600 --> 1:32:34.840]  dire prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for free
[1:32:34.840 --> 1:32:38.520]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye

[1:33:48.000 --> 1:34:00.560]  don't explain I recall Central Park and fall how you tore your dress what a mess
[1:34:00.560 --> 1:34:06.680]  I can't Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Central Standard Time we
[1:34:06.680 --> 1:34:11.160]  are here live but ladies and gentlemen and I'm gonna get to your phone calls I
[1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:17.880]  promise but I start getting into monkeys that are parked jellyfish spiders that
[1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:22.920]  are part goat part human chimpanzees that are part human and medical
[1:34:22.920 --> 1:34:27.280]  experimentation all of this going on and you tell the general public they laugh
[1:34:27.280 --> 1:34:33.920]  at you because they think of it as some 1950s horror movie or they think of it as
[1:34:33.920 --> 1:34:36.640]  that movie that came out last year I didn't see it but I read about it splice
[1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:40.840]  this stuff is going on and from all the scientists we've interviewed across the
[1:34:40.840 --> 1:34:47.160]  board and mainline top scientists they say when you start splicing species you
[1:34:47.160 --> 1:34:52.480]  give rise to mega viruses mega bacteria deadly mutations you create
[1:34:52.480 --> 1:34:59.640]  zoological bridges where animal diseases that humans couldn't get can now get and
[1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:05.600]  then you read about Europe E. coli outbreak caused by toxic new mutation
[1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:11.440]  strain E. coli outbreak infects 1,600 across Europe as scientists search for
[1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:16.760]  cause well I don't know the cause of this but I know a lot of the new mutant
[1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:20.000]  strains that are coming out just like when they have vaccine tests that end up
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:23.600]  killing people it's kept very quiet oh you'll see a few news articles that oh
[1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:30.120]  wow they gave 40 homeless people you know in one town in Poland this flu shot
[1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:36.320]  and 30 of them died wow well of course they were testing it look at how our
[1:35:36.320 --> 1:35:39.880]  troops get tested on look at how the black folks in this country were given
[1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:44.840]  syphilis now we learn ongoing in Latin America with our government telling kids
[1:35:44.840 --> 1:35:48.320]  they're getting a vaccine shooting them up with syphilis shooting them up with
[1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:51.920]  polio they got caught just last year and the year before that the year before
[1:35:51.920 --> 1:35:56.520]  that the UN the UN got caught in the 90s all over the world with a whole bunch
[1:35:56.520 --> 1:35:59.800]  of different manufacturers showing it wasn't an accident adding a female
[1:35:59.800 --> 1:36:03.640]  hormone to a tetanus shot that created an autoimmune response to the hormone
[1:36:03.640 --> 1:36:08.240]  bound to the tetanus pathogen which then caused autoimmune response that
[1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:12.960]  caused spontaneous abortions at the start of the second trimester when the
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:16.640]  female releases that particular hormone and it turns out the UN did it as a
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:20.600]  soft kill because they don't want to just keep you from having a baby they
[1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:24.640]  want to try to kill the mother and so having those miscarriages over and over
[1:36:24.640 --> 1:36:28.440]  again in those third world conditions is a really great way to kill these women
[1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:32.880]  I mean ladies and gentlemen they were caught look it up you've got to come to
[1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:39.000]  grips with how evil these people are that are playing God with our society
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:45.240]  now I want to just tell listeners this is a listener supported broadcast we're
[1:36:45.240 --> 1:36:49.480]  not funded by the New World Order or we're not funded by David Rockefeller
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:53.800]  we're funded by our sponsors and you the listeners and everything I do is
[1:36:53.800 --> 1:36:57.680]  symbiotic it's about getting the word out and also funding the operation to get
[1:36:57.680 --> 1:37:01.320]  the word out on radio TV and future films and we're building the operation
[1:37:01.320 --> 1:37:06.360]  thanks to your support check out info wars.com for all the books the videos
[1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:10.960]  the films now we've got two well actually three new t-shirts this week one of
[1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:15.040]  them is the classic info wars design just with info wars.com across the front

[1:39:45.120 --> 1:39:50.040]  Victoria thanks for holding hello hey good to good to have you on with us go
[1:39:50.040 --> 1:39:53.920]  ahead thank you very much Alex I just want to thank you for everything that
[1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:58.200]  that you do every day for humanity and I wanted to let you know I just renewed
[1:39:58.200 --> 1:40:03.360]  my annual prison planet TV membership as well and I feel the same way that you
[1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:08.560]  do the evil ones that call themselves the elite are horrible creatures that
[1:40:08.560 --> 1:40:13.600]  are evil incarnate and what hurts me the most is that the image you know that
[1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:18.320]  they give of America to the rest of the world to make us look like we're the
[1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:21.880]  ones doing this instead you know of them being the one that's why they're
[1:40:21.880 --> 1:40:26.480]  masters they they wrap all their evil the American flag while they fund their
[1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:31.680]  wars and domination eugenics with our money while they destroy America at the
[1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:36.160]  same time anything that stands that sovereign that's independent that
[1:40:36.160 --> 1:40:41.080]  self-sufficient is an enemy of the parasites that's right and this
[1:40:41.080 --> 1:40:45.760]  hegemony like you said is not coming from the American people and I want the
[1:40:45.760 --> 1:40:50.560]  rest of the world to know that that we get treated almost the same way because
[1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:55.680]  they poison our food our water to take our money you know our air and the
[1:40:55.680 --> 1:41:00.040]  neurotoxins and all this through the immunization shots and how they hurt the
[1:41:00.040 --> 1:41:05.600]  little kids Victoria we have Bill Gates we have all these world leaders on record
[1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:09.640]  going back even to the 20s and 30s openly saying we're gonna put
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:13.520]  steroids and vaccines we're gonna put it in food they have US government grants
[1:41:13.520 --> 1:41:18.760]  and programs to develop the rice the corn and then they roll it out and other
[1:41:18.760 --> 1:41:23.720]  GMO varieties have the same effect they're doing it they're caught it's
[1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:28.720]  it's so it's but people come face to face with something this evil but it's
[1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:32.960]  clean-cut it's wearing a suit and they just can't believe it that's why women
[1:41:32.960 --> 1:41:36.880]  got in the car with Ted Bundy he was well-spoken he was wearing a suit they
[1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:41.080]  got in the car an hour later they were chained down in a barn with him torture
[1:41:41.080 --> 1:41:44.440]  in the daylight side of them they just can't believe it's happening and that's
[1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:50.680]  why it's now gonna happen again again look at human history what a most
[1:41:50.680 --> 1:41:54.880]  governments end up doing Victoria in their histories how do governments in
[1:41:54.880 --> 1:42:00.560]  what always happens was true and as you know like I'm a teacher and everything
[1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:04.200]  and one of the things that I'm into is history and in an effort to do my part
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:08.440]  because I remember you know hearing you like a week ago or so calling for other
[1:42:08.440 --> 1:42:12.240]  people to step up and do things and I have different websites but I decided to
[1:42:12.240 --> 1:42:17.200]  do one that was patriotic and I gave it a great patriotic name I am free
[1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:21.360]  america.com because I want people to know that even though they're doing this
[1:42:21.360 --> 1:42:25.720]  that we are still free and we have to exercise our freedoms while we can so I
[1:42:25.720 --> 1:42:31.040]  took a document that was 96 years old with these fallen ones bragging about
[1:42:31.040 --> 1:42:35.840]  how they took over the banking system and then mocking America to be the last
[1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:40.960]  dominoes of all in their endgame and I made it into an mp3 and I put it up on
[1:42:40.960 --> 1:42:47.600]  that site www.imfreeamerica.com. Great job Victoria awesome job gonna jump and
[1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:51.680]  everybody needs to start their own webcast their own YouTube channel their

[1:44:44.200 --> 1:44:48.480]  proud we're not scared to speak out for people we're not sheep and then I told
[1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:51.640]  that one story of being laughed at by three or four people inside that big
[1:44:51.640 --> 1:44:55.400]  giant gas station on 360 you know it's got all these pumps tons of people
[1:44:55.400 --> 1:45:00.960]  outside and I walk out into the beautiful spring day and the every every pump
[1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:04.520]  is full and there are people walking in and cars parked where I was freaked out
[1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:09.800]  depressed wow that that building was full of ring-raith minions and I walk out
[1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:14.800]  and literally everybody goes Alex Jones hey death the new order and it was like
[1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:18.040]  you know people with their kayaks and college students and old people and
[1:45:18.040 --> 1:45:22.120]  young folks are all high five yeah yeah we're gonna beat him but see it's it's
[1:45:22.120 --> 1:45:27.000]  those two different worlds it's those two different worlds because usually I don't
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:30.600]  walk out of a place I'm a go Alex Jones people say Alex how you doing but it was
[1:45:30.600 --> 1:45:34.160]  almost like a spiritual moment we're inside I'm being laughed at and it's
[1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:37.520]  and so I stand up to them folks outside don't hear me I'll walk through the big
[1:45:37.520 --> 1:45:44.960]  double doors and boom it's just just like a spontaneous yay we're beating them
[1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:49.320]  I'm sad issue let's go ahead and go back to your calls John in Texas you're on
[1:45:49.320 --> 1:45:54.080]  the air welcome hi Alex hey buddy I want I wanted to talk about a people
[1:45:54.080 --> 1:45:57.560]  pharmacy column it was in the Chronicle about Houston Chronicle about a month
[1:45:57.560 --> 1:46:02.040]  ago talking about salt they said that salt does not affect your blood pressure
[1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:05.720]  one way or the other now they got hundreds of studies the statins actually
[1:46:05.720 --> 1:46:09.800]  kill you make you have heart attacks destroy the brain it's all on record
[1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:13.160]  everything they give you to keep you alive is designed to kill you sorry go
[1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:19.280]  ahead they said that low sodium can lead to heart disease another hell no I might
[1:46:19.280 --> 1:46:23.200]  add that no salt can kill you but when you go to a grocery store what do you see
[1:46:23.200 --> 1:46:29.760]  now everything's low sodium no sodium all right that bullshit make New York
[1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:33.680]  Mayor Bloomberg but trying to trying to force all the restaurants to cut back
[1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:37.040]  under salt it's just part of the eugenics we're not trying to force them
[1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:41.000]  he's saying what is it three thousand dollar fines guys search three thousand
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:44.480]  dollar fines for salt in New York no it's total control we're gonna say what
[1:46:44.480 --> 1:46:47.120]  type of toilet we're gonna say what type of light bulb we're gonna say what
[1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:49.840]  you're gonna eat we're gonna tell you you can't bring a school lunch for your
[1:46:49.840 --> 1:46:53.280]  kids we're gonna run your life we're gonna watch you we're gonna stick our
[1:46:53.280 --> 1:46:56.560]  hands down your pants we're gonna force statins and other drugs in the water
[1:46:56.560 --> 1:47:00.960]  and lithium we're gonna do it cuz we care about you cuz we're so nice I'm
[1:47:00.960 --> 1:47:04.680]  sorry go ahead they're trying to cut the salt back because they want to kill
[1:47:04.680 --> 1:47:07.760]  you off as part of the eugenics program everybody's gonna fall for this come
[1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:11.960]  back under salt and they're starting to start dying a hundred salt is used in
[1:47:11.960 --> 1:47:15.680]  all electrochemical processes in the body it's it's one of the most vital
[1:47:15.680 --> 1:47:20.160]  things next to water the difference is if you're eating it's the artificial
[1:47:20.160 --> 1:47:25.120]  salts like like monosodium glutamate that are deadly excitotoxins but notice
[1:47:25.120 --> 1:47:30.080]  Bloomberg and worried about that you need salt you need mineral natural based
[1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:35.040]  salt and the more sun you get you know the the more you I mean obviously you
[1:47:35.040 --> 1:47:38.560]  don't need a lot of salt if you lay around all day and don't ever exercise
[1:47:38.560 --> 1:47:43.400]  too much salt can be a problem but but absolutely the ratios of how much salt
[1:47:43.400 --> 1:47:47.560]  they say should have I mean that's what's so dangerous about them telling you
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:52.280]  and setting the parameters for everything yeah that's what I mean back
[1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:57.440]  in the ancient times that's what they say their their soldiers and their
[1:47:57.440 --> 1:48:00.760]  workers they tell you when you watch the illegal aliens coming to gas station at
[1:48:00.760 --> 1:48:06.320]  six o'clock they've been outside working all day those guys have all got soft
[1:48:06.320 --> 1:48:11.280]  drinks from Mexico they have real sugar and they're buying little bags of
[1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:15.680]  flavored salt and they're dumping it in their mouths obviously they I mean they
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:20.160]  would die out in the heat if they didn't have that it's electrolytes again
[1:48:20.160 --> 1:48:24.680]  they know but the yuppies don't you got these yuppies collapsing on these long
[1:48:24.680 --> 1:48:29.680]  bike rides because they won't get any salt they think salt's evil well that's
[1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:33.480]  what uh but it's just part of the eugenics program Alex that's what the
[1:48:33.480 --> 1:48:36.800]  people need to realize that you got to have salt to live in and if you if you
[1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:41.080]  cut salt all to your diet you're gonna get sick and you're gonna die sir I was
[1:48:41.080 --> 1:48:44.600]  talking to I don't know I'm allowed to get into this well Ted's told me I can
[1:48:44.600 --> 1:48:48.520]  talk about I'm not gonna say much you know Ted's dad Ted Anderson had gotten
[1:48:48.520 --> 1:48:52.680]  Alzheimer's so bad that he didn't really know who he was and Ted was real sad
[1:48:52.680 --> 1:48:55.200]  because he couldn't really take him fishing or anything anymore and for a
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:48:59.680]  few months he got him on vitamins and minerals liquid ones and they went to
[1:48:59.680 --> 1:49:04.440]  the doctor and the doctor said well he's on Cumin which is a blood thinner an
[1:49:04.440 --> 1:49:07.800]  ingredient a rat poison he knows never had a stroke or heart attack they don't
[1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:11.100]  tell him take aspirin it's a lot better than that for my research and Ted said
[1:49:11.100 --> 1:49:15.440]  yeah the last doctor had him for a long time on on aspirin but but see it'll get
[1:49:15.440 --> 1:49:18.720]  to charge you as much money if it's aspirin so they want to give you
[1:49:18.720 --> 1:49:21.920]  Cumin in because it's not over the counter they got to take blood test every
[1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:28.120]  you know a few weeks to test so they get money out of it and and just now they
[1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:31.720]  they told him get off these minerals you don't need them they're bad and they
[1:49:31.720 --> 1:49:35.560]  said they did a blood test and said oh you had almost zero vitamin K but now
[1:49:35.560 --> 1:49:40.000]  your vitamin K's up which you're supposed to have and his dad's skin was
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:43.960]  falling off you know old folks just like literally swords everywhere the skin
[1:49:43.960 --> 1:49:48.240]  got healed in just a few months he knew he was again it was like Valhalla and
[1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:53.320]  they just said no no because when you're on Cumin and you can't have vitamin K
[1:49:53.320 --> 1:49:58.160]  they say or the blood gets thick again and that's the end of it and now his
[1:49:58.160 --> 1:50:06.840]  dad doesn't know who he is again and the issue is the doctor said no no no no and
[1:50:06.840 --> 1:50:11.080]  then they'll argue well we live longer than we used to oh really type into the
[1:50:11.080 --> 1:50:16.000]  search engine US life expectancy drops now see the way they do this is they

[1:55:21.160 --> 1:55:24.720]  week if you can do it on your traveling for a full 30 minutes or an hour but
[1:55:24.720 --> 1:55:32.600]  Catherine this they tell us oh maybe maybe we're the recessions ongoing when
[1:55:32.600 --> 1:55:36.240]  we're really in a depression Wall Street's making record profits the
[1:55:36.240 --> 1:55:39.880]  mega banks are but suddenly they're saying oh maybe the recovery never
[1:55:39.880 --> 1:55:44.760]  happened where is the economy right now now they're saying I guess QE3 is coming
[1:55:44.760 --> 1:55:51.240]  where are we right now Alex the economy is is looking its way through what I
[1:55:51.240 --> 1:55:57.280]  call a slow burn and the slow burn is a process whereby the insiders steadily
[1:55:57.280 --> 1:56:02.680]  drain off subsidy from the outsiders and of course now we're not just eating
[1:56:02.680 --> 1:56:07.320]  through the fat we're eating through the muscle and it's very painful and it's
[1:56:07.320 --> 1:56:13.160]  a structural change what you're doing is here what we've we've we've rebalanced
[1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:18.280]  the economy so that so that manufacturing in many and a lot of
[1:56:18.280 --> 1:56:23.840]  agriculture is much more a global trade and that's having a devastating impact
[1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:28.760]  to the middle class in the United States in Europe because what we've done is we
[1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:33.280]  sort of taken the retirement savings of the baby boomers and shifted it out of
[1:56:33.280 --> 1:56:38.160]  investment here and into investment in the emerging markets and space and as a
[1:56:38.160 --> 1:56:43.480]  result a lot of people are waking up now and and they're both their financial
[1:56:43.480 --> 1:56:47.200]  situation and their political situation has changed radically everybody
[1:56:47.200 --> 1:56:52.120]  remembers Ross Perot warning us well it's finally coming true and that's what's
[1:56:52.120 --> 1:56:58.280]  happening you're watching a very major structural long-term adjustment of the
[1:56:58.280 --> 1:57:04.240]  of the baby boomers aging and the money having been pulled out and gone and now
[1:57:04.240 --> 1:57:08.880]  we're now you worked on the inside though you break it down I mean this is
[1:57:08.880 --> 1:57:15.480]  strategic this is planned yes this is absolutely plant this is you know it's
[1:57:15.480 --> 1:57:19.800]  very interesting in that in the 90s early 90s we knew that this is all
[1:57:19.800 --> 1:57:25.280]  happening with the change in the global rules whether it was the NAFTA agreement
[1:57:25.280 --> 1:57:29.040]  to the Uruguay round of cat and so we knew that the jobs are gonna leave
[1:57:29.040 --> 1:57:34.680]  America and the funny thing about it was that you know we knew what we needed to
[1:57:34.680 --> 1:57:38.080]  do we needed to help build new skills and we needed people to pay down their
[1:57:38.080 --> 1:57:44.760]  debt instead we had a debt bubble we did the opposite and that was the way of
[1:57:44.760 --> 1:57:49.000]  pulling fast amounts of money out of the economy and literally everybody
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:53.080]  financially party not realizing that there was gonna be hell to pay at the
[1:57:53.080 --> 1:57:58.320]  end and so what we did was you know I called it the fraudulent inducement of
[1:57:58.320 --> 1:58:03.240]  America rather than encouraging people to save and and pay down their debt and
[1:58:03.240 --> 1:58:07.640]  learn new skills so that they could be more competitive in a global economy we
[1:58:07.640 --> 1:58:11.800]  encourage them to build and buy bigger houses and take on more debt and in a
[1:58:11.800 --> 1:58:16.120]  misbehaved so and why shouldn't they because the the Rothschilds the
[1:58:16.120 --> 1:58:19.960]  Rockefellers and others that you know that control the big private banks they
[1:58:19.960 --> 1:58:23.800]  make it all out of nothing and then get the world they want us dependent and so
[1:58:23.800 --> 1:58:27.360]  that's why they launch these credit cards into you know college students with
[1:58:27.360 --> 1:58:32.080]  no jobs mailboxes to get them into debt all part of a plan we're gonna come back
[1:58:32.080 --> 1:58:36.880]  in one minute for a final five minutes with our guest to look at where she sees
[1:58:36.880 --> 1:58:43.040]  the economy going from here as Moody's warns of the US losing credit rating you

[2:00:05.280 --> 2:00:13.040]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:00:13.040 --> 2:00:20.600]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[2:00:20.600 --> 2:00:24.160]  Alex Jones
[2:00:32.480 --> 2:00:38.160]  all right Catherine Austin Fitz big news just breaking at drudgereport.com
[2:00:38.160 --> 2:00:42.000]  we're getting it up at info wars.com and prisonpunna.com right now we're going to
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:46.480]  integrate it in with the standard and pours what just two months ago said the
[2:00:46.480 --> 2:00:50.720]  US is in danger of losing a triple A rating meaning instead of you know owing
[2:00:50.720 --> 2:00:55.120]  14 trillion it would it would go up exponentially to the bankers to the
[2:00:55.120 --> 2:01:00.640]  insiders now Moody's Warren's risk of US losing its credit rating I mean it looks
[2:01:00.640 --> 2:01:07.280]  like the big implosion is getting close what do you see well I'm skeptical of a
[2:01:07.280 --> 2:01:12.440]  big implosion I think we have a political explosion about to happen Alex
[2:01:12.440 --> 2:01:17.200]  which is if you look at the budget there's a competition between interest
[2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:22.760]  on the on the dead the military and retirees and I think part of what you're
[2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:29.600]  watching is a political move to set the retirees to get their benefits cut and
[2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:34.600]  and that this is really a political explosion more than an economic implosion
[2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:41.920]  so I'm skeptical because if you look at the fundamental economics there doesn't
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:48.520]  you know the US credit rating doesn't have to as an economic matter get worse
[2:01:48.520 --> 2:01:53.000]  and so I'm I'm a little I'm not saying they're not running it highly
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:57.160]  irresponsible or financially irresponsible way but I think what
[2:01:57.160 --> 2:02:08.640]  you're watching is a political move underway expand on that okay so if you
[2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:14.280]  look at the federal budget we're running very significant deficits and and for
[2:02:14.280 --> 2:02:19.960]  many many years the baby boomers my generation has been net energy plus we
[2:02:19.960 --> 2:02:23.400]  put our money in Social Security and that money is used to finance the deficit
[2:02:23.400 --> 2:02:28.680]  well now that we've started to retire of course it's turning that negative and so
[2:02:28.680 --> 2:02:33.120]  if you're the Congress or the Senate your big question is well am I going to
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:36.360]  continue to pay the interest on the debt well yes I want to do that because I
[2:02:36.360 --> 2:02:40.440]  want to continue to float the debt or do I want to pay the military well yes I
[2:02:40.440 --> 2:02:43.280]  do because they're running around the world making sure the Chinese buy more
[2:02:43.280 --> 2:02:48.080]  treasuries or do I want to pay the retirees who are now net net cash flow
[2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:54.080]  negative to the budget and so that's the politically weak group and and if you
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:58.800]  look at the national debt we have tremendous amounts of contingent
[2:02:58.800 --> 2:03:02.280]  liabilities for Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid so there's a
[2:03:02.280 --> 2:03:06.800]  political squeeze coming where now that you shift off the retirees money you're
[2:03:06.800 --> 2:03:10.800]  going to cut their benefits and so I think what you're watching is the
[2:03:10.800 --> 2:03:14.640]  positioning of all the parties in the financial ecosystem to start to say oh
[2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:19.440]  well the responsible thing to do is to cut Social Security and cut Medicare
[2:03:19.440 --> 2:03:25.280]  Medicaid and to cut the sort of social safety net and and that's part of this
[2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:29.160]  move so I think yeah they're getting ready for the austerity but then the
[2:03:29.160 --> 2:03:32.120]  taxes will still go up because they've now gotten us in this third world
[2:03:32.120 --> 2:03:35.640]  position where everything goes to the private bankers who got all this
[2:03:35.640 --> 2:03:40.600]  through fraud well if you if you want to ask where the money is I mean the
[2:03:40.600 --> 2:03:46.000]  first thing I would ask is not sort of looking at the federal deficit today we
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:49.120]  know that there are trains of dollars that went missing in the federal
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:53.040]  government and and their trains of dollars that disappeared on the bail
[2:03:53.040 --> 2:03:57.120]  out and so my attitude I think of this is like a milk bucket that's got a hole
[2:03:57.120 --> 2:04:01.400]  in the bottom where money is is disappearing into all these places
[2:04:01.400 --> 2:04:05.800]  mysteriously and people keep telling me there's no milk in the milk bucket and
[2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:09.160]  I have to put more in well my attitude is first of all I want to know where all
[2:04:09.160 --> 2:04:13.200]  the money disappeared to then I want to stop the whole because I don't want to
[2:04:13.200 --> 2:04:16.360]  put more milk in a bucket that's got a hole in the bottom but now we know thanks
[2:04:16.360 --> 2:04:19.760]  to some of the lawsuits by AP and Bloomberg that almost all of it went
[2:04:19.760 --> 2:04:24.600]  to offshore classic Rothschild banks and things like that so I mean we've just
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:28.320]  been completely if you look at this amount of money Alex it's much too much
[2:04:28.320 --> 2:04:32.120]  money to just make the Rothschilds rich in other words you know you're you're
[2:04:32.120 --> 2:04:37.840]  talking about trains and trains of dollars that is a fundamental difference
[2:04:37.840 --> 2:04:43.000]  in how the the whole planet is being they're sucking the blood out to rewrite
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:47.960]  the planet incredible do you agree with that statement right the reengineering
[2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:52.280]  governance on planet Earth it's that big and and that's the issue that's got to
[2:04:52.280 --> 2:04:57.000]  be dealt with before we decide who put here yet great jobs salari.com we'll
[2:04:57.000 --> 2:05:01.840]  talk to you again soon okay now and watch straight ahead
[2:05:01.840 --> 2:05:06.760]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[2:05:06.760 --> 2:05:11.320]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[2:05:11.320 --> 2:05:15.280]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[2:05:15.280 --> 2:05:19.760]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[2:05:19.760 --> 2:05:24.560]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American

[2:05:38.520 --> 2:05:42.000]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:47.240]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[2:05:47.240 --> 2:05:52.920]  have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on dvd

[2:06:03.480 --> 2:06:07.800]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[2:06:07.800 --> 2:06:11.160]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[2:06:11.160 --> 2:06:15.080]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[2:06:15.080 --> 2:06:19.280]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[2:06:19.280 --> 2:06:23.720]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[2:06:23.720 --> 2:06:28.480]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[2:06:28.480 --> 2:06:32.280]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[2:06:32.280 --> 2:06:35.880]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[2:06:35.880 --> 2:06:40.200]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[2:06:40.200 --> 2:06:43.400]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[2:06:43.400 --> 2:06:47.040]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[2:07:02.760 --> 2:07:07.760]  predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in
[2:07:07.760 --> 2:07:11.880]  more than 50 years he says it will change everything about our lives the way

[2:07:18.400 --> 2:07:23.040]  predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right you see he
[2:07:23.040 --> 2:07:26.920]  predicted the collapse of GM panty may Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall
[2:07:26.920 --> 2:07:31.200]  owner general growth properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire
[2:07:31.200 --> 2:07:35.000]  prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for free
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:38.440]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real
[2:07:38.440 --> 2:07:42.560]  eye-opener I can't stress this enough you should at least watch this free video
[2:07:42.560 --> 2:07:46.280]  online today he explains everything you need to know including simple steps you

[2:08:10.040 --> 2:08:27.760]  Jones and the GCN radio network well Alan Watt is one of the most well-read
[2:08:27.760 --> 2:08:32.480]  researchers who has a deep understanding of the globalist master plan of
[2:08:32.480 --> 2:08:36.640]  anybody I've ever talked to because I've done exhaustive ongoing deep research
[2:08:36.640 --> 2:08:41.760]  and Alan's one of the few people that I can actually routinely learn something
[2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:47.200]  from and we always have great banner back and forth as we basically integrate
[2:08:47.200 --> 2:08:50.680]  our information together he's with us for the rest of the hour there's so many
[2:08:50.680 --> 2:08:53.920]  world news issues so many things happening I know we've got callers
[2:08:53.920 --> 2:08:57.360]  holding I will get to you with Alan those that are holding at least if I go
[2:08:57.360 --> 2:09:00.520]  through those calls I'll think I'll give the number out again for other folks to
[2:09:00.520 --> 2:09:08.200]  join us but here's the number 800 25 at 992 31 but we have all of these in you
[2:09:08.200 --> 2:09:12.080]  incredible economic implosions that have been designed I made Obama deception
[2:09:12.080 --> 2:09:16.640]  more than two years ago broke down everything Obama would do and it's as
[2:09:16.640 --> 2:09:21.240]  if it was prophecy it's not we understand the blueprint we understand who these
[2:09:21.240 --> 2:09:26.720]  puppets are fall the Republic part two year and a half ago Alan Watson that
[2:09:26.720 --> 2:09:31.360]  incredible breaks it down even more detail it's really the Obama deception
[2:09:31.360 --> 2:09:34.640]  part two but it's called fall the Republic those are DVDs by the way
[2:09:34.640 --> 2:09:39.560]  available in info wars calm you may know all about this information but your
[2:09:39.560 --> 2:09:43.520]  friends and family don't they're ready to hear the truth more and more of them
[2:09:43.520 --> 2:09:48.840]  are now is the time to give them the truth the fact that my show has gone
[2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:54.600]  from being off and on between 50 and 100 affiliates over the years it moves back
[2:09:54.600 --> 2:09:58.240]  and forth the stations are bought and sold and things to now gaining three
[2:09:58.240 --> 2:10:05.240]  affiliates big large stations in large cities larger media groups not the big
[2:10:05.240 --> 2:10:09.720]  giant clear channel but others below that the next year down are putting me on
[2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:13.280]  the air is because they realize their children have no future I've talked to
[2:10:13.280 --> 2:10:16.040]  some of these program directors I've talked to some of these station owners
[2:10:16.040 --> 2:10:19.960]  and network owners they now know we were right about this they now know the
[2:10:19.960 --> 2:10:23.600]  world government is real I mean here I am on the cover of talkers magazine in
[2:10:23.600 --> 2:10:28.240]  March keynote speaker this year Limbaugh Sean Hannity folks like that are
[2:10:28.240 --> 2:10:32.720]  gonna be there they say fastest growing radio show in the country rewriting the
[2:10:32.720 --> 2:10:39.840]  media paradigm now my point is it's not to brag about my success it's to point
[2:10:39.840 --> 2:10:45.080]  out the truth is starting to really get some purchase and you know purchase when
[2:10:45.080 --> 2:10:48.280]  you're climbing up a mountain we're starting to really get some toeholds
[2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:53.920]  some some some finger holds to be able to really get out of this ditch run I know
[2:10:53.920 --> 2:11:00.520]  the globalist are not invincible but they are impregnable and invincible if
[2:11:00.520 --> 2:11:08.520]  you will not research the facts and face the full horror of these eugenics mad
[2:11:08.520 --> 2:11:13.000]  man and their master plan you are handicapped I am handicapped mentally
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:18.440]  by not facing just how wicked they are now I've covered a lot of news today but
[2:11:18.440 --> 2:11:21.440]  I want to bring up to Alan Watt first and we'll get into some of the more
[2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:26.800]  contemporary news with him press releases by CERN where they admit they
[2:11:26.800 --> 2:11:33.760]  created a quark glue-on plasma a particle of it by the speed of light
[2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:37.660]  accelerating lead together which in their own calculations they admit could
[2:11:37.660 --> 2:11:40.960]  destroy the planet Earth but they still did it and preparing to do thousands more
[2:11:40.960 --> 2:11:51.320]  tests they did create it it it it weighs a centimeter sugar cube size would
[2:11:51.320 --> 2:11:56.640]  weigh 40 billion tons or many times more than the heart of a Sun it's close to
[2:11:56.640 --> 2:12:03.280]  black hole mass level they go on to describe the unique material is 100
[2:12:03.280 --> 2:12:07.840]  thousand times hotter than the Sun and denser than any known object other than
[2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:11.760]  black hole now before they started doing these tests top physicists came out and
[2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:17.960]  said this thing could sink to the center of the earth then start pulling mass in
[2:12:17.960 --> 2:12:22.360]  might grow for a year 20 years they don't know depending on its size and then
[2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:27.400]  suddenly you wouldn't know anything until it went to its next division and it
[2:12:27.400 --> 2:12:32.040]  was its next level of mass and the whole planet would be imploded just like in the
[2:12:32.040 --> 2:12:35.280]  last Star Trek movie that came out a year ago they're throwing this in your
[2:12:35.280 --> 2:12:39.040]  face and while Alan's talking I will show that you know clip of the planet
[2:12:39.040 --> 2:12:42.960]  being imploded behind us they're coming out with open air genetically
[2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:49.240]  engineered species they've got this new super E. Coli that is a super mutation
[2:12:49.240 --> 2:12:56.240]  and highly infectious and toxic and resistant to antibiotics meanwhile we
[2:12:56.240 --> 2:13:02.040]  have now many years in Europe and the US of live viruses being sprayed on the
[2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:06.040]  E. Coli on the rotten meat they feed us so they can still feed it to us top
[2:13:06.040 --> 2:13:10.600]  scientists said it's a live vaccine it will give rise to super mutations of
[2:13:10.600 --> 2:13:16.560]  E. Coli we drink E. Coli feces in the aspartame a chemical weapon if you don't
[2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:20.400]  believe me folks just search manufacturing process aspartame I mean I
[2:13:20.400 --> 2:13:24.840]  could go on for hours of how the globalist are pale male trying to destroy
[2:13:24.840 --> 2:13:29.200]  the creation claiming they're trying to protect it writing countless volumes
[2:13:29.200 --> 2:13:32.920]  about how they believe they're going to merge with machines and become God they
[2:13:32.920 --> 2:13:36.400]  may have all the power issue all the currency but they're power mad like
[2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:41.320]  Caligula and are probably going to destroy the earth Alan what what are we
[2:13:41.320 --> 2:13:47.720]  facing why are they attempting to to one up each other on who could destroy the
[2:13:47.720 --> 2:13:53.920]  planet it's difficult to know Alex if they're really planning to do this
[2:13:53.920 --> 2:13:59.120]  thing our other time was they have this technology to terrify us even more and
[2:13:59.120 --> 2:14:03.200]  just did of the object error because we're an age member of terror creation
[2:14:03.200 --> 2:14:07.960]  and this is part of terror creation as well and no doubt that they have all of
[2:14:07.960 --> 2:14:12.280]  this technology and probably had it for an awful long time never they discuss to
[2:14:12.280 --> 2:14:17.000]  the public by dialing media that they're working on something is generally
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:22.120]  obsolete long ago that they've had it for many many many years so I think part
[2:14:22.120 --> 2:14:27.240]  of it really is to add to the tension and the fearfulness and the science in
[2:14:27.240 --> 2:14:31.000]  general because with most people you understand who don't follow the real
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:36.520]  news they follow the standard news they do believe what they're told and that
[2:14:36.520 --> 2:14:40.320]  fear acts upon them and they turn to government to help them and look after
[2:14:40.320 --> 2:14:44.560]  them like children and that's the intention of fear creation and I don't
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:48.080]  you think this is part of it too they've had this technology I'm sure for many
[2:14:48.080 --> 2:14:56.160]  years well Alan expanding on all of this and looking at what the globalist are
[2:14:56.160 --> 2:15:03.160]  up to clearly they are approving things they are rolling out GMO systems and I've
[2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:05.720]  talked to the top scientists that were involved in developing many of these
[2:15:05.720 --> 2:15:10.880]  systems they admit they don't even know how this stuff's going to mutate or are
[2:15:10.880 --> 2:15:18.320]  you saying that that that that this is a split-off technological civilization that
[2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:24.320]  they're more advanced than we know well like going back to big planners people
[2:15:24.320 --> 2:15:28.480]  who took part in shaping the culture that we've lived through in our lifetime
[2:15:28.480 --> 2:15:33.040]  who lived who was born wrong before us the burden Russell Russian Russell said
[2:15:33.040 --> 2:15:36.960]  the bench to the elite will be almost like a separate species why I think
[2:15:36.960 --> 2:15:40.280]  technically they are because you see they're given access to very high
[2:15:40.280 --> 2:15:44.320]  technologies and science is not the lower type that we're all used to not the
[2:15:44.320 --> 2:15:50.440]  stuff that comes out in popular science and I think the whole ability to defeat
[2:15:50.440 --> 2:15:55.480]  virus and the bacterium in the system is using a different technology all
[2:15:55.480 --> 2:16:00.120]  together there's seven or second penicillin and so on as we are so they're
[2:16:00.120 --> 2:16:03.920]  not a part but they're immune they're immune to most of these dairy diseases
[2:16:03.920 --> 2:16:10.600]  and part of the payoff to give the the lucky politicians the higher politicians
[2:16:10.600 --> 2:16:15.480]  is to get in on inoculations of their family and themselves with the real
[2:16:15.480 --> 2:16:19.360]  stuff the real stuff though one shot probably will stop all back to you and
[2:16:19.360 --> 2:16:22.960]  from taking off in your system instead of going after individual by two you
[2:16:22.960 --> 2:16:26.720]  don't take off they'll kill every deadly type of back to you before it starts to
[2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:30.760]  take off in your body and so they've had this this run off a long time back in
[2:16:30.760 --> 2:16:36.040]  the 80s for instance in the US Canada and the British Commonwealth countries
[2:16:36.040 --> 2:16:42.800]  at the same year I think it was 85-86 the government suddenly just stated that
[2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:47.560]  all politicians and families and the higher bureaucrats of the country would
[2:16:47.560 --> 2:16:53.880]  be given access to full medical treatment and high high technological
[2:16:53.880 --> 2:16:57.760]  military establishments and I thought well why is that when they put the best
[2:16:57.760 --> 2:17:01.640]  hospitals elsewhere for the public and all that and I knew something was up
[2:17:01.640 --> 2:17:08.280]  then and I remember when different outbreaks had Canada the politicians
[2:17:08.280 --> 2:17:12.960]  risen the flesh eating back to him suddenly hits the country and one of
[2:17:12.960 --> 2:17:16.880]  the politicians in the federal government came down with it and transpired
[2:17:16.880 --> 2:17:22.960]  they was given shots in his arm and in his leg sorry and that's where he got
[2:17:22.960 --> 2:17:27.040]  the flesh eating back to you and the same article said his wife and daughter
[2:17:27.040 --> 2:17:31.680]  also had it a minor degree and they both had it in their arm so they were
[2:17:31.680 --> 2:17:35.840]  given shots against this stuff the general public weren't and you always find
[2:17:35.840 --> 2:17:41.040]  one person and maybe 10,000 who'll get out alive a more live back to you by the
[2:17:41.040 --> 2:17:45.960]  way Alan we saw that two years ago when it came out that Merkel and the
[2:17:45.960 --> 2:17:50.000]  government officials were being given a special quote clean vaccine then we
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:55.960]  learned in England in the US they have special medical divisions that serve
[2:17:55.960 --> 2:18:02.160]  them and they're given something else than us so clearly this is going on and
[2:18:02.160 --> 2:18:06.640]  also to remember when we did Diana was on the go doing her parking across the
[2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:12.240]  world our reporter was allowed to follow her for two or three weeks and he saw
[2:18:12.240 --> 2:18:19.040]  her lifestyle and the promise duty was incredible in that class of being and
[2:18:19.040 --> 2:18:23.520]  he asked the one question towards the last week the last few days and he said
[2:18:23.520 --> 2:18:28.840]  aren't any of you worried about getting AIDS or venereal disease and he said
[2:18:28.840 --> 2:18:32.720]  there's a stunned silence no look to each other like he was crazy well and I
[2:18:32.720 --> 2:18:36.000]  figured out it's because they've all got the real shots to stop all of that they
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:41.360]  don't get these things like we do well that's right science and more and more
[2:18:41.360 --> 2:18:45.440]  this is being admitted that there is a breakaway civilization or national
[2:18:45.440 --> 2:18:53.120]  security and now we know that you know it it it wasn't just HD Wells pre-1900
[2:18:53.120 --> 2:18:56.600]  writing about atomic weapons we now know there were books written in the of
[2:18:56.600 --> 2:19:01.520]  1850s about atomic weapons and it it really wasn't just max plank in 1900
[2:19:01.520 --> 2:19:05.320]  that developed the idea and then we see the stealth helicopter with the fake
[2:19:05.320 --> 2:19:09.920]  bin Laden killing crashing they now admit they want the whole military to go
[2:19:09.920 --> 2:19:14.060]  drone and robot so and they'll have robots working on the drones and the
[2:19:14.060 --> 2:19:17.920]  robots where humans won't even be needed that's why they call it the end of
[2:19:17.920 --> 2:19:23.080]  history the end of humanity why the future doesn't need us that's correct
[2:19:23.080 --> 2:19:28.960]  it's all part of that and towards the end all of the writers from Charles
[2:19:28.960 --> 2:19:33.160]  Galton Darwin all the way down to the present time at the United Nations talk
[2:19:33.160 --> 2:19:37.160]  about that they need to rapidly rapidly reduce the population
[2:19:37.160 --> 2:19:41.140]  Rockefeller on his last major role speech with the lucky gene club as they
[2:19:41.140 --> 2:19:45.080]  call it I said the same thing we need to wrap it depopulation so this is the
[2:19:45.080 --> 2:19:49.320]  time now to start bringing it over to the killer of bacterium which will affect
[2:19:49.320 --> 2:19:52.560]  the general population we've already had an outbreak and until you know it's

[2:24:07.360 --> 2:24:15.640]  with him Alan looking at the current economic implosion and what's happening
[2:24:15.640 --> 2:24:19.600]  right now the IMF the World Bank documents are on record we told people
[2:24:19.600 --> 2:24:23.720]  decades ago that they would implode the world economy through derivatives when
[2:24:23.720 --> 2:24:27.920]  they got rid of Glass-Steagall that they would then offer a new global government
[2:24:27.920 --> 2:24:32.720]  as the Bank of the World as the solution we've got more news reports for the
[2:24:32.720 --> 2:24:37.000]  federal government admits that the cap and trade is a carbon tax to shut down
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:41.640]  our industrial operations in fact here it is seeing in this news
[2:24:41.640 --> 2:24:46.920]  Obama's commerce nominee cap and trade good for hiding carbon taxes and they
[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:50.600]  go on to shut down industrial operations see people don't get this the
[2:24:50.600 --> 2:24:54.800]  monopoly men want to shut down industrial operations they want to make us
[2:24:54.800 --> 2:24:59.040]  dependent they want to hurt us into the cities they don't want alternative
[2:24:59.040 --> 2:25:03.760]  energy it's the opposite of that but to control that movement they then try to
[2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:07.520]  finance it with the tax incentives so they can direct it in the way they want
[2:25:07.520 --> 2:25:13.240]  and now debt fears US rating could be placed under review warrants Moody's it
[2:25:13.240 --> 2:25:16.280]  was standard and poorest two months ago that's two of the three rating agencies
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:22.080]  gives lawmakers until mid-July to show progress in talks that means cutting the
[2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:26.280]  benefits raising taxes giving the bankers more or they'll raise the debt
[2:25:26.280 --> 2:25:33.120]  level the economic horror as data plunges jobless this increases so I
[2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:37.360]  thought the economy was great Alan where are they going what do the globalist
[2:25:37.360 --> 2:25:42.800]  want to do well they've said it many times even long ago they said there must
[2:25:42.800 --> 2:25:45.800]  never be another America across the world and the best thing they could do
[2:25:45.800 --> 2:25:50.320]  was dismantle all the industry within America that was all part of this big
[2:25:50.320 --> 2:25:55.240]  plan and this is the phase you're going through now I've said for years that is
[2:25:55.240 --> 2:26:00.200]  America which was the military machine to standardize the world for the big boys
[2:26:00.200 --> 2:26:04.320]  when they were finishing off the last of their jobs they'd pull the rug from
[2:26:04.320 --> 2:26:08.240]  under their feet at home and that's what you're seeing now and you understand
[2:26:08.240 --> 2:26:13.160]  too nothing is debated in front of the public nothing of any import is
[2:26:13.160 --> 2:26:18.440]  debated at all it's done in very high meetings with high level bureaucrats
[2:26:18.440 --> 2:26:21.840]  who across the world signing agreement well we got that from the SPP and other
[2:26:21.840 --> 2:26:25.520]  documents that have been lawsuits have been filed to get them they go into these
[2:26:25.520 --> 2:26:30.200]  North American Union meetings the Fortune 100 is there and they actually tell
[2:26:30.200 --> 2:26:34.240]  the leaders of the different federal departments what they're going to do and
[2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:39.720]  they absolutely click their heels and and follow it yes they call it the guy
[2:26:39.720 --> 2:26:43.520]  shepherds shepherds are the bureaucrats who spend a year traveling across the
[2:26:43.520 --> 2:26:48.360]  world negotiating with other countries bureaucrats and they draft up all this
[2:26:48.360 --> 2:26:52.880]  stuff that signed at these G8 and G20 meetings and they're just going to the
[2:26:52.880 --> 2:26:57.600]  party the G20 meetings and sign their names the documents but when Rothschild
[2:26:57.600 --> 2:27:02.360]  came out in Britain said that his family's private bank in Switzerland
[2:27:02.360 --> 2:27:07.920]  would handle all the carbon trade for the planet and back by Al Gore of course
[2:27:07.920 --> 2:27:11.400]  then when we're speaking announcement like that they're not giving you a
[2:27:11.400 --> 2:27:15.480]  suggestion they're telling you how it's going to be this is a must-be as they
[2:27:15.480 --> 2:27:19.000]  call it it's not going to be debated through any Congress or Parliament this
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:24.120]  is simply done and and that's maybe when we go to some such work and spend the
[2:27:24.120 --> 2:27:28.840]  years setting the whole system up they don't back off and say the public don't
[2:27:28.840 --> 2:27:32.560]  want to we're going to give them public what they want that doesn't happen but
[2:27:32.560 --> 2:27:36.520]  there's no input at all in today's society of anything called democracy I
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:44.280]  mentioned NGO funded by the foundations so Australia as you know there's really
[2:27:44.280 --> 2:27:48.720]  almost a feminist government now Fabian socialist and they're the first ones to
[2:27:48.720 --> 2:27:53.760]  go carbon at neutral as they call it and but half the farmers now can't even
[2:27:53.760 --> 2:27:59.240]  plant on their lands because they're classified as carbon sinks so you
[2:27:59.240 --> 2:28:02.720]  still have to pay for the land no one wants to buy it so you're keeping the
[2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:06.560]  taxes for it and and that's you stuck for life there's no compensation there's
[2:28:06.560 --> 2:28:10.280]  nothing that's just be the way across the whole world except for a few
[2:28:10.280 --> 2:28:14.640]  countries that are favored countries and we know the up-and-coming nations Brazil
[2:28:14.640 --> 2:28:20.560]  each got Brazil India China is still classed by the way is not in coming
[2:28:20.560 --> 2:28:24.200]  country even though it's the manufacturer for the whole planet they've got
[2:28:24.200 --> 2:28:28.520]  tax exemptions they have for all investments by the way 15 years free
[2:28:28.520 --> 2:28:32.440]  tax if you come in to build a factory there what they do is they shut down all
[2:28:32.440 --> 2:28:36.640]  the western zones and then say no taxes basically to go to China or India and
[2:28:36.640 --> 2:28:40.160]  then everything moves there because those countries are already under a tier
[2:28:40.160 --> 2:28:43.600]  any and it's been to lower the standard the rest of the globe it's all on record
[2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:47.240]  and when you mention I have the newscasts out of England and Australia how
[2:28:47.240 --> 2:28:52.160]  good half the farmland is now off limits you can't use it and then they tell the
[2:28:52.160 --> 2:28:55.680]  farmers but you still got to pay the full tax on it but then what they do is
[2:28:55.680 --> 2:28:59.440]  once they go bankrupt the government buys it and then gives it to fortune
[2:28:59.440 --> 2:29:04.160]  500 and then removes the exemptions just like Obama with the health care
[2:29:04.160 --> 2:29:07.880]  giving over 2,000 waivers to his friends where they don't have to buy the
[2:29:07.880 --> 2:29:11.720]  health care but you do and General Electric is exempt from the carbon taxes
[2:29:11.720 --> 2:29:18.240]  it's pure mafia evil just total crime out in the open you can remember two Alex
[2:29:18.240 --> 2:29:23.520]  that were see everything changed in the 70s when the club of Rome and the club of
[2:29:23.520 --> 2:29:27.160]  Rome is a big premier think tank whatever they think about and their big
[2:29:27.160 --> 2:29:31.360]  think tanks becomes the way of the future and everyone listens to them
[2:29:31.360 --> 2:29:35.000]  that's why they're paid to do what to do and you're given the tasks of how to
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:38.680]  con the public and the different guys is global warming was one they were the

[2:29:41.560 --> 2:29:44.960]  all the documents we've covered it in in game it's premeditated evil they

[2:34:29.240 --> 2:34:32.560]  written by him and you read it and it's like you're reading what's happening
[2:34:32.560 --> 2:34:37.560]  today and here's the deal they believe the world belongs to them just like our
[2:34:37.560 --> 2:34:42.680]  ancestors came to America it's standard procedure actually and said well let's
[2:34:42.680 --> 2:34:48.560]  just kill all the natives let's just kill them just take their land it took
[2:34:48.560 --> 2:34:52.280]  about a hundred years to really demonize them at first it didn't work like
[2:34:52.280 --> 2:34:55.920]  that it was just people but then other native groups would come say help us
[2:34:55.920 --> 2:34:59.200]  wipe out this group all the natives were just as bad as the white people it's
[2:34:59.200 --> 2:35:04.440]  humans folks but they you know there's British manuals that that are in the
[2:35:04.440 --> 2:35:09.560]  National Archives for the French Indian War about open the sores have the doctor
[2:35:09.560 --> 2:35:13.840]  or the surgeon two different things open the sores of your men that have the
[2:35:13.840 --> 2:35:19.440]  pustules of the pox spread it liberally upon the blanket make sure that within
[2:35:19.440 --> 2:35:27.200]  one day it works best to deliver it to the Indians biological warfare and so
[2:35:27.200 --> 2:35:30.800]  the globalist I mean look at every culture the Israelites you order go in
[2:35:30.800 --> 2:35:33.800]  kill everybody take the land don't even keep their animals kill their animals
[2:35:33.800 --> 2:35:38.720]  as well every culture the Romans would go in wipe out entire groups this is
[2:35:38.720 --> 2:35:42.600]  standard procedure but they're just getting us ready for that great point
[2:35:42.600 --> 2:35:48.360]  Alan want how close are we until the globalist go ahead and start really
[2:35:48.360 --> 2:35:53.400]  wiping folks out in mass or do they want to first dehumanize this and toy with
[2:35:53.400 --> 2:35:57.920]  us a bit more and I just watch us die of the cancers and the diabetes and the
[2:35:57.920 --> 2:36:01.800]  and the GMO because in most of their documents as you know they talk about
[2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:05.840]  once the real planetary control systems in place they want to go ahead and
[2:36:05.840 --> 2:36:09.960]  devastate a billion and then get everybody scared we'll run to their arms
[2:36:09.960 --> 2:36:14.120]  and keep us safe from the terrorists or keep us safe from the mutations they
[2:36:14.120 --> 2:36:18.360]  will take care of you honey and then and then they killed two billion and now
[2:36:18.360 --> 2:36:21.520]  we're down to six billion and they they wiped out another two billion I mean
[2:36:21.520 --> 2:36:24.880]  they I mean they more and more they're not just saying they want to kill 80% as
[2:36:24.880 --> 2:36:28.080]  the UN documents and you know that's a standard number now they're having
[2:36:28.080 --> 2:36:35.680]  debates about should we kill all humans are humans a parasite disease Alan want
[2:36:35.680 --> 2:36:39.000]  what is their master plan and like five minutes what are they planning to do
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:42.760]  from your research well first is touch on what they've already done and since
[2:36:42.760 --> 2:36:48.080]  the 50s they've given us the cancer vaccines they've given us GMO food but
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:53.480]  the pesticides from large industrial waste put on as a paralyzer since World
[2:36:53.480 --> 2:36:58.440]  War two cancer is going to kill everybody that's alive today so they have
[2:36:58.440 --> 2:37:03.240]  been killing us off and quite a good hop actually quite a good clip since the
[2:37:03.240 --> 2:37:07.520]  50s and it's not enough it's not fast enough now a bit abortion of course is
[2:37:07.520 --> 2:37:11.840]  ratcheted up to I noticed even in today's paper to say that the census in the
[2:37:11.840 --> 2:37:17.000]  U.S. says that the far fewer a burst now and America never had before and I'll
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:21.760]  get worse as economy goes down the hill so that's right the entire West is dying
[2:37:21.760 --> 2:37:27.840]  replacement rate of 1.3 if every two adults 1.3 and according to be impossible
[2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:30.720]  how to pay for the baby boomers that was designed that way so they're going to
[2:37:30.720 --> 2:37:36.040]  have to be killed yes and what they've also said and Britain and the Canada
[2:37:36.040 --> 2:37:40.600]  and the U.S. at the same time by the way because it is Harper did the same thing
[2:37:40.600 --> 2:37:44.640]  in Canada they try to bring more young foreigners into a place the people who
[2:37:44.640 --> 2:37:49.640]  are dying off healthy young people who can again pay off the national debt
[2:37:49.640 --> 2:37:53.360]  that's the excuse for it but so that they accomplish a whole bunch of things
[2:37:53.360 --> 2:37:57.000]  they deculturalize the people but by bringing the most diverse cultures on
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:38:00.880]  mass large groups who will not assimilate and then you make them the cops in the
[2:38:00.880 --> 2:38:04.800]  CPS workers I've had members of British Parliament on most of the CPS there
[2:38:04.800 --> 2:38:08.480]  Eastern Europeans who came from Soviet terror and then they can't speak English
[2:38:08.480 --> 2:38:11.960]  and they take your kid in Billy Club you I mean it's just seed forces of
[2:38:11.960 --> 2:38:17.280]  foreigners yes yes and it's on it and Tony Blair's the assistant by Prime
[2:38:17.280 --> 2:38:21.600]  Minister Tony Blair came out and said that their orders were to again open the
[2:38:21.600 --> 2:38:27.480]  floodgates to immigration again for most diverse cultures to eradicate the last
[2:38:27.480 --> 2:38:32.000]  messages of British culture it must be gone forever so totally destroy the
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:35.240]  culture the people who come in have no loyalty to the country yet they don't
[2:38:35.240 --> 2:38:38.920]  know what democracy or republicanism means don't care to know they're being
[2:38:38.920 --> 2:38:44.320]  well paid for taking over but it's not fast enough a kill the next part is the
[2:38:44.320 --> 2:38:49.720]  rapid de-organization into the major cities that all their major books have
[2:38:49.720 --> 2:38:52.680]  said this would be the final part and then once in there they'll have your
[2:38:52.680 --> 2:38:56.760]  extreme rationing for food the UN has said that too by the way when they set
[2:38:56.760 --> 2:39:00.680]  up the UN's Department of Food is a weapon Henry Kissinger's memorandum
[2:39:00.680 --> 2:39:06.800]  200 then the 96 UN food meeting Beijing we will use it as a weapon we're going
[2:39:06.800 --> 2:39:10.760]  to kill you post industrial we are murderers but we're liberal so it's
[2:39:10.760 --> 2:39:14.720]  cute and funny that's right and then of course once you crammed together and
[2:39:14.720 --> 2:39:18.160]  you're in a poor diet they're wide open to all infections and then they will
[2:39:18.160 --> 2:39:22.200]  release the proper infections in the right places at the right time and
[2:39:22.200 --> 2:39:26.840]  again they'll be made to sound quite natural oh it's just business that by
[2:39:26.840 --> 2:39:31.700]  the media they're already pre-programming you call predictive programming all these
[2:39:31.700 --> 2:39:37.240]  shows on history discovery books in caps at grocery stores the world after man
[2:39:37.240 --> 2:39:42.000]  the end of humanity earth is going to throw us off superplagues are coming
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:45.680]  because we're overpopulated then you have all the documents they're creating
[2:39:45.680 --> 2:39:50.560]  it I mean it's now been released that the we dive the mainline document here
[2:39:50.560 --> 2:39:57.800]  that openly the USDA is funding corn that sterilizes you rice that sterilizes
[2:39:57.800 --> 2:40:01.480]  you but then and I've got all the links up on infowars.com and then
[2:40:01.480 --> 2:40:06.640]  meanwhile the ones they've already made do this they're already doing it they've
[2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:11.240]  been sterilizing us gradually from 1950 onwards by the polio vaccine and others
[2:40:11.240 --> 2:40:15.360]  as well and as you say I mean Rockefeller's Golden Rice project
[2:40:15.360 --> 2:40:18.800]  for the third world countries that's that's the state effect of it is
[2:40:18.800 --> 2:40:22.360]  sterilizes the men and they've known that for years and they promote that
[2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:25.920]  through the United Nations so we're really getting hit hard with it so they
[2:40:25.920 --> 2:40:29.240]  don't want us to live very long and they've got the timetables too they want
[2:40:29.240 --> 2:40:35.360]  us to be faster reduced by the year 2030 and in between 30 and 50 they'll bring
[2:40:35.360 --> 2:40:40.040]  in their new super city states across the world the end of nations just a few
[2:40:40.040 --> 2:40:44.640]  very high-tech super cities where those who are deemed worthy to come through
[2:40:44.640 --> 2:40:49.400]  will live who will be very valuable to their system or the city-state
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:54.200]  scientifically technocrats that kind of thing they don't need the old type of
[2:40:54.200 --> 2:40:59.280]  manual labor the stem is killed workers and they don't need you just hit on
[2:40:59.280 --> 2:41:02.280]  something key and I want to expand on that if you actually read their
[2:41:02.280 --> 2:41:05.960]  documents as you've done but for folks that want to go look into this they
[2:41:05.960 --> 2:41:10.640]  have 10 regions but they destroy the nation-state they want it all week with
[2:41:10.640 --> 2:41:15.880]  just global corporate rules with then heavily armed city-states with their
[2:41:15.880 --> 2:41:21.040]  own private mercenary military so they're actually going back to the feudal
[2:41:21.040 --> 2:41:26.280]  system it's not really one big loving globe it city-states together waging
[2:41:26.280 --> 2:41:33.000]  war against the barbarian populations as they see us basically it's the elite
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:37.560]  telling us through the Sean Connery film Zardos that's right Zardos was a
[2:41:37.560 --> 2:41:42.120]  great wake-up and most folk missed what it meant but it was the whole eugenics
[2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:46.440]  plan right there and again a superlito would come through to live in a big
[2:41:46.440 --> 2:41:53.000]  shielded bubble type city force fields live forever because David Suzuki in
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:57.960]  Canada said a few years ago go on cbc television all this maggots yeah he said
[2:41:57.960 --> 2:42:02.520]  now we can make a person that for 500 years if we so wish and he's a geneticist
[2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:07.360]  as well as a human hater they've already found all the gene triggers they're not
[2:42:07.360 --> 2:42:11.920]  giving it to us they could give us extended life we could have off off
[2:42:11.920 --> 2:42:15.320]  world colonies but we don't get any of that we get to be exterminated like
[2:42:15.320 --> 2:42:19.000]  cockroaches and these people get to go on to the stars and the yuppies love it
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:24.080]  yes and also I mean I've read the articles and and the books by the people
[2:42:24.080 --> 2:42:27.960]  people like Charles Galton Darwin and then they truly believe in Darwinism
[2:42:27.960 --> 2:42:31.240]  they believe and they get those give you the same analogies of that the
[2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:36.400]  bacteria working on the soil incomes are fungus after that and dies away
[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:41.040]  preparing the soil for the acorn to grow what they're saying is you see we the
[2:42:41.040 --> 2:42:44.880]  working-type people average people in the middle classes are all preparing the
[2:42:44.880 --> 2:42:49.320]  soil for them for the old tree to go on where the cocoon and that's what all
[2:42:49.320 --> 2:42:54.960]  their writers and in culture makers like Arthur C. Clarke tell us on the mission
[2:42:54.960 --> 2:42:59.000]  we're gonna have to decide who's purified and yes the elites gonna have to
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:03.320]  fight the computer their own creation as well to decide who was reborn into the
[2:43:03.320 --> 2:43:09.320]  Luciferian Superman yes and also to the quite they've been testing clones for
[2:43:09.320 --> 2:43:15.440]  many many years and secret bases and islands to of course offshore and they
[2:43:15.440 --> 2:43:20.100]  can literally create the new types of slaves exactly like Huxley said in
[2:43:20.100 --> 2:43:24.000]  Brave New World and so there's no problem about that way that's it man
[2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:28.120]  Washington Post seven years ago had a little footnote about Argentina with
[2:43:28.120 --> 2:43:31.680]  part human part chimpanzees in US government lab but you're not allowed
[2:43:31.680 --> 2:43:36.160]  to see I'm sorry go ahead yeah so they're all set to do that so all our
[2:43:36.160 --> 2:43:40.520]  only function right now is to pay taxes provide the troops for finishing off the
[2:43:40.520 --> 2:43:44.960]  countries that won't go under and join the system and that's it our job is
[2:43:44.960 --> 2:43:48.640]  literally done the particular way the industry they don't need us anymore and
[2:43:48.640 --> 2:43:52.400]  they're already again as you well know that they're putting in the rewelding
[2:43:52.400 --> 2:43:57.800]  projects they're putting in Pumas into Florida and stuff like that and they
[2:43:57.800 --> 2:44:02.760]  write books I mean take Bill Joy co-owner of Sun Microsystems he writes in
[2:44:02.760 --> 2:44:07.200]  99 April issue-wired magazine he said I went to him in a meeting 200 computer
[2:44:07.200 --> 2:44:11.760]  company owners and we talked about do we kill everybody and he wrote an article
[2:44:11.760 --> 2:44:14.920]  saying we're discussing if we're gonna entertain you and let you hurt the earth
[2:44:14.920 --> 2:44:19.200]  or we're gonna kill you and the decision is kill you and and the yuppies are
[2:44:19.200 --> 2:44:22.880]  like oh that's good you know what I like I like how the yuppies all say yeah
[2:44:22.880 --> 2:44:26.680]  well there are too many people like they're part of the elite Alan like
[2:44:26.680 --> 2:44:30.920]  like they're not being targeted watch so many science fiction movies down through
[2:44:30.920 --> 2:44:34.400]  the lifetime that they really do believe yeah I know all this stuff therefore I
[2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:38.960]  I'm somehow in in the right club but not knowing about it doesn't mean you're in
[2:44:38.960 --> 2:44:43.280]  the right club at all these guys know who they want depicted the selected the
[2:44:43.280 --> 2:44:47.200]  families many years ago will come through this and they don't need the
[2:44:47.200 --> 2:44:53.680]  rest of us at all they're expandable completely expandable yeah and you know
[2:44:53.680 --> 2:44:58.280]  my dad was approached because he was top of his class by UT when he was a
[2:44:58.280 --> 2:45:02.400]  junior in high school they took 160 of them in there and then they took a few
[2:45:02.400 --> 2:45:07.160]  of the smartest I think he said six of them aside and openly said we're setting
[2:45:07.160 --> 2:45:11.160]  up world government eugenics is good Hitler had the wrong idea he only went
[2:45:11.160 --> 2:45:15.560]  after certain groups were going after everybody and my dad was creeped out by
[2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:20.720]  it and and you know got out of the program but but that that goes on at
[2:45:20.720 --> 2:45:25.280]  every university and they just go around picking through the people they want to
[2:45:25.280 --> 2:45:31.080]  be their minions and all the rest of us are scheduled to be killed yes and again
[2:45:31.080 --> 2:45:35.240]  veteran Russell did a very good article on that he said that this is weak we get
[2:45:35.240 --> 2:45:38.080]  scholarships to the brighter ones who bring him into the Ivy League
[2:45:38.080 --> 2:45:43.280]  universities and if they fulfill certain conditions like getting up their
[2:45:43.280 --> 2:45:47.520]  family forgetting their family forgetting their past and joining the club
[2:45:47.520 --> 2:45:51.560]  then that would be very useful he said if they will not give up their families
[2:45:51.560 --> 2:45:57.680]  if they still want to get attached to the lower class they came from then we
[2:45:57.680 --> 2:46:01.200]  must get rid of them and he said those who are very intelligent and who will
[2:46:01.200 --> 2:46:06.560]  not join us are a problem therefore they must be eradicated or eliminated yeah
[2:46:06.560 --> 2:46:10.880]  and that's why the police openly are taught the founding fathers are bad
[2:46:10.880 --> 2:46:15.240]  liberty is bad and they won't hire police with over a hundred IQ that's now
[2:46:15.240 --> 2:46:20.240]  confirmed that anyone today Alex anyone who has an ability to communicate
[2:46:20.240 --> 2:46:24.680]  what is happening to the public we're done on every single list for first
[2:46:24.680 --> 2:46:28.040]  collection when it comes along we're all done on on the list that they all have
[2:46:28.040 --> 2:46:33.640]  them all countries have them and through compartmentalization they take the
[2:46:33.640 --> 2:46:39.160]  funny thing is we're trying to save the dumbed-down British people and and but
[2:46:39.160 --> 2:46:43.680]  they are the attack dogs of the people that are soft killing them and they
[2:46:43.680 --> 2:46:50.400]  love it most people will never believe that other human beings cold-bloodedly
[2:46:50.400 --> 2:46:56.200]  sit down at tables and draft up plans on how to kill them they cannot believe
[2:46:56.200 --> 2:47:00.480]  that they think that's something from the past some ancient past somewhere they
[2:47:00.480 --> 2:47:05.760]  think that Hitler or Stalin wasn't were aberrants they don't realize no that
[2:47:05.760 --> 2:47:09.880]  that the real aberrants are picked up on every generation to work in the big
[2:47:09.880 --> 2:47:15.320]  tanks and for government to work on these very proper their program their
[2:47:15.320 --> 2:47:19.800]  problems and they're just like farmers they look at the farm and if the
[2:47:19.800 --> 2:47:23.880]  cattle aren't producing they don't keep you keep feeding them like pets you
[2:47:23.880 --> 2:47:27.960]  kill them you kill them off and and literally that's how they describe the
[2:47:27.960 --> 2:47:32.280]  public they're the farmers we're the cattle and we're not producing there's
[2:47:32.280 --> 2:47:36.760]  no more purpose for this is their philosophy thousands of books statements
[2:47:36.760 --> 2:47:41.040]  all admitted all out in the open Rockefeller Foundation about how they're
[2:47:41.040 --> 2:47:47.360]  gonna sterilize us 1966 all being done all happening but the average cop
[2:47:47.360 --> 2:47:52.720]  listening says I don't care I decide to not believe this I like my petty power
[2:47:52.720 --> 2:47:58.440]  Alex Jones is bad Alan Watt is bad he's saying my government isn't good and and
[2:47:58.440 --> 2:48:02.200]  for that petty power they will sell themselves and their whole family right
[2:48:02.200 --> 2:48:06.880]  into death but then they're not the bad guys compared to the yuppies and you
[2:48:06.880 --> 2:48:10.800]  also have a generation who've been purposely bred I mean I mean bred and
[2:48:10.800 --> 2:48:16.240]  raised on video games kill kill kill who wins guys with the black uniforms I
[2:48:16.240 --> 2:48:20.440]  want power I don't want to be in a losing side and that's that's a generation
[2:48:20.440 --> 2:48:23.880]  that's grown up now who wear the uniforms and they're perfect for this
[2:48:23.880 --> 2:48:28.680]  perfect this time in history they're bred and created for this time in
[2:48:28.680 --> 2:48:32.640]  history and when their job is over and there's nobody to beat up and put in
[2:48:32.640 --> 2:48:36.120]  prison then they're disposed of too well that's why in all the really
[2:48:36.120 --> 2:48:41.280]  internal Pentagon documents and FBI documents it's the it's the veterans
[2:48:41.280 --> 2:48:46.080]  that they hate the most because oh that's a that's a killing machine that
[2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:50.520]  we statistically noticed after 30 tends to wake up to what happened as they
[2:48:50.520 --> 2:48:54.840]  become more mature we've got it we've got a focus on them we've got to bring
[2:48:54.840 --> 2:48:58.720]  them into our VA's we got to shoot them up that's why they all use delay kill
[2:48:58.720 --> 2:49:03.000]  weapons on them like do you and things that are perfect to kill you 10 20 years
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:06.960]  after you get out it's all been actuaried it's all been figured out
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:13.040]  perfectly yeah after the Vietnam War the the D. U. S. did put up some drafts
[2:49:13.040 --> 2:49:16.560]  about that thing or they're afraid that these guys know that they're
[2:49:16.560 --> 2:49:22.080]  perfectly trained and arms and warfare they might turn on the government so
[2:49:22.080 --> 2:49:26.240]  you've noticed since but 1980 onwards is touched experiment with these drugs on
[2:49:26.240 --> 2:49:30.600]  all the troops across all the countries by the way for NATO and give them
[2:49:30.600 --> 2:49:35.200]  drugs which makes them hallucinate their flashbacks they they go berserk when
[2:49:35.200 --> 2:49:39.120]  they come back home and give them pills they give them pills where they quote
[2:49:39.120 --> 2:49:45.480]  don't remember the bad memories and please continue yes and lots of them
[2:49:45.480 --> 2:49:49.680]  are physically erect by the injections they get they become crippled with all
[2:49:49.680 --> 2:49:55.880]  kinds of really old-age diseases they come down quickly with with osteoarthritis
[2:49:55.880 --> 2:50:00.280]  and things like this but as long as the globalist run TV ads with jingoistic
[2:50:00.280 --> 2:50:04.200]  how much we love the troops and if they're on the airplane the pilot says
[2:50:04.200 --> 2:50:07.880]  thank the troops that are on board not let's not steal their pension funds
[2:50:07.880 --> 2:50:11.840]  let's not inject them with cancer viruses it's as long as we tell them we
[2:50:11.840 --> 2:50:17.680]  care about them yeah again it's its perception is reality it's everything's
[2:50:17.680 --> 2:50:23.280]  run like a big a big assembly line really and I'll have to get out the troops
[2:50:23.280 --> 2:50:27.440]  it's maybe two to four years that's all they need them for and it's always a
[2:50:27.440 --> 2:50:31.360]  fresh bunch of unemployed to take their place and it's not an ongoing thing
[2:50:31.360 --> 2:50:36.840]  because really we're self-sustaining basically and they want insecure poor
[2:50:36.840 --> 2:50:41.600]  people who feel like they were nothing they take them sleep deprivize shave
[2:50:41.600 --> 2:50:45.040]  their heads classic cult brainwashing and they tell them you're now built back
[2:50:45.040 --> 2:50:49.520]  up you now serve the system you live forever but really the system sees them
[2:50:49.520 --> 2:50:54.600]  as a worthless animal as Henry Kissinger told them are you animals do you have the
[2:50:54.600 --> 2:50:58.000]  will to look at the enemy program and understand who they are and join the

[2:54:12.680 --> 2:54:16.160]  and forth with Alan White because it really illustrates how serious all this
[2:54:16.160 --> 2:54:21.720]  is we're on five minutes and overdrive the next hour it's very frustrating and
[2:54:21.720 --> 2:54:25.720]  and painful though to study this all the time to know how real it is to read the
[2:54:25.720 --> 2:54:29.640]  books they write about how we're scum and they're gonna win and it's a total
[2:54:29.640 --> 2:54:33.600]  revolution they've taken their time that you know it is they're so dedicated
[2:54:33.600 --> 2:54:39.760]  they're so hateful towards humanity they hate each other as well and it's
[2:54:39.760 --> 2:54:45.240]  because the gullibility of good people has allowed this to happen and now it's
[2:54:45.240 --> 2:54:48.480]  all coming to a head but a lot of positive things are happening in the
[2:54:48.480 --> 2:54:54.680]  awakening as well Alan in all the news you've been seeing lately what strikes
[2:54:54.680 --> 2:55:00.280]  you as a most important you know in the current diversions that are going on the
[2:55:00.280 --> 2:55:04.320]  attempt to start war with Pakistan and China or where do you see all this going
[2:55:04.320 --> 2:55:08.800]  they're already at war with Pakistan that they've been giving them polio
[2:55:08.800 --> 2:55:12.920]  vaccines now they're giving the Pakistanis polio that's out in today's news
[2:55:12.920 --> 2:55:17.320]  and through the World Health Organization which is used as warfare
[2:55:17.320 --> 2:55:20.440]  purposes to that's what the UN is in fact everywhere they go they inject them
[2:55:20.440 --> 2:55:24.120]  with live weaponized that kill them it's freedom yeah and also and at least the
[2:55:24.120 --> 2:55:28.160]  Pakistanis are waking up what I see now though is that to the big banks who own
[2:55:28.160 --> 2:55:32.440]  all the big multi-cop or multinational corporations that are going to not only
[2:55:32.440 --> 2:55:36.640]  into big bombs and so on and drones also going into all your surveillance they
[2:55:36.640 --> 2:55:40.600]  own all your surveillance systems they're now giving over but he's not a
[2:55:40.600 --> 2:55:49.320]  vehicle here but from the Scotland Herald newspaper they're privatizing the
[2:55:49.320 --> 2:55:55.200]  British military's nuclear arms industry that all the bases with nuclear
[2:55:55.200 --> 2:55:59.960]  armaments have been given over to Lockheed Martin a private company so this
[2:55:59.960 --> 2:56:05.280]  is the start now of the takeover of the same big bunch the private consortiums
[2:56:05.280 --> 2:56:10.160]  taking over literally all of your armaments and running the bases they're
[2:56:10.160 --> 2:56:14.840]  the bosses over the middle over the the governmental military that's happened
[2:56:14.840 --> 2:56:18.600]  already so that's been agreed in Britain to give it over lock the lock
[2:56:18.600 --> 2:56:22.640]  stock and barrel nuclear submarines all the trident missiles everything to
[2:56:22.640 --> 2:56:27.000]  Lockheed Martin to run all these bases so we're seeing we're seeing it going
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:32.440]  exactly the same way as quickly said a new feudal system and the CEOs of the
[2:56:32.440 --> 2:56:37.280]  corporations are the new feudal overlords you know by the way I've got the
[2:56:37.280 --> 2:56:42.000]  natural news report they've got links to UNICEF admitting it 78% of Pakistani
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:46.200]  children with polio were given polio vaccines and we saw that the last well
[2:56:46.200 --> 2:56:51.560]  really 50 years in a row but every year it's little AP CBS news articles we put
[2:56:51.560 --> 2:56:55.520]  them up last year oh the UN accidentally gave weaponized polio
[2:56:55.520 --> 2:57:02.680]  earlier by shot to kids in Brazil kids in South Africa kids in Pakistan it's an
[2:57:02.680 --> 2:57:08.800]  accident once they gave them in Nigeria the World Health Organization was the
[2:57:08.800 --> 2:57:15.120]  oral vaccine and as a live vaccine about polio and ended up giving them a new
[2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:18.000]  strain of polio to which there's no treatment at all
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:22.200]  oh they're being killed off and that's again with Kissinger said he said and
[2:57:22.200 --> 2:57:25.480]  they do it out in the open and they get caught over and over again but but
[2:57:25.480 --> 2:57:28.480]  somebody kidnaps one kid the police are on the news everybody's freaking out
[2:57:28.480 --> 2:57:31.920]  Fox News the government cares about you this one child meanwhile they're
[2:57:31.920 --> 2:57:35.640]  murdering people in mass giant child kidnapping rings telling whoever they
[2:57:35.640 --> 2:57:39.800]  want the spiking over a hundred million Americans the CDC admits died from
[2:57:39.800 --> 2:57:46.840]  cancers viruses a SV 40 in the flu in the polio I mean it's all admitted these
[2:57:46.840 --> 2:57:51.840]  but people won't wake up to the murdering going on believe it they
[2:57:51.840 --> 2:57:56.240]  cannot believe because they watch TV in their comedy shows the familiar faces
[2:57:56.240 --> 2:58:01.840]  and their favorite newscasters they can't believe that the human beings are
[2:58:01.840 --> 2:58:06.520]  there are they cannot believe there are human beings completely different from
[2:58:06.520 --> 2:58:11.560]  themselves who run the world they cannot believe it that monsters could do
[2:58:11.560 --> 2:58:14.960]  this therefore they don't want to believe it and they choose not to yeah
[2:58:14.960 --> 2:58:19.680]  well there you go I was even unaware of the latest Pakistan round for what four
[2:58:19.680 --> 2:58:23.520]  or five years they've been there injecting them with live polio and then
[2:58:23.520 --> 2:58:28.680]  Pakistan's government's paid off they let the UN end to continue it and and the
[2:58:28.680 --> 2:58:33.520]  UN's been caught injecting kids with HIV they've been caught I mean but again
[2:58:33.520 --> 2:58:39.160]  they're the UN miss America likes them so it's okay I mean come on paralyzing
[2:58:39.160 --> 2:58:46.680]  and killing kids is loving come on back in one minute still going live
[2:58:46.680 --> 2:58:53.000]  visit GCN come on murdering the children is friendly this is Alex Jones with five
[2:58:53.000 --> 2:58:57.280]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[2:58:57.280 --> 2:59:01.040]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[2:59:01.040 --> 2:59:05.400]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[2:59:05.400 --> 2:59:09.800]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[2:59:09.800 --> 2:59:14.240]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[2:59:14.240 --> 2:59:19.000]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[2:59:19.000 --> 2:59:22.800]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[2:59:22.800 --> 2:59:26.440]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[2:59:26.440 --> 2:59:30.760]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[2:59:30.760 --> 2:59:33.920]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[2:59:33.920 --> 2:59:37.600]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[2:59:37.600 --> 2:59:43.160]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[2:59:43.160 --> 2:59:47.720]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or
[2:59:47.720 --> 2:59:57.240]  call 1-877-327-0365 coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the
[2:59:57.240 --> 3:00:02.200]  Alex Jones Broadcasting Network network
[3:00:04.720 --> 3:00:09.760]  final five minutes we got to have Alan Watt back for a full hour maybe the
[3:00:09.760 --> 3:00:14.440]  longer very soon because I just he's so spot on with his analysis cut into the
[3:00:14.440 --> 3:00:22.200]  matrix.com is his powerful website a lot of great audios up there his books DVDs
[3:00:22.200 --> 3:00:29.440]  it's all absolutely vital but just a short example here with my first born
[3:00:29.440 --> 3:00:36.400]  eight years ago we we searched you know and googled mainline pediatricians that
[3:00:36.400 --> 3:00:40.880]  won't push vaccines on you and we found one of the biggest ones in Westlake and
[3:00:40.880 --> 3:00:44.560]  I went there and the guy had a couple doctors under him he's since retired and
[3:00:44.560 --> 3:00:47.560]  after my second child was born I've known him a few years you know taking him
[3:00:47.560 --> 3:00:51.200]  into the doctor for the early checkup and not taking shots he goes listen Alex
[3:00:51.200 --> 3:00:55.040]  I don't tell anybody I told you this don't use my name but you know doctors
[3:00:55.040 --> 3:00:59.320]  are supposed to volunteer once a year and I do that for city clinics we're
[3:00:59.320 --> 3:01:05.600]  giving the 1970s oral polio vaccine that's illegal to give in the US but we
[3:01:05.600 --> 3:01:12.280]  were ordered to do it to the minority kids that has the live SV 40 well I mean
[3:01:12.280 --> 3:01:16.600]  that's ongoing and in fact it isn't the old vaccine they make new it's it's done
[3:01:16.600 --> 3:01:21.120]  on purpose and as you know Alan it embeds itself in this in the in the cell
[3:01:21.120 --> 3:01:25.960]  walls it triggers when hormones drop generally about 55 so it's you're done
[3:01:25.960 --> 3:01:29.720]  working now here's your cancer and even if it doesn't kill you you spend all your
[3:01:29.720 --> 3:01:33.400]  savings to them and we know the Rockefellers 80 years ago pioneered
[3:01:33.400 --> 3:01:37.440]  cancer research but but the issue here is here's all the you know mainstream
[3:01:37.440 --> 3:01:45.880]  admissions that that that and this natural news article they have nine
[3:01:45.880 --> 3:01:49.760]  different links to mainstream news admitting that the UN is giving the
[3:01:49.760 --> 3:01:56.800]  kids polio I mean these are murdering eugenics killers on purpose and how do
[3:01:56.800 --> 3:02:03.040]  you warn the public about this difficult because it's such a massive campaign
[3:02:03.040 --> 3:02:08.400]  on television all the time even through fiction as well and dramas and movies
[3:02:08.400 --> 3:02:12.200]  of how wonderful doctors and hospitals are that's are impressed same as the
[3:02:12.200 --> 3:02:17.040]  cops and detectives and so on it's all propaganda so it's very hard to get
[3:02:17.040 --> 3:02:21.960]  through to them they don't want again they cannot believe and that's
[3:02:21.960 --> 3:02:26.600]  domesticated public they're domesticated they believe what they're told because
[3:02:26.600 --> 3:02:30.320]  they believe that they're superior intelligent beings living above them who
[3:02:30.320 --> 3:02:34.440]  take care of all the big problems that's what socialism really is and they've
[3:02:34.440 --> 3:02:38.720]  all been socialized into this system so they cannot believe that experts would
[3:02:38.720 --> 3:02:42.800]  ever do anything deliberately to harm them and so they'll eat anything that
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:45.720]  comes on the shelves any kind of candidate they never read it or they
[3:02:45.720 --> 3:02:49.040]  never give us that ever harm does it's the same with the cell phones too they've
[3:02:49.040 --> 3:02:53.480]  never give that to us the harm does and and that's how domesticated the public
[3:02:53.480 --> 3:02:56.920]  generally are they can't think for themselves and now they're telling us oh
[3:02:56.920 --> 3:03:00.720]  we knew 30 years ago it increased all these rare brain tumors that are now
[3:03:00.720 --> 3:03:04.600]  common and we're now putting all this wireless microwave in everywhere and
[3:03:04.600 --> 3:03:11.680]  it's gonna kill you but we told you so yeah and and and you have to think for
[3:03:11.680 --> 3:03:15.280]  yourself you have to be an individual if you cannot be an individual then what
[3:03:15.280 --> 3:03:18.960]  and what are you you're part of the common haired and the common haired
[3:03:18.960 --> 3:03:23.320]  are domesticated and socialized here's my final question Alan we got to have you
[3:03:23.320 --> 3:03:28.360]  back soon why do these social engineers have a universal rule that they've got
[3:03:28.360 --> 3:03:31.960]  to tell you what they're gonna do to you before they do it because it's
[3:03:31.960 --> 3:03:37.800]  legality everything that they admit to you is a legality is your choice where
[3:03:37.800 --> 3:03:42.200]  you would take their heed the warning or not and literally they want you to
[3:03:42.200 --> 3:03:47.560]  consent to your own death or destruction or or injury whatever it may be they
[3:03:47.560 --> 3:03:52.120]  want you consent to consent is a legality in the law even silence is
[3:03:52.120 --> 3:03:57.840]  consent and by law so they're telling you and if you're one of the wise ones
[3:03:57.840 --> 3:04:02.680]  you'll take the heat take the hint and do the right thing and not take this or
[3:04:02.680 --> 3:04:07.840]  that or the other so that's how they like it to be they don't like future
[3:04:07.840 --> 3:04:12.800]  historians to say we force people to do this they like to write it the way people
[3:04:12.800 --> 3:04:16.880]  were warned but they decided to and this is what happened to them millions died
[3:04:16.880 --> 3:04:21.400]  or millions every culture has the same parable to describe reality through
[3:04:21.400 --> 3:04:26.600]  fiction that the vampire whether it was the Latin Americans or the Greeks of the
[3:04:26.600 --> 3:04:31.840]  Japanese with the vampire that the vampire has to tell you he's coming and
[3:04:31.840 --> 3:04:37.120]  has to trick you to give him entrance into your home yeah everything is
[3:04:37.120 --> 3:04:44.480]  contractual really and you you sign a contract or or by silent agreement so
[3:04:44.480 --> 3:04:49.080]  that you that's the same as signing a contract to go Alan Walton voting as a
[3:04:49.080 --> 3:04:53.520]  contract to low tyrants to do whatever they want with you cutting through the
