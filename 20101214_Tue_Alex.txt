[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:12.000 --> 00:19.560]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.560 --> 00:32.520]  Texas Alex Jones we're live my friends it is Tuesday the 14th day of December 2010
[00:32.520 --> 00:37.880]  we're gonna be live here for the next three hours we may even go into overdrive
[00:37.880 --> 00:43.560]  joining us via video skype so that'll be simulcast at prisonplanet.tv not just
[00:43.560 --> 00:48.720]  on the radio Gerald Salente will be joining us to break down all the things
[00:48.720 --> 00:54.160]  that are happening geopolitically and of course with the economy the tax cuts
[00:54.160 --> 00:58.280]  the announcements that Wall Street's made the biggest profits in history two
[00:58.280 --> 01:02.200]  years in a row on the backs of the American people Gerald Salente's
[01:02.200 --> 01:06.960]  predictions on what is going to implode next and Porter Stansbury right up
[01:06.960 --> 01:10.120]  there with the same caliber as somebody like Gerald Salente with his predictions
[01:10.120 --> 01:16.040]  and research Barron's you know called his predictions dire prophecies meaning
[01:16.040 --> 01:21.360]  they have come true and he says that the implosion of 2008 he predicted
[01:21.360 --> 01:25.680]  several years before with precision naming the companies is going to be
[01:25.680 --> 01:31.040]  dwarfed in 2011 I hope they're wrong but the policies that are in place by the
[01:31.040 --> 01:35.360]  globalist are designed to do that so Porter Stansbury will be joining us in
[01:35.360 --> 01:41.080]  the third hour we may even go into overdrive today with him into the fourth
[01:41.080 --> 01:48.760]  hour obviously Richard C. Holbrook has died of a order rupture they tried to
[01:48.760 --> 01:54.040]  fix it in surgery but he died after that and his dying words is reported by the
[01:54.040 --> 01:58.360]  Washington Post and Associated Press and it's an article by Curt Nemo on deathbed
[01:58.360 --> 02:04.240]  globalist Holbrook called for end of Afghan war you've got to stop this war
[02:04.240 --> 02:08.840]  in Afghanistan he told his Pakistani surgeon before he was sedated for his
[02:08.840 --> 02:14.440]  final surgery according to the Washington Post I confronted Holbrook
[02:14.440 --> 02:19.920]  several times but one time he I had just bullhorned the globalist and announced
[02:19.920 --> 02:25.440]  that they should repent of their evil and minutes later he was seen 200 yards
[02:25.440 --> 02:29.000]  away looking at me and by the time we got cameras on he was walking right up to
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.120]  us and like a dog I began barking Holbrook Holbrook we're not your slaves and
[02:34.120 --> 02:37.160]  he went back whatever and turned around and walked away it would have been
[02:37.160 --> 02:41.200]  history a Bilderberg group member coming out to address people but I'm not
[02:41.200 --> 02:45.680]  perfect folks I mean I'm a little bit overdreven as people know and but he was
[02:45.680 --> 02:50.600]  coming right out with another ambassador to us either he was coming to address
[02:50.600 --> 02:53.760]  us or he thought we were idiots and wouldn't know who they were walking off
[02:53.760 --> 02:58.280]  the property but the way he went ah and turned around was I'm not going to talk
[02:58.280 --> 03:02.600]  to you lunatic because I did address them in a genteel way with the bullhorn
[03:02.600 --> 03:07.920]  and I'm going to play that from in game blueprint for global enslavement in fact
[03:07.920 --> 03:13.120]  we're gonna go back through the dozens of hours of video from in game and put it
[03:13.120 --> 03:16.880]  all on prison planet TV in the new year I'm sure you've noticed we've been adding
[03:16.880 --> 03:20.720]  two or three exclusive interviews where we fly around the country to do these
[03:20.720 --> 03:26.000]  interviews every week what's happened is 40 50 60 I don't know interviews I've
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.040]  done while I'm a bit obsessing on this eugenics film in the last year and a
[03:30.040 --> 03:33.880]  half why not just put them all out for prison planet TV viewers and then they'll
[03:33.880 --> 03:37.160]  all be condensed and focused and connected to documents when I do put it
[03:37.160 --> 03:41.360]  in the film but it's all going up on prison planet TV including the Alex

[06:59.320 --> 07:03.440]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[07:03.440 --> 07:07.760]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[07:07.760 --> 07:11.960]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[07:11.960 --> 07:15.960]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[07:15.960 --> 07:19.840]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[07:19.840 --> 07:24.080]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[07:24.080 --> 07:28.280]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[07:28.280 --> 07:32.560]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[07:32.560 --> 07:36.280]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[07:36.280 --> 07:40.480]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[07:40.480 --> 07:43.880]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[07:43.880 --> 07:47.560]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[07:47.560 --> 07:52.720]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the

[08:00.480 --> 08:10.360]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network well we
[08:10.360 --> 08:15.000]  have a very important transmission lined up for you today a man who needs no
[08:15.000 --> 08:19.400]  introduction joins us coming up in t-minus 52 minutes and that of course is
[08:19.400 --> 08:23.440]  Gerald Salente of the Trends Research Institute and we have Porter
[08:23.440 --> 08:28.080]  Stansbury who Barron's called his predictions on what's happening in the
[08:28.080 --> 08:33.280]  financial markets over the years dire prophecies that have come true and he's
[08:33.280 --> 08:38.920]  going to be joining us as well and he believes that the dollar will die as the
[08:38.920 --> 08:42.760]  World Reserve currency this year that's already happening but all the other
[08:42.760 --> 08:49.560]  currencies are basically being devalued as well in concert right now so it's a
[08:49.560 --> 08:55.840]  very very complex situation we're going to be breaking down in great detail but
[08:55.840 --> 09:01.400]  the first thing I wanted to cover before I get into the economy before I get into
[09:01.400 --> 09:06.920]  the latest WikiLeaks information before we cover Ron Paul's announcement that he
[09:06.920 --> 09:11.600]  will move to audit the Fed and then ultimately abolish it and now is the
[09:11.600 --> 09:15.880]  head of the key subcommittee that's over regulating the private Federal
[09:15.880 --> 09:21.640]  Reserve we're gonna be breaking that down but first I wanted to get into a
[09:21.640 --> 09:26.760]  story that Jason Douglas one of our great graphics guys and a camera fellas
[09:26.760 --> 09:33.120]  here in the office also reporter wrote for info wars dot com it's the top link
[09:33.120 --> 09:39.560]  center column double linked actually on the drudge report today iPhone snitch
[09:39.560 --> 09:45.160]  network launched and there's been similar ones that I think we're have
[09:45.160 --> 09:48.440]  added to the bottom of the story they have that one where if you see the lights
[09:48.440 --> 09:53.800]  on a business you report it over a website or if you see somebody who
[09:53.800 --> 09:57.000]  hadn't cut their grass you call the police on them and then you upload your
[09:57.000 --> 10:04.560]  videos of snitching to the site but this is a app developed by a group with
[10:04.560 --> 10:10.400]  inside connections the Department of Homeland Security iPhone snitch network
[10:10.400 --> 10:15.160]  launched a new iPhone app with the misleading name Patriot app like they
[10:15.160 --> 10:19.320]  call the Patriot Act Patriotic when it's the opposite of that and butchers the
[10:19.320 --> 10:23.840]  bill of rights a new iPhone app with the misleading name Patriot app attempts to
[10:23.840 --> 10:28.120]  draw on the power of the Patriot movement turning smartphone users into
[10:28.120 --> 10:33.240]  gigantic snitch network you might think an app with such a patriotic name might
[10:33.240 --> 10:36.360]  have useful functions like a pocket Constitution or quotes from the
[10:36.360 --> 10:40.600]  forefathers but contrary to the services one might expect this app allows
[10:40.600 --> 10:45.320]  users to report any suspicious behavior directly linking them with top
[10:45.320 --> 10:50.240]  government agencies so I'm saying report on and we're all a locky being number
[10:50.240 --> 10:54.440]  one in al-Qaeda under bin Laden being under Pentagon control according to Fox
[10:54.440 --> 10:58.240]  News I'm calling for you to send them tips about Larry Silverstein saying that
[10:58.240 --> 11:03.600]  they blew up building 7 on 9-11 and when you see a bunch of illegal aliens out
[11:03.600 --> 11:09.880]  there you know basically engaging in whatever lawlessness you want or driving
[11:09.880 --> 11:16.320]  cars without licenses or insurance just go to the Patriot app the problem is of
[11:16.320 --> 11:19.520]  course they won't then do anything about it and we've got the homeland
[11:19.520 --> 11:24.640]  security DHS internal reports for now almost two years and 95% of it as we've
[11:24.640 --> 11:28.960]  reported is focused on gun owners conservatives libertarians bob bar
[11:28.960 --> 11:33.000]  supporters in the Fedders Ron Paul supporters people that like Aaron
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.440]  Russo's film America freedom to fascism that exposes the IRS this is for the
[11:38.440 --> 11:42.160]  American people and they now admit that homeland security's got telescreens and
[11:42.160 --> 11:45.200]  billboards going up just saying report everything to us report to the threat
[11:45.200 --> 11:50.680]  fusion center your local federalization spy base media comes in to interview me
[11:50.680 --> 11:54.600]  here in town CBC and the Austin police say why do you want to interview him like
[11:54.600 --> 12:01.440]  it's their job or their jurisdiction to be trying to intimidate media means
[12:01.440 --> 12:06.080]  that we're not in Kansas anymore much like the new DHS program if you see
[12:06.080 --> 12:10.120]  something say something this app is meant to turn average citizens into a
[12:10.120 --> 12:14.040]  network of spies feeding information back to the federal government and it's
[12:14.040 --> 12:18.920]  about normalizing the idea it's about acclimating everybody that it's
[12:18.920 --> 12:23.960]  patriotic that it's freedom to have telescreens bossing you around and the
[12:23.960 --> 12:28.800]  government with amber alert signs first it was to help little kidnapped girls
[12:28.800 --> 12:34.200]  now it's report illegal guns report marijuana report parents spanking their
[12:34.200 --> 12:37.920]  children even though it's not illegal see they train you it's for the scary
[12:37.920 --> 12:42.760]  men in turbines from the caves who can make norad stand down and fly jets
[12:42.760 --> 12:47.400]  better than fighter pilots and engage in maneuvers of the Pentagon that pilots
[12:47.400 --> 12:50.320]  are on record saying are impossible you know we're supposed to be afraid of the
[12:50.320 --> 12:55.080]  magic jack-in-the-box Taliban al-qaeda who's always being protected and
[12:55.080 --> 13:01.280]  funded by the State Department CIA on record just legions of evidence but
[13:01.280 --> 13:06.760]  meanwhile it's all for us when you go to an urban warfare drill going back now
[13:06.760 --> 13:10.720]  at least 13 years that I've been going to these and of course 13 years ago it
[13:10.720 --> 13:14.120]  wasn't in the news I'd show people the video and people couldn't believe it
[13:14.120 --> 13:17.720]  now it's on the news all the Marines are in town training to take on this
[13:17.720 --> 13:21.880]  Ronald veterans all the boys scouts are training with homeland security to take
[13:21.880 --> 13:27.560]  on disgruntled veterans in gun sweeps oh Arcadia Iowa the armies coming in to do
[13:27.560 --> 13:31.040]  a gun sweep door-to-door asking to search homes and they're practicing
[13:31.040 --> 13:36.800]  raiding the local gun shop oh now it's just yes we're here for you but they
[13:36.800 --> 13:40.520]  started with we're tearing down crack houses in Dallas we're running DUI
[13:40.520 --> 13:44.080]  checkpoints in California we're shutting down highways looking for drugs in
[13:44.080 --> 13:48.120]  Tennessee and four other states the governor says don't do it last year
[13:48.120 --> 13:52.240]  they say we don't care we're gonna do it it's all in police state for the rise
[13:52.240 --> 13:56.840]  of FEMA it's and they're acclimating the troops they're acclimating the cops
[13:56.840 --> 14:01.800]  they're acclimating the citizens we're all being brainwashed to go under
[14:01.800 --> 14:05.600]  martial law martial law is basically already in effect except they haven't
[14:05.600 --> 14:08.960]  started to shut down the media but now they're running the stuck snap and the
[14:08.960 --> 14:13.080]  wiki leaks false flags against the web as a pretext to start shutting it down
[14:13.080 --> 14:16.680]  and curtailing it and the legislation is introduced can't you see what's
[14:16.680 --> 14:23.000]  happening continuing with the article here much like the new DHS program if
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  you see something say something the app is meant to turn average citizens into a
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.040]  network of spies feeding information back to the federal government citizen
[14:30.040 --> 14:34.760]  concepts a company formed by insiders from DHS defines the use of such an app
[14:34.760 --> 14:38.640]  on their homepage and see it's just like you've got all these other homeland
[14:38.640 --> 14:43.640]  security insiders like the former head cherdoth running around making all this
[14:43.640 --> 14:48.840]  money you know they order the machines then they retire from government into
[14:48.840 --> 14:53.120]  the companies that are making the money and that's what this is the new service
[14:53.120 --> 15:00.080]  economy is the police state this is what the new service economy is this is
[15:00.080 --> 15:06.120]  what they're doing this is where the government funding is going the the
[15:06.120 --> 15:11.320]  fastest growing and largest subsection of scholarships going back five years I
[15:11.320 --> 15:14.880]  saw this number in the Wall Street Journal is homeland security related
[15:14.880 --> 15:19.800]  data mining spying tracking face scanning cameras technicians for
[15:19.800 --> 15:26.280]  computers license plate readers I mean this is total control and when you go
[15:26.280 --> 15:30.960]  rent a car they sit there and ask you questions like you're flying on LL out
[15:30.960 --> 15:35.520]  of Israel and they don't tell you hey I'm spying on you when you go have a child
[15:35.520 --> 15:39.480]  they don't tell you the nurses asking hey you got plenty of money oh your
[15:39.480 --> 15:43.200]  husband's out of the room honey or your boyfriend is does he ever mean to you

[16:05.680 --> 16:09.240]  instinctively know it's dangerous I mean if they see something a crime or
[16:09.240 --> 16:13.080]  something that's real they're gonna report it they don't need to be told
[16:13.080 --> 16:17.480]  spy on each other they don't need to have it constantly pushed on us so we

[24:38.440 --> 24:45.720]  congressman in the news saying Congress exists to serve the banks that is
[24:45.720 --> 24:51.720]  an actual quote I'm gonna be getting into later Congress asked the head of
[24:51.720 --> 24:55.440]  the Treasury the head of the Fed under Bush under Obama every month they say
[24:55.440 --> 24:59.760]  where did this trillion go where did this 800 billion go where did this three
[24:59.760 --> 25:06.920]  trillion go and they tell them we're not gonna tell you and then we learn that
[25:06.920 --> 25:11.600]  over 3 trillion of the 28 trillion Bloomberg's reported on went to foreign
[25:11.600 --> 25:18.080]  banks and mainline us media when the government is secretly funding media for
[25:18.080 --> 25:22.040]  propaganda purposes member six seven years ago Armstrong Williams quarter
[25:22.040 --> 25:25.760]  million dollars a year to come out and promote no child left behind to
[25:25.760 --> 25:30.720]  conservatives which is not conservative it's federalization of schools then when
[25:30.720 --> 25:34.040]  they fail the test which they're designed to fail the feds come in and
[25:34.040 --> 25:41.000]  fully federalize he was on the payroll quarter mill and totally discredited
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.800]  himself but now so much media is on the payroll that it's like a big deal in
[25:46.800 --> 25:53.240]  SNBC is almost completely funded I mean the advertising is just gravy by your
[25:53.240 --> 25:58.200]  money it is literally like Pravda or something out of the Kremlin 50 years
[25:58.200 --> 26:02.480]  ago but the average person doesn't even know that buried in the news two weeks
[26:02.480 --> 26:08.240]  ago and now I mean again we know what a tyrannical country is we know what an
[26:08.240 --> 26:13.800]  oppressive police state is and it's like Santa Claus making a list checking it
[26:13.800 --> 26:18.800]  twice but not to see who's been naughty and nice Santa Claus is going down the
[26:18.800 --> 26:23.720]  list going hmm Nazi Germany did that we'll do it Stalinist Russia did that
[26:23.720 --> 26:28.320]  we'll do it Malice China did that we'll do it Pol Pot did this in Cambodia
[26:28.320 --> 26:34.800]  Fidel Castro hmm police black uniforms police police wearing ski mask the
[26:34.800 --> 26:38.760]  citizens being trained to spy on neighbors youth brigades being trained
[26:38.760 --> 26:44.200]  president calling for civilian security force hmm telescreens right out of
[26:44.200 --> 26:48.840]  1984 telling you to spy on other shoppers that's the equivalent of having
[26:48.840 --> 26:54.600]  a castle or the drawbridge and other entrances and an enemy comes to the
[26:54.600 --> 27:01.920]  castle and is attacking and the guards on the castle lower the gates lower the
[27:01.920 --> 27:07.040]  drawbridge and then run in and aim swords and spears at five-year-old
[27:07.040 --> 27:13.760]  children sleeping inside the castle I mean just randomly here let's have some
[27:13.760 --> 27:18.440]  TSA at a checkpoint in southern Florida let's have some TSA in Dallas on the
[27:18.440 --> 27:23.440]  highway let's have some TSA with the police in the middle of Iowa let's have
[27:23.440 --> 27:27.000]  the army and Marines running checkpoints in Tennessee and Texas and
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.320]  California and it's just put New Mexico I mean videos are pouring in and it's
[27:33.320 --> 27:36.920]  on the news oh the Marines dropped by today to run a checkpoint the football
[27:36.920 --> 27:41.160]  game the high school football isn't it nice they were searching cars and then
[27:41.160 --> 27:47.480]  we see photos on the news and video of Marines searching citizens cars let's
[27:47.480 --> 27:50.480]  look for terrorists and just randomly they take you up in an airplane and you
[27:50.480 --> 27:54.520]  you jump out with a parachute and land in a cornfield start running around
[27:54.520 --> 28:00.240]  randomly this isn't designed to target terrorists even if you believe it's
[28:00.240 --> 28:05.240]  real even if you ignore all the evidence of how it's provocateur and how it's
[28:05.240 --> 28:10.760]  allowed and how it's even created in some cases there's different variants it's
[28:10.760 --> 28:17.920]  aimed at us troops in schools saying report things to the army that was on
[28:17.920 --> 28:25.880]  the Pentagon news this week we posted the video on info wars.com in fact I
[28:25.880 --> 28:28.760]  think I said post that but I don't think it was posted we played part of it on
[28:28.760 --> 28:32.800]  here it's on the federal jack YouTube channel one of you guys grab it and have
[28:32.800 --> 28:36.000]  Kurt post it are no curts in their listing right now actually I didn't see
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.000]  that if it was on the side I missed it I apologize but let's get that up I mean
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.760]  and they just do this over and over again until we don't get upset by it
[28:44.760 --> 28:51.960]  anymore and they're offering rewards if something leads to a conviction but then
[28:51.960 --> 28:54.720]  I guarantee you because people I mean sheriffs have been on record they'll
[28:54.720 --> 29:02.240]  arrest a van full of 15 illegals with marijuana with whiskey drunk no IDs no
[29:02.240 --> 29:08.760]  insurance I guarantee if they pulled over a truck full of 10 black people or 10
[29:08.760 --> 29:14.320]  white people or 10 Hispanic Americans or 15 or whatever the case is and
[29:14.320 --> 29:19.040]  there's whiskey and marijuana and no IDs and no insurance everybody's going to
[29:19.040 --> 29:24.080]  jail but the illegal aliens get pulled over because the globalist want them
[29:24.080 --> 29:28.200]  here to drive down the wages part of globalism that race to the bottom not
[29:28.200 --> 29:32.720]  to help mexico but to use this us as a steam valve of the revolution down
[29:32.720 --> 29:40.560]  there I mean you report real crime going on nothing's gonna be done by these

[33:20.960 --> 33:34.280]  the globalists are trying to get us in a stranglehold take control of all
[33:34.280 --> 33:38.360]  agriculture take control of the family they've taken control of our currency
[33:38.360 --> 33:42.320]  they've gotten us deep into debt they've demonized America's name by launching
[33:42.320 --> 33:47.400]  all these wars using our military and our funding now they're moving to the
[33:47.400 --> 33:51.640]  global government phase where the United States is blamed for all the world's
[33:51.640 --> 33:56.440]  problems and a private corporate government is offered as the solution
[33:56.440 --> 34:02.680]  posing as liberal trendies demanding global carbon taxes this is the system
[34:02.680 --> 34:07.920]  and they've got their spy grid going into place everywhere with things like the
[34:07.920 --> 34:14.640]  iPhone Patriot app covered at info wars.com here's another report along
[34:14.640 --> 34:18.040]  the same lines remember three months ago Google came out and reported what I
[34:18.040 --> 34:24.040]  already seen and some of their patent filings years ago that Google believes
[34:24.040 --> 34:29.080]  they can predict the future of mass movements upwards of 99% of the time
[34:29.080 --> 34:35.320]  and individuals 93% of the time that's why they have that instant search where
[34:35.320 --> 34:40.720]  it knows what you want here's the silicon.com article Google will find it
[34:40.720 --> 34:46.920]  before you know you need it and so you think you're going up to Google or I
[34:46.920 --> 34:51.760]  think I'm going up to Google just to get information I want this was created
[34:51.760 --> 34:56.600]  by the NSA and CIA that's now on record oh don't be evil it's designed to make
[34:56.600 --> 35:02.280]  the internet the surveillance control grid net the worldwide wiretap it uses
[35:02.280 --> 35:07.400]  NSA keyword technology and it's knowing what your utmost secrets are it's
[35:07.400 --> 35:12.800]  knowing what you're looking for it knows your habits because they've now set up
[35:12.800 --> 35:17.400]  identity addresses on almost every device an iPhone a regular cell phone
[35:17.400 --> 35:25.080]  a droid a Mac a PC it's a total control grid and Microsoft the federal
[35:25.080 --> 35:29.440]  government they admit they're going towards web ID by law to track what
[35:29.440 --> 35:36.160]  you're doing then they can IP spoof you and frame you remember that when they
[35:36.160 --> 35:42.400]  say oh DNA is 100% oh IP addresses are 100% no they're not this is the system
[35:42.400 --> 35:46.360]  that's going into place but they want to start restricting freedom of speech on
[35:46.360 --> 35:49.480]  the web because they arrogantly thought they could just use the web as a tool of
[35:49.480 --> 35:54.560]  control we've been seizing the initiative and using it to expose what
[35:54.560 --> 35:59.680]  the globalist are up to Google is working on a service that finds
[35:59.680 --> 36:04.240]  information before a user has ever started looking for it forget Google
[36:04.240 --> 36:08.960]  instant this is about preemptively pushing data at users before they know
[36:08.960 --> 36:14.960]  it said Marissa mayor Google's VP of geographic and local services who was
[36:14.960 --> 36:19.280]  speaking at the low web internet conference in Paris this week Google
[36:19.280 --> 36:24.480]  what she went on to say is looking at what she called contextually discovery
[36:24.480 --> 36:29.920]  or contextual discovery as a way to evolve search pushing information out to
[36:29.920 --> 36:34.120]  people before they started to look for it based on factors such as their
[36:34.120 --> 36:38.920]  web browsing history or current location so tracking you in real time we've
[36:38.920 --> 36:43.280]  started to play around with some new concepts to find information she said
[36:43.280 --> 36:46.440]  yeah I bet they started to play around with some concepts one of their biggest
[36:46.440 --> 36:51.840]  business models and this came out when about a year and a half ago crypto.org
[36:51.840 --> 36:58.120]  was able to get to Microsoft and Yahoo law enforcement manuals that they give
[36:58.120 --> 37:03.760]  them online secret manuals digital manuals on how to pay for and request
[37:03.760 --> 37:08.000]  data and so there's no give us a warrant for that it's just here have it all
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.640]  it's a direct conduit that's why the health care bill now law and the
[37:13.640 --> 37:17.480]  stimulus has similar legislation you know they'll pass multiple laws doing the
[37:17.480 --> 37:20.920]  same thing so if one gets struck down they have a slight variant then you got
[37:20.920 --> 37:26.400]  to fight that as well this is a just a bum rush of crooks where everything in
[37:26.400 --> 37:30.880]  your bank account everything online all your purchases in real time are tracked
[37:30.880 --> 37:37.680]  by the government if it's above $200 a year though 200 purchases a year excuse
[37:37.680 --> 37:43.800]  me for online sites and websites so all of that is going on now I want to get
[37:43.800 --> 37:50.160]  into Richard C. Holbrook who I've confronted several times at Bilderberg
[37:50.160 --> 37:54.480]  events I screamed at him for at a distance with a bullhorn at the 2008
[37:54.480 --> 37:59.160]  also at the 2006 I addressed the Bilderberg group in a lengthy speech
[37:59.160 --> 38:03.360]  we're gonna play a short clip of that for my film in-game and then I briefly
[38:03.360 --> 38:08.160]  talked to Daniel Estolin and then Holbrook comes out to talk to us or he
[38:08.160 --> 38:11.840]  was gonna walk right by us and thought we didn't know who he was I began yelling
[38:11.840 --> 38:17.160]  we're not your slaves Holbrook I should have let him get closer but it just got
[38:17.160 --> 38:21.440]  the better of me I jumped the gun nobody's perfect but he's died of an
[38:21.440 --> 38:26.280]  a complications from an a order rupture one of the most deadly you know
[38:26.280 --> 38:29.640]  heart attacks out there wasn't even a heart attacks when the big artery coming
[38:29.640 --> 38:33.600]  out of the top of your heart blows but his last words were you've got to stop
[38:33.600 --> 38:40.840]  this war in Afghanistan he told the surgeon about to operate on him and so
[38:40.840 --> 38:44.760]  you know there's Holbrook in there expanding these wars but then on his
[38:44.760 --> 38:51.360]  deathbed before they did the surgery and he died from complications he said
[38:51.360 --> 38:55.840]  quote we've got to stop this war in Afghanistan so is he like the thief
[38:55.840 --> 39:01.080]  hanging on the cross who finally repented is he today in paradise I
[39:01.080 --> 39:04.600]  certainly hope so because when I watch these globalists die I actually get a
[39:04.600 --> 39:09.920]  sad feeling but it's good to hear something repentant at the end that's
[39:09.920 --> 39:13.680]  always a good sign speaking of that we've got Lindsay Williams joining us
[39:13.680 --> 39:18.800]  mr. X has died he has some final intel and he can finally tell us things that
[39:18.800 --> 39:23.160]  he was not allowed to reveal of course he's revealed mr. X's name now former
[39:23.160 --> 39:27.360]  head of operations for Atlantic richfield and other major oil companies
[39:27.360 --> 39:31.000]  he's got another mr. X who I know his name it's actually hidden in plain view
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.760]  who was the actual CEO of another big three who's he's been talking to but
[39:35.760 --> 39:39.480]  that guy's beaten cancer so Lindsay Williams will be joining us tomorrow
[39:39.480 --> 39:43.040]  Gerald Salentes coming up at about 20 minutes and then Porter Stansbury
[39:43.040 --> 39:47.560]  unbelievable maiden voyage interview with this guy who's made predictions
[39:47.560 --> 39:54.600]  incredibly well I mean Barron's called them prophetic prophetic warnings in
[39:54.600 --> 39:57.280]  fact I'll read those actual quotes from Barron's other publications coming up
[39:57.280 --> 40:02.280]  before he joins us but right now let's go to this clip of Richard C. Holbrook
[40:02.280 --> 40:07.960]  was it foul play he was in a lot of these WikiLeaks cables he'd been
[40:07.960 --> 40:13.360]  internally reportedly critical of the war we now learn what a few months ago
[40:13.360 --> 40:19.120]  from the McChrystal debacle where he was making fun of a Holbrook let's go
[40:19.120 --> 40:24.520]  ahead and play this clip from in-game blueprint for global enslavement we take
[40:24.520 --> 40:30.920]  you back to June of 2006 in Ottawa Canada here it is
[40:30.920 --> 40:40.360]  we'll get the computer to launch here we go
[41:00.920 --> 41:06.320]  slaves we stand as free humans have stood since the beginning of time against
[41:06.320 --> 41:11.400]  the strong man against the thugs against the bullies we will defeat your
[41:11.400 --> 41:16.560]  world government we will defeat world taxation we will defeat your control
[41:16.560 --> 41:23.480]  grid God is on our side I stand before the creator of the universe and I ask
[41:23.480 --> 41:28.600]  the creator of the universe as our founding fathers did in 1776 to leave
[41:28.600 --> 41:33.280]  God and direct us and to give us the power and the foresight and the
[41:33.280 --> 41:37.920]  understanding and the will to stand against your entire agenda including
[41:37.920 --> 41:43.000]  your final plan of world population reduction of 80% that Henry Kissinger
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.920]  penned in 1973 why do you put mercury in the vaccines
[41:47.920 --> 41:53.480]  stand sodium fluoride in the water why why do you put cancer viruses in the
[41:53.480 --> 41:58.880]  vaccines why have you used to lead your mania now in four separate nations you're
[41:58.880 --> 42:02.560]  arrogant you have the sickness that elites have had throughout history in
[42:02.560 --> 42:07.360]  their literal and in some cases figurative ivory towers you believe
[42:07.360 --> 42:13.600]  that you're invincible you will and you are failing now your new world order
[42:13.600 --> 42:25.400]  will fall humanity will defeat you the answer to nineteen eighty-four is seventeen seventy-six
[42:27.920 --> 42:32.880]  billiards is an elite organization and the way it works the protocol of the
[42:32.880 --> 42:36.520]  meetings is the staff after they're vetted out they're told exactly how
[42:36.520 --> 42:40.080]  they're supposed to behave themselves meaning that they can never address the
[42:40.080 --> 42:43.560]  attendees they can never speak to them unless they're spoken to first they can
[42:43.560 --> 42:47.000]  have a look them in the eye they have to approach them from the right side the
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.400]  people who are right-handed and from the left side of people who are left-handed
[42:50.400 --> 42:55.200]  they can never look them straight on and needless to say all the information
[42:55.200 --> 42:59.400]  that is being spoken at doing the conferences is under no circumstances
[42:59.400 --> 43:03.320]  allowed to come out that's what they're told that threatened with not being able
[43:03.320 --> 43:07.040]  to find another job anywhere in the sector if they reveal any information to
[43:07.040 --> 43:17.960]  the press Richard Holbrook ambassador Richard Holbrook thought the
[43:17.960 --> 43:21.680]  peasantry wouldn't recognize him if he took a stroll off the grounds of
[43:21.680 --> 43:38.200]  Brooks Creek Holbrook cackled when I told him that we were not his slaves
[43:38.200 --> 43:52.360]  we're not your slaves whole brick we don't belong to you we're not your
[43:52.360 --> 44:21.320]  property we're free him out of it all right that's video we're gonna be going

[47:51.200 --> 47:55.880]  spread the word I got pretty negative yesterday it happens every few months
[47:55.880 --> 47:59.760]  it's like a black cloud hangs over me where I see how negative everything is
[47:59.760 --> 48:04.960]  and how how dire it is and how crazy the corruption is but there's also a huge
[48:04.960 --> 48:09.320]  awakening happening and it's always darkest before the dawn it takes things
[48:09.320 --> 48:14.600]  getting bad to test humanity's metal that's God's test for us and if you
[48:14.600 --> 48:18.240]  don't believe in God folks now's the time because they've said many times
[48:18.240 --> 48:22.720]  throughout history since World War one there are no atheists in foxholes and if
[48:22.720 --> 48:28.720]  you don't know that you're in a foxhole if you don't know that we're under
[48:28.720 --> 48:38.320]  attack societally physically genetically spiritually if you I mean if you
[48:38.320 --> 48:41.000]  can't see the humanities going in the wrong direction and things are getting
[48:41.000 --> 48:47.000]  nuts the globalist are just throwing it in your face now it is so incredible to
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.480]  watch all of this unfold and I'm sad for Holbrook rewatching the video I
[48:51.480 --> 48:57.040]  remember what happened he's about 80 yards away and he's walking straight and
[48:57.040 --> 49:02.160]  then right as I recognize him and decide to yell at him he starts turning now
[49:02.160 --> 49:06.760]  he's about 60 yards away walking straight towards us so I'd already open my
[49:06.760 --> 49:13.160]  mouth and then he gets I'd say about 50 yards away and stops you know and throws
[49:13.160 --> 49:16.880]  his arms up and walks away so he was either gonna walk off the property for
[49:16.880 --> 49:20.680]  a walk and thought we were too dumb to recognize him or he was coming up to talk
[49:20.680 --> 49:24.680]  to us I don't know but he turns around and goes back in and I wish he would
[49:24.680 --> 49:28.960]  have come out but and then I could have gone up and talked to him that have
[49:28.960 --> 49:35.800]  been classic but information but there it is and I'm just glad to see him you
[49:35.800 --> 49:39.400]  right before he was put under saying you know in the war he reportedly said
[49:39.400 --> 49:43.880]  more Richard Holbrook Obama's point man on the Pakistan Afghanistan has died
[49:43.880 --> 49:47.800]  following a second round of surgery to treat a heart condition officialdom in
[49:47.800 --> 49:52.280]  the corporate media are in mourning praise for the one-worlder gluts the
[49:52.280 --> 49:56.080]  media the international community is praising the legacy of veteran US
[49:56.080 --> 50:00.560]  diplomat at Richard C. Holbrook who died Monday at the age of 69 so last night
[50:00.560 --> 50:03.520]  while serving as the special representative for Afghanistan and
[50:03.520 --> 50:08.240]  Pakistan reports CIA propaganda outfit voice of America you've got to stop

[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.520]  in the month of december and that's certainly happening with gold and silver
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.600]  exploding
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.720]  unemployment well above twenty three percent
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:50.040]  there's the real world that Gerald Salente covers and there's the delusional world
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:54.240]  telling us that in june of last year the recession ended
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.160]  but every real economic indicator is we're in deep trouble

[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:06.880]  above the profits in two thousand eight the profits in two thousand nine
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.080]  and going into this year are even bigger for wall street
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.320]  and so we're gonna talk to Gerald Salente about wiki leaks
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.000]  about the economy about what he sees in two thousand

[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.160]  of the biggest trends you're looking at right now and what bombshells do you

[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.040]  look what happened in the u k on friday
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:51.040]  and go back to the autumn trends journal
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.240]  the headline of the trends journal
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.160]  was off with their heads two point oh
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.120]  what were they screaming at the royal couple
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.880]  in their roles rights
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.600]  off with their heads
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.960]  the people have had it they're fed up
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:08.680]  they know the deal in fact you always say that you said it's gonna be off with
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:10.600]  their heads
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.960]  yes matter of fact i tell people if you want to know a good entrepreneurial
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.560]  business to consider
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.840]  guillotine's might be it
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.320]  because this is going worldwide
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.080]  the people know the deal alex here's the deal
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.320]  it's called austerity measures
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.600]  what austerity measures equal
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.700]  you lose your job
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:33.360]  if you have one you get paid less
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.400]  you get your benefits cut
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.040]  i want by the way
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.060]  we're gonna raise your taxes and you know why
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:43.200]  because the white shoe boys can't get a haircut
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.800]  that's their language for taking losses
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.640]  on multi-billion dollar bed bets
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.160]  that they've made
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.360]  so the people are angry and what happened in the u k
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:57.240]  with the increase in tuition going up check it out
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.520]  two hundred percent
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:03.040]  you think they're angry and by the way they also know
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.960]  that an education is a degree in worthlessness
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.040]  these days
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.840]  because it doesn't mean you're going to get a job
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.200]  so people want to look at something really hot going on
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.920]  stay with that story and stay with this
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.760]  they took it out of the british news like of that
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:24.480]  they was white out of the news of the off with their heads news
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.040]  the day it happened
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:30.280]  so this is something really to to focus in on
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:35.040]  absolutely spontaneous rage and anger when we come back
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.680]  let's talk about ireland
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.920]  it's admitted that the people don't owe the money
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.680]  it's the offshore banks
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.920]  that owe the money
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.760]  and as soon as they entered the e u which is an admitted
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.480]  receivership takeover system
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.640]  as soon as they were under that contractually
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.880]  then they tell them all your economy's over
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.600]  we've got a razor taxes cut all your benefits
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.440]  and the head of their private central bank

[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:17.320]  another issue we're gonna be tracking with gerald salante is the increased
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.160]  crime we're seeing
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.440]  and the government's been caught trying to spend those numbers as well
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:25.600]  we're seeing big calls for internet censorship google
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.800]  was in the wall street journal two days ago
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.800]  at a big report where they're being caught
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:33.240]  not just censoring alternative news but also their competition
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.760]  uh... google is really
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.080]  needs to be replaced like my space or other things

[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:43.480]  it's time
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:46.760]  to start the exodus away from that big brother
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.120]  uh... institution
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.040]  uh...

[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:54.800]  he has been saying for at least two years on my show
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:58.400]  it's gonna be off with their heads
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.960]  and uh... our memory but it's got to be six months ago in fact of listeners can
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.040]  pull it up
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.640]  i've seen him on national tv to the same thing
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:09.960]  going into december going i'm gonna have to imitate it
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.200]  but i mean you can uh... imitate me it's just yet
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:15.280]  i'm trying to give the exact you know flavor of what you said it's going to be
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:17.600]  off with their heads
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:22.320]  going into december going into two thousand eleven it's going to be a revolution
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.800]  by twenty twelve
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:28.200]  i mean you said that over and over again and now it's off with their heads
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.360]  uh... spontaneous riot
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:34.640]  attacking the uh... duchess of
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:39.000]  twintliness and the prince of uh... corruption
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  yeah we're going to keep seeing it i'll give you another one alex
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.920]  two weeks ago not this past sunday but the sunday before
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.720]  the new york times
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.960]  the toilet paper of record
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:54.920]  wrote a feature story in the magazine section
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:58.120]  on america's least-hated banker
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:00.560]  jamie diamond the ceo
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:03.400]  of jp morgan chase
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:07.160]  the guy is you're reading this story this puff piece
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.040]  all the way into it he said oh by the way
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.920]  my mommy and daddy
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:16.160]  uh... my mommy's good friends with the diamond family
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.000]  that's just a little note
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.040]  yes so then you read this puff piece and then go to the new york times website
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:26.440]  read the story and then look at the comments
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.880]  one scathing comment after another
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:35.000]  what a suck up in brown those of this guy lowenstein who wrote the story is
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.840]  what a disgusting character jamie diamond is it got so bad
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.840]  that they stopped having comments coming in
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.280]  after a hundred and thirty eight of them
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:48.400]  i think he probably the only good comment was there
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.840]  was this guy lowenstein's mother
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.600]  who's good friends with jamie diamonds family
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:57.200]  so when you read this stuff and you see the anger out there
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.160]  it's real but here's the other side
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:03.080]  look how those brave bobby's
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:05.840]  beat up all those students
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:09.480]  did you see the one from the bbc
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:13.440]  where they grabbed this guy out of a wheelchair
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:16.160]  and dragged him across the pavement
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.640]  and this disgusting interviewer on the bbc
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:23.800]  is saying to the guy you gotta see it
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:27.560]  well they said that you were rolling at them
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.240]  the police
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:33.120]  and if you think the media in this country is servile
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:36.360]  you gotta look at theirs it's just as bad
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:39.440]  so what they're going to do is they're going to keep coming
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:42.280]  harder and harder down on the people
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:44.840]  to stop the revolution
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.760]  so that's what we're up against
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:49.960]  it's going to be a cyber war and it's going to be
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.160]  the real war
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:54.200]  it's going to be the government crackdowns
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.560]  and the people trying to rise up
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:59.400]  it's no different than any other revolution
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.760]  you know i'm glad you raise that issue because i want to discuss what you see
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:05.960]  happening the next year what's gonna happen in the economy but also
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.920]  the government and the and the fortune one hundred
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:12.840]  a response to it but also what you expect to see the population do
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:17.960]  but i make these hardcore scathing videos
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:21.960]  about the banking system about the tele screens going in walmart
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:25.400]  telling citizens to spy on each other and spy on other
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:28.600]  uh shoppers i mean it's right on 1984
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:31.480]  and if you click on the youtube like or dislike
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:35.720]  depending on the video it'll be three thousand likes
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:39.640]  next to you know fifty something or a hundred something dislikes
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.800]  i mean it's literally 95 percent of people
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:47.320]  agree with me and disagree with the government
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:51.800]  then if you go to the homeland security
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:58.280]  official web page per video it will be thousands of dislikes
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:01.640]  and every comment hating them and saying we know you're the terrorist
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.080]  we know you're staging the events why don't you report on yourselves
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.840]  and almost no one liking in fact there it is on screen
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:12.440]  of one of my videos with close to 300 000 views
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:16.200]  the title of the video if folks want to go look at it as walmart
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:19.880]  invasion part of larger dhs takeover of america
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:28.760]  there is 1733 likes 94 dislikes now again you go over to the homeland
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:33.320]  security website and it's the flip of that
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:37.560]  and you read the comments everyone gets it
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:41.080]  you know they're saying you want us to not trust each other you want us to spy
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:44.280]  this is like nazi germany or east germany or russia
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:47.880]  hey i want to report on shirt off ordering the naked body scanners
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:51.800]  and then making money off of them i mean every i mean people are really
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:55.240]  getting educated there's an explosive awakening
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:59.960]  happening and they are saying off with their heads i'm concerned though and i've
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:03.560]  seen the government provocateur to try to start something violent
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:07.720]  so they have a pretext to clamp down but i want to warn the government
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:11.160]  this could backfire on you trying to start a fight
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.760]  or staging terror attacks like a new oklahoma city to blame it on the
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:18.680]  liberty movement your comment on the awakening when you see it
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:22.280]  really going to flashpoint and how you see the establishment countering
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:26.440]  as geruel solente you know my saying is a
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:31.880]  bronx boy when people lose everything and they have nothing left to lose
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:36.280]  they lose it and they're losing it because they're losing their homes
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.520]  they're losing their jobs these guys these people getting
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:45.080]  and women getting out of college again with these degrees and worthlessness
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:49.880]  they can't find jobs you think they're angry and they got all that testosterone
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:53.320]  running through these guys you think they're going to take to the streets
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:57.160]  and take it out on somebody when is it going to happen
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:02.120]  it's going to happen when people finally wake up to the reality
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:05.800]  that the dollar isn't going to be worth a dime
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:09.880]  that all they've saved they've they've saved for nothing
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:14.040]  they find out that they're rich as we've seen and i love it now
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:17.800]  now that it's it's i've been saying this i don't know how many years
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:22.040]  that the gap between the rich and the poor is the widest in the us
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:25.480]  than any of the industrialized nations now
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:29.480]  just now mainstream media is finally saying that
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:34.280]  so as they see the richer get richer and them getting poorer
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:39.080]  what do they have to lose by taking taking to the streets nothing
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:44.200]  so what we're going to look at here's and but i want to make this clear also
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:49.080]  we predicted the crash of 2010 it's in the trends journal it was a top trend
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:54.200]  that came out last december a year ago what we made it we made it perfectly
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:57.320]  clear would not be an equity market crash because
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:01.560]  it was a rig market and it was going to be cheap interest rates that keep
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:05.320]  floating this and we also said there would be schemes
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:09.160]  undreamed of that would keep propping it up
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:13.400]  and we saw the scheme that just came out as the result of the
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:17.240]  frank the dod frank bill that the federal reserve
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:21.000]  has dealt loaned and and under the table dealt
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.400]  over third or 13 trillion dollars all over the world
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:29.320]  to all different kinds of companies general electric
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:33.160]  holly davidson mcdonald's credit switch stewardship bank
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:38.360]  the tokyo banks bank of england it's what the con game is
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:43.160]  that they're conning us with the bank deals so yeah they're propping it up
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:46.760]  but what we're saying is that it's collapsed
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:52.680]  and people the the headline story alex for the trends journals top trends
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:55.880]  that are coming out in a few weeks for 2011
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:17:01.400]  is wake up call 2011 only the blind the inept the
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:07.240]  ideologically driven and little kids aren't going to know the deal and the
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:12.280]  deal is this europe has collapsed there is no
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:17.480]  EU it's gone they're not going to be able to bail out
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:21.320]  portugal they won't be able to bail out spain
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:26.280]  island is toast they're not going to be able to salvage
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:33.560]  italy with its 120 percent of debt to gdp ratio
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:39.720]  they won't salvage Greece the germans are going to go off on their own
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:45.080]  there's going to be a global currency crisis it's happening in front of us
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:49.080]  why do you think people why can't they wake up
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:55.960]  and see why gold is trading at 1400 dollars an ounce
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:18:00.360]  there is no end in sight but the end will come
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:05.480]  when the markets collapse and we believe that there's going to be a global
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:12.360]  financial crisis a a crack up in 2011
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:16.040]  that people will no longer be able to deny
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:20.520]  and the world banks will no longer be able to cover up
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:24.600]  by printing more of their digital money that's not
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:29.080]  worth the paper it's not printed on well gerald
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:33.000]  we know that the mega central banks have wanted to consolidate power
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.680]  but now they're getting desperate they realize they've destroyed things so bad
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:42.680]  they're finally actually trying to cut taxes but it looks like too little too
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:48.280]  late but here's the model here is the ireland banks are all
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:54.600]  for sale central banker this is out of cnbc and he went on to
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:57.720]  say they are for sale as far as i'm concerned
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:01.880]  i've always been an advocate for foreign banks to own small countries
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:05.480]  and he goes on here this is their central banker they told them a year ago
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:08.680]  they had the best economy in europe they set them up they brought them in and
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:11.400]  i've seen it the german news the germans are saying they're getting
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:15.640]  ready to leave the euro if this continues and i've
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:20.040]  seen the financial breakdowns this is mathematically impossible
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:24.440]  to pay back and the system knows that so they're just trying to suck as much as
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:27.000]  they can while telling everybody that everything's
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.120]  fine exactly and by the way that's where this whole

[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.680]  but as you said everybody's starting to wake up to them
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:03.480]  but what about when you look at ireland cutting the benefits that are paid for
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:07.800]  raising the taxes admitting everything goes to the bankers
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:12.520]  what is this hubris this arrogance why are they so

[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:38.120]  congress just grovels when they see grain span they just fall to their knees
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:44.200]  and go my lord my king rape me so the cops have the
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:48.920]  they get it you don't touch the big guys they got the orders
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.360]  and they can't beat the crime guys on the street
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:56.360]  you know the the the bloods in the crypts and the rest of them
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:01.240]  which is a growing organization that's an industry that's thriving they can't
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.360]  beat the mexican mafia crimes exploding but they can sure
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:07.160]  they can you know i've seen old ladies pulled over in austin
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:11.000]  with cops walk up with their hands on their guns with two old women in a
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.280]  convertible uh you know sea breeze car or whatever
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:17.720]  but but then when they see real criminals they just seem to grovel in
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:20.120]  fear so that's what's happened the cops have
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:23.400]  become the crime bosses the enforcers for the crime
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:26.840]  bosses by the way crime that's going to be one of the
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:31.480]  crime wave 2011 this thing's starting to break loose and as you pointed out
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:36.200]  they're cooking the numbers what a surprise they cook the inflation numbers
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:39.160]  they cook the unemployment numbers they cook
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:42.680]  they cook the numbers about how many people we've killed in a
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:47.480]  they've killed in iraq and afghanistan and they're lying about the crime
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:51.400]  numbers it's going to get much worse and it's
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:55.640]  worldwide and criminal activity by the way is accepted
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:00.760]  if you can you see it on wall street why not and everybody else so it's gaming
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:04.680]  the welfare system gaming the system to become
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:09.080]  disabled or ripping off the system from the top
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:14.360]  so as people start losing more and more crime is going to go higher and higher
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:18.120]  i don't care what these academics and these crime
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:24.440]  experts say that there is no relevant evidence gerald i mean half the places i

[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:35.400]  but then i read in the news they say old crimes not up in austin

[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:30.520]  2011 but i'm going to get some of those from him here in a moment
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:35.240]  but here it is regulators exist to serve the banks
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:39.960]  next house finance chairman declares so
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:43.480]  that's the guy above the committee that paul runs paul
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:47.720]  is able to subpoena and get dirt on the fed but the big committee above him
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:51.480]  says we are here to serve them listen to this
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:56.760]  alabama republican spencer bachas the incoming chairman of the house banking
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:00.040]  committee suggests congress and federal regulators
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:04.200]  should play a subservient role with banks
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:08.760]  member a year ago a green span on the former chairman of the fed
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:12.120]  on pbs saying we're outside government we run the government
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:15.880]  no one can regulate us i mean this is just made up pure arrogance
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:18.920]  no wonder we're being completely robbed by these people
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:23.000]  it's in the constitution it's we the people and the congress controls that
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.120]  just because some monkey tells us in a fancy suit that he rules us or because
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:31.720]  some monkey government tells us men in uniforms are going to stick their hands
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:35.800]  down our pants doesn't mean they can do it
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:39.800]  here here's the quote from spencer bachas
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:43.960]  in washington the view is that banks are to be regulated
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:48.760]  and my view is that washington and the regulators are there to serve the banks
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:52.040]  well yeah most of them are former goldman sacks jp morgan people
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:56.360]  you know foxes guarding the hen house bachas told the birmingham news in an
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:35:00.040]  interview and it goes on i mean totally
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:03.560]  disconnected okay okay well congress isn't involved with the banks or
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:06.440]  didn't have any power over then we shouldn't have to pay them all this
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:11.800]  bailout money jerald solente well i i i think the congressman is
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:16.440]  expressing his feelings about the type of person he is
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:20.440]  and the rest of the most of congress the exception of ron paul
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:24.120]  and a few others their suck ups and bowdowns
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:28.200]  i tell you alex the worst job ever had was when i was the assistant to the
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:32.920]  secretary of the new york state senate and i watched grown men grovel all day
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:36.040]  long and i had lousy jobs in my day well
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:39.160]  that was the worst when i was a young man at a graduate school
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:42.120]  so this is who they are they're used to bowing or
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:46.200]  bending over and sucking up so they feel we should too
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:50.040]  and i'm sick and tired of them telling me
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:54.200]  what i should believe what i should think and what i should do but the fact
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:36:00.840]  is to go back to our 2008 trend alert when
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:05.160]  they came out with the tarp scheme the headline read
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:12.600]  dc heist wall street hijacks washington history was made
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:18.760]  it happened right before our eyes you talked about ruben you talked about
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:24.920]  geithner you talked about gensler you talked about the rest of the goldman sacks gang
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:32.520]  remember henry paulson frankenstein couldn't have had a better mask than that guy
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:36.840]  well you broke it all you broke it all down and obama deception and fall the

[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:45.000]  and if they can steal 20 something trillion why not steal a thousand trillion
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:50.360]  why not go completely crazy now earlier you tried to get into wiki leaks and we
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.440]  went to break and i forgot to bring it back up
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:55.800]  talk about what happened to you on fox well they brought me on and they had
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:59.000]  like five against one it's in the media blog on our

[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:16.440]  corruption get get that's the real world
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:21.160]  what i was saying is this isn't about who leaked what and how
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:27.080]  they're upset because it's uncovering what a bunch of losers they are i want to
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:32.200]  get this into everybody's minds so you don't let go of it
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:36.680]  the same people that they call diplomats ambassadors
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:40.040]  your senators your congressmen your legislators
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:45.080]  your presidents your mayors these are the same people
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:48.840]  you couldn't stand in high school in college
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:53.080]  that wanted to become the class presidents and the head of the student
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:59.400]  council what wiki leaks is showing is that's exactly who
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:03.720]  they are they're the inept and the incompetent
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:08.040]  they're doing dirty deals and it's being uncovered
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:12.680]  and they're going ballistic because that's the only thing that's holding it
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:16.360]  together there's nobody behind the curtain
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:20.840]  it's what you see is what you get how disgusting
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:25.720]  does it have to become when obama walks on the stage
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:31.320]  and gives it to slick willy to jam legislation down
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:36.920]  the throats of everybody change you could believe in
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:41.240]  man it looks like an old act to me is really
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:48.840]  a lousy repeat of an old movie the sequels as bad as the original
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:53.160]  and that's what they're doing that's the outrage of wiki leaks
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:56.200]  and why aren't they going after the new york times
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:01.400]  why aren't they going after the guardian and and their spiegel

[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:04.920]  then bush comes out twice this year and says he ordered torture
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:08.360]  he'd do it again but he's not in prison so he's like
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:11.640]  the gambino crime boss and meanwhile his

[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:28.440]  brazen well that's what's going on as i said the police have become
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:32.120]  the the enforcers for the crime bosses they're above
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:36.840]  everybody else i watched bush give some of those interviews

[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:06.040]  and the banks are doing the robbing and when we were talking about the crime
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:09.800]  wave by the way look at the security business
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:14.680]  it's booming you call up and try to get alarms installed
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:19.320]  you're going to get on a waiting list and it's going to get a lot worse
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:22.600]  if people want to see the businesses to get into
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:26.280]  boy anything having to do with crime related
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:31.320]  security is going to be a growth industry look at firearms record sales and
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:35.640]  modern history for two years and running and you look at the graphs it's only
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:39.800]  going up parabolic now i want to shift gears into
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:43.240]  some other areas and i again i can't say this on air
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:46.920]  we never used to talk about things like this but it's always in the news we're
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:50.280]  forced to this is up on prisonplanet.com
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:56.200]  kob cbs tv's reporting it it's up on prisonplanet.com
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:01.000]  these reports have been confirmed they make fun of other tsa workers genitals
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.840]  female workers they're hiring a bunch of lunatics
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:09.320]  because only a mentally ill person could put people in radiation bathers
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:13.560]  stick their hands down people's pants they're creating an army
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:16.920]  who will follow any order to then take over the streets but here's the prison
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:20.600]  planet dot com steve watson article just went up
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:27.400]  at prisonplanet.com boy ask tsa why pat down my mom and not me
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:33.320]  tsa replies and they have witnesses because you don't have
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:39.720]  b-word and uh and i've seen this where they see a good looking woman it is
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:43.400]  over these are men that could never get a woman many of them some of them are
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:47.240]  just guys that want jobs and they've been caught being child molesters
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:52.520]  planting drugs on women demanding sex i mean these are the worst type of power
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:56.680]  tripping low-grade morons what is your take on the whole tsa situation
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:01.160]  gerol salente well first of all i want to thank you
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:07.640]  for doing all that you have done to expose this nobody in the united states
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:12.760]  anywhere has done more to show what's going on than you have
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:18.600]  about breaking it down piece by piece from that little weasel shirt off the
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:23.080]  former homeland securities are going out after the
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:27.560]  the so-called christmas tree christmas day bomber
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:33.320]  was going to explode his underwear and making the rounds on the major media
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:38.600]  and and in telling us that we needed these full body x-ray machines
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:46.280]  not ever ever divulging that church of group was the consulting firm
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:52.200]  for rapid scam that sells these things so you've done more than anybody and
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:56.760]  what this is so important about it's one of those elements
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:01.080]  in the coming second american revolution because we know we're getting
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:05.000]  robbed by the bankers a lot of us know that these wars are
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.640]  immoral and that we're wasting trillions of dollars fighting them
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:13.240]  and it comes out of our paychecks but what we
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:18.680]  know it's it's it's removed but when you go to the airport
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:23.240]  and you're humiliated in front of huge crowds
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:27.560]  it's a different story when you go to the airport
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:33.640]  and you're subjugated to such behavior and and it's and it's really from a
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:38.040]  man standpoint or a woman's there's nothing more
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:42.040]  to subjugate somebody than to tell them that i could
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:47.320]  grope you and fill you up and do whatever i want
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:51.400]  and you can't do anything about it they yell at you they put you in boxes
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:55.480]  i mean the the goons doing it don't don't know why they're doing it
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:59.720]  but the social engineers know this is an act of submission this is learning
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:03.400]  exactly how to be a prisoner i mean i haven't been in jail a lot but i was
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:07.080]  in juvenile a couple times for really you know fights where they didn't know who
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:10.920]  started it so everybody goes to jail i've been in jail from protest
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:15.160]  and and and i wasn't treated this bad in jail
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:20.360]  as you're treated in an airport and you you got it you it's a form of submission
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:25.080]  so here's what they do first they take your money
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:29.320]  and they tell you taking your money and i'm giving it to my big friends
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:34.360]  so they knock you down like that and now they knock you down again
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:38.360]  by i i'm coming back from los vegas a couple of weeks ago
[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:42.680]  i'm sitting next to an 82 year old woman
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:47.560]  she reminded my aunt zizi may a soul rest in peace big chubby face
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:51.800]  she got frisked because they found needles
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:58.440]  in her luggage she's a diabetic she said why are you doing this to an old lady
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:01.800]  they were doing it right out in front of everybody
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:07.080]  feeling her up as she demanded that they take her into a private room
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:15.000]  they forced this poor old lady to walk across the floor this filthy floor
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.160]  without her shoes they made her leave her shoes behind
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:22.680]  what they're doing alex is they're breaking us down
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:27.080]  bit by bit by bit and then they got the goon squads out there
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:32.200]  you go over that yellow line you go five miles over the limit
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:36.200]  you have two drinks and you're a fraction over the line
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:41.000]  you're treated like a criminal but the big guys get all the breaks
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:46.040]  it look at that guy elliott spitzer there is nothing more
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:50.440]  in your face arrogance he put him i mean for those that don't know he put a law
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:54.760]  in place to throw the bucket people that you know visit hookers
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:58.760]  and i'm not condoning it but i mean come on you know increasing the law on
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:02.440]  something nonviolent and consensual then he gets busted
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:07.240]  and now he gets a tv show exactly and then not only does he get busted
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:11.320]  have a tv show he spends thousands on hookers
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:17.400]  and he doesn't he's not prosecuted for the crime that he put in place
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:21.880]  there is you know the word justice means just us
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:27.000]  not them gerald we've only got about seven eight minutes left with you
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:31.640]  powerful intel today now there's so many issues to cover
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:35.400]  here but we know what tyranny is it's when control freaks get into power
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:39.960]  and go wild and they think they're invincible until they push it too far
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:44.680]  you say 2011 is off with their heads what else do you see trending that we
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:49.240]  haven't talked about coming up in 2011 into 2012
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:52.920]  some of the positive things but it's a negative side to it because what's
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:56.680]  going on is it's going to be a fortune in food
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:01.640]  there's there's going to be a strong demand for high quality foods
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:05.720]  eggs that you can really eat that don't come from Auschwitz farms
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:10.440]  these chicken coop concentration camps it's going to be a huge trend
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:15.400]  another one student revolts this is going to be big it's going on already
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:18.520]  you said that three years ago and it's now happening this year in
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:23.160]  california oh uh europe yeah throughout europe
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:29.480]  italy ireland england greece again figure spain they
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:34.920]  have an unemployment rate of 18 to 26 year olds and about 50 percent
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:38.440]  you think these guys are going to start taking to the streets and becoming
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:42.680]  involved in crime student revolts and cyber wars
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:47.960]  a big year for cyber wars and and by the way one of the other trends
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:51.800]  that we're writing about that you're on the forefront of
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:58.040]  is journalism 2.0 what you do what we do with the trends journal
[01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:03.320]  this is the new journalism that people are going to be tuned into
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:06.920]  rather than watching these shills and suck ups
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:13.800]  on these shows from mainstream media and the and now the the fight is going to
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:19.160]  be between closing down the internet as you keep pointing out
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:25.240]  or letting freedom ring so those and and this whole citizen journalism
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:30.600]  is going to be a huge trend because just as they're watching us
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:35.640]  now we're watching them people have their cell phone cameras
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:41.000]  people are taking videos and recording things that they never wanted exposed
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.120]  before oh that's key that's why they're pushing so much now
[01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:47.560]  in 9 000 locations to get us to spy on each other
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:52.200]  because they don't want us to start surveilling and watching and exposing
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:57.400]  them they want us all divide and conquer exactly and that's what the wiki
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:03.080]  leaks is about it's exposing them the emperors
[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:06.680]  have no clothes sarcozy
[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:12.600]  merkle burlesconi obama you go down the line all of
[01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:15.960]  those stands turk menistan grizzik stand
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:20.840]  usbekistan one stand criminal after another
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:24.200]  you read this stuff you can't make it up
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:28.920]  so that's the fight the fight is to stop exposing them
[01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:33.560]  and to put drag us into push us into submission
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:38.600]  we don't think it's going to happen and and and the major trend is going to be
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:43.560]  it's it's the wake-up call the revolution has begun
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:47.320]  oh by the way you're also going to hear a lot of chatter
[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:50.520]  for the end of the world a lot of that mayan prophecy
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:56.680]  armageddon stuff and guess what what's going to be going on in 2011
[01:51:56.680 --> 01:52:01.560]  is going to make it feel as though the world's going to come to a collapse
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:05.720]  in 2012 oh by the way there's those other little things
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:10.120]  the wars in korea they're not going to go away either
[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:14.600]  and believe me nobody's going to stop north korea
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:18.200]  if they keep pushing them they're going to bomb soul
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:23.640]  out of bolivian they're not that far away and they have the weapons to do it
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:27.800]  and watch your rod and as we're seeing with these wiki leaks
[01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:33.560]  another one the so-called un nuclear arms inspectors
[01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:39.160]  caught on tape being reported from the u.s. embassy
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:45.000]  that he's partial to the united states and he doesn't like the iranians
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.560]  oh yeah there's a fair deal for you well
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:52.920]  uh gerald we've only got about a minute left the websites are info wars dot com

[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:29.560]  everybody's having trouble uh delivering gold and especially silver
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:34.440]  right now gold hit a peak today of fourteen hundred and six ninety
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:37.720]  silver darn near breaking thirty dollars an ounce again
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:41.960]  twenty nine eighty three for the peak today it's been a very very actively
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:46.120]  trading day because the fed right now is uh announcing
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:50.040]  that they're going to increase this qe2 thing from six hundred billion
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:52.840]  billion to beyond i don't know where the number is going to come out
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:56.360]  but people in china right now are going into gold and silver because of it
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:00.760]  and and the same is true for korea now korea is looking at gold as one of the
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:05.800]  number one most best investments that uh anybody can get into in that country
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:11.880]  it's like the entire asian area the far east is just looking over to the west
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:15.960]  and scratching their heads wondering how in the world long
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:18.600]  can the federal reserve system do what it does here
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:24.280]  and why is the west taking this uh cannibalistic uh you know suicide pill
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:29.000]  it and it does it it baffles my mind too you're right about that alex people
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  really need to be getting into silver and there is no better way to get into
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.960]  silver than getting your three videos the obama deception end game

[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:53.400]  here in the united states twenty three times since nineteen sixty four i think
[01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:56.760]  there's a trend here and i'm and i'm pretty sure we're reaching the end of
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:59.800]  the trend because the united states dollar is doomed
[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:02.920]  everybody in the entire world is looking at the united states dollar

[02:01:55.400 --> 02:02:00.920]  the number three dot com and we'll or recap uh our guest also coming up the
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:05.160]  next segment uh but porter great to have you on with us today
[02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:10.200]  i'm happy to be here well i tell you uh break down your previous
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:13.800]  predictions for us and then let's get into what you're
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:18.760]  forecasting coming up this year next year well beginning in about 2005
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:21.960]  i became aware that there was an unsustainable amount of debt being
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:25.640]  created in our economy and the short answer is i just have
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:29.400]  followed that debt for the last five years it started of course in the
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:32.600]  mortgage market mostly uh there was other companies that were
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:35.400]  involved in that for example most people don't know that general motors was
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:39.400]  making all of its money for mortgages not for making cars so i just have
[02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:43.640]  followed the debt through this process as it went through fanny and freddy as it
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:49.080]  went through gm and now as it's ended up in the hands of the us treasury
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:54.360]  and then you predicted not just the collapse of the crisis you know some
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:57.480]  people were predicting that you know prominent minds out there
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:01.880]  you specifically picked what you thought was going to go down and boy you were
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:05.160]  right a to z well it really wasn't very difficult
[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:09.160]  unfortunately nobody likes to hear bad news but you know at one time
[02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:13.160]  general motors owed more than 400 billion dollars
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:16.680]  and they went more than 20 years without even being able to afford the
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:19.080]  interest so there were a lot of things that were
[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:22.280]  very very clear to any competent financial analyst
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:25.640]  unfortunately a lot of the incentives in the financial world
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:30.840]  uh don't provide any reason to for any people to say the truth about things
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:34.280]  wall street was making a lot of money by underwriting all of general motors
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:37.400]  bonds so they weren't going to be the people who spoke up in
[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:40.840]  places like wall street journal for example general motors is probably the
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:44.120]  largest newspaper advertiser in the country so no one's going to say anything
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:46.760]  either because they're making all their money from advertising
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:51.240]  we're one of the few people really they get paid only by the people who use our
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:53.640]  research we don't have any conflicts of interest so
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:58.200]  our only incentive is to provide actionable useful correct advice
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:02.840]  absolutely and folks can go watch your hour plus video breaking this down
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:07.000]  um and there's several sites they can go to but end of america three dot com
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.680]  but also there's just the main standsbury research site for folks that
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:13.960]  want to get the overview that's right yeah we have a
[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:17.240]  we have a web presence we we're not really a website company we just uh
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:20.680]  have a website where we serve content to our existing subscribers
[02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:23.800]  absolutely and and and boy you've got a lot of amazing
[02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:27.800]  subscribers invaluable invaluable information we're going to go to break
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:31.320]  here we have a long segment coming up porter and i want to give you the floor
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:36.040]  to walk through the previous predictions how it was in plain view why a lot of
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:39.720]  people have a stake in not letting folks know that
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:43.320]  we've now reached a point where the insiders are snatching and grabbing and
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:46.360]  stealing even faster because they know it's all coming down
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:49.720]  the big prediction you've got that you say is the biggest you've ever made
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:54.040]  that will dwarf the predictions you made four years ago ahead of 2008
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:05:01.240]  it's all coming up on the other side with our guest stay with us
[02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:04.760]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar
[02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:07.960]  power generator number one new climate legislation
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:11.480]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:15.240]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:18.040]  to have it's true total government control of
[02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:21.560]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:25.240]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:28.200]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:32.120]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:35.720]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:39.560]  from weather related outages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:43.080]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the

[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:50.840]  barons called his work a dire prophecy because going back to 2005 2006
[02:08:50.840 --> 02:08:56.360]  with precision he said gm's gonna go bankrupt fanny may
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:59.720]  freddy mac which they did the government came in and america's biggest mall

[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:09.560]  prediction yet and we're going to get him to talk about that main prediction
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:14.680]  and some of the other capillary connections to that but also his
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:18.200]  ideas on how to protect yourself and so a porter
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:22.040]  stansbury with stansbury and associates investment research private
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:25.160]  publishing company based in baltimore maryland formally of
[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:30.760]  course he was the first u.s. head in the long
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:34.280]  history of prior to launching stansbury and associates 11 years ago
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:37.400]  porter was the first american editor of the fleet street letter boy that's
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:41.080]  famous the oldest english language a financial newsletter
[02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:44.920]  so you've got the floor here sir let's walk through
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:49.240]  the real fundamentals why the pundits won't tell people the truth
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:52.920]  uh what the state that our economy really is the big prediction
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:56.280]  you've got coming up and how folks protect themselves
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:10:00.120]  well you know unfortunately it's very simple just a matter of math
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:03.320]  um over the last 30 years the united states went from being
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:06.680]  the world's largest creditor to becoming the world's largest debtor
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:09.800]  to becoming the world's largest debtor in history
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:13.400]  and the simple fact of the matter is far too many people corporations and our
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:16.280]  government itself can't afford those obligations
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:20.040]  and rather than writing them off and restructuring and fighting the bullet
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:23.480]  that all those obligations are now ending up on the books of the u.s.
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:26.760]  treasury and that is going to have catastrophic effects
[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:31.560]  for the value of the u.s. dollar going forward
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:35.480]  let's go through the technicals on that some stations just joined us recap
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:38.920]  some of the incredible predictions you've made the fundamentals and then
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:44.200]  walk through what we're facing well alex you know everyone is familiar by now
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:48.040]  with though with the mortgage crisis and the problem there was a bunch of people
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:51.960]  who didn't really have any credit were extended large amounts of credit
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:55.080]  and that had the effect of inflating the underlying collateral
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:58.120]  and then the whole thing burst like a house of cars in 2008
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:01.720]  now the finger pointing is all begun but the the important thing for
[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:05.240]  investors to realize is that all those debts have not gone away
[02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:08.040]  the government has continued to underwrite them through it's bailout of
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:11.560]  fanny and freddy and it's bailout of the banks and a lot of these obligations
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:15.240]  are now on the books of the federal reserve and the u.s. treasury
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:19.000]  the problem with us as a country is that our ability to print
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:24.120]  unlimited new amounts of money can solve a debt crisis like this but the only
[02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:27.400]  way it solves it is by greatly devaluing the value of that
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:31.000]  currency and my concern is going forward how
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.960]  people are going to be able to afford the resulting inflation
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:37.640]  and the terrible economic problems that could result from this coming
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:42.760]  inflationary problem well let's start i mean you've got the floor
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:46.040]  you're the expert you've predicted so much of what's unfolded break it down
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:49.640]  for us okay well let's start with a simple fact
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:53.240]  um if people are familiar with the terrible crisis probably that happened
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:56.760]  in iceland and the crisis is that have erupted in greece and spain and
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:12:00.120]  italy where these governments have simply gone bankrupt
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:02.840]  well the reason why those governments went bankrupt is because they had to
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:06.520]  bail out their banks that had made a bunch of bad loans to people who really
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:09.240]  couldn't repay them the exact same thing is happening in
[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:13.560]  united states the exact same thing in fact the total debt to gdp ratio in
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:17.400]  iceland was about 400 when the country collapsed
[02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:21.160]  and the u.s the total debt gdp ratio is the same number about 400
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:24.920]  percent we're just as bankrupt the only difference is
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:28.760]  that we have the power to print the world's reserve currency which is the
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:33.080]  u.s dollar and so as the fed goes ahead and prints more and
[02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:35.480]  more money and as the u.s treasury goes ahead and
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:39.560]  bails out more and more businesses the result of this is going to be a dramatic
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:42.520]  decrease in the purchasing power of the u.s dollar
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:46.120]  the impact of this is already being felt if you're in the commodity markets in
[02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:50.360]  any way shape any way shape or form you've already seen prices skyrocket for
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:53.960]  everything from you know corn to natural gas to oil to
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:57.800]  gold silver etc those big rises in price don't make any
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:01.000]  sense in an economy that's growing slowly as arts
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:06.440]  the problem is the money the money is being devalued
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:10.440]  and the governments know this i mean you see them increasing the police state
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:14.920]  forces you see them preparing for it you see the pentagon
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:18.520]  this year and last year the ministry of defense three years ago in england
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:23.400]  saying devaluations coming and we got to get ready to suppress the population
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:26.360]  but then they never blame the central banks that have basically allowed this
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:29.880]  to happen or this big welfare state that has fostered it
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:34.760]  so when we see these pundits up on tv or these treasury secretaries or fed
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:37.880]  secretaries currently if i'm wrong from your perspective
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:42.600]  they know full well the laws of economics that you're laying out here
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:45.800]  they're just bamboozling people why are they doing that
[02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:49.960]  well because it usually works i like to tell people that scarcity
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:53.640]  is the number one law of economics there could never be enough of anything to
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:58.280]  satisfy everyone that's why if you give something away like medicine for free
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:01.240]  demand is going to soar shortages are going to erupt there's going to be
[02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:04.600]  lines and usually problems everyone understands this about real life
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:08.760]  scarcity is an economic fact cannot be repealed by the government
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:12.600]  so but politics is all about patronage which means
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:16.280]  the way to get elected in politics is to promise everything to everyone
[02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:19.720]  well that's diametrically the opposite of what reality is all about right
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:22.040]  because the number one rule in economics is scarcity
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:26.120]  so how do you connect those two things how does it how does the politician
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:30.360]  create abundance there's only one way and it's with paper money
[02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:34.120]  paper money gives the politicians the flexibility they need
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:37.720]  to carry huge debts for a long amount of time the problem is
[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:41.720]  and and evidently sooner or later your creditors start wondering
[02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:45.160]  what's this paper really worth and the moment that happens the whole house
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:47.960]  to card can collapse it's happened time and time again
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:52.440]  all around the world and unfortunately it's happening right now in america
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:56.120]  and you know i try to explain this to your average yuppie and
[02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:59.880]  i love the american people i'm an american uh it's not just americans
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:03.880]  europeans are in somewhat of denial we've had it so good so long
[02:15:03.880 --> 02:15:06.680]  people can't believe that it could actually happen here but
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:10.760]  studying argentina or mexico or nigeria or zimbabwe or
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:14.360]  weimar republic germany perhaps porter you should go through a few examples of
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:18.760]  that i mean we know what happens with accelerated
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:23.320]  currency devaluation and then you add to that deindustrialization
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:26.920]  uh an aging population i mean it's a perfect storm
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:30.280]  back in the depression 90 of people right at 90
[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:34.120]  it's actually 89 point something if you look at the historians numbers
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:38.680]  on average during that 10-year period were agrarian were somewhat self-sufficient
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:42.920]  now it's 89 or 90 percent uh are living in the city
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:46.360]  don't know how to grow a tomato plant if their life depended on it
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:50.040]  if we have a great depression triggered by this we're talking about a road warrior
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:53.480]  type scenario in my view correct me if i'm wrong
[02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:57.640]  um you know it's very hard to forecast exactly what the outcome of this will be
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:00.200]  there are a couple of things about the situation today that are very very
[02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:04.200]  unusual though that make that make me very concerned the biggest one that i
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:07.480]  think people can understand pretty easily is there's never been a time in
[02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:12.760]  world history before where the global economy was reliant on paper currency
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:16.920]  that is very very very new it didn't it didn't it wasn't like that before 1971
[02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:20.760]  yeah we're a lot more domesticated now i mean people were still closer to the
[02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:23.480]  land it's like jamaica was thriving even though they were poor
[02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:27.080]  30 years ago but when they defaulted it's a hell hole now
[02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:30.440]  well there's lots of there's lots of things like that as you move from sound
[02:16:30.440 --> 02:16:34.120]  economy to paper economy there are lots of bad investments that get made
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:37.000]  and lots of good companies that end up going out of business that's definitely
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:40.440]  happening in united states but the big thing that i want to stress to
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:43.320]  everyone who's listening is that as america
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:46.280]  devalues it's going to be a global crisis
[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:50.840]  if around the world the dollar makes up more than 60 percent of the world's
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:53.560]  currency reserves that's other central banks it's other large
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:58.120]  commercial banks so as the dollar devalue it's going to have a much much bigger
[02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:01.640]  effect than say if just the the argentine peso devalues or
[02:17:01.640 --> 02:17:06.120]  you know the the italian leader it's causing a global devaluation
[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:11.800]  exactly and there will be a global run to hard assets and it's already begun
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:15.640]  you know if you look at the price of silver for example the low in silver
[02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:18.680]  was around seven dollars an ounce during the oa crisis
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:22.680]  silver recently touched 30 dollars there is no explanation for the move in
[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:26.600]  silver outside of a global move away from the
[02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:30.040]  dollar and that is absolutely happening it's happening right now
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:33.480]  and there's no one else who's going to tell you why it's happening how it's
[02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:37.640]  happening and what to do about it from your deep research and forecasting
[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:41.160]  skills porter where do you see silver and gold
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:45.240]  in the next year to two i mean if this devaluation
[02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:48.680]  and and and i want to get to the technicals of that starts to accelerate
[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:53.000]  where where will silver and gold be well maybe if we can't let's just go back
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:56.200]  to when i started writing about these problems in the mid-2000s
[02:17:56.200 --> 02:17:59.960]  05 and 06 at the time uh gold was you know around 500
[02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:03.560]  dollars an ounce and i was saying that it would definitely go to at least two
[02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:06.280]  thousand dollars an ounce and believe me alex
[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:09.560]  everyone thought oh he's got to be a front for some bullion dealer he's out
[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:13.160]  of his mind gold can't quadruple that's insane
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:16.040]  well you know now it's at fourteen hundred dollars and two thousand dollars
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:20.040]  seems likely to to most mainstream economists well let me be clear i am
[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:23.800]  hooked up with a bullion dealer and i promote it because i believe in it
[02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:26.920]  because i know in history you start devaluing currency
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:31.640]  metals of any commodity generally go up the fastest because the the metal hadn't
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:35.160]  gone up the the value of the papers gone down
[02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:38.520]  right and let me just be clear i mean we're i'm a subscription business so if
[02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:41.240]  i'm wrong about my advice i lose my subscribers
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:45.560]  you know there there's not you know uh for me it's it's same here if i'm wrong
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:50.520]  i lose my listeners every exactly so so what i i want what i'm about to say
[02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:53.400]  next i think is going to be a little shocking but i wanted to preference it
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:57.320]  by saying i wasn't calling for gold at ten thousand dollars an ounce five years
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:00.200]  ago what's happened is that the amount of
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:03.400]  paper that has been created has greatly increased
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:06.680]  so whereas i thought it would take two thousand dollar gold to balance the
[02:19:06.680 --> 02:19:09.240]  market five years ago i now think it will take ten thousand
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:12.200]  dollar gold and i don't make that number up out of thin air
[02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:15.400]  if you look at the amount of money that exists now there's a form of money
[02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:19.480]  called money of zero maturity it's basically every digital receipt that's
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:22.360]  out there that is a demand payment so you walk
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:25.400]  into a bank you say i want my money right now and you're saving the kind of
[02:19:25.400 --> 02:19:27.800]  checking account that's money of zero maturity
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:31.080]  if you look at how much money it would take to back that with gold
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:35.160]  not at a hundred percent but at ten percent at twenty five percent
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:38.360]  you start looking at what what the price of gold would have to be for that to
[02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:41.960]  balance out and you get ten thousand dollars an ounce of gold
[02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:46.040]  unbelievable let's break down the technicals on that on the other side

[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:13.880]  information that you guys offer and tell us about your research team
[02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:17.960]  well you know i've been really fortunate alex uh when i got started i
[02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:21.560]  founded my own company eleven years ago and i had a lot of good content contacts
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:25.800]  in the industry and uh i told everyone you know i have a dream
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:28.840]  i have a new business model where we're not going to take advertising revenue
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:31.480]  we're only going to take subscription revenue i'm never going to have you're
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:33.480]  never going to have to write something you don't believe it you're not going to
[02:25:33.480 --> 02:25:36.360]  have to tout a stock because you have a banking deal with it
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:38.840]  you're going to get rid of all those complex ventures going to run a really
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:43.240]  straight simple business and believe it or not just just making that stand i
[02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:46.760]  was able to attract a tremendous amount of very experienced people with a lot
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:50.200]  of talent and so you know people who really care about
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:53.560]  doing financial research have come to come to our business
[02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:57.240]  you know one of our analysts for example uh had a very large brokerage firm
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:00.920]  that he started himself and he ran it for 20 years and made a lot of money and
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:03.400]  you know wanted to get out of the business of holding clients hands but
[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:05.880]  still wanted to be active in the marketplace to want to have his
[02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:09.160]  opinions out there so i have a lot of people that come to me with a lot of
[02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:12.600]  experience and a lot of expertise that are just looking for a very honest
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:15.560]  publisher who isn't going to make them write things
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:18.840]  that they don't believe and so we've got a big team of people
[02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:22.040]  we've got you know more than 20 analysts and we cover a lot of markets we have a
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:25.000]  lot of different kind of products i don't want to go into a pitch with you
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:28.120]  because the point is if you've got if you've got
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:31.480]  20 or 30 super competent very experienced people working on your
[02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:34.120]  behalf of the financial markets for a very reasonable price
[02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:37.400]  you're going to do a lot better than otherwise and i would challenge anybody
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:40.120]  to read our newsletters and to compare it to whatever they've been getting from
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:43.400]  their brokers or for their racial fund managers and see the difference
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:47.640]  well i know that uh so many publications i trust just say that your
[02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:51.240]  information is spot on and we're just honored to have you uh
[02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:54.440]  here on the radio with us at porter stanbury is our guest
[02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:57.960]  this segment's almost over a long segment coming up but porter
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:02.760]  you got interrupted by the break get into the the mathematics uh you know the
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:07.560]  the economic facts that make you now not look at two thousand dollar
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:11.160]  an ounce gold like you predicted you know five six years ago but now ten
[02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:14.360]  thousand dollar an ounce gold well it's just
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:17.720]  unfortunately it's just a simple uh mathematics uh
[02:27:17.720 --> 02:27:21.240]  you know you can you can know that uh when money was
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:24.680]  sound and banking was more sound in the past it was
[02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:28.760]  it was normal for countries to back their currencies with precious metals
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:32.280]  you know uh let's say a 10 backing of the currency and gold
[02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:35.480]  you know uh there are of course our economists and i would be among them who
[02:27:35.480 --> 02:27:38.520]  say you should run a hundred percent gold standard currency that's the only
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:41.640]  legitimate way to do it but regardless of all that i'm not talking
[02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:45.080]  about you know the philosophy of it i mean how it was actually practiced
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:48.760]  10% reserve gold back currency if you look at the amount of money that's been
[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:52.920]  created over the last five years to accomplish a 10%
[02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:56.200]  gold back currency the price of gold would have to be around
[02:27:56.200 --> 02:28:00.040]  ten thousand dollars an ounce measuring money of zero maturity which is
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:04.360]  demand deposits basically any kind of digital receipt you can get overnight
[02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:09.160]  you need about uh you need enough gold to uh to back it 10% with gold would have
[02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:12.680]  to be 10 thousand dollars an ounce that assumes you know that the amount of
[02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:15.800]  gold in circulation isn't going to change dramatically overnight and we
[02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:18.920]  know that it can't it's very difficult to increase the supply of gold
[02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:22.840]  it only increases about one percent a year even with all the money that's going
[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:25.640]  so you can just you can just do the math and you can figure out what the price of
[02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:29.880]  gold would have to be to back the currency at that level
[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:34.360]  well i remember uh reading some of your material four five years ago talking
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:37.880]  about 2000 and i i mean you can see the basic fundamental
[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:40.840]  mathematics as you say and then seeing many other analysts
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:44.200]  who were being truthful said the same thing and we got called lunatics but
[02:28:44.200 --> 02:28:47.720]  i mean this is not rocket science as you keep saying that's what's so frustrating
[02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:51.160]  it's that the mainstream media has a stake in lying to people
[02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:55.240]  but now the population is beginning to not buy their propaganda
[02:28:55.240 --> 02:28:59.000]  it's like 60 minutes it meets the national unemployment's above 20%
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:02.200]  even 60 minutes admits it but the but the government
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:09.400]  and the president says it's 9.8 porter yeah yeah i know um you know uh i i'm
[02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:12.760]  i've i've really enjoyed watching uh general electric because uh you know
[02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:17.000]  general electric owns cnpc they're a massive media company
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.520]  and uh people that i know like to call them the for-profit wing of the obama
[02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:24.760]  administration and if you look at g's balance sheet
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:29.640]  it's it's a nightmare the the company currently owes more than 650 billion
[02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:32.200]  dollars or stay there i don't want to interrupt you

[02:29:39.800 --> 02:29:44.120]  this accelerated dollar devaluation uh and why it's one of the biggest things
[02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:47.560]  in modern history to take place and and when you think it's going to happen in

[02:32:04.040 --> 02:32:08.040]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:11.800]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:32:11.800 --> 02:32:15.400]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:32:15.400 --> 02:32:19.640]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:32:19.640 --> 02:32:23.240]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:32:23.240 --> 02:32:27.720]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:32:27.720 --> 02:32:31.560]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:34.760]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:32:34.760 --> 02:32:38.680]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[02:33:23.400 --> 02:33:30.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:34.760]  these powerful mega central banks create the thousands of
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:39.480]  trillions of dollars in derivatives crud they get the populations dependent
[02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:43.320]  they get incredible power on the way up on the way down they hold you hostage
[02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:46.680]  in demand to bailouts i want to talk about how we
[02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:49.880]  individually protect ourselves in porter stanbury's
[02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:54.760]  very highly researched and educated view but also
[02:33:54.760 --> 02:33:58.520]  again to make precise you know daily predictions are impossible but
[02:33:58.520 --> 02:34:03.320]  generally why he stuck his neck out to say 2011 is the year
[02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:06.920]  for the dollar implosion as the world reserve
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:10.120]  currency so i want you to get into that next porter
[02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:14.120]  and again the website's endofamerica3.com
[02:34:14.120 --> 02:34:17.400]  barons has called his previous predictions a dire prophecy because they
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:21.400]  came true he predicted years before it happened that gm would go bankrupt
[02:34:21.400 --> 02:34:24.680]  fanny may freddy mac and america's biggest mall in her general growth
[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:28.680]  properties and others and now he's making a much more
[02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:32.760]  you know larger prediction of just and since he's been making this
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:35.800]  prediction you see it accelerating towards it but finishing up with your
[02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:40.600]  general electric analysis
[02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:43.960]  well you know general electric is a great example of the problems of the
[02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:47.800]  country uh for the last 10 years i was talking a lot of general motors which i
[02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:49.640]  thought exemplified these problems because they were
[02:34:49.640 --> 02:34:52.760]  they were general motors was a very big player in the mortgage market
[02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:56.040]  especially the prime mortgage market when it comes to g
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:34:59.560]  e uh i think they're a great example of the overall problems of the economy
[02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:03.240]  which is essentially this business model is vastly over leveraged
[02:35:03.240 --> 02:35:07.080]  so if you look at their balance sheet you know they owe more than 600
[02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:11.000]  billion dollars they're spending about 20 billion dollars a year right now on
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:14.680]  interest that's eating up you know a vast majority of their
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:19.800]  cash flow and if interest rates go up they will not be able to afford the
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:23.640]  interest on those debts frankly general electric should have gone bankrupt
[02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:26.840]  back in 2008 the only reason why they didn't was because the government
[02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:31.400]  guaranteed all of their debts that guarantee is going to expire in 2011
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:34.200]  it's going to be very interesting to see whether or not general electric can
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:37.080]  afford the increasing cost of maintaining that amount of
[02:35:37.080 --> 02:35:40.280]  debt the same general problem is happening across
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:43.320]  the economy and the same general problem is bound to happen sooner or
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:46.920]  later to the u.s government itself uh you remember uh
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:52.840]  geithner said that america would never never ever lose this triple a rating
[02:35:52.840 --> 02:35:55.640]  i bet within 12 months that is no longer the case
[02:35:55.640 --> 02:35:59.320]  well the chinese british firms european firms
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:02.840]  have been delisting the triple a rating in the last three months
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:06.280]  yeah it was uh it was uh listening to geithner say that was uh the equivalent
[02:36:06.280 --> 02:36:10.040]  of listening to you know the brazil the brazilian finance minister 20 years
[02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:12.520]  ago saying that the real would not be devalued
[02:36:12.520 --> 02:36:15.800]  as soon as you heard him say it you knew it was exactly what was going to happen
[02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:18.680]  the next day and i know currency traders have made a lot of money just
[02:36:18.680 --> 02:36:22.120]  listening for uh treasury seekers to say such foolish things
[02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:25.240]  the problem now is that it's our treasury secretary
[02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:29.080]  it's our currency and not only that our currency is the world's currency so this
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:32.920]  is going to be a much larger problem than just a simple devaluation of an
[02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:36.280]  emerging market well remember geithner earlier
[02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:39.560]  this year told the chinese economic students that
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:43.320]  we're not going to devalue the dollar they knew that the the united states was
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:47.400]  devaluing it globally at the time so they laughed at him
[02:36:47.400 --> 02:36:52.760]  yeah exactly yeah i mean
[02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:56.440]  it's what you know alex the thing that boggles my mind about all this is if you
[02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:59.080]  if you listen to the video and i know you have
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:04.280]  um just find something in there that isn't actually a fact or isn't actually
[02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:07.400]  just logic if general electric can't afford to
[02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:11.640]  maintain a six hundred billion dollar debt it will have to go bankrupt
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:15.240]  that's really bad news for our economy and i wish it wasn't true
[02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:18.200]  but guess what everyone has access to general electric's balance sheet at the
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:20.920]  public company you can go look at the numbers yourself
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:25.080]  and explain to me how a company that's one of the largest in the united states
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:29.000]  one of the largest in the world explain to me how that company can operate in
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.640]  a way that's effective if the government of the united
[02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:38.280]  states has to guarantee its debt doesn't anyone see that this is a problem
[02:37:38.280 --> 02:37:42.680]  well let's talk about it from this angle how do you see it unraveling
[02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:46.520]  um what do you see government's response to it
[02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:51.960]  being and uh obviously we can try to protect ourselves individually if we
[02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:54.360]  see it ahead of the curve and that's what your
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:58.280]  video deals with at end of america the number three dot com
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:02.120]  again that's end of america the number three dot com uh porter but
[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:05.320]  i mean that's a lot of questions there but just basically how do you see it
[02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:08.520]  unraveling it's already beginning to do it and accelerate that
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:11.080]  what will government's response be from what we've seen them do around the
[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:14.120]  world what can we do individually and is there any
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:19.080]  way to stop this on the you know large scale
[02:38:19.080 --> 02:38:23.080]  uh you know alex i the second question i think is uh is more interesting
[02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:27.320]  because the fact of the matter is um it's already has already unraveling and
[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:30.200]  the way to protect yourself is is really pretty simple i go into details
[02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:33.000]  of the video but it's real simple you want to own
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:36.680]  uh energy agriculture it's found money so you want to own
[02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:40.680]  you know um uh farm would be great uh or the equivalent there's a lot of
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:43.240]  publicly listed farms you can buy the stock of a farm
[02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:46.760]  you want to own energy that mostly means oil and you want to own sound money and
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:50.360]  that mostly means uh gold and silver the how-to stuff is
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:53.960]  actually pretty simple uh unfortunately my my experience has
[02:38:53.960 --> 02:38:57.640]  been people won't take simple steps to protect themselves because
[02:38:57.640 --> 02:39:01.400]  they can't imagine the future changing as much as it's going to
[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:05.560]  i mean you have to imagine you have no idea how many times i got ridiculed
[02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:08.600]  you know heckled at investment conferences when i warned
[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:12.120]  that uh you know fanny and freddy's uh balance sheet was unsustainable
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:15.160]  and it was the numbers were clear to everybody but no one could imagine a
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:18.840]  world where fanny and freddy became um you know uh
[02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:22.680]  bankruptcy that's exactly what happened uh the the the second question is is
[02:39:22.680 --> 02:39:25.480]  there a way to stop it and the answer is of course there is
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:28.920]  but the alternatives to stopping it are very painful so
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:32.040]  we have two choices we can either we can either admit
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:35.320]  the problem and we can force our creditors to take a haircut and that
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:38.840]  means essentially a form of bankruptcy and restructuring that would be very
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:41.560]  painful to our economy there's no doubt about it
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:45.560]  or we can risk a hyperinflation by printing more money
[02:39:45.560 --> 02:39:50.680]  and allowing deadbeat borrowers to escape uh with uh with a devalued currency
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:54.120]  and the the number two choice the devaluation is the political choice
[02:39:54.120 --> 02:39:57.560]  because the the politicians will blame higher prices on entrepreneurs and
[02:39:57.560 --> 02:40:01.240]  businessmen they won't accept the blame and they will
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:05.160]  loot within the hyperinflation because they get the money first
[02:40:05.160 --> 02:40:09.160]  we need to go with the haircut and write off most of these debts that the bank's
[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:11.160]  credit is derivatives do you agree with that statement
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:14.200]  it's real simple if you if you if you go with the restructuring the people who
[02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:18.120]  made the bad loans they pay the price yes okay if you don't it's going to be
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:20.760]  the it's going to be the people who have who have been um
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:24.840]  uh have had an integrity and have lived with discipline that's right i i bet on
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:29.080]  golden silver i bet on a farm i've got a family farm
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:34.200]  i bet on that 12 years ago i've been right i shouldn't have to pay all these
[02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:40.520]  international bankers uh by destroying uh you know my currency and my future
[02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:43.560]  you're exactly right and guess what you're not going to get that choice
[02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:46.680]  because believe me they're going to make you pay through the nose they're going
[02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:50.920]  to make you pay in ways you haven't even imagined yet
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:55.560]  they're now announcing uh rainwater taxes traveling transponders in all
[02:40:55.560 --> 02:41:00.360]  cars uh national sales taxes vat's carbon taxes what are
[02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:02.200]  some of the other ways they're going to rape us
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:04.840]  well the the big thing that they're going to do and it's already on the books
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:09.160]  it takes effect january 1st 2013 is they're going to put a withholding tax
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:12.440]  on all money transfers that leave the united states
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:16.040]  so they're going to make you pay a 30 percent withholding tax to move money
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:19.080]  to a bank outside the country and if you want your money back
[02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:23.160]  you have to file a claim a tax return that shows that that money is not owed to
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:26.280]  the government
[02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:30.120]  incredible it's incredible and uh you know the only way to the only way really
[02:41:30.120 --> 02:41:34.280]  to even begin to pay for our debts is uh some kind of a massive wealth tax
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:37.320]  so they're they're gonna you know they're already making you record if you buy
[02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:40.120]  gold or silver they're gonna have that information somewhere they're setting
[02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:43.000]  they're setting up to have the ability to tax not just your income but your
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:46.600]  after your assets but people are already revolting
[02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:50.200]  i don't see them getting away with this no matter how many neighborhood snitches
[02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:53.800]  they've got and no matter how much you know brainwashing i i don't think
[02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:57.080]  people are going to put up with it i hope you're right alex but i i don't
[02:41:57.080 --> 02:42:00.600]  think so i i mean i mean it'll be it'll be interesting to see what happens but
[02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:05.240]  you know you don't have to catch everybody to terrorize the whole country
[02:42:06.360 --> 02:42:09.400]  oh look there's no doubt when they got rid of glass steagle
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:13.080]  eleven years ago they accelerated setting up the snitch networks and the
[02:42:13.080 --> 02:42:17.400]  oppression i mean they premeditated this whole thing and it's so
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:22.840]  diabolical well i you know i i don't know how organized they are in that
[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:26.520]  regard but certainly if you look at the incentives that they have been setting
[02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:31.080]  up you know that they have been structuring our economy to benefit the
[02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:34.760]  largest corporations in the government itself and there is no doubt in my
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:39.800]  mind that that's going to continue it's outrageous and now they're trying to
[02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:43.880]  pass laws to restrict family farms and
[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:46.920]  you know trucking your own vegetables into town and selling them i mean this
[02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:51.240]  is becoming the soviet union how do you as you said it's already
[02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:55.160]  really starting to move faster and faster it's already rolling
[02:42:55.160 --> 02:42:58.840]  but when do you and i know you're not making an exact prediction here but
[02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:04.360]  when do you see the real danger zones uh in the united states and worldwide for
[02:43:04.360 --> 02:43:07.560]  the final meltdown we already see the chinese and russians
[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:11.080]  two weeks ago announcing hey we're not going to trade with each other in
[02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:14.760]  dollars anymore we see the arabs moving that way we see
[02:43:14.760 --> 02:43:18.680]  worldwide people not wanting dollars so we already see the green back going
[02:43:18.680 --> 02:43:21.560]  from king uh to being you know almost like some
[02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:24.920]  type of toxic waste so how do you see that move towards the exit
[02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:29.240]  accelerating and will it be like other devaluations that
[02:43:29.240 --> 02:43:33.080]  where people inside mexico don't really know how devalued their dollar is or
[02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:36.360]  their peso until they leave the country or will this be
[02:43:36.360 --> 02:43:40.360]  different because it's the first global devaluation because it was all pegged
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:43.640]  of the dollar and what will that cause worldwide
[02:43:43.640 --> 02:43:48.280]  well you know the the question i would ask you and return as people ask me
[02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:51.080]  as well you know when is it all going to start when the the question i had
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:55.400]  asked you in return is what's it going to take for you notice it's happening
[02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:59.720]  how big does america's annual budget deficit has to get before you begin to
[02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:02.840]  question the sovereignty of the government how much total debt can the
[02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:05.400]  economy hold before you begin to question whether or not it can be
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:09.160]  repaid how high did the price of gold and silver have to go before you realize
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:12.600]  that something is already happening how many new rules and restrictions on
[02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:16.520]  trade and capital and finance will have to be implemented before you finally
[02:44:16.520 --> 02:44:19.400]  realize that you're screwed
[02:44:20.120 --> 02:44:24.520]  yeah savers tend to just stick their money in an account and wait for
[02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:27.240]  something to happen and then they can incrementally be
[02:44:27.240 --> 02:44:30.520]  be fleeced well i've got all these mainstream news articles port and i've
[02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:33.080]  been pointing this out for years now even glenn becker's doing it
[02:44:33.080 --> 02:44:38.280]  that last week the military now admits they're preparing to suppress
[02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:42.200]  uprisings and they have role players that scream i'm an american no no not the
[02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:46.280]  camp they're already practicing taking over farms and nationalizing them
[02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:50.200]  they're already acclimating everyone and suddenly there's like checkpoints with
[02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:55.160]  cops and weird rvs with american flags flying with cops with cameras
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:58.760]  they're putting telescreens in 9 000 retail stores
[02:44:58.760 --> 02:45:02.280]  with homeland security saying watch your neighbor and i have the homeland security
[02:45:02.280 --> 02:45:06.600]  press release right here it's it's like they're trying to recreate
[02:45:06.600 --> 02:45:11.000]  the fictional 1984 so clearly the government
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:16.760]  knows what it's done and so there's no doubt i mean there's literally
[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:20.200]  they're just acclimating us to a soft form of martial law
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:23.720]  with troops and paramilitary just scurrying around everywhere
[02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:27.320]  getting ready and i guess the troops in military have been brainwashed they're
[02:45:27.320 --> 02:45:30.200]  going to go along with the total takedown of the republic
[02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:35.400]  from first world to third world well i i think that you said it all when you
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:38.760]  when you when you first said the words homeland security i mean well since when
[02:45:38.760 --> 02:45:42.280]  was america an empire that needed homeland security
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:47.000]  i mean what what what where are we living and uh
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:50.520]  you know this these processes have gone for a long time the country's been
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:54.840]  going this way for a very very long time and i can't tell you
[02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:58.280]  about the social aspects of it and i'm not really an expert in regards to the
[02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:01.480]  political aspects of it but i am very very
[02:46:01.480 --> 02:46:05.640]  confident that my analysis in regards to the economics of it is right
[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:08.840]  you can you can make all the laws and pass all the things that you want this
[02:46:08.840 --> 02:46:12.040]  these people and you can fool them with advertising and get them to vote for
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:15.320]  almost anything i mean people are completely cheap
[02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:21.480]  but you can't pay for it because socialism will bankrupt you yes
[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:24.920]  that's just a fact of life that's what ron paul has said is that they're going
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:27.800]  to take over we're going to have a police state but it's going to bankrupt
[02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:31.080]  like the soviet union but now in this high tech age
[02:46:31.080 --> 02:46:35.160]  everything is accelerated and so it won't take 50 years for the american
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:38.840]  empire the american soviet to fall it'll take three four years do you agree
[02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:43.000]  with that well we're all i mean we're we are already so
[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:46.840]  far and that it's unbelievable i mean most americans don't really understand
[02:46:46.840 --> 02:46:51.640]  what these numbers mean but you know our um uh our budget deficits are
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:54.840]  completely totally out of control and unsustainable
[02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:58.680]  and they're having a massive impact already on the value of our currency
[02:46:58.680 --> 02:47:02.680]  and there is no consensus on either republicans or the democratic sides to
[02:47:02.680 --> 02:47:06.440]  merely pay for our existing government forget about beginning to pay for the
[02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:09.960]  largest debts ever accumulated in the history of mankind
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:16.280]  so this is not going to last very long i can assure you of that
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:20.680]  so you're talking about total implosion this next year
[02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:26.680]  uh i i alex i i as i would say to you we're already in total implosion no i
[02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:29.800]  agree with you but i mean when when when when
[02:47:29.800 --> 02:47:34.360]  trains stop running on time when gas doesn't come out into your stove i mean
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:36.920]  that's what they've done in every other country that they've
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:39.880]  fleeced like this they suck it dry like a vampire
[02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:44.680]  you know sucks a you know sucks a fat lady down and just a to a pile of ash
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:47.480]  uh specific alex what's the difference between
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:50.520]  what's the difference what's the difference between an a commodity that's
[02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:53.720]  not available and a commodity is not affordable
[02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:57.000]  you're telling me that the american people standard of living hasn't dropped
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.280]  precipitously in the last two years no i mean the word is accelerating
[02:48:00.280 --> 02:48:02.680]  accelerating accelerating it's going to hell in a hand basket
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:06.120]  all right i mean so you're every single day you're getting poorer but they're
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:10.040]  doing it in a way that is simply diabolical instead of
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:13.240]  instead of honestly defaulting and making companies restructure
[02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:16.840]  which would certainly lead to a lot of short-term very painful problems
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:20.360]  they're doing it in a way where everyone seems to think everything's fine
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:24.120]  but meanwhile the entire foundation of our society is being pulled out from
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:27.160]  underneath us and you're going to wake up in six months time and you're going to
[02:48:27.160 --> 02:48:34.200]  go what the heck i'm 50 poor but i but my salary is larger
[02:48:34.200 --> 02:48:39.320]  unbelievable and this is the formula this is the formula that they have used
[02:48:39.320 --> 02:48:42.520]  over and over again but there does come a time
[02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:45.960]  when the world really completely dumps the dollar
[02:48:45.960 --> 02:48:53.000]  and then we do see times where you know there are new quote crises
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:56.520]  what type of crises do you see mixed into the stew
[02:48:56.520 --> 02:49:00.680]  well look like i said this is long this is already begun
[02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:04.360]  last year 2009 was the first year since 1971
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:08.360]  the central banks were a net buyer of gold our trading partners are already
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:11.720]  abandoning the dollar they're fleeing into gold there's no doubt about it
[02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:15.960]  chinese are selling treasury bonds that's going to continue for a very very long time
[02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:20.440]  so the next big thing i would look for is to see either brazil or china make a
[02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:24.040]  very large acquisition of gold probably from the imf
[02:49:24.040 --> 02:49:26.760]  so that's the one thing you're going to see the next thing you're going to see
[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:31.560]  is you're going to see more and more u.s underwriting of big bailouts in europe
[02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:35.000]  we just got finished with the irish bailout the spanish bailout
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:38.360]  and the italian bailout is next and it's going to be even bigger so you're
[02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:42.120]  going to see the fed underwrite underwrite two three trillion dollars
[02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:45.560]  of bailouts for europe this year pretty soon people are going to start asking
[02:49:45.560 --> 02:49:48.520]  wait a minute where's all that money coming from how could the americans be
[02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:51.400]  paying to bail out the europeans when the americans are even more broke than the
[02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:54.040]  europeans
[02:49:54.040 --> 02:49:57.240]  and so we're going to be the last domino to fall or
[02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:01.320]  there's no telling it's russian roulette no i'm saying something different
[02:50:01.320 --> 02:50:04.200]  i'm saying that the dominos are already falling
[02:50:04.200 --> 02:50:08.760]  they're falling in a way that's designed for most people not to notice no no i
[02:50:08.760 --> 02:50:11.880]  agree as the g20 said last year it's coordinated
[02:50:11.880 --> 02:50:15.640]  devaluation but but but i mean i know the
[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:19.240]  dominos have fallen over and over again but it's like cask it's like dominos
[02:50:19.240 --> 02:50:22.760]  going down a staircase we're going deeper and deeper and deeper
[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:26.440]  okay here's a better way to say it when do we hit rock bottom
[02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:31.560]  we hit rock bottom when the u.s treasury cannot conduct an auction
[02:50:31.560 --> 02:50:34.840]  when there are no buyers for treasury bonds and believe me no one believes
[02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:37.720]  that it's going to happen but it'll absolutely positively happen and it's
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:40.280]  going to happen a lot through than anybody expects well the feds already
[02:50:40.280 --> 02:50:44.280]  been having to start to expand its monetization and buy treasuries
[02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:47.400]  that's right there are the people who are buying all this supply unbelievable
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:50.600]  porter stanbury is our guest we're going to come back and get into that
[02:50:50.600 --> 02:50:53.480]  and then also tell you how to hopefully protect yourself they got a lot of key

[02:53:12.760 --> 02:53:15.560]  washed away but that when wastes were allowed to accumulate
[02:53:15.560 --> 02:53:18.360]  in and around the cell the cell would age and then die

[02:54:52.520 --> 02:54:56.520]  well let me just a whole bunch of special guests uh with watson poll watson
[02:54:56.520 --> 02:55:01.880]  next week live here as well finishing up with hitting rock bottom and
[02:55:01.880 --> 02:55:05.720]  why you have the term end of america i mean
[02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:09.640]  when you say end of america what do you mean by that well i i i want to be
[02:55:09.640 --> 02:55:13.960]  clear about that um um what i mean by end of america is america
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:18.280]  losing the special position it has had globally since world war two
[02:55:18.280 --> 02:55:22.920]  of having the world's reserve currency it's an enormous advantage to us
[02:55:22.920 --> 02:55:26.920]  it's enabled us actually unfortunately to build these enormous debts
[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:29.720]  there's no way creditors would have allowed us to do that if we couldn't
[02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:33.000]  print the world's the world's reserve currency to service those debts
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:36.200]  so we're the only nation in the world that can buy
[02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:39.720]  anything around the world in our own currency everybody else has to buy
[02:55:39.720 --> 02:55:43.320]  dollars before they could buy oil or buy dollars before they can buy corn or
[02:55:43.320 --> 02:55:45.480]  buy dollars before they can buy a company in another
[02:55:45.480 --> 02:55:49.800]  country or real estate or whatever so we pay 80 bucks for a barrel of crude and
[02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:53.560]  the germans pay 200 well the germans have to buy
[02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:56.600]  dollars before they can buy crude from a foreign source
[02:55:56.600 --> 02:55:59.560]  and that means their government has invested interest in making sure their
[02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:03.640]  currency remains sound otherwise the people are going to notice
[02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:07.080]  our country's politicians have the great luxury of having the world's reserve
[02:56:07.080 --> 02:56:10.360]  currency and that means that they can they can they can run
[02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:14.280]  enormous uh fiscal and current account deficits for years and years and years
[02:56:14.280 --> 02:56:17.720]  and years without any repercussion and of course that's what they've done
[02:56:17.720 --> 02:56:22.280]  so now we're stuck with this big dilemma where all the consequences of our bad
[02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:25.640]  economic behavior for the last 30 years are going to come to a crisis
[02:56:25.640 --> 02:56:29.960]  instead of being something that we noticed along the way
[02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:33.960]  well it is moving quicker and quicker so
[02:56:33.960 --> 02:56:37.880]  uh when do we hit bottoming i mean obviously i agree with you the dollar
[02:56:37.880 --> 02:56:41.240]  devaluation is on the dominoes are falling now and many have already
[02:56:41.240 --> 02:56:46.280]  fallen but uh when we hit bottom and and and
[02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:50.200]  instead of only 20 percent or so the treasury's not being bought at auction
[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:53.800]  we you know when 90 percent aren't being bought what does that do just
[02:56:53.800 --> 02:56:59.560]  hyperinflation i mean uh what happens yeah i i mean uh this again i know
[02:56:59.560 --> 02:57:02.520]  this sounds sort of implausible but i would just beg you to look at the
[02:57:02.520 --> 02:57:05.800]  numbers total domestic u.s savings are around 600
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:09.400]  billion dollars right now okay annual federal deficit
[02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:12.840]  is 1.2 billion dollars what's the difference between how much we can
[02:57:12.840 --> 02:57:16.120]  save and how much our government is spending the difference is 600 billion
[02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:18.840]  dollars so let me ask you alex guess how much
[02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:22.680]  money the federal reserve just agreed to print over the next six months
[02:57:22.680 --> 02:57:26.600]  take a wild guess it's 600 billion dollars
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:30.120]  you know give the crackerjack a word to alex so we're already at the point
[02:57:30.120 --> 02:57:33.800]  where the federal reserve is literally printing all the money that we need to
[02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:37.560]  maintain our our our annual fiscal deficits
[02:57:37.560 --> 02:57:42.200]  that is absolutely positively banana republic finance and it has enormous
[02:57:42.200 --> 02:57:44.920]  consequences for our country going forward
[02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:48.360]  and there is no one in the mainstream media at all who is giving an adequate
[02:57:48.360 --> 02:57:51.880]  warning about what this really means and all the really rich people i know are
[02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:56.280]  leaving the united states they're now um in fact well i'm not going to get into
[02:57:56.280 --> 02:57:59.880]  it but i mean they're leaving this year because they know the new rules are going
[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:04.440]  in where you can't get your money out uh so roaches get in the roaches don't get
[02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:07.240]  out i mean this is really authoritarian i believe
[02:58:07.240 --> 02:58:10.520]  politically we're going to be able to beat it with ron paul and rand paul and
[02:58:10.520 --> 02:58:14.920]  others but it's going to be a hard road i know there's nowhere to run long term
[02:58:14.920 --> 02:58:18.920]  so we're choosing to go down with the ss titanic if you want to call us in the
[02:58:18.920 --> 02:58:22.680]  next hour and have questions specifically for our guests of
[02:58:22.680 --> 02:58:29.720]  porter standsbury of end of america 3.com 1-800-259-9231
[02:58:29.720 --> 02:58:35.880]  1-800-259-9231 specific short questions or comments
[02:58:35.880 --> 02:58:43.240]  for our guests open phones right now we're going to overdrive stay with us
[02:58:43.240 --> 02:58:53.000]  thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today
[02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:57.000]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[02:58:57.000 --> 02:59:00.200]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[02:59:00.200 --> 02:59:04.200]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[02:59:04.200 --> 02:59:07.400]  americans at home i have tremendous influence
[02:59:07.400 --> 02:59:11.400]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[02:59:11.400 --> 02:59:16.680]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:59:16.680 --> 02:59:19.880]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[02:59:19.880 --> 02:59:24.280]  the criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:59:24.280 --> 02:59:26.840]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[02:59:26.840 --> 02:59:30.600]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists they're asking for more matches
[02:59:30.600 --> 02:59:33.160]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[02:59:33.160 --> 02:59:37.480]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc
[02:59:37.480 --> 02:59:42.520]  we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic

[02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:19.080]  network network
[03:00:19.080 --> 03:00:23.640]  order stands very is our guest end of america three dot com
[03:00:23.640 --> 03:00:27.720]  is the url to see their free hour-long uh video that
[03:00:27.720 --> 03:00:32.120]  i have to unfortunately concur with i wish this wasn't true
[03:00:32.120 --> 03:00:35.640]  we're going into a very serious storm they've told us we're out of the storm
[03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:38.680]  that the recession's over uh porter from your deep
[03:00:38.680 --> 03:00:42.440]  financial research do you agree that uh with me that according to any economic
[03:00:42.440 --> 03:00:46.520]  indicator we're really in a depression already
[03:00:47.160 --> 03:00:51.160]  about that in terms of uh the employment uh issue
[03:00:51.160 --> 03:00:55.480]  absolutely positively correct i think in terms of economic activity it's a
[03:00:55.480 --> 03:00:58.840]  lot harder to say because there has been so much
[03:00:58.840 --> 03:01:04.680]  uh debt driven stimulus that uh there's a lot of apparent economic activity
[03:01:04.680 --> 03:01:09.320]  that is really just driven by debt so if you get a dollar in economic activity
[03:01:09.320 --> 03:01:12.920]  but you had to add two dollars in debt to get it are you really any better off
[03:01:12.920 --> 03:01:17.720]  yeah because you're you're still it's like take one step forward a step and a
[03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:21.160]  half back now we didn't have you faded up the first two seconds i want to get
[03:01:21.160 --> 03:01:24.840]  your quote exactly right here i was asking
[03:01:24.840 --> 03:01:28.920]  by the economic measurements are we in a depression and you said
[03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:31.880]  uh there's there's really two ways of looking at it but the one is from the
[03:01:31.880 --> 03:01:35.480]  standpoint of employment and economy and by that measure we're definitely in
[03:01:35.480 --> 03:01:38.360]  the depression not in a recession and we're still in it
[03:01:38.360 --> 03:01:41.560]  the other measure is just judged by economic activity
[03:01:41.560 --> 03:01:45.080]  and while we have had a return to economic activity in terms of positive
[03:01:45.080 --> 03:01:49.160]  GDP growth um much of that growth has been driven by
[03:01:49.160 --> 03:01:53.800]  debt vastly larger increases to debt than you had increases of GDP
[03:01:53.800 --> 03:01:57.560]  so the numbers are really skewed because of the size of the fiscal
[03:01:57.560 --> 03:02:01.960]  and monetary stimulus all right very interesting i agree with you on that
[03:02:01.960 --> 03:02:05.560]  let's talk to fey in florida fey you're on the year with our guest
[03:02:05.560 --> 03:02:08.680]  porter standsbury go ahead good afternoon guys
[03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:12.920]  hi thank you so much for your information i really have learned a lot
[03:02:12.920 --> 03:02:16.600]  from you uh alex and from lindsay williams and all of
[03:02:16.600 --> 03:02:21.560]  your guests and porter thank you so much for your commentary today
[03:02:21.560 --> 03:02:25.320]  you touched on this briefly before the break about
[03:02:25.320 --> 03:02:29.080]  the connection with oil and the u.s dollar
[03:02:29.080 --> 03:02:33.240]  um can you explain to us further what will happen
[03:02:33.240 --> 03:02:39.400]  when the uh oil uh cartel takes us off of the uh
[03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:44.600]  u.s dollar uh reserve currency for oil yeah what seven dollars a gallon by the
[03:02:44.600 --> 03:02:49.320]  time they're done porter well you know uh it's really
[03:02:49.320 --> 03:02:52.600]  interesting uh there's a there that most people don't know a lot about the
[03:02:52.600 --> 03:02:55.400]  history of the u.s involvement in the middle east and the oil
[03:02:55.400 --> 03:02:59.320]  businesses and uh you know the the u.s has been
[03:02:59.320 --> 03:03:03.240]  involved in hiding the true price of oil for the middle east for a long time
[03:03:03.240 --> 03:03:07.160]  uh when uh when the dollar first broke from the gold standard back in the
[03:03:07.160 --> 03:03:12.120]  early 1970s um the Saudi Arabians seized uh the
[03:03:12.120 --> 03:03:16.200]  us ownership of the oil fields because they felt that they were no longer
[03:03:16.200 --> 03:03:19.720]  we were no longer living up to our contract which was to supply them
[03:03:19.720 --> 03:03:23.480]  with uh our share of the earnings in the form of a gold back dollar
[03:03:23.480 --> 03:03:26.760]  so this is we have a long history of these sorts of problems
[03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:30.600]  and uh you know the solution to it is we'll either have to meet a vastly
[03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:34.120]  higher price or we'll have to come up with a new form of exchange with the
[03:03:34.120 --> 03:03:36.680]  middle east and there's no doubt about that i mean
[03:03:36.680 --> 03:03:39.320]  that's absolutely underway right now and it's that problem is going to
[03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:42.760]  accelerate rapidly the only good news is that there are
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:47.240]  large sources of hydrocarbons and that have just been discovered in
[03:03:47.240 --> 03:03:51.320]  shales in pennsylvania and places like texas and colorado
[03:03:51.320 --> 03:03:55.400]  at the dakotas so there is some uh for there is some
[03:03:55.400 --> 03:04:00.840]  likelihood that uh price of oil may not go quite as high as it would under a
[03:04:00.840 --> 03:04:04.120]  normal hyperinflation simply because we have discovered
[03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:08.520]  large new domestic sources well i've noticed that in the last five
[03:04:08.520 --> 03:04:11.480]  years they've been drilling like mad mad

[03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:53.160]  year coming up that the dollar is no longer the world
[03:08:53.160 --> 03:08:55.640]  reserves currency he's been saying this for a few years
[03:08:55.640 --> 03:08:58.440]  but now he's really coming out and saying this is it
[03:08:58.440 --> 03:09:01.560]  and you're seeing the chinese and russians say they're not going to deal
[03:09:01.560 --> 03:09:05.800]  in dollars for inter-country trade but between each other but he's here to
[03:09:05.800 --> 03:09:12.040]  take your phone calls right now but first i want to play that ad
[03:09:12.040 --> 03:09:18.920]  that an organization citizens against government waste
[03:09:18.920 --> 03:09:24.920]  was deemed too controversial by abc a&e the history channel and many many
[03:09:24.920 --> 03:09:28.280]  others you guys got that video ready
[03:09:28.440 --> 03:09:31.640]  fantastic as i've forgotten you to get it ready i'm glad you already had it
[03:09:31.640 --> 03:09:35.800]  just because uh porter was talking about censorship
[03:09:35.800 --> 03:09:39.880]  and how itself imposed a lot of times because people at the wall street
[03:09:39.880 --> 03:09:44.840]  journal or fox or cnn they are all tied into these companies or in
[03:09:44.840 --> 03:09:47.640]  some cases are getting government bailouts themselves
[03:09:47.640 --> 03:09:51.400]  themselves in the case of msnbc and cnbc owned by
[03:09:51.400 --> 03:09:55.880]  general general electric and they don't want you to understand
[03:09:55.880 --> 03:09:59.080]  that they're globalists they're offshore they don't care about this country
[03:09:59.080 --> 03:10:03.160]  or middle-class wealth they will sacrifice it on the altars of their
[03:10:03.160 --> 03:10:06.680]  globalist system so here's that ad with the communist
[03:10:06.680 --> 03:10:11.240]  chinese you know a decade from now talking about how america
[03:10:11.240 --> 03:10:14.920]  imploded like roam or other empires that devalued
[03:10:14.920 --> 03:10:19.080]  their currency and collectively it was banned from u.s television
[03:10:19.080 --> 03:10:24.280]  we'll get porter stanbury's take on this here it is
[03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:28.600]  basic china 20 38 days was 20 years from now
[03:10:28.600 --> 03:10:33.000]  my degree nation's fail
[03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:37.640]  ancient greeks the roman empire
[03:10:37.640 --> 03:10:43.800]  many united states of america they all made the same mistake turning
[03:10:43.800 --> 03:10:48.840]  her back on principles they made them great america tried to spend and
[03:10:48.840 --> 03:10:54.840]  tax itself out of a great recession
[03:10:54.840 --> 03:10:58.600]  enormous so-called stimulus spending massive
[03:10:58.600 --> 03:11:02.600]  changes to health care government takeovers of private industries
[03:11:02.600 --> 03:11:09.000]  and crushing debt of course we own most of the debt
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:15.000]  so now they work for us
[03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:20.200]  you can change the future you have to join citizens against government waste
[03:11:20.200 --> 03:11:23.000]  to stop the spending that is bankrupting america
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:26.600]  well who knows about congress but you can individually find out solutions that i
[03:11:26.600 --> 03:11:30.520]  think are absolutely dead on an end of america the number three dot com
[03:11:30.520 --> 03:11:34.280]  porter stanbury you know in the big picture
[03:11:34.280 --> 03:11:37.560]  in your view is there any way to write this sinking ship
[03:11:37.560 --> 03:11:40.680]  i think it's going under but if we know who to blame
[03:11:40.680 --> 03:11:43.800]  then the globalists can't get even more power out of what they're doing
[03:11:43.800 --> 03:11:47.960]  and we may be able to use the anger to finally kick them out of this country
[03:11:47.960 --> 03:11:51.960]  and reignite the engine of liberty right off these debts do you have any
[03:11:51.960 --> 03:11:57.800]  you know a large-scale solutions no but i have a lot of cynicism
[03:11:57.800 --> 03:12:03.480]  good good luck alex um i have also comment about that ad you know the
[03:12:03.480 --> 03:12:07.400]  the producers of that ad or something called the uh the people against
[03:12:07.400 --> 03:12:10.600]  government waste or something like that citizens against government waste what
[03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:13.320]  isn't government waste what what does the government do that's
[03:12:13.320 --> 03:12:18.120]  efficient or you are useful i mean it seems kind of an oxymoronic
[03:12:18.120 --> 03:12:21.960]  name for a for a for a group of people right
[03:12:22.520 --> 03:12:26.760]  but uh as far as uh you know how to stop this thing it's it's a it's
[03:12:26.760 --> 03:12:30.520]  again let's go back to the simple math um more than half of the households in
[03:12:30.520 --> 03:12:33.800]  this country do not pay any federal income taxes
[03:12:33.800 --> 03:12:37.240]  period okay so how are you going to win
[03:12:37.240 --> 03:12:41.640]  against those people in a democracy two wolves in a sheet voting on what's for
[03:12:41.640 --> 03:12:44.840]  dinner the banksters are going to sick the welfare
[03:12:44.840 --> 03:12:48.520]  hordes on you absolutely they absolutely will
[03:12:48.520 --> 03:12:51.480]  that you know there's there's two forms of welfare in this country as you well
[03:12:51.480 --> 03:12:54.520]  know there's the welfare that goes out to the lower class and the lower middle
[03:12:54.520 --> 03:12:57.960]  class by votes and then there's the welfare that goes out to the
[03:12:57.960 --> 03:13:01.400]  corporations that helps the politicians stay in power
[03:13:01.400 --> 03:13:05.320]  and i honestly don't know that there's any way to break that system
[03:13:05.320 --> 03:13:08.760]  except for a collapse of the system and you know i guess the only sort of good
[03:13:08.760 --> 03:13:12.440]  news the silver lining is that you can't continue to run an economy or
[03:13:12.440 --> 03:13:16.040]  society this way it's too corrupt and eventually the
[03:13:16.040 --> 03:13:19.240]  truth comes out of the numbers and those are the numbers that i have at this
[03:13:19.240 --> 03:13:22.760]  for to show people in my in my video you you can't go on running
[03:13:22.760 --> 03:13:26.360]  deficits and debt forever it's going to destroy the economy but here's the
[03:13:26.360 --> 03:13:30.120]  problem and i agree with you porter here's the problem
[03:13:30.120 --> 03:13:32.680]  they have preemptively set up a police state
[03:13:32.680 --> 03:13:36.760]  they plan to go into a Stalinistic system to prop this up
[03:13:36.760 --> 03:13:40.440]  they know it's going to implode and so it's during that implosion phase that
[03:13:40.440 --> 03:13:43.720]  we'd better you know point the finger at the culprits
[03:13:43.720 --> 03:13:47.240]  and in this system or they're planning to make it even worse and the reason
[03:13:47.240 --> 03:13:51.640]  i played that video earlier regardless of the you know political group statements
[03:13:51.640 --> 03:13:55.240]  uh is and of course they're against the out of control debt as well
[03:13:55.240 --> 03:13:58.920]  is to illustrate that that was collectively censored and that was the
[03:13:58.920 --> 03:14:01.400]  point you made at the start of the interview last hour
[03:14:01.400 --> 03:14:05.800]  is that the media self-censors no there's no doubt about that
[03:14:05.800 --> 03:14:08.680]  alex there's absolutely no doubt about that and i'm sure you have been
[03:14:08.680 --> 03:14:11.800]  threatened by the government over the year oh yeah there's been talk about
[03:14:11.800 --> 03:14:16.360]  shutting down talk radio things like that the government has sued me uh for
[03:14:16.360 --> 03:14:19.960]  uh for writing an investment report about that officially was about corruption
[03:14:19.960 --> 03:14:24.200]  and a government-controlled company um you know you know anyone who really
[03:14:24.200 --> 03:14:28.360]  speaks out it says the truth about things uh is going to put a bullseye on
[03:14:28.360 --> 03:14:32.360]  their heads and they're going to get attacked and uh you know
[03:14:32.360 --> 03:14:35.320]  i know that you probably your viewers they're probably different opinions in
[03:14:35.320 --> 03:14:40.120]  regards to the wikileaks guy who uh who has been broadcasting state secrets
[03:14:40.120 --> 03:14:43.960]  i think some people are probably think he should be hung up and strong up
[03:14:43.960 --> 03:14:47.400]  but i actually think that anyone who increases the amount of information is
[03:14:47.400 --> 03:14:51.160]  doing a good thing not a bad thing well i agree with ron paul in his statement
[03:14:51.160 --> 03:14:56.600]  that telling the truth is not treason and sarah palin says he's not american
[03:14:56.600 --> 03:15:01.160]  well he is from australia i mean she was saying north korea is our ally the
[03:15:01.160 --> 03:15:04.360]  week before i don't want to bash her but get me look really folks if she doesn't
[03:15:04.360 --> 03:15:07.720]  have a teleprompter she's in deep trouble and and and now this is who they're
[03:15:07.720 --> 03:15:12.520]  getting ready to run for president as our savior i mean look look my whole
[03:15:12.520 --> 03:15:15.800]  issue here is there's no doubt you're right there's no doubt the video you're
[03:15:15.800 --> 03:15:18.360]  breaking down end of america the number three dot com
[03:15:18.360 --> 03:15:23.240]  you know really has some good solutions in it uh i'm just uh i'm just flabbergasted

[03:16:32.840 --> 03:16:36.200]  questions or do you want me to see what i saw regarding just briefly what you see
[03:16:36.200 --> 03:16:41.080]  with the tsa very very briefly what i saw uh... was in my neighborhood as i was
[03:16:41.080 --> 03:16:43.080]  out walking
[03:16:43.080 --> 03:16:48.040]  off the main highway there uh... there we call them duly you know i you know i
[03:16:48.040 --> 03:16:51.880]  live in texas that's a truck with the four wheels in the back exactly
[03:16:51.880 --> 03:16:56.920]  uh... duly was pulling a long white
[03:16:56.920 --> 03:17:01.800]  uh... container or that that like a mobile home type
[03:17:01.800 --> 03:17:05.800]  uh... situation we call them batmobiles out here it doesn't matter what you see
[03:17:05.800 --> 03:17:09.800]  uh... well said department of homeland security turned off the highway
[03:17:09.800 --> 03:17:14.760]  uh... this was probably around three in the afternoon what did you want to do
[03:17:14.760 --> 03:17:18.360]  it basically just came through the neighborhood
[03:17:18.360 --> 03:17:21.720]  did you really went back out and it went on the highway
[03:17:21.720 --> 03:17:24.600]  yeah okay so they're driving around everywhere and putting up tele screens
[03:17:24.600 --> 03:17:26.840]  what's your question for porter
[03:17:26.840 --> 03:17:32.680]  for porter is uh... regarding the federal reserve in new york and of course
[03:17:32.680 --> 03:17:37.880]  they're not federal uh... when i i was and i shared this with you
[03:17:37.880 --> 03:17:41.720]  uh... alex a few weeks or maybe a month or so ago i was in the merchant
[03:17:41.720 --> 03:17:44.760]  marines i went to the merchant marine academy on long island
[03:17:44.760 --> 03:17:49.320]  our field trip for economics or for uh... when we were back there as pleads
[03:17:49.320 --> 03:17:52.440]  was to go out at wall street have to or the federal reserve
[03:17:52.440 --> 03:17:57.880]  when we were taken down uh... to the bay into the basement our guide
[03:17:57.880 --> 03:18:03.000]  uh... uh... was uh... very arrogant saying oh we've never
[03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:06.440]  been broke into it won't but he took us down into a room
[03:18:06.440 --> 03:18:10.680]  and in a caged area it stuck your finger and it showed
[03:18:10.680 --> 03:18:15.880]  on pat wooden pallets piles of gold bullion and he basically said
[03:18:15.880 --> 03:18:19.320]  for each pallet of gold you see you can see here
[03:18:19.320 --> 03:18:24.440]  that is gold for uh... various different countries that's
[03:18:24.440 --> 03:18:28.680]  zimbabwe understand i'm gonna have to let you go in about ten seconds do you have a question
[03:18:28.680 --> 03:18:34.440]  my question to porter is of course this was an 81 porter
[03:18:34.440 --> 03:18:38.360]  was is that just a dog and pony show or is that real gold
[03:18:38.360 --> 03:18:41.800]  i appreciate your call we know that they have a fraction of gold backing for
[03:18:41.800 --> 03:18:46.280]  their fiat currency in fact it's not even officially gold backed up order
[03:18:46.280 --> 03:18:50.040]  uh... yeah that's true that the federal reserve bank in new york holds a lot of
[03:18:50.040 --> 03:18:52.360]  gold bullion on deposit for other countries
[03:18:52.360 --> 03:18:55.720]  i don't really think that plays a role in our discussion as i said
[03:18:55.720 --> 03:19:00.360]  uh... no matter how much gold the federal reserve has not nearly enough to
[03:19:00.360 --> 03:19:03.480]  back the currency they've created over the last couple years so
[03:19:03.480 --> 03:19:06.360]  for the gold to be used as backing again the price of gold would have to go
[03:19:06.360 --> 03:19:10.280]  much much higher porter on a side issue we're going to skip this final break
[03:19:10.280 --> 03:19:14.440]  um... in this hour before we let you go at the bottom of the hour we're going to
[03:19:14.440 --> 03:19:17.240]  take more calls and hopefully they can be quicker questions i don't mind long
[03:19:17.240 --> 03:19:20.840]  questions but we're almost out of time here wiki b-leaks
[03:19:20.840 --> 03:19:23.800]  epa document shows it knowingly allowed
[03:19:23.800 --> 03:19:27.720]  pesticide that killed honeybees that's what the german study showed three years
[03:19:27.720 --> 03:19:31.240]  ago there's an example of this culture of corruption
[03:19:31.240 --> 03:19:35.560]  where they know that honeybees are dying in some areas almost completely
[03:19:35.560 --> 03:19:39.560]  and the government doesn't care because they're owned by special interest
[03:19:39.560 --> 03:19:44.440]  that have no connection to reality i mean we're in a lot of trouble porter
[03:19:44.440 --> 03:19:48.520]  yeah i i really i agree i've read a lot of the wiki leaks material even before
[03:19:48.520 --> 03:19:51.400]  the guy became famous i've been using wiki leaks in my research
[03:19:51.400 --> 03:19:55.240]  for the last year and i've always found the content to be excellent
[03:19:55.240 --> 03:19:58.920]  um... i certainly don't have it i don't know why americans would feel threatened
[03:19:58.920 --> 03:20:02.040]  by someone telling the truth about what our government's doing if our government's
[03:20:02.040 --> 03:20:04.920]  not acting at our best interest why shouldn't we know about it
[03:20:04.920 --> 03:20:08.280]  uh... people get off on being slaves they like being hurt real bad and don't
[03:20:08.280 --> 03:20:10.520]  worry that the system's gonna hurt you real bad
[03:20:10.520 --> 03:20:15.080]  uh... mark and georgia you're on the air with our guests uh porter go ahead
[03:20:15.080 --> 03:20:20.200]  hey alex um and perp great job on uh... on your side i signed up after i heard
[03:20:20.200 --> 03:20:21.000]  that uh...
[03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:26.040]  heard you're out on alex's show um porter i i i have three quick points one is
[03:20:26.040 --> 03:20:29.560]  you're what's to stop the federal reserve from continuing to manipulate the
[03:20:29.560 --> 03:20:31.960]  bid to cover ratio on the treasury bonds by
[03:20:31.960 --> 03:20:35.800]  filing money to the caribbean hedge funds and having to come back into the
[03:20:35.800 --> 03:20:38.600]  treasury appearing to be an independent treasury purchase
[03:20:38.600 --> 03:20:45.160]  two on the oil side um saudi arabia is is corral more more militarily than
[03:20:45.160 --> 03:20:46.920]  than you know they don't love the dollar
[03:20:46.920 --> 03:20:50.920]  they're just uh strung up by the of u.s army and the third thing is i i don't
[03:20:50.920 --> 03:20:54.440]  think they're going to let this the dollar go so quickly until they have
[03:20:54.440 --> 03:20:58.520]  something in place like the bank or the sdr those are my three points
[03:20:58.520 --> 03:21:01.560]  okay great i think those are all excellent questions uh to your first
[03:21:01.560 --> 03:21:05.080]  point yes uh under the regulations that the fed operates under
[03:21:05.080 --> 03:21:08.840]  authorizations from congress and such like that they can buy any asset they
[03:21:08.840 --> 03:21:13.160]  want i mean so the yes the answer is they can manipulate the dollar for a
[03:21:13.160 --> 03:21:15.720]  very long time they have a great power to do so
[03:21:15.720 --> 03:21:19.080]  the problem is is that they cannot control the effects of doing that in a
[03:21:19.080 --> 03:21:22.920]  broader economy so the reason why i believe the system is beginning to
[03:21:22.920 --> 03:21:26.360]  break down is because it's clear to me that the effects of what they're doing
[03:21:26.360 --> 03:21:29.960]  a lower value of the dollar are beginning to have serious complications of the
[03:21:29.960 --> 03:21:33.960]  global economy uh in regards to saudi arabia being a slave to america's
[03:21:33.960 --> 03:21:37.720]  military power you're exactly right that's exactly true
[03:21:37.720 --> 03:21:40.920]  unfortunately that doesn't mean that saudi arabia is going to continue to
[03:21:40.920 --> 03:21:44.120]  give us oil if you look back at the history of saudi arabia
[03:21:44.120 --> 03:21:47.080]  every time we have done something to devalue the dollar they have been
[03:21:47.080 --> 03:21:50.440]  successfully able to negotiate a vastly higher price for crude
[03:21:50.440 --> 03:21:54.520]  i have no doubt that will continue and in regards to uh the dollar being able to
[03:21:54.520 --> 03:21:58.120]  hold the value it's unfortunately that's simply not the way the global
[03:21:58.120 --> 03:22:02.040]  currency markets work global currency market volume is about five trillion
[03:22:02.040 --> 03:22:06.120]  dollars a day as wealthy as our government is there's no way to control that
[03:22:06.120 --> 03:22:09.400]  market and we already see the slide as i said earlier
[03:22:09.400 --> 03:22:14.120]  accelerating a great questions uh mark uh let's go ahead and talk to joe and
[03:22:14.120 --> 03:22:19.560]  pencil vane you're on the air uh hello there gentlemen how are you good
[03:22:19.560 --> 03:22:25.160]  well i got three quick um questions and uh i'll take them off air all right
[03:22:25.160 --> 03:22:29.880]  um number one um when you say get assets like
[03:22:29.880 --> 03:22:33.800]  agricultural and gold are you talking physical or
[03:22:33.800 --> 03:22:40.360]  stocks that's number one and number two if i do buy the stocks let's say i have
[03:22:40.360 --> 03:22:43.960]  about ten thousand dollars and this and the
[03:22:43.960 --> 03:22:47.720]  system in clothes and the dollar collapses how do i
[03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:51.880]  get my my money back out of the markets
[03:22:51.880 --> 03:22:55.640]  and what do i do with it once i get it all right well what i would do personally
[03:22:55.640 --> 03:22:58.040]  and i'm gonna get porter's tape i want to see if you're here with me
[03:22:58.040 --> 03:23:02.520]  if you only got ten grand i would buy silver uh personally that you know
[03:23:02.520 --> 03:23:06.760]  that's the poor man's gold uh because there's not much to hedge there maybe a
[03:23:06.760 --> 03:23:10.200]  little gold and then some silver uh but i mean let's get a porter's
[03:23:10.200 --> 03:23:15.080]  take on what i just said um yeah yeah i i think the questions are a
[03:23:15.080 --> 03:23:18.280]  little bit more uh strategic than that which was not just what i should buy but
[03:23:18.280 --> 03:23:22.040]  how do i have i gonna be able to use it and i think it's really a work it's a
[03:23:22.040 --> 03:23:24.520]  very good and honest question and i appreciate you asking it because i'm
[03:23:24.520 --> 03:23:27.800]  sure a lot of other people have it but i also think it's emblematic of
[03:23:27.800 --> 03:23:31.720]  something that's really quite amazing for the entire history of mankind
[03:23:31.720 --> 03:23:35.480]  precious metals have been money gold people have had gold or gold receipts
[03:23:35.480 --> 03:23:38.440]  people had silver coins in their pockets everybody knew how to use these
[03:23:38.440 --> 03:23:41.720]  things and yet in just the last 40 years the entire
[03:23:41.720 --> 03:23:45.080]  american population has forgotten what real money even feels like or how to
[03:23:45.080 --> 03:23:48.200]  use it the point of buying bullion and silver
[03:23:48.200 --> 03:23:52.040]  gold bullion and silver bullion today so that when the monetary system collapses
[03:23:52.040 --> 03:23:55.880]  you'll still have money because when the paper money collapses people are going
[03:23:55.880 --> 03:24:00.280]  to demand real money again and real money is gold and silver
[03:24:00.280 --> 03:24:04.280]  and whatever new fiat they have you can also cash it in at that point
[03:24:04.280 --> 03:24:07.800]  and in history it will save its value so you won't have
[03:24:07.800 --> 03:24:12.840]  of the the devaluation right and so you know by the way if you want to put
[03:24:12.840 --> 03:24:15.720]  yourself on gold standard today it's really easy to do
[03:24:15.720 --> 03:24:19.000]  you can buy gold very easily from bullion dealers all over the country
[03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:22.200]  you can keep your your savings in gold and when you have to go
[03:24:22.200 --> 03:24:27.400]  spend money you can go to a local a part shop or a local bullion dealer and
[03:24:27.400 --> 03:24:30.360]  cash in a coin every week and now you've got your spending money
[03:24:30.360 --> 03:24:33.480]  yeah instead of going to the bank to get paper router to write a check
[03:24:33.480 --> 03:24:37.320]  you're the bank and then you'll cash it in for their confetti at the point
[03:24:37.320 --> 03:24:41.400]  and your gold and silver historically will rise with the devaluation
[03:24:41.400 --> 03:24:44.920]  and so it's saving your value it's a hedge against inflation
[03:24:44.920 --> 03:24:48.120]  uh but i appreciate your calls yo great questions
[03:24:48.120 --> 03:24:53.640]  george in connecticut you're on the air with our guest yeah i have a question as
[03:24:53.640 --> 03:24:59.160]  far as uh i'm 59 and a half uh most of my money's in ira's i have it in
[03:24:59.160 --> 03:25:04.440]  gld or in heart currency but uh you're talking about uh getting it out of
[03:25:04.440 --> 03:25:07.240]  the country before so what the heck do i do
[03:25:07.240 --> 03:25:12.280]  and uh i'm almost uh ready to jump ship and maybe go to russia i have a
[03:25:12.280 --> 03:25:16.120]  an apartment here my wife's from there i mean at least the ruble might be worth
[03:25:16.120 --> 03:25:20.120]  something have some value well promise they'll shake you down over
[03:25:20.120 --> 03:25:23.320]  there too porter well you know actually i i don't have
[03:25:23.320 --> 03:25:26.360]  experience of living in russia so i can't really talk about that
[03:25:26.360 --> 03:25:30.440]  but i do think that one of the things that um i feature on my video
[03:25:30.440 --> 03:25:34.760]  is there are uh five different assets that you can own legally outside the
[03:25:34.760 --> 03:25:37.320]  country that you don't have to report to the government
[03:25:37.320 --> 03:25:41.000]  and i think it's very important for people to begin to move some assets
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:45.000]  outside the country assuming that you are of a person of significant wealth
[03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:47.720]  you're going to want to put some of that stuff outside of the reach of these
[03:25:47.720 --> 03:25:51.480]  bureaucrats because as the statement unravels they're going to tax anything
[03:25:51.480 --> 03:25:56.280]  they can find and when when people get your
[03:25:56.280 --> 03:25:59.720]  newsletter they find out the strategic ideas you've got to safely
[03:25:59.720 --> 03:26:02.760]  move something offshore and you can find out more with the free video at end of
[03:26:02.760 --> 03:26:06.520]  america the number three dot com uh go ahead call her
[03:26:06.520 --> 03:26:10.280]  go ahead george ira related to the problem i mean that's my complication
[03:26:10.280 --> 03:26:14.520]  where it's all stuck in ira you not easily got uh you know dissolved well you
[03:26:14.520 --> 03:26:18.280]  can do what you want i'm not going to give advice i have no ira's
[03:26:18.280 --> 03:26:24.120]  i would take personally the penalty uh and uh physically hold but uh porter
[03:26:24.120 --> 03:26:27.880]  what's your take on that before before you do that there are i i can't give a
[03:26:27.880 --> 03:26:31.480]  lot of very useful advice over the phone and i i'm not i don't mean to give any
[03:26:31.480 --> 03:26:34.840]  particular investment advice any individual but there are ways of dealing
[03:26:34.840 --> 03:26:37.240]  with your ira you should really speak to an asset
[03:26:37.240 --> 03:26:40.280]  protection attorney or you should try reading my newsletter for some details
[03:26:40.280 --> 03:26:43.720]  about it but you could you can do things like formula corporation
[03:26:43.720 --> 03:26:47.160]  so that you can you can get control of your ira you can put it anywhere you
[03:26:47.160 --> 03:26:49.240]  want oh yeah that's folks do that create a
[03:26:49.240 --> 03:26:52.440]  corporation move it into your corporation now you've got control of it
[03:26:52.440 --> 03:26:55.240]  and then you can have that corporation convert the ira right
[03:26:55.240 --> 03:26:58.040]  well you could you could just use the corporation to do things like buy real
[03:26:58.040 --> 03:27:00.360]  estate overseas which doesn't have to be reported
[03:27:00.360 --> 03:27:03.960]  there are lots of variations on these things there are important important
[03:27:03.960 --> 03:27:06.920]  rules you have to follow if you're going to do anything like that so please
[03:27:06.920 --> 03:27:10.440]  make sure you speak to a competent attorney get some actual advice don't
[03:27:10.440 --> 03:27:13.800]  just say i heard a guy say on the radio when the ira comes knocking on your
[03:27:13.800 --> 03:27:15.960]  door exactly this stuff is got to be done
[03:27:15.960 --> 03:27:21.000]  exactly right it's very dangerous absolutely uh and they're starting to
[03:27:21.000 --> 03:27:23.560]  clamp down i mean i i'll just put you this way
[03:27:23.560 --> 03:27:27.560]  john wanes some of john wanes family has just left the country
[03:27:27.560 --> 03:27:31.400]  yeah i gotta tell you alex uh i know i know the very most successful asset
[03:27:31.400 --> 03:27:34.280]  protection attorney in the united states and he is
[03:27:34.280 --> 03:27:38.840]  he's setting up to close his practice because the government is clamping down
[03:27:38.840 --> 03:27:41.800]  all these things that they're gonna not be legal anymore and then once they're
[03:27:41.800 --> 03:27:45.800]  not legal anymore he can't help you so if you if you if you're gonna make a move
[03:27:45.800 --> 03:27:49.320]  i think you've got 12 or 18 months to make it tops
[03:27:49.320 --> 03:27:54.040]  well some of john wanes family um has already left
[03:27:54.040 --> 03:27:57.800]  left because they say they say that there's a bunch of rules changing this
[03:27:57.800 --> 03:28:01.080]  year correct uh there are there are rules change there
[03:28:01.080 --> 03:28:04.680]  there with the beginning uh was uh the summer of 2008 when they
[03:28:04.680 --> 03:28:07.480]  when they made it against the law for you just take your assets out of the
[03:28:07.480 --> 03:28:11.720]  country without paying taxes on them first which is a which is actually the
[03:28:11.720 --> 03:28:15.320]  modeled after a soviet law from the from the 1960s
[03:28:15.320 --> 03:28:19.320]  i mean literally so uh and now there are more laws they're going to be taking
[03:28:19.320 --> 03:28:23.960]  effect jenner first 2013 so you know these people
[03:28:23.960 --> 03:28:26.840]  they're uh they're going to do everything they can to stay in power and they
[03:28:26.840 --> 03:28:30.520]  know the risk of hyperinflation so what would i do i would create a
[03:28:30.520 --> 03:28:34.760]  subsidiary in the us to run my operation here but then i'd have to move
[03:28:34.760 --> 03:28:38.280]  somewhere in broadcast from there from another subsidiary
[03:28:38.280 --> 03:28:42.600]  i guess the caimans or something or they'll completely shut us down
[03:28:42.600 --> 03:28:46.840]  you know um alex uh you know i'm certainly no expert at this
[03:28:46.840 --> 03:28:51.800]  but i can tell you from where i stand i have subscribers at more than 150
[03:28:51.800 --> 03:28:55.400]  different countries and there isn't any subscriber who cares where i'm

[03:28:59.880 --> 03:29:03.720]  painful to watch this country going into the clutches of hardcore criminals and
[03:29:03.720 --> 03:29:07.560]  to watch the dumb down population running around watching sports getting
[03:29:07.560 --> 03:29:11.240]  drunk they have no idea how bad they're about to get hurt and then these crooks

[03:29:14.600 --> 03:29:19.000]  they're going to tear us apart uh just it's it's horrible
