[00:00.000 --> 00:12.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.800 --> 00:21.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.560 --> 00:34.280]  well it's hard to believe ladies and gentlemen but it's already Friday 29th
[00:34.280 --> 00:41.680]  day of August 2014 we're gonna be live here for the next three hours I'm gonna
[00:41.680 --> 00:55.440]  get my limited crew because they're so busy and so few to go back to the last
[00:55.440 --> 01:00.680]  a year and a half where I have basically broken down exactly what would
[01:00.680 --> 01:06.200]  happen hundreds of times so that I can have those clips on the Sunday show this
[01:06.200 --> 01:14.840]  Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. and the scores of articles by Curtin MO Paul Watson and
[01:14.840 --> 01:23.400]  others where we specifically said the West is arming Al Qaeda changing their
[01:23.400 --> 01:29.880]  name to confuse the public to IS and ISIS and is going to attack the West and
[01:29.880 --> 01:34.260]  that's going to be used as a pretext to take American liberties European
[01:34.260 --> 01:40.880]  liberties and deploy paramilitary on the streets and I've also said over and
[01:40.880 --> 01:47.000]  over again that Obama has taken more vacations than anyone I have ever seen
[01:47.000 --> 01:54.760]  and the media admits that he he breaks the record of even George W. Bush who
[01:54.760 --> 01:58.160]  would take about two and a half months of vacation Obama takes over four months
[01:58.160 --> 02:05.520]  of vacation a year but I said that if he ever comes home from a vacation that's
[02:05.520 --> 02:10.200]  cuz he doesn't want to get blamed for what's about to happen it's a bad image
[02:10.200 --> 02:21.080]  problem urgent is the drudge report headline Obama to intercept and to
[02:21.080 --> 02:27.240]  interrupt weekend fundraising trip will return to DC was gonna attend a MSNBC
[02:27.240 --> 02:35.160]  wedding and do three fundraisers but he will still attend the MSNBC wedding
[02:35.160 --> 02:47.480]  while UK raises terror threat to severe basically their highest level the FBI has
[02:47.480 --> 02:55.400]  put out a terror alert as well today do you know who's not listed on the terror
[02:55.400 --> 02:57.840]  alert
[02:59.560 --> 03:05.640]  the South of Washington Times FBI national domestic threat assessment
[03:05.640 --> 03:10.720]  omits Islamist terrorism so they're saying a domestic attack meaning here in
[03:10.720 --> 03:17.200]  the US could happen at any moment but Muslims radical Muslims are not listed
[03:17.200 --> 03:22.320]  you know who is listed right you know the drill we first broke this seven years
[03:22.320 --> 03:28.800]  ago no one believed us mainstream news now even when it was finally the New
[03:28.800 --> 03:31.040]  York Times a week later we got no credit that's fine
[03:31.040 --> 03:34.440]  people to know we don't we're not making stuff up okay no matter how wild it

[08:45.960 --> 08:50.360]  me I want it red-linked when we post this Reuters article with links to our
[08:50.360 --> 08:54.280]  background and research on this I'm gonna add the Ray McGovern video that we
[08:54.280 --> 09:00.440]  reared yesterday to that where he says this could end in nuclear war
[09:00.440 --> 09:08.200]  headline top CIA analyst moving troops into Poland and Ukraine could trigger
[09:08.200 --> 09:15.520]  nuclear war a very good chance of it and now Putin has come out saying don't
[09:15.520 --> 09:21.720]  mess with nuclear Russia Putin says Reuters Vladimir Putin said today just
[09:21.720 --> 09:26.440]  minutes ago we're gonna post the actual Russian transcript at info wars so you
[09:26.440 --> 09:32.120]  get the full thing on Friday Russia's armed forces see why I spent three hours
[09:32.120 --> 09:35.000]  on this yesterday and had people asking why I was there such a big deal of
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.680]  Ukraine because this is a big deal Russian troops are going into Ukraine
[09:40.680 --> 09:45.240]  right now and I don't just sit there and agree with CNN they've been in a
[09:45.240 --> 09:50.640]  proxy battle for six months president Vladimir Putin said on Friday Russia's
[09:50.640 --> 09:55.960]  armed forces backed by its nuclear arsenal we're ready to meet any aggression
[09:55.960 --> 10:01.040]  declaring at a pro-Kremlin youth camp that foreign states should understand
[10:01.040 --> 10:07.600]  it's best not to mess with us this is absolutely insane crazy level
[10:07.600 --> 10:15.000]  information Putin told the assembly on the banks of the lake near Moscow that
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.480]  Russian takeover in fact I'll guarantee you this is on RT right now guys go to
[10:19.480 --> 10:23.560]  RT Russia I guarantee it's their top video Putin told the assembly on the
[10:23.560 --> 10:28.080]  banks of the lake near Moscow let's get that on info wars.com as well the
[10:28.080 --> 10:34.440]  Russian takeover of Crimea in March was essential to save a largely Russian
[10:34.440 --> 10:37.800]  speaking population from Ukrainian government violence and they have been
[10:37.800 --> 10:41.320]  there ethnically cleansing them he said continued fighting each in Ukraine
[10:41.320 --> 10:47.040]  where pro-Russian separatists launched a uprising in April was the latest of a
[10:47.040 --> 10:52.960]  reversal and a refusal by Kiev to negotiate.
[10:52.960 --> 10:57.080]  Ukraine and Western governments accused Russia of sending troops and armor to
[10:57.080 --> 11:00.400]  back the separatists in a conflict that has already killed over 2,000 people
[11:00.400 --> 11:04.320]  Russia denies the charge Russia is far from being involved in any large-scale
[11:04.320 --> 11:09.320]  conflicts notice that key word these are asymmetrical skirmishes he said at the
[11:09.320 --> 11:15.000]  camp on the banks of the lake we don't want that and we don't plan it but
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.560]  naturally we should always be ready to repel any aggression towards Russia
[11:19.560 --> 11:24.560]  Russia's partners should understand it's best not to mess with us said Putin
[11:24.560 --> 11:30.080]  dressed casually in a gray sweater and light blue jeans thank God I think no
[11:30.080 --> 11:34.040]  one is thinking of unleashing a large-scale conflict with Russia they're
[11:34.040 --> 11:38.440]  moving US troops mercenaries you name it into Poland and Ukraine with the CIA
[11:38.440 --> 11:42.760]  director sitting in all up three months ago this is all public they thank God
[11:42.760 --> 11:45.920]  you're not planning something as we have nuclear weapons and we're rolling them
[11:45.920 --> 11:51.960]  up to the border when NATO and and again it's not our government folks it's
[11:51.960 --> 11:57.800]  globalist manipulating this just like they funded al-Qaeda in Iraq and al-Qaeda
[11:57.800 --> 12:03.280]  in Syria is the main force they renamed it IS or ISIS now the political class
[12:03.280 --> 12:07.720]  says brace for terror attack we're about to get hit by al-Qaeda or ISIS
[12:07.720 --> 12:13.280]  highest terror level alert in England terror level alert New York City for
[12:13.280 --> 12:19.600]  ISIS and no one's talking about who gave them the weapons just a year ago we
[12:19.600 --> 12:25.000]  had Rand Paul saying we don't want to be the air force for al-Qaeda and Senator
[12:25.000 --> 12:31.920]  Ted Cruz and others and so they had a problem the CFR openly said we have a
[12:31.920 --> 12:34.520]  problem it's coming out that we're working with these people what do we do
[12:34.520 --> 12:37.720]  so they have this whole PR thing of well we can't control them and they are
[12:37.720 --> 12:42.200]  good fighters and Assad is bad but we'll bomb them later and you know we'll take
[12:42.200 --> 12:45.680]  care of the al-Qaeda problem after they've taken care of Assad for us blah
[12:45.680 --> 12:49.000]  blah blah that's why we've given them the weapons and trained them and then our
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.800]  own military came out and said yeah we've been forced to give them weapons and
[12:51.800 --> 12:55.800]  train them and Tosh Plumlee had the Justice Department put a gag order on
[12:55.800 --> 13:01.120]  him he was reporting on C-130s flying arms into the radical Islamist state
[13:01.120 --> 13:09.280]  Shia folks and then we're basically told brace for terror attack brace for terror
[13:09.280 --> 13:16.000]  attack brace for terror attack the al-Qaeda threat the IS threat is real
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.920]  but they were funded protected shepherded by the criminals that have hijacked
[13:21.920 --> 13:26.760]  our country in Europe and many other nations is Putin good no he represents
[13:26.760 --> 13:34.520]  a mafioso type Russian strong arm system where basically the KGB just became
[13:34.520 --> 13:37.640]  the oligarchs instead of the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and the
[13:37.640 --> 13:42.840]  Armin Hammer Al Gore dynasty that owned the big factories all over Russia our
[13:42.840 --> 13:49.040]  government in 1917 put the Bolsheviks in on record it's declassified gutted the
[13:49.040 --> 13:53.840]  whole country over 30 years Stalin was our big ally Lenin was our ally they
[13:53.840 --> 13:59.320]  were in time magazine as saviors even in the mid 30s and late 30s and early 40s
[13:59.320 --> 14:05.080]  endorsed publicly given all our major factories built up to take over the
[14:05.080 --> 14:09.440]  world so we could then point the finger and say oh my gosh the commies are
[14:09.440 --> 14:13.280]  taking over we've got to build up a big army to counter them and then that that
[14:13.280 --> 14:17.360]  army took over the rest of the world jack Spratt could eat no fat his wife
[14:17.360 --> 14:24.640]  could eat no lean in between the two of them they lick the platter clean these
[14:24.640 --> 14:29.320]  are children's nursery rhymes I'm sure the public can understand what's
[14:29.320 --> 14:33.640]  happening here this is so simple and when I talk like that I'm not talking to
[14:33.640 --> 14:37.600]  our general listeners that no more than I do in many cases I'm always amazed by
[14:37.600 --> 14:41.880]  how informed people are I'm talking about the general public the system
[14:41.880 --> 14:53.800]  thinks you're so dumb they think you're so stupid that they would fund Al Qaeda
[14:53.800 --> 14:59.120]  protect Al Qaeda give them stinger missiles just a year ago for the last
[14:59.120 --> 15:03.240]  four years they've been doing it publicly but for a year it's been
[15:03.240 --> 15:06.720]  escalated and then turn right around and say we got to take your rights and
[15:06.720 --> 15:09.520]  have armored vehicles on the street corners and checkpoints everywhere
[15:09.520 --> 15:12.880]  because ISIS is inside the country with stinger missiles and they're about to
[15:12.880 --> 15:20.680]  shoot down you have 20 airliners a day literally if they got a hundred stinger
[15:20.680 --> 15:24.280]  missiles into this country and half of the missile launches were successful
[15:24.280 --> 15:33.200]  you'd be talking about 50 aircraft shot down they were given 15,000 impads many
[15:33.200 --> 15:38.200]  of them more advanced and high-tech than the latest stinger type missiles and you
[15:38.200 --> 15:41.200]  can see the operation terror the globalists are going to launch they
[15:41.200 --> 15:44.400]  could shoot down hundreds and hundreds of aircraft with these in Europe the
[15:44.400 --> 15:49.240]  United States the Middle East the FAA had to suspend during the last Gaza
[15:49.240 --> 15:54.920]  crisis that just ended thank God their flights into Israel because they know
[15:54.920 --> 15:59.160]  there's impads out there so I want to explain this is a real crisis but the
[15:59.160 --> 16:03.920]  global crime syndicate call them chaos call them specter call them Dr. Evil
[16:03.920 --> 16:07.080]  whatever you want to call these groups that are gonna make money off weapons
[16:07.080 --> 16:10.760]  sales off the crisis off the insider trading off of knowing what's coming
[16:10.760 --> 16:15.840]  before it happens they literally are using this to destabilize the entire
[16:15.840 --> 16:21.400]  planet and the Russians are not in an offensive posture the communist Chinese
[16:21.400 --> 16:25.200]  backed by the globalist are buying basically up the oil fields worldwide
[16:25.200 --> 16:31.160]  that the rare earth minerals the weapons systems the media systems censoring
[16:31.160 --> 16:35.800]  US media working with Microsoft to censor the internet worldwide in Google
[16:35.800 --> 16:43.040]  China is a real hardcore new world order threat Russia there is some
[16:43.040 --> 16:46.440]  intermediary connections with the globalist the new world order but Russia
[16:46.440 --> 16:51.040]  through sultz and eastern discovered that they've been hijacked by a eugenics
[16:51.040 --> 16:55.320]  program to destroy them that's why communism was put in there because Russia
[16:55.320 --> 16:59.800]  was the only rival to the globalist using the West parasitically as their
[16:59.800 --> 17:04.280]  engine of domination so shaltz and eastern wrote a bunch of books on this
[17:04.280 --> 17:10.120]  not the one he won the Nobel Prize for gulagurka pellica and he met repeatedly
[17:10.120 --> 17:13.920]  with Putin now I don't know if Putin's double crossing all that but if you look
[17:13.920 --> 17:17.720]  at Russian radio and TV it's a new world order there's cancer in the vaccines
[17:17.720 --> 17:22.280]  global government they want to kill us have children don't abort your children
[17:22.280 --> 17:28.680]  I mean Russia knows what's going on and just the fact that that's caught on in
[17:28.680 --> 17:33.000]  Russia the new order could start a nuclear war with them
[17:33.000 --> 17:37.720]  they want to take their gas pipelines they want to take their oil fields they
[17:37.720 --> 17:41.280]  want to take their only port to get stuff out to Europe and they're doing it
[17:41.280 --> 17:47.480]  right now you are seeing what Napoleon and what Hitler did and by the way you
[17:47.480 --> 17:50.840]  notice Obama knows he won't get any trouble the globalists know he's about
[17:50.840 --> 17:53.640]  to sign an executive order that's in the Associated Press to legalize the
[17:53.640 --> 18:00.600]  illegals gonna stop deportations completely he is about to shine us on to
[18:00.600 --> 18:04.760]  the UN and put carbon taxes on basically everything we do outside of law and
[18:04.760 --> 18:09.720]  Rand Paul said the senator said you are not a king well if he didn't go to jail
[18:09.720 --> 18:14.040]  he is a king and now the establishment sets the precedent to whoever they put
[18:14.040 --> 18:20.280]  in as their puppet dictator will be a dictator in fact an elected dictator
[18:20.280 --> 18:26.360]  because it won't matter once you elect them they act dictatorially so you can
[18:26.360 --> 18:30.080]  see it on every front the globalists are taking down Africa they're taking down
[18:30.080 --> 18:33.920]  Europe they're taking down Latin America they're taking down Asia they are
[18:33.920 --> 18:39.440]  taking everything down I'm skipping this network break it's too important that
[18:39.440 --> 18:42.320]  means our dear station shouldn't be covering the substance of network break
[18:42.320 --> 18:45.160]  this cost us three four thousand dollars every time we skip it but it's that
[18:45.160 --> 18:51.280]  important I'm skipping it ladies and gentlemen do you realize the magnitude
[18:51.280 --> 18:57.400]  of what we're facing stuff is so hardcore that it's disrespectful you know
[18:57.400 --> 19:01.120]  they'll have some OJ Simpson verdict or they'll have some hyped up Miley Cyrus
[19:01.120 --> 19:05.440]  thing and talk radio will suspend commercials for a whole day sometimes I
[19:05.440 --> 19:10.760]  feel like ought to suspend them period we ought to be on our knees everybody
[19:10.760 --> 19:15.480]  should be at church right now praying to God that this Cuban Missile Crisis part
[19:15.480 --> 19:21.120]  two comes to an end but this time it's not the evil communist Russians trying
[19:21.120 --> 19:26.200]  to put missiles in Cuba it is the West moving missiles to shoot down their
[19:26.200 --> 19:30.800]  missiles so there can be a first strike on Russia and Russia sees the missile
[19:30.800 --> 19:35.920]  cruisers coming in they see the systems to shoot down their response strike they
[19:35.920 --> 19:40.680]  see the mercenaries al-Qaeda being turned loose all over their borders from
[19:40.680 --> 19:45.700]  Chechnya you know right through to Russia proper blowing stuff up and it's
[19:45.700 --> 19:52.440]  Western backed they don't even hide the fact that the CIA is arming al-Qaeda
[19:52.440 --> 19:57.680]  groups to attack Russia so you can see the massive double-cross and again
[19:57.680 --> 20:01.800]  they're shutting off our power they're shutting off our jobs they're shutting
[20:01.800 --> 20:05.520]  down our coal power plants they're they're passing more taxes here to shut
[20:05.520 --> 20:11.000]  us down just those are sanctions Obamacare is a sanction on our medical
[20:11.000 --> 20:15.960]  care system on the average person and seven taxes on blue collar workers and
[20:15.960 --> 20:20.680]  poor people and a total of 20 plus taxes on record you're now feeling it
[20:20.680 --> 20:27.840]  you're now seeing it same thing with Russia so we have a lot of solidarity
[20:27.840 --> 20:31.800]  with the Russian people and the people of the EU who are being hurt by these
[20:31.800 --> 20:36.520]  sanctions it's hurting our markets but the globalists don't care because they're
[20:36.520 --> 20:40.360]  gonna be the last men standing when they consolidated the global economy and
[20:40.360 --> 20:46.640]  Putin has gone call Ray McGovern see we can get him on who I want to get an
[20:46.640 --> 20:53.880]  analyst on about this right now because if they see a missile fired to their
[20:53.880 --> 20:59.320]  territory Russia will launch on warning is the default and it will be the end of
[20:59.320 --> 21:02.800]  the world as we know it and or a large portion of the earth will die like out
[21:02.800 --> 21:08.840]  of revelations or something you don't hear a lot about America and
[21:08.840 --> 21:11.920]  revelations do you it's like we're gonna be blown away why are all the elite
[21:11.920 --> 21:14.960]  leaving the country I'm not saying this is gonna happen but let me tell you it
[21:14.960 --> 21:20.160]  is in the cards it's like Russian roulette ladies and gentlemen pun intended
[21:20.160 --> 21:24.440]  with six bullets in the chamber and the globalists are so arrogant and so full
[21:24.440 --> 21:29.760]  of bravada and hutzpah that they are rolling that cylinder and then put it
[21:29.760 --> 21:34.800]  their head and pull on the trigger and our head as well and I am sick of it I
[21:34.800 --> 21:41.400]  am sick of them rolling that cylinder put one bullet in shutting it down
[21:41.400 --> 21:47.320]  playing Russian roulette with our lives and let me tell you I've studied the
[21:47.320 --> 21:50.840]  psychology the Russians I know the CIA has the anthropologists have the
[21:50.840 --> 21:55.360]  sociologists the rest of them you had one of the former deputy heads of the CIA
[21:55.360 --> 22:00.040]  come out yesterday hit Daniels wrote about it and in full wars calm and say
[22:00.040 --> 22:04.760]  it's time for us to kill Putin or it's time for the KGB elite the FSB to kill
[22:04.760 --> 22:11.360]  him or we are going to come after you and they're taking all those rich KGB
[22:11.360 --> 22:14.880]  guys bank accounts they're messing with them they're doing dirty tricks that
[22:14.880 --> 22:19.920]  they've got black ops in Russia messing with their families trying to get the
[22:19.920 --> 22:24.720]  Russians to start a war and it is because the new world order has advanced
[22:24.720 --> 22:28.760]  weapons and things it won't matter let's say they shoot down 98% of the nuclear
[22:28.760 --> 22:38.000]  missiles Russia's got 10,000 Topol M's railway fired medium long range
[22:38.000 --> 22:45.640]  submarine launch cruise missiles wet way more than 10,000 what is one percent of
[22:45.640 --> 22:58.760]  10,000 100 100 missiles making in the average missile let's say has 10 devices
[22:58.760 --> 23:08.240]  in it 10 nerves five of them are decoys so what's five five of them are decoys
[23:08.240 --> 23:13.600]  five or warheads that's a low number some might have 20 packages 10 or warheads
[23:13.600 --> 23:21.400]  or sometimes an entire package I'll be warheads you got cruise missiles that
[23:21.400 --> 23:26.480]  come in and fire other cruise missiles off of them to basically get the
[23:26.480 --> 23:30.960]  targeting systems off so that the dummy cruise missiles bigger signatures get
[23:30.960 --> 23:38.900]  shot down I mean is this really what we want probably the subconsciously we want
[23:38.900 --> 23:43.640]  to join the 54 million aborted babies don't we subconsciously we know we're a
[23:43.640 --> 23:49.280]  wicked nation subconsciously we know we're bad subconsciously and so we're
[23:49.280 --> 23:57.480]  kind of rooting for nuclear war and the end of civilization see we have
[23:57.480 --> 24:04.480]  ancestral memories of struggle and of things being almost unsurvivable and in
[24:04.480 --> 24:12.960]  that we find our greatest greatest moments but see humans have a will to go
[24:12.960 --> 24:16.840]  into crisis it's almost an ancient form of entertainment to have to have war or
[24:16.840 --> 24:22.000]  crisis it's a bunch of drama but you can't do that with airborne Ebola you
[24:22.000 --> 24:28.120]  can't do that with airborne mousepox you can't do that with hydrogen bombs and
[24:28.120 --> 24:41.880]  x-ray lasers and super neutron based any matter reactions oh that's a highly
[24:41.880 --> 24:48.240]  classified weapons program you just heard about right there Air Force slipped
[24:48.240 --> 24:51.200]  up and gave a briefing on it San Francisco Chronicle 10 years ago look
[24:51.200 --> 24:55.480]  it up and I brought that up to nuclear engineers I know worked in the Pentagon
[24:55.480 --> 25:00.880]  they would turn white and I would bring up the any matter bombs they've got
[25:00.880 --> 25:05.320]  weapons that will destroy the whole planet just like that in fact they can't
[25:05.320 --> 25:10.000]  even test them obviously they don't know how much they would you see Star Trek
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.200]  one of the last episodes in the new Star Trek movies I think they're better than
[25:14.200 --> 25:19.120]  the old ones where they go and drop that dark matter into the center of Spock's
[25:19.120 --> 25:23.920]  planet and implodes how about the whole solar system doing that how about black
[25:23.920 --> 25:28.640]  whole weapons they invented the equations for atomic weapons max
[25:28.640 --> 25:36.120]  plank did in 1900 there is Air Force pursuing any matter weapons program was
[25:36.120 --> 25:41.400]  counted publicly then came official gag order San Francisco Chronicle 2004 I
[25:41.400 --> 25:48.760]  said 10 years ago boom photographic memory but only photographic back to a
[25:48.760 --> 25:51.440]  certain point it's not been photographic them last few years near
[25:51.440 --> 25:55.440]  photographic if I'm focused have the right nutrients but I'm 40 not supposed
[25:55.440 --> 26:00.640]  to have a photographic memory after really 30 starts degrading just saying
[26:00.640 --> 26:03.360]  I'm not making this stuff up people hear me throwing facts numbers statistics
[26:03.360 --> 26:07.200]  and how does this guy didn't know all this stuff yes I do of course I know when
[26:07.200 --> 26:12.000]  they publish a thing about any matter bombs who would not want to know that
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.680]  day I'm not bragging here I'm telling you that when Vladimir Putin says we have
[26:17.680 --> 26:28.200]  nuclear weapons back off that's what they did on 888 in August of 2008

[36:06.180 --> 36:20.040]  Selle Gehr Mr. Putin it's an educational forum but of course we follow the
[36:20.040 --> 36:23.640]  developments that are happening around the world and some of the events are
[36:23.640 --> 36:32.880]  linked to Ukraine you met with President Poroshenko in Minsk and Mr. Lavrov
[36:32.880 --> 36:41.180]  also told us about sending another humanitarian convoy and also the
[36:41.180 --> 36:47.700]  militia announced that they will continue their military operation you
[36:47.700 --> 36:55.340]  also asked the militia to provide a humanitarian corridor to avoid bloodshed
[36:55.340 --> 37:04.300]  there were also media reports about possible tougher sanctions also Russian
[37:04.300 --> 37:11.180]  servicemen were reportedly detained on the territory of Ukraine could you give
[37:11.180 --> 37:16.420]  us your take on the situation and what are the future developments in your view
[37:16.420 --> 37:26.060]  thank you let's start with our servicemen I made a statement about that you
[37:26.060 --> 37:31.300]  know Ukrainian servicemen also found themselves in the Russian territory and
[37:31.300 --> 37:38.500]  in larger numbers once we had 450 servicemen then we had another 60 and
[37:38.500 --> 37:44.700]  another 16 many of them with arms and some of them they went to Russia and
[37:44.700 --> 37:50.700]  just said you know we were lost but what we saw was that they were with the
[37:50.700 --> 37:58.660]  armoured vehicles well I do believe that they got lost we don't have clear
[37:58.660 --> 38:07.180]  demarcation in some of the areas so I think it's a purely technical issue we
[38:07.180 --> 38:13.060]  discussed that with the president of Ukraine Mr. Poroshenko and he assured
[38:13.060 --> 38:17.380]  me that the Russian soldiers will be handed over to Russia just like Russia
[38:17.380 --> 38:25.860]  handed over and hands over assessment from Ukraine that's why it was just
[38:25.860 --> 38:30.100]  released in the last 30 minutes or so that's why no major media yet has the
[38:30.100 --> 38:34.340]  specific quotes we have the text released by our team we've got our guys
[38:34.340 --> 38:40.700]  reviewing it right now we will go through this and get to the part where he
[38:40.700 --> 38:44.140]  talks about don't mess with Russia and we'll retaliate and the rest of it but
[38:44.140 --> 38:51.260]  the full transcript is on info wars.com and the video is posted there as well
[38:51.260 --> 38:54.860]  but we're gonna post it separately with the word video in the headline so folks
[38:54.860 --> 39:03.140]  can can see that if they want but no one's perfect in this whole thing Russia
[39:03.140 --> 39:06.820]  has done a lot of bad things to Ukraine but part of Ukraine has been part of
[39:06.820 --> 39:12.260]  Russia basically forever the western Ukrainians and a lot of bad stuff to
[39:12.260 --> 39:16.180]  each of Ukrainians we're not in the middle as Americans in their tribal
[39:16.180 --> 39:22.980]  sectarian warfare the EU is in there manipulating things to consolidate power
[39:22.980 --> 39:30.580]  and control that's what's happening and they want to suck that country dry
[39:30.580 --> 39:34.100]  that's why they ethnically want to bring in groups and then hype them up
[39:34.100 --> 39:39.020]  racially in the United States not to assimilate but to be their own group
[39:39.020 --> 39:43.340]  attached the Democratic Party that's race-based politics the Democrats did
[39:43.340 --> 39:47.460]  that and ran the country for over a hundred years with the Klan when Christian
[39:47.460 --> 39:51.380]  Republicans wouldn't go along with it but Martin Luther King and others that
[39:51.380 --> 39:54.100]  were Republicans and I'm not saying Republicans are perfect they're part of
[39:54.100 --> 39:57.700]  the corrupt political class the Democrats switch to racial politics with
[39:57.700 --> 40:02.380]  minorities and now they brought in a majority of minorities if there was one
[40:02.380 --> 40:05.300]  white person huddling in a corner about to be shot in the head that'd be a
[40:05.300 --> 40:10.780]  majority so this is how the political correctness works race-based politics
[40:10.780 --> 40:16.260]  but they've gotten rid of the population's immune system to this form
[40:16.260 --> 40:21.740]  of manipulation to where we just accept anything accept Obamacare a giant
[40:21.740 --> 40:26.780]  criminal operation that big corporations are exempt from that's illegal and that
[40:26.780 --> 40:30.140]  raises taxes on poor people or you're against black people because Obama's
[40:30.140 --> 40:37.500]  black and he couldn't do anything wrong this is how the system operates and
[40:37.500 --> 40:46.220]  you've got incredible war propaganda going on right now here's the headline in
[40:46.220 --> 40:53.220]  the London Telegraph from 2008 a few days after 888 when Georgia launched an
[40:53.220 --> 40:57.380]  attack on Russian held areas of Caucasian South Lusitia that have been
[40:57.380 --> 41:03.260]  Russian enclaves forever Russia threatens nuclear attack on Poland over
[41:03.260 --> 41:06.980]  US missile shield Russia threatened a nuclear strike against Poland after a
[41:06.980 --> 41:11.940]  landmark deal to cite American global anti-missile shields in its country
[41:11.940 --> 41:16.020]  because what they really are what the Pentagon admits they are is a system to
[41:16.020 --> 41:19.580]  where you can launch a nuclear attack on Russia they try to launch a response and
[41:19.580 --> 41:25.860]  the missiles shoot that down and they talk to us like children and go no it's
[41:25.860 --> 41:29.980]  to shoot down missiles of Russia shoots first of course but it's an
[41:29.980 --> 41:35.580]  escalation because you can hit Russia and then they can't respond back so it's
[41:35.580 --> 41:40.100]  a major act of war to bring anti-missile systems up to somebody's border
[41:40.100 --> 41:47.020]  imagine if Russians in Canada and Mexico were stationing these the United
[41:47.020 --> 41:54.420]  States will hit the targets we have found the clip of Putin talking about the
[41:54.420 --> 41:59.900]  response to the situation in Ukraine so here it is from the two and a half hour
[41:59.900 --> 42:05.100]  meeting we're gonna play this clip then we're gonna get this clip and excise it
[42:05.100 --> 42:09.940]  out for folks and put it up on info wars dot com but here it is what a mayor
[42:09.940 --> 42:14.860]  Putin telling NATO the West George Soros and the rest of them love him or
[42:14.860 --> 42:19.780]  hating they've got the nuclear weapons do not push us don't mess with Russia
[42:19.780 --> 42:27.940]  here is the clip historical memory is a very important component of our
[42:27.940 --> 42:36.980]  culture our history and of course we should also consider the future based on
[42:36.980 --> 42:42.540]  our historical experience in our history memory so I can tell you how to
[42:42.540 --> 42:49.940]  wait Russia is far from being involved we don't want that we're not going to do
[42:49.940 --> 42:56.860]  that of course we should always be ready to repel any aggression any attack on
[42:56.860 --> 43:03.820]  Russia regardless of the situation our partners nations are in they should
[43:03.820 --> 43:09.620]  always realize that they would be better off not messing with us talking about
[43:09.620 --> 43:14.860]  the possible a military conflict but thankfully I don't think anybody
[43:14.860 --> 43:19.260]  seriously considers the possibility of starting a military
[43:19.260 --> 43:23.540]  Russia would like to remind you that Russia is one of the biggest nuclear
[43:23.540 --> 43:30.260]  powers in our history is real and we actually strengthen our nuclear
[43:30.260 --> 43:36.780]  forces they are more compact now but they're also more efficient
[43:36.780 --> 43:48.260]  more modern they have modern weaponry and we continue to go to the future as
[43:48.260 --> 43:54.780]  well this is not to threaten anybody this just for us to feel protected and
[43:54.780 --> 44:02.180]  to implement our economic and social plans as far as cycles are concerned
[44:02.180 --> 44:12.780]  yes I think that global development is cyclical and primarily I think because
[44:12.780 --> 44:26.180]  the economy is developed cycles and this has been proven we have any
[44:26.180 --> 44:32.540]  economist present here there it is in context there's the audio there's the
[44:32.540 --> 44:37.060]  video we'll get that clip we'll have it up on info wars.com upon YouTube the
[44:37.060 --> 44:40.940]  next 30 minutes or so we have the full two plus hours up but we're gonna have
[44:40.940 --> 44:47.620]  that for everybody up updated info wars.com we're going to get that posted
[44:47.620 --> 44:52.380]  on one of our YouTube channels right now for everybody else as well your radio
[44:52.380 --> 44:59.420]  listener we do have Ray McGovern former top CIA breeder Ronald Reagan and George
[44:59.420 --> 45:08.420]  Herbert Walker Bush who was on with us on August 15th two weeks ago warning a
[45:08.420 --> 45:12.300]  little less than two weeks ago that this could lead to nuclear war and that
[45:12.300 --> 45:16.900]  it's a very real threat every major analyst I talked to people formerly in
[45:16.900 --> 45:24.300]  defense intelligence CIA professors on and off air and all the trade
[45:24.300 --> 45:29.580]  publications I read military publications Pentagon statements I mean
[45:29.580 --> 45:39.380]  this is a real push up into the border of Russia and if NATO troops start
[45:39.380 --> 45:43.260]  engaging Russian troops who feel like they're in their interest with their
[45:43.260 --> 45:47.860]  military bases their pipelines when they're trying to cut Russia off from
[45:47.860 --> 45:53.220]  Europe which will hurt Europe big time as well this isn't America where Obama
[45:53.220 --> 45:57.780]  just gets to shut down a third of our power plants and double on average our
[45:57.780 --> 46:01.220]  electricity prices in seven years this isn't America where they get to pass a
[46:01.220 --> 46:04.940]  health care law that raises seven taxes on poor people with death panels and
[46:04.940 --> 46:11.660]  death panels at the VA this is Russia we're talking about that has its own set
[46:11.660 --> 46:17.180]  of problems but their public is more informed on average you look at the
[46:17.180 --> 46:20.060]  studies on that they know geographically what's going on they
[46:20.060 --> 46:23.420]  understand that they have the memory of 20 million Russians dying in World War
[46:23.420 --> 46:31.020]  2 the Germans have it as well 20 million Germans died only five six million of
[46:31.020 --> 46:36.620]  those were were troops so governments do this they make decisions they do things
[46:36.620 --> 46:40.940]  tens of millions died overall from war and famine and the Napoleonic Wars all
[46:40.940 --> 46:45.580]  three rounds and people never think it's gonna happen until it happens and this
[46:45.580 --> 46:49.500]  time there's nuclear weapons I believe the Bible but I don't believe the
[46:49.500 --> 46:53.100]  establishment interpretations of where we all get raptured out of this no it
[46:53.100 --> 46:56.660]  says the beast wages war on the saints and overcomes them then there's a big
[46:56.660 --> 47:00.020]  revival people wake up and start repenting there's awakening around the
[47:00.020 --> 47:07.660]  world one-third of the earth's population is killed large portions of the
[47:07.660 --> 47:12.100]  earth's surface are black that's what the Bible says columns of flame bigger
[47:12.100 --> 47:19.340]  than mountains giant machines that look like insects flying around dropping
[47:19.340 --> 47:24.980]  fire on people this is what John on the Isle of Patmos saw and hey even if you
[47:24.980 --> 47:28.660]  don't believe in God or the collective consciousness or anything that matter
[47:28.660 --> 47:31.620]  boy a lot of that's coming true and it didn't want these preachers tell you
[47:31.620 --> 47:35.020]  who think they're big mega churches protect them from nuclear weapons while
[47:35.020 --> 47:41.300]  their little CIA FBI auxiliary officers riding dossiers you know up late at night
[47:41.300 --> 47:45.300]  on the on their churchgoers and you know which family they're gonna break up and
[47:45.300 --> 47:48.500]  how they're gonna get people's money and you know I mean I mean these are these
[47:48.500 --> 47:54.340]  are savage operations with just a bunch of gullible Americans just believing
[47:54.340 --> 47:58.900]  anything oh we got a great country we're the greatest in the world we're perfect
[47:58.900 --> 48:05.020]  we can do no wrong blah blah blah we are hijacked just like France was by the
[48:05.020 --> 48:09.340]  Nazis our government is a bunch of collaborators with offshore banks who
[48:09.340 --> 48:14.940]  literally are running us into the ground Russia goes you want to cut our
[48:14.940 --> 48:18.860]  pipelines off with our contracts where we sell the cheapest gas in the world
[48:18.860 --> 48:25.580]  to Europe you want to be able to drive up prices on people worldwide no we're
[48:25.580 --> 48:29.420]  gonna be competitive and the globalists and the Rothschilds and the Dutch
[48:29.420 --> 48:33.900]  royalty and the British royalty all the rest of them that are driving this they
[48:33.900 --> 48:37.500]  went we're coming into Eastern Ukraine we're taking over your oil fields and
[48:37.500 --> 48:41.140]  your gas fields that you developed and you got leases on and your pipelines that
[48:41.140 --> 48:44.660]  come out of Russia and those rich gas fields over the border and we're gonna
[48:44.660 --> 48:48.820]  give it to Joe Biden's son we're gonna give some of the stock to the British
[48:48.820 --> 48:52.940]  Royal family some of the Dutch we're gonna give Obama some Joe Biden son you
[48:52.940 --> 48:57.980]  get two billion dollars out two billion dollars worth how's that sound and
[48:57.980 --> 49:03.260]  Biden comes out goes I'm proud my son it's a good businessman yeah the Russians
[49:03.260 --> 49:10.700]  are what literally watching Joe Biden son take over their their gas so they've
[49:10.700 --> 49:15.020]  sent in special forces to protect it and they're getting killed right now
[49:15.020 --> 49:19.460]  fighting mercenaries on the CIA and there's US troops getting killed over
[49:19.460 --> 49:22.900]  there right now you better believe it so Putin goes over and plays the game
[49:22.900 --> 49:28.020]  of we've got a few soldiers over there and notice all the kids laugh they all
[49:28.020 --> 49:35.500]  understand that that Americans get told there's no two plus two equals five no
[49:35.500 --> 49:39.140]  they know it equals four so we have a few soldiers some of them got picked up
[49:39.140 --> 49:44.540]  but they're gonna be released everybody's like playing along with because
[49:44.540 --> 49:50.060]  they're giving us our own response oh there's no CIA or mercenaries attacking
[49:50.060 --> 49:54.140]  eastern Ukraine oh no and puts like oh and there's none of our troops either
[49:54.140 --> 50:00.380]  yes and he goes and this is not a threat but we have nuclear weapons that was
[50:00.380 --> 50:05.100]  this is a threat and you watch within hours his generals will come out and
[50:05.100 --> 50:12.660]  threaten to nuke Europe in the United States and remember who runs things we
[50:12.660 --> 50:16.420]  got Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan others with people like John Corzine who would
[50:16.420 --> 50:22.140]  make 40 to one bets with private bank accounts he bought a subsidiary bank and
[50:22.140 --> 50:26.620]  then most people didn't get their money back for two plus years and he didn't
[50:26.620 --> 50:30.700]  get in trouble that's how reckless and credit let me tell you the elite are

[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:35.180]  the incredible criminal history of the illegitimate run-for-profit for the
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:40.860]  offshore banks journal revenue service and I talked to senior people in the IRS
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:43.580]  in Austin one of the biggest IRS centers in the countries here and they
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:46.820]  admit it's all true and the total fraud and total scam and the ultra-rich are
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:50.820]  tax-exempt and the illegals are all allowed to be basically tax-free in
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:56.220]  many cases and the launder money and this is all just a mafia government so
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:01.540]  that's coming up I said I'd get into the open borders situation we reported on
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:06.060]  this a few days ago drudge picked it up first now it's in mainstream news today
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:11.620]  but suspects and murder of board patrol agent arrested and deported numerous
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:17.700]  times they were living illegally in Texas we reported on this yesterday
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:22.500]  actually two days ago so now it's hit national news that they have been
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.660]  deported over and over again and we're just running on robin and killing people
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:30.580]  reportedly for fun and the robin so there you go Texas eased rules for
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:33.500]  housing immigrant children they can basically do anything they want with
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:38.220]  them and have no inspections and no Congress can't get in nobody can get in
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:41.940]  overwhelmed by the arrival of thousands of undocumented immigrant children the
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:45.300]  state of Texas relaxed its standards that's called laws the legislature
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:48.740]  you're breaking the law you just say now like Obama we're relaxing standards
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:53.020]  for the shelters that house them mainly because the illegals are crapping on the
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:57.100]  floor I mean I'm sorry that's just in the news governing how much space they
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.980]  just won't use the toilet in some cases never never had a toilet I mean I don't
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:05.540]  blame them and why not the EPA does it maybe that's the new sign that you're
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:09.420]  in the end crowd you just walk into a restaurant just crapping all up crap on
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:15.460]  the table I mean why not it's racist I'll walk into a police station and just
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:19.540]  walk in and just crap right on the front desk and they're gonna go there
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:25.740]  start resting I go what I'm culturally sensitive here that was in the news
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:28.780]  last week that that's why they're having all these inspections people are
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:33.780]  getting trouble because there's just crap everywhere but easing rules governing
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:39.180]  how much space each child needs and what kind of facilities they should have
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:42.780]  maybe that'd be the new American flag is just somebody crapping on the floor I
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:46.780]  mean the EPA by the way when I said this a few months ago people thought I was
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:50.620]  joking that I mentioned it again a few days ago or last week and people were on
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:54.300]  YouTube going I thought he was joking till we flashed the article up no no no
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:03:00.340]  at EPA facilities all over the country they go the US citizens we're not just
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.520]  playing the illegals here because they grew up like in you know cardboard
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.740]  boxes I feel sorry for them they go to the bathroom at their desk and hallways
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:11.020]  and they're not just lazy and pee on the floor I mean an idiocracy you have a
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:16.060]  toilet built right under your seat that's that's that's trendy no no you got
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:20.780]  to have a hipster beard a hipster you know hipster by the way there's a new

[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:42.580]  people up arresting people it's created a giant shilling effect or even mainline
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:45.820]  Baptist churches handout letters we've shown here on air telling their
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:50.460]  practitioners when you go to a church dinner don't even talk about politics
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:55.460]  when you're having dinner well I mean the first amendment says Congress shall
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:10:01.580]  make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
[01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:06.900]  exercise of thereof and then it goes in the freedom of the press the right to
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:13.620]  assemble for redress of grievances so petitioning all of its in the first
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:17.580]  amendment more important the founders believe in the second with the two go
[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:24.180]  together like a horse and carriage like a engine and a caboose because it's the
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:30.100]  pin that is so mighty even more than the sword because the sword will fail if
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:36.420]  it's not backed up by the pin that's the info war then it on says 90% of war is
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:45.500]  now info war they say soon it'll be 90 plus percent 98% and so that's why we're
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:49.260]  going to remember what's been happening to George Hansen we're going to look
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:53.700]  back on what happened to him but first we're going to start at present times
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:59.580]  and work our way back with investigative journalist Mark Adams who again has a
[01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:03.060]  book coming out on the subject and Jesse Ventura joins us in the next hour we'll
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:07.860]  have news as it breaks as well more on the border Russia prepares large-scale

[01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:06.620]  suing the state of New York over 1.6 million in taxes and it's always the
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:10.180]  Democrats if you look at the numbers the congressman that don't pay taxes the
[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:13.820]  big rich moguls that don't pay taxes the Bill and Melinda Gates to get out of
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:17.700]  taxes the Warren Buffett's while lobbying to have poor people's taxes raised
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:22.420]  because they get it in government contracts truly a disgusting group of
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:28.100]  kleptocrats posing as loving liberals who have the moral high ground now
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:31.380]  before we go to mark Adams if you're a TV viewer we'll show you some of the
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:38.980]  photos of congressman Hanson who was tortured and that's the story that we
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:43.540]  haven't gotten to yet he was driven around his teeth knocked out he was
[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:47.900]  driven around for months they call it dieseling those aren't even the bad
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:54.740]  photos we found online until his yes they call it diesel therapy thank you
[01:12:54.740 --> 01:13:01.140]  John where where your your toes pop your legs rot your feet burst in fact the
[01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:04.340]  photos we found online aren't even the ones he sent me more than a decade ago
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:10.780]  that were just unbelievable but this is this is the type of evil that you'd
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:15.740]  imagine a communist gulag happening to Alexander Schultz and needson that goes
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:20.460]  on so he's too ill to keep fighting on but he fights on there is biographer and
[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:25.100]  researcher first I want to play a clip from the early 1990s on Geraldo Rivera
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:31.140]  with congressman Hanson when it was admitted and confirmed that he indeed
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:36.260]  had been targeted and tortured here it is but in my case I beat them on the tax
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:41.140]  matter that they tried to throw at me in fact we had a five-figure refund but
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:44.540]  they did everything they could to try to embarrass you in the middle of an
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:47.660]  election all that type of thing and then it didn't stop they tried to come at you
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:50.980]  from other directions the Federal Election Commission or or the ethics
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:55.300]  reports that you file with Congress and it didn't even matter if you went to the
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:14:00.260]  committee that handled the reports and asked them how to file the reports with
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:04.820]  two attorneys present and they filed the reports they made sure that one agency
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:08.340]  of government the one they work with the Justice Department came in and got you
[01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:11.540]  anyway even though you followed the instructions so they have a way of
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:14.780]  getting you if they don't like you and there's a whole host of stories any
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:18.460]  politician that stands in their way they're not safe either they file taxes
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:24.140]  and you wonder why people go along with the NSA's blackmailing we had William
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:28.860]  Benny on few weeks ago to say no it's confirmed they spy on the Congress and
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:33.140]  blackmail them and threaten them and then they had an intel operative come out
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:37.900]  the news and say I claimed I interviewed of someone from an intelligence
[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:43.300]  community when Bill Benny is the highest level NSA person ever go public he was
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:49.580]  number four at the NSA when he quit in October 2001 this is the shy op they run
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:53.820]  telling you there's no death panels in Obamacare telling you there's no open
[01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:59.140]  border now they admit it telling you that that you can keep your doctor telling
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:02.420]  you raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit telling you there's no
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:07.340]  tyranny they're lying to you so mark Adams I'm gonna give you the floor for
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:12.100]  the next six minutes till we go to break where should we begin currently what's
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:17.300]  happening or at the beginning well gosh thanks for having me on Alex I'll tell
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:25.740]  you it's remarkable so much of Congressman Hanson's fireball career it
[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:33.340]  directly relates now to the exposed collusion of the IRS and the Justice
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:43.420]  Department working together to try to destroy the Tea Party and for sure 2014
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:51.940]  has been a busy year for the IRS as reported in the New York Daily News on
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:16:00.660]  June 24th United States Archivist David Ferraro he testified to Congress that
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:07.460]  IRS did not follow the law when it failed to report the destruction of
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:19.260]  lowest learners emails also on June 24th it was revealed that the IRS was
[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:27.380]  forced to pay $50,000 to the National Organization for Marriage for
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:35.020]  illegally for illegally disclosing their donor list that was reported in the
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:43.540]  daily signal and then let's also remember Christine O'Donnell when it was
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:52.660]  revealed last February that the IRS illegally disclosed her confidential
[01:16:52.660 --> 01:17:01.940]  tax documents and then at the end of June June 30th the Hill newspaper
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:08.580]  published an article with this headline Senator Thune he's from South
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:17.020]  Dakota runner emails on Senator Grassley show the need for a special
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:26.140]  prosecutor and in the Hill newspaper it quotes Senator Thune he says we're all
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:35.660]  very concerned when we hear that the IRS in addition to targeting political
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:45.340]  groups may be targeting conservative senators who've been critics of the IRS
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:52.940]  well the fact is the IRS has been targeting lawmakers for a very long
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:18:04.060]  time their first victim was Senator Ed Long a Democrat from Missouri and this
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:10.580]  takes us all the way back in the 1960s when Johnson was president
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:18.660]  Senator Long sent an unprecedented three years investigating the Internal
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:26.700]  Revenue Service and he was outraged at what he discovered and he did not
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:36.300]  mince words he warned the whole country how too often the IRS acts like a
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:47.620]  sample playing upon defenseless citizens and his hearings generated a lot of
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:55.740]  press coverage because they also exposed the illegal wire tapping that was going
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:19:04.500]  on with the IRS and the FBI and in fact way back in I think it was 1967 he
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:11.940]  published a book titled the intruders that documented the government's crusade
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:18.620]  into secret and illegal surveillance absolutely I've read that book and
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:22.460]  that's cited by so many people that began to expose the NSA as well and that
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:26.220]  data is shared with all these agencies that are really mafia's to do whatever
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:30.060]  they want we're gonna go to break with investigative journalist Mark Adams I'm
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:34.060]  Alex Jones who's just joined us and come back and break this down because it's
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:40.180]  getting worse and every year the cut more and more white-collar investigators
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:44.820]  that's the headline but IRS that investigates billionaires and they only
[01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:50.020]  focus on political now so they're becoming purely political on top of it
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:52.780]  and getting away with it so what happens when they get away with
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:58.980]  persecuting people then the NSA spine you get a full-blown tyranny stay with

[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:09.340]  at my Patriots supply several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:12.460]  apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the
[01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:16.580]  charlottes willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:21.380]  company run by Patriots for Patriots was born my Patriots supply has never

[01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:19.900]  everybody knew you didn't give no lift to the big John
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:34.300]  big John big John big bad John big John nobody seemed to know where John
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:40.240]  calls home. So what we have going on here is a rain of terror and it's
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.060]  intensifying I saw in the Wall Street Journal just a few months ago where they
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:50.620]  cut even more of the white-collar fraud investigators across federal agencies
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:57.540]  like the Election Commission the commissions that look at the stocks and
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:05.100]  bonds the IRS the IRS will let one house in Austin get 80 something million
[01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:10.060]  dollars over several years of fake tax returns obviously it's being laundered
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:15.660]  the Democratic Party and others it's not a house of four or five illegals
[01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:23.020]  getting that same thing in Atlanta Georgia Los Angeles California it's
[01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:26.580]  there though to tell churches you can't have free speech and speak out against
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:33.500]  abortion when that's not even a law but just like the mafia can threaten to
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:44.220]  break your legs and it's illegal but still a lot of people buckle to them so
[01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:47.780]  we'll get into Congress from Hanson's story and we'll go back and look at the
[01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:51.420]  hearings that exposed it and what happened to him specifically and then
[01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:55.460]  move forward but it's just important to understand this is a rain of terror and
[01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:59.700]  giving into it only makes it get worse the answer to their chilling effect and
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:05.340]  their intimidation is to get more vocal against them to get more aggressive
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:11.620]  and to let the politicos that come after you know that when they try to set you
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:15.420]  up Eric Holder may get out of it but they're not gonna get out of it you're
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:19.500]  gonna sue them forever you're gonna dig into their background their other
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:24.060]  cases and just like the Michael Mortensen case you're gonna end up sending
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:28.700]  them to jail it may take ten years but I've always warned the government
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:32.900]  everybody else I know I'm clean and if anybody ever sets me up or tries
[01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:37.220]  anything I am gonna make your life miserable by the full extent of the law
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:43.700]  forever and I've got lawyers and a trust set up my money had set up on a jet
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:47.900]  airplane my money had to set up to live in a big house it's set up to take care
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:51.900]  of my kids a little bit of money I got and to make whoever kills me or whoever
[01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:58.220]  sets me up their life a living hell I don't mean to go off on a jag but I've
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:02.340]  talked to so many top lawyers here on the air don't want to get that top EPA
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:06.900]  lawyer on and the FDA lawyer he does both I forget his name he's the one
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:10.460]  top lawyer in the country we had him on and he's won a whole bunch of cases
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:14.780]  against the FDA EPA you name it when they're bullying people for no reason and
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:18.700]  he said look we go after the judges and the prosecutors for the crimes they've
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:22.580]  committed and all the money they're getting from the companies themselves
[01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:26.340]  this is a mafia they shut it down real quick that's the only way to beat the
[01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:30.780]  feds in federal court that's why they got a 97 98% conviction rate because it's
[01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:39.140]  a mafia folks but you start investigating the the the the lifestyle of
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:44.020]  the people that set you up oh they quit real fast I'm sorry we got a long
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:47.100]  segment coming up I'm eating up your segment here mark get back to that
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:50.780]  member of the Congress who was getting into this in their book the intruders
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:56.580]  and then move forward to what it's grown into today yes well here's how they set
[01:27:56.580 --> 01:28:05.260]  center Ed Longa Bill Lambert was an associate editor at Life Magazine and
[01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:12.460]  he was contacted by an official in the Justice Department who were closely
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:21.580]  with the IRS and this official promised Lambert a big juicy story about
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:33.740]  the crusading senator and it was the May 1967 issue of Life Magazine published
[01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:42.300]  an article that made the outrageous accusation that Senator Long's hearings
[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:47.380]  which were exposing obviously illegal wiretapping they in fact interfered
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:54.740]  with the government's investigation of organized crime the article also accused
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:29:05.180]  Senator Long of collecting $48,000 in bribe payoffs now long he of course denied
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:12.740]  the accusations and as for the $48,000 that was a legal finders fee from an
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:19.940]  attorney in Missouri money which in fact he had reported to the IRS and he
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:27.540]  documented the trail of payments later that summer 1967 a Senate
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:34.620]  investigation committee cleared Senator Long of any wrong but it shows the
[01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:38.460]  incredible dirty tricks that scare everybody else off and we're showing

[01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:23.580]  fans that set up fan sites on Facebook pretty early on that's why we have three
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:29.380]  million folks that like us on Facebook about 900,000 on one and he had all the
[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:32.620]  others together it's about three million that's because we got there early one
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:36.260]  thing I noticed about the internet it's important to get there early and some new
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:40.900]  platform comes out if you get to you know one of these sites late it's it's not
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:45.420]  as easy to dominate it of course we've dominated YouTube we got to that not
[01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:54.460]  really early but but but not late we got to about about 2005 right when it got
[01:34:54.460 --> 01:35:00.660]  sold to Google we were on it before I got sold to Google whenever that was and
[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:06.700]  obviously on one channel we didn't we didn't set our channel up till 2009 or
[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:13.020]  so and that one has 400 and something million but all put together 800 million
[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:18.180]  on big channels alone of people that have seen our videos and that's just big
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:21.660]  channels I can't even track all the others and I'm not tooting our horn I'm
[01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:28.740]  saying people are awake liberty is popular and now the IRS has been exposed
[01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:33.860]  being political going after people who are innocent but it's a fraud to begin
[01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:38.700]  with didn't get set up till 1913 the average American didn't pay money to the
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:45.300]  IRS till the 1950s and here's a here's a headline for the New York Times in
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:52.820]  2000 April 16th IRS more likely to audit the poor and not the rich and since
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:55.980]  then I've seen that headline over and over again where it were I mean there's
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:36:03.700]  not auditors for Warren Buffett boys and girls but if you own a car dealership
[01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:06.860]  you're getting audited every year if you own a restaurant you're getting on every
[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:11.100]  year that's what the poor people think are rich people or if you make $20,000 a
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:17.140]  year 30,000 those audits went up in 2013 they reported this year and of rich
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:21.420]  went down even more but I'm ranting I want to give Mark Adams investigative
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:25.860]  journalist the floor and then a new article that just went live on info
[01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:33.660]  wars.com North Carolina sheriff to residents fight back against crime by
[01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:39.140]  taking up arms and he goes on to say crime is exploding in their county due
[01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:42.860]  to the illegal alien crime wave the economy being bad and that's the truth
[01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:47.460]  crime has gone down since 1992 with the end of the crack cocaine epidemic
[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:51.660]  I remember when I was a kid growing up in Dallas there'd be sometimes four
[01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:57.060]  murders a day five murders a day I remember hearing you know 20 murders in
[01:36:57.060 --> 01:37:00.660]  the last three days over the weekend Dallas had the highest crime rate
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:04.220]  worse than Chicago when I was growing up but it was more than that they think
[01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:07.980]  it was the lead in the fuel made people violent or something I mean you know I
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:11.020]  grew up where if you looked at somebody wrong they would just jump out of their
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:14.300]  truck while it was moving and just run towards you I mean it was just like
[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:18.660]  just like fist fights constantly people get I mean I live in a nice
[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:23.980]  neighborhood and and and people were shooting each other and stuff sometimes
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:29.060]  you know it was like wife shooting husbands you name it just crazy stuff
[01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:32.900]  but I don't know why I'm going off on that jag the point is since guns became
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:37.140]  so incredibly popular and concealed carry came out that the FBI even admits
[01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:40.460]  that's one of the largest reasons crimes gone down also taking lead out of the
[01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:45.100]  fuel let'll make you a mad dog folks that was a big part of why the US was so
[01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:48.900]  violent because we would let the fuel a lot of their folks ban that before we
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:53.340]  ever did but so I give that to the left who always talks about crime dropping
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:57.820]  being fuel that's part of it but the guns are the biggest because lead was out
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:03.020]  for a long time crime went down some and then down even more by the mid 90s 2000
[01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:06.780]  and through that when the lead had already been out by the 80s but I'm
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:12.180]  gonna go back to my guess you know how I love factoids but now because of the
[01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:16.260]  economy being in a depression in most areas and and methamphetamine and the
[01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:24.620]  rest of it crime muggings shootings people knocking out the window in your
[01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:27.700]  car people stealing your bag when you go to the bathroom at the restaurant
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:32.980]  petty crime is off the charts and what's happening is people trying to car
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:36.340]  jack car jacks coming back it's not as bad as it was since concealed carry came
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:39.980]  in but it's coming back they're just getting killed muggings are going up
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:43.380]  they're getting killed so the sheriff we're gonna play the clip after our
[01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:49.020]  guest leaves us and Ventura joins us he says get guns learn how to use them
[01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:52.420]  because the sheriff's department is overwhelmed and departments are saying
[01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:57.500]  this everywhere start shooting these people somebody tries to mug you try to
[01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:00.700]  break in your car grab the revolvers shove it in their chest pull the trigger
[01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:06.940]  till they're dead till they're off of you and that'll teach all these people to
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:09.980]  go out and get a job and work and not go around knocking people on the head
[01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:15.580]  let's go ahead and go back to our guest mark Adams the investigative
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:19.660]  journalist who's writing a book about congressman George Hanson who was
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:23.780]  arrested tortured he's getting into earlier congressmen and senators that
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:28.140]  were persecuted they don't want to get into his torture and when your book is

[01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:51.900]  retraction even though it was proven that he was innocent of those charges that
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:40:02.940]  were put forth in the article well on August 6th 1968 46 years ago today the
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:12.100]  IRS commissioner Sheldon Cohen called Bill Lambert the associate editor at
[01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:19.740]  Life magazine to offer them his congratulations and by the way we're
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:26.580]  showing the New York Times article as you speak go ahead yes now Bernard
[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:32.380]  Fensterwald he was chief counsel to Senator Long's committee he also did
[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:39.860]  not mince words he came right out and warned senators and congressmen who are
[01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:48.740]  not scared of looking into the IRS have to be crazy because the IRS will just
[01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:53.940]  rule your career and they should have all gotten together as a coalition
[01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:58.220]  against cowardice and all come out or even 30 or 40 then they couldn't bring
[01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:02.660]  them all down but instead cowards all sit down while great men like congressman
[01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:09.080]  Hansen are tortured yes well one senator who came forward was senator
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:15.460]  choice of Joseph Montoya he was a Democrat from New Mexico he chaired the
[01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:23.700]  IRS appropriations subcommittee and in 1972 he started aligning up witnesses
[01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:32.700]  to testify before his subcommittee about IRS atrocities well in 1975 he was
[01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:46.260]  Sam baked when IRS operatives colluded with Bob Woodward and Washington Post IRS
[01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:54.020]  chief blocks audit of Montoya's taxes but well that was the screaming
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:42:04.060]  headline on the October 19th 1975 edition of the Washington Post and that
[01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:09.580]  article by Bob Woodward it's got all the appearances of a real work of
[01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:17.380]  sabotage right there at the beginning of the article Woodward states that Montoya
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:25.340]  senator Montoya had been twice recommended for prosecution because he
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:31.060]  allegedly failed the file returns going back to World War two they were looking
[01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:42.580]  at 1945 and 1946 but then four paragraphs later Woodward writes there is no
[01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:48.020]  evidence that Montoya has illegally evaded taxes for those that don't know
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:51.860]  Bob Woodward I'm not defending Nixon was naval intelligence and that was a
[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:55.900]  total setup they were giving him all the intel to bring down the presidency to
[01:42:55.900 --> 01:43:02.140]  bring in a soft cue of bureaucrats so anytime Woodward or Bernstein especially
[01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:06.380]  Woodward are involved in something you got to look out well yes in fact what
[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:12.980]  Montoya was doing was he was making people nervous he was going full throttle to
[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:21.860]  again show America how the IRS behaves like a Gestapo playing on defenseless
[01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:29.780]  Americans now remember in 1968 the IRS finally got rid of senator long now just
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:36.220]  four years later senator Montoya is in hard pursuit Woodward doesn't mention
[01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:42.660]  any of this boss he says in this article is he Montoya is well known on
[01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:49.340]  Capitol Hill for his active interest in IRS matters of course he has an active
[01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:53.780]  interest in IRS matters he's the one who chairs there the subcommittee that
[01:43:53.780 --> 01:44:00.100]  oversees the IRS yeah the headline should be IRS persecuting Congress IRS
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:05.500]  going after their bosses IRS in political sabotage of those that would
[01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:09.660]  bring him to justice IRS tries to block congressional prosecutor that's what's
[01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:15.900]  really going on well in fact in 1972 when Montoya was really getting serious
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:23.460]  of looking into the IRS that's when the IRS district director in New Mexico
[01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:34.900]  decided to start investigating Montoya then in December 1972 an IRS member
[01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:40.020]  random was issued by IRS chief intelligence division this is in San
[01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:49.660]  Francisco and that memorandum branded senator Montoya as a tax protester and
[01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:56.980]  they further smeared him as one who would advocate violence against revenue
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:45:01.140]  and we're showing that memo right now so if you're on the committee to control
[01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:04.860]  the IRS and you don't like them abusing old ladies and taking their houses
[01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:09.820]  you're a tax protester because you're exposing this criminal organization that
[01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:13.780]  was the position of the IRS now now now we're gonna have you back for a second
[01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:16.380]  interview obviously to go over more of this or a nightly news because you've
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:19.580]  sent us so many documents I want to do an interview when your book comes out as
[01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:23.780]  well sir but first off we got a lot of ground to cover with Congressman Hansen
[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:29.220]  but you're showing the pattern here that links up with today of why Congress
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:35.420]  won't do anything to the IRS yes now what's interesting here is it was later
[01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:42.180]  exposed well this is more than 10 years later that one of the IRS operatives that
[01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:52.420]  was used against Montoya was later used against senator Hansen T that person's
[01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:59.260]  name is ever and right he was transferred this is now in 1975 he was
[01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:05.940]  transferred from Albuquerque to Salt Lake City so they have to find
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:11.260]  specialist goons to target good people even in these rogue agencies they find
[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:17.660]  specialist hit men to do these political jobs yes and when he arrived in Salt Lake
[01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:25.300]  City ever ride was now promoted to IRS intelligence chief oh he was
[01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:35.260]  collaborating with IRS district director Howard Martin and they used the same
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:43.380]  blueprint that destroyed Senator Montoya and Senator Long only this time the
[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:48.340]  target was Congressman George Hansen let's talk about what they did to him
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:57.820]  okay this is an election year 1976 and in that summer there was a fateful event
[01:46:57.820 --> 01:47:05.980]  the Teton dam burst and as a result of that a lot of Idaho citizens and
[01:47:05.980 --> 01:47:13.740]  businessmen lost everything they had Congressman Hansen led the battle to
[01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:22.180]  secure over 400 million dollars and flood damage reimbursements but before the
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:29.380]  waters barely even subsided the other side of government showed up what
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:37.100]  happened next truly warps the mind agents from the IRS swooped down on the
[01:47:37.100 --> 01:47:45.260]  flood victims with plans to tax their government relief payments Congressman
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:54.100]  Hansen bought them on that tooth and nail he called it a flood tax then three
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:48:00.220]  weeks before election day a scandalous article appears in the Lewiston
[01:48:00.220 --> 01:48:06.980]  morning tribute and with lots of supporting detail the article alleged
[01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:17.380]  that Congressman Hansen was not paying his taxes now here because of a courageous
[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:23.100]  IRS whistleblower named Paul Defosas a lot of these players have been
[01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:28.820]  identified like I said there was on the IRS intelligence chief Evan Ride there
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:35.340]  was the district chief Howard Martin well Evan Ride was contacted by Robert
[01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:41.780]  Huntley he was the campaign treasurer to Stan Kress Stan Kress was the
[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:48.300]  Democrat candidate who opposed George Hansen and information I should say
[01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:54.380]  misinformation lies were provided to Robert Huntley and then those were used
[01:48:54.380 --> 01:49:00.620]  against Congressman Hansen by Stan Kress and a debate that was being held at
[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:05.580]  Idaho State University so that's key first they discredit you they have
[01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:10.380]  mainstream media put out this info on you then they come out and indict you for
[01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:15.620]  something and then they try to break you torturing you in the dungeons yes there
[01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:21.660]  was also a clandestine meeting with in the offices of professor a history
[01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:29.780]  professor Richard Starling's at Rick's College he was the campaign manager for
[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:36.620]  Stan Kress well Richard Starling's is now running for Congress from the Idaho
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:39.700]  second district
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:45.740]  well is he running as a Republican or a Democrat Democrat unbelievable that
[01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:51.660]  needs to be known yes indeed now what happened here though if George Hansen is
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:58.740]  interesting unlike Senator Ed Long unlike Senator Joseph Montoya George
[01:49:58.740 --> 01:50:09.900]  Hansen survived the sabotage and he won reelection afterwards the IRS struck
[01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:16.980]  again now they put Congressman Hansen through the ringer with a criminal
[01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:24.420]  audit it was a grooving audit it was being conducted by the criminal
[01:50:24.420 --> 01:50:29.740]  investigation division of the IRS which is hanging out meeting with a guy that
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:37.940]  ran against him yes but once again IRS mere tactics grew up in their face after
[01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:45.580]  months of order team it was determined that the government old Congressman
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:50.100]  Hansen a refund but it doesn't matter with the IRS there's not just double
[01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:53.900]  jeopardy there's triple jeopardy and soon they'll get in their hands on him
[01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:57.820]  and get him in a dungeon we'll be back with the criminal foreign bankers that

[01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:13.940]  up what happened to him his rejuvenation powers are remarkable he has many many
[01:56:13.940 --> 01:56:22.300]  medical afflictions but his mind is hyper razor sharp and he fights on and
[01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:28.980]  gosh there is so much that has happened to George Hanson twice he has been
[01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:37.500]  illegally railroaded to prison the first time on the United States Marshals got
[01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:47.180]  their hands on him he was giving a speech somewhere in the Midwest and they
[01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:57.900]  hired a private rear jet to pick him up flew him to National Airport booked him
[01:56:57.900 --> 01:57:05.980]  into the Alexandria County jail under the alias Fred Smith to hide him from his
[01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:12.940]  family in France the second time when they got their hands on him that's when
[01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:19.260]  they dragged him all over the country in chains with the black box attached to the
[01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:23.300]  chains to interfere with your circulation to cause those horrible
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:28.420]  injuries that you enumerated earlier let's be clear they grabbed a congressman
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:33.180]  like rendition yeah through him on a jet and flew him off I mean this is the
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:37.380]  mafia that is our government no one is safe from these narcotics trafficking
[01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:43.220]  murderers indeed they can do it to a congressman they can do it to anybody
[01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:47.500]  and really that's the headline you know the true story of a congressman that was
[01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:55.180]  kidnapped yes indeed that's exactly what happened once finally he was tracked
[01:57:55.180 --> 01:58:00.860]  down there was a whole cot array of congressmen and senators that got a
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:05.980]  hold of Ed Meese demanding answers but really the whole thing was just
[01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:12.900]  effectively covered up and people wonder why Congress is scared and bends over
[01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:18.020]  it's because the guy can be found not guilty twice the next time they grab
[01:58:18.020 --> 01:58:21.620]  him and they just disappear him he beats that so then they grab him again and

[02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:55.100]  debt is inevitable yeah we were maneuvered to this point when those of us that
[02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:58.860]  said don't do it you're a conspiracy theorist because you have top economists
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:06.980]  on you know and I was so thankful three weeks ago when Drudge linked to a lot
[02:01:06.980 --> 02:01:16.420]  of info wars calm stories not because it sent traffic to my website and that's
[02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:23.300]  that's that's part of it but because the story then broke and it forced a
[02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:27.060]  national debate to begin which the White House came out and said this is not
[02:01:27.060 --> 02:01:34.740]  happening we're not letting illegals in and because you didn't have amnesty this
[02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:37.660]  is now happen the answer is legalize everybody and that'll make everybody
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:43.020]  stop coming what yeah we're gonna legalize bank robbing that'll make bank
[02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:48.740]  robbery stop I mean it's it's it's just it's insane it would increase bank robbery
[02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:54.500]  just so you know and it's a system run by criminals for criminals it's like
[02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:58.100]  where they say you can't have a gun to defend yourself at your bank or your
[02:01:58.100 --> 02:02:02.060]  business but the police aren't gonna respond when you get robbed I mean that's
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:06.340]  what this is give us your guns America and we're gonna let the dregs of the
[02:02:06.340 --> 02:02:10.020]  world come here and just walk across the border and we'll put them on a bus and
[02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:15.100]  bus them right into the middle of the country national suicide and I know I
[02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:27.540]  keep going back to that over and over again but I was complaining earlier last
[02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:32.340]  week that you know the national media was spinning and lying with our story
[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:37.820]  about the border being wide open but why was I complaining they ignored the
[02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:44.540]  border patrol president and they ignored the vice president saying there's an
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:52.340]  open stand down that's the quote there is a stand down there is no border they're
[02:02:52.340 --> 02:02:55.700]  told citizens to come back through look and see if they've got row him and all
[02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:59.940]  in the car arrest some college kids all we're allowed to do is arrest college
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:07.740]  kids and we don't we want to do it because you because they are not allowed
[02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:12.100]  to enforce the law they enforce the criminal hatred that the globalist have
[02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:18.260]  for America and for anybody that's American because in these wars if you
[02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:24.820]  study history the globalist hate the seed of America they hate the culture the
[02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:29.020]  idea not of all the bad things America's done but the the good things
[02:03:29.020 --> 02:03:33.300]  America did were so revolutionary everyone in the world wanted to come here
[02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:47.140]  it was special it's that quote in from last of the Mohicans right towards the
[02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:55.780]  end in the fight scene where the two you know alpha Native Americans battle to
[02:03:55.780 --> 02:04:03.980]  the death and he says to him I'm gonna kill you and I'm gonna kill your daughters
[02:04:03.980 --> 02:04:11.260]  and I'm gonna wipe your seed off the face of this earth that's real power
[02:04:11.260 --> 02:04:15.340]  folks the globalist aren't just attacking humans they're attacking the
[02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:20.140]  trees they're attacking the fish the amphibians every they're genetically
[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:32.220]  re-engineering everything with horrible consequences and then they run the
[02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:39.340]  environmental movement again so we're all distracted onto what plants breathe
[02:04:39.340 --> 02:04:43.900]  as the scourge not just the hundreds of horrible things that are going on
[02:04:43.900 --> 02:04:50.500]  that's what I'm saying folks I mean it's like the elite are evil space aliens
[02:04:50.500 --> 02:04:55.780]  coming to destroy us I mean they're that bad I mean they really are that bad we

[02:08:37.140 --> 02:08:43.500]  discovered a lot of the crimes being conducted by offshore anti-free market
[02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:48.100]  corporate interest through governments in an attempt to shut down free markets
[02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:53.060]  while blaming free markets for their kleptocratic brand of socialism on the
[02:08:53.060 --> 02:08:58.660]  bottom to domesticate the public fascism sitting on top now I've used my own
[02:08:58.660 --> 02:09:05.420]  geopolitical terms married them with husband them with already existing terms
[02:09:05.420 --> 02:09:14.860]  and I have to say much of what I have put into common parlance is now now part
[02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:26.700]  of the common nomenclature and that shows that those of us that don't want to go
[02:09:26.700 --> 02:09:34.660]  along with them globalist can defeat them if one guy from Texas can reach
[02:09:34.660 --> 02:09:37.580]  three million four million people a day fifteen twenty million people a week
[02:09:37.580 --> 02:09:42.460]  conservatively what can you do in your area and I don't want to start this
[02:09:42.460 --> 02:09:46.460]  interview talking about myself but I never got this earlier because I got my
[02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:50.060]  flight got canceled last night getting back in the country and then I was late
[02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:52.300]  an hour into the show getting here is want to make this point we're going to
[02:09:52.300 --> 02:10:00.100]  our guests and I want to ask him this up front but when I say it's the best of
[02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:03.820]  times worst of times we're getting some good Supreme Court rulings a lot of them
[02:10:03.820 --> 02:10:10.140]  not just the fact that you can have companies that don't pay for abortions
[02:10:10.140 --> 02:10:14.940]  basically like hobby lobby and we're seeing some other good rulings out of
[02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:21.380]  them and we're seeing more and more people talk about crony capitalism versus
[02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:28.220]  real capitalism we're seeing billionaires come out and and and and more and
[02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:33.220]  more tell it like it is people like Donald Trump saying that prepare for
[02:10:33.220 --> 02:10:39.420]  financial ruin and we're seeing more and more the media even MSNBC and CNN and
[02:10:39.420 --> 02:10:43.820]  because you see NBC they'll say oh yeah there are crony capitalists that like
[02:10:43.820 --> 02:10:49.620]  wrecking things I mean folks are starting to get a basic self-preservation
[02:10:49.620 --> 02:10:59.660]  instinct and people better because here's the big issue if for three weeks
[02:10:59.660 --> 02:11:05.780]  Congress is the national review has published with a letter by representative
[02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:13.700]  from Oklahoma if members of Congress aren't allowed in to these military
[02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:17.700]  bases and there's private security strutting around and they've detained
[02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:22.740]  our reporters for even trying to go shoot video through the fence and you've
[02:11:22.740 --> 02:11:26.420]  got a culture of total lying and they're bussing the illegals in that don't even
[02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:32.620]  have skills they don't even still workers criminals you name it the question is
[02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:37.820]  what comes next well here's another issue for the establishment this one
[02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:43.540]  bring up with mr. Dent who's about to join us you've got all this craziness
[02:11:43.540 --> 02:11:47.860]  going on a lot of good things happening also a lot of bad things happening but
[02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:52.460]  the establishment acts like they don't care like they know something we don't
[02:11:52.460 --> 02:11:57.620]  know and they're just invincible I mean Obama in the first campaign and again
[02:11:57.620 --> 02:12:03.020]  the last campaign took about a third of his donations offshore through websites
[02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:07.580]  with even fake names and stuff each case of felony and never gotten trouble I
[02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:10.860]  mean that's just one example of the legions of crimes that are going on
[02:12:10.860 --> 02:12:19.340]  while they then use the IRS to persecute you know the institutes and
[02:12:19.340 --> 02:12:23.220]  things that promote conservative financial ideas or pro-life groups it's
[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:28.340]  real tyranny is what I'm saying and then meanwhile I'm in the airport yesterday
[02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:35.940]  to see this dichotomy in Houston and I go to the TSA and I don't want to be put
[02:12:35.940 --> 02:12:39.020]  the naked body scanner so they get all angry at me and act like I've done
[02:12:39.020 --> 02:12:42.100]  something wrong and then I explain to them that they know full well it's all
[02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:49.260]  fraud and they basically let me through and then I go through customs and the
[02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:53.460]  guy's a listener and said he only got the job because you know he had family
[02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:57.500]  died 9-11 he's retired military and then he knows the whole things fraud and
[02:12:57.500 --> 02:13:01.580]  government runs ISIS and yeah they put an X on your thing here to be searched
[02:13:01.580 --> 02:13:05.740]  and harassed but this is all a load of crap I'm sending you through you have no
[02:13:05.740 --> 02:13:10.780]  criminal record I listen to your show every day by the way I was waiting for
[02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:13.380]  what happened there I even recorded it I don't think I'm gonna air it don't want
[02:13:13.380 --> 02:13:18.140]  to get the guy in trouble the point is is that he he said yeah the machines are
[02:13:18.140 --> 02:13:21.980]  taking over that program machine that we don't even know who put stuff in it
[02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:27.540]  tries to keep you name it from from from even coming into the country he goes
[02:13:27.540 --> 02:13:30.940]  congressman have trouble getting back in the country you have trouble getting
[02:13:30.940 --> 02:13:33.900]  back in the country but the illegals can come right in you see that's why they
[02:13:33.900 --> 02:13:38.500]  want computers in there show that it's all centralized and people can't say
[02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:41.540]  no to the tyranny but but there was that dichotomy and then when I was in the
[02:13:41.540 --> 02:13:48.740]  Caribbean in places like Grand Cayman I mean I was mobbed more than even I am
[02:13:48.740 --> 02:13:53.500]  in Austin Texas I mean mobbed by the people at the hotel mobbed at other
[02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:57.780]  hotels by the staff I went to the Ritz Carlton for dinner I was some friends
[02:13:57.780 --> 02:14:06.380]  just incredible just just everywhere I went at the airports the police were
[02:14:06.380 --> 02:14:11.300]  listeners it was just completely blowing me away that they all got it on that
[02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:16.820]  island so there is hope because I'm not bragging hey Alex Jones is a big deal
[02:14:16.820 --> 02:14:23.060]  I'm saying liberty is popular legalizing freedom is popular as Ron Paul
[02:14:23.060 --> 02:14:29.860]  says and we're selling snow cones in hell they're selling lighting people on
[02:14:29.860 --> 02:14:33.860]  fire on the fourth of July people don't want to be burned up folks they want a
[02:14:33.860 --> 02:14:39.140]  snow cone and and and the system is creating a hell right now we're joined
[02:14:39.140 --> 02:14:44.380]  for the rest of the hour by Harry Dent he's the best-selling author made a lot
[02:14:44.380 --> 02:14:51.060]  of accurate predictions of course was a top analyst for Bain Capital and he's
[02:14:51.060 --> 02:14:54.620]  been on the show four or five times as popular guests we appreciate him coming
[02:14:54.620 --> 02:14:58.380]  back on his new books out he's offering our listeners it's not nice thing to
[02:14:58.380 --> 02:15:05.580]  sit along at a Harry Dent calm forward slash Alex Jones a free chapter from
[02:15:05.580 --> 02:15:08.780]  his book and more with some of the key charts and things we're gonna be showing
[02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:13.300]  here today and I want to get into that with him I want to debate inflation
[02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:16.140]  deflation with him not that I even disagree with him but I want to go
[02:15:16.140 --> 02:15:19.980]  through these nuances with a technical guy just with my layman view maybe he
[02:15:19.980 --> 02:15:24.260]  can explain some of these paradoxes to me but first the last five minutes you
[02:15:24.260 --> 02:15:28.660]  heard me break down to some of my experiences being out of the country
[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:31.740]  coming back to the country the borders wide open the government pays the
[02:15:31.740 --> 02:15:35.940]  ship the illegals in on the buses we have video of it and them admitting it
[02:15:35.940 --> 02:15:40.060]  Obama won't admit it and says it's ridiculous we should have amnesty to
[02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:46.860]  fix this when they already are causing it by giving them fiat amnesty people are
[02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:50.060]  waking up but still things are getting worse the elite are acting like they
[02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:54.020]  don't care in five minutes before we go to break or I'll skip the break explain
[02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:57.860]  to me your perspective on what's happening I mean is this like Caligula
[02:15:57.860 --> 02:16:01.860]  marrying his horse our Nero committing suicide I mean is the elite going
[02:16:01.860 --> 02:16:07.380]  insane like Hitler attacking Russia or or is there some method to this Mr.
[02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:11.620]  Dent well I know there's not to me like like he said before people are
[02:16:11.620 --> 02:16:16.180]  destroying natural systems the free market capitalism is a natural organic
[02:16:16.180 --> 02:16:21.060]  biological system that needs the dynamics of opposites it is being
[02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:25.820]  over managed they're trying to run the economy like it's a machine you know
[02:16:25.820 --> 02:16:29.300]  they're not they don't we have the worst immigration policies in the world I've
[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:33.620]  just back from Australia in February about to go back in July again they have
[02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:37.180]  the best immigration policies in the world and you know you have to be
[02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:41.820]  qualified to get in they attract the people they want you don't you can't
[02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:44.500]  just run across the borders they surrounded by an oceans that makes a
[02:16:44.500 --> 02:16:47.900]  little easier for them we've got horrible immigration policies but we have
[02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:52.140]  even worse financial policies the government is basically running our
[02:16:52.140 --> 02:16:56.660]  economy now unlike artificial drugs and that never works out well they're not
[02:16:56.660 --> 02:17:01.740]  allowing debts to rebalance they're not allowing bubbles to rebalance and the
[02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:04.420]  economy to rebalance they're just saying the economy can't slow down they've
[02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:09.740]  taken over the economy and again trying to run it like it's an inorganic
[02:17:09.740 --> 02:17:14.980]  machine which is not so you know I hear all stuff you say about you know
[02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:20.140]  pollution in the environment you know modified foods well I mean I just
[02:17:20.140 --> 02:17:24.300]  listen to the guy saying you know our intestines are all screwed up because we
[02:17:24.300 --> 02:17:28.620]  overused drugs and antibiotics so much that we've killed all the good bacteria
[02:17:28.620 --> 02:17:33.540]  while fighting the bad I mean we don't have enough respect for the wisdom of
[02:17:33.540 --> 02:17:37.980]  natural systems Adam Smith said it you know the invisible hand how our economy
[02:17:37.980 --> 02:17:41.860]  runs from the bottoms up if you just set some good rules and let it let
[02:17:41.860 --> 02:17:46.020]  innovation happen and let booms and busts happen and let inflation and
[02:17:46.020 --> 02:17:51.780]  deflation happen and in my work inflation and deflation are the critical
[02:17:51.780 --> 02:17:57.060]  incentives for innovation and if you don't allow this to happen and most the
[02:17:57.060 --> 02:18:01.500]  innovations happen in bus not in boom and then they come into our economy in
[02:18:01.500 --> 02:18:06.900]  the boom so I economists to me politicians do not understand our economy
[02:18:06.900 --> 02:18:10.980]  they have kind of hijacked it they are running it for elite interest the top
[02:18:10.980 --> 02:18:17.580]  1% has run away with almost all the gains now for decades and by keeping this
[02:18:17.580 --> 02:18:22.540]  bubble going after creating the greatest bubble in history debt and and
[02:18:22.540 --> 02:18:26.380]  financial assets the government's only policies to keep the bubble going
[02:18:26.380 --> 02:18:33.420]  forever it keeps the top 1% making outsized games it clusters all this
[02:18:33.420 --> 02:18:38.940]  inequality and polarization society it's the worst economic policies I've ever
[02:18:38.940 --> 02:18:42.980]  seen in history and that tells me that it's going to end badly and of course
[02:18:42.980 --> 02:18:46.540]  I've been warning you the last few times on your show as well that the Dow's
[02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:51.420]  going to get to somewhere like 17,000 where it is recently and by the way
[02:18:51.420 --> 02:18:54.420]  you said that just about a month and a half ago on the show people can go back
[02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:58.500]  to it that didn't come true and in fact you don't like to brag folks go to your
[02:18:58.500 --> 02:19:02.300]  website and see some of the past reports Harry dent calm but but tell some of the
[02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:05.660]  people after some of the predictions you've made that have been spot on me
[02:19:05.660 --> 02:19:10.100]  you do have a very accurate prediction background here that's who we have on
[02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:13.540]  the show people that are accurate I mean you can tune into CNBC most days and
[02:19:13.540 --> 02:19:17.260]  just get a bunch of bull because because they're being literally told to put that
[02:19:17.260 --> 02:19:20.260]  out I've talked some behind the scenes they would lose their jobs like you know
[02:19:20.260 --> 02:19:26.380]  Dylan Radigan or whatever if they don't play ball so so so recap for folks some
[02:19:26.380 --> 02:19:29.220]  of the big predictions you've made that came true well first of all you know the
[02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:32.940]  biggest tool we use of many is demographics we know exactly when
[02:19:32.940 --> 02:19:36.620]  people buy the most cars houses when they spend the most money borrow the most
[02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:41.260]  pay for babysitting you name it there's almost nothing I don't know about the
[02:19:41.260 --> 02:19:46.140]  life cycle of consumers and consumers are 70% of our GDP and businesses who
[02:19:46.140 --> 02:19:50.380]  invest when consumers are growing or another 10 governments only 20 thank God
[02:19:50.380 --> 02:19:56.380]  so we use demographics to predict trends in when I first got these tools in late
[02:19:56.380 --> 02:20:02.020]  89 I came out with my first book and we predicted simultaneously that Japan
[02:20:02.020 --> 02:20:06.300]  would see a giant crash in the 1990s while the US and Europe would see the
[02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:11.180]  greatest boom in history people thought we were absolutely nuts then in the
[02:20:11.180 --> 02:20:14.140]  early 90s when we had the recession that we predicted we said no we're going to
[02:20:14.140 --> 02:20:18.520]  come out of this and in the Dow is going to hit 10,000 or higher by the early
[02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:24.500]  2000s and that happened we called the tech peak in in in February and April we
[02:20:24.500 --> 02:20:29.660]  called the internet peak in February and the Nasdaq peak in April just within one
[02:20:29.660 --> 02:20:33.020]  month of the peak and said look this bubble this is good this is a peak it's
[02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:38.100]  going to start to burst then we called the housing peak in late 2005 I literally
[02:20:38.100 --> 02:20:45.220]  moved from Miami to Tampa in that time period sold my house in Miami rented in
[02:20:45.220 --> 02:20:49.740]  Tampa saved a fortune so I practice what I preach and we've been saying now for
[02:20:49.740 --> 02:20:54.940]  20 years that in late 2007 the baby boomers with peak and spending and we
[02:20:54.940 --> 02:20:58.340]  would start to move into a downward economy well what we did get our big
[02:20:58.340 --> 02:21:02.260]  crash in 2008 right on cue but governments have just said well we won't
[02:21:02.260 --> 02:21:05.620]  let that happen anymore we won't let the economy go down we won't let banks fail
[02:21:05.620 --> 02:21:11.020]  we won't let companies fail we won't let debts be restructured or entitlements
[02:21:11.020 --> 02:21:16.300]  which are just off off its charts on affordable so they're preventing the
[02:21:16.300 --> 02:21:22.300]  very crisis that could rebalance our economy get rid of this top 1% running
[02:21:22.300 --> 02:21:26.220]  away with all the games and everything but they won't do it and and so what's
[02:21:26.220 --> 02:21:29.140]  going to happen instead they just created a bubble they created a bigger
[02:21:29.140 --> 02:21:33.340]  bubble again and we've been telling people and in over the last several
[02:21:33.340 --> 02:21:37.260]  months somewhere around Dow 17,000 a little higher this bubble is going to
[02:21:37.260 --> 02:21:41.220]  peak it's going to peak soon and the next crash is going to take us to lower
[02:21:41.220 --> 02:21:46.860]  lows than we saw in 2009 about five to six thousand on the Dow that's a very
[02:21:46.860 --> 02:21:51.380]  clear pattern higher highs and each bubble peak lower lows and each crash
[02:21:51.380 --> 02:21:55.220]  the government keeps simulating to try to avoid the crisis but only creates a
[02:21:55.220 --> 02:21:59.140]  bigger crisis down the road just like taking more drugs to keep from coming
[02:21:59.140 --> 02:22:01.460]  down that's exactly what they're doing
[02:22:01.460 --> 02:22:07.460]  quantitative easing is basically like crack for the economy again if you just
[02:22:07.460 --> 02:22:11.780]  join us you can visit the website harriedent.com for us Alex Jones and you
[02:22:11.780 --> 02:22:15.220]  can get unpublished chapter so it's an unpublished chapter that's even better
[02:22:15.220 --> 02:22:19.420]  of the demographic cliff book that's already a best-seller we're going to go
[02:22:19.420 --> 02:22:23.900]  through some of those graphs today as well if you're a TV viewer watching at
[02:22:23.900 --> 02:22:29.020]  prismplanet.tv or infowars.com forward slash show to find the free feed of the
[02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:35.380]  daytime broadcast and transmission now continuing with Harry Dent just tuned in
[02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:40.380]  on Alex Jones we're talking about where the world is today and so many people
[02:22:40.380 --> 02:22:45.100]  send me emails it is a minority but I do get a lot of them and I get it on the
[02:22:45.100 --> 02:22:49.540]  street or when I do radio interviews or TV interviews Alex why are you such a
[02:22:49.540 --> 02:22:53.660]  pessimist why are you complaining why are you saying this is bad or you know
[02:22:53.660 --> 02:22:57.180]  this is terrible well it's because I want to differentiate what's good from
[02:22:57.180 --> 02:23:02.220]  bad I socially want to wake people up to try to make the world a freer more open
[02:23:02.220 --> 02:23:06.940]  place now if someone disagrees with me about what my views are that's fine but
[02:23:06.940 --> 02:23:11.660]  it's my free speech but denying all these trends that are as clear as the
[02:23:11.660 --> 02:23:16.660]  nose on my face or your face is the stuff of societal collapse and and if we
[02:23:16.660 --> 02:23:22.300]  don't reverse this we have a managed economy like Japan or Venezuela two
[02:23:22.300 --> 02:23:25.740]  different managed systems one of the managed much better but still in a 20
[02:23:25.740 --> 02:23:30.180]  year recession slash depression was signs of total societal collapse nobody's
[02:23:30.180 --> 02:23:34.140]  having kids now you look at Venezuela they can't keep the lights on I mean we
[02:23:34.140 --> 02:23:38.860]  know that managed systems don't work and and we know that there's this tiny
[02:23:38.860 --> 02:23:43.020]  elite that are scapegoating the free market while they run away with all the
[02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:47.860]  gains creating a giant piranha like underclass that they are using politically
[02:23:47.860 --> 02:23:53.500]  to fully socialize the once great western nations because the globalists
[02:23:53.500 --> 02:23:58.380]  are exempt in most cases from what they've done to us so so what I'm asking
[02:23:58.380 --> 02:24:02.060]  you is how do we politically I understand it's important to know these
[02:24:02.060 --> 02:24:05.260]  trends and understand them so we can individually take care of ourselves be
[02:24:05.260 --> 02:24:09.020]  in a better position maybe even you'll thrive from it that's a very moral and
[02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:14.900]  smart thing to do but at the same time what do you say about political hope I
[02:24:14.900 --> 02:24:19.580]  mean there's some huge awakening happening on one side but also incredible
[02:24:19.580 --> 02:24:24.460]  arrogance by the ruling class on the other so where does all this go well you
[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:28.340]  know you only hope I have and it's exactly what I see happen a crisis is
[02:24:28.340 --> 02:24:33.220]  what gets people clear I am just like you I am crystal clear on debt trends
[02:24:33.220 --> 02:24:36.740]  they're off the charts the greatest debt bubble in history and that never ends
[02:24:36.740 --> 02:24:41.060]  well entitlements are even worse than that we never even had entitlements in
[02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:44.860]  the Great Depression when that debt bubble and financial bubble burst we got
[02:24:44.860 --> 02:24:50.260]  financial assets overvalued again more than ever about the burst and we're
[02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:53.460]  going to see a crisis because a lot of wealth is going to disappear when these
[02:24:53.460 --> 02:24:56.780]  bubble bursts and a lot of banks are going to have to fail when people
[02:24:56.780 --> 02:25:01.180]  realize the government can't just artificially create growth forever when
[02:25:01.180 --> 02:25:04.460]  the demographic trends and the debt trends are down so I'm clear on this
[02:25:04.460 --> 02:25:09.620]  but I'm also clear unlike economists they're saying that China is the new
[02:25:09.620 --> 02:25:13.540]  model state driven capitalism I'm like you have to be kidding me
[02:25:13.540 --> 02:25:18.700]  China makes Japan or any other managed system look like nothing China has
[02:25:18.700 --> 02:25:23.980]  over expanded over managed their economy from top to bottom and talk about
[02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:28.100]  crony capitalism the way you get rich in China is you're the friend with the
[02:25:28.100 --> 02:25:32.540]  local Communist Party mafia leader and that's what it is it's a big mafia
[02:25:32.540 --> 02:25:40.220]  China has 27% of their condos and homes vacant overbuilt giant malls vacant
[02:25:40.220 --> 02:25:45.380]  overbuilt roads to know where bridges to know where railway stations that
[02:25:45.380 --> 02:25:49.540]  nobody's using they have over managed overbuilt let me just stop you for a
[02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:52.700]  minute history that's what this unpublished chapter I'm giving away
[02:25:52.700 --> 02:25:55.900]  for free about it didn't make it in time because I was rushing to get the book
[02:25:55.900 --> 02:26:00.660]  that I got it into the Korean and Chinese and in Asian books but I didn't
[02:26:00.660 --> 02:26:04.700]  get it in the US book so this is the most important chapter it looks at China
[02:26:04.700 --> 02:26:10.500]  thoroughly and shows what's exactly what's going on why state managed
[02:26:10.500 --> 02:26:13.500]  capitalism is going to create the biggest disaster in the world it's going
[02:26:13.500 --> 02:26:17.140]  to be the failure of China's managed system that I think is going to most
[02:26:17.140 --> 02:26:22.140]  wake up politicians and economists and teach them that the free market system
[02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:25.700]  works better as long as you just have some simple rules and then that's what
[02:26:25.700 --> 02:26:31.220]  they've abandoned because they want more they want to manage sure well they're
[02:26:31.220 --> 02:26:35.500]  well I mean in the brains of the socialist being counters the collapsing
[02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:38.300]  things gives them more power so that they think they're going to survive it
[02:26:38.300 --> 02:26:42.300]  but if we politically expose them this could really be the end of them I agree
[02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:48.180]  with you the crisis they've been helping create and exacerbate is is their
[02:26:48.180 --> 02:26:52.500]  downfall if we simply tell the truth with a narrative against their narrative
[02:26:52.500 --> 02:26:56.540]  our narrative the truth will defeat their narrative the lie but looking at
[02:26:56.540 --> 02:26:59.860]  China we you hit the nail on the head right there nobody brings this up when
[02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:04.660]  I look at Europe and the US is elites what upsets me about the real controlling
[02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:09.340]  socialist elite is that either exempt from what they're doing to the rest of
[02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:16.500]  us but be there's so anti-freedom anti-market anti-male anti-independence
[02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:21.460]  that they don't even want to life blood in their own system that they've got
[02:27:21.460 --> 02:27:26.020]  control of but then they embrace in the Economist magazine every month is I
[02:27:26.020 --> 02:27:30.180]  guess you're talking about that I see it everywhere China that has suicide nets
[02:27:30.180 --> 02:27:35.980]  mobile execution vans forced abortions in their factories just stuff off the
[02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:40.900]  chart evil rivers getting set on fire they're so toxic and then this is the
[02:27:40.900 --> 02:27:45.660]  model a bunch of Chinese generals that are tax exempt making millions of
[02:27:45.660 --> 02:27:49.300]  dollars with their corrupt little royalty mafia families I know I'm
[02:27:49.300 --> 02:27:54.340]  ranting here Harry but but I mean the fact that our elite loves the Chinese
[02:27:54.340 --> 02:28:00.260]  model the Chinese Communist state-run model shows you how much trouble we're
[02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:04.100]  in yeah you know these people who love this model ought to go over there and
[02:28:04.100 --> 02:28:08.220]  choke on the smog and they're like you say they're the most polluted environment
[02:28:08.220 --> 02:28:11.180]  they're creating the most pollution in the world they're creating the most
[02:28:11.180 --> 02:28:15.140]  they're adding the most of this global bubble it is just going to burst and
[02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:18.700]  again that's what we'll talk later about deflation when you get bubbles burst
[02:28:18.700 --> 02:28:24.100]  when wealth disappears when debts fail and get restructured money disappears
[02:28:24.100 --> 02:28:29.540]  money just disappears and you get look fewer dollars chasing the same good you
[02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:35.140]  get deflation not inflation they're in all this over capacity and over building
[02:28:35.140 --> 02:28:40.660]  any China's pretty much overbuilt their economy for the next 12 years in advance
[02:28:40.660 --> 02:28:45.260]  of urbanization and they've urbanized twice as fast as any country in history
[02:28:45.260 --> 02:28:48.820]  which is dangerous I mean they're they're uprooting all their traditions
[02:28:48.820 --> 02:28:52.980]  they're basically destroying their economy and then like you say our
[02:28:52.980 --> 02:28:57.020]  economists say oh wow this is such a great model because they grow 8% a year
[02:28:57.020 --> 02:29:01.500]  and rarely have recessions as that's an economist dream but if you look at it
[02:29:01.500 --> 02:29:06.300]  and you get this chapter believe me the reason I'm putting all this stuff out
[02:29:06.300 --> 02:29:10.500]  like you is I'm going to be there to say I told you so because people do need to
[02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:14.020]  learn we are going to get this crisis you cannot keep a bubble going forever
[02:29:14.020 --> 02:29:17.460]  you cannot manipulate our economy forever you can't take more and more
[02:29:17.460 --> 02:29:21.820]  financial drugs and not have consequences so this crisis is going to hit
[02:29:21.820 --> 02:29:26.660]  but people need to understand why it happened and what the cause of it was
[02:29:26.660 --> 02:29:30.340]  so we don't repeat this mistakes and so these people do lose credibility that's
[02:29:30.340 --> 02:29:34.900]  right Harry we got a break is thrilling our economy Harry Dentz our guest I'm
[02:29:34.900 --> 02:29:37.780]  Alex Jones Dave Bratton Virginia just won the
[02:29:37.780 --> 02:29:43.460]  primary as folks know he's an economist sounds just like mr. Dan this is a
[02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:48.100]  popular idea folks we're gonna break it all down the other side and look at
[02:29:48.100 --> 02:29:54.260]  where the economy is going we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones
[02:29:54.260 --> 02:30:03.100]  and the GCN radio network I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it
[02:30:03.100 --> 02:30:07.780]  was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify most people know
[02:30:07.780 --> 02:30:13.300]  that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world iodine is key to
[02:30:13.300 --> 02:30:17.320]  so many of the body's functions especially the thyroid I discovered a
[02:30:17.320 --> 02:30:22.060]  product being developed by Dr. Group you now know it as survival shield true
[02:30:22.060 --> 02:30:26.460]  nascent iodine that your body can really absorb then about a year ago he said

[02:33:30.100 --> 02:33:35.900]  was awesome we're gonna go back to a hairy dent again you go to harry dent
[02:33:35.900 --> 02:33:40.060]  comfort slash Alex Jones he's got an unpublished chapter kind of halfway
[02:33:40.060 --> 02:33:44.940]  read this this cuz I got in late today with the flights and I was like oh he's
[02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:48.300]  posted one of his chapters no no no no he already had some of the chapters I
[02:33:48.300 --> 02:33:53.660]  saw up on the side a few months ago when it first came out but this is an
[02:33:53.660 --> 02:33:57.260]  unpublished one that really came out after the book and we're gonna talk
[02:33:57.260 --> 02:34:03.580]  about his predictions now and perhaps you can explain to myself and others out
[02:34:03.580 --> 02:34:09.340]  there what he's getting at saying it's deflation not inflation and I just want
[02:34:09.340 --> 02:34:13.860]  to talk you know to him about what I'm seeing but tomorrow and I may even do
[02:34:13.860 --> 02:34:17.820]  like an hour overdrive a day because I got here late some stations carry that
[02:34:17.820 --> 02:34:22.500]  fourth hour I won't get into much of this news and take your phone calls I'm
[02:34:22.500 --> 02:34:27.900]  not sure about time to do that yet but we'll see I'm just more reflective now
[02:34:27.900 --> 02:34:33.700]  because I like to scuba dive I like to snorkel I never get to do it so I went
[02:34:33.700 --> 02:34:42.460]  down to the Caribbean and I'd be on the boat and they'd be being real nice to me
[02:34:42.460 --> 02:34:45.380]  with all the people on the boat you know going snorkeling or scuba diving or
[02:34:45.380 --> 02:34:50.340]  going out to see the stingrays or going out to be on a wreck and they would
[02:34:50.340 --> 02:34:54.340]  just as we have a photo now at the end and I'd say what's going on oh we're
[02:34:54.340 --> 02:35:00.380]  all listeners and again one of the tour guides would be a you know a cop who
[02:35:00.380 --> 02:35:07.300]  also runs a company to go out and see the wreck or it would then be I mean I
[02:35:07.300 --> 02:35:13.580]  did probably like six or seven of these tours sometimes two a day and every time
[02:35:13.580 --> 02:35:17.820]  they were listeners I'd be in a grocery store and a cop would walk by and go
[02:35:17.820 --> 02:35:23.260]  Alex Jones like what you're doing I'd be in a dive shop and there'd be you know
[02:35:23.260 --> 02:35:28.380]  three black Caribbean guys in there and I'll go that voice you're Alex Jones I
[02:35:28.380 --> 02:35:33.300]  like what you say I have a lot of the same views we listen and again I'm not
[02:35:33.300 --> 02:35:37.900]  up your bracket hey I got a bunch of listeners what I'm saying is we should
[02:35:37.900 --> 02:35:42.500]  be able to turn this around if tea party candidates are winning not just here
[02:35:42.500 --> 02:35:49.780]  but in Europe Le Pen and the UKIP party all over Europe I mean they got the
[02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:54.780]  biggest gains in the EU election and it's happening here so we're gonna go
[02:35:54.780 --> 02:35:58.900]  back to Mr. Dent here in a moment I just want to tell people this is exciting
[02:35:58.900 --> 02:36:03.580]  because I learned it's a particular Caribbean island they would never say
[02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:05.700]  anything when you're at a restaurant or wouldn't say anything when you'd gone
[02:36:05.700 --> 02:36:10.500]  out and done your trip at the end they would say I'm a listener or they'd be
[02:36:10.500 --> 02:36:14.820]  sitting there holding me in like reverence and I could tell go you're a
[02:36:14.820 --> 02:36:18.300]  listener well I didn't want to bother you sir but we really appreciate you I
[02:36:18.300 --> 02:36:24.780]  mean it's just amazing amazing that I can go to England people saw live feeds of
[02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:30.780]  this on the Bilderberg two years ago or now you're in Africa and I just go to
[02:36:30.780 --> 02:36:35.660]  Big Bend do a live feed and there's people walking by by the scores and like
[02:36:35.660 --> 02:36:39.380]  half of them are stopping Alex Jones, Alex Jones quite frankly I don't know
[02:36:39.380 --> 02:36:42.060]  where these numbers are at because we have millions a day we can track to
[02:36:42.060 --> 02:36:45.940]  visit the sites listen to the show and am an FM stuff but I don't know where the
[02:36:45.940 --> 02:36:51.260]  numbers are where it's all coming from YouTube that that can't be it all I'm
[02:36:51.260 --> 02:36:56.260]  telling you is there's government has a 7% approval writing right now we should
[02:36:56.260 --> 02:36:59.700]  be able to beat this we should be able to take the country in the world back
[02:36:59.700 --> 02:37:06.820]  that's what I'm getting at here now before we go back to our guest here this
[02:37:06.820 --> 02:37:10.340]  whole broadcast is listen supported I can hire more reporters I can pay my
[02:37:10.340 --> 02:37:15.660]  reporters better I can get better equipment you've seen the new studio
[02:37:15.660 --> 02:37:18.140]  we'll be doing the show out of there full-time soon I've been doing a lot of
[02:37:18.140 --> 02:37:22.020]  special reports out of there what I did like before I left down I taped a bunch
[02:37:22.020 --> 02:37:26.940]  of reports then they aired them live on the show with David Knight who was live
[02:37:26.940 --> 02:37:33.580]  but they had taped to air obviously my clips and we're building all of this
[02:37:33.580 --> 02:37:37.660]  because of your support and it cost a lot I don't want to get into how much it
[02:37:37.660 --> 02:37:40.500]  costs around this whole operation here but one reason it's been successful is
[02:37:40.500 --> 02:37:46.540]  that I take it's got to be 95% of the money that comes in here and put it right
[02:37:46.540 --> 02:37:50.460]  back in the operation and over the years have created a fund in case the whole
[02:37:50.460 --> 02:37:54.020]  economy shut off so we could keep running three four months when you talk
[02:37:54.020 --> 02:37:57.700]  about collapse it really scares me because in a collapse we need to be
[02:37:57.700 --> 02:38:03.100]  prepared and we need to get as big as we can and before the collapse comes so
[02:38:03.100 --> 02:38:06.860]  that we've told the story so that we have a position to go to the next level
[02:38:06.860 --> 02:38:10.580]  to really try to change history that's what I'm into I'm not into fancy things
[02:38:10.580 --> 02:38:14.340]  I'm not into money nothing bad about it I'm into money because it gives me
[02:38:14.340 --> 02:38:17.540]  freedom the elite want to make you pour under their control because they want to

[02:40:06.100 --> 02:40:10.180]  think the show is exploding why do you think Harry Dent's popularity is
[02:40:10.180 --> 02:40:15.220]  exploding or Rand Paul's or Ted Cruz because folks we're on the deck of the
[02:40:15.220 --> 02:40:19.700]  Titanic saying get to the lifeboats now I've been ranting sir it's just that I
[02:40:19.700 --> 02:40:22.660]  think it's important before we get into the economy and where it's all going and

[02:40:45.300 --> 02:40:50.300]  layman but how would you quantify what I just said you agree with it about the
[02:40:50.300 --> 02:40:54.020]  awakening a or B am I being too optimistic I mean what does your gut
[02:40:54.020 --> 02:40:59.100]  tell you no I think I study a lot of cycles Alex and one of them is a 250
[02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:04.380]  year revolutionary cycle as in the Revolutionary War 250 years ago and
[02:41:04.380 --> 02:41:10.660]  the whole wealth of nations by by Adam Smith and stuff we're do we're right
[02:41:10.660 --> 02:41:14.700]  for a major revolution things do go towards more freedom even though at
[02:41:14.700 --> 02:41:17.620]  times they go the other ways and I think that's what's going to come out of this
[02:41:17.620 --> 02:41:21.020]  I do think it's important I've got the same mission you do I'm just warning
[02:41:21.020 --> 02:41:24.980]  people the media doesn't want people to hear this politicians don't want people
[02:41:24.980 --> 02:41:28.340]  to hear it you know Merrill Lynch doesn't want people to hear it you know in
[02:41:28.340 --> 02:41:32.180]  financial institutions and banks but this is the truth I just tell people
[02:41:32.180 --> 02:41:37.900]  here's how much debt we have we have 127 trillion by my last conservative count
[02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:42.660]  eight times GDP here's what our demographics say it predicted the boom
[02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:46.780]  now it's predicting a bus so I'm not a bearish person I was been bullish for
[02:41:46.780 --> 02:41:51.980]  20 years but the trends are down and now with these bubbles I'm also studied
[02:41:51.980 --> 02:41:56.300]  every bubble in history I got a whole chapter in the book chapter 5 on
[02:41:56.300 --> 02:42:00.380]  bubbles is unpublished chapter on China the greatest bubble of them all you got
[02:42:00.380 --> 02:42:04.820]  to understand bubbles because people get in denial and so I agree with you people
[02:42:04.820 --> 02:42:09.380]  who hear this sort of stuff who hear the truth need to tell other people and
[02:42:09.380 --> 02:42:12.740]  warn them because people are going to get their ass handed to them I hate to
[02:42:12.740 --> 02:42:17.100]  say this but you know you think the last crash was bad or the last recession I
[02:42:17.100 --> 02:42:21.260]  think this is going to be more like the Great Depression because the longer they
[02:42:21.260 --> 02:42:25.620]  put this off and the more they pump up with all this artificial money which
[02:42:25.620 --> 02:42:30.740]  again is just like taking an artificial drug to stay high and get higher it's
[02:42:30.740 --> 02:42:34.700]  exactly that the worst the come down is going to be so people do really do need
[02:42:34.700 --> 02:42:40.220]  to be prepared they need to get in safe investments now don't don't chase this
[02:42:40.220 --> 02:42:44.700]  bubble any further it may go up another few percent it's already bubbly and I
[02:42:44.700 --> 02:42:48.860]  tell you if I can show that like the one chart I should show people is that
[02:42:48.860 --> 02:42:53.460]  megaphone chart I alluded to earlier if you look at them this is a very simple
[02:42:53.460 --> 02:42:58.340]  chart nothing complicated about it each bubble has taken us to new highs and
[02:42:58.340 --> 02:43:03.180]  each crash has taken us to new lows this is exactly a similar pattern to how the
[02:43:03.180 --> 02:43:07.620]  market peaked when the last generation peaked in this spending the Bob Hope or
[02:43:07.620 --> 02:43:13.940]  World War two generation we had three higher peaks and 65 68 and 72 and then
[02:43:13.940 --> 02:43:19.540]  we and we kept having lower lows and the big crash hit and 73 74 and nobody saw
[02:43:19.540 --> 02:43:24.220]  that coming this is a very obvious pattern you talk about common sense our
[02:43:24.220 --> 02:43:28.620]  biggest indicator is the spending wave it's just a 46 year lag for the
[02:43:28.620 --> 02:43:32.980]  predictable quantifiable peak and spending of the average household in this
[02:43:32.980 --> 02:43:36.780]  country and it would have told you decades ago that we would have an
[02:43:36.780 --> 02:43:43.060]  unprecedented boom from 1983 to 2007 with the rising baby boomers earning and
[02:43:43.060 --> 02:43:46.540]  spending more money getting their kids in college and all that good stuff and
[02:43:46.540 --> 02:43:52.380]  then we would have a downturn from 2008 to 2020 to 23 that's a very simple
[02:43:52.380 --> 02:43:56.020]  indicator common sense people spend more money as they raise their families
[02:43:56.020 --> 02:44:00.380]  who doesn't understand that we can we can quantify we can project this we know
[02:44:00.380 --> 02:44:05.260]  when people are born and I just for legal and illegal immigrants so that it's
[02:44:05.260 --> 02:44:09.660]  even more accurate and so these are tools anybody can understand economists
[02:44:09.660 --> 02:44:13.700]  actually are too damn complicated they get into all the complexity all the
[02:44:13.700 --> 02:44:18.100]  detailed indicators and up missing the forest well you know why it's because
[02:44:18.100 --> 02:44:21.700]  they want to specialize in different schools to then compete with each other
[02:44:21.700 --> 02:44:25.340]  to have more textbooks and then to confuse the whole thing so nobody can
[02:44:25.340 --> 02:44:28.340]  understand it that's what a lot of the big banks have been financing for a
[02:44:28.340 --> 02:44:31.580]  hundred years is basically conflating everything but let me ask you this and
[02:44:31.580 --> 02:44:35.300]  I want you to go to the charts and basically predict the next shoe to drop
[02:44:35.300 --> 02:44:41.380]  with our guests here today Harry Dent let me ask you this question look I agree
[02:44:41.380 --> 02:44:43.940]  with you that when the big depression really kicks off we're already in a
[02:44:43.940 --> 02:44:47.820]  obvious long-term recession depression in many areas of the world depression
[02:44:47.820 --> 02:44:52.740]  different sectors it's a very managed economy so some areas are boom but the
[02:44:52.740 --> 02:44:57.380]  larger aggregate just looking at it is bust and even the establishment starting
[02:44:57.380 --> 02:45:00.620]  to admit that and they're buying armored vehicles and the Pentagon admits
[02:45:00.620 --> 02:45:04.780]  they're preparing for collapse and Europe's preparing so so we know what's
[02:45:04.780 --> 02:45:09.300]  happening but just like when you were on a few months ago I said look I get that
[02:45:09.300 --> 02:45:13.580]  there is going to be deflation that's probably where this goes but the elites
[02:45:13.580 --> 02:45:18.820]  have been taking trillions bailing out there too big to fails giving it to
[02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:24.420]  themselves and so you can see luxury items Bentley's big houses helicopters
[02:45:24.420 --> 02:45:28.020]  they're all double triple huge inflation because the elite are being smart
[02:45:28.020 --> 02:45:32.220]  they're keeping it all to themselves the problem is it leaks out there is some
[02:45:32.220 --> 02:45:38.140]  trickle down and so now it's causing inflation in a lot of areas the Q even
[02:45:38.140 --> 02:45:42.380]  though it's flowing look at meat prices exploding look at state everybody I go
[02:45:42.380 --> 02:45:46.420]  out everything's going up in price when I was in the Caribbean I said why stuff
[02:45:46.420 --> 02:45:50.300]  so expensive they said well we're pegged to the dollar here you know I mean my
[02:45:50.300 --> 02:45:54.300]  god they were aware of it and that's how inflation works correct me if I'm
[02:45:54.300 --> 02:45:58.980]  wrong it's generally worse outside the country first then those dollars start
[02:45:58.980 --> 02:46:04.540]  coming back in the different M1 M2 so breakdown for me how we're seeing
[02:46:04.540 --> 02:46:10.500]  inflation but also there is a deflation in business deflation in some of the
[02:46:10.500 --> 02:46:15.700]  real markets trillions of dollars chasing a stock market pumping it up with
[02:46:15.700 --> 02:46:20.420]  QE dollars or I mean aren't we seeing a stock market inflation just like we see
[02:46:20.420 --> 02:46:25.220]  in some commodities explain this to me what you get and this only happens
[02:46:25.220 --> 02:46:29.140]  once in a lifetime that's why people don't understand it and see it the last
[02:46:29.140 --> 02:46:34.660]  bubble economy we had was from World War one into the war in 20s and in that
[02:46:34.660 --> 02:46:38.340]  time you get debt growing way faster than the economy you can't a debt group
[02:46:38.340 --> 02:46:44.860]  from 1983 to 2008 at its peak private and public debt together grew at 2.6
[02:46:44.860 --> 02:46:50.020]  times our economy our GDP you can't do that for 25 years without getting a huge
[02:46:50.020 --> 02:46:55.020]  debt imbalance so you get too much debt that overstimulates the economy the
[02:46:55.020 --> 02:46:58.900]  government then on top of that pours in money every time we have a recession and
[02:46:58.900 --> 02:47:02.900]  pushes down interest rates and that causes even more borrowing and leverage
[02:47:02.900 --> 02:47:06.540]  so you create more and more leverage again like a financial drug like like
[02:47:06.540 --> 02:47:12.380]  steroids or crack financial enhancing drugs and basically it creates bubbles
[02:47:12.380 --> 02:47:16.940]  businesses understand here but I mean explain to me how you're saying we're
[02:47:16.940 --> 02:47:22.500]  gonna see you know depressionary stuff but I mean economists didn't think of the
[02:47:22.500 --> 02:47:26.540]  70s you could have inflation and depression but then they had
[02:47:26.540 --> 02:47:31.340]  stagflation would this be hyper stag inflation or once it blows up and pops
[02:47:31.340 --> 02:47:35.860]  is it's so bad then things will implode and then that will take out the
[02:47:35.860 --> 02:47:39.980]  inflation I mean what's happening yeah actually I was in chapter one of my book
[02:47:39.980 --> 02:47:46.220]  I showed four seasons of our economy spring boom a summer stagflation high
[02:47:46.220 --> 02:47:49.820]  inflation recession which again economists never understood even when it
[02:47:49.820 --> 02:47:53.500]  happened it's part of the model of repeats once in a lifetime all throughout
[02:47:53.500 --> 02:47:57.940]  history then you get a fall bubble boom when that inflation falls you get very
[02:47:57.940 --> 02:48:02.060]  low interest rates that's when technologies move most mainstream like
[02:48:02.060 --> 02:48:05.820]  microcomputers in this one in automobiles in the roaring 20s and stuff
[02:48:05.820 --> 02:48:10.140]  like that and that but when you get this bubble people over borrow over expand
[02:48:10.140 --> 02:48:14.700]  over leverage and then when when the generation cycles turned down the
[02:48:14.700 --> 02:48:18.900]  bubbles burst and you get a huge debt deleveraging I mean in the health
[02:48:18.900 --> 02:48:22.500]  industries they call it a detox or somebody's coming off drugs they call
[02:48:22.500 --> 02:48:27.660]  it a detox it's a debt detox what happened in the great depression is that
[02:48:27.660 --> 02:48:34.820]  we went from debt being 190% of GDP down to 60% we shed a ton of debt trillions
[02:48:34.820 --> 02:48:38.380]  and trillions of dollars of debt most of it private debt because government
[02:48:38.380 --> 02:48:41.780]  deficits only tend to go up and down turn because their revenues go down and
[02:48:41.780 --> 02:48:46.660]  the cost level we shed debt the economy rebalance the bubbles burst real estate
[02:48:46.660 --> 02:48:52.780]  went back down to reality stocks crashed 89% see all this these top 1% of
[02:48:52.780 --> 02:48:55.700]  people that are controlling all the assets they're the ones that are going
[02:48:55.700 --> 02:48:59.860]  to get hit the worst when this bubble finally burst and doesn't get cranked
[02:48:59.860 --> 02:49:03.500]  back up from me by the government the government has saved the banks and has
[02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:08.060]  saved the top 1% and it's screwed the everyday household what should have
[02:49:08.060 --> 02:49:11.740]  happened is we should have written down these mortgages which were way over lent
[02:49:11.740 --> 02:49:15.660]  by banks and they're the sophisticated people not the everyday household way
[02:49:15.660 --> 02:49:19.780]  over lent against high home valuations those home valuations need to come down
[02:49:19.780 --> 02:49:24.220]  where a young family can afford a home again mortgages need to be written off
[02:49:24.220 --> 02:49:27.580]  if the average person had their mortgage written down in half in line with their
[02:49:27.580 --> 02:49:32.420]  house they would be a lot better off instead of worse off so it's this the
[02:49:32.420 --> 02:49:36.900]  financial bubbles bursting down goes from 17,000 my ultimate target is more
[02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:41.380]  like three to 4,000 down the road around 2020 that's going to destroy you know
[02:49:41.380 --> 02:49:47.580]  80% of people's wealth you got 18 80 trillion dollars in net worth it could
[02:49:47.580 --> 02:49:52.540]  be cut in half that's money that disappears home prices drop stock prices
[02:49:52.540 --> 02:49:56.380]  drop all this sort of stuff a lot of debt gets restructured and written off
[02:49:56.380 --> 02:50:01.700]  that means as I said earlier money disappearing it never comes back or at
[02:50:01.700 --> 02:50:05.820]  least for a long time and that creates depletion so it's the opposite of the
[02:50:05.820 --> 02:50:10.260]  inflation what I call summer season we saw in the 70s and that's the way the
[02:50:10.260 --> 02:50:14.500]  economy goes it goes from mild inflation in spring the high inflation in
[02:50:14.500 --> 02:50:19.060]  summer to falling inflation again which everybody loves in fall and then to
[02:50:19.060 --> 02:50:23.340]  deflation and winter this happens over and over and again it used to be every
[02:50:23.340 --> 02:50:27.580]  50 to 60 years when our life spans were that now our life spans are more like
[02:50:27.580 --> 02:50:32.140]  80 so this cycle is more like 80 years economists don't understand this they
[02:50:32.140 --> 02:50:36.620]  don't understand the dynamics of the pre-market system why deflation and
[02:50:36.620 --> 02:50:41.300]  inflation actually stimulate the strongest innovations that pay off for
[02:50:41.300 --> 02:50:46.300]  decades they also I mean having home prices come back down having a lot of
[02:50:46.300 --> 02:50:50.300]  debt written off restructuring our entitlements which we can't even remotely
[02:50:50.300 --> 02:50:54.060]  afford what's been promised by the government for Medicare Medicaid and
[02:50:54.060 --> 02:50:58.100]  and so exactly it makes things cheaper it makes things cheaper we'll be right
[02:50:58.100 --> 02:51:02.820]  back stay with us I want to ask you we the people grow cotton we fabric engrave
[02:51:02.820 --> 02:51:06.100]  ink embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carding to a
[02:51:06.100 --> 02:51:09.860]  private bank having it led back at interest forcing taxes to serve a step
[02:51:09.860 --> 02:51:13.380]  this capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the
[02:51:13.380 --> 02:51:16.180]  public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a
[02:51:16.180 --> 02:51:19.100]  standing army Ted Anderson on placing a free silver dollar in a book that

[02:53:57.580 --> 02:54:15.500]  storage I tend to get a little frantic on air with guests like mr. Dent because
[02:54:15.500 --> 02:54:20.140]  we're not really talking about something that's rocket science here it's
[02:54:20.140 --> 02:54:26.700]  historical now he takes it and shows it in a scientific way so people can see
[02:54:26.700 --> 02:54:30.580]  the facts for themselves but this is all common sense and I've studied the
[02:54:30.580 --> 02:54:35.100]  establishment they have created models where they think they're gonna get more
[02:54:35.100 --> 02:54:41.260]  power out of this incremental collapse and domesticators break our will but
[02:54:41.260 --> 02:54:45.340]  they're smoking their own dope they can't manage their way out of a wet
[02:54:45.340 --> 02:54:51.940]  paper bag and Obama vacations four months a year so this is not gonna go
[02:54:51.940 --> 02:54:58.260]  well I don't know what's gonna happen but it runs from bad to worse with a
[02:54:58.260 --> 02:55:02.340]  lot of crazy mixed in and I don't want to see this like some plant of the apes
[02:55:02.340 --> 02:55:06.260]  scenario I mean I've seen some of these governmental and corporate interests
[02:55:06.260 --> 02:55:11.220]  that have just wrecked other countries that were great nations and like happened
[02:55:11.220 --> 02:55:15.780]  to Chile and others and I just am so sad to see them trying to turn this
[02:55:15.780 --> 02:55:25.060]  country into a third world nation and I guess I'm involved in collective
[02:55:25.060 --> 02:55:29.060]  hand-wringing just saying how do we wake people up and I think it's with the
[02:55:29.060 --> 02:55:34.980]  fundamentals it's the basics but what do you expect the political class in
[02:55:34.980 --> 02:55:38.620]  Europe the United States and other places to do when one of these crises
[02:55:38.620 --> 02:55:44.940]  goes over the edge like Ukraine ISIS in the Middle East China could be blowing
[02:55:44.940 --> 02:55:48.700]  up all the time people say where's the meltdown where's the blow up look at the
[02:55:48.700 --> 02:55:53.660]  societal rot the cities the dozens of states about to go bankrupt hundreds of
[02:55:53.660 --> 02:55:58.260]  cities already bankrupt all the numbers just just so astronomical I mean it's
[02:55:58.260 --> 02:56:02.740]  guaranteed it's like a guy that said five heart attacks and he's you know 85
[02:56:02.740 --> 02:56:06.580]  years old and they're saying he's got to walk up the Empire States building
[02:56:06.580 --> 02:56:11.020]  stairway I mean we don't have a heart attack this time but he's gonna have
[02:56:11.020 --> 02:56:15.820]  one soon is what I'm saying I just like I'm sitting on top of a bunch of lit
[02:56:15.820 --> 02:56:21.180]  TNT Harry well it is you know in addition our demographic cycles I have an
[02:56:21.180 --> 02:56:26.660]  innovation cycle every 45 years very simple a geopolitical cycle that turns
[02:56:26.660 --> 02:56:33.860]  negative every 18 I mean every 36 years from 9-11 into the end of this decade
[02:56:33.860 --> 02:56:38.420]  this cycle continues to point down and everything has gone wrong since then the
[02:56:38.420 --> 02:56:42.580]  Middle East is an outright Shia Sunni civil war that's going to blow up now
[02:56:42.580 --> 02:56:46.140]  that we're not willing to enter being anymore and I don't think we should have
[02:56:46.140 --> 02:56:50.540]  been the first place in that case China is going to have unbelievable social
[02:56:50.540 --> 02:56:57.180]  unrest when this bubble burst they've got 221 million unregistered rural
[02:56:57.180 --> 02:57:02.420]  citizens living in cities that aren't even aren't even legal people there and
[02:57:02.420 --> 02:57:06.220]  they don't have any skills they're tolerated like illegal immigrants here
[02:57:06.220 --> 02:57:09.140]  in the United States in the boom they will not be tolerated in the bus they're
[02:57:09.140 --> 02:57:13.460]  gonna have huge problems so things are gonna get worse and we've got strong
[02:57:13.460 --> 02:57:18.180]  polarization in this country and you know in this bubble burst it's gonna be
[02:57:18.180 --> 02:57:23.180]  bad next time and I think what I see happening is everybody's been telling
[02:57:23.180 --> 02:57:26.500]  people it's okay you know the leaders in Europe the leaders in the US the
[02:57:26.500 --> 02:57:30.500]  Chinese oh we can manage this we can have a soft landing we can engineer our
[02:57:30.500 --> 02:57:35.420]  economy these people are gonna lose credibility because they told us it was
[02:57:35.420 --> 02:57:39.380]  gonna be okay Warren Buffett's telling people it's gonna be okay and I think
[02:57:39.380 --> 02:57:43.300]  he should shut up he's a great guy but he shouldn't be talking about economics
[02:57:43.300 --> 02:57:47.460]  because he doesn't understand the economy and he's misleading people people
[02:57:47.460 --> 02:57:51.060]  gonna be very upset and that's when they're gonna listen to the people who
[02:57:51.060 --> 02:57:54.660]  told them the right thing the first place I you know I'm popular with a
[02:57:54.660 --> 02:57:58.700]  certain group of people and in certain arenas like this CNBC has me on just as
[02:57:58.700 --> 02:58:02.380]  a contract person they don't agree with me they don't want to hear what I have
[02:58:02.380 --> 02:58:06.340]  to say but people are gonna remember people like you or I or other people
[02:58:06.340 --> 02:58:10.100]  said hey there's a problem here hey there's a crisis coming so people are
[02:58:10.100 --> 02:58:13.620]  gonna naturally listen to those people and not to the people that told them
[02:58:13.620 --> 02:58:20.500]  everything's okay we can manage sure Harry Dent I don't want to bug you too
