[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]  Not just the raw footage, it's been boiled down to ten minutes. Here's the photos, here's an article. Write articles for us, folks. If they're decent, I'll post them. Give us material. We'll try to build you up.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000]  Let me go to Matt Dayton, who I know is down there at college right now. Thanks for holding. Matt, tell us what happened Friday with Barack Obama.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:29.000]  This is round three as we're exposing him, and then tell us about the demolition of the Intel building and how you guys used that as another platform to expose 9-11.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:42.000]  Thanks for bringing me on again, Alex. I'll start with the Barack event. We knew cameras were going to be there. We knew it was going to be a huge event.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:55.000]  I decided it would be a good idea to just take a sign down there and see if I could get it on camera. That's what I did. I saw where all the video cameras were lined up.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:11.000]  I saw where Barack was going to be speaking, so I positioned myself in between. I put my neck out there, alienated myself from the masses of people. I don't know if you've seen the pictures, but it's just a sea of people.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000]  There's thousands of people, and a sea of Barack Obama signs handed out to them, all scripted. Here's this huge Investigate 9-11 poster right in front of him.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:42.000]  Images are the most powerful thing that we have. That's what they use against us, these photo ops, these PR events. If we can just do that in reverse and stage events like the Barack Obama and get photos like that out there, I think it can be effective.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:56.000]  My mom did a fantastic job taking the pictures. My friend did the filming. It was on News 8. Thousands of people saw the banner. It was a great experience.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:07.000]  I would really like for people out there to try and go to those rallies. Whenever Barack Obama or any other candidate comes to their town, just bring banners.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.000]  Obviously, he's total New World Order. People are like, is he good? If the national media is telling you he's the man, he's bad news, just like Hillary or Newt Gingrich or any of them.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]  Tell folks what happened with the media hissing at you, flipping you off, getting mad. Tell folks what happened.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000]  I planned to put up the sign right when he was coming out because I knew that was going to be the most usable footage for them.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:43.000]  Right when he was coming out, I just put my banner up and just held it there for a couple of minutes. I was just looking at all the media people and just seeing their faces turning red.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000]  One lady was pointing toward the ground, you know, get your sign out of the way. Another lady was fumbling with her camera and flicking me off.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]  It was actually quite hilarious.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000]  Now, let's be clear. At a rally where people could bring whatever signs they wanted, the mindset of the average American in the media is hissing.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:16.000]  How dare you not be part of the group thing? How dare you ruin something precious? You need to stop your speech, stop your communication, stop your First Amendment, stop being able to express yourself.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000]  How dare you, Matt Jayton, engage in such Al-Qaeda-esque activity? This is so un-American.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000]  I kept doing it. I would put it up every time. All the Barack Obama flyer banners would go up.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000]  Finally, some lady came down there and was just like, your sign is really, really in the way. I was like, I know.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]  She's like, well, we're just trying to do our job. I was like, so am I.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:52.000]  Yeah, lady, you're the media there to not control the event. You're the media there to shoot video of what happened. Don't you understand that?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]  Don't you understand? I mean, what's wrong with them?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]  What news station was this idiot with?
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  I'm not sure what she was with. She was a photographer, so she stepped in front of me because she couldn't get any good pictures.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000]  Now, let's understand. You're about three, four people back from the stage. I'd say you had the sign up about as high as his knees.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:21.000]  You weren't blocking the precious dear freshman senator, junior senator. You were there engaging in the First Amendment. How dare you?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]  I'm surprised they didn't come over and say there's a free speech zone over here. We decide which is speech and which isn't.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:40.000]  Yeah, you could hear the sort of mummer around me. Somebody mentioned something to me, but I was like, good thing I live in America that I can do this just real sarcastically because they were basically attacking me.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000]  Stop him. Look, he's communicating. Oh, my gosh. Oh, we've got to shut down the First Amendment.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]  And Newt Gingrich is saying ban the First Amendment. All over national TV they're saying arrest all of us.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000]  We're traitors, members of Congress who have an opinion on the war, evil. You're not supposed to have opinions. Just submit to them. Submit to the new America.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  Yeah, and then after that lady came down, she stepped in front of me and got her pictures.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000]  And then another guy came down and was just, you know, we really can't get any good pictures. Can you take it down?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:23.000]  And I was, you know, I'll think about it. And of course I would put it down and then, you know, put it back up. I didn't want to be mobbed.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]  But that would have been better, but that's what fake liberals do. They kind of come and peck on you and start grabbing on you.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]  Come on, let's be friends. Let's talk about it out of here. Come on. It's all right. Come on.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]  I mean, I've seen them at 9-11 events where they're having world can't wait stuff and somebody tries to ask a question and they all mob him.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000]  Stop him. Get him. It's like body snatchers. Don't let him. But you ought to be around neocons.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000]  They'll start going, get out of here, commie. You ought to be put in the camp. I listen to Savage.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.000]  Well, then I did it again. And the lady who had come down at the beginning tried to physically force my arms down.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]  You should have called the police there at that time.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000]  No, I just smiled. It was on News 8. You can see her trying to pull my arms down and me just laughing.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000]  We're going to post that in an article about this. So now you have them physically grabbing on you. Who was she with?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]  I'm not sure. It was the same lady who came down.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000]  Stop him. He's defaming our leader. Who will save us from Bush?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]  What else happened?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]  That's about it. We just put the banner up every time the other signs came up.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000]  We were pretty successful as far as getting the pictures that we wanted and getting the video that we sent over to y'all.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]  News 8, I got tons of people calling me like, saw you on News 8.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000]  All the other news, because we watched it, my staff did, was able to shoot from weird angles and cut the banner out.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]  There were some other 9-11 banners. We saw one that said 9-11 is an inside job. That was a pretty good one.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.000]  Right. I didn't even see that guy. There were very few people there who had any sort of 9-11 truth banners.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]  What did you say when this woman started grabbing you?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]  I would have said, that's assault. That gets their hands off you real quick.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000]  You want to be firm with them because they'll go ahead and assault you and then call the cops out and then say you assaulted them.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000]  It's very important to say, that's assault. Stop now before you go to jail. Just talk to them like children.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]  They're children. They'll take the brain-eating vaccine. They'll do whatever they're told.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]  They would march into gas chambers. They'll do whatever they're told.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:42.000]  Let's shift gears and talk about anything else that happened at that event because I don't want to talk about the controlled demolition downtown when they blew up the building.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:51.000]  I think that's about it. We got help getting a press pass to get up and get those pictures from that angle.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:00.000]  You're right in front of the big computer building that they never finished because Intel pulled out.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000]  They just built the big concrete steel skeleton. It's been there since the dot-com bust in the late 90s.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]  You've got images of a big sign saying controlled demolition. Tell folks what signs you had. What happened there?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  We brought one that says controlled demolition real big, bold letters.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]  Underneath it, it says World Trade Center 1, World Trade Center 2, and World Trade Center 7.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:33.000]  Me and another guy named Clayton grabbed that banner and held it up in front of the whole crowd, walked up and down the crowd showing that banner before the demolition.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]  Did you get video of that?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]  Yes, I believe we do.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000]  Clayton's got to get it over here. I'm salivating. We've got to get that video up ASAP, man. Come on. Bring it down.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000]  I'd like to play that on my TV show tonight because I'll be live on TV tonight. If you could drop that by.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:59.000]  The show's earlier now. It's 6 to 7. You could get over there by 5.30 or so. If it was on a mini-DV or a format I could play, we would just play it raw off the tape.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]  I haven't actually gone back and looked at the footage since I was holding the banner.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000]  Well, I've seen the stills. You've got the building blowing up with the signs. That's it. Tell folks about your website.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000]  Our website is PNACitizens.org. It's just a blog right now.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:29.000]  PNACitizens.org. We're grabbing all that and posting it on jonesreport.com. The Obama footage is going up, too. That'll be up by this evening as well.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:39.000]  Speaking of confrontations, I just wanted to let everyone know that Karl Rove is actually going to be speaking at Texas State University at 11 a.m.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000]  I believe in Evans Auditorium. That's tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]  That's the one in Georgetown, right?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]  No, in San Marcos.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]  Okay, I got them backwards. They changed the name of the San Marcos one. I'm brain dead.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]  What's the name again?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]  That is Evans Auditorium.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  So they don't call it Southwest Texas anymore. They call it ...
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]  Texas State, I believe.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]  That's why I got confused, yeah. Okay, and that's at Evans Auditorium at 11 a.m. tomorrow?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]  Mm-hmm.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]  Are you going to be down there?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  I'm going to try to make it. I want to get another ... What I originally wanted to do with the Bill Kristol event was do the same thing that we did with Obama and just get that image of a banner, something with him in the background, just maybe like tyrant.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]  Well, you also want to yell 9-11 is an inside job and you're one of the architects.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000]  Because those guys put on this arrogant front that they control reality and we're all just sitting on the sidelines. That's not the case.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:46.000]  Tomorrow, 11 a.m., folks, everybody get in there with your little video cameras, get them out, and people need to be there tomorrow.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]  Mm-hmm.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  Austin's becoming ... This whole Central Texas is becoming such a mecca for politics. I'll tell you, these snakes are here almost every week now.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:06.000]  Mm-hmm. So, yeah, we just got to capitalize on those events. I was on the news two times in one weekend, and all you have to do is just get out there, know where the stories are happening.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000]  One good thing to do is you can just have a little bullhorn. When they go to their live newsfeed, you can also bullhorn them.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]  Yeah.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]  That upsets them, but ...
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]  Absolutely.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000]  One time they were having a fake bio attack down at the DPS, and I went down there and told them it was staged. They had to admit it was staged later.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]  Right.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000]  They didn't like that. All right, so what were people saying and doing as you held up big signs saying controlled demolition?
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:37.000]  Oh, well, we actually got a good response at the beginning. We got several claps, but then after we were holding it up for a while, people were going,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  Don't hold that sign up. You're blocking our view of the real controlled demolition.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]  Stay there.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.000]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective, alternative, and natural medicine and education.

[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]  It's here. After a year in production and traveling the distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:01.000]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:09.000]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:21.000]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:31.000]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government crimes. Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:52.000]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle. Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.000]  Or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box, so it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:06.000]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available. So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:16.000]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:27.000]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals. This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:35.000]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39, get two for $70 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:13.000]  In the next hour, I'm going to play the clip of the NIST director saying that they haven't done any scientific research about why the towers fell, because they know why they fell.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:24.000]  There was no molten steel, and we cut all these clips of firefighters saying it. And it was Matt Dayton and his colleagues that put that together as well, and they played that before I spoke to a packed house over 900 at UT.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:33.000]  So this is how you take action. What else happened whenever you held up the big sign that said controlled demolition? And I haven't been watching the news. You're saying that also made it on the news?
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  Yeah, there was some live footage going on at the event, and I had my Investigate 9-11. I haven't actually seen the footage, but some people said they could definitely see it in the background holding up our sign.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]  So I know they didn't play that footage again.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:58.000]  Everywhere they go, every opportunity, that's all they see is 9-11 truth, and it's happening all over the nation. But we're leading the fight here. You're on the vanguard, my friend.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:17.000]  Absolutely, absolutely. And I also wanted to let your listeners know that tonight we're having an event in the UT Union Ballroom at 7.30. We're screening a film called Truth Be Told, and also with a short lecture by Hank Gilbert. So if anyone's interested in that, that'll be 7.30 tonight in the Union Ballroom.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]  What's the Truth Be Told about?
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:37.000]  Truth Be Told is basically exposing the Trans-Texas Corridor and the toll roads. I believe it features mostly in San Antonio. But just getting information out there to the people about that.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:52.000]  Good. Hey, great job. And I hope that somebody gets down there to confront his Lordship, the real head of the White House, Karl Rove, tomorrow. And then we've got here at UT David Gergen coming up on Thursday. Thank you for joining us.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]  Yes, thank you, Alex.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]  You bet.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]  We also have some clips from 60 Minutes concerning the war.
