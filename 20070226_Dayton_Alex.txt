[00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:01.090]  Not just the raw footage.
[00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:02.611]  It's been boiled down to 10 minutes.
[00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:03.912]  Here's the photos.
[00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:04.993]  Here's an article.
[00:00:04.993 --> 00:00:06.294]  Write articles for us, folks.
[00:00:06.294 --> 00:00:07.735]  If they're decent, I'll post them.
[00:00:07.735 --> 00:00:09.317]  Give us material.
[00:00:09.317 --> 00:00:11.518]  We'll try to build you up.
[00:00:11.518 --> 00:00:14.761]  Let me go to Matt Dayton, who I know is down there at college right now.
[00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:15.822]  Thanks for holding.
[00:00:15.822 --> 00:00:18.324]  Matt, tell us what happened Friday with Barack Obama.
[00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:28.066]  This is round three as we're exposing him, and then tell us about the demolition of the Intel building and how you guys used that as another platform to expose 9-11.
[00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:32.168]  Oh, well, first let me thank for, you know, bringing me on again, Alex.
[00:00:32.168 --> 00:00:36.410]  Yeah, I'll start with the Baraka event.
[00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.312]  Well, I mean, we knew cameras were going to be there.
[00:00:40.312 --> 00:00:45.654]  We knew it was going to be a huge event, and I decided it would be a good idea to just
[00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:50.201]  Take a sign down there and see if I could get it on camera.
[00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:52.523]  So, you know, basically that's what I did.
[00:00:52.523 --> 00:00:55.665]  I saw where all the video cameras were lined up.
[00:00:55.665 --> 00:00:58.468]  I saw where Brock was going to be speaking.
[00:00:58.468 --> 00:01:08.896]  And so I positioned myself in between and sort of put my neck out there, alienated myself from the masses of people.
[00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:10.517]  I don't know if you've seen the pictures, but it's just
[00:01:11.087 --> 00:01:20.210]  He has thousands of people in a sea of Barack Obama signs handed out to them, all scripted, and here's this huge Investigate 9-11 poster right in front of him.
[00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.972]  Yeah, I mean, and images are the most powerful thing that we have.
[00:01:24.972 --> 00:01:30.193]  It's all about, I mean, that's what they use against us, these photo ops, these PR events.
[00:01:30.193 --> 00:01:37.856]  And so if we can just do that, you know, in reverse, and sort of stage events like the Barack Obama and get
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.562]  Photos like that out there, I think it can be effective.
[00:01:42.562 --> 00:01:46.023]  My mom did a fantastic job taking the pictures.
[00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:50.745]  My friend did the filming and it was on News 8.
[00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:52.526]  Thousands of people saw the banner.
[00:01:52.526 --> 00:01:56.248]  It was a great experience.
[00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:07.884]  You know, for people out there to try and go to those rallies, and whenever Barack Obama or any other candidates come to their town, just bring banners, find where the cameras are.
[00:02:07.884 --> 00:02:09.825]  And obviously he's total New World Order.
[00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:11.647]  People are like, is he good?
[00:02:11.647 --> 00:02:14.789]  If the national media is telling you he's the man, he's bad news.
[00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.010]  Just like Hillary or Newt Gingrich or any of them.
[00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.333]  But tell folks what happened with the media hissing at you, flipping you off, getting mad.
[00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:23.134]  Tell folks what happened.
[00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:32.078]  Well, I planned to put up the sign right when he was coming out because I knew that was going to be the most usable footage for them.
[00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:38.421]  And so right when he was coming out, I just put my banner up and just held it there for a couple of minutes.
[00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:44.464]  I was just looking at all the media people and just see their faces turning red.
[00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:48.446]  One lady was pointing towards the ground, you know, get your sign out of the way.
[00:02:48.446 --> 00:02:51.128]  Another lady was fumbling with her camera and flicking me off.
[00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:54.129]  It was actually quite hilarious.
[00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.913]  Now let's be clear.
[00:02:55.646 --> 00:03:04.611]  At a rally where people could bring whatever signs they wanted, the mindset of the average American in the media is hissing, how dare you not be part of the group thing?
[00:03:04.611 --> 00:03:07.012]  How dare you ruin something precious?
[00:03:07.012 --> 00:03:16.257]  You need to stop your speech, stop your communication, stop your First Amendment, stop being able to express yourself.
[00:03:16.257 --> 00:03:22.060]  How dare you, Matt Dayton, engage in such al-Qaeda-esque activity?
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.301]  This is so un-American.
[00:03:24.302 --> 00:03:25.843]  Yeah, and so I kept doing it.
[00:03:25.843 --> 00:03:31.008]  I would put it up every time they would put up, you know, all the Barack Obama banners would go up.
[00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:37.013]  And finally some lady came down there and was just like, um, your sign is really, really in the way.
[00:03:37.013 --> 00:03:38.614]  And I was like, I know.
[00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:40.556]  And she's like, well, we're just trying to do our job.
[00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:41.417]  And I was like, so am I.
[00:03:42.802 --> 00:03:46.385]  Yeah, lady, you're the media there to not control the event.
[00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:50.187]  You're the media there to shoot video of what happened.
[00:03:50.187 --> 00:03:52.449]  Don't you understand that?
[00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:53.349]  Don't you understand?
[00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:54.570]  I mean, what's wrong with them?
[00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.711]  Yeah.
[00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:59.354]  What news station was this idiot with?
[00:03:59.354 --> 00:04:00.375]  I'm not sure what she was with.
[00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:04.158]  She was a photographer, so she stepped in front of me because she couldn't get any good pictures.
[00:04:04.158 --> 00:04:04.939]  Now let's understand.
[00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.823]  You're about three, four people back from the stage.
[00:04:08.823 --> 00:04:11.165]  I'd say you had the sign up about as high as his knees.
[00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:17.671]  You weren't blocking the precious dear freshman senator, junior senator.
[00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:19.693]  You were there engaging in the First Amendment.
[00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:20.073]  How dare you!
[00:04:21.714 --> 00:04:24.555]  I'm surprised they didn't come over and say there's a free speech zone over here.
[00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:26.376]  We decide which is speech and which isn't.
[00:04:38.542 --> 00:04:41.825]  Stop him Lucky!
[00:04:41.825 --> 00:04:43.227]  He's communicating!
[00:04:43.227 --> 00:04:44.949]  Oh my gosh!
[00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.431]  We've got to shut down the First Amendment!
[00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:49.653]  And Newt Gingrich is saying, ban the First Amendment!
[00:04:49.653 --> 00:04:52.156]  All over national TV they're saying, arrest all of us!
[00:04:52.156 --> 00:04:53.177]  We're traitors!
[00:04:53.177 --> 00:04:55.619]  Members of Congress who have an opinion on the war, evil!
[00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:57.001]  You're not supposed to have opinions!
[00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:58.602]  Just submit to them!
[00:04:58.602 --> 00:05:00.084]  Submit to the New America!
[00:05:01.847 --> 00:05:02.628]  I think so.
[00:05:24.486 --> 00:05:26.567]  That would have been better, but that's what fake liberals do.
[00:05:26.567 --> 00:05:28.607]  They kind of come and peck on you and start grabbing on you.
[00:05:28.607 --> 00:05:29.668]  Come on, let's be friends.
[00:05:29.668 --> 00:05:30.748]  Let's talk about it out here.
[00:05:30.748 --> 00:05:31.488]  Come on.
[00:05:31.488 --> 00:05:32.168]  It's alright.
[00:05:32.168 --> 00:05:32.968]  Come on.
[00:05:32.968 --> 00:05:39.250]  I mean, I've seen them at 9-11 events where they're having World Can't Wait stuff and somebody tries to ask a question and they all mob him.
[00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.970]  Stop him!
[00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:40.750]  Get him!
[00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.851]  It's like Body Snatchers.
[00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:43.531]  Don't let him!
[00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:44.991]  But you ought to be around Neocons.
[00:05:44.991 --> 00:05:47.472]  They'll start going, Get out of here, commie!
[00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:49.213]  You ought to be put in a camp!
[00:05:49.213 --> 00:05:50.393]  I listen to Savage!
[00:05:52.304 --> 00:05:59.790]  Well, then I did it again and the lady who had come down at the beginning tried to physically force my arms down.
[00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.412]  You should have called the police there at that time.
[00:06:01.412 --> 00:06:03.193]  No, I just smiled.
[00:06:03.193 --> 00:06:04.554]  It was on News 8.
[00:06:04.554 --> 00:06:08.498]  You can see her trying to pull my arms down and me just laughing.
[00:06:08.498 --> 00:06:10.860]  We're going to post that in an article about this.
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.982]  So now you have them physically grabbing on you.
[00:06:13.982 --> 00:06:14.643]  Who was she with?
[00:06:16.104 --> 00:06:16.604]  I'm not sure.
[00:06:16.604 --> 00:06:18.225]  It was the same lady who came down.
[00:06:18.225 --> 00:06:19.005]  Stop him!
[00:06:19.005 --> 00:06:21.146]  He's defaming our leader!
[00:06:21.146 --> 00:06:24.468]  Save us from Bush!
[00:06:24.468 --> 00:06:27.369]  What else happened?
[00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:28.370]  That's about it.
[00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.272]  We just put the banner up every time the other signs came up.
[00:06:33.272 --> 00:06:40.275]  We were pretty successful as far as getting the pictures that we wanted and getting the video that we sent over to y'all.
[00:06:41.963 --> 00:06:45.767]  I got tons of people calling me, like, saw you on News 8.
[00:06:45.767 --> 00:06:53.115]  Yeah, all the other news, because we watched it, my staff did, was able to shoot from weird angles and cut the banner out.
[00:06:53.115 --> 00:06:53.675]  Right.
[00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:55.057]  Now, there was some other 9-11 banners.
[00:06:55.057 --> 00:06:57.239]  We saw one that said 9-11's an inside job.
[00:06:57.239 --> 00:06:58.140]  That was a pretty good one.
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.522]  Right, yeah, I didn't even see that guy.
[00:06:59.522 --> 00:07:03.906]  I mean, there was very few people there who had any sort of 9-11.
[00:07:06.326 --> 00:07:08.227]  What did you say when this woman started grabbing you?
[00:07:08.227 --> 00:07:09.747]  I would have said, that's assault!
[00:07:09.747 --> 00:07:11.648]  And that gets their hands off you real quick.
[00:07:11.648 --> 00:07:18.130]  And see, you want to be firm with them because they'll go ahead and assault you, and then call the cops out, and then say you assaulted them.
[00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.370]  So it's very important to say, that's assault!
[00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.591]  Stop now before you go to jail.
[00:07:22.591 --> 00:07:23.871]  And just talk to them like children.
[00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:25.132]  They're children.
[00:07:25.132 --> 00:07:26.792]  They'll take the brain-eating vaccine.
[00:07:26.792 --> 00:07:29.053]  They'll do whatever they're told.
[00:07:29.053 --> 00:07:31.073]  They would march into gas chambers, man.
[00:07:31.073 --> 00:07:32.354]  They'll do whatever they're told.
[00:07:33.715 --> 00:07:37.538]  Now, let's shift gears and talk about, well, anything else that happened at that event?
[00:07:37.538 --> 00:07:42.481]  Because I don't want to talk about the control demolition downtown when they blew up the building.
[00:07:42.481 --> 00:07:44.642]  No, I mean, I think that's about it.
[00:07:44.642 --> 00:07:51.267]  We got help getting a press pass to get up and get those pictures from that angle.
[00:07:51.267 --> 00:07:52.968]  Yeah, you're right in front of the
[00:07:54.947 --> 00:08:11.220]  Big computer building that they never finished because Intel pulled out so they just built the big concrete steel skeleton and it's been there since the dot-com bust in the late 90s and so you've got images of a big sign saying controlled demolition.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.902]  Tell folks what signs you had, what happened there?
[00:08:13.902 --> 00:08:24.510]  Well we just we brought a one that says controlled demolition real big bold letters and underneath it it says World Trade Center 1, World Trade Center 2, and World Trade Center 7 and so me and another guy named Clayton
[00:08:25.146 --> 00:08:30.612]  Um, you know, grabbed that banner and held it up in front of the whole crowd, walked up and down the crowd.
[00:08:32.047 --> 00:08:35.070]  Did you get video of that?
[00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.012]  Yes, I believe we do.
[00:08:37.012 --> 00:08:40.234]  Clayton's got to get it over here, I'm salivating.
[00:08:40.234 --> 00:08:42.376]  We've got to get that video up ASAP, man.
[00:08:42.376 --> 00:08:44.518]  Come on, bring it down.
[00:08:44.518 --> 00:08:48.761]  I'd like to play that on my TV show tonight, because I'll be live on TV tonight.
[00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:52.565]  If you could drop that by, it shows earlier now, it's 6 to 7.
[00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:58.910]  If you could get over there by like 5.30 or so, if it was on a mini-DV or a format I could play, we would just play it raw off the tape.
[00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:09.795]  Yeah, I need to see... I haven't actually gone back and looked at the footage since I was holding the banner, so... Well, I've seen the stills, and you've got the building blowing up with the signs.
[00:09:09.795 --> 00:09:10.895]  And that's it.
[00:09:10.895 --> 00:09:12.756]  Tell folks about your website.
[00:09:12.756 --> 00:09:18.019]  Our website is PNACitizens.org.
[00:09:18.019 --> 00:09:19.139]  It's just a blog right now.
[00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:21.320]  We're working on a... PNACitizens.org.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.962]  And we're grabbing all that and posting it on JonesReport.com, the Obama footage.
[00:09:26.536 --> 00:09:40.043]  Speaking of confrontations, I just wanted to let everyone know that Karl Rove is actually going to be speaking at Texas State University at 11 a.m.
[00:09:40.043 --> 00:09:44.305]  I believe in Evans Auditorium.
[00:09:44.305 --> 00:09:46.546]  So that's tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[00:09:46.546 --> 00:09:47.927]  Now that's the one in Georgetown, right?
[00:09:47.927 --> 00:09:48.887]  No, in St.
[00:09:48.887 --> 00:09:49.167]  Marcus.
[00:09:51.056 --> 00:09:52.357]  Okay, I got them backwards.
[00:09:52.357 --> 00:09:54.098]  They changed the name of the Sam Marcus one.
[00:09:54.098 --> 00:09:55.559]  I'm brain dead.
[00:09:55.559 --> 00:09:58.781]  Okay, so what's the name again?
[00:09:58.781 --> 00:10:00.162]  That is Evans Auditorium.
[00:10:00.162 --> 00:10:01.803]  So they don't call it Southwest Texas anymore.
[00:10:01.803 --> 00:10:03.705]  They call it Texas State, I believe.
[00:10:03.705 --> 00:10:05.626]  That's why I got confused, yeah.
[00:10:05.626 --> 00:10:08.048]  Okay, and that's at Evans Auditorium at 11 a.m.
[00:10:08.048 --> 00:10:08.488]  tomorrow?
[00:10:08.488 --> 00:10:09.168]  Mm-hmm.
[00:10:09.168 --> 00:10:10.489]  Are you going to be down there?
[00:10:10.489 --> 00:10:12.170]  I'm going to try to make it.
[00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.971]  I want to get another
[00:10:13.729 --> 00:10:24.443]  What I originally wanted to do with the Bill Kristol event was, you know, do the same thing that we did with Obama and just get that image of a banner or something with him in the background, you know, just maybe like, tyrant.
[00:10:24.443 --> 00:10:28.588]  Well, you also want to yell, 9-11's an inside job and you're one of the architects.
[00:10:28.588 --> 00:10:30.090]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:36.495]  Because those guys put on this arrogant front that they control reality and we're all just sitting on the sidelines.
[00:10:36.495 --> 00:10:37.536]  That's not the case.
[00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:47.025]  Tomorrow, 11 a.m., folks, everybody get in there with your little video cameras, get them out, and people need to be there tomorrow.
[00:10:47.025 --> 00:10:51.289]  Austin's becoming, and this whole Central Texas is becoming such a mecca for politics.
[00:10:51.289 --> 00:10:53.310]  I tell you, these snakes are here almost every week now.
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.401]  So yeah, we just got to capitalize on those events.
[00:10:57.401 --> 00:11:06.524]  You know, I was on the news two times in one weekend, and all you have to do is just get out there and know where the stories are happening.
[00:11:06.524 --> 00:11:08.845]  One good thing to do is you can just have a little bullhorn.
[00:11:08.845 --> 00:11:11.226]  When they go to their live news feed, you can also bullhorn them.
[00:11:11.226 --> 00:11:12.907]  Yeah.
[00:11:12.907 --> 00:11:15.928]  That upsets them, but... Absolutely.
[00:11:15.928 --> 00:11:22.690]  One time they were having a fake bio attack, and I... Down at the DPS, when I went down there and told them it was staged, they had to admit it was staged later.
[00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:23.531]  Right.
[00:11:23.531 --> 00:11:24.171]  They didn't like that.
[00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:29.263]  Alright, so what were people saying and doing as you held up big signs saying controlled demolition?
[00:11:29.263 --> 00:11:33.864]  Oh, we actually got a good response at the beginning.
[00:11:33.864 --> 00:11:39.086]  We got several claps, but then after we were holding it up for a while, people were going, Boo!
[00:11:39.086 --> 00:11:41.027]  Don't hold that sign up, you're blocking our view!
[00:11:44.716 --> 00:11:53.121]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.

[00:12:47.373 --> 00:12:53.199]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:12:53.199 --> 00:13:00.847]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:13:01.542 --> 00:13:08.985]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:13:08.985 --> 00:13:20.710]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:24.692]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:13:24.692 --> 00:13:26.933]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:13:26.933 --> 00:13:30.795]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:14:03.053 --> 00:14:06.475]  So effective, you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[00:14:06.815 --> 00:14:16.422]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:20.164]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:14:20.164 --> 00:14:27.529]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[00:15:04.326 --> 00:15:12.870]  In the next hour, I'm going to play the clip of the NIST director saying that they haven't done any scientific research about why the towers fell, because they know why they fell.
[00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:17.232]  There was no molten steel, and we cut to all these clips of firefighters saying it.
[00:15:17.232 --> 00:15:24.475]  And it was Matt Dayton and his colleagues that put that together as well, and they played that before I spoke to a packed house with over 900 at UT.
[00:15:24.475 --> 00:15:25.696]  So this is how you take action.
[00:15:26.554 --> 00:15:30.659]  Um, what else happened whenever you held up the big sign that said, Control Demolition?
[00:15:30.659 --> 00:15:33.942]  And I haven't been watching the news, you're saying that also made it on the news?
[00:15:33.942 --> 00:15:46.615]  Um, yeah, there was some live footage going on, um, you know, at the event, and I had my Investigate 9-11, um, I haven't actually seen the footage, but some people said they could definitely see us in the background holding up our signs.
[00:15:47.031 --> 00:15:49.372]  So I know they didn't play that footage again.
[00:15:49.372 --> 00:15:53.272]  Everywhere they go, every opportunity, that's all they see is 9-11 Truth.
[00:15:53.272 --> 00:15:55.033]  And it's happening all over the nation.
[00:15:55.033 --> 00:15:56.513]  But we're leading the fight here.
[00:15:56.513 --> 00:15:58.294]  You're on the vanguard, my friend.
[00:15:58.294 --> 00:15:59.294]  Absolutely.
[00:15:59.294 --> 00:15:59.834]  Absolutely.
[00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:07.076]  And I also wanted to let your listeners know that tonight we're having an event in the UT Union Ballroom at 730.
[00:16:07.076 --> 00:16:13.117]  We're screening a film called Truth Be Told, and also with a short lecture by Hank Gilbert.
[00:16:13.615 --> 00:16:17.996]  So if anyone's interested in that, that'll be 7.30 tonight in Union Plaza.
[00:16:17.996 --> 00:16:20.797]  What's the truth be told about it?
[00:16:20.797 --> 00:16:30.119]  The truth be told is, I guess it's basically exposing the Trans-Texas Corridor and the toll road.
[00:16:30.119 --> 00:16:32.320]  I believe it features mostly in San Antonio.
[00:16:33.007 --> 00:16:36.810]  But just getting information out there to the people about that.
