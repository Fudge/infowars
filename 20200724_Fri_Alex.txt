[00:00.000 --> 00:13.680]  Broadcasting live from the U.N. Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex
[00:13.680 --> 00:22.840]  Jones show and now your host, David Knight.
[00:22.840 --> 00:34.640]  Welcome. It's Friday, July 24th, 2020. I'm David Knight, your host. We're going to take
[00:34.640 --> 00:40.000]  a look at what is going on with the lockdown. Again, we are at day 130 and I started counting
[00:40.000 --> 00:46.200]  this when the national orders went out from President Fauci because we had the last normal
[00:46.200 --> 00:54.040]  day. America was Friday the 13th, 2020 over the weekend. You had California, then New
[00:54.040 --> 00:58.640]  York decided they would lock down their states and then it was announced we're going to start
[00:58.640 --> 01:07.840]  doing all of the mother may I rules from Fauci and there's been no let up. We've gone further
[01:07.840 --> 01:13.840]  and further into this as we have gone on. As a matter of fact, when we look at the insanity
[01:13.840 --> 01:18.240]  that is happening here, we're going to take a look at the first pitch that was thrown
[01:18.240 --> 01:24.960]  out at the abnormal baseball games. They have cardboard fans that were set up. They're all
[01:24.960 --> 01:29.440]  kneeling in a circle at the two games that are there. President Trump will eventually
[01:29.440 --> 01:34.280]  be allowed, they say, someday to throw a ball out. But of course it was the man of the hour,
[01:34.280 --> 01:41.000]  the man in charge of our country, Fauci, who threw the pitch and this big pharmaceutical
[01:41.000 --> 01:48.800]  pitch man was way off base, just like he's been with all of his other projections. And
[01:48.800 --> 01:54.280]  as we look at the Washington Redskins, changing their name to the generic Washington football
[01:54.280 --> 02:00.840]  team, I think I have a suggestion. I think what they should consider, since we basically
[02:00.840 --> 02:06.040]  are being run now at big pharmaceutical companies, maybe they should call themselves a Washington
[02:06.040 --> 02:11.160]  fix. I think that would fit on a number of different levels because they're pushing
[02:11.160 --> 02:16.280]  vaccines. That's really where this is headed. It's amazing to see how this is going. And
[02:16.280 --> 02:21.360]  of course we've now had President Trump this week decide that he's going to start wearing
[02:21.360 --> 02:25.600]  the mask. This is going to last forever, he says. We don't know how long it's gonna get
[02:25.600 --> 02:31.720]  much worse before it gets better. And it did get worse. Yesterday he canceled the Republican
[02:31.720 --> 02:38.720]  convention. We can't have anybody criticizing the convention meeting. We cannot show that
[02:38.720 --> 02:43.360]  life can go on as normal. We will not leave. As a matter of fact, we will now choose to
[02:43.360 --> 02:50.080]  appease the maskers, the vaxxers, and every other aspect of this. And I got to say, when
[02:50.080 --> 02:58.520]  I look at this, it is the most pathetic situation I've seen in my life. I have seen Jimmy Carter
[02:58.520 --> 03:07.320]  because we had an American embassy taking hostage. And I began the program that begins
[03:07.320 --> 03:12.000]  before this one every day. America held hostage. I go back to the Nightline theme song that
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.040]  began with the Iranian hostage takeover of our embassy. And they held the hostages for
[03:18.040 --> 03:25.280]  about 400 days. They started it almost exactly one year before the election. And now we have
[03:25.280 --> 03:30.120]  been held hostage. We have seen a president, just like Jimmy Carter, absolutely powerless
[03:30.120 --> 03:34.720]  to do anything about it. And it's not a few people in an American embassy halfway across
[03:34.720 --> 03:42.240]  the world. It's each and every American, every business, pretty much every job for any independent
[03:42.240 --> 03:47.520]  businesses. The only people who are allowed to survive are going to be the national chains.
[03:47.520 --> 03:55.480]  Even in New York, and now LA, California, they have rules for what food is, what constitutes
[03:55.480 --> 04:00.920]  a meal. No, no, no, you can't have Cuomo chips. First, you can't have a drink at a bar even
[04:00.920 --> 04:05.400]  outside unless you're getting a meal. All right, well, we'll give people chips and we'll
[04:05.400 --> 04:10.760]  call them Cuomo chips. No, no, no, that's not a meal. We will now define what a meal
[04:10.760 --> 04:18.440]  is. We will tell you what you can and cannot do because this is totalitarianism, authoritarianism
[04:18.440 --> 04:24.520]  in every aspect of our life, every aspect of our life. And they have used this to usher
[04:24.520 --> 04:31.880]  in every one of the controls that they had planned for 2030. So when we look at this,
[04:31.880 --> 04:37.520]  I think this kind of malaise, not to mention the financial depression, the worst thing
[04:37.520 --> 04:43.440]  I've ever seen, and yet no backbone to stand up to this, not even to have a convention.
[04:43.440 --> 04:46.800]  Are we going to take a break? We're going to have some reports from Alex Jones and I'll
[04:46.800 --> 04:59.280]  be back at the bottom of the hour. Stay with us.
[04:59.280 --> 05:04.200]  It's Christmas in July. We ran the sale last year. It was very, very popular. And so I
[05:04.200 --> 05:09.120]  am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election
[05:09.120 --> 05:14.560]  year. And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt
[05:14.560 --> 05:19.080]  of 2020. It's the American Eagle, always spreading its wings, sitting at the top of
[05:19.080 --> 05:25.440]  Betsy Ross Clang. And the shirts are on sale right now in FullerStore.com. I got the idea
[05:25.440 --> 05:30.160]  from the Trump campaign, having a similar shirt to be called Nazi, which of course it
[05:30.160 --> 05:33.520]  isn't. And since it's so triggering to the leftist, the globalist, well, we're going
[05:33.520 --> 05:38.080]  to make sure there's even more of these on the streets to spread the word and exercise
[05:38.080 --> 05:42.760]  our First Amendment in the face of these tyrants. We also have store-wide free shipping, double
[05:42.760 --> 05:47.480]  Patriot points. So whatever great item it is that you want, store-wide free shipping,
[05:47.480 --> 05:52.720]  double Patriot points on your next order and at least 50% off across the board. Now I'm
[05:52.720 --> 05:55.400]  going to have to end this sale very, very soon because all these products are about to
[05:55.400 --> 06:02.400]  sell out. Just take advantage of it right now in FullerStore.com.
[06:25.400 --> 06:35.640]  You are witnessing the rollout of Event 201, a planetary world government operation to
[06:35.640 --> 06:43.880]  implement the AI takeover, the casual society, face-scanning the buy and sell. All of it
[06:43.880 --> 06:53.760]  is the forced transfer of our once open free civilization into the technocracy. Big tech,
[06:53.760 --> 07:00.880]  big pharma, the military industrial complex, it is all one giant system. And you have the
[07:00.880 --> 07:10.240]  Communist Chinese EU system, Hollywood system, competing with the Pentagon and the Anglo-American
[07:10.240 --> 07:18.120]  AI system, but it's all the same. And in the end, it enslaves all of humanity. A major
[07:18.120 --> 07:27.160]  Hollywood studio has a subsidiary that has face-scanning cameras and they're using it
[07:27.160 --> 07:32.080]  to enforce everyone wearing masks. So see, just as we told you, it's for the Chinese
[07:32.080 --> 07:38.640]  social score rollout. Oh, we're face-scanning you to make sure you're wearing the mask.
[07:38.640 --> 07:44.120]  Oh, and it can recognize just off your eyes and off the forehead who you are and you're
[07:44.120 --> 07:50.280]  going to be reported and get in trouble. The robot enforcers are here. The age of man is
[07:50.280 --> 07:56.840]  ending if the globalists have their way. In fact, you're not supposed to say man or woman.
[07:56.840 --> 08:05.480]  It's not inclusive of the transhumanism. Nothing can have any name because nothing has an identity.
[08:05.480 --> 08:11.480]  Nothing has any right to even exist. We are a disposable society. We made our babies disposable,
[08:11.480 --> 08:18.960]  our old people disposable. So now we are disposable and it's with a very heavy heart that I see
[08:18.960 --> 08:24.960]  Trump who just a few weeks ago started moving down the right path and exposing Fauci and
[08:24.960 --> 08:33.560]  Gates and the UN and the COVID-19 fraud and the Wuhan lab and the NIH to now coming out
[08:33.560 --> 08:40.160]  and endorsing the vaccines and endorsing the mask and going along with the fraud. When
[08:40.160 --> 08:47.040]  everyone I talked to, almost everyone on the street is awake and knows that this is a fraud.
[08:47.040 --> 08:53.920]  I was in a line this morning at a coffee shop and had three of the, I don't know, twelve
[08:53.920 --> 08:57.280]  or so people who were in line to check my hand and take pictures with me showing they
[08:57.280 --> 09:05.320]  were awake. It's just a bellwether, a gauge of how awake folks are. Then I heard two middle-aged
[09:05.320 --> 09:14.160]  gentlemen behind me talking about how in a major port of Georgia, this is at Savannah,
[09:14.160 --> 09:19.280]  how a bunch of the warehouses had shut down because if one employee gets COVID, all the
[09:19.280 --> 09:25.760]  other employees demand to go home and get their paycheck and now that company can't
[09:25.760 --> 09:31.360]  catch up and is losing all its customers and going out of business. It was a flooring company,
[09:31.360 --> 09:36.920]  a major flooring company that had more than 40 warehouses around the country and it's
[09:36.920 --> 09:43.360]  not just happening in Georgia. It's happening all over the nation. This is the plan. When
[09:43.360 --> 09:48.200]  you have just-on-time delivery and this infrastructure, once it gets disrupted, it implodes. So, yes,
[09:48.200 --> 09:54.200]  it made everything very convenient, but it made us domesticated. It made us very one
[09:54.200 --> 09:59.840]  crop. It made us where we weren't resilient and so we're totally dependent on GPS. We're
[09:59.840 --> 10:04.160]  totally dependent on electricity. We're totally dependent on computers and then the technocrats,
[10:04.160 --> 10:08.440]  the people that control all of that, are able to rig it however they want and now they're
[10:08.440 --> 10:13.840]  rolling out all the robots to replace us in farm jobs and factories and to surveil us
[10:13.840 --> 10:19.760]  and we're told, stay in your home, social distance. There's nothing social again about
[10:19.760 --> 10:25.560]  social distancing. All of it is doublespeak and then other people in the line were like,
[10:25.560 --> 10:31.360]  I'm going, yeah, Alex, we know you're right. My cousin, my brother, my father, three more
[10:31.360 --> 10:38.640]  people said they all got calls saying they had COVID-19 never tested. I was in a swimwear
[10:38.640 --> 10:43.480]  shop at my wife's estate, even shopped videos, part of the interaction and there were at
[10:43.480 --> 10:49.480]  least eight women that came in there and I'm sitting there on a chair waiting for my wife
[10:49.480 --> 10:54.640]  trying clothes on and they start talking about how it's all a hoax and so I start talking
[10:54.640 --> 10:59.520]  to them and one lady's family member is at the governor's level and knows about the
[10:59.520 --> 11:05.240]  fraud. I mean, that's what's going on here. This is just crazy. We know it's all a giant
[11:05.240 --> 11:14.760]  fraud but still it's right there in plain view moving forward and it was perfectly psychologically
[11:14.760 --> 11:17.960]  tested because they knew a lot of people won't want to go to work. A lot of people want to
[11:17.960 --> 11:23.440]  stay home so they said, oh, just two weeks, flatten the curve, don't overwhelm the hospitals.
[11:23.440 --> 11:30.000]  All that was a lie and here we are six months later and now they're saying COVID will be
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.480]  with us for the rest of our lives and we're always going to have to wear a mask and new
[11:34.480 --> 11:39.360]  masks are coming out. We'll have to be approved and there'll be face scanners and robots and
[11:39.360 --> 11:46.160]  police to control us. Boom. Snap your fingers. You're inside the new world war. Then there
[11:46.160 --> 11:53.080]  is this extremely powerful Greg Rees report titled, Everyone Will Test Positive for COVID-19
[11:53.080 --> 11:58.840]  and he lays out how again on the CDC's own website, anyone who's had a Corona or even
[11:58.840 --> 12:08.120]  bacterial or flu infection in the last two to 10 years will test positive and how major
[12:08.120 --> 12:15.360]  studies are out that indeed as previous studies said, 5G pushes viruses. The previous studies
[12:15.360 --> 12:21.720]  were before Corona popped up on COVID-19, push it across the cell membrane into the
[12:21.720 --> 12:28.760]  nuclei and then actually resonates them and helps them grow by the vibrations. Now they
[12:28.760 --> 12:37.160]  have that earlier studies on other viruses, but now it's confirmed with COVID-19. So again,
[12:37.160 --> 12:43.080]  COVID-19 is a real virus. It's a kind of so gates can own it and have new versions that
[12:43.080 --> 12:48.080]  come out like new windows programs that come out that are more deadly. And he said, this
[12:48.080 --> 12:53.840]  is just a drill on cobearer. More is coming. Terrorists are going to release a bio weapon.
[12:53.840 --> 12:58.400]  And so this group is all in on this. It's about depopulation. It's about control. It's
[12:58.400 --> 13:02.680]  about world government. And all these different pundits and people I can now tell you are
[13:02.680 --> 13:07.000]  in on it. Cobear is in on it. They're all in on it. They love it. They go hang out with
[13:07.000 --> 13:12.920]  gates. They hang out with Fauci. They hang out with Jeffrey Epstein. So we'll know what
[13:12.920 --> 13:18.520]  Jeffrey Epstein was cooking up, bribing and framing and blackmailing all these scientists.
[13:18.520 --> 13:21.960]  The billions of dollars over the last 20 years. This is what he was doing along with
[13:21.960 --> 13:27.520]  many others just like him. And this is how they've gotten control of the scientific establishment.
[13:27.520 --> 13:32.680]  Thousands of microbiologists have been murdered, executed, run over, shot in the head, sacrificed.
[13:32.680 --> 13:36.280]  A bunch of them have been, quote, killed by Satan cults. Look it up. Microbiologists
[13:36.280 --> 13:42.960]  and life, you know, killed and satanic ritual. One in Virginia and another was in California.
[13:42.960 --> 13:47.120]  You cannot again make this up, ladies and gentlemen. There is armies of evil that have
[13:47.120 --> 13:54.520]  been preparing and building and are now rolling out and they're publicly keeping babies alive
[13:54.520 --> 14:00.480]  and then selling their organs. They're publicly rolling out deadly vaccines that actually
[14:00.480 --> 14:09.960]  go in and change our DNA. And now President Trump, President Trump is capitulating to
[14:09.960 --> 14:18.120]  the whole thing and it is completely and absolutely horrific and a very, very sad day because
[14:18.120 --> 14:24.000]  he needed to frontally assault us and expose the fraud. He tried to do it. I know they
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.160]  brought him internal polls, which I believe they're not manipulating as well, but it's
[14:27.160 --> 14:32.120]  the public polls and showed him that he was losing and that this would be popular. And
[14:32.120 --> 14:38.480]  now he's taken the bait. He's gone to the trap and they're going to now blame him for
[14:38.480 --> 14:45.440]  COVID-19. They're now officially calling it the bottom front virus. So compliance with
[14:45.440 --> 14:51.480]  this submission to this is only going to make things worse. This is a segment two. I want
[14:51.480 --> 14:57.800]  Troyer and David Knight and others to take it over. I'll be back. I'll be back tonight.
[14:57.800 --> 15:05.480]  We're going to come back and play the Gregory's report, which is posted at Bandod video. Everyone
[15:05.480 --> 15:09.560]  will test positive for COVID-19. Of course, you're all suspects. You're all bad. And again,
[15:09.560 --> 15:14.800]  this is organized fraud. They're skipping animal trials with the vaccines on purpose.
[15:14.800 --> 15:19.280]  They are putting out fraudulent test results on purpose. They're engaging in all of this
[15:19.280 --> 15:22.960]  and saying hospitals are full and no one's in them on purpose. They're just training
[15:22.960 --> 15:29.640]  you to accept total lies and fraud. This is a war. The Pentagon accurately says the Cold
[15:29.640 --> 15:35.400]  War was World War III. World War IV is now. It's psychological. It's medical. It's cultural.
[15:35.400 --> 15:40.000]  And it's shutting down our economy. Something that bombers couldn't do, something that,
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.960]  you know, that nuclear weapons couldn't do is take our resolve away and make us want
[15:43.960 --> 15:49.400]  to be slaves. But this has got people on their knees begging to be slaves. So please, for
[15:49.400 --> 15:53.040]  you and your families, say everyone's safe, keep spreading the word because there is a
[15:53.040 --> 15:58.040]  big awakening happening, but it's not happening fast enough. Take action now or be destroyed.
[15:58.040 --> 16:02.480]  Hey, self-reliance gardeners. Now that you've got your crisis garden planted, the next step

[16:39.640 --> 16:45.200]  a balanced blend of macronutrients from cold water fish. The result? Vegetables grow faster
[16:45.200 --> 16:51.560]  than ever because they now have the essential bioavailable nutrients they need. Go to growlikecrazy.com

[17:59.360 --> 18:03.880]  Much of the United States bureaucracy, all of Hollywood and most of our media is under
[18:03.880 --> 18:07.800]  international banking control. The United Nations was set up by the Rothschilds and
[18:07.800 --> 18:14.200]  Rockefellers on record to carry out this operation. Now, under the guise of medical security, they're
[18:14.200 --> 18:19.400]  bringing us medical tyranny. That we see much of the federal government, the Democrats,
[18:19.400 --> 18:24.400]  the Republicans, all saying except for Trump and a few people that we need a nationwide
[18:24.400 --> 18:31.200]  force mask mandate to make everyone wear a mask. Even though just months ago we had the
[18:31.200 --> 18:34.840]  Surgeon General and others say don't wear a mask, it's all a fraud. Now they say you
[18:34.840 --> 18:39.720]  must wear a mask. It's a sign of slavery. It's a sign of submission. I know you as
[18:39.720 --> 18:43.720]  listeners understand that. We need sheriffs and county commissioners and city councils
[18:43.720 --> 18:49.840]  and others to stand up and say we are sanctuary cities for reality and for state and local
[18:49.840 --> 18:54.240]  sovereignty against the globalist. This isn't the federal government taking over. It's
[18:54.240 --> 18:59.160]  the UN through the federal government and we as American citizens must say no.
[18:59.160 --> 19:02.800]  Another part of the Great Awakening that's taking place is people that haven't even been
[19:02.800 --> 19:08.360]  religious or Christian now see how evil is out in the open, how hundreds of churches
[19:08.360 --> 19:14.560]  have been burned in Europe and the U.S. Hundreds of Christian icons have been burned destroyed.
[19:14.560 --> 19:18.360]  Jesuses have had their heads cut off all over the country, all over the Philippines, all
[19:18.360 --> 19:23.000]  over Europe. Virgin Mary's are getting torn down. I mean crosses are being torn down.
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.840]  It's absolutely out of control but people now understand that evil was always real.
[19:27.840 --> 19:33.520]  It is spiritual and it was just waiting to make its move, building beneath the surface
[19:33.520 --> 19:37.520]  and now it's emerged. That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer I mean
[19:37.520 --> 19:41.480]  it. I'm praying for America. I'm praying for you and I know the power of prayer is real
[19:41.480 --> 19:46.040]  and God hears it. We need to come together and pray for even greater awakening, pray
[19:46.040 --> 19:51.400]  for Donald Trump to be protected, pray for him to win a landslide and pray for the people
[19:51.400 --> 19:56.120]  under deception of the globalist to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom. God bless
[19:56.120 --> 20:02.080]  you all. Please pray for him for worse as well.
[20:02.080 --> 20:14.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. We know that the prescribed PCR tests are not
[20:14.920 --> 20:22.280]  detecting the COVID-19 genome. According to the CDC's own literature the tests do not
[20:22.280 --> 20:30.160]  rule out bacterial infection or other viruses. They are detecting all varieties of coronavirus
[20:30.160 --> 20:36.920]  including the common cold and counting it as COVID-19 and it has been pointed out for
[20:36.920 --> 20:43.800]  months that the geographical locations experiencing the most cases of COVID also seem to have
[20:43.800 --> 20:51.720]  active 5G technology. After a video went viral in which David Ike suggested that 5G is somehow
[20:51.720 --> 20:58.520]  responsible for positive cases of COVID-19, YouTube deleted it and began deleting all
[20:58.520 --> 21:04.880]  videos on the subject. Including a video we made that pointed out how on October 31st
[21:04.880 --> 21:15.560]  of 2019 Wuhan, China became the first major testbed of 5G technology. In late June a new
[21:15.560 --> 21:22.840]  scientific research paper entitled 5G technology and induction of coronavirus in skin cells
[21:22.840 --> 21:30.160]  was published. This paper gives a scientific explanation of the relationship between 5G
[21:30.160 --> 21:38.200]  technology and the coronavirus. Unlike 4G or other radio waves, the 5G millimeter waves
[21:38.200 --> 21:45.960]  can penetrate the nucleus of a cell. The DNA then acts as an inductor. It reacts to the
[21:45.960 --> 21:53.240]  5G waves by producing an electromagnetic field. Like a shadow, the shape of the electromagnetic
[21:53.240 --> 22:00.680]  field reflects the hexagonal and pentagonal shapes of the DNA-based pairs. This electromagnetic
[22:00.680 --> 22:07.680]  field produces holes in the cellular liquid. Hexagonal pentagonal voids are created in
[22:07.680 --> 22:15.000]  a nucleoplasm. And to remedy this disturbance, extra bases are created to fill the voids.
[22:15.000 --> 22:21.360]  These bases then join together to produce coronavirus-like structures within the cell,
[22:21.360 --> 22:29.080]  which the PCR test will read as a positive case of COVID-19.
[22:29.080 --> 22:36.680]  The exosome. The exosome was discovered in 1983. Exosomes are created naturally within
[22:36.680 --> 22:44.760]  the cell to clean and repair cellular damage. Both exosomes and COVID-19 are the same size
[22:44.760 --> 22:53.760]  and shape. They both have the same ACE2 receptor. And they both contain RNA. Exosomes behave
[22:53.760 --> 23:00.240]  and appear the same as a virus. Some scientists even claim that the so-called virus is in
[23:00.240 --> 23:08.560]  fact the exosome. Since the discovery of the exosome, over 200 microbiologists have been
[23:08.560 --> 23:16.760]  murdered, committed suicide, or died in a suspicious manner. If you question this mystery, you
[23:16.760 --> 23:23.480]  are undoubtedly labeled a conspiracy theorist. And if you question the current unproven virus
[23:23.480 --> 23:30.600]  theory, you are labeled a science denier. The only socially acceptable solution that
[23:30.600 --> 23:38.160]  you are allowed to accept is an experimental vaccine that will alter your DNA, which ultimately
[23:38.160 --> 23:46.560]  raises the question, who owns your body? For Infowars.com, this is Greg Reis.
[23:46.560 --> 23:51.000]  What we're actually seeing is the systematic implementation of the fall of the Republic
[23:51.000 --> 23:56.400]  and the rise of the corporation of the United States. Every major event is a step in the
[23:56.400 --> 24:02.080]  ladder to achieve that end. COVID is just another rung in the ladder, which is why there's
[24:02.080 --> 24:07.640]  a deliberate mixing of all the word play, right? I mean, we should stop calling it quarantine.
[24:07.640 --> 24:13.240]  That's a term designated for people that are verified sick. This is a house arrest mandated
[24:13.240 --> 24:18.080]  by the state. You should stop calling it social distancing. There's nothing social about
[24:18.080 --> 24:23.560]  forced isolation. We should stop saying safer at home when millions of Americans don't have
[24:23.560 --> 24:28.240]  basic necessities adequate to fit their needs. It assumes that everybody's home is equally
[24:28.240 --> 24:33.000]  as safe as the people that are making the statements. We should stop saying, you know,
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.360]  this is for the greater good, right? When you close the economy, killing millions of
[24:37.360 --> 24:43.240]  businesses that families have worked generations to establish, that's anything but good. We
[24:43.240 --> 24:48.560]  should stop saying this is the new normal. That's just Blake mind control drivel. There's
[24:48.560 --> 24:52.640]  nothing normal about forced isolation, you know, treating your neighbor like they have
[24:52.640 --> 24:57.040]  the plague, breathing your own bodily waste, wearing masks, living in constant fear of
[24:57.040 --> 25:03.720]  contamination. That's normal. I mean, after all, if the virus is so daily, why hasn't
[25:03.720 --> 25:08.120]  wiped out the homeless who don't social distance, wash themselves regularly, let alone, you
[25:08.120 --> 25:14.880]  know, live in or have access to a sterile environment. Last year, 1.5 million people
[25:14.880 --> 25:20.840]  died of tuberculosis. While were you not wearing a mask during the tuberculosis pandemic?
[25:20.840 --> 25:25.000]  You were endangering, you know, public health and safety along with billions of other people
[25:25.000 --> 25:31.360]  around the globe. So why don't you wear a mask? I'll tell you why. Because the mainstream
[25:31.360 --> 25:38.040]  media didn't tell you to wear a mask, right? And so because, because though 1.5 million
[25:38.040 --> 25:45.120]  people died from tuberculosis, there was no tuberculosis pandemic any more than there's
[25:45.120 --> 25:52.400]  a coronavirus pandemic. What you're really participating in is a beta test for AI systems
[25:52.400 --> 25:57.800]  and face recognition. See, these cameras work best when people are, you know, distanced
[25:57.800 --> 26:03.520]  apart. Now that now they're actually testing through machine learning how to recognize,
[26:03.520 --> 26:07.960]  you know, a face that's partially covered. It's also a way to easily determine who's
[26:07.960 --> 26:14.720]  compliant and who's not. Who does the propaganda work on and who it doesn't? Now get this,
[26:14.720 --> 26:19.320]  you know, there, there's some ironies that are here, right? So a society that kills millions
[26:19.320 --> 26:26.120]  of babies a year for convenience has shut itself down to prevent adults from dying. People
[26:26.120 --> 26:30.640]  that on the one hand slaughter babies in the womb by the millions are now preaching to
[26:30.640 --> 26:37.280]  the masses about the sanctity of human life. It's double speak, double talk. It's the two,
[26:37.280 --> 26:42.160]  it's the two doctrine policy, one for the initiated, one for the uninitiated, one for
[26:42.160 --> 26:47.640]  the inner circle, another for the masses. It's like saying, you know, if I violate the
[26:47.640 --> 26:51.200]  stay at home order, I can be arrested, but you're letting convicted criminals out of
[26:51.200 --> 27:00.040]  prison so they don't get Corona virus thesis, antithesis, synthesis. If there's a real
[27:00.040 --> 27:06.240]  pandemic, doesn't require, you know, a faulty virus models, rig test results, 81% false
[27:06.240 --> 27:12.680]  positives, inaccurate news reporting stage, hospital overruns, manipulated death certificates.
[27:12.680 --> 27:19.480]  Nope. You know, when the government shuts down the millions of small businesses but
[27:19.480 --> 27:25.920]  doesn't lay off any government employees, it's not about the health. When the state
[27:25.920 --> 27:30.960]  bans dentists from practicing, but deems it necessary for abortion clinics to stay open,
[27:30.960 --> 27:37.280]  it's not about your health. When the state prevents you from buying seeds for your garden
[27:37.280 --> 27:43.120]  but allows you to purchase lottery tickets, it's not about your health. An institution
[27:43.120 --> 27:48.760]  that has the ability to destroy all of earth through, you know, alleged nuclear warfare
[27:48.760 --> 27:54.280]  should not regulate personal self-defense. You know, an institution that's caught trafficking
[27:54.280 --> 28:01.120]  drugs shouldn't be able to regulate plants. An institution that's racked up 23 trillion
[28:01.120 --> 28:10.520]  prior to Corona virus in debt shouldn't be allowed to manage the retirement fund. An
[28:10.520 --> 28:18.200]  institution that was caught spreading STDs should not be allowed to run healthcare.
[28:18.200 --> 28:23.480]  Like people are really concerned about public health and safety, you know, in general, but
[28:23.480 --> 28:28.120]  you know, they don't care if people, you know, eat garbage, drink poison, smoke cancer and
[28:28.120 --> 28:32.760]  take prescription drugs, but think that toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and mask are going
[28:32.760 --> 28:36.680]  to protect them from the boogeyman Corona virus. You know, this is a special kind of
[28:36.680 --> 28:43.400]  stupid that I can't address here. You should ask yourself some, a couple basic questions.
[28:43.400 --> 28:47.680]  When did you consent from, you know, you creating a government to serve you to you serving
[28:47.680 --> 28:54.000]  the government ruling over you? If you want to know, you know, who's in charge, just
[28:54.000 --> 29:23.000]  think about who you can.

[32:36.160 --> 32:37.160]  can find out there.
[32:37.160 --> 33:04.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:04.160 --> 33:33.800]  Yeah, I think it's three strikes for President Trump this week. He's turned into a pitchman
[33:33.800 --> 33:38.080]  for the big pharmaceutical companies telling everybody you got to wear masks and now caving
[33:38.080 --> 33:45.680]  on the Republican Convention in Florida. And as the baseball season supposedly starts,
[33:45.680 --> 33:51.760]  there's Fauci with his wild pitches, the pitchman for big pharmaceutical companies, as I said
[33:51.760 --> 33:58.360]  before, way off base. And he has been that way for now 130 days that we've been locked
[33:58.360 --> 34:04.000]  down. You know, we look at this and I'm not a big sports fan, especially not baseball.
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.720]  But let's talk about this because I guess a lot of you are there. They're still playing
[34:08.720 --> 34:13.520]  games even though there's no fans. But you know, we always heard the expression as American
[34:13.520 --> 34:19.720]  as mom, apple pie, baseball. Well, you know, we can strike off mom and baseball now, I
[34:19.720 --> 34:23.400]  guess are going to come for apple pie next. And that might not be too difficult because
[34:23.400 --> 34:29.480]  you know, they shut down all the food factories. You get one person identified as positive for
[34:29.480 --> 34:33.600]  COVID. I said no more meat. We're going to shut down the biggest meat companies. And
[34:33.600 --> 34:42.320]  so maybe the apple pies are next. You know, we never did have any featured stories at
[34:42.320 --> 34:48.680]  CNN and the drudge report about how all those meat packing employees died. Did we maybe
[34:48.680 --> 34:52.480]  they're holding them for August to let us know that right because now we're getting stories
[34:52.480 --> 34:57.840]  about nuns who died at a Catholic convent two months ago. They're curating that as well
[34:57.840 --> 35:03.680]  and pushing that out. But wouldn't you think that when we had a couple of cases of people
[35:03.680 --> 35:08.940]  testing positive for COVID-19 and we shut down our meat production, we started having
[35:08.940 --> 35:16.360]  shortages and rationing in America, America. So how American is that? We started having
[35:16.360 --> 35:22.460]  that. Wouldn't you expect that if we had people who had died from that that would be all over
[35:22.460 --> 35:29.840]  the news? Kind of like CPAC member when CPAC was held at the very beginning of all this.
[35:29.840 --> 35:34.880]  And the left, the radical left was rejoicing. They said, look at this. We allegedly had
[35:34.880 --> 35:39.960]  somebody who has tested positive for COVID-19. And he was in close proximity to all these
[35:39.960 --> 35:44.920]  Republicans and these Republican politicians. They're all going to die. I can't wait to
[35:44.920 --> 35:49.920]  see this happen. Well, nothing happened. Did it? Nothing happened. We had some senators
[35:49.920 --> 35:56.200]  who quarantined and so forth, but nothing happened. So when we look at this, you have
[35:56.200 --> 36:03.440]  Fauci, the hero. And as I tweeted out yesterday, yeah, you know, the hashtag Fauci is a hero.
[36:03.440 --> 36:07.080]  That's all over the place. And he gets to make the rules. And I'm sure that under the
[36:07.080 --> 36:12.280]  new rules that he's set up for baseball, he just struck out the opponent, even though
[36:12.280 --> 36:16.680]  he didn't come anywhere close to the pitcher or the mound or anything else, because, you
[36:16.680 --> 36:21.680]  know, he makes the rules. And this guy who says that this has become our worst nightmare
[36:21.680 --> 36:27.080]  and it isn't going to end ever. It has. He's right about that. It's one thing he said that's
[36:27.080 --> 36:33.800]  true, but it has become his dream scenario. As a matter of fact, a dream scenario for
[36:33.800 --> 36:38.160]  big pharmaceutical companies as well, who he's become the pitch man for along with
[36:38.160 --> 36:42.440]  President Trump, you know, the two of them, kind of like a Sinatra and Kelly, you know,
[36:42.440 --> 36:47.680]  they're out there with a song and dance tap shoe. Oh, it's going to last forever. You
[36:47.680 --> 36:53.240]  got to wear the mask, shut down the conventions, take the vaccines. I'm going to fund them
[36:53.240 --> 36:57.840]  more than Bill Gates. That's what President Trump is doing now with Operation Warp Speed.
[36:57.840 --> 37:03.480]  He's a bigger pusher of vaccines than Bill Gates ever was. If you want to put a dollar
[37:03.480 --> 37:10.280]  figure on this, not even close. So they've written the script and they're going to take
[37:10.280 --> 37:17.000]  you out of the ballgame folks. I mean, Fauci is enjoying his time in the limelight. Think
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.560]  about this. He's 79 years old, but it has finally worked out for him. You know, he went
[37:21.560 --> 37:31.080]  to the NIH at the NIAID where they push vaccines. He went there in 1985 and by 1986 he got Ronald
[37:31.080 --> 37:39.760]  Reagan to sign on to the immunity bill for vaccine companies where you cannot sue them
[37:39.760 --> 37:44.720]  for damage that they do to you. Any adverse effects, including death, you can't sue them.
[37:44.720 --> 37:50.680]  He got that protection for them right away with just one year in there. I mean, he was
[37:50.680 --> 37:57.120]  their guy and he's put in a good 35 years and now he is reaping the benefit. He is a
[37:57.120 --> 38:04.400]  celebrity. He throws out the first pitch of the season and he is on the cover of magazines,
[38:04.400 --> 38:11.760]  wearing sunglasses. I mean, this guy is living life like a boss because he is the boss. He
[38:11.760 --> 38:18.000]  is the boss of everything in America. He has set up the Simon Says America where you don't
[38:18.000 --> 38:23.840]  do anything unless Simon says, I mean, Fauci says, Fauci says this, Fauci says that. Can
[38:23.840 --> 38:30.560]  I do this, Fauci? And this is what's happened from the White House flowing down through
[38:30.560 --> 38:37.720]  the governor's offices, the Republicans as well as the Democrats. And so as Fauci is
[38:37.720 --> 38:43.560]  throwing out the first ball, Donald Trump has been promised that the same team, the Yankees
[38:43.560 --> 38:48.880]  that he was there said, well, we're going to let you throw one out sometime this year.
[38:48.880 --> 38:55.240]  How about that? Give him a little bit. Fauci is the main guy. You will give you something
[38:55.240 --> 39:00.800]  a little bit later. Trump said, I said to him, I said, how's the crowd going to be? It's
[39:00.800 --> 39:06.200]  like if you don't have a crowd, there's no such thing. Oh, that's right. Well, you might
[39:06.200 --> 39:12.600]  want to ask Fauci, Trump, because he's in control. You aren't. Trump praised the Major
[39:12.600 --> 39:18.280]  League Baseball decision to play, describing it as a great boost for Americans. He says,
[39:18.280 --> 39:22.920]  I really think it's good that baseball is opening. It's a tremendous thing psychologically
[39:22.920 --> 39:27.520]  for our country. Is it really? Let's take a look at the psychological aspects of this.
[39:27.520 --> 39:33.160]  Look at this. Every player and coach on the Yankees and Nationals, that game where Fauci
[39:33.160 --> 39:42.040]  threw it out, every one of them kneels prior to the national anthem. Every one of them
[39:42.040 --> 39:48.560]  kneeling. I mean, it always anybody watching this anymore. Of course, the stands are completely
[39:48.560 --> 39:53.080]  empty now, but that's because of Fauci. It wasn't widely expected that every player would
[39:53.080 --> 39:59.080]  do this, but they knelt in protest in front of an empty stadium. So think about this.
[39:59.080 --> 40:02.320]  We've got an empty stadium because of Fauci. We've got these people kneeling because the
[40:02.320 --> 40:11.840]  Antifa BLM Soros left. The left is completely in control of the media. They are completely
[40:11.840 --> 40:17.640]  in control of everything you see. They're completely in control of the economy where
[40:17.640 --> 40:25.200]  you work, what you buy. They have consolidated their control. You ought to be very concerned
[40:25.200 --> 40:30.320]  about this. Everything that you see, as a matter of fact, you know, before we had the
[40:30.320 --> 40:39.160]  masks, we had the gag orders, didn't we? And it was the gag orders on social media shutting
[40:39.160 --> 40:43.520]  down conservatives, shutting down everybody else that has allowed them to put the gags
[40:43.520 --> 40:49.640]  on the masks on our faces. But as we see this, you know, this is the psychological operation
[40:49.640 --> 40:57.000]  that they're doing. You have all the sports officials, all the big corporations everywhere.
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.920]  This is true fascism. These anti-fascists that are on the streets, they don't have a problem
[41:01.920 --> 41:06.400]  with the big corporations that are pushing their agenda. They have a problem with you.
[41:06.400 --> 41:09.720]  They have a problem with your history, your culture, your constitution. They don't have
[41:09.720 --> 41:14.040]  a problem with the corporations. And let me tell you, that's where the real fascism is.
[41:14.040 --> 41:20.840]  And you can see it right here in sports. And so as AP talks about this, and baseball gets
[41:20.840 --> 41:27.560]  his opening day, LA Dodgers and San Francisco Giants all kneeled as well, just like the
[41:27.560 --> 41:32.080]  Yankees and the Nationals. And AP went on to say, you know, watching from a distance,
[41:32.080 --> 41:35.920]  you might wonder why they were even trying. I do. I do wonder why they were doing it.
[41:35.920 --> 41:40.920]  So there was a feel as if it was artificial, like somebody had clicked on the Xbox accidentally
[41:40.920 --> 41:47.280]  and you weren't watching a live game. Yeah. How interesting can cardboard people be after
[41:47.280 --> 41:52.120]  a few games they ask? You see, we now have, because of the COVID-19, we now have robots
[41:52.120 --> 41:58.840]  doing the work and we have cardboard spectators. We don't need you. We don't need you. You
[41:58.840 --> 42:05.840]  know, we have social media. We have social distancing. We have social credits. Every
[42:05.840 --> 42:13.320]  one of them is antisocial. Everything that these people do is a lie. They pick a term
[42:13.320 --> 42:18.680]  like social, social lists and social that when it's antisocial, everything. It's like
[42:18.680 --> 42:26.920]  the speech rules for AP. And frankly, looking at this, where you got robots doing the work,
[42:26.920 --> 42:33.000]  you got cardboard fans. I mean, this is like something directly out of the twilight zone.
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.880]  I think it's more like the twilight zone than Xbox. And so Fox is going to now fill the
[42:36.880 --> 42:43.400]  empty baseball stadiums with virtual fans. Fans will not be allowed to sit in the ball
[42:43.400 --> 42:48.760]  parks. Viewers may not notice because Fox corporation owned outlet intends to fill the
[42:48.760 --> 42:53.160]  seats with hundreds of virtual attendees at all the ball parks, which will be broadcasting
[42:53.160 --> 42:57.080]  games for the next several weeks. Using digital technology, they will fill the seats with
[42:57.080 --> 43:04.160]  dozens of doppelganger. It's finally here. Introducing the new survival shield X2 spray

[43:57.960 --> 44:01.640]  There are a lot of signs that people are really waking up to the new world order in global
[44:01.640 --> 44:06.600]  government. But one of the biggest is privacy pouches. I've been selling these for more
[44:06.600 --> 44:11.920]  than 10 years. In the old days, they weren't 100% effective. Now they are. They're a little
[44:11.920 --> 44:16.960]  bitty, lightweight Faraday cages that small phones and even large cell phones fit into
[44:16.960 --> 44:21.000]  very, very comfortably and then slip right into your pocket. And these things work great
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.960]  that way. You're not tracked. You're not traced by government, by big corporations, by big
[44:24.960 --> 44:30.240]  tech, by hackers, by criminals. They're selling your data. They're using it against you. AI
[44:30.240 --> 44:33.920]  uses this to be able to predict the future of manipulate markets. It's critical that
[44:33.920 --> 44:38.120]  everyone stop going around with your cell phones being naked. Well, I got to tell you,
[44:38.120 --> 44:41.840]  normally we probably sold a couple hundred a month. We're selling upwards of a thousand
[44:41.840 --> 44:46.280]  of these a day. Plus we have a good unit and it's also a good price. We have it in four
[44:46.280 --> 44:50.960]  different colors. It's the privacy pockets that info or store.com. People are really
[44:50.960 --> 44:54.880]  waking up. I'm seeing it all over the news that folks are aware of this and are now

[45:56.880 --> 46:03.600]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at info or store.com. You
[46:03.600 --> 46:07.400]  can wear them out to political events. You can trigger live darts. One of the biggest
[46:07.400 --> 46:14.120]  reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween. But
[46:14.120 --> 46:18.480]  on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you
[46:18.480 --> 46:22.800]  from COVID-19 or anything else. It's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared
[46:22.800 --> 46:27.480]  for the force inoculations and contact tracing of their openly announcing it's an act of
[46:27.480 --> 46:32.440]  submission. It's an act of like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down. But a big
[46:32.440 --> 46:36.440]  reason to wear these is then into stores when people ask you why you're wearing a Halloween
[46:36.440 --> 46:42.720]  mask, say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing. And the M95
[46:42.720 --> 46:47.760]  mask only control what's coming in, not what's going out. So they quote spread COVID-19.
[46:47.760 --> 46:51.120]  They don't protect from it. So again, it's a great way to throw it back at these control
[46:51.120 --> 47:02.620]  freaks faces. You buy one for 9.95. You get four more free. They're at cost info or store.com.
[47:02.620 --> 47:30.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show Monday. We're talking about how Fox is going to they're
[47:30.440 --> 47:39.320]  not going to have cardboard fans after this opening where you saw that ridiculous aspect.
[47:39.320 --> 47:43.100]  And of course, they did that in Taiwan first. I talked about that and laughed about that
[47:43.100 --> 47:48.020]  a couple of months ago. I got an angry fan from Taiwan saying, we haven't shut down nearly
[47:48.020 --> 47:53.260]  as bad as you guys have. And it's like, yeah, they had a tricky cheese van that was actually
[47:53.260 --> 47:59.660]  animated. So I had cardboard fans and they put masks over the cardboard fans a couple
[47:59.660 --> 48:06.060]  of months ago when they started playing baseball again in Taiwan. And so now we're doing that.
[48:06.060 --> 48:11.340]  But they have a better way to do this because the Fox corporations are going to be broadcasting
[48:11.340 --> 48:19.540]  this. They're going to set up virtual attendees. So they're going to CGI audiences, full Hollywood
[48:19.540 --> 48:25.580]  using digital technology. Fox Sports will fill seats with dozens of digital doppelgangers.
[48:25.580 --> 48:29.700]  They'll make movements that emulate what a crowd might look like from afar. They can change
[48:29.700 --> 48:35.420]  the color of clothes reports variety. So that a particular stadium might appear to be filled
[48:35.420 --> 48:42.220]  with home team fans. Producers can have sections of the ersatz assemblage to do a wave. Isn't
[48:42.220 --> 48:49.700]  that great? Yeah, I guess they they're going to go full professional wrestling on this.
[48:49.700 --> 48:53.540]  I think what they ought to do is out of field to make it interesting. What they ought to
[48:53.540 --> 48:58.940]  do is out of fill the stadium with a Fauci orcs and trolls or better yet, better yet,
[48:58.940 --> 49:05.420]  for each one, each one of these teams to have a mascot, right? Well, let's say the Redskins
[49:05.420 --> 49:12.020]  only put Indians throughout all the different ones there or the Braves. No, the Braves going
[49:12.020 --> 49:15.580]  to change your names to cowards. I think that's what they're going to do. And so meanwhile,
[49:15.580 --> 49:21.140]  as we got Fauci going out the first pitch of the season and you know, Trump is told,
[49:21.140 --> 49:25.380]  don't worry, we'll let you do it at some point later on. And Trump is like, well, will there
[49:25.380 --> 49:30.020]  be a crowd? We'll see. We'll see. Talk to Fauci about it. See if he's going to let you
[49:30.020 --> 49:34.740]  do that. And what was Trump doing yesterday while Fauci was throwing out the first pitch
[49:34.740 --> 49:39.580]  of the season? Well, Trump was celebrating the return of baseball with little league players
[49:39.580 --> 49:45.540]  at the White House. That's right. He wasn't in the major leagues. Trump wasn't in the
[49:45.540 --> 49:50.700]  minor leagues. Trump was in the little leagues. And so he's out there throwing some balls
[49:50.700 --> 49:54.980]  with some little kids at the White House. That's what this has come to. And of course,
[49:54.980 --> 50:01.540]  they did not have any cardboard fans or CGI fans that were added there at the White House
[50:01.540 --> 50:09.620]  lawn. And later in the day, after he played throughout some pitches to some league players,
[50:09.620 --> 50:13.780]  President Trump said that he's going to cancel the Jacksonville component of the Republican
[50:13.780 --> 50:19.940]  National Convention after being kicked out of North Carolina by the Democrat governor.
[50:19.940 --> 50:25.180]  He goes to Florida. They're going to have the convention there. And now he's decided
[50:25.180 --> 50:30.540]  that he's not going to do that. He said, I looked at my team. Was that the little league
[50:30.540 --> 50:36.980]  team? The minor league team that we call the Republicans? I looked at my team and I said,
[50:36.980 --> 50:41.780]  the timing for this event is not right. They said, sir, we can make it work very easily.
[50:41.780 --> 50:47.500]  I said, there's nothing more important than our country than keeping our people safe.
[50:47.500 --> 50:53.940]  Liberty is the thing, right? Not liberty. Not the Constitution. Don't ever take any risk
[50:53.940 --> 51:00.420]  about anything. I mean, you know, you could die going to work in a car, let alone with
[51:00.420 --> 51:06.620]  coronavirus. So just stay at home. That's no risk at all. Just stay home. Because you
[51:06.620 --> 51:11.380]  know, if you go to the beach, you could die from coronavirus. If you've gotten the water,
[51:11.380 --> 51:16.980]  you could get a shark could get you. Anything could happen. And we don't understand what
[51:16.980 --> 51:23.700]  risk is anymore. And we are not willing to take a risk. We will sacrifice all of our
[51:23.700 --> 51:31.700]  freedoms, all of our liberty for the promise of safety. This is America in the 21st century
[51:31.700 --> 51:39.940]  began with 9 11. And by the way, folks, all these model state emergency powers that everybody
[51:39.940 --> 51:44.980]  has that was written a couple of months before they pulled off 9 11. And they pushed that
[51:44.980 --> 51:48.780]  out to all the different state governments after 9 11. They said, you know, we could
[51:48.780 --> 51:54.340]  have a bio weapon tear that could be like, you know, anthrax or something. So you should
[51:54.340 --> 51:59.140]  give your public health officials complete control over your economy to shut everything
[51:59.140 --> 52:09.620]  down whenever we say so. And they did. And so this is another 9 11 if people would believe
[52:09.620 --> 52:17.380]  that three steel skyscrapers would collapse in their footprints. A couple of hours after
[52:17.380 --> 52:23.220]  two of the three skyscrapers were hit by planes. The third one wasn't even hit. If the American
[52:23.220 --> 52:28.860]  public will believe that and will continue to believe that for 20 years, of course, they'll
[52:28.860 --> 52:36.180]  believe a virus. Are you kidding me? This is where we are. We will accept any lie if
[52:36.180 --> 52:41.740]  we believe that somehow we're going to be safe afterwards. And so this will this is where
[52:41.740 --> 52:45.420]  we are with President Trump. He said, yeah, so they told me, sir, we can make this work
[52:45.420 --> 52:49.660]  very easily. I said, there's nothing more important than keeping our people safe, whether it's
[52:49.660 --> 52:56.700]  from the China virus or the radical left mob. So that's right. His he thinks his path to
[52:56.700 --> 53:06.140]  victory now that he can look strong by starting a war with China and by further nationalizing
[53:06.140 --> 53:12.300]  the police force to go after the radical left mob. We'll talk more about that. That is a
[53:12.300 --> 53:19.220]  very look. We want to have law and order. But as I said yesterday, a few decades ago,
[53:19.220 --> 53:25.940]  I remember when everybody it was just a meme, even though we didn't have memes at the time,
[53:25.940 --> 53:30.620]  but everybody talked about New York City and the murder rate in New York City. And it went
[53:30.620 --> 53:33.820]  that way for quite a while until people in New York City got tired of it. And then they
[53:33.820 --> 53:38.900]  decided that they would get serious about law enforcement. And Rudy Giuliani was a part
[53:38.900 --> 53:45.140]  of that. Maybe Rudy could explain this to Trump that you just let cities like that gradually
[53:45.140 --> 53:50.500]  learn they can also be an example to the rest of the country why we don't want Democrat
[53:50.500 --> 53:56.700]  progs running your city. But let it be an example to people don't burn down the Constitution
[53:56.700 --> 54:03.140]  to try to save Portland from itself. And that's really what's going on. The few people that
[54:03.140 --> 54:07.980]  are there that are sane need to move out. We don't need to destroy our Constitution for
[54:07.980 --> 54:13.180]  that. We'll talk more about that coming up. But anyway, so they're going to have about
[54:13.180 --> 54:23.580]  a four hour political convention in Charlotte, but they're not going to have people show
[54:23.580 --> 54:29.340]  up. There will be no crowds in Florida. And there will be no press coverage because President
[54:29.340 --> 54:34.300]  Trump said, I could see the media saying, Oh, this is very unsafe. That's the last thing
[54:34.300 --> 54:38.620]  you want to have is the media criticizing you, isn't it? President Trump, especially
[54:38.620 --> 54:43.140]  over safety, because nobody's going to criticize you in the media for taking away people's
[54:43.140 --> 54:53.180]  freedom or their livelihoods or risking their lives. So the problem is appeasers are always
[54:53.180 --> 54:57.460]  losers. It doesn't matter if it's Neville Chamberlain. It doesn't matter if it's Jimmy
[54:57.460 --> 55:04.020]  River. You know, I kind of thought as we started looking at the beginning of the Trump presidency,
[55:04.020 --> 55:09.780]  the weakness on the border, the weakness in terms of stopping the foreign wars, it could
[55:09.780 --> 55:13.900]  very easily have solved two problems with one stroke. You could have brought back our
[55:13.900 --> 55:20.260]  soldiers from foreign wars and put them at the border. Oh, but we can't do that. So the
[55:20.260 --> 55:26.420]  media, you know, that that we really can't bring any troops home. The same people are
[55:26.420 --> 55:33.060]  now trying to generate an attack on President Trump saying, you know, there's there's Russians
[55:33.060 --> 55:36.900]  and Taliban who are trying to kill American troops in Afghanistan. Yes, been happening
[55:36.900 --> 55:41.900]  that way for 20 years. And if you really cared about the soldiers, you'd be bringing them
[55:41.900 --> 55:47.140]  out of Afghanistan, and you would be using them to protect our borders instead of other
[55:47.140 --> 55:52.020]  countries borders. But they didn't do any of that. And at the time, I thought he's going
[55:52.020 --> 55:57.980]  to go the same way that George HW Bush did. Read my lips, no new taxes. Nobody really
[55:57.980 --> 56:04.020]  weren't really too sure about George HW Bush because he had called tax cuts, voodoo economics
[56:04.020 --> 56:09.220]  when he lost to Reagan. And so people were concerned that he was going to increase taxes.
[56:09.220 --> 56:13.420]  He told everybody, read my lips, no new taxes. And then he did it. He gave us at that time
[56:13.420 --> 56:18.100]  the biggest tax increase we'd ever had. He was a one term president. Then we had another
[56:18.100 --> 56:26.980]  one term president who is also a famous failure, Jimmy Carter, who could do absolutely nothing
[56:26.980 --> 56:31.860]  to rescue the hostages in Iran from the American embassy. And now we have another president
[56:31.860 --> 56:39.140]  who is looking increasingly like a one term president who is absolutely helpless to help
[56:39.140 --> 56:46.980]  all of America being held hostage by a health bureaucracy that is out of control. He himself
[56:46.980 --> 56:51.980]  has now become a salesperson for this. He says it's a different world. As he's talking
[56:51.980 --> 56:55.660]  about the shutdown of the convention, it is a different world said Trump and it will be
[56:55.660 --> 57:04.220]  for a while. Surrender monkey. Surrender monkey. Run for president of France, Trump. That's
[57:04.220 --> 57:09.220]  where you belong, quite frankly. All right, folks, before we go to a break, take a look
[57:09.220 --> 57:15.780]  at the products that we have at infowarstore.com because where all this began was the shutdown
[57:15.780 --> 57:21.900]  of free speech and the free press. Your free speech and the free and independent press.
[57:21.900 --> 57:24.980]  That was done with censorship. We were the first people they took down. They're stepping
[57:24.980 --> 57:27.780]  it up again now because we're coming into the election. We'll talk more about that
[57:27.780 --> 57:32.620]  when we come back. The censorship and how people are self censoring now. But if you
[57:32.620 --> 57:35.700]  don't want a self censor and if you don't want the free press censored, take a look
[57:35.700 --> 57:39.580]  at the products we have at infowarstore.com. We've extended our Christmas in July sale
[57:39.580 --> 57:46.180]  to the end of July, 50 to 60% off free shipping, double patriot points, new products like the
[57:46.180 --> 57:54.380]  privacy pocket. CNN, USA Today and other mainstream media fake news outlets came out and said
[57:54.380 --> 58:00.700]  that a new Trump campaign t-shirt that has an American eagle spreading its wings standing
[58:00.700 --> 58:07.140]  on top of an American flag is Nazi and they had the Soros funded snopes groups and others
[58:07.140 --> 58:12.100]  in fact check it and say yes, now the American flag and yes, the American eagle are Nazis.
[58:12.100 --> 58:16.460]  No, George Soros and funds the snopes and media matters and the rest of them, he's
[58:16.460 --> 58:21.820]  the real Nazi collaborator. But this shirt I think is really the perfect campaign shirts.
[58:21.820 --> 58:25.340]  We made one even better than what Trump's people came up with. Two different versions
[58:25.340 --> 58:30.740]  of it wins something even worse. The Betsy Ross flag, our first flag that they also say
[58:30.740 --> 58:36.620]  is racist even though she was a famous abolitionist. So these shirts are at infowars.com. They're
[58:36.620 --> 58:41.900]  the American eagle Betsy Ross flags, two different designs, guaranteed to spread the word and
[58:41.900 --> 58:49.220]  of course trigger lip tarts everywhere. Exercise your first amendment or lose it at infowars.com.
[58:49.220 --> 58:54.900]  Americans have had freedom for so long and most Americans were born into such docile
[58:54.900 --> 58:59.620]  times compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny. We
[58:59.620 --> 59:04.940]  don't appreciate the American way truth, justice, due process, the right to self defense,
[59:04.940 --> 59:08.260]  private property because we've had it so long and we just think that's how the rest of the
[59:08.260 --> 59:09.260]  world is.
[59:09.260 --> 59:13.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try
[59:13.940 --> 59:18.260]  to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as
[59:18.260 --> 59:23.420]  well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world. That's
[59:23.420 --> 59:28.220]  now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad
[59:28.220 --> 59:33.580]  for the earth and we need to be cold and dumb down and put into subgroups that the elites
[59:33.580 --> 59:39.020]  dominate, manipulate and command even lucky enough to stay alive. And that's what COVID-19
[59:39.020 --> 59:45.580]  is, a global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity and
[59:45.580 --> 59:52.060]  against your future. If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[59:52.060 --> 1:00:14.540]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:14.540 --> 1:00:19.860]  Welcome back. You know, Planned Parenthood has finally admitted that Margaret Singer was
[1:00:19.860 --> 1:00:28.620]  a bigot, a eugenicist, a racist. I guess the question is, will Twitter, Facebook, Google
[1:00:28.620 --> 1:00:35.820]  ever admit it? They have decided that they will remove her name from their Manhattan
[1:00:35.820 --> 1:00:43.220]  clinic. Ending decades of denial about her racist views, writes the New York Post. They
[1:00:43.220 --> 1:00:48.980]  point out four years ago Planned Parenthood did admit that it was wrong of her to speak
[1:00:48.980 --> 1:00:57.220]  at the Ku Klux Klan in 1926 and that she supported the sterilization of the disabled
[1:00:57.220 --> 1:01:03.020]  and also of, quote, placing so-called illiterates, poppers, unemployables, criminals, prostitutes
[1:01:03.020 --> 1:01:09.700]  and dope fiends on farms and in open spaces as long as necessary for the strengthening
[1:01:09.700 --> 1:01:16.980]  and development of moral conduct. Oh, there we go. So she was part of this movement that
[1:01:16.980 --> 1:01:23.380]  happened in the early part of the 20th century, about 100 years ago. You had the eugenicists,
[1:01:23.380 --> 1:01:30.460]  you had the technocracy, you had people like Elon Musk's grandfather, Paul DeMond, who
[1:01:30.460 --> 1:01:35.300]  actually was kicked out of Canada because he tried to overthrow the democratic government
[1:01:35.300 --> 1:01:43.860]  there in Canada with a technocracy. This was all the rage. I mean, you had books and movies
[1:01:43.860 --> 1:01:52.380]  written by people like H.G. Wells, Aldous Huxley, all these same people who were pushing transhumanism,
[1:01:52.380 --> 1:01:57.220]  the technocracy and so forth. They were pushing the idea of, you know, the book and the movie
[1:01:57.220 --> 1:02:00.620]  thanks to come, shape of things to come. You've probably seen the movie if you haven't read
[1:02:00.620 --> 1:02:06.860]  the book. But in that movie, you had the, in the book, you had the technocratic elite,
[1:02:06.860 --> 1:02:11.060]  the airmen who were going to impose peace for everybody. They were just going to take
[1:02:11.060 --> 1:02:15.860]  everybody's freedom in the process. We'll all be safe, right? And so it was born out
[1:02:15.860 --> 1:02:21.860]  of that, all of this is tied together. All of this was very well consolidated and planned
[1:02:21.860 --> 1:02:29.060]  out 100 years ago. And so as we look at Margaret Sanger, part of that movement, because the
[1:02:29.060 --> 1:02:36.340]  technocratic elite are also eugenicists, she said the most urgent problem today is how
[1:02:36.340 --> 1:02:42.980]  to limit and discourage the overfertility of the mentally and physically defective. But
[1:02:42.980 --> 1:02:49.860]  she also focused specifically on black people. And she was very clear about that. We've talked
[1:02:49.860 --> 1:02:56.860]  about how Planned Parenthood supports black genocide. Many Christian leaders, black and
[1:02:56.860 --> 1:03:00.580]  otherwise have talked about, well, if you really want to support Black Lives Matter,
[1:03:00.580 --> 1:03:05.540]  you'll get serious and start talking about Planned Parenthood. Of course they haven't.
[1:03:05.540 --> 1:03:13.020]  Buck versus Bale, a 1927 Supreme Court decision. Actually, I said Bale for what he has slipped.
[1:03:13.020 --> 1:03:17.900]  Bale was where they sacrificed their kids. It was Buck versus Bale, B-E-L-L. But it
[1:03:17.900 --> 1:03:27.220]  might as well be Bale. Supreme Court said in 1927 that it was constitutional to have
[1:03:27.220 --> 1:03:35.660]  forced sterilization of the quote unquote unfit. And that allowed the involuntary hysterectomy
[1:03:35.660 --> 1:03:41.620]  of thousands of black women in the Jim Crow South. Planned Parenthood put clinics in predominantly
[1:03:41.620 --> 1:03:47.260]  black areas. And I reported on the show in the morning, the David Knight show before
[1:03:47.260 --> 1:03:55.100]  this show, I had the statistics comparing how many times more likely it is to be killed
[1:03:55.100 --> 1:04:01.740]  by Planned Parenthood than by the police, especially when you compare white versus black. It is
[1:04:01.740 --> 1:04:06.700]  highly focused on that. But of course they don't pay any attention to that. When we look
[1:04:06.700 --> 1:04:12.460]  at the censorship that has been going on it in three years, we would get attacked for
[1:04:12.460 --> 1:04:18.220]  saying it was about eugenics. We're pointing out it was the quotes from Margaret Singer
[1:04:18.220 --> 1:04:23.900]  and now they're admitting it and taking her name off. And now this, we have in Arizona,
[1:04:23.900 --> 1:04:30.700]  we have the CPS workers there. Some of them are fired because they were wearing bright
[1:04:30.700 --> 1:04:36.100]  pink shirts that said professional kidnappers on the front. And on the back it said, do
[1:04:36.100 --> 1:04:42.620]  you know where your children are? In your face. That's another thing that is ignored
[1:04:42.620 --> 1:04:57.020]  by the social eugenicists that run social media. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:04:57.020 --> 1:05:01.940]  The people are awakening. They're taking control of their own environment. Cell phones are
[1:05:01.940 --> 1:05:07.740]  an amazing tool. Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld. But big tech, large corporations,
[1:05:07.740 --> 1:05:12.660]  hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHICOMS especially, are using this to
[1:05:12.660 --> 1:05:17.740]  steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop
[1:05:17.740 --> 1:05:22.580]  up billions of people's data that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in
[1:05:22.580 --> 1:05:30.660]  mass movements. Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[1:05:30.660 --> 1:05:34.980]  In their own words, they admit it. So I've been selling privacy pouches and locket pockets
[1:05:34.980 --> 1:05:38.980]  and things like that for more than a decade. And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[1:05:38.980 --> 1:05:43.260]  They're faraday cages. They just look like a cloth envelope. They work absolutely great.
[1:05:43.260 --> 1:05:48.780]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[1:05:48.780 --> 1:05:51.780]  when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because
[1:05:51.780 --> 1:06:17.780]  it's just other business. Get yours at m4store.com today.
[1:06:17.780 --> 1:06:26.660]  We're playing the AOC theme song here. Don't know much about history. We don't know what's
[1:06:26.660 --> 1:06:31.100]  going on here. Don't know much about science. Now that stuff, yeah. Green New Deal. But
[1:06:31.100 --> 1:06:37.100]  they do know how to get what they want. It's absolutely amazing what they've been able
[1:06:37.100 --> 1:06:45.220]  to achieve. You know, when you look at the Green New Deal and the UN 2030 Agenda for
[1:06:45.220 --> 1:06:52.340]  Sustainability that, you know, we have to sacrifice our independence, mobility, our
[1:06:52.340 --> 1:06:56.100]  freedom, our way of life. Everything has to be sacrificed. We need to be in very, very
[1:06:56.100 --> 1:07:02.860]  small apartments where we have our travel limited. We need to be confined in those,
[1:07:02.860 --> 1:07:06.980]  confined in the big cities. Don't worry. They'll give you universal basic income, but you won't
[1:07:06.980 --> 1:07:12.020]  have a job. You won't have meat either. All these different things that were put together
[1:07:12.020 --> 1:07:19.700]  over a period of decades. And the MacGuffin for all of this was climate change, unicorn
[1:07:19.700 --> 1:07:25.780]  farts, if you will. But it was a MacGuffin. You remember the tactic that Hitchcock used?
[1:07:25.780 --> 1:07:29.660]  You know, there was this thing. It didn't matter really what it was, the Maltese Falcon
[1:07:29.660 --> 1:07:34.660]  or whatever. Who knows what the Maltese Falcon was, but everybody was after it, right? And
[1:07:34.660 --> 1:07:40.340]  we don't really have to define what climate change is. We just know that it's a bad thing.
[1:07:40.340 --> 1:07:44.460]  And somehow we've got to shut it down. But while they have that MacGuffin of climate
[1:07:44.460 --> 1:07:51.820]  change, they're able to set up all the policies and the rules and all the different dictates
[1:07:51.820 --> 1:07:57.580]  and mandates that are going to be used to save us from the MacGuffin, the MacGuffin of
[1:07:57.580 --> 1:08:01.620]  climate change. And then they remove that MacGuffin and they put in a new MacGuffin,
[1:08:01.620 --> 1:08:08.820]  the COVID virus. And now when we look at masks, the same thing is happening. Because
[1:08:08.820 --> 1:08:15.460]  right now, all of the regulations for mandatory vaccines, which, you know, this has been accumulating
[1:08:15.460 --> 1:08:23.020]  for a while. We've had a lot of hand-wringing and alarmism about measles. And everybody
[1:08:23.020 --> 1:08:26.380]  would look at it and say, measles, what are you talking about? Climate change, what are
[1:08:26.380 --> 1:08:30.860]  you talking about? And yet you had a lot of Democrat jurisdictions where they put in
[1:08:30.860 --> 1:08:36.260]  mandatory vaccines. You're not going to go to school if you don't get your vaccines
[1:08:36.260 --> 1:08:40.460]  and you had President Trump say, they're going to have to get the shot a year ago. They're
[1:08:40.460 --> 1:08:45.020]  going to have to get that measles shot. And so as they were pushing this along and they
[1:08:45.020 --> 1:08:51.260]  were nudging everybody to get flu shots, they couldn't quite pull it off. But they were
[1:08:51.260 --> 1:08:57.420]  putting this stuff together. And now with the masks, that is the MacGuffin around which
[1:08:57.420 --> 1:09:04.300]  they can coalesce all the different rules and regulations. And the psychology of it
[1:09:04.300 --> 1:09:09.300]  as well, because we were always told with the MMR vaccine, you're not protected if you
[1:09:09.300 --> 1:09:15.340]  get vaccinated. You're only protected if everybody else gets vaccinated. The herd mentality,
[1:09:15.340 --> 1:09:19.660]  they call it herd immunity, but it's a herd mentality. Your vaccination doesn't protect
[1:09:19.660 --> 1:09:28.300]  you. So everybody must get vaccinated. And now the same thing is being said about masks.
[1:09:28.300 --> 1:09:33.820]  COVID is the MacGuffin and the masks, actually the masks are the MacGuffin for the mandatory
[1:09:33.820 --> 1:09:40.340]  vaccines. That's what's coming. This is a preparation. They are psychologically preparing
[1:09:40.340 --> 1:09:47.780]  you for mandatory vaccines. And they're also testing your reaction to various rules and
[1:09:47.780 --> 1:09:57.420]  regulations and even laws and police forces out there. You've had some of the maskers
[1:09:57.420 --> 1:10:02.780]  who are really the same people are going to be pushing mandatory vaccines saying, when
[1:10:02.780 --> 1:10:10.260]  it comes to vaccines, we don't want to make this mandatory. Because if we make it a law,
[1:10:10.260 --> 1:10:15.260]  it's going to invite a challenge, a due process challenge, people challenge us in court, they
[1:10:15.260 --> 1:10:20.580]  might win. And we don't want to say that it's a law. Instead, we want to take a more subtle
[1:10:20.580 --> 1:10:24.780]  approach. We'll put out rules from the bureaucracy. And of course, this is something that they
[1:10:24.780 --> 1:10:32.380]  have perfected over decades. First, it was the IRS, you know, they would make the rules.
[1:10:32.380 --> 1:10:36.500]  This creates the IRS and say, you determine what the rules are. And then we will let you
[1:10:36.500 --> 1:10:42.340]  have courts and things like that to decide who has violated it. And people are not going
[1:10:42.340 --> 1:10:47.060]  to get due process and no presumption of innocence. And we can say that that doesn't happen because
[1:10:47.060 --> 1:10:52.540]  this is a rule. It's not a law. This is a rule coming from the IRS. And so you have no presumption
[1:10:52.540 --> 1:10:57.300]  of innocence, no protection from excessive fines, no due process. Then they started doing
[1:10:57.300 --> 1:11:02.420]  that with war on drugs. And they came up with a brilliant thing called civil asset forfeiture.
[1:11:02.420 --> 1:11:08.060]  Oh, it's civil. It's not criminal, because these are rules, not laws. And we can charge
[1:11:08.060 --> 1:11:13.900]  your property, but not you. I'm not even charging you with a crime, let alone finding you guilty,
[1:11:13.900 --> 1:11:18.700]  but I'll take your house, your home. I'll take your business. I'll take your cash. Anything
[1:11:18.700 --> 1:11:23.340]  I wish I'll charge that inanimate object with committing a crime, but not you. And it'll
[1:11:23.340 --> 1:11:26.140]  be civil, not criminal. So if you want to get it back, you're going to have to sue me
[1:11:26.140 --> 1:11:31.980]  in court. How about that? I'll take your business and then you've got to find the money to sue
[1:11:31.980 --> 1:11:39.460]  me in court to get it back. So the people who are pushing the mandatory vaccine says,
[1:11:39.460 --> 1:11:45.660]  let's use that approach. And then we'll also use the approach of the fascist corporations.
[1:11:45.660 --> 1:11:50.540]  You'll have the corporations say, you're not going to come into my store to buy groceries.
[1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:55.900]  You're not going to go to a restaurant. You're not going to work for me. You're not going
[1:11:55.900 --> 1:12:02.340]  to travel in my, since you don't have cars and I own all the cars and I rent it to you
[1:12:02.340 --> 1:12:07.180]  by the ride. You're not going to be able to travel either, get into my car unless you've
[1:12:07.180 --> 1:12:14.140]  got the immunity passport. You get your, get your mask and then eventually get your vaccine
[1:12:14.140 --> 1:12:16.980]  and you'll be able to go to school. You'll be able to work. You'll be able to travel.
[1:12:16.980 --> 1:12:19.420]  But if you don't have it, you're not going to be able to do it. And we'll have the corporations
[1:12:19.420 --> 1:12:23.860]  do that and they won't be able to do anything because they don't have any due process ability
[1:12:23.860 --> 1:12:28.660]  and what are they going to do? They're going to sue these corporations. The biggest accumulation
[1:12:28.660 --> 1:12:32.020]  of wealth we've ever seen in human history. They're going to sue these people in court.
[1:12:32.020 --> 1:12:36.420]  These people can bankrupt them without ever even going to trial. Just continuous after
[1:12:36.420 --> 1:12:43.780]  continuous armies of lawyers. This is the strategy behind all this. And before we got
[1:12:43.780 --> 1:12:47.980]  to the masks for all, and I'm going to tell you who's behind that there. There's a movement.
[1:12:47.980 --> 1:12:52.820]  It's not just a hashtag. There's a movement there. Tell you who's behind masks for all.
[1:12:52.820 --> 1:12:59.540]  But before there were masks, there were gag orders. Gag orders on social media. Gag orders
[1:12:59.540 --> 1:13:04.860]  on your free speech and on the free press. Free speech is you talking about things. You
[1:13:04.860 --> 1:13:10.380]  talking about things in the digital public square, as Jack Dorsey said. We're the free
[1:13:10.380 --> 1:13:14.740]  speech wing of the free speech party. Our business model is the public square, but you
[1:13:14.740 --> 1:13:18.460]  can't speak here. And we've already had Supreme Court decisions about that, but don't pay
[1:13:18.460 --> 1:13:22.500]  any attention to those because these people will do whatever they wish. So as we look
[1:13:22.500 --> 1:13:30.180]  at this, it's really had an effect. Pure research says nearly 75% of Americans say social media
[1:13:30.180 --> 1:13:37.060]  companies wield too much power and influence over politics. Only 22% of Americans believe
[1:13:37.060 --> 1:13:42.860]  the Silicon Valley technocracy has just the right amount of political power. Nearly 90%
[1:13:42.860 --> 1:13:49.820]  of Republicans, conservatives, think that the technocrats have too much power over speech.
[1:13:49.820 --> 1:13:59.180]  Liberal Democrats even thought that it was 68% of the moderates and 60% of the more radical
[1:13:59.180 --> 1:14:04.620]  Democrats thought that the technocrats had too much control. But when you look at the
[1:14:04.620 --> 1:14:10.380]  effect that it's had in terms of self-censorship, there's another poll from Cato Institute,
[1:14:10.380 --> 1:14:18.020]  National Survey of 2000 Americans. They said 62% of people across the political spectrum,
[1:14:18.020 --> 1:14:23.860]  62% said the political climate prevents them from sharing their political views. Now, how
[1:14:23.860 --> 1:14:31.660]  does this range? It ranges from about 50, only 50% of Democrats think are intimidated about
[1:14:31.660 --> 1:14:38.460]  talking about politics. 60% of independents and 80% of Republicans because that's the
[1:14:38.460 --> 1:14:43.620]  way this is skewed. I think one of the saddest things to come out of this poll is the fact
[1:14:43.620 --> 1:14:49.860]  that 50% of strong liberals support firing somebody if they find out they are a Trump
[1:14:49.860 --> 1:15:01.060]  donor. And even sadder and even more surprising to me is that 36% of strong conservatives
[1:15:01.060 --> 1:15:05.780]  support firing somebody if they find out they're a Biden donor. Do we have anybody that really
[1:15:05.780 --> 1:15:12.380]  supports the principle of free speech? The idea that I may vehemently disagree with you
[1:15:12.380 --> 1:15:17.860]  but I will defend to the death your right to say it? That is really the essence of it.
[1:15:17.860 --> 1:15:22.380]  I mean the Constitution and First Amendment is just a piece of paper. If you really want
[1:15:22.380 --> 1:15:28.220]  to punish people and now this is being adopted by conservatives because they are being pulled
[1:15:28.220 --> 1:15:34.100]  into this cancel culture except on the other side. I think that is perhaps the saddest
[1:15:34.100 --> 1:15:37.500]  aspect of this. Alright, we've got to take a break and we'll be right back. Stay with
[1:15:37.500 --> 1:15:56.500]  us.
[1:15:56.500 --> 1:16:01.740]  Attention radio listeners, have you ever wanted to be independent of the utility companies
[1:16:01.740 --> 1:16:07.060]  and actually generate your own supply of off-grid electrical power? If so, this is going to
[1:16:07.060 --> 1:16:12.260]  be the most important message you'll ever hear. Here's why. A limited number of solar
[1:16:12.260 --> 1:16:17.460]  powered backup generators are back in stock and now available. These emergency backup
[1:16:17.460 --> 1:16:23.460]  systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most. And unlike gas generators,

[1:16:30.220 --> 1:16:35.420]  from the sun. It's like having an electric power plant running silently, secretly in
[1:16:35.420 --> 1:16:41.380]  your own home. Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, even keep food from spoiling.

[1:17:58.060 --> 1:18:03.340]  Imagine telling someone just a year ago that in the middle of 2020 the Democrats as well
[1:18:03.340 --> 1:18:09.060]  as many Republican leaders would be calling for the United Nations WHO edict that all
[1:18:09.060 --> 1:18:17.460]  Americans wear masks be a, quote, federal order and mandate. Totally unconstitutional
[1:18:17.460 --> 1:18:23.580]  annihilating states rights. Think about that. A woman can kill her baby. You pay for illegal
[1:18:23.580 --> 1:18:30.020]  aliens' health care. But you've got to wear a mask for a virus that killed 20 plus times
[1:18:30.020 --> 1:18:35.580]  less than what they said even if you believe the official story. This is about the WHO,
[1:18:35.580 --> 1:18:41.220]  the globalist testing their power through the media over the federal government to set
[1:18:41.220 --> 1:18:46.540]  policy in the United States. This is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the
[1:18:46.540 --> 1:18:51.020]  Paris Accord and all of it. And by the way, they admit that. They say now your carbon's
[1:18:51.020 --> 1:18:57.060]  down one way or another, you stupid Americans.
[1:18:57.060 --> 1:19:02.060]  It's Christmas in July. We ran the sale last year. It was very, very popular. And so I
[1:19:02.060 --> 1:19:06.860]  am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election
[1:19:06.860 --> 1:19:12.300]  year. And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt
[1:19:12.300 --> 1:19:17.540]  of 2020. It's the American Eagle boldly spreading its wings sitting at the top of Betsy Ross
[1:19:17.540 --> 1:19:23.580]  flying. And the shirts are on sale right now in FullerStore.com. I got the idea of the
[1:19:23.580 --> 1:19:28.860]  Trump campaign having a similar shirt media called Nazi, which of course it isn't. And
[1:19:28.860 --> 1:19:31.580]  since it's so triggering to the leftist and globalist, well, we're going to make sure
[1:19:31.580 --> 1:19:36.220]  there's even more of these on the streets to spread the word and exercise our First
[1:19:36.220 --> 1:19:40.520]  Amendment in the face of these times. We also have store live free shipping, double
[1:19:40.520 --> 1:19:45.260]  patriotic points. So whatever great item it is that you want, store live free shipping,
[1:19:45.260 --> 1:19:50.260]  double patriotic points on your next order and at least 50% off across the board. Now
[1:19:50.260 --> 1:19:53.060]  I'm going to have to get this sale very, very soon because all these products are about
[1:19:53.060 --> 1:19:59.980]  to sell out. Take advantage of it right now at FullerStore.com.
[1:19:59.980 --> 1:20:13.460]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:13.460 --> 1:20:23.460]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show. And now your host, David
[1:20:23.460 --> 1:20:34.580]  Jones. As we descend into totalitarianism, how does that differ from authoritarianism?
[1:20:34.580 --> 1:20:39.300]  Well, authoritarianism is where they tell you what to do without any justification, without
[1:20:39.300 --> 1:20:46.140]  any control. And they act as absolute dictators. You know, a dictator, somebody who dictates
[1:20:46.140 --> 1:20:51.820]  the law is in their mouth. It's not on a piece of paper. You know, that's one of the key
[1:20:51.820 --> 1:20:56.820]  things here in America. We have a constitution and these people at every, whether they are
[1:20:56.820 --> 1:21:02.820]  unelected bureaucrats and they swear an oath to the Constitution, especially our politicians.
[1:21:02.820 --> 1:21:06.660]  And then they go ahead and break that oath regularly, but they swear an oath to the Constitution.
[1:21:06.660 --> 1:21:12.620]  Why? Because the Constitution is the king. They are merely temporary stewards. They are
[1:21:12.620 --> 1:21:18.260]  not the authority. And that's the issue. We're going to be talking to Al Waddell later in
[1:21:18.260 --> 1:21:21.780]  the program. I've talked to him about this before. It's one thing we all need to talk
[1:21:21.780 --> 1:21:29.260]  about. A lot of Christians who should be pushing back on this are saying, well, we've got to
[1:21:29.260 --> 1:21:34.100]  obey the government, whatever they say. No, you've got to obey the authorities, right?
[1:21:34.100 --> 1:21:42.700]  The authorities. And the authority is a constitution. And if these people are acting evil, there
[1:21:42.700 --> 1:21:47.540]  are evil authorities out there as well. And you are not called to obey them. You are called
[1:21:47.540 --> 1:21:59.820]  to oppose them. But when we look at Cuomo, it comes to mind when I think about evil dictators.
[1:21:59.820 --> 1:22:05.300]  What is a meal? Ask the Gateway Pundit. See, this is where we are at this point in time.
[1:22:05.300 --> 1:22:13.900]  We now have these tyrants in California, New York, defining what is and is not a meal for
[1:22:13.900 --> 1:22:20.660]  you. New rules for bars and restaurants in California and New York are unbelievable.
[1:22:20.660 --> 1:22:26.900]  California says chicken wings, cheese sticks, fried calamari, and french fries are not considered
[1:22:26.900 --> 1:22:31.380]  to be meals. As it cracks down in outdoor restaurants that are offering drinks without
[1:22:31.380 --> 1:22:38.820]  food. And so here's what some of the guidelines say for California. It's often easier to describe
[1:22:38.820 --> 1:22:47.340]  what does not constitute a bona fide meal. Yeah, this is kind of like the Supreme Court
[1:22:47.340 --> 1:22:51.700]  judge who says, I can't define pornography, but I know it when I see it. These people
[1:22:51.700 --> 1:22:57.780]  are saying, well, I can't define what a meal is, but I know it when I see it, or I don't
[1:22:57.780 --> 1:23:03.380]  see it. In other words, it's completely arbitrary, and I'm going to act as a dictator. That's
[1:23:03.380 --> 1:23:08.100]  what the Supreme Court was doing. That's what these people are doing. And so they say, well,
[1:23:08.100 --> 1:23:14.020]  in that regard, the statute excludes mere offerings of sandwiches and salads. Oh, really?
[1:23:14.020 --> 1:23:19.860]  Just like that. A sandwich and a salad is not a meal, says California. Why? Because
[1:23:19.860 --> 1:23:27.020]  of COVID now. They have the authority to define every activity that you eat, even defining
[1:23:27.020 --> 1:23:31.620]  what is and is not a meal. The department does not recognize many sandwiches and salads
[1:23:31.620 --> 1:23:38.060]  are substantial. Therefore, they do not constitute legitimate meals. It's illegitimate because
[1:23:38.060 --> 1:23:43.620]  they say so. Your business is not essential because they say so. This food is not essential
[1:23:43.620 --> 1:23:49.900]  because they say so. So they say things that do not meet the meal requirement. Snacks such
[1:23:49.900 --> 1:23:54.820]  as pretzels, nuts, popcorn, pickles, and chips. Food ordinarily served as appetizers
[1:23:54.820 --> 1:23:59.540]  or first courses such as cheese sticks, fried calamari, that type of thing. Pizza bites
[1:23:59.540 --> 1:24:06.340]  as opposed to pizza itself. This is the size of the pizza. It's all in how you slice the
[1:24:06.340 --> 1:24:13.180]  pie, right? Side dishes such as bread, rolls, french fries, onion rings, small salads,
[1:24:13.180 --> 1:24:21.780]  rice, mashed potatoes, reheated, refrigerated, or frozen entrees. Desserts. Do you see how
[1:24:21.780 --> 1:24:29.500]  absurd this is? How arbitrary this is? How totalitarian this is? Again, arbitrary authoritarian
[1:24:29.500 --> 1:24:35.380] ism in every aspect of your life. Well, a dessert or if it is something that was refrigerated
[1:24:35.380 --> 1:24:41.860]  or if it's frozen, that's not a meal if you eat it. It's not a meal. It says California.
[1:24:41.860 --> 1:24:46.380]  And so, you know, when you can't, you know, french fries and things like that, that's
[1:24:46.380 --> 1:24:53.300]  not a meal. You can get in line and sit for a half hour at McDonald's or Burger King
[1:24:53.300 --> 1:24:59.460]  or some other national chain fast food restaurant, but they don't want you going to local restaurant.
[1:24:59.460 --> 1:25:04.220]  Restaurants because all local businesses have to be put out. This is why they're focusing
[1:25:04.220 --> 1:25:09.500]  on this folks and the people that they focus on the most because the most successful local
[1:25:09.500 --> 1:25:13.940]  businesses are restaurants now because they pretty much have monopolized retail chains
[1:25:13.940 --> 1:25:19.100]  and now the retail chains because the National Federation of National Retail Federation last
[1:25:19.100 --> 1:25:27.140]  week was pushing these things that these rules that Walmart and Kroger and all these national
[1:25:27.140 --> 1:25:30.620]  chains are pushing that you're not going to come in their stores unless you got a mask
[1:25:30.620 --> 1:25:36.260]  of submission. And so now they're saying you're not going to eat french fries and things like
[1:25:36.260 --> 1:25:42.180]  that at a local restaurant. You can get in your car and said it wasn't long ago that
[1:25:42.180 --> 1:25:47.300]  these people in these same jurisdictions of California especially were freaking out and
[1:25:47.300 --> 1:25:53.300]  not allowing for there to be drive through permits for new fast food locations because
[1:25:53.300 --> 1:25:57.500]  I said you're just wasting too much gas and creating too much pollution for people sitting
[1:25:57.500 --> 1:26:03.220]  there and I don't even go anymore because the lines are so long to go through the drive
[1:26:03.220 --> 1:26:07.300]  through areas. I don't like doing that. I always would park my car and go in because
[1:26:07.300 --> 1:26:12.380]  I don't like to just sit there in the car. It only bothers me and not because I'm concerned
[1:26:12.380 --> 1:26:16.580]  about unicorn farts. I just don't like sitting in an idling car forever and it's like a traffic
[1:26:16.580 --> 1:26:22.020]  jam. It's like we'll begin your meal with a traffic jam. It's like my stomach is already
[1:26:22.020 --> 1:26:28.140]  upset now at this point. But you're allowed to go there because those are national chains
[1:26:28.140 --> 1:26:32.620]  and the point of all of this they can quibble over what a meal is and what a meal isn't
[1:26:32.620 --> 1:26:38.620]  but the point is to get rid of local businesses. Get rid of mom and pop. Get rid of Main Street
[1:26:38.620 --> 1:26:43.100]  because it's only going to be the Wall Street national chains that are going to be allowed.
[1:26:43.100 --> 1:26:47.620]  And then we have Cuomo. They had Cuomo chips and he jumped in on that as well. He said
[1:26:47.620 --> 1:26:53.580]  you're not going to get a meal. Not going to be able to get a drink sitting down outside
[1:26:53.580 --> 1:26:58.900]  unless you get a meal. They said, all right, Cuomo chips, 50 cents, a dollar or whatever.
[1:26:58.900 --> 1:27:04.780]  So he came out and said, no, no, that doesn't qualify. You have to have a quote substantial
[1:27:04.780 --> 1:27:09.660]  amount of food. So he didn't come up with a long list of what it isn't like California
[1:27:09.660 --> 1:27:14.420]  did. It's just as substantial. So he leaves it open because that's up to the arbitrary
[1:27:14.420 --> 1:27:20.260]  enforcers who are going to come around. And remember, excessive police force begins with
[1:27:20.260 --> 1:27:27.300]  excessive rules from government. And that's what they're inviting here. And the restaurants,
[1:27:27.300 --> 1:27:31.540]  one restaurant owner, the executive, actually the executive director of New York City Hospitality
[1:27:31.540 --> 1:27:38.740]  Alliance said the ever changing rules and the lack of clarity is creating enormous challenges
[1:27:38.740 --> 1:27:43.620]  and concerns for small business owners who are in a crisis. That's the whole point. That's
[1:27:43.620 --> 1:27:49.900]  the whole point. Rand Paul had something to say about Cuomo. He took him on national television
[1:27:49.900 --> 1:27:55.380]  of Bret Bear on Fox News. Let's play video clip number five. Here's Rand Paul.
[1:27:55.380 --> 1:27:59.220]  And for a while, the rural states did very well just because we're already socially distanced.
[1:27:59.220 --> 1:28:03.500]  I still think the rural states will do pretty well throughout all of this. But the bigger
[1:28:03.500 --> 1:28:07.340]  cities in the South now are suffering the way New York City did. But the good thing
[1:28:07.340 --> 1:28:12.860]  is, is that I think the governors in Texas and Florida and the doctors are much wiser
[1:28:12.860 --> 1:28:16.740]  than they were. And hopefully won't do as terrible a job as Governor Cuomo did with his
[1:28:16.740 --> 1:28:23.100]  pedant. And well, last thing quickly on that, it's fairly rare for a senator from Kentucky
[1:28:23.100 --> 1:28:26.380]  to call for the impeachment of a government in New York.
[1:28:26.380 --> 1:28:31.180]  Yep, it is rare. Only when they deserve it, and actually Cuomo does deserve it. I think
[1:28:31.180 --> 1:28:35.460]  his sanctimonious presentations of all the things he's going to do through Big Brother
[1:28:35.460 --> 1:28:40.580]  to make us safe again, when what he did was the one public policy decision he had, the
[1:28:40.580 --> 1:28:44.820]  ability to try to make it better. He made it hugely worse by sending people coronavirus
[1:28:44.820 --> 1:28:49.460]  back to nursing homes. Almost half the people died in New Jersey and New York died because
[1:28:49.460 --> 1:28:50.860]  of that public policy decision.
[1:28:50.860 --> 1:28:56.100]  All right, we'll be nursing homes, that's who's right. Stay with us.
[1:28:56.100 --> 1:29:00.500]  This is a pandemic survival alert and the most time sensitive messages you will hear
[1:29:00.500 --> 1:29:05.300]  this year. You still have time to plan a one acre crisis garden and secure a supply of
[1:29:05.300 --> 1:29:09.940]  your own nutrient dense food. But time is running out and it's one deadline you don't
[1:29:09.940 --> 1:29:14.820]  want to miss. Who should plan a crisis garden? Individuals, families, churches, communities,
[1:29:14.820 --> 1:29:19.700]  anyone or any group that sees hard times ahead. Let's face it, even the mainline media is
[1:29:19.700 --> 1:29:23.700]  talking about food supply disruptions and the growing number of grocery store workers who
[1:29:23.700 --> 1:29:24.700]  are becoming sick.
[1:29:24.700 --> 1:29:29.380]  But there's more. Meat packing plans are closing, mile long lines at food pantries and more
[1:29:29.380 --> 1:29:34.460]  farmers now in financial trouble. The truth is growing nutrient dense vegetables this
[1:29:34.460 --> 1:29:39.920]  summer may be the single most important thing you do. Go to survivalseedbank.com and watch

[1:29:52.740 --> 1:30:10.820]  All that under the megaopolis technology plan, things are going to be so incredibly fair and
[1:30:10.820 --> 1:30:15.820]  wonderful because at all seeing all loving computer that doesn't discriminate is going
[1:30:15.820 --> 1:30:23.160]  to be so that you can be made obsolete, domesticated, dumbed down, drugged, distracted, atomized
[1:30:23.160 --> 1:30:30.640]  and then slowly killed. This is the brave new world. It's the post human world. It's
[1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:35.800]  the dreaming of the post human world. The Wired magazine and the Wall Street Journal
[1:30:35.800 --> 1:30:40.800]  all tell us about it. Oh, now they tell us our smart phones don't just track or remove.
[1:30:40.800 --> 1:30:46.360]  They're monitoring our psychology and sending it back to a corporate database globally.
[1:30:46.360 --> 1:30:52.280]  You see the bear trap closed on our leg now and the vampire walked out of the bushes and
[1:30:52.280 --> 1:30:56.960]  is explaining to us how he's slowly going to bleed us and destroy us.
[1:30:56.960 --> 1:31:00.600]  Another part of the Great Awakening that's taking place is people that haven't even been
[1:31:00.600 --> 1:31:06.120]  religious or Christian now see how evil is out in the open, how hundreds of churches
[1:31:06.120 --> 1:31:12.320]  have been burned in Europe and the U.S. Hundreds of Christian icons have been burned destroyed.
[1:31:12.320 --> 1:31:16.160]  Jesuses have had their heads cut off all over the country, all over the Philippines, all
[1:31:16.160 --> 1:31:20.760]  over Europe. Virgin Mary's are getting torn down. I mean crosses are being torn down.
[1:31:20.760 --> 1:31:25.520]  It's absolutely out of control, but people now understand that evil was always real.
[1:31:25.520 --> 1:31:31.240]  It is spiritual and it was just waiting to make its move, building beneath the surface
[1:31:31.240 --> 1:31:35.280]  and now it's emerged. That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer, I mean
[1:31:35.280 --> 1:31:39.240]  it. I'm praying for America. I'm praying for you and I know the power of prayer is real
[1:31:39.240 --> 1:31:43.800]  and God hears it. We need to come together and pray for an even greater awakening. Pray
[1:31:43.800 --> 1:31:49.160]  for Donald Trump to be protected. Pray for him to win a landslide and pray for the people
[1:31:49.160 --> 1:31:53.880]  under deception of the globalist to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom. God bless
[1:31:53.880 --> 1:31:56.920]  you all. Please pray for him for us as well.
[1:31:56.920 --> 1:32:01.040]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup. My second cup of the day, it's really
[1:32:01.040 --> 1:32:05.080]  strong. I shouldn't do this because all work and no play makes Jack a really aggressive
[1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:09.400]  boy and the coffee has to wake up America coffee there by loves highest rated in the
[1:32:09.400 --> 1:32:13.000]  choppers mountains. It's beyond Mexican coffee beyond Guatemala and coffee. It's the best
[1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:16.120]  coffee in the world. It's right on the border between the two countries in those rainforests
[1:32:16.120 --> 1:32:21.000]  hand selected beyond organic while crafted. Wake up America coffee. People are blown away
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:25.320]  about how good it is. Same stuff sold in Whole Foods under another name for $30 for the same
[1:32:25.320 --> 1:32:29.840]  size container. Yes, folks, we've been selling at 10 years, never raised the price. 1995

[1:33:00.560 --> 1:33:10.080]  to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:17.680]  Live from the info wars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now
[1:33:17.680 --> 1:33:27.600]  your host, David Knight. Welcome back. Joining us now is Vince Agnelli. He's in Virginia
[1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:33.680]  and I've talked to him before about efforts to try to rebuild structures from the ground
[1:33:33.680 --> 1:33:40.480]  up. And Vince has been looking at what is happening in Virginia up close. And it's not
[1:33:40.480 --> 1:33:45.680]  only the games that are being played by Ralph Northam and the Democrat Party and the moves
[1:33:45.680 --> 1:33:51.080]  that they're making to try to do gun confiscation. But it's also some curious things that are
[1:33:51.080 --> 1:33:55.960]  not being done by the GOP. And so I wanted to get Vince on to talk about this his website,
[1:33:55.960 --> 1:34:02.200]  by the way, if you want to see what they're trying to do in terms of pulling this up from
[1:34:02.200 --> 1:34:08.800]  the grassroots. It's called new virginia plan.com new virginia plan.com. And you may find something
[1:34:08.800 --> 1:34:13.040]  that you can use in your state as well. If you're in Virginia, you can educate yourself
[1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:19.240]  there about what really needs to be done because, as I've said, for quite some time, things
[1:34:19.240 --> 1:34:24.760]  have become completely corrupt in Washington. We've got to get past this mindset that we're
[1:34:24.760 --> 1:34:30.680]  going to be able to fix things from Washington. Washington is the problem. Ronald Reagan said
[1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:35.720]  that a long time ago and that is absolutely true. Now the swamp and the bureaucratic institutions
[1:34:35.720 --> 1:34:40.680]  that are there as we've seen through the Trump administration, they are so entrenched,
[1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:44.920]  so powerful, you're not going to be able to get one person or even a few people that
[1:34:44.920 --> 1:34:49.000]  are going to be able to go in there and change that. It has to be cut off and rebuilt from
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:53.640]  the bottom up, not saved from the top down. So joining us now is Vince Agnelli. Thank
[1:34:53.640 --> 1:34:58.320]  you for joining us, Vince. Thank you for having me on, David. Let's talk a little bit about
[1:34:58.320 --> 1:35:03.040]  what's going on Virginia because it just came out in the news today that Northern is, of
[1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:07.760]  course, giving illegals the ability to get driver's licenses there in Virginia. I guess
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:12.600]  that's a prelude for voting, right? Well, that's a prelude for a lot of things. Number
[1:35:12.600 --> 1:35:17.560]  one, it certainly takes a lot of the money that people pay in taxes for their roads or
[1:35:17.560 --> 1:35:23.240]  for snow, getting cloud, you know, all that good stuff goes to something else that they
[1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:27.800]  don't pay for and they didn't vote for. That's right. And do you have like motor voter laws
[1:35:27.800 --> 1:35:31.640]  that we see in so many different places if you've got a driver's license? Yeah, they've
[1:35:31.640 --> 1:35:36.920]  had that for a number of years and of course they gave the right to vote back to felons
[1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:42.440]  a few years back. Yeah. Yeah. And so we see that these are the types of tricks that we're
[1:35:42.440 --> 1:35:47.120]  all familiar with at this point. You know, in North Carolina, where I live for a long
[1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:53.640]  period of time, we had the earliest and longest voting period. You didn't even have to show
[1:35:53.640 --> 1:35:58.080]  a driver's license. You could just go in with a name and address and they had a print out
[1:35:58.080 --> 1:36:04.040]  there. And in the 2012 election, a friend of my brother-in-law's went in to vote and
[1:36:04.040 --> 1:36:07.560]  they said, sorry, you've already voted. And so is this other person at this address? And
[1:36:07.560 --> 1:36:12.080]  so, well, that's my mother. She's been dead for several years. But you know, you don't
[1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:16.680]  have any, and he didn't report that. He didn't want to come on the show and talk about that.
[1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:20.880]  And so, you know, the left tells us and the Democrat press tells us that never happens,
[1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:26.600]  but it does. And the registrars in Virginia are not even really, they're loosely affiliated
[1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:32.720]  and tied and they can do whatever they want to do. That includes not investigate fraud
[1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:35.360]  when it comes before them. We've seen that happen.
[1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:42.160]  Now, let's talk a little bit about what's going on in terms of the GOP not running. You
[1:36:42.160 --> 1:36:45.400]  pointed this out to me before. It's one of the reasons I had you on to talk about this.
[1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:46.400]  Right.
[1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:50.920]  Everybody talked about the big blue wave in Virginia. You pointed out that the GOP didn't
[1:36:50.920 --> 1:36:58.760]  even field candidates in enough jurisdictions enough to have a majority, even if all of
[1:36:58.760 --> 1:37:03.280]  them won. They would still been a minority party. What is happening this time?
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:07.760]  Well, we have that document. That's up on the website. You'll see it report on election
[1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:14.640]  irregularities. People can read that. And what I decided to do was take a look at the
[1:37:14.640 --> 1:37:19.520]  races for Virginia's congressional seats as they're coming up, of course, this is being
[1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:26.760]  a big year. And for the first time in decades, the Virginia Republican party has decided
[1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:35.160]  to run candidates in all of the districts. And if you go ahead, look at the polling.
[1:37:35.160 --> 1:37:41.560]  They poll that there are three races in Virginia that are close. And two of them have always
[1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:48.800]  been questionable or I would say stolen. And another one's probably going to slip away
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:55.400]  back to the Democrats. Honestly, if you take a look at the new laws in Virginia for voting,
[1:37:55.400 --> 1:38:01.160]  I believe the three days beyond the end of the election allows them to still put in absentee
[1:38:01.160 --> 1:38:07.040]  ballots. There are so many of these crazy laws now that there will never be a so-called
[1:38:07.040 --> 1:38:09.280]  Republican to run the state.
[1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:15.400]  Yeah. And your suspicion was, and I think it's likely true, that they're really, you
[1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:19.480]  know, they're kind of the controlled opposition, the GOP at this point. They were kind of halfway
[1:38:19.480 --> 1:38:22.960]  pushing toward this. And we've talked about that a couple of times. I've mentioned a couple
[1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:26.440]  of times on air. You've been on air talking about that. So now they're going to put candidates
[1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:31.080]  up in every one of these jurisdictions, but it still really isn't going to happen, is
[1:38:31.080 --> 1:38:32.080]  it?
[1:38:32.080 --> 1:38:36.000]  That's right. When they lose, they'll turn around and say, well, you see, it doesn't
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:40.640]  matter if we put somebody in a racionaut, we know where we can win and Virginia is all
[1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:43.520]  blue. That's just not the case.
[1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:48.360]  So what do we do at this point? I mean, we've got the federal government is really gone.
[1:38:48.360 --> 1:38:53.160]  Many state governments are as well. What do we do to rebuild this? What's the new Virginia
[1:38:53.160 --> 1:38:54.160]  plan?
[1:38:54.160 --> 1:38:57.600]  Well, as you point out, people keep pointing to the president must do this, the president
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:39:00.520]  must do that. It's not his job to start with.
[1:39:00.520 --> 1:39:01.520]  That's right.
[1:39:01.520 --> 1:39:02.520]  That's right.
[1:39:02.520 --> 1:39:07.200]  And the party sort of wants to decide who they're going to put into these seats, and
[1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:12.280]  they want to let the regular people run for office. You know that you've tried that yourself.
[1:39:12.280 --> 1:39:13.600]  You know how difficult that is.
[1:39:13.600 --> 1:39:15.120]  That's right.
[1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:19.720]  And the only way you can control this is to get hold of your government. If you have to
[1:39:19.720 --> 1:39:24.280]  do it locally, then you have to do it locally. But for us in Virginia, we're looking at the
[1:39:24.280 --> 1:39:31.120]  Second Amendment Sanctuary map that was put out through everyone's hard work by, I believe
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:38.880]  the end of January, everyone saw 95% of Virginia once they're gone.
[1:39:38.880 --> 1:39:44.440]  And now we have the VCDL is out there pushing a resolution to these same places saying,
[1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:46.920]  please don't make crazy laws.
[1:39:46.920 --> 1:39:52.880]  Exposed facto laws that say your guns are illegal. And that's something else that everyone
[1:39:52.880 --> 1:39:57.080]  needs to watch because that's going to happen as well. God bless the VCDL for their hard
[1:39:57.080 --> 1:39:58.080]  work.
[1:39:58.080 --> 1:40:00.960]  And that's one of the things that I'm concerned about. You know, we talk about, well, you
[1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:04.960]  know, we need to, we've got a problem here. And whatever the problem is, maybe it's your
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:08.380]  own personal drug addiction. Well, we need to have the federal government solve this
[1:40:08.380 --> 1:40:12.760]  for me. And now we're looking at the situation that's been manufactured by Democrats in
[1:40:12.760 --> 1:40:18.680]  many of these progressive cities where they are Portland as a best example, I think we
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:24.400]  have both the mayor as well as the governor, Portland and Seattle, all of them are saying,
[1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:29.120]  no, we want this to happen. You know, get rid of the police. We want, you know, Andy
[1:40:29.120 --> 1:40:34.920]  von the streets burning and rioting. And we don't want any law or order here. And people
[1:40:34.920 --> 1:40:38.160]  are looking at this and saying, well, we need to fix this and we need to fix it with the
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:41.840]  federal government. And we need to have the president send troops and that's a very dangerous
[1:40:41.840 --> 1:40:45.480]  precedent because at some point in time, and it may not be too far off, we're going to
[1:40:45.480 --> 1:40:51.720]  wind up with a radical left Democrat as president. And what are they going to do about guns,
[1:40:51.720 --> 1:40:54.960]  Vince? Yes, it pays everything you said, paves the
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:41:00.800]  way for the next person office. And that's exactly what they're going to exercise that
[1:41:00.800 --> 1:41:06.120]  power flex that muscle. And when the, when the bounties of the world get out there and
[1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:10.480]  say, this is our land, they're going to say, well, you know what, the last president said,
[1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:14.960]  no, and we're just going to come in and take it. That's right. So this all begins with
[1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:21.920]  us developing an attitude of self responsibility and taking charge for things to push towards
[1:41:21.920 --> 1:41:26.680]  our own individual liberty as a community, not, you know, to act collectively for individual
[1:41:26.680 --> 1:41:31.640]  liberty and to do it at the local level. We have to understand globalism. We have to understand
[1:41:31.640 --> 1:41:36.560]  what the globalist agenda is, but we have to act locally. The left got that right. They
[1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:41.520]  said, I think globally and act locally. Well, we have to understand and not think that we're
[1:41:41.520 --> 1:41:45.000]  going to get these problems. You know, we're going to change the world, but we have to
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:48.920]  just say, we're going to, we're going to cut off this globalism and we're going to take
[1:41:48.920 --> 1:41:53.280]  this back locally. What are you doing with the, the new Virginia plan?
[1:41:53.280 --> 1:41:58.120]  What we are doing is with word of mouth. If you go to the website, you'll see that there's
[1:41:58.120 --> 1:42:03.560]  no email contact there because we don't want keyboard warriors. People have to go face
[1:42:03.560 --> 1:42:09.720]  to face. That's good. We've, we've decided to give or share our documentation, our beliefs
[1:42:09.720 --> 1:42:14.800]  with everyone on the website, print them out, take them with you, go talk to your neighbors,
[1:42:14.800 --> 1:42:20.520]  go talk to people, you know, around your county or your town. And if you want to get together
[1:42:20.520 --> 1:42:28.400]  and repeat the only really proven way of doing this through what the founders did, there's,
[1:42:28.400 --> 1:42:30.840]  there is your work. So I'll cut out for you.
[1:42:30.840 --> 1:42:34.640]  That's excellent. I especially like the fact that you set point out, you don't want keyboard
[1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:38.600]  warriors. Here's what we're going to do. You said, but look, you're going to meet with
[1:42:38.600 --> 1:42:43.280]  each other, face to face and get this done. And that's the key thing. They have everything
[1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:48.760]  that they've done is designed to keep us from meeting together as human beings. That's what
[1:42:48.760 --> 1:42:54.400]  they want to shut down. Thank you so much. Vince Agnelli and again, new Virginia plan
[1:42:54.400 --> 1:43:01.400]  dot com.
[1:43:54.400 --> 1:44:00.480]  He reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown. The number one reason
[1:44:00.480 --> 1:44:06.960]  is it serves every one of their purposes. We've gone over those purposes many times
[1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:12.400]  here on air. The casual society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny,
[1:44:12.400 --> 1:44:18.760]  forced inoculation. The most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that
[1:44:18.760 --> 1:44:26.920]  we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over
[1:44:26.920 --> 1:44:33.080]  the jobs that people once had by design. This isn't like it's some advancement that
[1:44:33.080 --> 1:44:40.160]  we just fell into. It's been preplanned, organized globally. And it's extremely predatory.
[1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:45.560]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks
[1:44:45.560 --> 1:44:52.120]  that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power. This
[1:44:52.120 --> 1:44:57.240]  is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[1:44:57.240 --> 1:45:03.080]  You can't make this stuff up. A consortium of the UN WHO, the Bill and Melinda Gates
[1:45:03.080 --> 1:45:08.480]  Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and of course the Clinton Global Initiative
[1:45:08.480 --> 1:45:13.680]  headed up by Chelsea Clinton on the board are in control with Apple and Google with
[1:45:13.680 --> 1:45:19.160]  a hidden app on all phones that you cannot turn off. The track and trace everywhere you
[1:45:19.160 --> 1:45:24.160]  go, they claim for COVID, but of course it's really the Chinese Communist social score
[1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:30.600]  rollout. These people are sick, filthy criminals, and they want total control over society with
[1:45:30.600 --> 1:45:35.360]  the official global ID system. That's why it's called the Clinton Global Initiative.
[1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:41.560]  But you can fight back with the privacy pockets at infowarstore.com, little fair day cages,
[1:45:41.560 --> 1:45:47.200]  little envelopes, put your phone in it, and these dirty scumbag fascist pieces of garbage
[1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:52.520]  can't get all that data and rape you with that data. Rape your privacy. Tell the rapist
[1:45:52.520 --> 1:45:57.400]  Clintons go to hell and get your privacy pockets in infowarstore.

[1:47:13.480 --> 1:47:21.400]  The Democratic Party, Antifa, and other leftist groups are all over Twitter, all over Facebook,
[1:47:21.400 --> 1:47:26.720]  putting out tweets with hundreds of thousands and even millions of views, showing clips
[1:47:26.720 --> 1:47:33.640]  of myself in the rotoscoped film, A Scanner Darkly, with Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson,
[1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:40.080]  a bunch of other people, and actually consulted on that film. I actually recommended that
[1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:46.960]  scene, something that's not actually in the book by Philip K. Dick, where the black man
[1:47:46.960 --> 1:47:54.720]  pulls up and grabs me and throws me in it and takes me away. Now, I basically, as a consultant
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:48:00.280]  on the film came up with that, because at the time in the early 2000s, we found federal
[1:48:00.280 --> 1:48:06.280]  documents where Bush, in this involvement going on under Clinton, was preparing basically
[1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:11.960]  snatching grab teams of federal offices around the country to go and grab protesters off
[1:48:11.960 --> 1:48:17.200]  the streets and disappear them. And so the tweets are out there going, look, Jones warned
[1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:24.880]  about all this exactly, and now it's happening. He's a horrible person. No, that's not what's
[1:48:24.880 --> 1:48:30.960]  happening. The federal and state governments, if they're four of and by the people and are
[1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:35.880]  run according to constitution, they're transparent or a good thing. And so I'm on an enemy of
[1:48:35.880 --> 1:48:39.120]  the federal government or the state government or the police. I was an enemy of them being
[1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:44.840]  taught UN brainwashing, being taught plans to put people in reeducation camps, being
[1:48:44.840 --> 1:48:51.160]  taught plans to take on constitutional, quote, terrorist and run gun confiscation operations.
[1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:57.160]  When I learned about these programs going on, I exposed them on air and also in film and
[1:48:57.160 --> 1:49:14.600]  places like a scanner, darkly. So now the establishment globalist media bought and paid
[1:49:14.600 --> 1:49:20.280]  for by the communist Chinese and others that openly say the country shouldn't even exist
[1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:30.200]  are showing videos of black vans with federal police in camo uniforms and gas masks very
[1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:36.680]  dystopic grabbing people off the street and putting them into vans. They're then taken,
[1:49:36.680 --> 1:49:41.360]  they're questioned, they're either released or they are put in jail and indicted. Now,
[1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:47.760]  yes, this is a dystopic image, but understand something. The globalist have created the
[1:49:47.760 --> 1:49:55.160]  riots and created the destabilization in their dialectic so they can now respond with federal
[1:49:55.160 --> 1:49:59.800]  force. And then once the globalists take full control of the country, they'll have the police
[1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:04.080]  state in place that they help bring in by the terrorism they generated. And that's the
[1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:12.120]  most important part of this break. Now, the media is not showing you the communist anti
[1:50:12.120 --> 1:50:17.520]  funded by Soros and Alexander Soros publicly with hatchets and clubs breaking into the
[1:50:17.520 --> 1:50:22.160]  federal courthouse. They're not showing you footage of them setting fire to the courthouse
[1:50:22.160 --> 1:50:27.920]  or the local police station. They're not showing you footage of them attacking the federal
[1:50:27.920 --> 1:50:34.800]  officers in mass and trying to kill them or shooting lasers into their eyes. They're saying
[1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:39.880]  peaceful demonstrators are out here and the police are attacking them for no reason. And
[1:50:39.880 --> 1:50:44.280]  the feds shouldn't be here. It's not their jurisdiction. It is their jurisdiction when
[1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:49.960]  they continue to attack the federal building. Just like Tim Poole, who was part of Occupy,
[1:50:49.960 --> 1:50:56.120]  Wall Street, famous reporter from that, he's a liberal said, stop attacking the federal
[1:50:56.120 --> 1:51:02.760]  courthouse. The feds have a right to exist. Them existing is not illegal. And if you
[1:51:02.760 --> 1:51:11.440]  stop attacking the courthouse, this will all end because that's the truth. So again, yes,
[1:51:11.440 --> 1:51:16.960]  I predicted black vans grabbing people. That's how this works. And yes, it's now happening,
[1:51:16.960 --> 1:51:22.440]  but they're being released or they're being charged. It's the disappear part. There's
[1:51:22.440 --> 1:51:27.920]  the authoritarianism. Let me tell you who's disappearing. It's people that drive up to
[1:51:27.920 --> 1:51:35.000]  anti fund BLM checkpoints in Provo, Utah and places in Colorado and New York and Texas
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:40.680]  who get shot in the head because they're white and they go into comas and they die. It's
[1:51:40.680 --> 1:51:45.120]  people dying from the knockout game. Whites are now 12 times more likely to be attacked
[1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:50.320]  by blacks because of this whole atmosphere saying kill a whitey for mommy instead of
[1:51:50.320 --> 1:51:55.440]  kill a commie for mommy. This is what the corporate media and the establishment have
[1:51:55.440 --> 1:52:02.760]  created. You have Wallace anarchists funded by the globalist running around physically
[1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:08.760]  attacking people, beating up people that have children with them, stealing people's cars,
[1:52:08.760 --> 1:52:12.600]  cutting people out of their vehicles, hitting people in the head with hammers. It's been
[1:52:12.600 --> 1:52:19.120]  going on for years and the corporate media defends it and says that it's a good group
[1:52:19.120 --> 1:52:22.520]  and that we should support them. And now they're out in the streets with guns saying they're
[1:52:22.520 --> 1:52:27.600]  getting ready to start killing people. When we march with guns, it's for self defense
[1:52:27.600 --> 1:52:31.240]  to point out we have that right. We don't say we're going to start a violent revolution
[1:52:31.240 --> 1:52:37.000]  and offensively start killing people. The individuals that start the war are the bad
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:44.680]  guys and so they're running an adjutant operation trying to manipulate Trump into having an
[1:52:44.680 --> 1:52:51.440]  over response so the media can then say all these people are victims being oppressed by
[1:52:51.440 --> 1:52:56.320]  a police state. When they are the ones that have created this lawless atmosphere but then
[1:52:56.320 --> 1:53:01.200]  if Trump doesn't respond, it only emboldens these groups more to take even more action
[1:53:01.200 --> 1:53:08.480]  and that's how this dialectic and psychological operation works. This is all building in a
[1:53:08.480 --> 1:53:15.280]  massive, massive way towards the overthrow of the federal and state governments and a
[1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:19.560]  UN government coming in that will oversee the United States and actually break it into
[1:53:19.560 --> 1:53:25.960]  subdivisions that are controlled along ethnic lines. This is the real plan. Now here I am
[1:53:25.960 --> 1:53:33.500]  several years ago in the podcast studio predicting and breaking all of this down yet again and
[1:53:33.500 --> 1:53:38.480]  you see it coming true. We can stop it if we're aware of it. They have now been for
[1:53:38.480 --> 1:53:43.880]  over a year and a half trying to foment insurrection and civil war in this country and have been
[1:53:43.880 --> 1:53:50.280]  trying to push the narrative that President Trump is somehow a Russian agent. They have
[1:53:50.280 --> 1:53:55.120]  intensified their calls for him to be killed or for him to be removed under the 25th amendment
[1:53:55.120 --> 1:54:00.920]  or under a military coup on MSNBC, CNN and every other major channel. I am afraid for
[1:54:00.920 --> 1:54:06.720]  my nation. I'm afraid for my family. I personally am not afraid of myself. I am afraid for
[1:54:06.720 --> 1:54:13.920]  the society that doesn't deserve President Trump. Trump has put himself in the center
[1:54:13.920 --> 1:54:21.880]  of unprecedented attacks in history, unprecedented lies, unprecedented deception and they are
[1:54:21.880 --> 1:54:27.480]  now launching the ignition phase. You can smell it. You can see it. They're admitting
[1:54:27.480 --> 1:54:34.040]  it to remove President Trump by this fall. They are now back on television, not just
[1:54:34.040 --> 1:54:40.440]  at policy forums, but on mainline TV saying overthrow him US military. They have all of
[1:54:40.440 --> 1:54:45.440]  their Democrat operatives, Alexandria, Cortez and others will play this in a moment saying
[1:54:45.440 --> 1:54:50.840]  occupy federal buildings, occupy ice, occupy the border, blow off the doors of the castle.
[1:54:50.840 --> 1:54:56.160]  We have to occupy all of it. We need to occupy every airport. We need to occupy every border.
[1:54:56.160 --> 1:55:01.320]  We need to occupy every ice office. We are here trying to save the country. We have to
[1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:06.480]  repudiate Antifa and BLM as globalist organs of revolution or for the Democratic Party
[1:55:06.480 --> 1:55:11.520]  and the Chai comms. We must support the president and federal enforcement when they're carrying
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:16.800]  out constitutional duties. When the feds attacked Waco and murdered those people, that was wrong.
[1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:20.960]  They offensively attacked them for PR at bloop in their face. That's evil. Those were Nazis
[1:55:20.960 --> 1:55:25.680]  in my view. Those were evil people that did that. Misguided fools, some of them, but most
[1:55:25.680 --> 1:55:30.280]  of them really bad out of control. They wanted to start targeting American citizens of paramilitary
[1:55:30.280 --> 1:55:35.600]  force. That's not what this is. This is paramilitary forces attacking federal buildings to take
[1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:47.360]  them over to control our lives and make themselves our rulers and our controllers.
[1:55:47.360 --> 1:55:53.240]  We're back here. We've got a Christmas in July special that's going to be ending in
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:57.760]  just a few days. At the end of the month, we've extended it through July. We now have
[1:55:57.760 --> 1:56:02.160]  free shipping, double-patriot points. We can get extra discounts in the future for orders.
[1:56:02.160 --> 1:56:10.320]  50% to 60% off. We have things like bodys, natural fighter of inflammation in your joints
[1:56:10.320 --> 1:56:14.440]  and other places. Turmeric and many other natural ingredients work together very effectively.
[1:56:14.440 --> 1:56:18.760]  That's selling out now. It's been 50% off like many of these products. Living defense
[1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:26.280]  plus 50% off. Vaso beat, 50% off. Vitamin mineral fusion drink mix, 50% off. All of those
[1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:30.440]  are selling out very quickly. Free shipping, double-patriot points. We also have my favorite
[1:56:30.440 --> 1:56:37.160]  supplement, Brainforce Plus, as well as Winter Sun Plus. I'm surprised that that is not sold
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:42.240]  out already. Frankly, if you are concerned about your health, not only do you want to
[1:56:42.240 --> 1:56:45.600]  make sure that you've got something like vitamin mineral fusion drink mix is going to get your
[1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:52.040]  baseline nutrition, but you also want to make sure that your immune system is in peak condition
[1:56:52.040 --> 1:56:57.640]  as well. We were warned about this going back into March. We had the former head of the
[1:56:57.640 --> 1:57:05.120]  FDA, as well as the, I'm sorry, former head of the CDC for Dan, as well as a scientist
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:12.880]  at the NIH. Also joining in with everybody, the natural health movement saying you've
[1:57:12.880 --> 1:57:17.680]  got to have vitamin D in order to have a strong immune system. Vitamin D is not going to kill
[1:57:17.680 --> 1:57:24.280]  COVID-19 or anything else, but without a strong immune system, you are putting yourself at
[1:57:24.280 --> 1:57:29.040]  risk and especially when you are kept in sight. That's one of the key issues about this.
[1:57:29.040 --> 1:57:33.880]  All right, we've got to take a break. Take a look at the products at the InfowarsStore.com.
[1:57:33.880 --> 1:57:38.520]  Free shipping, double-patriot points, 50 to 60% off InfowarsStore.com. We'll be right
[1:57:38.520 --> 1:57:39.520]  back.
[1:57:39.520 --> 1:57:52.440]  Americans have had freedom for so long and most Americans were born into such docile times
[1:57:52.440 --> 1:57:57.400]  compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny. We don't appreciate
[1:57:57.400 --> 1:58:02.440]  the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property
[1:58:02.440 --> 1:58:06.280]  because we've had it so long and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[1:58:06.280 --> 1:58:11.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try
[1:58:11.040 --> 1:58:15.360]  to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as
[1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:20.520]  well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world. That's
[1:58:20.520 --> 1:58:25.320]  now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad
[1:58:25.320 --> 1:58:30.680]  for the earth and we need to be cold and dumb down and put into subgroups that the elites
[1:58:30.680 --> 1:58:35.280]  dominate, manipulate and command even if we're even lucky enough to stay alive. And that's
[1:58:35.280 --> 1:58:42.040]  what COVID-19 is, a global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against
[1:58:42.040 --> 1:58:44.960]  prosperity and against your future. If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what
[1:58:44.960 --> 1:58:52.400]  you get. Vicky Gibbs, 57-year-old lesbian preacher
[1:58:52.400 --> 1:59:01.120]  in Houston, went in with a cough, got intubated and then died. And as soon as I saw her face,
[1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:04.800]  as soon as I saw the report, I said, watch, it'll be innovation. We know what's going
[1:59:04.800 --> 1:59:11.240]  to happen. It's a blue city, same story yet again. And they say her heart gave out. If
[1:59:11.240 --> 1:59:16.280]  you put somebody on a breathing tube of COVID-19 as a death sentence, it's on record. Want
[1:59:16.280 --> 1:59:20.320]  everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get killed. Why are almost all the deaths
[1:59:20.320 --> 1:59:24.840]  happening in blue cities and blue states? It's because they intubate them, putting a
[1:59:24.840 --> 1:59:30.080]  tube in their lungs and COVID-19 is causing an autoimmune response. And if you do that
[1:59:30.080 --> 1:59:35.800]  with oxygen, the doctors are on record saying it will kill you. But all these doctors in
[1:59:35.800 --> 1:59:41.440]  blue cities and blue states follow their orders. And the minute I saw this report today, I knew
[1:59:41.440 --> 1:59:50.520]  what I would be reading. Don't end up like Vicky Gibbs or everyone.
[1:59:50.520 --> 2:00:14.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. We have crippled the economy. That's what
[2:00:14.920 --> 2:00:20.880]  Rand Paul says. I said from the very beginning, I said the worst possible thing we could do
[2:00:20.880 --> 2:00:26.960]  would be to follow the example of China. You know, I think that there was certainly an
[2:00:26.960 --> 2:00:33.360]  attempt to make a bioweapon. And fortunately, it turns out that it wasn't as deadly as perhaps
[2:00:33.360 --> 2:00:39.320]  they had hoped when Fauci helped to fund that as he did at the University of North Carolina,
[2:00:39.320 --> 2:00:44.600]  Chapel Hill. But I said, as people were saying, we got to lock everything down because this
[2:00:44.600 --> 2:00:50.040]  is an engineered bioweapon. I said, look, let's hope that this isn't as dangerous as
[2:00:50.040 --> 2:00:57.800]  it possibly could be. But I said, if we follow the Chinese pattern and we lock down our economy,
[2:00:57.800 --> 2:01:01.720]  that will destroy us. It's not going to save that. It's like the war on drugs. You know,
[2:01:01.720 --> 2:01:06.640]  you got a real problem. Well, let's try this thing over here. We got a fire. I got some
[2:01:06.640 --> 2:01:10.640]  liquid over here in the bucket. Let's throw that on. Let's not look to see whether that's
[2:01:10.640 --> 2:01:15.320]  water or gasoline. And even if it's water, that might not be the right thing for that
[2:01:15.320 --> 2:01:20.200]  particular type of fire, right? So you need to know what you're doing before you just
[2:01:20.200 --> 2:01:25.840]  throw this out there. And I've seen this as the radical left pushes these quote unquote
[2:01:25.840 --> 2:01:31.960]  solutions over and over again, or the right pushing solutions, quote unquote. I've seen
[2:01:31.960 --> 2:01:36.200]  this refrain use over and over again. We got to do something. This is a problem. We got
[2:01:36.200 --> 2:01:40.760]  to do something. Just do it now. I don't care what this is. I've heard people saying that
[2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:48.040]  at the speaking in favor of Hillary care back in the early 90s as I was speaking against
[2:01:48.040 --> 2:01:55.080]  it, getting jeered at because I talked about freedom and I talked about charity and some
[2:01:55.080 --> 2:01:58.480]  of these other cases and things that we could do to make it more of a free market. I was
[2:01:58.480 --> 2:02:07.680]  jeered by the Democrats because of Democrat run meeting. It was a gerrymandered district
[2:02:07.680 --> 2:02:11.520]  for a Democrat there in North Carolina. But I'm seeing the same type of thing here with
[2:02:11.520 --> 2:02:15.720]  the economy and Rand Paul is exactly right. The lockdowns were a big mistake. We know
[2:02:15.720 --> 2:02:23.640]  that now. And yet the Republican Party under Mitch McConnell is now pushing even more.
[2:02:23.640 --> 2:02:30.840]  Another trillion dollars, right? You had the office of management budget was saying at
[2:02:30.840 --> 2:02:34.640]  the beginning of 2019, we're going to have a deficit of a trillion dollars. We can't
[2:02:34.640 --> 2:02:39.320]  do that. This country will go bankrupt if we do that on an annual basis. Now we have,
[2:02:39.320 --> 2:02:42.520]  every month, we're throwing in another trillion dollars. So the Tea Party is rising up against
[2:02:42.520 --> 2:02:50.440]  McConnell. Rand Paul is saying it's wrong. We have Chuck Baldwin saying this is a power
[2:02:50.440 --> 2:02:53.960]  elite in the process of turning the world upside down. They're destroying our banking
[2:02:53.960 --> 2:02:58.960]  system, our educational system, our transportation system, our religious system, our health system,
[2:02:58.960 --> 2:03:03.320]  our economic system, our entertainment system, our political system, our retirement system,
[2:03:03.320 --> 2:03:10.600]  our legal system. In other words, they're destroying our liberty. And a word, our liberty.
[2:03:10.600 --> 2:03:15.040]  Because every one of those things came from our God given liberty that was protected by
[2:03:15.040 --> 2:03:18.600]  the Constitution. They're destroying the Constitution and every aspect of that. Let
[2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:22.520]  me just pull this down into one aspect here because we only got about a minute and a half
[2:03:22.520 --> 2:03:32.720]  left in this segment. The AI robo-barber cutting hair in post COVID world. Now the Terminator
[2:03:32.720 --> 2:03:38.440]  robots may be coming after you. You look at these Boston dynamic robots. They look like
[2:03:38.440 --> 2:03:45.040]  they could kill, look like they're designed to do that. It was part of a DARPA program.
[2:03:45.040 --> 2:03:48.580]  But it may not be the Terminator robot that's going to come in and shoot you. Instead, they
[2:03:48.580 --> 2:03:53.080]  may just kill your job and leave you to commit suicide because when we look at what is happening,
[2:03:53.080 --> 2:03:58.880]  the fear and how the government has been able to turn us against each other. And I'm not
[2:03:58.880 --> 2:04:03.680]  just talking about Republican versus Democrat, black versus white, but you're afraid of all
[2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:08.200]  humans out there, aren't you? You hear somebody sneezing, you're afraid. And so you want a
[2:04:08.200 --> 2:04:13.600]  robot to cook your meal. You want a robot to deliver your meal. You want a robot to cut
[2:04:13.600 --> 2:04:19.360]  your hair, right? That's what they're talking about here. Yeah, it's not essential to have
[2:04:19.360 --> 2:04:25.040]  barber shops, but it's essential enough for these people to spend a lot of R&D to create
[2:04:25.040 --> 2:04:30.600]  a robot to do that, to replace the humans because that's what is actually essential.
[2:04:30.600 --> 2:04:34.320]  And it's not just replacing the cooks and the barbers. It's also replacing the doctors
[2:04:34.320 --> 2:04:40.120]  and the lawyers, 70% of them, according to a South Korean study. They're just using
[2:04:40.120 --> 2:04:44.760]  the virus as an excuse so you don't pull out the guillotines and come after them. We'll
[2:04:44.760 --> 2:04:54.920]  be right back. Stay with us.
[2:04:54.920 --> 2:05:00.840]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist
[2:05:00.840 --> 2:05:07.320]  Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI. The good news is they had to do that
[2:05:07.320 --> 2:05:13.240]  to carry out this world government COVID takeover. This planetary corporate reset that
[2:05:13.240 --> 2:05:19.040]  COVID covers for because the truth is powerful and we'll defeat them and we'll smash them.
[2:05:19.040 --> 2:05:26.280]  And the good news is there's still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com,
[2:05:26.280 --> 2:05:30.640]  Paul Watson site, summit.news and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive
[2:05:30.640 --> 2:05:38.080]  traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master
[2:05:38.080 --> 2:05:44.320]  of our own destinies. Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization,
[2:05:44.320 --> 2:05:49.600]  a war on our health, a war on our economy, but being aware of it and standing up to it
[2:05:49.600 --> 2:06:05.440]  and speaking out against it will defeat it. So take action or be slaves.
[2:06:05.440 --> 2:06:10.920]  Is President Trump playing 3D chess or is he being blackmailed somehow by the deep state?
[2:06:10.920 --> 2:06:16.720]  There's no mistake. Bill Gates and the globalist are the world government UN deep state. They
[2:06:16.720 --> 2:06:20.720]  are the individual setting up corporate planetary government to carry out eugenics. That is
[2:06:20.720 --> 2:06:25.800]  on record. What has happened to President Trump? Has he been captured? Has he been
[2:06:25.800 --> 2:06:34.720]  compromised? Bill, since you tried to warn us about this pandemic and we didn't listen,
[2:06:34.720 --> 2:06:39.200]  what's the next thing you're warning us about that's going to happen five years from now
[2:06:39.200 --> 2:06:45.800]  that we're not listening to at the present? Well, I didn't want to be right. What I wanted
[2:06:45.800 --> 2:06:51.240]  to do is I understand. I'm not saying you won. Everybody loses. Nobody wins with us.
[2:06:51.240 --> 2:06:55.600]  And I'm not saying that you're that you're this is not an end zone dance. I'm just saying
[2:06:55.600 --> 2:07:02.840]  what else are we not listening to that we need to take action on now? Well, the the
[2:07:02.840 --> 2:07:09.120]  idea of a bioterrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario because they're a pathogen
[2:07:09.120 --> 2:07:13.560]  with a high death rate would be ticked. Now, the good news is, okay, the pressure is up
[2:07:13.560 --> 2:07:21.040]  and I'm late now. Most the work we're going to do to be ready for pandemic two, I call
[2:07:21.040 --> 2:07:25.800]  this pandemic one, most the work we'll do to be ready for that are also the things we
[2:07:25.800 --> 2:07:35.160]  need to do to minimize the threat of a bioterrorism. Well, Mr Gates, thanks so much for being here.
[2:07:35.160 --> 2:07:38.080]  Thanks so much for the efforts you and your organization are doing to try to find the
[2:07:38.080 --> 2:07:43.680]  cure for this. And we'll see you again. Stay safe. Great. Our best everybody else in the
[2:07:43.680 --> 2:07:52.200]  bunker. Thank you. Thank you. I have looked at all the angles of what President Trump
[2:07:52.200 --> 2:07:58.320]  is doing, pulling us out of Afghanistan, pulling us out of Syria, pulling us out of the WHO,
[2:07:58.320 --> 2:08:01.920]  saying Americanism on globalism, standing up to Communist China and the terrible things
[2:08:01.920 --> 2:08:07.160]  they've done in one sided trade deals, working with the CFR to deindustrialize and economically
[2:08:07.160 --> 2:08:10.720]  defeat America. And the hundreds of other great things he's done, marching in pro-life
[2:08:10.720 --> 2:08:15.360]  rally, something other Republican president has done, the list goes on and on. But now,
[2:08:15.360 --> 2:08:21.160]  with what he's announcing and the major term he's made, promoting the mask and promoting
[2:08:21.160 --> 2:08:26.440]  the vaccine and more and more ally insult with the whole Bill Gates Combine, what is
[2:08:26.440 --> 2:08:31.160]  it that he knows that we don't know? Well, one big thing that I have predicted would
[2:08:31.160 --> 2:08:35.640]  happen to now Gates has even said it, as I keep mentioning in that famous interview
[2:08:35.640 --> 2:08:39.720]  two and a half months ago with Colbert, is that this was just a beta test. He said this
[2:08:39.720 --> 2:08:44.360]  was really just a drill. This was really just a drill. And the next big one's coming, it's
[2:08:44.360 --> 2:08:48.320]  going to be terrorist with a bio weapon. You see, that's what's really going on here,
[2:08:48.320 --> 2:08:51.840]  where they infect everyone with a certain type of coronavirus that's indistinguishable
[2:08:51.840 --> 2:08:56.000]  from others, everybody's suspects. And then they roll out other versions of it that are
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:59.320]  actually more deadly. And I've just studied him so long that I predicted Gates would
[2:08:59.320 --> 2:09:02.680]  make announcements like that before he did. It's just, it's thousands and thousands of
[2:09:02.680 --> 2:09:06.760]  data points. And so I think Trump realizes the trap is set that if he keeps saying the
[2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:10.800]  virus isn't deadly in his own problem, when again, this, this phase of it is a hoax just
[2:09:10.800 --> 2:09:16.200]  to get us under lockdown, that when they release the real one and the deaths incredibly spike,
[2:09:16.200 --> 2:09:20.080]  that they're going to blame him, that they're going to do that regardless. The way to expose
[2:09:20.080 --> 2:09:25.160]  it is to go in and bring out the information about the Wuhan lab, about the chai comms,
[2:09:25.160 --> 2:09:30.560]  about Obama and Fauci and Gates 2015 transferring it over there. Don't just expose it as a Chinese
[2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:34.320]  virus, expose it as a globalist virus, a UN virus. And then they won't be able to continue
[2:09:34.320 --> 2:09:39.760]  to do that because they'll have to back down. But Trump took the middle road, I guess from
[2:09:39.760 --> 2:09:44.680]  his advisors, just a week ago, he was doing the right thing, exposing them and getting
[2:09:44.680 --> 2:09:49.080]  into the fraud and getting into the false testing and the rest of it. But now he has
[2:09:49.080 --> 2:09:55.000]  reversed that. And it's a, it's a scary situation. I don't think Trump's a bad guy. I still
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:59.560]  support him. But I know our listeners are very, very upset. Our readers are very, very
[2:09:59.560 --> 2:10:04.520]  upset. I'm very, very concerned. And so we really have to understand the fact that Trump
[2:10:04.520 --> 2:10:08.200]  can't do it all. We're going to have to do it. And he sees America capitulating. He
[2:10:08.200 --> 2:10:12.960]  sees Texas capitulating. That's why I was still worried about the governor capitulating
[2:10:12.960 --> 2:10:17.440]  in Texas and becoming a footstool of the UN and Gavin Newsom and the UN and the whole
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:23.000]  New World Order situation and Fauci. And so now it's happened. And it's just a total
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:27.400]  absolute complete crisis. And it's up to all of us, up to all of us to decide whether we're
[2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:30.920]  going to be a freer slaves because this is just the beginning. COVID-19 is the agenda
[2:10:30.920 --> 2:10:36.720]  for the total post human technocracy, globalist takeover in their own words. Back in the day
[2:10:36.720 --> 2:10:39.600]  of the nine live transmission broadcasting worldwide. God bless you all. You are the
[2:10:39.600 --> 2:10:43.760]  Paul Revere's without you. We have no chance. I'm not trying to scare everybody. It's laying
[2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:48.360]  the facts out. The good news is I am seeing a giant awakening, but people aren't speaking
[2:10:48.360 --> 2:10:51.760]  up that are awake. They're just sitting there and taking it. It's not enough to be awake.
[2:10:51.760 --> 2:10:55.760]  You have to take action with the knowledge. Paul Revere didn't just see the British Red
[2:10:55.760 --> 2:11:02.880]  Cubs coming. He had to make that ride and raise the alarm and say, no, I'd like to call
[2:11:02.880 --> 2:11:07.520]  to order this secret conclave of America's media empires. We're here to come up with
[2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:12.200]  the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong in dark rooms, glued
[2:11:12.200 --> 2:11:16.600]  to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials. Well, I think NBC you are
[2:11:16.600 --> 2:11:21.600]  here to listen and not speak. I think we should go with a good old fashioned public health
[2:11:21.600 --> 2:11:27.360]  care. Yeah. A new disease. No one's immune. It's like the summer of the shark except instead
[2:11:27.360 --> 2:11:32.840]  of a shark. It's an epidemic and instead of summer, it's all the time. Now I hate to be
[2:11:32.840 --> 2:11:38.560]  the guy who derails what everybody else loves. He loves being that guy. But Janice, we do
[2:11:38.560 --> 2:11:44.400]  have standards. This can't be a made up disease. The only moral thing to do is release a deadly
[2:11:44.400 --> 2:11:48.880]  virus into the general public. We do have something we've been holding on to, but it
[2:11:48.880 --> 2:11:59.320]  hasn't been tested. Get over here, NBC. We certainly believe in testing, but I oh, wow.
[2:11:59.320 --> 2:12:05.680]  Wow. Oh, yeah. So we've got our deadly disease. No, we just have to blame it on something
[2:12:05.680 --> 2:12:11.080]  that's in every household, something that people are a little bit afraid of already.
[2:12:11.080 --> 2:12:15.360]  House cat flu is coming, people. The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some
[2:12:15.360 --> 2:12:19.880]  degree of probability that the house cat flu might spread in the following hypothetical
[2:12:19.880 --> 2:12:25.960]  outbreak pattern. So better be aware that warm body on your lap just might be ready
[2:12:25.960 --> 2:12:37.120]  to destroy your tender vitals. Springfielders are advised to stay tuned for more information
[2:12:37.120 --> 2:12:41.960]  if they experience any of the following symptoms. Mild thirst, occasional hunger, tiredness
[2:12:41.960 --> 2:12:53.240]  at night. And again, it's looking exactly like a Simpsons episode. Whenever we do a
[2:12:53.240 --> 2:12:59.080]  Simpsons episode, we have the Babylon Bee. It doesn't take very long for the pseudo reality
[2:12:59.080 --> 2:13:06.760]  that's been created for us by Fauci and others to catch up and to surpass that. We have Fauci
[2:13:06.760 --> 2:13:12.160]  holding court again, saying, you know, we're living right now through a historic pandemic
[2:13:12.160 --> 2:13:18.840]  outbreak right now situation. We do not see any particular end in sight, right? It's the
[2:13:18.840 --> 2:13:26.400]  perfect storm. You're a worst nightmare. It is our worst nightmare. And his dream come
[2:13:26.400 --> 2:13:32.280]  true. He says, I've never seen an infection in which it has such a broad range, literally
[2:13:32.280 --> 2:13:37.600]  nothing, namely no symptoms at all, all the way to people who we pull out of the nursing
[2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:42.080]  home, we put them in the hospital, stick them on a ventilator and they die. Yeah, imagine
[2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:48.560]  that. Imagine that if you use a PCR test, which was not intended for that purpose, imagine
[2:13:48.560 --> 2:13:54.040]  if you use a test which identifies people with any kind of cold to have that. And imagine
[2:13:54.040 --> 2:14:00.520]  if you withhold treatment from them. You know, you heard in that little puff piece that was
[2:14:00.520 --> 2:14:09.520]  done for Bill Gates. He said, well, you know, thank you so much, Bill, for the we're looking
[2:14:09.520 --> 2:14:14.800]  for a cure. Well, vaccines not a cure, right? Vaccines don't cure you. They don't even
[2:14:14.800 --> 2:14:18.880]  claim they cure you. They claim that they prevent you from getting the disease. It doesn't
[2:14:18.880 --> 2:14:24.000]  cure you once you have the disease. And they want to shut down any discussion at all of
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:30.120]  anything that is a proven cure, especially if it's cheap. You heard when Trump was talking
[2:14:30.120 --> 2:14:34.560]  to that Fox doctor that was sent down, because again, they have to do a segment. It was it
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:41.800]  was sad to see the embarrassed look on Tucker's face when he had to throw to that package.
[2:14:41.800 --> 2:14:48.560]  It was a shameful piece of big pharma propaganda done by a Fox doctor and President Trump pushing
[2:14:48.560 --> 2:14:55.760]  vaccines, pushing remdesivir. This is a failed drug by Gilead Pharmaceutical that Fauci has
[2:14:55.760 --> 2:15:01.520]  pushed for the Ebola outbreak. He pushed it before that for AIDS. And it was never proven.
[2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:07.600]  And as a matter of fact, they had some tests for this particular thing for COVID-19 in
[2:15:07.600 --> 2:15:12.160]  China. They showed that it was absolutely ineffective. They had more people die that
[2:15:12.160 --> 2:15:16.880]  they gave to it and survived. And they pulled that down after just a couple of hours being
[2:15:16.880 --> 2:15:22.680]  up on the WHO, that Chinese study. And a week later, Fauci releases a non reviewed study
[2:15:22.680 --> 2:15:29.640]  that shows a slight, a slight advantage for it. And they pronounces this is now the new
[2:15:29.640 --> 2:15:36.600]  standard remdesivir. And I've got Trump saying that as well, because they don't want you
[2:15:36.600 --> 2:15:44.480]  to take simple, safe, effective and affordable non patented things to cure. They're literally
[2:15:44.480 --> 2:15:54.680]  killing people. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:15:54.680 --> 2:15:58.960]  This is a Corona crisis self reliance alert. If you're worried about the power grid and
[2:15:58.960 --> 2:16:03.480]  the current crisis and want to generate your own supply of off the grid electrical power,
[2:16:03.480 --> 2:16:08.960]  just in case, pay close attention. Here's why a limited supply of solar backup generators
[2:16:08.960 --> 2:16:14.040]  will be available again in the next two weeks. These emergency backup systems provide life
[2:16:14.040 --> 2:16:19.800]  saving electrical backup power when you get off the grid. And unlike gas generators, these
[2:16:19.800 --> 2:16:25.680]  solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes and produce an endless supply of free electricity
[2:16:25.680 --> 2:16:31.520]  from the sun. Dangerous weather, social unrest or overloaded grids this summer will not be
[2:16:31.520 --> 2:16:36.880]  a problem if you go to my solar backup dot com and get your solar backup generator. We
[2:16:36.880 --> 2:16:42.200]  regret that supplies are limited and only available on a first come first serve basis.
[2:16:42.200 --> 2:16:47.680]  Check availability at my solar backup dot com. Never suffer painful power outages again.
[2:16:47.680 --> 2:16:53.640]  Go to my solar backup dot com. That's my solar backup dot com.
[2:16:53.640 --> 2:16:58.000]  This is a pandemic survival alert and the most time sensitive messages you will hear
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:03.080]  this year. You still have time to plan a one acre crisis garden and secure a supply of your
[2:17:03.080 --> 2:17:07.640]  own nutrient dense food. But time is running out and it's one deadline you don't want
[2:17:07.640 --> 2:17:12.400]  to miss. Who should plan a crisis garden? Individuals, families, churches, communities,
[2:17:12.400 --> 2:17:17.280]  anyone or any group that sees hard times ahead. Let's face it, even the mainline media is
[2:17:17.280 --> 2:17:21.040]  talking about food supply disruptions and the growing number of grocery store workers
[2:17:21.040 --> 2:17:25.560]  who are becoming sick. But there's more meat packing plans are closing mile long lines
[2:17:25.560 --> 2:17:31.160]  at food pantries and more farmers now in financial trouble. The truth is growing nutrient dense
[2:17:31.160 --> 2:17:37.160]  vegetables this summer may be the single most important thing you do. Go to survivalseedbank.com

[2:18:24.600 --> 2:18:28.920]  globalists have already created a worldwide depression lockdowns on the planetary scale
[2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:33.560]  and it's only intensifying. This is one of the big boxes. You've got to get checked off

[2:19:57.960 --> 2:20:25.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Welcome back. This is David Knight and on my program
[2:20:25.400 --> 2:20:33.680]  in the morning, I had Al Waddell on. He's a pastor in Montana. I've talked to a lot
[2:20:33.680 --> 2:20:40.360]  of different pastors because I think the key to all of this is we have to have leaders
[2:20:40.360 --> 2:20:46.720]  at the local community level. I think the solution to what is going on in these various
[2:20:46.720 --> 2:20:53.080]  places is not for President Trump to use the military, not for them to nationalize a police
[2:20:53.080 --> 2:20:59.240]  force even further. And I think the solution is that we have constitutional sheriffs that
[2:20:59.240 --> 2:21:03.400]  we have law enforcement officers who take their oath to the Constitution seriously, but I
[2:21:03.400 --> 2:21:09.160]  think it's also important that we have pastors who will lead people and not allow them to
[2:21:09.160 --> 2:21:14.680]  be gaslighted to say that they have to obey orders that are not constitutional because
[2:21:14.680 --> 2:21:20.800]  the Constitution is the real authority in this country, not a temporarily elected politician.
[2:21:20.800 --> 2:21:26.000]  So I want to see a grassroots, a ground up response to this. We need to start rebuilding
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:32.400]  our communities rather than continually looking to Washington for solutions. That is doomed
[2:21:32.400 --> 2:21:36.800]  to failure. That is what has gotten us to the position that we're in right now. Our
[2:21:36.800 --> 2:21:43.720]  passivity, our voyeurism, our delegation of our own responsibilities to other people
[2:21:43.720 --> 2:21:48.960]  is what has been destroying our individual liberty. And so I talked to a lot of different
[2:21:48.960 --> 2:21:53.960]  pastors and I wanted to get on Al Waddell again. Thank you for joining us, Al. Tell
[2:21:53.960 --> 2:21:56.360]  us what's going on in Montana.
[2:21:56.360 --> 2:22:04.880]  Well, the governor of course about five days ago or six days ago issued an order mandating
[2:22:04.880 --> 2:22:11.960]  that all places of business require a mask. Now, what most places don't realize is because
[2:22:11.960 --> 2:22:20.040]  they haven't even read the mandate or the order, there are numerous exceptions to his
[2:22:20.040 --> 2:22:29.120]  order. I think there are nine of them. And the last exception is that if you have a medical
[2:22:29.120 --> 2:22:34.360]  condition that you can't wear a mask, you're exempted. But you might just as well try to
[2:22:34.360 --> 2:22:41.440]  shovel feathers and a wind to explain that to somebody who's business because, you know,
[2:22:41.440 --> 2:22:47.680]  you can present as much evidence as you want and they just don't, they don't get it.
[2:22:47.680 --> 2:22:51.680]  That's right. That's right. And we've witnessed that as well. And it is kind of a gradually
[2:22:51.680 --> 2:22:57.800]  escalating thing because when Abbott here in Texas started doing that, they started carving
[2:22:57.800 --> 2:23:01.800]  out a few exceptions like you're talking about for your health and so forth. And yet when
[2:23:01.800 --> 2:23:06.200]  you go to Costco, for example, my wife goes there says, I can't wear it because of health.
[2:23:06.200 --> 2:23:09.160]  Well, what is your health issue? It's like, it's none of your business. What my health
[2:23:09.160 --> 2:23:14.920]  issue is. And then it gets to the next stage, which I've had employees of airlines contact
[2:23:14.920 --> 2:23:19.920]  me and say, particularly Delta, they said, well, now Delta is going to tell passengers
[2:23:19.920 --> 2:23:23.360]  who say they have a medical condition and they can't do this. They're going to have
[2:23:23.360 --> 2:23:29.480]  to get on the phone with a subcontractor of ours who is going to do a medical diagnosis
[2:23:29.480 --> 2:23:33.000]  over the phone to see whether they're going to do an interview with you and see whether
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:37.280]  or not they believe that you've got a health condition that should exempt you from wearing
[2:23:37.280 --> 2:23:41.200]  a mask. This is the way it progresses. And then it gets to the point where it's like,
[2:23:41.200 --> 2:23:44.720]  no, everybody's going to wear it. We don't really care what your health issues are.
[2:23:44.720 --> 2:23:53.960]  Yes, David, that's exactly correct. And when I go out, I would say that about 90% of the
[2:23:53.960 --> 2:23:58.760]  people that I see walking around, not even in a store, are now wearing a mask.
[2:23:58.760 --> 2:24:04.880]  Yes. And as you're talking, I know you're not, we've got an audio feed on you as you're
[2:24:04.880 --> 2:24:09.840]  talking. They're running some video feed of encounters that people have shown where they
[2:24:09.840 --> 2:24:14.600]  go into a store and the customers there are so gaslighted by all this that not only do
[2:24:14.600 --> 2:24:18.520]  they have masks on, but you've got customers who are ramming their shopping carts into another
[2:24:18.520 --> 2:24:22.800]  one because she doesn't have a mask on. They're getting physically violent with people.
[2:24:22.800 --> 2:24:28.000]  That's right. I wrote a letter to the government and I told them, I said, what you've done,
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:33.760]  you have turned Montanans against each other. And of course, that's the plan. The plan is
[2:24:33.760 --> 2:24:37.800]  not to use the police. The plan is to use your next door neighbor.
[2:24:37.800 --> 2:24:43.560]  That's right. Your next door neighbor to make sure that you're not able to go into any retail
[2:24:43.560 --> 2:24:47.800]  spaces because these national retailers control and own everything. It's the same thing they
[2:24:47.800 --> 2:24:53.200]  did on the internet, on social media. Now they're rolling that out to the physical spaces
[2:24:53.200 --> 2:24:56.880]  that they now control. They say, well, we own it. We own everything in America. And so
[2:24:56.880 --> 2:24:59.600]  now you're going to do what we have to say. I mean, this is the way this is rolling out
[2:24:59.600 --> 2:25:06.760]  at this point, isn't it? Yes. To speak to what you just said about
[2:25:06.760 --> 2:25:13.040]  the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and what people should be concentrating on here.
[2:25:13.040 --> 2:25:20.400]  When I go out, I take with me the Constitution in my pocket. I take with me the governor's
[2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:28.160]  order Xeroxed. And when I had the opportunity, I use that and say, look, read this. This
[2:25:28.160 --> 2:25:35.200]  is what it says. And then I try to explain as best I can as a testimony to them what
[2:25:35.200 --> 2:25:42.160]  the truth is. And we talked a little bit about this in the last interview that you had with
[2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:52.720]  me. It's up to the people that are, people like pastors and preachers, to explain this
[2:25:52.720 --> 2:25:59.920]  to their people. Yes. I think back to Moses Mather, who was a New England, he came from
[2:25:59.920 --> 2:26:07.680]  a New England family of preachers, graduated from Yale in 1739. And he published a sermon
[2:26:07.680 --> 2:26:14.840]  called America's Appeal to the Impartial World. And he wrote this. He said, the English to
[2:26:14.840 --> 2:26:23.000]  their immortal honor claimed unalienable rights and to transmit them to posterity, cause them
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:28.560]  to be reduced to writing, and in the most solemn manner to be confirmed by King John
[2:26:28.560 --> 2:26:33.720]  at Westminster Hall, where Magna Carta was read in the presence of bishops with lighted
[2:26:33.720 --> 2:26:40.280]  candles in their hands. The King all the while laying his hand on his breast, swearing faithfully
[2:26:40.280 --> 2:26:46.520]  to observe all things therein contained, as he was a man, Christian, a soldier, and a
[2:26:46.520 --> 2:26:52.280]  king. Then I listened to this. The bishops extinguished the candles and threw them on
[2:26:52.280 --> 2:26:59.480]  the ground. And everyone said, thus let him be extinguished and stink in hell, who violates
[2:26:59.480 --> 2:27:07.000]  this great charter of liberty. Wow. Wow. Yeah. And that exactly that is that established
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:11.960]  the principle that the King was not above the law. And yet you're not going to be able
[2:27:11.960 --> 2:27:17.480]  to get across any of these college, quote unquote, educated people today. They don't
[2:27:17.480 --> 2:27:22.360]  want to hear anything about history or about the rule of law. For them, if you disagree
[2:27:22.360 --> 2:27:27.680]  with them, you have to be purged out of existence. All of them have become little petty absolute
[2:27:27.680 --> 2:27:35.320]  monarchs, haven't they? Yes, they have. And these little monarchs and the greater monarchs,
[2:27:35.320 --> 2:27:42.440]  which makes me think of, have you ever heard of the Magdeburg Confession? No, I haven't.
[2:27:42.440 --> 2:27:50.160]  Well, in 968, the Archbishop, a brick of Magdeburg, Germany, was established as a Roman Catholic
[2:27:50.160 --> 2:27:56.160]  principality and the senior Catholic prophet. They are ruled the town and all the lands
[2:27:56.160 --> 2:28:05.280]  around it in every manner, worldly and spiritual or under his control. So then along come
[2:28:05.280 --> 2:28:12.160]  to Protestant Reformation and the citizens of Magdeburg turned Protestant. And one of
[2:28:12.160 --> 2:28:18.720]  the results was that Magdeburg citizens then refused to obey the order to pay taxes to the
[2:28:18.720 --> 2:28:28.040]  Catholic emperor Charles V. And that got the city attacked. And just prior to the city
[2:28:28.040 --> 2:28:35.560]  entering a 13 month siege by the emperor, the Reformation pastors of Magdeburg wrote
[2:28:35.560 --> 2:28:38.560]  and signed what was called the Magdeburg Confession.
[2:28:38.560 --> 2:28:41.960]  All right, we gotta take a break and we'll get that Magdeburg Confession when we come
[2:28:41.960 --> 2:28:46.480]  back. We're talking to Al Waddell. And we're also going to talk about a very interesting
[2:28:46.480 --> 2:28:52.040]  story he has about the attack on Pearl Harbor. We talked to someone who was involved on the
[2:28:52.040 --> 2:28:54.280]  Japanese side of that. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:28:54.280 --> 2:28:58.160]  Attention gardeners, if you need to grow nutritionally dense vegetables or medicinal herbs this

[2:31:09.480 --> 2:31:13.160]  at the entrance of the village so we would know if predators or criminals were coming.
[2:31:13.160 --> 2:31:18.080]  Well, big tech, along with the federal government and other globalist organizations, have been
[2:31:18.080 --> 2:31:22.680]  tracking everybody illegally for years with their cell phones. But now, the public is
[2:31:22.680 --> 2:31:27.680]  finally waking up because the enemy has openly announced it's the fact. And the Clinton Foundation,
[2:31:27.680 --> 2:31:31.520]  Global Initiative with Chelsea, is running the private system to spy on you and your
[2:31:31.520 --> 2:31:36.280]  family. That's right. The Democrats, the globalists, the chai comms, they've all got our number.
[2:31:36.280 --> 2:31:41.520]  They're tracking us in lifetime. But with Privacy Pockets, the best system at InfoWarsStore.com,
[2:31:41.520 --> 2:31:46.080]  you can protect yourself and your family by keeping your cell phone inside of the little
[2:31:46.080 --> 2:31:50.120]  pouch. We're selling more of these in a day than we used to sell in a month because American
[2:31:50.120 --> 2:31:54.400]  and the world is waking up. Get yours at InfoWarsStore.com and go stealth.
[2:31:54.400 --> 2:32:03.880]  It's the end of the world as we know it. It's the end of the world as we know it. It's
[2:32:03.880 --> 2:32:14.000]  the end of the world as we know it. It's the end of the world as we know it. And I don't
[2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:21.960]  feel fun. This entire takeover has been battle planned, blueprinted, war-gamed, field-martialed
[2:32:21.960 --> 2:32:27.800]  by the psychological war chiefs at the United Nations and the Fortune 100. This is the post-human
[2:32:27.800 --> 2:32:34.960]  takeover. The news gets tighter when you comply, not looser. The entire COVID-19 operation
[2:32:34.960 --> 2:32:39.520]  is a hoax. Now they admit the, quote, death numbers are dropping because those are fake
[2:32:39.520 --> 2:32:43.000]  where they count people that died of something else. But it's all about how many cases there
[2:32:43.000 --> 2:32:48.480]  are. And now they're saying most of the population will get it. And then no one can go outside
[2:32:48.480 --> 2:33:00.640]  ever again. It's totally insane. It's a fraud. It's all a lie.
[2:33:18.480 --> 2:33:25.600]  Welcome back. You know, human nature doesn't change. Some of the reasons why it's so important
[2:33:25.600 --> 2:33:30.600]  to look at history and learn lessons from history. Because human nature doesn't change
[2:33:30.600 --> 2:33:37.880]  even though we are faced with weapons that mankind has never seen before. It's all the
[2:33:37.880 --> 2:33:43.200]  more important for us to understand the nature of power, how it corrupts, and human nature.
[2:33:43.200 --> 2:33:51.400]  And that's why I believe that it is imperative for pastors to take the lead and to educate
[2:33:51.400 --> 2:33:58.400]  the people that are around them as to the kinds of threats that they're about to face.
[2:33:58.400 --> 2:34:02.240]  And to understand how to deal with these threats. I mean, it's the same, you know, what we're
[2:34:02.240 --> 2:34:09.040]  talking about here in terms of an educational standpoint is as imperative as defending life
[2:34:09.040 --> 2:34:15.040]  if somebody were to come into your group with a firearm and to start shooting people. I
[2:34:15.040 --> 2:34:23.200]  mean, you have to be able to defend the principles that are now under attack with all kinds of
[2:34:23.200 --> 2:34:28.240]  weapons. And we were just talking to Al Waddell and we had to interrupt what he was having
[2:34:28.240 --> 2:34:31.960]  to say with a commercial break. You were talking about the Magdenburg Confession. And I want
[2:34:31.960 --> 2:34:37.800]  to get into that as well. I know exactly what you're talking about. But people need to understand
[2:34:37.800 --> 2:34:47.000]  how in centuries past, political power was concentrated into the hands of a local ruling
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:53.000]  official, typically in a city. And many times that throughout Europe, that political power
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:58.800]  was also a coincident with religious power. I think as you're talking about this, Al,
[2:34:58.800 --> 2:35:03.600]  I think about Salzburg when I went there with my family. There's a very famous palace there
[2:35:03.600 --> 2:35:08.840]  that everybody who has seen the sound of music that pretty much everybody has. The beautiful
[2:35:08.840 --> 2:35:13.520]  palace there called Mirabelle Palace. They have gardens there that's where Julie Andrews
[2:35:13.520 --> 2:35:18.640]  and the kids were playing in the clothes that she made out of curtains and so forth, right?
[2:35:18.640 --> 2:35:29.240]  And that was a palace that was built by the Catholic Church official who essentially controlled
[2:35:29.240 --> 2:35:34.640]  that city. It was a very wealthy city because they had salt mines. That's why it was called
[2:35:34.640 --> 2:35:40.160]  Salzburg. And that was a very valuable commodity in those days. And so you'd have people who
[2:35:40.160 --> 2:35:46.560]  worked in the salt mines and they would pay taxes to this official. And he, although he
[2:35:46.560 --> 2:35:52.960]  was supposed to be celibate, he was not very discreet about his affair with his mistress.
[2:35:52.960 --> 2:35:58.920]  As a matter of fact, it was for his mistress that he built that phenomenal Mirabelle Palace.
[2:35:58.920 --> 2:36:06.760]  And I was, I had the privilege to attend a concert there in the Marble Hall concert area.
[2:36:06.760 --> 2:36:13.600]  But tell us about what happened in Magdeburg as part of that confession, Al. Go ahead
[2:36:13.600 --> 2:36:15.600]  and continue your story.
[2:36:15.600 --> 2:36:24.000]  Okay. Before I do that, just one clarification here. I am no longer a pastor. I've pastured
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:31.600]  big churches and small churches. I'm retired now and I'm a preacher. Since I started, I'm
[2:36:31.600 --> 2:36:37.200]  a preacher. Just to clarify that. Okay. Okay. Now back to the confession.
[2:36:37.200 --> 2:36:41.120]  Preach it, Al. You got the floor. Go ahead and preach it.
[2:36:41.120 --> 2:36:45.480]  All right. In fact, most of my churches, they never called me pastor. They would call me
[2:36:45.480 --> 2:36:46.480]  preacher.
[2:36:46.480 --> 2:36:47.480]  That's good.
[2:36:47.480 --> 2:36:53.400]  As they referred to me, a preacher. Anyway, the confession is extremely important because
[2:36:53.400 --> 2:37:00.240]  it sets forth in a doctrinal format what later came to be known as the, this is the important
[2:37:00.240 --> 2:37:05.720]  part of this, the doctrine of the lesser magistrate.
[2:37:05.720 --> 2:37:10.680]  The lesser magistrate doctrine declares that when the higher or superior authority makes
[2:37:10.680 --> 2:37:18.840]  them unjust or immoral law or decree, the lower or lesser magistrate has both a right
[2:37:18.840 --> 2:37:29.720]  and duty to, to refuse obedience to the superior authority. And if necessary, that lesser authority
[2:37:29.720 --> 2:37:36.960]  even has the right, even the obligation to actually resist and oppose the superior authority.
[2:37:36.960 --> 2:37:44.920]  Now, I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about. When I was a pastor in Tucson,
[2:37:44.920 --> 2:37:57.640]  the federal government came after me and charged me with the violation of machine gun, having
[2:37:57.640 --> 2:38:03.920]  an unregistered machine gun, which I didn't have, but that's the story they made up.
[2:38:03.920 --> 2:38:13.680]  So the lesser authority is the state of Arizona. And the state of Arizona had no rules, regulations
[2:38:13.680 --> 2:38:21.720]  or anything regulating the own ownership of a machine gun. So at that point, the state
[2:38:21.720 --> 2:38:26.680]  of Arizona being a lesser authority should have stepped in and reprimanded the higher
[2:38:26.680 --> 2:38:30.720]  authority, the federal government said, get out of our backyard.
[2:38:30.720 --> 2:38:31.720]  Yes.
[2:38:31.720 --> 2:38:38.800]  Now, and, and, and of course, I know you know this because you've told it all the time.
[2:38:38.800 --> 2:38:45.160]  Well, article one, section eight of the Constitution, you can't find anything in that article that
[2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:50.600]  says the federal government has any right whatsoever to legislate in the area of firearm
[2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:56.960]  and a whole bunch of other things. So that, and just so that you get it, not you, but
[2:38:56.960 --> 2:39:04.080]  the royal you out there, they put amendments to the Constitution and said, just so you're
[2:39:04.080 --> 2:39:10.680]  clear on this. Here's the second amendment. So this lesser authority, the state of Arizona
[2:39:10.680 --> 2:39:20.360]  should have stepped in. There are other things to say about that, but they, they have a duty
[2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:27.400]  to do this. And so these reformation pastors declared that the idea of unlimited submission
[2:39:27.400 --> 2:39:31.760]  to the state was an invention of the devil.
[2:39:31.760 --> 2:39:37.000]  And they rightly asserted that, that all authority is delegated from God. And that being the
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:43.120]  case, if, if the one in authority makes commands contrary to the law of God or the word of God,
[2:39:43.120 --> 2:39:50.680]  those subject to his authority have a right not to obey and a duty to actively resist.
[2:39:50.680 --> 2:39:57.680]  And those pastors, I'll give you an example of what those pastors actually said on this
[2:39:57.680 --> 2:40:05.240]  business of unlimited submission and the, and lesser right quote, let us take an example
[2:40:05.240 --> 2:40:11.600]  concerning a father of a family. If he should come to his wife or grown daughters in his
[2:40:11.600 --> 2:40:19.720]  house with some scoundrels in an obvious attempt to prostitute them, then his wife and daughters
[2:40:19.720 --> 2:40:27.040]  not only would not render their husband and father the obedience they otherwise owe him,
[2:40:27.040 --> 2:40:33.560]  but when they are not able to preserve their chastity in any other way, they should drive
[2:40:33.560 --> 2:40:35.720]  him off with stones.
[2:40:35.720 --> 2:40:41.760]  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And when we look at this, you know, we talk about different spheres
[2:40:41.760 --> 2:40:47.800]  of authority. And I think people understand that when you have a situation, you have a
[2:40:47.800 --> 2:40:55.120]  physically abusive father, then it is up to some other jurisdiction, let's say the local
[2:40:55.120 --> 2:41:00.120]  government to come in and intervene in that situation. And under that same principle,
[2:41:00.120 --> 2:41:06.520]  you know, we have other spheres of authority that are where you have that penetration.
[2:41:06.520 --> 2:41:13.040]  But that's, you know, once somebody begins to act in an evil manner or abusive manner,
[2:41:13.040 --> 2:41:17.600]  then you have broken that authority. That's a basic principle. And so that goes back to
[2:41:17.600 --> 2:41:22.400]  the actions that are being done by the civil authorities. And it's even underscored by
[2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:26.960]  the fact that civil authorities are themselves under the Constitution. So they're not only
[2:41:26.960 --> 2:41:31.480]  acting evil, but they're acting in a way that is in direct violation of the Constitution
[2:41:31.480 --> 2:41:36.600]  when they impose these types of regulations on us under the presumption of protecting
[2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:41.840]  us for our own good from this mysterious disease.
[2:41:41.840 --> 2:41:48.880]  That's right. They have no authority in that area. I mean, let somebody step forward and
[2:41:48.880 --> 2:41:56.480]  say, tell me where in the Constitution a medical man can come forward and start obligating
[2:41:56.480 --> 2:42:03.040]  rules and regulations for how you live. Those pastors that I was talking about in the, during
[2:42:03.040 --> 2:42:10.560]  the Reformation, they made their point that no one, not one person, no one in authority,
[2:42:10.560 --> 2:42:17.480]  whether in family church or civil government, holds his authority autonomously. It's designated
[2:42:17.480 --> 2:42:24.840]  and delegated to them from God. And if the authority therefore makes the law, makes law,
[2:42:24.840 --> 2:42:30.560]  which contravenes the law of God, those subject to that authority can refuse obedience because
[2:42:30.560 --> 2:42:31.560]  as they say...
[2:42:31.560 --> 2:42:34.200]  And we're gonna have to talk more about that. I'm gonna have to get you on the morning show
[2:42:34.200 --> 2:42:39.280]  to finish that up because that is a key issue. We're gonna have to address the tactics that
[2:42:39.280 --> 2:42:43.600]  they're using to push this out through corporations as well. Al Waddell, thank you so much for
[2:42:43.600 --> 2:42:48.200]  joining us, folks. Before we go to break, we're gonna have Nick Begich taking over the fourth
[2:42:48.200 --> 2:42:53.960]  hour, earthalts.com. But just don't remind you about the products that we have in infowarstore.com.

[2:43:54.200 --> 2:43:59.120]  It's Christmas in July. We ran the sale last year. It was very, very popular. And so I
[2:43:59.120 --> 2:44:04.000]  am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:09.440]  year. And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt
[2:44:09.440 --> 2:44:16.120]  of 2020. It's the American Eagle boldly spreading its wings, sitting atop a Betsy Ross Clang.
[2:44:16.120 --> 2:44:22.120]  And the shirts are on sale right now at infowarstore.com. I got the idea for the Trump campaign, having
[2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:26.800]  a similar shirt to be called Nancy, which of course it isn't. And since it's so triggering
[2:44:26.800 --> 2:44:29.760]  to the leftist and the globalist, well, we're going to make sure it's even more of these
[2:44:29.760 --> 2:44:34.360]  shirts on the streets to spread the word and exercise our First Amendment in the face of
[2:44:34.360 --> 2:44:39.320]  these tyrants. We also have store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points. So whatever
[2:44:39.320 --> 2:44:43.560]  great item it is that you want, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points on your
[2:44:43.560 --> 2:44:48.160]  next order, and at least 50% off across the board. Now, I'm going to have to end this
[2:44:48.160 --> 2:44:51.320]  sale very, very soon because all these products are about to sell out and take advantage of
[2:44:51.320 --> 2:44:55.440]  it right now at infowarstore.com.
[2:44:55.440 --> 2:44:59.040]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years. And if you go back to those
[2:44:59.040 --> 2:45:05.960]  shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master
[2:45:05.960 --> 2:45:11.960]  computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict large
[2:45:11.960 --> 2:45:16.120]  groups of human movements and activities, but even predict what individuals would do.
[2:45:16.120 --> 2:45:20.920]  And then once you could predict what individuals were going to be doing, you could add stimuli
[2:45:20.920 --> 2:45:26.800]  through the AI systems, through the computers, through digital billboards, through face scanning,
[2:45:26.800 --> 2:45:31.080]  through the social credit score to control people and make them act like you wanted to.
[2:45:31.080 --> 2:45:35.560]  But when we covered that, the media would attack us and say, we were making it up. It
[2:45:35.560 --> 2:45:40.520]  was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents.
[2:45:40.520 --> 2:45:45.120]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this
[2:45:45.120 --> 2:45:50.200]  control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out. And it's something about a thousand
[2:45:50.200 --> 2:45:55.440]  times crazier than what Hitler planned. So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[2:45:55.440 --> 2:46:02.520]  We are selling more privacy pockets a day than we were previously selling in a month
[2:46:02.520 --> 2:46:06.520]  because of the Clinton Foundation running the contact tracing and admittedly with Google
[2:46:06.520 --> 2:46:10.320]  and Apple tracking all Americans on their phones, even if you opt out of it or get rid
[2:46:10.320 --> 2:46:15.280]  of the apps. People realize these criminal groups are surveilling you and selling your
[2:46:15.280 --> 2:46:20.400]  data and using it to control your life, sharing it with antifuzz, sharing it with Black Lives
[2:46:20.400 --> 2:46:24.800]  Matter, sharing it with the deep state to oppress not just high profile people, but
[2:46:24.800 --> 2:46:29.320]  the general public. That's why folks are taking back control of their lives with these little
[2:46:29.320 --> 2:46:34.880]  Faraday cages that you can put your cell phones in that knock out the ability of the cell towers
[2:46:34.880 --> 2:46:39.560]  to ping it every few seconds and track your location. This is the only way to have your
[2:46:39.560 --> 2:46:44.080]  privacy and people are taking their privacy back. It's very, very exciting. They're at
[2:46:44.080 --> 2:46:50.080]  $19.95 apiece at infowarstore.com. We've ordered even more huge shipments coming in next week,
[2:46:50.080 --> 2:46:57.080]  so get yours now and be part of the movement to cut Big Brother off.
[2:47:20.080 --> 2:47:26.880]  All right, welcome back. We've got one more segment and I was a bit confused to apologize
[2:47:26.880 --> 2:47:31.680]  to the listeners and to Al because I thought we were at the very end of the show. I let
[2:47:31.680 --> 2:47:37.200]  Al go too late for us to get him back. I was packing up and Daria said, hey, you got one
[2:47:37.200 --> 2:47:42.240]  more segment here. It's like, oh, okay, that's great. I got news to tell you, but I did really
[2:47:42.240 --> 2:47:47.120]  want to allow Al to finish that. We will have him finish that on the morning show, by the
[2:47:47.120 --> 2:47:53.480]  way, and my morning show runs the three hours before this one begins. You can find me on
[2:47:53.480 --> 2:47:58.480]  Twitter, by the way, at Liberty Terrain, also on Parlor, because I know that my Twitter
[2:47:58.480 --> 2:48:05.760]  days are numbered. And they have shown me that in every way possible that they're going
[2:48:05.760 --> 2:48:09.360]  to be kicking me off of Twitter. So you can also find me on Parlor. And if you want to
[2:48:09.360 --> 2:48:14.360]  communicate with me, if you want to give me, if you want to throw bricks at me or flowers
[2:48:14.360 --> 2:48:18.760]  either way, or if you have some, most importantly, if you have some news that you want to pass
[2:48:18.760 --> 2:48:22.160]  on to me that you think is important, you can email me. The best way to get ahold of
[2:48:22.160 --> 2:48:28.600]  me is David Knight Show at protonmail.com. That has a little bit of privacy. Of course,
[2:48:28.600 --> 2:48:33.920]  nothing, that's encoded, but of course, nothing is private if the government wants to intrude
[2:48:33.920 --> 2:48:40.880]  on your privacy. Before we went to Al, I was going to talk about, we ran out of time in
[2:48:40.880 --> 2:48:48.400]  that segment. I was going to talk about the fact that the mainstream media, especially
[2:48:48.400 --> 2:48:56.760]  CNN, does not want you to know about a cure. And you saw the interview of Bill Gates. And
[2:48:56.760 --> 2:49:02.320]  you know, he was a tough interview there. Oh, well, you know, I hope we get that vaccine
[2:49:02.320 --> 2:49:06.160]  cure pretty soon. Well, it's not going to be a cure. That's going to be your passport
[2:49:06.160 --> 2:49:12.760]  to travel. There's a cobear interviewing him. Oh, thank you so much, your majesty, for the
[2:49:12.760 --> 2:49:18.360]  cure that you're working on. And, you know, he's described as a philanthropist, and he
[2:49:18.360 --> 2:49:26.000]  said that he's going to give $100 million to help produce a vaccine. That will be simply
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:32.640]  a drop in the bucket compared to not only his wealth, but also to what Operation Warp
[2:49:32.640 --> 2:49:38.560]  Speed is doing. As a matter of fact, Bill Gates warns multiple coronavirus vaccine doses
[2:49:38.560 --> 2:49:44.200]  are likely to be needed and schools should stay closed for another year. Another indication
[2:49:44.200 --> 2:49:49.120]  that this is a pandemic because where has Bill Gates focused all of his time on besides
[2:49:49.120 --> 2:49:56.420]  vaccines has been about education, big pusher of common core and a big pusher of making
[2:49:56.420 --> 2:50:04.120]  sure that you get your education online via him. And so he warns that it could take an
[2:50:04.120 --> 2:50:10.480]  quote, unbelievably big number, unquote, an unbelievably big number of doses to beat
[2:50:10.480 --> 2:50:14.640]  the virus. He says, not the vaccines at this point appear like they'll work with a single
[2:50:14.640 --> 2:50:21.920]  dose. This is our hope at the very beginning. And now they're selling Hopium. These same
[2:50:21.920 --> 2:50:28.680]  pharmaceutical companies who pushed the Opium epidemic on your now pushing the Opium epidemic.
[2:50:28.680 --> 2:50:35.600]  This hope that they use to jack up their stocks and make money to be able to get as Bill Gates
[2:50:35.600 --> 2:50:40.960]  gave $20 million to Moderna. Operation Warp Speed under President Trump has now given them
[2:50:40.960 --> 2:50:48.240]  over $450 million, over $450 million. Because, you know, when you have the Federal Reserve
[2:50:48.240 --> 2:50:53.200]  behind you, you've got even more money than the second richest man in the world, described
[2:50:53.200 --> 2:51:04.280]  by the Sun in the UK as a philanthropist. And he's going to use 0.3% of his wealth, this
[2:51:04.280 --> 2:51:08.440]  philanthropist. Boy, this guy, I tell you what, he doesn't pitch pennies when it comes to
[2:51:08.440 --> 2:51:14.560]  saving the world, does he? 0.3%. Kind of like the case fatality rate of the flu, even though
[2:51:14.560 --> 2:51:21.520]  here in Texas, you know, the case fatality rate was 0.3%. A couple of years ago, the
[2:51:21.520 --> 2:51:26.860]  last two years, one year, it was 0.3%. The other year, it was 0.4%. What is the case
[2:51:26.860 --> 2:51:34.080]  fatality rate of COVID? 0.1%. So they were three to four times worse than the fatality
[2:51:34.080 --> 2:51:39.040]  rate, the previous flu epidemic. So we had here, did you notice when we shut down the
[2:51:39.040 --> 2:51:46.920]  world in 2019, 2018? No, no. But Gates goes on to say that the closures of the school
[2:51:46.920 --> 2:51:52.800]  are the biggest cost of the pandemic. And he says more should be done to help schools
[2:51:52.800 --> 2:51:57.880]  take learning online to ensure that kids get their education. So there we go. And everyone
[2:51:57.880 --> 2:52:02.040]  is dancing to his tune, aren't they? You know, Fauci is dancing to it. And Fauci is using
[2:52:02.040 --> 2:52:10.320]  the numbers to gaslight us. Fauci is, as the Mises Institute says, the COVID panic is a
[2:52:10.320 --> 2:52:16.120]  lesson to use statistics, how to use statistics to get your own way in politics. That's right,
[2:52:16.120 --> 2:52:21.080]  statistics don't lie, but liars use statistics. And here's how they use them. Fauci is a case
[2:52:21.080 --> 2:52:25.600]  model for this. As the Mises Institute points out, it's unlikely that pundits, politicians
[2:52:25.600 --> 2:52:29.880]  and the journal public have ever been so obsessed with numbers, numbers as they are
[2:52:29.880 --> 2:52:36.040]  right now. Because, you know, that's what, you know, Fauci says, he's not in control.
[2:52:36.040 --> 2:52:39.920]  He's not in control. It's the numbers that's in control. We're going to have to see if
[2:52:39.920 --> 2:52:44.680]  there's a sage here who had to look at the numbers. Well, how do they look at the numbers?
[2:52:44.680 --> 2:52:52.080]  As Mises points out, the numbers have become the focal point of political careers in this
[2:52:52.080 --> 2:52:58.640]  time of emergency ruled by decree. Decrees may unilaterally close businesses, cut off
[2:52:58.640 --> 2:53:02.760]  people from medical procedures. Of course, ban religious gatherings, even attempt to
[2:53:02.760 --> 2:53:09.280]  confine people to their own homes. Lives and livelihoods are destroyed. But the number
[2:53:09.280 --> 2:53:16.360]  becomes the standard by which all behaviors judge. Will activity X increase or will increase
[2:53:16.360 --> 2:53:21.520]  the number or will it decrease the number? For those who wish to engage in activity Z,
[2:53:21.520 --> 2:53:27.800]  they must first prove that it will not increase the number. Nothing shall be allowed that
[2:53:27.800 --> 2:53:35.000]  does not have a good effect on the number, right? The number in question depends on what
[2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:39.200]  you want to measure. And of course, they continually change the metric, don't they? It's kind of
[2:53:39.200 --> 2:53:45.840]  like when you talk about property taxes. You got one number there, which is money that
[2:53:45.840 --> 2:53:52.400]  you send in. But that's based on two different numbers, isn't it? It's based on the evaluation
[2:53:52.400 --> 2:53:58.480]  of your property, as well as the rate, the millage rate, the tax rate per thousand. And
[2:53:58.480 --> 2:54:03.320]  the way that they always play that game is they come back and they say, well, you know,
[2:54:03.320 --> 2:54:07.800]  we haven't changed the rate for quite some time. So we're going to change the rate this
[2:54:07.800 --> 2:54:13.800]  year. But we're not going to change your, your valuation of your property, your appraisement,
[2:54:13.800 --> 2:54:18.160]  right? And then next year they come back and say, well, you know, we haven't changed the
[2:54:18.160 --> 2:54:22.080]  appraisals for a very long time. So we're going to have to do that just to keep current,
[2:54:22.080 --> 2:54:25.520]  you know, just make sure this is honest. But no matter what they do, whichever one of those
[2:54:25.520 --> 2:54:30.720]  numbers they adjust, of course, they always go up, that means that the bottom line number,
[2:54:30.720 --> 2:54:36.800]  the tax, the tax is going to go up. And so as they point out, things could get even more
[2:54:36.800 --> 2:54:40.520]  lump-sided if one number is being continually updated in real time, while another number
[2:54:40.520 --> 2:54:46.040]  is only updated occasionally. And that's precisely what they're doing, of course. Just like they
[2:54:46.040 --> 2:54:49.200]  play the game for property tax, they say, well, we're going to look at the rate or we're
[2:54:49.200 --> 2:54:52.400]  going to look at the appraisal. What they're doing is they're looking at the total number
[2:54:52.400 --> 2:54:58.720]  of cases based on tests, or they're looking at the case fatality rate. And by the way,
[2:54:58.720 --> 2:55:03.560]  they're cooking both of those numbers. But I think the best example of all of this is
[2:55:03.560 --> 2:55:13.400]  how freaked out this CNN anchor, Breanna Kyler, gets when a Trump communication director,
[2:55:13.400 --> 2:55:19.280]  Tim Murtaugh, went on the other day and started talking about hydroxychloroquine. I want to
[2:55:19.280 --> 2:55:23.600]  play a little bit of this for you, and I want you to see how upset she gets about this.
[2:55:23.600 --> 2:55:24.600]  Let's go ahead and roll that clip.
[2:55:24.600 --> 2:55:25.600]  And you know what?
[2:55:25.600 --> 2:55:26.600]  Do not, Tim.
[2:55:26.600 --> 2:55:27.600]  Do not.
[2:55:27.600 --> 2:55:28.600]  Do not.
[2:55:28.600 --> 2:55:29.600]  Because he encouraged people.
[2:55:29.600 --> 2:55:30.600]  Yes, you did.
[2:55:30.600 --> 2:55:33.480]  Well, you're on here talking about hydroxychloroquine. I think you're doing a real disservice to
[2:55:33.480 --> 2:55:36.360]  the health of Americans. I mean, if you're going to come on here and talk about how this
[2:55:36.360 --> 2:55:41.720]  is a good treatment, when doctors have said, no, it's not, and studies have been canceled
[2:55:41.720 --> 2:55:44.960]  because it's very dangerous. Dr. Fauci himself, Dr. Fauci himself has
[2:55:44.960 --> 2:55:50.280]  said he would prescribe it. Do you consider Dr. Fauci a danger to the American people?
[2:55:50.280 --> 2:55:55.360]  I do not hear Dr. Fauci telling, saying right now that people should be taking hydroxychloroquine.
[2:55:55.360 --> 2:56:01.500]  He has been asked the direct question, would you prescribe it? And he said, yes. Go back
[2:56:01.500 --> 2:56:06.080]  and check your news archives. I think we're pretty, I think, Tim, I think you're doing
[2:56:06.080 --> 2:56:10.200]  a real disservice to Americans. I just want to be clear to everyone out there. We've
[2:56:10.200 --> 2:56:15.040]  talked to a number of doctors and experts, including federal experts. This is not something
[2:56:15.040 --> 2:56:18.560]  that you want to be playing with. All right, studies have been canceled because this stuff
[2:56:18.560 --> 2:56:21.920]  is so dangerous. Tim Murtaugh, thank you for coming on.
[2:56:21.920 --> 2:56:26.440]  It's good to see you. You notice how they cannot allow this to happen. You cannot get
[2:56:26.440 --> 2:56:29.440]  this out there. We got to wait for the vaccine because the vaccine is going to cure it. No,
[2:56:29.440 --> 2:56:33.680]  we have cures. We have a lot of different cures. I mean, the asthma spray, right? The
[2:56:33.680 --> 2:56:38.160]  Texas doctor said, oh, steroid, that works. Well, guess what? Common asthma spray is
[2:56:38.160 --> 2:56:42.280]  a steroid and you can shoot it right down to the source of the fire, but it didn't stop
[2:56:42.280 --> 2:56:49.160]  there. You had another CNN reporter, Kyle Felscher, said, well, maybe there's some
[2:56:49.160 --> 2:56:53.200]  interview out there with Fauci saying that before May 27th interview that he would prescribe
[2:56:53.200 --> 2:56:59.120]  hydroxychloroquine, but I sure can't find it. So I said, all right, well, you know,
[2:56:59.120 --> 2:57:05.800]  he said this going back to 2005 and here's where the NIH said that they knew that this
[2:57:05.800 --> 2:57:13.360]  was very effective, not only as a preventative, but also as treatment. And I said, and by
[2:57:13.360 --> 2:57:19.560]  the way, there are many studies. There's one meta study that shows 105,000 patients in
[2:57:19.560 --> 2:57:25.440]  nine countries that shows a reduction of mortality by 300%. If you need any help, Kyle, you can
[2:57:25.440 --> 2:57:33.680]  just watch my program in the morning or you can pick up with Mr. Begich, who is going
[2:57:33.680 --> 2:57:38.960]  to be continuing the show here for the fourth hour. Stay with us and Nick Begich will be
[2:57:38.960 --> 2:57:44.240]  right back. All right. That's it for the broadcast. Thank you for listening. Americans
[2:57:44.240 --> 2:57:50.760]  have had freedom for so long and most Americans were born into such docile times compared
[2:57:50.760 --> 2:57:55.320]  to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny. We don't appreciate
[2:57:55.320 --> 2:58:00.240]  the American way. Truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property,
[2:58:00.240 --> 2:58:04.280]  because we've had it so long and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[2:58:04.280 --> 2:58:08.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try
[2:58:08.960 --> 2:58:13.280]  to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as
[2:58:13.280 --> 2:58:18.440]  well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world. That's
[2:58:18.440 --> 2:58:23.240]  now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad
[2:58:23.240 --> 2:58:28.600]  for the earth and we need to be cold and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites
[2:58:28.600 --> 2:58:33.200]  dominate, manipulate and command. You were even lucky enough to stay alive. And that's
[2:58:33.200 --> 2:58:39.960]  what COVID-19 is. A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against
[2:58:39.960 --> 2:58:42.880]  prosperity and against your future. If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what
[2:58:42.880 --> 2:58:45.720]  you get.
[2:58:45.720 --> 2:58:52.640]  You can't make this stuff up. A consortium of the UN WHO, the Bill of Milindigates Foundation,
[2:58:52.640 --> 2:58:57.200]  the National Institutes of Health and of course the Clinton Global Initiative headed
[2:58:57.200 --> 2:59:03.040]  up by Chelsea Clinton on the board are in control with Apple and Google with a hidden
[2:59:03.040 --> 2:59:08.640]  app on all phones that you cannot turn off. The track and trace everywhere you go, they
[2:59:08.640 --> 2:59:13.520]  claim for COVID but of course it's really the Chinese Communist social score rollout.
[2:59:13.520 --> 2:59:19.040]  These people are sick, filthy criminals and they want total control over society with
[2:59:19.040 --> 2:59:23.840]  the official global ID system. That's why it's called the Clinton Global Initiative.
[2:59:23.840 --> 2:59:30.000]  But you can fight back with the privacy pockets at infowarstore.com, little fairy day cages,
[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:35.640]  little envelopes, put your phone in it and these dirty, scumbag, fascist pieces of garbage
[2:59:35.640 --> 2:59:41.000]  can't get all that data and rape you with that data. Rape your privacy, tell the rapist
[2:59:41.000 --> 3:00:09.280]  Clintons go to hell and get your privacy pockets at infowarstore.
[3:00:12.000 --> 3:00:16.840]  And welcome back and it's good to be here this Friday morning in my part of the world
[3:00:16.840 --> 3:00:23.040]  Friday afternoon in most of the country. You know, just coming into the show, you know,
[3:00:23.040 --> 3:00:27.600]  when you come in and you're coming off of the other segments and you're listening to,
[3:00:27.600 --> 3:00:34.840]  you know, all the things going on in the world today, it always amazes me that, you know,
[3:00:34.840 --> 3:00:40.280]  we're still here, it's Friday afternoon, we're still standing and that's because of
[3:00:40.280 --> 3:00:44.400]  everyone out there listening to this broadcast, we appreciate you, the network appreciate you,
[3:00:44.400 --> 3:00:49.480]  everyone that is part of this organization. I know appreciates you because that's why
[3:00:49.480 --> 3:00:53.920]  we're able to come on and bring you the messages that we do. I'm going to shift it up a little
[3:00:53.920 --> 3:00:59.600]  bit and I want to start talking a little bit about some of the subjects that many have asked
[3:00:59.600 --> 3:01:05.520]  me to kind of get back into. And I'm going to call this one the forgotten fifth, you know,
[3:01:05.520 --> 3:01:12.080]  the forgotten fifth, 20%. And that's the nation I'm talking about. I'm talking about Alaska,
[3:01:12.080 --> 3:01:17.440]  I'm going to talk about what we are, why this place is so important. I'm going to talk about
[3:01:17.440 --> 3:01:23.320]  the history, a little bit of history, not a lot, but enough to kind of put a framework into what
[3:01:23.320 --> 3:01:28.240]  is happening here and what has happened here and what the opportunity is here because what I'm
[3:01:28.240 --> 3:01:34.080]  talking about is the opportunity of a nation. And when the United States prospers, the fact of
[3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:40.920]  the matter is the rest of the world does too. And Alaska is a key to the balance sheet equation
[3:01:40.920 --> 3:01:47.240]  that many of us see for the country that's forgotten. Alaska, when I see 20%, what do I mean by that?
[3:01:47.240 --> 3:01:53.960]  From the land standpoint, the surface estate, the land itself, it represents 18% of the entire
[3:01:53.960 --> 3:01:59.960]  land mass of the country. But we have less than a million people that live here. What that means
[3:01:59.960 --> 3:02:08.640]  is that less than one third of 1%, less than one third of 1% of the population of the country is
[3:02:08.640 --> 3:02:16.560]  here, but 18% of the country is here in terms of the land mass. Now, when you look at the coastal
[3:02:16.560 --> 3:02:21.560]  zone area that the United States jurisdiction over, which is a 200 mile limit, stretching from
[3:02:21.560 --> 3:02:29.080]  the coastline out 200 miles. Now, when you look at Alaska, if you look at a map, the coastline is
[3:02:29.080 --> 3:02:35.480]  really important. The coastline of Alaska is bigger than the east coast of the United States,
[3:02:35.480 --> 3:02:41.920]  and the west coast of the United States, and the Gulf coast of the United States. All three of the
[3:02:41.920 --> 3:02:49.480]  whole lower 48 states coastal areas combined are smaller than the coastal area of Alaska. And the
[3:02:49.480 --> 3:02:56.920]  coastal area of Alaska extends 200 miles into the ocean. So we're talking about over 20% of the
[3:02:56.920 --> 3:03:06.600]  entire land mass and resource base of the nation is in Alaska. They're forgotten. And why is it
[3:03:06.600 --> 3:03:15.040]  important for Americans to consider this? What was the conditions in 1867, a couple years after the
[3:03:15.040 --> 3:03:22.120]  Civil War, with the country in ruins that drove the purchase of Alaska from Russia? Now, you got to
[3:03:22.120 --> 3:03:28.240]  kind of put yourself in that frame historically. Country's still burning, smoldering from the war.
[3:03:28.240 --> 3:03:33.680]  Things are getting reorganized. And people are looking at Alaska and saying, Seward's folly,
[3:03:33.680 --> 3:03:39.400]  right? It was the Interior Secretary Seward. And at the time, everyone was saying, what a ridiculous
[3:03:39.400 --> 3:03:44.240]  idea this is. You know, the Russians already stripped out the wealth. They came here in the
[3:03:44.240 --> 3:03:49.160]  1700s and stripped out all the furs. They found a little bit of copper, a little bit of gold,
[3:03:49.160 --> 3:03:54.200]  nothing too serious, nothing serious enough for them to want to hang on to something they had
[3:03:54.200 --> 3:03:59.240]  trouble hanging on to anyway. And the reason they did is they never established any Interior
[3:03:59.240 --> 3:04:05.320]  forts in Alaska. And the right of conquest, if you will, and I kind of hate that phrase in a
[3:04:05.320 --> 3:04:10.720]  certain way, but the right of conquest said you had to establish forts and trading centers within
[3:04:10.720 --> 3:04:15.800]  the land that you're laying claim to and dominate the land. And that was the philosophy over 100
[3:04:15.800 --> 3:04:20.240]  years ago, a couple hundred years ago. But they never did that in Alaska because the Athabascans
[3:04:20.240 --> 3:04:25.040]  and others, when they went into the Interior, they kind of burned their forts and sent themselves.
[3:04:25.040 --> 3:04:30.600]  They did establish forts on the coastal areas. And that maybe they had title there. I don't know.
[3:04:30.600 --> 3:04:36.000]  That's still an argument to be had. But here's what happened. They transferred over. They give
[3:04:36.000 --> 3:04:42.680]  every white man, because women didn't have the right vote back then, if you remember. What they
[3:04:42.680 --> 3:04:48.120]  did is they gave every every white American person residing in that territory the right to become a
[3:04:48.120 --> 3:04:53.160]  citizen within a very short bandwidth, but not the indigenous people. So we're going to get into
[3:04:53.160 --> 3:04:59.600]  that. The globalist launch this planetary lockdown. The number one reason is it serves every one of
[3:04:59.600 --> 3:05:06.640]  their purposes. We've gone over those purposes many times here on air. The casual society, the
[3:05:06.640 --> 3:05:12.440]  surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation. But the most important
[3:05:12.440 --> 3:05:20.640]  facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential. As we begin to witness
[3:05:20.640 --> 3:05:28.200]  automation computers and robots, take over the jobs that people once had by design. This isn't
[3:05:28.200 --> 3:05:35.080]  like it's some advancement that we just fell into. It's been preplanned, organized globally. And
[3:05:35.080 --> 3:05:41.360]  it's extremely predatory. And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations,
[3:05:41.360 --> 3:05:48.080]  the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate
[3:05:48.080 --> 3:06:04.440]  power. This is the truest form of technocracy fascism. You know, four years ago, we put out
[3:06:04.440 --> 3:06:09.400]  with Roger Stone a shirt that said rapist under the image of Bill Clinton. But I think everybody
[3:06:09.400 --> 3:06:14.960]  should put out t-shirts that say medical tyrant in the image of Bill Gates. Maybe t-shirts that say
[3:06:14.960 --> 3:06:22.080]  vaccine, his image under it, rapist. Because that's what we're facing. And notice he's telling you
[3:06:22.080 --> 3:06:26.400]  it's going to hurt or kill 700,000 people, his numbers, and that he needs to be indemnified
[3:06:26.400 --> 3:06:31.320]  for liability. I know everybody's pinching themselves because we've woken up inside a
[3:06:31.320 --> 3:06:35.160]  dystopic nightmare, but this is for real. And we could see the preparation for all of this.
[3:06:35.160 --> 3:06:39.880]  That's how we predicted it. But let me just say this. My daughter, standing out in the
[3:06:39.880 --> 3:06:43.320]  woods just the other day, looked at me and she said, Daddy, I don't want to go home and
[3:06:43.320 --> 3:06:50.000]  take my nap at two o'clock. It was like 1.30. She said, I want to stay awake because God's
[3:06:50.000 --> 3:06:54.240]  world that God built is so beautiful. And those exact words. And she had a little chair
[3:06:54.240 --> 3:06:59.360]  in her eye. And she was feeling God's power in the universe. Humans are incredible. Yes,
[3:06:59.360 --> 3:07:03.560]  we're falling indefinite because we haven't been given the proper missions by other fellow
[3:07:03.560 --> 3:07:08.440]  humans, but God's got a mission for us. And it is to people, the stars. So I am going
[3:07:08.440 --> 3:07:13.520]  to set up the human defense force. I thought about this decade to go, setting up a foundation.
[3:07:13.520 --> 3:07:17.320]  The image will be a man with a club, smashing a robot, but that's too primitive an image.
[3:07:17.320 --> 3:07:21.520]  We need something that powers humanity and symbolizes us going interplanetary. I'm not
[3:07:21.520 --> 3:07:25.440]  going to sit here while these corporates sewer control freaks create a model for us in the
[3:07:25.440 --> 3:07:30.320]  future and decide that we're obsolete. Because as fallen as humanity is, the globalists are
[3:07:30.320 --> 3:07:35.160]  the most fallen of us all. They project their own hatred of themselves on us. The spirit
[3:07:35.160 --> 3:07:40.080]  and the strength I feel around common people of every race, color and creed is so fulfilling
[3:07:40.080 --> 3:07:43.840]  and so empowering. It's like a pure clean spring in the desert when you had had water
[3:07:43.840 --> 3:07:47.600]  for three days. As I'll just say this right now, I will never sell out. I will never back
[3:07:47.600 --> 3:07:50.920]  down. I will never give in. And that's not even hard to do because this is where I want
[3:07:50.920 --> 3:07:56.480]  to be. It's not some special altruistic, heroic thing to not sell out. It's human. And I'm
[3:07:56.480 --> 3:08:00.080]  going down with humanity. And I know in the end, humanity will survive, will be a remnant,
[3:08:00.080 --> 3:08:04.880]  but billions will die. Like Bob Marley said, the book must be fulfilled. And I just feel
[3:08:04.880 --> 3:08:08.600]  really, really sad for those that think they've bet on the right side and given into the dark
[3:08:08.600 --> 3:08:11.200]  side and given in the new world order because you're going to be destroyed, going to be
[3:08:11.200 --> 3:08:15.720]  totally destroyed and be cut off from God. And that's hell in itself, being separated
[3:08:15.720 --> 3:08:21.360]  from God is hell. And so I look at Bill Gates up there staring the camera with evil smiles
[3:08:21.360 --> 3:08:25.640]  and hatred because he knows he's revealed, letting us know he's coming for us. Bill Gates,
[3:08:25.640 --> 3:08:29.960]  you're coming for you. You've already been exposed. You're coming at us to rape us with
[3:08:29.960 --> 3:08:35.040]  your deadly DNA vaccines to play God, to mark the flag among Santa that you've known part
[3:08:35.040 --> 3:08:39.760]  of, to make us your shadow. We tell you this will be your undoing. Just like Hitler was
[3:08:39.760 --> 3:08:43.800]  able to take over half of Europe before people started fighting back. And then most of Europe
[3:08:43.800 --> 3:08:48.760]  and part of Russia before humanity turned the tide, you will end up in the ash heap of tyrants.
[3:08:48.760 --> 3:08:53.200]  You will only be a tester of humanity. And you will only cause us to trigger that catalyst
[3:08:53.200 --> 3:08:56.920]  that overthrows your satanic system. But as for me, I am with God. And that means I am
[3:08:56.920 --> 3:09:01.120]  with God's creation, humanity. And the entire book of revelations, the entire book of daily,
[3:09:01.120 --> 3:09:05.040]  the entire book of Ezekiel, the entire book of Genesis is all interconnected. And it's
[3:09:05.040 --> 3:09:10.160]  all being manifest right now. And the servants of Satan are so fallen, they believe that
[3:09:10.160 --> 3:09:14.920]  they can become Silicon Gods. Somehow they could fix themselves when it's Christ spirit
[3:09:14.920 --> 3:09:19.680]  that can fix them and transcend them only by becoming wedded with Christ. Can we pass
[3:09:19.680 --> 3:09:23.880]  over the bridge and be complete? Not by serving Satan in the New World Order. The fruits of
[3:09:23.880 --> 3:09:29.120]  the New World Order are pure death and destruction. And everyone knows it. It stinks to high heaven.
[3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:33.560]  Every part of it is a lie and a betrayal. So turn back, humanity. Turn back from the
[3:09:33.560 --> 3:09:38.360]  New World Order. And I want to encourage those who have been serving evil, whatever reason,
[3:09:38.360 --> 3:09:42.080]  to turn back while there's still time. If you can feel the Holy Spirit, if you can feel
[3:09:42.080 --> 3:09:46.960]  a calling, if you can even hear my voice and feel like you want to reach out and want to
[3:09:46.960 --> 3:09:49.760]  get out of what you're in, you don't have to reach out to all the towns. You've got to
[3:09:49.760 --> 3:09:53.720]  reach out to God and say, God, show me how powerful you are. Show me how you're the
[3:09:53.720 --> 3:09:58.360]  rule of the universe. I'm weak. I need you to help me. I repent of what I've done. I
[3:09:58.360 --> 3:10:03.240]  want to change and show me. And the minute, the second you make that decision, it will
[3:10:03.240 --> 3:10:06.920]  all turn. But it's got to be legitimate. It's got to be real. And you'll know it's real.
[3:10:06.920 --> 3:10:10.440]  Come to Jesus. It's the only way.
[3:10:10.440 --> 3:10:18.400]  Wow. That was a little clip slid in for this segment from Alex. It's an important clip.
[3:10:18.400 --> 3:10:24.320]  Think about those words. Think about that message in the context of today. We're in
[3:10:24.320 --> 3:10:31.080]  the middle of it. And I'm talking about a different topic today. I'm switching it up
[3:10:31.080 --> 3:10:38.400]  a little bit because at the end of all this, something happens. Are we going to check out
[3:10:38.400 --> 3:10:44.480]  this time or is this thing going to slow down and be hunted forward? Oh, no. Nobody knows
[3:10:44.480 --> 3:10:50.640]  the hour or the moment. So I think we continue forward with the way we view life. We look
[3:10:50.640 --> 3:10:55.360]  at these things that are in our way and we make sure that we're the obstacle to slow
[3:10:55.360 --> 3:11:02.480]  this process down and get hearts and minds connected again. And so much of the messaging
[3:11:02.480 --> 3:11:09.160]  that comes out of Infowars is really misunderstood. And I went through some things locally the
[3:11:09.160 --> 3:11:15.840]  last few weeks. And here's what I would say. The rollout right now, the social messaging
[3:11:15.840 --> 3:11:25.240]  rollout that's happening nationally, it's happening here too. Here in Alaska, this blueprint,
[3:11:25.240 --> 3:11:32.160]  this map to a creation that's way different is being rolled out all over the United States.
[3:11:32.160 --> 3:11:38.520]  Even here in Alaska, I cannot believe what I've seen here. But that's it. They're taking
[3:11:38.520 --> 3:11:45.280]  the template that the Democratic Party and others have put out there as a way to agitate
[3:11:45.280 --> 3:11:51.240]  the public to create unrest and then capitalize on that unrest and that anger that's in the
[3:11:51.240 --> 3:11:58.240]  public. But what they've done is they're taking this emotional wave and trying to redirect
[3:11:58.240 --> 3:12:02.320]  it into their queue. And they tried it here locally on a couple of things recently. It
[3:12:02.320 --> 3:12:07.680]  didn't work out so well. In fact, what happened is they end up inflaming the public because
[3:12:07.680 --> 3:12:12.960]  what is obvious to the public. And this gets back to the last hour talking about doing
[3:12:12.960 --> 3:12:18.960]  things local, not waiting for the federal government. This is correct. Take the actions
[3:12:18.960 --> 3:12:24.120]  when your local legislators or assembly members or council members, however you're constructed
[3:12:24.120 --> 3:12:29.200]  in your local government, actually have to look you in the eye. Now, what's happening
[3:12:29.200 --> 3:12:35.560]  this week, this coming week is our mayor again has shut down the public process so people
[3:12:35.560 --> 3:12:39.640]  can't get together and come to public meetings. They're going to do them all virtually again.
[3:12:39.640 --> 3:12:46.000]  Now, what's the problem there? Part of the public discourse is the public actually shaking
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:51.040]  hands with each other, okay, meeting each other personally. That's how networks form
[3:12:51.040 --> 3:12:55.040]  in the political process. You show up for the meeting, you meet all your neighbors,
[3:12:55.040 --> 3:13:00.480]  you find out you have a commonality, you group together. That's the essence of the town square,
[3:13:00.480 --> 3:13:04.640]  ladies and gentlemen. They're shutting it off and putting us behind microphones and
[3:13:04.640 --> 3:13:11.920]  screens so we can't do that anymore. Because they know when it happens, we are very effective
[3:13:11.920 --> 3:13:19.840]  because the balance between money and politicians, you know, the scale of the politician's scale,
[3:13:19.840 --> 3:13:26.080]  the weight of the future for the politician's life cycle, it's people in pitchforks and
[3:13:26.080 --> 3:13:32.280]  I'm not talking about metaphorically, you know, people voicing themselves or money voicing
[3:13:32.280 --> 3:13:36.280]  themselves and, you know, the people have been quiet for a very long time and we're
[3:13:36.280 --> 3:13:43.880]  not being quiet anymore. The problem is the left is taking this frustration and trying
[3:13:43.880 --> 3:13:51.360]  to shift it into anger and route that anger against a group of people, you and me, the
[3:13:51.360 --> 3:13:55.960]  average person who looks at the world way differently than a globalist does, who looks
[3:13:55.960 --> 3:14:00.760]  at the world way differently. When as Alex said in that last segment, when you look in
[3:14:00.760 --> 3:14:05.600]  your child's eyes and you hear the words from their mouth, the purity of that moment is
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:11.320]  captured and not forgotten and that's the human touch in it, you see. That's where
[3:14:11.320 --> 3:14:18.880]  we come into each other's face. We join with each other. We recognize the divinity in each
[3:14:18.880 --> 3:14:27.400]  other and we begin to act on it. We do that personally, one to one, touching each other.
[3:14:27.400 --> 3:14:32.920]  This is the reality they're trying to strip away so we can't have that connection to one
[3:14:32.920 --> 3:14:38.720]  another, which connects us to the universal, which connects us really in a certain way
[3:14:38.720 --> 3:14:46.760]  to God because we are under that one creation. We're just waking up to remember it and remember
[3:14:46.760 --> 3:14:53.040]  how to get there and what we need to do. In the backdrop of all this, we have this push
[3:14:53.040 --> 3:14:59.120]  against us, against our humanity, against the creation. That's what we feel the tension
[3:14:59.120 --> 3:15:07.640]  over. Keep the resistance focused in the right way in the calm light of knowing that we hold
[3:15:07.640 --> 3:15:15.480]  the power of the chain. Act with the authority that you already have, not in a mean, aggressive
[3:15:15.480 --> 3:15:19.800]  way. You don't need to. When you have the authority, you just say the word and the
[3:15:19.800 --> 3:15:25.760]  action happens. There's an opportunity in all this, nonsense, where the righteous can
[3:15:25.760 --> 3:15:30.280]  rise into the moment and that's where we're headed, that's where we're going. In a couple
[3:15:30.280 --> 3:15:34.600]  seconds, you're going to start hearing the messages, the commercial break, the way you

[3:17:20.080 --> 3:17:25.080]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[3:17:25.080 --> 3:17:29.640]  my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[3:17:29.640 --> 3:17:33.680]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people
[3:17:33.680 --> 3:17:37.760]  deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe
[3:17:37.760 --> 3:17:42.760]  taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[3:17:57.880 --> 3:18:03.280]  Hollywood directors, producers, actors. They wanted to meet with me and they said, what
[3:18:03.280 --> 3:18:07.600]  is your formal education? I said, well, really, nothing but a few years of college. They said,
[3:18:07.600 --> 3:18:13.680]  well, how are you one of the best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard?
[3:18:13.680 --> 3:18:18.680]  The stuff you come up with is just unbelievable. We'd like you to be in movies. We'd like
[3:18:18.680 --> 3:18:22.880]  you to write with us. We'd like you to do voiceovers. You're just a renaissance man.
[3:18:22.880 --> 3:18:26.160]  Folks know I was in some movies and Harry Shearer made statements like that and a lot
[3:18:26.160 --> 3:18:31.280]  of others. I'm not bragging. I kept explaining to them. I said, do you understand? I didn't
[3:18:31.280 --> 3:18:38.000]  come up with any of this. I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents. They
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:42.040]  would just laugh at me and say, oh, no way. Then I would give them the documents. They
[3:18:42.040 --> 3:18:46.120]  would get very, very scared the next time I saw them in a few months and say, man, you're
[3:18:46.120 --> 3:18:53.120]  right. This is dystopic. Folks, I didn't make any of this up. Okay. It's real. It's real.
[3:18:53.120 --> 3:19:02.600]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[3:19:02.600 --> 3:19:10.360]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date. Super male vitality specifically
[3:19:10.360 --> 3:19:17.400]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[3:19:17.400 --> 3:19:24.400]  in males. Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains
[3:19:24.400 --> 3:19:33.240]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives. Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined
[3:19:33.240 --> 3:19:39.080]  with modern technology working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the
[3:19:39.080 --> 3:19:45.240]  most out of this herb packed formula. So what are you waiting for? Go to the info or store.
[3:19:45.240 --> 3:19:52.240]  There have been a better time than right now. Super male vitality at info or store.com.
[3:19:52.240 --> 3:20:14.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Let me tell you how it will be. And welcome
[3:20:14.640 --> 3:20:15.640]  back.
[3:20:15.640 --> 3:20:22.160]  You know, just before the going into the break, we were talking a little bit about some of
[3:20:22.160 --> 3:20:29.160]  the things going on. And I'm trying to weave this together a little bit because to get the
[3:20:29.160 --> 3:20:34.920]  small picture, you got to have the big picture. And to engage, to get your power back, you
[3:20:34.920 --> 3:20:40.320]  have to be able to do things that you knowingly absolutely can achieve. And again, getting
[3:20:40.320 --> 3:20:48.880]  back to local acting locally, doing things that matter, it does matter. It adds up. And
[3:20:48.880 --> 3:20:55.200]  in the local sort of microcosm of what we do in life, it does matter because who you
[3:20:55.200 --> 3:21:00.680]  meet in your neighborhoods, who you meet that's out there with similar beliefs. And at the
[3:21:00.680 --> 3:21:05.400]  same time, a way to kind of lift each other up at a time when things are pretty unstable.
[3:21:05.400 --> 3:21:10.720]  I can't think you can characterize it any other way. And we got a bird's eye view sort
[3:21:10.720 --> 3:21:14.560]  of from Alaska. We look out at the rest of the country, see what's going on. And a lot
[3:21:14.560 --> 3:21:21.280]  of it we're just baffled by, you know, because it doesn't work out that way here. You know,
[3:21:21.280 --> 3:21:25.320]  we see a little differently, perhaps here. And maybe it's because it's a smaller community
[3:21:25.320 --> 3:21:30.560]  and I would buy into that. Because even though that's a big state, as I was saying before
[3:21:30.560 --> 3:21:36.680]  the break, it's a small population. So what does that do? That means that in Alaska, with
[3:21:36.680 --> 3:21:44.280]  this 20% of the whole country, landmass, about 500 or 1,000 people are the activists, the
[3:21:44.280 --> 3:21:49.400]  elected local elected leaders, the heads of big organizations, people who stay engaged
[3:21:49.400 --> 3:21:56.800]  as individuals, about 500, maybe 1,000 at the most. That's not very many influencers.
[3:21:56.800 --> 3:22:02.200]  You see, because that's what happens is these big organizations try and impact the influencers
[3:22:02.200 --> 3:22:06.960]  and then everyone else just kind of gets hurt along. That's called co-option. You know,
[3:22:06.960 --> 3:22:11.200]  in classical organizing, what you do is you go after the leadership, you co-opt them,
[3:22:11.200 --> 3:22:17.400]  you seduce them in all the different ways and do moving your direct. And that's done
[3:22:17.400 --> 3:22:22.040]  in a lot of different ways. And what I discovered in the last few weeks, it never really dawned
[3:22:22.040 --> 3:22:28.480]  on me how powerful nonprofit organizations are until I dealt with this local group.
[3:22:28.480 --> 3:22:33.480]  And this local group is as big as one of the biggest trusts in the state and it's private.
[3:22:33.480 --> 3:22:39.960]  It's a family foundation. Okay, what does that mean? That means they have to give away
[3:22:39.960 --> 3:22:44.560]  5% of their capital every year. Their total value. They got to give away. They got to
[3:22:44.560 --> 3:22:48.640]  spend. They don't have an option. They have to spend. They can earn more money and replace
[3:22:48.640 --> 3:22:54.520]  it, but they got to spend 5% of their capital out the door. So this forces the expenditure
[3:22:54.520 --> 3:22:59.760]  in a certain way. But at the same time, you go, well, these are altruistic organizations.
[3:22:59.760 --> 3:23:06.480]  You know, they're 501c3 tax exempt. They don't pay taxes. When they are 501c3, you're correct.
[3:23:06.480 --> 3:23:11.120]  They don't pay taxes, but they don't technically are supposed to have political speech. See,
[3:23:11.120 --> 3:23:18.080]  because a 501c3 that asserts political speech to influence elections or regulation or law
[3:23:18.080 --> 3:23:23.040]  violates their 501c3 charter and they lose their tax exempt status. To do that, you
[3:23:23.040 --> 3:23:27.920]  need a 501c4. Those aren't tax exempt. So you can give money to them. You can't write
[3:23:27.920 --> 3:23:31.440]  it all. You can give money to them. They can spend it on whatever they want, you know,
[3:23:31.440 --> 3:23:35.800]  in that sense. But it's not a tax exempt organization. It's a political organization.
[3:23:35.800 --> 3:23:42.920]  It gets political speech. But why would some big rich dude set up a nonprofit? Well, first
[3:23:42.920 --> 3:23:47.640]  of all, they get to keep all the money. All right, all the money. They don't pay anything,
[3:23:47.640 --> 3:23:51.200]  you know, for the public good, except what they decide is in the interest of the public
[3:23:51.200 --> 3:23:56.360]  good, which really isn't about the public good anymore. It's about a family trust and
[3:23:56.360 --> 3:24:01.200]  how the family views the world. You see, my family has the opposite. It has what's called
[3:24:01.200 --> 3:24:08.520]  a public trust. And what it's used for is scholarship. That's it. Scholarship for education.
[3:24:08.520 --> 3:24:14.680]  And that's it. But here's the point. Does it have an impact on policy? Yes, of course,
[3:24:14.680 --> 3:24:19.400]  whoever gets a scholarship and goes on and gets an education might actually do something.
[3:24:19.400 --> 3:24:25.960]  You know, that certainly fueled in the fire. So why does billions flow into nonprofits?
[3:24:25.960 --> 3:24:32.520]  Because then you can, under the guise of altruism and goodness, do all these wonderful things
[3:24:32.520 --> 3:24:37.040]  without paying taxes and influence all these politicians who recognize, remember what I
[3:24:37.040 --> 3:24:41.880]  said before, people or money. Well, this is the money equation, you see, because they
[3:24:41.880 --> 3:24:45.760]  can all feel good. Oh, it's a nonprofit. It's got this great social good. Wrap their arms
[3:24:45.760 --> 3:24:50.320]  around it as they're influenced all the way down the road to do whatever they're told.
[3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:55.840]  It's just a different influence, influencing body. And they get certain tax considerations
[3:24:55.840 --> 3:25:02.720]  to do it. I understand all that. I get all that. Create a complex roadmap for life.
[3:25:02.720 --> 3:25:07.480]  No one pays attention. That's how it works. You see, the more detailed, the more layering,
[3:25:07.480 --> 3:25:11.680]  the less people get it. Because when the law library used to be a book, you could carry
[3:25:11.680 --> 3:25:16.480]  under your arm and Abraham Lincoln could study the law and pass the bar exam, become an attorney,
[3:25:16.480 --> 3:25:22.040]  never went to college, right? Because he was smart and had good intelligence and the law
[3:25:22.040 --> 3:25:27.160]  to be understandable by the average citizen. After all, it's one third of the whole governmental
[3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:32.280]  structure we have in this Democratic Republic, the justice system that most of us, unless
[3:25:32.280 --> 3:25:38.480]  you're really, really rich, have discovered you can't access on an equal footing under
[3:25:38.480 --> 3:25:43.120]  civil law, right? I mean, if it's criminal, you might get an attorney if you exhaust everything
[3:25:43.120 --> 3:25:49.520]  you own to defend your innocence first. But it is not a justice system. It's a system
[3:25:49.520 --> 3:25:54.480]  used to hurt people now. And it's changed because it didn't start that way. We got to
[3:25:54.480 --> 3:26:02.440]  go back. We got to sort of unraveling the web, because when you take the very, very long
[3:26:02.440 --> 3:26:10.480]  view that family trust takes, the multi-generational view that we ought to take, they plan the
[3:26:10.480 --> 3:26:17.720]  game plan, not for the second quarter. They plan it for the end of the ninth season and
[3:26:17.720 --> 3:26:24.160]  their retirement program. Okay. They play it out. They game it out. I travel all over
[3:26:24.160 --> 3:26:27.680]  the world. You know, the game, the template that I was talking about trying to be laid
[3:26:27.680 --> 3:26:34.280]  on Anchorage, Alaska, from wherever the national politics is driven, it's so disconnected that
[3:26:34.280 --> 3:26:39.000]  it's obvious, okay? Because it doesn't fit into the culture of Alaska, because we are
[3:26:39.000 --> 3:26:42.200]  very different place. We have very complex situation here.
[3:26:42.200 --> 3:26:48.440]  So what I would say is, and what I want to get it back into is not just sort of the heart
[3:26:48.440 --> 3:26:54.560]  of the country, all right? Maybe it's Alaska, you know? Okay. Maybe. I'm just saying that
[3:26:54.560 --> 3:27:00.160]  maybe because we can still breathe freely here most of the time, although they're creeping
[3:27:00.160 --> 3:27:07.640]  in in our cities, we can still breathe free here. We can still think freely here. We still
[3:27:07.640 --> 3:27:12.440]  have the opportunity to create something really cool here, really interesting here for the
[3:27:12.440 --> 3:27:17.240]  nation. And we're being neglected and we're being used as a poster child for various political
[3:27:17.240 --> 3:27:23.920]  organizations that would like to keep this contained. Now, why? It's like, you know, when
[3:27:23.920 --> 3:27:31.360]  you have a treasure buried in a hole and you never know it, that's where we are, ladies
[3:27:31.360 --> 3:27:39.160]  and gentlemen, here in Alaska. We're the national treasury buried out of your view up here.
[3:27:39.160 --> 3:27:42.320]  Up here. I say it to my friends all the time. I live on the moon, you know, because it's
[3:27:42.320 --> 3:27:47.720]  so far removed from so many other places. But now we can use these networks to talk about
[3:27:47.720 --> 3:27:53.560]  this. Why is it important? Because if we're going to produce anything, we have to start
[3:27:53.560 --> 3:28:01.040]  with the foundations of wealth. And that has one of the four pillars of that is natural
[3:28:01.040 --> 3:28:08.520]  resources in land. And Americans, all of us in common are rich in natural resources and
[3:28:08.520 --> 3:28:15.520]  we miss it. We have an opportunity and an obligation to be responsible for that which
[3:28:15.520 --> 3:28:21.320]  we have. We have a way to do this. Alaska is part of that answer. It is the hidden fifth,
[3:28:21.320 --> 3:28:27.080]  20% of the nation's landmass, perhaps the greatest treasury of all hidden in the wilderness
[3:28:27.080 --> 3:28:30.800]  of Alaska. This is Dr. Nick Begich. We're going to be right back after these very important
[3:28:30.800 --> 3:28:37.280]  messages. Also, check out EarthPulse. EarthPulse.com. That's my website. Take a look there. Any

[3:31:52.560 --> 3:31:58.480]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist
[3:31:58.480 --> 3:32:04.960]  shiny style total net surveillance censorship with AI. The good news is they had to do that
[3:32:04.960 --> 3:32:11.440]  to carry out this world government COVID takeover. This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers
[3:32:11.440 --> 3:32:16.920]  for because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them. And the good
[3:32:16.920 --> 3:32:24.720]  news is there are still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, Paul Watson Sites
[3:32:24.720 --> 3:32:29.520]  Summit.News, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to
[3:32:29.520 --> 3:32:38.360]  you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own destinies.
[3:32:38.360 --> 3:32:43.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health,
[3:32:43.040 --> 3:32:48.080]  a war on our economy, but being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against
[3:32:48.080 --> 3:32:55.840]  it will defeat it. So take action or be slaves.
[3:32:55.840 --> 3:33:12.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:12.320 --> 3:33:20.800]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Nick Baggage. You're listening to the
[3:33:20.800 --> 3:33:28.720]  Alex Jones show. And welcome back, you know, while just before the break kind of trying
[3:33:28.720 --> 3:33:34.960]  to tie some of this together, because at the very top of all this, it's like the overview.
[3:33:34.960 --> 3:33:40.600]  You know, what do you have? You've got resources, you have people, you have entrepreneurship
[3:33:40.600 --> 3:33:45.080]  creativity, if you will. You have factories, equipment, things that make things, those
[3:33:45.080 --> 3:33:51.760]  four things I often weave into my conversation, because these are the base of wealth, you
[3:33:51.760 --> 3:33:58.840]  see. In the beginning of this country, most people were rooted in the land, right? I mean,
[3:33:58.840 --> 3:34:05.400]  we got land and then we built buildings, cabins, houses, whatever, farms, and we owned equipment,
[3:34:05.400 --> 3:34:13.160]  eventually horses, wagons, plows, shovels, things that made things. And so the average
[3:34:13.160 --> 3:34:20.760]  person had real wealth. It wasn't just cash in some 401k that can evaporate in a second
[3:34:20.760 --> 3:34:26.240]  by some manipulation that none of us have really any direct control over, correct? Think
[3:34:26.240 --> 3:34:33.360]  about it. The things that represent your wealth today are digital entries on somebody's ledger,
[3:34:33.360 --> 3:34:38.960]  more so than they were the real assets of 100 years ago. Now, why do I bring that up? Because
[3:34:38.960 --> 3:34:44.240]  the illusion that's been created, that wealth is paper certificates that represent some
[3:34:44.240 --> 3:34:48.960]  form of value, whether it's currency or stock certificates or promissory notes, or any of
[3:34:48.960 --> 3:34:52.360]  these things. And if you study the history of currency in the United States, you find
[3:34:52.360 --> 3:34:58.920]  out that all of these things and a lot more, even trade tokens at the local trading post,
[3:34:58.920 --> 3:35:03.800]  you know, I mean, there were a lot of things used to be the medium between goods that people
[3:35:03.800 --> 3:35:09.000]  said, okay, that has value. We'll use that as kind of the in-between lubricant between
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:16.240]  the things that matter, which is labor, your work, entrepreneurship, your creative ability
[3:35:16.240 --> 3:35:21.320]  to put things together and make it into money, into products and the things that are of value
[3:35:21.320 --> 3:35:26.200]  to people that produce more of the lubricant to allow you to go get more capital, more
[3:35:26.200 --> 3:35:31.360]  labor and more things to put together to make things with. That's creativity. We've gone
[3:35:31.360 --> 3:35:35.360]  to this digital form of creativity, this ether, right? I call it all the time, is it
[3:35:35.360 --> 3:35:39.560]  tough money? It's air, it's like it doesn't even, it's not even real, you can't eat it,
[3:35:39.560 --> 3:35:45.240]  you can't touch it, it's just a theory of something. So what I'm saying is we should
[3:35:45.240 --> 3:35:51.920]  reevaluate what are those factors. Now, what happened in 1913 that a lot of people don't
[3:35:51.920 --> 3:35:55.400]  fully understand, and I go back to this a lot, is that, you know, when we got the income
[3:35:55.400 --> 3:36:00.480]  tax, because before that, what people forgot is what took us there. What took us there
[3:36:00.480 --> 3:36:12.200]  was a US Supreme Court case that said, your labor, your sweat, your blood, your breath,
[3:36:12.200 --> 3:36:20.240]  your living experience could not be taxed, that that was slavery. Is it slavery? I think
[3:36:20.240 --> 3:36:26.240]  it is still. We changed the Constitution to allow this form of slavery. Okay, that's
[3:36:26.240 --> 3:36:31.440]  what we really did. We instituted a form of slavery at the same time we got rid of one.
[3:36:31.440 --> 3:36:37.200]  We just created a new one that all of us get to be in. Stop and think about this. This
[3:36:37.200 --> 3:36:44.080]  is where multi-generational knowledge gets forgotten. It was illegal based on the Civil
[3:36:44.080 --> 3:36:51.560]  War and the whole slavery question by our US Supreme Court in the 1890s, over 30 years
[3:36:51.560 --> 3:36:59.920]  after the Civil War that said, you cannot tax a human being's labor. One of the four factors
[3:36:59.920 --> 3:37:07.480]  of production, they took it. See, they enslaved us all in what the Greeks once called thousands
[3:37:07.480 --> 3:37:16.840]  of years ago, wage slaves, because that's how it works. You become beholding to that
[3:37:16.840 --> 3:37:23.560]  person, that source of your exchange, what's going to get you goods and services. You're
[3:37:23.560 --> 3:37:30.240]  one step up above from being owned. You're just owned a little differently. That's all.
[3:37:30.240 --> 3:37:35.840]  And so we've got a false narrative, again, playing in the world about slavery that doesn't
[3:37:35.840 --> 3:37:43.600]  include all of us. And there's a Supreme Court case that lays it out. This isn't some fiction.
[3:37:43.600 --> 3:37:52.200]  This is the reality of the moment that we're in right now, 100 plus years later. Re-evaluation
[3:37:52.200 --> 3:37:57.360]  time at the same time they created that Federal Reserve that's never been fully audited, ever
[3:37:57.360 --> 3:38:04.520]  fully audited. This is huge, ladies and gentlemen. It should be audited every year, fully and
[3:38:04.520 --> 3:38:10.880]  externally, not internally, the game they play. When Bernanke was in there and he was
[3:38:10.880 --> 3:38:15.200]  talking to my brother when he was a U.S. Senator, and they were trying to make the case for
[3:38:15.200 --> 3:38:21.320]  why my brother was wrong and insisting with the Republicans that there be an audit, they
[3:38:21.320 --> 3:38:28.080]  need an audit. Anyone honest knows it. Big organizations that run whole economies, don't
[3:38:28.080 --> 3:38:33.040]  you think they ought to be looked at a little bit, considering the impact on all of us that
[3:38:33.040 --> 3:38:36.520]  they just might have? How about that?
[3:38:36.520 --> 3:38:42.880]  And so what I try to do is in the context of sort of this weird picture that's unfolding,
[3:38:42.880 --> 3:38:48.160]  put something back in it. You know in Alaska, here was one of the great things, a last frontier.
[3:38:48.160 --> 3:38:55.240]  That was our slogan up here, a last place. Because you, if you were a man or a woman
[3:38:55.240 --> 3:39:00.880]  in America and were 18 years old, could come here. And on most of the land that was here,
[3:39:00.880 --> 3:39:05.720]  if you made a discovery of a valuable mineral, you could lay claim to it. And there was a
[3:39:05.720 --> 3:39:10.800]  structure and there still is for a lot of our public lands. But most of it, most of
[3:39:10.800 --> 3:39:17.120]  the most promising of promising, there were two layers actually now a third of taking.
[3:39:17.120 --> 3:39:21.200]  And it goes back a long time. It goes back over a hundred years. It goes actually back
[3:39:21.200 --> 3:39:25.120]  to the Russian. Because this has been a place that people have come to take things from
[3:39:25.120 --> 3:39:30.400]  and go away. The Russians came, took all the forefors. They actually did enslave the people
[3:39:30.400 --> 3:39:35.240]  here, the Native Americans here. And they used to enslave each other before the Russians
[3:39:35.240 --> 3:39:39.640]  showed up. I can tell you, I know the history. But what happened here then is that the furs
[3:39:39.640 --> 3:39:44.720]  ran out. They went, they sold this, you know, it's like a fire sale for them. Then we discovered
[3:39:44.720 --> 3:39:51.120]  gold and copper. And guess who showed up for the copper? It was the Guggenheim family and
[3:39:51.120 --> 3:39:56.280]  Morgan Trust, you know, Morgan Chase, you know, the people we keep bailing out. Well,
[3:39:56.280 --> 3:40:01.160]  they've been around looting the country for over a hundred years in conjunction with globalists.
[3:40:01.160 --> 3:40:05.840]  The Guggenheims didn't start out that way. They came here in the U.S. in the middle of
[3:40:05.840 --> 3:40:12.040]  1800s, and we're selling a polished, polished stove pipes of old wood stoves to make them
[3:40:12.040 --> 3:40:17.120]  black again. They made a lot of money. They started investing in Colorado mines and they
[3:40:17.120 --> 3:40:22.040]  began to corner the copper market. They began to really hammer it out. And they did. And
[3:40:22.040 --> 3:40:27.200]  then they came to Alaska and got kind of caught one of the richest copper deposits in history.
[3:40:27.200 --> 3:40:31.280]  And I know a lot about it because I own the opposite end of that Monroe Belt. Myself and
[3:40:31.280 --> 3:40:37.040]  partners have one of the most promising copper deposits in that region. But the point of
[3:40:37.040 --> 3:40:42.680]  the matter I'm making is people came here and they took all that copper out. And then
[3:40:42.680 --> 3:40:47.080]  what did they do? They supplied most of the copper for bullets for World War One and World
[3:40:47.080 --> 3:40:51.960]  War Two. And they left Alaska. And when they left Alaska, why did they leave? Because there
[3:40:51.960 --> 3:40:55.520]  wasn't very many people here. So you had a really expensive workhorse. There wasn't
[3:40:55.520 --> 3:40:59.480]  any big farms here. So you had to bring in all your food or grow it. And so what they
[3:40:59.480 --> 3:41:04.560]  did is they literally pulled up all the tracks. So no one else in that mineral area would
[3:41:04.560 --> 3:41:08.080]  develop anything, pulled up all the tracks and went to Latin America where there was
[3:41:08.080 --> 3:41:11.960]  a lot of labor and it was very cheap and they didn't have to house them or feed them. They
[3:41:11.960 --> 3:41:15.920]  could pay them nothing. And that's what they did. And they created a copper industry in
[3:41:15.920 --> 3:41:22.920]  Peru and Chile and runs to this day. And Alaska was put in the freezer for the future
[3:41:22.920 --> 3:41:30.480]  of globalists, actually, because this became the safety deposit box. There was a couple
[3:41:30.480 --> 3:41:34.960]  things that happened here that disrupted it. And one of my dad was involved and it was
[3:41:34.960 --> 3:41:39.040]  a Native Land Claim Settlement Act which gave the Native Americans here the first right
[3:41:39.040 --> 3:41:44.880]  of selection. So they got to pick from all federal lands, including lands that the state
[3:41:44.880 --> 3:41:49.240]  hadn't even finished selecting. We didn't even finish our state selections and they
[3:41:49.240 --> 3:41:53.000]  got to come in and that was appropriate. My dad fought hard for that and they got to
[3:41:53.000 --> 3:41:59.480]  pick 44 million acres of the prime property based on their historical locations and the
[3:41:59.480 --> 3:42:03.280]  mineral, oil and gas, all the rights that ran with the land. And they were able to take
[3:42:03.280 --> 3:42:08.640]  10% of this state back and actually in private hands now that can be developed for the benefit
[3:42:08.640 --> 3:42:13.480]  of people that live here. And they're doing that. They're doing it like on steroids. And
[3:42:13.480 --> 3:42:17.160]  the rest of the developments that are happening here are happening by companies from out of
[3:42:17.160 --> 3:42:21.560]  town, out of the country, prominently. And that's what I want to get into a little bit
[3:42:21.560 --> 3:42:27.920]  here because the national treasury is here. Our opportunity of the nation is here. The
[3:42:27.920 --> 3:42:34.000]  silent 20%, the forgotten fifth is Alaska and it's here. We'll be right back. This is
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:39.320]  Dr. Nick Begich and you're listening to the Info Wars because it is about information
[3:42:39.320 --> 3:42:46.320]  and you are the tip of the spear. We'll be right back.
[3:43:09.320 --> 3:43:16.320]  We'll be right back.
[3:43:39.320 --> 3:43:55.440]  There are a lot of signs that people are really waking up to the new world order and global
[3:43:55.440 --> 3:44:00.400]  government. But one of the biggest is privacy pouches. I've been selling these for more
[3:44:00.400 --> 3:44:05.520]  than 10 years. In the old days, they weren't 100% effective. Now they are. They're a little
[3:44:05.520 --> 3:44:10.760]  bitty lightweight Faraday cages that small phones and even large cell phones fit into
[3:44:10.760 --> 3:44:15.040]  very, very comfortably and then slip right into your pocket. And these things work great.
[3:44:15.040 --> 3:44:18.760]  That way you're not tracked, you're not traced by government, by big corporations, by big
[3:44:18.760 --> 3:44:24.000]  tech, by hackers, by criminals. They're selling your data. They're using it against you. AI
[3:44:24.000 --> 3:44:27.720]  uses this to be able to predict the future of manipulate markets. It's critical that
[3:44:27.720 --> 3:44:31.960]  everyone stop going around with your cell phones being naked. Well, I got to tell you,
[3:44:31.960 --> 3:44:35.680]  normally we probably sold a couple hundred a month. We're selling upwards of a thousand
[3:44:35.680 --> 3:44:40.080]  of these a day. Plus we have a good unit and it's also a good price. We have it in four
[3:44:40.080 --> 3:44:45.200]  different colors. It's the privacy pockets at infoarstore.com. People are really waking
[3:44:45.200 --> 3:44:49.560]  up. I'm seeing it all over the news that folks are aware of this and are now using these.

[3:45:58.040 --> 3:46:01.840]  can wear them out to political events. You can trigger live darts. But one of the biggest
[3:46:01.840 --> 3:46:08.520]  reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween. But
[3:46:08.520 --> 3:46:12.920]  on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you
[3:46:12.920 --> 3:46:17.200]  from COVID-19 or anything else. It's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared
[3:46:17.200 --> 3:46:22.280]  for the force of inculations and contact tracing that they're openly announcing. It's an active
[3:46:22.280 --> 3:46:26.840]  submission. It's an active like putting a burka on your head and bowing down. But a big
[3:46:26.840 --> 3:46:30.880]  reason to wear these is then in the stores, when people ask you why you're wearing a Halloween
[3:46:30.880 --> 3:46:37.320]  mask, say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing. And the M95
[3:46:37.320 --> 3:46:42.200]  mask only control what's coming in, not what's going out. So they quote spread COVID-19.
[3:46:42.200 --> 3:46:45.560]  They don't protect from it. So again, it's a great way to throw it back in these control
[3:46:45.560 --> 3:46:55.920]  freaks faces. You buy one for 9.95. You get four more free. They're at cost infowarstore.com.
[3:46:55.920 --> 3:47:14.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:14.600 --> 3:47:29.240]  Hey, thanks everyone for spending your time with me this afternoon. You know, I was talking
[3:47:29.240 --> 3:47:34.120]  about a lot of different things. And here's where I value the most. I had this discussion
[3:47:34.120 --> 3:47:40.560]  with one of my friends who's retired banker, fifth generation banking family or something.
[3:47:40.560 --> 3:47:45.080]  But you know what really is valuable? The most valuable thing on the planet, the most
[3:47:45.080 --> 3:47:51.520]  valuable commodity there is. And we all have it. We all have a limited amount of our time.
[3:47:51.520 --> 3:47:55.240]  And I want to say that because you share your time with me and I share my time with you
[3:47:55.240 --> 3:48:02.920]  on a Friday afternoon. And it's the most valuable thing. And I want to really say that loudly
[3:48:02.920 --> 3:48:10.120]  because as we go into our weekend and we decide how to budget our time, how to spend our time,
[3:48:10.120 --> 3:48:17.120]  how to disperse our life energy is what we're really saying. You know, and there's no greater
[3:48:17.120 --> 3:48:21.920]  sacrifice than to lay your life down for your brother, right? I mean, you hear that and people
[3:48:21.920 --> 3:48:27.080]  interpret that as, oh, that means I take the bullet for my friends. It's more than that.
[3:48:27.080 --> 3:48:32.000]  It's deeper than that. And that's really a limited way of seeing it, I think, because
[3:48:32.000 --> 3:48:37.520]  the real thing that that is saying is we give our time, our life energy, our breath, the
[3:48:37.520 --> 3:48:43.040]  breath of life that we are to each other. And that's where the rubber meets the road
[3:48:43.040 --> 3:48:48.680]  and change happens and the world changes when we recognize that. That's why it's so important
[3:48:48.680 --> 3:48:54.880]  to not be separated, separated by this wall that keeps getting pushed into our face. I've
[3:48:54.880 --> 3:49:01.320]  talked a little bit about slavery, people don't communicate. See, we lose that dimension
[3:49:01.320 --> 3:49:09.280]  of mutual understanding and support that human beings, all of us need. It's a basic functional
[3:49:09.280 --> 3:49:14.760]  thing about us. We're social beings. We have to be together. We need to be in each other's
[3:49:14.760 --> 3:49:21.040]  presence. We need to feel each other's energy. We need to have that happening. That's so
[3:49:21.040 --> 3:49:27.760]  basic to what we are and we can't lose that in this digital world right now. And I try
[3:49:27.760 --> 3:49:32.640]  to get it back into sort of the practical look at it. What's the big picture? What's
[3:49:32.640 --> 3:49:38.080]  the small picture? And Alaska, why I keep bringing it up is because within this region
[3:49:38.080 --> 3:49:43.540]  is also a hope. When you properly deploy that, which you're responsible for, which is our
[3:49:43.540 --> 3:49:50.160]  national resources, then maybe something different happens. But we don't usually have this discussion.
[3:49:50.160 --> 3:49:54.040]  Everybody talks about what I call the PNL statement, which is just the profit and loss
[3:49:54.040 --> 3:49:58.520]  statement. People don't know business stuff. But what it is in simple language is the
[3:49:58.520 --> 3:50:04.520]  money in and how it gets spent. Where does all the revenue come from and how does all
[3:50:04.520 --> 3:50:10.400]  go out? Just like your family budget. That's what it is. But that's all we ever talk about.
[3:50:10.400 --> 3:50:18.520]  We don't talk about the factory of that national wealth. What is that? That's all of this
[3:50:18.520 --> 3:50:24.920]  that moves into it, which is labor and creativity, which is called entrepreneurship and factories
[3:50:24.920 --> 3:50:29.800]  and things that make things called capital and land and natural resources. Now the land
[3:50:29.800 --> 3:50:35.080]  and natural resources, there's a lot of it that we allow to be developed under different
[3:50:35.080 --> 3:50:40.200]  theories of development, which we understand when they're equal. And where all of us have
[3:50:40.200 --> 3:50:44.840]  that opportunity as Americans, that it's not reserved for the elite, the wealthy, and
[3:50:44.840 --> 3:50:49.120]  the connected. That's what's happened too much. That's what everybody's really mad about
[3:50:49.120 --> 3:50:54.200]  when you get right under it. It's about the manipulation that we're seeing, that they
[3:50:54.200 --> 3:51:01.880]  call process, that they call procedure, they call the way we do this. Let me give you some
[3:51:01.880 --> 3:51:08.560]  words to kind of restructure how we use words a little bit. If I give someone a contribution
[3:51:08.560 --> 3:51:15.400]  and they're a politician, we think that's good. But if I give them a bribe, we say that's
[3:51:15.400 --> 3:51:22.600]  bad. What's the difference between the two? The words have a little bit different meaning.
[3:51:22.600 --> 3:51:29.360]  But what is the effect of the bribe? Politicians dance around and do what they're told. What's
[3:51:29.360 --> 3:51:34.240]  the effect of the contribution? Politicians dance around and do what they're told. So
[3:51:34.240 --> 3:51:43.720]  the outcome of the word might have some meaning. That's deeper than what's implied by contribution,
[3:51:43.720 --> 3:51:51.600]  perhaps it does. Because see, that's when truth gets into the words that we use. That's
[3:51:51.600 --> 3:51:55.680]  where a little bit of debate starts to happen. And that's the kind of debates that we have
[3:51:55.680 --> 3:52:05.240]  all the time. And here's the thing. Narratives are scripts. They're speeches that people
[3:52:05.240 --> 3:52:11.120]  write down because they can't speak from their heart. They're the framework that the poll
[3:52:11.120 --> 3:52:17.240]  and the focus group told them to err it. This is how too much of our communication is driven.
[3:52:17.240 --> 3:52:21.600]  It's not driven from the heart and the mind coming together and expressing. It's come
[3:52:21.600 --> 3:52:27.160]  from a manipulation. This is big difference. This is not persuasion. This is something
[3:52:27.160 --> 3:52:32.720]  different. This is the dark side of the use of words. How about that? This is when you
[3:52:32.720 --> 3:52:39.040]  don't speak truth, you know you have no truth to sell. We watched it play out locally in
[3:52:39.040 --> 3:52:44.840]  our homeless issue here in Anchorage. And we're watching that play out again because the public
[3:52:44.840 --> 3:52:50.320]  is not buying the narrative. They're being sold because it's false narrative. There's
[3:52:50.320 --> 3:52:56.600]  so many false narratives scattered on this template that's being imposed globally through
[3:52:56.600 --> 3:53:03.720]  the political parties nationally. In fact, I would suggest we need to scrutinize both
[3:53:03.720 --> 3:53:10.480]  major political parties. Okay, I'm going to say that because at the very top, we need
[3:53:10.480 --> 3:53:15.960]  to ask a lot of questions. How did Trump end up there when all these establishment guys
[3:53:15.960 --> 3:53:26.080]  didn't? Who at the top doesn't like that within the Republican Party? Perhaps a few. Look,
[3:53:26.080 --> 3:53:34.520]  all I'm saying is don't look deeper, pass the words into what they produce in actions
[3:53:34.520 --> 3:53:40.160]  because that's where the meaning of the words come out. The actions take it. So we have
[3:53:40.160 --> 3:53:47.360]  all this stuff coming from the left about human rights. Well, they're just trampling
[3:53:47.360 --> 3:53:54.480]  over the law all over the place. And here's it. There's a balancing act between all of
[3:53:54.480 --> 3:53:59.160]  our rights and the rights of the few. And we do need to protect the rights of the few.
[3:53:59.160 --> 3:54:06.560]  That's what makes America great and what will make it great again, but not making a war
[3:54:06.560 --> 3:54:13.480]  between those that have and those that have not, not by igniting hatred and dissent and
[3:54:13.480 --> 3:54:22.340]  selfishness and failing all of us in the fair and open dialogue that a Democratic Republican
[3:54:22.340 --> 3:54:28.080]  or great society requires, which is to be able to in a dignified way look at each other
[3:54:28.080 --> 3:54:35.560]  and say, what do we do? And how do we fix our problems? And what are the real solutions?
[3:54:35.560 --> 3:54:43.320]  Because the average person in my experience knows the truth when they hear it. They just
[3:54:43.320 --> 3:54:49.400]  do. We all do. It resonates with us. And when it's given an opportunity and this gets back
[3:54:49.400 --> 3:54:55.560]  to the last hour, locally, we can still do a lot and we can believe in it. We know we
[3:54:55.560 --> 3:55:03.280]  can. And that's the action I talked about this before. The mystery of faith is acting
[3:55:03.280 --> 3:55:10.080]  on what you know, absolutely, you can do. That's called faith. Even if it doesn't make
[3:55:10.080 --> 3:55:17.240]  sense to anyone else, if you know, you will do, achieve, succeed, because you can't see
[3:55:17.240 --> 3:55:23.400]  the failure of it. All right, that's, that's when you win. So I'm suggesting to everyone,
[3:55:23.400 --> 3:55:27.960]  do only that. Don't do the impossible. I've said it before. It's doing the impossible.
[3:55:27.960 --> 3:55:33.520]  Come on. How do you do what's impossible? Your brain already knows you can't. So it already
[3:55:33.520 --> 3:55:40.360]  shuts down the possibility. Know what you can do. Do that one step at a time. And before
[3:55:40.360 --> 3:55:47.960]  you know it, you've formed a trail, a path, yours, not mine, yours by knowing when you
[3:55:47.960 --> 3:55:55.600]  hear that inner truth ring, you act, you do, you seek, you know, that's where the power
[3:55:55.600 --> 3:56:00.640]  is, ladies and gentlemen. And all the rest of this discussion is about sort of the window
[3:56:00.640 --> 3:56:06.200]  dressing. Here we have a treasury, the national wealth thing, miss for lack of attention,
[3:56:06.200 --> 3:56:12.160]  for lack of focus, for lack of knowing, you know, we're buying narratives that are false
[3:56:12.160 --> 3:56:18.360]  from every angle coming at us all the time. And we need discernment more than ever. We
[3:56:18.360 --> 3:56:24.080]  need to seek information more than ever. That's what info wars is about. That's why this partnership
[3:56:24.080 --> 3:56:29.360]  with you, with everyone involved in this network works, because at least gives an opportunity
[3:56:29.360 --> 3:56:33.080]  to have a lively discussion and debate the way they should happen. The way they happen
[3:56:33.080 --> 3:56:38.920]  in my family, I can guarantee you, with Republicans and Democrats and libertarians and undeclared
[3:56:38.920 --> 3:56:44.400]  all packed in the same room, it gets exciting at the holidays. But at the end of the holiday,
[3:56:44.400 --> 3:56:50.080]  we embrace each other. We love each other just like Americans should. And I believe
[3:56:50.080 --> 3:56:56.240]  we do at our core. That's who we are for goodness sake. We just forgot for a while because
[3:56:56.240 --> 3:57:01.560]  these big agitators that would just like us to scream at each other so they can run away
[3:57:01.560 --> 3:57:07.880]  with the national treasury, we can't allow it. Americans, Americans need to remember
[3:57:07.880 --> 3:57:12.560]  we're not ours and we're not these were A's first, we're Americans. And we need to begin
[3:57:12.560 --> 3:57:19.040]  to behave with the dignity of our founding fathers when they disagree. Biger is public
[3:57:19.040 --> 3:57:25.600]  debate in the town square. But let's not take it to blows. Let's stop short of that.
[3:57:25.600 --> 3:57:29.920]  And let's take it to policy changes that make our country great again. Because that's what
[3:57:29.920 --> 3:57:35.400]  this is about. And that's the Info War, the 21st century. Let's make it great again. This
[3:57:35.400 --> 3:57:49.520]  is Dr. Nick Beggage. See you next week. Thanks for being here.
