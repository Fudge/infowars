[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:16.000 --> 00:27.000]  radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome to the Alex Jones show on this
[00:27.000 --> 00:32.000]  Thursday December the 5th 2013 I'm David Knight and I'll be filling in for Alex today we have a
[00:32.000 --> 00:38.000]  packed show Alex is going to be joining us later in the show but we're also going to be joined by Anthony
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  Gutiarty Leanne McAdoo and Gigi Arnetta we're going to be talking about a lot of breaking news today you
[00:44.000 --> 00:49.000]  know it's pretty it's pretty appropriate that we have the Empire Strikes Back as our theme song
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.000]  here is open up this hour because the top story at Infowars.com right now is the Chinese state
[00:54.000 --> 01:01.000]  media is bragging of plans to establish a Death Star moon base that's right as Paul Watson says it
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.000]  sounds like it's something out of the onion but they're actually serious about it and it's the Chinese
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.000]  official state media that actually draws the analogy they say that the experts in China or war
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.000]  gaming how the moon can be transformed into a deadly weapon like the Death Star in Star Wars
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.000]  and the moon could hypothetically be used as a military battle station and ballistic missiles could
[01:22.000 --> 01:28.000]  be launched against any military target on earth you know we need to have Alex here so he could do a spot
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.000]  on Darth Vader impression that he's able to do but he will be with us later but we're going to be
[01:33.000 --> 01:39.000]  talking about something else once he gets on this is set against really the larger rise of Chinese
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.000]  military aggression that we've been seeing over these islands and other places every government wants
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  to build up its importance and the Chinese government is no different from the American government
[01:49.000 --> 01:55.000]  they want to make themselves larger and bigger in the eyes of their people and they'll go to war if they
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  have to they'll create a war if they have to and that's something that we have to be on guard against
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  our very own government as well as other governments but there's also a big story today about Obama
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.000]  and you know he's trying to pretend that he is the friend of the working man friend of the working poor
[02:11.000 --> 02:17.000]  we've got this breaking agenda this week of the minimum wage fight and we've got fast food workers
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.000]  who are striking for increased wages and they're talking about how the minimum wage hasn't been increased
[02:21.000 --> 02:28.000]  for a very very long time well stop and think about that is that really the problem isn't a problem
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.000]  the fact that people's purchasing power has gone down that's why they're saying you need to have a rise
[02:33.000 --> 02:41.000]  in the minimum wage and what about the Trans-Pacific Partnership as Obama is saying that he's going
[02:41.000 --> 02:47.000]  to help the working poor by raising the minimum wage from seven to nine and now he's talking about
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  ten dollars and of course the people who are striking want fifteen dollars an hour minimum wage
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  as he's saying that he's going to raise that he is secretly secretly negotiating the Trans-Pacific
[02:57.000 --> 03:05.000]  Partnership which is going to do what it what has happened to this economy is that we all know
[03:05.000 --> 03:11.000]  jobs have been transferred out of this economy and as JFK said when a rising tide floats all boats
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.000]  well we don't have a rising tide but we have our trade deals that have basically drained the river
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  and what he's doing now is secretly negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership which is going to do that
[03:22.000 --> 03:27.000]  to a far greater extent than we've ever seen that happen before and he's going to put in all kinds
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  of protections for big pharma for big banks to make sure that they can speculate on derivatives
[03:31.000 --> 03:37.000]  without any kind of regulation from any country in the world this is all being done in secret
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  with 600 corporate lobbyists nobody who's elected from any government is allowed to do that
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  and the Obama administration has put through fast-track trade negotiation so that one person
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.000]  can secretly negotiate this without any oversight from elected representatives in the United States
[03:52.000 --> 03:58.000]  and this is happening worldwide so while he's doing this secretly under the table he's now
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  proclaiming that he's going to stand up for the working poor and he's going to raise the minimum wage
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.000]  and of course that's just going to set off more inflation we see that the dollar we're coming up to
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  the 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve what's happened to the value of the dollar over the last
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.000]  hundred years well it's lost about 99% of its value and that's because the Federal Reserve
[04:17.000 --> 04:23.000]  it's because of government borrowing and the Obama administration is bringing that on astronomically
[04:23.000 --> 04:29.000]  so the root causes are there yet nobody is looking at the root causes they simply see the superficial
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  symptoms of what's happening it's a real problem it's a problem that's going to be shared by everybody
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  throughout the economy it's not something that's just going to affect the fast food industry
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  when we see high paying jobs being moved out of this country when we see the manufacturing base
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  of this country being destroyed when we see all wealth being transferred to the bankers
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.000]  that's the fundamental issue it's not the minimum wage we're going to be right back stay tuned
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  we've got a big show today

[05:28.000 --> 05:34.000]  documented a 15 point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine

[08:31.000 --> 08:35.000]  welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex on this thursday
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.000]  december 5th 2013 alex will be joining us later in the show as well anthony gucciardi will be
[08:41.000 --> 08:47.000]  talking about how the government other people in the government are increasingly seeing obama as
[08:47.000 --> 08:53.000]  a burgeoning dictator there's opening talk on capitol hill we heard it from the from someone
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.000]  from the cato institute usually these think tanks are very guarded they're not throwing out over the
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  top rhetoric about people being dictators but we're hearing it from them we're hearing it from
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  constitutional law professors and of course we're hearing it from the opposition a lot of people just
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.000]  going to dismiss this as partisan politics there's a lot more to it than that we've never heard these
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.000]  kind of charges being made before and it's not just a matter of partisan politics there are some real
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.000]  substantive issues we're going to be talking about that with anthony gucciardi as well as alex jones
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.000]  i'm also going to be joined later in the show with leanne macadoo and ggernetta there's a lot
[09:26.000 --> 09:32.000]  happening today in the news we've got a top story on the drudge report the chinese government is
[09:32.000 --> 09:38.000]  openly talking about making a death star on the moon i guess we should have that clip from star wars
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.000]  where they say he says look at the size of that moon they say that's no moon luke you know i think this
[09:43.000 --> 09:49.000]  is exactly they're drawing the analogy not us they're saying that experts in china are wargaming
[09:49.000 --> 09:56.000]  how they could turn the moon into a deadly weapon like the death star in star wars to attack targets
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.000]  on the earth we also see the cia this is also coming up in the news we'll be talking about this later
[10:01.000 --> 10:08.000]  funding a project to assign a number to everyone in india sounds like something of the book of
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  revelations doesn't it it also sounds like something that the cia and darpa would be involved
[10:13.000 --> 10:20.000]  when and they are their venture capital company in cutel is backing this effort to do it in india now
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  just like the rest of our foreign policy do you think they're going to leave it there or is it a
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  test case like iran like afghanistan we see those weapons coming home we're going to see that
[10:31.000 --> 10:37.000]  weapon and make no mistake about it numbering everybody in a country is a weaponized use of
[10:37.000 --> 10:44.000]  information systems processing power and of course the big news is the increase in minimum
[10:44.000 --> 10:50.000]  wage that obama is talking about he wants to portray himself as a friend of the working poor in
[10:50.000 --> 10:55.000]  spite of what we've now learned about the effects of obama care the rates of obama care we see
[10:55.000 --> 11:03.000]  people losing hours getting transferred to part time jobs dumbing down the definition of a full
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  time job is 40 hours to saying that you work 30 hours or more we're going to consider you to be a
[11:08.000 --> 11:14.000]  full-time employee for the purposes of obama care and of course individuals can afford it neither
[11:14.000 --> 11:19.000]  can companies so people are having their hours cut so if they're going to continue to work the same
[11:19.000 --> 11:26.000]  number of hours many people in low income jobs are having to find multiple jobs to get the number
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.000]  of hours that they need that's just one of the ways that they're being attacked but of course as
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.000]  all this is being done as obama is parading around pretending that he's the friend of the working
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  poor and he's going to raise the minimum wage ignoring the fact of why the minimum wage has lost
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.000]  its purchasing power at the same time he's secretly negotiating a trans-specific partnership deal
[11:47.000 --> 11:54.000]  which is going to further gut the economy as these past trade deals like NAFTA have done
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.000]  remember Ross Perot talking about that huge sucking sound well it's going to get a lot worse
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.000]  because a trans-specific partnership steps up all of this activity that's been happening and it adds
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  other things like it adds protections for banks to engage in speculative derivatives prohibits any
[12:10.000 --> 12:17.000]  country from stopping that with legislation it asserts the controls through copyright that CISPA,
[12:17.000 --> 12:24.000]  SOPA, ACTA, PIPPA all these failed pieces of legislation were unable to do they're going to try to do
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.000]  that through this secretive trade agreement so it's going to affect our free speech rights it's going
[12:29.000 --> 12:36.000]  to affect ownership not just jobs not just wealth creation but it's going to affect ownership it's
[12:36.000 --> 12:44.000]  going to essentially move us further down this path of establishing a neo feudalism where a few people
[12:44.000 --> 12:51.000]  a 1% of a 1% own everything and that's including intellectual property and all the rest of us are
[12:51.000 --> 12:58.000]  slaveholders on the plantation so that's coming up and at the same time that's happening he's also
[12:58.000 --> 13:04.000]  talking about we've also got Democrats who are talking about raising the federal gas tax so this is
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  a quote from Obama's minimum wage speech that he delivered yesterday he went into one of the poorest
[13:08.000 --> 13:16.000]  areas of Washington DC they say and he said the combined trends of increased inequality and decreasing
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.000]  mobility pose a fundamental threat to the American dream our way of life and what we stand for around
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  the globe and I would say absolutely true I would agree with that except that everything that Obama is
[13:26.000 --> 13:34.000]  doing secretly without people paying attention certainly not the mainstream press is doing is
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.000]  increasing the inequality and decreasing the mobility now of course you could say the mobility is going
[13:40.000 --> 13:46.000]  to be decreased if they give you a 50% raise in the minimum wage but then they double your gas fees
[13:46.000 --> 13:52.000]  your gas taxes I think that that's going to decrease your mobility but of course that's not what he's
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.000]  talking about he's talking about social mobility being able to move up and down in the economic sphere
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  and that and inequality are what we're going to see happen with the Trans Pacific partnership and with
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.000]  these other things like Obamacare that are being put on to people how are we going to have a healthy
[14:10.000 --> 14:16.000]  economy when many people are losing their insurance being forced to buy mandated insurance that has a
[14:16.000 --> 14:22.000]  lot of sub items that they don't need and then they find that their insurance their monthly insurance
[14:22.000 --> 14:28.000]  bill is a size of what their house payment used to be or the size of a new car payment that's going to
[14:28.000 --> 14:34.000]  have tremendous effect on everyone on the entire economy it's going to take everybody down I mentioned
[14:34.000 --> 14:40.000]  the first segment it was John Kennedy who said that a rising tide lifts all boats well we're seeing
[14:40.000 --> 14:46.000]  the river actually drained by these economic policies that are in place with Obama and others
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.000]  they're also going to be taking your calls on these issues and others I want to hear what you have to say
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.000]  about minimum wage and about the Trans Pacific partnership especially because the people who are
[14:55.000 --> 15:01.000]  out there protesting about minimum wages they really should be protesting the Trans Pacific partnership
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  because that is so much more pervasive that is the core or they should be protesting the Federal Reserve
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  they should be looking at the root causes of this but people tend to get caught up in the shallowness of things
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  we've seen this Max Kaiser was just talking about Jeremy Scahill's new documentary Dirty Wars
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  and that was exactly the point he made he said Scahill's documentary goes around and tries to put a face
[15:23.000 --> 15:29.000]  on the suffering of war and does a good job of it because it's a well produced film but it's very superficial
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  and very shallow according to Max Kaiser I haven't seen the film I'm going on his review he says it doesn't
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  talk at all about the involvement of the banks it doesn't talk at all about the involvement of the CIA
[15:39.000 --> 15:45.000]  how can you not talk about the root causes of these wars and what is motivating these wars
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.000]  and really hope that you're going to have any kind of change and furthermore Jeremy Scahill kind of
[15:50.000 --> 15:57.000]  in this movie Dirty Wars according to Max Kaiser's review he says that he essentially gives a pass
[15:57.000 --> 16:02.000]  to the whole idea the whole purpose of the war by showing a lot of dangerous people that really
[16:02.000 --> 16:09.000]  in his opinion need to be killed so he's really kind of a neocon leftist and that's not really surprising
[16:09.000 --> 16:15.000]  when you look at who he's going to be going to work for this new globalist billionaire Pierre Omai
[16:15.000 --> 16:21.000]  I can't pronounce his name we'll just leave it Pierre Omai because that's kind of the reaction of everyone
[16:21.000 --> 16:26.000]  in the press when they see this they just get all glassy eyed and start talking about how wonderful
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  this guy is this eBay billionaire because I guess they think that they're going to get a job with him
[16:31.000 --> 16:38.000]  but there is something that the government can do right we shouldn't discount everything that they do
[16:38.000 --> 16:46.000]  because we learn now that Afghanistan is set yet another record production of poppy that's right
[16:46.000 --> 16:52.000]  things used for opium and heroin you know they had only 10% of the world's supply under the Taliban
[16:52.000 --> 16:58.000]  but after we came in and help them we've we've increased the supply to 90% of the world's supply
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.000]  is coming out of Afghanistan that was just last year they had a record now they've got another record
[17:03.000 --> 17:10.000]  and I guess no pun intended they have a chart here in this article from see what's the source on this
[17:10.000 --> 17:17.000]  at CNS news and says Afghanistan opium poppy cultivation reaches record high no pun intended
[17:17.000 --> 17:23.000]  that's the reason why we're there and you've got to understand when you look at these wars
[17:23.000 --> 17:32.000]  as the Jeremy Scahill documentary does to ignore the involvement of the CIA and the drug trade in Afghanistan
[17:32.000 --> 17:39.000]  to ignore what's really happening there to ignore what the bankers how the bankers profit from all of this
[17:39.000 --> 17:46.000]  that is a very shallow superficial analysis but of course if you look at that if you want to look at what's behind all of this
[17:46.000 --> 17:53.000]  then people like Jeremy Scahill will accuse you of being a conspiracy theorist that's what he's accused us of being
[17:53.000 --> 17:59.000]  now we've also got this story that I just mentioned from the CIA and their venture capital fund
[17:59.000 --> 18:07.000]  is the NQTEL fund they if you remember helped to start up a lot of companies like for instance Palantir
[18:07.000 --> 18:14.000]  now Palantir has a program that they created called prism they're saying that prism is not the prism that we learned about
[18:14.000 --> 18:22.000]  through the Edward Snowden leaks and yet its functions are exactly the same and their focus is really on the military industrial complex
[18:22.000 --> 18:28.000]  and in terms of looking at people's data and moving that data together and looking at trends
[18:28.000 --> 18:34.000]  collating what a person is doing on this part of the web and this part of their life and collating that with other things
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.000]  and building relational networks they've also were involved in trying to take down Glenn Greenwald
[18:39.000 --> 18:50.000]  that was also a leak that came out from WikiLeaks and we saw that Palantir was actively plotting to essentially assassinate his character
[18:50.000 --> 18:56.000]  that's a very dangerous thing because as Jesse Ventura has pointed out they first assassinate your character and then they assassinate you
[18:56.000 --> 19:02.000]  we've had no shortage of people leaving veiled threats that Glenn Greenwald ought to be assassinated
[19:02.000 --> 19:09.000]  so it's very troubling when we see NQTEL and DARPA getting involved in a lot of these projects that they're getting involved
[19:09.000 --> 19:14.000]  a lot of dark research and I think one of the dark things we see the robots that they're creating
[19:14.000 --> 19:22.000]  and we've talked to Dr. Noel Sharkey just recently about the killer robots but consider how they're looking at you as their inventory
[19:22.000 --> 19:29.000]  and consider not only how they look at everything that we do but now in India they're assigning a number to everyone there
[19:29.000 --> 19:39.000]  and this company that's called MongoDB they have a name for it it's called Aadhar and they are going to assign a number to everyone in India
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.000]  and do you think that's going to stop there or are they going to bring it home?
[19:43.000 --> 20:01.000]  we're going to be right back we've got lots more news to cover and we're going to be talking to Alex Jones later in the show stay tuned

[24:01.000 --> 24:22.000]  Music
[24:22.000 --> 24:32.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight for Leanne for Alex. Alex will be joining us later in this show and so will Anthony Gutiarty, Leanne McAdoo and Gigi Arnetta
[24:32.000 --> 24:39.000]  and we're going to be talking about the world waking up to Obama's dictatorship and it's not just his dictatorship
[24:39.000 --> 24:45.000]  we see that millennials are now waking up to seeing what's going on with the quote unquote affordable health care act
[24:45.000 --> 24:52.000]  seeing that it's a massive transfer of wealth from one generation to another but of course the biggest transfer of wealth
[24:52.000 --> 24:57.000]  is from the middle class of America to the insurance companies who wrote this
[24:57.000 --> 25:03.000]  that's what Alex has been saying from the very beginning that it was the insurance companies that were writing these regulations
[25:03.000 --> 25:10.000]  and now we see how that's playing out we see that the stock trends as a Don Salazar wrote an article on info wars
[25:10.000 --> 25:15.000]  showing that their stock prices had gone up by on average about a factor of 2 to 5
[25:15.000 --> 25:21.000]  just like we see the many reports of the insurance rates that people are seeing going up by a factor of 2 to 5
[25:21.000 --> 25:27.000]  they knew exactly what was going to happen with this they knew exactly where this was headed and it was built into their stock price
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  we can see how they're taking advantage of people's ignorance even through the Obama minimum wage talks
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  at the same time that he's setting up this trans-specific partnership
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  at the same time we've got Democrats saying they want to stand for the working poor we see them proposing
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  a $27 billion tax increase on gasoline
[25:44.000 --> 25:50.000]  who's that going to affect the most of course it's going to affect the people at the lowest level of pay jobs
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  they're the ones who have the highest percentage of their income in fuel taxes
[25:54.000 --> 26:01.000]  and as part of that we've got that on info wars.com it's Democrat tax per mile scheme surfaces again in Congress
[26:01.000 --> 26:09.000]  so it's not just raising the taxes per gallon of gasoline by about 80 some odd percent
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  it's also going to be looking at a project to tax us by mile
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  after they've told everybody that they want you to get fuel efficient cars
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.000]  and we're paying a lot more for fuel efficient cars and a lot of people have invested money in fuel efficient cars
[26:21.000 --> 26:26.000]  we had the buy back of the clunkers because we had to get more fuel efficient cars
[26:26.000 --> 26:31.000]  now they've completely going to change the rules of the game and taxes by mile
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  so those fuel efficient cars are not going to be as of course they're going to not get rid of the other tax
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  so they'll still tax you on the gasoline that you use
[26:38.000 --> 26:43.000]  they're just going to add this additional tax because they want to grind you into the dust
[26:43.000 --> 26:49.000]  and that's necessary when all power and all wealth is being transferred from everyone to Washington
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  into the corporations that they work for
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.000]  take a look at this now this is actually a story that was on NPR
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.000]  and they were talking about how banks are charging some people for their early pay loan
[27:00.000 --> 27:03.000]  they get kind of a payday loan so they they're out of money
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  they have to get an advance on their paycheck
[27:05.000 --> 27:11.000]  they're getting paid they're getting charged 180% interest rates in some cases
[27:11.000 --> 27:19.000]  and they had a hearing this summer when they ask a banking representative who represents six banks
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  and they said do you think it's appropriate for some of the most respected banking names to be making
[27:23.000 --> 27:30.000]  200% plus off of some of their customers and he said well firstly I don't accept that it's 200%
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  because it's a line of credit
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.000]  no wait a minute it's still 200% whether you call it a line of credit or you call it something else
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  he says it's not a loan it's a line of credit
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  if we were charging 200% for a home mortgage I'm with you that's too much
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.000]  but this is not a loan it's a line of credit
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.000]  come on come on that's semantics that's taking advantage of people's ignorance
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  that's exactly what Obama is doing with this minimum wage talk
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  okay he's going out and telling people don't worry we're going to raise you from seven to ten dollars an hour
[28:01.000 --> 28:07.000]  and everything's going to be just fine but ignoring why you need that raise
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.000]  why you have seen the value the purchasing power of your dollar go down
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  ignoring what he's doing in terms of gutting the economy with the Trans-Pacific Partnership
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  doing that in secret
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.000]  I'm old enough to remember when there were usury laws in this country
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.000]  it used to be against the law for banks to charge more than 10%
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  only the mafia loan sharks would charge people more than 10%
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  here you've got banks charging people for paycheck advances
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  charging them 200%
[28:38.000 --> 28:41.000]  I don't think the mafia did that 40 years ago
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.000]  but they're not as smart as these bankers because they can get away with it
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.000]  they go to Congress and they can say it's not a loan it's a line of credit
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  it's not a mortgage it's a line of credit so you know they play with these semantics
[28:54.000 --> 29:00.000]  and yet at the same time we see that the banking regulations from Chris Dodd and Barney Frank
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.000]  are shutting down all of the smaller banks that are competitors to these too big to fail
[29:05.000 --> 29:10.000]  too big to jail banks that are running everything we have now according to this article from
[29:10.000 --> 29:15.000]  it's a lot of people have talked about this this particular one is from personalliberty.com
[29:15.000 --> 29:19.000]  and they quote and they say the number of banks in the U.S. is at its lowest level
[29:19.000 --> 29:23.000]  since the Great Depression due to a combination of regulatory hurdles
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.000]  that are forcing many community banks out of business
[29:27.000 --> 29:33.000]  and we see that larger press outlets are saying well this is actually a good thing
[29:33.000 --> 29:38.000]  because it makes us more efficient you know that was the line of Rockefeller
[29:38.000 --> 29:43.000]  that he hated competition because competition was essentially a sin
[29:43.000 --> 29:47.000]  they don't want competition they want to shut down all the local banks
[29:47.000 --> 29:51.000]  and they want to shut down all the mom and pop stores that have only the largest ones
[29:51.000 --> 29:55.000]  we're on the march the empire's on the run
[29:55.000 --> 29:59.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:02.000 --> 30:07.000]  strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future
[30:07.000 --> 30:11.000]  how do I safeguard renowned author and expert Joel Scousen
[30:11.000 --> 30:15.000]  building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat
[30:15.000 --> 30:19.000]  they know that a massive nuclear attack is coming they want that attack to come
[30:19.000 --> 30:24.000]  Joel Scousen is renowned as one of the world's far most experts in strategic relocation
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  and the securing of your home
[30:26.000 --> 30:30.000]  what I tell people is that you do have time we talk about natural disasters
[30:30.000 --> 30:33.000]  the health environment we talk about pollution the water quality
[30:33.000 --> 30:36.000]  my personal experience about being in every one of these states
[30:36.000 --> 30:39.000]  most people won't even be ready won't be able to get out of town
[30:39.000 --> 30:41.000]  because there'll be absolute panic
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.000]  there is no preparedness without strategy
[30:44.000 --> 30:47.000]  this Christmas give the gift of preparedness

[31:00.000 --> 31:05.000]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[31:05.000 --> 31:11.000]  and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world
[31:11.000 --> 31:13.000]  guess what else is in the halogen family
[31:13.000 --> 31:14.000]  fluoride
[31:14.000 --> 31:17.000]  ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924
[31:17.000 --> 31:19.000]  the federal government did the right thing
[31:19.000 --> 31:22.000]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[31:22.000 --> 31:25.000]  it's the good halogen on the periodic table
[31:25.000 --> 31:31.000]  and the results are on record reports documented a 15-point IQ increase
[31:31.000 --> 31:34.000]  in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine
[31:34.000 --> 31:36.000]  bottom line iodine is important
[31:36.000 --> 31:39.000]  unbound clean in a glycerin base
[31:39.000 --> 31:43.000]  nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family

[32:10.000 --> 32:15.000]  and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food
[32:15.000 --> 32:20.000]  it has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies

[32:23.000 --> 32:28.000]  my patriot supply brings us their exclusive patriot pantry brand

[32:53.000 --> 32:58.000]  it is essential to prepare with my patriot supply today
[33:23.000 --> 33:28.000]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[33:38.000 --> 33:41.000]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight filling in for Alex
[33:41.000 --> 33:45.000]  and we're going to be joined with Alex and Anthony Goodsharty later in the show
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.000]  we're going to be talking about how the world is increasingly seeing Obama as a dictator
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  look at some of the trends that are happening here
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.000]  now we just had Michael Cannon from the Cato Institute
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.000]  come out and talk about how we're facing a real danger
[33:57.000 --> 34:01.000]  a violent revolution of people understand that the government feels like
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  they no longer need to obey the law
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  remember the Constitution they took an oath to
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.000]  that's what gives them their authority to govern
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  and if they ignore the Constitution ignore the laws
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  and just do whatever they please
[34:13.000 --> 34:18.000]  then they are essentially no different than a foreign invader
[34:18.000 --> 34:21.000]  but to hear the Cato Institute talking about that is pretty amazing
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.000]  and now we've got a couple of more articles
[34:23.000 --> 34:26.000]  we've got an article on infowars.com
[34:26.000 --> 34:29.000]  this is a congressman fears that Obama could suspend election laws
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  this is Representative Trey Gowdy out of South Carolina
[34:32.000 --> 34:36.000]  and this is what he says he says that the president can fail to enforce immigration laws
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.000]  can the president likewise fail to enforce election laws
[34:39.000 --> 34:43.000]  in other words if he can arbitrarily ignore immigration laws
[34:43.000 --> 34:46.000]  and that's just one category of laws that he's ignored
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.000]  then can't he just ignore the election laws as well
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.000]  if he can send troops into Libya without getting a congressional declaration
[34:54.000 --> 34:57.000]  can't he just suspend the election laws
[34:57.000 --> 35:02.000]  if he can get his signature piece of legislation like Obamacare passed
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.000]  and then he can arbitrarily say well I'm going to extend the deadline for this class of company
[35:07.000 --> 35:10.000]  I'm going to extend the deadline for individuals
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.000]  is that any different than a dictator?
[35:13.000 --> 35:18.000]  a dictator is somebody who essentially if you look at the meaning of the word
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  it comes out of dictate or speak
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.000]  and so essentially a dictator is someone for whom the law is in his mouth
[35:25.000 --> 35:29.000]  there is no external written controlling legal authority
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.000]  as Al Gore famously said one time there is no controlling legal authority here
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.000]  that's about the best description of Washington I've ever heard
[35:36.000 --> 35:39.000]  but Obama has taken it to all new levels
[35:39.000 --> 35:41.000]  just saying we're not going to enforce the immigration laws
[35:41.000 --> 35:46.000]  and now we have a and we'll talk about this in detail with Anthony and with Alex
[35:46.000 --> 35:52.000]  but we've got a law professor from George Washington University Jonathan Turley
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  and he's saying that the danger is quite severe
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  we see a concentration of power in every single branch
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  you know Rand Paul has talked about this
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.000]  he's come up with a law that says we're going to require the
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  I'm sure it won't get passed
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  but it would require the Congress to read the laws
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.000]  it would require them to do one subject at a time
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  and they would require them to actually write the laws
[36:13.000 --> 36:18.000]  because right now what they do is they pass this along to bureaucracies
[36:18.000 --> 36:23.000]  as Nancy Pelosi said we have to pass the law so we can see what's in it
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  and so they pass this along to the bureaucracies
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  and they're able to put the details in
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  and of course that's where the devil lies is in those details
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  so they really don't know where those details are going to be
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  they really don't know what's in it
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  and they want the bureaucracy to fill in those details
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  because if they were to fill in the details
[36:41.000 --> 36:44.000]  then they would have to take the blame for what happens
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  and if it's really bad they can pretend that they're the saviors
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  they can write in on the white horse and they can say
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  we're going to roll back this evil bureaucracy
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  whether it's the EPA or the IRS or some other group
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  they can let the bureaucracy take the fall for it rather than Congress
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  and Congress can pretend like they're the saviors
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  we see that happening with Representative Sensenbrenner now
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  here's a guy who is facing reelection
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.000]  and the wrath of voters who are angry about what we've learned
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  about the NSA through the Snowden leaks
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.000]  and of course that didn't start with the Snowden leaks
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  as Paul Joseph Watson has pointed out
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.000]  this has been going on since the 90s with echelon
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  we knew about it extensively at that point in time
[37:23.000 --> 37:26.000]  of course it had been happening earlier even than that
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  after September 11th and the passage of the Patriot Act
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.000]  we had four whistleblowers within the NSA
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  people like Benny and Drake
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  they went to the mat to stop this stuff
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  they knew that it was going broad
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  they knew that they were moving from what was called
[37:40.000 --> 37:43.000]  Finthread to another system that was called Trailblazer
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  that was going to be spying domestically
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  not just on foreign citizens but going to be used
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  to collect information on American citizens
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  so they followed all of the whistleblower
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  etiquette and stayed within the system
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  and one of them was charged with multiple felonies
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.000]  and pursued by the and persecuted
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  by the Justice Department for quite some time
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.000]  before he was exonerated that was Drake
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  but all of that was out there
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.000]  and yet we see that it's still surfacing
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  nothing is being done about this
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  and we now see people like Sensenbrenner
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  coming back and saying well even though he brought up
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  the Patriot Act he wants to come back
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  and say I'm going to reign in the government
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  that's exactly what they do
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  Obama is supposedly going to be helping us
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  because he's going to give us more time
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  before the quote unquote affordable health care act
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  bankrupts everybody by extending the deadlines
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  but he won't do the fundamental reform
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  which is to basically gut the thing
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  and have something that is actually a free market
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  which we didn't have in health care before
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  actually expanding people's choice
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.000]  actually expanding people's ability to purchase
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  and to save money through medical savings accounts
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  through information about who charges how much
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  information about what their success rate is
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  at a given hospital or a given doctor
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  but they hide these things from us
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  just as they're hiding the real economic consequences
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  and just before the break I was talking about
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  how the number of banks are dramatically shrinking
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  now this is a report that came out
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  this one is from the Wall Street Journal
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  it said the number of banks has fallen below 7000
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  for the first time since they began keeping track of it
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  in 1934 since the Great Depression
[39:22.000 --> 39:25.000]  if you watch the Drudge Report you've seen for a long time
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  that he'll put up 146 banks closed this quarter
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.000]  or 160 closed that quarter
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.000]  the number of small lending institutions
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  has been shrinking drastically
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  so that's down from a peak of 18,000 financial institutions
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  we're now down to below 7000
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  so we've lost two thirds of the banks
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  is that a problem?
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  yeah it is because remember when we had the bailout
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.000]  it was because the banks were too big to fail
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  remember when we had money laundering charges
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  and other things brought up other crimes
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.000]  brought up against HSBC and UBS
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.000]  we were told by the Holder Department of Justice
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  this year that they were too big to jail
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  he didn't put any major fines
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  they got a minor hand slap in terms of fines
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.000]  didn't pull their charter even though these are foreign banks
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  none of the officers went to jail
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  as anybody else would for these kind of laundering charges
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  so when you have banks that are too big to fail
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  too big to jail that is a big problem
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  and yet we see this from this Wall Street Journal article
[40:25.000 --> 40:28.000]  they said the consolidation could help alleviate concerns
[40:28.000 --> 40:31.000]  that an abundance of U.S. banks leads to difficulties
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  an oversight or a less efficient financial system
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  come on monopolies aren't efficient
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  except for the person who owns the monopoly
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  that's what Rockefeller wanted
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  that's what JP Morgan wanted
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  that's exactly what they're getting
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  and it's not working out very well for the rest of the country
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.000]  because the big banks and the 1% of the 1%
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  are running everything here
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  this is another quote from the article
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  there's no reason why we need many banks
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.000]  except if those smaller banks have a much lower return
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  especially if those smaller banks
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  have a much lower return on capital
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  well you know why they have a lower return on capital
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  because they're not charging people 200% interest rate
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  on payday loans
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  they're not ripping people off like the big banks
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  there's talk now they're going to charge people
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  for depositing money
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  and we've seen various schemes like that
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  from Bank of America
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  from JP Morgan or Chase
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  Morgan Chase
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  that's what the banks do when they get control
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  and that's a major part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  agreement that is being worked on
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  and of course Obama wants to have that done
[41:33.000 --> 41:34.000]  by the end of the year
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  just like he wants to have this
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  this increase in minimum wage done
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.000]  so as he takes, as he gives with one hand
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  a little bit to some people
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  that think that he's on their side
[41:46.000 --> 41:47.000]  and in their court
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  he is gutting the system
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  with the other hand secretly
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  and under the table
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.000]  now we've got a story here
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  that completely changed
[41:59.000 --> 42:00.000]  the direction that we're going
[42:00.000 --> 42:01.000]  going from banks to
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  looking at what's happening with the police state
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  this is something that I saw
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  really really disturbed me
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  this is a 14 year old
[42:09.000 --> 42:12.000]  who was tasered in the face
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  absolutely amazing pictures
[42:15.000 --> 42:16.000]  if you can see this
[42:16.000 --> 42:17.000]  it's absolutely amazing
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.000]  both eyes are blackened and swollen
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  he's got contusions all over his face
[42:22.000 --> 42:23.000]  it's horrible
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  he was shoplifting
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  $31.93 worth of merchandise
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  from a Walmart
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  now he was handcuffed
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  and he tried to run away
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  and they tasered him in the face
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  while handcuffed
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  and his mother was told that she
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  could not see him for quite some time
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.000]  it says the extensive lacerations
[42:44.000 --> 42:45.000]  of bruising and black eyes
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  were allegedly the result of him
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  having been tasered
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  and fallen to the ground on the pavement
[42:50.000 --> 42:51.000]  except if you look at his face
[42:51.000 --> 42:52.000]  both sides of his face
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  are beaten up
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.000]  his mother believes
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.000]  that he was beaten while handcuffed
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.000]  but to taser a child
[43:00.000 --> 43:01.000]  in the face like that
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  can't they run him down
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  I mean are they that out of shape
[43:05.000 --> 43:06.000]  if they're that out of shape
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.000]  why are they in the police department
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  but listen to the excuse that they gave here
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  they said the boy probably turned around
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  to see if the officer was chasing him
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  when the barb caught his cheek
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  said the district attorney
[43:18.000 --> 43:19.000]  with handcuffs
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  there was nothing to break his fall
[43:21.000 --> 43:23.000]  as his legs gave out
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.000]  well that's what happens when you taser somebody
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  they fall straight to the ground
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.000]  we've got another 17 year old
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  in Bastrop here just outside of Austin
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.000]  who was tasered because he was standing
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  in the way of a cop who wanted to get
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.000]  to a fight between two other people
[43:39.000 --> 43:40.000]  two girls who were fighting
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  and just tasered this kid in the back
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  according to the witnesses who were there
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  and of course he went down like a rock
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  hit his head on the concrete
[43:48.000 --> 43:49.000]  and is in a coma
[43:49.000 --> 43:51.000]  and was in critical condition
[43:51.000 --> 43:53.000]  I'm not sure what the latest on that case is
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  that was the end of last week
[43:55.000 --> 43:56.000]  the case of that
[43:56.000 --> 43:58.000]  and had students who walked out
[43:58.000 --> 44:00.000]  and protest there at the school
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  this is what's happening everywhere
[44:02.000 --> 44:03.000]  so the question to you is
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  I'm going to take some of your calls here
[44:05.000 --> 44:06.000]  the question is
[44:06.000 --> 44:07.000]  what are we going to do
[44:07.000 --> 44:11.000]  to rein in this out of control police state
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  how do we get that back
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  are some of you going to run for office
[44:15.000 --> 44:18.000]  and institute some reforms
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  because one of the things that never happens
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  is there's never any accountability
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.000]  on these police brutality cases
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.000]  we always see that these people
[44:26.000 --> 44:29.000]  are put on paid leave
[44:29.000 --> 44:30.000]  because of the unions
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.000]  and because of the government's
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  attitude anymore
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.000]  nothing ever happens to the officers themselves
[44:37.000 --> 44:38.000]  they're not fired
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  they're not personally held responsible for this
[44:40.000 --> 44:41.000]  at the very least
[44:41.000 --> 44:44.000]  can't we cut the budget of the police department
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  instead of putting that burden on the taxpayers
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  when they injure somebody like this child
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  excessively
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  instead of letting the police department
[44:52.000 --> 44:55.000]  just go on and buy another gigantic
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  piece of military hardware
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  from Homeland Security
[44:59.000 --> 45:02.000]  can't we have them take the fine
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  to compensate this victim out of their budget
[45:04.000 --> 45:05.000]  at the very least
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  if we can't find the officers
[45:07.000 --> 45:08.000]  if we can't hold them responsible
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  and move them out of the department
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  so the problem is when you tolerate that
[45:12.000 --> 45:15.000]  you're sending a message to other officers
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  that it's okay to do this
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  and at some point that has to stop
[45:19.000 --> 45:20.000]  and if your people
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  and your local city council
[45:22.000 --> 45:23.000]  and mayor won't do that
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  maybe you need to run for office
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.000]  and do something about it yourself
[45:28.000 --> 45:29.000]  let's take a call
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  we've got Eddie from Arizona
[45:31.000 --> 45:34.000]  Eddie, what's on your mind today?
[45:34.000 --> 45:37.000]  Yes, I just wanted to give a solution out there
[45:37.000 --> 45:38.000]  for your research staff to do
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  or info warriors in general
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  I know the book super class said
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  there were 6,000 people who ran
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.000]  the Minions for the 120 families
[45:47.000 --> 45:49.000]  I would like all their names known
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  and faces published with a blurb
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  about what they do
[45:53.000 --> 45:54.000]  and who they are
[45:54.000 --> 45:55.000]  we can kind of turn the rest around
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.000]  on its head like a fight club
[45:57.000 --> 45:59.000]  they all go out to eat
[45:59.000 --> 46:01.000]  they all have masseuses
[46:01.000 --> 46:02.000]  they all have private security
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  and I think if everyone knew
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.000]  their involvement
[46:08.000 --> 46:11.000]  in the basic destruction of our planet
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  and if we could actually get their names
[46:13.000 --> 46:14.000]  and faces out there
[46:14.000 --> 46:17.000]  kind of like the 52 cards in Iraq
[46:17.000 --> 46:18.000]  the most wanted
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  not to have a bloody revolution
[46:20.000 --> 46:21.000]  not to go killing police
[46:21.000 --> 46:22.000]  and people kill each other
[46:22.000 --> 46:23.000]  that's crazy
[46:23.000 --> 46:24.000]  but we need to let these
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  little tiny group of people know
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  we know who you are
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  we know what you look like
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  and kind of turn this thing on its head
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  I agree that's why it's very important
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  to have something like WikiLeaks
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  that's why it's very important to have leaks
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  like we see from Edward Snowden
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.000]  they're portraying him as if he was a criminal
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  and as if he was harming our national security
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  what harms our national security
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  is when our government acts as criminals
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  and so when you see these kind of leaks
[46:51.000 --> 46:52.000]  from WikiLeaks
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  you see these leaks from Ed Snowden
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  that's when we see what's really going on
[46:56.000 --> 46:57.000]  behind the scenes
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  we have people who will leak the proceedings
[46:59.000 --> 47:01.000]  of the Bilderberg group
[47:01.000 --> 47:03.000]  and we know now that that was
[47:03.000 --> 47:04.000]  that was something that was set up
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  and it's initial creation
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  they were talking about creating the EU
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  and the European Union
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.000]  and now we see these things being consolidated
[47:12.000 --> 47:15.000]  through the Trans-Pacific Partnership
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.000]  we have a lot of information
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.000]  the problem is is that people are caught up
[47:19.000 --> 47:21.000]  in the superficialities of life
[47:21.000 --> 47:23.000]  just like they're caught up in the minimum wage
[47:23.000 --> 47:26.000]  and they don't see what's really happening underneath it
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  let's talk to, thanks Eddie in Arizona
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  let's talk to Kyle in Canada
[47:30.000 --> 47:31.000]  Kyle, what's on your mind?
[47:31.000 --> 47:32.000]  How are you?
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  Doing good, what's up?
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  Just first want to say, God bless you and Alex
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  you guys do a great job
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  it's absolutely incredible
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  what you guys do every day
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  I just wanted to mention
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  the economic collapse
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  that's going to happen in the States
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.000]  and undoubtedly affect Canada
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.000]  is going to usher in the
[47:54.000 --> 47:57.000]  the Mark of the Beast system basically
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  they already pretty much have
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  the Mark of the Beast system in place
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  I don't know if they have it in the States
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  like they do in Canada
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  but if you pay with a pay pass in Canada
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  a credit card or a debit card
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  it operates on the same RFID frequency
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  that they're going to use
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.000]  in the chip that's going to go in your hand
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  or your head, it's unbelievable
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  basically it's just unbelievable
[48:25.000 --> 48:26.000]  what they've set up
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  Well did you hear the article
[48:28.000 --> 48:29.000]  that I was talking about earlier
[48:29.000 --> 48:32.000]  where the CIA helped to fund
[48:32.000 --> 48:33.000]  this project in India
[48:33.000 --> 48:36.000]  that's assigning a number to every person in India?
[48:36.000 --> 48:37.000]  I haven't heard about that
[48:37.000 --> 48:38.000]  it's just unbelievable
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  Yeah, and it's being funded by the CIA
[48:40.000 --> 48:41.000]  so you got to ask yourself
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  why is the CIA interested
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  in inventorying the people of
[48:46.000 --> 48:47.000]  of India?
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  Well of course it's because they're going to do it
[48:49.000 --> 48:50.000]  to the people of America
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  and we see this happening in multiple fronts
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  that's the other thing that you see happening
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.000]  is they don't attack in just one area
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  they will attack with multiple fronts
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  on something like identifying people
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  with RFID, numbering them
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  that is something that's going to come at us
[49:07.000 --> 49:08.000]  from multiple ways
[49:08.000 --> 49:09.000]  they never just have one strategy
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  they always have multiple strategies
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  Thank you very much Kyle and Canada
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  let's go to Ryan in Texas
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  Ryan what's on your mind?
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  Lots on my mind actually sir
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  but one of the main things I wanted to touch up on was
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  you mentioned how Obama wants to shift
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  the minimum wage equation
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  Yeah
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  Whenever I was in elementary school
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  I'm sorry I'm an accounted student at A&M Kingsville
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  but whenever I was in elementary school
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  our teachers taught us how to do
[49:37.000 --> 49:38.000]  proportional fractions
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  for example if gas is worth
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  $3 per gallon now
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  you put the denominator as
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  what is minimum wage right now?
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  $7.25 I believe
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  okay that's $3 over $7.25
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  equals to X over
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  whatever the new proposed minimum wage is
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  cross multiply and divide
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  and you will see the paradigmatic
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  equation shift based upon
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  the minimum wage increase
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  and most people aren't able to
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  process that type of
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  Well yeah you see that
[50:10.000 --> 50:11.000]  whenever they put out a sales tax
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  they always do that
[50:12.000 --> 50:13.000]  I remember you know
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  you can have a sales tax of
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  6% and they're going to change that
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  from 6% to 7%
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.000]  what they tell everybody
[50:20.000 --> 50:21.000]  the government tells everybody
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  and the media is their willing partner in this
[50:23.000 --> 50:24.000]  they say well we're going to have
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  a one penny increase in the sales tax
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.000]  it's like no you're not
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  you're taking a 6% tax rate
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  and you're changing it to a 7% tax rate
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  that's one sixth
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.000]  okay that's a 17% increase
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  it's not a one penny increase
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  they lie to people
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  and they prey on people's ignorance
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  just like I was talking about earlier
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  with extra payday loans
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  they charge people over 200%
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  and then when you call them on it
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  they say oh that's not usury
[50:51.000 --> 50:52.000]  that's not a loan
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  that's a line of credit
[50:54.000 --> 50:55.000]  we're going to be right back with your calls
[50:55.000 --> 50:56.000]  we're going to be talking about
[50:56.000 --> 50:57.000]  the minimum wage
[50:57.000 --> 50:58.000]  and we're going to be talking about
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  Obama as a burgeoning dictator
[51:00.000 --> 51:17.000]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[51:17.000 --> 51:20.000]  in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[51:20.000 --> 51:23.000]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  it's the good halogen on the periodic table
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  and the results are on record
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  reports documented a 15 point IQ increase
[51:31.000 --> 51:34.000]  in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  bottom line iodine is important
[51:36.000 --> 51:39.000]  unbound, clean, in a glycerin base
[51:39.000 --> 51:43.000]  nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family

[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  I'm David Knight pulling in for Alex
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  I'm going to be joining later in the show with Alex
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  and with Anthony Gucciardi
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  and we're going to be talking about Obama as dictator
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  that's increasingly how he's being seen in Washington
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.000]  and it's much more than just partisan politics
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  there's some real substance to this
[54:42.000 --> 54:46.000]  there's a real departure from the rule of law
[54:46.000 --> 54:49.000]  and there's a tremendous concentration of power
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  and we see an exponential rise
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  the number of executive orders
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  we're going to be talking about that in the third hour
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  with Alex and Anthony Gucciardi
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  and we're going to be joined in the next hour
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  with Leanne McAdoo and Gigi Annetta
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  also on the staff of the Nightly News
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  that's where you'll normally find me
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  we have Prison Planet TV
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  this is a good time of the year to sign up for Prison Planet TV
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  and support that every night through the week
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  we have a news broadcast there
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  it's something that you can share with friends and family
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.000]  up to 10 people can listen to that at the same time
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  and it helps to support our operation
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  that's what funds it
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  and you'll find on Prison Planet TV
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  as a subscriber you'll have access
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  in HD quality to all of Alex's
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  documentaries that he produces are there
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  so it's a great way to wake people up
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  it's something that you can pass around
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  as a gift this time of year
[55:37.000 --> 55:40.000]  now also I want to let you know that we have
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  Survival Shield is now back in stock
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  that's the nascent iodine
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  you may not realize that it used to be
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  40 years ago that people got at least
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.000]  725 micrograms of iodine on average
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  they just threw baked goods
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  because they used to use iodine
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  in the processing of baked goods
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  they took that out and you know what they did
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  they substituted it with bromides
[56:03.000 --> 56:06.000]  which are harmful to your health
[56:06.000 --> 56:09.000]  so there's a deficiency for most people
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  unless you eat a lot of seaweed
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  a lot of seafood
[56:13.000 --> 56:14.000]  you don't get very much iodine
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  it's essential for brain health
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  a lot of people in the office who take this
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  and actually feel the effect
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  feel it in their pineal gland
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  I don't get any feel out of coffee though
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  so I'm not typical of most people
[56:27.000 --> 56:30.000]  I can have multiple, multiple canisters of coffee
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  and I don't feel it
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.000]  but I know the importance of iodine
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  and just like any other supplement
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  I know that I'm not getting
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  it's something that I need to supplement my diet with
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  I'm not getting enough of it in my regular diet
[56:43.000 --> 56:46.000]  the American diet has changed quite a bit
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  in the last several decades
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  and if you're aware of what's going on with it
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  you're aware of your need to supplement
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  and you can pick that up right now
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  it helps also to support our operation
[56:56.000 --> 56:57.000]  it's an important thing
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  it's infowarslife.com
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  you can find our health products
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  that are being developed there
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  as well as the appropriate filter
[57:05.000 --> 57:08.000]  now it still has a 20% discount on it
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  at water 20
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  I think you can still get that offer
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  that's on the website there at infowarsstore.com
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  about the effect of minimum wage
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  and of course it's a very important thing
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  because according to statistics
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  70% more college grads are earning minimum wage
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  than a decade ago
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  and the US economy, even though it's recovered
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  5.7 million jobs
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.000]  out of the 8.7 million jobs that were lost
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  60% of all those jobs
[57:35.000 --> 57:38.000]  have been at the low income wage
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.000]  so if people lose a high paying job in a factory
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  and they now get another job
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  at a low paying fast food industry
[57:45.000 --> 57:47.000]  as far as the government is concerned
[57:47.000 --> 57:48.000]  that's not a problem
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  because we're just looking at the jobs right
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  but it is a big problem
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  because we see our country being transformed
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  from a manufacturing society
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  to a service economy
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  and we were told for a long time
[58:00.000 --> 58:01.000]  that was going to be great
[58:01.000 --> 58:03.000]  because we weren't going to have the pollution issues
[58:03.000 --> 58:04.000]  we're going to push those off
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  on to China and the third world
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  and of course we see that they have tremendous
[58:08.000 --> 58:09.000]  tremendous pollution there
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.000]  because there's no laws protecting the people
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.000]  who live there
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  they've got them working in unbelievable slave conditions
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  but that's exactly what they wanted
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  they took our high paying manufacturing jobs
[58:19.000 --> 58:21.000]  that gave us kind of a
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  self-sufficiency in our economy
[58:23.000 --> 58:24.000]  exported them
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  and they're going to be doing that in spades
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  with a trans-pacific partnership
[58:28.000 --> 58:29.000]  but don't pay attention to that
[58:29.000 --> 58:30.000]  let's focus on the minimum wage
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  because Obama's going to help you there
[58:32.000 --> 58:33.000]  we're going to be right back
[58:33.000 --> 58:34.000]  and we're talking about that
[58:34.000 --> 58:35.000]  in a little bit more detail with callers
[58:35.000 --> 58:42.000]  stay tuned
[59:06.000 --> 59:08.000]  that's why we've assembled the most vital
[59:08.000 --> 59:10.000]  and important preparedness items
[59:10.000 --> 59:12.000]  at infowarshop.com
[59:12.000 --> 59:14.000]  these are items that I did research on
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  that I personally use
[59:16.000 --> 59:17.000]  you've got the life straw
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  so you can turn fetted water
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.000]  into safe water anywhere you go
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  the K-Tor hand crank generator
[59:23.000 --> 59:24.000]  to charge up key equipment
[59:24.000 --> 59:25.000]  during power outages
[59:25.000 --> 59:26.000]  or out in the field
[59:26.000 --> 59:27.000]  strategic relocation

[59:32.000 --> 59:34.000]  they're a safe used by Homeland Security
[59:34.000 --> 59:35.000]  to protect yourself
[59:35.000 --> 59:37.000]  during any radiological event
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  hand crank shortwave AMFM radios
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  everything that we've researched
[59:41.000 --> 59:43.000]  and found to be the best is available

[59:47.000 --> 59:48.000]  we're getting prepared
[59:48.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  for you at infowarshop.com
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  Alex Jones
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  I'm rejoined at the bottom of the hour
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  with Leanne McAdoo and Gigi Annetta
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  we're going to be talking about the police state
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  and we just had this article that I mentioned
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  about a 14 year old boy
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  being tasered in the face
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  while handcuffed by police
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  his crime
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  $31.93 shop lifted from Walmart
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  I mean we're getting into the territory of La Miserable
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  you know we're taking people
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  we had a guy arrested by the school
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  because he hooked up his electric car
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  without asking anybody
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  and got five cents worth of electricity
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  so they arrested him
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  the police state is out of control in America
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  and we can't just look at these superficial aspects of it
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  the brutality that we see of it
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  or children getting tasered in the face
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  instead of being talked to
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  or chased down or whatever
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  we've got to look at what's underneath this
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  and part of what's underneath this of course
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  is the money that is being made
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  out of the prison industrial complex
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  we all know that
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  there was a massive prison program
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  that was built up in the wake of Reagan's
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  war on drugs
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  as he shifted from going after the suppliers
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  to the end users
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  as his Attorney General Ed Meese
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  put in the mandatory minimums
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  they started locking so many people up
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  and with the mandatory minimums
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  the judges had no discretion as to who they could let out
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  so they were letting out violent criminals
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  so they could keep
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  people who were peaceful marijuana users
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  who were growing marijuana in their closet
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  not doing anything to anybody
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  outside of their own little world
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  where they're operating
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  locking these people up for 10 years
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  15 years, 20 years with mandatory minimums
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  based on the quantity of marijuana
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  that they discovered in their houses
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  so they went on this massive prison building program
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  and of course the prison bed guarantees
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  as you can see in many cases it's been reported on
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  by if you will mainstream media
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  even talks about this Huffington Post
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  70% occupancy guarantees in California
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  many other contracts
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  with private prison companies have language
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  that mandates that they get at least a 90%
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  prison beds be filled
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  and so when those things are not filled
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  of course they get to take that money out
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  on the states
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  they have to make those guarantees
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  so there's a massive
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  incentive to put people in prison
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  so just like what we were talking about before
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  if Jeremy Scahill goes out and does a documentary
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  on the dirty war and he talks about the
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  the death and the suffering
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  of our foreign policy but he ignores
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  the root cause of it the profits behind it
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  he ignores that the CIA is getting
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  record high profits from
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  the drug trade in Afghanistan
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  hit a new record this year
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  2013 a bumper crop of opium products
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  for heroin
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  so they ignore that
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  that sort of thing they ignore what's really driving that
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  if we ignore the fact that we have these
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  private prisons that are demanding
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  that people be locked up for nonsense
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  we're going to continue to see
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  14 year olds tasered in the face
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  we're going to continue to see people thrown in jail
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  for quote unquote stealing
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  five cents worth of electricity
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  it's absolutely amazing
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  but of course people are not looking at what's behind things
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  that's what we've been talking about with the
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  minimum wage it's nothing but a head fake
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  and we've been taking some of your calls on that
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  let's real quickly let's go to
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  Frank in Michigan he's been holding for a while Frank
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  greetings and salutations
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  David it's an honor to speak to you today
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  thank you thank you for calling what's on your mind
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  what's all you were talking about the police state
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  and uh you know uh
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  real quick here I was in federal prison
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  I'm not a horrible person I was actually
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  a member of the Michigan boy show in Oklahoma
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  and they raided my house and found a 22 rifle
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  locked up in my
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  gun cabinet and uh
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  I had to do federal prison time I lost all my gun rights
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  and it was really all technicality
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  but anyway in federal prison
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  they have a
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  a faction called Unicorn
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  and there is an army of prisoners building stuff

[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  and all this stuff so there is a gigantic
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  profiteering going on
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  in the prison system
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  I was locked up with guys who were seven years old
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  getting ten years for pulling in
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  a ton too many eel off the you know

[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  and as we hear the empire strikes back
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  one of our top stories
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  is on Drudge today is
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  the Chinese state media is bragging of plans
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  to establish a Death Star
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  moon base we can't make this stuff up
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  folks we don't need to anyway
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  under the headline PLA dreams of
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  turning the moon into a Death Star
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  this is a quote from the Chinese officials
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  the moon could be transformed into a deadly weapon
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  like the Death Star in Star Wars
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  things just get more and more bizarre
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  but I wanted to keep Frank
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  from Michigan on the line
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  we just took his call in the last segment
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  I know a lot of people are getting a new segment
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  in the first five minutes
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  and Frank was telling us about his experience
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  in prison and how they were
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  using prisons for slave labor
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  now that's nothing new to our listeners
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  Alex has talked about that many times
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  but I wanted people to hear somebody
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  who's actually been there
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  and done that and seen it
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  Frank, what were they building
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  at the prison where you were working
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  and tell us a little bit about what kind of wages
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  people were getting paid there
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  they were getting paid the top wage
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  was 25 cents an hour
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  that was at McKean federal prison
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  in Pennsylvania and they had us making
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  furniture, stop signs
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  this is a giant industry
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  they have a welding shop
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  they have a metal manufacturing shop
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  and each federal prison has
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  a unicorn and that's the name of
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  the segment
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  of the prison that they have doing this
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  for and it's a huge industry
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  it is absolutely unbelievable
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  and it is slave labor
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  that was years ago, it's been 15 years now
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  and now when we talk about
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  FEMA camps and the such and the setting up
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  of things like that, if you look at a minimum
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  security federal prison
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  you're looking at a FEMA camp in my mind
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  it was an unbelievable industry
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  and paying people 25 cents
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  an hour, so there you go
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  we want to talk about minimum wage
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  but let's take a look at this prison thing
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  according to this article here from Huffington Post
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  they do put out some of the facts correctly
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  they say that there is a prison
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  barred guarantees that range between
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  minimums of 70% and
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  going up to 90%
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  so that's a guarantee and if they don't fill
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  the prisons, then the private prisons
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  will charge the state
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  and they sum this up by
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  saying such requirements create an incentive
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  for policy makers to focus
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  on filling empty prison beds
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  of course, it's about money, it's about
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  them not having to pay extra money to these
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  private prisons, although they're paying them
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  a lot per prisoner and then the prisons
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  the Unicor as Frank just mentioned
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  is paying the prisoners 25 cents
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  an hour to work as slave
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  wages and we like to think
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  about the fact that we've got better working conditions
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  here, we've got a minimum wage
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  and we're somehow maybe
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  better off than the people who are in Foxconn
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  but look at the prisons, that's
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  we've got prison labor, we've got slave
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  labor in the US and this is
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  how they break, even though they give you the facts
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  in the Huffington Post article, they break this down
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  they say, private prison corporations
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  emerged in the 1980s and 90s
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  at a time when crime rates were soaring
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  and states were scrambling to keep up with
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  surging prison populations, I'm sorry
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  it wasn't that the crime rates
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  were soaring, it wasn't that we were facing
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  dangerous crime, they
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  crime rates were soaring because they redefined
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  what crimes were, they took
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  victimless crimes, like people growing
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  marijuana in their closet
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  and they made that a mandatory
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  minimum, which meant that things
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  that you and I would think of as real crime
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  like people who were rapists
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  or violent criminals
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  would be turned out into the streets
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  so they could lock up these people who were
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  passively growing marijuana in their closet
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  that was what the quote unquote
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  crime rates were soaring in the 1980s
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  and 1990s, I'm surprised they wouldn't
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  point that out, this is Chris
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  Kirkham and this was back in September
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  this year, we did this article
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  that's exactly what Frank is talking about
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  how they, how we've got
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  prison labor here and nobody sees that
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  there's very few stories that are done on
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  that by the mainstream media, of course everybody's going to be
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  talking about Obama's compassion
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  for the poor, the working poor
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  and how he's going to raise minimum wages but they don't
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  talk about the reality of what's
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  hidden in this country
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  Aaron in Nevada, what are you, are you there?
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  Oh, he did, okay, let's go to
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  let's see, what's our next person here
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  I'm going to get my glasses on
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  Mark in Texas, hey Mark
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  are you there?
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  Yeah, hi David
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  What's on your mind?
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  A couple of things, first of all
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  about as far as police state goes
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  one thing I think we should really start
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  doing is we
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  start to
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  drastically cut the police
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  forces in this country
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  and start replacing them with volunteers
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  and
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  people doing kind of like a jury duty
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  type of deal
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  and maybe reserves
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  and all that and start taking away
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  some of that power, for one thing
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  why does a police officer, especially
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  in Texas, we're
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  pretty much the population's armed
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  prepared to defend themselves
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  why do you need police officers
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  to have off-duty authority?
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  They don't need it, they shouldn't have it
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  it actually takes away from the
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  you know, we're
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  equal under the law, there's no need for it
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  and
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  as far as states like New York
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  or maybe
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  New Jersey and a lot of California
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  now, people got a demand
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  of Second Amendment rights and then they won't
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  have to count in such
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  large police forces and powerful
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  police forces in the first place
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  Well, I agree but you know, that's something
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  that's very different than what the federal government wants
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  because the federal government is pushing this
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  buildup, they're pushing the fusion centers
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  they're pushing the
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  militarization of the police, bringing the
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  weapon systems and the vehicles that we've
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  used against urban populations
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  in Iraq and Afghanistan
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  bringing those home and encouraging the police
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  to not only hire
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  more police but even more troubling
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  is the mindset that they're encouraging
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  in the police and this is very much
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  visible when the
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  Info Wars crew went with Alex up to
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  Dallas at the
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  protest of the shutting down of the First Amendment
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  around the JFK
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  assassination up there, you could see the attitude of the police
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  there and you could see that these police
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  who came out and immediately started shoving
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  and punching people without giving
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  them any warning after the other police
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  had let them into the area and they're waiting to
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  proceed to the next checkpoint
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  these cops come out of the
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  of the Homeland Security
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  van that was there, you can see it
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  in the video, they come out of there so
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  these are the Dallas
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  sheriffs who are coming out of Homeland Security
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  it's a perfect metaphor
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  for what we see happening in reality throughout
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  the country and that is the federal
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  government changing
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  their rules of engagement if you will
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  with the civilians
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  we can even talk about it in that respect
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  they call people civilians as if they're
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  military, everything that they do
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  is on a military
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  model
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  so let's
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  go to Howie in Pennsylvania
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  Howie? Hey buddy, how are you doing?
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  Doing good, how are you doing Howie?
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  I gotta tell you, everybody loves when you host the show
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  man, but
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  man, I gotta tell you something, I watched
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  a VH1
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  special, it was called The Fabulous
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  Life of Billionaires
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  by God it made me sick to my stomach man
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  we really are screwed
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  I mean with the mega yachts
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  and the huge palaces and everything
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  I mean they are ducked in
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  I mean
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  there's no way to remove them
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  I mean some of them
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  they're mega yachts, they got their own
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  submarines and
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  bulletproof windows
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  and anti
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  missile defenses on it and everything
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  I mean what do you do man?
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  Well you know when I look at these
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  these protests in the Ukraine
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  there's an article on info wars
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  mass unrest in Ukraine amid
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  supposed tug of war between the EU and Russia
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  now
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  when you look at these videos
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  of what's happening with the police protest
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  what I saw, what I was pretty amazed
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  to see was a massive
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  massive group of protesters coming
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  up to a police barricade, a police line
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  and they had some concrete barricades there
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  and the protesters had a bulldozer
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  and they were very slowly, it wasn't
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  a violent attack on the police, but they were very
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  slowly pushing the police and pushing the barricades
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  back and the police were restrained by that
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  now, is it because the police
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  are just good guys, I mean
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  I'm looking at that and I'm thinking
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  they'd just be shooting everybody inside if this was America
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  they'd be handling it, the American government
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  in a situation like that would react
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  the same way that the Chinese government did
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  in Tiananmen Square in my opinion
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  I think we've gotten to that point in the United States now
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  but
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  when you see a massive group of people
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  like that and I can't say
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  that under all circumstances because when we went
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  down to the protest in the Alamo
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  when we had about a thousand
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  people down there with rifles
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  swung over their shoulders
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  even though most of those rifles, if not all those rifles
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  were unloaded, the police
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  kept their distance and they
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  just watched to make sure that nothing was going to happen
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  so it was, they didn't get
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  in anybody's face, they didn't harm anybody down there
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  until, until
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  most of the people were left
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  and then the last few people that were there
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  the police came up to them and started harassing them
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  which is why
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  we had that rally there in the first place
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  that's why Texas Open Carry sponsored
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000]  that rally along with other groups
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  was because when people are
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  by themselves, the police
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  because there's so many of them and because they feel empowered
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  they will threaten people's
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  basic fundamentals and
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  fundamental liberties and their rights
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  but when you have a massive group of people
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  just like we saw in the Ukraine
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  the police will keep their distance in most cases
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  and we need to educate the police
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  that's why it's a very important project
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  that the oath keepers have
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  to educate the police, to educate the military
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  so that there isn't some kind of a violent confrontation
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  you know, things were brought down peacefully
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  in East Germany
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  when the police there decided that
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  they weren't going to shoot people who were crossing
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  over the arbitrary fence
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  between East and West Berlin
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  that was the beginning of the end
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  of that tyranny there with the Stasi
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  and we can end it here in America
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  if people will stand together
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  and stand up to this but the first thing is
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  people have to understand
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  that there is an issue and right now
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  I just don't see that happening
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  most people are not really aware of this
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  except in isolated incidents like this
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  14 year old who was tasered in the face
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  and we're going to be talking to
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  Gigi Arnetta and Leanne McAdoo
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000]  at the bottom of the hour about this
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  but let's go to Bob in Florida
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  Bob
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  Hey Bob
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  Hey how you doing?
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  Hey sorry about that
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  I have some information for you
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  I'm in the healthcare industry
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  I'm a healthcare vendor
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  and there's a company called Reptracks
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  which is the top vendor credentialing
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  company that's installed in 5,000 hospitals

[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  across the country
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  and this company is owned
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  by a Chinese
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  security company
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  called BTC Electronics Corporation
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  and they make
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  all sorts of security
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  equipment, video camera
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  surveillance equipment
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  and they're in all the hospitals
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  they require all vendors
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  to provide some of their medical
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  records
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  require vaccinations
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  and they're essentially tracking all vendors
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  coming in and outside the hospitals
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  Wow that's amazing

[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  there's a reason why the US government is conducting
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  emergency drills simulating the collapse
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  of the US electrical grid

[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  and we're taking your calls in this segment
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  now in the next segment we're going to be joined
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  with Gigi Arnetta and with Leanne McAdoo
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  and they're going to talk about
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  the burgeoning police state
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  and the police there back down
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  we can see what can happen
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  if there's enough people that get together
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  we see the same thing essentially happening in Thailand
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  in Thailand they were told
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  that they had a bulldozer
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  just like the people in the Ukraine
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  and they were told that if they used that bulldozer
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  the police were going to shoot to kill
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  now it appears that they've had second thoughts
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  and that government has blinked
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  and backed down
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  there is strength in numbers
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  we've seen it in our protests
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  in Dallas they shut down a free speech
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  around the JFK commemoration
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  we saw that the police moved on people
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  the police that were being backed
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  by Homeland Security and the feds
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  moved on the crowd when it was at its smallest
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  in the rain and in the cold
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  and after people had been there for quite some time
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  we saw that happen
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  at the Alamo in San Antonio
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  they didn't move against a thousand people
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  carrying rifles but when you just had a few
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  straggling around there they no longer respected
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  their right to open carry which is
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  right here in Texas
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  now Alex is also going to be joining us
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  and along with Anthony Gucciardi
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  we're going to be talking about the
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  developing problems with Obama
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  not that it's anything necessarily new
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  but what's new is the rhetoric
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  that we're seeing from representatives
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  we're seeing it from think tanks
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  we had Michael Cannon
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  with the Cato Institute talking about the fact
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  that if Obama keeps ignoring the laws
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  that could cause
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  a violent revolution we see a law
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  professor from George Washington
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  University Jonathan Turley
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  a very respected law professor
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  saying that the danger is quite
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  severe from Obama the problem that we have
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  with the president is that he's
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  not simply posing a danger to the Constitution
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  he's becoming the very danger the Constitution
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  was designed to avoid
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  that's very strong language
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  we see an article on infowars.com
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  where a congressman
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  is warning that he fears that Obama
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  could suspend the election laws and he says
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  if he can suspend the laws on
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  immigration and nationalization
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  if he can arbitrarily
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  invade another country if he can do all these
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  things as if he was a dictator
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  not under the rule of law
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  not checked by any of the branches
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  of congress not under the Constitution
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  then why not allow him to
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  he certainly could
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  possibly suspend the election laws
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  and just make himself a perpetual dictator
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  but in this segment I want to
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  take your calls we've been talking about
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  a lot of things we've been talking about
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  the minimum wage increase that Obama
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  is putting out there which I think is
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  really a truly a head fake
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  if you want to ignore everything else
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  that's happening in the economy
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  the secretive trade, trans-pacific
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  partnership trade agreement that he's negotiating
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  but let's take some of your calls here
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  we've got David in Kentucky
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  David what's on your mind?
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  how you doing David?
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  doing good
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  well yesterday I was on my way to work
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  and we're about to drop our
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  we live in Indiana and we need to
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  cross the bridge to get into Kentucky
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  and the police followed us for about
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  two miles or so
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  I have my vehicle
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  is a New Mexico
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  vehicle that belongs to my father
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  and the
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  cops
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  that's
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  I'm sorry
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  I'd really like to hear your story but the phone is breaking up on you
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  let's go to David
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  in Texas David
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  yes how you doing
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  I was with you guys
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  Wednesday night and Thursday night
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  I didn't make it Friday because of the weather
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  but I was listening live
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  and when that melee began
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  and you know when Alex was talking about
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  watching one of them
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  push down a man with a little girl on his
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  on his shoulders and out
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  I remember that kid she was about
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  eight or nine years old
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  and it what really really
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  probably the most
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  it was probably my biggest fear
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  was the possibility that someone
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  careless I mean
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  whichever side would have fired
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  one shot I think that they would have mowed you guys down
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  yeah yeah
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  that's the concern
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  is that things can get out of hand
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  and it's just the
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  confrontational attitude of the police
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  coming up after one group of police
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  had let everybody the demonstrators
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  who were conducting themselves peacefully
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  and within these unconstitutional
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  guidelines that the
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  city of Dallas had put on free speech
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  so they were following all the rules
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  they weren't getting confrontational there
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  they were showing up to demonstrate to point out the fact
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  that the First Amendment was being
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  stopped
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  but you had this group just come up and start pushing and punching
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  without any warning and that's what we see
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  over and over again we see the police doing that with tasers
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  we see them doing that
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  down in Bastrop where they tasered that
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  17 year old child and he hit his
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  head on the concrete and a coma
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  possibly life-threatening
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  I'm not sure how that was resolved that was about a week and a half
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  ago that that happened
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  but it's amazing to see that and we're going to be talking
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  about that very thing in the next segment
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  with Leanne McAdoo and Gigi Arnetta
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  stay tuned we'll be right back and we're going to talk about
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  the abuse of police power
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  and what we can do to bring it in
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  and how it's different in other countries
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  because there are other countries
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  where that doesn't happen it doesn't have to
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  happen here and we need to make sure that
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  something is done about it we'll be right back
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  with Gigi Arnetta and Leanne McAdoo stay tuned
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  we're on the march
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000]  the empires on the run
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000]  why does the United States
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000]  spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000]  on healthcare why do we have the highest
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000]  cancer rates on the planet

[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000]  down to one thing we are
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  what we eat our food is
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000]  devoid of nutrition and processed

[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  seen here and in places like
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  Iceland but right now we've got
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  jacari Jackson live at

[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  understand about the larger economic
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  issues besides the minimum

[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  boulevard right here in Austin Texas
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  you can see the crowd right here right
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  before we went on air people were inside
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  actually inside the spot by chicken yelling
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  and screaming peacefully though
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  and I believe they've come out
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  I'm not sure if they got kicked out or what exactly happened
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  let's go ahead and see if we can talk to a few of these people
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  and see if they know or what
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  exactly their issue is you know what
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  they're out here for they want 15s to the fight
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  for 15 and we'll see you know
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  what their plan is to get that
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  excuse me sir what brings you out here today
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  I come here with the workers
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  defense project in solidarity with
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  the 5 for 15 campaign in solidarity
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  with our workers making 725
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  because you can't live on 725
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  and I'm really excited
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  this happening all over the nation and not only
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  in fast food industry you see it in
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  in retail and you know there's
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  a farm growers construction workers
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  everybody's fighting back because it's a time
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  where everybody's tired and we feel the
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  tide that change coming
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  but sir let me ask you about the devaluing
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  of the dollar because we have a lot of
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  I'm sure college students out here
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  you know let's say back in the 60s and so forth
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  somebody could work in a place like Popeye's chicken
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  on a minimum wage job or
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  you know a lower wage
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  and they could before to pay their tuition
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  they could afford an apartment and so forth
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  but now we don't see that do you have any idea why that is
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  I think that is
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  because wealth is
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  every time more and more concentrated
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  in a few
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  corporations
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  I think there's about 10 corporations
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  that have been merging and merging and merging
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  and that concentration of wealth
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  is you know
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  it's also organized like we are
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  and they are
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  passing all these laws are convincing
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  all these politicians to pass these laws
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  to benefit other corporations
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  they benefit a few let me
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  sir let me ask you if you know about the federal reserve
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  some
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  okay so the federal reserve
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  they have this thing called quantitative easing
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  where they basically print money out of thin air
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  they have nothing back in the money
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  which makes the dollars worth less and less
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  you know and while I have no problem with fast food workers
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  you know making more money do you think it may be
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  more effective to maybe have these type of protests
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  at the federal reserve
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  not instead
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  but in addition to this
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  I agree
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  ask him if he knows anything about the Trans-Pacific Partnership
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  sir have you ever heard of the Trans-Pacific Partnership
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  yes
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  can you tell me something about it
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  yeah as someone
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  I'm from Mexico
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  and seeing how the NAFTA devastated our country
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  I just
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  am really terrified about how
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  Trans-Pacific Partnership
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  I'm glad you brought up NAFTA because a lot of people don't know about this NAFTA thing
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  the NAFTA superhighway and all that
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  but sir we got to move around a little bit and I definitely appreciate your time
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  yeah you're welcome
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  that's good at least he knows about the Trans-Pacific Partnership
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  and of course it's not just the TPP
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  we've also got a transatlantic
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  free trade agreement
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  NAFTA
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  that's a good rowdy crowd
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  they simmered down a little bit but when we first got here
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  there's a lot of screaming and a lot of yelling
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  and
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  they want more than 725 so let's go out
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  and see if we can ask a few more people
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  excuse me sir
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  what brings you out here today
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  trying to get people in decent ways
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  that they can actually live on
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  and do you think $15 an hour would do that
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  it'll start
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  it's a good start on that
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  I mean obviously
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  725
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  it's a slow death at 725
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  so it's a good start
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  but not an end
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  what would you say to the critics
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  I don't have a problem with people making more money
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  but working at fast food isn't really something we want to pay
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  a person $15 an hour to do
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  I think people need a living wage
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  and I think $15 an hour
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  is a living wage
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  that work should get a living wage
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  a lot of these people
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  aren't moving on to some other job
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  a lot of these people the average age of the workers
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  I saw a sign was 29
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  that isn't someone that's
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  moving on they need money
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  now they need money for their lives
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  now and if they move on that's great
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  but if they stay there they need a living wage
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  ask them if he knows
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  that they're going to double the federal
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  gas taxes
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  are you aware that they're planning to double the federal gas tax
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  now
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  $27 billion
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  let me ask you one more question
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  speaking about raising money
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  did you know that in Fort Hood
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  they had some young ladies
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  resort to prostitution to pay their bills
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  and people were saying
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  if that's what the soldiers have to do
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  do you think the soldiers need more money
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  than these guys here at the fast food
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  they all need money
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  thank you sir
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  how you doing man
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  go from there
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  tell me what brings you out here today
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  just showing some support man
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  hoping to get the minimum wage raised up
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  if we can, great
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  hopefully if not getting it to 15
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  we can get it at least a little closer to that
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  do you work here at fast food
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  no I don't I'm from San Antonio
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  I just came to show some support
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  one of the concerns is
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  maybe people aren't living within their means
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  we see black friday people out going buying
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  x boxes and playing stations forward
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  what's the issue with the issues going on today
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  if people could show more restraint
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  when they're spending I'm pretty sure
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  there would be some change in their life
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  but people are going to buy what they want to buy
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  when they want to buy it
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  and without people
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  and maybe you don't work in fast food
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  but do you know if there's been a decrease
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  in people eating fast foods like Popeyes chicken
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  or McDonald's or anything like that
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  I certainly stopped eating it
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  why is that
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  well just because it's really unhealthy for you
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  do you want to ask about GMOs
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  do you think GMOs may be affecting things
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  they're in a big way
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  I personally
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  I'm not a scientist I didn't study it
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  but I've done a little research on the web
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  and looked some stuff up and apparently they're very bad for you
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  a lot of negative side effects can happen
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  when you start eating them
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  and I just got back from Italy
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  I was there for three months and I completely changed my diet
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  and then when I got back
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  I started incorporating the American diet
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  back into my diet and it just obliterated my stomach
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  I was knocked out for
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  a week or two man
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  now a lot of people start these off
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  as a launching pad to other careers
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  but here in the city of Austin
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  I'll know you from San Antonio
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  but here in the city of Austin some members of the Austin City Council
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  want to ban the construction
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  of new fast food restaurants
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  it was for the children of course
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  I don't think that would be that bad of an idea
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  I mean we have so many already
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  on almost every street corner
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  you have a fast food restaurant
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  and I think the quality
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  they're just going lower and lower
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  if they could maybe
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  come up with a universal
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  fast food that was actually
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  good for you to consume
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  like on Demolition Man
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  where the only fast food restaurant left was Taco Bell
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  alright that's great
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  thanks Ikari
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  we'll go back to you in the studio David
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  alright thanks a lot Ikari great report
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  it's interesting to see Leanne and Gigi
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  it's interesting to see how
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  there's not a lot of awareness
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  about the gasoline tax
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  so as you see the Obama
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  and the Democrats are offering
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  this one increase
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  to them they're taking it away
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  with the other hand right
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  just to see that out there
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  it's also just another blatant difference
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  between America and Iceland
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  you don't have the people there
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  fighting for a wage that will allow them
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  to live a decent
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  not even a decent life just to pay
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  minimum bills to survive
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  that's what they're asking for and you don't really see that
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  in Iceland
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  I really do feel sorry for the people that are there
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  I'm not trying to dump on people because they're working
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  in fast food and it is no longer
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  really an entry level position
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  then why though is because the economy's been gutted
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  by NAFTA
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  and it's now going to be gutted by the Trans-Pacific
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  Partnership we see the economic base of this country
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  being taken out but on the other hand
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  you can't just go out and
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  vote yourself a raise
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  I'm kind of thinking that Obama does
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  he thinks that he can just
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  speak on a website into existence
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  or buy it into existence with
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  $600 million I mean it's probably
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  the record amount that anybody has ever spent
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  for a website ever
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  and it doesn't do anything I mean it's still
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  just at the very basic the best you could say
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  is that some people are claiming that now
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  the front end is collecting the data
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  but then they have no idea
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  and they're dropping hints that the back
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  end of the system
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  throwing out garbage to all the insurance companies
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  and healthcare providers
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  well don't you feel protected though
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  I mean all your information will not only go on to the internet
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  it will be stored by the NSA
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  who's incapable of being secure and then you go on
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  and let the hackers in
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  that's why they're
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  paying off the insurers
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  look just take whatever you think you need
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  to just figure this whole debacle out
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  you figure it all out on your end
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  and then we'll just pay you and figure it all out later
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  who's really paying
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  well we were going to talk about
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  the police state and the budgeting police state
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  and kind of contrast that to Iceland but since we're talking about
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  economic issues
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  let's talk about the fact that Iceland is actually
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  forgiving mortgage debt for their population
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  that's what we were all told was going to
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  that's what the congressmen were called in
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  to the
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  offices and told that
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  if they didn't give the big bailout
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  that there was going to be riots in the street and that those bailouts
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  are going to be used to pay down mortgages
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  and of course they could have paid down
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  they could have paid off the mortgages of a huge percentage
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  of the population
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  I forget what the amount was but it was well over 50%
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  they're actually doing that in Iceland because
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  Iceland didn't cave into the bankers it's the only
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  country in the world that didn't
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  and they kicked them out they said get out of here
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  kicked out the politicians
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  that couldn't be trusted who were trying to get them
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  to use their taxpayer dollars to pay off
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  these too big to fail banks and they were like no
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000]  they said no, no, no
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  to a bailout
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  and contrast that to what's going on in Greece
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000]  exactly where people we had the report
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  that then the World Health Organization
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  walked it back but their initial report
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  which I feel is more
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  credible their initial report
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  said that there were people in Greece
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000]  that were self-injecting themselves with HIV
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  so they could get an additional
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  stipend each month because they couldn't afford
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  to eat they couldn't get any health care so
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  having AIDS would give them better health care
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  and give them an additional stipend
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  now you know they walk that back
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  and said well you know but that I believe
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  we'll go with the original
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  information that came out from the
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000]  organization and not with what they were told
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  to walk it back with we see that happening
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  even with CNN we see on Sunday
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  they go in and they test the new
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  and improved website and it crashes on them
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  while they're testing it and then the next day
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  their senior health advisor comes
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  on and just gushes over
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  how wonderful the front end
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  of the Obamacare website is so again
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  I would go with the initial report from
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  CNN on that but talk about
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  Iceland and the police state
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  well Monday
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  Iceland experienced their country
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  is kind of in a state of mourning
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  because they experienced for the first time
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  ever since they became a country
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  a police officer
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  killed a citizen
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  first time ever and so this is
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  just incredible to them so they're kind of
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  in this state it's incredible to me too
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  having lived in the United States where the violence
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  is so pervasive from the police and where they
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  treat us as if we're not
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  even a human
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  like they are absolute contempt
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  well the homicide rate in 2009
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  was one
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  wow
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  and the thing here and another thing
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  to just show how different it is
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  the police there they issued
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  an apology and they said the police
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  regret that this incident and would like
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  to extend our condolences to the family
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  of the man they didn't say we were wrong
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  in doing this but they said
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  it's you know we're sorry it's wrong to take
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  a person's life it's sad that this
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000]  it came to this I mean and then you compare
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000]  that with what is happening
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  in New York where the police officers
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  who fired into the crowd
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  both situations the victim
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  was mentally unstable
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  right and so here in New York
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  they fired into a crowd and injured
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  by innocent bystanders
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  and instead of saying oh my gosh we're sorry
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  they're blaming the man who was
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  unarmed and they're
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  making him take the
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  take the blame and be sued
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  oh yeah for the injuries and he was
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  unarmed did you did you see this
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  report that we did earlier about this 14 you saw
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  these pictures of this 14 year old who was
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  tasered in the face while he was handcuffed
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  isn't that amazing and you see
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  how child yeah exactly a child
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000]  and you see how both eyes are
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  swollen or swollen
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  and they said that happened because he hit
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  the hit the sidewalk it's his fault he
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  shouldn't have you know yeah
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  handcuffed and over 30 30
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  less than $32 worth of
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  shoplifting that that's the thing to me
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  is the lack of proportionality
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  any of this and the fact
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  that there's never any accountability
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000]  right and that that lack
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000]  of accountability no guilt no
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  is no apologies issued
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000]  it gives this God complex
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  where they feel they can do whatever they want
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  why do they even need to treat us
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  as anything other than their
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000]  slaves that they can taze in the face
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  and get away with it because there's
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000]  there is no accountability
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  and now we're arming them even more
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000]  giving them even more power
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000]  and in Iceland the registered gun owners
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000]  there's actually 90,000 registered gun owners
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  and there's only I believe 350,000
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000]  people maybe 325 I don't want to
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  almost a third of their population hasn't
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  so are you suggesting that maybe
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  if if people had
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  guns and
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  I am absolutely suggesting
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  a broad ownership of guns that might do something
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  to constrain the government
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  suggesting that maybe if the banks
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  don't run the go run
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  the country that that maybe it might be
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  better for the citizens in Iceland
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  yeah I mean it's a bold suggestion
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  but it's interesting because it is kind of
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  like a little laboratory it is what
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  we've been talking about it is what people
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  if they look at the problem they can understand
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  it analyze it and they know
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  that this is really the way that it should go but we can
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  actually see it being played out here
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  just like we could see the difference between
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  North and South Korea or between East and West
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  Germany we've had those opportunities
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  in the past or even between say
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  Hong Kong and mainland China we could see
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  how when people are allowed to be free
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  to the extent that they were free they were
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  also had healthier lives
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  are more prosperous they were happier
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  they didn't have these kinds of police state and yet
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  it's the police state that I see being
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  put on everybody I was
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  just amazed when I was watching you
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  were there in Dallas Leanne and and when I was watching
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  it what was amazing to
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  me was just the attitude of the police
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  leading up to that confrontation
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  the fact that there didn't seem
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  to be any connection with Alex
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  or anybody who would talk to them
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  and ask them legitimate questions I mean he wasn't
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  trying to trick them into some kind
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  of a trick interview or anything
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  just asking me where is such and such a place
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  or where can I even go to file a complaint
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  I've been attacked and they would just
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  stare straight ahead and not talk to them
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  yeah they're no longer public servants
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  and I think that they're quite offended
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  by that where I think the initial
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  definition for
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  to be a servant we might think of slavery
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  or something but it's actually an honorable
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  thing to serve and so now
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  they don't want to even be
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  associated with serving you
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  a citizen you know it's
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  it's completely a 180
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  from where it used to be
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  and here we're talking Iceland
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  almost a third of the population
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  is armed right they have guns
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  the police are unarmed
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  there's one special task force
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  that has guns and they're rarely
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  sent out they were obviously sent out
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  in this instance but that's the difference
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  the people there are not afraid
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  of their government they're not arming themselves
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  to overthrow a tyrannical
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  government at some point they're
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  they're in control they're
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  you know the people that they
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  vote to represent them
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  are actually representing them and not
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  the banks and even the police there
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  that were in Iceland during
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  the major protests that were going on
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  were standing there they weren't
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  pushing you know people around like Leanne
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  they weren't aggressive about it they stood
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  there and they stood the line but they didn't have weapons
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  they had you know I think they had
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  spray and maybe bully clubs they were just
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  they were just like
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  we're not gonna we're not gonna move on the citizens
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  they stood there and even if people were this close
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  they just they were nice they were nice
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  about it go figure you know
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  and then the whole idea that
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  they had a revolution that the people had
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  a revolution with pots and pans
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  wow that's that's amazing and we've
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  seen that happen before we saw that when
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  when East Germany came down we saw
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  that it was a peaceful revolution because people
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  showed up peacefully protest they were
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  informed and the police
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  decided that for once they weren't going
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  to shoot on order and that's
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  what's necessary is for the police to
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  understand that they're creating a world
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  that they're going to have to live in as
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  Alex has said so many times we're gonna be right

[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  has been phased out of our staple foods
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  and replaced with the halogen
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  bromine a practice now

[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  I'm David Knight and I'm joined here
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  in studio with Leanne McAdoo and Gigi Arnetta
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  we've got most of the
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  prison planet TV crew here
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  and we've got just had a report from
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  Secretary Jackson who was out on the street
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  talking to protesters
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  who were trying to get a minimum wage
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  increase you know we can't just vote
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  ourselves an increase but Obama
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  seems to think that he can just suspend
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  reality with his dictates and we're going
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  to be talking to Anthony Gucciardi
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  and Alex Jones in the next hour
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  about the increasing
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  accusations of Obama acting
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  as if he's a dictator even one congressman
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  saying that he's worried that
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  Obama might suspend the election law
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  because after all he suspended these other laws
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  he particularly pointed out
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  the immigration laws and Gigi
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  you were just going to you had an article
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  here about David Dewhurst our lieutenant
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  governor did I hate to jump to that now because
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  you mentioned it about Obama you know
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  he put up a special election committee
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  as an executive order this year and I don't
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  know if anyone was awake for that if you go
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  to the executive orders on the White House
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  page as you mentioned you mentioned that
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  it's very interesting that he put together
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  a special committee and then even altered
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  the amount of people that he had on that election committee
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  so yeah I smell a rat and not only
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  that they're talking about getting rid of the 22nd
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  amendment which would allow him to become
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  oh yeah they've been talking
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  well it's kind of frightening because
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  they've been talking about that for a long time even
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  for Arnold Schwarzenegger I mean they would love
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  to have a perpetual president up there
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  and one party or the other is bound
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  to do that pretty soon it's great
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  having everybody in here we like I said before
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  we have the pretty much most of
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  prison planet TV crew in here and it's important
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  for you if you're a listener
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  to support prison planet TV it's
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  something that you can share with other people
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  it's a great gift to give but
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  even if you just buy it for yourself you can share
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  it with up to 10 other people can listen to it
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  it's the way that we fund our organization here
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  the way we fund prison planet TV
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  and we've also got a brand
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  new product we've got
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  fluoride shield and
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  we've all of us have
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  water filters at home you were just
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  talking about this in the break and Gigi was saying
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  I love my water filter I have
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  the big one from Pro Pure
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  and I'm telling you I live out in the country
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  even though we have to get the municipal water
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  in our house
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  let me tell you that water is hard and icky
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  we run it through the filter and it's amazing
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  it tastes so good in fact the first
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  night that I had at my husband's board went from the tap
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  and then went from the filter just to see
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  if I would know I mean
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  that tap water basically came out
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  of my nose it was so awful
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  but the Pro Pure is amazing it tastes so great
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  my son brought
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  a glass of water to my wife
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  we were sitting there getting ready to watch a movie
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  and she looked at it and she goes
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  did you pour that out of the faucet
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  or did you get that out of the filter
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  and it's like oh I got that out of the faucet
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  no no no it's out of the filter
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  I mean you could see the difference
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  it was amazing and of course the water around here
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  is pretty bad but even if you don't live
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  on a municipal filter it gets out
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  a lot of stuff that's in your water
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  but this fluoride shield is a new product
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  that's all out with a water filter
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  well it's everywhere it's in the bread
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  that they're making if you go to a restaurant
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  it'll be used in everything
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  anyone that goes to get a latte
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  from their favorite coffee
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  you're ruining it for people no
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  it is everywhere you can't take your pro
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  pure with you everywhere
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  that's true yeah it's in a lot of different things
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  so that's a new product at InfoWarsLife.com
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  and those are the ways
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  that we support the operation folks
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  if you like what we're doing here
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  we've got prison planet TV subscriptions
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  documentaries are there as well as
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000]  a nightly news show
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  and Leanne and Gigi and I
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  all do that with Jakari Jackson
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  we're the hosts for that
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000]  and you can see our work there every night
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000]  we're trying to bring you news
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000]  and we were just talking about Dewhurst
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  and how they're trying to beef up the border
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000]  what's going on with that
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000]  Obama just wants to ignore the immigration laws
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000]  but they want to essentially create something
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  like a Berlin wall down there
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  to get rid of the TSA here in Texas
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  but Dewhurst wouldn't have it
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  so here we go again
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000]  so he's talking about a $60 million
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  upgrade to the border patrol
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  he's saying that they had a great
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  three week initiative that was called operation
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000]  strong safety
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000]  but now what he left out is in that strong safety
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  that basically it also involved
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  illegal searches
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  we're going to continue this right after the break
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000]  we're going to be back with Gigi and Leanne
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  and we're talking about immigration control
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000]  we're working for the CIA
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000]  oh boy
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000]  this is GCN
[01:58:45.000 --> 01:59:11.000]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:15.000]  you'll find the results of the
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000]  Iodine
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000]  and the results are on record
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000]  reports documented a 15 point IQ increase
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000]  in areas that had previously been deficient in Iodine
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  bottom line Iodine is important
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000]  unbound, clean
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000]  in a glycerin base
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000]  nascent Iodine was the answer
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000]  for myself and my family
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000]  you will find Survival Shield

[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex today
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000]  and I'm joining the studio with Gigi Arnetta
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000]  and Leanne Macadoo
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000]  we're going to be joined in this hour
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000]  with Alex Jones and Anthony Gucciardi
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000]  he's going to be coming up in the next segment
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000]  we're going to be talking about the increasing
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000]  buzz in Washington
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  about Obama becoming a dictator
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000]  we've got law professors
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  we've got people from
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000]  long-standing
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  reputable think tanks that usually take a very conservative approach
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  even though of course they're partisan
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000]  and we have congressmen pointing out
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000]  that if Obama can just suspend
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  laws like immigration laws arbitrarily
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  then he can of course suspend the election laws
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000]  that's the story on infowars right now
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  and we were just talking before the break
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000]  with Gigi Arnetta about
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  the different approach that our
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000]  former CIA
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000]  Lieutenant Governor here in Texas
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000]  is going to be talking about
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000]  Lieutenant Governor here in Texas
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  David Dewhurst has towards immigration control
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  what's he proposing to do?
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000]  60 million more he wants for the Board of Patrol
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000]  he wants to
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  have this incredible as he calls it
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  saturation but what he left out
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  and McGraw actually
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  pointed out is that he had
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000]  search and seizures of cars in this
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  three-week awesome operation that they had
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000]  so he's not talking about that
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000]  but McGraw is saying oh no we're not
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  we're not going to do that this time
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  and the thing is we've done reports
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  info wars is reported before
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  and they're just standing there
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  people just come on in
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  we have this situation now in America
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000]  where they're not really
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  on the video
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  we've got a guy just riding across the border
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  the Rio Grande there
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000]  we've got this situation now in the U.S.
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  where once they find somebody that's an illegal immigrant
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  they don't even bother to send them back
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  and yet we have this Constitution free zone
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  within about 100 miles of the border
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  pulling people over
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  and asking him for their ID
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  getting intrusive exactly
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  just ordinary people stopping us in traffic
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  and it's like they did in Nazi Germany
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  that's always been the hallmark of tyranny
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000]  to stop people and ask them for identity papers
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  the thing is he's wanting to
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  the 60 million is nothing to sniff at
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  that's a lot of money and who's going to pay for that
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  although I have to say
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  there's a quote I'd like to give you
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  a do-hurst quote here
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  it says that he said when we get through
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  the criminal price tag
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  I'm going to send an invoice to President Obama
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  so kind of
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  well he can pay that with all of those
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  tax payers I think
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  they can borrow the money and send that to Texas
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  I guess
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000]  getting back to the point where they just
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  if he's going to beef it up and saturate it
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  that means that they're going to do
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  even more of these police state tactics
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000]  that they've been doing
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000]  growing up looking at these
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  Nazi Germany thing it was always a hallmark
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  they were going into a country and they occupied it
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  and they would stop people on the sidewalk
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  and they would say your identity papers please
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  you even see it with the remakes
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  of Red Dawn
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000]  how did they depict tyranny
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000]  well of course everybody knows how you depict tyranny
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  you stop people when they're going about
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  not doing anything you make them guilty
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000]  you make them prove that they're
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000]  prove their identity to you and you collect
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  their papers so they have checkpoints
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  where they're looking at people's identity papers
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000]  that's the archetype for tyranny
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  that they've been doing throughout Texas and elsewhere
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  Ron Paul and others have said if you're going to let people
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  if you're going to block the borders
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  if you're going to turn it into a police state at the border
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  understand that's going to be used against you as well
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  right and Rob Dew pointed out
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000]  he was actually there taking that footage
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000]  of the guy crossing back and forth over the Rio Grande
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  and the cops that were there were actually
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  ticketing
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  they weren't ticketing the people coming back and forth
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000]  across the border
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  they were taking the young students
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  the young law students that were
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  going to get their checkpoints
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  because they knew that they could
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  get their quota met and get paid off
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  by these college kids
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  so they're not beefing up border patrol
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  to stop illegal immigration
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000]  everything is a head fake
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000]  we're going to raise your minimum wage by 50%
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  but oh by the way we're going to double the gas tax
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  that you pay the fees
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  and that's why they're going to raise
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  Obama's like we're going to raise their minimum wage
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  just because they need those low income people
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  to pay off their Obama Cure premiums
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  like it's not to help you
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  it's just like okay sorry I've
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  implemented this new tax
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  and this new law so we need to make sure you can pay it
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  absolutely
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  well thank you so much for coming in

[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000]  in the show right now I'm joining the studio
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000]  with Anthony Gutiarty from Storyleak
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000]  been a lot of news breaking today
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  we've got China saying that they would love
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  to create a Death Star on the moon
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  that's a story that's on info wars
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  from Paul Joseph Watson
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  Obama is going around talking about
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  how he wants to raise the minimum wage
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000]  to help the working poor even though
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  it's his quote unquote affordable health care
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000]  that's causing most of the working poor
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  to lose their full time jobs
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000]  and of course doubling the federal tax
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  on gasoline at the same time
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  adding a new tax
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000]  to track people the number of miles
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000]  that they drive that's something that's not really going to help out
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  the working poor too much is it Anthony
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  no absolutely not
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000]  specifically this new major story
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000]  that Obama his powers are so unprecedented
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  that even congressmen now are saying
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000]  Obama is enacting
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000]  dictatorial powers by saying that
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000]  yes I'll follow some laws
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  but overall I'll do anything I want
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000]  and the key thing here is
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  yet some of the congress people are saying
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000]  he could become a dictator
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  he could choose to suspend election
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000]  terms and everything like that
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000]  but the reality is he's already enforced
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000]  dictatorial powers we have proof of that
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000]  right now we're going to go over it
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000]  and see what he's done so if someone ever comes up to you
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  and you're in a debate
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000]  or you need to show someone what's going on
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000]  this is the key
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  Obama has already said the constitution doesn't matter
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  he has already used
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  dictator style powers to go ahead and do anything
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  he wants and they do it with the straight
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000]  face and they act like it's no big deal
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  from the NSA spying on you at all
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000]  times to the DHS saying you have no
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  constitution literally
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  they're doing this over and over again
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  and getting away with it because the people
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000]  are making out enough about it and even when they do
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000]  Obama just gets away with it
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000]  so why can't he suspend the election
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  why can't he say ok I'll run again
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  you know why can't he do anything
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000]  he could literally declare himself
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  a dictator today
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  and probably get away with it if we let him
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  that's why we need to push this into the actual news
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000]  and make it a headline but go ahead
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000]  absolutely look at just the indefinite detention act
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  where he signed that midnight on a
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  you know New Year's Eve holiday
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  said don't worry I'm not going to use it
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000]  it's totally unconstitutional
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000]  to start with to say that they could pick up
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  people and not charge them with anything
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000]  and hold them indefinitely as part of the NDAA
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  so we see an infrastructure of tyranny
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000]  that's being built but he's actually
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  ignoring laws that are already in place
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  I mean it's not some of this stuff is an infrastructure
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  that he's building which can and will be
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000]  used either by him or by other presidents
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000]  but there's other areas
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000]  where he's actually already violating the law
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  every single time they say don't worry
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  this is just for this thing we're not going to use it
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  for this and that like the TSA
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  now going to football stadiums
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  every single time they say that it's a guaranteed
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000]  100% lie and it's the opposite of the truth
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000]  look at example
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000]  the Department of Homeland Security
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000]  said that you know they're going to look at the
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  border to specifically combat
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  you know immigration crimes everything like that
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  the drug trade and pasted office
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  is a good thing then they come out and say
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  100 miles from the border
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  including oceans everything
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000]  within 100 miles of the border
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  is a constitution free zone
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000]  the fourth amendment does not exist
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000]  the constitution does not exist because it's on
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000]  a border of the United States
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  which is complete bogus I have an image here
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000]  if we could get a shot
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  where it shows this 100 mile border
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000]  and 100 mile border
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  that suffocates cities like Houston
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  and you know
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  cities like Los Angeles and Philadelphia
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000]  and Tampa, Florida
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  and St. Petersburg, Florida
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000]  that's not the border of the United States
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  but they still say it is
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000]  so they can get away with anything
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000]  on this border you don't have a constitution
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000]  we're only a couple hours away from these constitution free zones
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  and Obama permits this and supports it
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000]  and the DHS reviewed itself
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000]  and said it's 100% constitutional
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000]  because don't worry it's a border
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000]  and that's just one of the many things that Obama has supported
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000]  shows 100% dictatorial powers
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  against the constitution against the people
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  and we should just give them another term
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000]  well if you're going to set it up at 100 miles
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000]  why not make it 200 miles
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  or 1000 miles
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000]  and call that a border
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000]  I mean you let them set up this arbitrary border
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  and as we heard in the last segment
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000]  Rob Dew was saying
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000]  Leanne related the story about
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  what Rob Dew saw at the border
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000]  when he was there with Alex
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000]  filming people going back and forth freely
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000]  and the border people were not doing
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  anything about the authorities
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000]  were not doing anything about that
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000]  instead what they were doing was harassing
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  American citizens over petty violations
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000]  over on the other side
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000]  they were totally ignoring that law
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000]  and that's how selectively they were enforcing it
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000]  let's just put it like this
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  I needed to renew my passport
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  and I was told by the people
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000]  down at the capitol building
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000]  oh if only if you were an illegal immigrant
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000]  you'd be way quicker
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000]  I mean they don't even care
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  they only target us the actual law-abiding citizens
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000]  over and over again
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  it's kind of like the general public is a pinata
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000]  and Obama has this massive aluminum bat
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  backing it and the candy is coming out
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000]  every single time just destroying the Constitution
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000]  every hit is a strike against freedom
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000]  and liberty and if you can get away with it
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000]  the whole pinata is just going to break open
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000]  into a bunch of candy and they're all going to eat it
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000]  but what then?
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  the thing is we have to actually do something
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  and we can push this into the media
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000]  that's what this segment is about
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000]  going over the blatant crimes of the Obama
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000]  administration and Obama himself
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000]  and saying hey you know he already is a dictator
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000]  we can get him on this
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  hey we don't want a dictator
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000]  we don't want this and guess what we have control
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  here's one Obama gives himself
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000]  control of all communication systems in America
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  specifically he used
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  an executive order
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  this is from RT it's all over the news
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000]  and those have exploded under Obama
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000]  yeah this was back in 2012
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000]  he used an executive order to give the federal
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000]  government control of all communication
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  systems of course they say
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000]  it's an emergency
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000]  he signed an executive order on Friday
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  allowing the White House to control all private
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  communications in the country in the name of
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000]  national security
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  he released his latest executive order on Friday
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  July 6th a 2000 word
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000]  statement offered as the assignment of national
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000]  security and emergency
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  preparedness communications functions
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  and here it is for TV viewers
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000]  the actual executive order
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000]  on the White House website
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000]  so
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000]  executive orders have been abused over time
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000]  to give someone dictatorial power
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000]  in the face of opposition
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  from Congress which is increasingly
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000]  as they're admitting becoming irrelevant
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  and it's interesting that
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  that individual Zimmerman wrote an article
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  I believe it was the Washington time
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  saying that we should give Obama another term
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  and that we should eliminate
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000]  term limits and the Obama should be a dictator forever
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  well
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  he was looking at the history of the United States
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000]  back to Washington and saying that
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  yeah all these good people would have look how good
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  it would have been if Washington could have been president for longer
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  and all those things
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  he really needs to look back to Rome
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000]  and we're facing a Caesar type scenario
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000]  the Roman rulers
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  were actually given certain terms of power
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  until you know individuals
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000]  like Caesar came along and became absolute
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000]  dictators sure if George Washington
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000]  was maybe a president for another
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000]  term that might be a good thing but then you're
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000]  skewing the lines of the Constitution skewing
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000]  the lines of reality saying sure
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000]  one good person can come along but what about that
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000]  one corrupt person that's in power for hundreds of years
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000]  everything the founders understood
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000]  about Roman history and incorporated it
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000]  into this country is now being
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000]  backpedaled on and they're saying but we've had it
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000]  so good for so long everything's going to be
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000]  fine as they're completely dismantling
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000]  the Constitution the Fourth Amendment using
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000]  executive orders to control all communications
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000]  over and over again saying you don't live
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000]  in a Constitution area
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000]  stripping your Fourth Amendment rights and we're
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  supposed to believe that and allow him to prove
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000]  himself in another term and he's
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000]  going to probably do it if you know you know
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  you made the analogy to Rome
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000]  I think the point at which our Caesar
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000]  across Rubicon really was with the Patriot Act
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000]  and we see with that and
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000]  of course that was our predecessor but each
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000]  successive president
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000]  this is not a partisan political thing and people
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000]  need to understand this is very deep it's into
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000]  the entire infrastructure the bureaucracy
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000]  it's a long range planning of the corporations
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  that are running this Obama is
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000]  far worse than any other presidents
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000]  before him but I think we're going to continue
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000]  to see regardless of which party it is
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000]  we're going to continue to see this get worse
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  and worse each time because we've allowed them
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000]  to lay the infrastructure
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000]  for tyranny to assert that we
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000]  are in a war on terror which is
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000]  a quote-unquote worldwide war
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000]  and that includes America as
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000]  a battlefield that's a rationale for the
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000]  indefinite detention act so if they can assert
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000]  that we're at a war that's going
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  to last forever with an enemy that is
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000]  not really defined
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000]  then they basically have set up for themselves
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000]  a carte blanche situation
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000]  to pull off anything in this country
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000]  they're building themselves
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000]  a proverbial house of tyranny
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000]  and each individual president is laying
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000]  about five blocks under the house
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000]  and the foundation has already been set
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000]  by various government organizations and private
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000]  sectors they're laying the blocks
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000]  so we're looking at the blocks and freaking out that they're
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  building the house when the house has already been
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000]  built and will be continued to build
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000]  if we don't do something about it
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000]  and the key is we can push this
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000]  into the mainstream media though
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000]  that's the talking point as we've done time and time again
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000]  remember when Obama almost
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000]  brought us into war with Syria
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000]  into a potential World War III
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000]  scenario Obama himself was out
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000]  petitioning for it and saying we need to do it
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  we need to attack Syria even though
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000]  100% pretty much confirmed
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000]  the gassings were on behalf of the
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000]  Obama-backed Syrian rebels who go around
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000]  and behead Christians in public squares
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000]  and bathe in their blood and laugh about it
[02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000]  you know really good and of course we had
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000]  former congressmen like Kucinich
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000]  saying that we're going to
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000]  we're going to be the air force for al-Qaeda
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000]  Yeah and Lindsay Graham saying we're going
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000]  to be nuked if we don't attack Syria
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000]  and Iran as well. That's right.
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000]  So we have a president now that is
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000]  sparking World War III
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000]  and everyone that I talked to
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000]  I think the polls against it were
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000]  90 something percent
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000]  against going to war with Syria
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000]  yet he was still pushing it over and over again
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000]  I mean that enough is reason alone
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000]  hey this insane
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  dictator style lunatic is pushing us
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000]  into World War III but that's not enough
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000]  you know he's he's shilling for the NSA
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000]  he's talking about how great it is that they track everything we do
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000]  dismantling the fourth amendment
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000]  the DHS is great and they're also destroying
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000]  our constitution at large not even just
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000]  in amendments individually
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000]  so I am saying I'm putting forward
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000]  proof that Obama is not just
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000]  you know beginning to become
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000]  a dictator and enacting dictatorial
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000]  powers but this has been ongoing
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000]  for years years and years
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000]  and it's time to put all this information
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000]  forward and say hey we don't want
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  a dictator in this country we're not going to stand
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000]  for that you know there's bigger issues
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000]  as well but at the same time this is
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000]  the key if we can destroy and dismantle
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000]  the system that house will never be built
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000]  and I think it's key that we can win on
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000]  individual battles like Syria
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000]  but now we're starting to see people talk
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000]  about the bigger picture
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000]  as we saw with these hearings where Jonathan
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000]  was there we're going to talk about that right after we come back
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000]  can we get beyond this left right
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000]  here nine spectrum that they used to manipulate
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000]  us will be right back with Anthony
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000]  and Alex Jones be calling and stay tuned
[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000]  in the last
[02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000]  50 years iodine has been
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000]  phased out of our staple foods
[02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000]  and replaced with the halogen bromine
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000]  a practice now banned
[02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000]  in nations around the world
[02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000]  guess what else is in the halogen family
[02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000]  here in 1924
[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000]  the federal government did the right thing
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000]  and encouraged salt producers
[02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000]  to add iodine it's the good
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000]  halogen on the periodic table

[02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:21.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Shurn Show. I'm David Knight.
[02:24:21.320 --> 02:24:25.440]  Going in for Alex and I'm joined in studio with Anthony Gutiarty from Storyleak.
[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:31.520]  We were just talking Anthony about the obvious dictatorship powers that
[02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:34.800]  Obama is assuming. Of course this is something that's been going on for quite
[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:39.200]  some time. We can see this happening going back very very obviously with the
[02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:43.960]  Patriot Act under George Bush and it's sad to see people that were opposing it
[02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:47.840]  under George Bush following into it and saying it's okay as long as Obama is
[02:24:47.840 --> 02:24:51.440]  doing it. You know he's a benevolent dictator. He's in my party and we see
[02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:55.720]  the Republicans doing the same thing. The way they're playing us is with this
[02:24:55.720 --> 02:24:59.560]  partisanship but we're now seeing people saying things about Obama's
[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:02.400]  dictatorship that we've never seen before and I thought this was an
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:06.840]  interesting exchange that's on a real clear politics between a Republican
[02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:11.120]  congressman and a law professor from George Washington University Jonathan
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:14.720]  Turley. The congressman is Bob Goodlotte I think is how he pronounced his name
[02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:20.840]  from Virginia and what he said was that the balance of power is not about
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:24.080]  keeping one branch of government from usurping another. He said it's about
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:27.680]  protecting the liberty of Americans from the dangers of concentrated
[02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:33.320]  government power and then Turley came back and said yeah that's exactly he's
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:37.200]  doing exactly what the Constitution was designed to protect. He's becoming the
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:40.440]  very danger the Constitution was designed to avoid and that is the
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:45.320]  concentration of power in every single branch. There's no question and let's
[02:25:45.320 --> 02:25:50.040]  just put it like this there's been a systematic configuration of tyranny
[02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:54.720]  over the you know several you know presidents in a real concentrated way
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:58.200]  and they've been building this house of tyranny as we talked about before each
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:02.640]  one laying a certain amount of blocks into it but never before have we seen
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:07.400]  such a heavy concentration of just a nuclear fusion of tyranny as we have
[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:11.280]  with Obama and to put that into perspective with real hard evidence the
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:15.560]  writer of the Patriot Act the one that actually wrote it up he is actually
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:20.640]  petitioning petitioning now saying that the NSA is so out of control that not
[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:24.600]  only does it violate the Constitution but we have a serious serious threat that
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:29.360]  he's never seen before the guy that says a winner Patriot Act yeah I mean come
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:34.760]  on George Bush was no question bad very terrible absolutely tyrannical in many
[02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:41.320]  ways now we have Obama who is just the capstone of this pyramid I mean this is
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:47.000]  it's it's it's a level if we see you fast and furious we see Benghazi and
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:51.480]  then even James Clapper and others lying under oath to Congress nothing
[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:54.720]  happens to anybody no matter what crimes they commit nothing ever happens to
[02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:58.040]  anybody under this Justice Department so we're there they've given themselves
[02:26:58.040 --> 02:27:02.400]  that power I think the only hope is if people can not give someone a pass because
[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:06.120]  they happen be of the same tribe as them well that kind of tribalism is as
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:09.640]  partisan politics as well as identity politics right and the good news is though
[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:12.520]  at the same time we are reaching millions of people and they are waking up and
[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:16.680]  understanding all this and the key is you know like a sharp razor cutting through
[02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:20.400]  all the rhetoric and getting to the reality of it and pushing it past through
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:23.640]  the mainstream media and understanding everything but when we live in a world
[02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:27.520]  where when I go to the NSA data center in Utah and can't even go to the parking
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:30.960]  lot without getting arrested and threatened to be eaten by their dogs
[02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:34.960]  yeah I don't think that's a good thing and the only you know mainstream media
[02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:38.640]  that picks it up is the Salt Lake City Tribune and they asked me if I was
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:43.920]  trying to attack the NSA officers when I'm literally standing in a parking lot
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:47.400]  all documented on livestream and they said well were you trying to provoke
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:51.080]  them and attack them no I wasn't trying to provoke them and attack them I was
[02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:54.280]  trying to ask them a few questions and see if I get into this data center where
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:57.400]  they're spending billions and just having power failures and everything to
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:01.240]  see what's going on you know like a very bad American than I am well we saw that
[02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:04.960]  in Dallas as well we saw the Dallas Morning News come out and do basically a
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:09.640]  hit piece on Alex and the Info Wars crew that was there instead of being angry
[02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:13.280]  about the fact that the Dallas city government had shut down free speech
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:16.240]  the free exercise of spree free speech and you would think that a press
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:20.360]  organization would stand up for that but instead they attack other journalists
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:23.360]  who are protesting the attack on free speech yeah which is funny because I
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:27.680]  actually spoke to one of the journalists from the Dallas Morning News and she
[02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:30.760]  seemed to be very supportive at the time and then she went back and I guess her
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:33.520]  boss has told her you better not do a good story on them or you're gonna be
[02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:37.520]  fired so that's simply how it goes in this situation but my thing also is
[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:42.400]  seeing what people are watching on television they embody the main
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:46.240]  characters that are presented to be cool in television one example is this
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:50.280]  shows really popular now called community and always the main character
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:58.000]  the male in it is always this docile apathetic loser that is propped up and
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:03.720]  all the girls want him so when men watch the show or women watch the show they
[02:29:03.720 --> 02:29:08.560]  see this docile male that has no care about anything I mean literally in these
[02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:11.880]  television shows you know someone could be killed right next to them or you know
[02:29:11.880 --> 02:29:16.080]  something horrible could be happening but it's cool to not care it's cool to be
[02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:21.000]  apathetic and it's cool to go through life like a zombie and just have pure
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:24.880]  apathy and the women in the shows gravitate towards that of course in real
[02:29:24.880 --> 02:29:28.440]  life is the complete opposite but they aspire to be that that it's cool and
[02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:31.640]  people think that they're not stupid enough to the oh I can't be influenced
[02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:35.120]  like that that's what advertising is about why do you think the big mega
[02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:38.120]  corporations spend millions of dollars is because if they can show somebody
[02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:42.200]  that's beautiful using their product that's subconsciously has an effect on
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:45.480]  you will be right back with Anthony Gutiarty and Alex Jones will be calling
[02:29:45.480 --> 02:29:48.040]  hands so stay tuned

[02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:56.120]  subsidy like some media operations do or we could find a billionaire sugar daddy

[02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:17.600]  put out info wars life.com that were exclusively exclusively developed for
[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:23.120]  info wars by you and Dr. Group tell us about these exactly right so as many of
[02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:27.280]  you are probably aware I founded naturalsociety.com the third largest
[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:31.400]  natural health website and I teamed up with Dr. Group and ultimately in what I
[02:34:31.400 --> 02:34:34.800]  found to be you know years of research and Dr. Group's multiple decades of
[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:40.760]  research one of the things I realized was that there's no supplement that rips
[02:34:40.760 --> 02:34:44.160]  fluoride out of the body because we're constantly being exposed to it even if
[02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:47.960]  you're not drinking tap water you're eating organic food which oftentimes is
[02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:52.640]  made with sodium fluoride laden water the bread in organic products you know
[02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:56.040]  what do you think they're using to roll it all together it's the sodium fluoride
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:34:59.720]  based water supply almost every single time the vegetables that you buy at
[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:04.200]  Whole Foods that are sprayed with mists of water that's tap water I'm exposed
[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:08.400]  to sodium fluoride on a daily basis and you are as well David and the thing was
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:13.400]  I asked Dr. Group could it be possible to develop a fluoride shield a fluoride
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:19.360]  detox fluoride cleanse product that was in 2012 he said yes it is possible we
[02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:24.960]  got with Alex and we looked into it I mean I think he spent just 500 hours
[02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:29.200]  just looking at the ingredients that could be possibly used for this over
[02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:33.040]  thousands of them he selected about six of them that are absolutely key with
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:37.000]  tamarin cilantro zeolites the zeolites actually latch onto it so we can go out
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:42.640]  of your bloodstream and fluoride shield was the result which is exclusive to
[02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:45.880]  infowars life there's no other product like this just started selling it right
[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:49.720]  just started selling it yesterday and we have a limited supply we will be able
[02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:53.520]  to get another one in four to six weeks so you could either get it today or you
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:57.520]  will have to wait up to six weeks for new products I've been taking the test
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:01.720]  version and this version my thing is it tastes really good we've been giving it
[02:36:01.720 --> 02:36:05.380]  to other people around here and it not only does it taste good but the key
[02:36:05.380 --> 02:36:09.760]  thing is that actually works and we have a breakdown on infowarslife.com
[02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:13.960]  Alex's video introducing it as well as you click on fluoride
[02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:17.640]  shield you can read about how each individual ingredient works and what it
[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:23.760]  is everything like that as always non GMO made in the United States vegan not
[02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:27.480]  tested on animals gluten-free across the board the best products we could
[02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:31.720]  possibly find organically sourced and grown ingredients and then see we've
[02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:35.480]  never done this before but this is a dual launch to key products but the problem
[02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:39.040]  is supermail vitality we don't want to push it too hard because we only have a
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:45.480]  very very tiny amount of this and supermail vitality is in my opinion the
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:48.640]  key thing that's getting my health back on track when it comes to exercising I
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:53.520]  actually as some of you may be aware used to really be into working out used
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:57.240]  to really be in the natural health which I still am but since I've been so
[02:36:57.240 --> 02:37:00.560]  distracted by this madness in the world you know I've been gaining a little
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:03.960]  weight I've been losing my muscle mass I used to have 17 and a half inch arms
[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:08.840]  they've gone down substantially and I was you know depressed for a while
[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:12.680]  because I've lost all my muscle mass everything I've been taking the test
[02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:16.880]  version of supermail vitality for about a couple months now and my thing is when
[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:20.800]  I wake up actually want to go to the gym and that that's a breakthrough for me
[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:24.360]  and I'm so glad that I was able to work alongside Dr. Group bring it to Alex you
[02:37:24.360 --> 02:37:27.680]  know develop these key products I encourage every single person to check

[02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:43.520]  lower than the prices you guys are recommending over and over again he said
[02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:46.720]  I'm not going any higher which is crazy because if you look at our production
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:50.040]  costs you know we're not even making that much but he just demanded it which

[02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:20.560]  our operation if a war's health if a war's life.com exactly okay now we were
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:23.800]  talking just before the break we were talking about how they're modeling for
[02:38:23.800 --> 02:38:29.040]  people and how effective that is to model behavior in these programs to
[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:32.720]  alter the way people think about themselves the way they interact with
[02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:36.600]  people in society. It's actually funny it's related to supermail vitality
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:42.200]  they are turning all the key characters on major network shows into these
[02:38:42.200 --> 02:38:47.400]  effeminate males who not only don't want to have any ounce of masculinity and
[02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:49.960]  then they make the women actually really attracted that just look at Justin
[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:54.320]  Bieber I mean literally the key effeminate male he's actually pretty old he looks
[02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:58.280]  like he's 10 years old they have these television shows though where the main
[02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:03.280]  characters are apathetic they're dumb they're depressed and they are complete
[02:39:03.280 --> 02:39:07.800]  losers by design and then they go around and not they don't care about anything
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:09.960]  and they don't care about the women they don't care about their friends they
[02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:12.320]  treat their friends like crap and then the women in the show are like
[02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:16.000]  groveling to them and think in the show you know of course it's in real life it's
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.960]  the complete opposite but in the show it makes it look like that's sexy and
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:23.240]  that's cool so at a subconscious level if you watch television and it's not bad
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:25.720]  to watch a show here and there but if you're watching television all the time
[02:39:25.720 --> 02:39:29.400]  you're subconsciously soaking this in like a sponge whether you know it or not
[02:39:29.400 --> 02:39:33.280]  you're gonna go out and you're gonna demonstrate you're gonna project what
[02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:37.040]  many of those qualities as what you see on television those cool guys on
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:39.920]  television that get all the girls especially course the programmers don't
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:44.120]  want people with vitality with energy no other reasons why they're they're
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:48.000]  increasing the diagnoses of ADHD and that's why they're giving Ritalin to so
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:53.200]  many and especially to males it's a multi-pronged attack yes they want
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:58.040]  drones of zombies that don't care about anything and they want to make it cool
[02:39:58.040 --> 02:40:01.920]  to not care and that's one of the reasons we're seeing massive defeats but at the
[02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:05.560]  same time waking people up and activating their brain receptors they're
[02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:10.040]  coming out and being key winners in this entire fight then those people if they
[02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:13.440]  can catch them young enough they will give them you know ADD pills and
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:18.360]  Ritalin everything like that and Prozac but we are ultimately breaking through
[02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:21.680]  the programming and if we can have people realize this the subconscious will
[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:25.320]  not actively engage in it in such a deep level so if they realize when they're
[02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:29.040]  watching the television oh my god this guy's a loser I don't want to be like
[02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:32.040]  this guy at all I want to go out and be passionate look at people like Tony
[02:40:32.040 --> 02:40:35.760]  Robbins you know I'm not a huge fan or anything but those kind of people go out
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:39.200]  and they uplift people and you know some of it's good some it's bad but overall
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:42.000]  those people come out and they're successful why not even because of
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:45.120]  training programs not even because of seminars because they live passionately
[02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:48.520]  if you are passionate about something you care about something you get your
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:52.840]  health on track you will win you will succeed every single time if you're
[02:40:52.840 --> 02:40:57.000]  passionate the sad thing is the elite are passionate yeah we have to be ten
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:00.680]  times more passionate and they're passionate to have a passive submissive
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:04.320]  society a society of zombies is really what they're trying to do what they can
[02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:07.880]  do it with propaganda on television modeling the behavior for people or
[02:41:07.880 --> 02:41:10.920]  whether they can do it with chemicals that's their design they don't want
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:15.960]  competition from people stifle all individuals thought stifle all passion
[02:41:15.960 --> 02:41:21.440]  all desire and engagement have people living at this like low-level zombies
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:26.520]  zombified state and you will win the way to defeat people is to care even if
[02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:30.360]  it's caring about something dumb even if it's caring about a little activity or
[02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:35.160]  your local area anything that breathes more passion and an overall passion of
[02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:39.240]  a nation to get rid of Obama to impeach Obama to fight tyranny to reconquer
[02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:43.480]  liberty will meet major success absolutely let's let's take a few
[02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:47.480]  calls here we've got David in Kentucky's been hanging on for a while he's
[02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:50.960]  wants to talk about the police story David are you there
[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:57.000]  what are you doing well basically yesterday I got pulled over and you
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:01.760]  know the cops wanted to check my papers everything came in order and they followed
[02:42:01.760 --> 02:42:05.280]  me for about two miles trying to find the reason to pull me over because my
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:11.240]  license plate say New Mexico where my dad owns the car but they said the bracket
[02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:15.040]  was walking to Mexico well they go through there you know questioning of me
[02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:20.400]  and my fiancee and once they get to the point of saying is there any narcotics
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:24.800]  or weapons we should know about of course I said no because there was it they
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:28.480]  said well do you mind we take a look I said well I'd like to exercise my right
[02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:34.800]  of I was mistaken at the time I said I was a little nervous I said my fifth
[02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:39.200]  amendment right of illegal search and seizure then they started laughing at me
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:43.080]  and said you even know what right you're talking about I said it doesn't matter
[02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:47.240]  what right I'm talking about I know I have the right to tell you no to illegal
[02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:51.440]  search and seizure they got completely mad and said so does that mean you have
[02:42:51.440 --> 02:42:56.480]  something to hide I said no I'm exercising my right and I would like to be on
[02:42:56.480 --> 02:43:01.480]  my way and I had to tell them about four times before they finally let me go so
[02:43:01.480 --> 02:43:05.120]  they did let you go so they knew perfectly well which which Constitution
[02:43:05.120 --> 02:43:07.600]  they knew it was a fourth amendment not the fifth amendment they knew which ones
[02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:11.560]  are violate and they're and they're not going to let you but they did I'm
[02:43:11.560 --> 02:43:14.600]  surprised that they actually let you go that's great that's great that you
[02:43:14.600 --> 02:43:17.760]  support it seems like even standing up a little bit to some of these police
[02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:21.200]  officers they're literally like shaking and afraid they don't know what to do
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:25.560]  but what's interesting though is I've never had a police officer ask me if I
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:29.200]  had narcotics or weapons in the car ever it seems like if you're assertive
[02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:32.040]  with them but also nice and just say you know I actually know my rights they
[02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:35.440]  won't mess with you in many ways but at the same time some of the real power
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:38.440]  tripping people if you even mentioned the Constitution they'll like kill you
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:43.360]  yeah yeah that's why it's important to have some film backup I I like the idea
[02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:48.240]  of having some one of these online subscribing services like you stream that
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:51.320]  we use for Dallas and if you pay for a subscription some of these things you
[02:43:51.320 --> 02:43:54.960]  can get a live stream and you can say you're live right now on television you
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:58.480]  know I've got people who know me and that's gonna be recorded that's a key
[02:43:58.480 --> 02:44:01.520]  thing because they can take that phone away from you so get some kind of
[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:04.560]  subscription service and there's several of them out there where actually saves
[02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:08.360]  what you recorded as you're doing it I think that's a key thing thanks David
[02:44:08.360 --> 02:44:18.040]  let's go to Gray in Washington great great hey great hey how you doing oh
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:25.000]  great great I think you're on a speakerphone great can you take that
[02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:30.000]  speakerphone off sure yeah that's much better thank you go ahead I'm an artist
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:33.880]  I'm an artist up in Seattle I spent a lot of time thinking about the tyranny we
[02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:40.280]  live under and what we can do about it I feel most people are unaware of it but
[02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:46.220]  so it's kind of up to us who are aware of it to do something so I came up with a
[02:44:46.220 --> 02:44:52.320]  mantra after much meditation and that is I refuse to participate in crimes
[02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:58.200]  against myself or others and I think on religious grounds alone you know that's
[02:44:58.200 --> 02:45:03.360]  about all we have left and when they get with when they divorce our rights from
[02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:10.960]  us we're dead yeah that's right and so we have we have to not see the monster
[02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:14.880]  that's right it's very important that we stop and think this monster we've
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:22.240]  created this monster as well with our apathy and I think that you know it's
[02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:26.160]  time for us to fill up the jails you know that I think it's very important
[02:45:26.160 --> 02:45:29.960]  what you just said in the sense that Alex will say to the police you know you
[02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:32.320]  got to live in this kind of society that you're building and when we were
[02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:36.840]  talking to Noel Sharkey the other day I was saying that it's important to go to
[02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:41.440]  make this these these problems of what robots could be used for in a way that
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:47.160]  they could be used to conduct war against populations to for for civil unrest
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:50.800]  but we need to talk to the engineers it's not the politicians so much that I
[02:45:50.800 --> 02:45:53.800]  think we're going to get anything from but we need to talk to the people who
[02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:57.000]  are actually making this possible just like talking to the police or talking to
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:00.440]  the sheriffs and saying this is a society that you have to live in think
[02:46:00.440 --> 02:46:03.600]  about the ethical consequences of what you're doing here when you create this
[02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:08.200]  robot for DARPA this isn't simply a science project this has real-world
[02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:12.400]  ethical consequences that are gonna be far reaching for you and everybody that
[02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:16.560]  you know not to mention you're actively participating in this entire beast system
[02:46:16.560 --> 02:46:20.880]  yes you are apathetic or when you feed into it for example when you go you know
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:25.360]  and you go and watch television all day and watch the mainstream news you're
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:28.520]  feeding into their advertising market or you know you're reading the garbage
[02:46:28.520 --> 02:46:32.960]  mainstream news on a daily basis and you're not sharing real alternative
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:36.720]  medium that's right we can dominate them and completely destroy them but it
[02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:41.160]  requires readers you know it requires a massive fan base which Alex has here on
[02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:44.560]  you know the Alex Jones show and also on infowars and everything like that and
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:47.880]  even you know smaller alternative websites are just blowing up but if you're
[02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:51.840]  feeding into the system on a daily basis or if you're a government worker and you
[02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:55.200]  know what you're doing is wrong I mean some of the NSA people send emails and
[02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:59.680]  say I know what I'm doing is wrong but I have a family to feed what I mean you're
[02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:02.280]  feeding first of all you're feeding them GMOs and garbage that the government's
[02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:05.800]  giving you anyway but on a secondary basis you're not gonna be feeding them
[02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:09.720]  for that much longer if you know you continue to destroy this country and run
[02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:13.400]  it into the ground you're part of the beast system you are actually to blame
[02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:16.840]  when you're feeding into it the only answer is you're right the call is
[02:47:16.840 --> 02:47:20.840]  right the only answer is to not partake in any attacks against ourselves and
[02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:23.560]  others because guess what when you're with that system you're attacking
[02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:28.040]  yourself too on average I think the biggest targets by the establishment are
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:31.640]  those that work with them the police the military and the government workers all
[02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:35.960]  three of those categories of people are under complete siege in ways that us
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:39.680]  you know citizens are in those categories don't even understand from the
[02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:43.840]  actual shots to the testing to the insanity I'm testing plutonium and
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:48.000]  syphilis and all this insane stuff the anthrax shots they're actually being hit
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:52.880]  and targeted way more than we even are and we've seen the absolute contempt for
[02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:56.000]  people in the military from those in power like that that are not that kind of
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:01.760]  a dog to be used in foreign policy they saw that like Lee trash and join in and
[02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:04.640]  I'm not you know they treat them like animals there's a lot of great military
[02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:08.520]  listeners everything like that they're awesome people I'm saying you don't get
[02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:12.840]  power from joining the system and thinking oh I'm in the system so you
[02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:15.680]  guys are losers and I'm just trying to feed my family and you know I'm
[02:48:15.680 --> 02:48:19.800]  ultimately powerful you need to understand that they have nothing but
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:23.520]  contempt for you and once they put in the robotic police force the first people
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:26.880]  gonna come after are the police it's just like when a dictator comes in first
[02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:29.880]  people he goes for are the congressman that he wants to get out of I mean we've
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:34.400]  seen that over and over again if you talk to a high-ranking police officer
[02:48:34.400 --> 02:48:38.400]  they'll tell you the veterans they're afraid of the veterans the government
[02:48:38.400 --> 02:48:41.960]  issues warnings yes because they gave them the training the government gives
[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:45.640]  to the military personnel and they're afraid to even unleash them on society
[02:48:45.640 --> 02:48:49.200]  because then they say oh the veterans you know they know how to use this this
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:52.560]  they know how to create a bomb they know how to blow up a bridge whatever all the
[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:56.240]  stuff so they demonize them over and over and over again so first they bring
[02:48:56.240 --> 02:48:59.760]  you in and say yes you're a great asset to the country and then they betray you
[02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:03.680]  and say you're the number one enemy and all the police forces have been put on
[02:49:03.680 --> 02:49:06.880]  alert to you know always watch out for veterans because they've been trained by
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:09.600]  the government in the same training and they're deathly afraid of anyone they've
[02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:12.760]  actually trained that's right we say that happening over and over again thank
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:16.680]  you gray and Washington for calling it let's go to purple in Arizona somebody

[02:54:15.440 --> 02:54:21.200]  your phone calls let's go to ryan in west virginia ryan hi guys hey hi guys
[02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:28.800]  which guy i am i'm a college student here at wvu and morgan town the night a
[02:54:28.800 --> 02:54:33.400]  couple callers ago a guy called in about a cop issue and this wasn't this was not
[02:54:33.400 --> 02:54:37.840]  what i was originally calling in about but um i was pulled over one night for
[02:54:37.840 --> 02:54:44.720]  not having a tail or my headlight was out which was you know a reason to be
[02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:50.960]  pulled over the cop insisted that he smelled marijuana in my car which was
[02:54:50.960 --> 02:54:55.920]  not the case it was a little after midnight then he proceeded to say that
[02:54:55.920 --> 02:55:02.760]  i was nervous and i whenever he asked to surf the car i said don't you need a
[02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:07.640]  warrant and he said well now i'm just asking for permission and i said well
[02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:11.760]  you know you don't have it you know i said because you're making this up and
[02:55:11.760 --> 02:55:16.040]  it was like you know somebody let the air out of me like completely looked like
[02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:20.360]  he was deflated looked down he said well he said i'm gonna have to let you go he
[02:55:20.360 --> 02:55:27.320]  says because the dog's eating right now yeah i mean the cop issue around here's
[02:55:27.320 --> 02:55:32.040]  unbelievable i mean he didn't tell you the dog was gonna eat you when i went to
[02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:35.640]  the end of saying we were arrested he told me that uh now i'm lucky that i
[02:55:35.640 --> 02:55:39.520]  didn't go up to the actual center there the little building where there was
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:43.760]  parked cars and stuff because the dog would have completely eaten me if i went
[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:47.080]  up to the little area over there so i'm surprised he didn't tell you that the
[02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:51.320]  titanium to his dog was going to kill you well you know i think it's important
[02:55:51.320 --> 02:55:54.960]  to always just stand up for rights even if they take us down even if they
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:55:57.920]  ultimately prevail i mean just like going through the airport you know i i
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:01.880]  just will not cooperate by going through the machines i'm gonna make it a little
[02:56:01.880 --> 02:56:05.000]  bit more difficult for them even if it makes it more difficult for me to go
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:09.240]  through the pat down you know we just have to stand up for our rights let's go
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:16.320]  to thanks let's go to craig in new mexico craig hi i have a police issue
[02:56:16.320 --> 02:56:21.040]  also back in the spring i went to the pharmacy and i was carrying my gun
[02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:25.040]  because there's always junkies asking people if they have anything good for
[02:56:25.040 --> 02:56:32.400]  sale and another cover cop was behind me and who actually you know said hi to me
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:36.320]  and shook my hand at the time and i didn't realize he was a cop until i was
[02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:41.200]  leaving and the pharmacist told me that i had none the cover police officer
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:45.520]  behind me when i was leaving for whatever reason and as i left he told the
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:49.920]  car who i was who went back to the station and looked me up found that i had
[02:56:49.920 --> 02:56:54.640]  a ticket that i had paid everything was cool
[02:56:54.640 --> 02:56:59.680]  he came to my house said that i had a warrant out for me for not paying the
[02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:03.280]  ticket i showed him the courtroom paperwork
[02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:08.560]  and the cancel check they still hauled me off to jail
[02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:15.120]  they charged me 282 to get out and they also when i went to get the
[02:57:15.120 --> 02:57:21.360]  money back they told me that they had 280 dollars worth of fees and if i wanted
[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:24.560]  to fight it i had to sign this paperwork which
[02:57:24.560 --> 02:57:29.600]  basically put me on probation telling them i had to give them a urine test i
[02:57:29.600 --> 02:57:33.280]  was subject to certain seizure and this is what they put me through at the
[02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:36.160]  station also and the treatment at the station was
[02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:38.640]  unbelievable that's what we see over and over again
[02:57:38.640 --> 02:57:41.920]  that's what we see over and over again craig is that they will add additional
[02:57:41.920 --> 02:57:44.560]  charges to people you're talking about them coming after you there was a
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:48.400]  businessman just outside of atlanta and somebody called the police because there
[02:57:48.400 --> 02:57:51.120]  are a lot of indigent people that were laying down on the sidewalk they call
[02:57:51.120 --> 02:57:54.880]  the police to deal with that he had a permit to carry a gun it was his
[02:57:54.880 --> 02:57:58.080]  property and they arrested him for watering they didn't want to he said
[02:57:58.080 --> 02:58:02.160]  i've got a gun they uh told him that he had a gun when they when they asked
[02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:04.800]  and he said i've got a permit for that they didn't care they took that they
[02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:09.280]  even told towed his car so uh it's it's amazing we see that over and
[02:58:09.280 --> 02:58:11.520]  over again every single time and then you actually
[02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:15.360]  stand up and you win but it's only by exposing these people are we able to
[02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:18.000]  defeat them and the way we do that is by
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.560]  supporting the operation here as i mentioned before we got a christmas
[02:58:20.560 --> 02:58:24.480]  special for the nightly news for prison planet tv because prison planet tv is a
[02:58:24.480 --> 02:58:27.760]  lot more than just the nightly news it's where you'll see me
[02:58:27.760 --> 02:58:31.760]  and jacari jackson who was on earlier with a man on the street interview
[02:58:31.760 --> 02:58:34.960]  you can support that and right now you can get that as a christmas special for
