[00:00.000 --> 00:21.480]  We're broadcasting worldwide from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:21.480 --> 00:27.600]  It is Tuesday the 25th day of April 2017.
[00:27.600 --> 00:29.600]  And we've changed the world.
[00:29.600 --> 00:34.400]  My crew, myself, and of course you the listeners, the viewers, the activists, the people gathering
[00:34.400 --> 00:39.080]  intel out there on the ground and spreading the word in the trenches and the fight for
[00:39.080 --> 00:40.080]  the human mind.
[00:40.080 --> 00:42.840]  I'll just hear the United States but all over the world.
[00:42.840 --> 00:48.840]  Well, the biggest yogurt maker in the world that came out of nowhere the last few decades.
[00:48.840 --> 00:54.760]  Big buddies with George Soros, big buddies with Bill Clinton, big buddies with the Federal
[00:54.760 --> 00:59.720]  Reserve Board that he's on, the actual New York Fed that runs the whole country, that
[00:59.720 --> 01:07.520]  Trump can't even dislodge, he's filed a big lawsuit against Info Wars.
[01:07.520 --> 01:09.280]  Now the headlines are $10,000.
[01:09.280 --> 01:13.400]  That's just the filing that it's up to that amount of damages and they're asking for
[01:13.400 --> 01:24.080]  the punitive damages, $10,000,000, $20,000,000, who knows because Info Wars covered other
[01:24.080 --> 01:30.160]  mainstream and independent media articles about Idaho in the last year and a half where
[01:30.160 --> 01:36.520]  there was the report of the refugee teenagers and kids reportedly raping a little girl.
[01:36.520 --> 01:40.480]  And the media said it was all a hoax, Muslims never rape anybody.
[01:40.480 --> 01:43.840]  They never bomb anybody, they never shoot anybody.
[01:43.840 --> 01:50.120]  And the lapdog media was just salivating to try to cover it up.
[01:50.120 --> 01:52.160]  We weren't even the pro-generators of that article.
[01:52.160 --> 01:57.560]  We weren't even leading the coverage, probably should have been, and of course they just
[01:57.560 --> 02:00.280]  pled guilty.
[02:00.280 --> 02:03.840]  They all pled guilty to the assault.
[02:03.840 --> 02:13.200]  And so, through the transmutation or the alchemy of MSM, you'll file a lawsuit on Alex Jones
[02:13.200 --> 02:19.480]  and you have NBC with the headline that I published fake news.
[02:19.480 --> 02:24.600]  Why the Chabani owner, he doesn't have any connection to the refugees there in Idaho.
[02:24.600 --> 02:28.320]  He doesn't have any connections, of course he does.
[02:28.320 --> 02:36.480]  Since I posted fake stories, David Knight, who's very restrained by the way, did a video
[02:36.480 --> 02:43.600]  report about it and showed local news and the confirmation that indeed they'd pled guilty
[02:43.600 --> 02:44.600]  now.
[02:44.600 --> 02:51.160]  Now, you could say maybe Chabani, the company itself didn't, but the owner is a big advocate.
[02:51.160 --> 03:00.000]  You can put up on screen or maybe put behind me his Twitter feed with good old George Soros.
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.920]  So this is bigger than Infowars.com, it's bigger than Alex Jones.
[03:05.920 --> 03:09.200]  It's bigger than all of that.
[03:09.200 --> 03:14.080]  It's about being able to shut down free speech and intimidate people.
[03:14.080 --> 03:20.800]  The owner, who we'll get to in a moment, the Mr. Hamid Ulukaya wants me to apologize for
[03:20.800 --> 03:26.920]  my fake news, correct everything, pay them a bunch of damages.
[03:26.920 --> 03:33.080]  Okay, Muslims never raped anybody in the history of the world and they never committed a sin
[03:33.080 --> 03:37.080]  or a crime and they're perfect and there's no rapes in Sweden and no rapes in Germany
[03:37.080 --> 03:39.840]  and no crime and the refugees aren't bringing in TB.
[03:39.840 --> 03:41.680]  Oh yeah, I'm being sued for that.
[03:41.680 --> 03:48.040]  I have the CDC and a stack of mainstream news about TB exploding, including in the town
[03:48.040 --> 03:55.040]  where his factory's based where they brought in the refugees, and he's suing me for that.
[03:55.040 --> 03:59.840]  I've talked to my lawyers, this is a dream.
[03:59.840 --> 04:04.840]  I understand this guy's got a lot of money, but you've got a guy from Turkey who just
[04:04.840 --> 04:08.120]  got here in the 90s, who's got all these sweetheart government deals, there's buddies
[04:08.120 --> 04:13.040]  of Bill Clinton and George Soros, who sits on the board of the New York Federal Reserve
[04:13.040 --> 04:21.920]  that runs the country. The Federal Reserve Board is ultra secret, Trump can't even hardly
[04:21.920 --> 04:22.920]  dislodge it.
[04:22.920 --> 04:27.720]  This is the Federal Reserve and George Soros, but it gets better. When I saw the big top
[04:27.720 --> 04:32.800]  well-known DC law firm, I said, I've heard of them before and Soros, I think, gave them
[04:32.800 --> 04:37.040]  the founding money. I searched George Soros in the law firm, first thing, he was their
[04:37.040 --> 04:38.040]  first client.
[04:38.040 --> 04:47.760]  Who can make that up? An Islamist from Turkey, backed by George Soros, Bill Clinton's buddy
[04:47.760 --> 04:54.640]  on the Federal Reserve Board wants me to apologize and basically say, Muslims never
[04:54.640 --> 05:01.480]  even had a crooked toenail and he's not bringing in refugees. Well, sorry, not gonna do it.
[05:01.480 --> 05:06.200]  On Saturday, Pope Francis made the outlandish statement that refugee camps are like concentration
[05:06.200 --> 05:10.240]  camps. This is not the first time Pope Francis has made a Nazi reference. In wake of the
[05:10.240 --> 05:14.440]  election of Donald Trump, like a good liberal, the Pope warned of populist leaders like Hitler
[05:14.440 --> 05:19.000]  rising to power. But now the pontiff has made the comparison of refugee camps to concentration
[05:19.000 --> 05:20.000]  camps.
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.800]  What a lewd statement. Refugees are going to these centers to avoid starvation, suffering
[05:23.800 --> 05:28.200]  and death. While Jewish people were forced into concentration camps with the starvation,
[05:28.200 --> 05:31.320]  suffering and death, he made this statement while paying tribute to a Christian woman
[05:31.320 --> 05:35.120]  who was slaughtered by Muslims for her faith. He then heartlessly said that international
[05:35.120 --> 05:40.000]  accords seem more important than human rights. The Pope, while at a ceremony honoring modern-day
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.320]  Christian martyrs to Islam, is at the same time shoving open borders down your throat
[05:44.320 --> 05:48.240]  so that all countries can be invaded and murdered by these jihadists as their human
[05:48.240 --> 05:52.480]  right, ignoring anyone else's human right to living in a sovereign country. Funny how
[05:52.480 --> 05:56.840]  the Pope has a problem with refugee camps, still silent on the wars that put them there.
[05:56.840 --> 06:00.760]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer, not my Pope.
[06:00.760 --> 06:05.760]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[06:05.760 --> 06:09.640]  in stock at Infowars.com. Research across the board is clear. When bacteria infect your
[06:09.640 --> 06:13.880]  gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[06:13.880 --> 06:18.480]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[06:18.480 --> 06:21.000]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[06:21.000 --> 06:25.700]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen
[06:25.700 --> 06:28.320]  iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[06:28.320 --> 06:32.880]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out
[06:32.880 --> 06:37.560]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath. Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen
[06:37.560 --> 06:43.200]  by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano-silver, and more. Due to
[06:43.200 --> 06:47.040]  requests from lifters who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their
[06:47.040 --> 06:51.440]  children, we have created the new bubblegum-flavored Super Blue that is spearmint-free. Learn
[06:51.440 --> 06:56.520]  more about the new bubblegum-flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfowarsLife.com
[06:56.520 --> 06:59.600]  and support the Infowar while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[07:27.440 --> 07:32.580]  Have I actually just run out of my Super Female? I had a few bottles at my house and
[07:32.580 --> 07:37.780]  I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again. Very exciting, feeling great,
[07:37.780 --> 07:44.400]  looking good. And I know my hair is as luxurious as once again. Obviously, a Super Female is
[07:44.400 --> 07:45.640]  amazing. I love it.
[07:45.640 --> 07:50.540]  Nathan Iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say
[07:50.540 --> 07:55.420]  is life-changing, then I would suggest it's Nathan Iodine Survival Shield X2. It's got
[07:55.420 --> 07:59.420]  a five-star rating. It's a win-win in FallWarsLife.com.
[08:25.420 --> 08:35.420]  We've got a big broadcast lined up for you today. We're now at least two weeks
[08:35.420 --> 08:41.420]  into the crucifixion of the truth or the attempt of the dying corporate
[08:41.420 --> 08:46.540]  dinosaur media to claw back any type of respectability by attacking their
[08:46.540 --> 08:52.180]  opposition which of course is the truth. The lie must attack the truth. I don't
[08:52.180 --> 08:58.140]  like making our broadcast the center of attention but quite frankly events
[08:58.140 --> 09:03.740]  demanded or will be destroyed. Shabani Yogurt, the biggest yogurt maker in the
[09:03.740 --> 09:08.420]  world due to lucrative government contracts of course, that's how the real
[09:08.420 --> 09:15.220]  fortunes are made these days, has filed a ridiculous publicity stunt lawsuit in my
[09:15.220 --> 09:21.700]  research opinion and view against Alex Jones and in FallWars. Now the owner
[09:21.700 --> 09:26.800]  literally is a super good buddy with George Soros helping run the refugee
[09:26.800 --> 09:30.540]  program bringing unvetted Islamists and others into the country. That's
[09:30.540 --> 09:34.780]  happening and we know some of the refugees are unvetted. We know some of
[09:34.780 --> 09:39.620]  them have been carrying out crimes and this guy is a proponent of that. So with
[09:39.620 --> 09:46.980]  the so-called Islamic pilgrims or the Islamic colonists commit crimes, attack
[09:46.980 --> 09:52.580]  people, engage in general mutilation, all the things that are going on, it then
[09:52.580 --> 09:58.220]  falls on those, some of the guilt, who have been promoting this, who have been
[09:58.220 --> 10:05.500]  pushing it. It doesn't mean that the owner of Shabani, Hamid Ulukaya, from
[10:05.500 --> 10:10.500]  Turkey got here in the mid-1990s. It doesn't mean he wants all this to happen,
[10:10.500 --> 10:16.140]  doesn't mean he's happy the rapes are taking place. But the bottom line is
[10:16.140 --> 10:20.940]  seven countries have unvetted people coming into this nation where they
[10:20.940 --> 10:25.460]  don't even have real passports like Somalia and Sudan and Libya and in Libya
[10:25.460 --> 10:31.660]  they're selling women into slavery by the thousands. That's mainstream news. Now
[10:31.660 --> 10:36.140]  remember last year, about a year and a half ago, it broke in Idaho that
[10:36.140 --> 10:41.940]  reportedly some teenage boys raped a little girl and then reportedly
[10:41.940 --> 10:46.260]  videotaped it showed to the father and all the rest of it. Now they've pled
[10:46.260 --> 10:50.700]  guilty and admitted to it. So what's media going to do? They go, hmm, they got a big
[10:50.700 --> 10:56.900]  top PR firm, top media firm, literally founded by the first client George
[10:56.900 --> 11:00.660]  Soros and I have a special report on that coming up at the bottom of the hour
[11:00.660 --> 11:04.900]  that I shot last night that's highly produced that Rob do put together. But
[11:04.900 --> 11:12.180]  again, this is bigger than Alex Jones. This affects everybody in a giant way
[11:12.180 --> 11:15.860]  because if they can bring us down they can bring everybody down. There's NBC's
[11:15.860 --> 11:22.620]  headline, Alex Jones sued by Chobani after yogurt maker says radio host
[11:22.620 --> 11:30.140]  faked stories. Now you see they're branding us everywhere is fake. For two
[11:30.140 --> 11:36.780]  weeks, every major newspaper, every major news channel has been saying that I
[11:36.780 --> 11:42.140]  say I'm fake, I say I'm a fraud, I say I'm not real. They never show you a clip,
[11:42.140 --> 11:46.100]  they never show me saying it, there's no proof of it, and they play games and go
[11:46.100 --> 11:52.540]  oh well he admits sometimes he plays characters and as an actor. But that's
[11:52.540 --> 11:58.660]  when I'm clearly illustrating something by comedy or by sad talk. So there's this
[11:58.660 --> 12:04.100]  attempt to first brand us as fake. Then going back two weeks ago, we get calls,
[12:04.100 --> 12:08.060]  we get a letter from Chobani's law firm saying we want you to retract or
[12:08.060 --> 12:12.220]  clarify these three things. I go look at David Knight's reports, I look at one of
[12:12.220 --> 12:17.180]  the headlines that one of the other guys put up and I said you know, we can get
[12:17.180 --> 12:19.860]  away with it but I don't want to get away with it. I want to really really be
[12:19.860 --> 12:25.260]  fair here. You probably can't say that he's importing rapist. Technically people
[12:25.260 --> 12:28.820]  have been brought in, he pushes the refugee program that have been rapist. So
[12:28.820 --> 12:32.300]  you could technically say that but I said let's just point out that refugees
[12:32.300 --> 12:35.540]  are raping and the media has been forced to admit that they tried to cover up
[12:35.540 --> 12:40.260]  this case in Idaho and it turned out to be true, they've put guilty. Let's just go
[12:40.260 --> 12:47.220]  that headline. Turns out there was rape in Idaho connected to Islamist. Boom. So
[12:47.220 --> 12:53.260]  we change the headlines and send it back to them. What do they do? They have the
[12:53.260 --> 12:57.380]  Idaho statesman that is extremely revealing and informative and
[12:57.380 --> 13:06.780]  everything about it is a lie. First they have a photo of myself last year being
[13:06.780 --> 13:11.940]  escorted by police after I was attacked by a communist out of a public park at
[13:11.940 --> 13:16.220]  the RNC. Now as of five o'clock in the morning, they didn't have a caption
[13:16.220 --> 13:21.780]  under it saying that I was being escorted out by police. It just left it up
[13:21.780 --> 13:25.820]  there to make it look like I was being arrested. Then they say, show Bonnie, the
[13:25.820 --> 13:29.260]  Greek yogurt maker is suing Alex Jones, the right wing conspiracy theorist, who
[13:29.260 --> 13:32.700]  said Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax. Didn't quite say that. We had debates
[13:32.700 --> 13:36.060]  about it. 9-11 was an inside job. Yes, our government stood down, worked with Saudi
[13:36.060 --> 13:39.740]  Arabia. That's not been declassified by the US government. Nope, didn't say that.
[13:39.740 --> 13:45.580]  And that show Bonnie imports migrant rapists to Twin Falls. The headline did
[13:45.580 --> 13:49.060]  say he was importing people connected to rape. And that's all over the local
[13:49.060 --> 13:52.300]  newspapers. I'm going to show you those headlines. But we even did what they
[13:52.300 --> 13:59.820]  wanted and changed it. They go on to say I didn't respond and they go on to say we
[13:59.820 --> 14:03.980]  didn't retract it. But here's the proof. Scroll down.
[14:03.980 --> 14:10.020]  You'll see three blue links there. Lower down. Keep going. There they are. Back up.
[14:10.020 --> 14:18.420]  Back up. There they are. You go to those links and you will notice, click the
[14:18.420 --> 14:26.340]  middle one. Go ahead and click it. That's not our website. That's not our YouTube
[14:26.340 --> 14:32.700]  channel. They got a copy of it. Somebody did. I'm sure they're fine folks. Just some
[14:32.700 --> 14:38.940]  YouTube channel and post it with the original headline. Now the newspaper
[14:38.940 --> 14:44.620]  knows and show Bonnie knows and they all full well know that statutorily if we do
[14:44.620 --> 14:50.820]  a correction or attraction that there aren't punitive damages, meaning larger
[14:50.820 --> 14:56.740]  damages, just actual damages, if they were to win a lawsuit. So just like in
[14:56.740 --> 15:02.260]  other cases we've seen lately, we correct or attract. They say we don't and then the
[15:02.260 --> 15:07.220]  media itself republishes it or media matters republishes it and then links to
[15:07.220 --> 15:12.540]  it and then claims republishing and damages again.
[15:12.660 --> 15:17.740]  But you look at those links. You look at those links and they are not us. Now
[15:17.740 --> 15:21.980]  let's be clear. I'm not backing away from the story. I clarified it when their
[15:21.980 --> 15:25.940]  lawyers called two weeks ago and said yeah those headlines could be a little
[15:25.940 --> 15:29.460]  bit more accurate. Change them. But in essence my lawyers agreed. They said yeah
[15:29.460 --> 15:33.780]  no. Tend the headlines about rape in the area, sexual assault. This guy is
[15:33.780 --> 15:38.820]  bringing in refugees. Refugees are connected to this. It's very, very
[15:38.820 --> 15:43.260]  reasonable to basically say that.
[15:44.260 --> 15:50.020]  And so we simply went and did a clarification really. Does it matter?
[15:50.020 --> 15:55.300]  Two weeks later they file a lawsuit. The owner of Chabani tells the newspaper
[15:55.300 --> 15:59.420]  that I didn't respond. That he wants me to apologize, clarify and give him a
[15:59.420 --> 16:04.100]  call. All these damages. Brother not gonna happen. They also said the lawsuit that
[16:04.100 --> 16:10.020]  I was seeking to hurt them financially. Why on earth would I want to hurt some
[16:10.020 --> 16:14.660]  yogurt company that's based here in the United States and has people working at
[16:14.660 --> 16:19.780]  it? Why would I want to do that? I'll be honest. I didn't know about Chabani. I knew
[16:19.780 --> 16:24.100]  about the TB in the area. I knew about Muslims being brought in. I knew a
[16:24.100 --> 16:30.420]  Muslim owned it. We had barely covered the story but don't you worry. I'm gonna
[16:30.420 --> 16:38.260]  be covering it now. Mr. Hamid Ulukaya. Yes. In fact I'm choosing this as a
[16:38.260 --> 16:45.060]  battle. On this I will stand. I will win or I will die. I have chosen this. You
[16:45.060 --> 16:50.300]  have chosen it. Let's go. You are on the private super secret New York Federal
[16:50.300 --> 16:53.700]  Reserve Board that runs the entire Federal Reserve that US citizens can't
[16:53.700 --> 16:57.940]  even find anything out about. And you are from Turkey.
[16:57.940 --> 17:01.540]  Move to in the mid-1990s and her buddies with Bill Clinton and George Soros and
[17:01.540 --> 17:06.060]  tweet how you're refreshing to meet George Soros and hear about his work.
[17:06.060 --> 17:11.940]  Looking forward to collaborating with him on refugees. That was two years ago.
[17:13.940 --> 17:19.300]  So we've got him buddies with Bill Clinton. Part of the Big Clinton Global
[17:19.300 --> 17:24.300]  Initiative. Part of the Clinton Foundation. And you say we're putting out fake
[17:24.300 --> 17:29.740]  stories when everybody knows about what reportedly happened in the town your
[17:29.740 --> 17:33.820]  plants based in with refugees that came in that you had promoted and pushed to
[17:33.820 --> 17:37.980]  come. And now you're claiming you have no connection to the refugees that have
[17:37.980 --> 17:42.700]  pled guilty. So what do they do when they when when the media said this didn't
[17:42.700 --> 17:45.660]  happen. They said it was a right-wing hoax last year. Remember that all over the
[17:45.660 --> 17:50.060]  news Muslims never rape anybody. They're little perfect angels. What do they do?
[17:50.060 --> 17:57.900]  They're trying to grab victory from the jaws of defeat. They are trying to go who
[17:57.900 --> 18:01.140]  can we say is fake news. Well even branding Alex Jones is fake news. He
[18:01.140 --> 18:04.100]  didn't create these stories. He didn't push these stories and most of it's
[18:04.100 --> 18:07.900]  accurate. But let's just pick him and David Knight reading some news articles
[18:07.900 --> 18:13.300]  on the nightly news and say they created it. Alex Jones created this claim that
[18:13.300 --> 18:18.300]  in a town in Idaho that has this huge Muslim population everything caters to
[18:18.300 --> 18:24.860]  them now. He made it all up. It all came out of Alex Jones. The king of fake news
[18:24.860 --> 18:28.540]  when we're the king of reality not the king of fake news and they know it and
[18:28.540 --> 18:33.060]  that's why they can take us down. They can take you down. And it's interesting
[18:33.060 --> 18:36.580]  when you go to the Idaho newspaper I thought I'd go to their front page and
[18:36.580 --> 18:39.780]  see what I saw. So what's at the front page of the Idaho statesmen guess what I
[18:39.780 --> 18:44.940]  saw? It's like Islamabad. It's like catering to the Muslims. Go to the front
[18:44.940 --> 18:50.420]  page. We'll put it up on screen for TV viewers. Five different articles about
[18:50.420 --> 18:55.540]  catering to Muslims and that's because there's a major Islamic takeover there.
[18:55.540 --> 18:59.740]  Oh look it's fewer Middle Eastern students are enrolling at Boise State.
[18:59.740 --> 19:04.820]  Oh they don't feel welcome. How do we grovel more to make them feel welcome and
[19:04.820 --> 19:08.180]  you know all this should be a law and the rest of it. You scroll down and you
[19:08.180 --> 19:13.300]  find more articles about Muslims and how great they are and look at the
[19:13.300 --> 19:19.420]  headline. It looks like I'm being arrested there. All deception. It's like when I go
[19:19.420 --> 19:22.420]  for my child custody case here in Austin they'll sit there with cameras showing me
[19:22.420 --> 19:25.340]  taking my belt off going through a metal detector or holding my arms up to be
[19:25.340 --> 19:30.420]  wandered like I'm a criminal. That's how they sit there and deceive everybody
[19:30.420 --> 19:35.260]  ladies and gentlemen. We come back I've got more on this North Korea. Huge
[19:35.260 --> 19:39.460]  developments on the economy. David Knight's coming up but this is a big big
[19:39.460 --> 19:44.540]  big deal. What they're trying to engage in with the American people and how
[19:44.540 --> 19:49.180]  they're trying to play all these different games when everybody knows
[19:49.180 --> 19:52.740]  that there is a massive Islamic invasion taking place all over the Western
[19:52.740 --> 19:55.940]  world and that they've basically bought off the local governments and have
[19:55.940 --> 20:02.260]  basically are taking over our society. Stay with us. We use cell phones against
[20:02.260 --> 20:06.700]  our heads every day but now a landmark US government study confirms increased

[24:16.340 --> 24:22.420]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the
[24:22.420 --> 24:29.980]  resistance. It's Alex Jones. We're gonna look at the Islamic invasion coming up
[24:29.980 --> 24:36.980]  in the next segment and tie it into all these rich Islamic leaders who have
[24:36.980 --> 24:39.660]  basically been taken over the private school movement here in the United States,
[24:39.660 --> 24:45.020]  taking over many of the factories and bringing in their own foreign workers to
[24:45.020 --> 24:50.260]  staff those. So that is all coming up how this how this ties together. But first
[24:50.260 --> 24:53.460]  if you're a TV viewer I'll show you this. Radio listeners can go to infowars.com
[24:53.460 --> 24:58.580]  and see it. Hopefully share the link because Fox News, CNN, the front page,
[24:58.580 --> 25:02.460]  the local paper, they're all running with the fact that I'm fake news and I'm
[25:02.460 --> 25:08.460]  being sued because I claimed that the owner of Chabani brought in rapists. Well
[25:08.460 --> 25:13.300]  I mean he's bringing in unvetted migrant Islamists and they've
[25:13.300 --> 25:18.900]  now pled guilty to the sexual assault. What am I supposed to do? And then they're
[25:18.900 --> 25:23.180]  saying oh that's fake news. Say it isn't true and we'll drop our lawsuit. That's
[25:23.180 --> 25:26.220]  what I was told two weeks ago. Well now the lawsuit's filed. I mean I'm not gonna
[25:26.220 --> 25:30.260]  sit here and say that Sweden didn't the rape capital of the world. We can show you
[25:30.260 --> 25:35.900]  the maps on that. I'm not gonna sit here and say that Islam isn't spreading all
[25:35.900 --> 25:44.860]  over the planet. I mean it's just simply crazy. Just type in global maps of rape
[25:44.860 --> 25:51.500]  worldwide and the highest place in the world is Sweden. Now here's the video
[25:51.500 --> 25:55.660]  where I break all this down. Alex responds to Chabani Soros backed lawsuits.
[25:55.660 --> 25:59.180]  I'll break all that down in the next longer segment but look at this commenter
[25:59.180 --> 26:02.900]  right here and I see this a lot. Blue Mountain 48. I hope Alex you don't talk
[26:02.900 --> 26:07.300]  about this for two weeks about this lawsuit. Gee it's only $10,000. Alex
[26:07.300 --> 26:11.940]  makes that in one day. I make that in one day. No I battle to find this
[26:11.940 --> 26:16.760]  operation because it's the main outpost of resistance. Now let me show you the
[26:16.760 --> 26:21.660]  Idaho statesman okay by Zach Kyle. The whole article is basically fiction
[26:21.660 --> 26:30.980]  except for one part. Chabani seeks that's the name of the company. I love
[26:30.980 --> 26:34.580]  how it's called Greek yogurt. It's called Chobani. I guess the Muslims did take
[26:34.580 --> 26:38.620]  over Greece for a while so they're really I guess Muslims there now or at
[26:38.620 --> 26:42.100]  least in their bloodline. There's been lawsuits over the fact it's not really
[26:42.100 --> 26:47.060]  Greek yogurt. Again it's this total imposter system. Seeks at least 10,000
[26:47.060 --> 26:52.300]  damages, attorney's fees and punitive damages. Punitive. That could be a hundred
[26:52.300 --> 26:59.660]  million like the whole Cogan case. Punitive, punitive, punitive. Man.
[26:59.660 --> 27:05.140]  They point out we're on 580 a.m. you know KIDO. You know behind the scenes of it
[27:05.140 --> 27:07.940]  they're trying to get us off that station. You know it. I'm gonna be going to
[27:07.940 --> 27:11.180]  Idaho now. I'm gonna be going on that local radio station. I am gonna bring
[27:11.180 --> 27:14.980]  investigative crews there. I'm gonna show what the locals are doing. I'm gonna
[27:14.980 --> 27:18.740]  show the Islamists is getting off the planes. You want to fight? You better
[27:18.740 --> 27:28.020]  believe baby. You got one. It's not Chobani suing me. It's Hamid Ulukia. Hamid
[27:28.020 --> 27:35.140]  Ulukia. That is who. Bill Clinton's buddy. The guy that works for George
[27:35.140 --> 27:39.820]  Sorrell. It brings people in. And then he turns around and he's on the Federal
[27:39.820 --> 27:44.500]  Reserve Board at 44 years of age. When citizens can't even find out what's
[27:44.500 --> 27:52.020]  going on on that. How about foreign rule? I cannot wait for the depositions. I
[27:52.020 --> 27:55.580]  cannot wait to depose this guy. Oh, let me just tell the listeners something real
[27:55.580 --> 27:58.620]  quick before we go to break and come back. I'm gonna hit some North Korean news
[27:58.620 --> 28:05.060]  and some other big news. On this rock I plant my flag. I'm gonna fight this.
[28:05.060 --> 28:08.700]  I just got level. I know they have really miscalculated. I talked to Mike
[28:08.700 --> 28:11.820]  Cernovich. He agrees as a lawyer. We're talking to some other top lawyers right
[28:11.820 --> 28:16.820]  now. But this is a perfect opening now because it's a story we can document.
[28:16.820 --> 28:20.780]  It's where we're just reporting on other people's news. They're trying to
[28:20.780 --> 28:28.100]  shut us down. Shut us up saying we're fake. This is crazy. Absolutely incredible
[28:28.100 --> 28:30.780]  ladies and gentlemen to have the fake media saying this. But listen, we need
[28:30.780 --> 28:34.260]  your financial support and your prayers more than ever. We've been discounting

[29:44.260 --> 29:47.260]  products. We'll be right back.
[29:47.260 --> 29:58.260]  March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.260 --> 30:06.860]  Try not laughing at this headline. Survey. One in five adults in the United
[30:06.860 --> 30:10.860]  Kingdom can't change a lightbulb or boil an egg. This according to a survey of
[30:10.860 --> 30:14.460]  more than 2,000 people on their habits around the house. Listen to some of
[30:14.460 --> 30:19.140]  these shocking statistics. 31% of people could not cook a meal without a recipe.
[30:19.140 --> 30:25.980]  34% of people cannot read a map. 38% of people could not unclog a sink. 47% of
[30:25.980 --> 30:30.900]  people don't know how to check oil levels in a car. 53% of people could not
[30:30.900 --> 30:35.820]  put up a shelf, a shelf. Now while this survey was done in the UK, I wouldn't be
[30:35.820 --> 30:38.820]  shocked if you got some of the same results in big cities here in the United
[30:38.820 --> 30:42.540]  States. This is a perfect example of how modern day education systems and
[30:42.540 --> 30:46.380]  lifestyles are domesticating our society so that we cannot function
[30:46.380 --> 30:51.260]  independently. I am shocked that he interrupted me while I was watching. Oh my

[33:01.060 --> 33:27.140]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[33:27.140 --> 33:31.700]  You know you got some guy that works for George Soros to open the borders up
[33:31.700 --> 33:36.580]  and bring in refugees. He works with the UN plan in Peter Sutherland to Islamify
[33:36.580 --> 33:41.060]  Europe. I mean that's that's that's what the UN program is. He's pushing this
[33:41.060 --> 33:48.580]  colonization big time. His name's Hamid Ulaqiah and he followed suit on me
[33:48.580 --> 33:53.580]  claiming I wanted to hurt his company and have people not eat his yogurt. No, we
[33:53.580 --> 33:57.060]  covered other reports confirming people have now pled guilty refugees that
[33:57.060 --> 34:01.440]  were brought into the town that you push who now have pled guilty to these
[34:01.440 --> 34:05.580]  assaults that the media said didn't exist for a year and then we were picked
[34:05.580 --> 34:10.300]  as a publicity stunt to try to smokescreen the fact that the refugee
[34:10.300 --> 34:16.380]  program has now given a black eye to this guy's company by his actions just
[34:16.380 --> 34:21.100]  like Starbucks is down 20 something percent in their profits right now or
[34:21.100 --> 34:25.260]  more because they said we're gonna hire a bunch of refugees. People are sick of
[34:25.260 --> 34:30.100]  it. Your actions caused this to happen to you. Your actions Hillary Clinton made
[34:30.100 --> 34:34.140]  you lose the election. I could care less. In fact I didn't even ever put two and
[34:34.140 --> 34:37.940]  two together with the yogurt because the few times I've eaten it it tastes I
[34:37.940 --> 34:41.780]  don't like Greek yogurt to begin with it doesn't have any flavor and yours
[34:41.780 --> 34:45.940]  tasted like drying paint and I don't say that because you're a Muslim. If you
[34:45.940 --> 34:48.700]  were a Muslim not trying to open the borders and bring all these people in
[34:48.700 --> 34:51.980]  and pushing all this garbage and you weren't with George Soros and your
[34:51.980 --> 34:57.100]  yogurt tasted good I'd buy it from you. I am so honored and so blessed to have a
[34:57.100 --> 35:00.540]  guy hooked into the global initiative buddies with George Soros involved with
[35:00.540 --> 35:06.340]  the global refugee Islamic movement coming after me and have them all over the
[35:06.340 --> 35:12.220]  news saying oh we couldn't instantly or you know couldn't get a comment right
[35:12.220 --> 35:16.740]  away Fox News says. We didn't immediately get a comment. They never let me comment.
[35:16.740 --> 35:20.500]  They never show what I say in the news. They never let me counter. They just lie
[35:20.500 --> 35:24.340]  lie lie and pretend like they're mainstream news. Pretend like they're
[35:24.340 --> 35:30.140]  trustable news. They're total garbage. Just enforce it immediately respond to a
[35:30.140 --> 35:33.340]  request for comment. Yeah I called that reporter by the way this morning good
[35:33.340 --> 35:37.300]  luck I'll ever be having quotes. All they do is cherry pick a bunch of bull and
[35:37.300 --> 35:41.660]  then show a photo of me with police all around me like I've been arrested. No
[35:41.660 --> 35:46.660]  it's not a fake news story this guy pushes bringing in refugees. It's not a
[35:46.660 --> 35:51.580]  fake news story that there's now been reports of this and people pleading
[35:51.580 --> 35:56.620]  guilty. Does that mean he directly wanted it? No. But when you bring in
[35:56.620 --> 36:00.740]  unvetted Islamist hordes you better believe you're bringing in some rapist
[36:00.740 --> 36:04.780]  because that's part of the culture over there just like Somalia when I said that
[36:04.780 --> 36:08.940]  rock star hip-hop lady wants to bring in more unvetted refugees I said don't go
[36:08.940 --> 36:15.580]  to Somalia lady you'll get gang raped. People said oh my gosh oh my gosh he
[36:15.580 --> 36:19.020]  wants to get gang raped. No it's a figure of speech. You want us to live under
[36:19.020 --> 36:22.620]  this but you live behind armed guards. You've got bodyguards Michael Moore but
[36:22.620 --> 36:25.900]  you don't want us to have guns. The refugees have now admitted the sex attack
[36:25.900 --> 36:30.260]  on a disabled girl in Idaho reportedly peed in her mouth as well. Oh I've got
[36:30.260 --> 36:33.860]  articles right here where Islamists raped a little girl anally and they
[36:33.860 --> 36:35.980]  didn't do anything because they said well that's just their culture and he
[36:35.980 --> 36:39.460]  couldn't understand no. And I've got a whole stack of news coming up in the next
[36:39.460 --> 36:43.540]  segment or in this segment actually from a tape report I put out breaking all of

[38:51.180 --> 38:55.260]  we're under attack because we're changing the world together the pin is in
[38:55.260 --> 39:01.460]  the runoff to win she's like Ron Paul better than Trump nationalism surging
[39:01.460 --> 39:05.340]  humanities awakening and they want to intimidate us if they can and shut us
[39:05.340 --> 39:09.660]  down they could shut everybody down Google admits they're censoring us it's
[39:09.660 --> 39:13.700]  all coming out leakers need to put out more info here's the final thing I'm
[39:13.700 --> 39:18.980]  gonna say that's most important they're failing in all these attacks but they're
[39:18.980 --> 39:23.380]  assassinating my character first with the general public before fake criminal
[39:23.380 --> 39:28.220]  charges or murder and don't says be dramatic I'm smart I've studied things
[39:28.220 --> 39:33.460]  I have a feel for this this is what they do before they kill you they want me
[39:33.460 --> 39:37.300]  silence they want me under system so I can't speak out while they quietly
[39:37.300 --> 39:41.020]  destroy me all these little little apputions it's not gonna work we're
[39:41.020 --> 39:44.500]  standing together but this is the equivalent of the Alamo against the
[39:44.500 --> 39:49.980]  globalist or 300 I'm on the beach with our listeners the frontline battling any
[39:49.980 --> 39:54.540]  other talk show host other news sites and everybody else out there to support

[41:18.780 --> 41:22.380]  through for us but we got to keep pulling hard here or the globalists are
[41:22.380 --> 41:25.500]  going to absolutely people say oh he acts like a football coach that's what
[41:25.500 --> 41:29.460]  men did before they went to war before they rally the troops football is a
[41:29.460 --> 41:34.980]  facsimile of war it's not real football coaches are copying what men used to do
[41:34.980 --> 41:38.620]  to rally people to stand up for their people I'm not acting like a football
[41:38.620 --> 41:42.460]  coach they're acting like what men used to do rallying people to take action
[41:42.460 --> 41:47.140]  this isn't some game people there's a total Islamic takeover taking place
[41:47.140 --> 41:51.460]  behind the scenes they got Muslims following me around you would believe
[41:51.460 --> 41:56.340]  the crap they're pulling man the damn cult and and I'm ready to take them on

[42:04.620 --> 42:07.820]  to my special report than David Knight coming up I'm Alex Jones telling the
[42:07.820 --> 42:15.980]  truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me God April 24th
[42:15.980 --> 42:25.460]  2017 that's the day you can mark your calendars that George Soros openly try
[42:25.460 --> 42:29.900]  to take down info wars yeah he funds media matters and David Brock and is
[42:29.900 --> 42:34.340]  trying to shut down info wars and every other libertarian pro-america group and
[42:34.340 --> 42:37.700]  sure he's involved with MSNBC in the WikiLeaks with Hillary trying to
[42:37.700 --> 42:41.620]  cancel the election and sure he's been caught with the United Nations in the
[42:41.620 --> 42:46.020]  WikiLeaks trying to set up a system where only his news is available to the
[42:46.020 --> 42:53.260]  public news he approves but the Nazi collaborator jumped the shark today
[42:53.260 --> 43:05.460]  April 24th 2017 he had his Islamist owned and backed US company openly filed
[43:05.460 --> 43:11.380]  suit against info wars today for stating information that is part of the
[43:11.380 --> 43:18.380]  public record they have taken our kindness for weakness and George Soros
[43:18.380 --> 43:26.380]  and his Islamist buddies are now about to meet not Alex Jones but the American
[43:26.380 --> 43:39.300]  people let me just first show you a few headlines from today but also the
[43:39.300 --> 43:43.860]  recent past is to illustrate what I'm about to lay out to you look at this
[43:43.860 --> 43:49.340]  headline associated press today Chobani yogurt company Sue's right wing radio
[43:49.340 --> 43:56.260]  host Alan Jones and it says because I claim Islamic migrants quote refugees
[43:56.260 --> 44:03.720]  are unvetted which they are and the 20% or more have TB and because this guy
[44:03.720 --> 44:08.620]  promotes the importation of these people I'm a liar so they're suing me they
[44:08.620 --> 44:16.100]  also say that he's been caught bringing in Islamist who have now pled guilty to
[44:16.100 --> 44:21.780]  rape well let me then clarify or correct myself here I'm not saying he
[44:21.780 --> 44:25.460]  consciously brought in people he thought were going to rape but people he
[44:25.460 --> 44:30.940]  brought in and force Fed on America have now been implicated indicted and have
[44:30.940 --> 44:38.740]  pled guilty to that but here's what's even crazier the owner of Chobani who
[44:38.740 --> 44:43.140]  appeared out of nowhere in the late 1990s here in the United States immigrated
[44:43.140 --> 44:51.300]  here in 1994 he is on the New York Federal Reserve that's the New York Fed
[44:51.300 --> 44:58.340]  that under the 1913 Federal Reserve Act controls all the other regional banks
[44:58.340 --> 45:04.140]  in the United States and Donald Trump is even having trouble removing the New
[45:04.140 --> 45:11.020]  York Fed so how is this guy who just got here in the 90s on the New York Fed but
[45:11.020 --> 45:14.860]  citizens can't even get details of what's happening and he comes here from
[45:14.860 --> 45:18.620]  countries that don't have any freedom turkeys now Islamic dictatorship
[45:18.620 --> 45:23.060]  threatening to invade Europe they don't submit he comes here with with clear
[45:23.060 --> 45:27.140]  backing of the government of Turkey Turkey's infiltrated us up one side down
[45:27.140 --> 45:31.460]  the other that's admitted setting up thousands of public schools private
[45:31.460 --> 45:37.460]  schools you name it then he shows up out of nowhere gets huge portions of the US
[45:37.460 --> 45:42.260]  lunch program I'm gonna cover that in a moment kind of like Carlos Slim the
[45:42.260 --> 45:46.300]  Mexican kingpin that owns the New York Times gets the Obama phone contracts
[45:46.300 --> 45:52.220]  billions a year and then they pick us to file a lawsuit on and why is that
[45:52.220 --> 45:54.580]  because we're the tip of the spear ladies and gentlemen so I'm gonna go over
[45:54.580 --> 45:57.780]  all the evidence right now here it is refreshing to meet George Soros and
[45:57.780 --> 46:01.980]  hear about his work looking forward to collaborating with him and the refugees
[46:01.980 --> 46:06.100]  that was a couple years ago we now see with the flood of 80% military age men
[46:06.100 --> 46:09.140]  the 5 million people in Europe what's happening here the giant political
[46:09.140 --> 46:15.900]  snake that is chewing at us so here's the aching group that George Soros founded
[46:15.900 --> 46:23.020]  I'm gonna show you in a moment George Soros's law firm that is suing us for
[46:23.020 --> 46:29.180]  reporting on what I'm about to show you all over mainstream news TV skyrocketing
[46:29.180 --> 46:34.580]  coming from the Islamist what his company's doing that he's pushing for
[46:34.580 --> 46:40.940]  more unfettered refugees all of this but they go on to say that Idaho yogurt
[46:40.940 --> 46:45.180]  maker caught importing migrant rapists so they threaten me a couple weeks ago
[46:45.180 --> 46:47.980]  the lawsuit so we even changed the headlines they didn't care they went
[46:47.980 --> 46:51.780]  ahead and filed the lawsuit even though you could technically probably argue our
[46:51.780 --> 46:56.340]  headlines I said yeah maybe he didn't know that it's part of the Islamic
[46:56.340 --> 46:59.500]  religion to rape women that aren't attended and put hoods over their heads
[46:59.500 --> 47:02.460]  and enslave them maybe he's not really a Muslim even though he is but I said I'm
[47:02.460 --> 47:06.380]  gonna give the benefit of the doubt maybe he's a heretic so I said let's not
[47:06.380 --> 47:11.660]  say let's say people he brought in have been pleading guilty to rape and that
[47:11.660 --> 47:16.780]  TV is exploding from folks being brought in but let's not didn't matter to them
[47:16.780 --> 47:21.900]  statutorily it's all about teaching me to shut up teaching me to back down
[47:21.900 --> 47:26.220]  teaching all of us to go away which isn't gonna happen they've taken my
[47:26.220 --> 47:30.780]  kindness for weakness oh Chobani get ready Chobani founder gets threats and
[47:30.780 --> 47:35.660]  the calls are now coming out to boycott bringing in more refugees that was last
[47:35.660 --> 47:41.780]  year that's NBC news not us here's another headline US yogurt billionaire
[47:41.780 --> 47:46.580]  asked businesses to hire more foreign refugees Turkish Chobani owner has deep
[47:46.580 --> 47:52.140]  ties to Clinton global initiative and Clinton campaign 2016 then you turn the
[47:52.140 --> 47:56.780]  page they have links to it it turns out he's involved with Democrats the unions
[47:56.780 --> 48:01.980]  he got all this money in from federal government he spent all this money on
[48:01.980 --> 48:09.340]  lobbying and then you find out refugee advocate is also on the board of the
[48:09.340 --> 48:13.340]  Federal Reserve Bank of New York all still being a Turkish citizen and has
[48:13.340 --> 48:19.220]  been named imminent advocate for the United Nations refugee program which is
[48:19.220 --> 48:23.620]  run by Peter Southerland that says the Islamic invasion is about ending Western
[48:23.620 --> 48:29.980]  civilization and freedom under the 1951 convention and the preamble which all
[48:29.980 --> 48:33.020]  the countries in the world effectively that we're talking about our
[48:33.020 --> 48:40.780]  signatories to refugees at the responsibility of the word the day of
[48:40.780 --> 48:46.780]  hiding behind borders and fences is long gone we have to work together and
[48:46.780 --> 48:51.740]  cooperate together to make a better word so let's look at this international
[48:51.740 --> 48:57.940]  prospectus from international investors titled alpha company or die looking at
[48:57.940 --> 49:03.020]  the aching group the firms New York offices started with three clients and
[49:03.020 --> 49:07.780]  number three was George Soros the aching group built out its business from
[49:07.780 --> 49:12.140]  there the firms investment management practice now both 60 lawyers plus 45
[49:12.140 --> 49:18.100]  tax attorneys and they filed suit on us so you want me to fight the globalist
[49:18.100 --> 49:21.780]  you want me to take on the new world order that hijacked America open the
[49:21.780 --> 49:25.780]  borders up and is bringing in the Islamists here in in Europe well they're
[49:25.780 --> 49:30.340]  going to come after us so everyone should be conscious Google just got caught
[49:30.340 --> 49:34.220]  censoring us and had to admit it Soros and his media matters is openly trying
[49:34.220 --> 49:40.060]  to shut us down and now they've got lawsuits expose it speak out against it
[49:40.060 --> 49:43.860]  literally I never knew what show Bonnie yogurt was I thought it was a joke the
[49:43.860 --> 49:48.540]  few times I ate it but again that's why they target school lunch programs because
[49:48.540 --> 49:54.740]  in my opinion it tastes like dried paint so I'm being sued for saying Islamists
[49:54.740 --> 49:58.740]  are bringing in TB I'm being sued for saying that some of them have you know
[49:58.740 --> 50:03.700]  been pleading guilty to rape I'm sure you weren't conscious and I'll retract
[50:03.700 --> 50:10.020]  that so let's look at the headlines TB spike 500% in twin falls during 2012 as
[50:10.020 --> 50:16.180]  sure Bonnie yogurt opened the plant the blessings just continue seven refugees
[50:16.180 --> 50:21.380]  with active TB sent to Idaho when they know they have it 20% of residents
[50:21.380 --> 50:25.060]  refugees in Minnesota tested positive for tuberculosis it doesn't matter they're
[50:25.060 --> 50:27.820]  arrogant Muslims running around you know killing each other in their own
[50:27.820 --> 50:30.940]  countries doesn't matter we'll roll over to them we have no common sense we have
[50:30.940 --> 50:36.140]  no life force we have no resistance I do report tuberculosis in the United
[50:36.140 --> 50:42.860]  States 2015 CDC exploding Chobani and Fage face lawsuits over sugar content
[50:42.860 --> 50:48.500]  and Greekness oh competitors are taking Shabani to court over scare tactics
[50:48.500 --> 50:53.100]  using its ads oh bullying Chobani Greek yogurt is using lawsuit of not being
[50:53.100 --> 50:56.140]  Greek and deceiving customers with nutritional benefits oh but don't worry
[50:56.140 --> 51:00.820]  you've got a fake forced school lunch program don't you oh and the same law
[51:00.820 --> 51:03.820]  firm big law firm takes down big conservative blogger and no one points
[51:03.820 --> 51:08.620]  out Soros was a founding funder but we will don't worry Turkey says migrant
[51:08.620 --> 51:14.460]  deal has ended man leased millions of refugees and I've got all the headlines
[51:14.460 --> 51:18.460]  just from last month saying you will let more in or we will burn down your
[51:18.460 --> 51:22.900]  up we're launching a holy war a jihad and the day after he said it truck
[51:22.900 --> 51:28.540]  attacks in England and in France and in Sweden and in Belgium and it was all
[51:28.540 --> 51:32.420]  just funny because Europeans have no defense mechanism they have no will
[51:32.420 --> 51:37.540]  to stand up and and Ergun the dictator just laughs and says start killing and
[51:37.540 --> 51:42.300]  he's got his companies here everywhere taken over private schools you name it
[51:42.300 --> 51:46.260]  companies just everywhere because they know how to run stuff and they know how
[51:46.260 --> 51:49.740]  to donate money and they know how to sue and they know how to bully well guess
[51:49.740 --> 51:55.140]  what you just ran into a Texan so you get ready because we're never backing
[51:55.140 --> 51:59.540]  down and our audience isn't backing down Turkish ministers in 15,000 migrants a
[51:59.540 --> 52:04.220]  month to Europe to shock them you're already doing it hell intimidation
[52:04.220 --> 52:07.220]  tactics have been working for over a thousand years for Islam they took over
[52:07.220 --> 52:13.100]  much of the Middle East Europe much of Africa Asia Islam took over all over the
[52:13.100 --> 52:19.260]  place our government's been backing it taken over Serbia taken over Syria
[52:19.260 --> 52:24.780]  taken over Egypt radical Islam and so it's been working hasn't it it's been
[52:24.780 --> 52:28.220]  working to be arrogant it's been working to be aggressive it's been working to be
[52:28.220 --> 52:32.220]  in everybody's face and we just bend over and and grovel to the Islamification
[52:32.220 --> 52:36.780]  of Europe and London and every major city it's truly truly sickening but
[52:36.780 --> 52:41.300]  let's get to the rest of the big celebrated lawsuit wide massive news
[52:41.300 --> 52:45.100]  coverage six seven investigative journalists from big globalist media
[52:45.100 --> 52:49.460]  outfits openly funded by Soros like Media Matters the Daily Beast the Huffington
[52:49.460 --> 52:54.580]  Post following me everywhere putting out total lies but that's okay let's gang up
[52:54.580 --> 52:57.980]  on Alex Jones you know what I love it I intended this my whole life to fight

[53:32.100 --> 53:36.700]  hoax because everybody knows Muslims never raped anybody they never bombed
[53:36.700 --> 53:41.100]  anybody they never stabbed anybody and then I've got all these stories second
[53:41.100 --> 53:45.620]  doctor charged in general mutilation case USA Day here in the US that's what
[53:45.620 --> 53:50.020]  umma habiting's mother's promoting in America Hilary's girlfriend media meltdown

[54:00.420 --> 54:06.060]  understand no and it's his culture AP charges Fresno shooters words they

[54:11.300 --> 54:16.420]  Idaho jury brother sits there and sees all this and knows all this won't matter
[54:16.420 --> 54:21.780]  half of work at your damn plant they ain't your guts to they hate your
[54:21.780 --> 54:25.700]  thuggery they hate your bullying they hate your Islamification they hate your
[54:25.700 --> 54:30.500]  gentle mutilation they hate everything Islam does and until you denounce it
[54:30.500 --> 54:36.940]  and you try to bring that here it's on all Muslims heads but none of you will
[54:36.940 --> 54:41.780]  decry what you're involved in where will you where are you and to be clear
[54:41.780 --> 54:46.940]  we're discovering a few of the cases refugees from Africa refugees from Iraq
[54:46.940 --> 54:51.860]  rapes rapes admitting to it adults being charged and all sorts of cover-ups I
[54:51.860 --> 54:55.660]  mean this is huge everybody knows about the Islamic rape epidemic and that
[54:55.660 --> 55:00.260]  sweetens the capital of rape worldwide now when Faraj says it they criminally
[55:00.260 --> 55:05.420]  charge him in Europe saying you can't say that this is the bullying they think
[55:05.420 --> 55:08.780]  they've broken our will they haven't think so here's the deal
[55:08.780 --> 55:14.140]  Mr. know it all maybe you don't know what Islam's all about so you come out
[55:14.140 --> 55:21.660]  to cry it force but see you're not and you want to sit here and try to
[55:21.660 --> 55:25.460]  intimidate us and shut us up from reporting this and that's not ever
[55:25.460 --> 55:32.020]  going to happen now to the viewers you want us to fight globalism the sword of
[55:32.020 --> 55:35.300]  the New World Order is Islam you want us to stand up for freedom you want to
[55:35.300 --> 55:39.860]  promote sovereignty we're doing and I'm very honored to be under attack by all
[55:39.860 --> 55:44.060]  these people but I'm here to tell you if you want to support the broadcast go

[56:02.980 --> 56:09.060]  you to see because we are so effective they know we got Trump elected they know
[56:09.060 --> 56:13.660]  you got Trump elected they know nationalism is rising and globalism is
[56:13.660 --> 56:18.620]  in great crisis and globalism's alliance with Islam will be their final
[56:18.620 --> 56:24.620]  fall but you look at this guy that owns shabani coming from nowhere hooked in
[56:24.620 --> 56:29.180]  George Soros the UN involved in this whole program which the UN admits has
[56:29.180 --> 56:32.940]  been to end Western civilization and you understand it's part of a large
[56:32.940 --> 56:36.940]  globalist operation which we are standing against and that's why they're
[56:36.940 --> 56:40.300]  trying to shut us down so if you're not supporting us if you're not praying for
[56:40.300 --> 56:43.940]  us if you're not spreading the word about infill wars you're doing to your
[56:43.940 --> 56:50.100]  own detriment we have products you absolutely need and they are hoping that
[56:50.100 --> 56:53.940]  you just see us as out there fighting for you and don't realize you're fighting
[56:53.940 --> 56:57.300]  with us they're hoping you don't take action because if you spread the word
[56:57.300 --> 57:01.060]  and spread our articles and videos and get past the censors and the bots and
[57:01.060 --> 57:04.820]  if you buy our products nothing can stop you and we will defeat these people
[57:04.820 --> 57:09.940]  this is my fight this is your fight this is our fight against a bunch of
[57:09.940 --> 57:14.140]  authoritarian globalist third world populations allied with a global elite
[57:14.140 --> 57:17.820]  who are totally cold-blooded this is world war three it's economic it's
[57:17.820 --> 57:23.340]  cultural and we will win it and in closing this is a spiritual battle all
[57:23.340 --> 57:29.180]  of us as imperfect as we are need to hit our knees before the Son of God Jesus
[57:29.180 --> 57:35.820]  Christ and ask that he give us guidance and that he intercede with the Father to
[57:35.820 --> 57:41.420]  give us the will and the determination and the judgment to lead God and direct
[57:41.420 --> 57:49.660]  us with the discernment it takes to break the purely wicked and foul spirited
[57:49.660 --> 57:55.020]  system of globalism Islam and modern liberalism that is all combined as a
[57:55.020 --> 57:59.620]  trifecta of evil against us but our trifecta is much stronger you won't
[57:59.620 --> 58:04.980]  find it in the globalist churches you'll find it your heart and soul and in your
[58:04.980 --> 58:10.060]  communion with God in that quiet place of the Most High that we have the Father
[58:10.060 --> 58:14.700]  the Son of the Holy Ghost and we are unstoppable but this is the epic fight
[58:14.700 --> 58:18.940]  and we are standing against the Islamist's economic takeover and all
[58:18.940 --> 58:22.860]  their bullying and if you breathe air into our sails and financially support
[58:22.860 --> 58:27.580]  us and spread our links and articles and pray for us we are unstoppable because
[58:27.580 --> 58:34.660]  you are unstoppable because our God the God of liberty and justice and freedom
[58:34.660 --> 58:41.540]  and life is the true God and we'll cross the satanic God of Islam you are

[1:00:30.900 --> 1:00:34.660]  night we're gonna be joined in the next segment with Gerald Salenty I'm gonna ask
[1:00:34.660 --> 1:00:39.580]  him what he thinks about world politics where the trends are of course he has
[1:00:39.580 --> 1:00:43.860]  trends journal so we're gonna talk to Gerald Salenty starting in the next
[1:00:43.860 --> 1:00:48.460]  segment but of course you just heard alex jones talking about the lawsuit
[1:00:48.460 --> 1:00:53.340]  from Chabani yogurt founder and I think it's interesting because today in the
[1:00:53.340 --> 1:00:58.300]  news we have senator Chuck Schumer and he said this he said if bright barred in
[1:00:58.300 --> 1:01:01.820]  New York Times you give an equal credibility you worry about this
[1:01:01.820 --> 1:01:06.820]  democracy this is a guy who said the founding fathers is this quote he goes
[1:01:06.820 --> 1:01:12.020]  on morning Joe yesterday he said the founding fathers created a country that
[1:01:12.020 --> 1:01:16.060]  was based on fact well actually they created a country that was based on a
[1:01:16.060 --> 1:01:20.220]  constitution on the rule of law but nevertheless it was factual but you
[1:01:20.220 --> 1:01:23.740]  don't want to talk about the facts in the Constitution do you send your
[1:01:23.740 --> 1:01:27.460]  Schumer second amendment other things like that you just don't like that but
[1:01:27.460 --> 1:01:30.460]  he said then we debated the facts we debate them at constitutional convention we
[1:01:30.460 --> 1:01:34.100]  debate them at the town hall throughout America but we're supposed to debate
[1:01:34.100 --> 1:01:38.900]  them in the legislature we don't have a fact base if say bright Bart news and the
[1:01:38.900 --> 1:01:42.020]  New York Times are regarded with equal credibility you worry about this
[1:01:42.020 --> 1:01:46.500]  democracy well you know the simple fact is that he switches this of course from
[1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:54.500]  facts to attacking entire news sites understand this the news isn't fake
[1:01:54.500 --> 1:01:59.060]  because bright Bart says it and the news isn't true because the New York Times
[1:01:59.060 --> 1:02:05.380]  says it what a simplistic lie this guy is trying to sell us Chuck Schumer one of
[1:02:05.380 --> 1:02:12.460]  the founding funders of Chobani yogurt and when I did that report the thing
[1:02:12.460 --> 1:02:17.900]  that bothered me about it was the fact that we had this puff PR piece from CVS
[1:02:17.900 --> 1:02:23.780]  is 60 minutes as we had heard the previous year oh this is all a lie there
[1:02:23.780 --> 1:02:27.500]  wasn't anything that even happened this is all being made up snopes said this is
[1:02:27.500 --> 1:02:33.380]  mostly a lie and of course they threw in some straw man arguments that were
[1:02:33.380 --> 1:02:37.620]  things that I quite frankly had not even seen people mentioned to say that it was
[1:02:37.620 --> 1:02:43.460]  mostly fake but as we saw these people that week admit and plead guilty the
[1:02:43.460 --> 1:02:49.260]  felonies these minors immediately CVS does this puff PR piece for this guy who
[1:02:49.260 --> 1:02:54.900]  is so well connected it's the crony capitalism you know the idea that this
[1:02:54.900 --> 1:03:00.060]  guy would be able to buy a yogurt factory with a small business loan
[1:03:00.060 --> 1:03:06.180]  $800,000 $800,000 nearly a million dollars you know I was in business my
[1:03:06.180 --> 1:03:09.900]  father and both of my grandfathers were in their own small businesses their
[1:03:09.900 --> 1:03:14.820]  entire life they never got a grant from the government but this guy who's not
[1:03:14.820 --> 1:03:17.820]  even American citizen comes in here and they give him nearly a million dollars
[1:03:17.820 --> 1:03:21.460]  and what does he do with it well he buys this factory but then he turns around he
[1:03:21.460 --> 1:03:26.060]  takes he gets an $800,000 loan from a small business association they
[1:03:26.060 --> 1:03:29.380]  have the gall to call him an entrepreneur I think there's another
[1:03:29.380 --> 1:03:35.740]  word for that crony capitalist and what he does according to the Albany Times
[1:03:35.740 --> 1:03:40.700]  Union is he gets encouragement from New York Senators Chuck Schumer and
[1:03:40.700 --> 1:03:46.260]  Gallibrand so in New York he cozies up to these people and according to open
[1:03:46.260 --> 1:03:52.580]  secrets he spent $700,000 lobbying them so he gets $800,000 in the small
[1:03:52.580 --> 1:03:58.460]  business association he spent 700,000 of it lobbying these founding funders that
[1:03:58.460 --> 1:04:02.260]  we have in the government now what a great return on investment because then
[1:04:02.260 --> 1:04:08.820]  with that he leverages himself into the $15 billion school lunch program how's
[1:04:08.820 --> 1:04:15.180]  that for return on investment makes me sick to see this kind of crony capitalism
[1:04:15.180 --> 1:04:20.580]  going on to see our country being colonized this is neocolonialism you
[1:04:20.580 --> 1:04:24.380]  know we used to have bread and circuses in the old Roman Empire today we've got
[1:04:24.380 --> 1:04:28.820]  Greek yogurt and video games just set there American Eloi while these

[1:04:35.740 --> 1:04:59.740]  right back with Gerald Salmenti
[1:04:59.740 --> 1:05:04.900]  on Saturday Pope Francis made the outlandish statement that refugee camps
[1:05:04.900 --> 1:05:08.580]  are like concentration camps this is not the first time Pope Francis has made a
[1:05:08.580 --> 1:05:12.380]  Nazi reference in wake of the election of Donald Trump like a good liberal the
[1:05:12.380 --> 1:05:15.660]  Pope warned of populist leaders like Hitler rising to power but now the
[1:05:15.660 --> 1:05:19.140]  pontiff has made the comparison of refugee camps to concentration camps
[1:05:19.140 --> 1:05:23.180]  what a lewd statement refugees are going to these centers to avoid starvation
[1:05:23.180 --> 1:05:26.820]  suffering and death while Jewish people were forced into concentration camps
[1:05:26.820 --> 1:05:29.900]  with the starvation suffering and death he made this statement while paying
[1:05:29.900 --> 1:05:33.300]  tribute to a Christian woman who was slaughtered by Muslims for her faith he
[1:05:33.300 --> 1:05:36.700]  then heartlessly said that international accords seem more important than human
[1:05:36.700 --> 1:05:40.620]  rights the Pope while at a ceremony honoring modern-day Christian martyrs
[1:05:40.620 --> 1:05:44.500]  to Islam is at the same time shoving open borders down your throat so that
[1:05:44.500 --> 1:05:47.820]  all countries can be invaded and murdered by these jihadists as their
[1:05:47.820 --> 1:05:51.900]  human right ignoring anyone else's human right to living in a sovereign country
[1:05:51.900 --> 1:05:55.740]  funny how the Pope has a problem with refugee camps still silent on the wars

[1:08:19.820 --> 1:08:30.380]  welcome back to the alex jones show I'm David Knight on this Tuesday April 25th
[1:08:30.380 --> 1:08:36.380]  2017 I talked to Gerald Salenty the founder and editor of trends research
[1:08:36.380 --> 1:08:41.580]  journal and also trends research institute and of course Gerald has been
[1:08:41.580 --> 1:08:46.140]  very active in terms of promoting peace around the world he had the occupy
[1:08:46.140 --> 1:08:51.420]  peace organization that he set up I had rallies this last fall so I want to talk
[1:08:51.420 --> 1:08:57.700]  to Gerald about how he sees things going economically but also the war and
[1:08:57.700 --> 1:09:02.380]  peace issues because we're now seeing that Donald Trump talked to the UN
[1:09:02.380 --> 1:09:07.620]  National Security Council yesterday at the White House he'll be meeting I think
[1:09:07.620 --> 1:09:14.020]  it's today with all 100 senators from within the White House again talking
[1:09:14.020 --> 1:09:18.540]  about the North Korean situation and Gerald let's get your comments on that
[1:09:18.540 --> 1:09:24.380]  are you optimistic about this working out peacefully or do you think this is
[1:09:24.380 --> 1:09:28.060]  something that they're pushing for war you know I've been hearing about North
[1:09:28.060 --> 1:09:33.900]  Korea just about all my life I mean this is a poor country I think North Korea
[1:09:33.900 --> 1:09:38.820]  didn't they invade Iraq because Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass
[1:09:38.820 --> 1:09:47.500]  destruction I was at Libya because Gaddafi has to go maybe maybe it was
[1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:53.380]  Syria I think that they started that with the Arab League no no I know North
[1:09:53.380 --> 1:09:59.140]  Korea's in Afghanistan for the longest war probably in their history oh no I
[1:09:59.140 --> 1:10:04.420]  think they just sent troops down to Somalia I mean this is a country of nothing
[1:10:04.420 --> 1:10:12.340]  yeah so yeah what this is it's more war propaganda it's what Eisenhower warned
[1:10:12.340 --> 1:10:18.020]  us of that the military industrial complex is robbing the nation of the
[1:10:18.020 --> 1:10:22.700]  genius of the scientists the sweat of the laborers and the future of the
[1:10:22.700 --> 1:10:29.620]  children just look what happened last week in the USA hey lights went out in
[1:10:29.620 --> 1:10:36.340]  San Francisco huh hey are you Silicon Valley cats no lights on hey what happened
[1:10:36.340 --> 1:10:43.020]  there in LA went down to here in New York don't take the subway man it's a
[1:10:43.020 --> 1:10:49.660]  night in Calcutta they closed down all the time but war everywhere and when I
[1:10:49.660 --> 1:10:55.260]  listened to this guy that's in charge of the Defense Department James quote mad
[1:10:55.260 --> 1:11:01.300]  dog Mattis what adult would call himself bad dog and I hear the words that
[1:11:01.300 --> 1:11:05.420]  they're speaking you know I don't know if it's going to be North Korea but I'll
[1:11:05.420 --> 1:11:10.060]  tell you what I think it's going to be and what we're forecasting and that is
[1:11:10.060 --> 1:11:15.060]  they're heating up a war with Iran Israel keeps coming out warning us about
[1:11:15.060 --> 1:11:20.340]  Iran Matt this was over there last week with Netanyahu and they're talking about
[1:11:20.340 --> 1:11:25.660]  Iran you hear Tillerson one after another talking about Iran being the
[1:11:25.660 --> 1:11:29.980]  greatest sponsor of terrorism in the world those are their quotes not mine
[1:11:29.980 --> 1:11:36.020]  or to paraphrase don't want to get sued you know oh by the way that Kobani
[1:11:36.020 --> 1:11:41.340]  place that you were talking about up here in New York State I believe I don't
[1:11:41.340 --> 1:11:46.660]  want to be misquoted but I believe they also got about five million dollars in
[1:11:46.660 --> 1:11:50.500]  tax breaks oh yeah oh yeah that's the thing that we see happening and of
[1:11:50.500 --> 1:11:56.260]  course is happening in Idaho as well they get state and local subsidies like
[1:11:56.260 --> 1:12:00.700]  all the big companies do for the for graciously opening up their business but
[1:12:00.700 --> 1:12:05.380]  who pays for that individuals workers and small businesses subsidize these big
[1:12:05.380 --> 1:12:08.940]  corporations just like the NFL owners and their stadiums and then he also
[1:12:08.940 --> 1:12:14.500]  Gerald gets subsidized labor because these refugees come with subsidies from
[1:12:14.500 --> 1:12:17.860]  the federal government so what a deal you get the government to open up your
[1:12:17.860 --> 1:12:21.580]  factory for you and then they bring in some subsidized labor for you as well
[1:12:21.580 --> 1:12:26.980]  that's right it's it's it look it's called the merger of state and corporate
[1:12:26.980 --> 1:12:33.620]  powers a paisano of mine that I'm not too fond of Mussolini called it fascism
[1:12:33.620 --> 1:12:39.580]  yes so let's call this spade a spade oh and I could say that now without being
[1:12:39.580 --> 1:12:44.700]  called a racist now little bomb is out of office that's right yeah they they can
[1:12:44.700 --> 1:12:48.860]  today they don't call it economic fascism they call it public private
[1:12:48.860 --> 1:12:54.060]  partnerships and we're the ones that they're PPPing down our backs and
[1:12:54.060 --> 1:12:58.660]  telling us that it's raining right you got Josie Wales so yeah it's a day in
[1:12:58.660 --> 1:13:03.300]  slave land to you so going back to the wars this country's falling apart at
[1:13:03.300 --> 1:13:08.220]  every level and the stock market's not a reflection of what's going on you guys
[1:13:08.220 --> 1:13:14.300]  know the facts what 51% of the working people in America with full-time jobs
[1:13:14.300 --> 1:13:23.060]  making $30,000 or less you know the story 5% of all the dough created since
[1:13:23.060 --> 1:13:32.540]  2009 went to the 95% of all the money went to 5% so what we're looking at is
[1:13:32.540 --> 1:13:37.340]  we're wasting the monies on war you know they keep talking about watch out for
[1:13:37.340 --> 1:13:41.140]  the Russians watch out for the Russians what's Trump increasing the budget
[1:13:41.140 --> 1:13:48.740]  54 billion bucks Russia's total budget defense budget ours is over 600 billion
[1:13:48.740 --> 1:13:53.660]  theirs is 48 billion dollars so our increases way bigger than their entire
[1:13:53.660 --> 1:13:59.540]  budget already exactly yes yes so what we're saying what we're seeing here is
[1:13:59.540 --> 1:14:05.180]  an escalation all of a sudden one day within 24 hours what Sam boom hey let's
[1:14:05.180 --> 1:14:09.740]  send missiles into Syria we'll show them hey how about the mother of all bombs
[1:14:09.740 --> 1:14:13.820]  and by the way I was the father of all bombs who they're gonna drop that one
[1:14:13.820 --> 1:14:17.820]  on I mean you can't make this stuff up yeah exactly you know one of the things
[1:14:17.820 --> 1:14:22.460]  that interests me too and of course you understand this Gerald that as we're
[1:14:22.460 --> 1:14:26.340]  talking about refugees as we're talking about the war this is all related to
[1:14:26.340 --> 1:14:30.300]  regime change this is part of the globalist plan to flood our countries to
[1:14:30.300 --> 1:14:35.100]  flood the West with refugees fleeing the war one of the things that I objected
[1:14:35.100 --> 1:14:40.780]  to about this puff piece that CBS 60 minutes did with Ulukaya was the fact
[1:14:40.780 --> 1:14:44.220]  that he comes on and they just portrayed him as a jobs creator we just talked
[1:14:44.220 --> 1:14:46.740]  about all the subsidies that he gets for his factories and his workers but he
[1:14:46.740 --> 1:14:49.780]  said they're not refugees if you give him a job well you know what they're not
[1:14:49.780 --> 1:14:54.700]  refugees if you stop the war that you created in their country to drive them
[1:14:54.700 --> 1:14:59.380]  in and and Gerald we've just seen the Russians as well as the Chinese move
[1:14:59.380 --> 1:15:04.260]  massive amounts of military to the border that they have with North Korea
[1:15:04.260 --> 1:15:07.780]  because they're concerned about a massive flood of refugees coming into
[1:15:07.780 --> 1:15:12.340]  their country if there is a economic meltdown from the sanctions or if there
[1:15:12.340 --> 1:15:17.460]  is a war they know they can't absorb massive amounts of refugees no country
[1:15:17.460 --> 1:15:21.380]  can it isn't a racist thing it isn't that the Chinese are racist against the
[1:15:21.380 --> 1:15:24.580]  North Koreans or the Russians are racist against them you simply can't do it
[1:15:24.580 --> 1:15:28.140]  that's the way you destroy a country so they have positioned their troops there
[1:15:28.140 --> 1:15:31.940]  at the border of course we don't have troops to protect our borders because
[1:15:31.940 --> 1:15:36.500]  we're abroad fighting wars everywhere aren't we yes and that's the part of
[1:15:36.500 --> 1:15:41.860]  occupied peace dot US because it's only about us and that's one of the things
[1:15:41.860 --> 1:15:47.180]  close all the bases overseas bring the troops back and protect our borders yes
[1:15:47.180 --> 1:15:51.860]  that's one of the elements the other run of course is force Congress to vote to go
[1:15:51.860 --> 1:15:57.740]  to war rather than El Presidente of Los Espados Sanitas who's it's a it's it's
[1:15:57.740 --> 1:16:01.420]  a violation of the Constitution and Congress has not voted to go to war
[1:16:01.420 --> 1:16:07.940]  since World War two and number three is to have a ballot on each state a
[1:16:07.940 --> 1:16:11.940]  referendum where we'll tell Congress how to vote because they don't send their
[1:16:11.940 --> 1:16:16.820]  kids to vote to fight wars we do so we pay for the war with our money in our
[1:16:16.820 --> 1:16:21.020]  lives and I want to go back to what you said first about the refugee problem and
[1:16:21.020 --> 1:16:27.540]  you're one of the few people that also says it what caused the refugee problem
[1:16:27.540 --> 1:16:33.660]  why don't we put together a blue ribbon panel and maybe we could figure it out
[1:16:33.660 --> 1:16:41.780]  you know oh you mean you destroy it a rock killed over a million people oh I
[1:16:41.780 --> 1:16:45.380]  wonder how they got radicalized can't figure that one out either that's right
[1:16:45.380 --> 1:16:50.420]  oh in Afghanistan oh they're coming from Afghanistan wonder why and you know the
[1:16:50.420 --> 1:16:58.420]  fact David that when Gaddafi warned Europe that if they took him down the
[1:16:58.420 --> 1:17:04.860]  refugees would be flowing into Italy and into Europe and because he had made a
[1:17:04.860 --> 1:17:11.420]  deal with Berlusconi and the other leaders of European countries that he
[1:17:11.420 --> 1:17:16.700]  would prohibit the flood of migrants coming out of Africa the poorer
[1:17:16.700 --> 1:17:26.620]  countries and going from Libya into Europe and then when the Nobel Peace of
[1:17:26.620 --> 1:17:35.980]  Crap Prize winner the arrogant Obama said Gaddafi has to go we wrote about in
[1:17:35.980 --> 1:17:48.860]  the Trends Journal in the summer edition 2011 over 500,000 Libyans escape the
[1:17:48.860 --> 1:17:56.440]  slaughter that those liberals are so sorry that the Obama and Hillary Clinton
[1:17:56.440 --> 1:18:03.900]  are gone that caused it no one talks about how this happened and one other
[1:18:03.900 --> 1:18:09.240]  point I like to make in what you said it's not racist if you don't want
[1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:15.820]  refugees go back to the Great Depression I mentioned how bad this
[1:18:15.820 --> 1:18:20.260]  country is doing for we the little people who have to work for a living
[1:18:20.260 --> 1:18:27.300]  when the depression hit they stopped everybody from coming in until the
[1:18:27.300 --> 1:18:32.820]  country rebuilt itself we have two hundred and twenty three hundred and
[1:18:32.820 --> 1:18:39.260]  twenty million people we can't take care of our own I got a great idea let's
[1:18:39.260 --> 1:18:44.540]  bring in another hundred million yes yes it's an engineered takedown and you
[1:18:44.540 --> 1:18:48.300]  point out they knew this they were warned by Gaddafi and of course as this
[1:18:48.300 --> 1:18:52.140]  thing was going on we have emails that WikiLeaks gave us where they're talking
[1:18:52.140 --> 1:18:56.780]  about the fact that fighters are coming into Libya they're identifying people
[1:18:56.780 --> 1:19:00.860]  just by identifying them as being black and killing them so you talk about black
[1:19:00.860 --> 1:19:04.500]  lives matter well it didn't really matter to Hillary Clinton or to Barack
[1:19:04.500 --> 1:19:09.620]  Obama when they wanted to do the takedown of Libya they want to create
[1:19:09.620 --> 1:19:14.540]  chaos and war in these countries so they can create a flood of refugees and
[1:19:14.540 --> 1:19:17.220]  tell us there's nothing that could be done about it we just have to bring
[1:19:17.220 --> 1:19:21.460]  these people in so then they can create chaos and terrorism in our countries as
[1:19:21.460 --> 1:19:25.900]  well that's what the whole plan is that's what concerns me so much about this
[1:19:25.900 --> 1:19:28.620]  turnaround with the Trump administration we didn't vote for this we
[1:19:28.620 --> 1:19:33.660]  didn't vote for Lindsey Graham but now Lindsey Graham is a static about the
[1:19:33.660 --> 1:19:36.980]  government that he has he says it's what he's wanted for eight years he's so
[1:19:36.980 --> 1:19:40.660]  excited about this I'm very concerned about it quite frankly I see Paul
[1:19:40.660 --> 1:19:45.980]  Wolfowitz very optimistic now about Trump Elliot Abrams loves him all the
[1:19:45.980 --> 1:19:49.620]  only thing wrong with Trump says Elliot Abrams is he's got to get rid of Steve
[1:19:49.620 --> 1:19:53.460]  Bannon so when I look at these things it really concerns me the direction that
[1:19:53.460 --> 1:19:58.020]  they're going after making a very initial a great start I'm worried really
[1:19:58.020 --> 1:20:00.700]  worried about where this is going stay with us to be right back with Gerald

[1:24:18.740 --> 1:24:22.540]  to Gerald Salenty in just a moment as I pointed out earlier we have Chuck Schumer
[1:24:22.540 --> 1:24:28.580]  saying that there is an existential threat to democracy if we if they rather
[1:24:28.580 --> 1:24:33.260]  lose the domination of the narrative that's why he comes out says hey if you
[1:24:33.260 --> 1:24:38.820]  say Breitbart and New York Times are given equal credibility then democracy
[1:24:38.820 --> 1:24:43.500]  will collapse no their control of our government will collapse if people start
[1:24:43.500 --> 1:24:48.020]  to look not at the source but at what people are saying then it will collapse
[1:24:48.020 --> 1:24:52.500]  we want you to think for yourself then you have to understand this lawsuit from
[1:24:52.500 --> 1:24:57.660]  Chabani is about trying to silence alternative media alternative to the
[1:24:57.660 --> 1:25:02.100]  mockingbird media that the CIA has been controlling the narrative with for a
[1:25:02.100 --> 1:25:06.420]  very long time it's not about the source it's about the information you're
[1:25:06.420 --> 1:25:10.100]  intelligent enough to read the information to make that decision for
[1:25:10.100 --> 1:25:14.700]  yourself but they don't want you to hear any voices other than theirs other than
[1:25:14.700 --> 1:25:19.020]  their controlled New York Times and we have pointed this out for a very long
[1:25:19.020 --> 1:25:22.300]  time and we're winning this information war that's why they're coming at us now
[1:25:22.300 --> 1:25:26.500]  with the lawsuits that's why they're going after people of Fox News anybody
[1:25:26.500 --> 1:25:29.800]  they think is conservative they're coming after them talking about sexual
[1:25:29.800 --> 1:25:33.300]  harassment even going after Sean Hannity one of the nicest guys in media
[1:25:33.300 --> 1:25:37.940]  probably and trying to make up charges about him he's not gonna take it we're
[1:25:37.940 --> 1:25:41.300]  not gonna take it but we need your support and we do appreciate your support
[1:25:41.300 --> 1:25:48.180]  and we have to offer you something for your support we have dropped caveman
[1:25:48.180 --> 1:25:54.420]  which we had for 33% we've taken additional 20% off so it's now 53% off
[1:25:54.420 --> 1:25:58.900]  that's our true paleo formula and as we've talked about before bone broth
[1:25:58.900 --> 1:26:02.580]  homemade soups chicken soup that's something that people have known about
[1:26:02.580 --> 1:26:08.780]  for a very long time is very effective in terms of a primal superfood but we've
[1:26:08.780 --> 1:26:11.500]  taken the nutrients that are in high-quality bone broth and we've
[1:26:11.500 --> 1:26:14.860]  combined that with other things like turmeric root look up turmeric root
[1:26:14.860 --> 1:26:18.540]  look at the health benefits of just that one thing but of course it's got bone
[1:26:18.540 --> 1:26:22.180]  broth turmeric root chaga mushroom bee pollen all these different things it's
[1:26:22.180 --> 1:26:27.420]  the ultimate and paleo nutrition now 53% off that's the deepest I've seen

[1:26:59.620 --> 1:27:03.340]  that but I also want to talk about the election that's going on in France and
[1:27:03.340 --> 1:27:08.420]  this Rothschild banker that comes in they talk about him as being a centrist
[1:27:08.420 --> 1:27:12.660]  so much you would think that was his first name he's actually a central
[1:27:12.660 --> 1:27:19.460]  bankerist isn't he. Yes he is and first I'd like to say that I buy Alex Jones

[1:27:39.500 --> 1:27:43.780]  you for supporting us really. Yeah and everyone listening really if they want
[1:27:43.780 --> 1:27:49.580]  to keep the truth out and free it's very important that they support the
[1:27:49.580 --> 1:27:53.620]  shows like yours and put their money where their mind is. Yeah and you were
[1:27:53.620 --> 1:27:57.820]  talking about as I call them the prestitute media first you were talking
[1:27:57.820 --> 1:28:02.980]  about little Chuckie Schumer little boy of nothing why would any adult why
[1:28:02.980 --> 1:28:09.780]  would any thinking adult listen to a little clown of nothing like him Lindsey
[1:28:09.780 --> 1:28:16.380]  Graham John insane McCain what's that other guy Paulie but what did he play
[1:28:16.380 --> 1:28:22.700]  Eddie Munster Ryan I mean look at these Diane not so fine Stein Nancy out of
[1:28:22.700 --> 1:28:29.980]  her mind Pelosi what adults would listen to these people throw out their crap
[1:28:29.980 --> 1:28:39.100]  and swallow it you know the discussion of what they think is shows you what
[1:28:39.100 --> 1:28:44.540]  lunacy is going on you know there's interesting headline Gerald about Paul
[1:28:44.540 --> 1:28:49.340]  Ryan they call him on WND they said he's Beaver Cleaver at home but he's Eddie
[1:28:49.340 --> 1:28:54.900]  Haskell in DC I that's a perfect description a little by the way you
[1:28:54.900 --> 1:28:59.220]  know as you know you know my career I began in politics I used to run
[1:28:59.220 --> 1:29:04.060]  political campaigns in Westchester County I was a number two guy right at a
[1:29:04.060 --> 1:29:08.500]  graduate school running the mayoral campaign of Yonkers not a small city
[1:29:08.500 --> 1:29:13.500]  about 300,000 people I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State
[1:29:13.500 --> 1:29:18.540]  Senate I designed and instructed American politics and campaign technology
[1:29:18.540 --> 1:29:22.860]  and taught it at St. John's University and I could go on I'm making the point
[1:29:22.860 --> 1:29:28.380]  that these people all these names that we mentioned these are the same people
[1:29:28.380 --> 1:29:32.100]  you couldn't stand in high school in college that wanted to be class
[1:29:32.100 --> 1:29:36.140]  president and head of the student council absolutely absolutely and of
[1:29:36.140 --> 1:29:41.060]  course we would add to that list Nikki Haley who this month is the head of the
[1:29:41.060 --> 1:29:45.540]  UN Security Council so she gets to show all of her pictures to get people to go
[1:29:45.540 --> 1:29:50.740]  to war stay with us to be right back with Gerald Salenty we're on the March
[1:29:50.740 --> 1:29:58.580]  the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:30:01.100 --> 1:30:06.740]  try not laughing at this headline survey one in five adults in the United
[1:30:06.740 --> 1:30:10.780]  Kingdom can't change a light bulb or boil an egg this according to a survey of
[1:30:10.780 --> 1:30:14.460]  more than 2,000 people on their habits around the house listen to some of these
[1:30:14.460 --> 1:30:20.060]  shocking statistics 31% of people could not cook a meal without a recipe 34% of

[1:30:31.300 --> 1:30:36.140]  shelf a shelf now while this survey was done in the UK I wouldn't be shocked if
[1:30:36.140 --> 1:30:39.580]  you got some of the same results in big cities here in the United States this is
[1:30:39.580 --> 1:30:43.260]  a perfect example of how modern-day education systems and lifestyles are
[1:30:43.260 --> 1:30:57.540]  domesticating our society so that we cannot function independently this is

[1:33:46.940 --> 1:33:51.260]  old centrist they all say he's a centrist he jets to Berlin to give
[1:33:51.260 --> 1:33:56.300]  speeches in English the blue and yellow banner of the EU flutters off his
[1:33:56.300 --> 1:34:00.140]  campaign headquarters and of course Nigel Franch says well he gave his
[1:34:00.140 --> 1:34:04.580]  acceptance speech with the EU banner fluttering behind him that says it all
[1:34:04.580 --> 1:34:08.180]  and I would agree it says it all as long as he would maybe put a corporate
[1:34:08.180 --> 1:34:13.820]  sponsorship of Ross child bank on his suit like a NASCAR racer because these
[1:34:13.820 --> 1:34:16.820]  are the guys who put him in there and one last thing here Washington Post
[1:34:16.820 --> 1:34:21.860]  talking about the European Union they call it a 28 nation club maybe making a
[1:34:21.860 --> 1:34:26.380]  comeback you know what as George Carlin said it's a club and you ain't in it
[1:34:26.380 --> 1:34:30.660]  folks you got no say about what's going on in this special club and we need to
[1:34:30.660 --> 1:34:33.620]  get out of that club and take our government's back that's what this
[1:34:33.620 --> 1:34:38.820]  election is about isn't it Gerald it is and and again you you pointed out to
[1:34:38.820 --> 1:34:43.500]  they use the term centrist oh yeah what's the centrist I mean it's so more
[1:34:43.500 --> 1:34:47.740]  ironic corporate right wing left wing you know grow up and when you look you
[1:34:47.740 --> 1:34:52.860]  know what the French people just did they're putting in their Obama that's
[1:34:52.860 --> 1:34:57.980]  all this guy is yes he's another Obama another guy full of crap that knows
[1:34:57.980 --> 1:35:05.100]  nothing another little boy that lies his way into office and won't do anything
[1:35:05.100 --> 1:35:11.380]  other than keep the status quo going another little liar that plays whatever
[1:35:11.380 --> 1:35:18.300]  is being played out capitalizes on it wins over those people and then plays
[1:35:18.300 --> 1:35:23.940]  the centrist role which actually means keeping the club as you mentioned George
[1:35:23.940 --> 1:35:29.100]  Carlin we're not members in it never will be keeping them from rape keeping
[1:35:29.100 --> 1:35:35.620]  them alive so they can rape every dime and life out of us that they can so
[1:35:35.620 --> 1:35:40.500]  that's who they put into office so now we have to say the French was stupid as
[1:35:40.500 --> 1:35:45.020]  everybody else and I used to think that they were really smart but boy by
[1:35:45.020 --> 1:35:49.100]  putting it but look who they had if we look at the clown that they got there
[1:35:49.100 --> 1:35:54.860]  now Halon look at the jerk they had behind him a little warm longer of a
[1:35:54.860 --> 1:36:01.540]  nothing guy saw cozy that took out along with Obama and another little jerk I
[1:36:01.540 --> 1:36:06.820]  should say wanker because he's English Cameron who also just started
[1:36:06.820 --> 1:36:11.540]  the war in Libya so when you look around the world and look what you have I
[1:36:11.540 --> 1:36:16.740]  guess the people are getting what they deserve because they're putting in one
[1:36:16.740 --> 1:36:21.980]  little jerk after another yes and of course we're talking about Sarkozy and
[1:36:21.980 --> 1:36:27.140]  Halon who is the first the first French president to not run for reelection
[1:36:27.140 --> 1:36:32.300]  why one of the reasons is because he angered his socialist base by pandering
[1:36:32.300 --> 1:36:38.660]  to the bankers in Brussels and the guy who enacted those policies was Macron
[1:36:38.660 --> 1:36:43.340]  who Halon brought into his administration because Rothschild wanted him
[1:36:43.340 --> 1:36:48.380]  there basically he bought his way out of his government service for 50,000
[1:36:48.380 --> 1:36:54.140]  euros then spending four years with Rothschild he becomes extremely wealthy
[1:36:54.140 --> 1:36:57.980]  and then they insert him into a socialist government so that's why you had
[1:36:57.980 --> 1:37:01.700]  this fracturing of the Socialist Party there but of course they also reported
[1:37:01.700 --> 1:37:06.620]  how he was partying after the election with Sarkozy and all of his bling-bling
[1:37:06.620 --> 1:37:10.100]  celebrities which is what they call them in France so this is a guy who is
[1:37:10.100 --> 1:37:13.740]  equally at home with all of the establishment that's why they call him a
[1:37:13.740 --> 1:37:17.500]  centrist because they don't want to label him as being with one party or the
[1:37:17.500 --> 1:37:22.340]  other no he's with the globalists in Brussels he's with the bankers he's a
[1:37:22.340 --> 1:37:29.020]  central bankerist is what he is you see now in what they will try to do but of
[1:37:29.020 --> 1:37:34.300]  course they can't do it with this one is call you Mr. Knight a conspiracy
[1:37:34.300 --> 1:37:40.540]  theorist oh yeah the fact is this cat is from the Rothschild Club he has his
[1:37:40.540 --> 1:37:45.300]  credentials right there here are the papers does anybody need any more proof
[1:37:45.300 --> 1:37:50.780]  no you're a conspiracy theorist no I'm not here's the proof oh yeah just because
[1:37:50.780 --> 1:37:54.980]  he was the Rothschilds that doesn't mean he was with the Rothschilds just like
[1:37:54.980 --> 1:38:01.540]  they got another slimer over there who's the head of the ECB Mario Draghi yeah
[1:38:01.540 --> 1:38:05.980]  the former head of the Goldman Sachs gangs division over there in Europe now
[1:38:05.980 --> 1:38:10.980]  running the European Central Bank hey let's take a trip to the UK who's a
[1:38:10.980 --> 1:38:14.380]  central banks during charge over there
[1:38:14.380 --> 1:38:21.300]  Carney yeah carnival man oh yeah wasn't he with Goldman Sachs too hey look at the
[1:38:21.300 --> 1:38:30.140]  clown running Australia turnbull or is it turn BS bull yeah another Goldman
[1:38:30.140 --> 1:38:37.060]  Sachs cat huh one after another that's right it's a banker takeover oh and
[1:38:37.060 --> 1:38:42.340]  everybody out there say oh Salenty lower your voice you'll be coming angry hey get
[1:38:42.340 --> 1:38:46.940]  this in your head if Jesus Christ could pick up a whip and drive the money
[1:38:46.940 --> 1:38:51.780]  changes out of the temple hey an act of violence right by the Prince of Peace to
[1:38:51.780 --> 1:38:56.860]  get rid of the banksters that were ruining people's lives I could be angry
[1:38:56.860 --> 1:39:02.600]  about it because I don't like getting shafted by the Wall Street gang and the
[1:39:02.600 --> 1:39:09.260]  gold Goldman Sachs gang the Merrill Lynch mob and all of the rest oh and all
[1:39:09.260 --> 1:39:14.740]  you liberals out there that are crying your crocodile tears that Hitler he didn't
[1:39:14.740 --> 1:39:21.460]  win and Obama is gone he didn't prosecute one of the criminals that
[1:39:21.460 --> 1:39:28.300]  committed felonies convicted of felonies the banks not one head roll oh
[1:39:28.300 --> 1:39:33.460]  just like this little clown that just got elected in France Obama lied his way
[1:39:33.460 --> 1:39:39.260]  into the your into office promising we the little people that the banksters
[1:39:39.260 --> 1:39:45.620]  would pay for their criminal acts and didn't bring one of them to justice you
[1:39:45.620 --> 1:39:50.660]  know what they call bringing people to justice killing somebody overseas I
[1:39:50.660 --> 1:39:56.700]  brought Osama bin Laden to justice I blew his brains out oh I didn't do it I
[1:39:56.700 --> 1:40:01.260]  hired my front men to do it because I couldn't fight my way out of a paper
[1:40:01.260 --> 1:40:06.500]  bag but we'll call it bringing them to justice that's how distorted it's
[1:40:06.500 --> 1:40:11.300]  become and what you said before David about this becoming a neocolonial
[1:40:11.300 --> 1:40:18.740]  society it's a neo feudal society there's different rules for the political
[1:40:18.740 --> 1:40:24.060]  nobility and the economic elite yeah well the economic elite want to
[1:40:24.060 --> 1:40:28.940]  eliminate the Western middle class and so that's exactly what they're doing you
[1:40:28.940 --> 1:40:33.140]  have this guy on we talked about it at the end of February February 27th we had
[1:40:33.140 --> 1:40:38.260]  an article in info wars calm lapins Rothschild rival who says Muslim mass
[1:40:38.260 --> 1:40:43.380]  migration is unstoppable he said get used to it he said we entered a world of
[1:40:43.380 --> 1:40:47.420]  great migrations and we will have more of it we will have more of it because
[1:40:47.420 --> 1:40:51.540]  that's what they want that's what the bankers want they want to take down the
[1:40:51.540 --> 1:40:56.300]  middle class in America and Western Europe they want to have a clash of
[1:40:56.300 --> 1:41:00.540]  cultures they want to have chaos they want to have terrorism so they will be
[1:41:00.540 --> 1:41:04.500]  in the catbird seat here he says we've entered a world of great migrations he
[1:41:04.500 --> 1:41:08.660]  goes it's going to be in the coming decades migrations from geopolitical
[1:41:08.660 --> 1:41:13.620]  conflicts that of course the bankers will set up rich man's war poor man's
[1:41:13.620 --> 1:41:17.460]  fight and they're gonna bring the fight home to our shores that's what they're
[1:41:17.460 --> 1:41:21.620]  gonna do with this mass migration that is the aftermath of these wars that they
[1:41:21.620 --> 1:41:27.500]  want to set up abroad yeah and again you know as we talk about bringing in
[1:41:27.500 --> 1:41:31.820]  migrants and other people coming into the country and the people that support
[1:41:31.820 --> 1:41:37.220]  it here's what I say to them open your house to them bring them in yeah for the
[1:41:37.220 --> 1:41:43.220]  health care pay for their education you want them in bring them in yeah adopt
[1:41:43.220 --> 1:41:47.460]  them yourself be responsible for them yeah exactly I don't want to bring in
[1:41:47.460 --> 1:41:53.300]  another person into this country until this nation rebuilds itself look here
[1:41:53.300 --> 1:41:57.660]  you pick up today's Wall Street Journal I was just looking at it we're ready to go
[1:41:57.660 --> 1:42:02.900]  on the air you look at the front page story
[1:42:03.060 --> 1:42:11.340]  parents are drowning in college loan debt over 330,000 in the United States and
[1:42:11.340 --> 1:42:18.820]  US programs haven't made a payment in at least a year well there's suffering in
[1:42:18.820 --> 1:42:25.580]  this country economically again only the economic elite are making it to the
[1:42:25.580 --> 1:42:32.620]  top so does not make sense to me to bring in more people when you can't take
[1:42:32.620 --> 1:42:37.060]  care of your own and again all these people that are shooting off their mouths
[1:42:37.060 --> 1:42:42.660]  and taking to the streets in these protests bring them into your house put
[1:42:42.660 --> 1:42:48.700]  your money where your mouth is educate them pay for their health care feed them
[1:42:48.700 --> 1:42:54.260]  we can't feed our own right now and you want to bring in more it doesn't make
[1:42:54.260 --> 1:42:58.540]  sense to me a good example of that is the H1B visa program of course they say
[1:42:58.540 --> 1:43:02.300]  we have to bring in these individuals sometimes there's a reason to bring in
[1:43:02.300 --> 1:43:05.260]  somebody who's a specialist in another field but that's not the way they're
[1:43:05.260 --> 1:43:10.220]  using it they're using it to replace people in many middle-level positions
[1:43:10.220 --> 1:43:15.060]  because they can hire cheaper labor from India or other places just as we saw at
[1:43:15.060 --> 1:43:18.660]  Disney and elsewhere they told the Americans you're going to train your
[1:43:18.660 --> 1:43:23.140]  replacements who are bringing in here under the H1B visa program or you're
[1:43:23.140 --> 1:43:27.700]  not going to get any kind of severance pay out of this so they basically twist
[1:43:27.700 --> 1:43:31.260]  their arms doing that but they're bringing in these people in many cases
[1:43:31.260 --> 1:43:35.820]  putting out engineers at entry-level positions people who've gone to college
[1:43:35.820 --> 1:43:40.100]  to get a degree they've gone into debt to get a degree but also we have illegal
[1:43:40.100 --> 1:43:44.180]  aliens who come in here under the dreamer program and general they get in
[1:43:44.180 --> 1:43:50.540]  state tuition because at any state that they want to go to I mean even
[1:43:50.540 --> 1:43:55.380]  Americans they're always put ahead of the line of Americans even when it comes
[1:43:55.380 --> 1:43:58.780]  to something like that an American if you you have to live in that particular
[1:43:58.780 --> 1:44:01.540]  state and only in that state can you get an end state tuition if you're a
[1:44:01.540 --> 1:44:05.780]  foreign citizen Kremlin trespassing in this country you can go anywhere you
[1:44:05.780 --> 1:44:11.140]  want and get at the head of the line you know David I wrote about H1B visas in
[1:44:11.140 --> 1:44:18.540]  my book trends 2000 in its national bestseller back in 1996 I showed how it
[1:44:18.540 --> 1:44:23.340]  was a whole scheme from Silicon Valley to bring in cheap labor so they wouldn't
[1:44:23.340 --> 1:44:27.580]  have to pay the people in this country a living wage when they could get away
[1:44:27.580 --> 1:44:36.300]  with it and the whole the entire push to bring in immigrants and refugees going
[1:44:36.300 --> 1:44:41.660]  back was the National Association of manufacturers when we had manufacturers
[1:44:41.660 --> 1:44:47.860]  in this country and Silicon Valley it was a con job by the Silicon con men to
[1:44:47.860 --> 1:44:52.740]  bring in cheap labor that's all of this is about yeah absolutely and you know
[1:44:52.740 --> 1:44:57.140]  we've seen some movement by the Trump administration to curb that that's one
[1:44:57.140 --> 1:45:00.300]  of the things that he had talked about his campaign and I'm glad to see him do
[1:45:00.300 --> 1:45:04.740]  it one of the things to Gerald and I wanted to get your take on this was we
[1:45:04.740 --> 1:45:08.900]  saw today that they announced that the Trump administration is going to look
[1:45:08.900 --> 1:45:14.940]  at the abuse that the executive orders that Barack Obama filed to use the
[1:45:14.940 --> 1:45:19.460]  antiquities act to take massive amounts of land especially throughout the West
[1:45:19.460 --> 1:45:24.500]  he was calling everything a monument part of the antiquities act which would
[1:45:24.500 --> 1:45:30.660]  have been set up to save some specific artifact of culture and just like he
[1:45:30.660 --> 1:45:37.420]  abused the 1917 espionage act he also abused this ancient piece of legislation
[1:45:37.420 --> 1:45:42.740]  to take millions upon millions of acres and this is something that is a big
[1:45:42.740 --> 1:45:46.820]  issue out West and the Trump administration has now taken the lead
[1:45:46.820 --> 1:45:51.660]  saying that they're going to go back and look about 20 years at the abuse of
[1:45:51.660 --> 1:45:59.300]  this particular tactic and possibly undo some of these takings of land yeah I
[1:45:59.300 --> 1:46:02.900]  don't I don't know much about that so I you know I'm not gonna really comment on
[1:46:02.900 --> 1:46:07.340]  I haven't really been following that but what I you know again there are on the
[1:46:07.340 --> 1:46:12.820]  economic issues I agree a lot of what Trump is doing and when you looked at
[1:46:12.820 --> 1:46:17.300]  the poll that came out for example in his low ratings is 100 you know the first
[1:46:17.300 --> 1:46:22.540]  hundred days but then you look at what his most popular position on that polling
[1:46:22.540 --> 1:46:29.980]  is 73% of the people support him where he's wanting to bring back jobs and
[1:46:29.980 --> 1:46:34.980]  create jobs in the United States that's right putting America first exactly
[1:46:34.980 --> 1:46:41.700]  yes so those issues I'm I'm totally for it on the foreign policy issues he's done
[1:46:41.700 --> 1:46:47.220]  a 180 on it yeah came out said well how useless NATO is which it is and now he's
[1:46:47.220 --> 1:46:54.900]  backtracked on that and the UN and the UN as he was saying the UN is is is doing
[1:46:54.900 --> 1:46:59.100]  an awful job and yet what do we see we see him going exactly opposite you're
[1:46:59.100 --> 1:47:03.580]  talking about the Occupy peace situation I'm very concerned that he brings in the
[1:47:03.580 --> 1:47:06.660]  United Nations Security Council to the White House before he talks to anybody
[1:47:06.660 --> 1:47:11.460]  from Congress and it sounds like the type of thing that we saw going back a few
[1:47:11.460 --> 1:47:14.940]  years ago when Jeff Sessions was talking to Leon Panetta we all remember that
[1:47:14.940 --> 1:47:18.980]  clip and Jeff Sessions is saying well you know what would you do and Jeff's and
[1:47:18.980 --> 1:47:22.420]  Leon Panetta says well we might notify you after the fact but we're going to
[1:47:22.420 --> 1:47:27.540]  make the decision with the UN with NATO and we might advise Congress after the
[1:47:27.540 --> 1:47:30.340]  fact and Jeff Sessions says wait a minute you're a congressman you know the
[1:47:30.340 --> 1:47:35.060]  Constitution says Congress is supposed to declare law of the the war according
[1:47:35.060 --> 1:47:39.980]  to the law and they have this back and forth but now it looks like that's what's
[1:47:39.980 --> 1:47:43.500]  going on with North Korea we'll have to wait and see but it certainly is
[1:47:43.500 --> 1:47:47.580]  troubling for me to see the order in which this is happening first the UN
[1:47:47.580 --> 1:47:51.580]  then the Senate then the House is going to be advised by the White House and
[1:47:51.580 --> 1:47:56.740]  again you look at who he's stacked the administration with yes loaded with
[1:47:56.740 --> 1:48:02.100]  defense contractors and generals I want to read you a quote this is a guy our
[1:48:02.100 --> 1:48:09.660]  US Defense Secretary Mattis mad dog quote you go into Afghanistan you got
[1:48:09.660 --> 1:48:15.020]  guys who slapped women around for five years because they don't wear a veil
[1:48:15.020 --> 1:48:22.500]  guys like that ain't got no manhood anyway it's a hell of a lot of fun to
[1:48:22.500 --> 1:48:30.260]  shoot them mm-hmm I mean this is coming from an adult is another one from him
[1:48:30.260 --> 1:48:36.940]  I'm gonna plead with you do not cross us if you do survivors will write about
[1:48:36.940 --> 1:48:43.580]  what we do here for 10,000 years he's talking about the US occupation of
[1:48:43.580 --> 1:48:49.900]  Afghanistan what are we doing over there it was a war I broke up George Bush's
[1:48:49.900 --> 1:48:55.500]  speech to the American people in one of our trends journal nine days after 911
[1:48:55.500 --> 1:49:02.020]  I wrote this is how I began it only a madman would speak these words and only
[1:49:02.020 --> 1:49:08.740]  people dumbstruck with fear would believe them and believe they did there was
[1:49:08.740 --> 1:49:14.420]  no proof of anything that we should have gone into Afghanistan there's a man by
[1:49:14.420 --> 1:49:19.940]  the name of Osama bin Laden and he been hiding there yes so well we're gonna go
[1:49:19.940 --> 1:49:24.180]  over there and we're gonna rid of those tally band or the Taliban is that what
[1:49:24.180 --> 1:49:29.460]  Jimmy Carter created to get the Russians out of there oh no it's an
[1:49:29.460 --> 1:49:35.740]  Mujahideen too oh that's the one Osama bin Laden was part of I mean everybody
[1:49:35.740 --> 1:49:39.900]  forgets these things well of course they've got a lot of lithium Gerald they
[1:49:39.900 --> 1:49:43.540]  got a lot of lithium that they use for batteries they as they they're the
[1:49:43.540 --> 1:49:47.740]  lithium they are to lithium what Saudi Arabia is to oil that's one of the
[1:49:47.740 --> 1:49:51.900]  reasons that we're there of course they also have massive production of poppies
[1:49:51.900 --> 1:49:56.220]  for the opiates and that has skyrocketed since we've gone back there so we've got
[1:49:56.220 --> 1:50:00.620]  real reasons for being there don't we Gerald well no the reason they invaded
[1:50:00.620 --> 1:50:07.500]  Libya that and Iraq was because of their broccoli crops it wasn't because they
[1:50:07.500 --> 1:50:14.860]  were sitting on Libya the finest sweet crude on the planet that only cost a
[1:50:14.860 --> 1:50:19.780]  dollar to get out of the ground and the 10th largest reserve oil reserves and
[1:50:19.780 --> 1:50:24.460]  what does Iraq have the second or third largest oil reserves you know it had
[1:50:24.460 --> 1:50:28.340]  nothing to do with that of course and it doesn't have anything to do with the
[1:50:28.340 --> 1:50:31.780]  pipelines that are competing to come across it has nothing to do with any of
[1:50:31.780 --> 1:50:36.380]  that has to do with freedom and democracy all right we're gonna take a

[1:54:19.580 --> 1:54:24.020]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're talking to Gerald
[1:54:24.020 --> 1:54:28.500]  Salenty we're going to ask him what he sees in terms of trends going forward we
[1:54:28.500 --> 1:54:32.820]  have everybody's gonna be looking backward at the first 100 days of Donald
[1:54:32.820 --> 1:54:37.140]  Trump but I want to get Gerald's ideas as to where he sees the trends going in
[1:54:37.140 --> 1:54:40.540]  the future because that's what Gerald does at trendsresearch.com he takes a
[1:54:40.540 --> 1:54:44.980]  look at trends projects them into the future before we do real quickly I just
[1:54:44.980 --> 1:54:49.260]  remind you that we have a I would say one of the biggest discounts if not the
[1:54:49.260 --> 1:54:53.900]  biggest discount I've ever seen off a product 53% off caveman that's our
[1:54:53.900 --> 1:54:58.980]  true paleo formula you'll find at info wars store.com that's an additional 20
[1:54:58.980 --> 1:55:03.500]  percent off the already huge 33% off special that we were running and this
[1:55:03.500 --> 1:55:06.820]  is for a limited time only while supplies last I imagine that's not going to be
[1:55:06.820 --> 1:55:12.580]  very long it is based on a high quality bone broth and it has more than seven
[1:55:12.580 --> 1:55:16.620]  different primal superfoods to help support healthy muscles to fight free
[1:55:16.620 --> 1:55:20.220]  radicals and many other things and of course it's got things like turmeric root
[1:55:20.220 --> 1:55:24.980]  chaga mushroom bee pollen and of course bone broth that really is the ultimate
[1:55:24.980 --> 1:55:30.900]  and true paleo nutrition you'll find it at info wars store.com at 53% off and
[1:55:30.900 --> 1:55:35.500]  one of my favorite products I just remind you of is brain force brain force
[1:55:35.500 --> 1:55:39.380]  plus this is a review that we have our review of the day from Colin he says
[1:55:39.380 --> 1:55:44.460]  this is a staple product for him well along with bio true selenium and x2
[1:55:44.460 --> 1:55:47.780]  that's our nascent iodine product he says I'm a technician I drive all around
[1:55:47.780 --> 1:55:51.620]  my area brain force keeps me alert and able to focus for both troubleshooting
[1:55:51.620 --> 1:55:56.700]  and for being on the road it helps with mental clarity and with focus I love it
[1:55:56.700 --> 1:56:00.620]  and I would say I absolutely agree it's my favorite supplement that we have I
[1:56:00.620 --> 1:56:05.300]  would have called it brain focus after using it if they would have asked me but
[1:56:05.300 --> 1:56:09.620]  of course they had it already and it is a great formulation you can find that at
[1:56:09.620 --> 1:56:17.580]  info wars store.com Gerald as we're looking ahead of course there's I
[1:56:17.580 --> 1:56:20.740]  think it's really the economy we're very concerned we've talked about our
[1:56:20.740 --> 1:56:25.740]  concern about what's going on abroad but are we going to see some major moves
[1:56:25.740 --> 1:56:29.300]  here at home you know we had all these people protesting on April 15th all these
[1:56:29.300 --> 1:56:33.980]  socialists who are upset about Donald Trump's taxes I'm upset about my taxes
[1:56:33.980 --> 1:56:38.460]  maybe these people don't pay any taxes they want to see his tax forms I want
[1:56:38.460 --> 1:56:43.540]  to see his tax reforms that he campaigned on I want him to audit the Fed maybe
[1:56:43.540 --> 1:56:47.860]  find out if this guy Ulukaya is still a Turkish citizen I mean that'd be one of
[1:56:47.860 --> 1:56:50.940]  the things that we can find in this lawsuit I hope we can do discovery
[1:56:50.940 --> 1:56:54.900]  because when Lee Stranahan did the articles at Breitbart he called him up
[1:56:54.900 --> 1:56:58.300]  and he said hey is this guy still a Turkish citizen they wouldn't give him a
[1:56:58.300 --> 1:57:02.260]  yes or no answer they said no comment so maybe when we do discovery we can get a
[1:57:02.260 --> 1:57:08.100]  yes or no comment as to whether this guy is still a Turkish citizen and setting
[1:57:08.100 --> 1:57:11.980]  on the New York Fed creating economic policy force but what do you think about
[1:57:11.980 --> 1:57:17.780]  tax reform what do you think about the getting rid of repealing Obamacare what
[1:57:17.780 --> 1:57:23.380]  do you see coming along the pike economically you know I did a 180 on
[1:57:23.380 --> 1:57:30.180]  the economy when Trump got elected we had forecast the massive decline and we
[1:57:30.180 --> 1:57:36.660]  changed it right away within three days four days and the markets have held that
[1:57:36.660 --> 1:57:42.580]  up what we had forecast because the people that he's brought in whether it's
[1:57:42.580 --> 1:57:48.540]  Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary Wilbur Ross or Commerce Secretary you know
[1:57:48.540 --> 1:57:53.860]  that these guys are smart they're smart in what they do in that field and if they
[1:57:53.860 --> 1:57:59.340]  do it for the purpose of we the people they are lousy trade deals they're
[1:57:59.340 --> 1:58:04.420]  stupid they make absolutely no sense at all for example you see what goes on
[1:58:04.420 --> 1:58:08.540]  with China you want to sell your automobiles there the taxes to bring
[1:58:08.540 --> 1:58:13.220]  them in are ridiculously high so they force you to manufacture them over
[1:58:13.220 --> 1:58:17.500]  there and you have to build a partnership with a Chinese company we're
[1:58:17.500 --> 1:58:19.940]  running out of time so hang on we're gonna got another five minutes with
[1:58:19.940 --> 1:58:23.500]  Gerald Salenty on the other side of the top of the hour stay with us going to

[1:59:57.900 --> 2:00:17.340]  coming to you from the former United States of America from deep in the heart
[2:00:17.340 --> 2:00:22.140]  of Texas it's Alex Jones
[2:00:22.140 --> 2:00:28.060]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight we have Gerald Salenty for
[2:00:28.060 --> 2:00:32.500]  one more segment and he was just getting to the point of talking about how they
[2:00:32.500 --> 2:00:37.660]  did a 180 on their economic forecast after Donald Trump won and of course he
[2:00:37.660 --> 2:00:44.660]  saw the stock market do a 180 after after Donald Trump won tell us what you see
[2:00:44.660 --> 2:00:49.540]  coming economically Gerald yes so I was mentioning doing business with shine it's
[2:00:49.540 --> 2:00:53.340]  a dirty deal they get the best that you can't you can't buy out a company in
[2:00:53.340 --> 2:00:57.340]  China you have to become a partner in it and a minority partner so you have a guy
[2:00:57.340 --> 2:01:02.260]  like Wilbur Ross renegotiating these deals it's going to be for the betterment
[2:01:02.260 --> 2:01:07.060]  of the nation the tax breaks the deregulation of again whether you're
[2:01:07.060 --> 2:01:11.380]  in favor or not in favor of it we don't look at it like that we say what are the
[2:01:11.380 --> 2:01:15.660]  implications going to be and the implication is it's a positive for the
[2:01:15.660 --> 2:01:21.820]  economy in the absence of a wild card event we're first of all we're looking
[2:01:21.820 --> 2:01:26.580]  for a correction in the market you know they nothing goes straight up we're
[2:01:26.580 --> 2:01:32.140]  looking for about a 10% correction but again we're not looking for a crash in
[2:01:32.140 --> 2:01:38.460]  the absence of a wild card a wild card could be a war a wild card could be a
[2:01:38.460 --> 2:01:45.940]  terrorist strike or slag are real so in the absence of that we see continuing growth and a
[2:01:45.940 --> 2:01:51.540]  positive outlook for the economy under the Trump administration well that's
[2:01:51.540 --> 2:01:56.340]  good yeah I hope that they do get tax reform in of course I said at the very
[2:01:56.340 --> 2:02:00.340]  beginning I think the biggest opponent that Donald Trump was going to have in
[2:02:00.340 --> 2:02:03.780]  terms of getting his campaign promises through is going to be Paul Ryan or
[2:02:03.780 --> 2:02:08.180]  already seeing this we just had him come out of course it was a sabotaging of
[2:02:08.180 --> 2:02:11.940]  the repeal of Obamacare because Paul Ryan doesn't want to see Obamacare
[2:02:11.940 --> 2:02:16.460]  repealed or replaced he never had a plan to do it they ran on it for multiple
[2:02:16.460 --> 2:02:19.740]  elections but of course they never had a plan at least Donald Trump had a plan
[2:02:19.740 --> 2:02:24.180]  that was not what was put forward what was put forward was something that was
[2:02:24.180 --> 2:02:29.460]  incredibly complex evolving to the very last minute so many people said we're
[2:02:29.460 --> 2:02:32.300]  not going to do this again we're not going to vote for something that we
[2:02:32.300 --> 2:02:36.980]  haven't seen so it was designed to fail but they failed to even try to repeal
[2:02:36.980 --> 2:02:41.580]  Obamacare and of course that in and of itself is a gigantic tax we see many
[2:02:41.580 --> 2:02:44.380]  of the insurance companies going bankrupt as well as the people who need
[2:02:44.380 --> 2:02:49.220]  insurance yeah that's one of the issues and you know I also just to go back to
[2:02:49.220 --> 2:02:52.860]  one second I just thought of this you know you're seeing Trump doing
[2:02:52.860 --> 2:02:57.460]  reversals on certain things like he wasn't in favor of low interest rates
[2:02:57.460 --> 2:03:03.500]  and his candidate Obama Obama Trump Obama Trump Greenberg Iceberg what's the
[2:03:03.500 --> 2:03:09.300]  difference to change your mind but he was against yelling yes the Fed share
[2:03:09.300 --> 2:03:15.100]  and now he's saying that she's okay he was against low interest rates and now
[2:03:15.100 --> 2:03:19.700]  he's saying they're okay here's that here's the danger that I see within the
[2:03:19.700 --> 2:03:24.540]  Trump administration as the Goldman Sachs gang yes they're in favor of
[2:03:24.540 --> 2:03:30.700]  multi multinationalization very good favor of globalization mm-hmm and they're
[2:03:30.700 --> 2:03:36.580]  in place that's how you talked about Bannon being sidelined and he's being
[2:03:36.580 --> 2:03:41.980]  sidelined because he's also not in favor of what a Gary Cohn in Trump's
[2:03:41.980 --> 2:03:46.660]  administration the guy that was what president of Goldman Sachs or a very
[2:03:46.660 --> 2:03:50.820]  high executive level yeah I think he was number two yes yes yeah and they did
[2:03:50.820 --> 2:03:54.140]  all kinds of strings and gave him all kinds of golden parachutes to get him
[2:03:54.140 --> 2:03:58.700]  out and to get him in there and of course he's being pushed forward by Jared
[2:03:58.700 --> 2:04:03.740]  Kushner a lifelong Democrat so it's a it's very concerning to see where this
[2:04:03.740 --> 2:04:09.780]  might change so going back to the the whole aspect of it we see a positive
[2:04:09.780 --> 2:04:15.140]  economic growth opportunity however we also see a lot of dangers out there
[2:04:15.140 --> 2:04:19.340]  because you have to take a global view hey having a happy day over there in
[2:04:19.340 --> 2:04:23.380]  Venezuela today oh what happened over there in Turkey where they just put it
[2:04:23.380 --> 2:04:28.300]  in somebody's taken over a lot of power with a new Constitution and then you
[2:04:28.300 --> 2:04:33.700]  have Syria, you have Iraq, you have Afghanistan, the American troops now in Somalia yeah
[2:04:33.700 --> 2:04:37.940]  so we still look at gold as a safe haven asset absolutely thank you so much
[2:04:37.940 --> 2:04:42.420]  Gerald Salenty you can find him at trendsresearch.com of course he
[2:04:42.420 --> 2:04:46.900]  publishes Trends Journal as you just heard he knows where things are going
[2:04:46.900 --> 2:04:50.460]  stay with us when we come back we're going to talk to a Breitbart Texas
[2:04:50.460 --> 2:04:54.860]  award-winning journalist about the drug cartels that's what he specializes in
[2:04:54.860 --> 2:05:00.140]  stay with us we'll be right back
[2:05:00.980 --> 2:05:06.580]  try not laughing at this headline survey one in five adults in the United
[2:05:06.580 --> 2:05:10.580]  Kingdom can't change a light bulb or boil an egg this according to a survey of
[2:05:10.580 --> 2:05:14.260]  more than 2,000 people on their habits around the house listen to some of these
[2:05:14.260 --> 2:05:19.900]  shocking statistics 31% of people could not cook a meal without a recipe 34% of
[2:05:19.900 --> 2:05:25.940]  people cannot read a map 38% of people could not unclog a sink 47% of people
[2:05:25.940 --> 2:05:31.140]  don't know how to check oil levels in a car 53% of people could not put up a
[2:05:31.140 --> 2:05:35.980]  shelf a shelf now while this survey was done in the UK I wouldn't be shocked if
[2:05:35.980 --> 2:05:39.420]  you got some of the same results in big cities here in the United States this is
[2:05:39.420 --> 2:05:43.100]  a perfect example of how modern-day education systems and lifestyles are
[2:05:43.100 --> 2:05:57.340]  domesticating our society so that we cannot function independently this is
[2:05:57.340 --> 2:06:04.140]  Owen shroyer today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our
[2:06:04.140 --> 2:06:08.300]  ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of
[2:06:08.300 --> 2:06:13.140]  processed junk we are now introducing caveman by infowarslife.com the ultimate

[2:06:26.860 --> 2:06:30.380]  our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture them
[2:06:30.380 --> 2:06:34.700]  everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal you use the meat for
[2:06:34.700 --> 2:06:39.140]  sustenance the fat for cooking but you use the bones for strength from the
[2:06:39.140 --> 2:06:43.340]  outside structure full of minerals and kiko factors to the marrow that produces
[2:06:43.340 --> 2:06:47.780]  the blood for the body this is the engine of the life essence I'm a long way
[2:06:47.780 --> 2:06:51.500]  from the caveman my ancestors were but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to
[2:06:51.500 --> 2:06:55.140]  that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it I know

[2:07:55.940 --> 2:08:00.500]  revolutionary today then for war store.com
[2:08:05.100 --> 2:08:12.340]  live from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:08:12.340 --> 2:08:21.180]  and now your host David Knight welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this
[2:08:21.180 --> 2:08:26.540]  Tuesday April 25 2017 I'm David Knight we're going to talk to Ildefonso Ortiz
[2:08:26.540 --> 2:08:31.340]  he is an award-winning journalist at Breitbart, Texas he co-founded the
[2:08:31.340 --> 2:08:35.740]  cartel Chronicles project with Brandon Darby and Stephen K. Bannon. Mr. Ortiz
[2:08:35.740 --> 2:08:41.420]  has focused his investigations on Mexican drug cartels border corruption and the
[2:08:41.420 --> 2:08:46.140]  Mexican narco politicians so we've had a lot of news of course the top of the
[2:08:46.140 --> 2:08:50.980]  dredge report today is another brick in the wall showing Paul Ryan there and the
[2:08:50.980 --> 2:08:56.620]  border patrol criticizing him for shutting down or delaying funding on the
[2:08:56.620 --> 2:09:01.340]  border wall so I'd like to talk to Mr. Ortiz about that as well as get his
[2:09:01.340 --> 2:09:07.100]  comments on the violence that we've seen with the MS-13 gangs that began a long
[2:09:07.100 --> 2:09:13.060]  time ago in LA with El Salvador and immigrants and now we see a lot of crime
[2:09:13.060 --> 2:09:18.380]  in Maryland and on Long Island so welcome Mr. Ortiz. Thanks thanks for
[2:09:18.380 --> 2:09:22.100]  having me. One of the things we've seen is the Border Patrol Union president
[2:09:22.100 --> 2:09:27.820]  very angry about Paul Ryan saying that he's going to delay this border wall and
[2:09:27.820 --> 2:09:32.220]  of course we can always talk about the the politics of this whether it might
[2:09:32.220 --> 2:09:36.540]  have been wise to use the government shutdown as leverage to try to get a
[2:09:36.540 --> 2:09:40.340]  deal on the border wall nevertheless they took a look at the politics of it
[2:09:40.340 --> 2:09:43.580]  they made the decision they're there on the ground I won't second guess them on
[2:09:43.580 --> 2:09:47.500]  that but of course it's Paul Ryan who doesn't really want to fight for this
[2:09:47.500 --> 2:09:54.340]  and they asked Brandon Judd who is the Border Patrol Union president they said
[2:09:54.340 --> 2:09:58.660]  and he said President Trump promised he was going to secure the border and part
[2:09:58.660 --> 2:10:02.020]  of securing the border is putting in place proper technology and resources
[2:10:02.020 --> 2:10:05.740]  that allow us to be successful as border agents and a border wall in
[2:10:05.740 --> 2:10:10.300]  strategic locations is one of those things that must get done your comments
[2:10:10.300 --> 2:10:14.660]  as someone who's studied the immigration issue for quite some time. Well
[2:10:14.660 --> 2:10:18.420]  absolutely you gotta look at the border in some areas for example in Laredo
[2:10:18.420 --> 2:10:22.860]  where there is literally nothing the rippers are about knee-deep in some
[2:10:22.860 --> 2:10:26.740]  areas and the Mexican drug cartels particularly Los Settas which is one of
[2:10:26.740 --> 2:10:30.580]  the most dangerous ones they know this and they use that area as one of the
[2:10:30.580 --> 2:10:36.220]  strategic crossing point and basically they have unimpeded access into the US
[2:10:36.220 --> 2:10:41.420]  in those key areas for example like Laredo Border Patrol is understaffed and
[2:10:41.420 --> 2:10:46.940]  they're overwhelmed by the traffic by these organized crime syndicates so you
[2:10:46.940 --> 2:10:52.540]  know delaying funding delaying all this all it's doing is helping these drug
[2:10:52.540 --> 2:10:58.860]  cartels continue their basically their reign and because cartels control most
[2:10:58.860 --> 2:11:03.380]  of northern Mexico they have once set up an alternate form of government where
[2:11:03.380 --> 2:11:07.700]  they are actually in control of the region and sadly they've actually that
[2:11:07.700 --> 2:11:12.340]  has trickled into the US you know there was a story about a week or so ago and
[2:11:12.340 --> 2:11:15.260]  it might have been Breibart story I don't recall who the source was on it but
[2:11:15.260 --> 2:11:20.180]  they were talking about how I think it's about 60 miles of the border and one
[2:11:20.180 --> 2:11:24.420]  particular Border Patrol jurisdiction the guy who was in charge of that
[2:11:24.420 --> 2:11:28.220]  basically kept everybody away from there so they had absolutely not only did not
[2:11:28.220 --> 2:11:33.500]  have a fence but they didn't have any Border Patrols whatsoever and the other
[2:11:33.500 --> 2:11:37.300]  Border Patrol agents were furious about that they said what is this is this
[2:11:37.300 --> 2:11:42.100]  political correctness or is it corruption either way when you have a
[2:11:42.100 --> 2:11:45.700]  situation like this and we're looking at the violence in Maryland we're looking
[2:11:45.700 --> 2:11:50.260]  at the violence in Long Island if people come here because they want to get a
[2:11:50.260 --> 2:11:53.820]  job or because they want to get into the American education system whatever
[2:11:53.820 --> 2:11:57.740]  their reasons for coming here coming across the border illegally if they're
[2:11:57.740 --> 2:12:01.780]  coming here even peacefully they're going to be followed by these gang
[2:12:01.780 --> 2:12:05.500]  members if we don't have any control of our border and what we're seeing in
[2:12:05.500 --> 2:12:10.180]  Maryland and in Long Island are people who are Hispanic who are the ones who
[2:12:10.180 --> 2:12:14.580]  are being singled out the most at this moment by MS-13 and these other gangs
[2:12:14.580 --> 2:12:18.060]  that are there they're focusing on these people who have come here as immigrants
[2:12:18.060 --> 2:12:21.980]  so the crime is following them into the country if we don't have anybody
[2:12:21.980 --> 2:12:25.820]  patrolling the border well one of the things we have to remember is that
[2:12:25.820 --> 2:12:29.940]  nothing crosses the river nothing crosses the fence nothing crosses that line
[2:12:29.940 --> 2:12:35.220]  without one of the cartels having a say so 20 years ago was very different you
[2:12:35.220 --> 2:12:38.700]  know people could actually cross try to look for the American dream and that
[2:12:38.700 --> 2:12:43.700]  stuff that has changed it's changed in the 2000s when the Luzetas began to
[2:12:43.700 --> 2:12:48.620]  basically set out territories where they were actually ruling over those
[2:12:48.620 --> 2:12:53.300]  areas and they controlled the media they control politicians they control the
[2:12:53.300 --> 2:12:57.340]  military and they basically set up a form of government and that has spread
[2:12:57.340 --> 2:13:02.540]  out to the other cartels so nobody can cross that border without paying the
[2:13:02.540 --> 2:13:08.340]  cartels to be able to have permission to cross through that area now sadly with
[2:13:08.340 --> 2:13:15.540]  the MS-13 these individuals as dangerous as they are and as as the attention as
[2:13:15.540 --> 2:13:19.740]  they have brought to themselves in the US they're actually only employees of the
[2:13:19.740 --> 2:13:23.460]  Mexican drug cartels they have been hired out they're basically gunmen for
[2:13:23.460 --> 2:13:27.700]  hire they've care a lot of the violent acts that they've done in the US have
[2:13:27.700 --> 2:13:33.060]  been linked to the cartels and the MS-13 have been the gunmen that have been
[2:13:33.060 --> 2:13:37.860]  carrying out those hits or those violent acts so they're just the tip of the
[2:13:37.860 --> 2:13:41.820]  iceberg that the visible tip of the iceberg so when when Attorney General
[2:13:41.820 --> 2:13:47.620]  Sessions says they're going to look at MS-13 as organized crime maybe they're
[2:13:47.620 --> 2:13:51.700]  not looking at the right level that is correct they need to look at the
[2:13:51.700 --> 2:13:55.500]  Mexican cartels for the actual bosses the problem with that is that they would
[2:13:55.500 --> 2:14:00.300]  have to look at the Mexican politicians who protect those cartels and that's
[2:14:00.300 --> 2:14:03.580]  where you get into politics yeah that's what they don't want to do tell us
[2:14:03.580 --> 2:14:10.260]  about the cartel Chronicles project basically in Mexico journalists are
[2:14:10.260 --> 2:14:14.500]  not able to report on organized crime because it involves politicians and it
[2:14:14.500 --> 2:14:19.580]  involves cartels so either one of those can quash them in an incident the
[2:14:19.580 --> 2:14:23.740]  problem with that is that you have raging violence in Mexico where people
[2:14:23.740 --> 2:14:28.740]  basically have been kidnapped murdered you have raging gun battles at any time
[2:14:28.740 --> 2:14:33.740]  of the day you have mass murder where people have been incinerated in ovens
[2:14:33.740 --> 2:14:39.060]  in places like Coahuila where entire towns have been erased from the map so
[2:14:39.060 --> 2:14:43.460]  when you have all this violence going on and it's being silenced nobody's
[2:14:43.460 --> 2:14:47.540]  reporting on it the journalists that are able to report it are basically told
[2:14:47.540 --> 2:14:51.820]  that you either stay quiet or you will be killed so what's happening is that the
[2:14:51.820 --> 2:14:55.060]  US media is not covering those violent incidents because they don't have
[2:14:55.060 --> 2:15:00.220]  sources down there and what we did was basically we reached out to a handful of
[2:15:00.220 --> 2:15:04.820]  brave journalists and a handful of citizen journalists who are in those
[2:15:04.820 --> 2:15:09.500]  cities and that are willing to risk themselves to say this is happening in
[2:15:09.500 --> 2:15:14.020]  my town you may not hear this from the Mexican government you may not hear this
[2:15:14.020 --> 2:15:19.060]  from an NGO you may not hear this from US media but I'm telling you this is
[2:15:19.060 --> 2:15:22.340]  happening in my town and we've been very successful with that project
[2:15:22.340 --> 2:15:26.420]  basically giving them a voice protecting them and letting them tell us their
[2:15:26.420 --> 2:15:30.420]  story and that's what we've actually been running the stories in English and
[2:15:30.420 --> 2:15:33.980]  Spanish because it's sort of an information boomerang the info comes
[2:15:33.980 --> 2:15:37.500]  from Mexico into the US and then people from Mexico are able to read what's
[2:15:37.500 --> 2:15:43.740]  happening in their towns where you know as well as our readers in the US are
[2:15:43.740 --> 2:15:48.100]  able to know what's actually going on in Mexico very important how many
[2:15:48.100 --> 2:15:53.940]  casualties would you say that Mexico has had with these cartel drug wars well
[2:15:53.940 --> 2:15:56.580]  you're talking about the hundreds of thousands the problem with those
[2:15:56.580 --> 2:16:00.740]  statistics is that the government does not keep accurate statistics yep this
[2:16:00.740 --> 2:16:05.260]  for example in Coahuila or in in Veracruz or in Tamolipas where the
[2:16:05.260 --> 2:16:09.860]  government made a concerted effort to hide the actual number of casualties it
[2:16:09.860 --> 2:16:13.380]  would have these fierce firefights between cartel gunmen and the military
[2:16:13.380 --> 2:16:17.260]  where dozens were killed but the government would actually say two
[2:16:17.260 --> 2:16:22.740]  people were wounded or one person died and in reality you had these massive
[2:16:22.740 --> 2:16:26.420]  numbers of people that were killed also when you have cartel and cartel
[2:16:26.420 --> 2:16:31.620]  violence those bodies are actually incinerated dipped in acid or basically
[2:16:31.620 --> 2:16:35.380]  just made to disappear they end up in shallow graves that's why in recent
[2:16:35.380 --> 2:16:39.740]  years in Mexico you've had a lot of mass graves that have been discovered with
[2:16:39.740 --> 2:16:44.180]  hundreds of bodies that you know they were never reported missing they were
[2:16:44.180 --> 2:16:47.820]  never the people and they don't know who they are because the all these people
[2:16:47.820 --> 2:16:51.980]  are the unknown victims of the cartel violence that are not in any statistics
[2:16:51.980 --> 2:16:56.020]  or in any government documents you know it's very amazing when we look at this
[2:16:56.020 --> 2:16:59.260]  you're talking about the cover-up the massive cover-up by the Mexican
[2:16:59.260 --> 2:17:03.420]  government of course there's been a massive silence by the American media
[2:17:03.420 --> 2:17:08.300]  we have this massive war right across the border as you point out you know
[2:17:08.300 --> 2:17:11.900]  hundred thousand people possibly killed we don't know the exact number because
[2:17:11.900 --> 2:17:16.620]  of the cover-up and yet we always have our attention focused on to the Middle
[2:17:16.620 --> 2:17:20.620]  East not on this imminent threat right at our borders this violence this
[2:17:20.620 --> 2:17:25.340]  corruption is flowing into our country now at an unprecedented rate and that
[2:17:25.340 --> 2:17:29.420]  is what we're going to be seeing in this country and so it's amazing to me that
[2:17:29.420 --> 2:17:34.020]  we don't hear much about it in the American media either there is a as you
[2:17:34.020 --> 2:17:36.820]  point out cover-up in the Mexican government but there's a conspiracy
[2:17:36.820 --> 2:17:39.500]  of silence here in the mainstream media in America as well aren't there isn't
[2:17:39.500 --> 2:17:46.220]  there sadly you know when you look at border reporting from journalists it
[2:17:46.220 --> 2:17:50.380]  mainly focuses on immigration and the plight of the immigrant but they haven't
[2:17:50.380 --> 2:17:54.380]  really focused on the cartels I did mention the Middle East very interestingly
[2:17:54.380 --> 2:18:01.220]  so some of the cartels like the Los Etas have been known to be one of the most
[2:18:01.220 --> 2:18:05.900]  sadistic brutal criminal groups out there and I'm talking about posting be
[2:18:05.900 --> 2:18:11.060]  heading videos yes yes but it is member individuals and that's right across our
[2:18:11.060 --> 2:18:16.380]  border and yet if you talk about the crime this organized crime that feeds on
[2:18:16.380 --> 2:18:20.860]  the drug war if you talk about that you're dismissed as being racist because
[2:18:20.860 --> 2:18:24.740]  you just have to focus on one side of it and again as a point out if the people
[2:18:24.740 --> 2:18:28.300]  who are fleeing here because they want a better life economic refugees coming
[2:18:28.300 --> 2:18:32.220]  into the country illegally they're still being followed by these criminal
[2:18:32.220 --> 2:18:40.460]  cartels if we don't have any control over our border sadly yes and and in
[2:18:40.460 --> 2:18:44.900]  reality the ones that actually control the border are the cartels we have had
[2:18:44.900 --> 2:18:49.060]  cases where people have actually crossed without permission from the cartel and
[2:18:49.060 --> 2:18:54.500]  they paid dire consequences they've been a kidnapped held for ransom the
[2:18:54.500 --> 2:18:58.940]  relatives that had to wire money from you know the relatives in places like
[2:18:58.940 --> 2:19:02.660]  New York and Florida have had to wire money to the cartel to secure their
[2:19:02.660 --> 2:19:07.820]  release while these big victims have been actually tortured for daring to
[2:19:07.820 --> 2:19:11.300]  cross the river or cross that fence without paying protection from the
[2:19:11.300 --> 2:19:15.420]  cartel wow that's amazing now as we look at sanctuary cities and I want we got
[2:19:15.420 --> 2:19:18.740]  to take a quick break here in just a moment but we come back I want to talk
[2:19:18.740 --> 2:19:21.620]  to you about the sanctuary cities because you know as soon as Donald Trump
[2:19:21.620 --> 2:19:26.780]  was elected we had amnesty groups in California saying they wanted to hide
[2:19:26.780 --> 2:19:31.540]  lists of gang members from Donald Trump because they did not want innocent
[2:19:31.540 --> 2:19:35.280]  people to be deported along with the gang members so we're seeing the state
[2:19:35.280 --> 2:19:40.860]  of Maryland in the face of all of this violence by MS-13 gangs and other drug
[2:19:40.860 --> 2:19:44.180]  cartels saying they not only want to have sanctuary cities but they want to
[2:19:44.180 --> 2:19:47.660]  be the first sanctuary state is their corruption is part of that we'll ask
[2:19:47.660 --> 2:20:00.140]  that question to Ildefonso Ortiz he's with Breitbart Texas we'll be right back

[2:24:17.620 --> 2:24:21.100]  talking to Ildefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart
[2:24:21.100 --> 2:24:25.460]  Texas he's been part of the cartel chronicles that were done there with
[2:24:25.460 --> 2:24:29.340]  Brandon Darby and somebody's name you might recognize Stephen K Bannon and
[2:24:29.340 --> 2:24:34.580]  he's been talking about our borders and of course we had today in the news Paul
[2:24:34.580 --> 2:24:39.380]  Ryan saying we're going to delay funding of the wall the president of the
[2:24:39.380 --> 2:24:42.980]  Border Patrol Union is very upset about that he said we need to get control of
[2:24:42.980 --> 2:24:47.260]  borders of course Paul Ryan has always been a quote-unquote open borders guy
[2:24:47.260 --> 2:24:52.220]  but as our guest mr. Ortiz pointed out the borders aren't really open the
[2:24:52.220 --> 2:24:56.540]  borders are controlled but not by the US government they're controlled by the
[2:24:56.540 --> 2:25:01.940]  drug cartels they decide who will come in who can cross the border from Mexico
[2:25:01.940 --> 2:25:07.460]  and if you cross without paying them there is a massive penalty that they
[2:25:07.460 --> 2:25:11.540]  will extract from you I want to ask you mr. Ortiz is somebody who has studied
[2:25:11.540 --> 2:25:16.820]  this for a while and of course you said that in your opinion MS-13 is kind of a
[2:25:16.820 --> 2:25:21.540]  gun for hire for the bigger fish and now we see that our administration focusing
[2:25:21.540 --> 2:25:25.220]  on them what do you think needs to be done as somebody who has studied this
[2:25:25.220 --> 2:25:29.100]  for some time what is the strategy that we should pursue given the fact that
[2:25:29.100 --> 2:25:33.300]  there's so much corruption and connection of these drug cartels into the
[2:25:33.300 --> 2:25:37.340]  Mexican government that they do in fact control our borders what do you think
[2:25:37.340 --> 2:25:42.620]  needs to be done well basically declare some of the most violent cartels as
[2:25:42.620 --> 2:25:46.980]  criminal organized I mean as terrorist organizations designated
[2:25:46.980 --> 2:25:52.020]  designate them as terrorist groups and address them as such our government
[2:25:52.020 --> 2:25:56.040]  needs to stop being afraid of offending the Mexican government and the Mexican
[2:25:56.040 --> 2:25:59.340]  elite who are the actually the ones that are protecting these cartels and
[2:25:59.340 --> 2:26:05.520]  basically take them to task start freezing assets start targeting these
[2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:09.620]  cartels as terrorist groups the same way you would target ISIS so you would say
[2:26:09.620 --> 2:26:14.300]  then that the move by Attorney General Sessions to say that MS-13 is a terrorist
[2:26:14.300 --> 2:26:18.700]  group as organized crime whatever to label them as such that would be a good
[2:26:18.700 --> 2:26:22.100]  start you would probably add then I guess some of the other drug cartel
[2:26:22.100 --> 2:26:27.980]  organizations like the Zetas and others right absolutely basically you guys are
[2:26:27.980 --> 2:26:33.420]  he's targeting the lower wrong step it up go to the higher the higher level
[2:26:33.420 --> 2:26:38.580]  start targeting for example the Los Zetas cartel the golf cartel the Juarez
[2:26:38.580 --> 2:26:41.820]  cartel I mean particularly the Juarez cartel has been linked to President
[2:26:41.820 --> 2:26:47.700]  Peña Nieto the current Mexican president has we've reported on how he
[2:26:47.700 --> 2:26:53.500]  received money from cartel members during his 2012 presidential campaign so
[2:26:53.500 --> 2:26:57.300]  these are the people that you need to start targeting as terrorist
[2:26:57.300 --> 2:27:02.860]  organizations I mean they have political power they have they cause mass terror
[2:27:02.860 --> 2:27:09.220]  with their tactics and pretty much if you look at the definition of terrorist
[2:27:09.220 --> 2:27:13.380]  groups you can label each one of those as a Mexican cartel you know it's
[2:27:13.380 --> 2:27:17.980]  interesting I remember the movie cartel land I thought was very interesting the
[2:27:17.980 --> 2:27:21.980]  Mexican doctor who was involved in that what it reminded me of was the movie The
[2:27:21.980 --> 2:27:27.460]  Magnificent Seven where the villagers are at the mercy of both of the the
[2:27:27.460 --> 2:27:31.060]  criminals of Anditos and the federales who were coming through there and it
[2:27:31.060 --> 2:27:35.820]  struck me is how much the current situation was like that movie that set
[2:27:35.820 --> 2:27:41.060]  100 years ago that kind of corruption and of course it was a situation at the
[2:27:41.060 --> 2:27:45.020]  grassroots level it appeared from the movie at least that the people were
[2:27:45.020 --> 2:27:48.460]  trying to get together take responsibility for their own security
[2:27:48.460 --> 2:27:51.540]  which was the central part of the magnificence of what do you think about
[2:27:51.540 --> 2:27:55.260]  that situation I know that's one particular individual but are there
[2:27:55.260 --> 2:27:59.780]  other vigilante groups that are trying to move against a corrupt government that
[2:27:59.780 --> 2:28:04.260]  is an alliance with the corrupt drug cartels well they've tried but the
[2:28:04.260 --> 2:28:09.540]  Mexican government has been very efficient in shutting them down basically
[2:28:09.540 --> 2:28:15.540]  the Mexican government is more afraid of citizens racing up in arms that they
[2:28:15.540 --> 2:28:18.940]  are of Mexican cartels because the cartels are not gonna take over a power
[2:28:18.940 --> 2:28:24.340]  they just want to move drugs and continue terrorizing people continue with
[2:28:24.340 --> 2:28:28.580]  their human trafficking and all those other horrors that target the average
[2:28:28.580 --> 2:28:32.580]  citizen but they don't mess with the political elite you know one of the
[2:28:32.580 --> 2:28:36.220]  things to where we're talking about the sanctuary cities and as soon as we talk
[2:28:36.220 --> 2:28:41.620]  about violence that comes with the drug cartels we're labeled as racist and so
[2:28:41.620 --> 2:28:45.820]  we have all these sanctuary cities as Marilyn wants to make itself the first
[2:28:45.820 --> 2:28:49.060]  sanctuary state do you think that they're already starting to make their move
[2:28:49.060 --> 2:28:54.380]  into buying politicians up in the United States as they have done in Mexico is
[2:28:54.380 --> 2:28:59.860]  that part of the sanctuary city movement I wouldn't necessarily say that what I'm
[2:28:59.860 --> 2:29:05.740]  seeing more is that basically they're writing that emotional wave politicians
[2:29:05.740 --> 2:29:09.340]  want to basically try to say oh we're trying to be helpful in everything of
[2:29:09.340 --> 2:29:14.060]  that nature the problem though is that for example you mentioned that they
[2:29:14.060 --> 2:29:17.580]  don't want to they want to remove the names of gang members from those lists
[2:29:17.580 --> 2:29:22.340]  and all that the problem is that people don't realize is that when a cartel wants
[2:29:22.340 --> 2:29:26.940]  to kill somebody kidnap somebody or torture somebody in the US they're not
[2:29:26.940 --> 2:29:30.620]  gonna send gunmen across the border to do it well they can but they usually what
[2:29:30.620 --> 2:29:36.180]  they'll do is they'll hire out low gangs in the US that already here to carry
[2:29:36.180 --> 2:29:39.940]  out saying in Long Island and in Maryland yes exactly we're out of time

[2:33:23.380 --> 2:33:27.580]  and we're gonna be talking in this segment to a man who specializes in
[2:33:27.580 --> 2:33:30.940]  First Amendment and internet law why we're going to be talking to him because
[2:33:30.940 --> 2:33:39.180]  we've been sued by George Soros's law firm for reporting as AP says statements
[2:33:39.180 --> 2:33:43.500]  that other people have published we can't talk about what other
[2:33:43.500 --> 2:33:47.660]  people have published and of course we stand by the facts that are in this case
[2:33:47.660 --> 2:33:50.540]  and we're going to talk to him about the issues there but of course that reminds
[2:33:50.540 --> 2:33:56.660]  us all that we are funded by your contributions in terms of products that
[2:33:56.660 --> 2:33:59.820]  you buy we offer the best products that we can find things that will help you
[2:33:59.820 --> 2:34:02.940]  with your health things that will fund our operation because they make it
[2:34:02.940 --> 2:34:07.340]  increasingly difficult for us to advertise YouTube has made it impossible
[2:34:07.340 --> 2:34:11.700]  for us to take something like caveman for example and to serve our ads we have
[2:34:11.700 --> 2:34:18.820]  a dedicated site info wars store.com that it sells nothing but supplements but
[2:34:18.820 --> 2:34:23.820]  they say because we have a political site info wars.com oh no we are not
[2:34:23.820 --> 2:34:29.220]  going to accept your ads from your health supplements so we can't serve an ad
[2:34:29.220 --> 2:34:34.980]  that shows caveman on somebody else's site and of course they're blocking us
[2:34:34.980 --> 2:34:39.700]  from accepting other ads even on YouTube we're seeing them demonetized videos not
[2:34:39.700 --> 2:34:43.180]  just for us but for everybody because they say well we think the content is
[2:34:43.180 --> 2:34:47.100]  too controversial so we see this kind of censorship going on everywhere so we
[2:34:47.100 --> 2:34:51.460]  have the model where we come up with the very best products we can for nutrition

[2:36:51.700 --> 2:36:56.660]  journalist as well so that's his connection with both legal issues and
[2:36:56.660 --> 2:37:01.220]  with free speech issues thank you for joining us Mr. Rondaza. It's my pleasure.
[2:37:01.220 --> 2:37:07.260]  Now I'm sure you're aware of this lawsuit that hit the news yesterday hit the
[2:37:07.260 --> 2:37:13.660]  court yesterday I am your comments on what you see here well you know when you
[2:37:13.660 --> 2:37:18.620]  have a case like this against a member of the media you know my my initial
[2:37:18.620 --> 2:37:22.860]  reaction is usually to be hostile towards the plaintiff side of it but I've
[2:37:22.860 --> 2:37:28.580]  certainly supported some defamation cases in the past you know I think most
[2:37:28.580 --> 2:37:33.580]  recently the case that Melania Trump brought against the daily mail for saying
[2:37:33.580 --> 2:37:37.660]  that she was a prostitute the more I looked at that the more I said that had
[2:37:37.660 --> 2:37:42.780]  some legs and and I've publicly said so much to the chagrin of my First
[2:37:42.780 --> 2:37:47.700]  Amendment absolutist brothers and sisters now looking at this one what's
[2:37:47.700 --> 2:37:51.540]  important you know what the what the court's gonna have to look at is whether
[2:37:51.540 --> 2:37:57.580]  or not the actual malice standard has been met and they have alleged that in
[2:37:57.580 --> 2:38:04.900]  paragraph 26 of this complaint that that standard is what applies to a public
[2:38:04.900 --> 2:38:09.580]  figure plaintiff in a defamation case now the unfortunate thing about that is
[2:38:09.580 --> 2:38:13.020]  it's called the actual malice standard so people who don't know what they're
[2:38:13.020 --> 2:38:18.540]  talking about will interpret that as meaning it was malicious you get to be
[2:38:18.540 --> 2:38:22.460]  malicious there there is no requirement under the First Amendment that you be
[2:38:22.460 --> 2:38:28.660]  polite that you be tactful that you be nice there may be moral reasons to do
[2:38:28.660 --> 2:38:33.860]  those things but no legal reasons to do them so what's actual malice mean it
[2:38:33.860 --> 2:38:40.460]  means knowing falsity or a reckless disregard for the truth now finding
[2:38:40.460 --> 2:38:44.900]  somebody who says that they knew it was false at the time that they said it I'm
[2:38:44.900 --> 2:38:50.820]  just just assuming arguing arguing though that that was the case here unless
[2:38:50.820 --> 2:38:55.300]  you get somebody in a you know it with sodium pentothal in their neck to get
[2:38:55.300 --> 2:38:58.060]  them to agree that they knew it was false when they did it you don't usually
[2:38:58.060 --> 2:39:04.140]  prove that so you have to prove this reckless disregard stamp so let's just
[2:39:04.140 --> 2:39:08.500]  say for a moment just for the sake of discussing this that these statements
[2:39:08.500 --> 2:39:15.420]  were indeed false there's still not gonna sustain a defamation claim unless
[2:39:15.420 --> 2:39:20.300]  they were knowingly false or there was a reckless disregard for the truth now
[2:39:20.300 --> 2:39:24.860]  when I look at these statements you know to be perfectly honest I would I have
[2:39:24.860 --> 2:39:30.340]  said them I may not have I don't you'd ask me beforehand should I should I
[2:39:30.340 --> 2:39:33.860]  put should I print this not as a legal matter but I would have said well you
[2:39:33.860 --> 2:39:37.380]  know maybe I don't support that but that's not that's not what what's
[2:39:37.380 --> 2:39:42.060]  important what's important is does the First Amendment allow you to so while I
[2:39:42.060 --> 2:39:45.700]  might not endorse the statements I endorse your right to make them as long
[2:39:45.700 --> 2:39:50.260]  as they were within the bounds of New York Times versus Sullivan now of course
[2:39:50.260 --> 2:39:54.820]  that's the First Amendment you know I may disagree but as Voltaire said I'll
[2:39:54.820 --> 2:39:59.220]  defend your right to say it so that's not the issue as to whether or not they
[2:39:59.220 --> 2:40:04.420]  agree and clearly we disagree with Ulacaya on the immigrant issue he tweet
[2:40:04.420 --> 2:40:08.780]  out that he's collaborating with George Soros on refugees we disagree with that
[2:40:08.780 --> 2:40:13.220]  policy we disagree with the idea that the government should subsidize people
[2:40:13.220 --> 2:40:16.700]  getting into a business that they should subsidize their factories that they
[2:40:16.700 --> 2:40:21.620]  should subsidize their labor and we were concerned about the fact that CBS was
[2:40:21.620 --> 2:40:25.380]  essentially doing a puff PR piece on him so those are the issues that we were
[2:40:25.380 --> 2:40:29.540]  talking about with this right and that's you know and that's where you know I
[2:40:29.540 --> 2:40:34.620]  may not you and I may not see eye-to-eye on that politically but we can see eye
[2:40:34.620 --> 2:40:39.140]  to eye on the right to have wide open and robust debate about these things I
[2:40:39.140 --> 2:40:44.940]  I welcome you challenging these things that I actually happen to support I
[2:40:44.940 --> 2:40:48.820]  think that we can all be grown-ups and we can all argue about it and at the end
[2:40:48.820 --> 2:40:54.060]  the marketplace of ideas will determine which one of those views is going to be
[2:40:54.060 --> 2:40:59.180]  adopted by the majority so you know anytime I hear something that someone
[2:40:59.180 --> 2:41:04.260]  on the you know is expressing like you did here I mean I happen to like
[2:41:04.260 --> 2:41:09.260]  immigration I happen to like this SBA loans these are things that you and I
[2:41:09.260 --> 2:41:13.380]  are not going to see eye-to-eye on but I love that you're here challenging my
[2:41:13.380 --> 2:41:17.580]  views I love that you're here putting your views out into the marketplace and
[2:41:17.580 --> 2:41:21.940]  you know the day may come when I have to surrender my ground and say well the
[2:41:21.940 --> 2:41:27.020]  the marketplace has discussed it and and your views of one out and I guess that
[2:41:27.020 --> 2:41:30.860]  all plays into what we see happening in Berkeley right now the fact that they
[2:41:30.860 --> 2:41:34.900]  would go in and say at the birthplace of the free speech movement in the 1960s
[2:41:34.900 --> 2:41:37.900]  oh we don't want to hear your speech anymore because we we know that we
[2:41:37.900 --> 2:41:40.860]  disagree with you so we're just going to shout you down we've had situation
[2:41:40.860 --> 2:41:46.340]  where we've shown up at a protest at an abortion clinic with signs about abortion
[2:41:46.340 --> 2:41:50.340]  they came out they didn't have their own signs to they counter that they didn't
[2:41:50.340 --> 2:41:53.660]  want to debate it they came up with black signs to cover our signs I mean
[2:41:53.660 --> 2:41:57.180]  that's a physical example of we're just gonna shut down your speech and even
[2:41:57.180 --> 2:42:01.020]  Bernie Sanders came out said this is incredibly weak to say that you're not
[2:42:01.020 --> 2:42:04.060]  going to have an argument that you're not going to discuss this you're just
[2:42:04.060 --> 2:42:08.660]  going to shut speech down yeah I mean you know what I just wrote yesterday a
[2:42:08.660 --> 2:42:15.100]  column on CNN about this and I said that I felt like I woke up in an alternate
[2:42:15.100 --> 2:42:21.860]  reality when I saw that Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren and you know in other
[2:42:21.860 --> 2:42:28.660]  other icons of the left are out stumping for Ann Coulter and I love that yeah
[2:42:28.660 --> 2:42:32.660]  because that's what we should be if we're a nation of grown-ups who are
[2:42:32.660 --> 2:42:38.540]  I agree I deserve freedom of expression that's right you know nobody's words are
[2:42:38.540 --> 2:42:43.020]  so strong and none of my beliefs are so weak that they cannot stand in
[2:42:43.020 --> 2:42:47.700]  opposition to someone else's beliefs put all these ideas in the marketplace in
[2:42:47.700 --> 2:42:51.840]  the marketplace and let the free market in ideas decide I mean that's where I'm
[2:42:51.840 --> 2:42:56.500]  a complete free market guy when it comes to the free marketplace of ideas you
[2:42:56.500 --> 2:43:01.060]  know with Ann Coulter or you know Berkeley has sinned multiple times in
[2:43:01.060 --> 2:43:06.020]  this regard you know I think we saw when even during the election when people
[2:43:06.020 --> 2:43:11.140]  came out to support Donald Trump the candidate and people decided that they
[2:43:11.140 --> 2:43:16.420]  wanted to attack those supporters because it was equated with being racist
[2:43:16.420 --> 2:43:22.420]  bigoted xenophobic all these things that you know I apologize but the left painted
[2:43:22.420 --> 2:43:27.420]  Trump supporters at and I apologize as a member of the left because I think that
[2:43:27.420 --> 2:43:32.220]  was incredibly childish and incredibly destructive by my side of the political
[2:43:32.220 --> 2:43:36.420]  divide but when they did that it incited violence against people not
[2:43:36.420 --> 2:43:42.060]  directly not actionably but I saw these three four or five Trump supporters
[2:43:42.060 --> 2:43:46.620]  running down the street being pursued by a crowd of people acting like animals
[2:43:46.620 --> 2:43:51.860]  and the police just watching you know and it turns out now that you know I got
[2:43:51.860 --> 2:43:56.100]  to ask whether or not that was a command from on high or did the police just
[2:43:56.100 --> 2:44:01.300]  decide you know in a country where I think we have overly aggressive policing
[2:44:01.300 --> 2:44:05.580]  the police just decided that that would be the one day they'd take off and just
[2:44:05.580 --> 2:44:10.780]  sit do nothing well you know it's also interesting in Chicago when Trump had
[2:44:10.780 --> 2:44:13.900]  that rally there remember that was one of the first times that we had violence
[2:44:13.900 --> 2:44:19.380]  at a Trump rally and the response from people were how dare him come to the
[2:44:19.380 --> 2:44:24.340]  University of Chicago he knows that this is our place we're leftists and we
[2:44:24.340 --> 2:44:28.900]  don't want to hear any of this stuff and it's like so that justifies violence to
[2:44:28.900 --> 2:44:33.260]  censor his speech there it is the University of Chicago it should be a
[2:44:33.260 --> 2:44:38.260]  marketplace of ideas open to discussion and debate you know the the most
[2:44:38.260 --> 2:44:43.620]  hateful speech I ever saw the the thing that I felt was closest to a
[2:44:43.620 --> 2:44:49.660]  Nuremberg rally that I ever witnessed was a long time ago at the University of
[2:44:49.660 --> 2:44:54.580]  Massachusetts and they brought in a guy by the name of Leonard Jeffries he is a
[2:44:54.580 --> 2:44:59.140]  professor I believe at the City University of New York I don't want to
[2:44:59.140 --> 2:45:04.740]  defame the University by making that wrong but this guy came and spoke about
[2:45:04.740 --> 2:45:12.780]  how Jews were trash Arabs were trash Europeans were trash and that you know
[2:45:12.780 --> 2:45:17.460]  that everybody in the world was in a conspiracy against black people and and
[2:45:17.460 --> 2:45:22.820]  they were just filth I mean I've and then I saw these people around cheering him
[2:45:22.820 --> 2:45:28.540]  and I thought this might be what it was like to be at a Nuremberg rally and I
[2:45:28.540 --> 2:45:33.860]  hated what this guy had to say I despise the man to this day for for sitting
[2:45:33.860 --> 2:45:39.900]  through that that's the guy right there you know but that to me was the most
[2:45:39.900 --> 2:45:45.060]  educational experience or maybe not the most but one of the most educational
[2:45:45.060 --> 2:45:49.540]  experiences of my life I grew greatly through it I was delighted to be there
[2:45:49.540 --> 2:45:54.420]  you know you can learn from people that you don't agree with you know if you
[2:45:54.420 --> 2:45:57.780]  just want to listen to people you agree with well that's the unfortunate
[2:45:57.780 --> 2:46:01.820]  situation we have in America today is you know someone will say turn that Fox
[2:46:01.820 --> 2:46:05.700]  news off because I don't want to hear that propaganda or turn off info wars or
[2:46:05.700 --> 2:46:10.500]  frankly have had people say how can you go on info wars and I said well why
[2:46:10.500 --> 2:46:15.500]  wouldn't I I think the audience is probably well you know I hope the
[2:46:15.500 --> 2:46:19.100]  audience can see that there's at least one guy sitting here on the left who
[2:46:19.100 --> 2:46:24.060]  believes in freedom of expression over believing in his own tribe and and that's
[2:46:24.060 --> 2:46:28.340]  what I think we need more than anything more than immigration reform more than
[2:46:28.340 --> 2:46:32.700]  you know more than military more than anything we need to go back to the core
[2:46:32.700 --> 2:46:39.980]  of what is this country about I agree to exist and we had Chuck Schumer Senator
[2:46:39.980 --> 2:46:44.500]  Schumer go on the Morning Joe show yesterday and say look this country was
[2:46:44.500 --> 2:46:49.660]  based on facts but we are going to lose our democracy if people give the same
[2:46:49.660 --> 2:46:53.340]  amount of credibility to Breitbart as they do to the New York Times and so
[2:46:53.340 --> 2:46:58.340]  instead of looking at facts instead of debating a particular point of view or
[2:46:58.340 --> 2:47:04.060]  an article deconstructing an article analyzing an article or a report instead
[2:47:04.060 --> 2:47:07.780]  he says yeah everything that Breitbart says is false everything the New York
[2:47:07.780 --> 2:47:12.860]  Times says is true it's that kind of polarization that kind of tribalism
[2:47:12.860 --> 2:47:16.140]  between the left and right that is really going to destroy us I was really
[2:47:16.140 --> 2:47:21.420]  we've talked about this many times you cannot just always dismiss a particular
[2:47:21.420 --> 2:47:24.940]  source you need to take a look at what they're saying typically what we'll do
[2:47:24.940 --> 2:47:28.740]  is we'll analyze the New York Times and we'll say look here's factually what
[2:47:28.740 --> 2:47:31.800]  they're saying other people are saying this but look at where they're
[2:47:31.800 --> 2:47:35.420]  interjecting their opinion do you agree with their opinion do you agree with this
[2:47:35.420 --> 2:47:39.660]  analysis so we report facts we analyze that people may not agree with our
[2:47:39.660 --> 2:47:43.020]  analysis they may not agree with the New York Times analysis or Breitbart's
[2:47:43.020 --> 2:47:47.100]  analysis but nevertheless we have these different sources of information back in
[2:47:47.100 --> 2:47:51.420]  the day when there were magazines I would go to the extreme left of opinion
[2:47:51.420 --> 2:47:54.300]  journals I'll go to the nation I would go to the extreme right the National
[2:47:54.300 --> 2:47:57.260]  Review I would look at what they were saying about a particular issue because
[2:47:57.260 --> 2:48:01.300]  they were honest about the fact that they had opinions that they were
[2:48:01.300 --> 2:48:06.940]  analyzing things I wanted that rather than to go to somebody that pretended to
[2:48:06.940 --> 2:48:11.380]  be totally objective non-biased like Time and Newsweek and said we don't have
[2:48:11.380 --> 2:48:15.300]  any opinions you have an opinion the stories that you report show your
[2:48:15.300 --> 2:48:19.700]  opinion the stories that you choose to talk about show your bias of course and
[2:48:19.700 --> 2:48:23.860]  the way you frame it I mean there's I spent years as a journalist I've got
[2:48:23.860 --> 2:48:28.940]  two degrees in journalism I know very well that you don't need to even
[2:48:28.940 --> 2:48:33.020]  interject your opinion into a piece in order to frame it in an opinionated way
[2:48:33.020 --> 2:48:38.060]  that's right now but you know it's not just important to look at multiple
[2:48:38.060 --> 2:48:43.460]  sources to consider one version of the facts or the other but actually read on
[2:48:43.460 --> 2:48:48.620]  the lines and listen to the opinion I mean I want to know what people I
[2:48:48.620 --> 2:48:53.540]  disagree with think because I want to know how to frame my arguments against
[2:48:53.540 --> 2:48:58.700]  them but I also want to be open-minded I mean I have found myself at times
[2:48:58.700 --> 2:49:05.140]  persuaded to change sides on an opinion or even to at least soften my view on
[2:49:05.140 --> 2:49:12.420]  something and you know you got to listen when I have I've so many polarized
[2:49:12.420 --> 2:49:17.340]  people I deal with and and it seems like people are much more calcified in their
[2:49:17.340 --> 2:49:22.140]  opinions on the left where there's just no possible way you could have for
[2:49:22.140 --> 2:49:26.060]  example voted for Donald Trump unless you're a xenophobic racist isolation is
[2:49:26.060 --> 2:49:30.900]  bigot whatever name every horrible thing you can imagine and I say you know that
[2:49:30.900 --> 2:49:34.980]  just isn't the case and I know that because I've listened to these people
[2:49:34.980 --> 2:49:38.900]  you know I've listened and I said well there's a diversity of reasons that
[2:49:38.900 --> 2:49:43.580]  people vote for one candidate or another you know I myself happen to have
[2:49:43.580 --> 2:49:50.060]  voted for Barack Obama one time not the second time yeah you can't paint me as
[2:49:50.060 --> 2:49:54.260]  believing in every single thing the guy believed in and I don't think you should
[2:49:54.260 --> 2:49:57.980]  be able to do that with any candidate but the only way you can actually do
[2:49:57.980 --> 2:50:02.460]  that with a straight face is if you refuse to listen each side of the
[2:50:02.460 --> 2:50:05.940]  political spectrum has something to teach us each opinion is something to
[2:50:05.940 --> 2:50:11.220]  teach us if only that it teaches you that you still believe in your views
[2:50:11.220 --> 2:50:16.260]  I mean I go through an exercise every day I try to do this on a constant basis but
[2:50:16.260 --> 2:50:20.460]  think of something that I really really believe in and I challenge it I spent this
[2:50:20.460 --> 2:50:26.180]  time talking to myself arguing against a view that I firmly firmly believe in
[2:50:26.180 --> 2:50:31.380]  because I need to have that exercise in my head and if one person can do that
[2:50:31.380 --> 2:50:37.020]  then certainly a nation of 300 million people can do that collectively I agree
[2:50:37.020 --> 2:50:41.380]  with you absolutely and we're going to talk to Mark Jay Rondaza when we come
[2:50:41.380 --> 2:50:45.260]  back and I want to get your opinion when we come back see if you think that this
[2:50:45.260 --> 2:50:48.980]  lawsuit has any merit you had a chance to take a look at the lawsuit you've
[2:50:48.980 --> 2:50:52.900]  looked at the report that we filed and I want to get your specific comments on
[2:50:52.900 --> 2:50:56.060]  that we've been talking in general about the First Amendment of course Mr.
[2:50:56.060 --> 2:51:00.540]  Rondaza specializes in that he's been both a journalist and is now a loyal be
[2:51:00.540 --> 2:51:04.300]  right back certain times it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to
[2:51:04.300 --> 2:51:08.260]  cook food and boil water if your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove
[2:51:08.260 --> 2:51:11.980]  or cooking over an open fire then there's a much better way the Minuteman

[2:51:15.900 --> 2:51:19.620]  quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel the Minuteman stove is easy to use

[2:55:47.140 --> 2:55:52.500]  speech your comments on this specific lawsuit. Well you know looking at the
[2:55:52.500 --> 2:55:58.740]  complaint I don't think it is very it was very well done you know and there are
[2:55:58.740 --> 2:56:06.180]  some defences that that I think you would have that are probably not the most
[2:56:06.180 --> 2:56:10.620]  flattering to you but nevertheless the question here is how do I look at the
[2:56:10.620 --> 2:56:14.780]  lawsuit you know if you look at paragraph eight of the lawsuit it says
[2:56:14.780 --> 2:56:19.460]  that the defendants are no strange stranger to spurious statements they
[2:56:19.460 --> 2:56:24.340]  put in a couple of conspiracy theories that that mr. Jones has put forth like
[2:56:24.340 --> 2:56:28.460]  the US government orchestrated the 9-11 attacks and the mass shooting at Sandy
[2:56:28.460 --> 2:56:33.460]  Hook you know I I happen of not agree with those I think they're they're
[2:56:33.460 --> 2:56:37.220]  silly statements. They're not germane to this lawsuit at all though are they?
[2:56:37.220 --> 2:56:43.380]  Well they are actually because whether or not something is defamatory it matters
[2:56:43.380 --> 2:56:49.060]  how the audience is going to view it so if the if you're going to say well you
[2:56:49.060 --> 2:56:53.700]  know there's all these kind of crackpot theories I mean they're they're painting
[2:56:53.700 --> 2:56:59.100]  them as crackpot theory and they say this guy made these crackpot statements now
[2:56:59.100 --> 2:57:03.260]  made this statement about us well you know somebody stands on the side of the
[2:57:03.260 --> 2:57:06.540]  road and has a sign that says you know the world's gonna end tomorrow they're
[2:57:06.540 --> 2:57:10.540]  wearing a tin foil hat and they say that you know Tyrannosaurus Rexes are going
[2:57:10.540 --> 2:57:15.580]  to descend from alien spacecraft and eat us all and then they also say oh and by
[2:57:15.580 --> 2:57:20.020]  the way I know that you're an adulterer well I'm not gonna have much of a
[2:57:20.020 --> 2:57:23.180]  defamation suit against them because they're not considered credible so at
[2:57:23.180 --> 2:57:26.860]  first they say you're not credible but then they say people are going to look
[2:57:26.860 --> 2:57:32.540]  at this and take it credibly their own pleadings you know I really would not
[2:57:32.540 --> 2:57:38.180]  give this complaint a good grade because that paragraph alone I think while it
[2:57:38.180 --> 2:57:44.940]  may be insulting to info wars also helps in their defense then they quote the
[2:57:44.940 --> 2:57:49.340]  Southern Poverty Law Center which despite my political beliefs I happen to
[2:57:49.340 --> 2:57:54.660]  think is is probably more guilty of defamation than any other organization
[2:57:54.660 --> 2:57:59.980]  that it might look at but they say Mr. Jones is almost certainly the most
[2:57:59.980 --> 2:58:04.060]  prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary America well right there he
[2:58:04.060 --> 2:58:08.860]  got some he got like an inoculation against this case so that paragraph alone
[2:58:08.860 --> 2:58:14.100]  whoever wrote that I think should maybe have taken a remedial class in
[2:58:14.100 --> 2:58:19.860]  defamation law interesting analysis we'll have to see how this works out but
[2:58:19.860 --> 2:58:22.900]  thank you so much for joining us and I appreciate your stance on the First
[2:58:22.900 --> 2:58:26.180]  Amendment I think that's something that the right and the left needs to come
[2:58:26.180 --> 2:58:30.020]  together to say that we have a right to discuss things and we have a right to
[2:58:30.020 --> 2:58:34.820]  investigate stories and people can label us as conspiracy theorists but we're not
[2:58:34.820 --> 2:58:38.420]  going to take anything that anybody says without examining this thank you so
[2:58:38.420 --> 2:58:43.740]  much and you can find Mr. Rindhasa at Rindhasa.com

[2:59:57.380 --> 3:00:23.260]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight in the next segment we're
[3:00:23.260 --> 3:00:26.900]  gonna be joined by Paul Joseph Watson actually he's gonna take the show for the
[3:00:26.900 --> 3:00:30.860]  fourth hour I just want to finish up with a couple of news items here we're
[3:00:30.860 --> 3:00:35.260]  just talking to Mr. Mendoza first amendment attorney about the lawsuit
[3:00:35.260 --> 3:00:39.820]  and I think it'll be very interesting to see how this goes I agree with Alex I
[3:00:39.820 --> 3:00:43.420]  think that we're in a very strong position and quite frankly they may try
[3:00:43.420 --> 3:00:47.060]  to discredit us by just calling us a conspiracy theorist we've heard that
[3:00:47.060 --> 3:00:52.740]  every time every time you question the government's official story they call
[3:00:52.740 --> 3:00:57.500]  you a conspiracy theorist they say that you are tinfoil hat conspiracy
[3:00:57.500 --> 3:01:00.900]  theorist of course they used to mock Alex for saying oh they're watching you
[3:01:00.900 --> 3:01:04.900]  through your computer monitors anybody laughing about that anymore they may be
[3:01:04.900 --> 3:01:08.780]  trying to ignore the fact that the government is in fact watching you
[3:01:08.780 --> 3:01:13.540]  everything that you do with your computer that corporations are watching
[3:01:13.540 --> 3:01:18.060]  and recording what you do that the government can get that information from
[3:01:18.060 --> 3:01:22.500]  you that they have blocked you from being able to sue these corporations who
[3:01:22.500 --> 3:01:25.700]  collect this information from turning it over to the government they say it's
[3:01:25.700 --> 3:01:28.860]  their information they can turn it over so we've seen all this happen we even
[3:01:28.860 --> 3:01:33.180]  see as they're now bragging about the fact to Facebook is out there saying
[3:01:33.180 --> 3:01:37.260]  hey we're going to read your thoughts so you don't have to use a keyboard anymore
[3:01:37.260 --> 3:01:42.980]  we're gonna read your mind so they put it in a positive way they say you're
[3:01:42.980 --> 3:01:46.820]  gonna be able to type with your mind well the other side of that is that
[3:01:46.820 --> 3:01:52.220]  they're going to be reading your mind and we are spending hundreds of millions
[3:01:52.220 --> 3:01:57.420]  of dollars in a visible research we don't know how much is being done in the
[3:01:57.420 --> 3:02:00.980]  dark secret projects that they've been working on for many years to do mind
[3:02:00.980 --> 3:02:06.220]  control this has been a pet project of our government for many many decades
[3:02:06.220 --> 3:02:10.820]  DARPA and they now call it the brain initiative funding it with hundreds of
[3:02:10.820 --> 3:02:15.140]  millions of dollars why they want to be able to remove memories to implant
[3:02:15.140 --> 3:02:19.580]  memories Facebook is saying we want to be able to read your mind so do we really
[3:02:19.580 --> 3:02:22.420]  need to have ten foil hats I mean certainly that's not going to help us
[3:02:22.420 --> 3:02:26.620]  from the programs but these programs are real when the government comes out
[3:02:26.620 --> 3:02:32.220]  with issues when the government gives us a story about a particular shooting or
[3:02:32.220 --> 3:02:36.780]  they give us a story about what happened in Syria this is a Trump
[3:02:36.780 --> 3:02:41.100]  administration I'm not going to buy this story simply because it's coming from
[3:02:41.100 --> 3:02:44.860]  Republicans or it's coming from Donald Trump or now the military industrial
[3:02:44.860 --> 3:02:48.820]  complex can be trusted without any investigation we're going to look at the
[3:02:48.820 --> 3:02:52.860]  motives that people had we're going to look at the opportunities we're going
[3:02:52.860 --> 3:02:56.540]  to investigate it we are not going to simply say well the government has said
[3:02:56.540 --> 3:03:02.620]  so so that's the way that it is or the New York Times has said it's this way or
[3:03:02.620 --> 3:03:05.660]  the Washington Post has said it's this way or Breitbart has said it's this way
[3:03:05.660 --> 3:03:10.380]  we're going to investigate we're going to debate what the government says if
[3:03:10.380 --> 3:03:15.500]  that makes us conspiracy theorists fine I say that it makes us conspiracy
[3:03:15.500 --> 3:03:20.900]  investigators because the government is constantly calling people conspirators
[3:03:20.900 --> 3:03:25.540]  saying that you plotted to do something illegally so you are conspiring to do
[3:03:25.540 --> 3:03:32.140]  something a good example of this is the Bundy trial we just had a mistrial for
[3:03:32.140 --> 3:03:35.100]  four defendants actually they had six people that were being tried they
[3:03:35.100 --> 3:03:39.620]  haven't gotten to the Bundy's per se yet but a jury in Las Vegas deadlocked on
[3:03:39.620 --> 3:03:44.540]  federal charges against four men in the armed standoff where I was present doing
[3:03:44.540 --> 3:03:49.380]  reporting the judge just declared a mistrial Monday after the jurors could
[3:03:49.380 --> 3:03:52.820]  not reach verdicts on four of the individuals earlier the same jury
[3:03:52.820 --> 3:03:58.220]  convicted two others in the standoff and they convicted these individuals were
[3:03:58.220 --> 3:04:00.940]  found guilty of eight charges one Burleson was found guilty of eight
[3:04:00.940 --> 3:04:06.300]  charges including threatening and assaulting a federal officer now the
[3:04:06.300 --> 3:04:11.620]  interesting thing is I was there and we were being threatened by the federal
[3:04:11.620 --> 3:04:16.020]  officers federal officers were threatening to shoot us they were
[3:04:16.020 --> 3:04:20.140]  pointing guns at us I didn't see anybody down the ground why was pointing guns
[3:04:20.140 --> 3:04:24.020]  back at them they found a picture of somebody on the bridge pointing a gun
[3:04:24.020 --> 3:04:29.060]  it's not clear who he was with or who he was pointing the gun at and I say it
[3:04:29.060 --> 3:04:32.940]  wasn't clear who he is with just because he wasn't in a uniform threatening to
[3:04:32.940 --> 3:04:36.860]  shoot us in the name of the government doesn't mean that he wasn't a government
[3:04:36.860 --> 3:04:41.980]  provocateur we saw that they put in film crews that pretended our people who
[3:04:41.980 --> 3:04:46.180]  were informants saying we're a film crew trying to get confessions out of people
[3:04:46.180 --> 3:04:49.460]  they said prosecutors say it's illegal to brandish the assault-style weapons
[3:04:49.460 --> 3:04:52.420]  against armed federal agents but it's not illegal for them to threaten to
[3:04:52.420 --> 3:04:57.020]  shoot us I don't think so but that makes me a conspiracy theorist stay with us
[3:04:57.020 --> 3:05:01.980]  Paul Joseph Watson will be taking the fourth hour Joe Biggs here with info
[3:05:01.980 --> 3:05:07.340]  wars.com with some patriotic quotes by Ron Paul the most basic principle to
[3:05:07.340 --> 3:05:12.300]  being a free American is the notion that we as individuals are responsible for
[3:05:12.300 --> 3:05:17.060]  our own lives and decisions we do not have the right to rob our neighbors to
[3:05:17.060 --> 3:05:21.300]  make up for our own mistakes neither does our neighbor have any right to tell
[3:05:21.300 --> 3:05:25.700]  us how to live so long as we aren't infringing on their rights freedom to
[3:05:25.700 --> 3:05:29.980]  make bad decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones if we were
[3:05:29.980 --> 3:05:34.580]  only free to make good decisions then we are not really free liberty is lost
[3:05:34.580 --> 3:05:39.380]  through complacency and a subservient mindset when we accept or even welcome
[3:05:39.380 --> 3:05:44.380]  automobile checkpoints random searches mandatory identification cards and
[3:05:44.380 --> 3:05:49.500]  paramilitary police in our streets we have lost a vital part of our American
[3:05:49.500 --> 3:05:54.780]  heritage America was born of protests revolution and mistrust of government
[3:05:54.780 --> 3:06:01.620]  subservient societies neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long this is
[3:06:01.620 --> 3:06:05.940]  Alex Jones I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the

[3:08:32.140 --> 3:08:37.740]  front a lot of anti-white racism going on now that's been made trendy in the
[3:08:37.740 --> 3:08:43.860]  media we have Jay Moisture putting out an ad that's completely offensive it's
[3:08:43.860 --> 3:08:47.780]  caused absolute outrage amongst everybody on the left you're gonna see in a
[3:08:47.780 --> 3:08:53.980]  minute how truly outrageous it really is we have Jose Antonio Vargas who you
[3:08:53.980 --> 3:08:58.340]  remember was behind the MTV white people show where white people basically got up
[3:08:58.340 --> 3:09:02.940]  and cried for their sin the sins of slavery hundreds of years ago which
[3:09:02.940 --> 3:09:07.220]  they had absolutely nothing to do with Oxford University is saying that
[3:09:07.220 --> 3:09:14.220]  avoiding eye contact is also racist the Bill Nye show says that white people who
[3:09:14.220 --> 3:09:18.700]  do yoga they're racist as well basically everything's racist at this point
[3:09:18.700 --> 3:09:23.420]  simply not looking somebody in the eye at a certain point can be characterized as
[3:09:23.420 --> 3:09:29.340]  a racial microaggression that's not out of some tumblr blog that's out of Oxford
[3:09:29.340 --> 3:09:34.220]  University one of if not the most prestigious learning institutions in
[3:09:34.220 --> 3:09:38.980]  the United Kingdom and indeed the world that's where it's coming from let's go
[3:09:38.980 --> 3:09:43.940]  to this Shay Moisture ad let's get it ready this was causing absolute
[3:09:43.940 --> 3:09:49.700]  tumultuous outrage across Twitter across social media yesterday Gateway Pundit
[3:09:49.700 --> 3:09:55.700]  reports we really effed this one up by putting white people in advertisement and
[3:09:55.700 --> 3:09:59.860]  just wait until you see the absolute horror contained in this commercial let's
[3:09:59.860 --> 3:10:04.540]  roll it people would like throw stuff in my hair and I just be walking in there
[3:10:04.540 --> 3:10:08.660]  be like little paper balls in my hair I hated it because it's like oh I have
[3:10:08.660 --> 3:10:14.140]  this and people make fun of me for it was lots of days staring in the mirror
[3:10:14.140 --> 3:10:17.740]  like I don't know what to do with it I just didn't feel like I was supposed to
[3:10:17.740 --> 3:10:21.660]  be a redhead I dyed my hair blonde for seven years of my life platinum blonde
[3:10:21.660 --> 3:10:25.540]  I didn't really embrace my natural hair but then you know as I got older I learned
[3:10:25.540 --> 3:10:30.220]  how to do it and I learned how to love it
[3:10:30.220 --> 3:10:34.540]  Shay Moisture holy grail right here it just gives us all the results that we
[3:10:34.540 --> 3:10:37.740]  need kind of that go-to product I think a good hair day is the best kind of day
[3:10:37.740 --> 3:10:42.220]  I feel like I have conquered the world I love my hair I love the volume I love
[3:10:42.220 --> 3:10:46.300]  the curl I love the texture I love everything about it everything about
[3:10:46.300 --> 3:10:53.820]  it everybody everybody everybody gets love so there you have it Shay Moisture
[3:10:53.820 --> 3:10:59.620]  having the temerity to include white people in an advertisement yeah that's
[3:10:59.620 --> 3:11:03.580]  it that's what people are outraged about they had white people in an
[3:11:03.580 --> 3:11:08.460]  advertisement they changed their product slightly to appeal to both black people
[3:11:08.460 --> 3:11:13.340]  and white people you can't do that that is outrageous that is racist they came
[3:11:13.340 --> 3:11:18.020]  out and profusely apologized ad falls flat under backlash it was kind of like
[3:11:18.020 --> 3:11:23.740]  the Pepsi ad from a few weeks back where they again had the temerity to go out
[3:11:23.740 --> 3:11:28.540]  and try and improve race relations in a commercial we can't have that we need
[3:11:28.540 --> 3:11:32.780]  constant division constant infighting constant race baiting now they put a
[3:11:32.780 --> 3:11:39.820]  white person in a video and people are going apoplectic they made a capitalist
[3:11:39.820 --> 3:11:44.300]  decision to change their product slightly and that's not acceptable we
[3:11:44.300 --> 3:11:48.540]  can't have that we can't have white people in commercials in America in
[3:11:48.540 --> 3:11:55.380]  2017 absolute disgrace rightly being pointed out by social justice warriors
[3:11:55.380 --> 3:12:00.300]  then we have Jose Antonio Vargas this clip is doing the rounds again I think
[3:12:00.300 --> 3:12:05.220]  it came out after the election but it got reposted on Twitter last night here's
[3:12:05.220 --> 3:12:10.340]  Jose Antonio Vargas who you will remember from the MTV white people show
[3:12:10.340 --> 3:12:14.340]  in which people white people were made to basically cry over their historical
[3:12:14.340 --> 3:12:20.500]  sins of slavery that guy the actual illegal immigrant here he is on
[3:12:20.500 --> 3:12:27.060]  democracy now talking about more race baiting let's go to that clip I think
[3:12:27.060 --> 3:12:31.700]  we are and have been since the election of Barack Obama in the middle of a civil
[3:12:31.700 --> 3:12:36.540]  war it's an internal civil war that is part civil war part reconstruction
[3:12:36.540 --> 3:12:41.460]  right demographically this country is no longer going to be white the state of
[3:12:41.460 --> 3:12:47.940]  California alone 51% of all Californians age 25 and under is Latino this
[3:12:47.940 --> 3:12:53.220]  country was only going to get gayer blacker browner more Asian women white
[3:12:53.220 --> 3:12:57.140]  women black women Muslim women will break all barriers there is to break what's
[3:12:57.140 --> 3:13:02.940]  left is this question of how much change can straight white men and white
[3:13:02.940 --> 3:13:08.980]  people handle I think last night we saw that it's not a lot that was Jose Antonio
[3:13:08.980 --> 3:13:12.820]  Vargas the literal illegal immigrant who makes programs for MTV in which white
[3:13:12.820 --> 3:13:18.180]  people cry over their white guilt now this is a guy who I had a spat with on
[3:13:18.180 --> 3:13:23.500]  Twitter on several occasions the most recent of which he said that I suggested
[3:13:23.500 --> 3:13:27.540]  that I bought personal responsibility for the African-American slave trade
[3:13:27.540 --> 3:13:32.020]  despite the fact that I was born in the UK in the 1980s hundreds of years before
[3:13:32.020 --> 3:13:35.900]  that happened so I had a Twitter spat with him and again he's out on
[3:13:35.900 --> 3:13:40.820]  democracy now race baiting making this argument that white people have to atone
[3:13:40.820 --> 3:13:46.540]  for their historical sins again talking about white people becoming a minority
[3:13:46.540 --> 3:13:53.380]  in America in an almost encouraging tone something he's looking forward to of
[3:13:53.380 --> 3:13:56.980]  course we've seen all this narrative before it's been building and building
[3:13:56.980 --> 3:14:01.620]  the last acceptable form of racism is racism against white people that's
[3:14:01.620 --> 3:14:06.180]  trendy doesn't mean that racism against black people Hispanic people Asian
[3:14:06.180 --> 3:14:11.700]  people doesn't exist of course it does but to say it in public the last form of
[3:14:11.700 --> 3:14:16.020]  acceptable racism is against white people we see it in numerous articles that
[3:14:16.020 --> 3:14:20.580]  I'm going to cover today but again it's this historical myth that only white
[3:14:20.580 --> 3:14:26.100]  people were responsible for enslaving other people you had the Barbary slave
[3:14:26.100 --> 3:14:31.820]  trade in which both black people and white people were enslaved by Arabs this
[3:14:31.820 --> 3:14:37.100]  is a historical fact it lasted for far longer than the transatlantic slave
[3:14:37.100 --> 3:14:42.540]  trade it was far more brutal they literally used to castrate black people
[3:14:42.540 --> 3:14:47.340]  to stop them having children they had black eunuchs Barbary slave trade look
[3:14:47.340 --> 3:14:52.300]  it up they had white slaves but again we don't hear about that today do we we
[3:14:52.300 --> 3:14:56.580]  don't have white people saying that Muslims Arab people should give them
[3:14:56.580 --> 3:15:00.980]  reparations because again they're not guilty for the sins of their ancestors
[3:15:00.980 --> 3:15:06.180]  hundreds and hundreds of years ago 30 million people are still enslaved today
[3:15:06.180 --> 3:15:11.540]  none of them in white countries by the way that's more people enslaved than at
[3:15:11.540 --> 3:15:18.020]  any other time in human history and it's mostly in Africa and the Middle East not
[3:15:18.020 --> 3:15:23.780]  in white countries one million to 1.25 million white Christian Europeans were
[3:15:23.780 --> 3:15:29.780]  enslaved in North Africa the Barbary slave trade far more brutal far more
[3:15:29.780 --> 3:15:33.740]  longer lasting and of course it was white people who were the first to end
[3:15:33.740 --> 3:15:39.060]  slavery William Wilberforce again they signed the docket they signed the
[3:15:39.060 --> 3:15:44.220]  legislation in Parliament in the 1800s William Wilberforce the Crusader the
[3:15:44.220 --> 3:15:50.060]  anti-slavery Crusader white British you know hundreds of thousands of white
[3:15:50.060 --> 3:15:56.460]  Americans died in a civil war partly to end slavery yet they're still spinning
[3:15:56.460 --> 3:16:01.100]  this narrative that we should be collectively guilty for something that
[3:16:01.100 --> 3:16:04.660]  happened hundreds of years ago despite the fact that it happened to white
[3:16:04.660 --> 3:16:10.140]  people as well it happened to everyone every major power in world history had
[3:16:10.140 --> 3:16:15.980]  a system of enslavement and again it's still going on today 30 million people
[3:16:15.980 --> 3:16:22.980]  enslaved more than any other time in human history white British people led
[3:16:22.980 --> 3:16:27.780]  expeditions to conduct raids in some of these countries to free black slaves
[3:16:27.780 --> 3:16:35.580]  back in the 1800s basic history so no we shouldn't feel guilty about it yes it
[3:16:35.580 --> 3:16:39.820]  was a horrible thing but it happened to everyone in almost every major country
[3:16:39.820 --> 3:16:44.860]  on the planet and yet we're still being told that we have to feel guilty about
[3:16:44.860 --> 3:16:50.460]  it today and it all ties into this SJW narrative of the oppression Olympics
[3:16:50.460 --> 3:16:55.540]  where anyone of color rises to the top there's no equality this is a
[3:16:55.540 --> 3:17:00.860]  collectivist mindset to collectively blame everyone of a certain color for
[3:17:00.860 --> 3:17:06.940]  something that happened 300 years ago Oxford University this is out of
[3:17:06.940 --> 3:17:11.860]  national review says avoiding eye contact is racist according to Oxford
[3:17:11.860 --> 3:17:16.540]  University's equality and diversity unit not making eye contact and not speaking
[3:17:16.540 --> 3:17:22.060]  directly to people are examples of racism the Telegraph newspaper reports
[3:17:22.060 --> 3:17:26.460]  that Oxford has informed students that these things can be examples of racial
[3:17:26.460 --> 3:17:32.380]  microaggressions which can cause mental ill health they literally say that not
[3:17:32.380 --> 3:17:37.620]  looking at somebody directly in the eyes maybe racist it may cause them PTSD
[3:17:37.620 --> 3:17:42.580]  they're actually saying that now I mean you might just be an introvert and not
[3:17:42.580 --> 3:17:46.100]  naturally look people in the eye anyway no you're racist forget about it you're
[3:17:46.100 --> 3:17:50.980]  racist you have to atone for your racial microaggressions other examples of
[3:17:50.980 --> 3:17:55.020]  everyday racism listed on the guide included asking people where they were
[3:17:55.020 --> 3:18:01.300]  originally from and making jokes related to a person's accent so if somebody has
[3:18:01.300 --> 3:18:06.100]  an accent and they're obviously not from the United Kingdom or from America don't
[3:18:06.100 --> 3:18:10.360]  you dare ask them their home country even if you're trying to make casual
[3:18:10.360 --> 3:18:17.140]  polite conversation that's racist as well after all I'm pretty sure that no
[3:18:17.140 --> 3:18:20.340]  interviewer has ever said gee I really liked how much that one candidate kept
[3:18:20.340 --> 3:18:24.860]  staring at the floor while telling me why she was perfect for the job so they
[3:18:24.860 --> 3:18:29.620]  go on to explain why it's ridiculous in this article again that's just one of

[3:27:07.140 --> 3:27:14.220]  need to stop using Asian wallpaper ruined yoga with their Lulu lemon hands so
[3:27:14.220 --> 3:27:18.980]  it's more anti-white casual racism and you know you could say oh stop being
[3:27:18.980 --> 3:27:23.620]  triggered your big snowflake but it's only in one direction isn't it again the
[3:27:23.620 --> 3:27:28.580]  last acceptable form of casual racism is against white people bill nice new
[3:27:28.580 --> 3:27:33.500]  Netflix show featured its own dear white people sketch attacking white people
[3:27:33.500 --> 3:27:38.060]  for using Asian wallpaper and ruining yoga by getting their Lulu lemon hands
[3:27:38.060 --> 3:27:41.980]  on it as part of a comedy sketch for bill nice show bill nice saves the world
[3:27:41.980 --> 3:27:46.140]  one of his Indian writers lectured white people on the microaggressions they
[3:27:46.140 --> 3:27:51.660]  commit by using Buddha statues and Asian wallpaper for street cred to sell
[3:27:51.660 --> 3:27:57.140]  alternative medicine and it's kind of ironic that the people who do that hipsters
[3:27:57.140 --> 3:28:01.420]  who will then lecture me all day about being a racist now they're being called
[3:28:01.420 --> 3:28:08.020]  a racist for having Buddha statues and Lulu lemon hands if they do yoga so you
[3:28:08.020 --> 3:28:12.860]  can't do yoga that's racist you can't not look someone in the eye that's racist
[3:28:12.860 --> 3:28:18.780]  you can't have dreadlocks that's cultural appropriation that's racist lists
[3:28:18.780 --> 3:28:21.980]  getting quite long isn't it you can't have white people in shame moisture
[3:28:21.980 --> 3:28:26.780]  commercials that's racist that's a microaggression a lot of these behaviors
[3:28:26.780 --> 3:28:31.260]  are where basically the list is getting really short now isn't it with these
[3:28:31.260 --> 3:28:35.060]  racial microaggressions but Bill neither science guy who says that there are
[3:28:35.060 --> 3:28:39.020]  more than two genders that's not scientific now has guests on again
[3:28:39.020 --> 3:28:44.700]  playing into this cute see trendy anti-white racism that we see with the
[3:28:44.700 --> 3:28:50.100]  likes of MTV again Jose Antonio Vargas with his dear white people now saying
[3:28:50.100 --> 3:28:54.500]  that basically white people are gonna enter into a civil war once they become
[3:28:54.500 --> 3:29:00.060]  a minority Washington Times reports Trump's lawyer launches legal action
[3:29:00.060 --> 3:29:04.100]  against Buzzfeed for publishing completely fabricated dossier this was
[3:29:04.100 --> 3:29:09.460]  the famous Trump p-gate dossier which they published again without verifying
[3:29:09.460 --> 3:29:14.380]  it is complete boncombe complete fake news now the lawsuits are about to hit
[3:29:14.380 --> 3:29:21.420]  Buzzfeed in fact I just learned before I came on the show Wikipedia has a fake
[3:29:21.420 --> 3:29:25.100]  news list which has a bunch of websites that obviously put out deliberately
[3:29:25.100 --> 3:29:29.180]  fake news to make money guess which other website is on that fake news list
[3:29:29.180 --> 3:29:35.220]  info wars dot com so again they're beginning the censorship purge these
[3:29:35.220 --> 3:29:38.940]  lists are gonna be used by the likes of Facebook YouTube and Twitter to purge

[3:33:28.660 --> 3:33:33.660]  about fake news with Buzzfeed now having a lawsuit filed against them
[3:33:33.660 --> 3:33:37.220]  regarding the p-gate dossier which again they published with no verification
[3:33:37.220 --> 3:33:41.180]  whatsoever turned out to be complete bonkham now they get in the blowback
[3:33:41.180 --> 3:33:44.980]  as Washington Times reporting on it Trump's lawyer launches legal action
[3:33:44.980 --> 3:33:50.460]  against Buzzfeed publishing completely fabricated dossier Axios reports in a
[3:33:50.460 --> 3:33:55.420]  related story Google changes its algorithms combat fake news the tech
[3:33:55.420 --> 3:34:00.020]  giant which owns roughly 80% of the US search market and over 40% of the US
[3:34:00.020 --> 3:34:04.500]  digital ad market it's basically a monopoly at this point so that oh it's
[3:34:04.500 --> 3:34:09.500]  a private company argument doesn't wash says it's made updates to its
[3:34:09.500 --> 3:34:14.740]  algorithms to surface more authoritative content why it matters this is one of the
[3:34:14.740 --> 3:34:18.740]  biggest steps Google has taken to combat fake news since the election again
[3:34:18.740 --> 3:34:23.420]  they've done studies Stanford Stanford University did a huge study and found
[3:34:23.420 --> 3:34:28.980]  that quote fake news had no impact whatsoever on the US presidential election
[3:34:28.980 --> 3:34:33.300]  they never talk about that do they they never talk about that study because it
[3:34:33.300 --> 3:34:37.260]  doesn't fit into their narrative that this is a huge problem and that we need
[3:34:37.260 --> 3:34:42.020]  massive censorship to deal with it fake news had no effect they're trying it
[3:34:42.020 --> 3:34:46.300]  again in France I'm going to get on to that in a second but the article
[3:34:46.300 --> 3:34:50.420]  continues Google and Facebook the two largest platforms and media distributors
[3:34:50.420 --> 3:34:53.620]  have been under intense pressure for years we know that they've got the
[3:34:53.620 --> 3:34:58.180]  fines coming through in Germany took about 50 million euro fine if Facebook
[3:34:58.180 --> 3:35:03.380]  doesn't remove fake news within a week well now they've made new changes to
[3:35:03.380 --> 3:35:08.300]  their algorithm and you start reading it sounds reasonable Google says it's
[3:35:08.300 --> 3:35:12.420]  adjusting the hundreds of signals used to elevate searches in its queries to
[3:35:12.420 --> 3:35:18.660]  help surface more authoritative pages and bury low quality content remember we
[3:35:18.660 --> 3:35:23.100]  had the story last week about Google contractors burying info was as low
[3:35:23.100 --> 3:35:26.540]  quality quality content they had to reverse that they had to basically
[3:35:26.540 --> 3:35:31.100]  apologize say they're not going to do that well they are going to do it but
[3:35:31.100 --> 3:35:34.420]  they're going to bury content for example that denies the Holocaust
[3:35:34.420 --> 3:35:39.460]  existence you say what what's wrong with that problem is that's not all we had
[3:35:39.460 --> 3:35:43.220]  an article a couple of months ago and you can flash this up Google to target
[3:35:43.220 --> 3:35:48.460]  criticism of Islam in new censorship purge and one of the examples they gave
[3:35:48.460 --> 3:35:54.700]  that was low quality content is also quote offensive content what's offensive
[3:35:54.700 --> 3:36:00.460]  saying that Islam is not a religion of peace that's quite different to denying
[3:36:00.460 --> 3:36:06.340]  the Holocaust isn't it when you've had 21 jihadist attacks in France since 2015
[3:36:06.340 --> 3:36:11.260]  January it's quite a credible argument to make that Islam is not a religion of
[3:36:11.260 --> 3:36:16.100]  peace it should at least be aired on a level with claiming that it is you know
[3:36:16.100 --> 3:36:20.220]  what is it 230 of Islamist murders in France over the last two years alone
[3:36:20.220 --> 3:36:25.420]  that's quite a solid argument to make isn't it no that's on a par with
[3:36:25.420 --> 3:36:31.740]  Holocaust denial they're going to bury the content in the same way absolutely
[3:36:31.740 --> 3:36:36.260]  incredible meanwhile as I said before the break Wikipedia literally has info
[3:36:36.260 --> 3:36:40.540]  wars on its list of fake news now we've been on other lists of fake news for
[3:36:40.540 --> 3:36:45.620]  example the prop or not list by the shadowy group that was used by the
[3:36:45.620 --> 3:36:50.540]  Washington Post to smear to demonize these news sources as fake news of
[3:36:50.540 --> 3:36:55.300]  course the others on the list were just by coincidence every major conservative
[3:36:55.300 --> 3:37:00.140]  slash libertarian website on the internet well gee that's a massive coincidence
[3:37:00.140 --> 3:37:04.500]  isn't it could it be that they're using this fake news narrative to just bury
[3:37:04.500 --> 3:37:08.180]  alternative opinions well of course that's what they're doing they've tried
[3:37:08.180 --> 3:37:11.900]  it over and over again the Washington Post had to back down there you see it
[3:37:11.900 --> 3:37:17.020]  out of Wikipedia in four wars so we're surrounded by all these websites that
[3:37:17.020 --> 3:37:22.020]  deliberately put out fake news that they know is fake completely insane stuff
[3:37:22.020 --> 3:37:27.620]  like you know Hillary Clinton killed an FBI agent that's what they say and then
[3:37:27.620 --> 3:37:32.380]  it's info wars these other lists have had outlets like Breitbart daily caller
[3:37:32.380 --> 3:37:37.500]  again totally transparent effort to silence their critics part of this
[3:37:37.500 --> 3:37:42.820]  post-election Trump derangement syndrome despite the fact that the study
[3:37:42.820 --> 3:37:47.820]  showed the key Stanford University study that fake news had no impact on
[3:37:47.820 --> 3:37:53.380]  voting in the U.S. election but they're still trying to spin this narrative now
[3:37:53.380 --> 3:37:58.820]  we have Wikipedia coming out with its own news agency to tackle fake news they're
[3:37:58.820 --> 3:38:03.940]  gonna keep trying it and it's all about censorship let's move on to some global
[3:38:03.940 --> 3:38:06.780]  news now of course we had the French election the first round of it a couple
[3:38:06.780 --> 3:38:11.740]  of days ago this is that of West Monster bookies give lapin win same
[3:38:11.740 --> 3:38:16.740]  probability as Brexit and Trump so now they're saying of course the polls show
[3:38:16.740 --> 3:38:22.460]  were Macron 20 points ahead Marine Le Pen's got no chance whatsoever she stood
[3:38:22.460 --> 3:38:26.940]  down as leader of the National Front yesterday to try and give herself another
[3:38:26.940 --> 3:38:32.940]  chance but the establishment is still terrified even though this establishment
[3:38:32.940 --> 3:38:38.220]  guy this literal Rothschild banker they literally held banquets and fundraisers
[3:38:38.220 --> 3:38:43.540]  for him two years ago I tweeted that earlier Macron he's 20 points ahead and
[3:38:43.540 --> 3:38:48.180]  they're still terrified that Marine Le Pen could win because most people have
[3:38:48.180 --> 3:38:52.100]  said that this is a step up for four years time five years time if anything
[3:38:52.100 --> 3:38:56.340]  of France that we used to know as France is left by them but they're still
[3:38:56.340 --> 3:39:02.260]  petrified of Marine Le Pen winning despite the fact she's 20 points behind
[3:39:02.260 --> 3:39:08.260]  this is out of Axios expect Trump to inject chaos into French election they
[3:39:08.260 --> 3:39:14.380]  actually say that distrust of Muslim migrants in France is Vladimir Putin's
[3:39:14.380 --> 3:39:19.660]  fault nothing to do with the 230 plus Islamist murders in France over the last
[3:39:19.660 --> 3:39:24.140]  two years nothing to do with the 21 g haddist attacks since Charlie Hebdo
[3:39:24.140 --> 3:39:27.980]  nothing to do with the fact there've been six terrorist attacks in Paris alone
[3:39:27.980 --> 3:39:33.300]  in the last three years no nothing to do with that it's Vladimir Putin's fault
[3:39:33.300 --> 3:39:37.340]  that people have concerns about Muslim migrants even though a Muslim migrant
[3:39:37.340 --> 3:39:44.660]  literally mowed down 86 people in a truck in Nice almost a year ago no that's
[3:39:44.660 --> 3:39:50.060]  Vladimir Putin's fault as well listen to this the polls say centrist Emmanuel
[3:39:50.060 --> 3:39:53.580]  Macron has more or less smooth sailing to the French presidency in the second
[3:39:53.580 --> 3:39:58.060]  round of voting on May 7th but Kremlin linked hackers have already attempted
[3:39:58.060 --> 3:40:01.460]  to infiltrate his campaign and political observers expect further attempts to
[3:40:01.460 --> 3:40:05.980]  disrupt the election by Vladimir Putin who supports far-right leader Marine
[3:40:05.980 --> 3:40:11.460]  Le Pen so any scandals any dirt that comes out about Macron over the next
[3:40:11.460 --> 3:40:16.660]  10 days they're gonna blame it once again on the familiar boogeyman Russian
[3:40:16.660 --> 3:40:22.780]  hackers the article continues US and European intelligence agencies have
[3:40:22.780 --> 3:40:26.580]  wrung the alarm about intrusive Russian cyber and fake news attacks that appear
[3:40:26.580 --> 3:40:30.900]  designed to create a crisis environment in the West now experts say France is
[3:40:30.900 --> 3:40:36.740]  next listen to what they say in this article even if Putin can't swing the
[3:40:36.740 --> 3:40:41.140]  election to her Marine Le Pen he can serve his long game of encouraging
[3:40:41.140 --> 3:40:45.260]  divisions within NATO countries and fermenting doubt about the integrity of
[3:40:45.260 --> 3:40:50.500]  their democratic institutions look for fake news to raise the specter of
[3:40:50.500 --> 3:40:57.300]  terrorism and so distrust of Muslim migrants really we need fake news to do
[3:40:57.300 --> 3:41:01.500]  that do we we've literally got people being moaned down every two weeks in
[3:41:01.500 --> 3:41:09.020]  Westminster in Stockholm in Nice 86 dead 400 plus injured murders all over the
[3:41:09.020 --> 3:41:14.100]  place why do we need fake news to prove that that's a problem oh but it's
[3:41:14.100 --> 3:41:19.140]  Vladimir Putin's fault yeah Vladimir Putin isn't why there's concern about
[3:41:19.140 --> 3:41:25.060]  mass Muslim immigration okay little dead kids on the street or why there's
[3:41:25.060 --> 3:41:31.500]  concern about that absolutely incredible the New York Times follow suit in
[3:41:31.500 --> 3:41:36.140]  another headline Russian hackers who targeted Clinton again no evidence for
[3:41:36.140 --> 3:41:40.740]  that a pietote attack Francis Macron in fact WikiLeaks put out a video where
[3:41:40.740 --> 3:41:47.180]  Comey says there's no evidence for Russia hacking the DNC leaks the NSA set head
[3:41:47.180 --> 3:41:51.660]  says it all these different people say it yet concurrently the media still
[3:41:51.660 --> 3:41:56.460]  reporting it New York Times reports the campaign of French presidential candidate
[3:41:56.460 --> 3:41:59.460]  Emmanuel Macron has been targeted by what appears to be the same Russian
[3:41:59.460 --> 3:42:02.580]  operatives responsible for hacks of Democratic campaign officials before
[3:42:02.580 --> 3:42:06.980]  last year's American presidential election a cyber security firm warns in a
[3:42:06.980 --> 3:42:13.860]  new report so they're now spinning the yarn that any dirt any scandals about
[3:42:13.860 --> 3:42:18.740]  Macron which is quite possible given the fact that what was in ninth grade when
[3:42:18.740 --> 3:42:23.740]  he had a relationship with his teacher who went on to become his wife while she
[3:42:23.740 --> 3:42:27.500]  was married with kids from another guy seems that they might be some kind of
[3:42:27.500 --> 3:42:32.020]  skeletons in the closet there maybe but if anything comes out about that over
[3:42:32.020 --> 3:42:36.660]  the next 10 days any dirt any scandal any controversy whatsoever just blame
[3:42:36.660 --> 3:42:43.060]  the Russian hackers once again they're that terrified she's 20 points behind
[3:42:43.060 --> 3:42:48.940]  barring a massive God forbid terrorist attack or some massive scandal about
[3:42:48.940 --> 3:42:53.580]  Macron it's not gonna happen for Marine Le Pen this time around it may happen in
[3:42:53.580 --> 3:42:57.820]  four or five years time so they're already setting that narrative but again I
[3:42:57.820 --> 3:43:02.620]  agree with the New York Times you know hacking the communications of French
[3:43:02.620 --> 3:43:06.300]  presidents which they accused Russian hackers of doing in the case of Macron
[3:43:06.300 --> 3:43:11.100]  hacking the communications of French presidents is dreadful that's terrible
[3:43:11.100 --> 3:43:15.020]  should be discouraged should be rightly condemned all right apart from when
[3:43:15.020 --> 3:43:21.620]  Obama and the NSA did it for six plus years then nobody gave a damn BBC news
[3:43:21.620 --> 3:43:28.700]  reported flashback to this article US spied on French presidents WikiLeaks the
[3:43:28.700 --> 3:43:33.820]  US National Security Agency spied on French presidents Jack Shirat Nicholas
[3:43:33.820 --> 3:43:39.780]  Sarkozy and Francois Hollande from 2006 to 2012 WikiLeaks says the whistleblower
[3:43:39.780 --> 3:43:43.900]  website sites top secret intelligence reports and technical documents from
[3:43:43.900 --> 3:43:48.060]  the NSA it said the secret files derived from directly targeted NSA
[3:43:48.060 --> 3:43:51.940]  surveillance of the communications of the three French presidents as well as
[3:43:51.940 --> 3:43:56.820]  French ministers and the ambassador to the US so it's really terrible to hack
[3:43:56.820 --> 3:44:01.860]  the communications of French presidents if you're Russian hackers but if
[3:44:01.860 --> 3:44:07.300]  Obama does it and the NSA does it it's perfectly fine nobody gives a damn
[3:44:07.300 --> 3:44:14.660]  okay moving on French press candidate Macron Merkel's migrant policy saved our
[3:44:14.660 --> 3:44:18.820]  dignity labels criticism disgusting this is a Breitbart article it's actually
[3:44:18.820 --> 3:44:23.420]  from back in January but again I flashed back to it because he literally said
[3:44:23.420 --> 3:44:29.620]  six months after a Tunisian Muslim migrant killed 86 people in the streets
[3:44:29.620 --> 3:44:35.780]  of Nice that we should celebrate Muslim immigration he wants more of it despite
[3:44:35.780 --> 3:44:39.740]  the fact they're having these huge problems in France in Paris the street
[3:44:39.740 --> 3:44:45.140]  fights the rapes the assaults the terror attacks he wants to import more of that
[3:44:45.140 --> 3:44:49.180]  belief system French left socialist presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron
[3:44:49.180 --> 3:44:54.020]  has said German Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door mass migration policy
[3:44:54.020 --> 3:44:58.940]  has saved our collective dignity and warned that criticism of Merkel was a
[3:44:58.940 --> 3:45:05.740]  disgusting simplification so this is the guy Ross child banker never elected to
[3:45:05.740 --> 3:45:12.700]  office in his life his entire political campaign cultivated by the French
[3:45:12.700 --> 3:45:19.500]  establishment the bureaucracy sold him as a phony fake Obama type populist this
[3:45:19.500 --> 3:45:24.060]  is the guy who's gonna take France into the next four or five years celebrating
[3:45:24.060 --> 3:45:31.380]  an open-door policy on Muslim migration after 21 jihadist attacks in
[3:45:31.380 --> 3:45:39.220]  France alone six in three years in the capital city Paris this is the guy and
[3:45:39.220 --> 3:45:43.620]  he's 20 points ahead according to the polls can you believe that maybe it's
[3:45:43.620 --> 3:45:47.740]  something to do with those 500,000 ballots that people living outside of
[3:45:47.740 --> 3:45:53.460]  France who are his core voters received so they could vote twice just a mistake
[3:45:53.460 --> 3:45:57.100]  we're not going to investigate it until after the election no need to worry about
[3:45:57.100 --> 3:46:02.380]  it this is the guy who's probably gonna take France forward in the next four to
[3:46:02.380 --> 3:46:08.020]  five years absolutely incredible the polls show he's got about an 85% chance
[3:46:08.020 --> 3:46:12.420]  of winning the polls showed the same thing before Brexit and we all know
[3:46:12.420 --> 3:46:18.900]  what happened moving on to other global news now Isis once apologized to Israel
[3:46:18.900 --> 3:46:22.980]  for attacking IDF soldiers former defense ministers stunning admission
[3:46:22.980 --> 3:46:28.500]  former Israeli defense minister Moshath Yalon made a stunning admission during
[3:46:28.500 --> 3:46:33.500]  an interview with Israel's Channel 10 news on Sunday Saturday sorry Yalon who
[3:46:33.500 --> 3:46:39.380]  served as Israel's defense minister from 2013 up until May 2016 told Channel 10
[3:46:39.380 --> 3:46:43.380]  news reporter Eli Levi that ISIS had apologized for attacking Israeli
[3:46:43.380 --> 3:46:49.100]  defense forces operating in the Syrian Golan Heights isn't that interesting
[3:46:49.100 --> 3:46:53.660]  given that last year the director of the powerful Israeli think tank named the
[3:46:53.660 --> 3:46:57.980]  Beggin-Sadat Center for strategic strategic studies said ISIS can be a
[3:46:57.980 --> 3:47:02.460]  useful tool in undermining Iran, Hezbollah, Syria and Russia which of
[3:47:02.460 --> 3:47:05.580]  course is exactly the same thing that Thomas Friedman said in the New York
[3:47:05.580 --> 3:47:10.500]  Times we talked about that last week openly calling on Trump to leave ISIS
[3:47:10.500 --> 3:47:16.180]  alone because they were useful in the region just like the CFR just like the
[3:47:16.180 --> 3:47:21.820]  establishment armed these al-Qaeda militants years ago that started the
[3:47:21.820 --> 3:47:27.340]  civil war in Syria in the first place and again most of them defected to al-Qaeda
[3:47:27.340 --> 3:47:32.500]  or ISIS groups or at least gave them their weapons there are no moderate
[3:47:32.500 --> 3:47:37.660]  rebels but now Israel is having to apologize or Israel is now revealing
[3:47:37.660 --> 3:47:43.700]  that ISIS had to apologize for firing on them during a battle ISIS the blood
[3:47:43.700 --> 3:47:48.900]  thirsty terror gang that beheads people that burns people alive in cages fires
[3:47:48.900 --> 3:47:52.460]  at Israeli troops and they say what's we're sorry about that they're polite
[3:47:52.460 --> 3:47:56.820]  about it isn't that odd given that the Pentagon again we had the documents
[3:47:56.820 --> 3:48:03.260]  foresaw the rise of ISIS in Syria they called it the jihadist principality they
[3:48:03.260 --> 3:48:08.180]  knew it was going to happen they went along with the policy anyway and now
[3:48:08.180 --> 3:48:12.020]  ISIS is being all polite to Israeli soldiers when they fire upon them very
[3:48:12.020 --> 3:48:17.180]  interesting situation the US risks being wiped off the map with nuclear
[3:48:17.180 --> 3:48:20.340]  counter-strike actually that they're talking about the UK this is a Russian
[3:48:20.340 --> 3:48:24.740]  senator this is out of RT the UK which recently said it could launch a preemptive
[3:48:24.740 --> 3:48:29.260]  nuclear strike in the most extreme circumstances runs the risk of being
[3:48:29.260 --> 3:48:33.700]  wiped off the face of the earth the deputy head of a Russian upper house
[3:48:33.700 --> 3:48:38.860]  committee said tensions continue to build there also in North Korea RT
[3:48:38.860 --> 3:48:43.340]  reports ten minute warning Japan instructs citizens on potential North
[3:48:43.340 --> 3:48:48.140]  Korea strike remember we had the reports out of South Korea back a couple of
[3:48:48.140 --> 3:48:52.300]  weeks ago they were panicked they were exchanging messages that you know an
[3:48:52.300 --> 3:48:56.220]  attack was imminent because that is what will probably happen North Korea will
[3:48:56.220 --> 3:49:01.500]  launch the missiles into South Korea into Seoul now Japanese citizens are
[3:49:01.500 --> 3:49:06.580]  being warned about this it would take ten minutes just ten minutes for a North
[3:49:06.580 --> 3:49:10.620]  Korean missile to hit Japan Tokyo estimates as tensions between the
[3:49:10.620 --> 3:49:14.540]  country's grow guidelines on what to do if a strike actually happens have been
[3:49:14.540 --> 3:49:19.780]  published online and have recently seen a huge surge in interest so they've set
[3:49:19.780 --> 3:49:24.500]  up a new Japanese civil security website which says that a North Korean
[3:49:24.500 --> 3:49:29.020]  missile would reach the country in a very short time adding that a missile
[3:49:29.020 --> 3:49:33.100]  could cover a distance of 1600 kilometers and reach Japan in just ten
[3:49:33.100 --> 3:49:38.780]  minutes so they're telling Japanese people to basically find the most
[3:49:38.780 --> 3:49:42.620]  secure building in the event of a strike the government recommend citizens
[3:49:42.620 --> 3:49:47.460]  calmly go to the start strongest concrete building nearby stay low to the
[3:49:47.460 --> 3:49:53.540]  floor or get under a table so these preparations are really stepping up now
[3:49:53.540 --> 3:49:58.540]  this is by no means over another article North Korea stages firing drill
[3:49:58.540 --> 3:50:03.340]  marking military anniversary of course we had speculation that they could use
[3:50:03.340 --> 3:50:07.940]  this anniversary at the 85th founding anniversary of their military to stage
[3:50:07.940 --> 3:50:12.860]  that six nuclear tests that the Trump administration has said will probably
[3:50:12.860 --> 3:50:19.060]  trigger a military attack on North Korea they didn't do that thankfully now
[3:50:19.060 --> 3:50:23.620]  they've just held a large drill signs are detected that North Korea's military
[3:50:23.620 --> 3:50:26.980]  is conducting a large-scale drill around the eastern part of Wonsan on the
[3:50:26.980 --> 3:50:31.780]  anniversary so they seem to have scaled it back remember over the weekend we had
[3:50:31.780 --> 3:50:36.980]  China say come out and say if there's an attempt at regime change in North
[3:50:36.980 --> 3:50:42.100]  Korea if they try to take out Kim Jong-un as has been suggested China will
[3:50:42.100 --> 3:50:47.980]  not calmly sit back and let that happen they will in almost all circumstances
[3:50:47.980 --> 3:50:53.860]  counter attack and you know what that means it means World War 3 and absolute
[3:50:53.860 --> 3:50:57.900]  chaos will be back with a final segment of the Alex Jones show live in four

[3:56:34.660 --> 3:56:38.540]  from the White House where he was leading the resistance against Donald
[3:56:38.540 --> 3:56:43.020]  Trump while taking four hundred thousand dollars to give speeches to Wall
[3:56:43.020 --> 3:56:47.140]  Street bankers because he's a man of the people well now former Obama White
[3:56:47.140 --> 3:56:50.860]  House press secretary Joss Josh Ernest has said that the former president will

[3:56:54.300 --> 3:56:59.900]  crosses clear red lines that was said during an interview on MSNBC and we all

[3:57:40.500 --> 3:57:43.980]  example people who want to take taxi rides with dogs there's certain belief
[3:57:43.980 --> 3:57:48.540]  system in the world which really hates dogs and mistreats dogs and animals in
[3:57:48.540 --> 3:57:53.900]  general and now Germany after accepting what two million Muslim migrants is now
