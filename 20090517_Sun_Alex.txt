[00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:34.666]  KLBJ Austin, it's 4 o'clock.
[00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:38.806]  Fox News Radio, I'm Karen Riegel.
[00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:46.653]  When President Obama addressed the graduates of Notre Dame, he also addressed the controversy that preceded and accompanied his visit.
[00:00:46.653 --> 00:00:49.275]  Let's go live now to Fox News Radio's Jennifer Kiper.
[00:00:49.275 --> 00:00:56.982]  Karen, President Barack Obama talked about abortion, telling graduates... So let us work together to reduce the number of women seeking abortions.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.861]  Let's reduce unintended pregnancy.
[00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:02.702]  Some guests who stood up and yelled were escorted from the audience.
[00:01:02.702 --> 00:01:06.043]  The students in unison chanting back, we are ND.
[00:01:06.043 --> 00:01:11.245]  On some graduation caps in protest of the president's visit, the sign of the cross and baby's feet.
[00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:17.068]  Outside, at least 27 people arrested on trespassing charges before and during the event.
[00:01:17.068 --> 00:01:17.328]  Karen?
[00:01:17.808 --> 00:01:25.233]  Jennifer, this abortion controversy comes as President Obama is considering who will replace Justice David Souter on the nation's highest court.
[00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:28.015]  Senator Mitch McConnell is the Senate's top Republican.
[00:01:28.015 --> 00:01:30.877]  I think Chief Justice Roberts had it right during his confirmation hearing.
[00:01:30.877 --> 00:01:33.279]  He said the judge ought to be like an umpire.
[00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:35.700]  Call the balls and strikes, but don't make the rules.
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.301]  That's the kind of individual we're looking for.
[00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:40.664]  We know it will be someone of the political left, but a number of
[00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:46.976]  Leftist judges have been able to put aside their personal views and call it like they see it.
[00:01:46.976 --> 00:01:48.637]  He spoke on Fox News Sunday.
[00:01:48.637 --> 00:01:58.406]  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi got hammered on the Sunday talk shows after claiming last week the CIA lied to her about the use of enhanced interrogation techniques.
[00:01:59.106 --> 00:02:09.852]  I am less interested in investigating whether her memory was correct or she lied about it than I am in the policies that flow from the debate that we're having.
[00:02:09.852 --> 00:02:14.395]  I am not one who thinks we ought to have truth commissions and all the rest of it and keep looking backward.
[00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:15.315]  I agree with the president.
[00:02:15.315 --> 00:02:16.316]  We've got enough on our plate.
[00:02:16.316 --> 00:02:17.076]  We need to look forward.
[00:02:17.296 --> 00:02:19.859]  The senator was on ABC's This Week.
[00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:27.446]  CIA Chief Leon Panetta said last week the CIA misleads no one and was straightforward when it came to briefing lawmakers.
[00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:29.688]  You're listening to Fox News Radio.
[00:02:29.688 --> 00:02:30.489]  Fair and balanced.
[00:02:36.705 --> 00:02:40.047]  News Radio 590, KLBJ, good afternoon.
[00:02:40.047 --> 00:02:41.208]  It's 4.02.
[00:02:41.208 --> 00:02:42.769]  I'm Sarah Hudeberg.
[00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:50.513]  Topping Austin's news, the Austin City Council approves almost $800,000 in solar rebates for area businesses.
[00:02:50.513 --> 00:02:59.839]  Austin Energy's Ed Clark says that amount is the highest paid out so far to commercial property owners since the solar rebate program was launched.
[00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:00.800]  We do have a limit.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.341]  We do have a budget limit.
[00:03:02.341 --> 00:03:05.723]  And that budget limit right now is about $4 million a year.
[00:03:06.383 --> 00:03:15.528]  Clark says Austin businesses can also benefit from federal tax credits that pay for up to 80% of solar panel installation.
[00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:24.732]  Well, the feds will likely help Austin's main transit agency start a new rapid bus program for two very long north to south routes.
[00:03:24.732 --> 00:03:32.016]  It is part of a program from the president that designates $17 million in funding for two of Capital Metro's Metro Rapid buses.
[00:03:32.574 --> 00:03:37.878]  Cabinetress Adam Chavitz tells KLBJ it means the agency will not have to front all of the money.
[00:03:37.878 --> 00:03:42.501]  The fact that we've already been recommended for about $17 million is really great news.
[00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:47.145]  Chavitz says ultimately they'll have to cover up to $37 million with federal funding.
[00:03:47.145 --> 00:03:48.446]  One route would link St.
[00:03:48.446 --> 00:03:52.769]  David's North with South Park Meadows to the south using Burn It and South Congress.
[00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:57.812]  The Texas House has adopted new guidelines over how corporate money can be used in elections.
[00:03:57.812 --> 00:04:00.034]  News Radio 590 KLVJ's Emily Trube has more.

[00:07:15.626 --> 00:07:26.894]  Well, let me just start the broadcast by putting a time stamp on it, because we stand behind what we say over the years and the decades, and fortunately it all comes true right on time.
[00:07:26.894 --> 00:07:36.501]  As we're reading the government's own declassified documents about how they work for offshore banks to set up a world government to carry out eugenics against the people of the planet.
[00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:38.122]  So it is May 17, 2009, a Sunday edition.
[00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:45.020]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.840]  Lots of phone calls today.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.661]  877-590-5525.
[00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:55.442]  877-590-5525 will get you up and on the air.
[00:07:55.442 --> 00:08:00.604]  You can also call the local line from the station that this syndicated transmission comes to you from.
[00:08:00.604 --> 00:08:03.004]  News Radio 590 KLBJ.
[00:08:03.004 --> 00:08:03.244]  That's 836-0590.
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:15.808]  On any issue, any news item, anything you want to talk about, it is a complete and absolute total free-for-all today.
[00:08:15.808 --> 00:08:18.810]  That said, here is the news I have in front of me.
[00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:23.354]  The Bilderberg Group meeting is breaking up as we speak.
[00:08:23.354 --> 00:08:25.856]  Well, I guess they're eight hours ahead of us.
[00:08:25.856 --> 00:08:30.660]  So over there, it's almost the 18th over there.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.322]  I guess it is the 18th over there.
[00:08:33.322 --> 00:08:35.264]  So yesterday in Greece, but
[00:08:35.666 --> 00:08:42.992]  Today in North America, the Bilderberg Group concluded its 57th annual meeting.
[00:08:42.992 --> 00:08:50.737]  And for those that don't know, I put this in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, but now it's been completely declassified by the British and U.S.
[00:08:50.737 --> 00:08:59.864]  governments, wartime army documents from the Army and Marines and the British military as well, that the Nazis knew they were going to lose by 44.
[00:09:01.823 --> 00:09:10.167]  So they went underground and set up an organization that publicly emerged in 54 as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:09:10.167 --> 00:09:24.715]  They were going to set up a European Union, buy off the United States, and set up a North American Union, and that's in the Globe and Mail, BBC, and other major international publications.
[00:09:24.715 --> 00:09:25.795]  Now, I want to be clear.
[00:09:25.795 --> 00:09:27.056]  The New World Order is not Nazi.
[00:09:29.062 --> 00:09:35.789]  What really happened is, you know, the British media is spinning it that the European Union was set up by Nazis.
[00:09:35.789 --> 00:09:37.171]  And that's true to a certain extent.
[00:09:37.171 --> 00:09:47.622]  You had a lot of wealth, trillions of dollars, even in the numbers of the 40s, the tens of trillions today, that went underground.
[00:09:47.622 --> 00:09:50.845]  And it was intermarried with the British and other wealthy around Europe.
[00:09:52.574 --> 00:09:53.715]  A lot of U.S.
[00:09:53.715 --> 00:09:59.757]  financiers and robber barons were buddies with the German aristocracy, the Crumps and others.
[00:09:59.757 --> 00:10:04.960]  The Rothschilds of England owned large parts of Germany at the time.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.901]  The King of England had to advocate because he was a public Nazi, Edward VIII.
[00:10:08.901 --> 00:10:12.163]  That's all on record, though it's not common knowledge.
[00:10:12.163 --> 00:10:14.384]  It's in the mainline history books.
[00:10:14.384 --> 00:10:15.644]  And so in 54, the CIA, with
[00:10:23.063 --> 00:10:34.166]  Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands and others set up the first Bilderberg Group meeting to kind of bring together the German money with the Anglo-American slash Dutch money.
[00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:37.367]  And the Dutch have always been more closely allied to the Anglo-Americans, the U.S.
[00:10:37.367 --> 00:10:38.628]  and England, than they have been to the Germans.
[00:10:38.628 --> 00:10:40.208]  But that's kind of the nexus point.
[00:10:40.208 --> 00:10:46.370]  That's why it was the go-between point at the Bilderberg Hotel in the Netherlands for that meeting to take place.
[00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:52.032]  And the Bilderberg Group has been bragging the last five or six years.
[00:10:52.032 --> 00:11:14.757]  They released their minutes of their first meeting, of some of the meetings in the 60s as well, decades later, where they had bragged that they set up the Treaty of Rome to set up the European Union covertly, that they're setting up the North American Union by stealth, that they're basically shaping the world we live in today, an undemocratic, tyrannical world ruled by a private group of banks.
[00:11:18.956 --> 00:11:23.238]  German chancellors and British prime ministers, people like David Rockefeller, write memoirs.
[00:11:23.238 --> 00:11:27.061]  He wrote his memoir four and a half years ago, bragging, yes, I'm trying to overthrow the U.S.
[00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:28.642]  and set up a new world order.
[00:11:28.642 --> 00:11:31.163]  I'm proud of it.
[00:11:31.163 --> 00:11:35.786]  Now, the elite will have all the rights in the world under this system, and everybody else will be poor slaves.
[00:11:35.786 --> 00:11:37.066]  Now, this is not a good system.
[00:11:37.066 --> 00:11:44.010]  Now, in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s, and 90s, and on through today, in the year 2009,
[00:11:45.342 --> 00:11:53.949]  They run TV shows and movies and news articles making fun of people that believe in the New World Order and international banks.
[00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:56.732]  And then they would mix in absurd things, you know.
[00:11:56.732 --> 00:11:58.253]  Well, I mean, here's a clip.
[00:11:58.253 --> 00:12:00.995]  And there's been tens of thousands of things I've seen on television like this.
[00:12:00.995 --> 00:12:02.076]  You've all seen it.
[00:12:02.076 --> 00:12:03.157]  It's propaganda.
[00:12:03.157 --> 00:12:05.078]  You're being brainwashed.
[00:12:05.078 --> 00:12:06.760]  Not so funny today, though.
[00:12:07.423 --> 00:12:12.325]  When you realize that openly they're announcing a new Bank of the World that you will pay your global carbon taxes to.
[00:12:12.325 --> 00:12:16.647]  So, we've learned the new Bilderberg Group agenda for 2009 to 2010.
[00:12:16.647 --> 00:12:19.208]  We'll go over that.
[00:12:19.208 --> 00:12:25.151]  That dovetails with Government Ready's Youth Corps to take on veterans in the United States.
[00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:26.811]  No, I'm not kidding.
[00:12:26.811 --> 00:12:27.632]  You heard me.
[00:12:27.632 --> 00:12:31.073]  A Youth Corps under the federal government to take on U.S.
[00:12:31.073 --> 00:12:32.053]  veterans and gun owners.
[00:12:32.053 --> 00:12:33.174]  Remember the DHS report?
[00:12:33.473 --> 00:12:43.857]  A few months ago we broke, people never believed me all the years, I warned you now we have the declassified documents, that their main buildup of homeland security is for the American people.
[00:12:43.857 --> 00:12:48.638]  It's all been set up for us, if we don't like the foreign bankers bankrupting everything.
[00:12:48.638 --> 00:12:51.079]  But let's go ahead and play Archie Bunker.
[00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:52.440]  In fact, I don't have the printout in front of me.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:57.121]  What year is this Archie Bunker from?
[00:12:57.121 --> 00:12:58.322]  I know it was back in the 70s.
[00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:00.580]  Here is R.G.
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:07.588]  Bunker back in the 1970s talking about international bankers and communists wanting our guns.
[00:13:07.588 --> 00:13:08.929]  Ha ha ha, isn't R.G.
[00:13:08.929 --> 00:13:10.191]  Bunker an idiot?
[00:13:10.191 --> 00:13:20.042]  This is so that years later when they openly set it up, when you tried to fight back against it, your neighbors, most of you don't know why you laugh at people that talk about global cabals.
[00:13:20.609 --> 00:13:23.732]  Most of you don't know why you won't get involved in defending your country.
[00:13:23.732 --> 00:13:29.298]  You've been preconditioned tens of thousands of times by TV and culture that it's kooky to do so.
[00:13:29.298 --> 00:13:33.822]  They destroyed your natural defenses for sovereignty, for patriotism.
[00:13:33.822 --> 00:13:36.084]  They call it evil nationalism.
[00:13:36.084 --> 00:13:38.146]  Well, here they are making fun of Archie Bunker.
[00:13:38.146 --> 00:13:39.027]  He's the buffoon.
[00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:39.868]  He's the racist.
[00:13:39.868 --> 00:13:41.069]  He's the idiot.
[00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:44.072]  And how dare him not want to turn his guns in and have international bankers ruling.
[00:13:45.782 --> 00:13:46.803]  Good evening, everybody.
[00:13:46.803 --> 00:13:56.168]  This is Archie Parker of 704 Houser Street, veteran of the big war, speaking on behalf of Guns for Everybody.
[00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:57.989]  Now, question.
[00:13:57.989 --> 00:14:02.292]  What was the first thing that the communists done when they took over Russia?
[00:14:02.292 --> 00:14:03.813]  Answer, gun control.
[00:14:03.813 --> 00:14:09.496]  And there's a lot of people in this country who want to do the same thing to us here in a kind of conspiracy scene.
[00:14:10.174 --> 00:14:13.375]  You take your big international bankers.
[00:14:13.375 --> 00:14:18.838]  They want to, what do you call it, masticate the people of this here nation like puppets on a wing.
[00:14:18.838 --> 00:14:22.760]  And then they're going to get their gun and turn us over to the commies.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.561]  I'm glad they put you on a stool.
[00:14:25.561 --> 00:14:29.463]  You look tall as sitting down.
[00:14:29.463 --> 00:14:35.585]  Now I want to talk about another thing that's on everybody's mind today, and that's your stick-ups and your skyjackets.
[00:14:35.585 --> 00:14:39.487]  Which, if that was up to me, I could end the skyjackets tomorrow.
[00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:41.260]  You could.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:46.502]  All you gotta do is arm all your passengers.
[00:14:46.502 --> 00:14:50.344]  I mean, he ain't got no more superiority there.
[00:14:50.344 --> 00:14:52.885]  He ain't gonna dare to pull out no rod.
[00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:57.628]  And then your airlines, then they wouldn't have to chase the passengers on the ground no more.
[00:14:57.628 --> 00:15:03.651]  They just pass out the pistols at the beginning of the trip, and they pull them up again at the end.
[00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:04.311]  Case closed.
[00:15:06.832 --> 00:15:13.138]  All right, folks, we're going to come right back and analyze this brainwashing and take your phone calls and a lot more.
[00:15:13.138 --> 00:15:16.060]  But this is how programming works.
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.683]  This is how it's always worked.
[00:15:18.683 --> 00:15:24.368]  But, you know, in the states where they have said everybody can be armed with concealed carry, crime rates go down on average 24 percent.
[00:15:24.368 --> 00:15:31.594]  So actually, that sounds radical to gelded domesticated slaves, but not to everybody else.
[00:15:31.594 --> 00:15:32.355]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:44.497 --> 00:15:45.298]  We're good to go.
[00:16:09.518 --> 00:16:13.381]  Yeah, we're good.
[00:16:22.708 --> 00:16:24.710]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.332]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:16:28.332 --> 00:16:30.174]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:16:30.174 --> 00:16:33.977]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:16:33.977 --> 00:16:39.061]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[00:16:39.361 --> 00:16:47.909]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[00:16:47.909 --> 00:16:51.493]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:16:51.493 --> 00:16:54.396]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[00:16:54.696 --> 00:16:57.198]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?

[00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:40.444]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:17:40.444 --> 00:17:48.167]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:17:48.547 --> 00:17:56.709]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:17:56.709 --> 00:18:01.811]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:18:01.811 --> 00:18:07.012]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:18:07.012 --> 00:18:11.373]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:18:11.373 --> 00:18:12.454]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:18:34.881 --> 00:18:40.387]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:18:40.387 --> 00:18:41.167]  and the world.
[00:18:41.167 --> 00:18:45.031]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.

[00:18:58.985 --> 00:19:01.786]  With double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.

[00:19:44.027 --> 00:19:47.849]  Do you think they endorse these products for free?
[00:19:47.849 --> 00:19:48.830]  I don't think so.
[00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.891]  I'm here to tell you, I'm not a celebrity and Life Change T doesn't need one.
[00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:56.133]  Think about this, the product speaks for itself!

[00:20:53.207 --> 00:20:56.489]  Okay, I'm just gonna go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[00:20:56.489 --> 00:21:00.952]  Eric and Walt and Steve and George and Bill and many others that are patiently holding us.
[00:21:00.952 --> 00:21:02.173]  Do have one line open.
[00:21:02.173 --> 00:21:02.793]  That's a rarity.
[00:21:02.793 --> 00:21:02.954]  877-590-5525 or 836-0590.
[00:21:02.954 --> 00:21:04.715]  And if you disagree with me, you're also welcome to call.
[00:21:04.715 --> 00:21:07.056]  Go to the head of the line, as long as we can keep it civil here.
[00:21:15.083 --> 00:21:15.964]  Myself included.
[00:21:15.964 --> 00:21:17.065]  You know, I have problems with that.
[00:21:17.065 --> 00:21:21.328]  877-590-5525.
[00:21:21.328 --> 00:21:26.052]  And coming up, government readies youth corps to take on vets.
[00:21:26.052 --> 00:21:34.199]  Ten minutes into errant mayhem in his town near the Mexican border, and a gunman, a disgruntled Iraq war veteran, has already taken out two people.
[00:21:34.199 --> 00:21:37.802]  One slumped at his desk, the other covered with blood on the floor.
[00:21:37.802 --> 00:21:43.026]  But here come the Boy Scouts under Homeland Security command to seek and destroy and wipe out the vets.
[00:21:43.663 --> 00:21:45.863]  That's what the New York Times is reporting.
[00:21:45.863 --> 00:21:49.284]  And you know, this isn't just one little case of it.
[00:21:49.284 --> 00:21:53.085]  There's hundreds and hundreds I'm aware of, so I'm going to try to give folks the big picture.
[00:21:53.085 --> 00:21:56.086]  This happened in Germany, this happens in Russia, this happens in China.
[00:21:56.086 --> 00:22:01.707]  I'm going to break down, and folks are on InfoWars.com, you know, reading this article we wrote.
[00:22:01.707 --> 00:22:06.048]  Government readies youth corps to take on vets.
[00:22:06.048 --> 00:22:11.689]  And they are saying, oh look at these kids, they look like wimps, they'd be easy to wipe out.
[00:22:12.597 --> 00:22:14.699]  They're not coming today.
[00:22:14.699 --> 00:22:21.505]  They're training them when they're young and impressionable to turn them loose on you when they're 18 years old.
[00:22:21.505 --> 00:22:25.068]  Yes, we know at 14 they're not that formidable.
[00:22:25.068 --> 00:22:29.432]  The point is, in just a few years, they will be.
[00:22:29.432 --> 00:22:34.076]  They want them trained, but when they're still young and stupid at 18 and don't know what they're doing.
[00:22:34.076 --> 00:22:38.540]  And by the way, the government admits these are for the American people.
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.220]  Do you understand?
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:39.681]  This is
[00:22:40.367 --> 00:22:40.907]  Serious.
[00:22:40.907 --> 00:22:43.589]  Okay, that's coming up and then the latest on the Bilderberg Group.
[00:22:43.589 --> 00:22:44.409]  Big developments there.
[00:22:44.409 --> 00:22:48.652]  The AP and Wall Street Journal and others finally reported on it.
[00:22:48.652 --> 00:22:53.994]  You never, never, never see mainstream reporting in the United States on the Bilderberg Group.
[00:22:53.994 --> 00:22:58.177]  It was 130 world leaders meet and chart the course of the planet.
[00:22:58.177 --> 00:23:09.923]  We made a big stink about it this year and AP and the Wall Street Journal reported on it, but the Wall Street Journal makes a joke out of it and says, the elite gather in Greece for a not-so-secret meeting and all, what's the big deal?
[00:23:10.356 --> 00:23:13.877]  Yeah, you just said it didn't exist all these years and now it's not so secret.
[00:23:13.877 --> 00:23:19.699]  They just arrested more than a dozen members of the press, including London Guardian reporter.
[00:23:19.699 --> 00:23:26.862]  We're trying to get within two miles on public beaches and sidewalks of the hotel.
[00:23:26.862 --> 00:23:28.522]  I mean, this is amazing.
[00:23:28.522 --> 00:23:29.783]  What is this, Russia or China?
[00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:30.983]  I guess it is.
[00:23:30.983 --> 00:23:32.544]  So we'll get to that coming up.
[00:23:32.544 --> 00:23:33.644]  Very, very important.
[00:23:33.644 --> 00:23:35.625]  Eric in California, you're on the air.
[00:23:35.625 --> 00:23:36.205]  Thanks for holding.
[00:23:36.205 --> 00:23:38.666]  Alex, how are you doing?
[00:23:38.666 --> 00:23:39.046]  Hey, buddy.
[00:23:39.046 --> 00:23:39.286]  Welcome.
[00:23:40.177 --> 00:23:42.638]  Hey, great news, Alex.
[00:23:42.638 --> 00:23:50.220]  Late last year, I did some work for Dave Mustaine and Megadeth on their new studio.
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.101]  So I got to know Dave a little bit.
[00:23:53.101 --> 00:23:57.682]  I didn't try to press him for conversation and all that, but I expected his time.
[00:23:57.682 --> 00:24:04.464]  But about a week and a half ago, I dropped by the studio and just kind of sat down with him for about a half hour and talked about various things.
[00:24:07.395 --> 00:24:12.818]  I had mentioned the fact that he'd been on your show, interviewed by you, and if you'd like to do it again.
[00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:17.601]  And he said he's got to talk to his manager and go through all the proper channels and whatnot.
[00:24:17.601 --> 00:24:19.882]  Maybe you might want to call him up.
[00:24:19.882 --> 00:24:25.245]  Set that up, because they're getting ready to send out a new album this fall.
[00:24:25.245 --> 00:24:32.949]  And he had one more song to write, and I asked him if he had seen A Bomb Deception yet, and he hadn't, so I gave him a copy.
[00:24:32.949 --> 00:24:33.910]  I had some on my truck.
[00:24:34.938 --> 00:24:43.363]  Also gave him a copy of, uh, Freedom Fascism, 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Terror Storm, and Endgame.
[00:24:43.363 --> 00:24:51.789]  So, uh, sometime this week I'm gonna follow up with him and, uh, see if he'd like to collaborate on a project to reach out to youth.
[00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:56.332]  Because this is something that's very, very deep in my heart.
[00:24:56.332 --> 00:25:03.316]  Yeah, I had Dave Mustang on, uh, because the music is all about One World Government, New World Order, and I remember listening to it,
[00:25:03.831 --> 00:25:03.991]  Not yet.
[00:25:03.991 --> 00:25:05.892]  He said he was going to watch, uh, Bomb Deception that night.
[00:25:34.096 --> 00:25:36.418]  And they might inspire his last song.
[00:25:36.418 --> 00:25:38.480]  So I'm definitely going to follow up.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.003]  I've actually got some lyrical ideas that I'd like to bounce off of him.
[00:25:43.003 --> 00:25:44.364]  But that's not why I went.
[00:25:44.364 --> 00:25:46.546]  I just wanted to talk to him.
[00:25:46.546 --> 00:25:47.527]  That's great.
[00:25:47.527 --> 00:25:48.868]  Well, listen, that's how we network.
[00:25:48.868 --> 00:25:49.748]  So stay in touch.
[00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:51.390]  And I appreciate it, Bubba.
[00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:52.851]  I will keep you in touch.
[00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:52.991]  Sure.
[00:25:52.991 --> 00:25:53.851]  Go ahead, Eric.
[00:25:53.851 --> 00:25:54.952]  What else?
[00:25:54.952 --> 00:25:55.593]  Absolutely.
[00:25:55.593 --> 00:25:56.153]  Yeah, you bet.
[00:25:56.153 --> 00:25:57.734]  I'll be talking to him this week.
[00:25:57.734 --> 00:25:58.495]  Hey, thanks a lot, man.
[00:25:58.495 --> 00:25:59.156]  I appreciate it.
[00:25:59.156 --> 00:25:59.476]  Yeah.
[00:25:59.476 --> 00:26:02.098]  You know, the person I'm proudest of waking up is Bruce Willis.
[00:26:03.291 --> 00:26:07.834]  But Bruce is a private guy, so I'm not going to get into it or talk about it.
[00:26:07.834 --> 00:26:12.317]  But according to Bruce, you won't be seeing him work for the neocons anymore.
[00:26:12.317 --> 00:26:15.058]  He still doesn't like the Democrats.
[00:26:15.058 --> 00:26:17.940]  But, well, I can talk about what is known.
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:25.805]  I had Rick Linklater on about two years ago when A Scanner Darkly came out, filmed My Men with Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder, and Woody Harrelson.
[00:26:25.805 --> 00:26:30.168]  Who's the guy from, I don't, who's the, I mean, I met him a bunch.
[00:26:30.168 --> 00:26:31.289]  No, I know Keanu good.
[00:26:32.401 --> 00:26:35.602]  I always have... I always call him Morton Downey Jr.
[00:26:35.602 --> 00:26:36.382]  Robert Downey Jr.
[00:26:36.382 --> 00:26:40.543]  It's not Morton Downey Jr., the guy with the talk show in the 80s screaming and people smoking cigarettes.
[00:26:40.543 --> 00:26:42.724]  Yeah, Robert Downey Jr.
[00:26:42.724 --> 00:26:44.644]  Anyways, I'm in that movie.
[00:26:44.644 --> 00:26:46.805]  Pretty big part, but anyway, side issue.
[00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:47.685]  I never tried to be in it.
[00:26:47.685 --> 00:26:48.805]  Rick Linklater's just a great guy.
[00:26:48.805 --> 00:26:50.946]  Well, I did try once I heard I had a chance to be in it.
[00:26:50.946 --> 00:26:52.546]  I said, absolutely put me in it.
[00:26:52.546 --> 00:26:55.787]  Great guy, Tommy Pallotta and Rick Linklater put me in it.
[00:26:55.787 --> 00:26:59.448]  I don't want to talk about myself all day, so I want to hurry and get back to your calls, but the point is,
[00:27:00.666 --> 00:27:06.931]  I had Rick on about two years ago to promote A Scanner Darkly, and I wasn't bringing up 9-11 to Rick.
[00:27:06.931 --> 00:27:10.453]  And he started saying he thought 9-11 was an inside job on the air.
[00:27:10.453 --> 00:27:13.335]  A lot of courage, you know, big director.
[00:27:13.335 --> 00:27:19.159]  School of Rock, Days of Confused, you know, list goes on and on.
[00:27:19.159 --> 00:27:29.627]  And so I had him on about that, and he said, yeah, I gave your videos to Bruce Willis, and he watched them and came back, and he sent me some of the emails Bruce had sent him.
[00:27:30.393 --> 00:27:31.894]  Saying, yeah, this has really woken me up.
[00:27:31.894 --> 00:27:33.355]  Now I understand the left-right paradigm.
[00:27:33.355 --> 00:27:35.937]  I understand both parties are controlled.
[00:27:35.937 --> 00:27:43.783]  And, uh, then I had a chance later to, uh, talk to... Well, I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[00:27:43.783 --> 00:27:48.107]  The point is, I had a private conversation with somebody after that, about six months later.
[00:27:48.107 --> 00:27:51.029]  And then people didn't believe Rick Linklater when he said it on air.
[00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:53.271]  The Neocon website said, there's no way that's true.
[00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:55.753]  You know, Michelle Malkin and people.
[00:27:55.753 --> 00:27:57.274]  Uh, and then...
[00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:09.237]  He was in Vanity Fair when a big movie came out about a year ago, and he said, yeah, the same people that killed Kennedy are running things today, and I don't believe in the left-right paradigm anymore and all this stuff.
[00:28:09.237 --> 00:28:12.218]  So that is very, very exciting.
[00:28:12.218 --> 00:28:16.401]  I mean, you know, I didn't get into this to meet Charlie Sheen, who I think is the coolest person in Hollywood.
[00:28:16.401 --> 00:28:17.261]  You got to know him in person.
[00:28:17.261 --> 00:28:19.002]  I know him really well.
[00:28:19.002 --> 00:28:19.703]  You've got to know
[00:28:22.261 --> 00:28:23.602]  Well, I'm not going to start dropping names.
[00:28:23.602 --> 00:28:28.464]  There's a lot of folks that are fans of the show, that tune in, that I talk to, that want to be private.
[00:28:28.464 --> 00:28:30.785]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:28:30.785 --> 00:28:31.166]  You know what?
[00:28:31.166 --> 00:28:32.066]  Let's go back to your calls.
[00:28:32.066 --> 00:28:33.207]  Walt in California.
[00:28:33.207 --> 00:28:33.947]  Walt, you're on the air.
[00:28:33.947 --> 00:28:35.368]  Go ahead.
[00:28:35.368 --> 00:28:36.208]  All right.
[00:28:36.208 --> 00:28:37.249]  Can you hear me okay, Alex?
[00:28:37.249 --> 00:28:37.829]  Yes, sir.
[00:28:37.829 --> 00:28:38.249]  I can.
[00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:40.030]  Welcome.
[00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:41.411]  You probably remember me.
[00:28:41.411 --> 00:28:46.313]  I marched with you in the cold, freezing rain in New York City with my brother, 911.
[00:28:50.109 --> 00:28:54.872]  That was 2007.
[00:28:54.872 --> 00:28:59.494]  We bullhorned the Federal Reserve, Larry Silverstein's building, the new Building 7, all of it.
[00:28:59.494 --> 00:29:02.876]  Yeah, it was good to be there with you.
[00:29:02.876 --> 00:29:11.621]  We huddled up in the alleyway and kept each other warm.
[00:29:11.621 --> 00:29:12.521]  Just joking.
[00:29:12.521 --> 00:29:13.142]  Hey, hold on.
[00:29:13.142 --> 00:29:13.462]  Stay there.
[00:29:13.462 --> 00:29:14.642]  I'll come back to you, man.
[00:29:14.642 --> 00:29:15.543]  Hold on just a second.
[00:29:16.502 --> 00:29:17.644]  We gotta do the news here.
[00:29:17.644 --> 00:29:18.365]  It's very important.
[00:29:18.365 --> 00:29:19.447]  Important messages.
[00:29:19.447 --> 00:29:20.710]  Crash commercial messages.
[00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:21.872]  Straight ahead.
[00:29:21.872 --> 00:29:23.134]  Holton Fair Isle.
[00:29:23.134 --> 00:29:24.817]  It's the G. Gordon Liddy Show.
[00:29:24.817 --> 00:29:25.218]  Stay with us.
[00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:45.962]  Today, we cannot afford to ignore the current state of our country, the economy, job layoffs, mass foreclosures, and now we are all at risk of being exposed to this new flu pandemic.
[00:29:45.962 --> 00:29:50.783]  The Center for Disease Control has declared a public health emergency across the United States.
[00:29:50.783 --> 00:29:52.444]  What can you do to prepare yourself?
[00:29:52.444 --> 00:29:54.924]  The answer is ZeroFlu.com.
[00:29:54.924 --> 00:29:58.685]  ZeroFlu.com offers you the very best at air purifiers.
[00:29:58.685 --> 00:30:01.586]  These revolutionary air purifiers protect up to 3,000 square feet of your home
[00:30:02.426 --> 00:30:03.287]  We're good to go.
[00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:36.694]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[00:30:36.694 --> 00:30:40.495]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[00:30:40.495 --> 00:30:43.317]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:30:43.317 --> 00:30:50.500]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.000]  We're good.
[00:31:07.105 --> 00:31:11.249]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[00:31:11.249 --> 00:31:17.054]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:31:17.054 --> 00:31:22.098]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[00:31:22.098 --> 00:31:26.562]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:31:26.562 --> 00:31:29.204]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[00:31:29.204 --> 00:31:29.925]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:31:29.925 --> 00:31:30.545]  Ah, springtime.
[00:31:35.231 --> 00:31:40.894]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[00:31:40.894 --> 00:31:45.376]  The answer is all-natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:31:45.376 --> 00:31:51.359]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP to kill parasites.
[00:31:51.359 --> 00:31:59.984]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[00:31:59.984 --> 00:32:02.625]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[00:32:02.925 --> 00:32:13.788]  Our natural insecticides work in the home, on plants, and in your garden, killing pests mechanically, not with poisons, so pests can't develop an immunity and they won't harm your children or pets.
[00:32:13.788 --> 00:32:23.631]  It's effective against white flies, moths, bedbugs, fleas, roaches, crickets, and more, and safe enough to use on your pets, ridding them of fleas and other pests.

[00:32:26.192 --> 00:32:26.733]  We're good.

[00:33:03.058 --> 00:33:04.159]  Need something more?
[00:33:04.159 --> 00:33:08.104]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[00:33:08.104 --> 00:33:16.414]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.

[00:33:21.159 --> 00:33:23.940]  I can't get enough of that Jimi Hendrix.
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:25.100]  I think this song says it all.
[00:33:52.158 --> 00:34:06.728]  Alright, I'm in a phone blitz and I'm getting into the most hardcore news I've covered in a while.
[00:34:06.728 --> 00:34:13.392]  I mean, I already knew they were training little kids in public school, the Boy Scouts and others, to take on American gun owners.
[00:34:13.392 --> 00:34:14.994]  I mean, I had that in government documents.
[00:34:14.994 --> 00:34:19.897]  But to have it right in the New York Times is just amazing with all these sickening photographs of it.
[00:34:20.526 --> 00:34:25.550]  That's coming up in a breakdown of the 2009-2010 Bilderberg Group agenda.
[00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:33.736]  And this is like looking into a crystal ball in the past, so you'll want to stay tuned for that to know what's coming up on the agenda of Spectre.
[00:34:33.736 --> 00:34:35.417]  That's the best way to describe it.
[00:34:35.417 --> 00:34:38.919]  The bad international private crime syndicate above governments.
[00:34:38.919 --> 00:34:42.442]  The only problem is the intelligence agencies work for Spectre.
[00:34:42.442 --> 00:34:48.006]  And they play the intelligence agencies off against the host nations and their own populations.
[00:34:48.006 --> 00:34:49.567]  That's the big mind trick.
[00:34:50.302 --> 00:34:56.224]  It isn't MI6 and the KGB, the FSB today that are fighting with each other.
[00:34:56.224 --> 00:34:58.505]  They work for Spectre, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:58.505 --> 00:35:00.325]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:35:00.325 --> 00:35:03.506]  Call it the Bilderberg Group, call it Spectre, call it whatever you want.
[00:35:03.506 --> 00:35:04.887]  It's the Global Crime Syndicate.
[00:35:04.887 --> 00:35:06.127]  It's the New World Order.
[00:35:06.127 --> 00:35:08.228]  Okay, Walt, I'll get serious here.
[00:35:08.228 --> 00:35:10.768]  Go ahead and make your point, sir.
[00:35:10.768 --> 00:35:11.489]  Okay.
[00:35:11.489 --> 00:35:12.869]  All right.
[00:35:12.869 --> 00:35:19.151]  CPS came to our house on Mother's Day and stole our six-day-old
[00:35:19.887 --> 00:35:21.969]  They'd be away from us.
[00:35:21.969 --> 00:35:23.510]  Well, you know, they've got quotas.
[00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.131]  I covered that last Thursday on the show.
[00:35:25.131 --> 00:35:26.512]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:35:26.512 --> 00:35:27.613]  They've got quotas.
[00:35:27.613 --> 00:35:29.074]  They do it outside the law.
[00:35:29.074 --> 00:35:30.735]  Tell us what happened.
[00:35:30.735 --> 00:35:47.127]  Well, what happened was there were absolute false allegations made against me concerning child custody for my wife's other two children from another husband, okay?
[00:35:49.204 --> 00:35:55.472]  We were in Florida and her sister and her mother are completely insane.
[00:35:55.472 --> 00:35:58.255]  They tried to commit suicide multiple times.
[00:35:58.255 --> 00:35:59.216]  It's documented.
[00:35:59.216 --> 00:35:59.977]  It's proven.
[00:35:59.977 --> 00:36:00.998]  See, that's the problem.
[00:36:00.998 --> 00:36:09.268]  The state uses people tattling on each other and the TV shows and the sitcoms train people to tattle on each other and do this.
[00:36:10.294 --> 00:36:21.187]  Uh, you know, the biggest culprits, the hospitals are, you know, they catch marijuana in your blood so they seize all your kids and they don't tell you that you were basically in a jail cell when you came in to have a baby and that it would all be used against you.
[00:36:21.187 --> 00:36:26.853]  Uh, or, or your child falls off the jungle gym in front of witnesses and breaks a finger.
[00:36:26.853 --> 00:36:27.514]  So they take them.
[00:36:27.514 --> 00:36:29.937]  But in the case of families ratting each other out,
[00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:37.550]  What the families don't know is when they make something up to get the children, most of the time the state doesn't give them the children to begin with.
[00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:42.431]  A lot of grandparents do this to get the kids and then they get freaked out when it doesn't happen.
[00:36:42.431 --> 00:36:43.271]  That's what it is.
[00:36:43.271 --> 00:36:46.052]  It's grandparents and the sister.
[00:36:46.052 --> 00:36:51.273]  But let me guess, let me guess, the sister and the grandkids haven't gotten the baby?
[00:36:51.273 --> 00:36:53.553]  Yeah, they got the baby now too.
[00:36:53.553 --> 00:36:55.594]  Well listen, that's better than nothing.
[00:36:55.594 --> 00:36:56.834]  Usually they don't get the baby.
[00:36:57.358 --> 00:36:58.439]  No, they got them all.
[00:36:58.439 --> 00:36:59.459]  You don't get it.
[00:36:59.459 --> 00:37:03.982]  I mean, they're horrible people, okay?
[00:37:03.982 --> 00:37:12.907]  And for them to be, for those children to be in their possession is worse than anything we could ever... Well listen, you just have to get a lawyer that's a specialist in this.
[00:37:12.907 --> 00:37:16.229]  There's some organizations... I'm here and I'm sequestering help.
[00:37:16.229 --> 00:37:19.651]  I want to hire Harry Shapiro and Patrick Clancy.
[00:37:19.651 --> 00:37:21.192]  They're two experts, okay?
[00:37:21.192 --> 00:37:22.793]  I'm flat broke.
[00:37:22.793 --> 00:37:25.255]  I'm tossthekitty at yahoo.com.
[00:37:26.076 --> 00:37:28.959]  And on MySpace, toss the key.
[00:37:28.959 --> 00:37:32.203]  I'm the one that wrote the song, 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:37:32.203 --> 00:37:34.105]  Okay?
[00:37:34.105 --> 00:37:35.807]  I have been a longtime patriot.
[00:37:36.639 --> 00:37:41.580]  I'm, I'm, you know, the only thing that I'm guilty of was leaving my wife for another woman.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.801]  I'm guilty of that.
[00:37:42.801 --> 00:37:45.402]  But I shouldn't lose my baby over this.
[00:37:45.402 --> 00:37:46.402]  And we're destroyed.
[00:37:46.402 --> 00:37:47.382]  It's destroying us.
[00:37:47.382 --> 00:37:48.522]  Well, sir, sir, you know what?
[00:37:48.522 --> 00:37:49.503]  Listen, let me stop.
[00:37:49.503 --> 00:37:49.883]  Okay.
[00:37:49.883 --> 00:37:50.843]  I appreciate your call.
[00:37:50.843 --> 00:37:51.643]  Okay.
[00:37:51.643 --> 00:37:57.405]  I can sit here and I can take 150 phone calls straight every hour of people that just had their kids taken.
[00:37:57.405 --> 00:37:58.385]  Okay.
[00:37:58.385 --> 00:38:00.066]  They take over a million children a year.
[00:38:00.066 --> 00:38:02.987]  Most of them don't even go to somebody else in the family.
[00:38:02.987 --> 00:38:03.987]  I understand that.
[00:38:04.938 --> 00:38:09.521]  I understand they wanted the other two kids, and so now they've gotten your baby.
[00:38:09.521 --> 00:38:11.683]  And I understand it's criminal and it's sick.
[00:38:11.683 --> 00:38:14.164]  You're going to have to fight it out in the courts.
[00:38:14.164 --> 00:38:17.467]  And what's got to be defeated is these fake criminal family courts.
[00:38:17.467 --> 00:38:26.773]  Everybody's heard about them, where the private adoption agencies and stuff get caught paying the judges under the table millions, and where they have actual orders for blonde-haired and blue-eyed kids.
[00:38:26.773 --> 00:38:29.535]  I had a state senator on earlier this week covering it.
[00:38:29.535 --> 00:38:30.335]  We gave your thing out.
[00:38:30.335 --> 00:38:31.336]  I'd like to help you, sir.
[00:38:34.941 --> 00:38:36.142]  I know how this operates.
[00:38:36.142 --> 00:38:38.784]  It's why I cover it every week on the show.
[00:38:38.784 --> 00:38:42.707]  But it is an innumerable amount of people that we would have to help.
[00:38:42.707 --> 00:38:45.109]  We have to change the system.
[00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:48.972]  And I know you're wanting to hire some type of specialist lawyers or something.
[00:38:48.972 --> 00:38:57.879]  You need to get with the big think tanks and websites that are experts on how to go after the criminal CPS system.
[00:38:57.879 --> 00:38:58.199]  Okay?
[00:38:58.968 --> 00:39:03.890]  And so, the way this criminal system works is it sides with whoever makes the false allegation.
[00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:07.871]  And the family courts aren't real courts, so you have trouble facing your own accuser.
[00:39:07.871 --> 00:39:09.551]  And there's no judge or jury.
[00:39:09.551 --> 00:39:16.714]  All there is is a big, fat, pedophile judge, nine times out of ten, that's sitting there getting kickbacks on money for how many kids they grab.
[00:39:16.714 --> 00:39:20.795]  And I understand your pain, and it's hard for me to sit there and listen to it, because it's very upsetting.
[00:39:20.795 --> 00:39:22.776]  That's why I cover it on the show every week.
[00:39:22.776 --> 00:39:24.676]  But all I can do is give out info.
[00:39:24.676 --> 00:39:27.297]  We're almost powerless when it comes to helping individuals.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.221]  We've got to change the system.
[00:39:30.221 --> 00:39:37.265]  And if people wake up universally and realize what a criminal racket the family court system is, then we can start changing it.
[00:39:37.265 --> 00:39:38.706]  Let's talk to Stephen in Texas.
[00:39:38.706 --> 00:39:40.187]  Stephen, you're on the air.
[00:39:40.187 --> 00:39:41.768]  Go ahead.
[00:39:41.768 --> 00:39:44.210]  Yeah, hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:46.391]  First of all, two things I want to cover real quick.
[00:39:46.391 --> 00:39:47.852]  First of all, about the Boy Scouts.
[00:39:49.179 --> 00:40:07.651]  I was in the Boy Scouts for years, and I consider it no coincidence that now what you're bringing out about the Boy Scouts, and what you brought out about Hitler's youth brigades, that our beloved Governor Rick Perry not long ago came out with a book promoting the Boy Scouts.
[00:40:08.471 --> 00:40:21.004]  So, I don't consider that he was defending them against, like, the homosexuals who were trying to infiltrate him, but I see this as a deeper agenda, where it's no coincidence that, you know, just not too long ago he came out of this book.
[00:40:21.004 --> 00:40:23.827]  In other words, to give a positive spin on the Boy Scouts,
[00:40:24.627 --> 00:40:27.688]  In the direction they're going now, you see what I'm getting at?
[00:40:27.688 --> 00:40:36.510]  No, and again, the Boy Scouts admittedly were set up to train youth for military induction and for camping and preparation.
[00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:39.051]  They admit that, and that's fine and dandy.
[00:40:39.051 --> 00:40:43.072]  But what Hitler did in 1933 is they had the German Boy Scouts.
[00:40:43.072 --> 00:40:45.692]  That was the kinder folk.
[00:40:45.692 --> 00:40:48.773]  And this is mainline history for those that don't know.
[00:40:48.773 --> 00:40:50.314]  And I appreciate your call, it's a fine point.
[00:40:50.314 --> 00:40:51.914]  I'm going to start getting into that in the next segment.
[00:40:53.427 --> 00:40:58.850]  And they took over the Boy Scouts, and at first had it just normal Boy Scouts, and then turned it into paramilitary training.
[00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:07.133]  And then they set up the Hitlerjugend out of that, and just a few years later, those 12, 13, 14, 15 year olds, in 1913, I mean in 1933, by 1940, 1941, 42, with the war raging, you know, they were now 20, 21, 22 years old, and were fully indoctrinated.
[00:41:07.133 --> 00:41:11.095]  And that's what this is all about, and that is what is happening here.
[00:41:21.758 --> 00:41:24.540]  You know, torture, secret arrest, youth brigades.
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:27.182]  But ladies and gentlemen, it's not just that.
[00:41:27.182 --> 00:41:32.066]  We now know what the global uniform is for these youth.
[00:41:32.066 --> 00:41:37.690]  And Barack Obama has released a Secure Corps video with them doing military drills.
[00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:40.392]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is off the charts.
[00:41:40.392 --> 00:41:42.454]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:41:42.454 --> 00:41:43.315]  You can see it right now.
[00:41:43.315 --> 00:41:46.017]  We're going to play the audio coming up in the next segment when I detail all of this.
[00:41:46.767 --> 00:41:48.267]  George in Texas.
[00:41:48.267 --> 00:42:08.412]  Oh, by the way, to Walt who called earlier, Walt, send an email to robd at Infowars.com with all the facts of the case written out because just to come on here and kind of talk about what happened to you or to start naming people in an extended family, you know, I need to see the documentation first.
[00:42:08.412 --> 00:42:12.113]  I need to consider you for being a guest on the show.
[00:42:12.113 --> 00:42:16.214]  That's how we do that when we do shows on the CPS because it's a very
[00:42:16.638 --> 00:42:19.739]  Very, very serious situation.
[00:42:19.739 --> 00:42:21.820]  Okay, so I appreciate your call.
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:24.481]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Texas.
[00:42:24.481 --> 00:42:25.661]  George, go ahead.
[00:42:25.661 --> 00:42:26.441]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[00:42:26.441 --> 00:42:27.582]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:42:27.582 --> 00:42:28.422]  Thank you.
[00:42:28.422 --> 00:42:40.286]  You know, the thing is, I talked to a few military, and you know the thing is, I started to find out that a lot of the children being taken are from fathers that are deployed overseas, and they're not there to protect their homes.
[00:42:40.286 --> 00:42:43.307]  Yes, the CPS does take a lot of the military's children.
[00:42:44.445 --> 00:42:47.066]  Uh, and the government recruiting arms are doing a lot of that.
[00:42:47.066 --> 00:42:54.329]  No, this is all... Folks, they make the troops pay for plane tickets in their back home and their meals when they're in hospitals.
[00:42:54.329 --> 00:42:59.431]  This government is degenerate, but they wrap themselves in the flag and say, we're patriotic.
[00:42:59.431 --> 00:43:02.552]  Go along with the police state or you don't like the police and military.
[00:43:02.552 --> 00:43:06.374]  Police and military, you are dog meat to the New World Order.
[00:43:06.374 --> 00:43:08.855]  Henry Kissinger wrote a book calling you dumb animals.
[00:43:11.446 --> 00:43:12.467]  Yes, Mark.
[00:43:12.467 --> 00:43:13.628]  Alex, can I ask you one more thing?
[00:43:13.628 --> 00:43:15.989]  When are you going to get Mark Kornke on again?
[00:43:15.989 --> 00:43:18.491]  You know, I might get Mark on sometime.
[00:43:18.491 --> 00:43:19.771]  You know, we've had Mark on before.
[00:43:19.771 --> 00:43:22.113]  He hasn't invited me on his show, though.
[00:43:22.113 --> 00:43:27.516]  Listen, we're going to go ahead and go to break and come back with more phone calls.
[00:43:27.516 --> 00:43:31.859]  And I've always defended Mark, and then one day I heard him on the air with some caller, horrible guy saying things about me.
[00:43:31.859 --> 00:43:38.063]  He didn't really defend me, so I've kind of gotten... How would you like to finally be debt-free without paying another cent to creditors?
[00:43:40.814 --> 00:43:41.795]  We're good to go.

[00:46:33.749 --> 00:46:36.189]  Americans, do you know where your food comes from?
[00:46:36.189 --> 00:46:38.130]  Is it safe, secure, and healthy?
[00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:42.592]  Did you know most of our food is not contaminated with genetically modified ingredients?
[00:46:42.592 --> 00:46:50.915]  We at Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company have been helping people get pure garden seed for 12 years and carry over 1,200 varieties of GMO-free heirloom seed.

[00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:02.544]  Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company was started in 1998 by a 17-year-old as a hobby.
[00:47:02.544 --> 00:47:06.187]  It was developed out of a passion for preserving our vegetable heritage.
[00:47:06.187 --> 00:47:12.952]  The company now offers the largest selection of pure heirloom seeds strived every year to bring back varieties like our forefathers grew.

[00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:38.082]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[00:47:38.082 --> 00:47:39.583]  Search no more.
[00:47:39.583 --> 00:47:42.567]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:47.321 --> 00:47:57.784]  Yeah, we're shouting at the devil, saying, hey Obama, you said you were going to stop the torture and the secret arrest and no more indefinite detention and rights for detainees.
[00:47:57.784 --> 00:47:59.645]  Now you've gone back on all of that.
[00:47:59.645 --> 00:48:05.566]  There's all these idiots that say, they're Al-Qaeda, they can't have rights.
[00:48:05.566 --> 00:48:08.927]  You know they're now saying in all the big court cases that U.S.
[00:48:08.927 --> 00:48:10.588]  citizens don't have rights and they're going to use
[00:48:11.118 --> 00:48:19.866]  And are using all the anti-terror laws, the American people, and all the major training manuals are about gun owners, conservatives, and veterans, dummies.
[00:48:19.866 --> 00:48:27.072]  They get you sold on it for foreign cave dwellers and saying, yeah, take them, you know, Arab's rights.
[00:48:27.072 --> 00:48:28.113]  They're not Arabs.
[00:48:28.113 --> 00:48:30.596]  They live in Central Asia.
[00:48:30.596 --> 00:48:32.738]  Take their rights when it's really for you.
[00:48:32.738 --> 00:48:35.840]  Those Central Asians work for the CIA.
[00:48:37.577 --> 00:48:39.819]  Against the Serbs, against the Russians.
[00:48:39.819 --> 00:48:41.060]  You were set up.
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:44.622]  You were the targets, dumb-dumbs.
[00:48:44.622 --> 00:48:51.087]  The free market, our free society, our private property was the target.
[00:48:51.087 --> 00:48:51.868]  Look at these headlines.
[00:48:51.868 --> 00:48:54.810]  AmeriCorps, paramilitary propaganda ad.
[00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:57.892]  Wait till you hear the audio from this and the video is even more incredible.
[00:49:00.186 --> 00:49:04.108]  Obama continues torture and torture-related murder in the bogus War on Terror.
[00:49:04.108 --> 00:49:09.130]  Another story by Kurt Nemo up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:13.391]  And Bilderberg wants global Department of Health and global Treasury Department.
[00:49:13.391 --> 00:49:17.593]  We're going to go over all of this coming up in the next hour.
[00:49:17.593 --> 00:49:21.894]  But right now, back to the phone calls.
[00:49:21.894 --> 00:49:24.595]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt.
[00:49:24.595 --> 00:49:25.736]  And Matt, where are you calling us from?
[00:49:28.226 --> 00:49:29.247]  Hey Alex, can you hear me okay?
[00:49:29.247 --> 00:49:30.488]  Yeah, where are you calling us from?
[00:49:30.488 --> 00:49:32.310]  Missouri, sir.
[00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:34.271]  Okay, welcome to the Airwaves.
[00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:35.332]  Yeah, thank you.
[00:49:35.332 --> 00:49:44.440]  I'd like to read you two passages that describe everything that you do and what we all need to do in our fight against evil in the New World Order.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.904]  And the first one here is Ephesians 6, verse 10, Armor of God.
[00:49:49.733 --> 00:49:53.814]  Finally, be strong in the Lord and His mighty power.
[00:49:53.814 --> 00:49:59.995]  Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
[00:49:59.995 --> 00:50:11.398]  For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against authorities, against the powers of darkness world, and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
[00:50:11.678 --> 00:50:13.279]  Now, how does that combine with Romans 13?
[00:50:13.279 --> 00:50:17.741]  They take out of context and say, all governments of God do whatever it says.
[00:50:17.741 --> 00:50:21.143]  Then the founding fathers were wrong to rebel against King George III.
[00:50:21.143 --> 00:50:23.644]  We were wrong in the 40s to rebel against Hitler.
[00:50:23.644 --> 00:50:25.965]  We were wrong to rebel against Napoleon.
[00:50:25.965 --> 00:50:31.008]  You should... But no, the entire Bible is about standing up against wicked government.
[00:50:31.008 --> 00:50:32.809]  Again, give folks that famous verse again.
[00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:51.790]  Ephesians 6 verse 10 and another one that describes why we need to fight these people and why they're in the positions that they are and why they worship Lucifer would be Luke 4 verses 5 which I'm sure you've heard before and this is when Christ is being tempted in the wilderness.
[00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:53.331]  The devil leads him up.
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:11.160]  Hail Satan!
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.141]  Hail Satan!
[00:51:12.141 --> 00:51:13.301]  Hail Satan!
[00:51:13.301 --> 00:51:17.663]  All the Baptists and all the Catholics all hit their knees under Romans 13.
[00:51:17.663 --> 00:51:22.944]  The favorite verse taught everywhere as the federal government takes over all the major denominations.
[00:51:22.944 --> 00:51:24.105]  Hail Satan!
[00:51:24.105 --> 00:51:25.425]  Hail Satan!
[00:51:25.425 --> 00:51:26.986]  No, don't shout at the devil.
[00:51:26.986 --> 00:51:29.507]  Worship the devil because it's of the Lord.
[00:51:29.507 --> 00:51:32.588]  He's the God of this world.
[00:51:32.588 --> 00:51:35.809]  And nothing bites like I do.
[00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:39.590]  Nothing screams out loud in the dark of night.
[00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:40.590]  I'm sorry, sir.
[00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:41.031]  Go ahead.
[00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:43.352]  Absolutely.
[00:51:43.352 --> 00:51:54.698]  It says over and over in the Bible how, uh, that Satan is the prince of this world and, uh, he can give, uh, you know, these people a bad... And it's up to the Lord to bow down to the government.
[00:51:54.698 --> 00:51:58.040]  No, it's the good Lord and they don't listen.
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.221]  Uh, don't listen to the caller people.
[00:52:00.641 --> 00:52:04.883]  No, no, no, it's don't rebel against government, you'll go to hell if you do.
[00:52:04.883 --> 00:52:10.887]  The Christians, the Christians were evil that didn't bow to Caesar that he burned at the stake in the Coliseum.
[00:52:10.887 --> 00:52:12.067]  They were bad!
[00:52:12.067 --> 00:52:13.588]  Don't listen!
[00:52:13.588 --> 00:52:15.069]  Okay, I'll quit being sarcastic.
[00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.429]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:20.561]  If I could, I'll just finish Ephesians 6.
[00:52:20.561 --> 00:52:21.522]  No!
[00:52:21.522 --> 00:52:21.862]  No!
[00:52:21.862 --> 00:52:22.642]  Don't read it!
[00:52:22.642 --> 00:52:24.022]  It's evil!
[00:52:24.022 --> 00:52:25.163]  Bible verses are evil!
[00:52:25.163 --> 00:52:26.643]  The government says don't read it!
[00:52:26.643 --> 00:52:28.444]  You've got to follow what the government says!
[00:52:28.444 --> 00:52:29.724]  Romans 13, don't!
[00:52:29.724 --> 00:52:30.224]  Don't!
[00:52:30.224 --> 00:52:35.446]  Go ahead and read both verses, the earlier Ephesians and the next one, because I've been interrupting.
[00:52:36.092 --> 00:52:37.373]  You want me to start over?
[00:52:37.373 --> 00:52:38.333]  Start over, yes.
[00:52:38.333 --> 00:52:43.356]  Start over with the blasphemy according to the government-run churches that say bow down to government.
[00:52:43.356 --> 00:52:53.522]  This is blasphemy and heresy you're all about to hear right now because the church has turned into a government-paid operation and that is of the Lord.
[00:52:53.522 --> 00:52:55.963]  This caller is evil that's calling in.
[00:52:55.963 --> 00:52:57.404]  Go ahead, evil caller.
[00:52:57.404 --> 00:53:02.347]  Okay, be strong in the Lord and His mighty power.
[00:53:02.347 --> 00:53:04.248]  Put on the full armor of God for evil.
[00:53:04.944 --> 00:53:05.304]  Day of evil?
[00:53:05.304 --> 00:53:06.044]  I'm gonna be raptured!
[00:53:29.489 --> 00:53:31.790]  I don't have to fight evil.
[00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:35.511]  Of course, there's nowhere in the Bible that there'll be a pre-rapture, but so what?
[00:53:35.511 --> 00:53:36.771]  I'm supposed to lay down?
[00:53:36.771 --> 00:53:38.531]  Stop reading that Bible!
[00:53:38.531 --> 00:53:39.992]  It's evil!
[00:53:39.992 --> 00:53:43.152]  The churches say that we should bow down to the leaders of the world.
[00:53:43.152 --> 00:53:45.653]  Continue, heretic!
[00:53:45.653 --> 00:53:50.634]  Stand firm, then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist.
[00:53:50.634 --> 00:53:52.134]  Breastplate of righteousness.
[00:53:52.134 --> 00:53:53.695]  No!
[00:53:53.695 --> 00:53:57.236]  Stand with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes with the gospel of peace.
[00:53:59.364 --> 00:54:00.705]  No, no, don't do it!
[00:54:00.705 --> 00:54:01.866]  Romans 13!
[00:54:01.866 --> 00:54:03.007]  Submit to the government!
[00:54:03.007 --> 00:54:03.808]  Do what they say!
[00:54:03.808 --> 00:54:06.350]  Don't listen to Matt!
[00:54:19.745 --> 00:54:22.467]  And the devil, and this is Luke 4, verse 5.
[00:54:22.467 --> 00:54:25.029]  Oh, not another one!
[00:54:25.029 --> 00:54:26.290]  Go ahead.
[00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:30.973]  The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world.
[00:54:30.973 --> 00:54:40.641]  And he said to him, I will give you all the authority and splendor for it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone who I want.
[00:54:40.641 --> 00:54:46.565]  So if you worship me, it shall all be yours.
[00:54:46.565 --> 00:54:47.866]  Why not turn this bread into
[00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:51.625]  The stones and the bread, why not jump off and have the angels lift you up?
[00:54:53.106 --> 00:54:54.686]  Do not tempt the Lord thy God.
[00:54:54.686 --> 00:54:55.887]  Get behind me, Satan.
[00:54:55.887 --> 00:55:02.268]  But see, according to Romans 13 misinterpretation, he should have hit his knees and said, all government is by the authority of God.
[00:55:02.268 --> 00:55:05.508]  Hence, he should have hit his knees and Jesus should have hailed Satan.
[00:55:05.508 --> 00:55:09.389]  But see, that's how blasphemous Romans 13 is if you're a Christian.
[00:55:09.389 --> 00:55:19.891]  But even if you're not a Christian, folks, just a sociologist, you understand that all the major churches of the world are now under government finance, government payoffs, or government 501c3 status.
[00:55:21.884 --> 00:55:35.821]  And they literally get up there and spew under the clergy response teams pure government propaganda when the First Amendment says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:55:35.821 --> 00:55:41.908]  We were the first country to say the government isn't going to run religion, which is exactly what Jesus said.
[00:55:42.529 --> 00:55:44.430]  So they twist all of this.
[00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:45.491]  I appreciate your call.
[00:55:45.491 --> 00:55:47.272]  It's good to hear from you, my friend.
[00:55:47.272 --> 00:55:49.774]  And of course, I'm being sarcastic through all of that.
[00:55:49.774 --> 00:55:56.799]  I mean, to say that we should go along with whatever government says is a giant, stinking lie.
[00:55:56.799 --> 00:55:58.761]  Look at the Christians in Rome and the Colosseum.
[00:55:58.761 --> 00:56:01.182]  Look at all the prophets being killed or imprisoned.
[00:56:01.182 --> 00:56:02.704]  Look at Jesus.
[00:56:02.704 --> 00:56:06.526]  But again, the salt of the earth, Christians are supposed to be involved.
[00:56:06.526 --> 00:56:08.608]  You know, the government said slavery was the law.
[00:56:09.788 --> 00:56:16.211]  In 1800, and Christians with the abolitionists wouldn't go along with it, and they broke the law to save blacks and others.
[00:56:16.211 --> 00:56:27.697]  They broke the law, you know, when it was illegal to protect slaves, and they went and said no to the government, we're going to change this, but not according to Romans 13, we should still have blacks pulling plows out there right now.
[00:56:27.697 --> 00:56:37.561]  This is how sick you are that go to these devil churches with their big mollick steeples and their phalluses to, you know, to the sun out there.
[00:56:37.561 --> 00:56:38.742]  Just go worship your sun.
[00:56:39.551 --> 00:56:41.392]  You're 666.
[00:56:41.392 --> 00:56:44.294]  He who has understanding, let him reckon the number.
[00:56:44.294 --> 00:56:46.055]  Captain Cook.
[00:56:46.055 --> 00:56:54.220]  Captain Cook, did you sail and discover the Botany Bay there, Captain?
[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:55.260]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:56.281]  Go ahead.
[00:56:56.281 --> 00:57:04.686]  Actually, sir, that's Captain Cook, America's politically incorrect superhero, and... ...fighting the New World Order since 1989.
[00:57:06.647 --> 00:57:19.196]  I just wanted to say that, you know, Archie Bunker, being portrayed as a bad guy when really he's the good guy, is just a small sample of the cancer that started back in the 70s and has worked its way up to being a big cancer.
[00:57:19.196 --> 00:57:21.738]  No, the government's good.
[00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:23.059]  Oh, please.
[00:57:23.059 --> 00:57:25.221]  Sir, you want to be damned to hell?
[00:57:25.221 --> 00:57:28.023]  You better worship government, boy, or you'll lose your salvation!
[00:57:28.023 --> 00:57:31.526]  I know, I'm Al Qaeda, you know, what can I say?
[00:57:31.526 --> 00:57:33.007]  I think the government's
[00:57:34.193 --> 00:57:35.854]  A bunch of rogue criminals.
[00:57:35.854 --> 00:57:39.616]  Oh no, don't say it!
[00:57:39.616 --> 00:57:40.917]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:57:40.917 --> 00:57:42.478]  No, it's okay.
[00:57:42.478 --> 00:57:44.499]  No, I think the government's a bunch of rogue criminals.
[00:57:44.499 --> 00:57:45.640]  No, I don't think it, Alex.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:46.860]  I know it.
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:49.102]  I think what we call television nowadays is a...
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:51.401]  Great waste of time.
[00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:52.842]  No, it's good for your brain.
[00:57:52.842 --> 00:58:00.046]  Don't Google television... television Alzheimer's with all the thousands of studies that it literally rots your brain.
[00:58:00.046 --> 00:58:00.506]  It's good.
[00:58:00.506 --> 00:58:01.287]  Watch more.
[00:58:01.287 --> 00:58:02.788]  Drink more fluoride water.
[00:58:02.788 --> 00:58:04.369]  Take more flu shots.
[00:58:04.369 --> 00:58:05.229]  No.
[00:58:05.229 --> 00:58:06.330]  No, Captain Kook.
[00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:08.011]  You are a kook.
[00:58:08.011 --> 00:58:09.712]  Turn your firearms in.
[00:58:09.712 --> 00:58:14.035]  The Founding Fathers were against firearms.
[00:58:14.035 --> 00:58:16.256]  Anything else, Captain Crunch or Kook or whatever your name is?
[00:58:17.082 --> 00:58:22.327]  Captain Cooke, uh, what do you call a direct superhero that's... Well, your phone's cutting out, Captain Cooke.
[00:58:22.327 --> 00:58:23.688]  We'll be right back with the next hour.
[00:58:23.688 --> 00:58:24.109]  Stay with me.
[00:58:24.867 --> 00:58:28.948]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson introducing a new way to listen to GCN on your cell phone.

[00:58:53.826 --> 00:59:03.152]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:59:03.152 --> 00:59:03.953]  This capitalism?
[00:59:03.953 --> 00:59:10.217]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:59:10.217 --> 00:59:11.018]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:59:11.018 --> 00:59:14.180]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:59:29.408 --> 00:59:34.450]  Have you ever noticed that celebrities are endorsing weight loss products and health aids?
[00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:38.272]  Do you think they endorse these products for free?
[00:59:38.272 --> 00:59:39.252]  I don't think so.
[00:59:39.252 --> 00:59:43.314]  I'm here to tell you, I'm not a celebrity and Life Change T doesn't need one.
[00:59:43.314 --> 00:59:44.154]  Think about this.
[00:59:44.554 --> 00:59:47.155]  The product speaks for itself!
[00:59:47.155 --> 00:59:48.736]  What a concept!

[00:59:55.299 --> 00:59:55.760]  Order now.

[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:56.880]  Write this down.
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:56.920]  928-308-0408.
[01:00:04.844 --> 01:00:06.105]  Or you can order online.
[01:00:06.105 --> 01:00:06.886]  It's easy.

[01:00:08.587 --> 01:00:11.088]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[01:00:11.088 --> 01:00:16.712]  You have nothing to lose, but the excess around your, uh, anyway.
[01:00:16.712 --> 01:00:17.713]  Life Change Tea.
[01:00:17.713 --> 01:00:19.234]  It speaks for itself.
[01:00:19.234 --> 01:00:21.235]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[01:00:24.113 --> 01:00:26.878]  And the city of San Marcos implements new rules.
[01:00:26.878 --> 01:00:29.562]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:29.562 --> 01:00:31.846]  Home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[01:00:31.846 --> 01:00:35.952]  Radio 590 KLBJ Austin.
[01:00:35.952 --> 01:00:37.415]  Fox News Radio.
[01:00:37.415 --> 01:00:38.156]  I'm Ron Flatter.
[01:00:40.177 --> 01:00:44.440]  Pomp and circumstance, caps and gowns, protests and arrests.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:50.345]  The scene at the University of Notre Dame today, where President Obama became a lightning rod just for being there.
[01:00:50.345 --> 01:00:53.728]  The bones of contention, abortion and stem cell research.
[01:00:53.728 --> 01:00:55.990]  We get this live report from South Bend, Indiana.
[01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:57.491]  Fox News Radio's Jennifer Kuiper.
[01:00:58.365 --> 01:01:06.432]  Ron, the president jokes about one controversial issue, honorary degrees, saying he's only one for two as president, but a more serious tone on the subject of abortion.
[01:01:06.432 --> 01:01:17.701]  When we open up our hearts and our minds to those who may not think precisely like we do or believe precisely what we believe, that's when we discover at least the possibility.
[01:01:19.475 --> 01:01:21.716]  He also mentioned embryonic stem cell research.
[01:01:21.716 --> 01:01:26.638]  Some non-student hecklers in the crowd were quickly escorted out of the Joyce Center Arena.
[01:01:26.638 --> 01:01:29.959]  A couple dozen protesters have been arrested on campus for trespassing.
[01:01:29.959 --> 01:01:30.680]  Ron?
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:39.823]  A call for President Obama to reconsider his plans to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, especially if it means moving terror suspects where they're not wanted.
[01:01:39.823 --> 01:01:45.325]  It's been a position stated by some of the administration that there's no problem incarcerating terrorists here.
[01:01:45.325 --> 01:01:46.046]  It is a problem.
[01:01:46.046 --> 01:01:47.346]  It makes whatever town that has
[01:01:47.366 --> 01:01:50.867]  As a terrorist, a potential target for a terrorist.
[01:01:50.867 --> 01:01:54.049]  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Fox News Sunday.
[01:01:54.049 --> 01:01:59.771]  Democratic Congressman Peter King of New York concedes the shutdown of Guantanamo should at least wait.
[01:01:59.771 --> 01:02:00.791]  There's going to be other cases.
[01:02:00.791 --> 01:02:02.292]  I don't even know if the tribunals are working.
[01:02:02.292 --> 01:02:13.896]  That's why the reports coming out of the administration, there could be up to 50 of these detainees who are very violent, very dangerous, but there may not be enough evidence and the government may be looking for a form of preventive detention.
[01:02:14.665 --> 01:02:16.886]  King today on CBS's Face the Nation.
[01:02:16.886 --> 01:02:22.568]  Attorney General Eric Holder last week said dangerous prisoners would not be released in the United States.
[01:02:22.568 --> 01:02:26.909]  The price of gasoline rising 25 cents a gallon the past three weeks.
[01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:31.110]  The Lundberg survey saying unleaded averaging $2.30 a gallon nationwide.
[01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:32.971]  You're listening to Fox News Radio.
[01:02:32.971 --> 01:02:37.052]  Fair and balanced.
[01:02:37.052 --> 01:02:38.573]  News Radio 590.
[01:02:38.573 --> 01:02:40.613]  KLVJ, it's 502.
[01:02:40.613 --> 01:02:43.094]  I'm Sarah Huderberg, topping Austin's news.
[01:02:43.519 --> 01:02:53.726]  Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo tells East Austin residents during a community meeting that the department continues to investigate Monday's police-involved fatal shooting of an 18-year-old.
[01:02:53.726 --> 01:03:01.892]  Officer Lenny Contano was the shooter in the incident, saying the two men, Nathaniel Saunders and Sir Smith, made threatening moves toward him.
[01:03:01.892 --> 01:03:05.294]  However, he did not turn on his dash cam video at the scene.
[01:03:05.294 --> 01:03:10.297]  Chief Acevedo says he is taking that into consideration during the ongoing investigation.
[01:03:10.297 --> 01:03:12.499]  Maybe he screwed up completely, maybe he didn't.
[01:03:13.308 --> 01:03:16.130]  I can tell you that he screwed up with that camera.
[01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:18.171]  I wasn't on and I got a problem with that.
[01:03:18.171 --> 01:03:22.433]  Chief Acevedo says the investigation will take between 60 to 90 days.
[01:03:22.433 --> 01:03:24.694]  Emily Trudeau, News Radio 590, KLBJ.
[01:03:24.694 --> 01:03:29.237]  The city of San Marcos is implementing new rules for noise in their city's neighborhoods.
[01:03:29.237 --> 01:03:35.740]  Assistant Police Chief Lisa Dvorak says the new rules are a response to 2,700 noise complaints last year.
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:37.361]  You're going to have a gathering.
[01:03:37.361 --> 01:03:38.742]  There are things that you can do.
[01:03:39.281 --> 01:03:46.663]  To keep the noise down and still have a really great time and have your friends over and enjoy being able to socialize and have people at your house.
[01:03:46.663 --> 01:03:54.926]  Dvorak says the new rules allow officers to use their judgment about whether the level of noise at neighborhood parties or gatherings is excessive.
[01:03:54.926 --> 01:04:00.567]  Some federal tax hikes under consideration are raising the ire of the chairman of the Texas Workforce Commission.
[01:04:00.567 --> 01:04:03.808]  Tom Paulkin is calling the proposed tax hikes on the U.S.
[01:04:03.808 --> 01:04:06.549]  energy industry a job killer for Texas.
[01:04:07.096 --> 01:04:19.681]  More than 100,000 Texans are currently employed in energy-related fields as oil and gas extraction, petroleum and coal products manufacturing, along with pipeline transportation.
[01:04:19.681 --> 01:04:27.704]  Hawkins says the energy industry can help lead Texas out of the economic recession, but not if taxes are raised that push those employers out of business.
[01:04:28.184 --> 01:04:30.745]  Diane Hodges, NewsRadio 590, KLBJ.
[01:04:30.745 --> 01:04:35.325]  The KLBJ radar weather watch calls for lows dropping to 54 tonight.
[01:04:35.325 --> 01:04:37.186]  Right now, 75 degrees.
[01:04:37.186 --> 01:04:38.546]  I'm Sarah Hudeberg.
[01:04:38.546 --> 01:04:41.047]  KLBJ NewsTime is 504.
[01:04:41.047 --> 01:04:44.147]  Through the rest of the day, we'll continue with clouds in 77.
[01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:49.788]  Tonight, clear 54.
[01:04:49.788 --> 01:04:52.689]  Belly up to the bar, and let's talk!
[01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:55.029]  Jeff Ward, 3 to 7, on NewsRadio 590, KLBJ.
[01:04:59.667 --> 01:05:00.968]  Did you request electronic payments?
[01:05:00.968 --> 01:05:02.449]  If not, you should.
[01:05:02.449 --> 01:05:06.813]  For years, writing checks was considered the safest way to send and receive payments.
[01:05:06.813 --> 01:05:11.756]  But every check you write has your name, address, and account number printed right on it.
[01:05:11.756 --> 01:05:19.963]  With an average of eight people touching your checks during the clearing process and identity theft on the rise, it's time to reconsider the way you pay and get paid.
[01:05:20.223 --> 01:05:23.245]  Direct deposit and direct payment are safe and reliable.
[01:05:23.245 --> 01:05:28.729]  Payments are made automatically on a predetermined date and flow through a secure encrypted network.
[01:05:28.729 --> 01:05:30.770]  And they're environmentally friendly too.
[01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:32.492]  Ask for direct deposit at work.
[01:05:32.492 --> 01:05:39.356]  If it's not currently offered... HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide to better serve our customers.

[01:05:47.602 --> 01:05:47.822]  I think so.

[01:06:21.541 --> 01:06:25.623]  Ask yourself, why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the US?
[01:06:25.623 --> 01:06:28.143]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[01:06:28.143 --> 01:06:29.404]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.

[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:52.821]  He stands for what's right.
[01:06:52.821 --> 01:06:56.104]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[01:07:04.483 --> 01:07:15.831]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:19.874]  All right, this is going to be a very serious second hour.
[01:07:19.874 --> 01:07:22.236]  We'll continue to focus on your phone calls at 877-590-5525.
[01:07:22.236 --> 01:07:22.276]  877-590-5525.
[01:07:30.211 --> 01:07:34.294]  And again, the Bilderberg Group and what their agenda, we've learned more over the weekend.
[01:07:34.294 --> 01:07:39.599]  From Greece, suburb of Athens, they're on the coastline, where the world leaders met.
[01:07:39.599 --> 01:07:42.882]  We'll give you the boil-down of that.
[01:07:42.882 --> 01:07:52.890]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, don't forget my websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:55.952]  PrisonPlanet.tv is our member site.
[01:07:55.952 --> 01:07:59.015]  And with five years up and running, all of my films
[01:07:59.611 --> 01:08:08.858]  And then, of course, we simulcast with my live TV show during the slash radio show during a weekday transmission.
[01:08:08.858 --> 01:08:20.687]  And my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other films are posted there at PrisonPlanet.TV and your PrisonPlanet.TV membership also makes much of what we do here in my media organization possible.
[01:08:20.687 --> 01:08:23.909]  So I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.TV members out there.
[01:08:23.909 --> 01:08:26.271]  Also, I'm going to start every month churning out
[01:08:28.524 --> 01:08:31.486]  DVDs that are more presentations, not films.
[01:08:31.486 --> 01:08:34.908]  I'm gonna try to make three films a year instead of two films a year.
[01:08:34.908 --> 01:08:43.034]  And every month or two, probably stagger it, I'd say every five, six weeks on average, a presentation.
[01:08:43.034 --> 01:08:47.117]  And one of those is the Aaron Russo interview I did shortly before he died in 2007.
[01:08:47.117 --> 01:08:51.740]  The last videotaped interview that we know of that's out there.
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.781]  Most of it's on the web for free, we put it out.
[01:08:53.781 --> 01:08:57.564]  But this is an updated version with some commentary by myself.
[01:08:57.944 --> 01:09:02.967]  With the latest developments and some of the interview that we didn't put out on the internet.
[01:09:02.967 --> 01:09:07.710]  That is now available on DVD at InfoWars.com and everybody's library needs to have it.
[01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:20.519]  Also, every month we're going to have a Best Of from the TV show we do while we simulcast the radio show with the ads cut out and any extra stuff cut out, shot in high def, burned to one high quality DVD.
[01:09:20.519 --> 01:09:25.562]  This month's has Alan Watt, Police Chief in Austin, Art Acevedo.
[01:09:26.464 --> 01:09:34.710]  Of course, the UFC host and movie star and TV host in his own right, Joe Rogan.
[01:09:34.710 --> 01:09:40.234]  It's got folks in it like Mr. David Icke and a lot more.
[01:09:40.234 --> 01:09:42.616]  So the first month of that is now out.
[01:09:42.616 --> 01:09:44.317]  I'm going to have a best of every month.
[01:09:44.317 --> 01:09:46.098]  We call it the DVD Arsenal.
[01:09:46.098 --> 01:09:52.142]  Also available there at the online video and bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:52.142 --> 01:09:53.323]  Okay.
[01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:55.124]  Let me just stop right there and get focused.
[01:09:56.391 --> 01:10:03.794]  I tend to psychologically shy away from getting into this because it's such an upsetting subject and so real.
[01:10:03.794 --> 01:10:12.198]  I want to start out with the audio of the one minute government paid for video that we have up on InfoWars.com.
[01:10:12.198 --> 01:10:17.861]  This is AmeriCorps paramilitary propaganda ad.
[01:10:17.861 --> 01:10:21.822]  And when you watch this ad and you study it, it's absolutely horrifying.
[01:10:21.822 --> 01:10:25.324]  When you have the background knowledge of what you're witnessing, it's even more horrifying
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:32.062]  But anybody can watch this and say, what is this straight out of Soviet Russia or Communist China?
[01:10:32.062 --> 01:10:35.263]  I would say it's more into Communist China or Cuba.
[01:10:35.263 --> 01:10:36.823]  Communist Cuba.
[01:10:36.823 --> 01:10:43.965]  Now this uniform they're wearing, I saw different bills Bill Clinton got passed to start this in 1997.
[01:10:43.965 --> 01:10:47.186]  I talked about it in my film Police State 2000 in 1998. 99.
[01:10:52.156 --> 01:10:58.060]  But in some of the legislation they've passed, it says grey uniforms, and we have seen those.
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:03.964]  And that's going to be for more of the paramilitaries, more of the cream of the youth corps.
[01:11:03.964 --> 01:11:13.310]  Then the next category are going to wear red jackets with khaki shirts and khaki pants.
[01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:17.673]  That looks like something out of a science fiction dystopia.
[01:11:19.028 --> 01:11:20.628]  And I know this because in the U.S.
[01:11:20.628 --> 01:11:22.669]  we first learned of this about seven, eight years ago.
[01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:24.849]  In England we learned of this two years ago.
[01:11:24.849 --> 01:11:30.311]  They're also doing it in Japan, in Germany, in the Netherlands, in Ireland.
[01:11:30.311 --> 01:11:35.152]  And they're doing it with the Boy Scouts overseas, the Boy Scouts here.
[01:11:35.152 --> 01:11:38.673]  They're doing it with Secure Corps, Division of AmeriCorps.
[01:11:38.673 --> 01:11:47.255]  They're doing it with public school children, putting them in uniforms, but only
[01:11:47.813 --> 01:11:55.559]  You know, on the weekends when they take part in federally funded, under BATF, FBI grants, you name it.
[01:11:55.559 --> 01:12:14.072]  And so when I saw this video this morning put out by the federal government with taxpayer money, it shows them doing push-ups and squat thrust and, you know, basic military maneuvers out in a military training field with officers in front of them in their new fascist uniforms with arm patches, arm bands.
[01:12:14.072 --> 01:12:15.673]  I mean, it doesn't get any worse than this.
[01:12:16.796 --> 01:12:21.519]  And it horrified me because I keep seeing this same uniform pop up worldwide.
[01:12:21.519 --> 01:12:22.820]  This is global.
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:26.543]  So ladies and gentlemen, here is the audio of the video.
[01:12:26.543 --> 01:12:37.730]  I am change.
[01:12:37.730 --> 01:12:43.374]  I've been around since the beginning of time.
[01:12:43.374 --> 01:12:45.035]  Over the years I've had many faces.
[01:12:46.531 --> 01:12:52.613]  Over the years, I've had many looks.
[01:12:52.613 --> 01:12:55.054]  But, I've always had the same goals.
[01:12:55.054 --> 01:13:01.596]  To make this world a better place by helping those who need it most.
[01:13:01.596 --> 01:13:06.258]  To never turn my back when things get tough.
[01:13:06.258 --> 01:13:10.299]  And to show that positive can always overpower negative.
[01:13:10.299 --> 01:13:11.240]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.400]  I can't listen anymore of it.
[01:13:13.126 --> 01:13:14.048]  Yeah, positive.
[01:13:14.048 --> 01:13:17.834]  That means I don't think, I'm just positive and follow orders.
[01:13:17.834 --> 01:13:20.138]  And they show pictures of Martin Luther King and Gandhi.
[01:13:20.138 --> 01:13:23.884]  Martin Luther King and Gandhi would have fought against what's happening right now, you better believe it.
[01:13:23.884 --> 01:13:24.886]  So this is almost like...
[01:13:25.783 --> 01:13:30.065]  If the Nazis roll themselves in happy, lovey, you know, liberal packaging.
[01:13:30.065 --> 01:13:46.511]  But when you study what the actual training is, it's to spy on neighbors, it's to have a national security force as big and strong as our military, and then you read specifically what the White House says, it's going to be compulsory at military camps, Rahm Emanuel's on record, it's been at change.gov.
[01:13:46.511 --> 01:13:52.794]  But they're in uniforms, chanting and marching and with flags and out there drilling.
[01:13:52.794 --> 01:13:55.495]  I mean, it's a field marshal basically running it.
[01:13:57.668 --> 01:14:03.292]  All of this going on, and this is just the public face of it to sell the population.
[01:14:03.292 --> 01:14:20.804]  When you get down to the nitty-gritty, it's what the New York Times reported on, but again, they reported it with a positive light as well, showing big-color photos of 14- to 17-year-old Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, marching around with MP5 submachine guns, practicing, quote, taking on U.S.
[01:14:20.804 --> 01:14:21.264]  veterans.
[01:14:22.384 --> 01:14:47.564]  Then you see all the mainstream articles over the last few years about how they're training every local department in the country, the feds are, to prepare for improvised explosive devices, and they're telling local police, harden your local facilities, get ready for terrorism, the number one threat is in Al-Qaeda now, it's former military people and gun owners, and the DHS report says that, and libertarians, and don't tread on me people, and folks that won't turn their guns in.
[01:14:49.468 --> 01:15:07.013]  And then you find out that under Secure Corps, and I first saw this seven years ago in the Philadelphia Daily News, it said a division of AmeriCorps that you just heard the ad from, with them out marching around in red uniforms, you know, what is this, uh, Mortal Kombat or something?
[01:15:07.013 --> 01:15:09.774]  And they're almost dressed like the bad guy from Mortal Kombat.
[01:15:09.774 --> 01:15:11.114]  I mean, this is really good.
[01:15:11.114 --> 01:15:12.735]  These are actual commie outfits.
[01:15:13.462 --> 01:15:15.883]  I mean, talk about, this is unbelievable.
[01:15:15.883 --> 01:15:19.425]  I mean, you might as well rely on leather jackets and leather ball caps or something.
[01:15:19.425 --> 01:15:21.747]  I mean, it's just out of control.
[01:15:21.747 --> 01:15:23.628]  Arm bands, a whole nine yards.
[01:15:23.628 --> 01:15:26.149]  And the young, stupid kids love this, folks.
[01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:27.450]  They love playing with guns.
[01:15:27.450 --> 01:15:29.551]  They love being able to march around and drill.
[01:15:29.551 --> 01:15:30.972]  They love being made to feel important.
[01:15:32.972 --> 01:15:36.193]  And so they're now launching this with millions of youth nationwide.
[01:15:36.193 --> 01:15:39.314]  That means within two years, they'll be ready to move against the population.
[01:15:39.314 --> 01:15:41.235]  Four years, really ready to move.
[01:15:41.235 --> 01:15:48.237]  And you watch, when Barack Obama leaves in four to eight years, the next president, whether it's a Republican or Democrat, they're going to expand it.
[01:15:48.237 --> 01:15:53.338]  Because the presidents are now just front men and puppets.
[01:15:53.338 --> 01:15:57.940]  So I want to give you some of the background of this, but have you noticed it's not ITT technical anymore?
[01:15:58.675 --> 01:16:02.243]  It's ITT, law enforcement, security guards training.
[01:16:02.243 --> 01:16:03.466]  It's not how to fix computers.
[01:16:03.466 --> 01:16:04.829]  It's not how to make computers.
[01:16:04.829 --> 01:16:06.313]  It's how to be a cop or run a cop.
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:14.884]  And the public schools have these law enforcement semesters in high school and junior high where they train them to write dossiers on their parents.
[01:16:14.884 --> 01:16:24.469]  And now the New York Times reports as if it's a good thing that children are telling their parents to turn the faucet off and don't water the yard and bossing their parents around and paddling on their parents.
[01:16:24.469 --> 01:16:25.730]  Oh, isn't it cute?
[01:16:25.730 --> 01:16:26.971]  No, it's not cute.
[01:16:26.971 --> 01:16:28.972]  It's hardcore scientific tyranny.
[01:16:28.972 --> 01:16:29.432]  Stay with us.
[01:16:29.432 --> 01:16:31.413]  We'll break it down and take your calls on the other side.
[01:16:33.795 --> 01:16:37.198]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?

[01:16:50.408 --> 01:16:56.773]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.

[01:18:34.407 --> 01:18:38.492]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:18:38.492 --> 01:18:44.379]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:18:44.379 --> 01:18:45.501]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:18:45.501 --> 01:18:49.546]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:18:50.186 --> 01:19:03.993]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:19:03.993 --> 01:19:09.596]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:19:09.596 --> 01:19:15.479]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[01:20:26.595 --> 01:20:27.016]  Or call 800-675-0323.
[01:20:29.517 --> 01:20:30.797]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:30.797 --> 01:20:35.158]  Yeah, you know, I don't want to do a disservice here.
[01:20:35.158 --> 01:20:39.559]  I don't want to come on air and just calmly report on this and
[01:21:00.003 --> 01:21:01.865]  In a way condition people to accept it.
[01:21:01.865 --> 01:21:03.066]  This is a big deal.
[01:21:03.066 --> 01:21:05.107]  This is really bad.
[01:21:05.107 --> 01:21:14.275]  Let's say there's a list of a hundred things the government checks off to bring a nation to total tyranny and bondage and oppression.
[01:21:14.275 --> 01:21:25.845]  And one of the biggest ones you check off is indoctrinating the youth paramilitarily to train the central government, to serve the central government, to be trained by the central government.
[01:21:26.966 --> 01:21:35.053]  And that is what is happening now, and I keep telling people it's in government documents, it's being set up, it's being done.
[01:21:35.053 --> 01:21:44.342]  When I was in high school, they were just now, this is like 18 years ago, hard to believe I'm getting that old, they were already setting up
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:48.221]  That you could take a law enforcement semester.
[01:21:48.221 --> 01:21:50.821]  But then it was just learning about it, and I didn't do it.
[01:21:50.821 --> 01:21:55.422]  Now, they... I mean, I've gotten the grants, the federal grants to the schools.
[01:21:55.422 --> 01:21:59.003]  And the BATF, or the FBI, or the federal marshals, there's different grants.
[01:21:59.003 --> 01:22:06.565]  They federalize a local group of police officers, or sheriff's deputies, and then they go teach the federal curriculum.
[01:22:06.565 --> 01:22:10.126]  And it is, what is in your parents' medicine cabinet?
[01:22:10.126 --> 01:22:14.567]  And then it's, let's go out with M-16s, or toy M-16s at first, then real ones later.
[01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:22.471]  By the way, it's in the stack if I have time to get to it.
[01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:32.597]  Tennessee newspapers have given us credit, it's up on InfoWars.com, a link to the article, that we supposedly stopped illegal military checkpoints to be run in Tennessee.
[01:22:32.597 --> 01:22:44.064]  Well, it'd be nice to get the credit, and they have the governor's statements and others in there, but they, the governor and the state reps, said don't have the illegal military checkpoints without warrants.
[01:22:44.864 --> 01:22:50.205]  And it went ahead and happened, so we actually don't deserve the credit, but we did point it out.
[01:22:50.205 --> 01:22:52.926]  I don't even, the media's not even getting it right here.
[01:22:52.926 --> 01:22:57.786]  The point is, again, suddenly all over the country, the Army's running checkpoints.
[01:22:57.786 --> 01:23:03.087]  Suddenly they're just popping up with drills, and then the drills go live, and they're searching citizens.
[01:23:03.087 --> 01:23:08.769]  This is to acclimate and to test which cities, which counties, which states will go along with takeover.
[01:23:08.769 --> 01:23:11.049]  And then why would the military want to take over?
[01:23:11.716 --> 01:23:17.079]  Because they work under NORTHCOM, which is publicly chartered under the North American Union.
[01:23:17.079 --> 01:23:20.520]  That is public, declassified treaties.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:24.482]  We are in the NAU.
[01:23:24.482 --> 01:23:27.103]  And under this new system, we don't have any rights or liberties.
[01:23:27.103 --> 01:23:30.025]  Now, they can tell me all day I don't have rights and liberties, but
[01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:32.959]  I have them because God gave them to me.
[01:23:32.959 --> 01:23:36.220]  I'm innately a free being, even if you're an atheist.
[01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.520]  Don't you believe that you're innately a free human?
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:46.922]  That the government, you know, can't stick you on the end of a pike out front the castle gates for no reason if they want to?
[01:23:46.922 --> 01:23:58.244]  Oh, it's so amazing, ladies and gentlemen, to have all of this happening, but up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, a story by Paul Joseph Watson and Kurt Nemo, governments ready youth corps to take on vets.
[01:23:58.948 --> 01:24:07.132]  Ten minutes into an errant mayhem in the town near Mexican border, and a gunman, a disgruntled Iraq war veteran, has already taken on two people.
[01:24:07.132 --> 01:24:10.093]  One slumped in the desk, the other covered in blood on the floor.
[01:24:10.093 --> 01:24:19.038]  And it goes, uh, the New York Times article reporting on how the Boy Scouts are being trained to take on domestic terrorists.
[01:24:19.038 --> 01:24:25.781]  Now, see, if this was just one drill, you'd say, oh, well, in that one scenario, the feds in the grant paid to have this.
[01:24:26.613 --> 01:24:31.636]  I have articles in Texas, Michigan, California, New York, everywhere.
[01:24:31.636 --> 01:24:38.360]  I have Hobbs Middle School article 1998.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:42.282]  In fact, if folks don't believe this, Google it again like I did two weeks ago on the air.
[01:24:42.282 --> 01:24:46.064]  Hobbs Middle School Marines.
[01:24:46.064 --> 01:24:46.784]  Martial Law.
[01:24:46.784 --> 01:24:49.986]  Hobbs Middle School Marines Martial Law.
[01:24:49.986 --> 01:24:50.026]  1998.
[01:24:50.026 --> 01:24:53.028]  We have the article saved, and a listener faxed it to me.
[01:24:54.151 --> 01:25:00.175]  And I called the Marines up and I said, did you really go in and tell the kids it was martial law and put guns in their heads?
[01:25:00.175 --> 01:25:02.317]  And they said, yeah, we were ordered to do so.
[01:25:02.317 --> 01:25:04.558]  The Marines weren't even hiding this.
[01:25:04.558 --> 01:25:12.704]  This has been a long-term strategic operation to acclimate everybody, including the children, to go along with this.
[01:25:12.704 --> 01:25:19.509]  So they have drills where they come in and say, the police come in and say, unannounced, in Michigan, the AP reported, we're here to kill you.
[01:25:19.509 --> 01:25:22.731]  We're the homeschoolers against public education.
[01:25:22.731 --> 01:25:23.712]  And for the Second Amendment.
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.861]  I'm not kidding, that's a quote.
[01:25:25.861 --> 01:25:29.123]  And then the kids' parents say, what was this about?
[01:25:29.123 --> 01:25:30.684]  Oh, it's about homeschoolers attacking.
[01:25:30.684 --> 01:25:31.945]  Those darn homeschoolers!
[01:25:31.945 --> 01:25:44.054]  I mean, that'd be like if I didn't like black people and I dressed up, you know, in blackface and went over to my neighbor's house and beat them up and said, I'm a black guy, I don't like white people.
[01:25:44.054 --> 01:25:48.117]  That would be a false flag attack against black people.
[01:25:48.117 --> 01:25:54.121]  If I burned down the police station and then left evidence that somebody I didn't like did it, that would be a false flag.
[01:25:54.941 --> 01:25:56.563]  A staged terror attack.
[01:25:56.563 --> 01:26:04.910]  When the police attacked their own police in Denver and in Canada last year and in England at the G20 two weeks ago and then admit they did it.
[01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:09.193]  That's a false flag to make all the demonstrators look bad.
[01:26:09.193 --> 01:26:10.134]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[01:26:10.134 --> 01:26:15.138]  They have these drills everywhere where veterans go crazy and kill everybody.
[01:26:15.138 --> 01:26:18.481]  Or where homeschoolers come to the public school and kill people.
[01:26:18.481 --> 01:26:20.543]  Or where militia members come and kill people.
[01:26:21.198 --> 01:26:26.642]  That's how they demonize gun owners, veterans, and others to the local police.
[01:26:26.642 --> 01:26:28.323]  It's a simple false flag.
[01:26:28.323 --> 01:26:29.984]  It's basic psychology.
[01:26:29.984 --> 01:26:31.885]  Do you like being manipulated?
[01:26:31.885 --> 01:26:33.566]  Do you like being suckered?
[01:26:33.566 --> 01:26:36.668]  Do you like being fools?
[01:26:36.668 --> 01:26:43.433]  And now they've announced, you know, I said one million off of Rahm Emanuel's book he wrote three years ago and now he's chief of staff and
[01:26:44.508 --> 01:27:02.002]  Now the White House is saying 8 million, 7 to 8 million in the New York Times, youth corps with police powers, with environmental corps, armed corps, all these different surveillance squads, they're announcing it!
[01:27:02.002 --> 01:27:08.988]  And what are the number one new federal grants for people to get tuition in the schools?
[01:27:11.199 --> 01:27:22.927]  You know, when a kid has great grades, they get scholarships now to not be a nuclear physicist, to not be a biologist, to not be a teacher, to not be a physical therapist.
[01:27:22.927 --> 01:27:23.447]  No!
[01:27:23.447 --> 01:27:28.751]  The biggest piece of the pie now is law enforcement and surveillance and Patriot Act compliance.
[01:27:30.547 --> 01:27:31.227]  And what is it?
[01:27:31.227 --> 01:27:38.171]  Data mining, spying on neighbors, running people's backgrounds when they rent a car, get a hotel, how to be spies.
[01:27:38.171 --> 01:27:45.995]  That's why everywhere you go now, there's security guards and spies and you can't videotape here as you walk down the street, you know, videotaping a landmark.
[01:27:47.674 --> 01:27:49.495]  Acting like everybody's a terrorist.
[01:27:49.495 --> 01:27:51.137]  See, it's all for us.
[01:27:51.137 --> 01:27:52.718]  It's all for the people.
[01:27:52.718 --> 01:28:05.967]  Because big offshore banks, publicly and trilateral commissions, CFR, Club of Rome, Bilderberg Group, documents that we post on Infowars.com, that are now mainstream news, Politico, CBS News.
[01:28:06.838 --> 01:28:14.244]  All these major newspapers, Portugal Television, biggest papers in Greece are now quoting us because we get the documents.
[01:28:14.244 --> 01:28:16.165]  We send the teams to Bilderberg.
[01:28:16.165 --> 01:28:17.507]  I get arrested going to it.
[01:28:17.507 --> 01:28:18.567]  Jim Tucker does.
[01:28:18.567 --> 01:28:19.428]  Others do.
[01:28:19.428 --> 01:28:28.115]  More than a dozen reporters got arrested over the weekend in Greece just trying to cover these people meeting.
[01:28:28.115 --> 01:28:30.497]  And you know what their documents say?
[01:28:30.497 --> 01:28:34.900]  They are going to have a string of controlled financial implosions.
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:36.001]  Each one worse than the next.
[01:28:36.403 --> 01:28:42.626]  Government's going to pose as the savior during each one and use that to get more control for select group of corporations.
[01:28:42.626 --> 01:28:46.568]  They're going to hand what's left of the West industry over to select banks.
[01:28:46.568 --> 01:28:52.591]  Then they're going to bankrupt the world currencies total and have a new global digital currency.
[01:28:52.591 --> 01:29:04.237]  See, first they're going to go to regional currencies where you still have your dollar, still have your euro, but it will be digitized and set to the same rate every day, the same currency rate, in the name of stabilization.
[01:29:05.845 --> 01:29:09.686]  Then, they're gonna go right to thumb scans and retina scans.
[01:29:09.686 --> 01:29:10.986]  This has openly been announced.
[01:29:10.986 --> 01:29:13.547]  That's the new global currency.
[01:29:13.547 --> 01:29:18.969]  And if your retina's turned off, your thumbprint's turned off, no buying, no selling, total control.
[01:29:18.969 --> 01:29:21.609]  Think of what Hitler or Stalin would have done with that.

[01:31:36.318 --> 01:31:37.279]  Growing season.
[01:31:37.279 --> 01:31:39.461]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:31:39.461 --> 01:31:41.182]  In fact, it's getting worse.

[01:32:34.987 --> 01:32:36.727]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:32:36.727 --> 01:32:39.408]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:32:39.408 --> 01:32:44.549]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.

[01:33:33.872 --> 01:33:36.433]  The GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:36.433 --> 01:33:40.074]  Providing the world with hard-hitting talk radio.
[01:33:40.074 --> 01:33:41.054]  GCN.
[01:33:41.054 --> 01:33:54.158]  Great talk radio starts here.
[01:33:54.158 --> 01:33:59.259]  Folks, it couldn't be creepier when you look at what the federal government's doing.
[01:33:59.259 --> 01:34:02.760]  All the warrantless wiretapping and the secret arrest and
[01:34:03.716 --> 01:34:05.177]  No rights for detainees.
[01:34:05.177 --> 01:34:08.718]  And if you read that Military Commissions Act, it says that's for U.S.
[01:34:08.718 --> 01:34:09.899]  citizens as well.
[01:34:09.899 --> 01:34:12.360]  They just strip you of your citizenship.
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:21.985]  And then you look at where the funding's going, I'd say 98% of anti-terrorists focused inward on the American people and the federalized local police.
[01:34:21.985 --> 01:34:25.926]  This is all for you, the youth corps, the Boy Scouts.
[01:34:25.926 --> 01:34:29.408]  And I don't want to just single out the Boy Scouts here, because I think it's been a very good organization overall.
[01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:45.175]  I'm talking about all the public schools, the private schools, they're all being recruited into these federal programs where the youth actually march around and train with guns and train for gun confiscation.
[01:34:45.175 --> 01:34:49.379]  And Obama keeps getting up and saying, oh, I don't want your guns, we're not coming after your guns.
[01:34:49.379 --> 01:34:54.144]  They've got eight different bills introduced that will basically completely ban the Second Amendment.
[01:34:55.921 --> 01:34:59.043]  They're trying to get us to sign on and they've already signed on.
[01:34:59.043 --> 01:35:09.450]  They want the Senate to ratify this small arms ban that states that it'll ban the Second Amendment right down to black powder.
[01:35:09.450 --> 01:35:10.931]  I mean, it's all happening.
[01:35:10.931 --> 01:35:11.852]  It's all happening.
[01:35:11.852 --> 01:35:15.174]  Everybody's worried about the economy and the media keeps saying everything's fine.
[01:35:15.174 --> 01:35:21.978]  Yeah, Chrysler's laying off $3,000 and GM's gonna lay off, you know, when I say $3,000, I mean $3,000 dealerships.
[01:35:21.978 --> 01:35:23.259]  Yeah, they're shutting all the
[01:35:24.272 --> 01:35:30.176]  You know, all the Chrysler dealerships, or almost all of them, they're going to shut down 3,000 GM ones, but everything's fine.
[01:35:30.176 --> 01:35:36.600]  And yeah, $14.8 trillion in seven months has been stolen by offshore banks.
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:50.889]  And then the very banking heads meet in secret in Greece, and mainstream reporters for the biggest Greek papers, biggest British papers and others, London Guardian and others, and I interviewed them Thursday and Friday,
[01:35:52.023 --> 01:35:53.064]  They went and showed up.
[01:35:53.064 --> 01:35:56.287]  They went there and they got arrested.
[01:35:56.287 --> 01:36:03.073]  They got picked up.
[01:36:03.073 --> 01:36:05.335]  Hey guys, will you guys come reboot the phone system?
[01:36:05.335 --> 01:36:08.037]  It just shut down in here.
[01:36:08.037 --> 01:36:10.500]  That's why old pad and paper seems to be good with these guests.
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:12.581]  These computers are always frying out.
[01:36:12.581 --> 01:36:14.323]  Thank you, because I want to go back to the calls here in a moment.
[01:36:15.717 --> 01:36:18.277]  Look, all of this is going on.
[01:36:18.277 --> 01:36:19.878]  All of this is happening.
[01:36:19.878 --> 01:36:21.698]  And I know it sounds crazy.
[01:36:21.698 --> 01:36:22.918]  I can't believe it.
[01:36:22.918 --> 01:36:24.078]  I understand.
[01:36:24.078 --> 01:36:26.059]  But they couldn't believe it in Germany in the 30s.
[01:36:26.059 --> 01:36:28.839]  They couldn't believe it in Russia in 1918.
[01:36:28.839 --> 01:36:31.200]  They couldn't believe it in China.
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:33.280]  But it's happening here.
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:40.401]  And it is the big money setting up a police state to turn the poor people loose on you.
[01:36:40.401 --> 01:36:43.242]  They're going to tell the poor folks, you know, here's a fancy uniform.
[01:36:43.242 --> 01:36:44.142]  Here's a machine gun.
[01:36:45.914 --> 01:36:46.715]  It starts slow.
[01:36:46.715 --> 01:36:58.865]  You know, military in New York after 9-11, and then military at the Kentucky Derby, and then military arresting people at the Kentucky Derby, and at college football games, and the Super Bowl, and then the regular army at high school football games.
[01:36:58.865 --> 01:37:00.286]  It's now happening!
[01:37:00.286 --> 01:37:01.747]  These reports are pouring in!
[01:37:01.747 --> 01:37:03.068]  Mainstream news everywhere going,
[01:37:03.468 --> 01:37:06.051]  Oh, yes, the Army and the Air Force MPs.
[01:37:06.051 --> 01:37:07.092]  We're out in Tennessee.
[01:37:07.092 --> 01:37:08.413]  We're out in Arkansas.
[01:37:08.413 --> 01:37:09.414]  We're out in Michigan.
[01:37:09.414 --> 01:37:14.478]  We're out in New York, running checkpoints today, just searching people for everyone's safety.
[01:37:14.478 --> 01:37:16.180]  Oh, hi, I'm the regular Army.
[01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:17.241]  I'm just here to search you.
[01:37:18.177 --> 01:37:29.582]  And then they're having drills in Florida and Arizona and California and upstate New York with foreign troops training with public FEMA drills to take over the U.S.
[01:37:29.582 --> 01:37:35.245]  and saying, oh yes, in newspaper headlines, foreign troops will help if terrorists strike.
[01:37:35.245 --> 01:37:37.166]  They've done this before, actually.
[01:37:37.166 --> 01:37:41.828]  Why, Mexican troops helped in New Orleans and Norwegian troops helped after 9-11.
[01:37:44.111 --> 01:37:45.572]  See, they just set the precedent.
[01:37:45.572 --> 01:37:46.852]  It's happening!
[01:37:46.852 --> 01:37:48.953]  As bad as things are now, this is nothing.
[01:37:48.953 --> 01:37:51.734]  What are they planning so bad?
[01:37:51.734 --> 01:37:57.417]  They think we're going to accept youth corps running around in grey, red, and blue uniforms?
[01:37:58.888 --> 01:38:00.670]  That's the good that they're in uniforms.
[01:38:00.670 --> 01:38:01.931]  You can go to the government websites.
[01:38:01.931 --> 01:38:03.932]  I have it up on InfoWars.com!
[01:38:03.932 --> 01:38:16.583]  They're in blue, gray, and red uniforms running around and they admit they're going to come door-to-door and already are asking you if you support the president's policies and then marking down your house if you support or not.
[01:38:16.583 --> 01:38:19.065]  Talk about intimidation.
[01:38:19.065 --> 01:38:19.725]  Unspoken.
[01:38:19.725 --> 01:38:24.930]  Oh, hi, we're just here in a red uniform to ask and see if... It's happening, people!
[01:38:28.319 --> 01:38:30.920]  It's kind of a cool sound.
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:31.900]  Wow.
[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:32.841]  Wow.
[01:38:32.841 --> 01:38:34.001]  Wow.
[01:38:34.001 --> 01:38:39.263]  I mean, I don't know what it's going to take to get people... Ugh, man.
[01:38:39.263 --> 01:38:41.444]  I wish this wasn't true, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:41.444 --> 01:38:44.705]  I wish!
[01:38:44.705 --> 01:38:45.726]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:38:45.726 --> 01:38:46.826]  Mike in North Carolina.
[01:38:46.826 --> 01:38:48.387]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:38:48.387 --> 01:38:48.987]  Hey, Alex.
[01:38:48.987 --> 01:38:50.127]  How's it going?
[01:38:50.127 --> 01:38:50.387]  Good.
[01:38:50.387 --> 01:38:56.890]  They just keep incrementally implementing this, where it's kind of the ambient background, like the frog in the pot, and people put up with it.
[01:38:57.632 --> 01:39:00.135]  Oh, they're pulling out all the stops.
[01:39:00.135 --> 01:39:04.359]  Let me tell you, punks in red uniforms better not come around my house.
[01:39:04.359 --> 01:39:07.982]  That is un-American as it gets, and they equate it with our history.
[01:39:07.982 --> 01:39:12.466]  Yes, we're the youth corps in red uniforms and khaki pants.
[01:39:12.466 --> 01:39:14.588]  I mean, you gotta see these outfits, man.
[01:39:14.588 --> 01:39:18.992]  Black boots and khaki pants and red jackets.
[01:39:18.992 --> 01:39:21.735]  I mean, and it's military style.
[01:39:21.735 --> 01:39:22.236]  It's unbelievable.
[01:39:23.815 --> 01:39:25.276]  Oh, listen, I forgot!
[01:39:25.276 --> 01:39:26.616]  The end of the video is the worst.
[01:39:26.616 --> 01:39:27.677]  I couldn't listen to it.
[01:39:27.677 --> 01:39:30.297]  It says, and this is my uniform.
[01:39:30.297 --> 01:39:31.918]  This is what I wear.
[01:39:31.918 --> 01:39:33.579]  I mean, folks, look out, man.
[01:39:33.579 --> 01:39:35.259]  This is crazy.
[01:39:35.259 --> 01:39:37.880]  But how do they, why are people outraged about it?
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:44.888]  Because they drink sodium fluoride, a known sedative, in every major government study, and then the public's so brainwashed because they made Archie Bunker talk about it so people aren't kooks.
[01:39:44.888 --> 01:39:45.969]  They're not Archie Bunker.
[01:39:45.969 --> 01:39:48.011]  So they believe sodium fluoride's good for them.
[01:39:48.011 --> 01:39:49.333]  And people are fat, dumb, and happy.
[01:39:49.333 --> 01:39:53.637]  We had it so good because we had liberty that people just still can't believe it's happening to them.
[01:39:53.637 --> 01:39:54.438]  Let me tell you something.
[01:39:54.438 --> 01:39:57.562]  The economy's going to get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[01:39:57.562 --> 01:39:58.643]  It's all by design.
[01:39:59.003 --> 01:40:07.045]  I'm on record three years ago making a film breaking down exactly how the economy would go down because we had spies inside Bilderberg.
[01:40:07.045 --> 01:40:14.226]  Because we get arrested, we get death-threatened, we go through hell to bring the fat, dumb America this information.
[01:40:14.226 --> 01:40:20.207]  But you may be fat and dumb, but you're my kin, so I still love you, and I'm not gonna be free if you're not free.
[01:40:20.207 --> 01:40:21.948]  So I'm here saying, wake up!
[01:40:21.948 --> 01:40:22.468]  Wake up!
[01:40:22.468 --> 01:40:23.408]  Our house is on fire!
[01:40:23.408 --> 01:40:23.768]  And they're like,
[01:40:24.048 --> 01:40:24.749]  What's that smell?
[01:40:24.749 --> 01:40:25.569]  It smells like a barbecue.
[01:40:25.569 --> 01:40:28.292]  And I'm like, yeah, our house is burning.
[01:40:28.292 --> 01:40:29.713]  And they're like, shut up.
[01:40:29.713 --> 01:40:31.234]  I'm going to lay here on the couch.
[01:40:31.234 --> 01:40:32.815]  Listen, get up, man.
[01:40:32.815 --> 01:40:33.996]  Come on.
[01:40:33.996 --> 01:40:38.100]  We've been chemically lobotomized, my friend.
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:39.161]  And with the entertainment.
[01:40:39.161 --> 01:40:44.405]  The average adult watches four hours of TV a day and all the studies admit it literally puts you into a dreamlike state.
[01:40:45.057 --> 01:40:46.537]  That's not my opinion, Polk.
[01:40:46.537 --> 01:40:54.619]  Google, search engine, television watching, dreamlike state, lowered brainwaves, television, Alzheimer's.
[01:40:54.619 --> 01:40:55.539]  They've known!
[01:40:55.539 --> 01:40:56.779]  They know!
[01:40:56.779 --> 01:40:58.659]  They know, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:40:58.659 --> 01:41:00.340]  It's brainwashing you!
[01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:12.282]  The flicker rates, the blue mist, you know, that's meant to get your eye focused on that, put you into subconscious mode, bombarding you with like 20 different images, shuts off your conscious thinking, goes right into the subconscious.
[01:41:12.282 --> 01:41:13.622]  They knew this 50 years ago!
[01:41:15.141 --> 01:41:23.725]  I wanted to bring to your attention, April 3rd, CDC let out a report that they tested 18 baby formulas.
[01:41:23.725 --> 01:41:27.166]  Every one of them had perchlorate rocket fuel.
[01:41:27.166 --> 01:41:36.390]  I know, and also, more than 90% has melamine that kills the kidneys, and they always said it was deadly, but when that came out, they said, we now say melamine is good for you.
[01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:38.811]  And they now say mercury is good for you.
[01:41:38.811 --> 01:41:41.692]  Well, that seriously affects the infant brain development, and they know it.
[01:41:42.387 --> 01:41:44.971]  Uh, it's also in 35 states water systems.
[01:41:44.971 --> 01:41:47.654]  They won't say which ones, but here's a, here's a kicker Alex.
[01:41:47.654 --> 01:41:52.961]  MBTE that they ordered put in the, uh, in the gasoline to help the greenhouse gas?
[01:41:52.961 --> 01:41:53.542]  Yep.
[01:41:53.542 --> 01:41:57.287]  That is in 49 states it attacks brains.
[01:41:57.287 --> 01:41:57.627]  But why?
[01:41:57.627 --> 01:41:59.109]  Of course it's an accident.
[01:41:59.890 --> 01:42:07.875]  Yeah, why does a one baby formula that has 80% of the market share have three times the amount that the other ones do?
[01:42:07.875 --> 01:42:08.876]  It's an accident.
[01:42:08.876 --> 01:42:10.157]  I appreciate your call.
[01:42:10.157 --> 01:42:16.040]  Just like when you go into Babies R Us and all these stores, it's huge racks of fluoride for your baby.
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:18.482]  Fluoride water, the mineral it needs.
[01:42:18.482 --> 01:42:19.302]  Fluoride.
[01:42:19.302 --> 01:42:20.763]  And they know.
[01:42:20.763 --> 01:42:22.004]  They know.
[01:42:22.004 --> 01:42:22.805]  They know.
[01:42:22.805 --> 01:42:24.886]  Not Babies R Us, but the company.
[01:42:25.623 --> 01:42:29.585]  They know fluoride is four times as bad.
[01:42:29.585 --> 01:42:30.726]  In fact, people don't believe me.
[01:42:30.726 --> 01:42:33.368]  I want to cover it in the last segment.
[01:42:33.368 --> 01:42:38.851]  Google and print for me, fluoride more damaging to young brains.
[01:42:38.851 --> 01:42:41.892]  Or, fluoride increases cancer in children.
[01:42:41.892 --> 01:42:43.373]  It particularly attacks children.
[01:42:43.373 --> 01:42:44.934]  I'm going to read to you government reports.
[01:42:44.934 --> 01:42:46.755]  There's thousands of them, literally.
[01:42:46.755 --> 01:42:48.997]  But it's, well, your baby needs it.
[01:42:48.997 --> 01:42:51.338]  And I've talked to people in the Soviet, old Soviet Union, and then I
[01:42:52.029 --> 01:42:53.749]  Actually searched it and found it was true.
[01:42:53.749 --> 01:42:55.810]  They would have food rationing.
[01:42:55.810 --> 01:42:58.270]  No sausage, no bread.
[01:42:58.270 --> 01:43:03.871]  But when they went to school, there was always free chocolate, strawberry, and regular flavored milk.
[01:43:03.871 --> 01:43:06.312]  Free, and it fortified with fluoride.
[01:43:06.312 --> 01:43:09.033]  Oh!
[01:43:09.033 --> 01:43:11.673]  Free fluoride milk!
[01:43:11.673 --> 01:43:12.433]  Oh!
[01:43:12.433 --> 01:43:16.654]  The government wants to help!
[01:43:16.654 --> 01:43:20.935]  And they now say on government announcements and PR TV ads,
[01:43:21.972 --> 01:43:27.853]  Mercury is actually good for the brain, and they've got ads where they say corn syrup's good, though you can google that.
[01:43:27.853 --> 01:43:31.174]  More than half of the corn syrup in the country, high levels of mercury.
[01:43:31.174 --> 01:43:32.154]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:32.154 --> 01:43:32.774]  Don't listen to me.
[01:43:32.774 --> 01:43:33.854]  Drink more mercury.
[01:43:33.854 --> 01:43:37.075]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[01:43:37.075 --> 01:43:40.396]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[01:43:40.396 --> 01:43:44.176]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[01:43:44.176 --> 01:43:47.597]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a
[01:43:47.637 --> 01:43:48.418]  We're good to go.
[01:44:03.007 --> 01:44:04.089]  Need something more?
[01:44:04.089 --> 01:44:08.054]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.

[01:44:33.778 --> 01:44:35.078]  Ah, springtime.
[01:44:35.078 --> 01:44:40.261]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[01:44:40.581 --> 01:44:45.223]  Well, the answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[01:44:45.223 --> 01:44:51.186]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP to kill parasites.
[01:44:51.186 --> 01:44:59.810]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[01:44:59.810 --> 01:45:02.451]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[01:45:02.771 --> 01:45:13.635]  Our natural insecticides work in the home, on plants, and in your garden, killing pests mechanically, not with poisons, so pests can't develop an immunity and they won't harm your children or pets.

[01:45:34.056 --> 01:45:41.178]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[01:45:41.178 --> 01:45:57.082]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[01:45:57.382 --> 01:46:02.766]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[01:46:02.766 --> 01:46:09.270]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:13.173]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[01:46:13.173 --> 01:46:15.855]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[01:46:15.855 --> 01:46:21.219]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[01:46:21.519 --> 01:46:24.202]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:46:24.202 --> 01:46:26.424]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:46:26.424 --> 01:46:28.926]  That's MySolarBackup.com.

[01:46:59.898 --> 01:47:02.619]  For instance, Jim Humble's revolutionary internal virus
[01:47:06.215 --> 01:47:09.537]  Canada's nurse reincases a Cy-X-T.
[01:47:09.537 --> 01:47:12.939]  Naturopath recommended Super Zeolite for heavy metal detox.
[01:47:12.939 --> 01:47:15.000]  Even an ozone handheld bidet.

[01:47:34.261 --> 01:47:37.922]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[01:47:37.922 --> 01:47:39.423]  Search no more.
[01:47:39.423 --> 01:47:42.464]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:42.464 --> 01:47:53.247]  You notice how dull people look, how ill they look, how stupid even intelligence people are getting?
[01:47:53.247 --> 01:48:01.510]  Good thing to Google is health effects, fluoride in the brain, and under that I found the Fluoride Action Network, but it links to a lot of studies I've seen in the past.
[01:48:03.171 --> 01:48:12.377]  Here's one, three studies that were done by the federal government.
[01:48:12.377 --> 01:48:17.101]  Fluoride effects on the brain, drinking water, on children's intelligence.
[01:48:17.101 --> 01:48:27.328]  And it's got just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of studies put out by the National Research Council, the EPA, you name it.
[01:48:27.328 --> 01:48:30.130]  And that's why they've had the majority of EPA scientists
[01:48:30.529 --> 01:48:41.391]  Two years ago, I had one of the heads of their major union on saying, yes, they knowingly are putting deadly poison to brain damage the public in the water.
[01:48:41.391 --> 01:48:43.472]  I mean, I'm looking at literally hundreds and hundreds.
[01:48:43.472 --> 01:48:46.532]  That's why this is such a great 15-page article, because it's not even an article.
[01:48:46.532 --> 01:48:51.593]  It's just links to governments, Chinese, British, Russian, U.S., Canadian.
[01:48:51.593 --> 01:48:54.734]  I mean, I remember when I first looked this up more than 12 years ago on the Internet,
[01:48:55.242 --> 01:49:02.045]  I found University of Texas studies from like 1932 about how they were saying, yes, we could use this in the same asylums.
[01:49:02.045 --> 01:49:03.446]  It's a great sedative.
[01:49:03.446 --> 01:49:07.868]  It's just very toxic and causes cancer.
[01:49:07.868 --> 01:49:11.970]  Did you guys print up the studies for me about it massively increasing bone cancer?
[01:49:11.970 --> 01:49:13.610]  Absolute confirmed fact.
[01:49:13.610 --> 01:49:16.032]  But drink up, it's for your baby!
[01:49:16.032 --> 01:49:18.833]  Oh, the government wouldn't do that to make me more manageable.
[01:49:19.497 --> 01:49:23.779]  Well, listen, government idiots, you're drinking it too, you little control freak servants!
[01:49:23.779 --> 01:49:27.701]  This is a very small group of eugenicists at the top that are doing this.
[01:49:27.701 --> 01:49:30.382]  And I'm sorry a lot of you were too cowardly to admit the truth.
[01:49:30.382 --> 01:49:32.923]  The facts are the facts.
[01:49:32.923 --> 01:49:48.270]  Look at this, rat studies and brain cell damage with aluminum and fluoride in water, Wall Street Journal, October 28th, 1992, fluoride in the pineal gland, BBC, fluoride in the brain interview with Dr. Phyllis Mullinex interview,
[01:49:49.404 --> 01:49:52.067]  And it just goes through hundreds of these links.
[01:49:52.067 --> 01:49:59.213]  Full text, Zhang Q. Beijing, effective fluoride in drinking water on children's intelligence.
[01:49:59.213 --> 01:50:02.777]  Full text, effective fluoride on water intelligence of children.
[01:50:02.777 --> 01:50:05.179]  Here's the EPA.
[01:50:05.179 --> 01:50:10.284]  It is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the Brain Source National Research Council.
[01:50:10.725 --> 01:50:11.766]  I'm on page one, by the way.
[01:50:11.766 --> 01:50:12.467]  This goes on 15 pages.
[01:50:12.467 --> 01:50:13.929]  When I say thousands, I mean thousands.
[01:50:22.742 --> 01:50:25.425]  In harm's way, toxic threats to children's development.
[01:50:25.425 --> 01:50:29.048]  But don't worry, the stores have it just for your baby.
[01:50:29.048 --> 01:50:31.150]  Oh, they love you as the government cares.
[01:50:31.150 --> 01:50:36.235]  But meanwhile, you see all the big headlines about the government says we must reduce the population by at least half.
[01:50:36.235 --> 01:50:37.096]  Humans are bad.
[01:50:37.096 --> 01:50:39.278]  We want carbon taxes on fat people.
[01:50:39.278 --> 01:50:41.200]  We want carbon taxes to shut down U.S.
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:42.521]  industry.
[01:50:42.521 --> 01:50:47.326]  Do you know if you buy a piece of rural land and want to get an environmental exemption so you don't have to pay as many taxes on it?
[01:50:47.907 --> 01:50:53.930]  You can never go back, and even if somebody buys it, you can never convert back to agriculture.
[01:50:53.930 --> 01:50:57.412]  You can never use it for agriculture again, because they don't want agriculture.
[01:50:57.412 --> 01:50:59.493]  They don't want industry.
[01:50:59.493 --> 01:51:00.533]  Do you understand?
[01:51:00.533 --> 01:51:01.774]  And it's not for the environment.
[01:51:01.774 --> 01:51:03.915]  It's so they control things.
[01:51:03.915 --> 01:51:07.116]  This is bigger than anything you could imagine, folks, which you're listening to.
[01:51:07.116 --> 01:51:14.300]  And I'm sorry it's some, you know, guy from Texas bringing it to you, but you need to step up and research this and find out about it.
[01:51:14.764 --> 01:51:21.188]  I'm sorry if your ego doesn't like knowing that you're a slave and under chemical and biological attack, but you still are under attack.
[01:51:21.188 --> 01:51:25.151]  You should love your children enough to care!
[01:51:25.151 --> 01:51:26.051]  It just goes on and on.
[01:51:26.051 --> 01:51:34.056]  I said I get into Bilderberg, and I have loaded phone lines here, and I just start thinking about a caller bringing up key points, and it's true.
[01:51:34.056 --> 01:51:34.877]  Let's take another call.
[01:51:34.877 --> 01:51:35.757]  Harvey in Florida.
[01:51:35.757 --> 01:51:36.498]  Harvey, you're on the air.
[01:51:37.225 --> 01:51:39.106]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today?
[01:51:39.106 --> 01:51:39.706]  Oh, pretty good.
[01:51:39.706 --> 01:51:42.947]  I wish folks weren't brain-damaging their children, but hey, they love the government.
[01:51:42.947 --> 01:51:47.768]  Well, I'd love to call you and give you some... I was an eyewitness several weeks ago.
[01:51:47.768 --> 01:51:48.849]  I sent them an email.
[01:51:48.849 --> 01:51:50.869]  I'll give you the short version of what I saw.
[01:51:50.869 --> 01:51:55.791]  I was in the Tropicana Casino and Hotel in Atlantic City.
[01:51:55.791 --> 01:51:56.811]  I go in the elevator.
[01:51:57.870 --> 01:51:59.451]  There's a gentleman dressed in a suit.
[01:51:59.451 --> 01:52:01.713]  I said, oh, are you here for a conference?
[01:52:01.713 --> 01:52:02.413]  He goes, yeah.
[01:52:02.413 --> 01:52:04.115]  I go, what type of conference?
[01:52:04.115 --> 01:52:06.637]  He goes, National Security Conference.
[01:52:06.637 --> 01:52:10.399]  So we go down the elevator and I see an arrow with a conference.
[01:52:10.399 --> 01:52:11.420]  There's a bunch of letters.
[01:52:11.420 --> 01:52:13.822]  FCC, HS.
[01:52:13.822 --> 01:52:15.743]  So I follow the arrow.
[01:52:15.743 --> 01:52:20.227]  And it turns out they had it spelled out when you went upstairs where the conference was.
[01:52:20.227 --> 01:52:24.450]  They had fusion centers, criminal investigation, homeland security.
[01:52:24.450 --> 01:52:27.072]  And I saw all these characters.
[01:52:28.152 --> 01:52:29.732]  It was unbelievable what was going on.
[01:52:29.732 --> 01:52:30.833]  It was a two-day conference.
[01:52:30.833 --> 01:52:38.515]  Yeah, the fusion centers are federalizing everything, teaching the police that guns are going to be illegal, how to work with the youth corps.
[01:52:38.515 --> 01:52:42.116]  The local fusion centers track everybody's cell phone real-time.
[01:52:42.116 --> 01:52:48.157]  They hit one code, they dial in to listen, another code, they follow you by name with your cell phone under federal law.
[01:52:48.157 --> 01:52:50.878]  No Fourth Amendment, no Fifth Amendment, no Tenth.
[01:52:50.878 --> 01:52:51.558]  What else happened?
[01:52:52.299 --> 01:52:59.523]  Well, there was a guy in a white suit with bars on his chest, so I believe he was a Navy Admiral.
[01:52:59.523 --> 01:53:04.346]  And there was state police cars everywhere and stormtroopers from the state police in this conference.
[01:53:04.346 --> 01:53:08.988]  Well, you know who heads up FEMA and all the major departments is military people now.
[01:53:08.988 --> 01:53:09.589]  Yep.
[01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:11.670]  This confirms everything you've been talking about.
[01:53:11.670 --> 01:53:14.411]  So what else did you... I mean, did they see you and tell you to get out of there, or what was going on?
[01:53:14.411 --> 01:53:15.732]  Yes, they gave me an escort out.
[01:53:15.732 --> 01:53:18.053]  I pretended like I was a senile old man.
[01:53:18.053 --> 01:53:20.975]  I was just walking around trying to snoop on them.
[01:53:21.642 --> 01:53:24.344]  And I said, oh no, I'm just looking for the elevators.
[01:53:24.344 --> 01:53:28.667]  You know, I pretended like I was senile, so they escorted me, the security escorted me out.
[01:53:28.667 --> 01:53:30.589]  But they were marching through this place.
[01:53:30.589 --> 01:53:36.814]  The Admiral had five flunkies in suits following him, like an inch from him, as he was marching through the corridors.
[01:53:36.814 --> 01:53:43.839]  And every day, this was three weeks ago, and every day on the news, every minute of every day on every station across the land, they were talking about the flu outbreak.
[01:53:45.873 --> 01:53:48.074]  They weren't hiding, but it was weird.
[01:53:48.074 --> 01:53:49.995]  Why would they be at a casino?
[01:53:49.995 --> 01:53:54.638]  They have to get in a little gambling while they're... Because, well, I'm going to be frank with you.
[01:53:54.638 --> 01:53:56.018]  What do you think runs the New World Order?
[01:53:56.018 --> 01:53:57.760]  It's the global mafia.
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:01.862]  But no, they're having regional meetings everywhere to test their federal flunkies.
[01:54:02.435 --> 01:54:02.515]  Yeah.
[01:54:18.346 --> 01:54:22.727]  They're gonna release some flu or something as a cover story as an excuse to clamp down.
[01:54:22.727 --> 01:54:24.668]  Oh, we gotta have martial law for a flu.
[01:54:24.668 --> 01:54:28.529]  Remember, three weeks ago, four weeks ago, I laid out it was a manufactured flu.
[01:54:28.529 --> 01:54:35.711]  Now, top scientists have looked at it and say, yes, it is totally manufactured, but as a beta test.
[01:54:35.711 --> 01:54:37.831]  And so it just gets crazier and crazier, my friend.
[01:54:37.831 --> 01:54:40.272]  I appreciate your call.
[01:54:40.272 --> 01:54:40.752]  Yeah, it's...
[01:54:41.485 --> 01:54:42.946]  Just Google fusion centers.
[01:54:42.946 --> 01:54:50.530]  It's the fusion centers that are getting these DHS reports saying veterans are the number one threat to homeland security.
[01:54:50.530 --> 01:54:52.851]  Number two, American gun owners.
[01:54:52.851 --> 01:54:56.433]  The whole anti-terror system is for you.
[01:54:56.433 --> 01:54:59.035]  You own a nice ranch, you own a company, you're the target.
[01:55:00.386 --> 01:55:01.306]  You're well-to-do.
[01:55:01.306 --> 01:55:01.986]  You're the target.
[01:55:01.986 --> 01:55:02.707]  You're middle class.
[01:55:02.707 --> 01:55:03.287]  You're a veteran.
[01:55:03.287 --> 01:55:04.147]  You're a gun owner.
[01:55:04.147 --> 01:55:05.527]  You're a retired police officer.
[01:55:05.527 --> 01:55:08.488]  What do you think happened in Russia and China and Cambodia?
[01:55:08.488 --> 01:55:09.828]  You better read up.
[01:55:09.828 --> 01:55:12.788]  You better find out who the targets are.
[01:55:12.788 --> 01:55:15.909]  These people mean business.
[01:55:15.909 --> 01:55:17.169]  They are training youth corps.
[01:55:17.169 --> 01:55:19.690]  I'd say they'll be ready in two, three years.
[01:55:19.690 --> 01:55:20.430]  They'll be ready.
[01:55:20.430 --> 01:55:22.910]  The guys that are 16 are going to be 18.
[01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:25.691]  And they are training to go in and do seek and destroys.
[01:55:25.691 --> 01:55:26.431]  To go in buildings.
[01:55:26.431 --> 01:55:27.331]  It's in the New York Times.
[01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:30.073]  Hidden in plain view.
[01:55:30.073 --> 01:55:34.381]  Oh, look at these young children trying to kill the veterans and the Homeland Security guys.
[01:55:34.381 --> 01:55:37.306]  Go in and get the shooters.
[01:55:37.306 --> 01:55:38.549]  Kill them!
[01:55:38.549 --> 01:55:41.314]  And it's always in a nice situational ethics where you know it's reasonable.
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:44.642]  Wonder if the Austin cops got that.
[01:55:44.642 --> 01:55:48.526]  Two guys are asleep in a car and they gun them down and of course the cameras malfunction.
[01:55:48.526 --> 01:55:53.830]  And people call in on the radio and defend it and say the guys deserve to die for being in a car at night.
[01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:59.536]  Well, when a cop kills your kid in a car at night, just remember you asked for that karma.
[01:55:59.536 --> 01:56:01.057]  And you're like, oh, you don't like the cops.
[01:56:01.057 --> 01:56:07.303]  Oh, no, I didn't like the cops in Nazi Germany, or the Soviet Union, or in Fidel's Cuba right now, or in Venezuela.
[01:56:08.254 --> 01:56:09.235]  No, you bet I don't.
[01:56:09.235 --> 01:56:10.276]  I don't like tyranny.
[01:56:10.276 --> 01:56:12.419]  If a cop's good and follows Bill of Rights, great!
[01:56:12.419 --> 01:56:16.724]  But the cops work for a system that works for foreign offshore banks!
[01:56:16.724 --> 01:56:20.989]  And cops, when they're done with you, you're gonna be their number one enemy, so just get ready for it.
[01:56:20.989 --> 01:56:22.290]  You think you're in power right now?
[01:56:22.290 --> 01:56:22.891]  Just get ready.
[01:56:22.891 --> 01:56:26.215]  They're gonna have a bunch of young scum right up underneath you.
[01:56:26.215 --> 01:56:28.217]  Let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Washington.
[01:56:28.217 --> 01:56:28.978]  Scott, go ahead.
[01:56:29.913 --> 01:56:35.915]  Yeah, I had a question I was going to ask you, but just incidentally, you'd asked what year that Archie Bunker clip was from.
[01:56:35.915 --> 01:56:36.895]  It was from 1972.
[01:56:36.895 --> 01:56:37.455]  72, okay.
[01:56:37.455 --> 01:56:45.698]  Yeah, and that euphemism of the boss hog that you're always talking about, the guy that played him was actually in that episode too.
[01:56:45.698 --> 01:56:48.939]  So just a little trivial for your information.
[01:56:48.939 --> 01:56:56.001]  But what I was going to ask you was that protest at Arizona State, the one that Ernest Hancock was going to be a part of and
[01:56:56.502 --> 01:57:00.944]  Passing out the DVDs, and I know you and Jason had them on your shows last week.
[01:57:00.944 --> 01:57:03.325]  Yeah, I saw a video of them handing out the DVDs.
[01:57:03.325 --> 01:57:07.968]  Yeah, I was just curious, was there any word on how that, uh, how that went?
[01:57:07.968 --> 01:57:15.492]  No, everybody said, oh, the Secret Service won't let them have micro-FMs broadcasting there, and they won't let them hand out 15,000 of my DVDs.
[01:57:15.492 --> 01:57:16.772]  It's all a paper tiger.
[01:57:16.772 --> 01:57:17.833]  You have a First Amendment.
[01:57:17.833 --> 01:57:22.155]  They went out, they were very successful, only had a few pirates, as they call the police.
[01:57:22.695 --> 01:57:28.762]  Yeah, and just to show you how they were trying to dumb it down on the left, one of his former station colleagues, Ernest Hancock, on the station he used to be on,
[01:57:42.617 --> 01:58:00.960]  Was reading some article, I guess he either got it out of Daily Kos or Huffington Post, basically was an instruction guide on how the left should protest this and telling them, oh well, you know, you can say it is, but don't really complain about it and talk about coming to the protest with a positive message.
[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:03.622]  Yeah, it's all political correctness and control.
[01:58:03.622 --> 01:58:05.183]  You know, I meant to get into Bilderberg.
[01:58:05.183 --> 01:58:06.664]  We got articles detailing all of it.
[01:58:06.664 --> 01:58:12.749]  Their plan is global tax, global regulation, world government, bankrupting things, accelerating the depression.
[01:58:12.749 --> 01:58:18.913]  We have people inside, major breaking info in the articles and videos at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:18.913 --> 01:58:20.054]  Great job, crew!
[01:58:20.054 --> 01:58:23.557]  Get fired up about freedom, take on tyranny, and we're gonna win!

[01:58:53.701 --> 01:58:54.942]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:58:54.942 --> 01:58:59.525]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:58:59.525 --> 01:59:05.330]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:59:05.330 --> 01:59:08.972]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:59:08.972 --> 01:59:13.836]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:59:13.836 --> 01:59:16.738]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:59:16.738 --> 01:59:17.038]  Call 800-686-2237.

[01:59:25.502 --> 01:59:26.783]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[01:59:26.783 --> 01:59:29.664]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[01:59:29.664 --> 01:59:33.645]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[01:59:33.645 --> 01:59:37.427]  And if, and only if, you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[01:59:37.427 --> 01:59:39.427]  Most likely, if you try this, you'd be arrested.
[01:59:39.427 --> 01:59:43.729]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the Smokefree free trial offer is.
[01:59:43.729 --> 01:59:46.470]  Smokefree is a complete all-natural stop smoking system.
