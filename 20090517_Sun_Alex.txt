[00:18.480 --> 00:24.120]  This is a limited time offer, so call 1-800-426-6186 now.
[00:24.120 --> 00:31.120]  The federal funding is expected at Capital Metro for a...
[00:31.120 --> 00:35.120]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[00:35.120 --> 00:37.120]  KLBJ Austin, it's four o'clock.
[00:37.120 --> 00:39.120]  Fox News Radio, I'm Karen Riegel.
[00:39.120 --> 00:42.120]  When President Obama addressed the graduates of Notre Dame,
[00:42.120 --> 00:47.120]  he also addressed the controversy that preceded and accompanied his visit.
[00:47.120 --> 00:50.120]  Let's go live now to Fox News Radio's Jennifer Kuiper.
[00:50.120 --> 00:53.120]  Barack Obama talked about abortion, telling graduates...
[00:53.120 --> 00:57.120]  So let us work together to reduce the number of women seeking abortions.
[00:57.120 --> 01:00.120]  Let's reduce unintended pregnancy.
[01:00.120 --> 01:03.120]  Some guests who stood up and yelled were escorted from the audience,
[01:03.120 --> 01:06.120]  the students in unison chanting back, we are ND,
[01:06.120 --> 01:09.120]  on some graduation caps and protests of the President's visit,
[01:09.120 --> 01:11.120]  the sign of the cross and baby's feet,
[01:11.120 --> 01:17.120]  outside at least 27 people arrested on trespassing charges before and during the event.
[01:17.120 --> 01:21.120]  Karen? Jennifer, this abortion controversy comes as President Obama is considering
[01:21.120 --> 01:25.120]  who will replace Justice David Souter on the nation's highest court.
[01:25.120 --> 01:28.120]  Senator Mitch McConnell is the Senate's top Republican.
[01:28.120 --> 01:31.120]  I think Chief Justice Roberts had it right during his confirmation hearing.
[01:31.120 --> 01:33.120]  He said the judge ought to be like an umpire,
[01:33.120 --> 01:35.120]  call the balls and strikes but don't make the rules.
[01:35.120 --> 01:37.120]  That's the kind of individual we're looking for.
[01:37.120 --> 01:40.120]  We know it will be someone of the political left,
[01:40.120 --> 01:45.120]  but a number of leftist judges have been able to put aside their personal views
[01:45.120 --> 01:47.120]  and call it like they said.
[01:47.120 --> 01:49.120]  He spoke on Fox News Sunday.
[01:49.120 --> 01:52.120]  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi got hammered on the Sunday talk shows
[01:52.120 --> 01:59.120]  after claiming last week the CIA liked her about the use of enhanced interrogation techniques.
[01:59.120 --> 02:01.120]  Republican Senator John Kyle.
[02:01.120 --> 02:06.120]  I am less interested in investigating whether her memory was correct or she lied about it
[02:06.120 --> 02:10.120]  than I am in the policies that flow from the debate that we're having.
[02:10.120 --> 02:13.120]  I am not one who thinks we ought to have truth commissions and all the rest of it
[02:13.120 --> 02:15.120]  and keep looking backward. I agree with the president.
[02:15.120 --> 02:17.120]  We've got enough on our plate. We need to look forward.
[02:17.120 --> 02:19.120]  The senator was on ABC's this week.
[02:19.120 --> 02:24.120]  CIA Chief Leon Panetta said last week the CIA misleads no one
[02:24.120 --> 02:27.120]  and was straightforward when it came to briefing lawmakers.
[02:27.120 --> 02:30.120]  You're listening to Fox News Radio, Fair and Balanced.
[02:30.120 --> 02:44.120]  News Radio 590 KLBJ. Good afternoon. It's 4.02. I'm Sarah Hudaberg. Topping Alston's news.
[02:44.120 --> 02:50.120]  The Alston City Council approves almost $800,000 in solo rebates for area businesses.
[02:50.120 --> 02:55.120]  Austin Energy's Ed Clark says that amount is the highest paid out so far
[02:55.120 --> 02:59.120]  to commercial property owners since the solo rebate program was launched.
[02:59.120 --> 03:02.120]  We do have a limit. We do have a budget limit.
[03:02.120 --> 03:06.120]  And that budget limit right now is about $4 million a year.
[03:06.120 --> 03:10.120]  Clark says Austin businesses can also benefit from federal tax credits
[03:10.120 --> 03:15.120]  that pay for up to 80% of solar panel installation.
[03:15.120 --> 03:19.120]  Well, the feds will likely help Austin's main transit agency
[03:19.120 --> 03:24.120]  start a new rapid bus program for two very long north to south routes.
[03:24.120 --> 03:29.120]  It is part of a program from the president and designates 17 million in funding
[03:29.120 --> 03:32.120]  for two of Capital Metro's Metro rapid buses.
[03:32.120 --> 03:38.120]  CapMetro's Adam Shevitz tells KLBJ it means the agency will not have to front all of the money.
[03:38.120 --> 03:42.120]  The fact that we've already been recommended for about 17 million is really great news.
[03:42.120 --> 03:47.120]  Shevitz says ultimately they'll have to cover up to 37 million with federal funding.
[03:47.120 --> 03:51.120]  One route would link St. David's North with South Park Meadows to the south
[03:51.120 --> 03:56.120]  using Burnett and South Congress. The other route would link Tech Ridge with Westgate
[03:56.120 --> 04:00.120]  using Lamar Boulevard. Jared Allen, News Radio 590 KLBJ.
[04:00.120 --> 04:06.120]  The Texas House has adopted new guidelines over how corporate money can be used in elections.
[04:06.120 --> 04:10.120]  News Radio 590 KLBJ's Emily Trubb has more.
[04:10.120 --> 04:15.120]  The bill would ban corporate and union money from being used on political attack ads.
[04:15.120 --> 04:21.120]  Political parties and political action committees could only use money from corporate and union donations
[04:21.120 --> 04:26.120]  on administrative costs. Opponents argue that the measure hampers free speech.
[04:26.120 --> 04:29.120]  Emily Trubb, News Radio 590 KLBJ.
[04:29.120 --> 04:33.120]  Now the KLBJ ran our weather watch with Richard Luelling.

[07:10.120 --> 07:23.120]  Well, let me just start the broadcast by putting a time stamp on it, because we stand behind what we say over the years and the decades,
[07:23.120 --> 07:26.120]  and fortunately it all comes true right on time.
[07:26.120 --> 07:31.120]  Because we're reading the government's own declassified documents about how they work for offshore banks,
[07:31.120 --> 07:42.120]  to set up a world government, to carry out eugenics against the people of the planet. So it is May 17, 2009, a Sunday edition.
[07:42.120 --> 07:45.120]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[07:45.120 --> 07:54.120]  Lots of phone calls today, 877-590-5525, 877-590-5525 will get you up.
[07:54.120 --> 08:01.120]  And on the air, you can also call the local line from the station that this syndicated transmission comes to you from.
[08:01.120 --> 08:06.120]  A news radio, 590-KLBJ, that's 836-0590.
[08:06.120 --> 08:15.120]  On any issue, any news item, anything you want to talk about, it is a complete and absolute total free for all today.
[08:15.120 --> 08:18.120]  That said, here is the news I have in front of me.
[08:18.120 --> 08:25.120]  The Bilderberg Group meeting is breaking up as we speak, and I guess they're eight hours ahead of us.
[08:25.120 --> 08:31.120]  So over there, it's almost the 18th over there.
[08:31.120 --> 08:33.120]  I guess it is the 18th over there.
[08:33.120 --> 08:42.120]  So yesterday in Greece, but today in North America, the Bilderberg Group concluded its 57th annual meeting.
[08:42.120 --> 08:51.120]  And for those that don't know, I put this in my film, Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement, but now it's been completely declassified by the British and U.S. governments.
[08:51.120 --> 09:01.120]  Wartime Army documents from the Army and Marines and the British military as well that the Nazis knew they were going to lose by 44.
[09:01.120 --> 09:10.120]  So they went underground and set up an organization that publicly emerged in 54 as the Bilderberg Group.
[09:10.120 --> 09:24.120]  They were going to set up a European Union, buy off the United States, and set up a North American Union, and that's in the Globe and Mail, BBC, and other major international publications.
[09:24.120 --> 09:29.120]  Now, I want to be clear, the New World Order is not Nazi.
[09:29.120 --> 09:37.120]  What really happened is, you know, the British media is spinning it that the European Union was set up by Nazis, and that's true to a certain extent.
[09:37.120 --> 09:47.120]  You had a lot of wealth, trillions of dollars, even in the numbers of the 40s, the tens of trillions today, that went underground.
[09:47.120 --> 09:52.120]  And it was intermarried with the British and other wealthy around Europe.
[09:52.120 --> 09:59.120]  And a lot of U.S. financiers and robber barons were buddies with the German aristocracy, the Crumps and others.
[09:59.120 --> 10:04.120]  The Rothschilds of England owned large parts of Germany at the time.
[10:04.120 --> 10:09.120]  The King of England had to advocate because he was a public Nazi, Edward VIII.
[10:09.120 --> 10:12.120]  That's all on record, though it's not common knowledge.
[10:12.120 --> 10:14.120]  It's in the mainline history books.
[10:14.120 --> 10:33.120]  And so in 54, the CIA with Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands and others set up the first Bilderberg Group meeting to kind of bring together the German money with the Anglo-American slash Dutch money.
[10:33.120 --> 10:38.120]  And the Dutch have always been more closely allied to the Anglo-Americans, the U.S. and England than they have been to the Germans.
[10:38.120 --> 10:40.120]  But that's kind of the nexus point.
[10:40.120 --> 10:47.120]  That's why it was the go-between point at the Bilderberg Hotel in the Netherlands for that meeting to take place.
[10:47.120 --> 10:52.120]  And the Bilderberg Group has been bragging the last five or six years.
[10:52.120 --> 11:02.120]  They released their minutes of their first meeting of some of the meetings in the 60s as well, decades later, where they had bragged that they set up the Treaty of Rome to set up the European Union covertly,
[11:02.120 --> 11:18.120]  that they're setting up the North American Union by stealth, that they're basically shaping the world we live in today, an undemocratic, tyrannical world ruled by a private group of banks.
[11:18.120 --> 11:23.120]  And then the German chancellors and British prime ministers, people like David Rockefeller, write memoirs.
[11:23.120 --> 11:28.120]  He wrote his memoir four and a half years ago, bragging, yes, I'm trying to overthrow the U.S. and set up a new world order.
[11:28.120 --> 11:31.120]  I'm proud of it.
[11:31.120 --> 11:35.120]  Now, the elite will have all the rights in the world under this system and everybody else will be poor slaves.
[11:35.120 --> 11:37.120]  Now, this is not a good system.
[11:37.120 --> 11:53.120]  Now, in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s and 90s and on through today, in the year 2009, they run TV shows and movies and news articles making fun of people that believe in the new world order and international banks.
[11:53.120 --> 11:58.120]  And then they would mix in absurd things, you know, well, I mean, here's a clip.
[11:58.120 --> 12:02.120]  And there's been tens of thousands of things I've seen on television like this. You've all seen it.
[12:02.120 --> 12:05.120]  It's propaganda. You're being brainwashed.
[12:05.120 --> 12:12.120]  Not so funny today, though, when you realize that openly they're announcing a new bank of the world that you will pay your global carbon taxes to.
[12:12.120 --> 12:17.120]  So we've learned the new Bilderberg group agenda for 2009 and 2010.
[12:17.120 --> 12:19.120]  We'll go over that.
[12:19.120 --> 12:32.120]  Now, that dovetails with government ready youth core to take on veterans in the United States. No, I'm not kidding. You heard me a youth core under the federal government to take on U.S. veterans and gun owners.
[12:32.120 --> 12:36.120]  Remember the DHS report a few months ago we broke. People never believed me all the years I warned you.
[12:36.120 --> 12:43.120]  Now we have the declassified documents that their main buildup of Homeland Security is for the American people.
[12:43.120 --> 12:48.120]  It's all been set up for us if we don't like the foreign bankers bankrupting everything.
[12:48.120 --> 12:50.120]  But let's go ahead and play Archie Bunker.
[12:50.120 --> 12:56.120]  And in fact, I don't have the print out in front of me. What year is this Archie Bunker from?
[12:56.120 --> 12:59.120]  I know it was back in the 70s.
[12:59.120 --> 13:07.120]  Here is Archie Bunker back in the 1970s talking about international bankers and communists wanting our guns.
[13:07.120 --> 13:10.120]  Ha, ha, ha, isn't Archie Bunker an idiot.
[13:10.120 --> 13:20.120]  This is so that years later when they openly set it up, when you tried to fight back against it, your neighbors, most of you don't know why you laugh at people that talk about global cabals.
[13:20.120 --> 13:23.120]  Most of you don't know why you won't get involved in defending your country.
[13:23.120 --> 13:29.120]  You've been preconditioned tens of thousands of times by TV and culture that it's kooky to do so.
[13:29.120 --> 13:36.120]  They destroyed your natural defenses for sovereignty, for patriotism. They call it evil nationalism.
[13:36.120 --> 13:41.120]  Well, here they are making fun of Archie Bunker. He's the buffoon. He's the racist. He's the idiot.
[13:41.120 --> 13:44.120]  And how dare him not want to turn his guns in and have international bankers ruling.
[13:44.120 --> 13:46.120]  Last Saturday.
[13:46.120 --> 13:47.120]  Good evening, everybody.
[13:47.120 --> 13:56.120]  This is Archie Bunker of 704 Hauser Street, veteran of the big war, speaking on behalf of guns for everybody.
[13:56.120 --> 13:58.120]  Now, question.
[13:58.120 --> 14:02.120]  What was the first thing that the communists done when they took over Russia?
[14:02.120 --> 14:10.120]  Answer, gun control. And there's a lot of people in this country who want to do the same thing to us here in the kind of conspiracy seat.
[14:10.120 --> 14:19.120]  You're going to take your big international bankers. They want to, what do you call, masticate the people of this year's nation like puppets on the week.
[14:19.120 --> 14:23.120]  And then they're going to get that gun and take us over to the communists.
[14:23.120 --> 14:29.120]  Oh, I'm glad they put you on the stool. You look tall. You're sitting down.
[14:29.120 --> 14:35.120]  Now, I want to talk about another thing that's on everybody's mind today. And that's your stickups in your skyjackets.
[14:35.120 --> 14:40.120]  Which, if that was up to me, I could end the skyjackets tomorrow.
[14:40.120 --> 14:41.120]  You could?
[14:41.120 --> 14:47.120]  All you got to do is arm all your passengers.
[14:47.120 --> 14:52.120]  If he ain't got no more superior gravity there, he ain't going to dare to pull out no rod.
[14:52.120 --> 15:00.120]  And then your airlines, then they wouldn't have to safe the passengers on the ground no more. They just pass out the pistols at beginning of the trip.
[15:00.120 --> 15:03.120]  And then put them up and down at the end.
[15:03.120 --> 15:06.120]  Thanks, folks.
[15:06.120 --> 15:13.120]  All right, folks, we're going to come right back and analyze this brainwashing and take your phone calls and a lot more.
[15:13.120 --> 15:18.120]  But this is how programming works. This is how it's always worked.
[15:18.120 --> 15:24.120]  But, you know, in the states where they have said everybody can be armed with concealed carry crime rates go down on average 24%.
[15:24.120 --> 15:53.120]  So, actually, that sounds radical to gelded domesticated slaves, but not to everybody else. We'll be right back.
[15:54.120 --> 16:22.120]  Let's go.
[16:22.120 --> 16:28.120]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[16:28.120 --> 16:33.120]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[16:33.120 --> 16:39.120]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[16:39.120 --> 16:47.120]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpaste contain chemical additives such as sodium-loral sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[16:47.120 --> 16:51.120]  Did you know that many moldy vitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[16:51.120 --> 16:57.120]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers? Have you ever tested your body's pH level?

[17:33.120 --> 17:40.120]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[17:40.120 --> 17:48.120]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[17:48.120 --> 17:56.120]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[17:56.120 --> 18:01.120]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.

[20:49.120 --> 20:53.120]  We are back live. Thank you for joining us.
[20:53.120 --> 21:01.120]  Okay, I'm just going to go ahead and go to your phone calls. Eric and Walt and Steve and George and Bill and many others that are patiently holding us.

[21:08.120 --> 21:15.120]  And if you disagree with me, you're also welcome to call. Go to the head of the line as long as we can keep it civil here.
[21:15.120 --> 21:21.120]  Myself included. I have problems with that. 877-590-5525.
[21:21.120 --> 21:26.120]  And coming up, government readies at youth corps to take on vets.
[21:26.120 --> 21:30.120]  Ten minutes into Errant Mayhem in his town near the Mexican border.
[21:30.120 --> 21:34.120]  And a gunman, a disgruntled Iraq war veteran, has already taken out two people.
[21:34.120 --> 21:38.120]  One slumped at his desk. The other covered with blood on the floor.
[21:38.120 --> 21:44.120]  But here come the Boy Scouts under Homeland Security Command to seek and destroy and wipe out the vets.
[21:44.120 --> 21:49.120]  That's what the New York Times is reporting. And you know, this isn't just one little case of it.
[21:49.120 --> 21:53.120]  There's hundreds and hundreds I'm aware of. So I'm going to try to give folks the big picture.
[21:53.120 --> 21:57.120]  This happened in Germany. This happens in Russia. This happens in China.
[21:57.120 --> 22:01.120]  I'm going to break down. And folks are on infowars.com, you know, reading this article we wrote.
[22:01.120 --> 22:05.120]  Government readies, youth corps to take on vets.
[22:05.120 --> 22:12.120]  And they are saying, oh, look at these kids. They look like wimps. They'd be easy to wipe out.
[22:12.120 --> 22:18.120]  They're not coming today. They're training them when they're young and impressionable to turn them loose on you
[22:18.120 --> 22:24.120]  when they're 18 years old. Yes, we know at 14, they're not that formidable.
[22:24.120 --> 22:29.120]  The point is, in just a few years, they will be.
[22:29.120 --> 22:34.120]  They want them trained, but when they're still young and stupid at 18 and don't know what they're doing.
[22:34.120 --> 22:38.120]  And by the way, the government admits these are for the American people.
[22:38.120 --> 22:43.120]  Do you understand? This is serious. Okay, that's coming up. And then the latest on the Bilderberg group.
[22:43.120 --> 22:48.120]  Big developments there. The AP and Wall Street Journal and others finally reported on it.
[22:48.120 --> 22:53.120]  You never, never, never see mainstream reporting in the United States on the Bilderberg group.
[22:53.120 --> 22:57.120]  It was 130 world leaders meet and chart the course of the planet.
[22:57.120 --> 23:01.120]  But we made a big stink about it this year and AP and the Wall Street Journal reported on it.
[23:01.120 --> 23:05.120]  But the Wall Street Journal makes a joke out of it and says,
[23:05.120 --> 23:10.120]  the elite gather in Greece for a not so secret meeting and all what's the big deal?
[23:10.120 --> 23:14.120]  Yeah, you just said it didn't exist all these years and now it's not so secret.
[23:14.120 --> 23:19.120]  They just arrested more than a dozen members of the press, including London Guardian reporter.
[23:19.120 --> 23:26.120]  We're trying to get within two miles on public beaches and sidewalks of the hotel.
[23:26.120 --> 23:31.120]  I mean, this is amazing. What is this Russia or China? I guess it is.
[23:31.120 --> 23:37.120]  So we'll get to that coming up. Very, very important. Eric in California, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[23:37.120 --> 23:40.120]  Alex, how are you doing? Hey, buddy, welcome.
[23:40.120 --> 23:49.120]  Hey, great news, Alex. Late last year, I just worked for Dave Mustaine and Megadeth on their new studio.
[23:49.120 --> 23:57.120]  So I got to know Dave a little bit. I didn't, you know, try to press him for conversation, all that, but expected his time.
[23:57.120 --> 24:03.120]  But about a week and a half ago, I dropped by the studio and just kind of sat down with him for about a half hour
[24:03.120 --> 24:11.120]  and talked about various things. I had mentioned the fact that he'd been on your show interviewed by you
[24:11.120 --> 24:17.120]  and if you'd like to do it again. And he said he's got to talk to his manager and go through all the proper channels and whatnot.
[24:17.120 --> 24:25.120]  Maybe you might want to call him up, set that up, because they're getting ready to send out a new album this fall.
[24:25.120 --> 24:33.120]  And I had one more song to write and I asked him if she had seen a bomb deception yet and he hadn't, so I gave him a copy.
[24:33.120 --> 24:43.120]  I had some on my truck. I also gave him a copy of Freedom Fascism, 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Terror Storm, and Endgame.
[24:43.120 --> 24:51.120]  So sometime this week, I'm going to follow up with him and see if he'd like to collaborate on a project to reach out to youth,
[24:51.120 --> 24:56.120]  because this is something that's very, very deep in my heart.
[24:56.120 --> 25:02.120]  I had Dave Mustang on because the music is all about one world government, New World Order.
[25:02.120 --> 25:06.120]  And I remember listening to it in like Junior High, I'm pretty young, only 35.
[25:06.120 --> 25:13.120]  I remember listening to it being 12, 13, getting all pumped up, going out and having a fist fight down at the railroad tracks.
[25:13.120 --> 25:17.120]  But the point is, is I didn't really get what the songs were about. I just liked it.
[25:17.120 --> 25:21.120]  And years later, listening to it, it's all about the New World Order and all the album covers and everything.
[25:21.120 --> 25:26.120]  And yeah, when I had him on the show, he was well aware of a lot of that, so I would like to have Dave back on.
[25:26.120 --> 25:29.120]  Have you got any feedback from him since he saw the films?
[25:29.120 --> 25:36.120]  Not yet. He said he was going to watch a bomb deception that night and they might inspire his last song.
[25:36.120 --> 25:44.120]  So I'm definitely going to follow up. I've actually got some lyrical ideas that I'd like to bounce off of, but that's not why I went.
[25:44.120 --> 25:47.120]  I just want to talk to him and that's great.
[25:47.120 --> 25:51.120]  Well, listen, that's how we network. So stay in touch and I appreciate it, Bubba.
[25:51.120 --> 25:54.120]  I will keep you sure. Go ahead, Eric. What else?
[25:54.120 --> 25:57.120]  Absolutely. Yeah, you bet. I'll be talking to him this week.
[25:57.120 --> 26:02.120]  Hey, thanks a lot, man. I appreciate it. Yeah, you know the person I'm proudest of waking up is Bruce Willis.
[26:02.120 --> 26:07.120]  But Bruce is a private guy, so I'm not going to get into it or talk about it.
[26:07.120 --> 26:12.120]  But according to Bruce, you won't be seeing him work for the neocons anymore.
[26:12.120 --> 26:14.120]  He still doesn't like the Democrats.
[26:14.120 --> 26:17.120]  But, well, I can talk about what is known.
[26:17.120 --> 26:20.120]  I had Rick Linklater on about two years ago when a scanner darkly came out,
[26:20.120 --> 26:25.120]  filmed my men with Keanu Reeves, a well-known writer, and Woody Erlson, and Mr....
[26:25.120 --> 26:29.120]  Who's the guy from... I mean, I met him a bunch.
[26:29.120 --> 26:35.120]  No, I know Keanu good. I always have... I always call him Morton Downey Jr.
[26:35.120 --> 26:37.120]  Robert Downey Jr. is not Morton Downey Jr.
[26:37.120 --> 26:40.120]  The guy with the talk show in the 80s, screaming and people smoking cigarettes.
[26:40.120 --> 26:42.120]  Yeah, Robert Downey Jr.
[26:42.120 --> 26:46.120]  Anyways, I'm in that movie. Pretty big part, but anyway, side issue.
[26:46.120 --> 26:48.120]  I never tried to be in it. Rick Linklater is just a great guy.
[26:48.120 --> 26:50.120]  Well, I did try once I heard I had a chance to be in it.
[26:50.120 --> 26:52.120]  I said, absolutely put me in it.
[26:52.120 --> 26:55.120]  Great guy, Tommy Pilotta, and Rick Linklater put me in it.
[26:55.120 --> 26:58.120]  I don't want to talk about myself all day, so I want to hurry and get back to your call.
[26:58.120 --> 27:04.120]  But the point is, I had Rick on about two years ago to promote a scanner darkly.
[27:04.120 --> 27:06.120]  And I wasn't bringing up 9-11 to Rick.
[27:06.120 --> 27:10.120]  And he started saying, he thought 9-11 was an inside job on the air.
[27:10.120 --> 27:12.120]  A lot of courage, you know, big director.
[27:12.120 --> 27:17.120]  School of Iraq, days of confused, you know, list goes on and on.
[27:17.120 --> 27:21.120]  And so I had him on about that.
[27:21.120 --> 27:25.120]  And he said, yeah, I gave your videos to Bruce Willis.
[27:25.120 --> 27:28.120]  And he watched him and came back and he sent me some of the emails.
[27:28.120 --> 27:31.120]  Bruce had sent him saying, yeah, this has really woken me up.
[27:31.120 --> 27:33.120]  Now I understand the left-right paradigm.
[27:33.120 --> 27:35.120]  I understand both parties are controlled.
[27:35.120 --> 27:40.120]  And then I had a chance later to talk to...
[27:40.120 --> 27:43.120]  Well, I'm just going to leave it at that.
[27:43.120 --> 27:47.120]  The point is, I had a private conversation with somebody after that about six months later.
[27:47.120 --> 27:50.120]  And then people didn't believe Rick Linklater when he said it on air.
[27:50.120 --> 27:53.120]  The Neocon website said there's no way that's true.
[27:53.120 --> 27:55.120]  You know, Michelle Malkin and people.
[27:55.120 --> 28:01.120]  And then he was in Vanity Fair when a big movie came out about a year ago.
[28:01.120 --> 28:05.120]  And he said, yeah, the same people that killed Kennedy are running things today.
[28:05.120 --> 28:09.120]  And I don't believe in the left-right paradigm anymore and all this stuff.
[28:09.120 --> 28:12.120]  So that is very, very exciting.
[28:12.120 --> 28:15.120]  I mean, you know, I didn't get into this to meet Charlie Sheen,
[28:15.120 --> 28:16.120]  who I think is the coolest person in Hollywood.
[28:16.120 --> 28:17.120]  You've got to know him in person.
[28:17.120 --> 28:18.120]  I know him really well.
[28:18.120 --> 28:22.120]  You've got to know...
[28:22.120 --> 28:23.120]  Well, I'm not going to start dropping names.
[28:23.120 --> 28:27.120]  There's a lot of folks that are fans of the show that tune in and I talk to,
[28:27.120 --> 28:28.120]  that want to be private.
[28:28.120 --> 28:30.120]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[28:30.120 --> 28:31.120]  You know what?
[28:31.120 --> 28:32.120]  Let's go back to your calls.
[28:32.120 --> 28:33.120]  Walt in California.
[28:33.120 --> 28:34.120]  Walt, you're on the air.
[28:34.120 --> 28:35.120]  Go ahead.
[28:35.120 --> 28:36.120]  All right.
[28:36.120 --> 28:37.120]  Can you hear me okay, Alex?
[28:37.120 --> 28:38.120]  Yes, sir.
[28:38.120 --> 28:39.120]  I can.
[28:39.120 --> 28:40.120]  Welcome.
[28:40.120 --> 28:41.120]  You probably remember me.
[28:41.120 --> 28:49.120]  I marched with you in the cold, freezing rain in New York City with my brother, 9-1-1,
[28:49.120 --> 28:53.120]  bullhorning, and we bullhorned the Federal Reserve.
[28:53.120 --> 28:54.120]  That was 2007.
[28:54.120 --> 28:59.120]  We bullhorned the Federal Reserve, Larry Silverstein's building, the new building,
[28:59.120 --> 29:01.120]  and it was good to be there with you.
[29:01.120 --> 29:04.120]  It was so cold and you and I talked several times.
[29:04.120 --> 29:07.120]  We sat down and talked.
[29:07.120 --> 29:11.120]  We huddled up in the alleyway and kept each other warm.
[29:11.120 --> 29:12.120]  I'm just joking.
[29:12.120 --> 29:13.120]  Hey, hold on.
[29:13.120 --> 29:14.120]  Stay there.
[29:14.120 --> 29:15.120]  I'll come back to you, man.
[29:15.120 --> 29:16.120]  Hold on just a second.
[29:16.120 --> 29:17.120]  We've got to do the news here.
[29:17.120 --> 29:18.120]  It's very important.
[29:18.120 --> 29:19.120]  Important messages.
[29:19.120 --> 29:20.120]  Crafts, commercial messages.
[29:20.120 --> 29:21.120]  Straight ahead.
[29:21.120 --> 29:22.120]  Oldton Farrell.
[29:22.120 --> 29:23.120]  It's the G-Garden Letty Show.
[29:23.120 --> 29:24.120]  Say with us.
[29:24.120 --> 29:40.120]  Today, we cannot afford to ignore the current state of our country, the economy, job layoffs,
[29:40.120 --> 29:45.120]  mass foreclosures, and now we are all at risk of being exposed to this new flu pandemic.
[29:45.120 --> 29:50.120]  The Center for Disease Control has declared a public health emergency across the United
[29:50.120 --> 29:51.120]  States.

[30:34.120 --> 30:36.120]  Hi, this is Peter Cronch now with Midas Resources.
[30:36.120 --> 30:40.120]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[30:40.120 --> 30:43.120]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[30:43.120 --> 30:47.120]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention,
[30:47.120 --> 30:50.120]  more people will lose their jobs and worse their life savings.
[30:50.120 --> 30:54.120]  Having your hard earned money in banks, the stock market, or any other paper asset is
[30:54.120 --> 30:55.120]  a lose-lose deal.
[30:55.120 --> 30:59.120]  You'll lose on your capital investment and you'll lose purchasing power as the dollar
[30:59.120 --> 31:00.120]  continues to devalue.
[31:00.120 --> 31:04.120]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no
[31:04.120 --> 31:07.120]  matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[31:07.120 --> 31:10.120]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals,

[32:36.120 --> 32:40.120]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[32:40.120 --> 32:44.120]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[32:44.120 --> 32:49.120]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult

[33:34.120 --> 33:46.120]  The GCN Radio Network, providing the world with hard-hitting talk radio. GCN Great Talk Radio starts here.
[33:46.120 --> 33:52.120]  I can't get enough of that Jimi Hendrix and I think this song says it all.
[33:52.120 --> 34:03.120]  There must be some kind of way out of here. Say that jump up to the deep. There's too much confusion.
[34:03.120 --> 34:08.120]  Alright, I'm in a fun blitz and I'm getting into the most hardcore news I've covered in a while.
[34:08.120 --> 34:12.120]  I mean, I already knew they were training little kids in public school, the Boy Scouts and others,
[34:12.120 --> 34:16.120]  to take on American gun owners. I had that in government documents.
[34:16.120 --> 34:21.120]  But to have it right in the New York Times is just amazing with all these sickening photographs of it.
[34:21.120 --> 34:25.120]  I've had a breakdown of the 2009, 2010 Bilderberg Group agenda.
[34:25.120 --> 34:28.120]  And this is like looking into a crystal ball in the past.
[34:28.120 --> 34:33.120]  So you'll want to stay tuned for that to know what's coming up on the agenda of Spectre.
[34:33.120 --> 34:39.120]  That's the best way to describe it. The bad international private crime syndicate above governments.
[34:39.120 --> 34:42.120]  The only problem is the intelligence agencies work for Spectre.
[34:42.120 --> 34:48.120]  And they play the intelligence agencies off against the host nations and their own populations.
[34:48.120 --> 34:56.120]  That's the big mind trick. It is an MI6 and the KGB, the FSB today, that are fighting with each other.
[34:56.120 --> 35:00.120]  They work for Spectre, ladies and gentlemen. Truth is stranger than fiction.
[35:00.120 --> 35:03.120]  Call it the Bilderberg Group. Call it Spectre. Call it whatever you want.
[35:03.120 --> 35:06.120]  It's the global crime syndicate. It's the New World Order.
[35:06.120 --> 35:10.120]  Okay, Walt, I'll get serious here. Go ahead and make your point, sir.
[35:10.120 --> 35:21.120]  Okay. Alright, CPS came to our house on Mother's Day and stole our six-day-old baby away from us.
[35:21.120 --> 35:26.120]  Well, they've got quotas. I covered that last Thursday on the show. I'm sorry to hear that.
[35:26.120 --> 35:30.120]  They've got quotas. They do it outside the law. Tell us what happened.
[35:30.120 --> 35:41.120]  Well, what happened was there were absolute false allegations made against me concerning child custody
[35:41.120 --> 35:47.120]  for my wife's other two children from another husband, okay?
[35:47.120 --> 35:55.120]  And we were in Florida and her sister and her mother are completely insane.
[35:55.120 --> 36:00.120]  They tried to commit suicide multiple times. It's documented. It's proven.
[36:00.120 --> 36:06.120]  See, that's the problem. The state uses people tattling on each other and the TV shows and the sitcoms
[36:06.120 --> 36:10.120]  train people to tattle on each other and do this.
[36:10.120 --> 36:15.120]  The biggest culprits, the hospitals, they catch marijuana in your blood so they seize all your kids
[36:15.120 --> 36:19.120]  and they don't tell you that you were basically in a jail cell when you came in to have a baby
[36:19.120 --> 36:25.120]  and that it would all be used against you or your child falls off the jungle gym in front of witnesses
[36:25.120 --> 36:30.120]  and breaks a finger so they take them. But in the case of families ratting each other out,
[36:30.120 --> 36:34.120]  what the families don't know is when they make something up to get the children,
[36:34.120 --> 36:37.120]  most of the time the state doesn't give them the children to begin with.
[36:37.120 --> 36:42.120]  A lot of grandparents do this to get the kids and then they get freaked out when it doesn't happen.
[36:42.120 --> 36:45.120]  That's what it is. It's grandparents and the sister.
[36:45.120 --> 36:50.120]  But let me guess. Let me guess the sister and the grandkids haven't gotten the baby.
[36:50.120 --> 36:53.120]  Yeah, they got the baby now too.
[36:53.120 --> 36:57.120]  Well, listen, that's better than nothing. Usually they don't get the baby.
[36:57.120 --> 37:03.120]  No, they got them all. You don't get it. I mean, but they're horrible people, okay?
[37:03.120 --> 37:09.120]  And for them to be, for those children to be in their possession is worse than anything we could ever have.
[37:09.120 --> 37:13.120]  Well, listen, you just have to, you have to get a lawyer that's a specialist in this.
[37:13.120 --> 37:19.120]  I'm here and I'm sequestering help. I want to hire Harry Shapiro and Patrick Clancy.
[37:19.120 --> 37:22.120]  They're two experts, okay? I'm flat broke.
[37:22.120 --> 37:28.120]  I'm toss the kitty at yahoo.com and I'm my space toss the kitty.
[37:28.120 --> 37:33.120]  I'm the one that wrote the song 9-11 was an inside job, okay?
[37:33.120 --> 37:36.120]  I have been a longtime patriot.
[37:36.120 --> 37:41.120]  I'm, you know, the only thing that I'm guilty of was leaving my wife for another woman.
[37:41.120 --> 37:46.120]  I'm guilty of that, but I shouldn't lose my baby over this and we're destroyed.
[37:46.120 --> 37:47.120]  It's destroying us.
[37:47.120 --> 37:51.120]  Well, sir, sir, you don't want, listen, let me stop, okay? I appreciate your call, okay?
[37:51.120 --> 37:58.120]  I can sit here and I can take 150 phone calls straight every hour of people that just had their kids taken, okay?
[37:58.120 --> 38:02.120]  They take over a million children a year. Most of them don't even go to somebody else in the family.
[38:02.120 --> 38:09.120]  I understand that. I understand they wanted the other two kids and so now they've gotten your baby.
[38:09.120 --> 38:14.120]  And I understand it's criminal and it's sick. You're going to have to fight it out in the courts.
[38:14.120 --> 38:19.120]  And what's got to be defeated is these fake criminal family courts. Everybody's heard about them.
[38:19.120 --> 38:24.120]  Where the private adoption agencies and stuff get caught paying the judges under the table millions
[38:24.120 --> 38:27.120]  and where they have actual orders for blonde-haired and blue-eyed kids.
[38:27.120 --> 38:32.120]  I had a state senator on earlier this week covering it. We gave your thing out. I'd like to help you, sir.
[38:32.120 --> 38:38.120]  It's just that I know how this operates. It's why I cover it every week on the show.
[38:38.120 --> 38:44.120]  But it is an innumerable amount of people that we would have to help. We have to change the system.
[38:44.120 --> 38:48.120]  And I know you're wanting to hire some type of specialist lawyers or something.
[38:48.120 --> 38:58.120]  You need to get with the big think tanks and websites. They're experts on how to go after the criminal CPS system, okay?
[38:58.120 --> 39:03.120]  And so the way this criminal system works is it sides with whoever makes the false allegation.
[39:03.120 --> 39:09.120]  And the family courts aren't real courts, so you have trouble facing your own accuser and there's no judge or jury.
[39:09.120 --> 39:16.120]  All there is is a big fat pedophile judge nine times out of ten that's sitting there getting kickbacks on money for how many kids they grab.
[39:16.120 --> 39:20.120]  And I understand you're paying. It's hard for me to sit there and listen to it because it's very upsetting.
[39:20.120 --> 39:24.120]  That's why I cover it on the show every week. But all I can do is give out info.
[39:24.120 --> 39:27.120]  We're almost powerless when it comes to helping individuals.
[39:27.120 --> 39:35.120]  We've got to change the system. And if people wake up universally and realize what a criminal racket the family court system is,
[39:35.120 --> 39:41.120]  then we can start changing it. Let's talk to Steven in Texas. Steven, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[39:41.120 --> 39:46.120]  Yeah. Hey, good afternoon, Alex. First of all, two things I want to cover real quick.
[39:46.120 --> 39:51.120]  First of all, about the Boy Scouts. I was in the Boy Scouts for years.
[39:51.120 --> 40:00.120]  And I consider it no coincidence that now what you're bringing out about the Boy Scouts and what you brought out about Hitler's youth brigades,
[40:00.120 --> 40:08.120]  that our beloved governor, Rick Perry, not long ago, came out with a book promoting the Boy Scouts.
[40:08.120 --> 40:14.120]  So I don't consider that he was defending them against the homosexuals who were trained infiltrating them.
[40:14.120 --> 40:20.120]  But I see this as a deeper agenda where it's no coincidence that just not too long ago he came out of this book.
[40:20.120 --> 40:27.120]  In other words, to give a positive spin on the Boy Scouts in the direction they're going now. You see what I'm getting at?
[40:27.120 --> 40:36.120]  No. And again, the Boy Scouts admittedly were set up to train youth for military induction and for camping and preparation.
[40:36.120 --> 40:43.120]  They admit that. And that's fine and dandy. But what Hitler did in 1933 is they had the German Boy Scouts.
[40:43.120 --> 40:50.120]  That was the kinder folk. And this is mainline history for those that don't know. And I appreciate your call. It's a fine point.
[40:50.120 --> 40:53.120]  I'm going to start getting into that in the next segment.
[40:53.120 --> 40:58.120]  And they took over the Boy Scouts and at first had it just normal Boy Scouts and then turned it into paramilitary training.
[40:58.120 --> 41:06.120]  And then they set up the Hitler Eugen out of that. And just a few years later, those 12, 13, 14, 15 year olds in 1913,
[41:06.120 --> 41:18.120]  I mean, in 1933, by 1940, 1941, 42, with the war raging, you know, they were now 20, 21, 22 years old and were fully indoctrinated.
[41:18.120 --> 41:24.120]  And that's what this is all about. And that is what is happening here. You know, torture, secret arrest, youth brigades.
[41:24.120 --> 41:31.120]  But ladies and gentlemen, it's not just that. We now know what the global uniform is for these youth.
[41:31.120 --> 41:37.120]  And Barack Obama has released a secure core video with them doing military drills.
[41:37.120 --> 41:43.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is off the charts. It's up on infowars.com. You can see it right now.
[41:43.120 --> 41:46.120]  We're going to play the audio coming up in the next segment when I detail all of this.
[41:46.120 --> 41:57.120]  George in Texas. Oh, by the way, a Walt who called earlier, Walt send a e-mail to robd.infowars.com with all the facts of the case written out.
[41:57.120 --> 42:05.120]  Because just to come on here and kind of talk about what happened to you or to start naming people in an extended family.
[42:05.120 --> 42:11.120]  You know, I need to see the documentation first. I need to consider you as being a guest on the show.
[42:11.120 --> 42:19.120]  That's how we do that when we do shows on the CPS because it's a very, very, very serious situation.
[42:19.120 --> 42:25.120]  Okay, so I appreciate your call. Let's go ahead and talk to George in Texas. George, go ahead.
[42:25.120 --> 42:27.120]  Thank you, Alex. Thank you for making my call.
[42:27.120 --> 42:28.120]  Thank you.
[42:28.120 --> 42:36.120]  You know, the thing is, I talked to a few military and you know the thing is I started to find out that a lot of the children being taken are from
[42:36.120 --> 42:40.120]  fathers that are deployed overseas and they're not there to protect their homes.
[42:40.120 --> 42:47.120]  Yes, the CPS does take a lot of the military's children and the government recruiting arms are doing a lot of that.
[42:47.120 --> 42:54.120]  No, this is all folks, they make the troops pay for plane tickets in their back home and their meals when they're in hospitals.
[42:54.120 --> 42:59.120]  This government is degenerate but they wrap themselves in the flag and say, we're patriotic.
[42:59.120 --> 43:02.120]  Go along with the police state or you don't like the police and military.
[43:02.120 --> 43:06.120]  Police and military, you are dog meat to the New World Order.
[43:06.120 --> 43:11.120]  Henry Kissinger wrote a book calling you dumb animals.
[43:11.120 --> 43:16.120]  Yes, Mark. Alex, can I ask you one more thing? When are you going to get Mark Kornke on again?
[43:16.120 --> 43:21.120]  You know, I might get Mark on sometime. You know, we've had Mark on before. He hasn't invited me on his show, though.
[43:21.120 --> 43:27.120]  Listen, we're going to go ahead and go to break and come back with more phone calls.
[43:27.120 --> 43:32.120]  And I've always defended Mark and one day I heard him on the air with some call or horrible guy saying things about me.
[43:32.120 --> 43:34.120]  He didn't really defend me, so I've kind of gotten...

[46:33.120 --> 46:36.120]  Americans, do you know where your food comes from?
[46:36.120 --> 46:38.120]  Is it safe, secure and healthy?
[46:38.120 --> 46:42.120]  Did you know most of our food is now contaminated with genetically modified ingredients?
[46:42.120 --> 46:47.120]  We at Baker Creek heirloom seed company have been helping people get pure garden seed for 12 years
[46:47.120 --> 46:51.120]  and carry over 1200 varieties of GMO free heirloom seed.

[46:55.120 --> 46:57.120]  That's rareseeds.com.
[46:57.120 --> 47:02.120]  Baker Creek heirloom seed company was started in 1998 by a 17-year-old as a hobby.
[47:02.120 --> 47:06.120]  It was developed out of a passion for preserving our vegetable heritage.
[47:06.120 --> 47:09.120]  The company now offers the largest selection of pure heirloom seeds
[47:09.120 --> 47:12.120]  strive every year to bring back varieties like our forefathers grew.
[47:12.120 --> 47:16.120]  In times like these, we can't trust the government to keep our seeds safe.
[47:16.120 --> 47:21.120]  Every year at Baker Creek, we work to preserve the best of the oldest for future gardeners.

[47:30.120 --> 47:57.120]  That's rareseeds.com.
[48:00.120 --> 48:05.120]  There's all these idiots that say, they're all caught or they can't have rights.
[48:05.120 --> 48:10.120]  You know, they're now saying in all the big court cases that U.S. citizens don't have rights
[48:10.120 --> 48:14.120]  and they're going to use and are using all the anti-terror laws, the American people.
[48:14.120 --> 48:19.120]  And all the major training manuals are about gun owners, conservatives and veterans, dummies.
[48:19.120 --> 48:24.120]  They get you sold on it for foreign cave dwellers and saying,
[48:24.120 --> 48:30.120]  yeah, take them, you know, A-Rab's rights, they're not A-Rabs, they live in Central Asia.
[48:30.120 --> 48:33.120]  Take their rights when it's really for you.
[48:33.120 --> 48:40.120]  Those Central Asians work for the CIA against the Serbs, against the Russians.
[48:40.120 --> 48:44.120]  You were set up. You were the target's dumb-dumbs.
[48:44.120 --> 48:51.120]  The free market, our free society, our private property was the target.
[48:51.120 --> 48:55.120]  Look at these headlines. AmeriCorps, paramilitary propaganda ad.
[48:55.120 --> 49:00.120]  Wait till you hear the audio from this in the videos, even more incredible.
[49:00.120 --> 49:04.120]  Obama continues torture and torture-related murder in the bogus war on terror.
[49:04.120 --> 49:09.120]  Another story about Kurt Nemo up on infowars.com and Prisciplina.com.
[49:09.120 --> 49:13.120]  And Bilderberg wants global Department of Health and global Treasury Department.
[49:13.120 --> 49:17.120]  We're going to go over all of this coming up in the next hour.
[49:17.120 --> 49:21.120]  But right now, back to the phone calls.
[49:21.120 --> 49:24.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt.
[49:24.120 --> 49:28.120]  And Matt, where are you calling us from?
[49:28.120 --> 49:29.120]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me okay?
[49:29.120 --> 49:31.120]  Yeah, where are you calling us from?
[49:31.120 --> 49:32.120]  I'm Missouri, sir.
[49:32.120 --> 49:34.120]  Okay, welcome to the airwaves.
[49:34.120 --> 49:35.120]  Yeah, thank you.
[49:35.120 --> 49:40.120]  I'd like to read you two passages that describe everything that you do
[49:40.120 --> 49:44.120]  and what we all need to do in our fight against evil in the New World Order.
[49:44.120 --> 49:49.120]  And the first one here is Ephesians 6, verse 10, Armor of God.
[49:49.120 --> 49:53.120]  Finally, be strong in the Lord and his mighty power.
[49:53.120 --> 49:59.120]  Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
[49:59.120 --> 50:05.120]  For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against authorities,
[50:05.120 --> 50:11.120]  against the powers of darkness world, and against the spiritual forces of evil and the heavenly realms.
[50:11.120 --> 50:14.120]  Now, how does that combine with Romans 13?
[50:14.120 --> 50:17.120]  They take out of context and say all governments of God do whatever it says.
[50:17.120 --> 50:21.120]  Then the founding fathers were wrong to rebel against King George III.
[50:21.120 --> 50:23.120]  We were wrong in the 40s to rebel against Hitler.
[50:23.120 --> 50:26.120]  We were wrong to rebel against Napoleon.
[50:26.120 --> 50:31.120]  But no, the entire Bible is about standing up against wicked government.
[50:31.120 --> 50:34.120]  Again, give folks that famous verse again.
[50:34.120 --> 50:42.120]  Ephesians 6, verse 10, and another one that describes why we need to fight these people
[50:42.120 --> 50:46.120]  and why they're in the positions that they are and why they worship Lucifer,
[50:46.120 --> 50:49.120]  would be Luke 4, verses 5, which I'm sure you've heard before.
[50:49.120 --> 50:52.120]  And this is when Christ is being tempted in the wilderness.
[50:52.120 --> 50:54.120]  The devil leads them up.
[50:54.120 --> 50:55.120]  So get behind me, Satan.
[50:55.120 --> 50:59.120]  He offers him the whole world, all the kingdoms that work for him.
[50:59.120 --> 51:03.120]  But according to Romans 13, out of context, Jesus should have hit his knees and said,
[51:03.120 --> 51:06.120]  Hail Satan, because I've got to follow the will of God.
[51:06.120 --> 51:08.120]  All government is of the Lord.
[51:08.120 --> 51:10.120]  Hence Satan is God of this world.
[51:10.120 --> 51:13.120]  Hail Satan! Hail Satan! Hail Satan!
[51:13.120 --> 51:17.120]  All the Baptists and all the Catholics all hit their knees under Romans 13.
[51:17.120 --> 51:23.120]  The favorite verse taught everywhere as the federal government takes over all the major denominations.
[51:23.120 --> 51:25.120]  Hail Satan! Hail Satan!
[51:25.120 --> 51:27.120]  No, don't shout at the devil.
[51:27.120 --> 51:29.120]  Worship the devil because it's of the Lord.
[51:29.120 --> 51:35.120]  He's the God of this world and nothing bites like I do.
[51:35.120 --> 51:39.120]  Nothing screams out loud in the dark of night.
[51:39.120 --> 51:41.120]  I'm sorry, sir, go ahead.
[51:41.120 --> 51:43.120]  Absolutely.
[51:43.120 --> 51:48.120]  It says over and over in the Bible how that Satan is the prince of this world
[51:48.120 --> 51:51.120]  and he can give these people a bow down.
[51:51.120 --> 51:54.120]  And it's of the Lord to bow down to the government.
[51:54.120 --> 51:59.120]  No, it's the good Lord. They don't listen.
[51:59.120 --> 52:01.120]  Don't listen to the caller, people.
[52:01.120 --> 52:03.120]  No, no, no, it's the government.
[52:03.120 --> 52:05.120]  You'll go to hell if you do.
[52:05.120 --> 52:11.120]  The Christians were evil that didn't bow to Caesar, that he burned at the stake in the Coliseum.
[52:11.120 --> 52:13.120]  They were bad.
[52:13.120 --> 52:15.120]  Don't listen.
[52:15.120 --> 52:17.120]  I'll quit being sarcastic. Go ahead, sir.
[52:17.120 --> 52:21.120]  If I could, I'll just finish Ephesians 6.
[52:21.120 --> 52:23.120]  No, no, don't read it.
[52:23.120 --> 52:25.120]  Bible verses are evil.
[52:25.120 --> 52:27.120]  The government says don't read it.
[52:27.120 --> 52:29.120]  You've got to follow what the government says.
[52:29.120 --> 52:31.120]  Romans 13, don't, don't.
[52:31.120 --> 52:33.120]  Go ahead and read both verses.
[52:33.120 --> 52:36.120]  The earlier Ephesians and the next one because I've been interrupting.
[52:36.120 --> 52:38.120]  You want me to start over?
[52:38.120 --> 52:43.120]  Start over, yes. Start over with blasphemy according to the government-run churches that say bow down to government.
[52:43.120 --> 52:46.120]  This is blasphemy and heresy.
[52:46.120 --> 52:51.120]  You're all about to hear right now because the church has turned into a government-paid operation
[52:51.120 --> 52:53.120]  and that is of the Lord.
[52:53.120 --> 52:56.120]  This caller is evil that's calling in.
[52:56.120 --> 52:58.120]  Go ahead, evil caller.
[52:58.120 --> 53:00.120]  Okay.
[53:00.120 --> 53:02.120]  Be strong in the Lord and his mighty power.
[53:02.120 --> 53:06.120]  Put on the full armor of God for you to stand against the devil's schemes.
[53:06.120 --> 53:09.120]  For our power is not against flesh and blood,
[53:09.120 --> 53:13.120]  but against the rulers, against authorities, against the powers of this dark world,
[53:13.120 --> 53:16.120]  and against the spiritual forces of evil and heavenly realms.
[53:16.120 --> 53:21.120]  Therefore, put on the full armor of God so that when the day of evil comes,
[53:21.120 --> 53:27.120]  you may be able to stand your ground after what you have done everything.
[53:27.120 --> 53:29.120]  Day of evil? I'm going to be raptured.
[53:29.120 --> 53:31.120]  I don't have to fight evil.
[53:31.120 --> 53:35.120]  Of course, there's nowhere in the Bible that there'll be a pre-rapture, but so what?
[53:35.120 --> 53:39.120]  I'm supposed to lay down. Stop reading that Bible. It's evil.
[53:39.120 --> 53:42.120]  The churches say that we should bow down to the leaders of the world.
[53:42.120 --> 53:45.120]  Continue, heretic.
[53:45.120 --> 53:49.120]  Stand firm then with the belt of truth buckled around your waist.
[53:49.120 --> 53:52.120]  Breast faith of righteousness.
[53:52.120 --> 53:57.120]  Stand with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes with the gospel of peace.
[53:57.120 --> 54:04.120]  Take up the shield of faith and extinguish all flaming arrows of the evil ones.
[54:04.120 --> 54:10.120]  Take the helmet of salvation and the spirit which is the word of God.
[54:10.120 --> 54:15.120]  No, no, don't do it. Romans 13, submit to the government.
[54:15.120 --> 54:19.120]  Do what they say. Don't listen to Matt.
[54:19.120 --> 54:22.120]  And the devil, and this is Luke 4 verses 5.
[54:22.120 --> 54:24.120]  Oh, not another one.
[54:24.120 --> 54:25.120]  Go ahead.
[54:25.120 --> 54:30.120]  The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world.
[54:30.120 --> 54:37.120]  And he said to him, I will give you all the authority and splendor for it has been given to me
[54:37.120 --> 54:40.120]  and I can give it to anyone who I want.
[54:40.120 --> 54:46.120]  So if you worship me, it shall all be yours.
[54:46.120 --> 54:49.120]  Why not turn this bread into stones into bread?
[54:49.120 --> 54:53.120]  Why not jump off and have the angels lift you up?
[54:53.120 --> 54:56.120]  Do not tempt the Lord that God get behind me, Satan.
[54:56.120 --> 54:59.120]  But see, according to Romans 13, misinterpretation, he should have hit his knees
[54:59.120 --> 55:02.120]  and said all government is by the authority of God.
[55:02.120 --> 55:05.120]  Hence, he should have hit his knees and Jesus should have held Satan.
[55:05.120 --> 55:09.120]  But see, that's how blasphemous Romans 13 is if you're a Christian.
[55:09.120 --> 55:12.120]  But even if you're not a Christian, folks, just a sociologist,
[55:12.120 --> 55:16.120]  you understand that all the major churches of the world are now under government finance,
[55:16.120 --> 55:21.120]  government payoffs, or government 501c3 status,
[55:21.120 --> 55:26.120]  and they literally get up there and spew under the clergy response teams,
[55:26.120 --> 55:29.120]  pure government propaganda when the First Amendment says
[55:29.120 --> 55:33.120]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
[55:33.120 --> 55:35.120]  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[55:35.120 --> 55:40.120]  We were the first country to say the government isn't going to run religion,
[55:40.120 --> 55:42.120]  which is exactly what Jesus said.
[55:42.120 --> 55:44.120]  So they twist all of this.
[55:44.120 --> 55:47.120]  I appreciate your call. It's good to hear from you, my friend.
[55:47.120 --> 55:49.120]  And of course, I'm being sarcastic through all of that.
[55:49.120 --> 55:52.120]  I mean, to say that we should go along with whatever government says
[55:52.120 --> 55:56.120]  is a giant, stinking lie.
[55:56.120 --> 55:58.120]  Look at the Christians in Rome and the Colosseum.
[55:58.120 --> 56:01.120]  Look at all the prophets being killed or imprisoned.
[56:01.120 --> 56:03.120]  Look at Jesus.
[56:03.120 --> 56:06.120]  But again, the salt of the earth Christians are supposed to be involved.
[56:06.120 --> 56:10.120]  You know, the government said slavery was the law in 1800,
[56:10.120 --> 56:13.120]  and Christians with the abolitionists wouldn't go along with it,
[56:13.120 --> 56:16.120]  and they broke the law to save blacks and others.
[56:16.120 --> 56:20.120]  They broke the law, you know, when it was illegal to protect slaves,
[56:20.120 --> 56:22.120]  and they went and said, no to the government.
[56:22.120 --> 56:24.120]  We're going to change this, but not according to Romans 13.
[56:24.120 --> 56:27.120]  We should still have blacks pulling plows out there right now.
[56:27.120 --> 56:30.120]  This is how sick you are to go to these devil churches.
[56:30.120 --> 56:35.120]  With their big mollusks, steeples in there, and their fallacies to, you know,
[56:35.120 --> 56:37.120]  to the sun out there.
[56:37.120 --> 56:39.120]  Just go worship your son.
[56:39.120 --> 56:41.120]  Your 666.
[56:41.120 --> 56:44.120]  Look, he with understanding, let him reckon the number.
[56:44.120 --> 56:45.120]  Captain Cook.
[56:45.120 --> 56:53.120]  Captain Cook, did you, did you sail and discover the botany bay there, Captain?
[56:53.120 --> 56:56.120]  You're on the air, sir. Go ahead.
[56:56.120 --> 56:58.120]  Actually, sir, that's Captain Cook,
[56:58.120 --> 57:00.120]  an American politically incorrect superhero,
[57:00.120 --> 57:06.120]  and a fight in the New World odor since 1989.
[57:06.120 --> 57:09.120]  And I just wanted to say that, you know, Archie Bunker,
[57:09.120 --> 57:12.120]  being portrayed as a bad guy when early he's the good guy,
[57:12.120 --> 57:16.120]  is just a small sample of the cancer that started back in the 70s,
[57:16.120 --> 57:19.120]  and this worked its way up to being a big cancer.
[57:19.120 --> 57:23.120]  No, the government's good. Oh, please.
[57:23.120 --> 57:25.120]  Sir, you want to be damned to hell?
[57:25.120 --> 57:28.120]  You better worship government, boy, you'll lose your salvation.
[57:28.120 --> 57:31.120]  I know, I'm al-Qaeda. You know what can I say?
[57:31.120 --> 57:35.120]  I don't, I think the government's a bunch of rogue criminals.
[57:35.120 --> 57:39.120]  Oh, no, don't say it.
[57:39.120 --> 57:41.120]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[57:41.120 --> 57:44.120]  No, it's okay. No, I think the government's a bunch of rogue criminals.
[57:44.120 --> 57:46.120]  No, I don't think it. Alex, I know it.
[57:46.120 --> 57:51.120]  I think what we call television nowadays is a great waste of time.
[57:51.120 --> 57:53.120]  No, it's good for your brain.
[57:53.120 --> 57:58.120]  Don't Google television, television Alzheimer's with all the thousands of studies
[57:58.120 --> 58:01.120]  that it literally rots your brain. It's good. Watch more.
[58:01.120 --> 58:04.120]  Drink more fluoride water. Take more flu shots.
[58:04.120 --> 58:07.120]  No, no, Captain Cook, you are a cook.
[58:07.120 --> 58:13.120]  Turn your firearms in. The founding fathers were against firearms.
[58:13.120 --> 58:17.120]  Anything else, Captain Crunch, or Cook, or whatever your name is?
[58:17.120 --> 58:19.120]  Cook, uh, what do you call him?
[58:19.120 --> 58:23.120]  Great superhero. Well, your phone's cutting out, Captain Cook.
[58:23.120 --> 58:52.120]  We'll be right back.
[58:53.120 --> 58:57.120]  We, the people, grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers
[58:57.120 --> 59:01.120]  to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest,
[59:01.120 --> 59:03.120]  forcing taxes to serve as debt.
[59:03.120 --> 59:06.120]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank
[59:06.120 --> 59:10.120]  issuing the public currency as a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[59:24.120 --> 59:29.120]  Here we go.
[59:29.120 --> 59:34.120]  Have you ever noticed that celebrities are endorsing weight loss products and health aids?
[59:34.120 --> 59:37.120]  Do you think they endorse these products for free?
[59:37.120 --> 59:43.120]  I don't think so. I'm here to tell you, I'm not a celebrity, and life change tea doesn't need one.
[59:43.120 --> 59:48.120]  Think about this. The product speaks for itself. What a concept!

[1:00:23.120 --> 1:00:27.120]  And the city of San Marcos implements new rules.
[1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:32.120]  This is the GCN Radio Network. Home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[1:00:32.120 --> 1:00:36.120]  Radio 590-KLBJ Austin.
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:40.120]  Fox News Radio. I'm Ron Flatter.
[1:00:40.120 --> 1:00:44.120]  Pomp and Circumstance. Caps and gowns. Protests and arrests.
[1:00:44.120 --> 1:00:50.120]  The scene at the University of Notre Dame today where President Obama became a lightning rod just for being there.
[1:00:50.120 --> 1:00:54.120]  The Bones of Contention. Abortion and stem cell research.
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:58.120]  We get this live report from South Bend, Indiana. Fox News Radio's Jennifer Kuiper.
[1:00:58.120 --> 1:01:03.120]  Ron, the president jokes about one controversial issue. Honorary degrees saying he's only one for two as president.
[1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:06.120]  But a more serious tone on the subject of abortion.
[1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:15.120]  When we open up our hearts and our minds to those who may not think precisely like we do or believe precisely what we believe.
[1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:19.120]  That's when we discover at least the possibility of common ground.
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:26.120]  He also mentioned embryonic stem cell research. Some non-student hecklers in the crowd were quickly escorted out of the Joyce Center arena.
[1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:30.120]  A couple dozen protesters have been arrested on campus for trespassing. Ron?
[1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:36.120]  A call for President Obama to reconsider his plans to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
[1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:40.120]  Especially if it means moving terrorist suspects where they're not wanted.
[1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:45.120]  It's been a position stated by some in the administration that there's no problem in incarcerating terrorists here.
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:51.120]  It is a problem. It makes whatever town that has the terrorist a potential target for terrorists.
[1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:54.120]  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Fox News Sunday.
[1:01:54.120 --> 1:01:59.120]  Democratic Congressman Peter King of New York concedes the shutdown of Guantanamo should at least wait.
[1:01:59.120 --> 1:02:02.120]  There's going to be other cases. I don't even know if the tribunals are working.
[1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:09.120]  That's why the reports coming out of the administration, there could be up to 50 of these detainees who are very violent, very dangerous,
[1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:14.120]  but there may not be enough evidence and the government may be looking for a form of preventive detention.
[1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:22.120]  King today on CBS's Face the Nation, Attorney General Eric Holder last week said dangerous prisoners would not be released in the United States.
[1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:31.120]  The price of gasoline rising 25 cents a gallon the past three weeks. The Lundberg survey saying unleaded averaging 230 a gallon nationwide.
[1:02:31.120 --> 1:02:34.120]  You're listening to Fox News Radio, fair and balanced.
[1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:43.120]  News Radio 590 KLBJ, it's 502. I'm Sarah Hutterberg, topping Austin's news.
[1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:53.120]  Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo tells East Austin residents during a community meeting that the department continues to investigate Monday's police-involved fatal shooting of an 18-year-old.
[1:02:53.120 --> 1:03:01.120]  Officer Lenny Contano was the shooter in the incident, saying the two men, Nathaniel Saunders and Sir Smith, made threatening moves toward him.
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:10.120]  However, he did not turn on his dashcam video at the scene. Chief Acevedo says he is taking that into consideration during the ongoing investigation.
[1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:18.120]  Maybe he screwed up completely. Maybe he didn't. I can tell you that he screwed up with that camera. I wasn't on and I got a problem with that.
[1:03:18.120 --> 1:03:24.120]  Chief Acevedo says the investigation will take between 60 to 90 days. Emily Trubb News Radio 590 KLBJ.
[1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:29.120]  The city of San Marcos is implementing new rules for noise in their city's neighborhoods.
[1:03:29.120 --> 1:03:35.120]  Assistant Police Chief Lisa Dvorak says the new rules are a response to 2,700 noise complaints last year.
[1:03:35.120 --> 1:03:46.120]  You're going to have a gathering. There are things that you can do to keep the noise down and still have a really great time and have your friends over and enjoy being able to socialize and have people at your house.
[1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:54.120]  Dvorak says the new rules allow officers to use their judgment about whether the level of noise at neighborhood parties or gatherings is excessive.
[1:03:54.120 --> 1:04:00.120]  Some federal tax hikes under consideration are raising the ire of the Chairman of the Texas Workforce Commission.
[1:04:00.120 --> 1:04:06.120]  Tom Pawkin is calling the proposed tax hikes on the U.S. energy industry a job killer for Texas.
[1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:19.120]  More than 100,000 Texans are currently employed in energy-related fields as oil and gas extraction, petroleum and coal products manufacturing, along with pipeline transportation.
[1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:27.120]  Pawkin says the energy industry can help lead Texas out of the economic recession, but not if taxes are raised that push those employers out of business.
[1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:30.120]  Diane Hodgeson is Radio 590 KLBJ.
[1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:38.120]  The KLBJ radar weather watch calls for lows dropping to 54 tonight. Right now, 75 degrees. I'm Sarah Hudaberg.
[1:04:38.120 --> 1:04:40.120]  KLBJ news time is 504.
[1:04:40.120 --> 1:04:45.120]  Through the rest of the day, we'll continue with clouds and 77 tonight clear, 54.
[1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:58.120]  Belly up to the bar and let's talk. Jeff Ward, three to seven on News Radio 590 KLBJ.
[1:04:58.120 --> 1:05:06.120]  Do you trust electronic payments? If not, you should. For years, writing checks was considered the safest way to send and receive payments.
[1:05:06.120 --> 1:05:20.120]  But every check you write has your name, address and account number printed right on it. With an average of eight people touching your checks during the clearing process and identity theft on the rise, it's time to reconsider the way you pay and get paid.
[1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:30.120]  Direct deposit and direct payment are safe and reliable. Payments are made automatically on a predetermined date and flow through a secure encrypted network and they're environmentally friendly too.
[1:05:30.120 --> 1:05:34.120]  Ask for direct deposit at work if it's not currently offered.
[1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:46.120]  HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide to better serve our customers. Our goal is to get these fine hemp products to you in the least amount of time so you can enjoy what the powder seeds and oil can do for you.

[1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:29.120]  877-590-5525.
[1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:40.120]  We're going to get into the Gilderberg group and what their agenda. We'll learn more over the weekend from Greece, suburb of Athens. They're on the coastline. We're the world leaders met.
[1:07:40.120 --> 1:07:46.120]  We'll give you the boil down of that. Coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[1:07:46.120 --> 1:07:52.120]  Don't forget my websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[1:07:52.120 --> 1:07:59.120]  Prisonplanet.tv is our member site and was five years up and running all of my films.
[1:07:59.120 --> 1:08:08.120]  And then, of course, we simulcast with my live TV show during the radio show during the weekday transmission.
[1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:20.120]  And my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other films are posted there at prisonplanet.tv and your prisonplanet.tv membership also makes much of what we do here in my media organization possible.
[1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:23.120]  So I want to thank all the prisonplanet.tv members out there.
[1:08:23.120 --> 1:08:31.120]  Also, I'm going to start every month churning out DVDs that are more presentations, not films.
[1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:38.120]  I'm going to try to make three films a year instead of two films a year and every month or two, probably stagger it.
[1:08:38.120 --> 1:08:42.120]  I'd say every five, six weeks on average, a presentation.
[1:08:42.120 --> 1:08:51.120]  And one of those is the Aaron Russo interview I did shortly before he died in 2007, the last videotaped interview that we know of that's out there.
[1:08:51.120 --> 1:08:53.120]  Most of it's on the web for free. We put it out.
[1:08:53.120 --> 1:09:02.120]  But this is an updated version with some commentary by myself with the latest developments and some of the interview that we didn't put out on the Internet.
[1:09:02.120 --> 1:09:07.120]  That is now available on DVD at infowars.com and everybody's library needs to have it.
[1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:20.120]  Also, every month we're going to have a best of from the TV show we do while we simulcast the radio show with the ads cut out and any extra stuff cut out, shot in high def, burned to one high quality DVD.
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:26.120]  This month's has Alan Watt, police chief in Austin, Art Acevedo.
[1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:34.120]  Of course, the UFC host and movie star and TV host in his own right, Joe Rogan.
[1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:40.120]  It's got folks in it like Mr. David Ike and a lot more.
[1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:42.120]  So the first month of that is now out.
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:44.120]  I'm going to have a best of every month.
[1:09:44.120 --> 1:09:52.120]  We call it the DVD arsenal also available there at the online video and bookstore at infowars.com.
[1:09:52.120 --> 1:09:55.120]  Okay, let me just stop right there and get focused.
[1:09:55.120 --> 1:10:03.120]  I tend to psychologically shy away from getting into this because it's such a upsetting subject and so real.
[1:10:03.120 --> 1:10:11.120]  I want to start out with the audio of the one minute government paid for video that we have up on infowars.com.
[1:10:11.120 --> 1:10:17.120]  This is AmeriCorps paramilitary propaganda ad.
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:24.120]  And when you watch this ad and you study it, it's absolutely horrifying when you have the background knowledge of what you're witnessing.
[1:10:24.120 --> 1:10:32.120]  It's even more horrifying, but anybody can watch this and say, what is this straight out of Soviet Russia or communist China?
[1:10:32.120 --> 1:10:37.120]  I would say it's more akin to communist China or Cuba, communist Cuba.
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:41.120]  Now this uniform they're wearing, I saw different bills.
[1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:45.120]  Bill Clinton got passed to start this in 1997.
[1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:52.120]  I talked about it in my film, Police State 2000 in 1998, 99.
[1:10:52.120 --> 1:11:00.120]  But in some of the legislation they've passed, it says gray uniforms and we have seen those and that's going to be for more of the paramilitaries.
[1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:04.120]  They're the cream of the youth course.
[1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:19.120]  Then the next category are going to wear red jackets with khaki shirts and khaki pants that looks like something out of a science fiction dystopia.
[1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:23.120]  And I know this because in the U.S. we first learned this about seven, eight years ago.
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:25.120]  In England we learned this two years ago.
[1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:30.120]  We're also doing it in Japan, in Germany, in the Netherlands, in Ireland.
[1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:35.120]  And they're doing it with the Boy Scouts overseas, the Boy Scouts here.
[1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:38.120]  They're doing it with Secure Corps, Division of AmeriCorps.
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:46.120]  They're doing it with public school children putting them in uniforms,
[1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:55.120]  but only on the weekends when they take part in federally funded, under BATF, FBI grants, you name it.
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:12:00.120]  And so when I saw this video this morning put out by the federal government with taxpayer money,
[1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:09.120]  it shows them doing push-ups and squat thrust and basic military maneuvers out in a military training field with officers in front of them
[1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:16.120]  and their new fascist uniforms with arm patches, arm bands. I mean it doesn't get any worse than this.
[1:12:16.120 --> 1:12:22.120]  And it horrified me because I keep seeing this same uniform pop up worldwide. This is global.
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:26.120]  So ladies and gentlemen, here is the audio of the video.
[1:12:26.120 --> 1:12:43.120]  We are Scouts Club. I am changed. I've been around since the beginning of time.
[1:12:43.120 --> 1:12:52.120]  Over the years I've had many faces. Over the years I've had many looks.
[1:12:52.120 --> 1:13:01.120]  But I've always had the same goals. To make this world a better place by helping those who need it most.
[1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:10.120]  To never turn my back when things get tough. And to show that positive can always overpower negative.
[1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:17.120]  That's enough. I can't listen anymore of it. Yeah, positive. That means I don't think I'm just positive and follow orders.
[1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:23.120]  And they show pictures of Martin Luther King and Gandhi. Martin Luther King and Gandhi would have fought against what's happening right now.
[1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:30.120]  You better believe it. So this is almost like if the Nazis rolled themselves in happy, lovey, liberal packaging.
[1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:38.120]  But when you study what the actual training is, it's to spy on neighbors. It's to have a national security force as big and strong as our military.
[1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:43.120]  And then you read specifically what the White House says. It's going to be compulsory at military camps.
[1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:52.120]  Rahm Emanuel is on record. It's been at change.gov. But they're in uniforms chanting and marching and with flags and out there drilling.
[1:13:52.120 --> 1:14:02.120]  I mean, it's a field marshal basically running it. All of this going on. And this is just the public face of it to sell the population.
[1:14:02.120 --> 1:14:06.120]  When you get down to the nitty gritty, it's what the New York Times reported on.
[1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:14.120]  But again, they reported it with a positive light as well with showing big color photos of 14 to 17-year-old Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts,
[1:14:14.120 --> 1:14:21.120]  marching around with MP5 submachine guns, practicing, quote, taking on U.S. veterans.
[1:14:21.120 --> 1:14:28.120]  And then you see all the mainstream articles over the last few years about how they're training every local department in the country, the feds are,
[1:14:28.120 --> 1:14:36.120]  to prepare for improvised explosive devices and they're telling local police, harden your local facilities, get ready for terrorism.
[1:14:36.120 --> 1:14:40.120]  The number one threat is in Al Qaeda now. It's former military people and gun owners.
[1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:48.120]  And the DHS report says that and libertarians and don't tread on me people and folks that won't turn their guns in.
[1:14:48.120 --> 1:14:55.120]  And then you find out that under Secure Corps, and I first saw this seven years ago in the Philadelphia Daily News,
[1:14:55.120 --> 1:15:03.120]  it said, a division of AmeriCorps that you just heard the ad from, well, they're not marching around in red uniforms.
[1:15:03.120 --> 1:15:10.120]  You know, what is this, Mortal Kombat or something? And they're almost dressed like the bad guy from Mortal Kombat.
[1:15:10.120 --> 1:15:16.120]  I mean, this is really, these are actual commie outfits. I mean, talk about, this is unbelievable.
[1:15:16.120 --> 1:15:19.120]  I mean, I was a little like leather jackets and leather ball caps or something.
[1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:26.120]  I mean, it's just out of control. Armbands, a whole nine yards. And the young, stupid kids love this, folks.
[1:15:26.120 --> 1:15:32.120]  They love playing with guns. They love being able to march around and drill. They love being made to feel important.
[1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:36.120]  And so they're now launching this with millions of youth nationwide.
[1:15:36.120 --> 1:15:41.120]  That means within two years they'll be ready to move against the population. Four years, really ready to move.
[1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:46.120]  And you watch when Barack Obama leaves in four to eight years, the next president, whether it's a Republican or Democrat,
[1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:53.120]  they're going to expand it because the presidents are now just frontmen and puppets.
[1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:58.120]  So I want to give you some of the background of this, but have you noticed it's not ITT technical anymore?
[1:15:58.120 --> 1:16:04.120]  It's ITT law enforcement, security guards training. It's not how to fix computers. It's not how to make computers.
[1:16:04.120 --> 1:16:11.120]  It's how to be a cop or a rena cop. And the public schools have these law enforcement semesters in high school and junior high
[1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:17.120]  where they train them to write dossiers on their parents. And now the New York Times reports as if it's a good thing
[1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:22.120]  that children are telling their parents to turn the faucet off and don't water the yard and bossing their parents around
[1:16:22.120 --> 1:16:28.120]  and paddling on their parents. Oh, isn't it cute? No, it's not cute. It's hardcore scientific tyranny.

[1:16:41.120 --> 1:16:50.120]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman. According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[1:16:50.120 --> 1:16:57.120]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.

[1:18:33.120 --> 1:18:38.120]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:44.120]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:50.120]  It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[1:18:50.120 --> 1:19:00.120]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984 and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933,
[1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:04.120]  some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.

[1:20:33.120 --> 1:20:41.120]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[1:20:47.120 --> 1:20:49.120]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:20:52.120 --> 1:21:01.120]  Yeah, you know, I don't want to do this service here. I don't want to come on air and just calmly report on this and in a way condition people to accept it.
[1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:13.120]  This is a big deal. This is really bad. Let's say there's a list of 100 things the government checks off to bring a nation to total tyranny and bondage and oppression.
[1:21:13.120 --> 1:21:24.120]  And one of the biggest ones you check off is indoctrinating the youth paramilitarily to train the central government to serve the central government,
[1:21:24.120 --> 1:21:26.120]  to be trained by the central government.
[1:21:26.120 --> 1:21:34.120]  And that is what is happening now. And I keep telling people it's in government documents. It's being set up. It's being done.
[1:21:34.120 --> 1:21:41.120]  When I was in high school, they were just now, this is like 18 years ago. I'm hard to believe I'm getting that old.
[1:21:41.120 --> 1:21:50.120]  They were already setting up that you could take a law enforcement semester, but then it was just learning about it and I didn't do it.
[1:21:50.120 --> 1:21:58.120]  Now they and I mean, I've gotten to the grants, the federal grants to the schools and the BATF and the FBI or the federal marshals are different grants.
[1:21:58.120 --> 1:22:09.120]  They federalize a local group of police officers or sheriff's deputies and then they go teach the federal curriculum and it is what is in your parents medicine cabinet.
[1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:16.120]  And then it's let's go out with M16s or toy M16s at first than real ones later and do warrant service training.
[1:22:16.120 --> 1:22:24.120]  Let's practice running checkpoints. By the way, it's in the stack of I have time to get to it. Tennessee newspapers have given us credit.
[1:22:24.120 --> 1:22:32.120]  It's up on info wars.com link to the article that we supposedly stopped illegal military checkpoints to be run in Tennessee.
[1:22:32.120 --> 1:22:44.120]  Well, it'd be nice to get the credit and they have the governor statements and others in there, but they, the governor and the state reps said don't have the illegal military checkpoints without warrants.
[1:22:44.120 --> 1:22:49.120]  And it went ahead and happened. So we actually don't deserve the credit, but we did point it out.
[1:22:49.120 --> 1:22:52.120]  I don't even the media is not even getting it right here.
[1:22:52.120 --> 1:23:02.120]  The point is, again, suddenly all over the country, the armies running checkpoints, suddenly they're just popping up with drills and the drills go live and they're searching citizens.
[1:23:02.120 --> 1:23:08.120]  This is to acclimate and to test which cities, which counties, which states will go along with takeover.
[1:23:08.120 --> 1:23:16.120]  And then why would the military want to take over because they work under North com, which is publicly chartered under the North American Union.
[1:23:16.120 --> 1:23:27.120]  That is public declassified treaties. We are in the N. A. U. And under this new system, we don't have any rights or liberties.
[1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:32.120]  Now they can tell me all day I don't have rights and liberties, but I have them because God gave them to me.
[1:23:32.120 --> 1:23:42.120]  I'm innately a free being even if you're an atheist. Don't you believe that you're innately a free human that the government, you know, can't stick you on the end of a pike out front?
[1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:46.120]  The castle gates for no reason if they want to.
[1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:50.120]  Oh, it's so amazing, ladies and gentlemen to have all of this happening.
[1:23:50.120 --> 1:23:55.120]  But upon info wars dot com prison planet dot com story by Paul Joseph Watson and Kurt Nemo.
[1:23:55.120 --> 1:24:07.120]  Governments ready youth corps to take on vets 10 minutes into an errant mayhem in the town near Mexican border and a gunman, a disgruntled Iraq war veteran has already taken on two people.
[1:24:07.120 --> 1:24:11.120]  One slumped in the desk, the other covered in blood on the floor.
[1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:19.120]  And it goes the New York Times article reporting on how the Boy Scouts are being trained to take on domestic terrorists.
[1:24:19.120 --> 1:24:26.120]  Now, see, if this was just one drill, you'd say, oh, well, in that one scenario, the feds in the grant paid to have this.
[1:24:26.120 --> 1:24:30.120]  No, I have articles in Texas, Michigan, California, New York, everywhere.
[1:24:30.120 --> 1:24:38.120]  I have I have Hobbs Middle School article 1998.
[1:24:38.120 --> 1:24:42.120]  In fact, if folks don't believe this, Google it again, like I did two weeks ago in the air.
[1:24:42.120 --> 1:24:46.120]  Hobbs Middle School Marines.
[1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:50.120]  Marshall law, Hobbs Middle School Marines, Marshall law, 1998.
[1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:54.120]  We have the article saved and a listener faxed it to me.
[1:24:54.120 --> 1:25:00.120]  And I called the Marines up and I said, did you really go in and tell the kids it was Marshall law and put guns in their heads?
[1:25:00.120 --> 1:25:02.120]  And they said, yeah, we were ordered to do so.
[1:25:02.120 --> 1:25:04.120]  The Marines weren't even hiding this.
[1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:12.120]  This has been a long term strategic operation to acclimate everybody, including the children to go along with this.
[1:25:12.120 --> 1:25:17.120]  So they have drills where they come in and say the police come in and say unannounced in Michigan, the AP reported.
[1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:19.120]  We're here to kill you.
[1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:23.120]  We're the home schoolers against public education and for the second amendment.
[1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:24.120]  I'm not kidding.
[1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:25.120]  That's a quote.
[1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:28.120]  And then the kids parents say, what was this about?
[1:25:28.120 --> 1:25:33.120]  Oh, it's about home schoolers attacking those darn home schoolers.
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:41.120]  I mean, that'd be like if I didn't like black people and I dressed up, you know, in blackface and went over to my neighbor's house and beat them up and said, I'm a black guy.
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:43.120]  I don't like white people.
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:47.120]  That would be a false flag attack against black people.
[1:25:47.120 --> 1:25:56.120]  If I burned down the police station and then left evidence that somebody I didn't like did it, that would be a false flag as stage terror attack.
[1:25:56.120 --> 1:26:04.120]  When the police attacked their own police in Denver and in Canada last year and in England, the G 22 weeks ago, and then admit they did it.
[1:26:04.120 --> 1:26:08.120]  That's a false flag to make all the demonstrators look bad.
[1:26:08.120 --> 1:26:10.120]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[1:26:10.120 --> 1:26:21.120]  They have these drills everywhere where veterans go crazy and kill everybody or were home schoolers come to the public school and kill people or were militia members come and kill people.
[1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:26.120]  That's how they demonize gun owners, veterans and others to the local police.
[1:26:26.120 --> 1:26:28.120]  It's a simple false flag.
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:29.120]  It's basic psychology.
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:31.120]  Do you like being manipulated?
[1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:33.120]  Do you like being suckered?
[1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:36.120]  Do you like being fools?
[1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:41.120]  And now they've announced, you know, I said one million off of Ramam annuals book.
[1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:56.120]  He wrote three years ago and now he's chief of staff and now the White House is saying 8 million 7 to 8 million of the New York Times youth core with police powers with environmental core armed core, you know, all these different
[1:26:56.120 --> 1:27:09.120]  surveillance squads, they're announcing it and what are the number one new federal grants for people to get tuition in the schools?
[1:27:09.120 --> 1:27:22.120]  You know, you know, when a kid has great grades, they get scholarships now to not be a nuclear physicist, to not be a biologist, to not be a teacher, to not be a physical therapist.
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:30.120]  No, the biggest piece of the pie now is law enforcement and surveillance and Patriot Act compliance.
[1:27:30.120 --> 1:27:31.120]  And what is it?
[1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:38.120]  Data mining, spying on neighbors, running people's backgrounds when they rent a car, get a hotel, how to be spies.
[1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:47.120]  That's why everywhere you go now, there's security guards and spies and you can't videotape here as you walk down the street, you know, videotaping a landmark.
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:49.120]  Acting like everybody's a terrorist.
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:28:06.120]  See, it's all for us, it's all for the people because big offshore banks, publicly and trilateral commission, CFR, Club of Rome, Builderburg Group documents that we post on infowars.com that are now mainstream news, Politico, CBS News.
[1:28:06.120 --> 1:28:14.120]  All these major newspapers, Portugal television, biggest papers in Greece are now quoting us because we get the documents.
[1:28:14.120 --> 1:28:19.120]  We send the teams to Builderburg, I get arrested going to it, Jim Tucker does, others do.
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:28.120]  More than a dozen reporters got arrested over the weekend in Greece just trying to cover these people meeting.
[1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:30.120]  And you know what their documents say?
[1:28:30.120 --> 1:28:36.120]  They are going to have a string of controlled financial implosions, each one worse than the next.
[1:28:36.120 --> 1:28:46.120]  Government's going to pose as the savior during each one and use that to get more control for select group of corporations. They're going to hand what's left of the West industry over to select banks.
[1:28:46.120 --> 1:28:52.120]  Then they're going to bankrupt the world currencies total and have a new global digital currency.
[1:28:52.120 --> 1:29:05.120]  See, first they're going to go to regional currencies where you still have your dollar or still have your euro, but it will be digitized and set to the same rate every day, the same currency rate, in the name of stabilization.
[1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:13.120]  Then they're going to go right to thumb scans and retina scans. This has openly been announced. That's the new global currency.
[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:21.120]  And if your retinas turned off, your thumb prints turned off, no buying, no selling, total control. Think of what Hitler or Stalin would have done with that.

[1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:54.120]  The GCN Radio Network, providing the world with hard-hitting talk radio. GCN Great Talk Radio starts here.
[1:33:54.120 --> 1:34:05.120]  Folks, it couldn't be creepier when you look at what the federal government's doing. All the warrantless wiretapping and the secret arrest and no rights for detainees.
[1:34:05.120 --> 1:34:12.120]  And if you read that Military Commissions Act, it says that's for U.S. citizens as well, just they just trip you to your citizenship.
[1:34:12.120 --> 1:34:22.120]  And then you look at where the funding's going. I'd say 98% of anti-terrorists focused inward on the American people and the federalized local police.
[1:34:22.120 --> 1:34:30.120]  This is all for you, the youth corps, the Boy Scouts. And I don't want to just sing a lot of the Boy Scouts here because I think it's been a very good organization overall.
[1:34:30.120 --> 1:34:45.120]  I'm talking about all the public schools, the private schools. They're all being recruited into these federal programs where the youth actually march around and train with guns and train for gun confiscation.
[1:34:45.120 --> 1:34:55.120]  And Obama keeps getting up and saying, oh, I don't want your guns. We're not coming after your guns. They've got eight different bills introduced that'll basically completely ban the Second Amendment.
[1:34:55.120 --> 1:35:09.120]  They're trying to get us to sign on and to get the, they've already signed on. They want the Senate to ratify this small arms ban that states that it'll ban the Second Amendment right down to black powder.
[1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:19.120]  I mean, it's all happening. It's all happening. Everybody's worried about the economy and the media keeps saying everything's fine. Yeah, Chrysler's laying off 3,000 and GM's going to lay off, you know.
[1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:27.120]  Well, I say 3,000. I mean, 3,000 dealerships. Yeah, they're shutting all the, you know, all the Chrysler dealerships are almost all of them.
[1:35:27.120 --> 1:35:36.120]  They're going to shut down 3,000 GM ones, but everything's fine. And yeah, $14.8 trillion in seven months has been stolen by offshore banks.
[1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:48.120]  And then the very banking heads meet in secret in Greece and mainstream reporters for the biggest Greek papers, British, biggest British papers and others, London Guardian and others.
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:36:03.120]  And I interviewed them Thursday and Friday. They went and showed up. They went there and they got arrested. They got picked up.
[1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:08.120]  Hey guys, will you guys come reboot the phone system and just shut down in here?
[1:36:08.120 --> 1:36:15.120]  That's why old patent papers seems to be good with these guests. These computers are always frying out. Thank you because I want to go back to the calls here in a moment.
[1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:24.120]  Look, all of this is going on. All of this is happening. And I know it sounds crazy. I can't believe it. I understand.
[1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:31.120]  But they couldn't believe it in Germany in the 30s. They couldn't believe it in Russia in 1918. They couldn't believe it in China.
[1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:40.120]  But it's happening here. And it is the big money setting up a police state to turn the poor people loose on you.
[1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:46.120]  And they're going to tell the poor folks, you know, here's a fancy uniform. Here's a machine gun. And it starts slow.
[1:36:46.120 --> 1:36:52.120]  You know, military in New York after 9 11 and then military at the Kentucky Derby and then military arresting people.
[1:36:52.120 --> 1:36:58.120]  The Kentucky Derby and at college football games in the Super Bowl and then the regular army at high school football games.
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:05.120]  It's now happening. These reports are pouring in mainstream news everywhere going. Oh, yes, the army and the Air Force MPs.
[1:37:05.120 --> 1:37:14.120]  We're out in Tennessee. We're out in Arkansas. We're out in Michigan. We're out in New York running checkpoints today just searching people for everyone's safety.
[1:37:14.120 --> 1:37:17.120]  Oh, hi, I'm the regular army. I'm just here to search you.
[1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:29.120]  And then they're having drills in Florida and Arizona and California and upstate New York with foreign troops training with public FEMA drills to take over the U.S.
[1:37:29.120 --> 1:37:36.120]  And saying, oh, yes, in newspaper headlines, foreign troops will help if terrorists strike. They've done this before.
[1:37:36.120 --> 1:37:43.120]  Actually, why Mexican troops helped in New Orleans and Norwegian troops helped after 9 11.
[1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:51.120]  See, they just set the press. It's happening as bad as things are now. This is nothing. What are they planning so bad?
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:58.120]  They think we're going to accept youth corps running around in gray, red and blue uniforms.
[1:37:58.120 --> 1:38:04.120]  That's the good that they're in uniforms. You can go to the government websites. I have it up on info wars dot com.
[1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:15.120]  They're in blue, gray and red uniforms running around and they admit they're going to come door to door and already are asking you if you support the president's policies and then marking down your house.
[1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:24.120]  If you support or not, talk about intimidation unspoken. Oh, hi, we're just here in a red uniform to ask and see if it's happening.
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:37.120]  People. It's kind of a cool sound. Wow. Wow. Wow. I mean, I don't know what it's going to take to get people.
[1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:44.120]  Oh, man, I wish this wasn't true. Ladies and gentlemen, I wish.
[1:38:44.120 --> 1:38:50.120]  Let's go to your phone calls. Micah North Carolina. Micah on the air. Hey, Alex, how they going? Good.
[1:38:50.120 --> 1:38:57.120]  They just keep incrementally implementing this where it's kind of the ambient background like the frog in the pot and people put up with it.
[1:38:57.120 --> 1:39:04.120]  Oh, they're pulling on all the stops. Let me tell you, punks in red uniforms better not come around my house.
[1:39:04.120 --> 1:39:12.120]  That is un-American as it gets and they equate it with our history. Yes, we're the youth corps in red uniforms and khaki pants.
[1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:21.120]  I mean, you got to see these outfits, man. Black boots and khaki pants and red jackets. I mean, and it's military style.
[1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:27.120]  Unbelievable. Did you do that? Oh, listen, I forgot. The end of the video is the worst. I couldn't listen to it.
[1:39:27.120 --> 1:39:33.120]  It says, and this is my uniform. This is what I wear. I mean, folks, look out, man.
[1:39:33.120 --> 1:39:38.120]  This is crazy. But how do they wear people outrage about it?
[1:39:38.120 --> 1:39:44.120]  Because they drink sodium fluoride, a known sedative in every major government study. And then the public sew brainwash because they made Archie Bunker talk about it.
[1:39:44.120 --> 1:39:49.120]  Some people aren't kooks. They're not Archie Bunker. So they believe sodium fluoride is good for them. And people are fat, dumb and happy.
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:54.120]  We had it so good because we had liberty that people just still can't believe it's happening to them. Let me tell you something.
[1:39:54.120 --> 1:40:01.120]  The economy is going to get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse. It's all by design. I'm on record three years ago making a film,
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:08.120]  breaking down exactly how the economy would go down because we had spies inside Bouldered Bird because we get arrested.
[1:40:08.120 --> 1:40:14.120]  We get death-threaded. We go through hell to bring the fat, dumb America in this information.
[1:40:14.120 --> 1:40:20.120]  But you may be fat and dumb, but you're my kin, so I still love you and I'm not going to be free if you're not free.
[1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:25.120]  So I'm here saying, wake up, wake up. Our house is on fire and they're like, what's that smell? It smells like a barbecue.
[1:40:25.120 --> 1:40:33.120]  And I'm like, yeah, our house is burning and they're like, shut up. I'm going to lay here on the couch. Listen, get up, man. Come on.
[1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:37.120]  We've been chemically lobotomized, my friend.
[1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:44.120]  And with the entertainment, the average adult watches four hours of TV a day and all the studies admit it literally puts you into a dreamlike state.
[1:40:44.120 --> 1:40:54.120]  That's not my opinion, folks. Google search engine, television watching, dreamlike state, lowered brainwaves, television Alzheimer's.
[1:40:54.120 --> 1:41:00.120]  They've known. They know. They know, ladies and gentlemen, it's brainwashing you.
[1:41:00.120 --> 1:41:09.120]  The flicker rates, the blue mist, you know, that's meant to get your eye focused on that, put you into subconscious mode, bombarding with like 20 different images,
[1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:14.120]  shuts off your conscious thinking, goes right into the subconscious. They knew this 50 years ago.
[1:41:14.120 --> 1:41:26.120]  I wanted to bring your attention. April 3, CDC let out a report that they tested 18 baby formulas. Every one of them had perchlorate rocket fuel.
[1:41:26.120 --> 1:41:33.120]  I know. And also, more than 90% has melamine that kills the kidneys. And they'd always said it was deadly.
[1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:38.120]  But when that came out, they said, we now say melamine is good for you. And they now say mercury is good for you.
[1:41:38.120 --> 1:41:46.120]  Well, that seriously affects the infant brain development. They know it. It's also in 35 states water systems. They won't say which ones.
[1:41:46.120 --> 1:41:47.120]  But here's a kicker, Alec.
[1:41:47.120 --> 1:41:52.120]  M-B-T-E that they ordered put in the gasoline to help the greenhouse gas?
[1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:53.120]  Yep.
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:56.120]  That is in 49 states that attacks brains.
[1:41:56.120 --> 1:41:57.120]  But why?
[1:41:57.120 --> 1:41:59.120]  Of course, it's an accident.
[1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:07.120]  Yeah. Why does a one baby formula that has 80% of the market share have three times the amount that the other ones do?
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:16.120]  It's an accident. I appreciate your call. Just like when you go into babies are us and all these stores, it's huge racks of fluoride for your baby.
[1:42:16.120 --> 1:42:25.120]  Fluoride water. The mineral it needs. Fluoride. And they know. They know. They know. Not babies are us, but the company.
[1:42:25.120 --> 1:42:33.120]  They know fluoride is four times as bad. In fact, people don't believe me. I want to cover it in the last segment.
[1:42:33.120 --> 1:42:38.120]  Google and print for me. Fluoride more damaging to young brains.
[1:42:38.120 --> 1:42:43.120]  Or fluoride increases cancer in children. It particularly attacks children.
[1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:46.120]  I'm going to read to you government reports. There's thousands of them, literally.
[1:42:46.120 --> 1:42:53.120]  But it's, oh, your baby needs it. And I've talked to people in the Soviet, old Soviet Union, and then I actually searched it and found it was true.
[1:42:53.120 --> 1:42:58.120]  They would eat. They would have food rationing. No sausage, no bread.
[1:42:58.120 --> 1:43:06.120]  But when they went to school, there was always free chocolate, strawberry and regular flavored milk free and it fortified with fluoride.
[1:43:06.120 --> 1:43:16.120]  Oh, free fluoride milk. Oh, the government wants to help.
[1:43:16.120 --> 1:43:23.120]  And they now say on government announcements at PRTV ads, mercury is actually good for the brain.
[1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:29.120]  And they've got ads where they say corn syrup's good, though you can Google that more than half of the corn syrup in the country.
[1:43:29.120 --> 1:43:33.120]  High levels of mercury will be right back. Don't listen to me. Drink more mercury.
[1:43:33.120 --> 1:43:39.120]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people. Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[1:43:39.120 --> 1:43:50.120]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up. Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:55.120]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray available at MrDefense.com.

[1:45:29.120 --> 1:45:44.120]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[1:45:44.120 --> 1:45:57.120]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[1:45:57.120 --> 1:46:02.120]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:09.120]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:13.120]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.

[1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:26.120]  Here's one, three studies that were done by the federal government. Fluoride affects on the brain, drinking water on children's intelligence, and it's got just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of studies put out by the National Research Council, the EPA.
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:41.120]  You name it, and that's why they've had the majority of EPA scientists two years ago. I had one of the heads of their major union on saying, yes, they knowingly are putting deadly poison to brain damage the public in the water.
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:51.120]  I mean, I'm looking at literally hundreds and hundreds. That's why this is such a great 15-page article, because it's not even an article. It's just links to governments, Chinese, British, Russian, U.S., Canadian.
[1:48:51.120 --> 1:49:01.120]  I mean, I remember when I first looked this up more than 12 years ago on the Internet, I found University of Texas studies from, like, 1932 about how they were saying, yes, we could use this in the same assailants.
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:13.120]  It's a great sedative. It's just very toxic and causes cancer. Did you guys print up the studies for me about it, massively increasing bone cancer? Absolute confirmed fact.
[1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:23.120]  But drink up. It's for your baby. Oh, the government wouldn't do that to make me more manageable. Well, listen, government idiots, you're drinking it too, you little controlled Frank servants.
[1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:32.120]  This is a very small group of eugenicists at the top that are doing this, and I'm sorry a lot of you were too cowardly to admit the truth. The facts are the facts.
[1:49:32.120 --> 1:49:51.120]  Look at this rat studies and brain cell damage with aluminum and fluoride and water, Wall Street Journal, October 28, 1992, fluoride in the pineal gland, BBC, fluoride in the brain interview with Dr. Phyllis Mullenich's interview, and it just goes through hundreds of these links.
[1:49:51.120 --> 1:50:03.120]  Full text, Zhang Q Beijing affect the fluoride and drinking water on children's intelligence. Full text affect the fluoride on water intelligence of children.
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:14.120]  Here's the EPA. It is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain source National Research Council for fluoride and drinking water, a scientific review of the EPA standards.
[1:50:14.120 --> 1:50:22.120]  National Academics Press, Washington, D.C. I'm on page one, by the way, this goes on 15 pages. When I say thousands, I mean thousands.
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:31.120]  In harm's way, toxic threats to children's development. But don't worry, the stores have it just for your baby. Oh, they love you as a government cares.
[1:50:31.120 --> 1:50:39.120]  But meanwhile, you see all the big headlines about the government says it will reduce the population by at least half. Humans are bad. We want carbon taxes on fat people.
[1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:47.120]  We want carbon taxes to shut down U.S. industry. Do you know if you buy a piece of rural land and want to get an environmental exemption so you don't have to pay as many taxes on it?
[1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:57.120]  You could never go back and even if somebody buys it, you could never convert back to agriculture. You could never use it for agriculture again because they don't want agriculture.
[1:50:57.120 --> 1:51:07.120]  They don't want industry. Do you understand? And it's not for the environment. So they control things. This is bigger than anything you could imagine, folks, what you're listening to.
[1:51:07.120 --> 1:51:15.120]  And I'm sorry it's some guy from Texas bringing it to you, but you need to step up and research this and find out about it.
[1:51:15.120 --> 1:51:25.120]  I'm sorry if your ego doesn't like knowing that you're a slave and under chemical and biological attack, but you still are under attack. You should love your children enough to care.
[1:51:25.120 --> 1:51:34.120]  It just goes on and on. I said I get into Bilderberg and I have loaded the phone lines here and I just start thinking about a caller bringing up key points and it's true.
[1:51:34.120 --> 1:51:37.120]  Let's take another call. Harvey in Florida. Harvey, you're on the air.
[1:51:37.120 --> 1:51:39.120]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today?
[1:51:39.120 --> 1:51:43.120]  Oh, pretty good. I wish folks weren't brain damaging their children, but hey, they love the government.
[1:51:43.120 --> 1:51:51.120]  Well, I love to call you and give you some. I was a eye witness several weeks ago. I sent there in an email. I'll give you the short version of what I saw.
[1:51:51.120 --> 1:52:01.120]  I was in the Tropicana Casino and Hotel in Atlantic City. I go in the elevator. There's a gentleman dressed in a suit. I said, oh, are you here for a conference?
[1:52:01.120 --> 1:52:06.120]  He goes, yeah, go what type of conference? He goes, National Security Conference.
[1:52:06.120 --> 1:52:20.120]  So we go down the elevator and I see an arrow with a conference. There's a bunch of letters, FCC, HS. So I follow the arrow and it turns out they had it spelled out when you went upstairs where the conference was.
[1:52:20.120 --> 1:52:30.120]  They had fusion centers, criminal investigation, homeland security, and I saw all these characters. It was unbelievable what was going on. It was a two-day conference.
[1:52:30.120 --> 1:52:38.120]  Yeah, the fusion centers are federalizing everything, teaching the police that guns are going to be illegal, how to work with the youth corps.
[1:52:38.120 --> 1:52:48.120]  The local fusion centers track everybody's cell phone real time. They hit one code. They dial in to listen to another code. They follow you by name with your cell phone under federal law.
[1:52:48.120 --> 1:52:52.120]  No fourth amendment, no fifth amendment, no tenth. What else happened?
[1:52:52.120 --> 1:53:04.120]  Well, there was a guy in a white suit with bars on his chest, so I believe he was a Navy admiral, and there were state police cars everywhere and stormtroopers from the state police in this conference.
[1:53:04.120 --> 1:53:08.120]  You know who heads up FEMA in all the major departments? It's military people now.
[1:53:08.120 --> 1:53:11.120]  Yep, this confirms everything you've been talking about.
[1:53:11.120 --> 1:53:14.120]  So what else did they see and tell you to get out of there or what was going on?
[1:53:14.120 --> 1:53:24.120]  They gave me an escort out. I pretended like I was a senile old man because I was just walking around trying to snoop on him, and I said, oh, no, I'm just looking for the elevators.
[1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:30.120]  You know, I pretended like I was senile, so they escorted me. The security escorted me out, but they were marching through this place.
[1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:36.120]  The admiral had five flunkies in suits following him like an inch from him as he was marching through the corridors.
[1:53:36.120 --> 1:53:44.120]  And every day, this was three weeks ago, and every day on the news, every minute of every day on every station across the land, they were talking about the flu outbreak.
[1:53:44.120 --> 1:53:52.120]  They weren't hiding, but it was weird. Why would they be at a casino there to get in a little gambling while they were...
[1:53:52.120 --> 1:53:57.120]  Because, well, I'm going to be frank with you. What do you think runs the New World Order? It's the global mafia.
[1:53:57.120 --> 1:54:05.120]  But no, they're having regional meetings everywhere to test their federal flunkies, and they're promising all the locals all the power they're going to get.
[1:54:05.120 --> 1:54:13.120]  This is a criminal takeover of society, and they... Look, the foreign banks are openly imploding the economy by design.
[1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:22.120]  They'll soon have us completely sucked dry, and they know when the public panics, they're going to release some flu or something as a cover story, as an excuse to clamp down.
[1:54:22.120 --> 1:54:28.120]  Oh, we got to have martial law for a flu. Remember, three weeks ago, four weeks ago, I laid out it was a manufactured flu.
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:35.120]  Now, top scientists have looked at it and say, yes, it is totally manufactured, but as a beta test.
[1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:39.120]  And so it just gets crazier and crazier, my friend. I appreciate your call.
[1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:50.120]  Yeah, it's just Google Fusion Centers. It's the Fusion Centers that are getting these DHS reports saying veterans are the number one threat to homeland security.
[1:54:50.120 --> 1:54:56.120]  Number two, American gun owners. The whole anti-terror system is for you.
[1:54:56.120 --> 1:55:00.120]  You own a nice ranch. You own a company. You're the target.
[1:55:00.120 --> 1:55:05.120]  You're well to do. You're the target. You're a middle class. You're a veteran. You're a gun owner. You're a retired police officer.
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:12.120]  What do you think happened in Russia and China and Cambodia? You better read up. You better find out who the targets are.
[1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:19.120]  These people mean business. They are training youth corps, I'd say, to be ready in two, three years.
[1:55:19.120 --> 1:55:26.120]  They'll be ready. The guys that are 16 are going to be 18. And they are training to go in and to seek and destroy.
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:30.120]  To go in buildings. It's in the New York Times. Hidden in plain view.
[1:55:30.120 --> 1:55:37.120]  Oh, look at these young children training to kill the veterans and the homeland security guys are going in and get the shooters.
[1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:42.120]  Kill them. And it's always in a nice situational ethics where, you know, it's reasonable.
[1:55:42.120 --> 1:55:49.120]  Wonder if the Austin cops got that. Two guys are sleeping in a car and they gun them down. And, of course, the camera's malfunction.
[1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:54.120]  And people call in on the radio and defend it and say, the guy has served to die for being in a car at night.
[1:55:54.120 --> 1:55:59.120]  Well, when a cop kills your kid in a car at night, just remember you asked for that karma.
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:04.120]  And you're like, oh, you don't like the cops? Oh, no, I didn't like the cops in Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union,
[1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:08.120]  or in Orin Fidel's Cuba right now, or in Venezuela.
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:12.120]  No, you bet I don't. I don't like tyranny. If a cop's good and falls Bill of Rights, great.
[1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:16.120]  But the cops work for a system that works for foreign offshore banks.
[1:56:16.120 --> 1:56:20.120]  And cops, when they're done with you, you're going to be their number one enemy, so just get ready for it.
[1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:26.120]  You think you're in power right now? Just get ready. They're going to have a bunch of young scum right up underneath you.
[1:56:26.120 --> 1:56:29.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Washington. Scott, go ahead.
[1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:36.120]  Yeah, I had a question I was going to ask you, but just incidentally, you'd asked what year that Archie Bunker clip was from.
[1:56:36.120 --> 1:56:38.120]  1972.
[1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:39.120]  72. Okay.
[1:56:39.120 --> 1:56:46.120]  Yeah, and that euphemism of the boss hall that you're always talking about, the guy that played him was actually in that episode too.
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:47.120]  No.
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:53.120]  So just a little trivial for your information. But what I was going to ask you was that protest at Arizona State,
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:58.120]  the one that Ernest Hancock was going to be a part of and passing out the DVDs.
[1:56:58.120 --> 1:57:01.120]  And I know you and Jason had them on your shows last week.
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:03.120]  Yeah, I saw video of them handing out the DVDs.
[1:57:03.120 --> 1:57:08.120]  Yeah, I was just curious. Was there any word on how that went?
[1:57:08.120 --> 1:57:15.120]  No, everybody said, oh, the Secret Service won't let them have Micro FM's broadcasting there and they won't let them hand out 15,000 of my DVDs.
[1:57:15.120 --> 1:57:20.120]  It's all a paper tiger. You have a First Amendment. They went out. They were very successful.
[1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:24.120]  Only had a few pirates, as they call the police, come up and tell them they'd have free speech.
[1:57:24.120 --> 1:57:27.120]  And they said, go ahead and arrest us if you want. The cops backed off.
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:32.120]  You see, we get these rights by demanding them and exercising them. The minute we bend over, we lose them.
[1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:42.120]  Yeah, and just to show you how they were trying to dumb it down on the left, one of his former station colleagues, Ernest Hancock, on the station he used to be on,
[1:57:42.120 --> 1:57:51.120]  was reading some article, I guess, that he either got it out of Daily Coulter, Huffington Post, basically, was an instruction guide on how the left should protest this
[1:57:51.120 --> 1:58:01.120]  and telling them, oh, well, you know, you can say it is, but don't really complain about it and talk about coming to the protest with a positive message.
[1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:06.120]  Yeah, it's all political correctness and control. You know, I meant to get into Bilderberg. We got articles detailing all of it.
[1:58:06.120 --> 1:58:12.120]  Their plan is global tax, global regulation, world government, bankrupting things, accelerating the depression.
[1:58:12.120 --> 1:58:18.120]  We have people inside, major breaking info in the articles and videos at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:23.120]  Great job, crew. Get fired up without freedom. Take on tyranny and we're going to win.

[1:58:53.120 --> 1:58:59.120]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?

[1:59:26.120 --> 1:59:30.120]  Go to the cashier. Tell them you don't want to pay for the product. You just want to take it home and try it.
[1:59:30.120 --> 1:59:34.120]  And if and only if you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[1:59:34.120 --> 1:59:40.120]  Most likely if you tried this, you'd be arrested. But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the smoke free free trial offer is.
