[00:00.000 --> 00:18.200]  Police states aren't a joke.
[00:18.200 --> 00:24.560]  Hundreds of millions of people have been killed by government in the last hundred years.
[00:24.560 --> 00:28.120]  The police state is about robbing you and your family.
[00:28.120 --> 00:33.920]  The police state is about setting up a control grid so that the system can literally render
[00:33.920 --> 00:38.640]  you down to the level of feudal serfs and slaves.
[00:38.640 --> 00:42.880]  But if the people can be awakened to this threat and can understand how they're being
[00:42.880 --> 00:49.760]  controlled and manipulated, we can defeat this system and restore our constitutional republic.
[00:49.760 --> 00:51.900]  We are not revolutionaries.
[00:51.900 --> 00:57.120]  We are restorationists who want to restore the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and
[00:57.120 --> 00:59.200]  our republic for which it stands.
[00:59.200 --> 01:06.160]  We want to defeat and overturn the global governance structure that is using false flag
[01:06.160 --> 01:13.400]  terror, staged events as a pretext to go after the American people, and the similar system
[01:13.400 --> 01:17.600]  is being used worldwide against populations.
[01:17.600 --> 01:24.120]  Each and every one of you watching today is an integral part of the actions and the decisions
[01:24.120 --> 01:28.600]  you make on whether you join this fight against the new world order or whether you sit on
[01:28.600 --> 01:34.880]  your ass are absolutely vital to the future of this species.
[01:34.880 --> 01:39.200]  Individuals die, but our species goes on.
[01:39.200 --> 01:44.040]  And if you don't have an instinctive understanding of that, and if you're not threatened by the
[01:44.040 --> 01:50.000]  type of oppression that is unfolding in our society, you are asleep, you are blind, and
[01:50.000 --> 01:56.360]  I tell you now, this is the time to awaken to the new world order.
[01:56.360 --> 02:03.800]  What's happening today is real and is a threat to every free born person on this planet.
[02:03.800 --> 02:09.160]  Your water is being poisoned, your food is being poisoned, your air is being poisoned.
[02:09.160 --> 02:15.720]  A planetary dictatorial world government is openly being formed, and the goal of that
[02:15.720 --> 02:22.720]  world government is the establishment of a global kill grid to murder the majority of
[02:22.720 --> 02:25.120]  the world population.
[02:25.120 --> 02:27.460]  We know the government's staging terror attacks.
[02:27.460 --> 02:28.920]  We have the executive orders.
[02:28.920 --> 02:31.520]  We have the John Warren Defense Authorization Act.
[02:31.520 --> 02:33.280]  We have Rex 84.
[02:33.280 --> 02:35.280]  We have the Military Commissions Act.
[02:35.280 --> 02:39.040]  We have the civilian inmate labor camp program documents.
[02:39.040 --> 02:45.440]  And police state for the rise of FEMA is a powerful salvo of truth against the mountain
[02:45.440 --> 02:48.120]  of lies that is the new world order.
[02:48.120 --> 02:51.800]  All your friends and family that have heard about death camps, concentration camps, FEMA
[02:51.800 --> 02:56.120]  camps, who've been in denial, who've been lied to by the mainstream media, can watch
[02:56.120 --> 03:00.840]  this film, police state for the rise of FEMA and learn the truth.
[03:00.840 --> 03:02.400]  They can see the facts.
[03:02.400 --> 03:06.320]  They can check it for themselves and discover the truth.
[03:06.320 --> 03:11.920]  Good evening, my fellow America.
[03:11.920 --> 03:17.160]  We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportion.
[03:17.160 --> 03:24.360]  We annually spend on military security alone, more than the net income of all United States
[03:24.360 --> 03:25.360]  corporations.
[03:25.360 --> 03:29.360]  We recognize the imperative need for this development.
[03:29.360 --> 03:35.040]  Yet we must not fail to comprehend its great implications.
[03:35.040 --> 03:39.640]  Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved.
[03:39.640 --> 03:43.760]  Only the very structure of our society.
[03:43.760 --> 03:49.840]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwanted influence,
[03:49.840 --> 03:55.280]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[03:55.280 --> 04:02.120]  The protection for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[04:02.120 --> 04:08.040]  We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic process.
[04:08.040 --> 04:14.880]  Only an alert and knowledgeable citizen can contest the proper meshing of the huge industrial
[04:14.880 --> 04:20.440]  and military machinery of defense, the prospect of domination of the nation's profits, by
[04:20.440 --> 04:26.600]  federal employment, projects, allocations, and the power of money as ever present, and
[04:26.600 --> 04:29.400]  is gravely to be regarded.
[04:29.400 --> 04:36.720]  We must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy, but itself, become
[04:36.720 --> 04:41.840]  the captain of the scientific, technological elite.
[04:41.840 --> 04:48.080]  We cannot mourn the material aspects of our grandchildren without risking the loss also
[04:48.080 --> 05:00.720]  of their political and spiritual heritage.
[05:00.720 --> 05:03.120]  They help to create a new world order.
[05:03.120 --> 05:08.720]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[05:08.720 --> 05:12.840]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[05:12.840 --> 05:13.840]  documents.
[05:13.840 --> 05:18.280]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[05:18.280 --> 05:20.760]  It means all the world under their control.
[05:20.760 --> 05:23.520]  The United Nations would take over America.
[05:23.520 --> 05:26.840]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[05:26.840 --> 05:31.760]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[05:31.760 --> 05:34.240]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[05:34.240 --> 05:38.720]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[05:38.720 --> 05:39.720]  financial system.
[05:39.720 --> 05:42.600]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[05:42.600 --> 05:46.320]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite, and then everyone else.
[05:46.320 --> 05:48.560]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.

[06:01.880 --> 06:08.240]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[06:08.240 --> 06:18.640]  a war on for your mind.
[06:18.640 --> 06:22.520]  We have Jane Graham's Athe David.
[06:22.520 --> 06:26.400]  We've interviewed the former foreman of the Oklahoma City Grand Jury.
[06:26.400 --> 06:29.120]  We've interviewed police officers.
[06:29.120 --> 06:32.520]  We have a very clear picture of what happened that day.
[06:32.520 --> 06:34.920]  A very clear picture.
[06:34.920 --> 06:38.080]  And in fact, Jane of Memory Serves, I've interviewed her in years.
[06:38.080 --> 06:42.480]  I remember that she even saw some of the people that she saw working in the building planting
[06:42.480 --> 06:44.600]  gray sticks of butter with wires.
[06:44.600 --> 06:51.040]  We've had federal passes as maintenance people on some of the news footage.
[06:51.040 --> 06:54.400]  And I've talked to other witnesses that said they saw those men in there.
[06:54.400 --> 06:58.960]  And then on the news, after the bomb had gone off, they'd say, well, that's him.
[06:58.960 --> 06:59.960]  Well, that's him.
[06:59.960 --> 07:06.920]  John Doe, number two, Iraqis involved, all protected by the U.S. government.
[07:06.920 --> 07:10.920]  Jane Graham is a ninth floor survivor of the Murrow Federal Building Bombay in Oklahoma
[07:10.920 --> 07:11.920]  City of 95.
[07:11.920 --> 07:17.120]  She's made a video after David, after she watched the video cover up in Oklahoma.
[07:17.120 --> 07:21.120]  In that video, she recognized seeing two men who were caught on camera walking hurriedly
[07:21.120 --> 07:24.520]  away from the building after the bombing, holding walkie-talkie.
[07:24.520 --> 07:28.520]  She says that she had noticed these men in the building prior to the bombing wearing
[07:28.520 --> 07:36.400]  General Services Administration maintenance uniforms that she did not recognize GSA employees.
[07:36.400 --> 07:39.560]  And we have her, affidavit, up on infowars.com.
[07:39.560 --> 07:45.160]  Now, there's a new article out by Red Dirt Report, a great outfit out of Oklahoma, and
[07:45.160 --> 07:46.160]  it boils down.
[07:46.160 --> 07:51.160]  Again, she's one of scores of survivors and witnesses that basically tell the same story.
[07:51.160 --> 07:52.160]  Okay?
[07:52.160 --> 07:55.640]  And now you have Terry Nichols saying, in a sworn federal affidavit that McVay was
[07:55.640 --> 07:59.440]  a black-hop operator, you have McVay separately saying, one day it'll come out, the government
[07:59.440 --> 08:04.460]  did this, the ATF, 30 seconds after the bombing and full bomb gear, telling medics, patch
[08:04.460 --> 08:07.720]  me up, I was on the ninth floor, she was on the ninth floor, it was almost completely
[08:07.720 --> 08:08.720]  destroyed.
[08:08.720 --> 08:09.720]  Asinine.
[08:09.720 --> 08:14.000]  Well, Oklahoma and the rest of the world, respectively, remember the 168 people who died
[08:14.000 --> 08:18.120]  in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrow Federal Building in Oklahoma City, one survivor of
[08:18.120 --> 08:22.160]  April 19, 1925, Blash Jane Graham, once her questions about what really happened that
[08:22.160 --> 08:24.000]  day answered once and for all.
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  Graham, a native of Chicago, was working for HUD Office on the ninth floor of the Murrow
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.080]  Building that morning, told Red Dirt Report that there were a lot of strange things going
[08:32.080 --> 08:36.080]  on in the weeks leading up to the bombing, things that she shared numerous times with
[08:36.080 --> 08:40.600]  federal agents, things she felt were ignored, this including the presence of maintenance
[08:40.600 --> 08:45.600]  workers she did not recognize, military people in the parking garage, and more unusual activity.
[08:45.600 --> 08:50.320]  But one of the key figures, the bomber himself, Tim McVeigh, was spotted in the federal building
[08:50.320 --> 08:54.360]  on a number of occasions, and by multiple witnesses, I would add, it was a couple of
[08:54.360 --> 08:58.400]  weeks before the bombing, I had seen McVeigh in the building prior to the bombing around
[08:58.400 --> 09:04.760]  the first week of April, McVeigh, Graham said, wrote up the elevator while she was heading
[09:04.760 --> 09:08.240]  to her office on that morning, and we had the former head of Air Force Weapons Development
[09:08.240 --> 09:12.680]  saying the building was blown out and on in, and you have the seismographs and the blast
[09:12.680 --> 09:16.160]  points, I mean it just goes on and on, Hoppy Heidelberg, the grandeur foreman being threatened
[09:16.160 --> 09:21.080]  by the FBI, and cops being killed who spoke out, I mean it's unbelievable, and I'm gonna
[09:21.080 --> 09:24.080]  have her back up in the next few weeks for a full hour, she's very gracious, but I hate
[09:24.080 --> 09:27.600]  to even cover this without going over all the evidence, we just read a few more lines
[09:27.600 --> 09:30.720]  and we're going to her.
[09:30.720 --> 09:35.320]  She said McVeigh was in military fatigues, I looked at him and said hi, and he simply
[09:35.320 --> 09:39.520]  looked straight ahead, he got off the sixth floor, I turned to someone else in the elevator
[09:39.520 --> 09:43.800]  and said well he's certainly not very friendly, another time Graham said he was in the elevator
[09:43.800 --> 09:48.960]  again and got off on the ninth floor where the Secret Service and BATF offices were located.
[09:48.960 --> 09:53.240]  Another unusual event Graham recalled was on Friday April 14th, 1995, she had parked
[09:53.240 --> 09:57.640]  in the Murrow parking garage and she noticed three men standing together on the south side
[09:57.640 --> 10:02.000]  of the parking area, one of the men was holding what looked like floor plans, she said at
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.720]  first she thought about the recent phone problems that had been plaguing the building and problems
[10:06.720 --> 10:10.240]  with gas fumes in the area, I watched them carefully Graham said, they were standing
[10:10.240 --> 10:18.880]  behind a green light station wagon like an old country squire wagon, it was filthy and
[10:18.880 --> 10:23.360]  I couldn't see the plate on it, as she watched the three men, one of whom was wearing dark
[10:23.360 --> 10:28.240]  clothing and two wearing short sleeves and jeans, one of the men held a stack or a roll
[10:28.240 --> 10:33.760]  of what appeared to be telephone wire and then we'll have her finish up with what she
[10:33.760 --> 10:39.240]  was told and she talked to other people, military personnel, people that said they were FBI,
[10:39.240 --> 10:44.920]  people she'd not seen before, it just goes on and on, people approached her, identified
[10:44.920 --> 10:50.400]  themselves as an FBI, wanted to know about the men, I mean it just goes on and on and
[10:50.400 --> 10:54.640]  Jane Graham on record's been all over national TV, she was up there on the ninth floor, she's
[10:54.640 --> 10:59.800]  one of the survivors and Jane Graham, we appreciate your courage and you're speaking out again
[10:59.800 --> 11:01.360]  and it's good to have you on with us.
[11:01.360 --> 11:10.040]  Thank you very much for having me, yes go ahead, no no no you go ahead, I mean millions
[11:10.040 --> 11:16.400]  are listening, tell folks what really happened, well I think you've covered a lot of it but
[11:16.400 --> 11:22.600]  going back to, I'll try and keep it, the most important part was the Friday before when
[11:22.600 --> 11:31.480]  I saw the men down below, I was asked about the three men and I did tell them that they
[11:31.480 --> 11:36.840]  wanted to know what I thought they were and I said well I would have picked the man in
[11:36.840 --> 11:43.640]  charge being a surveyor and military, I said that was the first two things that came to
[11:43.640 --> 11:53.160]  my mind when I saw them and they had, I gave them a visualizing the size of the plants
[11:53.160 --> 11:58.600]  that I watched them, which they were holding up and I was told that that is exactly the
[11:58.600 --> 12:08.440]  size of plants, that plants are when they are in fact drawings of the building and the
[12:08.440 --> 12:17.040]  garage area and the third gentleman was tall, very very nice looking man, dark hair, his
[12:17.040 --> 12:25.280]  hair came right to his collar, he had very dark eyes, dark hair, he wore a black cowboy
[12:25.280 --> 12:34.160]  hat with a silver trim on the hat and he had black jeans, black boots, black shirt and
[12:34.160 --> 12:39.000]  I really got a good look at him, he turned away from me and went to the north wall and
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.960]  was having a cigarette and he did not want me to watch him.
[12:43.960 --> 12:48.360]  And of course we now know, you saw him on the news, Andreas Stossmeyer, the son of a
[12:48.360 --> 12:55.360]  top SS general, he is an admitted black ops commander for German and US intelligence and
[12:55.360 --> 12:59.280]  was at Elohim City being run by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[12:59.280 --> 13:07.680]  Yes, and that was who I identified later on, I also identified one of the men when I was
[13:07.680 --> 13:14.480]  finally shown some pictures, not by the FBI, not by the police, but through a private investigator
[13:14.480 --> 13:20.360]  who was giving me and I identified Gary Hunt as one of the gentlemen that I saw in the
[13:20.360 --> 13:26.720]  building the day before and the morning of the bombing with another man who was about
[13:26.720 --> 13:33.600]  five foot eight, light brownish blonde hair, very poor, very, very bad, complexed, when
[13:33.600 --> 13:38.920]  they both came out of the stairwell, they looked directly at me and then they bent their
[13:38.920 --> 13:49.080]  heads down and turned around the corner to go around the hallway past GSA because that
[13:49.080 --> 13:55.840]  is an outside door there to the outside of the building on the east, east end, I mean
[13:55.840 --> 14:03.160]  the west end of the building, so I was very much aware of them and then I was going to
[14:03.160 --> 14:09.160]  go upstairs and I thought it was odd that they came down the stairwell and as I said
[14:09.160 --> 14:16.440]  they were going quite quickly and I was talking to somebody else about the fact that I had
[14:16.440 --> 14:23.920]  seen some maintenance men, you know, some outside maintenance men and it wasn't just
[14:23.920 --> 14:28.920]  right after that when I was waiting at the elevator, a gentleman came up to me and said
[14:28.920 --> 14:36.000]  he was talking to some others and he said, I'm from the FBI and I wanted someone to
[14:36.000 --> 14:43.880]  tell me that you have seen two maintenance men and I said no, I said I didn't and of
[14:43.880 --> 14:47.640]  course at that time I was thinking whether they were talking about the elevator which
[14:47.640 --> 14:55.480]  we've had a problem with or the phone company and it wasn't registering to me at all about
[14:55.480 --> 15:05.360]  associating them with the two GSA-dressed maintenance men and it was only later on after
[15:05.360 --> 15:11.280]  I saw a video and saw the two of those men, I realized this is the men that they were
[15:11.280 --> 15:16.200]  referring to who somebody obviously had told them, I assume it was the men that I passed
[15:16.200 --> 15:23.760]  that I had seen them so that I think in that in itself probably saved my life at that point
[15:23.760 --> 15:29.520]  because Terry Yakey had seen so much and he was killed, a lot of people were murdered
[15:29.520 --> 15:46.960]  because of what they saw or what they wrote or what they did.
[15:46.960 --> 16:04.920]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[16:04.920 --> 16:07.840]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[16:07.840 --> 16:11.840]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[16:11.840 --> 16:12.840]  or gold?
[16:12.840 --> 16:16.240]  It's true, seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[16:16.240 --> 16:18.440]  possible that could even happen again.
[16:18.440 --> 16:22.600]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[16:22.600 --> 16:28.680]  seeds, they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[16:28.680 --> 16:33.180]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically
[16:33.180 --> 16:38.580]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[16:38.580 --> 16:44.320]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com, that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a
[16:44.320 --> 16:55.920]  call at 877-327-0365, that's 877-327-0365, remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds

[18:50.360 --> 19:04.240]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[19:04.240 --> 19:08.600]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[19:08.600 --> 19:09.600]  do you want?
[19:09.600 --> 19:11.600]  My answer would be all I can get.
[19:11.600 --> 19:16.640]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[19:16.640 --> 19:17.880]  How much do you want?
[19:17.880 --> 19:18.880]  When do you want it?
[19:18.880 --> 19:20.920]  Now or after the battle starts?
[19:20.920 --> 19:22.040]  When will you need it?
[19:22.040 --> 19:24.160]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[19:24.160 --> 19:25.520]  Will there be any food?
[19:25.520 --> 19:26.960]  Will it make your children sick?
[19:26.960 --> 19:31.120]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[19:31.120 --> 19:32.280]  and be immunized?
[19:32.280 --> 19:36.080]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[19:36.080 --> 19:39.640]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[19:39.640 --> 19:40.880]  How much will you need?
[19:40.880 --> 19:41.880]  We don't know.
[19:41.880 --> 19:42.880]  How much do you want?
[19:42.880 --> 19:43.880]  All you can get.
[19:43.880 --> 19:44.880]  I'm Alex Jones.
[19:44.880 --> 19:52.520]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day, call 1-800-409-5633 or check it
[19:52.520 --> 20:19.520]  out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[20:22.520 --> 20:37.360]  Now Terrence Jiggy was cop of the year that year.
[20:37.360 --> 20:41.880]  He went in local Oklahoma City cops, saved a bunch of people and the last person he talked
[20:41.880 --> 20:44.200]  to was his partner.
[20:44.200 --> 20:48.920]  He'd hidden evidence of it being an inside job in a storage locker outside town.
[20:48.920 --> 20:52.200]  He'd been told to get off the case by the superiors and the last phone call to his
[20:52.200 --> 20:56.200]  partner said I'm being told by Feds and then he was found murdered and tortured.
[20:56.200 --> 20:58.360]  That's right.
[20:58.360 --> 20:59.360]  That is correct.
[20:59.360 --> 21:08.360]  And I did go, I wrote a letter to Stephen Jones, I wrote a letter to the FBI, I wrote
[21:08.360 --> 21:14.360]  one to my doctor and another person and I told them exactly what I saw.
[21:14.360 --> 21:20.720]  I gave them descriptions of the men, I gave them what they were wearing, everything I
[21:20.720 --> 21:30.960]  could about them and what had occurred and I never did hear anything from anyone regarding
[21:30.960 --> 21:38.160]  from the FBI or the police about looking at pictures of anyone, trying to identify anyone
[21:38.160 --> 21:45.400]  and I did talk to one attorney and he said well I know the sketch artists but the police
[21:45.400 --> 21:47.400]  are just really, really good.
[21:47.400 --> 21:48.400]  We'll get a sketch done.
[21:48.400 --> 21:49.400]  I said fine.
[21:49.400 --> 21:51.640]  I never heard from him again after that.
[21:51.640 --> 21:54.640]  It just dropped, that was the end of that discussion.
[21:54.640 --> 22:03.760]  I went with Debbie Nakanishi to Washington several times on this case.
[22:03.760 --> 22:15.160]  I met with one of the men who was on the attorney's staff there dealing with, I wanted information
[22:15.160 --> 22:25.800]  about how does one deal with this as far as the legal aspect of the government and a review
[22:25.800 --> 22:31.480]  and so forth and he said well there were only like I think three men that deal with a lot
[22:31.480 --> 22:37.760]  of these issues and that really, there wasn't anything that they could do and I wanted,
[22:37.760 --> 22:43.000]  I tried to see the congressmen and senators from the state of Oklahoma, none of them would
[22:43.000 --> 22:52.080]  see me or talk to me and the only person that would talk to me was James Trafficant and
[22:52.080 --> 22:58.760]  I did meet in his office, I met his assistant and at that time he had requested from GSA
[22:58.760 --> 23:08.960]  all of their files and the FBI had come to him and told them that they wanted to go through
[23:08.960 --> 23:16.760]  all of the files that he had to write out various things that would be incriminating
[23:16.760 --> 23:22.960]  and he told them they didn't have the authority to do that and but he would give them one
[23:22.960 --> 23:27.000]  day and they said because he said they would not be able to do that and his assistant told
[23:27.000 --> 23:35.120]  me that they had threatened James Trafficant and said we will get you for this, we're going
[23:35.120 --> 23:36.120]  to get you over this.
[23:36.120 --> 23:40.960]  We've now been declassified that the current attorney general back at the time was the
[23:40.960 --> 23:45.000]  deputy and the memos have been released in his emails where he said we've got to have
[23:45.000 --> 23:51.600]  a full court press, this is like D-Day, we've got to get down to Oklahoma City, this is
[23:51.600 --> 23:56.960]  on the 16th and cover this up or it's over for us and we can even pull those emails up,
[23:56.960 --> 24:00.560]  I've read them on air and so that clearly shows they were going into congressman's
[24:00.560 --> 24:05.960]  office and saying you shut your mouth, there's so much to talk to you about Jane Graham,
[24:05.960 --> 24:06.960]  expanding on this.
[24:06.960 --> 24:13.080]  What about your run-ins with Tim McVeigh in the weeks before the Alfred B. Murrow building
[24:13.080 --> 24:14.480]  was blown out from under you?
[24:14.480 --> 24:22.440]  Yes, yes, he was there, he was there a number of times going up, as I said he went to the
[24:22.440 --> 24:27.800]  sixth floor, I think he even went to the fifth floor and certainly the ninth floor, he had
[24:27.800 --> 24:35.880]  gone up there and I really thought that he was with the military units there and going
[24:35.880 --> 24:42.760]  into report or up on the ninth floor they had ATF and other operations up there and
[24:42.760 --> 24:48.640]  I thought well whatever he's doing, he's new and he's just reporting in to whatever
[24:48.640 --> 24:56.600]  he needed to do and the comment I made about his not talking was the fact that everybody
[24:56.600 --> 25:04.400]  in that building would always be very pleasant and always friendly and hi, how are you regardless
[25:04.400 --> 25:09.760]  if you didn't know that they spoke and he absolutely would just look straight ahead,
[25:09.760 --> 25:20.680]  totally military and also one of the things most people do not know is that the arms squad
[25:20.680 --> 25:27.440]  had parked across in the church parking lot that morning and had their dogs out and one
[25:27.440 --> 25:31.680]  of the postal workers, a friend of mine that went with me to Washington several times,
[25:31.680 --> 25:37.160]  she had seen them now, she was told her job was threatened, she was told do not discuss
[25:37.160 --> 25:44.640]  this with anybody and she went to the union in regards to that issue and that was taken
[25:44.640 --> 25:54.520]  care of relatively quickly but it was important because when I went up to the seventh floor
[25:54.520 --> 26:02.120]  the I ran into Trish Nix who was killed in the bombing and she said have you seen the
[26:02.120 --> 26:07.520]  bond squad and I said no I haven't and she said well they've been in the building so
[26:07.520 --> 26:14.000]  I knew right then that there was something going on and of course like I said earlier
[26:14.000 --> 26:19.640]  in two weeks before that when I was in the coffee shop I was sitting at a booth and right
[26:19.640 --> 26:24.960]  next to me on the other booth was another lady talking to a friend of hers telling
[26:24.960 --> 26:31.840]  her that she had called a friend who worked at the FBI office at the 15th place and that
[26:31.840 --> 26:37.640]  this friend had received a back stating that there was going to be a bombing in the federal
[26:37.640 --> 26:43.440]  building and I was very, and she gave it to her supervisor and he said don't worry about
[26:43.440 --> 26:49.280]  it, we know about it already and I was concerned because at that time daughter-in-law had been
[26:49.280 --> 26:54.280]  working at Bally-X which is a 50th place and I said oh my god surely when I came home
[26:54.280 --> 26:59.400]  I said surely they're not what it's going to try about 50th place of course that's
[26:59.400 --> 27:04.480]  where the FBI was and I thought all those people you know are there they have nothing
[27:04.480 --> 27:09.320]  to do with the government and well Jane let me back you up on this because some of this
[27:09.320 --> 27:13.600]  has come out in newspapers but I have an employee whose dad was working in a federal building
[27:13.600 --> 27:20.560]  in Dallas and they got that fax the day before that a federal building was going to be blown
[27:20.560 --> 27:25.520]  up and then I know someone separately who was working in a federal building at the time
[27:25.520 --> 27:29.520]  on the west coast who remembers those faxes coming in and it's even come out in the news
[27:29.520 --> 27:34.240]  that there were some warnings but you've got McVeigh in the building you've got all these
[27:34.240 --> 27:37.960]  guys running around going back from some of your earlier video testimony and I haven't
[27:37.960 --> 27:41.840]  seen it in years but am I correct in saying you didn't just see wiring you saw gray sticks
[27:41.840 --> 27:50.920]  of butter I didn't know what it was at the time I just I saw it look like putty and
[27:50.920 --> 27:56.680]  I thought I you know I just thought I didn't know what it was until someone told me oh
[27:56.680 --> 28:02.480]  no that's C4 that's what that looks like now who had the blocks of gray gray putty those
[28:02.480 --> 28:08.040]  were the two that was the man that was with the the gentleman who was holding the plans
[28:08.040 --> 28:13.160]  in the building and so and so you're walking by these guys and you'd you'd never seen these
[28:13.160 --> 28:18.640]  maintenance crews but they're there with wires and gray putty no no no no not the two maintenance
[28:18.640 --> 28:25.440]  men this is separate this is a these other three men were entirely different men I would
[28:25.440 --> 28:31.560]  I would have I would have bet money on the two being military absolutely military the
[28:31.560 --> 28:39.000]  other one who I later identified with the Strathmeyer but those three were different
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.360]  then then okay hold on we've got a final segment it's clear we're gonna have to get you up
[28:44.360 --> 28:49.160]  again and really debrief you on all this I mean you've told the story and it's been
[28:49.160 --> 28:54.680]  proven to be accurate and you have other eyewitnesses those that haven't died and the big issue is
[28:54.680 --> 29:01.720]  they're replaying the same propaganda again who do you think's behind it hi this is Alex

[29:10.600 --> 29:14.920]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and silver

[33:16.480 --> 33:25.000]  as feds involved in blast that killed 168 in 1995 and it's chilling i was talking to
[33:25.000 --> 33:28.960]  jane graham during the break and i said do you see the same propaganda clinton saying
[33:28.960 --> 33:32.440]  i hope there didn't have to be a terror attack to make the tea party shut up where do you
[33:32.440 --> 33:37.320]  see this going and what she said was chilling but but but finish up so it's trostmeyer and
[33:37.320 --> 33:43.920]  the other two guys in the garage you saw with the gray sticks of putty or butter now specifically
[33:43.920 --> 33:47.240]  where do you think this is all going who do you think from the evidence was behind this
[33:47.240 --> 33:53.200]  there are several things first of all the atf that morning and i think people need to
[33:53.200 --> 34:00.440]  understand that morning before the bombing there were two men dressed with atf ray jackson
[34:00.440 --> 34:07.000]  talking to a third gentleman outside in front of the murrow building that morning and uh
[34:07.000 --> 34:11.120]  i then found out you don't wear those unless there's something going down where they need
[34:11.120 --> 34:16.640]  to be recognizable immediately that's the one trostmeyer and the other two gentlemen
[34:16.640 --> 34:21.400]  that were in the garage the party before yes what i saw them have i was told that the
[34:21.400 --> 34:30.960]  what i thought was the putty was in fact actually what was i i gave a description of and i was
[34:30.960 --> 34:41.280]  told that c4 and um what i am saying is that if anyone goes back in history history repeats
[34:41.280 --> 34:49.640]  itself always but governments off always one of the things they have done they go in and
[34:49.640 --> 34:58.040]  they take care of of creating an incident creating a bombing or whatever in order to
[34:58.040 --> 35:05.880]  come back in and fix it so that whatever has happened they've got a solution of how they're
[35:05.880 --> 35:10.360]  going to fix the problem whether it be they're going to stay with the terrorist did it we
[35:10.360 --> 35:17.640]  now have to have uh additional protection we need to have uh blame it on the militia
[35:17.640 --> 35:24.520]  we need to blame it on um we we need to have a patriot act we need gun control what they've
[35:24.520 --> 35:31.880]  always got an agenda to take away rights and and to sell it to the public in math as we're
[35:31.880 --> 35:37.560]  protecting you we're the good guys we're taking care of you we're protecting you and i'm saying
[35:37.560 --> 35:45.000]  that this was done they can claim they can claim that they had no part in it because then
[35:45.000 --> 35:53.080]  they don't have any liability issues involved in it and even though they were behind it and they
[35:53.080 --> 36:01.640]  i imagine and feel very confident in that they uh they did uh have macabay on their payroll
[36:01.640 --> 36:10.200]  they did uh uh uh get uh strapped my out of the country with his luggage with everything a straight
[36:10.200 --> 36:16.360]  shot through was told by understand from others they were he's told do not go through his uh
[36:16.360 --> 36:22.520]  luggage just give him a free pass to go back to germany um there were other people who were
[36:22.520 --> 36:34.680]  involved and money that came from uh uh the uh islam countries and uh involved and so they
[36:34.680 --> 36:41.160]  could they could go from a very technical big big organization and having other people do their
[36:41.160 --> 36:49.880]  work through fbi cia and then say we don't know anything about it absolutely jane jane
[36:49.880 --> 36:57.240]  oklahoma city bombing survivor we're out of time uh in closing though are you concerned seeing the
[36:57.240 --> 37:01.400]  same build-up of propaganda claiming domestic groups are going to attack again the government's
[37:01.400 --> 37:06.520]  doing unpopular things they need to play the part of the victim again i see pre-programming
[37:06.520 --> 37:11.480]  for another oklahoma city do you agree absolutely i think they will do something i really believe
[37:11.480 --> 37:17.240]  that it's not a bombing i think it's going to be something that will have to do with water supplies
[37:17.240 --> 37:24.040]  or germ warfare of some sort but they're going they're they're planning ahead to do something dig
[37:24.040 --> 37:32.760]  in order to uh blame the militias blame the tea parties because the american public is getting
[37:32.760 --> 37:39.640]  set up with having their rights taken away being taxed to death and government is controlling
[37:39.640 --> 37:45.080]  everything now jane graham we're going to interview you again in the near future for a full hour
[37:45.080 --> 37:58.680]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcm radio network
[38:00.360 --> 38:08.600]  lord christopher montan is our guest probably the leading uh crusader with the most accurate
[38:08.600 --> 38:14.520]  information of the last 15 plus years fighting the green new world order as the un calls it
[38:14.520 --> 38:19.960]  in its internal documents sir flesh this out because i mean walk through this world government
[38:19.960 --> 38:25.160]  they're setting up these incredible documents that continue to get leaked and and declassified and
[38:25.720 --> 38:31.560]  stolen by some uh that are being put out i mean really gives us a picture and lets us know there's
[38:31.560 --> 38:37.960]  no longer any denial this is open global tyranny and we now have the head of the gaya movement
[38:37.960 --> 38:42.760]  over in england last week and the london guardian calling for a global dictatorship saying we can't
[38:42.760 --> 38:49.720]  have freedom the people are quote too stupid we must have rationing i mean these are open tyrants
[38:49.720 --> 38:54.760]  even hitler and the and the communists and and and other despots were not this open
[38:55.800 --> 39:02.360]  selling tyranny as if it's mother's milk that's a wonderful phrase telling tyranny of it and if
[39:02.360 --> 39:07.800]  it's mother's milk i must remember that one uh that'll do well in speeches i think uh i think
[39:07.800 --> 39:16.280]  you're quite right there is an extraordinary failure of will on the part of the people of
[39:16.280 --> 39:21.320]  formerly democratic nations like britain for instance which now lives under the dictatorship
[39:21.320 --> 39:27.160]  of the european commissar and of course it's therefore very easy now for people like the
[39:27.160 --> 39:31.880]  leader of the gaya movement to come out and say we want dictatorship because of course we've already
[39:31.880 --> 39:38.600]  got dictatorship in europe and we've already got cap and tax because hey we weren't asked about it
[39:38.600 --> 39:43.320]  none of our legislators were asked about it it was imposed by the european dictatorship
[39:43.320 --> 39:50.120]  and we all had to salute and obey and we had no say in the matter now the great thing about the
[39:50.120 --> 39:58.520]  united states of america and i'm speaking here in washington dc on tax day is that the united
[39:58.520 --> 40:06.280]  state is different because it has a constitution and the constitution at article one section one
[40:06.920 --> 40:13.400]  says this it says all legislative power here in grant it shall be vested in the congress
[40:13.400 --> 40:20.120]  united states which shall consist of a senate and house of representative full point now
[40:21.080 --> 40:27.720]  that means there is no dictatorship here for as long as the people of the united states
[40:27.720 --> 40:34.440]  are willing to keep themselves free and that i think it's a significant tea party movement
[40:34.440 --> 40:40.520]  which came from nowhere little over a year ago the grassroots suddenly decided they were going to
[40:40.520 --> 40:47.400]  stand up and be counted and i know that president obama and the other world government wannabes
[40:47.400 --> 40:54.040]  are saying that this is astroturf that is paid for by fossil fuel industries or other wicked evil
[40:54.040 --> 41:01.080]  capitalists who want to keep the world free and prosperous but the fact is this is a stirring
[41:01.080 --> 41:10.360]  of popular opinion such as has probably not been seen in the united states since that day in 1773
[41:11.080 --> 41:18.920]  when your forefather decided to pour tea into boston harbour now i've got a tip for you try
[41:18.920 --> 41:26.040]  pouring it into the tea part next time it tastes better that way remember this also the british
[41:26.040 --> 41:34.200]  tea tax was thousands of times cheaper than obama care and millions of times cheaper than what would
[41:34.200 --> 41:42.600]  happen to the united states if any part of the cap and tax regime now being wriggled and struggled
[41:42.600 --> 41:49.240]  through the senate were actually to be passed and obama obama is separately saying he's going to
[41:49.240 --> 41:55.560]  have the epa enforce it regardless that is open tyranny and club of rome behind eco fascist purge
[41:55.560 --> 42:01.720]  to criminalize climate skepticism an article at prison planet dot com quoting club of rome members
[42:01.720 --> 42:07.960]  saying we should all be arrested if we criticize anthropogenic global warming i mean they are
[42:07.960 --> 42:14.600]  openly saying arrest us they've called for your arrest previously when in truth they're the ones
[42:14.600 --> 42:19.000]  that have been caught committing this fraud and these crimes and you've called for al gore to be
[42:19.000 --> 42:26.200]  arrested yes indeed i think the real criminals who are i call them the global warming profiteers
[42:26.200 --> 42:32.840]  and in now gore's case the bracket is where he is now ignoring the order of a high court judge in
[42:32.840 --> 42:39.000]  the united kingdom but found 11th series nine series there as i say in his mortgage side by

[47:20.440 --> 47:22.440]  the
[47:33.320 --> 47:39.560]  word montan's so much to go over here uh i can't even keep track of it every day a new scandal
[47:39.560 --> 47:44.200]  every day it's proven that all their science is fraud premeditatedly and then this one
[47:44.200 --> 47:49.240]  financial times of london global warming graph attacked by study a key piece of evidence climate
[47:49.240 --> 47:54.440]  change science was slammed as exaggerated on wednesday by uk's leading statistician
[47:54.440 --> 47:59.240]  in a vindication of claims that global warming skeptics have made for years namely lord montan
[47:59.240 --> 48:04.920]  who first exposed the hockey stick and now we know that man has been involved with jones and others
[48:04.920 --> 48:10.680]  at the core group engaging in this uh what can only be called racketeering so let's go over this
[48:10.680 --> 48:17.560]  and the countless other uh scandals that have come out because it's positive this is all coming
[48:17.560 --> 48:21.560]  out but it's almost like they're coming out too quick we don't have time to take each one and get
[48:21.560 --> 48:27.240]  it out to the public it is quite extraordinary how in the last few months since the climate gate
[48:27.240 --> 48:32.840]  emails were first revealed there's been a kind of breaking of the logjam and scientists who for
[48:32.840 --> 48:40.440]  years have been wanting to write papers saying what montan's this is are now finding the courage to
[48:40.440 --> 48:46.280]  do so it's very interesting and and this this physical report from the uk is very significant
[48:46.280 --> 48:54.840]  because the uk has been the most true believing of all the uh sappy world governments on this
[48:54.840 --> 49:04.360]  issue and so much so that in 90 in 2004 when the russians under vladimir putin wanted to get a briefing
[49:04.360 --> 49:11.160]  for their academy of sciences on the global warming scare it was the british government they asked
[49:11.160 --> 49:17.160]  to send a delegation to do the briefing so david king went across with various people however um
[49:17.160 --> 49:25.000]  dr ila rionov of the russian academy of sciences who is a formidable mind is also very careful and
[49:25.000 --> 49:31.320]  he got together half a dozen skeptics one of whom told the story of what happened um so david king
[49:31.320 --> 49:38.120]  began coming out with the usual string of lies about how the climate was doomed etc etc uh fact
[49:38.120 --> 49:43.640]  after fact was simply incorrect and eventually professor paul writer who was one of those who've
[49:43.640 --> 49:48.680]  been invited the world expert on malaria who says that uh global warming will not affect the spread
[49:48.680 --> 49:53.880]  of malaria pretty much at all he went along and he stood up looking he said it's no good that david
[49:53.880 --> 49:59.240]  king these facts are simply not right and he began challenging the david king in fact david king was
[49:59.240 --> 50:05.480]  furious he had never faced such a challenge before he stormed out of the meeting taking the
[50:05.480 --> 50:11.400]  british delegation with him leaving the field entirely clear for the skeptics who then gave a
[50:11.400 --> 50:19.080]  marvelous horror comprehensive briefing to dr ila rionov who in summing up that meeting in just
[50:19.080 --> 50:25.160]  three pages of text gives one of the best summaries of why global warming is not and can never be a
[50:25.160 --> 50:31.320]  global crisis that any national academy of sciences has ever delivered but here's what happened next
[50:31.320 --> 50:38.440]  tony blair met madhya mere beauty at one of these endless world government summaries of the g8 or
[50:38.440 --> 50:45.480]  the g20 or the g77 or whichever piece of arithmetic is like and he said look let's do a deal if you
[50:45.480 --> 50:51.960]  agree to see uh agree to say that global warming is terrible and shut up your academy of sciences
[50:51.960 --> 50:56.920]  get it to say the opposite of what he believes to be true i will let you into the world trade
[50:56.920 --> 51:04.600]  organization with most favorite nation state that's what goes on there's no truth behind any of this
[51:04.600 --> 51:10.760]  and as you're quite right it's now very very difficult to keep up with the endless tide of
[51:10.760 --> 51:17.320]  information about how it's the sun and it's the sea and it's the cloud and as we're about to
[51:17.320 --> 51:23.240]  discover from iceman it's also volcano that really dominates the climate let me raise that let me
[51:23.240 --> 51:30.360]  raise that i have a twitter question uh for you it's it's uh says lord mongton are they aware that
[51:30.360 --> 51:36.040]  the volcanic eruption islam will decrease global temperatures uh yes they are aware of that because
[51:36.040 --> 51:40.760]  they know that if you get a really big eruption it looks as though this one may come into that
[51:40.760 --> 51:46.200]  category slightly early days yeah but if it carries on for a day or two more as it is then yes it will
[51:46.200 --> 51:52.440]  be a big one then that throws so much volcanic ash as you know it's shut down the whole of europe and
[51:52.440 --> 51:58.280]  the atlantic and all fried flights in britain are already grounded though curiously rakeovic air
[51:58.280 --> 52:04.600]  fault which is upwind of this is still free for traffic but um when even enough of that uh volcanic
[52:04.600 --> 52:10.600]  ash getting up into the atmosphere it stops the sunlight reaching the ground and that causes
[52:11.320 --> 52:17.160]  global cooling around half a degree sometimes even one degree celsius but only for six months to a
[52:17.160 --> 52:21.800]  year because eventually of course uh the rain comes with the ash which is heavier than the air
[52:21.800 --> 52:26.280]  gradually falls back to the ground and provides very nice fertilizer for everybody's soil
[52:26.280 --> 52:32.680]  does no harm uh and then the sunlight can get through much as usual again however what we did
[52:32.680 --> 52:40.840]  notice after the last really big eruption which was in cuba in 1991 what then happened was that
[52:40.840 --> 52:47.480]  there was a temporary reduction in cloud cover following the year after that eruption and persisting
[52:47.480 --> 52:53.320]  for about a decade and that of course caused an enormous increase in global temperature so we may
[52:53.320 --> 52:59.320]  paradoxically result of this uh eruption see a similar reduction in cloud cover again and that
[52:59.320 --> 53:04.760]  will cause a temporary global warming that could be quite rapid and of course this will allow the
[53:04.760 --> 53:10.440]  other side to blame it all on co2 but lord mongton hold on couldn't we just pay al gore a couple
[53:10.440 --> 53:17.080]  billion and he would give us an indulgence and wave a magic wand and and make the volcanoes not
[53:17.080 --> 53:23.800]  erupt because i mean after all danie glover and then a unofficial uh said that the earthquake uh in
[53:23.800 --> 53:29.880]  in hady was caused uh by global warming and now they're claiming the chilean earthquake uh was
[53:29.880 --> 53:35.400]  was caught but so if we just pay them some money will they stop the earthquakes oh just like that
[53:35.400 --> 53:40.200]  yes the palgore has only to stretch out his hand that the entire world will stop spinning around
[53:40.200 --> 53:45.560]  it will all fly off no i mean of course it's ridiculous one knows perfectly well that global
[53:45.560 --> 53:54.280]  warming cannot possibly cause or have any connection with earthquakes they are driven by a completely
[53:54.280 --> 54:00.120]  separate mechanism a long way below the earth surface wholly disconnected from the climate
[54:00.120 --> 54:05.320]  above and it is simple rubbish to try to digest otherwise of course you've noticed it's the
[54:05.320 --> 54:11.960]  fashion now that every kind of weather that is happening you've just had the coldest winter on
[54:11.960 --> 54:17.160]  record in most of north america and of course the warmest came straight out the climate extended
[54:17.160 --> 54:22.280]  oh yes that's what we would expect from global warming so here's the thing we expect earthquakes
[54:22.280 --> 54:26.840]  from global warming we expect warming from global warming we expect cooling from global warming
[54:26.840 --> 54:32.200]  we expect floods from global warming we expect droughts from global warming hang on a moment
[54:32.200 --> 54:37.640]  or we're really saying is that whichever direction the climate changes it they're going to blame it
[54:37.640 --> 54:43.160]  on global warming but that's my next point lord we're not we're not going to interrupt you because
[54:43.160 --> 54:47.800]  we've got limited time and these facts are so key we know they've been caught in fraud we know they
[54:47.800 --> 54:53.400]  have an agenda to control our lives and become kings over us we understand that and the general
[54:53.400 --> 54:58.440]  public's beginning to understand that but for me going back years it's just the asinine level
[54:58.440 --> 55:04.600]  i can go look up the federal government uh numbers on polar bears and they've gone from
[55:04.600 --> 55:12.920]  roughly 22,030 years ago in our area of the world in north america to over 50,000 and so when algore
[55:12.920 --> 55:18.680]  says the polar bears are all dying we know it's a lie when they say in the arctic penguins are dying
[55:18.680 --> 55:24.040]  because they're drowning we know they're an aquatic bird i mean the level of asinine line but but
[55:24.040 --> 55:27.080]  the one i want you to talk about now because we're showing video of this both the 20 year
[55:27.080 --> 55:33.480]  time lapse and then this year's time lapse from satellites we know the arctic expanded this is
[55:33.480 --> 55:39.320]  admitted uh by the greatest level in the last 30 years that's admitted by nasa and i'm showing a
[55:39.320 --> 55:45.800]  nasa satellite composite uh right now of it growing this year and then i've seen the environmental
[55:45.800 --> 55:52.840]  phonies on the news saying it's not true that the ice caps are melting i mean they are denying
[55:52.840 --> 55:58.200]  that the sun comes up in the morning they are outrageous liars it's extraordinary that on the
[55:58.200 --> 56:04.920]  polar bears for instance there were there were only 5,000 worldwide in the 1940s now depending
[56:04.920 --> 56:10.600]  on which survey you read there are 25,000 worldwide and you've seen one that says there are 50,000
[56:10.600 --> 56:15.800]  just in north america um and the fact is that that's not the profile of a species in imminent
[56:15.800 --> 56:21.080]  scientific extinction is it likewise the penguins and of course in the Antarctic the sea ice has
[56:21.080 --> 56:26.280]  actually been growing for 30 years and i was talking to one of the two believing scientists
[56:26.280 --> 56:31.720]  about that the other day and he said oh yes but that's caused by catabatic winds coming down off
[56:31.720 --> 56:37.960]  the arctic ice off the off the Antarctic ice cap and freezing the sea and of course yes it is because
[56:37.960 --> 56:44.440]  the arctic has been getting cooler over the last 30 years as the records very plainly show though
[56:44.440 --> 56:50.040]  you won't see that reported at the mainstream but that's what i'm saying lord monkin it's the boldness
[56:50.040 --> 56:55.480]  the i've never seen total contempt for the public and i guess some of the public really are dumb
[56:55.480 --> 57:01.960]  as the box of rocks to tell them the arctic and Antarctic are in danger of completely melting
[57:01.960 --> 57:06.520]  within the next five years as al gore was just saying a few months ago at Copenhagen i mean it
[57:06.520 --> 57:12.760]  is an asinine fraud to tell school children that it's all melting when they know good and well
[57:12.760 --> 57:18.600]  it's getting bigger well just to to go to the arctic and give you the latest figures the beginning
[57:18.600 --> 57:28.520]  of the spring ice melt in the Arctic began later this year than at any time since records began
[57:28.520 --> 57:55.880]  that's the truth of the matter max what did you do with the remote now what am i gonna do

[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:39.640]  roads we'll see how this goes but he's going to be to a parking spot in about 20 minutes so we're
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:45.320]  honored to have him uh robert bowman is a former director of the advanced space program development
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:50.600]  for the us air force and the fort and carter administrations and a former us air force lieutenant
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:58.200]  colonel with 101 combat missions over vietnam he holds a phd in aeronautics and nuclear engineering
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:03.640]  and despite his involvement in the space program in defense he emerged as an early public critic
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:08.360]  of the strategic defense initiative sti aka star wars during the reg administration is also a
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:15.320]  critic of georgia bush's administration's national missile system and uh he's a 9-11 researcher
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:20.760]  truther uh he's a great man and we're honored to have him on with us we're going to talk first
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:27.800]  before he gets parked about the latest 9-11 truth about uh the talk of iran supposedly having a nuke
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.800]  and they're going to nuke us the government now is saying homeland security's number one threat is
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:36.280]  the american people i mean we knew this was really being set up in the shadows but now it's out in the
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:42.760]  open the draconian or welly and system we're sliding into uh we're going to discuss this first
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:47.800]  with dr bob bowman and we're going to get into star wars how advanced it was what he can talk about
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:52.680]  that's that's been declassified or leaked that he's allowed to discuss versus what he projects
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:58.120]  they've got today dr bob bowman good to have you here with us thanks alex good to be back
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.800]  there is so much going on so much happening but before we go to break what do you think a
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:13.400]  uh uh 15 months into barack obama's administration what do you think of him well of course like so
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:22.040]  many i'm uh very disappointed uh particularly with uh uh the expansion of the war in afghanistan and
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:31.560]  extending it into uh pakistan and even talking now uh he isn't but you know others talking about
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:39.800]  possibility of going into iran and the new justifications of that based on uh this the
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:47.960]  supposed pentagon uh determination that she was they might have not only nuclear weapons but
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:54.920]  intercontinental ballistic missiles uh by 2015 if they get enough foreign health i think that's a
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:03:04.920]  bunch of baloney myself uh ballistic missiles are an extremely advanced high technology uh project
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:15.640]  and uh there are very few countries in the world that can pull that off and some of them have been
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:27.640]  trying for decades like north korea without success i think this is just uh another justification
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:36.760]  doing for what a minority in the pentagon wants to do uh and whether they're doing it because
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:42.680]  the israelis want to do it or they're doing it for some other dumb reason i don't know
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:51.400]  but with our military already overextended and completed and demoralized but uh it would be
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:04:05.320]  uh horrendous mistake iran is much stronger militarily a much larger country than iraq and
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:15.720]  i mean it would be i think the end of the united states as we know as we know it well sir i heard
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:21.800]  fox news last night on the radio saying iran now has intercontinental ballistic long range
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:27.320]  missiles and we've got to go in and it's all over the news today just like they said iraq had nukes
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:36.360]  or wmds i mean this is a replay of 2003 is it not of course it is and it's total malarkey well stay
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:41.160]  there sir we're going to come right back and get into this disaster for the united states
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:45.160]  we've got uh the russian president saying it could be the beginning of world war three
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.240]  we're going to talk about it all on the other side of dr bob bowman and we'll discuss homeland
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:56.760]  security now saying they're worried about iran nuking us with a suitcase nuke and working with
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:02.680]  domestic groups homeland security's got to be used on the right wingers now hello this is alex

[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:07.800]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:17.080]  we're going to go inside the secret of star wars program that's really a preemptive
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:23.000]  offensive sneak attack weapons system with dr bob bowman the former head of the star wars program
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.360]  he joins us as he hurdles down the highway in his uh rv
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:34.680]  robert bowman is a former director of the advanced space program development for the
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:41.320]  us air force holds a phd in aeronautics and nuclear engineering flew 101 combat missions
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:48.440]  over vietnam bombing missions and uh he joins us today and we really appreciate him coming on
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:52.120]  for stations that just joined us some people that just joined us we were talking about the
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:07:00.120]  new hype to go into iran they're changing the last letter of iraq the q and putting an in on it to
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:06.280]  make iran and they're saying they've got secret nuclear technology nobody else has got with no
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:13.080]  proof to make enriched uranium weapons grade uranium without centrifuges uh they're saying
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:19.960]  they've got icbms that can hit us now the pentagon says maybe in five years north korea is much more
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:24.360]  advanced and can't ever get them off the ground they blow up almost every time uh you just ride on
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:29.240]  the pad sometimes they go up a few thousand feet i mean even our own government the 50s 60s and 70s
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:34.280]  had large portions of their icbms when they were being tested blowing up or blowing up before they
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:39.400]  left the atmosphere uh but oh no and and they've got magnetic pulse weapons the news says that could
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:46.520]  destroy all electronics here's roiders iran missile may be able to hit us here's another one times of
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:53.240]  london pentagon chiefs raised threat of attack as iran taunts us with missile display so we
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:59.240]  could show our weapons but they can't and here's another one al qaeda chief in iraq captured killed
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:03.640]  never actually existed recaptured now killed again they they've announced over and over again
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:08.600]  they kill these al qaeda guys and never retract the last guy they killed even though they claim
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:13.960]  they kill them again uh and then and then here's another one over here uh where they're claiming
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:19.400]  that uh fox news is claiming that i'm looking for my article just print it again a fox news
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:25.160]  headline osama bin laden has a facebook and then it admits the next line it's not even him so this
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:30.040]  anybody could create a facebook say they're threatening us as osama bin laden and it always
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.960]  turns out it's fake but that's the proof that they're going to kill us so we don't give all our
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:39.640]  rights up and and as we went to break dr bowman you were saying this is all a fraud and that
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:46.360]  this could basically end the united states go through that scenario for us well we're being lied
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:54.840]  to again as as you know uh about all this stuff about iran as justification for the war that a
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:09:01.480]  few people want to get us into is if we didn't have enough illegal corporate wars of aggression
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:14.120]  right now uh and if we take on iran which is much bigger and more powerful than iraq was
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:23.400]  that we're still bogged down in iraq uh where are we going to get the military for that our
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:31.000]  military is already overextended with what they've got on their plate and of course what is russia
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:40.440]  going to do what is china going to do and uh are we just wouldn't we be taking on much more than we
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:48.520]  can handle and uh i believe we've already got more than we can handle and we've got to get
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:56.040]  out of where we are and absolutely no attack on iran it would be another
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:06.680]  false attack based on lies and uh i don't think they're they're going to do it because
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:16.040]  uh most of the people surrounding obama are kneel well they're
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:24.680]  they're trilateral commission they're globalists but most of them are not kneel cons and i think
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:33.000]  they're a little more rational than uh cheney and his minions uh pulling george w pushers strings
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:43.480]  so and the people in the pentagon now are more rational than uh rumspell than some of the generals
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:53.000]  he had uh working for him uh so i don't see them succeeding in uh pulling this off even with this
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:03.080]  massive campaign of lies uh but you know i'm going to work very hard to prevent it and uh i'll probably
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:11.880]  have to put out another open letter to the pentagon just like i did uh in 2007 to keep cheney from
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:16.920]  attacking iran then all right let me stop you there do it again dr let me stop you there and
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:21.000]  we'll go over some of what you said in your letter and they did listen to you we had fox falon
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:27.960]  refuse in 2008 uh to launch an attack on iran then so they've had a lot of people resign
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:32.840]  that basically stopped cheney and how that ties into 888 for those that don't know the times of
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:38.040]  one and other publications have now talked to diplomats and others who were in the meetings
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:45.320]  when cheney engineered through nato and georgia and israel the sneak attack on south osetia
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:51.160]  to test the russians and that cheney was saying let's go ahead and have a nuclear war with them
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:57.080]  and the and the head of the russian general staff the the air force had went on tv three days into
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:03.560]  it because they were landing more nato forces uh uh in georgian capital and said we may have to
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:09.720]  have a nuclear war with you and so this shows the megalomania and it appears with gates and others
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:16.200]  that we still have uh the cheney people in there and they're replaying all the same propaganda
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:23.720]  that we saw before oklahoma city before 9 11 and before the iraq war all rolled into one we've got
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:29.720]  fema drills of improvised nuclear devices going off we've got obama saying the number one threat to
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:38.280]  america is now domestic groups or iran setting off nukes inside the us uh again dr bowman couldn't
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:44.360]  they stage a false flag terror attack in the united states to blame on iran i mean isn't that their
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:50.440]  only card it appears they're going forward with this and an absent a huge false flag
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:55.720]  or a newt going off in paris who knows what staged by the military industrial complex
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:00.680]  how are they going to get this and is that a danger well i think you're exactly right
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:11.400]  the only way they would succeed in uh getting a war against iran is another false flag attack
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:21.880]  like 9 11 blaming it on iran and uh you know back a couple years ago when that the b-52
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:30.360]  flew from mine at the butthole as far as i know there's still possibly one nuclear weapon missing
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:43.320]  from that bomber and if the neocons have that then uh they could use it uh in a false flag attack
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:54.600]  blame it on iran claiming that iran smuggled it in in a suitcase they can't simulate an
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:14:00.120]  intercontinental ballistic missile attack on the united states that's too complicated everybody
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:07.240]  would know where it came from and they can't get an icbm and a launch pad for it to iran
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:15.480]  uh so i think you're right uh a false flag attack the only way they're going to pull this off and
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:23.880]  the thing is that the 9 11 truth movement is extremely valuable because we're continually
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:29.800]  letting them know that we're watching and if they try something else like they did in 9 11
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:35.400]  they've got to know that we're watching and we're likely to catch them in red-handed and that'll be
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:45.000]  the end of them and uh so uh that's one of the great values of 9 11 truth it it is deterring them
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.760]  from this kind of thing and uh but i know there are some crazies there who would like to try it
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:58.760]  anyway well let's take the minot dakota situation where they flew them down to louisiana and again
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:03.400]  the reports are there is a missing nuke i mean this was in the news this happened and then more
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:09.000]  than a dozen of the people who were at the bases who blew the whistle committed suicide or died
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:16.520]  within a week which adds another layer of uh evidence that this was an attempt to smuggle
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:21.400]  a nuke out of the chain of custody uh with the military and and again for those who don't understand
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:27.880]  what me and dr bob oman are getting at here you have to put your mind in the mind put yourself
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:33.000]  in the mind of the globalist of the controllers to realize how they're doing all of this and
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.240]  they'll never get away with an iran attack without staging an event and then now fema of these secret
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:45.320]  documents got leaked fema admits they're real but is ordering websites to remove them that in may
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:51.960]  they were going to have multiple simulated uh improvised nuclear device detonations in different
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:16:06.520]  parts of the us with the implementation of codex alimentarius it is clear that we must act quickly

[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:22.760]  restricted sale of many natural supplements including colloidal silver we must take immediate

[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:57.000]  safety she wrote on the elevator with mcvay and this is just one of many witnesses we've

[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:36.520]  people uh much of the time at your own expense okay i'm going to stop now go back to what you
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:42.120]  said as we went to break about when you really woke up to this global criminal network because we
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:48.680]  know that uh rumsfeld came right out of the ll lemonser crew years after he left i mean he's
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:55.720]  been there forever the youngest and then the oldest secretary of defense he sat at the feet of these
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:22:03.080]  cold warriors who wrote up operation north woods of course the plan to style to stage 911 style attacks
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:07.560]  so you were getting up to star wars and what it was really designed for then we'll talk about the
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:14.520]  real space program that's military versus the kind of tinker toy front uh that that the public knows
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:25.400]  as nasa dr bob bowman you've got the floor okay elix well yes uh i found out first
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:33.080]  hand that these crazies were planning on using my star wars program as part of a
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:44.040]  first strike against the soviet union and so i started opposing them on that and pretty soon of
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:51.720]  course i found i had less freedom of speech in industry than i've had in the military so before
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:23:03.560]  long i was out of industry and unemployed uh and i have been in that position now for 28 years and
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:14.840]  when i started fighting reagan and his crowd general danie bram and crazy george keegan
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:24.600]  and senator malkin wallop and edward teller and big cheney and uh what not and the ones that didn't
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:31.880]  die off like dead teller and danie grand the ones that didn't die off came right back with george
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:43.400]  w bush but what they did back then in 1982 and 1983 uh they got reagan who had not the clue what he
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:48.760]  was doing and i don't think george w bush did either they were useful idiots to these uh
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:24:00.040]  global criminals and they got reagan to find a defense guidance document in 1982
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:12.040]  which did two important things one it uh uh on the larger scale it ended our policy of
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:20.600]  of using the military to prevent to prevent a nuclear war and we went from a policy of war
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:27.160]  prevention to one of war fighting and in that document written of course by richard burrell
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:35.160]  part of the cheney crowd in that document he ordered the department of defense to prepare
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:45.800]  to fight and win a protracted nuclear war now that's chilling and uh that was leaked to the press
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:52.360]  by my old friend bob shear who used to be with the los angeles times and eventually of course
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:59.640]  because he was a good honest reporter he got himself fired he leaked that defense guidance
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:06.360]  document and there were many of us i think at the time who said well you know when we went
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:11.880]  into the military it was to protect the people of this country by preventing a nuclear war
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:19.240]  not going out and fighting an aggressive nuclear war so we wouldn't have any part of that kind of
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:26.200]  policy the second thing that that defense guidance document did was to order the department of defense
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:35.960]  to deploy star wars weapons in space as soon as possible and uh the document assigned those weapons
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:46.120]  two missions the first mission was to destroy opposing satellites and seize total military
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:55.240]  control of space the second mission was to destroy targets on the surface of the earth from space
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:02.280]  without warning there wasn't a word in that document about shooting down ballistic missiles
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:12.600]  that whole peace shield garbage was a total myth for consumption by the american people
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:17.480]  who would never have approved star wars weapons for offensive purposes
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:26.360]  and now and now we've gotten another bird's eye view into their mindset with cheney
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:33.000]  having georgia on 888 two years ago two and a half years ago launched that sneak attack
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:39.800]  and we've seen iraq we've seen uh afghanistan they now want to go into iran we see this doctrine
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:46.840]  in the peanut documents from 2000 where they say we need new pearl harbor events we need terror attacks
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:52.760]  to get the american people to go out there and wage these wars of empire but this isn't even an
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:57.320]  empire for the american people it's an empire we pay for it's an empire for these big megabanks
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:03.560]  and corporations please continue with the star wars program but let's let's start at the beginning
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:08.600]  uh because it's now declassified it's now public it's now admitted we heard that ronald reagan
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:17.880]  him launched our wars in 81 well i retired in 1978 and the program had been going on
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:28.200]  actually since 1962 at that time they called it bambi which stands for ballistic missile boost
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:36.120]  intercept isn't it lovely the way they take our weapons systems and give them a nice cuddly name
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:44.440]  like bambi and when the soviets for a while were working on a similar system they dubbed it a killer
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:54.600]  satellite so anyway that that's just uh you know a little trivia but at that time in the mid 1970s
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:28:02.440]  we were working on several pieces of it most of what we were working on was toward a system of
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:11.240]  laser battle stations and these laser battle stations were being developed in bits and pieces
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:22.360]  we had a contract with trw for the laser itself chemical laser we had a contract with kodak and
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:30.120]  with perkin elmer to build a 50 foot diameter actively cooled mirror which could reflect the
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:38.920]  laser beam to its target without burning up all right you are a ghost

[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:36.520]  to establish an oppressive world government i believe first of all that we now need nothing
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:40.840]  short of a world constitution for the global financial system global governance with the
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:46.120]  establishment of the g20 so it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else and

[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:05.240]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:09.880]  secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:13.960]  seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:18.440]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:23.960]  friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:29.800]  a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:34.440]  family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:39.320]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:45.000]  survival seed bank dot com that's survival seed bank dot com or give them a call at eight seven
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:51.560]  seven three two seven zero three six five that's eight seven seven three two seven zero three six
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:58.120]  five remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is alex jones
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:07.560]  for survival seed bank dot com coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:25.080]  broadcasting network network uh those uh those meteor gun weapons would that be du depleted uranium
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:35.000]  yes and i never said that at the time uh but uh yes uh their uh combination of titanium
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:46.760]  and depleted uranium uh titanium shell with the depleted uranium interior and guided by gps
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:53.880]  and i never revealed those details at the time but uh a couple years later i was debating
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:59.560]  one of the general abramson's kernels in the strategic defense initiative organization
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:07.640]  and uh i started talking about the pure offensive purposes of star wars weapons
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:18.600]  and uh in his rebuttal he said now you know very well that uh those uh titanium cones
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:24.680]  fired at the earth they're from space and directed by gps that program doesn't exist
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:30.680]  and he said well uh i i said well that's interesting because you just revealed
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:36.760]  classified details that i've never talked about and certainly didn't mention in my talk so obviously
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:43.480]  the program does exist and uh so since then i've been able to tell more details
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:54.200]  now when we talked you said you're also allowed to reveal that it it's robotic space planes and uh
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:59.240]  you know you've been out of this for a long time but i mean for when i've talked to people at
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:04.760]  nasa here in texas people who are on the original polo program and beyond and some of them we've
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:08.920]  had on air and you know these are guys you can watch the nasa film footage and there they are on
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:16.760]  mission control they say that more than 90 of nasa which is run by the pentagon and by the president
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:24.200]  is military and that basically verner von braun drew up the space shuttle in the 30s it's a 1960
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:31.240]  70s 80s technology and that the space program we see is really a facade for a larger black op
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:37.480]  system and that the militarization of space is just off the charts right now and uh i mean i mean
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:45.720]  what can you speak to along those lines right well uh space has been militarized for a very long time
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:53.160]  most of the the stuff up there are military satellites of one kind or another uh either
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:36:02.120]  reconnaissance uh satellite or communication satellites and various other things uh
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:09.640]  uh the weapons themselves may not be up there but the the gun sights are up there and all the rest
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:20.840]  of it so uh the whole military command and control system is space space so my task really uh when
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:25.640]  reagan was trying to do all this stuff was not to keep space from being militarized because it
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:31.880]  already was but to keep it from being weaponized because that's the line we simply did not want
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:41.000]  to cross we understood that when we put weapons in space that uh uh you know and particularly if
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.760]  they were the kind of stuff like star wars weapons with the kind of offensive capabilities they
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:53.400]  represented that the soviet union would have uh no choice but to start shooting them down as
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:37:01.560]  fast as we put them up and of course that was the task that was fairly simple the uh these space-based
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:09.720]  weapons are extremely vulnerable uh after all they follow fixed orbits so you always know in
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:15.800]  advance exactly where they're going to be at any given time uh the mirrors that we were designing
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:22.600]  could be destroyed by such exotic anti-satellite weapons as a bucket of sand or a bimble full of
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:30.120]  sewing machine oil so uh i always told the government look these things are never going to
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:37.160]  have any defensive value because of their enormous vulnerability they will be totally useless to an
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:44.360]  innocent party sitting back trying to defend himself because all the opposing side will do
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:52.040]  will be to knock out uh critical elements in the system first and then launch their missiles
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:59.400]  and even if you made these things so that they could in fact shoot down ballistic missiles which
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:05.640]  they couldn't do at that time uh they would be useless because they'd be put out of operation
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:12.600]  before the missiles were fired and i thought that was a you know pretty good argument uh it it also
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:19.720]  i also pointed out that having these star wars weapons on both sides is the ultimate military
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:29.640]  lunacy because it rewards whoever shoots first and what we had at that point in the seventies was uh
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:39.240]  a stable nuclear balance because whoever fired first lost the war and uh the new technology
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:44.920]  changed that all right doctor let's go back oh i'm sorry we got plenty of time to continue but
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:51.400]  while we've got you i want to go back yeah what can you tell us about the the robotic space planes
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:39:01.880]  uh not very much i mean if you take a design roughly based on the shuttle and you eliminate
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:11.720]  all the uh uh people from it and all the life support systems and all the oxygen and all the food
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:19.720]  and and all the fist tubes and all you know all of that kind of stuff and make it robotic with uh
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:29.160]  some computers more advanced than the the 1960s uh you can make the thing a heck of a lot smaller
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:36.440]  and make it perform a heck of a lot better for a lot less money so you can only you can only
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:43.480]  hypothetically uh talk to us about what's going on because that's classified right well now nasa
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:48.440]  admits they have been developing space planes and the pentagon admits you know like the b1
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:53.560]  bomber the b2 bomber were secret for many many years with the stealth bomber for 20 years before
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:40:02.920]  they rolled it out uh i mean can you talk about how big the military nasa is versus the public nasa
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:11.560]  the short answer to that is i don't know anymore you said you can speak to x-ray lasers the way
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:17.560]  i saw the news describe them one system is a nuke detonates and there's these rods in space that
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:21.720]  sounds pretty dangerous to the rest of the satellites and things and then fires are just
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:28.360]  incredibly high-powered array of beams through it destroying the weapon system in the process
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:38.760]  uh i mean is that one facet of x-ray lasers yes uh that is the original design of edward teller
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:49.000]  in the early 1970s and he worked on it uh there were several underground nuclear blasts
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:41:00.920]  that were designed to test this to see if they could actually get a x-ray laser to work
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:11.720]  when uh pumped by a nuclear explosion and they never were able to get it to work and uh
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:22.200]  uh i i lectured on this extensively in the early 1980s uh when teller was still pushing it
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:32.440]  uh and had gone public with it and it uh it is really a crazy roo Goldberg scheme and
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:42.120]  and is supposed to pump these beams of x-rays out these tubes in the uh tiny fraction of a second
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:49.240]  before the whole thing evaporates because of the nuclear explosion and those beams of x-rays
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:57.640]  have to be extremely accurately pointed because they have to be pointed at where the ballistic
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:11.160]  missiles will be when the x-ray beam gets there and uh from uh hundreds or perhaps even thousands of
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:27.400]  miles away so uh we were never able to get the pointing of those long wimpy rods accurate enough
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:34.760]  to do any good we were never able to get the x-rays to actually lay he's uh there were a whole raft
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:43:04.200]  of things that were just totally ridiculous one major world crisis away from having
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:09.080]  a totalitarian type of system the main event is the the wholesale destruction of the world the
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:15.160]  color the push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens friends

[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:09.640]  coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:23.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:34.360]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones every day
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:40.200]  sometimes multiple times daily newsweek time magazine london guarding in new york times
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:47.000]  write articles saying i'm calling for violence when all we've ever done is called for peace and
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:53.640]  non-violence pbs is here today nightline just call they want to do an entire eight minute profile
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:48:00.360]  on alex jones only uh it is very creepy because i never intended 14 15 years ago when i started
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:05.720]  getting on air uh to have had this big of an effect and to have learned as much as i've learned
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:10.520]  but it's a testament to all of you out there what you can do if you take action i don't like to talk
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:15.800]  about myself but i do get some concern and try to analyze this dr bob bowman what does it sound
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:20.520]  like to you that they're demonizing all of us now claiming we're for violence but specifically
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:24.920]  singling me out i mean you've been doing this longer than i have do you have any advice for me
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:31.400]  well i'd say to keep doing what you're doing and be just as public as you can
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:40.440]  because uh the more in the public eye you are the less they can do to you the people who get picked
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:49.720]  off are usually the ones that very few people have heard of and so i'd say just keep out there
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:57.480]  in the public eye and give them a black eye keep doing it alex that's all i gotta say but why are
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:11.560]  they coming after me so much i mean i mean you're effective that's why you know i i committed to
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:17.240]  this just like you committed to telling the truth and i've passed the point of return a long time
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:24.520]  ago but it is creepy to have the eye of the of the beast looking at you i'd like to talk about
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:29.400]  we talked a lot about that i'd like to talk a little bit about the present and the in the near
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:39.640]  future because let's talk about a little about the our plans for how to uh take back the country and
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:46.520]  stop all this crazy mess okay we're gonna do that and and we'll also have you back because
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:51.960]  you're you're a treasure dr bob bowman um but you know the old saying when you're over the target
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:56.680]  you're getting the flank like when you had sand missiles getting shot at you in vietnam but while
[01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:02.440]  we've got you picking your brain we talked during a break about cern if you think it's a danger you
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:07.400]  gave me your answer we also talked about and you said you were aware of it that the air force has
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:11.960]  talked about they're trying to develop any matter weapons i mean isn't that dangerous i mean even
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:23.720]  the testing of those talk about cern versus any matter weapons okay well uh cern the uh uh equivalent
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:33.640]  of book caven uh psychotron uh in uh the corner of switzerland and france there uh the european
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:42.840]  version uh cern i've been there i've i've uh been through it and looked at their operations i don't
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:49.960]  see anything nefarious about it i scientific knowledge can always be used for good or evil
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:56.920]  and all too often evil and they're producing new scientific knowledge uh they're also playing around
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:51:04.680]  a little bit with the collisions between matter and the antimatter and that theoretically can put
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:13.960]  out an awful lot of energy and uh it is dangerous and uh the experiments have to be extremely
[01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:22.520]  carefully controlled now as far as taking antimatter and weaponizing it uh i have never heard of
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:30.680]  any uh effort which has been anywhere near successful in making weapons out of this stuff
[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:43.640]  uh it's too hard to produce too hard to contain uh it i i i don't see anything uh of that time
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:51.000]  in the foreseeable future but it is dangerous from the physicist i've read mainline physicist
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:55.880]  that the pentagon admits they are playing with it and trying to isolate it i mean couldn't that
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:52:04.120]  create potentially some some type of chain reaction uh yes it is uh dangerous and uh there
[01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:08.280]  are a lot of things that are going on that are dangerous that i have been opposed to from the
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:17.240]  beginning like heart up in alaska and i've been up there to that facility uh i think it's extremely
[01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:25.480]  dangerous to dump huge amounts of money i mean of energy it's money to the people who sell them
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:34.920]  the gas that they're turning into energy dumping all that energy into the stratosphere uh is extremely
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:39.320]  dangerous they're talking about weather modification they're talking about mind control
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:46.760]  they're talking about all sorts of weird things but they don't really know what they're doing
[01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:56.680]  and uh they could have very negative consequences uh that they don't know how to control so i have
[01:52:56.680 --> 01:53:03.400]  been against uh uh the heart facility from the beginning well here's a quick question here's
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:09.080]  a quick example about four years ago in the interviews on youtube and google everywhere
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:14.600]  just alex jones interviews head of heart we had the private uh phd director but the military runs it
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:20.600]  and when i was contacted by harp and they said you want to clear up rumors we'll have the director
[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:26.600]  on i was contacted and so then it comes the day to get him on for an hour long interview and i've
[01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:32.440]  got some colonel bossing me around during the breaks and they've got the line under their control
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:37.800]  fading him down several times then he starts talking about we have a lot of fun he's like a mad
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:42.760]  scientist we can even you know uh ignite the atmosphere some nights and create artificial
[01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:48.840]  aurora borealis then they turn him down gripe at him during the break i mean this was bizarre uh
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:53.880]  but i mean it was really the director of harp we had on why would they contact me to come on
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:58.680]  and then why would he then start talking about igniting the atmosphere this didn't sound too safe
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:02.280]  yeah well uh
[01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:11.240]  they i guess figured that the colonels could control him but you know when scientists start
[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:20.600]  talking about their stuff they just start blabbing a lot of times and uh so that's what happened but
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:31.720]  uh uh we're trying to infiltrate the congress we're trying to get rid of almost all the incumbents
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:41.560]  uh in uh 2008 we had about 30 members of our organization the patriots run for congress
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:47.800]  around the country but they all ran as greens or libertarians or uh independents or write-ins
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:53.800]  and of course nobody got elected uh so we're taking a different path this time we're having
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:55:02.680]  each of our chapters groom people within the chapter to run in the democratic and republican
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:10.760]  primaries on my website i have a three minute video uh i call the smoking gun video it's all
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:17.880]  about world trade center seven i use it with friends and family and i use it when i lobby in
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:25.880]  congress and in three minutes they see the bbc broadcast world trade center seven uh collapsing
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:31.000]  before it did they see larry silverstein talking about pulling it and they see the building come
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:38.440]  down from about 12 different views uh an apparent controlled demolition of an intact building with
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:47.400]  no visible fires if that doesn't convince them that the whole bush official conspiracy theory
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:54.120]  is a lie i don't know what will well you can download that from my website and i would add the
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:59.480]  caveat you have six of the 10 commissioners saying it's a fraud to cover up i have ap and raw story
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:05.480]  here revealed ascroft tenet rumsfeld warned 9 11 commission about line it should not cross and
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:10.760]  told them don't investigate the attacks themselves and as a former intercept pilot uh i think that's
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:14.920]  some of the most convincing information when you've given your speeches in the past explaining
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:21.960]  that you were once an intercept pilot and they stood down absolutely they did uh hijacked airliners
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:27.080]  did not fly around for an hour and 40 minutes without being intercepted uh what about advanced
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:32.360]  weapons platforms and we know the nazis had the jets first and uh now i've seen mainstream
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:36.840]  articles claiming they had primitive a bombs did you ever run into any of that well i know they
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:48.280]  had the jet uh i don't know about any a bomb uh lasers yeah uh we we have uh much more effective
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:54.600]  and powerful lasers now uh but again it depends on what you want to do with it and you can
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:57:03.160]  uh knock aircraft down you can do a bunch of stuff from space but uh there's a lot of things
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:07.400]  that you still can't do with them what's more effective from your knowledge the space based
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:12.280]  are those big dc 10s with the big chemical lasers mounted in them so air to ground or air to air
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:19.400]  anti-missile again it depends on what you want to do if if you're trying to shoot down a uh a
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:28.360]  missile which is what they advertise these things for uh doing it with a 747 or any of those things
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:34.520]  is absolutely crazy because they themselves are so powerful
