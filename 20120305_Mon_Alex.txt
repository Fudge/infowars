[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he

[00:31.780 --> 00:39.040]  clarion call the 21st century Paul Revere's across the globe or writing not
[00:39.040 --> 00:45.360]  for just liberty here in the United States but 1776 freedom worldwide against
[00:45.360 --> 00:52.320]  the crony anti-free market globalist the monopoly men that are waging war against
[00:52.320 --> 00:58.280]  every sector of free society well we've got an extremely jam-packed transmission
[00:58.280 --> 01:03.480]  for you today Colonel Anthony Schaefer is going to be joining us to talk about
[01:03.480 --> 01:09.120]  the Iran situation the Syria situation the Libya situation of course he ran
[01:09.120 --> 01:14.240]  Operation Stratus IV Enable Danger and could have killed Osama bin Laden back
[01:14.240 --> 01:21.920]  in 2000 2001 and was ordered to stand down and it doesn't get any more high
[01:21.920 --> 01:26.720]  level with his intimate understanding of all this and how basically the war on
[01:26.720 --> 01:32.600]  terror is a fraud he'll be joining us coming up in the second hour and then
[01:32.600 --> 01:37.960]  I've seen these videos from a lady who's Syrian young lady she just goes by
[01:37.960 --> 01:43.400]  Syrian girl so that she can protect her identity a little bit just to break down
[01:43.400 --> 01:47.600]  what's really happening in Syria she's going to be joining us as well in the
[01:47.600 --> 01:55.320]  last 20 minutes or so of the show today I am going to air part of my speech I
[01:55.320 --> 01:59.360]  gave in Dallas and then later in the week we're going to put out the Orlando
[01:59.360 --> 02:01.920]  speech and the Dallas speech was powerful but I think the Orlando was even
[02:01.920 --> 02:06.800]  more powerful in ways that's at least what my crew said and so we're going to
[02:06.800 --> 02:10.440]  be airing that as well on the nightly news and its entirety in a few days and
[02:10.440 --> 02:14.800]  then I hear on the radio will play some snippets of that I will in the next few
[02:14.800 --> 02:20.000]  days have a big Dave Mustaine interview for you but we've taped part of that
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.760]  interview and then we're going to take some more with him a really a wide-ranging
[02:23.760 --> 02:31.280]  interview so that is coming up in the next few days and we'll premiere that
[02:31.280 --> 02:36.200]  here on the radio TV show at least part of it and then the rest of it on the
[02:36.200 --> 02:42.320]  nightly news and he'll be able to clarify a lot of the things he's been
[02:42.320 --> 02:47.680]  talking about lately now I've known Dave for years and talked him on the phone
[02:47.680 --> 02:51.720]  quite a bit you know in person some but just really getting to know him he's an
[02:51.720 --> 02:58.480]  amazing guy and really a nice you know caring person his wife's just a really
[02:58.480 --> 03:04.920]  nice person and it's great bill to spend some time with him but that is a side
[03:04.920 --> 03:10.160]  issue boy I had a wild night Saturday went to the show here in Austin and then
[03:10.160 --> 03:14.360]  driving out to my house later if I have time I'm gonna tell the story getting
[03:14.360 --> 03:19.280]  pulled over with Dave Mustaine his wife in the car and and then literally getting
[03:19.280 --> 03:26.360]  into the house 30 seconds before coast-to-coast AM called with mr. Wells
[03:26.360 --> 03:29.960]  did a great job on his show I've been up since about 5 in the morning I hope I
[03:29.960 --> 03:33.040]  did a good job on coast-to-coast covering the Breitbart situation by the
[03:33.040 --> 03:38.800]  way speaking of that the coroners come out and said six to eight weeks as you
[03:38.800 --> 03:41.040]  know three days ago but now they're saying yeah they're gonna look at foul
[03:41.040 --> 03:45.640]  play all bases will be covered because the coroner obviously thinks it's
[03:45.640 --> 03:52.000]  suspicious that they were gonna release this this this quote damning footage of
[03:52.000 --> 03:59.880]  Obama at communist meetings and palling around with known bombers and others and
[03:59.880 --> 04:03.520]  that he said he was gonna bring down Obama and then you know pretty much what
[04:03.520 --> 04:08.120]  happened to him saying that he was gonna vet him you'd be a fool not to
[04:08.120 --> 04:16.560]  question and I saw in the well in Yahoo news and in British newspapers and in
[04:16.560 --> 04:24.840]  the Washington Times of all places in their communities area social journalism
[04:24.840 --> 04:30.600]  and independent voices one of their columnists it's ask a question of this
[04:30.600 --> 04:37.200]  this writer is the name of the column and they say right Martin murder now past
[04:37.200 --> 04:44.320]  the Kool-Aid Kool-Aid is like being an occult in not questioning I mean it's
[04:44.320 --> 04:51.600]  it you're called a conspiracy theorist when you question known liars so if that
[04:51.600 --> 04:57.000]  means I'm a Kool-Aid drinker okay then pass the grape Kool-Aid because I just
[04:57.000 --> 05:01.440]  don't buy what I'm told big show coming up stay with us a little over a year ago
[05:01.440 --> 05:06.160]  I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal
[05:06.160 --> 05:10.320]  that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that
[05:10.320 --> 05:13.920]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[05:13.920 --> 05:18.160]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all
[05:18.160 --> 05:22.800]  of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[05:22.800 --> 05:27.160]  themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best
[05:27.160 --> 05:31.800]  vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered young Jevity the

[05:59.680 --> 06:03.360]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[06:03.360 --> 06:07.720]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[06:07.720 --> 06:11.880]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[06:11.880 --> 06:15.920]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[06:15.920 --> 06:19.800]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[06:19.800 --> 06:24.080]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[06:24.080 --> 06:28.240]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[06:28.240 --> 06:32.560]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[06:32.560 --> 06:36.240]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[06:36.240 --> 06:40.440]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[06:40.440 --> 06:43.800]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[08:28.080 --> 08:33.520]  from Syria this goes by Syrian girl to give us their take on what's actually
[08:33.520 --> 08:38.000]  happening there we're gonna be breaking it all down today
[08:38.000 --> 08:45.480]  wow where to start Obama has come out and said I will not hesitate in using
[08:45.480 --> 08:51.240]  force to block Iran's nuclear threat from Iran proxy wars are being launched
[08:51.240 --> 08:55.160]  against Syria Libya they've already overthrown Libya and Egypt they're
[08:55.160 --> 08:58.800]  putting al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood in charge they're trying to
[08:58.800 --> 09:02.960]  get rid of Assad and put al Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood in charge on record
[09:02.960 --> 09:07.000]  the West is shipping arms in on record and now admits they want to start a
[09:07.000 --> 09:12.280]  bombardment that they call a peace bombardment of Syria and they'll call
[09:12.280 --> 09:17.480]  with humanitarian the undoubtedly there's been upwards of 40,000 killed in
[09:17.480 --> 09:23.280]  Libya racial cleansing going on by the Arab grips al Qaeda backed against the
[09:23.280 --> 09:29.480]  black Libyans all of this is going on and we're told oh it's democracy it's an
[09:29.480 --> 09:35.120]  uprising that'd be like if the globalist the UN funded let's say Mexican
[09:35.120 --> 09:41.160]  nationals to the la reconquista infasaur movement that's funded at the
[09:41.160 --> 09:46.000]  university level by by the big banks to create division divide and conquer you
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.200]  know try to overthrow the Southwest and break part of the country off that's
[09:50.200 --> 09:55.440]  actually being taught being pushed and then Russia came over here China and was
[09:55.440 --> 09:59.120]  bombing the United States because the government was trying to keep the union
[09:59.120 --> 10:02.880]  together and saying no this is the United States I mean that's the type of
[10:02.880 --> 10:08.400]  stuff we're talking about here and Syria is not being attacked and civil war is
[10:08.400 --> 10:13.120]  not being stirred and they've got members of the Syrian military of course
[10:13.120 --> 10:17.840]  that have been paid off and have defected I mean it's a war just like it was a war
[10:17.840 --> 10:21.400]  when they brought al Qaeda in to attack Qaddafi I'm not a fan of Qaddafi
[10:21.400 --> 10:26.440]  rest in peace but compared to al Qaeda I mean I mean he was a stabilizing force
[10:26.440 --> 10:31.240]  sure 20 years ago you know he was using asymmetrical warfare against the West
[10:31.240 --> 10:39.040]  trying to basically use guerrilla warfare against overwhelming force and I'm
[10:39.040 --> 10:44.600]  an American I don't like that but the point is is that he was also under attack
[10:44.600 --> 10:50.480]  so he was responding and now he came in seven years ago did deals with the West
[10:50.480 --> 10:55.440]  gave up his weapons programs invested his money in big US and European banks
[10:55.440 --> 10:59.920]  hung out with presidents and prime ministers let all the Western industry
[10:59.920 --> 11:06.600]  in and they just use that to come in and infiltrate with spy organizations so
[11:06.600 --> 11:13.000]  this is a serious situation it's the same thing with Russia I know Russia's KGB
[11:13.000 --> 11:18.840]  and now FSB run I know it's got all of its own problems I know there's election
[11:18.840 --> 11:23.360]  fraud classically there but I'm not naive enough to say oh but that's not
[11:23.360 --> 11:27.840]  happening in the United States and watch our support our supposed corporate
[11:27.840 --> 11:34.160]  media sit there and tell us that all Russian elections are fraud but not ours
[11:34.160 --> 11:37.040]  then you know none of that goes on here when there was clear fraud in Maine
[11:37.040 --> 11:46.280]  Iowa 100% and 90 plus percent you know but proven in Nevada South Carolina and
[11:46.280 --> 11:52.440]  other areas so now we knew this was coming the West and the banks that have
[11:52.440 --> 11:57.260]  hijacked our nation and that have hijacked Europe and England are now
[11:57.260 --> 12:03.720]  openly with color revolution groups and George Soros organizations openly trying
[12:03.720 --> 12:08.320]  to overthrow Russia and cause a civil war there and folks the Russians have
[12:08.320 --> 12:14.240]  got 10,000 plus nuclear weapons and the Russian military is not gonna go along
[12:14.240 --> 12:22.440]  with this the West already back in 2008 on the day the Olympics began NATO back
[12:22.440 --> 12:26.400]  groups out of Georgia attacked Russian held areas of South Ossetia and
[12:26.400 --> 12:32.440]  Abkhazia and our media ran a hoax saying Russia had attacked and I went on air for
[12:32.440 --> 12:35.800]  the first hour or so and said I can't believe Russia attacked these areas just
[12:35.800 --> 12:40.040]  because I couldn't believe CNN would lie like that but then it started coming out
[12:40.040 --> 12:43.320]  wait a minute NATO attacked and they slaughtered the Russians and their
[12:43.320 --> 12:48.040]  barracks and then the Russians rolled in with nukes when NATO aircraft were
[12:48.040 --> 12:53.320]  landing to with US and NATO troops to fight the Russians and the Russian
[12:53.320 --> 12:56.640]  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff came out and said okay we've moved in
[12:56.640 --> 13:01.720]  intermediate nukes we're gonna fire on you this was you know in European TV on
[13:01.720 --> 13:07.400]  Russian TV nothing in US television and then the Georgians pulled back NATO
[13:07.400 --> 13:11.960]  pulled back but that's how close we came to war again the Russians did not
[13:11.960 --> 13:20.440]  blink they rolled in nuclear weapons and rolled in heavy armor on record and and
[13:20.440 --> 13:25.200]  I've learned just from three and a half four years ago it's always a learning
[13:25.200 --> 13:30.040]  process I mean I turn on the TV it's seven eight in the morning and there's
[13:30.040 --> 13:33.480]  the president of Georgia saying we're under attack from Russia and the news is
[13:33.480 --> 13:38.960]  Russian tanks are pouring in for no reason and I by 11 I'd heard it was
[13:38.960 --> 13:42.160]  conflicting reports but I said well there's no way they're lying while Russia
[13:42.160 --> 13:47.520]  attacked Georgia and then I looked like a fool a few hours later it goes all
[13:47.520 --> 13:51.680]  over the European press everywhere no actually in the middle of the night they
[13:51.680 --> 13:56.720]  attacked these two areas went into the UN zones where the Russians are at this
[13:56.720 --> 14:00.560]  has been a disputed zone since the end of World War two and just killed them and
[14:00.560 --> 14:04.240]  then later that was all confirmed you know in scholarly reports and even our
[14:04.240 --> 14:10.080]  media about a week later had to admit it but this is craziness this is craziness
[14:10.080 --> 14:15.440]  to have this type of stuff going on and the Russians sent mobile missile
[14:15.440 --> 14:21.320]  launchers mobile medium range of those big trucks with the big nukes on the
[14:21.320 --> 14:26.680]  back and went on I mean we played the clips here went on Russian national TV
[14:26.680 --> 14:32.080]  and said we're preparing to use nuclear weapons I mean and they were aiming
[14:32.080 --> 14:38.000]  them at those bases where US troops were landing and the Russians were would have
[14:38.000 --> 14:48.760]  pulled the trigger guaranteed nuclear war boom that's how it starts I mean
[14:48.760 --> 14:53.560]  didn't Napoleon learn didn't Hitler learn just look the Russians have got all
[14:53.560 --> 15:03.120]  their technology mixed with you know primitive dark-aged type stuff medieval
[15:03.120 --> 15:10.800]  and it's insanity the top Chinese generals said six months ago they're
[15:10.800 --> 15:13.400]  preparing for war with the US they've never openly talked like that then the
[15:13.400 --> 15:17.520]  president two months ago said we're preparing for nuclear war this is who
[15:17.520 --> 15:20.160]  holds two trillion dollars of our debt this is where all our industry has been
[15:20.160 --> 15:24.000]  shipped with tax incentives and the globalists are playing America off
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.760]  against the Chinese and the Russians and then we all lose we all lose it's the
[15:29.760 --> 15:33.680]  bankers that are trying to lobby to take our second amendment it's the
[15:33.680 --> 15:36.480]  globalists that are lobbying to overthrow the Bill of Rights and
[15:36.480 --> 15:42.240]  Constitution it's the globalists that are the main threat I'm not a fan of the
[15:42.240 --> 15:45.480]  communist Chinese I hate them and constantly talk about how horrible they
[15:45.480 --> 15:50.400]  are and the bankers are in bed with them at a certain level but they all stab
[15:50.400 --> 15:54.680]  each other in the back I don't like the stuff Russia does killing journalist and
[15:54.680 --> 15:59.640]  all the rest of it but the point is Russia is not over here Russia's not
[15:59.640 --> 16:03.640]  signing the NDAA Russia's not launching wars without congressional approval
[16:03.640 --> 16:07.720]  Russia's not shipping guns into Mexico to blame my second amendment and your
[16:07.720 --> 16:13.680]  second amendment and again George Soros who funds all these color
[16:13.680 --> 16:18.480]  revolutions all around Russia trying to and the NATO comes in and moves
[16:18.480 --> 16:23.320]  weapons in to try to start a new war with Russia and now this same guy trying
[16:23.320 --> 16:30.240]  to overthrow my country with a fake socialist revolution is trying to
[16:30.240 --> 16:34.920]  overthrow Russia and that's in the news today and so this is going to get the
[16:34.920 --> 16:44.640]  Russians completely into a offensive stance via defense against the West and
[16:44.640 --> 16:49.560]  the truth is Russia's gotten away from the New World Order it's its own criminal
[16:49.560 --> 16:52.840]  enterprise all these governments Iran's its own criminal enterprise see people
[16:52.840 --> 16:56.840]  seem to think well is it Russia good America bad or is it America good Russia
[16:56.840 --> 17:03.000]  bad or is it Iran good America bad or or Iran good America you know Israel all
[17:03.000 --> 17:09.000]  this it's it's kleptocracies it's corrupt governments all use the same
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.240]  tricks governments are corrupt about 99% of the time historically read what
[17:13.240 --> 17:17.040]  George Washington Thomas Jefferson said really what Machiavelli wrote in two
[17:17.040 --> 17:23.840]  books 500 years ago in Italy or one of the provinces of one of the city
[17:23.840 --> 17:30.920]  states that is now Italy today the point is that I understand how these powerful
[17:30.920 --> 17:34.640]  forces these banks that create the money and now pretty much rule the world
[17:34.640 --> 17:38.960]  are playing us off against each other we'll all go in debt to fight with each
[17:38.960 --> 17:42.920]  other Russia as it's being attacked politically and militarily we'll use
[17:42.920 --> 17:47.040]  that to take liberties Iran is being attacked by the globalist we use that
[17:47.040 --> 17:51.960]  to take liberties and dig in deeper the West while it's in these cold wars and
[17:51.960 --> 17:56.120]  hot wars and economic currency wars with these other countries that'll be used to
[17:56.120 --> 18:00.160]  take more liberties don't you get it whether it's Israel whether it's Iran
[18:00.160 --> 18:04.400]  whether it's China the United States Canada all these governments and
[18:04.400 --> 18:09.400]  government class and the and the mega corporations and insider monopoly men
[18:09.400 --> 18:14.800]  that control governments that they stand to gain from war and crisis and
[18:14.800 --> 18:21.280]  terrorism I've always explained that the Muslim extremist there are Muslim
[18:21.280 --> 18:25.120]  extremists who hate America and hate Christians and all this but that's a
[18:25.120 --> 18:29.480]  minority and then when you go research them they're the ones funded by the
[18:29.480 --> 18:35.560]  globalist on record every time and the government lets them come in but then
[18:35.560 --> 18:37.880]  Europeans and people that want to immigrate here it's almost impossible
[18:37.880 --> 18:44.160]  even get a visa to come work here because it's all part of the Balkanization
[18:44.160 --> 18:48.120]  this is the globalist great game of divide and conquerors with the Roman
[18:48.120 --> 18:52.640]  Empire used then through the Dark Ages the Venetians kept that system after
[18:52.640 --> 18:56.240]  Rome fell went into the Byzantine Empire was picked up later in France and
[18:56.240 --> 19:00.800]  then it moved to England and it's a management system developed by the
[19:00.800 --> 19:07.160]  Romans over the 300 year plus history well I mean you've got the beginning of
[19:07.160 --> 19:10.400]  Rome going on for a couple hundred years and you've got the you know it's it's
[19:10.400 --> 19:14.840]  real rise for a few hundred years and then slow decent integration that took
[19:14.840 --> 19:18.800]  300 years but I mean technically you could say the Roman Empire Roman system
[19:18.800 --> 19:27.040]  went on for 600 years but and it came out of Greek systems but it's early on it
[19:27.040 --> 19:31.960]  was Spartan and extremely moral and then you saw what it degenerated into the
[19:31.960 --> 19:36.800]  popularized image of Rome is what it degenerated into not what it was it was
[19:36.800 --> 19:44.040]  Spartan it was like a Spartan graft into that area all right we're gonna come
[19:44.040 --> 19:48.680]  right back and get into news off the chart there have been federal rulings

[24:27.920 --> 24:33.320]  to a few years ago because he and his wife were literally homeless living on
[24:33.320 --> 24:36.880]  the street and now they've gotten jobs and gotten back on their feet but but
[24:36.880 --> 24:39.520]  they were listeners and they came out to some events so I gave them some
[24:39.520 --> 24:44.120]  cameras and they shot at the Austin kite festival yesterday that I almost went
[24:44.120 --> 24:51.600]  to the military National Guard out there loading children on to buses and
[24:51.600 --> 24:57.480]  running security now they've got MPs in San Antonio now at the Riverwalk I have
[24:57.480 --> 25:03.680]  seen it myself they are doing crowd control this is just all part of total
[25:03.680 --> 25:08.320]  acclimation to have military on the streets of America and it's an admitted
[25:08.320 --> 25:12.640]  Pentagon program to put military on the streets again which is illegal which
[25:12.640 --> 25:15.440]  which means our country is basically being occupied and they have these
[25:15.440 --> 25:20.640]  acclimation exercises to get you ready for martial law going on everywhere and
[25:20.640 --> 25:24.960]  next after they show up at events there's the helicopters flying over it's
[25:24.960 --> 25:32.200]  all part of conditioning next they will start bag searching I mean I get reports
[25:32.200 --> 25:37.600]  every week where Alabama Tennessee California Nevada Arizona Michigan
[25:37.600 --> 25:43.200]  Vermont I mean they're all over YouTube where people go to a high school basketball
[25:43.200 --> 25:48.640]  game and there's Marines with guns searching the kids regular Marines
[25:48.640 --> 25:52.320]  there's news articles I've had state reps on in Tennessee you pull up there's
[25:52.320 --> 25:57.960]  regular Marines regular army TSA commanding them state police barking at
[25:57.960 --> 26:02.640]  people pulling people out of cars it's all just martial law that's what TSA at
[26:02.640 --> 26:06.240]  the airport grabbing your genitals is and if you're watching on prison planet
[26:06.240 --> 26:10.480]  TV I just showed some of that video devastating so I'm getting a hold of
[26:10.480 --> 26:16.560]  Paul Watson right now and he does great boil down articles I won't just show
[26:16.560 --> 26:20.800]  you this I'm going to show you the Washington Post eight years ago saying
[26:20.800 --> 26:24.400]  during attacks your children will be taken from the public schools you'll be
[26:24.400 --> 26:28.360]  made to turn your guns in and come to a FEMA camp to get them I knew about this
[26:28.360 --> 26:33.080]  because listeners in Missouri in the Ozarks sent us footage of the army
[26:33.080 --> 26:38.000]  taking kids to a FEMA camp as part of a drill with the kids hands up being loaded
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.840]  and then last year we went to Denver during an urban warfare drill not knowing
[26:41.840 --> 26:45.640]  what we would see and it shows the kids being taken from public schools to the
[26:45.640 --> 26:52.160]  sports stadium the army FEMA everybody so see we won't just show you this
[26:52.160 --> 26:56.120]  latest thing in Austin we'll give you background integrated full spectrum
[26:56.120 --> 26:59.600]  analysis in fact I want to call Watson right now make bring up before the show
[26:59.600 --> 27:02.600]  showed me the video and I was watching it again during the break it just it's
[27:02.600 --> 27:06.640]  pure evil and again whenever I talk about it I'm gonna be the bad guy it was I
[27:06.640 --> 27:09.360]  said there'd be military on the streets it happened I said they get rid of
[27:09.360 --> 27:11.900]  positive commentators it happened I said they passed laws they could
[27:11.900 --> 27:14.920]  secretly disappear you it happened I said they'd announce a global bank of
[27:14.920 --> 27:22.880]  the world to fix a currency derivatives crisis 13 14 years ago by 2012 happened
[27:22.880 --> 27:27.040]  exactly as I said I broke down I mean just hundreds of issues I told you
[27:27.040 --> 27:32.000]  exactly what's gonna happen I told you a purge would start against Republican
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.560]  talk show host doesn't mean they're perfect it just means there's a purge
[27:34.560 --> 27:39.200]  going on they're now trumping up stuff on Limbaugh really going after him New
[27:39.200 --> 27:43.200]  York Times and others trying to bring it down they're black of course they're
[27:43.200 --> 27:46.180]  blackmailing Rupert Murdoch that they'll arrest him and his son the
[27:46.180 --> 27:49.600]  Justice Department openly is saying if he doesn't just roll over start worshiping
[27:49.600 --> 27:52.960]  world government not say Rupert Murdoch's good the point is it's factions
[27:52.960 --> 27:57.320]  fighting with each other bright bark dies there's total demonization of drudge
[27:57.320 --> 28:03.600]  going on dirty tricks and just insane stuff being launched against us just
[28:03.600 --> 28:09.960]  total fiction frauds from every angle because it's all coming down I mean can
[28:09.960 --> 28:13.960]  you imagine out of all the hated people out there that you know at least for the
[28:13.960 --> 28:18.920]  Bill of Rights Constitution Second Amendment I'm the most hated Michael

[28:37.920 --> 28:41.760]  I'm not gonna get into that stuff I was told it's it's it's too revealing about
[28:41.760 --> 28:46.920]  who the sources are but this is real okay this is real what's going on you
[28:46.920 --> 28:50.320]  you think there's gonna ship guns in a Mexico to blame the Second Amendment and

[28:57.000 --> 29:00.720]  other agencies I mean this is in the federal courts this is admitted and when
[29:00.720 --> 29:03.960]  it when it's brought up they declare national security you think they got the
[29:03.960 --> 29:09.080]  troops growing opium and it is going from 10% of world supply to like 92% in
[29:09.080 --> 29:13.280]  just 10 years with the troops growing it and guarding it loading on C-130s

[33:29.480 --> 33:34.200]  my local affiliate trying to get us kicked off the air
[33:35.640 --> 33:40.320]  the military is at the kite festival that I've gone too many times with my
[33:40.320 --> 33:48.000]  children directing people around bossing everyone around the next time of

[33:52.800 --> 33:56.240]  with dogs that's the ultimate form of domination and they're there
[33:56.240 --> 33:59.440]  conditioning our military who are good men and women to engage in these
[33:59.440 --> 34:02.680]  unconstitutional activities it's all about getting the police the military
[34:02.680 --> 34:11.280]  everybody ready I interviewed 14 years ago now no it's 1997 more than 14 years
[34:11.280 --> 34:16.920]  ago Al A. Philippus the chief of police of San Antonio who had the Delta Force
[34:16.920 --> 34:21.040]  come in with bags of money and try to buy him off to basically have a covert
[34:21.040 --> 34:25.400]  military takeover of San Antonio first they buy off your police just like they
[34:25.400 --> 34:32.000]  take over a third world country it's a force of multiplication structure they
[34:32.000 --> 34:36.000]  were buying off other city officials even after he said no they brought them
[34:36.000 --> 34:42.520]  suitcases of cash you know how special forces takes over a country I mean

[39:57.240 --> 40:02.880]  this is all Cass Sunstein it's talk radio it's anybody criticizing there it is
[40:02.880 --> 40:06.120]  media matters warrants Fox and it says in there we're going to infiltrate from
[40:06.120 --> 40:11.840]  within we're going to tear them up what they do is Cass Sunstein the White
[40:11.840 --> 40:14.960]  House says they pose as quote conspiracy theorists that means people that
[40:14.960 --> 40:21.320]  question known liars and then get in the fights going and tell lies about people
[40:23.360 --> 40:28.280]  and it just goes on the strategy that we had towards Fox was basically a
[40:28.280 --> 40:32.280]  strategy of containment said Brock media matters chairman and founder and former
[40:32.280 --> 40:36.880]  conservative journalist and the groups main aim had been to challenge the
[40:36.880 --> 40:39.800]  factual claims don't know scroll down because I know it's in that article just

[40:50.480 --> 40:56.280]  then there's links to the memo itself this isn't a game these people Obama
[40:56.280 --> 41:01.720]  shipped tens of thousands of firearms to Mexico to cause carnage in death to blame
[41:01.720 --> 41:05.640]  the Second Amendment and those memos are all public to then call for a ban of all
[41:05.640 --> 41:10.640]  semi-auto the attorney general and the president are both on record in federal
[41:10.640 --> 41:14.760]  court filings and legislation they supported for total abolition of quote
[41:14.760 --> 41:21.240]  civilian ownership of firearms they want total and complete gun bans they're
[41:21.240 --> 41:27.480]  real they're real this is real revolutionaries by foreign megabanks that

[42:11.120 --> 42:15.760]  police military talk shows everybody this is yet the fight for America it's
[42:15.760 --> 42:19.880]  happening we might have basically a Bolshevik takeover funded by the big
[42:19.880 --> 42:24.000]  banks same ones that funded the takeover of Russia and they will use the giant
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.760]  hordes of people on welfare who will do anything to get those checks as their
[42:27.760 --> 42:31.600]  political armies and the police and the bureaucrats and everybody paid off half

[42:45.720 --> 42:53.080]  demonize and make fun of all day you ever notice that all these cops when
[42:53.080 --> 42:57.240]  you're watching cop shows and the hero says you know forget the Constitution I
[42:57.240 --> 43:00.840]  hate it and they all have high fives and then bust the bad guy you're being
[43:00.840 --> 43:06.760]  trained to hate America you better decide now and let me tell you just like
[43:06.760 --> 43:10.360]  Russia just like Germany all of you just like the Communist Chinese and every
[43:10.360 --> 43:15.760]  just like bullpot in every case the group that is seen as opposition but
[43:15.760 --> 43:20.680]  within the power structure when a real takeover happens you are the number one
[43:20.680 --> 43:25.920]  people they're going to target they are coming after you you don't just think
[43:25.920 --> 43:28.560]  they have veterans as the number one enemy and all these secret reports we
[43:28.560 --> 43:34.160]  got to the media admit were real my act homeland security and others they hate
[43:34.160 --> 43:38.240]  police they've got all the good cops and databases if you're a good police
[43:38.240 --> 43:41.960]  officer that changes people's tires and it doesn't want a social climb and
[43:41.960 --> 43:46.160]  doesn't do corrupt stuff you've been put in a file they've assessed you you think

[43:52.080 --> 43:56.600]  know your surfing habits everything they got a file on you they the devil the
[43:56.600 --> 44:00.800]  new world order already knows you're the enemy you're already under attack
[44:00.800 --> 44:04.960]  they're all ready gonna come after you if they bring this in the only chance
[44:04.960 --> 44:10.960]  we've got is to stand up to this and stop playing games used to I'd have to
[44:10.960 --> 44:14.240]  travel a hundred miles to show a military takeover now I can drive right
[44:14.240 --> 44:20.480]  up the road three miles they got the TSA on the streets in San Antonio Houston
[44:20.480 --> 44:25.520]  Dallas now I was reading they're gonna start coming to Austin everything's
[44:25.520 --> 44:31.640]  getting shut down except the border they got the cops all roided up crazed out
[44:31.640 --> 44:35.440]  of their minds oh we're gonna have a war with the American people ladies and
[44:35.440 --> 44:38.520]  gentlemen I got more reports gun sales were record last year they're now
[44:38.520 --> 44:42.440]  topping that record the guns are selling out everywhere ammo selling out
[44:42.440 --> 44:47.200]  everyone's buying firearms liberals are all waking up buying them the globalists
[44:47.200 --> 44:50.720]  have to bring in tyranny folks because the revolution's here the second
[44:50.720 --> 44:56.880]  American restoration is here it's here we now know that revolutionaries with
[44:56.880 --> 45:01.560]  big banking financing came in here and did take America over and now America's
[45:01.560 --> 45:08.000]  waking up to that and me tell you we are in a crisis so big so real I've told
[45:08.000 --> 45:11.600]  you over and over again I ran as a political diversion because during a
[45:11.600 --> 45:15.520]  war they can take liberties easier war is the health of the state they're gonna
[45:15.520 --> 45:22.120]  use that war the huge multi-region war that ran corporation called for three
[45:22.120 --> 45:27.840]  years ago to go after their primary target the the rich west we are the
[45:27.840 --> 45:33.720]  enemy our Magna Carta if you're in the Commonwealth's from Australia to England
[45:33.720 --> 45:42.680]  to Scotland to Northern Ireland if you have a history of Magna Carta if you
[45:42.680 --> 45:46.080]  have what grew out of that the flower of it Declaration of Independence
[45:46.080 --> 45:50.480]  Bill of Rights Constitution we're the enemy we're the last in line we're all
[45:50.480 --> 45:55.440]  that's left you understand that we are both the great engine of evil worldwide
[45:55.440 --> 46:00.080]  but we are also the savior it's the battles here the decision will be made
[46:00.080 --> 46:04.680]  here for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction so the great evil
[46:04.680 --> 46:08.960]  is here there's many other horrible evils but the great evils here because evil is
[46:08.960 --> 46:13.920]  attracted to power evil wants the levers of power so the great contest over
[46:13.920 --> 46:17.880]  the wheel that governs the direction of our ship is happening now and you've
[46:17.880 --> 46:22.640]  got to decide you've got to decide I'm not scared at all I'm ready for whatever
[46:22.640 --> 46:33.080]  comes in this I'm ready because I know that this is my destiny this is what I'm
[46:33.080 --> 46:38.120]  here for this wife is short and I want to live it to the fullest for humanity
[46:38.120 --> 46:44.680]  I want to be a good person I'm gonna follow my heart that wants justice I'm
[46:44.680 --> 46:52.360]  gonna recognize good from evil I've made my decision and there's no fear and the
[46:52.360 --> 46:56.240]  power of the world the power of this system the power of the devil the
[46:56.240 --> 47:01.680]  late no mistake that's what it is is broken it's broken when you give yourself
[47:01.680 --> 47:06.120]  over to good give yourself over to God whatever you are atheist agnostic
[47:06.120 --> 47:10.360]  whatever you are not gonna find it in some establishment church just ask God
[47:10.360 --> 47:14.360]  to show you in this great time of challenge that's coming and believe me
[47:14.360 --> 47:19.960]  you'll be shown you're on a planet in the middle of a universe and you don't
[47:19.960 --> 47:23.520]  think there's things you don't see or know you can't feel it because you've
[47:23.520 --> 47:29.160]  been spiritually blinded by the fake churches by the world by its facsimiles
[47:29.160 --> 47:35.800]  by all of it you have got to ask God to open your eyes you can God will not this
[47:35.800 --> 47:45.640]  God will not force himself on you you have got to ask that is a spiritual law
[47:45.640 --> 47:49.920]  like the parable of empire it has to ask permission to come in you got to let
[47:49.920 --> 47:55.920]  it in it's the same thing for good it is a decision it is a decision that you
[47:55.920 --> 48:03.320]  have to make and just commit and turn loose that's the secret just turn loose
[48:03.320 --> 48:10.440]  and by the way giving yourself over to God is not becoming a slave that's what
[48:10.440 --> 48:18.200]  happens when you serve the devil Satan it's it's more than that you you just
[48:18.200 --> 48:23.120]  surrender to the fact that's already there and then that's where the great
[48:23.120 --> 48:28.840]  peace comes from and great discernment and I know why people serve evil they
[48:28.840 --> 48:33.200]  seek power they they want to get back at people that have done them wrong they
[48:33.200 --> 48:41.000]  feel weak and I feel sorry for those that never really experienced true power
[48:41.000 --> 48:50.280]  true discernment if they only knew that they are only masters of evil and that
[48:50.280 --> 48:56.840]  is such a small part of the spectrum of creation and reality it is such a it is
[48:56.840 --> 49:06.120]  such a shadow of creation but because of the evil we can recognize the good
[49:06.640 --> 49:11.760]  because of that and I don't mean to get spiritual here it's just that's what
[49:11.760 --> 49:18.280]  that's what's in my heart and this is a spiritual choice make no mistake it is a
[49:18.280 --> 49:25.400]  spiritual war the globalist print the money they want your mind they want your
[49:25.400 --> 49:33.520]  fertility destroyed they want your power destroyed they want to drug you and
[49:33.520 --> 49:38.960]  psychologically stunt you because you are beautiful and powerful and shining
[49:38.960 --> 49:46.400]  and they hate it they want to deface God's creation they want to beguile you
[49:46.400 --> 49:52.960]  and stunt you because once you experience good versus evil there is no

[55:57.300 --> 56:00.880]  got this new power they say to kill us domestically no judge no jury or
[56:00.880 --> 56:06.240]  kidnappers here's the other one now now listen to this you heard yesterday how
[56:06.240 --> 56:09.920]  out in Hawaii now they make women pump breast milk in front of them just to
[56:09.920 --> 56:13.680]  make sure there's not bombs I'm not kidding and to prove it the breast pumps
[56:13.680 --> 56:18.240]  just all part of arbitrary harassment and humiliation and then say you can't
[56:18.240 --> 56:23.600]  go to a private place do it in front everybody and the TSA said we're sorry
[56:23.600 --> 56:26.120]  for the misunderstanding that's what that means they're gonna keep doing it
[56:26.120 --> 56:32.960]  we're sorry you didn't like it they're of their father all they do is lie US
[56:32.960 --> 56:37.240]  court approves wireless searches of cell phones US police can search a cell
[56:37.240 --> 56:42.440]  phone for its number without having a warrant according to a federal appeals
[56:42.440 --> 56:46.840]  court ruling yeah in Indiana Michigan all over the country they pull you over
[56:46.840 --> 56:49.960]  now for speeding or whatever or inspection sticker and they just say
[56:49.960 --> 56:53.480]  give me your phone and they plug it into a machine and suck everything off of it
[56:53.480 --> 56:57.840]  photos videos phone numbers and they say well it's like searching a notepad in
[56:57.840 --> 57:02.480]  your car it's just the general area I mean total there's nothing more private
[57:02.480 --> 57:10.200]  than your computer that's what it is I mean that's North Korea and they love
[57:10.200 --> 57:16.000]  it oh but it's about keeping you safe of course okay again you say you care
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.600]  about America well then you should be against all of this they're getting the
[57:18.600 --> 57:21.680]  country ready for war war three and martial law and financial collapse
[57:21.680 --> 57:26.880]  during that officers in Indiana found a number of cell phones the scene of a
[57:26.880 --> 57:30.760]  drug bust see it always is for drugs but but they're saying we'll do it in your
[57:30.760 --> 57:35.640]  car now and searched each phone for its telephone number did they search the
[57:35.640 --> 57:39.520]  ATF ship and cocaine in having the numbers allowed the government to subpoena
[57:39.520 --> 57:44.440]  the owners call histories linking them to a drug-selling scheme and again makes
[57:44.440 --> 57:47.320]  it sound reasonable but they're saying now for the highway check points
[57:47.320 --> 57:52.320]  incredible one of the suspects who was convicted and sentenced to tenures in
[57:52.320 --> 57:56.240]  prison argued on appeal that police had no right to search the phone's contents
[57:56.240 --> 58:00.080]  without a warrant the US court and see they used a case that they think sounds
[58:00.080 --> 58:05.400]  reasonable for everybody's phones now the US Court of Appeals second seventh
[58:05.400 --> 58:10.160]  circuit rejected the argument on Wednesday finding that the invasion of
[58:10.160 --> 58:14.520]  privacy was so slight oh it's so slight that the police actions did not violate
[58:14.520 --> 58:17.800]  the Fourth Amendment ban on under reasonable searches of your person
[58:17.800 --> 58:22.480]  houses papers and effects oh really my papers and effects you gotta have a
[58:22.480 --> 58:27.240]  warrant for my papers and effects oh but this is digital we it's digital now
[58:27.240 --> 58:33.160]  so it doesn't count it's it's written things okay cops you think the Bell

[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:06.360]  amount of food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing

[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:15.920]  as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:20.000]  what I was eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of

[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.200]  there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:14.680]  all right lieutenant colonel anthony shapers with us for the rest of the hour
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:19.640]  he's gonna be on MSNBC and RT today so he's done a lot of new research on the
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:24.120]  Iran situations continually changing very quickly he headed up operation
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.640]  stratus ivy and of course able danger he could have been able to kill been
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:32.840]  lauding on multiple occasions was blocked from doing so his book that came
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:36.480]  out last year what operation dark heart was a new york times bestseller but
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:41.080]  they they blocked it for a while and excised a bunch of it out basically his
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:44.000]  punishment because a lot of what was in there they even excised out had already
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.840]  been reported was just from eyewitness accounts so that was a way to punish him
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:52.040]  I've got him on about Iran about Syria about where all this is going but I
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.240]  wanted to first because he was on hold listening during the last short
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:59.680]  segment the fact that everywhere I go now there's just regular army marines
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:04.640]  National Guard searching people at zilker park and it's just a giant park
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:10.600]  just random military touching people hurting children around I've got
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:15.000]  articles here where they plan to use FEMA here here's the Washington Post from
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.120]  2003 many anti terror plans would stop parents for picking up children I sent
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:24.720]  my reporters to Denver last year during a giant urban warfare terrorism drill a
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:29.040]  tabletop exercise and sure enough they're practicing taking kids to the
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:35.560]  sports stadiums of super creepy total acclimation for military operations and
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:41.680]  now they've gotten rid of possecom and taught us basically with this NDAA Bruce
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:44.440]  fine constitutional scholar congressional advisor has said it is
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:49.480]  treason countless Bob Barr former congressman former CIA he says it's
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:52.880]  totally illegal but we don't even need them to tell us that this is blatant
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.400]  what you see in third-world countries and thank God our military has a long
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.880]  history of following the Bill of Rights the Constitution we're not Venezuela or
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:05.680]  Nigeria but they're trying their hardest instead they're doing what Hitler did
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.160]  the out of control bureaucracies are they're creating a brown shirt Stalin
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:15.880]  opened the prisons up and hired low-wage kind of just thugs to be his
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:19.720]  front-line goons because the history of the Russian military who wasn't perfect
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:24.840]  they still wouldn't do the type of purges that linen and then Stalin wanted so
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:29.480]  that's what they're doing now that's my view on this the TSA is now in Dallas
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:32.680]  sticking their hands on people's pants at the train stations and bus stations
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:36.920]  they're now in San Antonio they now have military police in San Antonio at the
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:40.840]  Riverwalk where I used to go a few times a year I was there I can't stand it
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:46.200]  looking at you talking to you with sidearms on I want to talk to Colonel
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.840]  Schaefer about this right now before we get into the huge issues with Iran and
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.680]  the rest of it but clearly they're gearing up for a big war and then
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:59.440]  counter strikes by Iran and instead of instead of them actually going after
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:02.600]  any assets you guaranteed it's going to be used against the American people as
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.720]  the Homeland Security documents that I received from law enforcement three years
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:09.200]  ago that made national news show they say the number one threats returning
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:13.120]  veterans gun owners libertarians conservatives so that's my briefing to
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:16.000]  everybody and I know that's a large statement Colonel Schaefer but I wanted
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.160]  to state you know that wider spectrum of data points to where you'd have to be
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:26.040]  blind out there if there's new listeners to not know this is crossing the
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:30.640]  Rubicon this is third world this is North Korea this is scary what do you say
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:34.880]  to all that regarding the plastic a metallic issue I you know I'm one of
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:38.880]  the folks I actually was in hearings in front of the house to the Senate
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.920]  District Committee back in 2005 on this very issue and frankly one of the things
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.920]  that held us back from doing everything we could have was posicum a totus and I
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:51.060]  argue there's there's justification for working within the framework of
[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:54.920]  posicum a totus but in the case of the new NDA which was signed by the president
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:59.480]  you know by December there's no justification and essentially just
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:04.080]  you don't understand what happened the the president has declared that
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:09.800]  anywhere in the world is now a battlefield better say that the war
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.240]  you're sitting this minute where I'm sitting this minute is technically a
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:17.120]  battle space and therefore he has ultimate absolute authority to do
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:22.760]  whatever the hell he wants whatever he wants to to to deem anyone a threat and
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:26.040]  by the way there's no oversight for how you you go through a process of
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:32.080]  establishing someone's potential as a threat and so Bruce Spine is a very
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:35.840]  close friend of mine a constitutional scholar who has said that very clearly
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:42.680]  that there is no legal basis for the NDA to expand those level of authorities to
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:48.120]  the president now there's been two clear abuses of this so far and frankly it
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:52.480]  proceeded that the NDA one is the assassination of Amar al-Alaqi and his son
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:57.040]  they are US citizens I don't care how you feel about them I really don't but
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.320]  the the premise was well you know they're bad people so we should kill them
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:04.760]  wrong answer they were bad people and they clearly violated the US law and
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:08.360]  bring them to justice justice games giving them to process special well you
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:11.560]  think you'd want to get a hold of them to get this so-called intelligence but
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:15.560]  expanding on that there you go that sets the precedent to kill anybody and that's
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.360]  my thing as intelligence officer is I'm glad you brought it up I always say you
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:23.280]  know I am for the idea of life capture because dead men literally don't tell
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:27.080]  any tales so you've got to consider the intelligence value and why they're doing
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:34.040]  that I believe in the case of Amar al-Alaqi before 9-11 Alex frankly you
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.560]  know that that's one of the things that no one wanted to come out but this guy
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:41.240]  had been a double triple agent and they were actually working with them with the
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.880]  FBI I'm sorry to interrupt but your phone cut out during that key point go
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:47.360]  back a minute ago back to the beginning of a lock you start over
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:53.720]  I'm lucky was actually an asset of the FBI before 9-11 so frankly Alex one of
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.440]  the things this administration was doing on behalf of all the administrations
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:02.440]  was covering their tracks I don't want a lot he had a documented relationship with
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.760]  the US government and the Federal Bureau of Investigation proceeding this is
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:11.360]  before it is before 9-11 so what they were doing Alex was going back covering
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:15.920]  their tracks but beyond that now beyond that they have established my second
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:21.920]  point a star chamber if you will where you now have at least four to five U.S.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:26.560]  citizens that is to say people of our status your status my status any status
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:31.520]  of the US citizen on the kill capture list and no one knows how they got
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:35.600]  there why they got there what do you do to get yourself off the list and oh by
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:41.000]  the way what justifies the unilateral use of deadly force when no one can
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.440]  actually define what what they did it was so threatening to the foundation of
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:47.920]  the Constitution that allows them to be assassinated on site so this is where
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:52.320]  we're going with this and and I hope your audience understands this is not this
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:59.600]  is not theoretical this is not basically someone trying to drum up an area
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.920]  which you know that that is fictional this is true this is in the NDA the
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:07.600]  language can be read by anybody and the presidential signing statement which he
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.040]  implemented this and basically he says well yeah I got this authority but I'm
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:15.000]  not going to abuse it and if you believe that then you believe all the other
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.840]  things the president has said over the past three years which it never comes
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:23.120]  through so I have a real problem with it and your listeners should too well just
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:26.480]  going back to the issue that you raised before I'm gonna flesh this out I mean
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:31.040]  this is illegal Congress is supposed to authorize these military operations and
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:35.920]  with the Libya situation and now with Syria and everything else Congress is
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.960]  like sure we'll give you the authority and Obama says I don't need that and
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:43.040]  puts out a policy statement that he gets his authority from the UN I mean it's
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.800]  bad enough for the president to say I can do this on my own that's obviously
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:52.080]  unconstitutional but to say I get my authorization from a foreign power made
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:57.360]  up of foreign governments that that right there is treason and that's what
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:00.600]  Mr. Finest said that's what many other scholars have pointed out I know you're
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:04.520]  still part of your military and government think tanks and things so
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:10.560]  it's hard for you to you know talk about that but what else is your statement
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:14.960]  is absolutely correct I mean the president's obligation is to support
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.800]  defend the Constitution there's not a word in there about the United
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:21.320]  Nation or any of the foreign countries within our Constitution so clearly and
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:24.680]  again I this is why you and I've discussed this before I the the whole
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:30.840]  Libya operation was illegal no funds were ever approved for the president to
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:35.400]  use them in operation nor no one was there any US military authority to drop
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:39.640]  one bomb by the definition of the president's belief in Libya we could
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:43.040]  technically use it a tactical naked a weapon on someone and never have to go
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:47.080]  to Congress permission by extending the logic the president used to testify the
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:51.400]  quote-unquote air campaign only so again I grew I grew with Bruce Bruce has been
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:55.200]  on and and this is illegal and this is not illegal in a small way this is
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:00.840]  illegal in a very big way and until the Congress grows a set of cojones to do
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:04.480]  something about it you're going to continue to see this this unfettered
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:08.760]  expansion of presidential authority which I would argue no matter who it is in
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:13.200]  the office Democrat Republican doesn't matter it's illegal
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:19.400]  Wow speaking of the the end of posse comment taught us all the things that
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:25.720]  are happening it seems like with Obama and Congress is going along with it to
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:29.520]  great extent they're just going for broke to try to set precedence to be able
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:35.480]  to get away with anything why are they so confident why are they so brazen when
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:39.160]  Congress has like a 9 to 10 to 11% approval rating depending on which
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:43.920]  poll well I don't know this is one of those things that I think I scratch my
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:47.720]  hell you know I'm on the hill quite a bit dealing with staff and members and I
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.480]  scratch myself all the time looking at the fact that Congress has been
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.200]  literally asleep at this which of doing its job which is oversight that they
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:58.040]  clearly have the responsibility to purse anything they they don't that they
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.080]  decide is not in the best interest of the constitutional people they can be
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:04.760]  fun and so this is one of those things that I don't understand why they don't
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:09.280]  take a very strong position on things which are obviously illegal and they
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:13.000]  even if they can't do anything about it legally at the moment they can be funded
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.040]  so you know it makes it more difficult at least and the second thing and you
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.840]  probably know this Alex some of the folks I work with have actually stood
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:22.080]  in front of snow for Libya so you know you know we have things that I think the
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.000]  president's counting on is it even if they catch him doing something illegal he
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.640]  knows he's counting on the court system being very glacial and trying to trying
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:33.560]  to track him down and force him to follow the Constitution so I think right
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.840]  now it's just a brazen attempt to continue to expand the you know well
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:40.280]  beyond the George Bush issues I think it's a continued attempt to expand the
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:44.160]  authorities and and ability the executive branch to do things without any
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:46.960]  oversight well those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it and I
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:51.720]  know you teach at war colleges and also to you teach officers but you know but
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:55.840]  maybe some of the audience who's new doesn't win when presidents or or the
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:00.280]  head of the Roman Senate anytime in history start declaring they have all
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:04.640]  the power every time this happens look out and I haven't seen anything like
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:10.040]  this since Lincoln and that was a domestic issue then this is Lincoln
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:14.080]  wasn't siding with foreign powers he just said I have this power and the
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:17.200]  courts have judged and Congress has judged it was illegal you know regardless
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:21.000]  of which side of that fight you know but people are on it was illegal according
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.240]  to Constitution but Lincoln wasn't doing it for some foreign you in I mean when

[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:20.820]  Syria all of it the situation with Russia Pakistan it's all just crazy with
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:26.800]  Colonel Tony Schaefer best-selling book operation Darkheart a really interesting
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:30.000]  fellow some amount of just came on about some of the wild things he can talk
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  about in all the different operations he's been in but right now we were
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.880]  finishing up if you just joined us talking about Obama says he can launch
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:40.480]  these wars because the UN says so but they're not wars even though they kill
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:45.360]  35,000 40,000 people and it's just it's reaching new orwellian
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:48.320]  proportions we know they're funding opposition with a lot of al-Qaeda
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:52.760]  connections in Syria they're using al-Qaeda groups against Iran all of this
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:25:00.200]  is just getting wilder and wilder your points on that Colonel well I think you
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:03.440]  know clearly that the Middle East is a bad place so a lot of bad people live
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:07.240]  there and I think I may be very redirect about this I think we've had a
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:11.480]  White House who has been naive to think that that being nice to everybody's
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:14.840]  going to be the ultimate solution of bringing things forward with that said
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:17.760]  at the same time I don't believe having the hammer I mean someone who has a
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:21.160]  hammer everything tends to look like a male so you know what we've got to do is
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:26.200]  actually understand what is in our US best interest as you pointed out I think a
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:29.320]  large part of our government's been focused really here at home on not
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:32.920]  existing threats which really you know should make everybody really worried by
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:36.360]  the fact that they're they're trying to establish so much authority due to
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:40.640]  domestic operations as we know there's been very few instances of domestic
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:44.440]  terrorism but most of those have been prominently happened which were
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:49.080]  actually of terrorist trade overseas by Zal Shazad Abu Bakrullah the
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:56.520]  underwear bomber you know major the guide of the board heard by Major Hassan
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:01.960]  all being handled by the double agent Alaki and yeah so exactly so it's a
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:04.160]  clearly overseas and it's one of the things the administration continues to
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.520]  pretend otherwise this also goes to the heart of the the Iranian
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:14.880]  policy right now you know right now the the president's speech Sunday to APEC
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:19.600]  really to me was a political speech if he really if he doesn't want to really
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:22.960]  believe everything he said everything he says should have been something at the
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:27.200]  forefront of his policies three years ago they weren't so now we're left with
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.840]  a situation where I think there's a number of folks who want to go to war
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:34.760]  there's no doubt there's a divide within both the conservative and liberal
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:38.720]  movements about what to do about Iran problem is this Alex there's a larger
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:41.840]  picture we're not paying attention to which is the fact that we're about to
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:47.120]  see the beginning of a Sunni Shia Cold War and so we're not even worried about
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:51.680]  the fact that there's larger powers the Pakistanis who have nuclear weapons the
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.480]  Saudis who have always wanted to have extra your weapons and now you've got
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:59.080]  the Persians and from the Iranians actually developing theirs and all of
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.480]  this is going to play out in a very bad way unless we figure out who we need to
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:07.520]  deal with you know and both long term and short term and we're linking this
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.360]  directly to Syria we don't know enough about the situation actually side with
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:15.000]  someone and yet we're involving ourselves much like we did in Libya we
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.560]  chose to involve ourselves with without fully understanding what that
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:22.600]  involvement would be and I would argue that the tribal situation in Libya that
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:26.080]  exists today with the foothold the toehold of al-Qaeda doing things on the
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:29.840]  ground there was not what we intended and frankly it was predicted though and
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:32.440]  again we're dealing with an administration no you predicted it all
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:36.840]  here on air do we know what happened with the 10,000 missiles and 8,000 of them
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:41.520]  being hijacked well we know some of them in Algeria they were intercepted going
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.440]  across the border so we can only imagine what happened to the ones we didn't
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:47.360]  see it's gonna be like a drug problem you know it's not the ones you capture
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:50.080]  that you have to worry about it the ones that you know are out there that you
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.720]  have no idea where they're at so I think we're gonna see long-term
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:56.520]  ramifications far you know far after this year and then when jet airliners
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:00.880]  get blown up taken off from the airport I'm gonna lose my liberties because they
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:04.280]  put al-Qaeda and Libyan gave them all these missiles I mean it's it what you
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:08.280]  see is an excuse to power grab right exactly that's what we're seeing across
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:12.760]  support so what that said that we've got to look at the fact that the the the
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:16.160]  Iranians have been dealing with the North Koreans and one of the things I
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:18.760]  think we talked about a little bit before is look the Iranians are just
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:22.640]  playing the same playbook as they did with the North Korean you know North
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:26.880]  Koreans did it exactly what the Iranians are doing now but the North
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:29.840]  Koreans did it back in the 90s I actually worked operations in Washington
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:35.480]  slow motion as the the then Clinton administration basically gave in gave
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:39.920]  food to the the the North Koreans did all these concessions never received a
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:43.440]  thing back we're in the same situation now with the Iranians were basically
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:46.960]  there's a game of brink of shit going on and we continue to kind of get things
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:49.680]  away with them no expectation of actually achieving victory which I would
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:53.240]  argue to kind of goes to your point Alex the administration really doesn't
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:57.280]  necessarily want to achieve any progress by the fact they will consider it to amass
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:01.000]  you know power to do whatever the heck they want and I don't again I don't
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.800]  think they're defining clearly what the threats are we need to be looking at and
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:08.160]  taking action against well when I see something in the western media I don't
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:10.960]  just believe it but I went and looked it up as you know a couple months ago I'm
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:15.200]  sure you saw it where the head of their parliamentary section on on
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:19.120]  intelligence said we're gonna attack Tel Aviv of New York if you attack us
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:23.120]  that's a pretty reckless statement by Iran I want to ask you about that when
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:27.320]  you get back because they've they've been I mean as you know pretty much just just in
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:31.120]  proxy wars in the region why would they say that or was that guy speaking out of
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:35.360]  turn what does it mean that Ahmed Denizide is now a losing political
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:41.480]  power in the parliament and maybe out soon I want to discuss where you see
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:46.000]  this going what the inside baseball is there at the Pentagon with Lieutenant

[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:06.000]  began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.160]  that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:13.720]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:18.000]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.600]  of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:27.000]  themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best

[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:17.320]  no more mr. nice guy okay looking at this we know there's been a covert war
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:21.120]  against Iran with proxy grips for at least five years because Bush put a
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:25.920]  policy statement on it it's intensified in the last year they've been
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:30.680]  arresting US citizens and others and putting them on trial to be executed
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:36.960]  do they think are spies Iran's got its proxy groups Hezbollah you know attacking
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:43.000]  Israel most of the Israeli advisors for those that weren't aware of this the
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.560]  former head of Mossad and others are saying do not attack Iran that'll dig
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:50.960]  them in with the population that they're unpopular with now they're Iran's gonna
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:57.680]  attack Israel on all sides what is the inside baseball Colonel on a a hot war
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:02.040]  with Iran it looks like a lot of forces are building up in the region what are
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:07.520]  you hearing right now on this front and how does Syria tie in how does Russia
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:13.080]  getting more hard line how does Pakistan how does China because it looks like the
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:17.280]  battle lines are being drawn the Chinese and Russians have been strong
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:22.160]  advocates of both Syria and Iran for a while and and let's be brutally honest
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:25.960]  here a lot of the technology we're worried about has come from the Chinese
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:31.000]  and Russians and some from North Koreans so the fact that this cooperation we
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.880]  know the question becomes what will come of that cooperation and let's go to the
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:40.200]  the the whole idea of the Iranian government and the upcoming elections
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:44.560]  and let me be very clear on this the the Iranians as you know are you know I
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:48.520]  don't people understand that they're not monolithic they don't have a single
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:52.840]  group who actually knows what they want to do you have people who are as
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:56.120]  rational as you and I who are at the top of the government at the same time you
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:35:00.640]  have these radicals who believe in the the the the total imam and the whole idea
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:05.160]  that that by creating chaos they will have this religious figure reappears so
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:08.560]  some of those folks are that radically committed to a radical course of action
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:13.800]  but as you know my Dina John is coming up for election those those elements
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:17.520]  within the government those conservative mullahs don't like him and so I think
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:20.320]  you're going to see a lot of things hang out so what we need to do Alex
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:24.600]  frankly to kind of cut to the chases do everything we can to create chaos within
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:29.280]  their own ranks anything we can do to actually encourage democracy encourage
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:33.960]  those groups who are who are former form who want democracy we should do
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:37.200]  everything we can to encourage them and create their own level of chaos within
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:40.080]  the government and let's remember their Persians are not Arabs and they have a
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:44.760]  very proud culture who are very proud of what they accomplished over you know the
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:48.520]  past two two thousand years so we've got to look at that and use it to our
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:52.680]  advantage with that said they have developed a new class of nuclear weapons
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:56.200]  there's articles out today indicating that the North Koreans have probably been
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:01.360]  paid to actually conduct deep underground nuclear research and weapon
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:06.360]  and weapon attempt to basically using nuclear weapon actual warheads
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:10.800]  exposing it's exploding underground so I think the Iranians are further ahead
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:14.720]  than what general clapper the director of national intelligence cares to admit
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.920]  let me ask you this question because I've got family and and other sources
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:23.880]  years ago like two years ago saying Iran has has primitive nuclear weapons but
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:28.720]  not delivery systems but then is that internal Pentagon propaganda and I know
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:32.640]  you have a high-security clearance I agree no no I I do I'm one of the
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:36.320]  comments that says that they have they have at least two weapons they have no
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:40.400]  way to deliver and and the basis for this and you again I would encourage
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:43.520]  your audience to go through their own due diligence look at what the French and
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:46.320]  Germans are reporting there's been some reports are recently by some foreign
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:50.240]  countries other than ours who are saying look there's clear evidence that the
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:55.040]  North Koreans have been cooperating with the Iranians on development of the
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:59.280]  systems the question becomes obviously is putting it on the warhead the last
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:04.480]  overt North Korean blast which occurred a couple years ago was a very small
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:08.280]  magnitude thereby saying I was a fizzle now what they were going for is
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.840]  miniaturization Alex what they're trying to do both sides the North Koreans
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:15.800]  and Iranians I try to miniaturize thing put these things on delivery system so
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:19.040]  I agree with you that I think they're they're working right now to put these
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.800]  things on deliverable deliver delivery systems which allow them to throw these
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:26.640]  nuclear weapons outside of their border right now they cannot deliver them
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:31.160]  using modern technology but but again simply having it does not intent mean
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:34.080]  that the intent to use it is there and that's where I think the question well
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:39.000]  let me go to this place then what about Pakistan because I see that as a greater
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.400]  threat to everybody that they're very unstable and have over a hundred nukes
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:47.520]  and medium range delivery systems as you know that's on record they're they're
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:52.080]  very technologically advanced and everything I see the Pentagon doing is
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:56.120]  is further destabilizing and I can see you saying well destabilize Iran so they
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:01.240]  can get you know more moderates in power and and but then what about Pakistan I
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:04.400]  mean aren't these policies actually pushing Pakistan to the arms of China
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:08.480]  well I think that we have missed under so you put present push we've
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:13.160]  underestimated the Pakistanis the Pakistanis for this entire war Alex
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:17.120]  have been on one side the Pakistani side and yet we pretend it otherwise so by
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:20.680]  the things we've done I think it has had the unintentional I don't believe we
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:24.720]  intentionally sought out to destabilize the Pakistanis for the very reason you
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:27.160]  mentioned we know they have nuclear weapons we know they have nuclear
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:30.440]  developed delivery systems but I think the unattended consequence of us
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:34.200]  forcing them to do things against their best interest which is essentially to
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:38.000]  say you know we force them to take and do something against the Taliban the
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.320]  time on their own creation Alex they were basically we're trying to get them
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:45.600]  to do things which they they they don't want to do and by doing that we've
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:49.760]  created this this other element of the Taliban within Pakistan who is now
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:54.240]  working to destabilize so we've helped create the chaos within their system by
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:57.000]  asking to do things against their own interests that is a Pakistani interest
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.720]  and plus we have the Indians so we've allowed the Indians to do a great number
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:04.720]  of things in Afghanistan by doing that we've been further destabilized
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:08.320]  situation this is a situation where we should have asked Indians to just set it
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:11.720]  up we don't need you there because your presence there will help you stabilize
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:14.240]  things well no kidding that's the ancestral enemy they've had all these
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:19.120]  wars with it's crazy I mean I mean come on the Pentagon the CIA they've got to
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:23.040]  know that bringing the Indians in was going to turn the Pakistanis against
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:27.440]  them and that's why you've seen the Hikari network be so effective in
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:31.360]  retaining its ability to launch operations within Kabul and other elements
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:34.400]  other parts of Afghanistan and the Pakistanis are never going to cover it
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:38.760]  give it up so again Alex we've helped create and ferment the destabilization
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:42.560]  path of Pakistan by our own hand-handed way we've handled it and this is one of
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:46.680]  those things the Pentagon and General McChrystal even said this recently in
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:50.880]  London that we we barely have a surface understanding of the cultures with which
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:54.240]  we're dealing and so what you have policy makers with authority with no
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:57.640]  knowledge of the culture what you see you're seeing the inevitable result of
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:02.160]  this ham-handed half-baked policy of dealing with the Pakistan is such a way
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:10.440]  that we destabilize situation no kidding what is the inside baseball on an Iran
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:14.920]  attack because it looks like Obama's playing this whole peacenik angle
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:18.680]  publicly that he doesn't want war but now after many when Netanyahu he says we
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:23.200]  will take action but from everything I've seen it is a strategy of tension
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:29.720]  balkanization order out of chaos at many levels I don't think it's hand-fisted
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:34.480]  sure mid-level some of the bureaucrats I mean this this larger strategy looks
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:39.400]  like it's an attempt to bring the world into turmoil so that there can be
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:43.920]  distractions from the bank looting and the rest of it but what are you hearing
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:50.400]  on an Iran attack well I there's split I mean clearly let's just look at the facts
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:54.720]  and one of the key facts Alex is that it would take over 300 sorting that is
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:00.840]  300 air missions to just hit the known nuclear facility the known because and
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:06.200]  obviously we know that the Iranians have secret nuclear programs so you've
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:09.640]  got to look at that realistically so we have folks clearly who think we could we
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.200]  could do it we have the military capacity we obviously I don't think the
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:16.920]  Iranians I mean the Israelis could do it without us for any number of reasons and
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.400]  I think that's the big debate right now do we go in with them or not do you
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:23.680]  Israelis want to attack there's no doubt they do the question becomes can they
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:27.320]  and will they ultimately the other thing we have to look at here is that the
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:31.600]  Jericho 3 there they're the Israel the Israelis delivery system is nuclear
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:35.320]  capable Israelis do have nuclear weapons and of course came to shove
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:38.680]  obviously they do have the ability to launch nuclear weapons obviously that
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:43.360]  would be something it would you know put the whole region in turmoil but we
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:46.560]  don't want that no one wants that so the question becomes what is the the middle
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:50.440]  course which would help stabilize things and back everybody off and that I
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:55.480]  think has to be one where we look at other data I'm not a proponent of the
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:59.440]  negotiation I think it's a day late the dollar short same time I don't think we
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:03.800]  can afford to do a full-on military attack only so there's some middle ground
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:07.400]  and then that middle ground would be you know the dark arts we've got to look at
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:11.760]  how we can actually do things without the actually attacking one general I've
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:15.320]  talked to several times Alex about this former sent central command commander
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:19.160]  has said the moment a ship gets scratched going through the streets of
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:23.320]  her move by miscalculation we're talking about six to seven dollars a gallon
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:27.040]  oil and I think that's realistic so we do you know I don't think the Obama
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.000]  administration really wants that level of of expense to interfere with well just
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.200]  the saber rattling Scott gas prices exploding and at the five dollars or
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:38.800]  more so again absolutely so again I don't think it's in the administration's
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:42.560]  best interest to see that because that will definitely hurt is a re-election
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:45.600]  campaign potential so I think it's nothing else I'm gonna try to keep a
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:48.880]  lid on it until after the election so I see the administration trying to keep
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:53.320]  this padded down until we're past November because obviously that their big
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:57.040]  objective right now is to keep all prices not going too high even ultimately
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:00.400]  want them high but low enough that they get through the election and get
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:04.240]  reelected I think obviously okay so after the election instead of an October
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:07.480]  surprise because if they did it close enough to that even if gas prices went
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:13.080]  up people tend to line up and you know rally around a president period when
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:17.440]  we're in a big war let me expand on this how do you expect and what are your
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:21.600]  colleagues saying what's the consensus of there is one on the Russians Putin's
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:26.160]  been re-elected if you believe that their stocks have gone up that means the
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:31.360]  hardliners are in you've got the Chinese president saying prepare for war with the
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:36.080]  US you've got the Pentagon acting like the Middle East isn't even an issue and
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:42.480]  sending all these fleets and troops to the Pacific why is there this realignment
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:47.880]  against Russia and China right now well first problem we have just like to find
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.960]  up your audience understand we have no grand strategy we have no idea what
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:54.560]  we're doing globally we don't and and one of the things that even during the
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:58.360]  Cold War Alex we kind of had a strategy of how we're gonna do things we don't
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:01.440]  have that don't want to sit down and figure it out how we're going to do things
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:05.120]  all they know is going to cut the budget with that said then you we've left the
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:08.720]  door open for chaos you have General Clapper saying one time one thing in
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:12.200]  testimony about the Muslim Brotherhood not being a threat being you know being
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:16.240]  one thing another at the same time you've got the military expansion in the
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:20.480]  Pacific so again I think it's almost like there's nobody really thinking
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:24.000]  things through what is the second we're playing checkers not chess so what we
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.040]  need to do now as a country is really force the administration whoever's in
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:30.880]  power try to figure out what are we actually trying to do with our our
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:34.400]  multi-billion dollar military well that's my next question that's what I see
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:37.520]  is you've got all these special interests who all want different things
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:42.600]  right and so it's like America's become this robot that's getting all these
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:46.480]  different orders and smokes coming out of its ears and so even though we've had
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:50.760]  a corrupt elite and problems in this country before now I'm really starting
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:53.840]  to agree with you and I didn't think this is a few years ago I don't think the
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:57.680]  elites can get their act together as bad as they are it's crazy they've got all
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:02.040]  these weapons all these systems they've got level four bio weapons development
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:07.160]  they're putting in level two facilities I mean it's it's they're crazy it they
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:11.320]  don't know what they're doing Congress is insider trading mistresses partying
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:15.040]  we've had corrupt elites but at least they were professional in the past I
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:20.200]  think we are getting a bunch of a bunch of moron power tripping hubris filled
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:27.640]  playboys and that spells disaster that spells war that's because man I just
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:31.080]  have a bad feeling I mean I integrate all the info together and my gut tells
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:36.360]  me this we are cruising towards calamity I agree and I think that's a
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:39.880]  problem here Alex we gotta get our act together because you have like you said
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:43.200]  you have huge economic interest in the Pentagon one of the reasons we're bogged
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:47.360]  down and in Afghanistan because we know the issue is package that we know that
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:49.840]  one of the reasons we're bogged down is because you have something called my
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:54.240]  friend that you probably know I'm Jerry Doyle calls it combat to commerce you
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:59.400]  know people it was with huge investments in defense spending and that's one of
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:01.720]  the reasons the super committee fail let's look back at the super committee
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:05.280]  pat to me from Pennsylvania and Patty Murray from from Washington State both
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:09.360]  have Boeing in their districts do you really believe that congressmen congressmen
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:14.520]  women are going to cut the budgets that would hurt their own constituents there's
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:18.240]  no way so we've allowed the system to create itself in such a way that people
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:22.120]  cover their their constituents by ensuring this huge spending goes on
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:25.720]  without a real a real focus or purpose within the context of the spending and
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:31.560]  we've got to get a handle on Wow what does your gut tell you right now I mean
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:37.360]  not making predictions but right now the current course we're on 60 40 60 for an
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:42.760]  Iran attack in the next year or is it or is it 60% not a war 40% I mean what's
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:47.800]  your gut I do believe basically I'm hearing and what I believe there's a
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:51.120]  better than even chance that there will be an attack before the fall I think
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:54.400]  would be towards the fall and it'll be one of those things that I think there'll
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:59.160]  be clear indications it's coming despite the Israelis will try to hide it I
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:02.640]  think that this has patted down probably through the summer and something
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:05.800]  will happen this fall like you point out either everybody will rally around the
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:09.680]  president because we have to fall in with the Israelis or the gas prices will
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:12.040]  drive them out of office to go either way and I think that's one of the
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:15.000]  calculations the White House will continue to try to you know ascertain
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.800]  within within Poland again I believe President speech yesterday on at the
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:22.960]  impact was purely political had nothing to do with the the the the national
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:25.920]  security realities if he really was focused on diplomacy Alex he should have
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:30.120]  done that three years ago and instead now we're behind the power curve and I
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:33.880]  think it's all about political equations designed to get him through and get him
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:38.120]  elected in November one way or another so what do you think about it admitted
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:42.840]  George Soros type State Department programs that he stabilized and mess
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:46.760]  around inside Russia I mean I don't think they're going to be successful doing
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:51.520]  that I think they're going to completely get Russia to unify its elite in an
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:55.560]  anti-western stance that'll probably cause more trouble down the road I
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:58.920]  agree with you I mean the Russians have their own interests the Russians there's
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:02.000]  no saying back in the Cold War what you know what the Russians used to say what
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.800]  what's ours as long as a watchers negotiable and so you know they are
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:08.800]  now reasserting themselves as a global power we have to understand that the more
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:11.920]  we mess around with them I think the more we have the potential of doing bad
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:15.560]  things frankly you know maybe we got to look at playing the Russia card as we did
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:19.320]  during you know as Nixon did with China during the during the Cold War exactly
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:22.360]  and I think we need to look at how you know the Russians and I have a lot of
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:25.240]  common interests if you really don't look at it so I think we're gonna be
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:28.880]  looking at how we can align interests together to do things to be a you know
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:32.400]  maybe in a global ally rather than you imagine if the US started becoming a
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.800]  partner and trading with Russia it would be it would be great for both economies
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:39.920]  but again special interests don't want that that's what Ron Paul people say well
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:43.960]  Ron Paul he wants to be with the Muslim extremists no he understands this
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:51.200]  empire is on its last legs right what's your take on Ron Paul you know I can
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:54.440]  tell you Alex I said this publicly I think his his policy is the most
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:59.120]  realistic on Iran the more we pick them the more we poke them the more the
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:02.840]  people will be apt to unify around the current government we don't really
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:06.960]  don't want that so I think we need to be very careful to say look we we are
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:11.040]  against your government developing and having nuclear weapons which could be
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:14.800]  used for purposes of creating war at the same time we're not against the the
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:20.160]  Iranian people it's a tough a tough thing to do but we got to do that and I
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:24.920]  think Ron Paul is right and that we need to look at how we can reach out and
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:30.360]  negotiate and be involved in trade with powers and at the same time limit our
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:34.120]  our focus of using force I think we're too we're too apt to use force like they
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:38.560]  didn't live you and and take a step back and figure out how what is really in
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:42.680]  our interest to do so I'm hoping that the other candidates will start listening
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:47.800]  to Paul and some of his common sense at the same time I think he wants to pull
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:51.880]  back too much I think we need to maintain order we are the big dog and the
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:55.840]  blocks for to speak I think this is our responsibility to maintain lines of
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:59.080]  communication lines of commerce because it isn't the best interest of the world
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:02.360]  to keep that life blood flowing and if then if we don't do it we're allowed to
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:07.480]  fall to someone else I don't think they will be all as kind as we are so well
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:12.280]  I just think the special interest running this country have proven that they just
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:16.080]  run off to their armored you know Swiss redoubts after they suck countries dry
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:20.160]  and what do they think they're gonna do after they've imploded the US I mean
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:23.040]  they're going to bring the whole world into chaos and it's time for the elite
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:27.280]  to realize how much danger they've put everybody including themselves colonel
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:30.920]  Schaefer a best-selling author of Operation Darkheart of course

[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:04.840]  Obama there's literally hundreds of major polls now in the last year that
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:09.160]  show him beating Obama better than any other candidate but does the GOP
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:12.440]  leadership want that no they want to go around blocking Ron Paul everywhere
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:15.760]  because he's the only person that's a real candidate on the Republican ticket
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:21.040]  who is not completely insane like they are also Paul Watson's got a report
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:26.600]  coming out anytime in fact let me hit refresh on info wars calm and see what's
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:31.760]  going on there no it's not up yet he's gonna have a report very very soon on
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:36.120]  all over the United States they have military at public events including
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:43.280]  Austin directing everybody just total acclimation for martial law some of the
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:48.440]  other articles at info wars calm HR 347 another step in the elimination of the
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:53.640]  First Amendment NATO invasion of Syria set for this month Paul Joseph Watson
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:57.760]  big article but it's not an invasion it's a peace mission like Libya that's all
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:00.880]  part of the Orwellian nature and if you question that admitted lie that no that's
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:04.960]  a war it's not peace they're like shut up conspiracy theorist questioning
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:13.400]  anything we say is evil Obama's second term odds spur rush of gun buying record
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:16.960]  gun sales and people say we don't trust the president we think he's a criminal
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:20.560]  in major studies and they said if they're worried about collapse again
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:23.720]  globalist we've been there warning people you're not gonna get the jump on
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:28.080]  us don't try to start a civil war the police and military are going to join
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:32.160]  us I can guarantee you the military is 70 plus percent give their money to Ron
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:37.560]  Paul the military they give money well then that's got the system worried you
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:40.280]  may be able to steal the election from Ron Paul and I told folks that was going
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:45.480]  to happen you still got to support him as he gets the word out but he is the real
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:51.280]  nominee continuing Afghanistan failed war from a false Empire holder to
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:55.160]  justify killing Americans on foreign soil and we have that other big report
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:58.600]  here US court approves warrantless searches of your cell phones when the
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:05.200]  cops pull you over so that's some of the crazy news on that front I may have to
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:10.200]  suspend this because I don't have the money to hire more shipping people we
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:20.240]  got like 600 orders over the weekend for the 100 info wars business cards to

[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:06.680]  trying to use al Qaeda and others lcaa to do this and serial Syrian girl joins
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:11.640]  us to go over this this is a short segment as you know but don't tell us a
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:15.640]  little bit about yourself and when and what you believe you know having a
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:21.440]  family in Syria what the real score is what's really happening there because
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:25.800]  obviously it's another proxy war just like Libya but what's your view on the
[02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:31.960]  whole situation as a Syrian well that's exactly right it's a proxy war being
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:39.080]  waged by NATO the Arab countries spearheaded by Qatar which has the biggest
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:46.080]  US military base in the region right there and they control al Jazeera I'm
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:51.080]  not sure if you're familiar with that satellite news channel but it was in the
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:02:01.960]  media a lot during Iraq war and it was proposed as a anti US media station and
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:08.920]  it was you know so much who ha about how evil al Jazeera is but in actual fact
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:15.800]  it was controlled by the US all along you know they're their allies and this
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:23.960]  al Jazeera is currently the driving force the media driving force behind all
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:31.960]  of these foreign fueled insurgencies that is being referred to as the Arab
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:38.240]  Spring well I have to concur with that I mean it's so clear whenever I'm
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:41.280]  watching singing in with Anderson Cooper the same guy that cheered the
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:45.440]  overthrow of their old puppet in Egypt and then you know cheered the
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:50.240]  humanitarian bombing and tens of thousands killed against Libya to see
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:55.280]  him cutting to this you know particular young man reporter who's there who one
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:59.720]  day is speaking in a yes I am in Syria and then the next day is a British
[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:04.240]  accent I mean clearly it's actors giving us babies being killed out of
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:08.880]  incubators you know Libyan rape gangs raping the women turned out that was a
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:14.520]  lie I mean it's clear dumbed down war propaganda what is it like for you you
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:21.400]  know being Syrian watching all this unfold it's quite infuriating but from a
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:28.320]  very young age you know when the Iraq war was starting and what happened in
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:34.480]  Libya I always knew that one day serious turn would come so in some ways I'm
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:43.200]  quite prepared for it but the drive to act is still there you know it's it's
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:51.800]  really upsetting when your family is there and their living conditions is
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:56.200]  getting worse and worse and you know you'd like to go there and see them but
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:04:06.200]  because of the current situation with your you know bombings happening and
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:13.720]  insurgents running around it makes it difficult to say the least so from a
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:21.880]  personal position it's it's it's both infuriating and and saddening well now
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:25.360]  as you know NATO and others are talking about starting a humanitarian
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:30.800]  blockade an air campaign we saw how humanitarian Libya was when we come back
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:34.680]  I want to expand on this ask you what your family thinks of what's going on and
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:38.560]  you know the future of Syria because they've wrecked Libya it's now a hell
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:42.840]  hole for being the jewel of Africa with development and that's what the
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:46.680]  banksters want they want to destroy countries so they can come in and take
[02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:49.520]  them over and I want to get your view on what the average Syrian you talk to
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:55.720]  real perspective is on President Assad it's all coming up with Syrian girl I'm
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:05:03.240]  Alex Jones stay with us this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:07.680]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:11.720]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:15.640]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:19.640]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:24.200]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:28.240]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:32.040]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:35.640]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:40.000]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.160]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:52.800]  person in private but I'm gonna try the interview to get him to talk about you
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:56.000]  some of the things you can see the real Dave Mustaine really interesting
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:01.520]  obviously a very talented person I think number one hard rock metal guitarist of
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:05.040]  all time and he's in the top 10 guitarist period according to Rolling Stone
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:08.640]  and others he certainly is amazing and of course his wife is so sweet and
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:13.520]  intelligent as well great Christian people we're joined by a woman who goes
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:18.640]  with the name of Syrian girl and I've seen her videos on YouTube where she's
[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:21.920]  been interviewed by some other journalists and people and she wants to
[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:25.360]  be private and where she's at private but she's 100% Syrian and you know has
[02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:28.400]  family that she can report on what's happening but but but she does want to
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:31.640]  be private so that'll just pique everybody's interest exactly who she is
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:37.880]  but she'll go by Syrian girl and she joins us now recap the point you make
[02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:41.920]  about Alciyeda I just had Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer who ran the
[02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:45.280]  Bin Laden program trying to kill him who was blocked from killing him pointing
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:49.400]  out that Amaral Alakou who's run all the big terror attacks in the US is really
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:54.280]  a Pentagon double-agent White House agent now that's Colonel Schaefer you think
[02:09:54.280 --> 02:10:01.640]  that'd be big news but so so break down your view what's happening what break
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:08.200]  down the view in Syria of what people think of Al-Qaeda okay so in Syria
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:13.960]  everybody knows Al-Qaeda is the CIA like it's really really common knowledge you
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:20.120]  know you can ask any kid on the street and he'll tell you that so it's not
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:25.000]  really like what you just said though I haven't heard about it it doesn't
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.960]  surprise me at all because there's just so much information out there already of
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:35.200]  people that turned out to be double agents that you know were have children
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:39.880]  supposed to be part of Al-Qaeda so go over that because I've seen you have a
[02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:44.080]  great knowledge of it the history of it so some of the examples of proving it's
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:57.640]  Al-Caeda well first of all you have the one of the Libyan rebel leaders turns
[02:10:57.640 --> 02:11:02.120]  out he was tortured in Guantanamo Bay and he's part of Al-Qaeda and we all know
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:10.800]  that NATO and the US know they they supported the Libyan rebels so there
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:14.680]  are they're you know one of the big signs now which is what I mentioned in my
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:20.040]  video is that they're actually working with Al-Qaeda in these countries that
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:28.760]  we are seeing insurgency so Libya was one of them and in Syria also there are
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:34.920]  videos now coming out of some of the protesters and some of the people in the
[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:41.520]  so-called Free Syrian Army which is what the insurgents the name they give
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:47.320]  themselves carrying Al-Qaeda flags and these are like widely available on
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:54.920]  YouTube you can just search for it and it's there if I can go on another big
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:12:02.400]  indicator would be Al Jazeera who's since the very beginning was the only
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:13.040]  station that was able to get video of Osama bin Laden giving speeches and was
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:19.160]  the only one that was able to play them well or or desired to play them and you
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:23.160]  know whenever we heard about Al-Qaeda it was always from Al-Jazeera you know
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:27.240]  they're here they're there it's it was the thing that was promoting them and
[02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:34.160]  who controls Al-Zera well Qatar you know because it's Qatar's state TV who is
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:39.000]  sending special forces everywhere to try to overthrow Libya you name it bringing
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:43.960]  in Al-Qaeda and and I mean as you're pointing out that's why Qaddafi knew to
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:48.480]  try to jam Al-Jazeera because they were beaming in pro-war stuff it's so obvious
[02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:54.680]  yeah it's very obvious and it was obvious from the very very beginning like
[02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:59.480]  eight years ago or maybe it was more than eight years ago when Al-Zera would
[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:05.160]  even started you could tell by the way they reported things the word is its
[02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:11.240]  total British intelligence the whole thing yeah pretty much either US or
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:17.840]  British you know it doesn't really matter because they're all working you
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:22.760]  know together Israel and the country Qatar their allies their allies with the
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:27.920]  U.S. they control each other so it's like one big monster that's right
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:33.160]  continuing with Al-Qaeda examples from the Syrian perspective
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:39.080]  you know it's you when you're on this far it's difficult to think of than this
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:46.480]  just so many I'd like to cut this is maybe not an Al-Qaeda example but it's a
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:53.240]  very important example of false flag operations I'm not sure if anybody
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:14:00.640]  remembers but in Iraq in Basra two British soldiers like special forces
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:07.600]  soldiers were captured dressed up as Arabs shooting at Iraqi police which was
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:13.440]  by then under the control of the occupation and they were dressed in luck
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:19.000]  to mimic sort of like the Mehdi army and their car was filled with explosives
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:25.640]  and this was all over the news and the British army were you know the British
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:29.700]  leadership were so panicked about it that they set the army in to destroy and
[02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:33.480]  level the entire police station this is the police station that was allied with
[02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:38.160]  them to get these men out and they did but you can imagine what they knew and
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:46.240]  what they were doing dressed up as Arabs attacking their supposed allies so well
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:49.440]  you're right in fact while you're talking I just typed British soldiers
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:54.880]  captured in Basra and it's global research London independent BBC and
[02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:58.800]  it's them with their fake Wahhabist beards running around reportedly
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:06.600]  shooting at at soldiers as a pretext to get Shiites and Sunnis killing each other
[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:10.800]  and that's the goal as Colonel Shaffer said last hour is to get a Sunni Shiite
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:17.120]  war going here it is SAS defied MOD to rescue two of its men held hostage in
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:23.880]  Iraq and here's the image of them with their fake beards and all the rest of
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:28.320]  it captured and then there's the flaming tank image of the tanks attacking
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:33.240]  the police station which which was holding the men that had been captured
[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:37.760]  and there's the photos the video that they took on some of these sites it's
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:40.880]  the images of them with the fake beards we'll find it and show it to people but
[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:45.000]  yes that was a great example and I even had former top CIA analyst Ray McGovern
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:48.640]  on Syrian girl at the time and he pointed out examples where it was
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:53.560]  confirmed that the Golden Mosque was blown up by Western forces to get the
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:58.960]  people killing each other can you can you break down that Sunni Shiite rivalry
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:04.840]  that the West likes to manipulate sure thing and it's just you know divide and
[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:11.440]  conquer it's just like the old war game you know apply to Shiites and Sunnis I
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:17.240]  mean you can apply the same thing to Catholics and Protestants so at the
[02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:28.320]  moment you know Iran and Lebanon has a Shiite like population and they form in
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:34.000]  the lines with Syria and they can you know they have Hezbollah which is
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:41.880]  directly opposing Israel so on the one hand they are enemies of the Shia and
[02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:48.520]  then you have the Palestinians who are Sunni who are also fighting Israel so on
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:54.280]  the other hand they're against the Israelis are against the Sunnis as well
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:17:04.480]  so in Iraq the Americans ally themselves with a lot of the Shia although
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:10.520]  there were a lot of Sunni collaborators as well that should be noted but they
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:18.520]  wanted to get the Shia in power over the Sunnis because it was beneficial for
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:24.520]  them it was a way in and they got muscled out by the Iranians but that's
[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:32.240]  another story but around the Middle East it is mostly the Sunni majority
[02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:39.160]  countries which are in the Gulf Arab region and in North Africa not the not
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:52.360]  the Levant region where mostly hold on just a moment your Skype from on the
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:55.640]  other side of the planet is breaking up we're gonna wait while that gets a
[02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:59.760]  little bit better or perhaps reconnect with you let's see if your Skype came
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:07.240]  back now please repeat what you were saying oh I was saying that the Al Qaeda
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:14.160]  it's it's purported to be a Sunni organization but not exactly Sunni
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:20.880]  something worse like more extreme called Salafi and or Wahhabi is another
[02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:27.720]  extreme sect that they're very similar so at them in the same time the
[02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:36.080]  majority Sunni theocratic countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar and the Gulf
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:41.800]  Arab states are actually allies with the US so it's a really complicated mess
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:48.400]  but it when whatever country the US doesn't care which side it plays whether
[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:53.600]  it plays Shia and gives them power against Sunnis or gives Sunnis power
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:58.680]  against Shia at the end of the day they want to divide everybody and get
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:04.080]  everybody fighting and I think in some times they're succeeding but not in all
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:08.880]  cases by the way I did find the BBC article Iraq probing the soldier
[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:13.160]  incident it's got them with the guns hang grenades fake wigs out reportedly
[02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:17.760]  attacking Basra police and there was other cases of US forces being attacked
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:22.000]  by guys dressed up in bin Laden outfits this is full spectrum dominance you've
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:26.880]  got to manufacture the war so people really believe Al Qaeda exist and if
[02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:31.240]  you got to dress up special forces to get the job done and attack the Shiites
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:37.680]  to get them killing Sunnis well by golly you do it and just incredible and then
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:41.400]  the Iraqis were holding them this is our supposed allies saying look they were
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:44.840]  attacking we're gonna have a trial so they said the British troops attack the
[02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:50.880]  base tell a bunch of Iraqi troops that were trained by the British to get them
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:53.200]  out of there

[02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:06.040]  I began to do a lot of research into why even though I had a pretty good sized

[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:17.960]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost

[02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:21.360]  what if i say i'm not just another one of your place Syrian girl joins us Syrian
[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:25.760]  girl what is the feeling of people in Syria I mean are they I mean this is an
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:30.080]  invasion this is proxy armies Arab fighters the ones that were in Libya being
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:34.280]  brought in to invade your country this is part of the proxy wars they admit they
[02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:38.480]  got military paid off defecting over to try to open for the country and then I
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:41.840]  guess bring these purges in they're saying they're going to kill minority
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:47.400]  groups of Muslims that are part of part of smaller sex that they're also saying
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:51.000]  they're going to force the Christians out of Syria how is the how do you think
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:54.480]  the West is going to be able to sell this to the public when they do what
[02:24:54.480 --> 02:24:57.680]  they've done in your country the same thing they've done in Libya
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:03.440]  our people are not going to buy it because our people have a very long memory
[02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:08.840]  and we remember what happened and we won't forget what they're doing now so
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:15.280]  you know I don't need to tell you that they're not buying it because you can
[02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:20.120]  see it yourself you know there it's been 12 months now there haven't been any
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:29.920]  mass you know rallies there haven't been any support for this foreign armed
[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:37.520]  funded and even oftentimes the men themselves are foreign there's just
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:43.520]  no support for it so you know this is not this this has nothing to do with
[02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:48.640]  whether or not they agree with the government or not people who oppose the
[02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:54.360]  government know what's going on so I don't I don't see them selling it to
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:26:03.400]  Syrians at all this I for me I can't see them having any way forward unless they
[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:09.920]  attack unless they do as they're saying which is to get NATO and have a no-fly
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:14.440]  zone or an invasion and how are they going to do that when Russia is not
[02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:24.640]  going to let them I don't see a way forward for them continue okay in terms of
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:37.600]  Syrians and how we feel we're we're both afraid and excited I know that once the
[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:45.120]  war starts I know where I'm gonna be and you know we're ready to defend our land
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:53.600]  to the end and we think that Israel better not think that it's gonna be left
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:59.840]  out of that global war it's you know it's gonna be directly in the line of
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:06.160]  fire if Syria is going and and so are they our enemies are numerous but we
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:12.480]  also have some very good friends so serious not going down without a fight
[02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:18.160]  that's that's what I'd like to be known what about the Russian fleet that's
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:23.320]  doctor at your port what about the fact that Russia says well they vetoed the
[02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:28.320]  UN attack and so now they're saying well we'll go ahead and now the UN saying
[02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:32.040]  they'll go ahead and get behind it and not even follow the rules I mean this is
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:42.360]  crazy a major escalation are you mean NATO yeah I think that Russia is for
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:47.440]  Syria for Russia Syria is a red line and that's because their base in Tartus
[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:55.480]  their naval base is one of their last positions in the Middle East and their
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:28:03.640]  last defense against Europe and Turkey's missile defense treaty so for Russia
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:09.480]  it's very important to maintain their relationship with Syria and not have
[02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:17.160]  Syria be taken over yet you know be another one to fall to the US and NATO
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:22.840]  sphere of influence so if Russia is not gonna back down and if they're gonna
[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:27.920]  disobey the rules the only foreseeable conclusion to that would be World War
[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:40.960]  3 I certainly don't doubt that they're prepared for it and that they will do it
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:48.120]  you know I whether nuclear bombs are involved I I don't know that my well
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:51.720]  remember it was an Israeli Prime Minister that tried to make a deal with
[02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:55.800]  Syria a peace treaty and he got murdered and there's a lot of interest that don't
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:29:00.600]  want peace but undoubtedly you could say what you want about Assad the West is
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:04.680]  sending in al Qaeda and others to overthrow the country and calling them
[02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:09.360]  protesters when they are the ones starting it and shooting people and they
[02:29:09.360 --> 02:29:13.240]  and the West isn't doing this to try to bring more freedom to Syria they want to
[02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:17.920]  destabilize it what percentage of the Syrians I would you say on average are
[02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:22.160]  supporting the government now I saw some numbers that even though well let's do a
[02:29:22.160 --> 02:29:24.600]  few more minutes after the break then we'll get to some excerpts of my speech
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:29.240]  in Dallas because this is so important and I want to ask you that question
[02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:32.560]  Syrian girl after the break I know you're private and are just doing this
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:35.160]  because you don't want your country to be attacked it's already being attacked by
[02:29:35.160 --> 02:29:39.440]  proxies you don't want to say who you are how folks can contact you but think
[02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:42.920]  about that if you want to give out any contact info or email to people that
[02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:46.240]  might want to talk to you when we come back on the other side because info
[02:29:46.240 --> 02:29:51.840]  war certainly doesn't want to hoard you to ourselves here we're on the march the

[02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:36.160]  info wars news dot com and prison planet dot TV thank you for joining us we're
[02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:38.880]  doing four or five more minutes with Syrian girl obviously when I have her
[02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:42.840]  back up in the near future she's very informed very articulate and we're also
[02:33:42.840 --> 02:33:45.520]  gonna try to get some other guests on journalists who've been going to Syria
[02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:49.440]  just like we did with what happened in Libya Tarpley went over to Syria a while
[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:54.280]  back we're gonna get him back on about that but undoubtedly this is a proxy
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:34:00.120]  war and what is your view of Assad I mean again how popular is he really and
[02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:05.800]  what do you expect to happen if the proxy war continues if the love bomb
[02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:15.200]  bombardment the trendy illegal peace bombing begins by NATO and I mean now
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:18.480]  saying they can't even get the UN resolution so just go ahead I mean first
[02:34:18.480 --> 02:34:23.000]  Obama said I'll attack Libya with a UN resolution not Congress now they can't
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:27.680]  even get the UN I mean this is so lawless this is preemptive war through
[02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:32.600]  proxies imagine a foreign country coming and stirring up groups to attack us over
[02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:37.120]  the border and then calling them freedom fighters and then calling it protests
[02:34:37.120 --> 02:34:44.880]  when people are militarily attacking well first of all I want to say the road
[02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:51.520]  to hell is paved in good intentions and the most annoying people are the ones
[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:58.520]  that think that they're helping us out by you know supporting these insurgents
[02:34:58.520 --> 02:35:06.880]  that are bombing forcing people from their homes as far as my opinion on the
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:13.040]  government I will get to it but more importantly I want to discuss you know
[02:35:13.040 --> 02:35:18.680]  Syria as a whole okay we got five minutes left I'm giving you the floor then
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:22.560]  Syria as a whole and then Assad any other points you want to make because this is
[02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:30.440]  in a riveting information okay thank you Syria as a whole how can I tell you
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:36.560]  statistics percentages I can't I can only tell you that the vast majority of
[02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:43.440]  the country in spite of how they feel about the government do not want this
[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:50.400]  NATO-led insurgency to take over because not only are they going to be puppets
[02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:54.000]  of the West not only are they going to destroy the country in the process of
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:59.160]  doing so they're also not democratic they are a
[02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:07.960]  theocratic sectarian Islamic movement that want to control and destroy our
[02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:16.200]  secular way of life and Syrians do not agree with this you can see that by the
[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:21.320]  way that they're acting I can tell you that you know the majority of Syrians
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:30.040]  went out and voted for our new constitution which opens up the the way
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:37.880]  for new political parties and for future elections so most majority of people
[02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:43.760]  are for the reform process and the new constitution is already in place there
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:51.280]  you know you can split Syria up into three I guess there are people who
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:57.400]  support Bashar they think that he is our you know savior he's gonna deliver us
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:04.520]  from this that are you know have been core bathists which is the ideology of
[02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:10.600]  the party from the beginning and there's people who are newly you know
[02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:16.920]  supporting Bashar because they they want him to make the reform process happen
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:23.520]  then there's people who oppose the government because of corruption and
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:29.240]  things have happened in the past and they also don't don't also not going to
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:34.080]  side with Israel our enemies nor NATO and then okay this is four not three so
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:39.960]  maybe I can't count but finally is a minority of people who have been sold
[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:48.960]  the lie just like the Iraqi collaborators were sold the lie that you the US is
[02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:54.160]  this liberator you know it's fantastic they're so humanitarian they're gonna
[02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:59.560]  come and save everybody and you know this is the way to get power and the way
[02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:05.440]  to get freedom whatever that you know means to them is by aligning with the
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:13.400]  US now I think that is such naivety and opportunism and it's just disgusting to
[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:20.560]  the core and I cannot call these people Syrian so if you want by my definition
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:30.320]  of what is Syrian 100 percent of us oppose NATO and this attack against our
[02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:36.120]  country well that's right it's gonna be I mean look Iran 70 plus percent like the
[02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:39.920]  moolas but every analyst says an attack on Iran will unify the entire
[02:38:39.920 --> 02:38:44.440]  population behind the moolas that's how people work and now that your country is
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:47.920]  clearly being attacked with proxy armies NATO saying we're gonna drop bombs on
[02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:52.000]  you because it's humanitarian you know when we give weapons to people blowing
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.840]  up buildings they're peaceful protesters when the government fights it
[02:38:54.840 --> 02:39:01.280]  they're evil al Qaeda's good Syria's bad I mean all of this is so ridiculous that
[02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:07.440]  it's going to unify Syria I mean I don't need to be Syrian to know that I just
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:12.000]  wanted to say in answer your question earlier about how people might contact me
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:19.040]  I have a Twitter the name is partisan girl and of course they might have seen
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:25.520]  other interviews I've done on YouTube channel 108 Morris 108 again give us
[02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:31.680]  the Twitter it's twitter.com forward slash partisan girl no spaces partisan girl
[02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:35.880]  that's awesome and well and we'll send a link up to my Twitter of the real Alex

[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:44.280]  be able to to contact you there and hopefully things don't continue to
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:47.240]  unfold in Syria in a bad but it looks like that is gonna happen so I'd like
[02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:52.840]  to be able to have you pop in and give your perspective as this unfolds anytime
[02:39:52.840 --> 02:40:00.520]  alright anything else you'd like to add in about 60 seconds about Bashar yes
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:11.120]  Aslan his father you know he might have been whatever you might want to call
[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:15.240]  what happened you know people have different opinions but Bashar from the
[02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:20.640]  beginning has been more of a reformer however there's an old guard in Syria
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:26.840]  that have prevented him from undertaking much of the reforms that he
[02:40:26.840 --> 02:40:34.720]  wanted to make but at least now with the support of the people hopefully the
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:40.240]  reform process is going to happen what is your personal so you see overall he's
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:44.120]  been a reformer trying to change an old system and certainly you know it's not
[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:47.840]  going to get better look at Egypt it's gotten ten times worse and they've got
[02:40:47.840 --> 02:40:52.600]  women having to wear the headdresses and everything now since they was
[02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:57.480]  liberated and it's just it's just incredible all right well the Syrian

[02:42:14.800 --> 02:42:25.080]  here for the Mario Andretti the rock all rolled into one it's time for Alex
[02:42:25.080 --> 02:42:35.200]  Jones now look at all these articles and documents and notes I've got hell I

[02:42:38.280 --> 02:42:44.040]  earlier when I introduced that documentary just showed I am humbled by
[02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:48.000]  meeting you I'm humbled by by talking to you and I know that it's in people like
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:54.320]  you that we're gonna turn this around because because we don't have a choice
[02:42:54.320 --> 02:42:59.800]  how many times have we been lied to how many times have we caught the system
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:06.280]  doing everything it can not just to rob us but to try to ruin our lives so that
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:11.880]  we're weak and poor and dominated by them so they can control our destiny I
[02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:22.840]  don't like that I want to see humanity doing well I want to see humanity
[02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:28.520]  empowered you know my dad's a dentist and at least once a year for more than
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:33.600]  20 years he's gone to Latin America to be part of these free clinics for these
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:37.080]  different doctors organizations to take care of kids and he told me the same
[02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:41.040]  stories that my uncle told me who did years of work as a missionary in
[02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:45.960]  Central and South America and he said you know you don't appreciate life even
[02:43:45.960 --> 02:43:51.080]  though my uncle was in Vietnam a helicopter pilot until you see children
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:55.440]  orphanages where the orphanages don't even have the money to pay for food
[02:43:55.440 --> 02:43:59.960]  there's little kids with their ribcage is sticking out that's what we're
[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:03.600]  talking about you have to realize I have to realize and really let it burn into
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:09.640]  our brains that more than 15 million children according to the UN and their
[02:44:09.640 --> 02:44:16.640]  own numbers it's probably higher 15 million children a year starved to death
[02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:24.160]  on this planet and another 20 million adults and our corrupt stinking corporate
[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:33.960]  fascist government pays farmers not to produce food and it's not just they're
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:37.960]  trying to protect our markets then you find out that they've got all these
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:42.360]  endless white papers as many as you could ever read every day Aaron Dyke's
[02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:45.520]  doing research and others of my crew bring in this is on the Rockefeller
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:49.480]  Foundation this is on the Carnegie Foundation this is on the Ford Foundation
[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:53.040]  here's a Planned Parenthood document oh where is it it's on you know this
[02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:58.920]  university site archive talking about how in the 30s 40s and 50s we got to shut
[02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:04.520]  food off to people to kill them and then some people say well there are too many
[02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:10.360]  people I love the yuppies that'll say well okay there is a population control
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:14.680]  agenda but there are too many of those people and I'm like don't you get it you
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:23.040]  little jackass bastard you you think you're part of the system your water your
[02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:30.320]  food your vaccines it's all jack with the same stuff you little piece of crap
[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:40.200]  there is nothing more pathetic than some coward who is so cowardly they play
[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:43.920]  like a little dress-up game in their mind a little make-believe game in their
[02:45:43.920 --> 02:45:48.480]  mind that they're part of the winning team because they go along with all this
[02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:55.640]  that it's like some kind of open joke like a some type of game I've had so
[02:45:55.640 --> 02:45:59.200]  called establishment types it's always somebody who's worth like 50 million
[02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:02.040]  dollars and thinks they're part of the elite when I didn't even middle class
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:07.560]  for the globalist who will come up to me and say well Alex you know maybe 911
[02:46:07.560 --> 02:46:11.520]  isn't in such job but you know it takes things like that to get the people doing
[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:16.200]  what they're supposed to like this sack of garbage thinks they're part of the
[02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:20.200]  system because they can understand false flag terror and understand that's what
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:26.080]  it takes to defend America know if they did evil things like that to defeat
[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:30.040]  evil it'd be evil because you can't become evil to defeat evil like the
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:33.960]  ring of Sauron and Lord of the Rings doesn't work that way but they're not
[02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:38.560]  using evil to defeat evil they're not even following that fallacy they have
[02:46:38.560 --> 02:46:44.200]  given themselves totally over to it the globalists compete with each other to
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:50.760]  see who is the most wicked and ruthless and in that process have become total
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:56.760]  madmen as I documented in this earlier presentation that you saw and that was
[02:46:56.760 --> 02:47:01.920]  only the tip of the iceberg our problem and compiling that 40 minutes was that
[02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:06.040]  there was so much we didn't get to so much that we couldn't cover so much that
[02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:12.920]  we couldn't show you how much crisis this world is in now with that said I've
[02:47:12.920 --> 02:47:19.320]  given you the blueprint of madmen I want to give you the blueprint to defeat the
[02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:32.760]  new world order this world's engineers the controllers of this planet always
[02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:37.560]  seek to teach you that resources are finite they always seek to teach you
[02:47:37.560 --> 02:47:42.080]  that for you to win somebody else has got to lose they know full well that's
[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:46.720]  not how this world works that we have unlimited potential that we're made in
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:50.320]  the image of the creator whether you believe in that or not human kind has
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:54.800]  given us Beethoven literature they've given us all of the science all of the
[02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:59.160]  beauty they've given us people like Whitney Houston's voice all the things
[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:04.160]  that are in humanity all the good and it's by recognizing that good and that
[02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:08.480]  potential and by reaching for what's good and empowers us that we have hope
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:14.040]  for the future our ancestors and God knows they weren't perfect understood
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:18.800]  sacrifices standing up for what's right and that's the only reason we're here
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:24.960]  today why do you think the United States such a small area geographically for the
[02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:30.880]  land surface of this planet and only four and a half percent of the world's
[02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:37.840]  population 100% 7 million the United States is four and a half or 4.9
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:42.240]  depending on what's actually where you look at but less than 5% of the world's
[02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:47.440]  population why did the United States with less than 5% of the world's
[02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:52.920]  population have more than half the wealth of the world freedom and it
[02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:57.400]  doesn't mean that our higher level of freedom was perfect doesn't mean that
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:01.200]  there wasn't injustice didn't mean that there weren't problems but compared to
[02:49:01.200 --> 02:49:07.600]  every other place in the world we didn't have the corrupt elites on top of us
[02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:12.920]  trying to shut down human destiny shut down human ingenuity and creativity
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:16.440]  because they're threatened by it because they want a monopoly because the
[02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:22.640]  United States only had a few glimmers and moments of freedom we developed the
[02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:27.080]  highest test scores we developed the most scientific developments we created
[02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:31.760]  the media and the literature and the art and the music that has conquered the
[02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:38.000]  world and the globalist the global scientific engineers saw that they were
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:42.680]  aware of that they knew that and so they did everything they could to take that
[02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:47.400]  over and to take our energies and turn it against humanity so now America is in
[02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:52.320]  a paradox America right here at this center place where we live make no
[02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:57.640]  mistake is where the battle will be fought is where the decisions will be
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:50:02.680]  made we are the great evil empire but we are also the great deliverer from the
[02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:07.640]  tyranny but we have to decide who we are
[02:50:11.440 --> 02:50:18.120]  that's why the struggle between good and evil is being decided here because we
[02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:23.560]  have the birthright of liberty because we have the basic freedom because we are
[02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:31.600]  armed like no other nation on earth the globalist have not taken this republic
[02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:37.840]  but I've never been able to do this on the radio I can never get to the second
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:43.680]  point without without going off into rants it may be a bad speech it may be
[02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:47.760]  the best ever but I'm going to attempt with your help to go through all these

[02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:51.160]  I'll start at the top again I want to thank you all for being here I want to
[02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:57.760]  thank my crew but I also want to thank all of you I love that Teddy Roosevelt
[02:54:57.760 --> 02:55:01.960]  quote I should have had it as I could go to properly but forget the critic the
[02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:05.000]  person who's not in the arena what matters is the person who is in the
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:08.720]  arena who knows the great challenges the great struggles because even if you
[02:55:08.720 --> 02:55:13.240]  fail at least you you tried to dare greatly that's what matters it's trying
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:21.120]  that's where it all starts is taking action that's what's fulfilling and I
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:27.040]  want to say this to you here now because I was told several times last week and
[02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:35.200]  again the day that I am the 21st century Paul Revere and I said no you are the
[02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:46.760]  21st century Paul Revere and this is not a battle this is not a war against the
[02:55:46.760 --> 02:55:51.960]  undefeated British Imperial Redcoats who'd never been defeated and George
[02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:56.720]  Washington lost almost every battle for five years but they persevered it was
[02:55:56.720 --> 02:56:01.560]  the continuing to fight it was the resistance that was the victory and
[02:56:01.560 --> 02:56:05.480]  that's why the system attacks that victory because it hates it anything the
[02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:08.520]  new order attacks you better believe that's where the that's where the
[02:56:08.520 --> 02:56:11.840]  liberty is that's where the freedom is that's what's good not because it's
[02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:16.960]  perfect but like King David of the Bible the heart is right that's what matters
[02:56:16.960 --> 02:56:21.120]  none of us are perfect and the system will try to tell us how we're bad and
[02:56:21.120 --> 02:56:25.720]  how we're impure and how we're not good none of that matters it's our hearts that
[02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:32.400]  matter it's what we stand for it's who we are in the final equation that matters
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:39.200]  do we serve light or do we serve the murdering destructive darkness that's
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:44.400]  the question that you must decide and it's a decision you must make the system
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:48.520]  tells you there's not that decision because that decision is there and that
[02:56:48.520 --> 02:56:53.360]  decision is where all the power in this universe resides as Martin Luther King
[02:56:53.360 --> 02:57:01.040]  said the universe bends towards justice providence is on the side of justice
[02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:08.800]  the minute the second you commit yourself to liberty and freedom and
[02:57:08.800 --> 02:57:22.400]  justice even your body be killed your spirit truly has victory so I say it
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:30.280]  to you now we are all Paul Revere and we're not just fighting for freedom in
[02:57:30.280 --> 02:57:43.400]  North America this is 1776 worldwide our republics wealth and everything it is
[02:57:43.400 --> 02:57:49.560]  and all of its challenges has now been teamed up pulling the globalist system
[02:57:49.560 --> 02:57:55.920]  of enslavement and war and death we are now in bondage to pure evil our
[02:57:55.920 --> 02:58:01.880]  energies and everything our ancestors built is now slave to this evil and we
[02:58:01.880 --> 02:58:09.600]  must break the chains of slavery we must break them now we must declare liberty
[02:58:15.680 --> 02:58:20.840]  now those are just the notes appear on the top of the page because I mean I'm
[02:58:20.840 --> 02:58:24.880]  sitting there writing key points I want to cover and just thinking I'm not
[02:58:24.880 --> 02:58:29.480]  worthy to bring you this message but it doesn't matter because it's a mission we
[02:58:29.480 --> 02:58:36.840]  must all carry out and what matters is that we give 110 percent
[02:58:36.840 --> 02:58:51.880]  thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today
