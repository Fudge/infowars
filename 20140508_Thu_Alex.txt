[00:00.000 --> 00:08.960]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:08.960 --> 00:09.960]  You want answers?
[00:09.960 --> 00:10.960]  It's Thursday, folks.
[00:10.960 --> 00:11.960]  Well, so does he.
[00:11.960 --> 00:12.960]  Thanks, Dave.
[00:12.960 --> 00:20.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:20.280 --> 00:36.800]  Trap yourselves in, as I feel like this all the time trying to politically awaken people
[00:36.800 --> 00:40.560]  that they're being lied to, that there's an agenda that's not left or right.
[00:40.560 --> 00:43.040]  It's, hey, there's mind control going on.
[00:43.040 --> 00:46.720]  The signals broadcast 24 hours a day through all this media.
[00:46.720 --> 00:49.560]  Just become aware of it, and they'll say, there's nothing going on.
[00:49.560 --> 00:55.040]  And I want to say, put on these glasses or start chewing concrete.
[00:55.040 --> 01:03.360]  They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
[01:03.360 --> 01:10.040]  They have recruited the rich and the powerful, and they have blinded us to the truth.
[01:10.040 --> 01:13.160]  The question is, do we all work for central bankers?
[01:13.160 --> 01:16.000]  That's what I want to address to our guests tonight.
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.960]  Our impulses are being redirected.
[01:18.960 --> 01:24.560]  We are living in an artificially-induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[01:24.560 --> 01:31.000]  An estimated 50 to 70 million Americans suffer from a sleep disorder or sleep deprivation.
[01:31.000 --> 01:39.560]  Outside the limit of our sight, feeding office, preach on top of us from right to death, our
[01:39.560 --> 01:40.560]  owners.
[01:40.560 --> 01:45.240]  The latest census numbers prove the United States has the biggest gap between rich and
[01:45.240 --> 01:48.200]  poor compared to all westernized countries today.
[01:48.200 --> 01:55.080]  Our projections show that by the year 2025, not only America, but the entire planet, will
[01:55.080 --> 01:59.400]  be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance.
[01:59.400 --> 02:06.400]  The gains have been substantial both for ourselves and for you, the human power elite.
[02:06.400 --> 02:19.920]  And for the first time in all of human history, mankind is politically awakened.
[02:19.920 --> 02:21.920]  That's a total new reality.
[02:21.920 --> 02:25.320]  I've got one that can see.
[02:25.320 --> 02:27.800]  We can't be the only ones who can see.
[02:27.800 --> 02:33.280]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing
[02:33.280 --> 02:38.560]  more than some separate sinister entity that's got them at the root of all our problems.
[02:38.560 --> 02:42.600]  It's a new morning in America, fresh, vital.
[02:42.600 --> 02:44.920]  The old cynicism is gone.
[02:44.920 --> 02:47.480]  We have faith in our leaders.
[02:47.480 --> 02:51.800]  We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
[02:51.800 --> 02:55.600]  It really boils down to our ability to accept.
[02:55.600 --> 02:57.600]  We don't need pessimism.
[02:57.600 --> 03:00.760]  I have two words for you.
[03:00.760 --> 03:03.760]  We're drones.
[03:03.760 --> 03:07.920]  And who are your little guys?
[03:07.920 --> 03:09.440]  We will never see it coming.
[03:09.440 --> 03:10.440]  Don't predict.
[03:10.440 --> 03:15.280]  The first guy who uses a second amendment weapon to bring a drone down that's been hovering
[03:15.280 --> 03:19.440]  over his house is going to be a folk hero in this country.
[03:19.440 --> 03:26.040]  And there is a signal broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
[03:26.040 --> 03:32.480]  I'm just trying to warn you, folks, the television is a giant LED weapon system.
[03:32.480 --> 03:34.280]  It's so advanced.
[03:34.280 --> 03:38.720]  They got a monkey farm in Bastrop, folks, that they do all sorts of testing on great apes,
[03:38.720 --> 03:41.840]  Reese's monkeys, the whole nine yards, and they'd go, oh, you didn't see this and punch
[03:41.840 --> 03:46.040]  a button into hundreds of monkeys with wires in their brains with television sets brainwashing
[03:46.040 --> 03:47.040]  them.
[03:47.040 --> 03:54.040]  All I ever have to do is be famous, and people watch me, and they love me.
[03:54.040 --> 03:56.040]  You can have a little taste of that good life, too.
[03:56.040 --> 03:57.040]  Now, I know you want it.
[03:57.040 --> 03:59.040]  Hell, everybody does.
[03:59.040 --> 04:01.600]  Do it to your own kind.
[04:01.600 --> 04:03.040]  What's the threat?
[04:03.040 --> 04:04.880]  We all sell out every day.
[04:04.880 --> 04:06.680]  Much will be on the winning team.
[04:06.680 --> 04:13.200]  The real men of the world have to stand up and say, I have come here to chew bubblegum
[04:13.200 --> 04:14.200]  and kick ass.
[04:14.200 --> 04:19.200]  And I'm all out of bubblegum.
[04:19.200 --> 04:21.720]  Time to take a stand, boys.
[04:21.720 --> 04:22.720]  You know what?
[04:22.720 --> 04:27.360]  No courage, stand up for yourself.
[04:27.360 --> 04:34.080]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[04:34.080 --> 04:35.080]  the Info War.
[04:35.080 --> 04:40.720]  The after-winners give a press conference and how to buy a sailboat as-
[04:40.720 --> 05:03.440]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[05:03.440 --> 05:07.840]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate.
[05:07.840 --> 05:11.440]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[05:11.440 --> 05:14.400]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[05:14.400 --> 05:18.280]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[05:18.280 --> 05:21.960]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[05:21.960 --> 05:25.920]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[05:25.920 --> 05:30.480]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[05:30.480 --> 05:35.760]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[05:35.760 --> 05:39.960]  All right, it is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[05:39.960 --> 05:43.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[05:43.000 --> 05:44.560]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[05:44.560 --> 05:45.920]  It's time to take action.
[05:45.920 --> 05:47.920]  It's time to filter our water.

[05:59.520 --> 06:04.960]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[06:04.960 --> 06:06.680]  toxic each and every day.
[06:06.680 --> 06:09.080]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[06:09.080 --> 06:13.520]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even
[06:13.520 --> 06:14.520]  outdoor air.
[06:14.520 --> 06:19.680]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[06:19.680 --> 06:23.120]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[06:23.120 --> 06:27.200]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[06:27.200 --> 06:31.560]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[06:31.560 --> 06:35.920]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[06:35.920 --> 06:41.000]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[06:41.000 --> 06:42.000]  back against.
[06:42.000 --> 06:46.360]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[06:46.360 --> 06:50.840]  The new InfoWarsLife Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[06:50.840 --> 06:53.000]  with you throughout any toxic environment.
[06:53.000 --> 06:59.440]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[06:59.440 --> 07:04.160]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda they are manipulating
[07:04.160 --> 07:05.320]  our genetics.
[07:05.320 --> 07:10.440]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and
[07:10.440 --> 07:14.000]  other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[07:14.000 --> 07:18.440]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others we have developed what
[07:18.440 --> 07:25.680]  I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful
[07:25.680 --> 07:30.640]  organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[07:30.640 --> 07:36.120]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[07:36.120 --> 07:38.640]  of using synthetic chemicals.
[07:38.640 --> 07:43.960]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended
[07:43.960 --> 07:44.960]  dose.
[07:44.960 --> 07:51.040]  For a limited time we are offering 15% off super male vitality at infowarslife.com to
[07:51.040 --> 07:53.520]  introduce you to this powerful supplement.
[07:53.520 --> 08:10.160]  Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality, infowarslife.com.
[08:10.160 --> 08:16.120]  In the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence
[08:16.120 --> 08:29.800]  whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex.
[08:29.800 --> 08:32.600]  It's the military mission in North St. Louis.
[08:32.600 --> 08:36.720]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see those
[08:36.720 --> 08:39.480]  over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[08:39.480 --> 08:44.280]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis do not be alarmed.
[08:44.280 --> 08:46.960]  Guns will be taken and no one will be able to be armed.
[08:46.960 --> 08:48.120]  We will take all weapons.
[08:48.120 --> 08:50.520]  Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in.
[08:50.520 --> 08:55.120]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[08:55.120 --> 08:56.120]  Enough.
[08:56.120 --> 08:57.120]  Enough.
[08:57.120 --> 08:58.120]  Enough.
[08:58.120 --> 08:59.120]  Enough.
[08:59.120 --> 09:02.760]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[09:02.760 --> 09:06.920]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[09:06.920 --> 09:11.200]  Anastasia's late news 12th Jeff Ferrell discovered that clergy would help the government with
[09:11.200 --> 09:14.280]  potentially their biggest problem, us.
[09:14.280 --> 09:17.920]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to
[09:17.920 --> 09:22.280]  their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[09:22.280 --> 09:26.120]  If you got a business, you didn't build that.
[09:26.120 --> 09:28.680]  Somebody else made that happen.
[09:28.680 --> 09:33.560]  Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[09:33.560 --> 09:34.560]  Pediatric.
[09:34.560 --> 09:39.800]  Black Hawk choppers soaring to the night sky but this is only a drill.
[09:39.800 --> 09:47.960]  Early armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect house to house.
[09:47.960 --> 09:57.240]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[09:57.240 --> 09:59.800]  I am in my apartment sir.
[09:59.800 --> 10:00.800]  The blacking song right now.
[10:00.800 --> 10:01.800]  I am inside.
[10:01.800 --> 10:04.080]  I have two words for you.
[10:04.080 --> 10:05.080]  Predator gloves.
[10:05.080 --> 10:10.880]  You will never see it coming.
[10:10.880 --> 10:15.120]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras, parents grabbing their children
[10:15.120 --> 10:19.440]  and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves
[10:19.440 --> 10:22.800]  face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[10:22.800 --> 10:25.680]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in and now they're coming
[10:25.680 --> 10:28.280]  in like they're trespassers punching and shoving people.
[10:28.280 --> 10:33.480]  We're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not knocking down.
[10:33.480 --> 10:45.360]  We are on the march, the empire is on the run, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's
[10:45.360 --> 10:46.360]  Alex Jones.
[10:46.360 --> 11:13.360]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[11:13.360 --> 11:21.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the eighth day already of May 2014.
[11:21.720 --> 11:28.300]  We have several guests joining us today, Ray McGovern, former top CA analyst to Ronald
[11:28.300 --> 11:32.720]  Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush was going to be on, but he's under the weather
[11:32.720 --> 11:38.640]  just recovered from cancer and so he is recommending a top former State Department official to
[11:38.640 --> 11:43.280]  come on that he says will give a similar analysis of the Ukraine crisis.
[11:43.280 --> 11:47.440]  I wanted to get Ray McGovern's take, I want to get different perspectives on this, but
[11:47.440 --> 11:52.720]  we're working on another individual formerly with the State Department to come on that
[11:52.720 --> 11:54.400]  he says is of his caliber.
[11:54.400 --> 12:01.120]  And then Bruce Fine, the man, more than anybody else that you can thank for this radio show
[12:01.120 --> 12:06.880]  you're listening to right now, he never comes on the show and toots his own horn.
[12:06.880 --> 12:13.840]  But Mr. Fine was the deputy head of the Federal Communications Commission in the late 80s
[12:13.840 --> 12:22.200]  under Ronald Reagan in 97, 98 who successfully got it set up to where we can have talk radio
[12:22.200 --> 12:28.960]  and get rid of the quote fairness doctrine that restricts the First Amendment.
[12:28.960 --> 12:36.720]  So we're going to have him on to talk about the new FCC chair criticizing the board and
[12:36.720 --> 12:42.280]  the Obama administration saying quote what's going through right now regulatory could basically
[12:42.280 --> 12:44.280]  shut down the Drudge Report.
[12:44.280 --> 12:50.280]  That was the archetypal image of independent non-state run media FCC chair warns that conservative
[12:50.280 --> 12:58.560]  media like Drudge could face regulation like Pax and that's how they did the fairness doctrine
[12:58.560 --> 13:03.920]  previously that they had from the 50s up to 1987.
[13:03.920 --> 13:08.520]  And then you saw the rise of stuff that wasn't perfect but at least something that countered
[13:08.520 --> 13:14.040]  total monolithic fathers are bad turn your guns in, world government's good, Gloria Steinem
[13:14.040 --> 13:20.280]  and the CIA love you, dress your son in a dress, slit your wrist, take Prozac.
[13:20.280 --> 13:25.840]  There was finally something to counter the nihilistic human suicide movement, the culture
[13:25.840 --> 13:32.240]  of death, abortuary movement that is now in total collapse with no ratings, no viewers
[13:32.240 --> 13:33.240]  to speak of.
[13:33.240 --> 13:39.240]  So if you have half a million viewers on your top show on CNN or on MSNBC, you are dead
[13:39.240 --> 13:41.520]  on arrival.
[13:41.520 --> 13:43.440]  You do not exist.
[13:43.440 --> 13:45.640]  You are a joke.
[13:45.640 --> 13:50.040]  There are radio shows in New York City on one station that have a million listeners per
[13:50.040 --> 13:51.040]  day.
[13:51.040 --> 13:56.840]  Okay, just to give you an idea, three million listeners here a day, eight, nine million
[13:56.840 --> 14:03.360]  Rush Limbaugh, five, six million Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Coast to Coast A.M. with George
[14:03.360 --> 14:04.360]  Norring.
[14:04.360 --> 14:08.600]  I mean, whatever you think of those shows, the point is they are not what you would
[14:08.600 --> 14:11.440]  see as establishment media.
[14:11.440 --> 14:12.760]  The system doesn't see them as that.
[14:12.760 --> 14:16.080]  The White House and their own memos from Clinton and under Obama doesn't.
[14:16.080 --> 14:20.640]  They want that shut down because if they can shut down Alex Jones and if they can shut
[14:20.640 --> 14:26.800]  down Glenn Beck, if they can shut down Michael Savage, they can shut your blog, your website,
[14:26.800 --> 14:29.760]  your newspaper down.
[14:29.760 --> 14:34.720]  And now the FCC is claiming jurisdiction over the Internet, over print media, over all
[14:34.720 --> 14:37.880]  transmissions, not just broadcast.
[14:37.880 --> 14:43.520]  They've only had a broadcast regulatory jurisdiction claiming interstate commerce if your station
[14:43.520 --> 14:45.680]  goes over state lines.
[14:45.680 --> 14:51.560]  Now they are belling up with Internet too and the rest of it to take over the Internet.
[14:51.560 --> 14:55.720]  Everything to set up these thought police units that will actually come into your offices
[14:55.720 --> 14:59.600]  and see if you're, quote, biased or racist, I mean, let me tell you something.
[14:59.600 --> 15:05.240]  We're not having any Obama administration or Republican administration, anybody in the
[15:05.240 --> 15:09.240]  future in my office to review what I cover and what I do.
[15:09.240 --> 15:11.720]  You can go straight to hell where you came from.
[15:11.720 --> 15:13.840]  You understand that scum?
[15:13.840 --> 15:15.960]  I will not bow to that.
[15:15.960 --> 15:21.560]  I'm not turning my guns in and I'm not turning my free speech in and you are going to be
[15:21.560 --> 15:22.880]  defeated and you know it.
[15:22.880 --> 15:23.960]  But they're going to try.
[15:23.960 --> 15:27.120]  They may launch cyber attacks on the web to try to take it over and claim they're saving
[15:27.120 --> 15:29.160]  it and then basically shut it down.
[15:29.160 --> 15:30.160]  But there it is.
[15:30.160 --> 15:33.440]  FCC quietly kills controversial newsroom study.
[15:33.440 --> 15:34.440]  Print that for me.
[15:34.440 --> 15:37.960]  That was in February and that's a faint.
[15:37.960 --> 15:39.600]  That's a faint.
[15:39.600 --> 15:43.040]  Like where you move to the left but then you move and strike to the right or in football
[15:43.040 --> 15:46.880]  where they do the fake handoff but run up the middle because a month later they brought
[15:46.880 --> 15:52.160]  it back under a new name as the Boston Herald reported last week, calling it chilling, calling
[15:52.160 --> 15:56.320]  it potentially First Amendment destroying.
[15:56.320 --> 16:02.040]  So they're back with a new name of it and we're going to be covering that today with
[16:02.040 --> 16:06.080]  Bruce Fine who again almost no one even knows who he is.
[16:06.080 --> 16:11.320]  He's top constitutional lawyer, former deputy head of the FCC to get his expert take on
[16:11.320 --> 16:12.320]  it.
[16:12.320 --> 16:15.840]  The problem is there's so many attacks going on right now.
[16:15.840 --> 16:18.000]  They're ending that neutrality as we know it.
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.080]  That's now officially moving forward.
[16:20.080 --> 16:22.520]  Over command coming in with backdoors, everything.
[16:22.520 --> 16:26.000]  They're launching worms against the Internet to force you onto the new Internet that has
[16:26.000 --> 16:32.040]  Internet ID, three strikes by an unelected group and your bans from the Internet.
[16:32.040 --> 16:39.040]  Just sending in bureaucrats to basically arrest Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, Joseph Farah.
[16:39.040 --> 16:44.920]  And by the way, it's in the news today that 10% of the Tea Party donors were audited by
[16:44.920 --> 16:45.920]  the IRS.
[16:45.920 --> 16:52.440]  If you do a Tea Party candidate, if you gave to a Tea Party group, a pro-gun group, whatever,
[16:52.440 --> 16:58.120]  they criminally have that data and then they come after you and audit you.
[16:58.120 --> 16:59.280]  Well, so what?
[16:59.280 --> 17:01.000]  They're going to put you in a FEMA camp next.
[17:01.000 --> 17:06.840]  This is meant to be a chilling effect so that you won't give money to the Tea Party that
[17:06.840 --> 17:11.160]  the Republican and Democratic leadership have lined up together to destroy because it's
[17:11.160 --> 17:14.080]  not perfect, but it's the only opposition.
[17:14.080 --> 17:17.760]  Most Republicans find 10% of Tea Party donors audited by IRS.
[17:17.760 --> 17:20.880]  I mean, this makes Nixon look like an angel cake.
[17:20.880 --> 17:23.880]  He had 100 and something names and was breaking into a few offices.
[17:23.880 --> 17:24.880]  I'm not defending it.
[17:24.880 --> 17:27.320]  He should have resigned.
[17:27.320 --> 17:33.320]  This is tens of thousands of people being audited and harassed and they're 501c3 taken
[17:33.320 --> 17:35.200]  and pro-life groups and it's on record.
[17:35.200 --> 17:39.800]  They told pro-life groups in federal court, you will not be pro-life.
[17:39.800 --> 17:41.240]  That's political.
[17:41.240 --> 17:47.120]  You can keep your 501c3, just don't go out and protest at abortion clinics.
[17:47.120 --> 17:48.760]  What?
[17:48.760 --> 17:54.680]  That's an advocacy, but media matters publicly run by George Soros and the White House, funded
[17:54.680 --> 17:59.560]  by Soros, run by the White House, can literally say our job is to infiltrate, destroy new
[17:59.560 --> 18:04.080]  media, our job is to shut down free speech, our job is to get Democrats elected.
[18:04.080 --> 18:06.280]  We don't apologize.
[18:06.280 --> 18:08.440]  And they say that on CNN.
[18:08.440 --> 18:10.920]  Last week, we played the clip.
[18:10.920 --> 18:21.720]  I mean, this is a naked rush to the finish line by the globalist in our face.
[18:21.720 --> 18:27.880]  And now they have held lowest learner in contempt, the House representatives held former Internal
[18:27.880 --> 18:32.000]  Revenue Service official, not servant, lowest learner in contempt of Congress.
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.040]  We're going to get into that and more.
[18:36.040 --> 18:38.160]  But the issue is it's now reach survival mode.
[18:38.160 --> 18:39.240]  We punish these people.
[18:39.240 --> 18:40.240]  We back them off.
[18:40.240 --> 18:42.680]  We scare criminals in government.
[18:42.680 --> 18:46.080]  We give support to good whistleblowers and good people in government or it's over.
[18:46.080 --> 18:48.840]  The whole thing is going to collapse into total evil.
[18:48.840 --> 18:50.880]  So we've got that coming up with Bruce Fine.
[18:50.880 --> 18:58.080]  Now that said, that said, ladies and gentlemen, this is escalating very quickly.
[18:58.080 --> 19:01.880]  You know, I said that Putin yesterday announced, I read from the New York Times, was also on
[19:01.880 --> 19:02.880]  Novostat.
[19:02.880 --> 19:05.480]  I'm just believe the New York Times because they'll lie.
[19:05.480 --> 19:11.680]  Putin said we're pulling our troops off the border and we are not going to, we don't want
[19:11.680 --> 19:14.800]  referendums for different cities to try to join Russia, even though they've been part
[19:14.800 --> 19:16.480]  of Russia previously.
[19:16.480 --> 19:17.480]  We want to put that on hold.
[19:17.480 --> 19:19.600]  So that was a major attempt at reset.
[19:19.600 --> 19:24.200]  Someone can say it's a faint and that it's about Putin acting like he's involved in
[19:24.200 --> 19:26.680]  Daytona as a propaganda victory.
[19:26.680 --> 19:33.200]  That's what the CIA run by foreign banks and CNN is saying and MSNBC.
[19:33.200 --> 19:38.040]  The truth is, it's probably a little bit of both, it's an attempt to reset, but the troops
[19:38.040 --> 19:39.040]  have always been on the border.
[19:39.040 --> 19:43.120]  That's where their main military bases are, they invade Europe to begin with, been like
[19:43.120 --> 19:45.280]  that since the Cold War.
[19:45.280 --> 19:50.040]  But now Britain deploys destroyer to shadow Russian aircraft carrier.
[19:50.040 --> 19:57.200]  Putin oversees Russian nuclear forces exercises and tomorrow is the big World War II victory
[19:57.200 --> 20:04.200]  day and Putin may launch something after that.

[21:58.480 --> 22:01.240]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[22:01.240 --> 22:06.720]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at my Patreon supply.
[22:06.720 --> 22:10.040]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the
[22:10.040 --> 22:14.160]  direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick
[22:14.160 --> 22:15.160]  buck.
[22:15.160 --> 22:19.080]  To take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[22:19.080 --> 22:23.080]  My Patreon supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[22:23.080 --> 22:28.360]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men
[22:28.360 --> 22:29.360]  and women.
[22:29.360 --> 22:33.680]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach and that's why I stock my
[22:33.680 --> 22:37.560]  pantry with high quality storable foods for my Patreon supply.

[22:58.600 --> 23:02.440]  Positive results from satisfied customers of Heart and Body Extract continue to pour
[23:02.440 --> 23:05.520]  into our website, HBextract.com.
[23:05.520 --> 23:09.400]  This is Al from New Jersey, one day I saw your ad for Heart and Body Extract and it
[23:09.400 --> 23:12.760]  mentioned that it would help me with angina, so I decided to order.
[23:12.760 --> 23:14.720]  I figure I had nothing to lose.

[23:18.920 --> 23:23.880]  and maintain optimal heart and circulatory health with no negative side effects.
[23:23.880 --> 23:28.880]  I took the formula three times a day as directed and I kid you not, within four days my angina
[23:28.880 --> 23:30.840]  pain was completely gone.
[23:30.840 --> 23:38.760]  Order HBextract by calling 866-295-5305 or online at HBextract.com.
[23:38.760 --> 23:49.360]  I could not believe it actually stopped the pain, Heart and Body Extract actually works.
[23:49.360 --> 23:54.240]  This is just an amazing product, even the numbness in my hands is completely gone.
[23:54.240 --> 24:20.240]  Heart and Body Extract for a long and healthy life.
[24:20.240 --> 24:46.240]  First he's in the back, now he's in the front.
[24:46.240 --> 25:02.840]  Yeah, sometimes they give Satan a Nobel Peace Prize, Henry Kissinger, what a joke, didn't
[25:02.840 --> 25:06.240]  they give Al Gore one too for all of his baloney?
[25:06.240 --> 25:10.760]  Yeah, Harvard will host the reenactment of the Satanic Mass, that's a little interesting
[25:10.760 --> 25:13.480]  news tidbit that's coming up.
[25:13.480 --> 25:19.600]  By the way, I want to spend some time on this DrudgeReport.com, linked to it last night
[25:19.600 --> 25:24.480]  and then it was up till this morning and you know, scrolled off the page but I've had it
[25:24.480 --> 25:31.640]  reposted up on the front page of infowars.com and the headline is NSA to control the stock
[25:31.640 --> 25:36.760]  market and what I did is when I got up this morning, Kit Daniels wrote a little story
[25:36.760 --> 25:41.080]  about my interview with Porter Stansbury where I quantified what he was talking about and
[25:41.080 --> 25:46.120]  basically said it's the NSA takeover of the stock market and I saw a few of the commenters
[25:46.120 --> 25:48.840]  in the article going, come on, this isn't true.
[25:48.840 --> 25:55.440]  So I knew radically had Paul Watson at about 6 a.m. this morning when I got up add about
[25:55.440 --> 26:01.880]  10 links or so from mainstream news admitting that the NSA is already spying on the stock
[26:01.880 --> 26:05.600]  market in real time and giving the data to select interest.
[26:05.600 --> 26:21.440]  So I had the guys print one, two, three, four, five mainstream news articles saying what
[26:21.440 --> 26:26.880]  I'm saying because when I just get up here and say the NSA is spying on the stock market
[26:26.880 --> 26:33.880]  to manipulate it and then move on, I'm pulling from a big well of knowledge studying this
[26:33.880 --> 26:36.600]  for years and I'm not tuning my horn.
[26:36.600 --> 26:43.800]  I was the first person on US talk radio to have NSA whistleblowers on in 96, 97, 98,
[26:43.800 --> 26:45.360]  99, 2000.
[26:45.360 --> 26:49.080]  Nobody was having Wayne Madsen on.
[26:49.080 --> 26:53.560]  Nobody was having James Bamford on, former head of Nightline.
[26:53.560 --> 26:56.040]  Nobody was having these people on.
[26:56.040 --> 27:00.800]  I'm not bragging, I thought it was incredibly interesting that they were testifying to the
[27:00.800 --> 27:05.880]  British parliament and to the EU parliament and that they were testifying that were giant
[27:05.880 --> 27:10.760]  hubs being built in all the telecoms to track everything in real time.
[27:10.760 --> 27:13.120]  I thought that was a big deal.
[27:13.120 --> 27:16.720]  And then seven years ago, the AT&T executive went public.
[27:16.720 --> 27:20.480]  Well, I'm going to talk about this after I get into the World War three situation with
[27:20.480 --> 27:25.880]  Russia that just continues to go through new nightmare permutations and so I shouldn't
[27:25.880 --> 27:26.880]  get into it now.
[27:26.880 --> 27:28.720]  I'll get into it then.
[27:28.720 --> 27:32.800]  But the point is, that'll be about 15 minutes or so, I'll cover this.
[27:32.800 --> 27:36.280]  This ties in to censoring the internet, controlling it, taxing it.
[27:36.280 --> 27:41.000]  The power to tax, selectively, is the power to destroy.
[27:41.000 --> 27:46.200]  They have to surveil everything that know what's going on to target it with algorithms.
[27:46.200 --> 27:48.800]  You say, well, government's too inept to ever track everybody.
[27:48.800 --> 27:51.920]  They've been too inept until now.
[27:51.920 --> 27:56.640]  When everything is through the digital grid, they're going to enforce with computers.
[27:56.640 --> 27:58.320]  And that's been announced.
[27:58.320 --> 28:00.880]  That's in the news.
[28:00.880 --> 28:05.520]  They say in the press release, this new algorithm surveilling everything you do with your bank
[28:05.520 --> 28:10.120]  account, everything you do with cash off the digital numbers that are on all the new money.
[28:10.120 --> 28:13.040]  It's really just a receipt of digital.
[28:13.040 --> 28:16.080]  Will give them an accurate model of everything going on.
[28:16.080 --> 28:19.240]  And then they'll launder the drug money, that'll all be ignored.
[28:19.240 --> 28:25.000]  But then if you don't pay taxes on swap meat money you made, that you're using to survive
[28:25.000 --> 28:28.320]  in the underground economy, you're going to go to jail.
[28:28.320 --> 28:31.240]  The illegals are going to be above the law and be given back accounts and everything
[28:31.240 --> 28:32.240]  else.
[28:32.240 --> 28:33.240]  See, I'm already getting into it.
[28:33.240 --> 28:36.320]  This is the ultimate mark of the beast system.
[28:36.320 --> 28:39.360]  If the devil isn't real, it doesn't matter.
[28:39.360 --> 28:42.240]  They've taken that system and are building it.
[28:42.240 --> 28:49.240]  I mean, let's say in a hundred years they have the technology to build a giant biological
[28:49.240 --> 28:56.280]  android of Godzilla and they have it attack Tokyo, Godzilla's real.
[28:56.280 --> 28:59.960]  Godzilla's a fiction character, folks, but lots of stuff that's been fiction, people
[28:59.960 --> 29:01.640]  pick up on and build.
[29:01.640 --> 29:05.160]  Humans are master builders.
[29:05.160 --> 29:09.240]  And I'm not saying they're going to build a real Godzilla like Cloverleaf or Cloverfield,
[29:09.240 --> 29:13.000]  whatever that horror movie is, it's pretty good, Cloverfield.
[29:13.000 --> 29:18.400]  The point is, is that that's the concept I'm talking about here.
[29:18.400 --> 29:23.520]  In 1855, they envisioned the total eugenics takeover of the planet in London and they
[29:23.520 --> 29:26.240]  pretty much done it.
[29:26.240 --> 29:29.000]  And it was all on the drawing board then.
[29:29.000 --> 29:39.200]  In 1900, H.G. Wells wrote a book about atomic weapons with allusions he alluded to the Max
[29:39.200 --> 29:45.240]  Plank equation, I suppose before it was even published, see, see, they're more advanced
[29:45.240 --> 29:48.800]  than they're telling us, we'll be right back.
[29:48.800 --> 29:52.520]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[29:52.520 --> 29:55.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:55.520 --> 30:05.240]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential
[30:05.240 --> 30:06.240]  forward to a situation?
[30:06.240 --> 30:11.240]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[30:11.240 --> 30:15.200]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news.
[30:15.200 --> 30:17.440]  And for wars, is the tip of the spear.
[30:17.440 --> 30:21.120]  Is this another false-flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeland
[30:21.120 --> 30:23.720]  security by sticking the hands down on the fence on the streets?
[30:23.720 --> 30:27.680]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[30:27.680 --> 30:30.720]  And that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[30:30.720 --> 30:36.720]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons

[31:04.480 --> 31:07.520]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[31:07.520 --> 31:13.160]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[31:13.160 --> 31:15.120]  It all comes down to one thing.
[31:15.120 --> 31:16.740]  We are what we eat.
[31:16.740 --> 31:21.400]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[31:21.400 --> 31:25.640]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.

[31:59.640 --> 32:03.680]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[32:03.680 --> 32:08.240]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate.
[32:08.240 --> 32:11.840]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[32:11.840 --> 32:14.800]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[32:14.800 --> 32:18.680]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[32:18.680 --> 32:22.400]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[32:22.400 --> 32:26.320]  On average the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[32:26.320 --> 32:30.880]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[32:30.880 --> 32:36.160]  Proof pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[32:36.160 --> 32:40.320]  Fluoride is in teats and coffins and waters and breads and toothpaste.
[32:40.320 --> 32:43.400]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[32:43.400 --> 32:44.960]  The establishment is not going to do it.
[32:44.960 --> 32:46.320]  It's time to take action.

[33:10.440 --> 33:14.120]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones.
[33:14.120 --> 33:29.280]  It's the time of the season when love runs high, in this time, give it to me easy.
[33:29.280 --> 33:38.720]  So coming up, I'm going to get into our report, NSA to Control Stock Market.
[33:38.720 --> 33:42.400]  And Drudge Drifely put a question mark on our original article because it had some links
[33:42.400 --> 33:48.520]  to it in my statements that that's what this is, but when I say NSA, that's a gestalt,
[33:48.520 --> 33:53.640]  the NSA is part of it, of the overall grid that I'm going to describe coming up after
[33:53.640 --> 33:56.320]  I get into our top stories here.
[33:56.320 --> 34:01.080]  And again, we'll get more into Russia in the next hour when former State Department official
[34:01.080 --> 34:06.640]  and also whistleblower Peter Van Buren joins us.
[34:06.640 --> 34:11.920]  He helped basically run operations in Iraq, wrote a book saying, you know, that it was
[34:11.920 --> 34:13.440]  basically a fraud.
[34:13.440 --> 34:15.880]  They tried to prosecute him basically and run him out.
[34:15.880 --> 34:23.640]  He successfully defeated that, being represented by the same group that represents Mr. Snowden.
[34:23.640 --> 34:27.720]  So he'll be coming on to give us his take on the Ukraine situation.
[34:27.720 --> 34:33.320]  And I didn't really know Ray McGovern, former CIA analyst, a high-level advisor to Ronald
[34:33.320 --> 34:34.560]  Reagan and George Edward Walker Bush.
[34:34.560 --> 34:39.360]  He gave them their morning briefings, so about a high-as-level analyst as it gets.
[34:39.360 --> 34:45.240]  And of course, combat veteran Vietnam, I mean, really a smart guy who's moral, who can, you
[34:45.240 --> 34:49.760]  know, tell you 9-11's an inside job and who will really talk about the real world.
[34:49.760 --> 34:53.760]  He is sick today, so couldn't come on, but I want to get him on next week as soon as
[34:53.760 --> 34:54.760]  we can.
[34:54.760 --> 34:59.640]  We appreciate him helping line up Peter Van Buren for us coming up.
[34:59.640 --> 35:05.320]  He's going to be with us for 30 minutes in the next hour, maybe longer to give us his
[35:05.320 --> 35:06.320]  different angle.
[35:06.320 --> 35:08.520]  Again, I don't even know his perspective yet.
[35:08.520 --> 35:14.040]  I just know these are moral people who put out really thoughtful analysis, so it's just
[35:14.040 --> 35:15.640]  like we get Joel Scowzen on.
[35:15.640 --> 35:17.880]  Doesn't mean I totally agree with his analysis on Russia.
[35:17.880 --> 35:21.000]  I think it has a lot of pertinent points, though.
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.280]  The truth is a lot of these things are fluid, and these conflicts are real at the grassroots
[35:25.280 --> 35:26.280]  level.
[35:26.280 --> 35:28.840]  They're even real at the Putin level or the Obama level.
[35:28.840 --> 35:33.520]  But above that, there's the globalist forces, as John Perkins, the economic hitman, will
[35:33.520 --> 35:34.520]  tell you.
[35:34.520 --> 35:39.040]  He's the insider, where there's the forces that play people off against each other, countries'
[35:39.040 --> 35:43.200]  religions, to gain power.
[35:43.200 --> 35:46.960]  So that's what it's really all about.
[35:46.960 --> 35:53.240]  The situation on the Russia front is very complex.
[35:53.240 --> 35:58.720]  A lot of people say that Putin's announcement yesterday that they would pull Russian forces
[35:58.720 --> 36:02.880]  off the border, where they already reside at military bases that have been there for
[36:02.880 --> 36:08.920]  hundreds of years, Russia's had many of its wars in the Crimea, Ukraine area, obviously,
[36:08.920 --> 36:13.480]  and half the country's historically been part of Russia to begin with.
[36:13.480 --> 36:20.760]  But if you expand on that, it's been a big victory for NATO and the UN and the EU.
[36:20.760 --> 36:23.680]  When they overthrew the elected government, and instead the new government that overthrew
[36:23.680 --> 36:29.200]  it is duly elected, even though no election was held, much of the East began holding referendums
[36:29.200 --> 36:35.880]  trying to basically merge with Russia.
[36:35.880 --> 36:42.920]  And they launched paramilitary operations from the Western controlled, Western Ukraine,
[36:42.920 --> 36:48.600]  and we've all seen on the news, the videos of, I saw yesterday, watching CNN last night,
[36:48.600 --> 36:55.280]  masses of citizens unarmed, the Russian, Ukrainians, marching against tanks, holding them off,
[36:55.280 --> 37:05.360]  walking them like scenes from Tiananmen Square in 1989, and Ukrainians who were Russian-backed
[37:05.360 --> 37:10.320]  shooting down behind helicopters that the Ukrainians have when they fire missiles at
[37:10.320 --> 37:11.320]  them.
[37:11.320 --> 37:12.760]  So there's already a war going on there.
[37:12.760 --> 37:19.080]  There's a proxy war between the Global Crime Syndicate and the Russian system that's very
[37:19.080 --> 37:29.600]  seedy itself, obviously, in Syria, in Libya, in Ukraine, and in many other areas.
[37:29.600 --> 37:36.720]  And so now, basically, what's happening is, the West doesn't like being beaten in Syria.
[37:36.720 --> 37:42.640]  So they launched on a new front in Ukraine, and some can say, well, Russia's going to
[37:42.640 --> 37:46.600]  have its World War II victory day, that's the nation's biggest holiday, bigger than
[37:46.600 --> 37:47.600]  Christmas.
[37:47.600 --> 37:52.880]  It's hands down the biggest holiday, because millions of Russians died in World War II
[37:52.880 --> 37:59.600]  fighting Hitler, and the Battle of Stalingrad and the rest of it.
[37:59.600 --> 38:05.440]  So the word is, just like the Russians held off during the Olympics, launching a major
[38:05.440 --> 38:11.880]  counter assault, that Putin put out propaganda that, okay, we'll pull back, don't have a referendum,
[38:11.880 --> 38:18.020]  so they can have, the celebration starts tomorrow through the weekend, and that they can build
[38:18.020 --> 38:23.360]  up that national fervor, saw a poll last week that Russians are the happiest they've been
[38:23.360 --> 38:25.600]  in polls in the last 25 years.
[38:25.600 --> 38:31.080]  There's nothing like being attacked that unifies people, and that helps the Russian regime
[38:31.080 --> 38:35.080]  become more militaristic, more corrupt, which helps the globalists.
[38:35.080 --> 38:37.200]  They want to build up a new enemy.
[38:37.200 --> 38:42.840]  See how it helps the predators on both sides, so it's a very sad situation.
[38:42.840 --> 38:45.320]  But here are the headlines, the latest news.
[38:45.320 --> 38:49.040]  Putin oversees Russian nuclear forces' exercise.
[38:49.040 --> 38:55.680]  They drilled firing ICBMs at Europe, AP, President Vladimir Putin today, oversaw a military exercise
[38:55.680 --> 39:00.000]  involving Russia's nuclear forces, escalating tensions over Ukraine.
[39:00.000 --> 39:05.400]  Submarines popped up off the western, eastern U.S. coast, Russian aircraft carriers steamed
[39:05.400 --> 39:12.040]  right off the coast in the English Channel, British destroyers, U.K. destroyers, shadowed
[39:12.040 --> 39:19.480]  them, Russian bombers, practice bombing capitals, I mean, this is what's going on right now.
[39:19.480 --> 39:24.320]  President Vladimir Putin, again on Thursday, oversaw a military exercise involving Russia's
[39:24.320 --> 39:29.160]  nuclear forces, going back to the AP and escalating tensions over Ukraine.
[39:29.160 --> 39:34.840]  While Putin said the exercise had been planned back in November, it comes as relations between
[39:34.840 --> 39:39.320]  Russia and the West have plunged to their lowest point since the Cold War over Ukraine.
[39:39.320 --> 39:44.280]  Putin, speaking from the Defense Ministry headquarters where he oversaw the exercise,
[39:44.280 --> 39:50.160]  saw that with leaders of several ex-Soviet nations, which are members of the Collective
[39:50.160 --> 39:56.600]  Security Treaty Organization, that the Russians have set up with the former Russian-controlled
[39:56.600 --> 40:03.240]  territory, including the nation's nuclear forces, Russian newswires said that the exercises
[40:03.240 --> 40:09.800]  simulated dealing a massive retaliatory nuclear strike in response to any enemy attack.
[40:09.800 --> 40:15.520]  The description of the exercise is unusually blunt, reflecting tensions with the West running
[40:15.520 --> 40:16.520]  however Ukraine.
[40:16.520 --> 40:21.560]  Well, this is what Lavrov said and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of the Russian military
[40:21.560 --> 40:23.960]  said back in 2008.
[40:23.960 --> 40:27.920]  They said, NATO forces are landing, massing, you're attacking Russian-controlled ethnic
[40:27.920 --> 40:34.280]  areas in Ossetia and South Ossetia and Abkhazia, we will launch nuclear weapons on NATO military
[40:34.280 --> 40:40.480]  targets in one hour if you do not pull your troops out and reverse yourself.
[40:40.480 --> 40:44.640]  They rolled in mobile ICBMs and the West backed off.
[40:44.640 --> 40:51.800]  I mean, this is the type of brinksmanship that's going on and I know the globalists
[40:51.800 --> 40:55.560]  stand again out of this and are playing both sides and have interest in both governments,
[40:55.560 --> 41:03.480]  but this is real, folks, this is real and it's because the dollars on the edge of collapsing,
[41:03.480 --> 41:07.640]  global governance, the EU's on the verge of collapsing, the New World Order is on the
[41:07.640 --> 41:11.440]  verge of not making it.
[41:11.440 --> 41:16.800]  But the teachers in the schools and in the colleges and the preachers, they all tell
[41:16.800 --> 41:22.720]  everybody that world governments are foregone conclusion and that the New World Order can't
[41:22.720 --> 41:23.720]  be defeated.
[41:23.720 --> 41:28.000]  It's biblical, well, maybe it can't be defeated down the road, maybe it's prophecy, but I
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.240]  know that you can get a reprieve like Nineveh and so many other cases.
[41:32.240 --> 41:35.200]  All I know is God helps those that help themselves.
[41:35.200 --> 41:40.120]  I've been here in preachers since I was a little kid saying, you know, 1989 is the rapture,
[41:40.120 --> 41:46.320]  2011 is the rapture and they're just literally doing that to distract everybody and it's
[41:46.320 --> 41:51.920]  a big cop out and it's not the case, ladies and gentlemen, the Bible says no one knows
[41:51.920 --> 41:53.920]  the time.
[41:53.920 --> 41:57.680]  And then the Bible says the rapture happens after the Armageddon, I mean, it clearly a
[41:57.680 --> 42:00.480]  five-year-old could read that, but let's not debate that.
[42:00.480 --> 42:05.760]  I know that if Christians hide in the churches and don't go out and criticize abortion and
[42:05.760 --> 42:09.920]  don't go out and feed the homeless, that the evil will occupy.
[42:09.920 --> 42:11.720]  And the evil will occupy the churches.
[42:11.720 --> 42:15.760]  Some of the biggest engines of pharaceutical evil, as they were in Christ time, are the
[42:15.760 --> 42:18.760]  churches, are the temples.
[42:18.760 --> 42:24.840]  I mean, literally you go to mega churches, it is worship government, you know, divorce
[42:24.840 --> 42:27.360]  your husband if he doesn't give all the money to the church.
[42:27.360 --> 42:34.200]  I mean, these are cults, folks, evil, glitter bug cults, government run, state run, clergy
[42:34.200 --> 42:41.400]  response team, dens, if they're pushing Romans 13.
[42:41.400 --> 42:47.280]  As part of the maneuvers, a total intercontinental ballistic missile launched from a launch pad
[42:47.280 --> 42:53.360]  in northwestern Russia, successfully hit a designated target on the current testing range
[42:53.360 --> 43:00.680]  on the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, the military said, what is it, 4,000 miles away,
[43:00.680 --> 43:05.520]  that's how big Russia is, two nuclear submarines off northern and Pacific fleets, the Tula
[43:05.520 --> 43:11.360]  and the Poldoska, I'm pronouncing it right, also fired intercontinental ballistic missiles.
[43:11.360 --> 43:16.360]  So there you go, and the Russians said, if you attack us, we're going to launch nuclear
[43:16.360 --> 43:19.440]  missiles at you.
[43:19.440 --> 43:24.920]  And this is not top news, unless you go to infowars.com or places like drudgerport.com.
[43:24.920 --> 43:30.960]  I mean, the average person, I've got stacks of articles here, and we'll get into some
[43:30.960 --> 43:35.920]  of them with Democrat professors, Democrats in the media saying, arrest the Tea Party,
[43:35.920 --> 43:40.400]  of course we're auditing you, you should be arrested, you're racist.
[43:40.400 --> 43:44.880]  Take all the guns, put people in reeducation camps, take over, take over, take over.
[43:44.880 --> 43:52.600]  I mean, these people are howling, gibbering, authoritarian control freaks, telling us that
[43:52.600 --> 43:56.920]  they have the moral supremacy.
[43:56.920 --> 44:03.160]  And they're going to tell the Russians, let them eat cake, and start this whole thing.
[44:03.160 --> 44:10.520]  Well, everybody's busy watching the NBA, and drinking their scotch and waters.
[44:10.520 --> 44:15.160]  I know that's fun, and while women are busy, you know, running around with their girlfriends
[44:15.160 --> 44:20.200]  or whatever, literally World War III could happen.
[44:20.200 --> 44:25.840]  So here I am saying, the end of the world's not a foregone conclusion, but it could be
[44:25.840 --> 44:26.840]  coming.
[44:26.840 --> 44:31.080]  My point is, we need to not just sit here like spectators, as if we're just on this
[44:31.080 --> 44:36.560]  earth to only let evil people run things.
[44:36.560 --> 44:39.040]  So that's what's going on with the Russian situation.
[44:39.040 --> 44:42.120]  Here's some more of the background breaking today.
[44:42.120 --> 44:46.920]  Since I mentioned it, why not show you the actual articles?
[44:46.920 --> 44:53.400]  London Telegraph reports, aircraft carrier sales in English Channel, Moscow show explores
[44:53.400 --> 45:00.480]  Lenin Stalin, Britain deploys destroyer to shadow Russian aircraft carrier.
[45:00.480 --> 45:06.360]  In case the U.S. destroyers operating the Black Sea was not sufficiently clear of the
[45:06.360 --> 45:12.480]  Western approach to containing Russia, the latest naval news will hardly boost the de-escalation
[45:12.480 --> 45:13.720]  theme.
[45:13.720 --> 45:18.800]  Reuters reports that earlier today, Britain had deployed a destroyer to track a Russian
[45:18.800 --> 45:22.560]  aircraft carrier sailing close to its coastal waters.
[45:22.560 --> 45:27.640]  Then it goes on to break all of that down.
[45:27.640 --> 45:34.320]  Continuing, Ukraine says special op to continue, regardless of referendum decision.
[45:34.320 --> 45:40.040]  So they're trying to de-escalate by saying don't basically secede from Ukraine right
[45:40.040 --> 45:48.560]  now and the liberation duly elected government that wasn't elected, but Obama said it was
[45:48.560 --> 45:53.640]  so it was, maybe he'll suspend the laws of gravity because he said so.
[45:53.640 --> 45:56.360]  Maybe he'll say the NRA is the Klan when they were founded to fight the Klan.
[45:56.360 --> 45:59.080]  I mean, it really doesn't matter here.
[45:59.080 --> 46:04.120]  And so they're continuing to blow stuff up, kill people, shoot civilians, engage in purges
[46:04.120 --> 46:10.240]  of unarmed people and CNN says that it's just total liberation by an elected government.
[46:10.240 --> 46:14.960]  Doesn't matter if it's not true, they prey on their audience.
[46:14.960 --> 46:20.640]  Here comes Crimea 2.0, following referendum, East Ukraine votes to become part of Russia.
[46:20.640 --> 46:25.080]  Zero hedge, overseas.
[46:25.080 --> 46:29.760]  Private investment corporation gave 20 million dollar loan to Ukrainian poor dealership owned
[46:29.760 --> 46:33.000]  by Biden friend and donor.
[46:33.000 --> 46:38.120]  You know, that's how they launder out of Europe all this money in a democratic party.
[46:38.120 --> 46:42.680]  But then again, Republicans aren't even allowed to give money or you get audited, which is
[46:42.680 --> 46:43.680]  meant to be a chilling effect.
[46:43.680 --> 46:44.680]  Well, that's it.
[46:44.680 --> 46:49.600]  I'm going to start giving to Tea Party candidates as much as I can across the board.
[46:49.600 --> 46:50.600]  Okay.
[46:50.600 --> 46:51.600]  You want to audit me scum?
[46:51.600 --> 46:52.600]  Go ahead.
[46:52.600 --> 46:57.000]  I'm going to sue the IRS person that comes here personally and you may beat me in court,
[46:57.000 --> 47:01.680]  but I'm going to drag you through depositions and I'm going to put your name all over television
[47:01.680 --> 47:06.440]  and I'm going to sit here and be a cause celeb and openly have you persecute me because the
[47:06.440 --> 47:10.480]  answer to persecution is I'm going to sit at the front of the bus and you can arrest
[47:10.480 --> 47:17.120]  me if you want, but I'm going to persevere like Gandhi showing what you did or Martin
[47:17.120 --> 47:18.120]  Luther King.
[47:18.120 --> 47:22.000]  And that's the answer to these scumbags.
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.240]  That's the answer.
[47:26.240 --> 47:30.680]  When they do this, when they come out officially and go, I mean, I played the clips on them
[47:30.680 --> 47:31.680]  and said, let me see.
[47:31.680 --> 47:32.680]  They go, of course we're auditing you.
[47:32.680 --> 47:33.680]  You're criminals.
[47:33.680 --> 47:34.680]  You're racist.
[47:34.680 --> 47:36.160]  Of course we need to shut down the whole Tea Party.
[47:36.160 --> 47:38.640]  These people will throw us in jail if they can.
[47:38.640 --> 47:39.640]  You know it.
[47:39.640 --> 47:40.640]  I know it.
[47:40.640 --> 47:41.640]  We're here.
[47:41.640 --> 47:42.640]  They're criminals.
[47:42.640 --> 47:47.400]  They're howling, Stalinistic filth.
[47:47.400 --> 47:48.400]  They are apt.
[47:48.400 --> 47:50.160]  They know they're criminals.
[47:50.160 --> 47:51.920]  They know they're evil.
[47:51.920 --> 47:54.000]  They know they're pushing race division.
[47:54.000 --> 47:55.440]  They know they're lying.
[47:55.440 --> 47:57.000]  They're not liberals.
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.400]  They're enemy foreign bank agents.
[48:00.400 --> 48:02.280]  They are commandos.
[48:02.280 --> 48:09.520]  They pose in pink shirts and talk with Lisp to, that's what real spies act like, folks.
[48:09.520 --> 48:14.820]  They are in mechanized crews on record.
[48:14.820 --> 48:16.680]  They literally have commanding officers.
[48:16.680 --> 48:18.920]  Do you understand that?
[48:18.920 --> 48:28.120]  Rachel Maddow, all those people, the people on CNN, Anderson Cooper, openly works for
[48:28.120 --> 48:36.000]  the CIA and reportedly has been high-level regional manager of media operations in New
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.520]  York for the CIA.
[48:38.520 --> 48:44.720]  He is a black op commander to destroy you and your family and deliver this country into
[48:44.720 --> 48:45.720]  hell.
[48:45.720 --> 48:48.120]  They are sworn to take everything you've got.
[48:48.120 --> 48:50.400]  They are sworn to shut this country down.
[48:50.400 --> 48:55.280]  They are collaborator enemy officers like VC French in occupied France.
[48:55.280 --> 48:56.960]  That isn't rhetoric.
[48:56.960 --> 49:01.360]  That's 100% truth.
[49:01.360 --> 49:07.560]  I told you years ago, Al Sharpton's FBI, I know their MO, the cut of their suit, their
[49:07.560 --> 49:11.720]  nomenclature, their modus operandi.
[49:11.720 --> 49:13.080]  I fight the enemy.
[49:13.080 --> 49:15.400]  I eat, drink and sleep the enemy.
[49:15.400 --> 49:19.240]  I know the enemy.
[49:19.240 --> 49:22.120]  You must learn the enemy.
[49:22.120 --> 49:24.240]  You must see them as an enemy.
[49:24.240 --> 49:26.080]  They are sworn to take us down.
[49:26.080 --> 49:28.040]  They are sworn to deliver us into slavery.
[49:28.040 --> 49:29.400]  They will never stop.
[49:29.400 --> 49:33.720]  They will start World War III to burn this country to the ground.
[49:33.720 --> 49:36.600]  They want Russia to nuke this country.
[49:36.600 --> 49:40.320]  As top analysts have told you, they hate this nation.
[49:40.320 --> 49:47.080]  Their mission is to hurt good people, just like they've burned Libya to the ground and
[49:47.080 --> 49:54.080]  Syria to the ground, mainstream news today reporting, BBC, Syrian conflict, huge blast
[49:54.080 --> 50:01.280]  destroys a hotel, U.S. created a terrorist safe haven in Libya, a new government report.
[50:01.280 --> 50:04.080]  It's not the U.S., it's Specter.
[50:04.080 --> 50:09.480]  Briefly, if you like what you hear here and you want to hear more of it, you want to fund
[50:09.480 --> 50:15.600]  as fuel in this missile system so we can continue to crush the enemy, then buy the products

[52:02.600 --> 52:07.720]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year.
[52:07.720 --> 52:13.920]  Burglars call it smash and grab, police call it robbery, we call it avoidable.
[52:13.920 --> 52:20.040]  We are FAKE TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[52:20.040 --> 52:25.360]  FAKE TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[52:25.360 --> 52:29.960]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move

[53:13.200 --> 53:15.200]  and duration of common colds.
[53:15.200 --> 53:20.120]  Allicin Plus C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized Allicin, the active ingredient
[53:20.120 --> 53:21.400]  in crushed garlic.

[53:54.720 --> 54:20.400]  And Allicin Plus C from Affinity Health Products.
[54:20.400 --> 54:23.240]  Let me get into this now since I mentioned it and I'm going to give you the news articles
[54:23.240 --> 54:25.120]  where you can go read it.
[54:25.120 --> 54:33.160]  Again, we put the story out yesterday at mfolwars.com, NSA to control the stock market is the headline
[54:33.160 --> 54:38.680]  and we'll show everybody a document cam shot of that particular article if you're watching
[54:38.680 --> 54:41.600]  us on television.
[54:41.600 --> 54:45.560]  And that's a bold claim and the video that we linked to it is just where I'm talking
[54:45.560 --> 54:48.680]  about it, giving a few examples and drugs linked to it.
[54:48.680 --> 54:51.120]  And we gave examples in the article.
[54:51.120 --> 54:53.920]  And a few people in the comments were like, oh, where's the proof?
[54:53.920 --> 54:56.400]  Well, it's in the links.
[54:56.400 --> 55:02.360]  And to say the NSA controls the stock market is, you know, quite frankly, not even deep
[55:02.360 --> 55:03.360]  enough.
[55:03.360 --> 55:05.920]  It is special interest that do it.
[55:05.920 --> 55:09.520]  So let me back up what we were saying.
[55:09.520 --> 55:10.520]  Here it is.
[55:10.520 --> 55:12.400]  This is Money Beat Wall Street Journal.
[55:12.400 --> 55:15.560]  Get ready for regulators to peer into your portfolio.
[55:15.560 --> 55:18.680]  And then we read the document a few days ago on air where they said they already peer into
[55:18.680 --> 55:21.000]  90% of the stock market portfolios.
[55:21.000 --> 55:25.840]  Now the other 10% of small time traders, you will be peered at, you will be watched in
[55:25.840 --> 55:31.680]  live time, and then that's fed back in to the government computers with a government
[55:31.680 --> 55:38.680]  algorithm with private regulators with governmental power like the Federal Reserve.
[55:38.680 --> 55:43.080]  So when I say NSA, it's Google, it's Microsoft, it's the government systems, it's Cyber
[55:43.080 --> 55:48.080]  Command, all of those fed in, but the public doesn't understand what that is yet.
[55:48.080 --> 55:52.200]  It's like, say, the NSA.
[55:52.200 --> 55:54.880]  It's like saying Nazi Germany.
[55:54.880 --> 55:59.120]  And then there's all the characters and all the groups that are within the term Nazi Germany.
[55:59.120 --> 56:06.520]  The average person doesn't know who Hermann Göring is or Heinrich Himmler or Zeb Dietrich
[56:06.520 --> 56:11.520]  or no, they just know that Nazi Germany existed sometime.
[56:11.520 --> 56:17.520]  This is a whole governmental corporate takeover of all data to fix all markets, to predict
[56:17.520 --> 56:24.760]  the future, just like CIA run, they're now admitting Amazon with CIA servers inside
[56:24.760 --> 56:29.080]  their system can now predict what you're going to order before you order it and already
[56:29.080 --> 56:31.680]  have it packaged and ready when you order it.
[56:31.680 --> 56:35.280]  Again, I told you that before it was even admitted.
[56:35.280 --> 56:37.720]  That's the holy grail, ladies and gentlemen.
[56:37.720 --> 56:42.720]  I was told this by former NSA people and top telecom engineers, you know, guys driving
[56:42.720 --> 56:49.920]  Bentley's engineers that hold the patents, people like that, that this was the plan.
[56:49.920 --> 56:55.360]  I was told this 15, 16, 17 years ago and didn't even know if I could believe it, that Alex,
[56:55.360 --> 56:56.860]  it's about predicting the future.
[56:56.860 --> 56:58.440]  It's about controlling the future.
[56:58.440 --> 57:01.320]  Have you read Isaac Asimov's foundation?
[57:01.320 --> 57:02.440]  And I said, yes, sir.
[57:02.440 --> 57:04.880]  And they said, read it again.
[57:04.880 --> 57:08.840]  It was a plan.
[57:08.840 --> 57:14.480]  A computer system that predicts the future to then control the future, so it's way beyond
[57:14.480 --> 57:15.480]  that.
[57:15.480 --> 57:16.480]  Now, let me go over these articles.
[57:16.480 --> 57:20.120]  Get ready for regulators to peer into your portfolio.
[57:20.120 --> 57:21.120]  Wall Street Journal.
[57:21.120 --> 57:22.120]  Here's another one.
[57:22.120 --> 57:23.120]  This is more important.
[57:23.120 --> 57:24.120]  Wall Street Journal.
[57:24.120 --> 57:25.120]  Again, futures traders sues CME.
[57:25.120 --> 57:26.440]  That's the grip that runs this.
[57:26.440 --> 57:32.080]  Over real time data, suit alleges high frequency traders got data ahead of other customers.
[57:32.080 --> 57:36.120]  Like I said with Porter in the video, but now I'm backing it up.
[57:36.120 --> 57:37.120]  And it's come out in court.
[57:37.120 --> 57:38.120]  This is what's going on.
[57:38.120 --> 57:43.720]  CME was giving the data to high frequency trader Goldman Sachs to put the data in to
[57:43.720 --> 57:46.120]  rig it to follow the trends.
[57:46.120 --> 57:49.000]  The NSA is Goldman Sachs.
[57:49.000 --> 57:51.520]  It sits at the top of the pyramid.
[57:51.520 --> 57:56.600]  Do you understand this is all a plan, boys and girls?
[57:56.600 --> 57:57.600]  Here's another one.
[57:57.600 --> 57:58.600]  High frequency trading.
[57:58.600 --> 58:04.000]  Enough to get Goldman Sachs preaching financial probity.
[58:04.000 --> 58:05.360]  That's the London Guardian.
[58:05.360 --> 58:06.560]  Here's another one.
[58:06.560 --> 58:08.440]  Here's the Fed manipulating the stock market.
[58:08.440 --> 58:11.160]  They're going to say, yes, they are a plunge protection team.
[58:11.160 --> 58:12.160]  Here's another one.
[58:12.160 --> 58:13.160]  Government using NASA.
[58:13.160 --> 58:18.920]  I mean, NSA to change amount in bank accounts warns panel.
[58:18.920 --> 58:24.640]  Governmental panel says that there, when you see your bank account go up or down suddenly,
[58:24.640 --> 58:28.400]  they're taking your money for a few hours, doing it to millions of people and manipulating
[58:28.400 --> 58:29.400]  it.
[58:29.400 --> 58:30.400]  It's a total manipulation.
[58:30.400 --> 58:33.760]  NSA already controls the stock market.
[58:33.760 --> 58:34.760]  NSA.
[58:34.760 --> 58:35.760]  NSA.
[58:35.760 --> 58:36.760]  You got it?
[58:36.760 --> 58:42.560]  It's a total takeover reality, total fixed markets, total fraud, total oligarchy to bankrupt
[58:42.560 --> 58:44.560]  you and shut you down.
[58:44.560 --> 58:49.560]  It's siege economic warfare.
[58:49.560 --> 58:53.040]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide.
[58:53.040 --> 58:58.640]  I'll also enjoy what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[58:58.640 --> 59:02.720]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern

[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:09.200]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.200]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.200]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:39.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:47.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you go up to infowars.com right now, you will see the headline NSA to
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:52.280]  control the stock market spy agency can easily manipulate the market through latest surveillance
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.880]  hub and they've been caught doing it before.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:58.680]  See, our headline isn't hardcore enough.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:03.240]  They are doing it and they're doing it to totally cheat you and make sure no independent
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:07.280]  wealth can be developed that they don't control as an act of total domination.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.680]  We have the video where I talk about it.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.000]  We prove it in the article.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.560]  Future Trader Sue CME over real-time data.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:19.560]  Wall Street Journal.
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.000]  Get ready for regulators appear into your portfolio.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.560]  Okay, and then we go through all the data of how it's going on.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:32.160]  And then earlier last segment, I broke down the larger system and the truth is Goldman
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.320]  Sachs was set up as a foundation of futurist.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:42.560]  Look it up to take control of the political process of the U.S.
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:47.960]  And that's why Goldman Sachs with JP Morgan Chase funding it sits at the top of the managerial
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:52.920]  global pyramid along with Rockefeller and Rothschild interest, but it's basically the
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.920]  same institution.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.640]  And they are eugenical.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.040]  They are eugenics based.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:06.600]  And I'm just giving you hiding in plain view the absolute keys to how everything works.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:11.240]  And I'm just here, emergency beacon giving you the data, the emergency transmission.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.520]  Here's the globalist.
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.000]  Here's their plan.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.800]  Here's their books where they admit, you know, eco science where they're putting flour
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.480]  on the water to lower your fertility and brain damage you.
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:28.080]  You're literally being stunned like a wasp will stun a spider before it eats it.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.520]  Or a spider will stun its prey before it eats it.
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.880]  I mean, we are literally rolling around our back right now while the globalists watch
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.880]  us.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:42.240]  In fact, you guys printed me yesterday, the beginning of H.G. Wells war of the worlds.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:47.760]  I want to read that because, you know, in the years of the 20th century, no one knew the
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:51.960]  earth was being studied and watched like a scientist would study amoebas in a Petri
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.480]  dish by a cold calculating intelligence.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:02.160]  And he admitted in his nonfiction books that was an allegory of the elite against us.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.320]  And the whole thing was an allegory.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:08.000]  He also wrote the book things to come and then a movie out of it, one of the first big
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.360]  science fiction epics where stealth bombers go around bombing the America that won't turn
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:19.000]  its nukes in to finally set up world government.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:27.280]  In fact, we had somebody entered into the contest, a video contest, one of those paralleling
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:36.240]  my shelf and H.G. Wells and where I'm the dictator, but the socialist with the with
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:41.040]  the bat wing fighters are attacking.
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.520]  It's just incredibly sophisticated.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:47.720]  I mean, I cannot believe they came up with all this stuff like 170 years ago and we are
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:54.160]  here living in their world, literally living in a proto matrix they're inserting us into
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:04:05.240]  and even some of the greatest minds out there cannot fully get all this.
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:09.280]  I don't know if that's the video, you know, David Knight did a report on it.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.720]  He knows which one it is.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:16.680]  Get that and we'll play it after we play when the guest leaves us later in the hour.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:22.240]  After we get into the amazing exchange in Congress from the head of the Federal Reserve
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:28.840]  Yellen and Senator Bernie Sanders about oligarchy, that's coming up, we'll we'll get into that
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:33.680]  because it's so important on this Thursday edition.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:39.800]  And then we have another guest that's going to be joining us, Bruce Fine, the guy that
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:44.560]  is more responsible than anybody for the free speech we've got in this country right now.
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:50.200]  They depict one person whose initiatives have devastated the globalist.
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:55.640]  It shows how things that don't get saluted at the time end up absolutely changing the
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.640]  world.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.880]  He'll be joining us.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:04.760]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding,
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.000]  making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.240]  All the major networks are state-run.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.880]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:17.200]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:20.360]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:24.560]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.960]  kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:32.280]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.080]  We are the true media.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.800]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.760]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:04.840]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:10.320]  the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.360]  That's what else is in the halogen family.
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:13.360]  Fluoride.
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:14.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:20.640]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:21.640]  iodine.
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:26.840]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record.
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:32.080]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.080]  in iodine.
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.280]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:41.760]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:47.280]  You will find survival shield nascent iodine exclusively at infowarslife.com.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:52.080]  Infowars life, survival shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.560]  I take it every day.
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:59.440]  That's infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:04.160]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.240]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:12.800]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.760]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.360]  We are what we eat.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:21.040]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:25.240]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.840]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:32.720]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.040]  desperately needs.

[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:05.800]  No one would have believed in the last years of the 19th century that human affairs were
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:09.600]  being watched from the timeless worlds of space.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:14.640]  No one could have dreamed we were being scrutinized as someone with a microscope studies creatures
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:18.320]  that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:22.400]  Few men even consider the possibility of life on other planets.
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:29.680]  And yet, across the gulf of space, minds immeasurably superior to ours regard that this earth with
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:37.480]  envious eyes and slowly and surely, they drew their plans against us.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:48.720]  And that's HG Wells as many psychopaths control freaks like to do, lording it over you that
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:56.840]  they are basically their own species of super elite, the equivalent of aliens who are scientifically
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:01.680]  setting up their technological technocracy.
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:07.160]  Their future predicting NSA global Google control grid that they now brag they have
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:12.560]  in place as they prepare to ascend to Godhood merging with the machines, as Ray Kurzweil
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.560]  had said.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:17.680]  I don't know if that's going to really happen, but I know that's their plan and as Bill
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:24.360]  Joy wrote in 1999 in Wired Magazine why the future doesn't need us in the April issue,
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:29.400]  the elites have made the decision to transcend humanity and to reduce our population by more
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:35.720]  than 90% and they've made the decision to accelerate as they see it our evolution into
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:40.480]  the new super sapien.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:45.600]  They the Morlocks by some twist of fate ruled over us the Eloi.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:51.280]  And I guess we do act like stunted Eloi, very childlike being fed on by these people that
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:56.880]  study how humans operate and use psychology against us.
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:04.000]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday worldwide
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.500]  broadcast.
[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:08.440]  We're going to be getting our guests on in Skype here in a moment or we'll go to phone
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:20.320]  if not the next minute to give us their take on Putin overseas nuclear exercises firing
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:26.760]  dummy ICBMs from submarines and land bases saying they are prepared to strike the West
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:31.680]  if there are any attacks on their interest, including Russian populations in Ukraine.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.760]  And that is on the Associated Press at infowars.com right now.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.880]  I read the full quotes last hour.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:45.080]  I suggest you go read what they're saying.
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:49.280]  Putin's come out and said there's growing Nazi ideology in Europe fueling the EU that
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.120]  is what's behind it.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:56.800]  And strangely enough, the deputy prime minister of the new leader is an open Nazi in Ukraine
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:00.840]  and that is who overthrew the government that Obama calls newly elected.
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.040]  I mean, it is a twilight zone level event.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.280]  I don't romanticize the Russians either.
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:14.920]  But the big issue is, are the Russians going to launch some type of counterattack to the
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:21.360]  building Ukrainian forces after they celebrate World War II victory day tomorrow through
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.860]  the weekend?
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:28.480]  Some say it's a faint and that Putin will try to take half of Ukraine and may call
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:34.520]  the bluff of the so-called West, the corporate interest that overthrew Ukraine.
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:38.000]  And again, I know the Ukrainian government was corrupt, was manipulating, but it was
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  elected.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.960]  And the point is, from my view, this whole thing has been initiated by the State Department
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.160]  with $5 billion by the West.
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.840]  And if we can't get our guests on Skype, I want to go to phone.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:49.840]  Oh, fantastic.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:50.840]  We do.
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:51.840]  We do have him.
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:58.680]  So we're going to be talking to Peter Van Buren, 24-year veteran of the State Department,
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:03.160]  comes highly recommended and regarded by Ray McGovern, former top CIA analyst, Reagan
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:08.000]  and Bush Sr., who couldn't join us today, so he recommended Mr. Van Buren, and I appreciate
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  coming on.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  I remember his case in the news.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.480]  He spent a while in Iraq following his book.
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:17.440]  He meant well how I helped lose the battle for the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.840]  The Department of State began proceedings against him through the efforts of the Government
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:25.440]  Accountability Project, who currently helps represent Snowden, Edward Snowden, and the
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:30.040]  ACLU, Van Buren, instead, retired from the State Department with honors.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:35.800]  And a Van Buren's new book, Ghost of Tom Joed, is the story of the 99 percent, and he has
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:36.800]  WeMeantWell.com.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.920]  Now, I don't really know his view on this.
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:40.440]  I like to get different perspectives.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.840]  I kind of know Ray McGovern's.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.240]  It's a balanced view that I agree with a lot of, but I wanted to get his current analysis
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:50.840]  of that, but he recommended Peter Van Buren, so he joins us until the bottom of the hour.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:54.120]  We've got nuke tests going off, missiles being launched.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:58.960]  We've got civil war in my view, breaking out in Eastern Ukraine.
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:03.320]  Both sides have their own beefs, but I see this as a way to pump trillions more into
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:09.040]  Europe out of the crisis, a new Marshall plan that's really a banker bailout that's endangering
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.040]  wider war.
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:15.160]  That's my first approximation of the first level of this Peter Van Buren.
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:19.680]  And so what is your educated take on what's going on, Peter?
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:25.360]  It's difficult to say whether this is just incompetence, or whether it's the rebirth
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:31.960]  of the neocon idea that America has a role to play every time a country faces what we
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:34.920]  now like to call regime change.
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.720]  As far as incompetence is concerned, certainly the Obama administration, particularly John
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:44.760]  Kerry, the Secretary of State, have seemingly stumbled through this crisis from the very
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:51.440]  earliest days of supporting the overthrow through Victoria Nuland's foolish recorded
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:58.880]  telephone call where she isolated and alienated the EU up through Kerry's current bungling
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:05.020]  attempts to impose sanctions and otherwise perhaps scare Putin, maybe unfriend him on
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:06.020]  Facebook.
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:13.280]  Well, I agree with that, just watching this real-life nightmare soap opera unfold that
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:17.440]  they're incompetent, but they're incompetent like Hitler was attacking Russia, they're
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:25.840]  driving the giant juggernaut, so what is your view of the overall system of Russia and where
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.040]  all this is going?
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:33.040]  Well, when I served with the State Department for 24 years, one of the basic rules was that
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.120]  countries act in their own self-interest.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:41.720]  They do things globally and domestically that are in the country's self-interest.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:48.200]  Russia from historical times has been concerned about its borders, particularly its western
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:52.280]  border with Europe that drove the Russians throughout their history, drove them during
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:57.480]  World War II when Hitler did attack them, and it drove them through the Cold War when
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:00.880]  NATO was positioning on their western border.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:06.480]  What we've seen now is the United States driving that fear, driving that perhaps paranoia in
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.720]  Russia, backing them into a corner.
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:17.200]  The offer of the EU to bring the Ukraine into NATO, the offer that was a one-sided deal.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.560]  If you want to be in with us, you've got to cut your ties to Russia.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.880]  There's no such thing as a three-way here.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:28.960]  That caused the Russians to perk up and to start to focus again on the Ukraine and to
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:33.240]  fear that they needed to take more drastic action for their own protection.
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:38.520]  Look, Alex, one of the basic rules of diplomacy, one of the things we learned in negotiating
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:43.880]  101, is don't back your opponent into a corner because he's got no choice but to come out
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:44.880]  fighting.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.520]  I wish the Obama administration had taken that same class.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:54.160]  Look, I'm not a State Department trained 24-year veteran like you, it's been all these combat
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.160]  zones.
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.640]  I just watch it and read it.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.960]  I know it's not a duly elected government, Obama's is a duly elected.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:04.080]  I know it's spearheaded by real Nazis wearing swastikas, hiling Hitler.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:09.000]  I mean, it's so bizarre, I can't believe I turn on CNN and they're calling them wondrous
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  freedom fighters.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  I know they have some real beefs.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.800]  A lot of Ukrainians aren't Nazis that don't like the Russians.
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.400]  They have some beefs with Lenin and Stalin.
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:16.400]  I get it.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:23.160]  There's old enmity that the State Department and the CIA are openly manipulating in a balkanization.
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:27.600]  And then I look at Russia trying to work with the West, from what I've seen in the last
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.880]  10 years, they've actually been trying to reset, trying to be nice, trying to work with
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:32.880]  people.
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:35.680]  Again, I'm not glorifying or saying Putin's an angel.
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:39.720]  And I see this as a Western attempt to not let Russia democratize.
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.480]  I see it as an attempt to have a new boogeyman from al-Qaeda and now it's going to be the
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:48.280]  Russians and a new way to fund the military industrial complex.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:52.620]  And it's crazy because the Russians came out today and said, again, we will basically
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:58.200]  nuke NATO targets if you hit any of our interests, as they said back on 888.
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.680]  Now, we pulled out of Georgia that time.
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.800]  A, do you agree with what I just said or do you want to augment it?
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.400]  And B, where do you see this going?
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.400]  Absolutely.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.360]  I agree with everything you said there, Alex.
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:09.680]  We put them in a corner.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:15.160]  We've poked at their most tender spot, their fear of foreign intervention on their Western
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:16.160]  border.
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:20.960]  And then we act almost surprised that things are going the way they are.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:24.920]  There's a lay definition of mental illness that says it's repeating the same thing over
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:27.560]  and over, expecting different results.
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:32.360]  The United States, since the end of World War II, has supported despots, dictators,
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:38.040]  thugs, bin Laden terrorists through the CIA and through our other manipulations, expecting
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:43.560]  that out of this, strong allies and democracies will somehow magically emerge.
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:49.880]  It hasn't worked for the last 60 years, but yet we're trying that again in the Ukraine.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.440]  Where it bounces from here is a tough question.
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:57.720]  A lot depends on how much further the United States really wants to push Putin.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.920]  Do we really want to test him on this?
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:05.520]  Do we really want to push him to the point where he has to lash out, where he has to
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:12.000]  do something to preserve his reputation, to preserve his equities on the border, to appear
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.200]  strong?
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:19.000]  That kind of confrontation is a loser for every side, for every one, but it appears that
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:26.920]  the United States, driven by these odd scraps of neocons who still somehow are in the administration,
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:31.480]  driven by them, that seems to be a path that they're not afraid of taking, even though
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:34.720]  the rest of us should be scared stiff.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:40.520]  Is an old Trotskyite beef, the fact that the neocons were founded by the heir to Trotsky
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:46.320]  here in the U.S. when he was killed in Mexico, is it that they have a hatred of Russia?
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:51.920]  I wish it was, it was that clear and that simple, that would almost make some of this
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:53.080]  make sense.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:58.640]  I think the truth lies closer to your earlier comment that we go abroad in search of boogeymen
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:00.120]  to fight.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:04.560]  9-11 was supposed to create the boogeymen of all time, terrorism.
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:10.080]  It isn't even a person, it isn't even a country, it was a thing, it was a concept and therefore
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.600]  could go on indefinitely.
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:15.920]  The people who make money off wars could make money, the politicians who make money
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:20.640]  leaking about wars could make money and get votes, everyone would be happy.
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:25.760]  But you know, the terrorist thing has not worked out quite the way we want it, Iraq,
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:29.880]  Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, fill in the rest of the blanks.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:35.720]  So you go with what you know in these situations and it appears that the neocons are driving
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:42.080]  the United States manufacturing perhaps a new Cold War with the old enemy.
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:56.920]  Hey, it worked back then, maybe it'll work again.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:26.680]  Alright, we're out of time.

[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:06.520]  and affecting your mind?
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:09.160]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia,
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.600]  loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:12.720]  to think clearly.
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:15.240]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods,
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.720]  and toxic chemicals can compromise your health

[01:22:58.680 --> 01:22:59.240]  Hi, folks.
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.520]  Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:04.080]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.640]  of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:09.000]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.880]  apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:14.760]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:17.840]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:19.280]  for patriots was born.
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:21.880]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.280]  or accepted outside funding.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:25.960]  They now operate two distribution facilities
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.200]  and employ over 50 hardworking American men and women.
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.400]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.640]  And that's why I stock MyPatriot
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:37.760]  with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriot Supply.
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.760]  Go to MyPatriotsupply.com.

[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:55.040]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:57.800]  Buy Patriot Supply.com slash Alex.
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:09.000]  There must be some kind of way out of here, Jimmy Hendricks.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.680]  Famously sung.
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:14.920]  And we're talking to Peter Van Buren, author, State
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:16.760]  Department veteran.
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:17.760]  Wementwell.com.
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.200]  I want to ask him about his new book, This Out.
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:21.280]  And we'll get him on for a full hour in the near future
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:22.360]  to cover the waterfront.
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:24.560]  But in this short segment we've got left with you,
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:27.800]  I want to play this clip of Obama a few weeks ago, again,
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:31.240]  saying that it's an elected government in Kiev.
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:35.560]  And I mean, I've never seen the overthrow of reality
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:38.480]  at this level across the board.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.600]  Saying raising the debt limit doesn't raise our debt.
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:43.560]  I mean, just two plus two equals five level statements.
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:45.240]  I want to get your take on this.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.000]  Here's the clip.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  What they cannot accept understandably
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:55.760]  is the notion that they are simply an appendage,
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:25:00.160]  an extension of Russia, and that the Kremlin has veto power
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:07.080]  over decisions made by a duly elected government in Kiev.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:08.920]  Now, when he said that a week and a half ago,
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:11.640]  I never saw any media correcting.
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:15.280]  I mean, this is Twilight Zone, Peter Van Buren.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:17.800]  The thing about these statements is
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.400]  it's almost as if they don't really care anymore
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:23.640]  about who's paying attention or what they're saying.
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:26.680]  You've got a position now where the Obama government simply
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:30.240]  says whatever seems to tumble out of their mouths.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:33.320]  And I don't know that anybody believes it,
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:34.840]  not even themselves.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.680]  The duly elected government?
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:37.800]  Who elected them?
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.040]  Where were those votes counted?
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:43.200]  Instead, you've got Victoria Nuland on the phone
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:48.160]  saying that Yatsychent is going to be our man.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:51.600]  And then, surprisingly, after this coup business,
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.720]  the guy ends up in charge of things.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.120]  The other thing that Obama keeps doing
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.720]  is he keeps poking the bear, if you will.
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:03.240]  Recently, the Obama administration
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:08.280]  encouraged the Ukrainian forces to go on a terrorist hunt
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:11.440]  in their eastern provinces.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:13.560]  And what a surprise, they messed that up.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:14.720]  It didn't go very well.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:17.440]  And the Russians are forced to respond.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.240]  My good friend, Ray McGovern, was
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:22.040]  writing about all these issues back in March.
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.040]  Everybody remembers the Sochi Olympics.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:26.840]  And everybody remembers how, as soon as the lights went off
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:31.640]  in Sochi, the Russians began their work in the Ukraine.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:34.480]  At that time, Obama had the opportunity
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:38.680]  to call for a summit, to call for a meeting with Putin
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:40.520]  to sort these issues out.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:44.440]  Instead, we fussed around with claiming elections
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:47.200]  were there and throwing sanctions
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:50.600]  and holding our breath until Putin changed his mind
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.920]  and somehow backed out of these things.
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:55.720]  It's a series of incompetent gestures
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:58.800]  that unfortunately reminds me far too much
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:02.320]  of the same set of silly walks, if you will,
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:06.080]  that took place in Syria, where again, the US and the Russians
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.240]  were heading towards some kind of a conflict.
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:11.520]  We were supporting one side by proxy, the Russians,
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:12.560]  the other.
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.760]  In that case, our fumbles and stumbles
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.600]  were picked up by the Russians.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.560]  And they pulled us out of the fire
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:21.560]  in some kind of weird, twisted, twilight,
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:23.120]  zoned bit of irony.
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:23.840]  Exactly.
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:26.640]  And what's so crazy is the West-backed
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:30.600]  Al-Qaeda in Syria, Russia picks the right side of Assad.
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.680]  Obviously, no angel, but an angel compared to them.
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:37.880]  And then we pick the Nazis in Ukraine against the Russians.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:39.760]  I mean, it's like America is trying
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:42.520]  to be the bad guy under this leadership.
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:45.040]  And like you said, it's a bunch of crazy neocons
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:48.120]  with a bunch of so-called liberals who aren't liberal at all.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:50.560]  How do these people stay in government?
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:53.160]  Victoria Nuland and a lot of these other neocons
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.840]  that are working now on the Ukraine issue
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:58.120]  were supposed to be flushed out in 2018.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:00.480]  Well, they talk like gangsters in these telephone calls
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:02.920]  that they admit got recorded by the Russians and released.
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:05.080]  They don't talk like diplomats I've ever heard of.
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:10.480]  I mean, they sound like people that watch different HBO
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:14.200]  shows like House of Cards and think that's real.
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:15.280]  Yeah.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.680]  I think the idea that they are not in touch with reality
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.400]  is kind of an overarching theme here.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.480]  Whether they're a-thing television shows
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:27.200]  are still imagining the world as a chessboard,
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:30.360]  that the United States can slide pieces around
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:34.600]  and somehow manipulate events in Syria, in the Ukraine,
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.400]  in other parts of the world.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:38.560]  Well, Victoria, if you are listening,
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:41.240]  and I do doubt she listens to your show, Alex,
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:43.360]  Victoria, if you are listening, the Russians
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.960]  are the ones who are really good at chess.
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:48.400]  We're in checkmate right now in the Ukraine,
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.880]  and we've got no moves left that can actually
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:52.320]  influence this game.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:54.360]  Why are you saying we're in checkmate?
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:56.080]  We're in checkmate because the question
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:59.960]  of what can the United States do to advance its interests
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.160]  in the Ukraine.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:03.200]  When you're in checkmate in the game of chess,
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.920]  you've got no moves left.
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:09.240]  The only thing you can do at that point is lose the game.
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:10.160]  In the Ukraine.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.520]  Or top the table over at World War Three.
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:16.000]  Well, you can, in fact, tip the board over and run for the door,
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.280]  and that involves nuclear exchanges and things like that.
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:21.680]  So we're kind of hoping we don't get that far.
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:24.240]  I want to ask you how you think we should get out of it
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:25.640]  and what the best brains are.
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:27.480]  Can you do five more minutes with us on the other side?
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:28.560]  Oh, absolutely, Alex.
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:29.080]  OK, thank you.
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:31.600]  So we're going to come right back to WebsitesWeMintWell.com.
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:34.520]  Peter Van Buren will say about his great new book,
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:37.960]  but we'll have to have him back in the near future.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:41.280]  When we come back, though, after he leaves us,
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:44.680]  I'm going to get into some very important news dealing
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:49.160]  with the Federal Reserve being grilled in the Senate.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.440]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:52.920]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:59.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:03.560]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself,
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:07.160]  our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:09.440]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:12.000]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.840]  higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:18.240]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.120]  toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:23.440]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:26.000]  Well, over 1,000 types of mold in mildew
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.600]  link to numerous conditions.
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.960]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:32.040]  live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.920]  When I began to research these statistics,
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:37.520]  it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:39.800]  in order to combat the toxic environment
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:42.320]  that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against,
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:45.120]  made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:46.840]  and manufactured in the USA.
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.840]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:50.800]  is here in a convenient spray bottle
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:53.400]  that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:56.440]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:00.040]  or by calling toll 3-888-253-3139.
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.880]  The globalist social engineers are not just
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:03.440]  targeting us with propaganda.
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:05.880]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:09.400]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimicers
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.960]  that lower our testosterone and other hormones
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:14.440]  and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:17.280]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists,
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:19.800]  and others, we have developed what I believe
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:24.880]  is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:27.520]  sourced from powerful organic herbs
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:30.720]  and then concentrated or maximum potency.
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:32.840]  Super male vitality was developed
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:36.400]  to activate your body's own natural processes
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:38.720]  instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:42.560]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:45.160]  that I only take half the recommended dose.

[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:09.200]  to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:11.520]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:13.920]  has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.320]  where the Chiapas farmers grow
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:17.600]  their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:20.600]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.440]  in a highly customized blend.

[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:36.440]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.320]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:41.640]  and it's taken us years to secure connections directly
[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:43.480]  to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:46.000]  Brought by the site today, order a bag or two
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.880]  and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:50.320]  Available in original or with our immune support

[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:56.240]  all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:57.560]  of my favorite coffee.
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:00.040]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:22.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.240]  in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:28.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:31.560]  Ron Paul has been accused of being a Russian agent
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:37.840]  by neocon media and people known to be in the CIA.
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:40.120]  I've been accused of that because I'm against starting
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.080]  a war overthrowing our government
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.720]  and taking us to the brink of nuclear war
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:46.560]  when the Russians are not in an offensive mode.
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:52.880]  And we've got a guest on Peter Van Buren
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:54.800]  and I would call him a classical liberal
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:59.120]  but a lot of folks would call him a real liberal.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:01.080]  And then you've got people on the left
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:02.480]  that want to have all these wars
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:06.560]  and have made it a left wing cause celeb to attack Russia
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.720]  and brought in all this gay stuff.
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:10.560]  Hey, get that out of the way, folks.
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:12.960]  That's not an excuse for World War III.
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:16.840]  But the point is it's about who knows the facts.
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:18.400]  Who knows the history of Ukraine?
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:21.120]  Who knows what's going on there?
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:25.080]  Who knows the larger chessboard?
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:28.960]  And the fact that this is completely immoral
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:31.120]  and it's not in the interest of the American people.
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:34.200]  It's in the interest of big banks and the EU
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:36.640]  that wants to be bailed out again
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:41.400]  and politicians and political classes that love crises
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:43.000]  and love managing them.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.120]  They have a stake in a destabilized world.
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.360]  So there's a lot of people that work for the CIA,
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:50.280]  the State Department, the FBI, you name it,
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:53.240]  domestically foreign, who do mean well,
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:55.360]  but they're compartmentalized.
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.360]  And then you've got the corporate agents.
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.320]  And I'm not demonizing business in general,
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:01.760]  but the big corporate interest
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:05.000]  that don't care about the interest of people
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.720]  or their own children for that matter,
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:09.960]  they want that money and that status now.
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:12.760]  And they will bring the world to the brink of total collapse
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:15.560]  as economic hitmen that John Perkins exposed,
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:20.480]  he was one of them, to get their power, their records.
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.280]  And I liken this analogy to every culture's had records.
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:26.560]  But if you go back 300 years ago in England,
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:29.720]  down off the coasts by the English Channel,
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:31.920]  they would have liehouses, firehouses.
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.760]  And during fog, different cities,
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:37.080]  different towns would shut up a fire
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:40.680]  to bring ships in and wreck them
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:43.680]  because of salvage laws would let them then go out
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:45.920]  in the morning and steal whatever's on the boat
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:49.280]  when the crew dies or the crew comes in the short.
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:51.760]  And that's what vulture capitalism is,
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:53.360]  is you just wreck everything,
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:56.000]  use government to shut down your competition,
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.160]  shut down mom and pops.
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.680]  And I'm ranting, I wanna get some comments
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:02.200]  from our guest on how we stop this,
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:04.120]  where his gut tells him this is gonna go,
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:09.120]  studying these people and how he thinks
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:11.600]  we can maybe try to get America's soul back
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:14.120]  and not try to be villains,
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:18.160]  not try to have an elite that think it's cool to be crooks
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:20.480]  and then lose America's soft power
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:22.160]  that people like John F. Kennedy had.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.680]  So five more minutes, Peter Van Buren,
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:25.520]  thank you for joining us.
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:27.800]  And then briefly tell us about your new book at the end,
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:31.280]  but you've got the kind of the gestalt I've thrown out there.
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:33.960]  It's a very difficult question to answer
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:36.120]  because what has happened over the course
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:40.760]  of the last 50 years is almost a snowballing effect
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:43.880]  of concentrations of power.
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:46.760]  The new power resides in the hands
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:49.960]  of the corporate interests that you've discussed
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:51.480]  and it's a little different.
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:55.800]  They're not interested in conquering land per se
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:00.040]  or in being able to tell people in foreign lands
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:02.080]  how to live per se.
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:05.240]  They're interested primarily in acquiring
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:08.080]  wealth, capital and money.
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:10.640]  And if that means conquering lands, well sure,
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:13.120]  that's something that has to be done.
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:16.240]  By snowball effect, I mean that through the manipulation
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:19.800]  of the tax system, they get to hold on and grow their money.
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:23.600]  And at the same time, use that money to fund politicians,
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:26.400]  to make people beholden to them,
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:28.720]  to create new laws and new policies
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:31.680]  that can keep the game in play.
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:34.720]  Ukraine started over a question, the crisis,
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:37.160]  if you will, in Ukraine, started over a question
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:41.200]  of which economic block Ukraine was going to join.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:44.840]  Was it going to join EU and which by proxy
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:46.160]  includes the United States?
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:48.960]  Or was it going to cleave towards Russia?
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:52.640]  Both sides, the Russians and particularly on the EU side,
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:55.920]  said to the Ukraine, this is a one-way trip.
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:57.680]  You pick us or you pick them.
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:00.280]  You're either with us or against us,
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:02.800]  forcing the Ukrainians in between these two
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:05.000]  large economic forces.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.760]  If anyone out there can articulate exactly what America's
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:12.000]  reasons for being involved in Ukraine are,
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.120]  absent the desire to capture that market
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:18.480]  and control the economy, I'd be very interested
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:22.120]  to hear from them what exactly those interests are.
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:25.360]  Very well said.
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:26.960]  And from what I've experienced,
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:30.240]  this is where you get World War I, World War II.
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:32.800]  This is where you get, I mean all historians are saying that,
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.280]  is when you get disconnected a leech,
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:37.120]  that aren't even so much arrogant,
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:39.640]  I mean they are arrogant, hubris filled,
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:43.680]  but they're disconnected from the ground,
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:47.520]  like Maria Antoinette let them eat cake and the Bastille,
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:50.040]  and they push people over the edge
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:51.560]  because they're so insulated.
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:55.000]  I mean, John Corzine could make 40 to one bets
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.960]  with other people's money, steal billions
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:00.520]  and then not even get in trouble for it.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:05.160]  The IRS won't go after billionaires that don't pay taxes.
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:07.640]  I mean, they really feel insulated
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:09.400]  because no one has ever stopped them.
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:10.960]  And I think they have a form of,
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:13.960]  to be a psychologist, narcissistic megalomania
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:18.880]  that we see triggering massive empire collapses.
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:22.160]  And I just hope that other sectors of the establishment
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:24.280]  who aren't psychopathic or mentally ill
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:27.920]  get involved to stop the establishment
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.920]  before they completely wreck everything.
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:33.520]  My fingers are crossed that you're right,
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:37.240]  but my concern is, is that there may not be
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:40.360]  an immediate way to slow this down,
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:43.160]  certainly not an immediate way to bring it to a stop.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:45.720]  Greed is such a powerful motivator,
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:47.920]  and these folks have figured out a way
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:51.280]  that they can pull money out of the lower classes,
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:54.880]  the 99% and pull it into their own pockets.
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:58.800]  People who complain about wealth, income distribution
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:01.800]  or wealth redistribution is something awful,
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:03.560]  communism or what have you,
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:08.040]  don't seem to mind when that redistribution is going up.
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:10.960]  They only seem to object when it goes down.
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:13.040]  And this is the situation we're facing here
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.800]  in the United States that, as you mentioned,
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:18.680]  reminds me far, far too much of what we saw prior
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:22.080]  to World War I, that created that inevitable march
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:25.240]  into war and the destruction that took place,
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:28.560]  even while a lot of people profited from it.
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:36.160]  I agree with you, and it's just chilling
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.000]  to then see the establishment digging in
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.200]  with all the COG and bunkers,
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.000]  and even having the Pentagon put out
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.240]  report after report the last eight, nine years,
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:45.880]  we could survive a nuclear war,
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.440]  we could start using tactical nukes routinely.
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:51.000]  You know, nukes were kind of fun.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.240]  I mean, I've never heard such crazy talk.
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:55.840]  The last time I heard the crazy talk
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:58.200]  was when I watched a movie called Doctor Strange Love,
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.200]  it was made during the Cold War,
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:04.000]  and it featured people in the military and politicians
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.160]  talking about how they would live
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:08.320]  in specially prepared bunkers
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:11.160]  and reproduce to repopulate the earth.
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:14.840]  Now, that was allegedly a comedy, a satire,
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:16.640]  but you're reaching for a point
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:20.040]  where a certain small number of people,
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:23.800]  and we use the term 1% as almost a shorthand,
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:26.680]  are controlling so much that what happens
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:30.400]  to everyone else is really a little consequence to them.
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:32.800]  They're interested in capital,
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:35.680]  and I hesitate to mention that once upon a time
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:40.480]  in America's history, capital included human beings, slaves,
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:43.040]  who were owned the same way that you own machines
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:44.760]  or property or factories,
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:47.040]  and treated with just as much callousness.
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:49.960]  That's right, well, they use NSA fixing systems worldwide
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:52.040]  now on record to game the stock markets.
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:54.600]  It's all fake to never let people get ahead,
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:57.240]  and then they blame private property
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:59.160]  and capitalism for this.
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:00.280]  When this isn't capitalism,
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:03.480]  it's total, pure, monopoly capitalism,
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:06.160]  vulture capitalism rigged.
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:08.560]  It's a totally rigged casino,
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:13.400]  and since it's rigged, we either remove this system
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:16.600]  or they're going to end up destroying everyone,
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:18.200]  and I go back to Dr. Strangelove,
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.800]  where they're talking about, well, sir,
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:22.440]  we'll have to have a 10 to one female male ratio,
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:25.520]  and animals will have to be bred and slaughtered,
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:27.080]  and of course, Mr. President,
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:29.760]  we cannot allow a mine shaft gap.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:31.920]  And then you learn that Dr. Strangelove,
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:35.120]  as I've talked to the Kubrick family, his daughter,
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:37.840]  he got visited by the CIA and stuff over that movie.
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:40.120]  Like, how did you know all that from his sources?
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.840]  General Jack T. Rippers Curtis LeMay
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.600]  that wanted to have a nuclear war with the Russians,
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:46.400]  the Bland Corporation is the RAND Corporation,
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:49.560]  Plan R was a real RAND Corporation plan,
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:51.240]  saying let's have a nuclear war.
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:52.600]  This would be good.
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:56.080]  I was tempted to do the imitation
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:57.640]  of Dr. Strangelove myself,
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:59.560]  but thank you for being here.
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:03.040]  Oh, he grabs his arm and he goes, ah, yeah.
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:04.840]  Well, you know, that's based on some real people
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:06.280]  they had advising the Pentagon.
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:08.280]  I'm telling you, this is so crazy.
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:10.280]  You're reaching for a zero point.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:12.240]  What you've got now are two lines
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:14.280]  that used to be out here
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:18.160]  between the wealthy and powerful and the rest of us
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:21.040]  that are heading towards a zero point.
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.040]  That zero point, which, gratefully,
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:24.400]  is still in the distance right now,
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:28.120]  is that Strangelove in future, that nuclear exchange,
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:32.560]  that complete abandonment of concern for all of us.
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:34.600]  We're not there yet, but I'm afraid
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:36.880]  that it's out there in our future,
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:39.920]  out there in the distance, unless we start to speak up,
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:43.240]  unless we start to push back, unless we start to say
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:47.840]  that 99% of us are a lot more than you
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:50.760]  and you've got the money, but you still don't have us.
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:53.840]  You can buy our labor, you can buy our homes,
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:56.400]  but you can't yet buy our souls.
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:58.400]  And that's something we're gonna hold on to,
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:01.320]  and that's what's gonna give us a little bit of chance
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:04.120]  to stop that zero point from happening.
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:07.040]  And they also confuse everything.
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.720]  Like, they parade communists around,
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:11.480]  when people talk about 99%,
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:13.440]  and then that's being Soros funded,
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:15.160]  to then discredit the real movement,
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:18.920]  pointing out the 99.999% is being gained.
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:20.840]  Then they use racism to divide everybody.
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:23.800]  I mean, it is so scientific,
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:25.520]  but the elite have to understand
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:27.800]  the world they build has blowback.
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:30.760]  They will never escape the nightmare they're building.
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:32.760]  I mean, there could be 100 of these people left.
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:34.080]  They'll start trying to kill each other
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:36.200]  in one of their underground bases
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:38.840]  or whatever to try to have total control.
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:41.120]  They'll never put this back in the bottle
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:43.720]  unless they decide to put it back in the bottle.
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:47.000]  And I think it's up to us to publicly break with them,
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.360]  haul them out, educate people about how the world really works.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:54.440]  And I think there's a human instinct to survival,
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:57.800]  and I hope sane minds prevail,
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:44:59.560]  but it might not be off in the distance.
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:01.400]  I mean, if they start attacking Russian interest,
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:03.720]  the Russians might actually do something
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:05.800]  or pour in with heavy armor,
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:08.400]  and then if NATO attacks that with overwhelming force,
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:11.200]  the Russian doctrine is to use nuclear weapons.
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:12.680]  And so do you tell the Russians,
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:15.200]  go ahead and just let the West attack you
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:16.480]  and just give up Ukraine?
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:19.960]  The problem is, then they'll be inside Russia next
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:23.160]  or they'll attack in Georgia or they'll attack in Poland.
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:26.040]  And where do these NATO generals think they're gonna be
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:27.320]  if they do this?
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:31.040]  You're back, it's like you woke up,
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:35.720]  then you're back to the future and it's 1985 once again.
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:37.680]  Going back to my earlier point,
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:41.240]  you cannot back your opponent into a corner
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:45.720]  and expect him to do anything other than to lash out.
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:48.520]  And while the Russians certainly have a formidable military,
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:49.920]  they've got a lot of other things
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:51.480]  that can be effective as well.
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:54.240]  The Russians control extraordinary amount of the energy,
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:58.440]  natural gas and oil that fuels Western Europe.
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:01.520]  If they were to raise prices, cut off access,
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:04.840]  restrict the flow, that could have dramatic effect.
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:07.480]  Well, the Russians have got sleeper cells in the West,
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:09.800]  everybody knows it with nuclear weapons.
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:11.440]  And I know the West has that too.
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:13.880]  I mean, this is gonna be hell on earth.
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:17.760]  A five-man commando team sleeper cell without a nuke
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:20.960]  can kill thousands of people in one day, shut a city down.
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:23.800]  And all the anti-terror training, fear training
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:26.160]  that the globalists have put into the American people
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:28.320]  has turned the public into a bunch of pansies.
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:30.440]  If we get hit by real terror,
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.840]  people are gonna go into jellyfish mode.
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:35.920]  Look what's happened now, 13 years later,
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:39.360]  over one terrible day of tragedy.
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:40.920]  We haven't recovered from that.
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:44.960]  We went off and killed more than more Americans in Iraq
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:47.080]  and more Americans in Afghanistan
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:50.480]  than died on that tragic, tragic day on 9-11.
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:53.200]  And yet, we only focus back on that.
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:55.040]  We only turn around and say,
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:57.440]  that's the event that has controlled the United States.
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:58.760]  That's why we have to kill all our freedom
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:00.080]  and give the elites all the power
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:00.920]  because of a group.
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:03.040]  They're publicly funding to attack Syria right now.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.400]  It's total fraud.
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:05.840]  Sure, I wanna thank you for the time.
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:07.320]  It's paymentwell.com.
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:10.560]  And we're gonna have you back on very soon
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.560]  to get into your new book
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:14.600]  and briefly tell us about that.
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:17.120]  Alex, the book covers a lot of these same themes
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:18.440]  that we've been talking about here
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.120]  at the end of the interview.
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:22.600]  The story, it's called The Ghosts of Tom Jo,
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:25.000]  a story of the 99%.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.840]  And it's fiction, but very lightly glazed fiction,
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:29.680]  if you will.
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:31.880]  It's all based on true experiences.
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:35.080]  I worked at 53 years old in the minimum wage economy.
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:37.480]  I spent some time living in my car.
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:39.760]  I traveled throughout the rust belt of the Midwest.
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:42.040]  I just got back from Oklahoma
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:43.920]  to take a look at things out there.
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:47.920]  And what I discovered was a core of America
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:49.200]  that's being abandoned.
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:50.360]  Oh, it looks like it's been bombed.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:51.600]  It looks worse than third world countries.
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:54.240]  I drove around areas in Texas that were beautiful.
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:56.640]  20 years ago, it looks like a war zone.
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:58.680]  And again, here you are at the State Department.
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.400]  You leave because you told the truth.
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:01.880]  And now you're experiencing it.
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:04.240]  We're gonna have you back on that subject in the next few weeks.
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:05.440]  Thank you so much for the time.
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:06.680]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:07.840]  Wow, that was a powerful interview.
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:09.600]  That guy knows what he's talking about.
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:12.600]  And I just hope this can all be reversed
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:14.920]  because I don't think nuclear war is out in the distance.
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:18.240]  I think it's 24 hours away potentially,
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:20.040]  or a year away, or 10 years away.
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:21.640]  The point is it needs to stop.
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:24.560]  I mean, just because the bankers and Goldman Sachs
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.240]  can rig everything and steal all the money
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:29.080]  and have the government and the Federal Reserve
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:31.200]  tell us it's our job to prop it up,
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:33.040]  doesn't mean we have to go along with it.
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:35.200]  Now, when we come back, I'm gonna play the video,
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:39.520]  Fed Share, Unsure of Capitalism, or oligarchy runs the US.
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:41.520]  I mean, this is the level we've gotten at.
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:45.400]  Where Obama says it's an elected government in Ukraine,
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:48.640]  it's not, and that you didn't build your business
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:49.760]  and that raising the debt ceiling
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:54.120]  doesn't raise the debt ceiling, and the Fed head says,
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:55.920]  I don't know if we're an oligarchy.
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:00.080]  An oligarchy, by the way, is a group that runs the system,
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:03.160]  but it's a dictatorship of a group.
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:05.520]  We can give you the actual definition.
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:06.880]  Why don't we pull up the definition of oligarchy
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:07.720]  for folks?
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:09.320]  I just gave you the lay definition.
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:13.080]  But these people are bringing us into crazy town.
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:17.480]  It's the Greek, meaning oligarchy, few,
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:19.800]  is a form of power structure in which power
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:22.240]  effectively rests with a small number of people.
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:25.680]  Those people could be distinguished by royalty,
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:27.640]  wealth, family ties, education,
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:29.200]  corporate, or military control.
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:31.760]  Such states are often controlled by a few prominent families,
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:32.960]  typically passed their influence
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:34.680]  from one generation to the next,
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:37.240]  but inheritance is not necessarily a condition
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:38.880]  to the form and application of this term.
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:39.920]  There you go.
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:42.800]  It is known as a tyranny in the Greek.
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:47.760]  Now, I mean, is Obama gonna say
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:49.520]  that Kim Jong-un is duly elected?
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.240]  Cause he's as duly elected in North Korea.
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:56.000]  I mean, it's like Obama's saying
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.400]  North Korean dictator is elected.
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:00.680]  I mean, what does it say when the president
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:03.640]  of the United States gets up on television
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:05.480]  and says the Ukrainian government's duly elected
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:07.440]  and the whore media doesn't cover it?
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:13.320]  By the way, folks, please remember
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:15.320]  that it's absolutely essential to spread the word
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:17.440]  about the broadcast and to support our local AM
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:19.200]  and FM affiliates by spreading the word
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:21.040]  and supporting local sponsors.
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:24.760]  If you hear a car dealership or a restaurant advertised
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:26.960]  on this show or this station, you need to support them
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:28.400]  and let the station know why you're doing that.
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:29.800]  We're getting a lot of affiliates
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:31.120]  because you are supporting them
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:32.680]  and they're getting good response
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:34.000]  and they're big listenerships.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.200]  So freedom is popular.
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:36.760]  This show is hardcore.
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:38.880]  And the fact that it's on over 160 plus stations
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:42.000]  around the country from Boston.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.080]  I mean, they're freaking out about that.
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:46.000]  And DC and the media, there's news articles
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.120]  this last week freaking out
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:50.120]  that we're on with these big stations around the country.
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:51.240]  The truth is coming out.

[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:19.680]  Now, let's get to this clip
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:21.440]  and I'm gonna cover this more in the next hour.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:22.640]  After Bruce finally leaves this,
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:24.960]  he'll be with us about 30, 40 minutes
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:26.320]  on the attack on free speech
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:28.840]  and I've got a folder on that news.
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:31.000]  We're gonna be going over here
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.800]  to kind of give you a full wide spectrum
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:34.120]  of what's happening.
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:36.320]  You heard the head of the FCC come out
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:38.680]  and said that they wanna censor drugs and everybody else.
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:39.880]  I mean, this is really happening.
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:41.280]  The end of that neutrality, you name it,
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:43.680]  Bruce Fine, the guy that ended the fairness doctrine,
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:45.480]  joining us, top lawyer.
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:47.400]  But before we go any further,
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:49.920]  let's get to this Fed share.
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:53.560]  Unsure of capitalism or oligarchy describes the US.
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:56.160]  Yeah, it's not capitalism.
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:58.760]  This is in a Senate hearing with Bernie Sanders.
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:01.880]  It is a fascist model using socialism
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:04.240]  to control us at the grassroots,
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:07.120]  with the elites exempt with basically diplomatic immunity
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:08.440]  from everything.
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:09.760]  A breakaway civilization.
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:11.960]  Let's go to this powerful clip.
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:15.240]  Chair, in the US today,
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:18.360]  the top 1% own about 38%
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:19.880]  of the financial wealth of America.
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:24.120]  The bottom 60% own 2.3%.
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:27.200]  One family, the Walton family is worth
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:29.280]  over $140 billion.
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:32.000]  That's more wealth than the bottom 40%
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.560]  of the American people.
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:38.080]  In recent years, we have seen a huge increase
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:41.480]  in the number of millionaires and billionaires
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:43.520]  while we continue to have the highest rate
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:47.720]  of childhood poverty in the industrialized world.
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:51.520]  Despite this, as many of my Republican friends talk
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:55.080]  about the oppressive Obama economic policies
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:57.640]  in the last year, Charles and David Koch
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:59.320]  struggled under these policies
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:03.200]  and their wealth increased by $12 billion in one year,
[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:06.520]  despite the oppressive Obama economic policies.
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:08.960]  In terms of income.
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:10.760]  That's right, Obama works for the ultra-rich.
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:14.280]  Of new income generated in this country in the last year,
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:15.440]  went to the top 1%.
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:17.360]  Walmart tells their people to go on welfare.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:19.880]  And the studies are just introduced into the record
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:24.880]  by two professors from Princeton University,
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:28.520]  Professor Martin Gillins and Northwestern University,
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:32.240]  Professor Benjamin Page, basically suggest
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:35.360]  that while historically we have considered our society
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:37.760]  to be a capitalist democracy,
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:40.360]  we may now have entered into a phase
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:44.720]  where we are an oligarchic form of society.
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:47.680]  In your judgment, given the enormous power
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:49.400]  held by the billionaire class
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:52.440]  and their political representatives,
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:54.960]  are we still a capitalist democracy
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:58.920]  or have we gone over into an oligarchic form of society
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:02.920]  in which incredible economic and political power
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:04.720]  now rests with the billionaire class?
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:12.680]  So all of the statistics on inequality
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:16.840]  that you've cited are ones that greatly concern me.
[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:18.440]  And I think for the same reason
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:20.440]  that you're concerned about them,
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:25.280]  they can shape the, determine the ability
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:26.560]  of different groups.
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:28.040]  All right, we're gonna hit pause
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:30.200]  and come back and finish it.
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:32.120]  But I'm gonna explain what's going on here.
[01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:33.440]  The ultra rich know this,
[01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:34.920]  they're gonna destroy the middle class,
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:36.800]  give our money to the poor people.
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:37.920]  I'm gonna explain why.
[01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:46.640]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:51.280]  The Globalists have controlled
[01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:53.200]  the mainstream media for a long time,
[01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:54.840]  but now they're expanding,
[01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:58.080]  making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:00.360]  All the major networks are state run.
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:03.080]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:04.960]  The NFL has become a political weapon
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:07.360]  against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:10.720]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:12.800]  We have to break through our kind of private idea
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:14.680]  that kids belong to their parents
[01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:16.040]  or kids belong to their families
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:18.120]  or recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:20.560]  It is more important than ever to realize
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:22.440]  that we are not the alternative media.
[01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:24.280]  We are the true media.
[01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:26.960]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:30.720]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:45.880]  in the face of the tyrants.
[01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:48.520]  Join us at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:55.080]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:58.120]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:09.560]  Big brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:11.160]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:12.680]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:16.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:21.400]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:39.120]  All right, so Janet Yellen, the head of the Federal Reserve,
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:41.320]  who has given tens of trillions of dollars
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:43.520]  to private banking families.
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:45.120]  They've got Bernie Sanders, the socialist,
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:47.000]  targeting the Walmart family,
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.520]  which has made most of their wealth of Chinese slave goods
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:52.440]  and with undercutting markets
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:56.720]  and with telling their employees to go get on welfare.
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:00:59.200]  So, I mean, they're not free market.
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:01.000]  Very predatory, a product of NAFTA.
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:02.920]  Yeah, they've got 140 billion bucks
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:04.640]  between about seven people.
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:07.040]  Like one of them's worth like 60 billion smackers.
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:09.120]  And when they're not out, you know,
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:11.440]  dying in ultra light crashes, you know,
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:12.720]  they're busy manipulating our lives,
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:14.040]  funding both parties.
[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:15.120]  You got the Koch brothers
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:18.120]  that funded Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:22.000]  But those are the classic boogeymen.
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:23.200]  It's not that I'm saying they're good.
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.520]  It's just that that's all you ever hear about.
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:25.360]  What about the Rockefellers?
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:28.600]  What about the Rothschilds that control trillions?
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:31.440]  But she says, oh, I'm very concerned about the inequality.
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:34.880]  And I can't say if we're an oligarchy or not.
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:36.800]  As if she isn't at the top of the pyramid
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:40.200]  of the managerial system that's doing all this.
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:43.160]  And they're passing things to raise taxes on people,
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:46.960]  making $100, $200, $300,000 a year telling poor people
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:50.200]  that's a rich person to extinct the middle class
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:52.160]  that's the ladder up to wealth,
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:54.080]  which is the classic political action
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:56.560]  of any authoritarian regime.
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:59.400]  They're gonna use the inequality they've created
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:01.240]  to fully gut capitalism.
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:03.840]  What they've set up is a capitalism.
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:06.560]  And her and Sanders are up there
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:10.480]  playing the status game and the class envy game.
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:13.320]  Hey, you go to countries that are socialists,
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:14.920]  they're totally poor and hellish, folks,
[02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:17.240]  where people are lazy and aimless, like France.
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:20.960]  And it's all collapsing into eugenics.
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:22.200]  It's a plan.
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:25.600]  Socialism is a tool of fascism.
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:28.440]  National socialists were really fascist.
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:30.280]  They teach socialism and fascism two different things.
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:31.120]  No, they're not.
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:35.000]  It's all different flavors of cyanide-laced goulade.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.840]  Let's go back to her amazing response to Sanders.
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:40.960]  And we are an oligarchy
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:43.240]  and they are setting up a police state.
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:44.680]  And they're gonna manage everybody
[02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:48.040]  and forcibly take the wealth because it's a tool of control.
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:52.080]  And they're gonna give it short term to the welfare class
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:54.320]  because they're the big corporate whore welfare class
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:56.400]  that wanna secure their ill-gotten gains
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:57.600]  and they're gonna use poverty
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:00.720]  and two plus two equals five dumbed-down population
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:01.800]  to get it done.
[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:03.360]  Let's go to the clip.
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:07.840]  So all of the statistics on inequality
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:11.960]  that you've cited are ones that greatly concern me.
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:13.600]  And I think for the same reason
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:15.560]  that you're concerned about them,
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:19.200]  they can shape the,
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:22.240]  determine the ability of different groups
[02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:25.560]  to participate equally in a democracy
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:29.520]  and have grave effects on social stability over time.
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:32.760]  And so I don't know what to call our system
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:36.360]  or how to, I prefer not to give labels,
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:39.800]  but there's no question that we've had a trend
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:41.720]  toward growing inequality.
[02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:45.560]  And I personally find it very worrisome trend
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:48.280]  that deserve the attention of policymakers.
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:49.120]  Thank you.
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:51.680]  I mean, I think the point that the professors are making
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:54.560]  and others have made is that there comes a point
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:59.080]  where the billionaire class has so much political power
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:00.480]  where the Koch brothers are now
[02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:03.440]  because of Citizens United able to buy and sell politicians.
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:05.120]  They have so much political power.
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:06.960]  At what point is that reversible?
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:08.280]  And that is a great concern.
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:10.320]  So there you go.
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:13.480]  Full clip up on infowars.com with CNS news.com
[02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:15.280]  that first grabbed that clip.
[02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:16.680]  So good job on that.
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:17.520]  We're gonna come back.
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:20.400]  We're gonna get Bruce Fine on, constitutional lawyer,
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:22.840]  the man who killed the fairness doctrine more than anybody.
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:26.840]  He brought forward as the deputy commissioner of the FCC.
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:31.840]  The FCC, we've got the new head of the FCC saying that
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:34.840]  this is all basically a takeover that's happening.
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:37.280]  It's only one small part of the attack on free speech.
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:39.160]  How do we defend against this?
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:42.000]  Straight ahead with Bruce Fine.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:45.520]  I'm Alex Jones of infowars.com.
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:48.680]  And don't forget the nightly news, seven o'clock weeknights.
[02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:52.480]  And I'll be back this Sunday as well, live, four to 6 p.m.
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:53.800]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:55.720]  we're the hardest working folks in media
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:58.120]  because we know it's about the fight for liberty.
[02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:02.440]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:04.080]  in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:06.760]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia
[02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:08.400]  had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:10.880]  What are the health effects of having these drugs
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:12.000]  in our drinking water?
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.320]  It's forced medical treatment
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:15.080]  without the consent of residents.
[02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:18.040]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions
[02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:19.880]  you can take to protect you and your family
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:22.640]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:25.280]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate,
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:26.600]  at least once a week.
[02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:28.680]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates
[02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:30.960]  that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:33.480]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines,
[02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:37.080]  hydrofluorosilic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:39.600]  All right, it is in teeths and coffees and waters
[02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:40.880]  and breads and toothpaste.
[02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:43.640]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:45.080]  The establishment's not gonna do it.
[02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:46.440]  It's time to take action.
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:48.320]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:03.240]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased
[02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:04.800]  out of our staple foods
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:07.000]  and replaced with the halogen bromine,
[02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:10.880]  a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:12.920]  Guess what else is in a halogen family?
[02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:13.840]  Fluoride.
[02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:15.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:19.000]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:22.200]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:25.240]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table
[02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:27.200]  and the results are on record.
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:30.680]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase
[02:06:30.680 --> 02:06:33.560]  in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:35.840]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:40.080]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:42.400]  was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:44.960]  You will find Survival Shield nascent iodine
[02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:47.800]  exclusively at infowarslife.com.
[02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:51.120]  Infowarslife, Survival Shield nascent iodine
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:52.880]  isn't just for emergencies.
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:54.160]  I take it every day.
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:59.160]  That's infowarslife.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:03.840]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself,
[02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:06.520]  our world is becoming more and more toxic
[02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:07.480]  each and every day,
[02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:09.760]  but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:12.320]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times
[02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:15.120]  higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:17.640]  and most Americans spend 90% of their time
[02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:20.400]  inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:23.720]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:26.280]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew
[02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:27.880]  linked to numerous conditions.
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:30.280]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans
[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:32.320]  live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:34.240]  When I began to research these statistics,
[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:37.800]  it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:40.120]  in order to combat the toxic environment
[02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:42.600]  that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:45.400]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:47.160]  and manufactured in the USA.
[02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:49.720]  The new InfoWarsLive Lung Cleanse is here
[02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:52.080]  in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you
[02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:53.720]  throughout any toxic environment.
[02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:56.760]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com
[02:07:56.760 --> 02:08:00.080]  or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:20.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:22.320]  You want answers?
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:23.880]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:34.480]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:36.400]  Well, he's the author of American Empire
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:39.360]  before the fall, his latest book.
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:41.560]  Bruce Fine doesn't toot his horn,
[02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:44.920]  but we need to understand that A, you can be effective,
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:47.920]  you can change things because we have justice
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:49.080]  and free speech on our side.
[02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:52.480]  The moral high ground was back in the 80s
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:55.440]  as the General Counsel of the Federal Communications
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:58.200]  commissioned under President Ronald Reagan
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:00.320]  and the Deputy Attorney General,
[02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:02.520]  Associate Deputy Attorney General,
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:09.440]  as well, he was able to craft the First Amendment case
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:11.800]  and get Congress and the government
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:13.400]  to get rid of the fairness doctrine
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:16.080]  that was properly or wellingly named
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:19.200]  like the Patriot Act and so many other things.
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:21.480]  So the Affordable Care Act that increases
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:23.440]  the cost of health care and wrecks it,
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:25.200]  it's the opposite of that.
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:28.200]  But again, this is the age of 1984 where Obama says
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:30.880]  that the Ukrainian government is duly elected.
[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:33.920]  That's like saying Kim Jong-un is duly elected
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:35.520]  or you can raise the debt ceiling
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:37.640]  and it doesn't raise the debt or you have a business,
[02:09:37.640 --> 02:09:41.240]  you didn't build that or the Benghazi documents
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:44.720]  that came out last week aren't about Benghazi.
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:47.360]  I mean, this is the 1984 world,
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:50.320]  but no one's watching MSNBC.
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:52.480]  Their normal shows have 100,000 top show,
[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:53.800]  half a million, that's nothing.
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:56.520]  We have more than that every 30 minutes here.
[02:09:56.520 --> 02:09:57.640]  Three million a day.
[02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:00.840]  And we're not even in the top five talk show host.
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:03.200]  We're in the top 10.
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:05.760]  So understand, they're not going to let us continue
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:07.560]  to operate with a free open internet.
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:10.200]  They're coming in with net neutrality killers.
[02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:12.320]  They're coming in with this new office
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:14.680]  that got scrapped earlier this year but brought back
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:18.480]  to go inspect all media to see if it's racist.
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:20.360]  That's out of the White House.
[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:23.960]  You got the FCC being, I guess, told by Obama
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:27.600]  and moving in the direction to apply SEC finance rules
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:32.480]  and the head of the, and we're going to our guest,
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:35.440]  the head of the FCC rightfully came out and said,
[02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:37.640]  I'm really concerned about what's being called for here.
[02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:38.960]  So we're not saying they're all bad.
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:40.000]  It's different people.
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.400]  It's like Bruce Fine was in the FCC and he was a good guy.
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:44.080]  He's saying, look, this will affect Drudge
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:46.160]  and other libertarian or conservative media.
[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:47.080]  They're going to apply it.
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:49.960]  And that's what they've been calling for is not,
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:53.560]  if I'm pro-gun, they'll say, well, that's a Republican policy.
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:56.240]  So you can't have your radio show.
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:10:57.640]  We're going to shut you up.
[02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:00.120]  Well, that's asinine.
[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:03.760]  But before 1987, when Bruce Fine got rid of it,
[02:11:06.860 --> 02:11:09.040]  I couldn't have this show.
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:13.360]  So they're trying to bring us back to the past
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:16.720]  and a new electronic Berlin wall or dark age.
[02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:19.440]  Aaron Curtin, Bruce constitutional lawyer,
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:22.280]  thank you for joining us today.
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:26.920]  As you're talking, I'm going to be showing a whole stack
[02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:30.960]  of news dealing with this, but there's so many attacks,
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:34.440]  but even mainstream news is saying,
[02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:37.480]  this is about oligarchs in old media
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:39.600]  wanting to shut down their competition.
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:40.680]  But I think it's too late.
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:43.320]  I mean, even if they shut us down or try,
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:46.720]  they're already been so discredited
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:49.000]  by saying two plus two equals five
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:50.320]  that I don't think you can put
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:51.640]  Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:52.760]  What do you say, sir?
[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:53.720]  No, I think that's true.
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:56.680]  And I feel compelled to just interject this
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:11:59.160]  with your recitation of all the Orwellian statements
[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:01.480]  by President Obama, because you omitted one
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:03.280]  that was dear to my heart since I was born
[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:04.720]  in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:07.320]  where Paul Revere's ride emanated.
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:08.960]  They elicit my children and you shall hear
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:10.320]  of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:12.200]  And you may recall in his speech
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:15.160]  where he announced sort of some cosmetic diminishing
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:18.640]  of the NSA's surveillance of all Americans.
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:22.120]  He attempted to liken Paul Revere
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:24.760]  as the precursor of the national security agency.
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:25.600]  Oh, he said that.
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:26.440]  He said, yeah.
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:28.480]  Well, he talked about Orwellian.
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:30.720]  He didn't understand that Paul Revere
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:33.160]  was spying on the British as a citizen
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:35.840]  and was alerting the people to the government danger.
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:38.360]  He wasn't the government spying on the citizens of the day,
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:42.480]  but that sort of is the high watermark of the Obama
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:44.560]  dissimulation about reality.
[02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:47.320]  But let's go back to the issue that you'd raised, Alex,
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:50.680]  about the fairness doctrine in trying to get the government
[02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:53.680]  to police the communications elements
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:55.960]  of our democratic dispensation.
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:13:00.480]  I was able to get the FCC to revoke the fairness doctrine.
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:04.280]  It wasn't the Congress did it, or we did it on our own,
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:07.960]  because it basically chilled the expression of any speech
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:09.280]  that's viewed as controversial.
[02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:13.800]  And basically, speech that's worth having is controversial.
[02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:16.760]  You don't need speech to utter bromide.
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:21.000]  And after we had revoked it, there
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.320]  were efforts in the Congress, in fact,
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:26.280]  to reinstate it that President Reagan vetoed,
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:27.760]  and the veto was upheld.
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:29.480]  Sure, just to be clear, I was going back
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:32.480]  to just vague memories of the research of that.
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:34.400]  And I knew there were some hearings against it
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:35.720]  that you, I think, were part of.
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:37.240]  And then later, they tried to bring it back.
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:39.600]  And that battle's been going on for a while.
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:40.280]  Yes, that's true.
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:42.920]  And then they had what was called the Flush the Rush
[02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:44.960]  campaign, where there are women's groups
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:49.280]  who are trying to reinstate, excuse me, my cough,
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:51.600]  reinstate the fairness doctrine in order
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:56.000]  to drive conservative talk radio off of the airwaves.
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.480]  And what's being flirted with now,
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:03.400]  the Federal Election Commission, is to remove what is now,
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:06.160]  I think, a First Amendment compelled exemption
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:10.040]  from financial disclosure, financial expenditure laws,
[02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:13.520]  and political campaigns, so that right now, for instance,
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:16.640]  if you're the New York Times, you can editorialize
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:18.720]  in favor against a particular candidate.
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:21.040]  You can plant your reporting in favor against it.
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:23.720]  It can be worth tens of thousands,
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:25.520]  if not millions of dollars.
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:28.360]  And you don't have to report that as a contribution.
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:30.480]  It's not limited by any ceiling.
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:33.040]  There's no particular obligation to explain
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:37.640]  how the money was used to write the editorial or whatever.
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:40.400]  And those First Amendment exemptions
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:45.080]  that are thought implicit in the finance campaign laws
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:47.080]  now are thought, well, really, should we
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:50.920]  keep those exemptions for a drug report, or from Kennedy,
[02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:53.880]  or maybe even persons like you, Alex,
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:58.520]  if you're being too pointed in favoring one candidate
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:00.680]  or political persuasion over another,
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:03.640]  maybe those ought to be viewed as political contributions
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:07.920]  and regulated like a regular monetary donation.
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:09.480]  And that's what's really frightening,
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:11.320]  if that ever came into play.
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:13.000]  Well, I mean, there are arresting governors
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.080]  for crooked toenails, because they're politically involved,
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:16.120]  they're Republican.
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:17.960]  They're arresting Dinesh DeSousa.
[02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:19.760]  Imagine if Michael Moore was arrested.
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:23.520]  I mean, the IRS is already persecuting 10% of the Tea
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:25.120]  Party if you give money.
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:27.080]  They're telling the military, don't be part of the Tea
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:28.680]  Party, you'll be court-martialed.
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:31.120]  I mean, this is real draconian attempts
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:33.960]  to chill free speech, it's outrageous criminality
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:35.320]  in my view.
[02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:38.560]  Well, I think what we may need to bring some lawsuits,
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:40.280]  they're called declaratory judgments
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:43.560]  in order to get First Amendment protection from the court
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:48.920]  before the Orwellian censorship starts to intervene here.
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:52.160]  But there's no doubt that's what the liberal crowd thinks
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:55.080]  that they know how to prescribe what's
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:57.960]  decent and what's fair over the airwaves
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:01.680]  and basically that means becoming an echo chamber of them.
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:03.680]  Now, it was very interesting, I thought,
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:09.120]  that several weeks ago, former Associate Justice John Paul
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:12.560]  Stevens was interviewed with regard
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:16.000]  to his recommendation that various amendments
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.680]  be passed to overcome the Citizens United decision
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:23.640]  giving freedom of corporations and labor
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:26.320]  unions and organizations in general
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:29.720]  to spend limitless amounts of money on their own
[02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:32.280]  to exercise free speech, which we should applaud.
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:34.280]  We should applaud people who want to spend more
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:38.880]  on political speech than selling shaving cream or cosmetics.
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:41.520]  I think that's more healthy for society.
[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:45.280]  And in his proposal, he was asked, well,
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:49.800]  how would that work with regard to the media and newspapers?
[02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:52.600]  Would they not be able to, under this amendment,
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:55.280]  to editorialize in favor against candidates?
[02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:58.600]  And he was positively said, well, hadn't thought about that.
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:03.560]  Maybe he's got to rethink some of his draconian efforts
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:07.040]  to have government circumscribe freedom of speech.
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:10.080]  But I think that's indicative of the liberal viewpoint.
[02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:13.760]  Money is bad unless it supports your particular view
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:15.480]  and then money is fine.
[02:17:15.480 --> 02:17:19.280]  But that's not supposed to work in a liberal society.
[02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:21.640]  You get people who seek to persuade
[02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:25.720]  and they exert their own efforts in single or in combination.
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:28.280]  And let the people decide based upon the argument
[02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:30.440]  that not based upon government putting their thumb
[02:17:30.440 --> 02:17:32.440]  on one side of speech as opposed to another.
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:40.920]  My issue is when you have sensational levels of tyranny
[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:42.920]  and power grabbing going on, we've
[02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:46.160]  gotten slowly basted over time into accepting it
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:49.000]  and kind of gotten the normalcy bias or a mass Stockholm
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:50.000]  syndrome.
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:55.040]  And I think it's important to somehow make a big noise,
[02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:56.920]  show that people understand what we're facing.
[02:17:56.920 --> 02:17:59.200]  I mean, you were successful convincing people
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:01.760]  inside the FCC to change this.
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:03.360]  There was some pressure in Congress.
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:05.760]  Now there's a big move back into it.
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:08.760]  As Congress fills the heat and as MSNBC admits,
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:10.360]  they have basically no viewers.
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:12.800]  What do you and your gut thinks going to happen?
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:16.080]  A, and then B, what can we do to counter all this?
[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:19.400]  Well, first, what can you do to counter it?
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:25.200]  There are ways in which you can petition an agency on your own
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:28.800]  to adopt a rule or to revoke a rule.
[02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:33.000]  And there are under the Administrative Procedure Act,
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:37.720]  each agency has rules that prescribe how you undertake this.
[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:41.280]  But the way we stop it is say right into these agencies,
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:42.680]  right into members of Congress.
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:43.880]  This is an outrage.
[02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:46.480]  You want freedom of speech to remain uncensored
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:50.560]  from any government warping, any government distortions.
[02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:52.920]  And that if they don't take action
[02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:55.840]  to ensure the openness and freedom of speech here,
[02:18:55.840 --> 02:18:58.480]  they'll lose their vote at the next election.
[02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:00.840]  We all have First Amendment rights that need protected,
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:03.920]  just like we have Fourth Amendment rights that were disclosed
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:06.040]  being trampled on by Edward Snow.
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:07.920]  And if they don't have the courage to protect them,
[02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:11.680]  they'll find somebody else who will at the voting booth.
[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:14.400]  And also, it's worthwhile thinking
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:19.200]  of bringing a declaratory judgment action with regard,
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:22.560]  perhaps even to a class action, worried that they're not
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:25.280]  going to hear unfiltered uncensored speech
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:29.080]  and seeking to enjoin these agencies from moving forward,
[02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:33.600]  depending upon how far down they are in the rulemaking process.
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:40.720]  Do you think they'll be successful?
[02:19:40.720 --> 02:19:42.560]  Right now, I think it would be difficult
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:48.160]  because the Republicans still control the House.
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:50.480]  And it would be very difficult, in my mind,
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:53.880]  for any of these agencies to act quickly enough,
[02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:58.640]  given the requirements of process before November.
[02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:02.080]  And at that point, if the Republicans can obtain control
[02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:07.080]  of the Senate, I think we have a veto over any of these agency
[02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:12.200]  adventurism leaps into regulating speech.
[02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:14.760]  But I don't know who knows what will happen in November
[02:20:14.760 --> 02:20:15.640]  on the Senate side.
[02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:18.400]  It's still very dicey.
[02:20:18.400 --> 02:20:20.560]  What's crazy for me is that they were ever
[02:20:20.560 --> 02:20:23.800]  able to get away with the Fairness Doctrine to begin with.
[02:20:23.800 --> 02:20:26.000]  I know you know the history better than most.
[02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:27.000]  Where did it come from?
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:30.680]  How did they ever sneak an openly anti-first amendment
[02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:33.000]  monstrosity in?
[02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:36.680]  Well, the Fairness Doctrine emerged by the FCC.
[02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:41.200]  It wasn't a statutory child in the late 1940s.
[02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:43.480]  And it was at the early stages, Alex,
[02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:45.400]  of radio and television.
[02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:48.400]  And the politicians, they were very worried
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:51.880]  that if they maybe angered radio or TV
[02:20:51.880 --> 02:20:53.680]  that they could be completely destroyed
[02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:55.280]  at the next election.
[02:20:55.280 --> 02:21:00.840]  And it was that fear because it was such a novel media
[02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:05.240]  vehicle that made, I think, the Congress stay back
[02:21:05.240 --> 02:21:10.000]  and not push or try to revoke what the FCC had done.
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:11.320]  But that's what it was.
[02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:15.840]  Well, we don't know how far the media, the radio and television,
[02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:17.960]  could change electoral results.
[02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:22.160]  Therefore, let's keep a government thumb on what
[02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:23.440]  these people do.
[02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:28.280]  And then the first time when it became a focus of Congress
[02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:32.320]  was with the presidential debate in 1960
[02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:35.720]  with Kennedy and Nixon, where you recall there was an issue.
[02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:39.000]  Well, how can you have the debates on a satisfied Fairness
[02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:42.680]  Doctrine because you're only having two candidates, not
[02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:43.800]  all the candidates?
[02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:46.680]  And so Congress passed a special statute
[02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:49.880]  that enabled the two leading presidential candidates
[02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:51.960]  to debate without violating fairness.
[02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:53.160]  And then it's right in there.
[02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:56.000]  It says that nothing, nothing, however, in this statute
[02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:00.680]  shall be construed to override the FCC's Fairness Doctrine
[02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:03.440]  outside the presidential debate category.
[02:22:03.440 --> 02:22:07.840]  And I think at that time, too, the Congress was worried still
[02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:11.080]  in 1960 that the media would have sufficient power
[02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:13.480]  outside of their control, that they'd give them
[02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:17.360]  a complete leash would be too dangerous.
[02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:21.720]  And so they wanted to have some something around the throat
[02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:23.760]  of the media that would make certain they wouldn't
[02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:25.840]  be too critical of the incumbent.
[02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:27.360]  And that was what was going on.
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:28.000]  Sure.
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:31.120]  Constitutional lawyer Bruce Fine joins us right now.
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:34.760]  We've got about eight minutes, six minutes left with him.
[02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:35.960]  I mean, you're a smart guy.
[02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:38.760]  You advise Congress, Ron Paul, Rand Paul, you name it.
[02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:40.840]  In your gut, knowing how the media works,
[02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:43.400]  being in the FCC, watching Washington,
[02:22:43.400 --> 02:22:47.560]  I just don't see how they can stop a renaissance of new media.
[02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:50.440]  But it's almost like the immovable object coming
[02:22:50.440 --> 02:22:53.360]  in contact with an irresistible force.
[02:22:53.360 --> 02:22:56.520]  They need to shut us down or curtail us,
[02:22:56.520 --> 02:23:00.960]  or we will extinct them by nature of free market ideas.
[02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:04.760]  But at the same time, they still have the regulatory control
[02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:07.320]  and the hoarded bureaucratic money
[02:23:07.320 --> 02:23:09.280]  and so many things at their disposal.
[02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:11.600]  So it's like two runaway trains going at each other.
[02:23:11.600 --> 02:23:15.640]  What does your gut tell you is coming in the media landscape?
[02:23:15.640 --> 02:23:18.280]  I want you to think about that while I play this short clip
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:21.200]  of Obama at last weekend's correspondence dinner,
[02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:22.960]  making a joke, kind of like whistling
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:26.520]  past the graveyard politically, about the death
[02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:29.440]  of establishment fascist media opposing
[02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:32.840]  his liberal, AKA MSNBC.
[02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:37.720]  MSNBC is here.
[02:23:37.720 --> 02:23:39.840]  They're a little overwhelmed.
[02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:41.640]  They've never seen an audience this big before.
[02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:53.840]  But look, everybody is trying to keep up
[02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:56.840]  with this incredibly fast-changing new landscape.
[02:23:56.840 --> 02:23:58.200]  And I'll tell you how they're doing it.
[02:23:58.200 --> 02:24:00.200]  They're doing it with government product, propaganda
[02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:02.440]  placement, behavior placements, what they call it,
[02:24:02.440 --> 02:24:06.240]  with hundreds of millions of dollars a year spent
[02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:11.560]  in funding propaganda inside of TV shows, dramas, movies.
[02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:13.440]  That's where the real brainwashing is going.
[02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:14.640]  So how do they get away with saying,
[02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:18.160]  let's get rid of talk radio or Matt Drudge?
[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:20.640]  But at the same time, government agencies
[02:24:20.640 --> 02:24:24.240]  are everywhere funding the view of the government
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:26.680]  through entertainment.
[02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:28.680]  Well, that's the nature of political power.
[02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:29.800]  It's not even handed.
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:33.960]  Indeed, the fairness doctrine was openly
[02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:37.560]  boasted by then Democratic Chairman Larry O'Brien
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:40.880]  in the 60s as a way to get so-called right-wing religious
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:43.360]  broadcasters off the airwaves.
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:46.240]  He was referring to think to Karl McIntyre at the time.
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:49.760]  So he openly was used as a political instrument.
[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:51.960]  That's what politicians do with power,
[02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:54.560]  use it to advance their particular persuasion
[02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:57.440]  at the expense of freedom and the decision
[02:24:57.440 --> 02:25:00.120]  in the American people to decide one way or the other.
[02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:02.120]  Now, he said, what's in the future?
[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:04.760]  It typically, in the regulatory arena, Alex,
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:08.200]  the technology is going to outfox the regulators.
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:10.920]  There'll be so many alternate media vehicles that
[02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:13.840]  comes every cycle, comes shorter and shorter,
[02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:17.040]  going to have new ways to deliver the message and the media.
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:20.080]  I don't think that the law will be able to catch up with it.
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:23.080]  In some ways, that happened to the fairness doctrine, too.
[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:25.200]  It never did apply to cable.
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:26.800]  It never did apply to satellite.
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:29.640]  It was limited to the over-the-air broadcasting.
[02:25:29.640 --> 02:25:32.280]  That's when it began in 1948.
[02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:35.160]  And my view is this is sort of fortunate
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:37.880]  that the regulators are too slow-footed.
[02:25:37.880 --> 02:25:40.480]  They're too glacial-footed in order
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:42.240]  to keep up with the technology, and that
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:44.960]  will enable us to minimize the amount of damage they're
[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:46.960]  able to do through the regulatory process.
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:48.880]  And I'm not endorsing the censorship,
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:52.440]  but that which does not kill us only makes it stronger.
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:55.120]  So many times, innovation comes, as you know,
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:57.560]  from the attempt to censor or block people.
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:25:59.720]  It forces us to adapt and overcome.
[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:01.640]  That is absolutely correct.
[02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:04.400]  And I'd say we're more nimble than the regulators.
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:07.280]  I'd say I've been in government, and lead-footed
[02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:10.560]  is a euphemism for how slow the bureaucracy turns
[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:12.000]  and how backward they are.
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.160]  Even one of the issues right now with regard
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:17.200]  to the NSA surveillance, they're using computers
[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:19.560]  and technology that's 15 years old.
[02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:21.480]  They wouldn't need to keep all this metadata
[02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:23.440]  in their own computers if they'd use something that
[02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:24.920]  was available on the market.
[02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:28.520]  But they're still living in the past, and that's the NSA.
[02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:32.200]  So I'd say, in some sense, that's a saving feature,
[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:36.520]  if you will, of how slow and backward the government is.
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:40.320]  If the pro-human, pro-liberty, pro-human empowerment
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:42.600]  movement is one team, and the control freaks,
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:47.400]  the socialists, the gang members, the thugs of history,
[02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:49.440]  the king rats, or the other team,
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:52.040]  where are we in the Super Bowl game right now?
[02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:53.720]  I mean, I see a huge awakening happening.
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:55.040]  A lot of great things happening.
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:58.560]  But I see government and monopoly capitalist groups
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:02.040]  teaming up together to try to make the public dependent
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:05.320]  and to try to dumb down the culture, aka common core,
[02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:09.280]  to have an in-game where we're as dumb and slow as they are,
[02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:11.960]  and so they finally win.
[02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:15.400]  Well, I think, Alex, we are in peril
[02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:17.520]  because our whole political culture
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:20.000]  is so-called dumb down.
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.400]  And it's not just entertainment.
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:23.720]  It's the schools.
[02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:25.920]  If it was just common core and not
[02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:29.080]  the general degradation of learning, literacy, reading,
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:30.760]  critical thinking, I'd rejoice.
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:33.200]  But it's far more pervasive.
[02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:35.840]  It's the culture itself celebrates
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:38.760]  Honey Boo Boo and not people who read and think.
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:41.360]  And that's got to change if we're
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:42.840]  going to remain a republic.
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:47.000]  You cannot run a democratic dispensation
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:50.000]  unless the people are alert, intelligent, and vigilant
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.560]  over government abuses.
[02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:55.080]  If we're cheap, we get wolves in government.
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:27:55.960]  And that's got it.
[02:27:55.960 --> 02:27:58.040]  We have to change the entire milieu
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:03.200]  of our educational system, our entire standards,
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:05.840]  for who youth should be idolizing.
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:08.360]  And it's not those who are on American Idol,
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:11.280]  it's on those who have moral philosophy and stature,
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:13.640]  if we're going to turn this around before we fall off
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:15.480]  the empire cliff.
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:16.960]  Very well said.
[02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:18.640]  I know you've got a couple of books out.
[02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:21.320]  I've read your latest.
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:23.320]  I guess people can go to Amazon to find that,
[02:28:23.320 --> 02:28:25.360]  or just Google your name, Bruce Fine.
[02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:27.280]  What's the best website for people to visit
[02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:29.000]  if they want to be able to contact you?
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:30.120]  Well, I'm right now.
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:32.120]  I'm building a new website.
[02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:36.520]  But if they go to a Bruce Fine Associates Inc in the Google,
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:39.600]  that's the fastest way to get to me in my law firm
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:41.000]  and speaking and whatever.
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:44.000]  I'm building a whole new website,
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:45.960]  refashioning, rebranding Bruce Fine.
[02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:49.920]  So I hope in another 30 days it'll be easier,
[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:52.200]  more consumer friendly than right now.
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:54.840]  All right, well, listen, thank you so much for the time.
[02:28:54.840 --> 02:28:56.440]  We appreciate you spending it with us.
[02:28:56.440 --> 02:28:57.520]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[02:28:57.520 --> 02:28:58.360]  Have a good day.
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:28:59.720]  All right, there he goes.
[02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:02.960]  And again, that's an example of how government
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:05.120]  can be a tool for good.
[02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:06.720]  Someone who's moral going and saying,
[02:29:06.720 --> 02:29:07.720]  look, this violates the first amendment,
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:09.520]  we gotta get rid of this.
[02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:11.080]  And he took a stand.
[02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:12.880]  And more people in the system need to do that
[02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:15.240]  because we're under corporate governance now.
[02:29:15.240 --> 02:29:17.800]  Corporations run government.
[02:29:17.800 --> 02:29:19.760]  And then they're busy demonizing corporations
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:22.840]  in general so they can shut down all the businesses
[02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:24.200]  and companies they don't control.
[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:28.400]  I mean, it's just public illiteracy about street smarts,
[02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:33.400]  social IQ, everything is in the toilet.
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:37.360]  We have to honor trailblazers and people
[02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:40.000]  that are honorable and inventors.
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.120]  That's what will make us great again,
[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:44.680]  not all these sports icons.
[02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:46.880]  I mean, that's why we're so screwed up, folks.
[02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:49.280]  We honor stuff that doesn't matter.
[02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:50.440]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.440 --> 02:29:53.160]  What a powerful video coming up.
[02:29:53.160 --> 02:29:56.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:01.600]  Alex Jones here to tell you about
[02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:03.760]  how you can help spread liberty worldwide.
[02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:05.320]  I'm also enjoying what I have found
[02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:09.120]  to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:10.440]  For more than a decade,
[02:30:10.440 --> 02:30:11.920]  my favorite coffee has come
[02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:13.880]  from the high mountains of Southern Mexico
[02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:15.280]  where the Chiapas farmers grow
[02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:17.560]  their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:30:17.560 --> 02:30:19.200]  We have now managed to secure
[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:22.400]  the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:30:34.480 --> 02:30:36.400]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:38.280]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee
[02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:40.880]  and it's taken us years to secure connections
[02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:43.400]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:30:43.400 --> 02:30:45.920]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two

[02:31:00.240 --> 02:31:01.600]  The globalist social engineers
[02:31:01.600 --> 02:31:03.600]  are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:31:03.600 --> 02:31:06.040]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:31:06.040 --> 02:31:09.560]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimicers
[02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:12.160]  that lower our testosterone and other hormones
[02:31:12.160 --> 02:31:14.600]  and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:16.880]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists,
[02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:19.040]  pharmacists and others, we have developed
[02:31:19.040 --> 02:31:21.960]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO
[02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:25.040]  organic super male vitality formula
[02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:27.680]  sourced from powerful organic herbs
[02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:30.880]  and then concentrated or maximum potency.
[02:31:30.880 --> 02:31:33.000]  Super male vitality was developed

[02:32:00.280 --> 02:32:02.760]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply
[02:32:02.760 --> 02:32:04.400]  in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:32:04.400 --> 02:32:07.040]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia
[02:32:07.040 --> 02:32:08.680]  had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:32:08.680 --> 02:32:09.960]  What are the health effects
[02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:12.320]  of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:32:12.320 --> 02:32:13.640]  It's forced medical treatment
[02:32:13.640 --> 02:32:15.400]  without the consent of residents.
[02:32:15.400 --> 02:32:18.360]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions
[02:32:18.360 --> 02:32:20.200]  you can take to protect you and your family
[02:32:20.200 --> 02:32:22.960]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:25.600]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate
[02:32:25.600 --> 02:32:26.880]  at least once a week.
[02:32:26.880 --> 02:32:29.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates
[02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.280]  that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:32:31.280 --> 02:32:33.800]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines,
[02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:37.360]  hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:32:37.360 --> 02:32:39.880]  Fluoride is in teeths and coffins and waters
[02:32:39.880 --> 02:32:41.200]  and breads and toothpaste.
[02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:43.960]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:32:43.960 --> 02:32:45.440]  The establishment's not gonna do it.
[02:32:45.440 --> 02:32:46.800]  It's time to take action.
[02:32:46.800 --> 02:32:48.680]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:33:01.120 --> 02:33:06.120]  The 50 years we've told you what to eat,
[02:33:06.440 --> 02:33:08.800]  what to drink, what to wear.
[02:33:08.800 --> 02:33:11.160]  Christ's sake, Ben, don't you understand?
[02:33:11.160 --> 02:33:13.480]  Americans love television.
[02:33:13.480 --> 02:33:15.680]  They wean their kids on it.
[02:33:15.680 --> 02:33:17.320]  Listen, they love game shows.
[02:33:17.320 --> 02:33:18.760]  They love wrestling.
[02:33:18.760 --> 02:33:21.640]  They love sports and violence.
[02:33:21.640 --> 02:33:22.760]  So what do we do?
[02:33:23.840 --> 02:33:25.800]  We give them what they want.
[02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:28.880]  We're number one, Ben.
[02:33:28.880 --> 02:33:30.360]  That's all that counts.
[02:33:30.360 --> 02:33:33.520]  Believe me, I've been in the business 30 years.
[02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:34.880]  Well, I haven't been in show business
[02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:37.120]  as long as you have, Killian.
[02:33:37.120 --> 02:33:39.280]  But I'm a quick learner.
[02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:43.040]  So I'm going to give the audience what I think they want.
[02:33:43.040 --> 02:33:47.280]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:49.560]  and the heart of the Resistance.
[02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:01.960]  We got Russian aircraft carriers
[02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:03.120]  sailing into the English Channel.
[02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:07.080]  They're doing a Topol M Nuke launch drills,
[02:34:07.080 --> 02:34:11.040]  firing test missiles, hitting their targets.
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:11.880]  The Russians are saying,
[02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:13.440]  if anybody attacks any more Russian interests,
[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:16.080]  they're going to go to war with those weapons
[02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:17.640]  that's in the Associated Press.
[02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:20.160]  I think that's a pretty darn big deal.
[02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:24.960]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:28.160]  I want to get into what's really happening
[02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:29.680]  with the economy.
[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:31.600]  I want to get into some other breaking news
[02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:35.920]  up at infowars.com here in just a few minutes.
[02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:39.040]  But first off, we had Yellen,
[02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:41.440]  the head of the Federal Reserve, a clip we played
[02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:43.760]  where she was being grilled, if you could call it that,
[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:46.880]  by Bernie Sanders in the Senate about the oligarchy
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:50.400]  and how we have a ruling financial elite controlling things.
[02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:54.560]  But there he was talking to the head manager
[02:34:54.560 --> 02:34:56.640]  for the private banking oligarchy
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:35:00.600]  that makes the Waltons who are parasitic at many levels
[02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:02.280]  and part of the system look poor.
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:05.760]  You'll scapegoat the Waltons,
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:08.680]  bring up the Koch brothers because they're little fishies.
[02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:11.440]  The Waltons are pretty big fish,
[02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:14.040]  but the Kochs are small fish compared to the Waltons.
[02:35:14.040 --> 02:35:16.600]  They fund both sides, they're globalist.
[02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:19.480]  But the whole point is that,
[02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:21.800]  oh, the Federal Reserve agrees with you,
[02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:26.480]  we might be an oligarchy because of the Koch brothers,
[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:29.160]  and they're 20 billion or whatever,
[02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:31.040]  instead of the trillions of the New World Order,
[02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:32.560]  and what the Federal Reserve's doing,
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:35.120]  giving tens of trillions every year for the globalists,
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:36.920]  the Chinese government buying up our debt,
[02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:40.160]  and how we've been signed on to 1.5 quadrillion.
[02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:45.560]  The plan is for a technological elite to control things
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:49.400]  with dumbed-down city-states being imploded.
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:51.160]  And then any country that doesn't finally go
[02:35:51.160 --> 02:35:53.880]  into the New World Order to be attacked by high-tech
[02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:58.880]  air force systems, this was written almost 100 years ago
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:02.400]  by H.G. Wells and things to come,
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:03.840]  a film was made out of it,
[02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:07.720]  and they describe how you will accept the New World Order
[02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:09.280]  or you will be killed.
[02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:12.760]  And H.G. Wells wrote a nonfiction book,
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:15.880]  The New World Order, describing their plan.
[02:36:16.880 --> 02:36:19.080]  So if you wanna know what it is, look at it,
[02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:21.080]  because the world we're pretty much living in
[02:36:21.080 --> 02:36:24.920]  is the incremental implementation of this plan.
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:26.480]  And we've held it back a lot,
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:27.960]  the globalists aren't invincible,
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:29.080]  they don't control everything,
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:31.160]  they wanna control everything.
[02:36:31.160 --> 02:36:33.320]  They wanna manipulate the whole stock market,
[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:34.360]  they wanna run your life,
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:37.120]  they wanna say your kids belong to them.
[02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:39.760]  And this is the way they've branded the nation-state
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:43.280]  as thugs, as scum, as Texas, as its own country,
[02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:46.640]  and a bunch of redneck gun owners who don't wanna be slaves.
[02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:49.360]  And that's barbarous and that's bad,
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:50.920]  because they're the scientist,
[02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:52.960]  they're the CIA officer, Anderson Cooper,
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:55.440]  and they're gonna go shoot blue screen stuff
[02:36:55.440 --> 02:36:57.440]  at Sandy Hook as he got caught doing,
[02:36:57.440 --> 02:36:59.960]  we don't know what's fake, we just know it's fake,
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:03.000]  and sit up there gentially and disarm everyone,
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:06.120]  while they're armed to the teeth and have armed bodyguards.
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:08.160]  The UN's gonna have the weapons,
[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:12.360]  you're not gonna have the weapons under 7277,
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:14.120]  State Department memorandum.
[02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:16.040]  This whole plan, I mean, I've got an article here,
[02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:17.600]  again, it's back on the news today,
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:21.560]  Chinese militarized police to patrol Paris.
[02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:26.560]  That's in the 7277 that the Chinese military
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:30.080]  will occupy the world after the global collapse
[02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:33.940]  has engineered, after the nuclear war with Russia.
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:37.560]  They're done, they've shut us down,
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:38.680]  they've gotten rid of our jobs,
[02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:40.360]  they're shutting our power plants off,
[02:37:40.360 --> 02:37:42.120]  we're being shut up.
[02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:46.080]  And Scalzen says it's the Chinese, the Russians,
[02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:48.800]  in the West, the Anglo-American establishment,
[02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:51.120]  the Russian crime syndicate, the Chinese crime syndicate.
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:52.560]  Well, the Chinese are double dealing,
[02:37:52.560 --> 02:37:55.360]  but they're deep in Bebo David Rockefeller.
[02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:58.160]  Rockefeller got the deal to get Shankai check thrown out
[02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:01.720]  to put Mao in, and I believe that unison is much closer.
[02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:04.160]  They're using up the Chinese people as the slaves
[02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:08.280]  to leverage out all the jobs, to destroy the Western economy,
[02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:10.560]  and to just totally exterminate the Chinese
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:12.600]  while they're at it with one-jaw policies
[02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:17.480]  and the suicide nets and the mass extermination vans.
[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:19.440]  I mean, I'm saying real things here.
[02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:25.920]  Mass suicide nets, forced drugging, forced abortion,
[02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:30.040]  Falun Gong being executed, execution vans to cut the guts
[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:33.240]  out on the way to the airport to ship it to Japan
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:35.800]  where rich Americans go, I mean, this is off the chart.
[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:38.120]  The way they treat the Chinese, they're gonna treat us.
[02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:40.680]  Your absolute dirt garbage to them,
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:44.840]  and they basically nerve gas you with this vicious dead culture
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:49.160]  to turn you into gibbering trendies who know about twerking
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:53.000]  but don't know about the economy or currency devaluation.
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.560]  A nation of partying idiots
[02:38:55.560 --> 02:38:58.280]  who has no idea their destruction has been prepared.
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:04.280]  Cancer viruses that bond in the RNA into your DNA
[02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:07.480]  and plaques that activate when hormone levels lower
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:10.600]  around the time that you're supposed to leave work
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:12.440]  and to kill you at 65.
[02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:15.200]  Some people though, it retrogrades
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:17.160]  and they get cancer at 15.
[02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:20.760]  I mean, this is all public murdering you and your family
[02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:23.560]  but you'll die 20 years later, you don't know what killed you.
[02:39:25.080 --> 02:39:26.240]  They don't shoot you in the back of the head
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:28.480]  like the Nazis, because you know they're wearing black
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:30.280]  uniforms and got skulls on their hats.
[02:39:30.280 --> 02:39:35.280]  They come going, ah, liberal, oh, let me help you.
[02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:36.520]  Like the villain from cloudy
[02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:39.000]  with a chance of meatballs too.
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:42.800]  Ah, liberal, ah, ooh.
[02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:46.720]  I mean, there's a psycho power goblin, folks.
[02:39:46.720 --> 02:39:49.080]  They know what they're doing and they're coming.
[02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:50.000]  They're not playing games.
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000]  They've almost got the role of their control.
[02:39:53.560 --> 02:39:54.720]  When they get done with the Russians,
[02:39:54.720 --> 02:39:56.720]  they're gonna get ready with everybody else.
[02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:00.080]  They hate Americans 10 times more than they hate the Russians.
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:02.760]  They already put linen in there to gut the Russians
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:06.160]  and slaughter them by the tens of millions and stall them.
[02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:07.680]  The globalists put them in.
[02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:10.720]  They put Mao in and they put the Federal Reserve in
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:13.840]  and they've been slowly waging war and siege against America
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:16.480]  and our values and our property and everything
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:17.640]  and they've almost got us.
[02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:18.920]  They think we're ready.
[02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:21.720]  They think we're done and every FBI agent,
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:24.880]  every police officer, every CIA guy, every minion,
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:26.560]  every bureaucrat, every banker
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:29.400]  that serves this system consciously.
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:32.200]  Every lazy person that laughs at this
[02:40:32.200 --> 02:40:35.240]  and laughs at me in public and that happens sometimes.
[02:40:35.240 --> 02:40:37.200]  You are fools.
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:38.560]  I've told you the truth.
[02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:44.200]  There's a universal law that you be warned.
[02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:45.600]  That's the only reason I've been allowed to live.
[02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:47.120]  I know that now.
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:48.840]  I'm here.
[02:40:48.840 --> 02:40:50.560]  The globalists have left me alone
[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:54.080]  because they understand the universal rule
[02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:58.160]  that they have to be invited in by you.
[02:40:58.160 --> 02:41:00.560]  You have to have heard the truth
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:02.160]  and you have to turn your back on it
[02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:04.520]  and then they can have you.
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:07.120]  You lay down with a bunch of wolves,
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:08.520]  you're gonna get chewed up.
[02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:11.920]  And the wolves are obvious, folks.
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:13.920]  They are snarling and have devoured
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:15.520]  hundreds of millions of people.
[02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:20.360]  262 million killed by government last century.
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:22.120]  Innocent noncombatants.
[02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:25.080]  And you think they just want you to have
[02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:27.600]  a fat, lazy, trendy lifestyle.
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:31.320]  That's only being done till they break your kids down
[02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:33.440]  and then all hell's gonna break loose.
[02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:34.840]  You're gonna lose the prosperity.
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:35.680]  You're gonna lose everything.
[02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:36.920]  And you know it's true.
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:38.640]  You're smart out there.
[02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:39.720]  You're not really dumb.
[02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:42.520]  You've been made experts on mindlessness
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:43.920]  and chemically stunned.
[02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:45.360]  You can come out of it.
[02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:47.160]  You can admit what's going on.
[02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:49.280]  It's not like it's a bunch of work you gotta do.
[02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:50.840]  It's fun to fight, tyranny.
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:58.240]  Now, this piece was called John Cabell versus Alex Jones
[02:41:58.240 --> 02:42:03.240]  when the Operation Paul Revere Contest year and a half ago.
[02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:06.040]  But really it should be called
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:08.480]  the New World Order versus the nation state
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:10.160]  versus the individual.
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:14.600]  Or the New World Order versus the nation state.
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:16.280]  Because once they take it down,
[02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:18.880]  it's not that it's even perfect, but it's old forms.
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:21.680]  You're now wide open, folks, immobilized
[02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:24.480]  where the global spiders can take their time
[02:42:24.480 --> 02:42:27.960]  sucking your soul, dominating you,
[02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:30.200]  planning their flag on you and your family,
[02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:32.800]  destroying your seed forever.
[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:37.800]  Just like at the end of the book in Last of the Mohicans
[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:41.160]  when the bad guy says to the other Native American,
[02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:44.680]  he goes, I'm gonna kill you and kill your seed.
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:46.400]  He tells the European,
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:50.200]  I'm gonna kill you and your children and kill your seed.
[02:42:50.200 --> 02:42:51.480]  I'm gonna scorch your earth.
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:53.280]  I'm gonna salt your earth.
[02:42:53.280 --> 02:42:55.200]  I'm gonna take everything down.
[02:42:55.200 --> 02:42:58.400]  That's a relation, and that's the spirit of the globalists
[02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:02.520]  is just raw murder, raw power, raw evil.
[02:43:04.280 --> 02:43:05.160]  Look at history.
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:08.320]  Our government, illegitimate,
[02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:13.320]  put Mao Zedong in to kill 84 million Chinese.
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:15.000]  That's the Chinese government's own numbers.
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:20.000]  84 mil, 84 mil, 84 mil.
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.400]  84 mil.
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:26.600]  Imagine I said 84 million, 84 million times.
[02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:27.680]  It would take years.
[02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:33.600]  How many sports stadiums of 100,000 people is 84 mil?
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:35.920]  And the globalists go, oh, terrorists killed us.
[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:36.760]  Give your rights up.
[02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:39.880]  Oh, oh, your children, we love you.
[02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:50.440]  Oh, yeah, they love you all right.
[02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:51.640]  You gonna let them do this?
[02:43:53.480 --> 02:43:55.080]  Because you're signing your own death warrant.
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:57.480]  Every one of you that works for the system is delusional.
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:44:00.360]  You sign on to the science team of the New World Order
[02:44:00.360 --> 02:44:03.440]  to secure the earth, stabilize populations,
[02:44:03.440 --> 02:44:04.640]  a reasonable plan.
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:06.200]  Humans are like a parasite.
[02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:08.880]  We're scientific and know they have to be removed.
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:10.640]  You're gonna be removed.
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:12.880]  Be honest like Dr. Pyonka at UT that says
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:14.880]  when the airborne Ebola is released to go 90% of the
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:17.320]  population, he's ready for him and his family to die.
[02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:18.400]  They're not even worthy to live.
[02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:22.520]  At least he has been let in on the full plan
[02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:25.360]  and flies to England everywhere to meet with royalty.
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:27.480]  They go, you're so good, you're ready to die for us?
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:29.640]  Yes, I'm ready to die for you.
[02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:32.400]  Oh, good Dr. Pyonka.
[02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:36.400]  Oh, good Dr. Pyonka.
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:38.400]  Trendy.
[02:44:40.400 --> 02:44:42.400]  Maybe we can find the villain after this clip from
[02:44:42.400 --> 02:44:44.400]  Claudia with a chance at meatballs too.
[02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:48.400]  Who symbolizes DARPA, who gets all the research,
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:50.400]  all the data from everybody, brings it in,
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:53.400]  compartmentalizes and controls everyone.
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:56.400]  And wants to harvest the live forms of the earth
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:44:59.400]  to feed itself while claiming it's for the environment.
[02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:01.400]  Oh, it's for the Earth, environmentally sensitive.
[02:45:01.400 --> 02:45:03.400]  Murder everyone immediately.
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:09.400]  They said, sir, Lennon, we're killing entire families,
[02:45:09.400 --> 02:45:10.400]  entire villages.
[02:45:10.400 --> 02:45:11.400]  How many more do you want?
[02:45:11.400 --> 02:45:12.400]  I want more people dead.
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:13.400]  I want blood.
[02:45:13.400 --> 02:45:14.400]  I need blood.
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:16.400]  So let's go ahead and go to this report,
[02:45:16.400 --> 02:45:18.400]  and I think it illustrates it all,
[02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:20.400]  illustrating my shell between Pierce Morgan,
[02:45:20.400 --> 02:45:22.400]  where he represents the globalist I represent,
[02:45:22.400 --> 02:45:24.400]  the nation state that's not perfect,
[02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:27.400]  but is least as human.
[02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:35.400]  Let's go to it.
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:37.400]  For some time when listening to the passionate,
[02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:40.400]  greeny voice of Alex Jones,
[02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:42.400]  rallying against the growing shadow
[02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:45.400]  of a totalitarian New World Order,
[02:45:45.400 --> 02:45:48.400]  there's been a growing feeling of deja vu.
[02:45:48.400 --> 02:45:50.400]  Somewhere in the memory hole,
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:53.400]  there was a strikingly similar attitude
[02:45:53.400 --> 02:45:57.400]  and almost theatrical, raspy, rapid-fire voice heard
[02:45:57.400 --> 02:46:02.400]  in a nearly forgotten sci-fi film from the mid-1930s.
[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:05.400]  It wasn't until watching the gun control debate
[02:46:05.400 --> 02:46:08.400]  between Alex and the imperious,
[02:46:08.400 --> 02:46:13.400]  insufferable Pierce Morgan that the pieces fell together.
[02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:17.400]  The film featuring a distorted Alex Jones prototype
[02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:19.400]  was Things to Come,
[02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:23.400]  based on the science fiction novel by futurist H.G. Wells,
[02:46:23.400 --> 02:46:26.400]  the shape of Things to Come.
[02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:29.400]  Since Wells is often credited with coining the term
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:31.400]  New World Order,
[02:46:31.400 --> 02:46:35.400]  and Alex Jones is the leading pop culture opponent
[02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:37.400]  of the New World Order,
[02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:41.400]  the two men have in a sense already met.
[02:46:41.400 --> 02:46:44.400]  From Things to Come, a grainy old movie
[02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:47.400]  that had long ago fallen into the public domain,
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:50.400]  rise the images of a flawed,
[02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:55.400]  but passionate nationalist resister known as the Chief,
[02:46:55.400 --> 02:47:00.400]  and the pompous, imperious elitist by the unsubtle name
[02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:03.400]  of John Cabal.
[02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:07.400]  John Cabal heads a new technocratic proto-world government,
[02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:11.400]  and the Chief runs the last nation-state.
[02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:12.400]  In parallel,
[02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:17.400]  Pierce Morgan represents a powerful elitist world-propaganda empire,
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:20.400]  while Alex Jones is the tip of the spear
[02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:24.400]  of a grassroots nationalist new media.
[02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:27.400]  Cabal and the Chief fight a hot war,
[02:47:27.400 --> 02:47:32.400]  while Morgan and Jones fight a world info war.
[02:47:32.400 --> 02:47:37.400]  Sadly, no really high-quality prints of Things to Come exist,
[02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:40.400]  but the film is one of the most important movies
[02:47:40.400 --> 02:47:43.400]  to come out of pre-World War II England,
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:46.400]  not because it is particularly good film,
[02:47:46.400 --> 02:47:50.400]  but because it is such an amazing New World Order blueprint,
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:54.400]  a frontal assault on the idea of sovereign nations,
[02:47:54.400 --> 02:47:58.400]  religion, liberty, and individual ambition.
[02:47:58.400 --> 02:48:01.400]  It is also amazing because it has some of the greatest talent
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:04.400]  and most lavish production values
[02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:07.400]  available at the time applied to its production.
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:10.400]  Perhaps it is not a great film as cinema
[02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:13.400]  because its makers were true believers,
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:17.400]  too close and too sympathetic to its propaganda messaging
[02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:22.400]  to be objective about the film as art.
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:26.400]  In short, Things to Come is the story of a transition
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:30.400]  through a war from a world of individual nation-states
[02:48:30.400 --> 02:48:34.400]  to a futuristic vision of a world run by a technocratic class
[02:48:34.400 --> 02:48:39.400]  whose focus is spreading an elite core of humanity to the stars
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:42.400]  rather than being particularly concerned with the petty needs
[02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:45.400]  and rights of individuals.
[02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:48.400]  The action takes place in the near future, 1940,
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:54.400]  an intermediate future, 1970, and a distant future, 2036.
[02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:59.400]  In a representative community aptly dubbed Every Town,
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:04.400]  Things to Come embodies, it really reeks of the truism
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:09.400]  that socialist elitists love humanity but hate people.
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:12.400]  That certainly sums up the mindset of the main character
[02:49:12.400 --> 02:49:15.400]  of Things to Come, John Cabal,
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:20.400]  and, of course, his spiritual heir, Piers Morgan.
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:23.400]  As a direct result of decades of devastating war,
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:26.400]  Every Town is eventually taken over
[02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:30.400]  by a warlord gangster capitalist named the Chief.
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:34.400]  After becoming disillusioned with the existing order
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:37.400]  and the conflict inherent in free societies,
[02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:42.400]  we now see the middle-aged version of John Cabal
[02:49:42.400 --> 02:49:45.400]  as a kind of a visitor from space,
[02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:47.400]  actually a subterranean headquarters
[02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:50.400]  in of all places oil-rich Iraq.
[02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:55.400]  Cabal is back in Every Town to lay down the law to the Chief
[02:49:55.400 --> 02:49:57.400]  that the days of the nation-state,
[02:49:57.400 --> 02:50:01.400]  private enterprise, and self-interest are over.
[02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:04.400]  Cabal has been busy organizing the New World Order
[02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:08.400]  using science, I guess very much like Nazi Germany,
[02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:11.400]  to build an irresistible futuristic air fleet
[02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:14.400]  and demands that the Chief relent,
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:17.400]  in other words, surrender or else.
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:20.400]  The or else is the so-called gas of peace,
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:23.400]  dropped from Cabal's massive bombers,
[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:26.400]  which is supposed to knock opponents out.
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:30.400]  Strangely, it winds up being fatal to only one person,
[02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:32.400]  the gun-toting Chief.
[02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:35.400]  Well, the rest of the rabble seems to have...
[02:50:35.400 --> 02:50:37.400]  We're going to go to break, come back with more of it,
[02:50:37.400 --> 02:50:39.400]  but it's 18 minutes long.
[02:50:39.400 --> 02:50:42.400]  We'll post the full video tonight to m4wars.com.
[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:45.400]  Notice the gas of peace is in eco science,
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:47.400]  but the White House science are.
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:50.400]  It's called fluoride, and it teaches you to have a lower IQ,
[02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:53.400]  a fertility, and to be an idiot.
[02:50:53.400 --> 02:50:56.400]  And they brag they did it on purpose, so enjoy, drink up, folks.
[02:50:56.400 --> 02:50:59.400]  Take your shots.
[02:50:59.400 --> 02:51:02.400]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in
[02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:04.400]  by an intruder with a single kick.
[02:51:04.400 --> 02:51:07.400]  Criminals know that your wooden door frames are weak,
[02:51:07.400 --> 02:51:10.400]  and your alarm system can't keep them out.
[02:51:10.400 --> 02:51:14.400]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the door sentinel.
[02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:16.400]  Standard locks, dead bolts and alarm systems
[02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:18.400]  can't prevent forced entry.
[02:51:18.400 --> 02:51:21.400]  Open your door and door jam with a door sentinel.
[02:51:21.400 --> 02:51:23.400]  Protect your home now at MySafeDoor.com.

[02:51:56.400 --> 02:51:58.400]  Just won't quit.
[02:51:58.400 --> 02:52:00.400]  Attention America.
[02:52:00.400 --> 02:52:02.400]  Within a little-known government document
[02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:05.400]  is devastating information that could cost the United States
[02:52:05.400 --> 02:52:07.400]  its most valuable asset.
[02:52:07.400 --> 02:52:09.400]  My name is Jeff Oppdike,
[02:52:09.400 --> 02:52:11.400]  former reporter for The Wall Street Journal.
[02:52:11.400 --> 02:52:13.400]  I've uncovered shocking evidence
[02:52:13.400 --> 02:52:16.400]  within the details of document FT-900,
[02:52:16.400 --> 02:52:20.400]  revealing the largest cover-up of President Obama's career.
[02:52:20.400 --> 02:52:23.400]  This will have a substantial impact on our nation.
[02:52:23.400 --> 02:52:27.400]  Millions of Americans will fall into poverty overnight.
[02:52:27.400 --> 02:52:30.400]  A recent report from the Treasury Department said
[02:52:30.400 --> 02:52:32.400]  an event of this nature has, quote,
[02:52:32.400 --> 02:52:34.400]  the potential to be catastrophic.
[02:52:34.400 --> 02:52:36.400]  Within a matter of weeks,
[02:52:36.400 --> 02:52:39.400]  the way of life for millions of Americans will be destroyed
[02:52:39.400 --> 02:52:43.400]  and the standard of living will be like nothing this country has seen
[02:52:43.400 --> 02:52:45.400]  in nearly a century.
[02:52:45.400 --> 02:52:47.400]  To learn how you can protect yourself and your family
[02:52:47.400 --> 02:52:49.400]  from this government attack,
[02:52:49.400 --> 02:52:53.400]  visit www.obamasecret1.com.
[02:52:53.400 --> 02:53:20.400]  Again, that's www.obamasecret1.com.
[02:53:23.400 --> 02:53:27.400]  That's www.obamasecret1.com.
[02:53:53.400 --> 02:53:58.400]  844-trylife.com
[02:54:23.400 --> 02:54:28.400]  www.obamasecret1.com
[02:54:53.400 --> 02:54:58.400]  www.obamasecret1.com
[02:55:23.400 --> 02:55:29.400]  www.obamasecret1.com
[02:55:53.400 --> 02:55:58.400]  www.obamasecret1.com
[02:56:23.400 --> 02:56:26.400]  Who also played A. Blinken and John Brown,
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:30.400]  all dour fanatics with a messianic complex
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:33.400]  and a determination to bend the world to their own view,
[02:56:33.400 --> 02:56:36.400]  regardless of the human toll.
[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:39.400]  The chief responds to Cabal's ultimatum
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:41.400]  by taking him prisoner,
[02:56:41.400 --> 02:56:43.400]  but not before a heated confrontation
[02:56:43.400 --> 02:56:45.400]  between the two world views.
[02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:47.400]  The first thing we should want
[02:56:47.400 --> 02:56:49.400]  is to get our planes in the air again.
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:51.400]  Right. Unaudible ambition.
[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:54.400]  Because our new order has an objection to private airplanes.
[02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:55.400]  The impudence.
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:56:57.400]  I'm not talking about private airplanes.
[02:56:57.400 --> 02:57:00.400]  Our airplanes are public airplanes.
[02:57:00.400 --> 02:57:03.400]  This is an independent sovereign state at war.
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:06.400]  I know nothing about any old order.
[02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:08.400]  I'm the chief here,
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:12.400]  and I'm not taking any orders old or new from you.
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:14.400]  I suppose I've walked into trouble.
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:16.400]  Yeah, you can take that as right.
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:18.400]  We have some hundreds of new type planes
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:20.400]  that we're building more, fast.
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:22.400]  We're gradually restoring order and trade
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:24.400]  in the whole Mediterranean area.
[02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:26.400]  We're scouting this region now to see how things are.
[02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:28.400]  You'll find out.
[02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:30.400]  This is an independent sovereign state.
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:32.400]  Yes, we must talk about that.
[02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:34.400]  We don't discuss it.
[02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:36.400]  We don't approve of independent sovereign states.
[02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:38.400]  You don't approve.
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:39.400]  We mean to stop them.
[02:57:39.400 --> 02:57:41.400]  That's war, if you will.
[02:57:43.400 --> 02:57:46.400]  Well, I think we know how we stand.
[02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:50.400]  Let's move. Take this, man.
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:52.400]  It gives you any trouble? Club him.
[02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:53.400]  You hear that?
[02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:55.400]  It's the wings over your wits.
[02:57:55.400 --> 02:57:58.400]  My friends know my whereabouts.
[02:57:58.400 --> 02:57:59.400]  That's good.
[02:57:59.400 --> 02:58:01.400]  Now, the point is,
[02:58:01.400 --> 02:58:03.400]  the globalists go overthrow countries to put al-Qaeda in charge
[02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:05.400]  to wreck civilization.
[02:58:05.400 --> 02:58:07.400]  They want to teach kids 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:58:07.400 --> 02:58:09.400]  They're the ones that want barbarism for you
[02:58:09.400 --> 02:58:11.400]  while they live in armored fortresses
[02:58:11.400 --> 02:58:13.400]  and you don't know how to talk,
[02:58:13.400 --> 02:58:15.400]  or all you care about is Justin Bieber
[02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:18.400]  or who's that other idiot?
[02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:20.400]  Hannah Montana, whatever her name is.
[02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:22.400]  They want you to only know about that
[02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:23.400]  and really think that's important,
[02:58:23.400 --> 02:58:25.400]  reading all these women's magazines
[02:58:25.400 --> 02:58:26.400]  and all the rest of it.
[02:58:26.400 --> 02:58:27.400]  Miley Cyrus.
[02:58:27.400 --> 02:58:30.400]  Meanwhile, the globalists are trying to take down Russia,
[02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:32.400]  seeing Putin as the chief.
[02:58:32.400 --> 02:58:34.400]  We're not romanticizing the chief.
[02:58:34.400 --> 02:58:37.400]  It's just the globalists are the worst cancer there is,
[02:58:37.400 --> 02:58:39.400]  ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:39.400 --> 02:58:41.400]  They're not civilization.
[02:58:41.400 --> 02:58:44.400]  Overdrive coming up in FullWars.com for its last show.
[02:58:44.400 --> 02:58:47.400]  I'm going to do a five extra on a few stories we didn't hit.
[02:58:47.400 --> 02:59:16.400]  I promise to cover Stay With Us.
[02:59:17.400 --> 02:59:20.400]  And employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:59:20.400 --> 02:59:23.400]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:59:23.400 --> 02:59:25.400]  And that's why I stock my pantry
[02:59:25.400 --> 02:59:28.400]  with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriot Supply.

[03:00:00.400 --> 03:00:09.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:00:09.400 --> 03:00:11.400]  You want answers?
[03:00:11.400 --> 03:00:13.400]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.400 --> 03:00:17.400]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.400 --> 03:00:29.400]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:29.400 --> 03:00:31.400]  You got to build their world government.
[03:00:31.400 --> 03:00:34.400]  They got to get rid of the old system.
[03:00:34.400 --> 03:00:37.400]  They got to put Mao Zedong into kill 84 million people.
[03:00:37.400 --> 03:00:39.400]  David Rockefeller wrote when Mao died in the New York Times,
[03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:41.400]  he did a great job.
[03:00:41.400 --> 03:00:43.400]  That was just a wonderful leader, a wonderful person.
[03:00:43.400 --> 03:00:45.400]  He was actually a total degenerate monster.
[03:00:45.400 --> 03:00:47.400]  I'm not going to get into all his personal habits.
[03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:49.400]  Or the 80 plus million people he killed.
[03:00:49.400 --> 03:00:52.400]  But he's globalist, revel in control.
[03:00:52.400 --> 03:00:55.400]  More business is shutting down than starting up.
[03:00:55.400 --> 03:00:56.400]  Weekly standard.
[03:00:56.400 --> 03:00:59.400]  Business' depths now exceed business' births
[03:00:59.400 --> 03:01:02.400]  for the first time in modern history.
[03:01:02.400 --> 03:01:04.400]  The weekly standard.
[03:01:04.400 --> 03:01:07.400]  Mark Fauber says, I don't trust anyone.
[03:01:07.400 --> 03:01:09.400]  Hold gold outside the U.S.
[03:01:09.400 --> 03:01:12.400]  and basically have an exit strategy so they don't see NBC.
[03:01:12.400 --> 03:01:15.400]  The U.S. government will steal anything you got inside of it.
[03:01:15.400 --> 03:01:17.400]  I mean, that's pretty mainline.
[03:01:17.400 --> 03:01:19.400]  Who's been on the show.
[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:21.400]  And it's one of the top experts in the world saying,
[03:01:21.400 --> 03:01:24.400]  we're an authoritarian hell pit.
[03:01:24.400 --> 03:01:27.400]  Economy not keeping up with population growth.
[03:01:27.400 --> 03:01:29.400]  8 million added to working population.
[03:01:29.400 --> 03:01:31.400]  Half a million fewer jobs.
[03:01:31.400 --> 03:01:33.400]  So the country's dying.
[03:01:33.400 --> 03:01:36.400]  So that's the new world order for you.
[03:01:36.400 --> 03:01:38.400]  Private airplanes?
[03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:40.400]  We don't allow it.
[03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:41.400]  Private homes?
[03:01:41.400 --> 03:01:44.400]  Germany just banned any new construction of family homes?
[03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:45.400]  We don't allow it.
[03:01:45.400 --> 03:01:47.400]  Stoves, fireplaces?
[03:01:47.400 --> 03:01:49.400]  Now being banned in areas in California?
[03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:51.400]  We don't allow it.
[03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:52.400]  Families?
[03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:53.400]  We don't allow it.
[03:01:53.400 --> 03:01:54.400]  IQs?
[03:01:54.400 --> 03:01:55.400]  We don't allow it.
[03:01:55.400 --> 03:01:56.400]  Health?
[03:01:56.400 --> 03:01:57.400]  We don't allow it.
[03:01:57.400 --> 03:01:58.400]  Except for the globalist.
[03:01:58.400 --> 03:02:00.400]  Who parade around.
[03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:02.400]  We care about you.
[03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:05.400]  I did have an experience where on the first day of class,
[03:02:05.400 --> 03:02:08.400]  a professor told all of the Ted Cruz supporting teabaggers
[03:02:08.400 --> 03:02:10.400]  to get the hell out of his classroom
[03:02:10.400 --> 03:02:13.400]  before he sent us home to our mothers in a body bag.
[03:02:13.400 --> 03:02:14.400]  Free speech?
[03:02:14.400 --> 03:02:16.400]  We don't allow it.
[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:18.400]  Net neutrality?
[03:02:18.400 --> 03:02:20.400]  We don't allow it.
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:21.400]  Wanna own guns?
[03:02:21.400 --> 03:02:22.400]  You're a racist.
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:25.400]  We don't allow it.
[03:02:25.400 --> 03:02:28.400]  Oh, there's a EPA's wood burning stove ban
[03:02:28.400 --> 03:02:31.400]  that has chilling consequences for many rural people.
[03:02:31.400 --> 03:02:34.400]  Want to heat your home without paying us?
[03:02:34.400 --> 03:02:37.400]  We don't allow it.
[03:02:37.400 --> 03:02:40.400]  Is the IMF preparing for dollar collapse?
[03:02:40.400 --> 03:02:42.400]  Omega shock breaks it down.
[03:02:42.400 --> 03:02:44.400]  Looks like they're preparing for the new SDR move.
[03:02:44.400 --> 03:02:47.400]  Administration to pledge equal education for illegal immigrants?
[03:02:47.400 --> 03:02:48.400]  Yes.
[03:02:48.400 --> 03:02:50.400]  Can I go to Mexico and have free college?
[03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:52.400]  Or have a baby for free?
[03:02:52.400 --> 03:02:53.400]  No, I can't.
[03:02:53.400 --> 03:02:55.400]  But I'm a racist.
[03:02:55.400 --> 03:02:57.400]  I'm against people's omega.
[03:02:57.400 --> 03:02:58.400]  No, I'm not.
[03:02:58.400 --> 03:03:03.400]  I'm against the globalist plan to bankrupt and shut down the country.
[03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:06.400]  If I went into Mexico and sit on my wife's chair where she had the baby,
[03:03:06.400 --> 03:03:10.400]  they'd say, for free, we don't allow it.
[03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:12.400]  But wait, we allow it to America.
[03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:15.400]  That's for you.
[03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:18.400]  Continuing Operation Monsanto Stock Plunge,
[03:03:18.400 --> 03:03:21.400]  Big Monsanto Stock Dump Friday, May 9th.
[03:03:21.400 --> 03:03:23.400]  That's at prisonplanet.com.
[03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:25.400]  Check that out.
[03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:32.400]  And a lot of other news here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:03:32.400 --> 03:03:34.400]  I mean, now they lock everything down.
[03:03:34.400 --> 03:03:36.400]  Oh, there was someone at the military base.
[03:03:36.400 --> 03:03:37.400]  Lockdown.
[03:03:37.400 --> 03:03:39.400]  White House security breach appears to be an honest mistake.
[03:03:39.400 --> 03:03:43.400]  It seems at the point to be an honest mistake and cause a lockdown.
[03:03:43.400 --> 03:03:46.400]  We're all just taught about how we're locking everyone down.
[03:03:46.400 --> 03:03:48.400]  That's when you live in a prison.
[03:03:48.400 --> 03:03:52.400]  Someone was seen in a rural area with a gun walking in camouflage.
[03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:53.400]  They're probably a terrorist.
[03:03:53.400 --> 03:03:58.400]  We're locking the county down for your safety in the whole county in Nevada.
[03:03:58.400 --> 03:04:01.400]  No one's allowed to have free speech for your safety.
[03:04:01.400 --> 03:04:05.400]  We don't allow it.
[03:04:05.400 --> 03:04:10.400]  And we're going to shoot you if you walk down the street.
[03:04:10.400 --> 03:04:17.400]  Because we don't allow it.
[03:04:17.400 --> 03:04:25.400]  What is this people fighting over a table?
[03:04:25.400 --> 03:04:29.400]  That's a journalist in Jordan. I like it.
[03:04:29.400 --> 03:04:31.400]  Shitting around the table being nice?
[03:04:31.400 --> 03:04:33.400]  We don't allow it.
[03:04:33.400 --> 03:04:35.400]  We're in control.
[03:04:35.400 --> 03:04:37.400]  We're liberal.
[03:04:37.400 --> 03:04:38.400]  We have the moral high ground.
[03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:40.400]  We're trendy.
[03:04:40.400 --> 03:04:43.400]  Got a super model girlfriend?
[03:04:43.400 --> 03:04:45.400]  You must be wearing a dress then.
[03:04:45.400 --> 03:04:48.400]  You know the whole food, just like guys walking around like,
[03:04:48.400 --> 03:04:49.400]  Ugh, and dresses.
[03:04:49.400 --> 03:04:51.400]  Those are super model girlfriends.
[03:04:51.400 --> 03:04:52.400]  That's the new trendy thing.
[03:04:52.400 --> 03:04:53.400]  We're homeless.
[03:04:53.400 --> 03:04:55.400]  We're garbage dump.
[03:04:55.400 --> 03:05:00.400]  We're learning how to be slaves of the New World Order.
[03:05:00.400 --> 03:05:05.400]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday?
[03:05:05.400 --> 03:05:07.400]  We don't allow it.
[03:05:07.400 --> 03:05:08.400]  The police are shoving people.
[03:05:08.400 --> 03:05:09.400]  They're shoving Alex.
[03:05:09.400 --> 03:05:10.400]  They're shoving the crowd.
[03:05:10.400 --> 03:05:13.400]  Obama told Africans, what cars?
[03:05:13.400 --> 03:05:15.400]  We don't allow it.
[03:05:15.400 --> 03:05:17.400]  What are you conditioning?
[03:05:17.400 --> 03:05:19.400]  We don't allow it.
[03:05:19.400 --> 03:05:25.400]  For anyone but us, it's a quality man.
