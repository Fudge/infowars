[00:00.000 --> 00:29.840]  It's Sunday September 12th the year is 2021 and as dark as these days are the
[00:29.840 --> 00:37.520]  sun of truth and justice is beginning to rise. The globalists are now out in the open with
[00:37.520 --> 00:44.480]  a agenda of total power and control. Many of you are asking why are they so bold? These vaccines
[00:44.480 --> 00:49.040]  aren't vaccines. They're causing heart attacks and deaths. They don't even work. The majority of
[00:49.040 --> 00:53.840]  people that are sick have had the injections and are now finding out about it. Why are they creating
[00:53.840 --> 01:00.480]  so much anger, so much fear? And the answer is divide and conquer. That's why they're using racial
[01:00.480 --> 01:07.680]  division, cultural division, division of the sexes and now you've got Biden and all the surrogates
[01:07.680 --> 01:15.120]  not just here but in Australia and around the world in the UK, in Canada, in Europe saying
[01:15.120 --> 01:22.080]  if you don't take the shot the lockdown's not going to end and people are angry at you that
[01:22.080 --> 01:26.640]  haven't taken the shot. It's your fault people are sick and people are about to really get in your
[01:26.640 --> 01:33.600]  face and come after you. We're going to play a clip of a federal senator right now in Australia
[01:33.600 --> 01:39.840]  literally invoking attacks on the people and remember what Biden said last Thursday. He said my
[01:39.840 --> 01:45.360]  patience is running out. This is your pandemic. This is an information war so they're going past
[01:45.360 --> 01:50.640]  political correctness and say get rid of America and America should be abolished and they're moving
[01:50.640 --> 01:54.960]  directly now to you should be attacked, you should be put in a camp, you should be taken away
[01:54.960 --> 02:00.320]  because you won't take the shots. It's here. This is their pretext to send out the contact
[02:00.320 --> 02:04.720]  tracers run by the Clinton Foundation here in the US and other groups around the world
[02:04.720 --> 02:11.520]  to literally set up a total medical tyranny against the human population. So here is the
[02:11.520 --> 02:17.200]  clip of the federal senator to kick off the show that Owen Schroyer is taking over and I'm interviewing
[02:17.200 --> 02:22.800]  a father here in Austin who lost his son from heart swelling and a heart attack at age 16
[02:23.360 --> 02:28.320]  after he took the Moderna shot. So it's all coming up on this Sunday broadcast. You are the info
[02:28.320 --> 02:33.520]  war. You can override the enemy but you must share the live feed right now. You must tell people
[02:33.520 --> 02:40.000]  the truth lives at Band-Op Video and you must say no to the globalists now while you still can.
[02:40.000 --> 02:46.800]  I think people are getting quite agitated right out there now outside Pete and those
[02:46.800 --> 02:52.000]  anti-vaxxers out there that 20-30% are the ones out there protesting on the streets and doing
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.080]  that sort of thing. I think you're going to find the rest of us coming at you lock, stock and barrel
[02:56.080 --> 02:59.520]  and we're going to be putting the pressure on you fairly hard because the rest of us that are
[02:59.520 --> 03:05.040]  trying to do the right thing by the country and our kids and get vaccinated and do the right thing.
[03:05.040 --> 03:09.600]  I think for you we're going to start to get even more agitated and we're going
[03:09.600 --> 03:12.960]  to start to get more hardcore and I think that's what you're going to see massive division out
[03:12.960 --> 03:17.040]  there and it'll be us on the front foot. That's what I think is going to happen. I think the
[03:17.040 --> 03:21.200]  tide is going to turn on those anti-vaxxers out there and you are really going to feel the heat.
[03:21.200 --> 03:31.520]  You've been patient but our patience is wearing thin.
[03:36.640 --> 03:45.040]  So these are the leaders, the supposed leaders of the free world reminding you where you stand
[03:45.040 --> 03:55.360]  in society, where you stand in civilization. You are a slave. You do not have medical freedom.
[03:56.640 --> 04:00.480]  Hell, in many places around the world you don't really have any freedom at all
[04:01.680 --> 04:07.120]  and in the United States of America you don't have free speech and now you have a president
[04:07.120 --> 04:15.680]  that is scolding you and other members of our government scolding you and Hollywood
[04:15.680 --> 04:21.120]  and entertainment coming out and saying screw your freedoms. This isn't about freedom.
[04:22.240 --> 04:26.480]  Imagine the president of the United States scolding the American people and telling them
[04:26.480 --> 04:33.440]  it's not about freedom. Actually that's all it's about. That's actually everything. It's all about
[04:33.440 --> 04:43.920]  freedom. But America is finally starting to see the true face of corruption and the true face of
[04:43.920 --> 04:50.640]  lawlessness, corrupt politics, criminal politics that's been around for decades. In one picture
[04:50.640 --> 04:55.920]  with the Clintons and the Obamas and the Bushes and the Bidens all at that 9-11 ceremony,
[04:55.920 --> 05:04.240]  Trump wasn't there. That was a smart move. It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had
[05:04.240 --> 05:09.840]  satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere. But if you look at
[05:09.840 --> 05:13.360]  all the different studies and reports about my NASA and other governments and other agencies,
[05:14.320 --> 05:19.200]  they all disagree on what's really happening with climate. The only constant, the only great truth is
[05:19.200 --> 05:26.160]  change is the only constant. So yes, climate change is totally real. But notice first they
[05:26.160 --> 05:30.240]  called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s and then there's going to be global warming and
[05:30.240 --> 05:34.560]  when that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to. Okay, now it's just climate change. But did
[05:34.560 --> 05:40.640]  you know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and
[05:40.640 --> 05:46.720]  the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN? They have weather control trees from 1979.
[05:46.720 --> 05:51.760]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time. In fact, back in 1994,
[05:51.760 --> 05:56.080]  two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines
[05:56.080 --> 05:59.280]  to control the weather. So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[05:59.280 --> 06:17.600]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[06:17.600 --> 06:31.120]  so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[06:31.120 --> 06:40.480]  Live with you in studio on this Sunday, September 12, 2021. But we've got a lot of important
[06:40.480 --> 06:46.400]  emergency reports coming up from Alex Jones and some very important interviews coming up from
[06:46.400 --> 06:54.480]  Alex Jones as well, not just during the two-hour Sunday Alex Jones show, but then a very important
[06:54.480 --> 07:01.440]  interview with Dr. Bartlett is going to air tonight on Sunday Night Live that we really want you guys
[07:01.440 --> 07:06.960]  to see. Alex Jones is going to be interviewing Dr. Bartlett. And it's just so key to get all
[07:06.960 --> 07:12.880]  these different doctors on and you've seen them coming on with Harrison Smith in the morning,
[07:12.880 --> 07:17.280]  going on the Alex Jones show, coming on with me in the war room, just dozens of doctors.
[07:18.400 --> 07:22.240]  Because that's what it's about. It's about having debate. It's about having a discussion.
[07:23.040 --> 07:26.720]  Remember, Biden said, we need transparency on all this. So let's hear from all the doctors.
[07:26.720 --> 07:31.280]  Everybody needs to have a discussion about this so we can decide what to do with the vaccine.
[07:31.280 --> 07:35.680]  Oh, but then they get in power and they say it's mandated and anything that they don't want you
[07:35.680 --> 07:40.400]  to see, they censor. Anything, I guess, big pharma doesn't want you to see, they censor.
[07:40.400 --> 07:48.640]  And that's going to be coming up in the third, fourth and fifth segment this Sunday is Ernest
[07:48.640 --> 07:57.120]  Ramirez, whose son died from a vaccine side effect. And he gave a speech about it at an event
[07:57.120 --> 08:03.360]  that the high wire with Del Big Tree held. And he gave a speech talking about his son and the vaccine.
[08:03.360 --> 08:12.480]  And he's got the shirt Pfizer vaccine killed my boy. You know, having a speech, public space,
[08:13.680 --> 08:21.440]  and it gets censored on social media. So truly an incredible thing to be witnessing and
[08:21.440 --> 08:26.160]  experiencing all this. And many people in the audience already knew this type of situation
[08:26.160 --> 08:30.640]  would be coming. They already knew how corrupt things were. A lot of people are just now starting
[08:30.640 --> 08:33.920]  to see it for the first time and their jaws are dropping to the floor. They can't believe it.
[08:33.920 --> 08:38.080]  They can't believe what happened to America. What happened to free speech? What happened
[08:38.080 --> 08:44.480]  to freedom, period? What happened to the media since when does Big Pharma run our country?
[08:44.480 --> 08:55.360]  Since when does Big Pharma own my body? So Mr. Ramirez loses his son, coerced into taking a Pfizer
[08:55.360 --> 09:02.320]  vaccine, dies afterwards. And then he's not even allowed to tell his story because he gets censored
[09:02.320 --> 09:12.240]  on social media. And so that's how they do it. So you only get to hear one side of the story,
[09:12.240 --> 09:16.960]  which isn't even a side of the story. It's the lie. You get to hear the lies. You get to hear the
[09:16.960 --> 09:24.880]  propaganda. You get to hear the prepared PSY op that they want you to see. Oh, it's all
[09:24.880 --> 09:30.560]  vaccine, good news. Yes, the vaccine is working. There's no bad news about the vaccine. No. No,
[09:30.560 --> 09:36.640]  Mr. Ramirez did not give a speech about his son dying from the Pfizer vaccine. It didn't happen.
[09:36.640 --> 09:43.360]  No. No. It just never happened. And so then when you say, Hey, you know, I know this guy,
[09:44.560 --> 09:47.760]  son got the vaccine, he died. Look at this speech. You go to find it. It's not there.
[09:47.760 --> 09:55.280]  It's just gone. Look, it never happened. Nobody did happen. Ernest Ramirez is a real person.
[09:55.280 --> 10:01.360]  His son was a real person and he died from the COVID vaccine along with countless others,
[10:01.360 --> 10:04.560]  thousands, maybe tens of thousands of others. We don't even know the real numbers yet.
[10:05.760 --> 10:09.600]  And the people that die from the vaccine, they're saying they died from COVID.
[10:11.280 --> 10:15.920]  In a very important press conference last week, the governor of West Virginia came out
[10:15.920 --> 10:25.520]  and said, in the last two months, we've had a 25% increase in death in vaccinated people.
[10:26.320 --> 10:31.040]  And they just say it's all COVID. Well, yeah, they basically give you COVID. They have the most
[10:31.040 --> 10:36.000]  transmittable contagious virus made in a lab. So everybody's got COVID at any given time.
[10:36.720 --> 10:39.520]  So you die from something else and then just test you. And they say, yep, COVID.
[10:39.520 --> 10:47.280]  And then you have to sit here and deal with the lives of the mainstream news, deal with the
[10:47.280 --> 10:52.720]  internet censorship, pretending like none of it's going on. Oh, the vaccine is great. Oh, COVID's
[10:52.720 --> 10:58.240]  killing everybody you know. Meanwhile, you're actually doing the independent research. You
[10:58.240 --> 11:01.920]  know that most of the people that are being hospitalized for COVID are dying from COVID
[11:01.920 --> 11:10.080]  or actually vaccinated. There's another story that came out. Stephen King shares the story. 1200
[11:10.080 --> 11:15.680]  people a day are dying in Florida from the COVID. And then it turns out, no, that was a lie. It was
[11:15.680 --> 11:21.680]  like two people that day. He just added all the numbers from like months. Of course, it goes viral
[11:21.680 --> 11:27.600]  and all the liberals are like, seeing you're murdering people, you anti-vaxxers, which forget
[11:27.600 --> 11:37.120]  about even the data that we're being lied to and is already manipulated. They don't even have the
[11:37.120 --> 11:41.280]  common sense to say, hey, if I wear a mask or I take a vaccine, I should be good. So what am I
[11:41.280 --> 11:46.000]  worried about? They don't even have the common sense. But see, they know the vaccine isn't
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.080]  safe or effective. They know the mask doesn't work. It's just all about telling you what to do. Now
[11:50.080 --> 12:00.640]  there's a cartoon here that Alex really liked and he sent to the crew. And I think it pretty much
[12:00.640 --> 12:08.240]  sums things up where you've got a man running on a track with a mask with the back to normal finish
[12:08.240 --> 12:15.520]  line. But then you've got the global elite here running on the COVID virus. It's actually just
[12:15.520 --> 12:19.760]  on a hook and they're just running with you and you'll never get back to normal. You'll never
[12:19.760 --> 12:24.480]  reach that finish line. The only thing that needs to be added is I guess really often in this future
[12:24.480 --> 12:37.280]  right here, maybe not so distant. See, this is going to be your prison. So yeah, you're keeping
[12:37.280 --> 12:42.960]  running and you're just going to keep running and you're told this is going to be normal.
[12:43.920 --> 12:48.960]  I'm just going to keep running and it's just going to be normal. This is what the television
[12:48.960 --> 12:54.880]  tells me. This is what my political leaders tell me. I just got to take my vaccines and
[12:55.520 --> 13:02.640]  I just got to wear my mask and I got a quarantine when I'm told and just take whatever medication
[13:02.640 --> 13:09.440]  I'm told and it's kind of scary and the TV is telling me to be really scared and so I'm just
[13:09.440 --> 13:15.680]  going to keep doing exactly what it says and trust the TV and trust the experts as I'm told and
[13:15.680 --> 13:21.920]  you know, big farmers never hurt anybody and they won't hurt me. I'll be fine. I'm just going to
[13:21.920 --> 13:29.280]  keep doing exactly as I'm told. It's not about freedom. It's not about freedom. No. It's about
[13:29.280 --> 13:37.120]  being a slave so that I can be safe and protected. The safest place for me to be is in a prison cell
[13:37.840 --> 13:45.040]  with my ankles shackled and my hands shackled because I might hurt somebody or myself and
[13:45.040 --> 13:50.320]  I have these things called like emotions and thoughts and so I might want to do something
[13:50.320 --> 13:55.920]  or speak and I don't want to do that so I need to be inoculated so that I can't even think anymore
[13:57.120 --> 14:03.040]  and then finally I'll be safe and everybody will be safe and sure we're all these slaves
[14:04.080 --> 14:08.960]  and it's the biggest world government conspiracy in the history of humanity
[14:10.400 --> 14:14.880]  and it's going to be global enslavement unlike anything ever seen on this planet or history
[14:14.880 --> 14:23.760]  of humanity but I need to trust the TV. I need to listen to Hollywood. They'll save me. They care
[14:23.760 --> 14:31.840]  about me. Joe Biden cares about me. Hollywood cares about me. They would never lie to me.
[14:32.480 --> 14:37.600]  They would never tell me that a vaccine is safe and effective when it's killing people
[14:37.600 --> 14:43.520]  and all the new hospitalizations are from the vaccinated people and all the new variants are
[14:43.520 --> 14:49.840]  from the vaccinated people. I'm just going to keep running until they put me in a jail cell
[14:49.840 --> 14:56.240]  and lock me up and tie me up and hog tie me and cover my mouth because I'm a bad human
[14:56.240 --> 15:00.480]  and I'm a parasite and I'm killing the planet and so this is a good thing.
[15:02.400 --> 15:10.400]  Says the average woke topian leftist out there and so I'll cover some of this vaccine news
[15:10.400 --> 15:14.160]  coming up but remember ladies and gentlemen we don't want you to live in a prison. We don't want to
[15:14.160 --> 15:18.880]  see the global elite conquer the planet. We don't want to see the biggest human enslavement in
[15:18.880 --> 15:24.880]  world history. That's what Info Wars is fighting against and has been for 20 plus years and there's
[15:24.880 --> 15:28.800]  a reason why we're the number one target of the New World Order which has now been announced.
[15:28.800 --> 15:32.800]  So it's not just a thing to say the New World Order like that's a cliche around here. Nope. Nope.
[15:32.800 --> 15:36.320]  It's it's now been announced. The New World Order is here. The New World Order is real.
[15:36.320 --> 15:41.280]  We're their number one enemy. There's a reason why because we're leading the edge right now
[15:41.280 --> 15:45.920]  for the media against the New World Order. So remember to go to infowarstore.com the specials
[15:45.920 --> 15:53.120]  that you see right now like vitamin mineral fusion 33% off that is coming to an end after tonight.
[15:53.120 --> 15:59.040]  So take advantage of vitamin mineral fusion 33% off at infowarstore.com before it sells out or it's too
[15:59.040 --> 16:08.240]  light. On September 9th 2021 the puppet president Joe Biden publicly declared war against America.
[16:08.960 --> 16:14.960]  He then announced dictatorial powers of himself and announced forced inoculations
[16:14.960 --> 16:19.840]  against the American people. He is a puppet of the United Nations and the Rockefeller
[16:19.840 --> 16:25.040]  Combined of corporations that put him in power and he is making a very serious move against
[16:25.040 --> 16:29.600]  the American people. But the attack he's launched is being launched against every other
[16:29.600 --> 16:34.480]  western country on the planet by these corporations that have already enslaved the third world.
[16:34.480 --> 16:39.840]  What they're doing is illegal on its face violates our federal state laws and the Geneva
[16:39.840 --> 16:44.480]  Convention as well as the Nuremberg Code. It's very very simple. We have to decide whether we're
[16:44.480 --> 16:48.720]  going to surrender to this globalist corporate takeover whether we're going to stand up with
[16:48.720 --> 16:53.920]  our birthright and say no and then prosecute these criminals for their crimes against humanity.
[16:53.920 --> 16:57.360]  So other criminals in the future don't dare try it. The choice is up to us.
[17:02.480 --> 17:08.080]  Jacob in Ohio welcome go ahead. Hey how's it going Alex. It's great last caller. I just wanted
[17:08.080 --> 17:13.200]  to start with plugging your sleep supplement. It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore
[17:13.200 --> 17:17.680]  with all the gaslighting, demoralization and absurdity. It's like we're living at a twilight
[17:17.680 --> 17:21.840]  zone and. All right Eric's in New Hampshire. Eric thanks for calling go ahead. Hey Alex
[17:21.840 --> 17:24.960]  thank you for taking my call. If I could I just want to throw a quick plug out for the
[17:24.960 --> 17:29.520]  point of the product. The X2 does wonders. They recommend it to everybody. You're on the fence
[17:29.520 --> 17:34.320]  about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the Imp Award. Tyler in Maine you're
[17:34.320 --> 17:38.160]  on the air. Thanks for holding. Go ahead. Hey Alex it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[17:38.160 --> 17:44.560]  Honor talk to you. Awesome. So personally I wanted to do is say I love the products. Alpha Power
[17:44.560 --> 17:50.480]  even at 29. If you ask my better half she loves it and it helps in the bedroom. So just number
[17:50.480 --> 17:54.640]  one for a few years. Well it definitely works. It's not a joke. Absolutely.
[17:59.840 --> 18:05.760]  I am cutting this ad on Thursday afternoon. That means you've got one, two, three, four days.
[18:05.760 --> 18:11.040]  Monday at midnight we've got to end this sale. We may end it earlier because we think it'll sell

[18:56.800 --> 19:04.080]  night so get yours now. The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be
[19:04.080 --> 19:10.080]  afraid of today. Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating
[19:10.080 --> 19:15.520]  experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[19:15.520 --> 19:21.040]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked
[19:21.040 --> 19:26.640]  up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years. For those of us who have
[19:26.640 --> 19:32.240]  awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[19:32.240 --> 19:37.920]  But there is only two things to do. We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[19:37.920 --> 19:43.360]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win. But even when we win, and we eventually
[19:43.360 --> 19:49.040]  will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end. And so we must prepare, get up to a
[19:49.040 --> 19:55.920]  years worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and
[19:55.920 --> 20:11.840]  lifesaving knowledge at infoorstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:11.840 --> 20:27.520]  We've got a lot of special stuff coming up here. Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign,
[20:27.520 --> 20:35.200]  and domestic. It's Alex Jones. And now your host, Owen Troyer. A lot of special stuff.
[20:36.240 --> 20:41.200]  We're going to start off at the end of this segment. We're going to begin the interview of Alex Jones
[20:41.200 --> 20:50.480]  and Ernest Ramirez, a father who lost his son to a Pfizer vaccine, the COVID vaccine. And then
[20:50.480 --> 20:54.960]  he gets censored on social media. He's not allowed to tell you about it because, you know,
[20:54.960 --> 20:59.760]  you don't want to go against the Biden regime and the forced vaccines that are killing people.
[20:59.760 --> 21:04.640]  That's not a good look. And of course, social media in bed with the Biden regime.
[21:04.640 --> 21:10.880]  Not only that, Sunday Night Live is going to be Alex Jones and Dr. Bartlett. And you're not going
[21:10.880 --> 21:18.240]  to want to miss this interview yet. Just another doctor with the, you know, you can say courage,
[21:18.240 --> 21:23.280]  and it is a courageous thing. But really, with the foresight to understand, he needs to go public
[21:23.280 --> 21:28.640]  with this information, tell the truth about COVID, tell the truth about the vaccines before it's too
[21:28.640 --> 21:34.640]  late. And so that he can have that on, or have it his conscious cleared that he's not involved in
[21:34.640 --> 21:40.640]  any of this as a doctor and a medical practitioner. So just add Dr. Bartlett to the list of dozens
[21:40.640 --> 21:45.840]  of doctors with the courage or the foresight or the combination of both to see that now is the time
[21:45.840 --> 21:50.080]  to come out and tell the truth about COVID and speak out against these vaccines. Now,
[21:50.800 --> 21:55.360]  I've also got a lot of other news here. I've got a huge stack of this COVID news, a bunch of video
[21:55.360 --> 22:02.960]  clips. Trump was just the bell of the ball all weekend. Visiting with cops and firefighters,
[22:02.960 --> 22:08.640]  he was at a big boxing match where there were a huge Trump one chance and we love Trump chance
[22:08.640 --> 22:12.960]  and everybody just loving on Trump and loving on America. Sad you don't see that in the other
[22:12.960 --> 22:18.000]  sports industries these days. And then of course, the college stadiums now for football games,
[22:18.000 --> 22:22.800]  it seems like every weekend, we have massive cheers or lack there, I guess not cheers,
[22:22.800 --> 22:28.480]  chance of F Biden and screw Biden just rocking college stadiums, hundreds of thousands of people
[22:28.480 --> 22:35.360]  chanting F Biden. So that's a new thing now. And then Biden even getting booed at the 9-11
[22:35.360 --> 22:43.840]  ceremony that was all the DC criminals like Pelosi and the Bushes and the Obamas and the
[22:43.840 --> 22:49.360]  Bidens and all the DC elite and the Clintons, all the big criminals were there. Folks, those are
[22:49.360 --> 22:54.080]  the criminals. Those are our corrupt politicians. Everybody that was there. So it was a good move
[22:54.080 --> 22:59.280]  for Trump to snub that and he actually went up to New York and did personalized visits
[22:59.280 --> 23:04.240]  and all kinds of stuff with cops and firefighters. And so we'll have a little bit of that coming
[23:04.240 --> 23:15.360]  up. And another man has decided to become a woman and in the MMA debut beats a woman's face in
[23:15.360 --> 23:21.760]  and wins the fight as a fake woman. So that's pretty incredible. And then the race in California
[23:21.760 --> 23:25.040]  is heating up and then that's going to be a big story coming up this week. So there's a little
[23:25.040 --> 23:30.960]  bit of news on that and a couple other outliers here. But let me just get into as much of this
[23:30.960 --> 23:37.600]  stack of news before we begin this powerful interview coming up with Ernest Ramirez. UK
[23:37.600 --> 23:43.840]  Health Minister says government will not impose COVID vaccine passports or lockdowns over Christmas.
[23:43.840 --> 23:50.480]  So this is what standing up is doing. It's pushing back on this tyranny. It's resisting this
[23:50.480 --> 23:53.920]  tyranny. It doesn't mean it's going to go away. They're just going to relinquish it a little bit
[23:53.920 --> 24:00.160]  and they'll clamp back down. But all the people that have been standing up and speaking out and
[24:00.160 --> 24:06.720]  going to protest and organizing rallies and everything, they have scored a victory. So passports
[24:06.720 --> 24:11.360]  or vaccines are on hold now and they are going to say, well, at least they're telling them now
[24:11.360 --> 24:14.720]  that you'll be able to have Christmas with your friends and family, you know, because that was
[24:14.720 --> 24:22.320]  illegal last year. Canada is going the opposite way, though. Canada is adopting the Chinese
[24:22.320 --> 24:27.680]  social credit score. They're just going full communist up there in China, which of course is
[24:27.680 --> 24:32.560]  what Trudeau said he wanted to do. So he's just doing it. Who's more owned by the Chinese? Is it
[24:32.560 --> 24:38.880]  Trudeau or Biden? With Trudeau, I guess it feels like he's voluntarily in bed with China with
[24:38.880 --> 24:45.600]  Biden. I think they got all the dirt. You know, they're telling you about all these situations
[24:45.600 --> 24:50.400]  going on in the hospitals. It's actually going to get worse now. No, not because of COVID.
[24:50.400 --> 24:55.120]  It's going to get worse because you have doctors and nurses that are being laid off because they
[24:55.120 --> 24:59.520]  refuse the vaccine. And they don't get to tell their story. They get censored on social media,
[24:59.520 --> 25:06.080]  by the way. And this is what's going to actually cause problems at hospitals. So they built the
[25:06.080 --> 25:09.680]  false narrative that, oh, there's all these problems at hospitals because of COVID. That's a big
[25:09.680 --> 25:17.280]  lie. Then they create the problem that they claim was already there by getting rid of all the
[25:17.280 --> 25:24.400]  hospital workers that don't want to take the experimental vaccine. And why? Seriously, I mean,
[25:24.400 --> 25:29.040]  this is, look, America is going to have a huge awakening over this. Any thinking man or woman
[25:29.040 --> 25:32.960]  that is left in this country is going to realize that they've been lied to for a long time. And
[25:32.960 --> 25:37.200]  who knows? They may even realize that all these lies about COVID and everything recently,
[25:37.760 --> 25:41.280]  whether it's Afghanistan or COVID, everything else, folks, they've been doing the same thing to
[25:41.280 --> 25:46.560]  us for decades. They lied just like they did on 9-11, like they're doing now. It's all the same.
[25:47.440 --> 25:52.400]  That's going to be a big pill for a lot of people to swallow. You've been lied to your whole life
[25:52.400 --> 25:55.760]  and you're now just realizing it. I get it. That's what Info Wars is here for.
[25:55.760 --> 26:01.680]  Kentucky healthcare workers refuse to comply with vaccine mandate, force hospital, fire them. And
[26:01.680 --> 26:06.720]  this is happening everywhere. So now you'll actually have hospital shortages of workers. And
[26:06.720 --> 26:10.640]  then the workers are going to eventually all be getting sick because they got forced to take this
[26:10.640 --> 26:17.200]  vaccine. And where does natural immunity play into any of this? Well, it doesn't. It's just like it
[26:17.200 --> 26:24.480]  doesn't exist. See, and Oscar de la Hoya is the perfect example. Why did Oscar de la Hoya play
[26:24.480 --> 26:34.880]  it? Did Oscar de la Hoya, who's fully vaccinated for COVID, end up in the ICU with COVID really sick?
[26:35.680 --> 26:41.360]  Well, because Oscar de la Hoya probably already had COVID. Maybe he knew it. Maybe he didn't.
[26:43.760 --> 26:47.840]  So he got the vaccine. Then he got even more sick because of it.
[26:47.840 --> 26:57.280]  Six organ workers with natural immunity to sue over COVID-19 vaccine mandate.
[27:02.080 --> 27:08.560]  So this is going to be the next big issue. But you already have, I think, 28 states that said
[27:08.560 --> 27:14.240]  they're not going to be doing vaccine mandates. Ken Paxton and other attorney generals have said
[27:14.240 --> 27:19.920]  that they are going to be suing the Biden administration for this unconstitutional thing.
[27:19.920 --> 27:23.840]  They've made public statements saying they've never seen a more unconstitutional action from
[27:23.840 --> 27:30.240]  the White House in U.S. history. So it's really incredible. New York Hospital forced to stop
[27:30.240 --> 27:35.520]  delivering babies after maternity workers resigned over vaccines. So again, that's going to be the
[27:35.520 --> 27:39.280]  next big thing. But then they're going to just say, oh, it's COVID. So the vaccines are getting
[27:39.280 --> 27:43.280]  people sick. They say it's COVID. The people are getting laid off at the hospitals. They're going
[27:43.280 --> 27:47.280]  to blame COVID when it's all the government tyranny causing all these problems. Now,
[27:48.640 --> 27:53.120]  here's a short clip of this powerful interview with Ernest Ramirez. It's going to be in the
[27:53.120 --> 27:56.960]  next two segments, folks. You don't want to miss this. Sensor it all over the Internet. You can
[27:56.960 --> 28:02.800]  only find it right here on Infowars. I love the hell out of my country, but I don't trust my
[28:02.800 --> 28:12.080]  government anymore. My son received a vaccine and he died a few days later. The only explanation
[28:12.080 --> 28:19.040]  I was given to me was in large heart. So if I have anything to say to anybody, look down at your
[28:19.040 --> 28:26.560]  child. It's not worth the risk. I mean, you see your baby right now. You might not see your baby
[28:26.560 --> 28:36.480]  tomorrow. I have to live with that the rest of my life. So coming up, Ernest Ramirez and Alex Jones,
[28:36.480 --> 28:42.480]  this man has been censored now all over the Internet for telling the story of his son dying
[28:42.480 --> 28:48.240]  from the COVID vaccine. So now you can only find it one place right here at Infowars. Why are they
[28:48.240 --> 28:53.520]  so afraid of you knowing about these vaccines? Why are they censoring the truth about these
[28:53.520 --> 29:02.080]  vaccines? A question America should be asking right now. It's only been in the last 60 years
[29:02.080 --> 29:08.000]  that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere. But if you
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.000]  look at all the different studies and reports about my NASA and other governments, other agencies,
[29:12.880 --> 29:17.200]  they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate. The only constant, the only great
[29:17.200 --> 29:24.560]  truth is change is the only constant. So yes, climate change is totally real. But notice first
[29:24.560 --> 29:28.800]  they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s and then it's going to be global warming
[29:28.800 --> 29:33.680]  and that didn't really happen the way they wanted to. Okay, now it's just climate change. But did
[29:33.680 --> 29:39.760]  you know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and
[29:39.760 --> 29:46.080]  the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN? They have weather control trees from 1979. Bill
[29:46.080 --> 29:51.360]  Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time. In fact, back in 1994, two scientists
[29:51.360 --> 29:55.920]  wanted Nobel Prize for an idea of spring, different particles out of jet engines to control the
[29:55.920 --> 30:03.680]  weather. So yes, man-made climate change is real. What was the most important point in Joe Biden's
[30:03.680 --> 30:10.880]  Declaration of War against America on Thursday, September 9, 2021? Was it the announcement of
[30:10.880 --> 30:16.880]  force inoculations of 80 to 100 million Americans? Was it the announcement of federalization of all
[30:16.880 --> 30:23.840]  the major cities, the bypassing of state governors, the threat to basically remove them? No, that was
[30:23.840 --> 30:31.360]  all bad enough. It's the fact that he's following a UN globalist great recent blueprint that Australia,
[30:31.360 --> 30:35.760]  the UK, Europe and the rest of the Western world is and that this is just the beginning.
[30:36.560 --> 30:43.200]  More lockdowns, national medical IDs approved by the United Nations, carbon taxes that don't just
[30:43.200 --> 30:47.600]  track and trace you and tax you but actually tell you when you could go somewhere and what you could
[30:47.600 --> 30:53.840]  do. It's all been announced at the UN level. This is a UN world government takeover, corporate
[30:53.840 --> 30:59.520]  revolution through global governance. It's illegal and Congress must stand up and stop it now.
[31:02.080 --> 31:06.640]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[31:06.640 --> 31:11.840]  You.
[31:36.640 --> 32:00.180]  that's info wars.store.com.
[32:00.180 --> 32:04.860]  Just a week ago we got a new shipment of vitamin and mineral fusion back in stock.
[32:04.860 --> 32:07.900]  and it was only half of the order we wanted to get.
[32:07.900 --> 32:10.100]  But because we won't cut corners on the quality
[32:10.100 --> 32:11.460]  of what goes into it,
[32:11.460 --> 32:13.300]  the factory can only get limited supplies.
[32:13.300 --> 32:15.460]  So again, it was half the order we wanted.
[32:15.460 --> 32:18.840]  But despite that, I'm still offering it for 33% off,
[32:18.840 --> 32:20.860]  so everybody on the fence will get it.
[32:20.860 --> 32:23.220]  It's critical for your immune system and your whole body.
[32:23.220 --> 32:25.500]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals
[32:25.500 --> 32:28.460]  had a bunch of key amino acids at infowarstore.com.
[32:28.460 --> 32:30.900]  So while supplies last until it runs out,
[32:30.900 --> 32:33.620]  we're selling it for 33% off,
[32:33.620 --> 32:35.700]  and it'll be months till more comes in.
[32:35.700 --> 32:38.820]  So get yours today at infowarstore.com.
[32:38.820 --> 32:40.380]  Because it's not just a great product,
[32:40.380 --> 32:42.540]  we need those funds to keep operating as well.
[32:42.540 --> 32:43.940]  We're all in a catch 22.
[32:43.940 --> 32:45.500]  But we have another great product,
[32:45.500 --> 32:46.700]  hair and beard formula,
[32:46.700 --> 32:49.900]  that's really a great multivitamin mineral system
[32:49.900 --> 32:52.420]  that's one of the best multivitamin mineral systems out there.
[32:52.420 --> 32:54.380]  It's just called hair and beard.
[32:54.380 --> 32:56.180]  So get that as well for your immune system.
[32:56.180 --> 32:57.900]  It's great for women, great for children,
[32:57.900 --> 33:00.180]  but it's designed for men, infowarstore.com.
[33:00.180 --> 33:03.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:16.180 --> 33:19.660]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[33:19.660 --> 33:21.660]  it's Alex Jones.
[33:23.660 --> 33:25.660]  I love the hell out of my country,
[33:25.660 --> 33:27.660]  but I don't trust my government.
[33:27.660 --> 33:31.660]  My son received the vaccine,
[33:31.660 --> 33:34.660]  and he died a few days later.
[33:34.660 --> 33:39.660]  The only explanation I was given to me was in large heart.
[33:39.660 --> 33:41.660]  So if I have anything to say to anybody,
[33:41.660 --> 33:43.660]  look down at your child.
[33:43.660 --> 33:45.660]  It's not worth the risk.
[33:45.660 --> 33:48.660]  I mean, you see your baby right now,
[33:48.660 --> 33:50.660]  you might not see your baby tomorrow.
[33:50.660 --> 33:53.660]  I have to live with that the rest of my life.
[33:53.660 --> 33:57.660]  Well, as a father of four, my oldest is my 18-year-old son.
[33:57.660 --> 34:00.660]  I see our guest coming on.
[34:00.660 --> 34:03.660]  I see the photo of his very handsome son behind him,
[34:03.660 --> 34:05.660]  and it makes me want to start crying.
[34:05.660 --> 34:08.660]  It also makes me think violent thoughts about the people
[34:08.660 --> 34:10.660]  that did this to his son.
[34:10.660 --> 34:11.660]  They thought he was doing the right thing
[34:11.660 --> 34:13.660]  in trying to help people.
[34:13.660 --> 34:15.660]  But we're going to bring him to justice through the courts,
[34:15.660 --> 34:17.660]  ladies and gentlemen, and don't worry.
[34:17.660 --> 34:18.660]  They will pay.
[34:18.660 --> 34:19.660]  They violated the Nuremberg Code,
[34:19.660 --> 34:22.660]  the human convention, and we're going to bring him to justice
[34:22.660 --> 34:24.660]  through the Nuremberg Code, the human convention,
[34:24.660 --> 34:26.660]  and a lot more with a secret experimentation in line
[34:26.660 --> 34:28.660]  with the public about it being authorized.
[34:28.660 --> 34:33.660]  Last October, the CDC accidentally flashed up a slideshow,
[34:33.660 --> 34:36.660]  and then later it was quote, declassified.
[34:36.660 --> 34:40.660]  A list of potential side effects that they knew
[34:40.660 --> 34:43.660]  from previous studies of similar mRNA shots was causing.
[34:43.660 --> 34:47.660]  It includes microcarditis and then flat-out heart attacks,
[34:47.660 --> 34:49.660]  swelling of the heart.
[34:49.660 --> 34:51.660]  So I know it's hard for Ernest Vermeiros to talk about
[34:51.660 --> 34:56.660]  Ernest, Jr., his son, but we only saw a short clip of him
[34:56.660 --> 34:59.660]  on Local Fox, hundreds gather at Texas Capitol
[34:59.660 --> 35:01.660]  to post vaccine mandates.
[35:01.660 --> 35:05.660]  And then a reporter that we work with,
[35:05.660 --> 35:07.660]  Christy Lee, also did a more in-depth interview
[35:07.660 --> 35:09.660]  that's also at Mann.Video.
[35:09.660 --> 35:11.660]  So I really appreciate him coming on to talk about this
[35:11.660 --> 35:17.660]  to make sure that his son's passing over to God's side
[35:17.660 --> 35:19.660]  is not in vain here, and he can warn other people.
[35:19.660 --> 35:21.660]  So I know it must be hard to do this.
[35:21.660 --> 35:22.660]  It's hard for me to even do the interview,
[35:22.660 --> 35:24.660]  so I can't imagine what it's like for him.
[35:24.660 --> 35:26.660]  So Ernest, let's talk about Ernest, Jr.
[35:26.660 --> 35:27.660]  What happened?
[35:27.660 --> 35:29.660]  And I really appreciate you coming on, sir.
[35:29.660 --> 35:32.660]  I know it's hard. God bless you.
[35:32.660 --> 35:40.660]  Well, like I said, I took the Moderna because it was just me
[35:40.660 --> 35:41.660]  and my son.
[35:41.660 --> 35:44.660]  It's always been just us two.
[35:44.660 --> 35:46.660]  And we locked up in the house.
[35:46.660 --> 35:49.660]  When all this started up, we figured it's safest
[35:49.660 --> 35:52.660]  to just keep to ourselves.
[35:52.660 --> 35:56.660]  And so I took it because I'm being in and out from work.
[35:56.660 --> 35:58.660]  You know, my son would, I'd wake him up in the morning,
[35:58.660 --> 36:01.660]  give him a kiss, tell him,
[36:01.660 --> 36:04.660]  oh, Jimmy, I'll tell him I love you.
[36:04.660 --> 36:08.660]  It's going to work.
[36:08.660 --> 36:10.660]  When I get home, he ran outside.
[36:10.660 --> 36:13.660]  You know, I always call him my baby boy.
[36:13.660 --> 36:15.660]  He was almost a little bit bigger than me,
[36:15.660 --> 36:18.660]  but I was always, he'd have run outside,
[36:18.660 --> 36:20.660]  give me a hug and I'd give him a kiss
[36:20.660 --> 36:22.660]  and we'd prepare for the evening.
[36:22.660 --> 36:23.660]  What are we going to do?
[36:23.660 --> 36:24.660]  What are we going to eat?
[36:24.660 --> 36:27.660]  So they started to advertise and saying it was safe
[36:27.660 --> 36:28.660]  for teenagers.
[36:28.660 --> 36:35.660]  And like I said, my concern, we were never apart.
[36:35.660 --> 36:36.660]  We're always together.
[36:36.660 --> 36:38.660]  And I started taking a peek.
[36:38.660 --> 36:39.660]  It's sick.
[36:39.660 --> 36:41.660]  He has to go to the hospital.
[36:41.660 --> 36:44.660]  There's no way in the world they're going to keep me
[36:44.660 --> 36:45.660]  on his side.
[36:45.660 --> 36:48.660]  You know, I'm going to end up getting in trouble
[36:48.660 --> 36:49.660]  or whatever.
[36:49.660 --> 36:52.660]  So I said, well, they're telling me it's safe.
[36:52.660 --> 36:53.660]  Pfizer's safe for him.
[36:53.660 --> 36:57.660]  So I waited, you know, a couple more weeks
[36:57.660 --> 36:59.660]  and I kept announcing, you know, it's good for the
[36:59.660 --> 37:00.660]  teenagers.
[37:00.660 --> 37:02.660]  So I said, okay, let's go take it.
[37:02.660 --> 37:08.660]  So he took the Pfizer shot at a local hospital here.
[37:08.660 --> 37:11.660]  And, you know, we still stayed home.
[37:11.660 --> 37:15.660]  You know, we didn't go out and finally my neighbors,
[37:15.660 --> 37:17.660]  they're like family.
[37:17.660 --> 37:19.660]  Her husband's my best friend.
[37:19.660 --> 37:21.660]  Their kids are like my own kids.
[37:21.660 --> 37:23.660]  Well, they asked to take them out to eat.
[37:23.660 --> 37:26.660]  I said, yeah, you know, they're a good Christian
[37:26.660 --> 37:27.660]  people.
[37:27.660 --> 37:29.660]  So they went to eat.
[37:29.660 --> 37:31.660]  They went to the park to play basketball.
[37:31.660 --> 37:35.660]  She said the three boys were running one side to the
[37:35.660 --> 37:38.660]  other and he just collapsed while he was running.
[37:38.660 --> 37:41.660]  He collapsed and fell.
[37:41.660 --> 37:45.660]  A local PD just happened to be at the park and he started
[37:45.660 --> 37:47.660]  doing CPR.
[37:47.660 --> 37:54.660]  My best friend, he started giving them miles to miles and
[37:54.660 --> 37:55.660]  there was nothing they could do.
[37:55.660 --> 37:56.660]  The ambulance got there.
[37:56.660 --> 38:00.660]  As soon as I got there, they loaded them up and I chased
[38:00.660 --> 38:02.660]  the ambulance to the hospital and they told me,
[38:02.660 --> 38:04.660]  your son's dead.
[38:04.660 --> 38:05.660]  I couldn't believe it.
[38:05.660 --> 38:07.660]  I couldn't believe it at all.
[38:07.660 --> 38:11.660]  They took a local, the local detectives.
[38:11.660 --> 38:16.660]  They came and told me that he had passed due to a
[38:16.660 --> 38:19.660]  large heart and I got upset because they're not even
[38:19.660 --> 38:20.660]  doctors.
[38:20.660 --> 38:25.660]  How are they going to know that it was a large heart?
[38:25.660 --> 38:28.660]  What did the doctor call me or something else?
[38:28.660 --> 38:30.660]  That's what I appreciate.
[38:30.660 --> 38:33.660]  Miss Ivory Hecker, she investigated.
[38:33.660 --> 38:36.660]  Texas Health Department never called me back.
[38:36.660 --> 38:39.660]  They transferred me to six different people.
[38:39.660 --> 38:42.660]  To this day, I have not received a call from them.
[38:42.660 --> 38:44.660]  I emailed Governor Abbott.
[38:44.660 --> 38:48.660]  Also, still haven't got any emails from him either.
[38:48.660 --> 38:52.660]  When Miss Hecker talked to one of the doctors,
[38:52.660 --> 38:57.660]  he said he figured my son wasn't vaccinated there.
[38:57.660 --> 39:01.660]  She showed him his card.
[39:01.660 --> 39:04.660]  He was, oh, well, maybe because the side effect,
[39:04.660 --> 39:06.660]  because he was obese or something,
[39:06.660 --> 39:07.660]  she showed him a photo.
[39:07.660 --> 39:09.660]  Does he look like he's obese?
[39:09.660 --> 39:10.660]  He said no.
[39:10.660 --> 39:14.660]  He looks like a normal 16-year-old boy.
[39:14.660 --> 39:18.660]  He said, well, maybe his paperwork got misplaced.
[39:18.660 --> 39:21.660]  It meant nothing to them.
[39:21.660 --> 39:22.660]  It's not their loss.
[39:22.660 --> 39:23.660]  It's my loss.
[39:23.660 --> 39:25.660]  Did you know, sir, that they're actually told at the
[39:25.660 --> 39:27.660]  hospitals, I've had guests on about it,
[39:27.660 --> 39:29.660]  to cover up that the vaccine is doing this,
[39:29.660 --> 39:32.660]  did you know that the federal government,
[39:32.660 --> 39:35.660]  when they were preparing to do the emergency authorization
[39:35.660 --> 39:38.660]  last October, said in a report that's now public,
[39:38.660 --> 39:40.660]  that they believe Moderna and Pfizer,
[39:40.660 --> 39:42.660]  they've already seen it with similar shots in Europe
[39:42.660 --> 39:46.660]  and Israel, would cause heart attacks in teenage boys?
[39:46.660 --> 39:47.660]  No, sir.
[39:47.660 --> 39:51.660]  I didn't hear anything until after he passed on in April.
[39:51.660 --> 39:56.660]  I didn't hear any time of reports until after his passing.
[39:56.660 --> 39:59.660]  I heard that it was 60% of the teenage boys,
[39:59.660 --> 40:03.660]  teenagers, who were passing due to a large heart.
[40:03.660 --> 40:05.660]  Even if they would have said 10%,
[40:05.660 --> 40:07.660]  I wouldn't have risked not even, no percentage,
[40:07.660 --> 40:09.660]  for my son, for the worst, more than that.
[40:09.660 --> 40:13.660]  I mean, like I said, nothing can bring him back.
[40:13.660 --> 40:15.660]  The government, I don't care what they,
[40:15.660 --> 40:18.660]  there's no amount of money that can replace my son.
[40:18.660 --> 40:20.660]  He was the best kid there was.
[40:20.660 --> 40:23.660]  I mean, I've never had no problem.
[40:23.660 --> 40:25.660]  I love the hell out of him.
[40:25.660 --> 40:30.660]  He achieved me and him, always said, just meet you against the world.
[40:30.660 --> 40:34.660]  He was my world.
[40:34.660 --> 40:36.660]  Excuse me, I'm sorry.
[40:36.660 --> 40:38.660]  Oh, sir, I'm almost crying watching this.
[40:38.660 --> 40:40.660]  I'm just holding it together in respect for you.
[40:40.660 --> 40:43.660]  Well, you listen to the media and you're supposed to,
[40:43.660 --> 40:45.660]  in the past, listen to the doctors.
[40:45.660 --> 40:47.660]  And so you have no, nothing to blame.
[40:47.660 --> 40:49.660]  You were trying to help society and step up
[40:49.660 --> 40:51.660]  and they were telling you it's the right thing to do to protect others.
[40:51.660 --> 40:53.660]  That's what Biden said last night.
[40:53.660 --> 40:55.660]  This is an epidemic of the unvaccinated,
[40:55.660 --> 40:57.660]  even though it's the vaccinated that are mutating
[40:57.660 --> 40:59.660]  and creating these new mutations,
[40:59.660 --> 41:05.660]  like the vaccine mutant that's out there now
[41:05.660 --> 41:07.660]  that has hit so many people.
[41:07.660 --> 41:09.660]  And that, of course, is the Delta variant.
[41:09.660 --> 41:11.660]  But they consciously knew this.
[41:11.660 --> 41:12.660]  I'm gonna put that document back on screen
[41:12.660 --> 41:15.660]  if you'd like us to bring these documents to you, we can.
[41:15.660 --> 41:18.660]  But this is only FDA's own website, the CDC's own website,
[41:18.660 --> 41:21.660]  that they knew before this was emergency authorized
[41:21.660 --> 41:22.660]  that it would do it.
[41:22.660 --> 41:24.660]  And now there's new articles,
[41:24.660 --> 41:26.660]  teenage boys are 14 times more likely
[41:26.660 --> 41:28.660]  to suffer heart complication from PfizerJav,
[41:28.660 --> 41:30.660]  specifically heart swelling.
[41:30.660 --> 41:33.660]  So the police, that's their job to ask.
[41:33.660 --> 41:35.660]  So just in case it was drugs or something else,
[41:35.660 --> 41:37.660]  I guarantee you that hospital took his blood
[41:37.660 --> 41:39.660]  and they found out he was clean.
[41:39.660 --> 41:42.660]  They did a scan and they know it was the shot.
[41:42.660 --> 41:45.660]  So by them not telling you, the police at least did,
[41:45.660 --> 41:48.660]  they are now aiding and abetting his murder by Moderna,
[41:48.660 --> 41:49.660]  which is DARPA.
[41:49.660 --> 41:51.660]  And I'm sorry to have to talk like that to you.
[41:51.660 --> 41:52.660]  I know you're going through a lot,
[41:52.660 --> 41:54.660]  but I think your son would want the justice here
[41:54.660 --> 41:55.660]  to come out of what happened.
[41:55.660 --> 41:56.660]  Of course.
[41:56.660 --> 41:57.660]  That's what I said.
[41:57.660 --> 41:59.660]  I mean, I've told different reporters.
[41:59.660 --> 42:01.660]  I said to me, if I go out there,
[42:01.660 --> 42:03.660]  I decided to go out drinking,
[42:03.660 --> 42:05.660]  I haven't caused an accident.
[42:05.660 --> 42:06.660]  I killed somebody.
[42:06.660 --> 42:08.660]  I'm gonna suffer the consequence.
[42:08.660 --> 42:10.660]  And I feel like this is murder.
[42:10.660 --> 42:12.660]  Somebody needs to pay for it.
[42:12.660 --> 42:18.660]  Somebody has to take that up and admit they're wrong.
[42:18.660 --> 42:21.660]  We're lying to everybody.
[42:21.660 --> 42:22.660]  That's our government.
[42:22.660 --> 42:24.660]  They're supposed to help us.
[42:24.660 --> 42:27.660]  We're supposed to be trusting them.
[42:27.660 --> 42:31.660]  And I keep running it to dead end.
[42:31.660 --> 42:33.660]  That's why I went and spoke.
[42:33.660 --> 42:36.660]  Everywhere they asked me to go speak, I go.
[42:36.660 --> 42:40.660]  And somebody told me inside that I need to take this to DC.
[42:40.660 --> 42:41.660]  I don't know why.
[42:41.660 --> 42:42.660]  Yes, sir.
[42:42.660 --> 42:45.660]  I said, well, that's what I'm gonna do.
[42:45.660 --> 42:46.660]  I'm gonna head to DC.
[42:46.660 --> 42:48.660]  Well, I'm going to DC next week.
[42:48.660 --> 42:49.660]  I hadn't told anybody that,
[42:49.660 --> 42:51.660]  but they're trying to demonize the First Amendment.
[42:51.660 --> 42:53.660]  So I'm going up there to support free speech,
[42:53.660 --> 42:59.660]  trying to ban protest in DC.
[42:59.660 --> 43:01.660]  I've been fighting as hard as I can
[43:01.660 --> 43:04.660]  for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[43:04.660 --> 43:06.660]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[43:06.660 --> 43:08.660]  I wanted to wake up the world
[43:08.660 --> 43:10.660]  and stop them dead in their tracks
[43:10.660 --> 43:12.660]  before they went operational.
[43:12.660 --> 43:13.660]  But we failed.
[43:13.660 --> 43:15.660]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[43:15.660 --> 43:17.660]  They're not getting caught flat-footed,
[43:17.660 --> 43:19.660]  but they are going ahead
[43:19.660 --> 43:22.660]  with their full operational deindustrialization
[43:22.660 --> 43:23.660]  great restart.
[43:23.660 --> 43:25.660]  And that's why it's more important than ever
[43:25.660 --> 43:27.660]  that all viewers and all listeners
[43:27.660 --> 43:29.660]  tell everybody they know about the show
[43:29.660 --> 43:31.660]  because people are ready to wake up
[43:31.660 --> 43:32.660]  and ready to hear the truth.
[43:32.660 --> 43:34.660]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[43:34.660 --> 43:35.660]  and trying to stop their agenda,
[43:35.660 --> 43:37.660]  but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[43:37.660 --> 43:39.660]  And one of the number one things to do
[43:39.660 --> 43:40.660]  is high-quality, storable food.
[43:40.660 --> 43:41.660]  We've got the best food,
[43:41.660 --> 43:43.660]  ready to ship at very affordable prices
[43:43.660 --> 43:45.660]  at infowarstore.com.
[43:45.660 --> 43:47.660]  So whether it's a month or a six-month
[43:47.660 --> 43:49.660]  or a year supply or specialty diets,
[43:49.660 --> 43:51.660]  it's ready to ship right now.
[43:51.660 --> 43:53.660]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up
[43:53.660 --> 43:55.660]  and before there are long lines and waits.
[43:55.660 --> 43:57.660]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[43:57.660 --> 43:59.660]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[44:01.660 --> 44:03.660]  Biden and his corporate controllers
[44:03.660 --> 44:05.660]  are lying to you.
[44:05.660 --> 44:08.660]  This is not a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[44:08.660 --> 44:11.660]  This is an engineered virus in a lab
[44:11.660 --> 44:14.660]  that they then injected into the public
[44:14.660 --> 44:16.660]  using their poison vaccine
[44:16.660 --> 44:18.660]  so the body then created mutations
[44:18.660 --> 44:20.660]  that actually spread even worse
[44:20.660 --> 44:22.660]  like the Delta variant.
[44:22.660 --> 44:24.660]  That is scientifically admitted.
[44:24.660 --> 44:27.660]  That is mainline science and not even debated.
[44:27.660 --> 44:31.660]  But the general public does not even know that.
[44:31.660 --> 44:35.660]  So when that criminal with his pedophile crack-edge son
[44:35.660 --> 44:37.660]  gets up there on television
[44:37.660 --> 44:40.660]  and tells you that you are to blame
[44:40.660 --> 44:42.660]  because you didn't take your poison shot,
[44:42.660 --> 44:44.660]  that is a giant lie.
[44:44.660 --> 44:47.660]  Countries like Israel and Singapore
[44:47.660 --> 44:49.660]  with the highest vaccine rate
[44:49.660 --> 44:52.660]  have the highest death and highest illness rates.
[44:52.660 --> 44:54.660]  That is the facts.
[44:54.660 --> 44:56.660]  Get that information out to your friends, family
[44:56.660 --> 44:58.660]  and strangers like your life depends on it
[44:58.660 --> 45:00.660]  because it does.
[45:00.660 --> 45:02.660]  So when I first started taking survival skills,
[45:02.660 --> 45:05.660]  basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[45:05.660 --> 45:07.660]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[45:07.660 --> 45:09.660]  I was barely holding onto a job
[45:09.660 --> 45:11.660]  and I heard Dr. Group on your show
[45:11.660 --> 45:12.660]  and I listened to it.
[45:12.660 --> 45:14.660]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield,
[45:14.660 --> 45:15.660]  the X1.
[45:15.660 --> 45:16.660]  And it worked pretty good.
[45:16.660 --> 45:18.660]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that too.
[45:18.660 --> 45:20.660]  You had with a deep-burdened source
[45:20.660 --> 45:22.660]  and I got really excited about that so I took it.
[45:22.660 --> 45:25.660]  And man, in two weeks I went from brain fog
[45:25.660 --> 45:28.660]  to literally like my brain was enlightened.
[45:28.660 --> 45:30.660]  I could think again.
[45:30.660 --> 45:32.660]  I could connect with people again.
[45:32.660 --> 45:34.660]  And over the course of the next couple of years
[45:34.660 --> 45:36.660]  I got my health back
[45:36.660 --> 45:38.660]  and I religiously took basically all of your supplements.
[45:38.660 --> 45:41.660]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[45:41.660 --> 45:43.660]  The one I like recently is knockouts.
[45:43.660 --> 45:45.660]  Literally like if you want to sleep just take it.
[45:45.660 --> 45:46.660]  It's amazing. It works.
[45:46.660 --> 45:49.660]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[45:49.660 --> 45:51.660]  We have to break free of the globalist system
[45:51.660 --> 45:54.660]  and the only way to do that is to take our own health
[45:54.660 --> 45:55.660]  into our own hands.
[45:55.660 --> 45:56.660]  Beautifully said, brother.
[45:56.660 --> 45:59.660]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[45:59.660 --> 46:02.660]  I am cutting this ad on Thursday afternoon.
[46:02.660 --> 46:05.660]  That means you've got one, two, three, four days.
[46:05.660 --> 46:08.660]  Monday at midnight we've got to end this sale.
[46:08.660 --> 46:10.660]  We may end it earlier
[46:10.660 --> 46:12.660]  because we think it will sell out by then
[46:12.660 --> 46:13.660]  at current sales rates.
[46:13.660 --> 46:15.660]  Vitamin mineral fusion is super popular.
[46:15.660 --> 46:17.660]  It's got all the high quality vitamins and minerals
[46:17.660 --> 46:19.660]  that are essential, great amino acids,
[46:19.660 --> 46:20.660]  and it tastes great.
[46:20.660 --> 46:22.660]  It's powder formed so in the water
[46:22.660 --> 46:24.660]  you absorb it more when you drink the fruit punch.
[46:24.660 --> 46:26.660]  Then we also have back in stock,
[46:26.660 --> 46:28.660]  this sale will continue through next week,

[46:31.660 --> 46:32.660]  that help you sleep better.

[46:37.660 --> 46:40.660]  your stamina, your albedo, your energy, your immune system.
[46:40.660 --> 46:43.660]  It's back in stock and it is 50% off as well

[46:57.660 --> 47:02.660]  so get yours now.
[47:27.660 --> 47:29.660]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:57.660 --> 48:02.660]  Thanks for watching.
[48:28.660 --> 48:31.660]  What's really sad about this is he lived with you.
[48:31.660 --> 48:34.660]  Like you said, you took care of him from the beginning.
[48:34.660 --> 48:38.660]  I think he was a single parent and just that bond there
[48:38.660 --> 48:41.660]  basically like your son but also your brother
[48:41.660 --> 48:44.660]  so close to you and I just can't imagine
[48:44.660 --> 48:47.660]  what your sorrows like to have him taken from you.
[48:47.660 --> 48:50.660]  Yes, I mean it's hard work coming home every day
[48:50.660 --> 48:54.660]  to an empty house.
[48:54.660 --> 48:57.660]  I wait for him to run out the door to give me a hug.
[48:57.660 --> 49:00.660]  I'm not getting that anymore.
[49:00.660 --> 49:02.660]  Yeah.
[49:02.660 --> 49:07.660]  How many days after he got the experimental injection
[49:07.660 --> 49:10.660]  did he have that heart swelling and collapse?
[49:10.660 --> 49:15.660]  I believe it was, he got on the 19th I believe
[49:15.660 --> 49:18.660]  and it happened on the 24th.
[49:18.660 --> 49:20.660]  We hear that a lot within one week
[49:20.660 --> 49:22.660]  and that was what month sir?
[49:22.660 --> 49:25.660]  April.
[49:25.660 --> 49:27.660]  Right when it all started.
[49:27.660 --> 49:28.660]  Yes.
[49:28.660 --> 49:31.660]  And boy now what do you think of the president bullying people
[49:31.660 --> 49:34.660]  and saying we're going to make you take this
[49:34.660 --> 49:36.660]  or you're going to be homeless and lose your job.
[49:36.660 --> 49:38.660]  I mean this is tyranny in my view.
[49:38.660 --> 49:40.660]  What's your view sir?
[49:40.660 --> 49:42.660]  Well look at it.
[49:42.660 --> 49:44.660]  I mean everybody should have their own choice.
[49:44.660 --> 49:47.660]  I mean my concern are the kids because you know
[49:47.660 --> 49:50.660]  we know this is affecting the kids more than anything.
[49:50.660 --> 49:53.660]  And I mean everybody should have their own choice.
[49:53.660 --> 49:56.660]  If you decide to do whatever, that's up to you.
[49:56.660 --> 50:02.660]  I mean give us, these are not given rights.
[50:02.660 --> 50:04.660]  Absolutely.
[50:04.660 --> 50:07.660]  You know there's an Israeli study that you're 13 to 27 times
[50:07.660 --> 50:10.660]  more immune than with these experimental shots
[50:10.660 --> 50:13.660]  but they lied to everybody and said they were 96% effective.
[50:13.660 --> 50:17.660]  I think you've got serious cause for lawsuits here
[50:17.660 --> 50:19.660]  for false advertising.
[50:19.660 --> 50:22.660]  I don't care that liability protection over damage
[50:22.660 --> 50:24.660]  but what about the false advertising?
[50:24.660 --> 50:25.660]  I mean this is fraud.
[50:25.660 --> 50:26.660]  And what was it?
[50:26.660 --> 50:30.660]  Did you see Biden's speech last night because Marie said
[50:30.660 --> 50:32.660]  he's running out of patience.
[50:32.660 --> 50:33.660]  So I guess he's running out of patience.
[50:33.660 --> 50:35.660]  You already basically gave him your sign.
[50:35.660 --> 50:38.660]  What do you think about him wanting more children?
[50:38.660 --> 50:40.660]  No, no, no.
[50:40.660 --> 50:42.660]  I mean this is not a sacrifice.
[50:42.660 --> 50:45.660]  I mean you know, I thought, you know,
[50:45.660 --> 50:47.660]  what I thought there, the kids are a future which
[50:47.660 --> 50:49.660]  will be protecting them.
[50:49.660 --> 50:53.660]  You know, I mean, I've seen an article in Houston
[50:53.660 --> 50:57.660]  where they've already taken up a bus, a medical bus
[50:57.660 --> 51:01.660]  to one of the schools and accompanied by a sheriff department
[51:01.660 --> 51:03.660]  trying to enforce a vaccine on kids.
[51:03.660 --> 51:04.660]  Intimidate, yeah.
[51:04.660 --> 51:05.660]  Yes.
[51:05.660 --> 51:08.660]  And I said, you know, I mean that's not right.
[51:08.660 --> 51:12.660]  There's no way, I mean, I'm sorry, I mean there's no way.
[51:12.660 --> 51:13.660]  No sir, it is wrong.
[51:13.660 --> 51:16.660]  And the first young person that dies after deputies are there,
[51:16.660 --> 51:18.660]  intimidating people via color of law
[51:18.660 --> 51:19.660]  when there's no law to take it.
[51:19.660 --> 51:21.660]  That's when the war is going to start.
[51:21.660 --> 51:23.660]  And I think they're really trying to start a civil war.
[51:23.660 --> 51:27.660]  I saw Klaus Schwab of the Bilderberg and Davos group say,
[51:27.660 --> 51:29.660]  I plan this to make them angry.
[51:29.660 --> 51:32.660]  So they want us to burn our own cities down so things collapse.
[51:32.660 --> 51:33.660]  And I don't think that's the answer.
[51:33.660 --> 51:37.660]  I think the answer is prosecuting the globalists
[51:37.660 --> 51:39.660]  that carried this out, sir.
[51:39.660 --> 51:44.660]  Yes sir, I mean, like I said, I'm just here to speak
[51:44.660 --> 51:48.660]  about my son, I just want to push it.
[51:48.660 --> 51:50.660]  I understand, and I've been asking a lot of questions,
[51:50.660 --> 51:51.660]  but we really appreciate you.
[51:51.660 --> 51:53.660]  If anybody wants to get in contact with you
[51:53.660 --> 51:55.660]  or talk to you or have you speak to their group,
[51:55.660 --> 51:57.660]  how do they do that, Ernest Ramirez?
[51:57.660 --> 51:59.660]  Talk about your son, Ernest Ramirez Jr.
[51:59.660 --> 52:01.660]  And then we got 10 minutes left.
[52:01.660 --> 52:02.660]  I appreciate your time.
[52:02.660 --> 52:05.660]  Anything else you'd like to add, please talk to us.
[52:05.660 --> 52:08.660]  I mean, like I said, I'm traveling out there.
[52:08.660 --> 52:11.660]  I have a flag made with my son's picture,
[52:11.660 --> 52:14.660]  along with my American flag, because like I said,
[52:14.660 --> 52:18.660]  from the beginning, I mean, I love the hell out of my country,
[52:18.660 --> 52:21.660]  but I don't trust my government anymore at all.
[52:21.660 --> 52:23.660]  I mean, so if they see me on the road,
[52:23.660 --> 52:25.660]  it doesn't matter at all, wave,
[52:25.660 --> 52:27.660]  they see me eating at a restaurant,
[52:27.660 --> 52:30.660]  they're more than welcome to come up, talk to me.
[52:30.660 --> 52:32.660]  You know, if they want to join in,
[52:32.660 --> 52:34.660]  they don't have to be on motorcycles.
[52:34.660 --> 52:37.660]  They join in on the pickup truck, cars, whatever.
[52:37.660 --> 52:40.660]  We just got to make noise, because I know for sure
[52:40.660 --> 52:42.660]  I'm not the only one that's having to.
[52:42.660 --> 52:44.660]  A lot of us think we deal with a problem
[52:44.660 --> 52:48.660]  and we try to go on with life, but he was my life.
[52:48.660 --> 52:49.660]  I have nothing left.
[52:49.660 --> 52:53.660]  So if I don't yell and scream on his behalf,
[52:53.660 --> 52:54.660]  it was good of mine.
[52:54.660 --> 52:56.660]  You know, I was here to protect my son,
[52:56.660 --> 52:58.660]  and if I can't, it means I had no more.
[52:58.660 --> 53:00.660]  I have to keep on.
[53:00.660 --> 53:03.660]  I have to raise this up
[53:03.660 --> 53:06.660]  and try to prevent another child from dying.
[53:06.660 --> 53:09.660]  Absolutely, that is exactly what you're doing here.
[53:09.660 --> 53:12.660]  Well, again, I understand what happened to your son
[53:12.660 --> 53:14.660]  and we appreciate your courage,
[53:14.660 --> 53:16.660]  and again, I understand the pressure.
[53:16.660 --> 53:18.660]  It's like, hey, it's safe, it's effective,
[53:18.660 --> 53:20.660]  but every other drug, if they tell you that,
[53:20.660 --> 53:22.660]  it's been approved, it's gone through five, ten years testing,
[53:22.660 --> 53:23.660]  but they lied about that.
[53:23.660 --> 53:24.660]  Now they say it's approved,
[53:24.660 --> 53:26.660]  they said another emergency authorization.
[53:26.660 --> 53:28.660]  So they lied to the public,
[53:28.660 --> 53:32.660]  and it's just very infuriating,
[53:32.660 --> 53:33.660]  more than frightening,
[53:33.660 --> 53:35.660]  it's infuriating that they know
[53:35.660 --> 53:37.660]  this doesn't protect children or young people.
[53:37.660 --> 53:40.660]  They know it particularly hurts teenage boys,
[53:40.660 --> 53:41.660]  and they're doing it,
[53:41.660 --> 53:45.660]  and it's just absolutely outrageous in my view.
[53:45.660 --> 53:47.660]  Yes, sir, and I don't like to...
[53:47.660 --> 53:50.660]  I don't like where I heard them say it's worth the risk.
[53:50.660 --> 53:51.660]  It's not.
[53:51.660 --> 53:53.660]  It wasn't, not to me.
[53:53.660 --> 53:55.660]  It wasn't worth it, you know,
[53:55.660 --> 53:57.660]  because I don't have them.
[53:57.660 --> 53:58.660]  I mean, there's no way...
[53:58.660 --> 54:00.660]  I'm never going to see them again, so...
[54:00.660 --> 54:02.660]  Well, you're going to see them in heaven, brother.
[54:02.660 --> 54:04.660]  There's a spiritual realm, we all know it in.
[54:04.660 --> 54:07.660]  You're a good man, and you're going to see your son again.
[54:07.660 --> 54:08.660]  Yes, sir.
[54:08.660 --> 54:09.660]  No, thank you.
[54:09.660 --> 54:10.660]  No, thank you.
[54:10.660 --> 54:11.660]  We've got a few more minutes left.
[54:11.660 --> 54:13.660]  Again, is there any way for people out there,
[54:13.660 --> 54:14.660]  because they're going to call us
[54:14.660 --> 54:15.660]  when they get in touch with you.
[54:15.660 --> 54:18.660]  Is it okay for us to give people your email, or...
[54:18.660 --> 54:20.660]  Yeah, you can give out my email,
[54:20.660 --> 54:23.660]  or I mean, if they want to send me a text,
[54:23.660 --> 54:25.660]  a text, a messenger, whatever,
[54:25.660 --> 54:27.660]  I answer everything, you know.
[54:27.660 --> 54:29.660]  I mean, if they want to talk, you know,
[54:29.660 --> 54:32.660]  or even if they want to send me prayers,
[54:32.660 --> 54:34.660]  how do you know?
[54:34.660 --> 54:36.660]  I'm for it.
[54:36.660 --> 54:40.660]  Well, it was very Christ-like of you and your son
[54:40.660 --> 54:42.660]  early on wanting to protect others
[54:42.660 --> 54:44.660]  and believing their lies
[54:44.660 --> 54:46.660]  to go out and do this to help others.
[54:46.660 --> 54:48.660]  And that's very Christ-like, laying down...
[54:48.660 --> 54:50.660]  I mean, your son laid down his life for others.
[54:50.660 --> 54:51.660]  He believed he was doing that.
[54:51.660 --> 54:53.660]  It was like a soldier, you know, that goes to a war
[54:53.660 --> 54:54.660]  that may not be perfect,
[54:54.660 --> 54:56.660]  but he believes he's helping people.
[54:56.660 --> 54:59.660]  And so, now out of this, I believe we're going to save...
[54:59.660 --> 55:01.660]  I believe your testimony is going to save
[55:01.660 --> 55:03.660]  thousands of people and turn the tide.
[55:03.660 --> 55:05.660]  And so, I think, you know,
[55:05.660 --> 55:09.660]  I think the devil's really stepped in.
[55:09.660 --> 55:11.660]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir, of course.
[55:11.660 --> 55:13.660]  I mean, the way I say it,
[55:13.660 --> 55:15.660]  I feel we're dead times already.
[55:15.660 --> 55:18.660]  There's a word, revelation is coming up.
[55:18.660 --> 55:21.660]  So, I mean, if I got a week, month, a year left,
[55:21.660 --> 55:24.660]  I'm going to continue the fight, you know.
[55:24.660 --> 55:26.660]  Oh, I agree with you.
[55:26.660 --> 55:28.660]  Exactly. Things are going to get so rough
[55:28.660 --> 55:29.660]  as we're going down this path
[55:29.660 --> 55:31.660]  that your son might be blessed.
[55:31.660 --> 55:33.660]  He's not here at this point.
[55:33.660 --> 55:34.660]  Yes, sir. That's why.
[55:34.660 --> 55:36.660]  I figured they took him first,
[55:36.660 --> 55:38.660]  so he wouldn't have to see what we're going to go through
[55:38.660 --> 55:40.660]  in the next few years, you know,
[55:40.660 --> 55:42.660]  because it's going to get worse.
[55:42.660 --> 55:44.660]  I don't see it getting better.
[55:44.660 --> 55:46.660]  Elaborate in the few minutes we have left, sir,
[55:46.660 --> 55:49.660]  about going from not trusting your government,
[55:49.660 --> 55:51.660]  because this is a globalist-occupied government.
[55:51.660 --> 55:54.660]  Obviously, it's a corporate-neural-order government.
[55:54.660 --> 55:57.660]  I mean, with the process of trusting more
[55:57.660 --> 56:01.660]  and now not trusting this entity.
[56:01.660 --> 56:05.660]  Well, like I said, you know, I love my country.
[56:05.660 --> 56:06.660]  National Military.
[56:06.660 --> 56:08.660]  My son, he was an ROTC.
[56:08.660 --> 56:11.660]  He wanted to go into the Air Force.
[56:11.660 --> 56:15.660]  And, you know, so, I mean, like I said,
[56:15.660 --> 56:18.660]  I'm here for my country 100%.
[56:18.660 --> 56:22.660]  But then the government lied to us constantly.
[56:22.660 --> 56:26.660]  I mean, we're fighting for ourselves, our country,
[56:26.660 --> 56:29.660]  and this is not a war.
[56:29.660 --> 56:32.660]  I mean, it seems like, I'm sorry,
[56:32.660 --> 56:34.660]  I feel like it's population control.
[56:34.660 --> 56:38.660]  I mean, you're just dropping people left and right,
[56:38.660 --> 56:40.660]  and it's not for a good cause.
[56:40.660 --> 56:44.660]  You know, we're not at war.
[56:44.660 --> 56:46.660]  And it's our own occupied government
[56:46.660 --> 56:48.660]  directing it against us and then covering it up
[56:48.660 --> 56:50.660]  and then covering up treatments for COVID-19
[56:50.660 --> 56:52.660]  so more die and sending sick people
[56:52.660 --> 56:54.660]  with COVID-19 to nursing homes to kill them.
[56:54.660 --> 56:57.660]  Yeah, these are ghouls. These are evil people.
[56:57.660 --> 56:58.660]  And good people can't believe it
[56:58.660 --> 57:00.660]  when it happens to them historically.
[57:00.660 --> 57:02.660]  And it comes every three generations or so.
[57:02.660 --> 57:04.660]  And notice, three generations.
[57:04.660 --> 57:06.660]  Yeah, the World War II generation.
[57:06.660 --> 57:07.660]  Yeah, the Baby Boomers now.
[57:07.660 --> 57:10.660]  This generation and evil, it's generally every three.
[57:10.660 --> 57:11.660]  Almost always.
[57:11.660 --> 57:12.660]  And we're in the middle of it.
[57:12.660 --> 57:15.660]  And more, the demons have risen, basically.
[57:15.660 --> 57:16.660]  And that's what we're facing.
[57:16.660 --> 57:19.660]  And your son was a casualty of this war, sir.
[57:19.660 --> 57:21.660]  Yes, sir. That's true.
[57:21.660 --> 57:23.660]  It's very true.
[57:23.660 --> 57:24.660]  All right, well, thank you.
[57:24.660 --> 57:25.660]  And God bless you.
[57:25.660 --> 57:28.660]  And I'd like to get you back on as things unfold.
[57:28.660 --> 57:31.660]  And I would like to get you over other broadcasts.
[57:31.660 --> 57:33.660]  You can have a testimony and save others.
[57:33.660 --> 57:36.660]  And, you know, continue to make sure
[57:36.660 --> 57:38.660]  that your son's memory lives on
[57:38.660 --> 57:40.660]  and has an effect to educate others.
[57:40.660 --> 57:44.660]  In the last couple of minutes, we have any other comments, sir.
[57:44.660 --> 57:49.660]  It's only been in the last 60 years
[57:49.660 --> 57:52.660]  that we've had satellites that can decently measure
[57:52.660 --> 57:54.660]  what's happening in the atmosphere.
[57:54.660 --> 57:56.660]  But if you look at all the different studies
[57:56.660 --> 57:57.660]  and reports about my NASA
[57:57.660 --> 57:59.660]  and other governments and other agencies,
[57:59.660 --> 58:02.660]  they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[58:02.660 --> 58:05.660]  The only constant, the only great truth is,
[58:05.660 --> 58:08.660]  change is the only constant.
[58:08.660 --> 58:11.660]  So, yes, climate change is totally real.
[58:11.660 --> 58:14.660]  But notice, first, they called it global freezing
[58:14.660 --> 58:15.660]  back in the 70s and 80s,
[58:15.660 --> 58:17.660]  and then it's going to be global warming,
[58:17.660 --> 58:19.660]  and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted to.
[58:19.660 --> 58:21.660]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[58:21.660 --> 58:23.660]  But did you know that man-made climate change
[58:23.660 --> 58:27.660]  is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations
[58:27.660 --> 58:30.660]  and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[58:30.660 --> 58:33.660]  They have weather control trees from 1979.
[58:33.660 --> 58:36.660]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather
[58:36.660 --> 58:37.660]  for a very long time.
[58:37.660 --> 58:39.660]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists
[58:39.660 --> 58:41.660]  won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spring,
[58:41.660 --> 58:44.660]  different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[58:44.660 --> 58:47.660]  So, yes, man-made climate change is real.
[58:50.660 --> 58:53.660]  The puppet leaders of nations across the planet
[58:53.660 --> 58:56.660]  are declaring their allegiance to the New World Order,
[58:56.660 --> 59:00.660]  and Democrat politicians have been announcing it here as well.
[59:00.660 --> 59:05.660]  That means allegiance to a tyrannical world corporate government
[59:05.660 --> 59:07.660]  established by the Rockefellers
[59:07.660 --> 59:10.660]  through the UN, and they want inside your bodies
[59:10.660 --> 59:12.660]  to put in you what they want, when they want,
[59:12.660 --> 59:16.660]  and to have the global digital-tracking COVID passes
[59:16.660 --> 59:21.660]  or vaccine passes to form the backbone of their New World ID.
[59:21.660 --> 59:24.660]  And now their puppet vice has announced
[59:24.660 --> 59:26.660]  the forced inoculation of 100 million Americans
[59:26.660 --> 59:30.660]  to keep their jobs in total violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[59:30.660 --> 59:31.660]  This is criminal.
[59:31.660 --> 59:33.660]  And he's lying saying it's an approved vaccine
[59:33.660 --> 59:35.660]  when they did not approve it.
[59:35.660 --> 59:37.660]  They said that's the 2025 maybe.
[59:37.660 --> 59:40.660]  They just expanded the emergency authorization.
[59:40.660 --> 59:43.660]  That's why the two-top scientists quit a week and a half ago.
[59:43.660 --> 59:46.660]  Well, you live to see an absolute New World Order world government.
[59:46.660 --> 59:49.660]  If you submit, they will totally enslave you.
[59:49.660 --> 59:52.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:03.660 --> 1:00:07.660]  It was 20 years ago, 20 years ago, coming up next week,
[1:00:07.660 --> 1:00:13.660]  that I saw a very popular website online called propagandamatrix.com.
[1:00:13.660 --> 1:00:18.660]  And I learned that a young 18-year-old man named Paul Joseph Watson
[1:00:18.660 --> 1:00:20.660]  in Sheffield, England was running it.
[1:00:20.660 --> 1:00:23.660]  I noticed he was linking to a lot of our videos and a lot of our articles.
[1:00:23.660 --> 1:00:28.660]  So I emailed him and said, hey, I'd like you to run a new website for me.
[1:00:28.660 --> 1:00:30.660]  And I've gotten a URL.
[1:00:30.660 --> 1:00:34.660]  Today, the site redirects to Band-on Video.
[1:00:34.660 --> 1:00:37.660]  But back 20 years ago, when we first launched it,
[1:00:37.660 --> 1:00:41.660]  within just a year, it got bigger than infowars.com.
[1:00:41.660 --> 1:00:44.660]  And the site grew over the years until about a decade ago
[1:00:44.660 --> 1:00:47.660]  when we started mainly focusing on infowars.com.
[1:00:47.660 --> 1:00:50.660]  And as I said today, it just redirects.
[1:00:50.660 --> 1:00:53.660]  But it's that name, prismplanet.com.
[1:00:53.660 --> 1:00:57.660]  When I looked at the UN documents, the Rockefeller documents,
[1:00:57.660 --> 1:01:00.660]  precursors to Operation Lockstep, and I saw them talking about
[1:01:00.660 --> 1:01:03.660]  using collapsed society, post-industrial world,
[1:01:03.660 --> 1:01:06.660]  that they were going to corporately trigger,
[1:01:06.660 --> 1:01:10.660]  I thought, wow, this is a prison planet, compact cities,
[1:01:10.660 --> 1:01:15.660]  special computer systems based in your phone that would track and trace you.
[1:01:15.660 --> 1:01:17.660]  This was all in the documents 20 years ago.
[1:01:17.660 --> 1:01:22.660]  I said, this is a prison planet that they're building.
[1:01:22.660 --> 1:01:25.660]  And now here we are in the year 2021.
[1:01:25.660 --> 1:01:28.660]  And September 11 has come and gone.
[1:01:28.660 --> 1:01:31.660]  And Canada announced, they're coming out with a social credit score.
[1:01:31.660 --> 1:01:36.660]  Europe's announcing it all based on the vaccine passports.
[1:01:36.660 --> 1:01:40.660]  And they said, oh, this will help us merge with the Chinese credit score.
[1:01:40.660 --> 1:01:43.660]  Canada just announced that a few days ago.
[1:01:43.660 --> 1:01:45.660]  Greg Riesch has had a report on it.
[1:01:45.660 --> 1:01:47.660]  It's breaking right now at Bandai Video.
[1:01:47.660 --> 1:01:51.660]  But what an incredible time to be alive and to be witnessing all of this.
[1:01:51.660 --> 1:01:54.660]  And now here in the U.S. and in Europe, we see the so-called leaders,
[1:01:54.660 --> 1:01:57.660]  the puppets saying, our patience is worn thin.
[1:01:57.660 --> 1:02:00.660]  This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[1:02:00.660 --> 1:02:04.660]  You're making everyone sick, even though the facts are it's the shedding viruses.
[1:02:04.660 --> 1:02:07.660]  It's the mutations from the vaccine that are causing it.
[1:02:07.660 --> 1:02:08.660]  That's mainline science.
[1:02:08.660 --> 1:02:10.660]  They admit it, but they know the public is ignorant.
[1:02:10.660 --> 1:02:13.660]  And Australian leaders are the public is getting angry.
[1:02:13.660 --> 1:02:15.660]  They're going to come after you.
[1:02:15.660 --> 1:02:17.660]  They're going to get on their front foot against you.
[1:02:17.660 --> 1:02:18.660]  That means attack.
[1:02:18.660 --> 1:02:20.660]  So you better take it.
[1:02:20.660 --> 1:02:23.660]  Oh, and by the way, there's five, 10, 15 shots that's never going to stop.
[1:02:23.660 --> 1:02:27.660]  So they're making their move on this and they want the fight over the vaccines.
[1:02:27.660 --> 1:02:31.660]  They want to organize the idiots, the mob that doesn't know the science
[1:02:31.660 --> 1:02:32.660]  and the facts against us.
[1:02:32.660 --> 1:02:36.660]  So now, when I said years ago, they're going to use force inoculation.
[1:02:36.660 --> 1:02:38.660]  They're going to say, those of us that haven't taken the shots,
[1:02:38.660 --> 1:02:42.660]  the reason there's plagues, when they're the ones at the UN level releasing it,
[1:02:42.660 --> 1:02:46.660]  we could see all the pieces in accurate predictive a long time ago.
[1:02:46.660 --> 1:02:48.660]  But now it's here.
[1:02:48.660 --> 1:02:52.660]  And so ladies and gentlemen, we have to get very, very aggressive, nonviolent,
[1:02:52.660 --> 1:02:58.660]  but aggressive about our rights and get the globalist faces now because it is on.
[1:02:58.660 --> 1:03:04.660]  I sent producers on this Sunday and Owen's host on the show dozens of video clips of Democrats
[1:03:04.660 --> 1:03:09.660]  and Don Lemon and talk show host calling basically for aggressive action,
[1:03:09.660 --> 1:03:11.660]  saying we're like drunk drivers when we don't take the shots.
[1:03:11.660 --> 1:03:15.660]  We're like our children are like suicide bombers when they don't wear a mask.
[1:03:15.660 --> 1:03:17.660]  The Christians are terrorists.
[1:03:17.660 --> 1:03:18.660]  They're going to link up with the Taliban.
[1:03:18.660 --> 1:03:22.660]  Now you saw George W. Bush say that in a speech on 9-11.
[1:03:22.660 --> 1:03:23.660]  This is serious.
[1:03:23.660 --> 1:03:24.660]  This is their move.
[1:03:24.660 --> 1:03:26.660]  We know their attack plan.
[1:03:26.660 --> 1:03:27.660]  We've got to reject it.
[1:03:27.660 --> 1:03:30.660]  The good news is people are rejecting it everywhere.
[1:03:30.660 --> 1:03:34.660]  Now the globalist pushed too hard, it's going to look like what's happening in Spain
[1:03:34.660 --> 1:03:37.660]  where they're now burning down police stations.
[1:03:37.660 --> 1:03:39.660]  So this is accelerating very quickly.
[1:03:39.660 --> 1:03:41.660]  The tyrants can't help themselves.
[1:03:41.660 --> 1:03:42.660]  It's their nature.
[1:03:42.660 --> 1:03:45.660]  Klaus Schwab and the Rothschilds are going to sit back and watch things burn.
[1:03:45.660 --> 1:03:46.660]  That's their plan.
[1:03:46.660 --> 1:03:50.660]  I'd rather us all come together, the police, the military, the good leaders
[1:03:50.660 --> 1:03:54.660]  and all our governments and recognize the great reset and fully reject it.
[1:03:54.660 --> 1:03:55.660]  All right.
[1:03:55.660 --> 1:03:58.660]  Owen Schroder is going to come back and again host the rest of the hour.
[1:03:58.660 --> 1:04:00.660]  There's a lot to cover.
[1:04:00.660 --> 1:04:05.660]  And then coming up in the regular show that he hosts, Sunday Live, we've got Dr. Bartlett
[1:04:05.660 --> 1:04:08.660]  who is amazing, formerly the head of Rick Perry's Medical Commission.
[1:04:08.660 --> 1:04:09.660]  He's a really smart guy.
[1:04:09.660 --> 1:04:12.660]  Exposing the whole agenda, the fact that it's a bio weapon.
[1:04:12.660 --> 1:04:14.660]  They're suppressing treatments on.
[1:04:14.660 --> 1:04:17.660]  Very powerful interview I did for a special Saturday Transmission.
[1:04:17.660 --> 1:04:19.660]  Supposed to demand out video, but that's coming up.
[1:04:19.660 --> 1:04:21.660]  And so much more.
[1:04:21.660 --> 1:04:26.660]  Steve Quayle, all of it coming up on Sunday Live at 6 p.m. Central.
[1:04:26.660 --> 1:04:29.660]  To the regular Sunday, Alex Jones show and Owen Schroder.
[1:04:29.660 --> 1:04:31.660]  Please be part of the solution.
[1:04:31.660 --> 1:04:32.660]  Be part of the fight.
[1:04:32.660 --> 1:04:33.660]  Take this live feed.
[1:04:33.660 --> 1:04:34.660]  Share it right now.
[1:04:34.660 --> 1:04:36.660]  Tell folks what the local station you're listening to.
[1:04:36.660 --> 1:04:37.660]  That's how we override the sensors.
[1:04:37.660 --> 1:04:42.660]  And you've been doing it and we're starting to turn the tide all over the world.
[1:04:42.660 --> 1:04:45.660]  Like in the UK, they're pulling back on the vaccine passports right now.
[1:04:45.660 --> 1:04:46.660]  Quote for the winner.
[1:04:46.660 --> 1:04:48.660]  Because people rebelled and shut it down successfully.
[1:04:48.660 --> 1:04:50.660]  We'll be right back with Owen Schroder.
[1:04:50.660 --> 1:04:57.660]  Broadcasting of Imple Wars Headquarters, ImpleWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[1:04:57.660 --> 1:05:06.660]  If you think the puppet president, Joe Biden, coming out and announcing that 100 million Americans
[1:05:06.660 --> 1:05:10.660]  are going to be forced to take experimental shots or lose their jobs.
[1:05:10.660 --> 1:05:13.660]  Understand we know the blueprint of the UN.
[1:05:13.660 --> 1:05:14.660]  They stated their plan.
[1:05:14.660 --> 1:05:16.660]  Contact tracers coming to your house.
[1:05:16.660 --> 1:05:18.660]  10 forced injections a year.
[1:05:18.660 --> 1:05:21.660]  The destruction of your immune system.
[1:05:21.660 --> 1:05:23.660]  The depopulation of the planet.
[1:05:23.660 --> 1:05:27.660]  And the vaccine passport on your quote iPhone or droid.
[1:05:27.660 --> 1:05:29.660]  Tracking and tracing everything you do.
[1:05:29.660 --> 1:05:32.660]  And telling you when you can go outside your house or where you can go.
[1:05:32.660 --> 1:05:35.660]  Not just for COVID-19, but for carbon taxes.
[1:05:35.660 --> 1:05:39.660]  So as I've said a thousand times, submission is death.
[1:05:39.660 --> 1:05:41.660]  You give in to this just for your job.
[1:05:41.660 --> 1:05:42.660]  Or to be able to go to the bar.
[1:05:42.660 --> 1:05:44.660]  Or to be able to quote flight and airplane.
[1:05:44.660 --> 1:05:49.660]  Then they're going to slowly put the screws in with these apps on your phone.
[1:05:49.660 --> 1:05:51.660]  To control where you go and what you do.
[1:05:51.660 --> 1:05:52.660]  And dog train you.
[1:05:52.660 --> 1:05:53.660]  Ride a total slavery.
[1:05:53.660 --> 1:05:54.660]  This is criminal.
[1:05:54.660 --> 1:05:55.660]  It's illegal.
[1:05:55.660 --> 1:05:56.660]  It's tyranny.
[1:05:56.660 --> 1:05:58.660]  And we must resist and not comply.
[1:06:07.660 --> 1:06:08.660]  You found it.
[1:06:08.660 --> 1:06:10.660]  The tip of the spear.
[1:06:10.660 --> 1:06:15.660]  It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[1:06:28.660 --> 1:06:32.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're into the second hour of the Alex Jones show.
[1:06:32.660 --> 1:06:35.660]  We're going to cover a lot of news here.
[1:06:35.660 --> 1:06:39.660]  And then you're going to want to stick around for Sunday night live.
[1:06:39.660 --> 1:06:43.660]  A very powerful interview with yet another doctor.
[1:06:43.660 --> 1:06:48.660]  Alex Jones and Dr. Richard Bartlett discussing COVID and the vaccines.
[1:06:48.660 --> 1:06:51.660]  This is once again just one of the doctors that's come on air with us.
[1:06:51.660 --> 1:06:58.660]  And just given us hours of hardcore must see and share information that you can only get here.
[1:06:58.660 --> 1:07:00.660]  Because everybody else is afraid to talk about it.
[1:07:00.660 --> 1:07:03.660]  Because they know it means censorship from the internet.
[1:07:03.660 --> 1:07:05.660]  Well, we don't really have that fear here.
[1:07:05.660 --> 1:07:07.660]  We've already been censored everywhere.
[1:07:07.660 --> 1:07:09.660]  We're not that we would be afraid of that anyway.
[1:07:09.660 --> 1:07:11.660]  That's why they censor us.
[1:07:11.660 --> 1:07:13.660]  So that's all coming up.
[1:07:13.660 --> 1:07:21.660]  And remember that it's all possible with your financial support at info wars store.com.

[1:07:40.660 --> 1:07:42.660]  I start every day with vitamin mineral fusion.

[1:08:19.660 --> 1:08:22.660]  which means fall and then winter.
[1:08:22.660 --> 1:08:26.660]  That's when people usually get sick because you're not getting as much sun.
[1:08:26.660 --> 1:08:28.660]  The weather gets colder.
[1:08:28.660 --> 1:08:30.660]  Everybody knows that's when the flu season starts.
[1:08:30.660 --> 1:08:36.660]  So that's why we sell vitamin D stock up on it winter sun vitamin D at info wars store.com.

[1:08:44.660 --> 1:08:48.660]  All right, let me get back into this stack of news here.
[1:08:48.660 --> 1:09:01.660]  Dealing with COVID and the vaccines as you just saw the interview that has been censored everywhere.
[1:09:01.660 --> 1:09:06.660]  And so we'll get back to that.
[1:09:06.660 --> 1:09:15.660]  Ernest Ramirez who lost his son to the vaccine mandate and the pressure from society.
[1:09:15.660 --> 1:09:18.660]  But they're not done.
[1:09:18.660 --> 1:09:19.660]  They're not done.
[1:09:19.660 --> 1:09:21.660]  They're not going to back off these mandates.
[1:09:21.660 --> 1:09:24.660]  In fact, there's going to be more strict mandates coming from the Biden regime.
[1:09:24.660 --> 1:09:29.660]  There's going to be probably they're going to start threatening action legal action against you.
[1:09:29.660 --> 1:09:31.660]  They've already talked about the fines.
[1:09:31.660 --> 1:09:34.660]  They'll come subsidize your wages if they can.
[1:09:34.660 --> 1:09:36.660]  They'll take away your Medicaid.
[1:09:36.660 --> 1:09:38.660]  They'll take away your social security.
[1:09:38.660 --> 1:09:42.660]  They'll take away they'll take away anything your health care anything that you are reliant on them for.
[1:09:42.660 --> 1:09:44.660]  They will take it away until you get this vaccine.
[1:09:44.660 --> 1:09:48.660]  Natural immunity be damned.
[1:09:48.660 --> 1:09:51.660]  And the surgeon general has come out and said.
[1:09:51.660 --> 1:10:02.660]  He expects Biden or he knows Biden will be making more actions on COVID-19 vaccines before he meets with the UN on Tuesday.
[1:10:02.660 --> 1:10:13.660]  So if they can get Biden out of bed, maybe lure him with some tapioca pudding and get him out of bed and get him all cleaned up and hopped up on whatever it is that they do to get him to talk.
[1:10:13.660 --> 1:10:17.660]  And he'll probably make an announcement tomorrow.
[1:10:17.660 --> 1:10:24.660]  Or if he can't hack it, he'll send up sake or maybe some other spokesperson to do that.
[1:10:24.660 --> 1:10:27.660]  But that will be announced most likely tomorrow.
[1:10:27.660 --> 1:10:31.660]  This story is breaking and very telling.
[1:10:31.660 --> 1:10:37.660]  Of course, it was it was well known, but now it's it's going viral, if you will.
[1:10:37.660 --> 1:10:46.660]  26 out of 27 scientists who claimed Wuhan COVID origins were conspiracy theories had direct ties to the Wuhan lab.
[1:10:46.660 --> 1:10:48.660]  Oh, go figure.
[1:10:48.660 --> 1:11:00.660]  Kind of like how the media and big tech that wants to censor all the negative vaccine stories how they have direct relations to the big pharmaceutical vaccine manufacturers.
[1:11:00.660 --> 1:11:06.660]  Yeah, kind of like how Biden.
[1:11:06.660 --> 1:11:11.660]  I forget where the numbers where I covered them a couple weeks ago.
[1:11:11.660 --> 1:11:16.660]  Big pharmaceutical companies, Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson and others.
[1:11:16.660 --> 1:11:18.660]  Big donors to the Biden campaign.
[1:11:18.660 --> 1:11:21.660]  Big, big donors to the Biden campaign.
[1:11:21.660 --> 1:11:25.660]  Big, big donors to Democrat super PACs that helped get Biden in.
[1:11:25.660 --> 1:11:33.660]  And so they all you mean the people funded by big pharma want to mandate a big pharma product.
[1:11:33.660 --> 1:11:37.660]  I can't wrap my head around it. How does that work?
[1:11:37.660 --> 1:11:42.660]  So, but at the time, if you would have reported.
[1:11:42.660 --> 1:11:48.660]  And many did that the scientists.
[1:11:48.660 --> 1:11:52.660]  They were covering up the Wuhan lab theory.
[1:11:52.660 --> 1:11:57.660]  The truth covering up the truth about the COVID origins.
[1:11:57.660 --> 1:12:01.660]  Yeah, there's a Moderna stock skyrocketing.
[1:12:01.660 --> 1:12:03.660]  Oh, and they're thanking Biden and Fauci.
[1:12:03.660 --> 1:12:09.660]  You better believe it and they'll be thanking him again next campaign cycle with millions of dollars and donations.
[1:12:09.660 --> 1:12:12.660]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[1:12:12.660 --> 1:12:16.660]  Because they care about you.
[1:12:16.660 --> 1:12:22.660]  See if you would have shared about the 26 doctors that were working in the Wuhan lab that told you it didn't exist.
[1:12:22.660 --> 1:12:24.660]  You would have been censored then.
[1:12:24.660 --> 1:12:29.660]  Oh, now it comes out as truth a year after they censored the information how convenient.
[1:12:29.660 --> 1:12:37.660]  And of course, here it is father whose son died from vaccine induced heart inflammation censored by big tech.
[1:12:37.660 --> 1:12:40.660]  But these stories are just continuing to get worse.
[1:12:40.660 --> 1:12:46.660]  Heart inflammation in teens explodes across US after FDA approves injections.
[1:12:46.660 --> 1:12:50.660]  And the story is there at info wars.com.
[1:12:50.660 --> 1:12:55.660]  And sadly, it's not just Ernest Ramirez and his son.
[1:12:55.660 --> 1:13:02.660]  It's a bunch of teens high school aged college age athletes, you know, healthy everything.
[1:13:02.660 --> 1:13:04.660]  You get the vaccine.
[1:13:04.660 --> 1:13:05.660]  Boom.
[1:13:05.660 --> 1:13:06.660]  You get myocarditis.
[1:13:06.660 --> 1:13:07.660]  You get a blood clot.
[1:13:07.660 --> 1:13:08.660]  You end up in the hospital.
[1:13:08.660 --> 1:13:11.660]  You die.
[1:13:11.660 --> 1:13:14.660]  When most people probably already have natural immunity.
[1:13:14.660 --> 1:13:23.660]  And whether you do or you don't, there's a 99.9% chance that you would survive this virus even if you got it.
[1:13:23.660 --> 1:13:25.660]  Now, these new variants may be worse.
[1:13:25.660 --> 1:13:26.660]  Maybe the numbers are worse.
[1:13:26.660 --> 1:13:27.660]  Maybe they're not.
[1:13:27.660 --> 1:13:30.660]  Maybe it's a it's a worse experience with the new variants.
[1:13:30.660 --> 1:13:35.660]  By the way, all these different Greek alphabet letters that are using is time to just drop that act.
[1:13:35.660 --> 1:13:38.660]  It's the vaccine variants.
[1:13:38.660 --> 1:13:41.660]  It's the vaccine variants.
[1:13:41.660 --> 1:13:42.660]  That's what it is.
[1:13:42.660 --> 1:13:43.660]  It's not Delta.
[1:13:43.660 --> 1:13:46.660]  It's not Mu or whatever or Lambda or who knows.
[1:13:46.660 --> 1:13:48.660]  It's the vaccine variants.
[1:13:48.660 --> 1:13:50.660]  There may be dozens, hundreds.
[1:13:50.660 --> 1:13:51.660]  I don't know.
[1:13:51.660 --> 1:13:54.660]  It's the vaccine variants.
[1:13:54.660 --> 1:13:57.660]  That's what it needs to be called.
[1:13:57.660 --> 1:14:01.660]  And of course, in Australia, you're seeing the worst tyranny of all.
[1:14:01.660 --> 1:14:03.660]  Ah, yes, there it is.
[1:14:03.660 --> 1:14:06.660]  Nobel Peace Prize winner reveals vaccines are causing the variants.
[1:14:06.660 --> 1:14:07.660]  Yeah, we called that.
[1:14:07.660 --> 1:14:09.660]  I mean, that was just science.
[1:14:09.660 --> 1:14:12.660]  But oh, yeah, follow the science, but ignore the real science.
[1:14:12.660 --> 1:14:16.660]  The tyranny is worse in Australia than probably anywhere else.
[1:14:16.660 --> 1:14:21.660]  And now they have banned the use of Ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment.
[1:14:21.660 --> 1:14:26.660]  Unbelievable.
[1:14:26.660 --> 1:14:28.660]  It's so frustrating.
[1:14:28.660 --> 1:14:29.660]  I mean, it's beyond frustrating.
[1:14:29.660 --> 1:14:36.660]  It's angering, enraging when you have statements coming out of the White House and Biden,
[1:14:36.660 --> 1:14:40.660]  where he says, we're going to do everything possible to stop this virus.
[1:14:40.660 --> 1:14:43.660]  We're going to do everything possible to beat this variant.
[1:14:43.660 --> 1:14:44.660]  Okay, how about Ivermectin?
[1:14:44.660 --> 1:14:46.660]  Not that.
[1:14:46.660 --> 1:14:50.660]  What about hydroxychloroquine and zinc and vitamin D and Z-packs and all that that's been proven?
[1:14:50.660 --> 1:14:52.660]  No, no, no, we're not doing that.
[1:14:52.660 --> 1:14:53.660]  No.
[1:14:53.660 --> 1:14:55.660]  What about Regeneron that's worked for so many people?
[1:14:55.660 --> 1:14:57.660]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:14:57.660 --> 1:14:58.660]  What about natural immunity?
[1:14:58.660 --> 1:15:01.660]  I've not, no, no, no, no.
[1:15:01.660 --> 1:15:02.660]  Didn't you hear me?
[1:15:02.660 --> 1:15:05.660]  I said, we're going to do anything possible to stop this virus.
[1:15:05.660 --> 1:15:07.660]  We're going to do anything possible.
[1:15:07.660 --> 1:15:09.660]  Just not Ivermectin or anything big pharma doesn't want us to do.
[1:15:09.660 --> 1:15:11.660]  That's all.
[1:15:11.660 --> 1:15:14.660]  And by the way, it's not about freedom.
[1:15:14.660 --> 1:15:17.660]  I mean, the audacity.
[1:15:17.660 --> 1:15:21.660]  You know, people say, oh, you know, I don't like what aboutism.
[1:15:21.660 --> 1:15:29.660]  No, I think what aboutism is perfectly fair because it shows how fraudulent and phony and corrupt people are.
[1:15:29.660 --> 1:15:33.660]  When you take a situation, you apply it to two entities or two people or whatever,
[1:15:33.660 --> 1:15:35.660]  and you gauge the response.
[1:15:35.660 --> 1:15:38.660]  And that just shows you, is somebody genuine or are they a liar and a fraud?
[1:15:38.660 --> 1:15:41.660]  Imagine if Donald Trump said it's not about freedom.
[1:15:41.660 --> 1:15:44.660]  Imagine if Donald Trump was mandating the vaccines.
[1:15:44.660 --> 1:15:46.660]  Trump didn't even want to mandate the vaccine.
[1:15:46.660 --> 1:15:50.660]  He just said Operation Warp Speed and they said the vaccine is going to kill people.
[1:15:50.660 --> 1:15:51.660]  Don't take the vaccine.
[1:15:51.660 --> 1:15:57.660]  And then overnight, they changed their minds because they're liars and now murderers, I guess.
[1:15:57.660 --> 1:16:06.660]  On September 9th, 2021, the public president, Joe Biden, publicly declared war against America.
[1:16:06.660 --> 1:16:14.660]  He then announced dictatorial powers unto himself and announced forced inoculations against the American people.
[1:16:14.660 --> 1:16:20.660]  He is a puppet of the United Nations and the Rockefeller Combined of Corporations that put him in power
[1:16:20.660 --> 1:16:24.660]  and he is making a very serious move against the American people.
[1:16:24.660 --> 1:16:29.660]  But the attack he's launched is being launched against every other western country on the planet
[1:16:29.660 --> 1:16:32.660]  by these corporations that have already enslaved the third world.
[1:16:32.660 --> 1:16:36.660]  What they're doing is illegal on its face, violates our federal and state laws
[1:16:36.660 --> 1:16:39.660]  and the Geneva Convention as well as the Nuremberg Code.
[1:16:39.660 --> 1:16:41.660]  It's very, very simple.
[1:16:41.660 --> 1:16:45.660]  We have to decide whether we're going to surrender to this globalist corporate takeover,
[1:16:45.660 --> 1:16:48.660]  whether we're going to stand up with our birthright and say no,
[1:16:48.660 --> 1:16:51.660]  and then prosecute these criminals for their crimes against humanity
[1:16:51.660 --> 1:16:54.660]  so other criminals in the future don't dare try it.
[1:16:54.660 --> 1:16:56.660]  The choice is up to us.
[1:16:58.660 --> 1:17:01.660]  This headline is not a joke.
[1:17:01.660 --> 1:17:06.660]  This is America in September of 2020.
[1:17:06.660 --> 1:17:14.660]  TC Court sends man to jail for watching conspiracy theory videos online.
[1:17:14.660 --> 1:17:21.660]  Yes, it says the police did a spot check for, quote, compliance at his home
[1:17:21.660 --> 1:17:27.660]  and found him in his garage watching rumble social media site,
[1:17:27.660 --> 1:17:31.660]  which they say is a conspiracy site.
[1:17:31.660 --> 1:17:36.660]  Also, he admitted to watching Mike Lindell's three-day cyber symposium.
[1:17:36.660 --> 1:17:39.660]  Yes, it was part of the conditions of his bail.
[1:17:39.660 --> 1:17:44.660]  The judge said he could not look at any videos questioning the election.
[1:17:44.660 --> 1:17:45.660]  No joke.
[1:17:45.660 --> 1:17:49.660]  And so they sent the stars into his house and caught him doing it.
[1:17:49.660 --> 1:17:51.660]  So now he's going into solitary confinement.
[1:17:51.660 --> 1:17:53.660]  Communism has come to America.
[1:17:53.660 --> 1:17:57.660]  The republic has fallen.
[1:17:57.660 --> 1:18:00.660]  I am cutting this ad on Thursday afternoon.
[1:18:00.660 --> 1:18:03.660]  That means you've got one, two, three, four days.
[1:18:03.660 --> 1:18:06.660]  Monday at midnight, we've got to end this sale.
[1:18:06.660 --> 1:18:10.660]  We may end it earlier because we think it'll sell out by then at current sales rates.
[1:18:10.660 --> 1:18:12.660]  Vitamin mineral fusion is super popular.
[1:18:12.660 --> 1:18:15.660]  It's got all the high-quality vitamins and minerals that are essential,
[1:18:15.660 --> 1:18:17.660]  great amino acids, and it tastes great.
[1:18:17.660 --> 1:18:22.660]  It's powder formed, so in the water you absorb it more when you drink the fruit punch.
[1:18:22.660 --> 1:18:25.660]  And we also have, back in stock, this sale will continue through next week.

[1:18:57.660 --> 1:19:03.660]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[1:19:03.660 --> 1:19:07.660]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses,
[1:19:07.660 --> 1:19:11.660]  which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[1:19:11.660 --> 1:19:15.660]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland
[1:19:15.660 --> 1:19:18.660]  and shuts down its natural functions.
[1:19:18.660 --> 1:19:21.660]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[1:19:21.660 --> 1:19:24.660]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[1:19:24.660 --> 1:19:27.660]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye.
[1:19:27.660 --> 1:19:30.660]  Also described as the seat of the soul,
[1:19:30.660 --> 1:19:34.660]  the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness
[1:19:34.660 --> 1:19:37.660]  and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[1:19:37.660 --> 1:19:42.660]  Fluoride-free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[1:19:42.660 --> 1:19:48.660]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride-free
[1:19:48.660 --> 1:19:51.660]  and the propure shower head will seal the deal.
[1:19:51.660 --> 1:20:13.660]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com.
[1:20:21.660 --> 1:20:40.660]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back here on the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:40.660 --> 1:20:46.660]  I'm thinking about taking some phone calls ahead of this epic interview coming up.
[1:20:46.660 --> 1:20:48.660]  Alex Jones and Dr. Richard Bartlett,
[1:20:48.660 --> 1:20:52.660]  because I can probably get through the rest of these news stories here.
[1:20:52.660 --> 1:21:01.660]  And you've probably seen these videos already
[1:21:01.660 --> 1:21:05.660]  and we may just continue to cover these during the weekday transmissions,
[1:21:05.660 --> 1:21:11.660]  but thinking about maybe taking some phone calls, at least for a segment, maybe.
[1:21:11.660 --> 1:21:16.660]  So let's do that, guys. Let me put out the phone number and let's just load up some calls here.
[1:21:16.660 --> 1:21:19.660]  I'm going to be able to get through this news and probably even the video clips.
[1:21:19.660 --> 1:21:22.660]  We'll have time for at least one segment of calls before the big interview coming up.
[1:21:22.660 --> 1:21:25.660]  You're not going to want to miss, folks. It's a must share, must see.
[1:21:25.660 --> 1:21:32.660]  877-789-2539.
[1:21:32.660 --> 1:21:38.660]  What have you heard from your employer or what are you hearing about this vaccine mandate?
[1:21:38.660 --> 1:21:43.660]  It's affecting everybody in some way, shape, or form, or at least somebody you know probably.
[1:21:43.660 --> 1:21:47.660]  I know a couple of people who are wondering what to do, but the good news is most of the people I've talked to
[1:21:47.660 --> 1:21:51.660]  that are affected by this, the companies they work for are basically saying,
[1:21:51.660 --> 1:21:53.660]  no, not here. We're not doing that.
[1:21:53.660 --> 1:21:55.660]  And then if you live in a state where the Attorney General has come out,
[1:21:55.660 --> 1:21:58.660]  where I believe it's 28 states in the United States now,
[1:21:58.660 --> 1:22:01.660]  have said, no, we're not going to implement vaccine mandates.
[1:22:01.660 --> 1:22:04.660]  What Biden has done is completely illegal.
[1:22:04.660 --> 1:22:05.660]  So that's pretty amazing.
[1:22:05.660 --> 1:22:07.660]  So we'll take some calls on that.
[1:22:07.660 --> 1:22:12.660]  How this vaccine mandate is affecting you, your employer, your employees, whatever.
[1:22:12.660 --> 1:22:14.660]  Because we're just beginning this.
[1:22:14.660 --> 1:22:19.660]  And now Biden expected to make more tyrannical statements even tomorrow.
[1:22:19.660 --> 1:22:23.660]  Let me just get through the rest of this news here as they are getting those calls lined up.
[1:22:23.660 --> 1:22:30.660]  Trump snubs DC elites 9-11 ceremony to spend time with police and firefighters in New York City.
[1:22:30.660 --> 1:22:34.660]  And I've got all kinds of video on this.
[1:22:34.660 --> 1:22:39.660]  And the story is info wars.com showing how Trump was getting attacked by the media
[1:22:39.660 --> 1:22:43.660]  for not showing up with the Bushes and the Obamas and the Clintons and the Bidens.
[1:22:43.660 --> 1:22:45.660]  You know, the most corrupt among us.
[1:22:45.660 --> 1:22:50.660]  And he actually was in New York with police officers and firefighters.
[1:22:50.660 --> 1:22:52.660]  And there's some pretty cool videos that have come out of that.
[1:22:52.660 --> 1:22:54.660]  I'm going to cover those tomorrow.
[1:22:54.660 --> 1:22:59.660]  But that was a smart move by Trump, not to be with the DC criminals,
[1:22:59.660 --> 1:23:06.660]  but to go out with the actual firefighters and police and separate himself from that criminal cabal.
[1:23:06.660 --> 1:23:07.660]  And that's really what it was about.
[1:23:07.660 --> 1:23:09.660]  And hey, they don't like him. They don't want him.
[1:23:09.660 --> 1:23:12.660]  So why should he go hang out with them?
[1:23:12.660 --> 1:23:14.660]  They're our corrupt politicians.
[1:23:14.660 --> 1:23:16.660]  They're the ones that have destroyed this country.
[1:23:16.660 --> 1:23:22.660]  Look no further than the group of people at the 9-11 ceremonies in DC
[1:23:22.660 --> 1:23:24.660]  if you want to find out who destroyed America.
[1:23:24.660 --> 1:23:28.660]  Look no further than those lying criminals.
[1:23:28.660 --> 1:23:33.660]  And by the way, the speech that Bush gave basically calling Americans terrorists.
[1:23:33.660 --> 1:23:37.660]  Remember Bush, if you're either with us or you're with the terrorists,
[1:23:37.660 --> 1:23:40.660]  well now Bush has changed that onto the people.
[1:23:40.660 --> 1:23:43.660]  Now Bush has said that the American people are the terrorists.
[1:23:43.660 --> 1:23:46.660]  So it's been amazing to watch all of these Republicans and conservatives
[1:23:46.660 --> 1:23:49.660]  that have now finally realized who George Bush really was.
[1:23:49.660 --> 1:23:51.660]  He was never on your team.
[1:23:51.660 --> 1:23:53.660]  He was a corrupt politician as the rest of them.
[1:23:53.660 --> 1:23:55.660]  He may have said some things you liked.
[1:23:55.660 --> 1:23:57.660]  He may have been from the party you liked.
[1:23:57.660 --> 1:24:00.660]  But he was just as corrupt as the one before and the one after.
[1:24:00.660 --> 1:24:03.660]  George Bush.
[1:24:03.660 --> 1:24:05.660]  But that's a good thing.
[1:24:05.660 --> 1:24:07.660]  This is an awakening moment for America.
[1:24:07.660 --> 1:24:11.660]  This is a self-awareness, self-realization moment for America.
[1:24:11.660 --> 1:24:13.660]  Bush was never on your team.
[1:24:13.660 --> 1:24:15.660]  And so for him to come out and say,
[1:24:15.660 --> 1:24:17.660]  yep, the American people are terrorists now,
[1:24:17.660 --> 1:24:19.660]  that had a lot of veterans and a lot of Americans
[1:24:19.660 --> 1:24:28.660]  finally realizing that Bush was never on their team.
[1:24:28.660 --> 1:24:32.660]  So that's a good awakening process for people to be having.
[1:24:32.660 --> 1:24:34.660]  Family of Trump supporter,
[1:24:34.660 --> 1:24:36.660]  murdered by Antifa militant,
[1:24:36.660 --> 1:24:39.660]  files lawsuit against Portland City Mayor and District Attorney,
[1:24:39.660 --> 1:24:41.660]  the estate of Aaron J. Danielson,
[1:24:41.660 --> 1:24:44.660]  who is murdered by Antifa militant, Michael Rainel,
[1:24:44.660 --> 1:24:46.660]  following a pro-Trump rally,
[1:24:46.660 --> 1:24:48.660]  has filed lawsuit against the city of Portland,
[1:24:48.660 --> 1:24:52.660]  the mayor and the district attorney for negligence.
[1:24:52.660 --> 1:24:56.660]  Can you imagine if it was a Democrat
[1:24:56.660 --> 1:25:00.660]  leaving a Democrat event that got shot by a conservative
[1:25:00.660 --> 1:25:02.660]  or a Trump supporter, can you imagine?
[1:25:02.660 --> 1:25:05.660]  It'd be the top story. It'd be the biggest thing.
[1:25:05.660 --> 1:25:07.660]  You can already see the headlines in your mind.
[1:25:07.660 --> 1:25:10.660]  But oh, it's a Democrat. It's a leftist.
[1:25:10.660 --> 1:25:12.660]  It's a liberal that murders a Trump supporter.
[1:25:12.660 --> 1:25:15.660]  That doesn't fit into the media lie and the media narrative.
[1:25:15.660 --> 1:25:18.660]  So they don't cover it.
[1:25:18.660 --> 1:25:22.660]  That's not the only violence from leftist over the weekend.
[1:25:22.660 --> 1:25:24.660]  Texas Pro-Life Organization headquarters
[1:25:24.660 --> 1:25:28.660]  evacuated over bomb threat and suspicious package.
[1:25:28.660 --> 1:25:30.660]  By the way, you know, Larry Elder gets assaulted
[1:25:30.660 --> 1:25:32.660]  every time he goes out by racist liberals now, too.
[1:25:32.660 --> 1:25:34.660]  That race is heating up.
[1:25:34.660 --> 1:25:36.660]  That's going to be interesting to watch.
[1:25:36.660 --> 1:25:42.660]  In fact, Rose McGowan had a press conference with Larry Elder today
[1:25:42.660 --> 1:25:45.660]  where...
[1:25:45.660 --> 1:25:50.660]  I forget the exact claim, but basically that...
[1:25:50.660 --> 1:25:53.660]  I think it was Newsom's wife was bribing...
[1:25:53.660 --> 1:25:55.660]  There was some bribe, basically.
[1:25:55.660 --> 1:25:57.660]  I forget the exact nature of the story.
[1:25:57.660 --> 1:25:59.660]  I'm not going to try to take a guess.
[1:25:59.660 --> 1:26:01.660]  The crew can probably find it. I'm sure it's all over the Internet today.
[1:26:01.660 --> 1:26:03.660]  Here's the headline.
[1:26:03.660 --> 1:26:05.660]  Rose McGowan, Gavin Newsom's wife, called me on behalf of Harvey Weinstein
[1:26:05.660 --> 1:26:07.660]  before scandal broke.
[1:26:07.660 --> 1:26:09.660]  So yeah, they were trying to stop Rose McGowan from speaking
[1:26:09.660 --> 1:26:11.660]  to protect Harvey Weinstein.
[1:26:11.660 --> 1:26:15.660]  That's Newsom and his wife.
[1:26:15.660 --> 1:26:18.660]  So Gavin Newsom and his wife tried to stop...
[1:26:18.660 --> 1:26:20.660]  tried to protect Harvey Weinstein.
[1:26:20.660 --> 1:26:23.660]  Oh, all the Me Too Democrats and Pro Woman Democrats,
[1:26:23.660 --> 1:26:26.660]  they're still standing up for Newsom and they love Newsom,
[1:26:26.660 --> 1:26:29.660]  even though he was on the side of Harvey Weinstein.
[1:26:29.660 --> 1:26:32.660]  And then Rose McGowan goes and does a press conference
[1:26:32.660 --> 1:26:34.660]  with Larry Elder today,
[1:26:34.660 --> 1:26:36.660]  basically calling out the complete frauds in the media,
[1:26:36.660 --> 1:26:38.660]  the complete frauds in the Democrat Party,
[1:26:38.660 --> 1:26:41.660]  and all the intellectual fraud of the liberal left.
[1:26:41.660 --> 1:26:44.660]  So that's going on.
[1:26:44.660 --> 1:26:48.660]  They loved Rose McGowan when she was at the...
[1:26:48.660 --> 1:26:52.660]  alpha of the Me Too Women's March.
[1:26:52.660 --> 1:26:54.660]  But then when she was, like, actually about it
[1:26:54.660 --> 1:26:56.660]  and not just in it for Democrat Party purposes,
[1:26:56.660 --> 1:26:58.660]  then they booted her out.
[1:26:58.660 --> 1:27:00.660]  Now they don't really care about her anymore.
[1:27:00.660 --> 1:27:05.660]  Bill Maher is not so happy where his liberal left is going.
[1:27:05.660 --> 1:27:07.660]  Bill Maher slams NFL's Black National Anthem
[1:27:07.660 --> 1:27:09.660]  in critical race theory.
[1:27:09.660 --> 1:27:11.660]  Segregation under a different name.
[1:27:11.660 --> 1:27:16.660]  Bill Maher says the race obsessed left is embarrassing him.
[1:27:16.660 --> 1:27:22.660]  Are they really playing the Black National Anthem at NFL games?
[1:27:22.660 --> 1:27:24.660]  Is that a real thing?
[1:27:24.660 --> 1:27:26.660]  I guess it is.
[1:27:26.660 --> 1:27:28.660]  What a joke.
[1:27:28.660 --> 1:27:32.660]  So protest the actual National Anthem,
[1:27:32.660 --> 1:27:36.660]  but what if somebody took a knee during the Black National Anthem?
[1:27:36.660 --> 1:27:39.660]  Can you imagine how that would go?
[1:27:39.660 --> 1:27:44.660]  I don't think that would be a very accepted thing
[1:27:44.660 --> 1:27:47.660]  for the media and by the left.
[1:27:47.660 --> 1:27:50.660]  Another transgender fighter wins a fight against a woman.
[1:27:50.660 --> 1:27:51.660]  Go figure.
[1:27:51.660 --> 1:27:54.660]  Transgender fighter Elena McLaughlin wins MMA debut.
[1:27:54.660 --> 1:27:56.660]  The debut.
[1:27:56.660 --> 1:27:59.660]  And folks, I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[1:27:59.660 --> 1:28:01.660]  It's a fully...
[1:28:01.660 --> 1:28:08.660]  It's a massive dude who used to be really into weightlifting,
[1:28:08.660 --> 1:28:14.660]  even enlisted in the army to become a man
[1:28:14.660 --> 1:28:18.660]  and was obviously a pretty bandly man.
[1:28:18.660 --> 1:28:21.660]  Like, frankly, big beard,
[1:28:21.660 --> 1:28:25.660]  liked outdoors and joined the army, big muscles and everything.
[1:28:25.660 --> 1:28:27.660]  Oh, but now he's a woman
[1:28:27.660 --> 1:28:30.660]  and he's going to be fighting against women and go figure.
[1:28:30.660 --> 1:28:31.660]  He's one and oh.
[1:28:31.660 --> 1:28:32.660]  Oh, excuse me, she's one and oh.
[1:28:32.660 --> 1:28:35.660]  And it says end transgenocide.
[1:28:35.660 --> 1:28:38.660]  Who's causing transgenocide?
[1:28:38.660 --> 1:28:40.660]  Who's causing transgenocide?
[1:28:40.660 --> 1:28:43.660]  Were there trans intolerant in the Middle East?
[1:28:43.660 --> 1:28:48.660]  Or the high suicide rate amongst transgender people?
[1:28:48.660 --> 1:28:49.660]  So there you go.
[1:28:49.660 --> 1:28:51.660]  Congratulations, man.
[1:28:51.660 --> 1:28:53.660]  You just beat a woman in a fight.
[1:28:53.660 --> 1:28:56.660]  That used to be called the domestic violence or abuse of a woman,
[1:28:56.660 --> 1:28:58.660]  but now it's called MMA.
[1:28:58.660 --> 1:29:02.660]  In late August, info or saw an explosion of orders
[1:29:02.660 --> 1:29:05.660]  because our audience understands that the globalist
[1:29:05.660 --> 1:29:08.660]  are destabilizing the planet by design
[1:29:08.660 --> 1:29:10.660]  and are attempting to cause an economic
[1:29:10.660 --> 1:29:13.660]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[1:29:13.660 --> 1:29:14.660]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:29:14.660 --> 1:29:17.660]  storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[1:29:17.660 --> 1:29:19.660]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have,
[1:29:19.660 --> 1:29:22.660]  taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[1:29:22.660 --> 1:29:24.660]  self-defense and a relationship with God.
[1:29:24.660 --> 1:29:26.660]  But now more than ever,
[1:29:26.660 --> 1:29:28.660]  you need to get your storable food orders in.

[1:29:36.660 --> 1:29:38.660]  you're going to see more food supply shortages
[1:29:38.660 --> 1:29:40.660]  and you're going to see food supply
[1:29:40.660 --> 1:29:42.660]  price increases that are already taking place.
[1:29:42.660 --> 1:29:45.660]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price

[1:29:50.660 --> 1:29:53.660]  is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[1:29:53.660 --> 1:29:56.660]  So get prepared now at infoorstore.com.
[1:29:56.660 --> 1:29:59.660]  What was the most important point
[1:29:59.660 --> 1:30:03.660]  in Joe Biden's declaration of war against America
[1:30:03.660 --> 1:30:06.660]  on Thursday, September 9, 2021?
[1:30:06.660 --> 1:30:09.660]  Was it the announcement of forced inoculations
[1:30:09.660 --> 1:30:11.660]  of 80 to 100 million Americans?
[1:30:11.660 --> 1:30:13.660]  Was it the announcement of federalization
[1:30:13.660 --> 1:30:15.660]  of all the major cities,
[1:30:15.660 --> 1:30:17.660]  the bypassing of state governors,
[1:30:17.660 --> 1:30:19.660]  the threat to basically remove them?
[1:30:19.660 --> 1:30:20.660]  No, it wasn't.
[1:30:20.660 --> 1:30:22.660]  That was all bad enough.
[1:30:22.660 --> 1:30:24.660]  It's the fact that he's following
[1:30:24.660 --> 1:30:27.660]  a UN globalist great reset blueprint
[1:30:27.660 --> 1:30:29.660]  that Australia, the UK, Europe,
[1:30:29.660 --> 1:30:31.660]  and the rest of the Western world is
[1:30:31.660 --> 1:30:33.660]  and that this is just the beginning.
[1:30:33.660 --> 1:30:35.660]  More lockdowns,
[1:30:35.660 --> 1:30:38.660]  national medical IDs approved by the United Nations,
[1:30:38.660 --> 1:30:41.660]  carbon taxes that don't just track a trace,
[1:30:41.660 --> 1:30:42.660]  it would tax you,
[1:30:42.660 --> 1:30:44.660]  but actually tell you when you could go somewhere
[1:30:44.660 --> 1:30:45.660]  and what you could do.
[1:30:45.660 --> 1:30:47.660]  It's all been announced at the UN level.
[1:30:47.660 --> 1:30:50.660]  This is a UN world government takeover,
[1:30:50.660 --> 1:30:54.660]  corporate revolution through global governance.
[1:30:54.660 --> 1:30:55.660]  It's illegal,
[1:30:55.660 --> 1:30:57.660]  and Congress must stand up and stop it now.
[1:30:57.660 --> 1:30:59.660]  Gerald in South Carolina,
[1:30:59.660 --> 1:31:00.660]  go ahead, you're on the air,
[1:31:00.660 --> 1:31:01.660]  trying to move quicker.
[1:31:01.660 --> 1:31:02.660]  Hey, Alex.
[1:31:02.660 --> 1:31:03.660]  Welcome.
[1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:04.660]  Would like to say first off,
[1:31:04.660 --> 1:31:05.660]  thanks for being the voice of reason
[1:31:05.660 --> 1:31:07.660]  and amongst all this stupidity.
[1:31:07.660 --> 1:31:08.660]  Wanted to warn people,
[1:31:08.660 --> 1:31:10.660]  I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[1:31:10.660 --> 1:31:12.660]  I'm a double amputee
[1:31:12.660 --> 1:31:15.660]  and I have bacteria infection on my lung
[1:31:15.660 --> 1:31:17.660]  that'll never go away.
[1:31:17.660 --> 1:31:19.660]  Living defense saved my life.
[1:31:19.660 --> 1:31:22.660]  They had me on antibiotics for two years
[1:31:22.660 --> 1:31:23.660]  that almost killed me.
[1:31:23.660 --> 1:31:25.660]  Living defense brought me back.
[1:31:25.660 --> 1:31:27.660]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible,
[1:31:27.660 --> 1:31:30.660]  Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[1:31:30.660 --> 1:31:33.660]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine.
[1:31:33.660 --> 1:31:36.660]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted
[1:31:36.660 --> 1:31:38.660]  and shall kill you
[1:31:38.660 --> 1:31:40.660]  and ye shall be hated of all nations
[1:31:40.660 --> 1:31:42.660]  for my name's sake.
[1:31:42.660 --> 1:31:44.660]  And then shall many be offended
[1:31:44.660 --> 1:31:46.660]  and shall betray one another
[1:31:46.660 --> 1:31:48.660]  and shall hate one another.
[1:31:48.660 --> 1:31:49.660]  I think where we're at, brother.
[1:31:49.660 --> 1:31:51.660]  And that's because God's name
[1:31:51.660 --> 1:31:52.660]  is on the founding of this country
[1:31:52.660 --> 1:31:53.660]  no matter what they say.
[1:31:53.660 --> 1:31:55.660]  And that's why the enemy hates it,
[1:31:55.660 --> 1:31:58.660]  because God created this country.
[1:31:58.660 --> 1:31:59.660]  Just a week ago,
[1:31:59.660 --> 1:32:02.660]  we got a new shipment of vitamin and mineral fusion
[1:32:02.660 --> 1:32:03.660]  back in stock.
[1:32:03.660 --> 1:32:06.660]  And it was only half of the order we wanted to get.
[1:32:06.660 --> 1:32:07.660]  But because we won't cut corners
[1:32:07.660 --> 1:32:09.660]  on the quality of what goes into it,
[1:32:09.660 --> 1:32:11.660]  the factory can only get limited supplies.
[1:32:11.660 --> 1:32:13.660]  So again, it was half the order we wanted.
[1:32:13.660 --> 1:32:14.660]  But despite that,
[1:32:14.660 --> 1:32:17.660]  I'm still offering it for 33% off.
[1:32:17.660 --> 1:32:19.660]  Everybody on the fence will get it.
[1:32:19.660 --> 1:32:20.660]  It's critical for your immune system
[1:32:20.660 --> 1:32:21.660]  and your whole body.
[1:32:21.660 --> 1:32:22.660]  All the essential vitamins,

[1:32:26.660 --> 1:32:28.660]  So while supplies last until it runs out,

[1:32:31.660 --> 1:32:33.660]  and it'll be months till more comes in.

[1:32:40.660 --> 1:32:41.660]  We're all in a catch-22.
[1:32:41.660 --> 1:32:43.660]  But we have another great product,
[1:32:43.660 --> 1:32:44.660]  hair and beard formula,
[1:32:44.660 --> 1:32:47.660]  that's really a great multivitamin mineral system
[1:32:47.660 --> 1:32:50.660]  that's one of the best multivitamin mineral systems out there.
[1:32:50.660 --> 1:32:52.660]  It's just called hair and beard.

[1:32:54.660 --> 1:32:55.660]  It's great for women,

[1:32:56.660 --> 1:33:19.660]  designed for men in infowarstore.com.
[1:33:19.660 --> 1:33:20.660]  All right, we're back here
[1:33:20.660 --> 1:33:22.660]  on the Alex Jones Show this Sunday evening.
[1:33:22.660 --> 1:33:24.660]  Alex Jones is coming up
[1:33:24.660 --> 1:33:27.660]  with a powerful interview with Dr. Richard Bartlett
[1:33:27.660 --> 1:33:30.660]  and also some special reports
[1:33:30.660 --> 1:33:33.660]  that's going to be coming up in the next two hours.

[1:33:49.660 --> 1:33:50.660]  for obvious reasons.
[1:33:50.660 --> 1:33:53.660]  I think people are looking at how disastrous this Biden regime is
[1:33:53.660 --> 1:33:56.660]  and are really looking at the future of America
[1:33:56.660 --> 1:33:58.660]  with uncertain eyes.
[1:33:58.660 --> 1:33:59.660]  So get insurance.

[1:34:11.660 --> 1:34:15.660]  That is the formula that we have here.
[1:34:15.660 --> 1:34:17.660]  All kinds of pushback
[1:34:17.660 --> 1:34:20.660]  against the Biden vaccine mandate.
[1:34:20.660 --> 1:34:22.660]  By the way, Biden over the weekend
[1:34:22.660 --> 1:34:24.660]  gets booed.
[1:34:24.660 --> 1:34:26.660]  He gets booed when he goes to New York
[1:34:26.660 --> 1:34:28.660]  to look at the flood damage.
[1:34:28.660 --> 1:34:34.660]  He gets booed when he goes to the ceremony for 9-11.
[1:34:34.660 --> 1:34:36.660]  The ceremony is he gets booed and heckled there.
[1:34:36.660 --> 1:34:38.660]  Trump gets nothing but cheered.
[1:34:38.660 --> 1:34:40.660]  College football stadiums ring loud
[1:34:40.660 --> 1:34:42.660]  with the F Biden chance.
[1:34:42.660 --> 1:34:43.660]  Trump gets cheered.
[1:34:43.660 --> 1:34:44.660]  We love Trump.
[1:34:44.660 --> 1:34:45.660]  He shows up at a boxing match.
[1:34:45.660 --> 1:34:46.660]  He does commentary.
[1:34:46.660 --> 1:34:47.660]  He's the bell of the ball.
[1:34:47.660 --> 1:34:49.660]  He shows up in New York City.
[1:34:49.660 --> 1:34:51.660]  He's hanging out with police and firemen
[1:34:51.660 --> 1:34:53.660]  and they can't stop shaking his hand
[1:34:53.660 --> 1:34:54.660]  and smiling and hugging him
[1:34:54.660 --> 1:34:56.660]  and taking pictures and everything.
[1:34:56.660 --> 1:34:58.660]  But boy, yeah, Biden, you know,
[1:34:58.660 --> 1:35:00.660]  he's the guy that got the 81 million votes
[1:35:00.660 --> 1:35:01.660]  more than ever.
[1:35:01.660 --> 1:35:02.660]  He's the popular one, right?
[1:35:02.660 --> 1:35:03.660]  He's the guy.
[1:35:03.660 --> 1:35:05.660]  He's the one, I'm sure.
[1:35:05.660 --> 1:35:09.660]  But we're asking you in the audience
[1:35:09.660 --> 1:35:11.660]  how you have been affected
[1:35:11.660 --> 1:35:13.660]  and we're going into the first work week,
[1:35:13.660 --> 1:35:17.660]  I suppose, as the vaccine mandates are rolled out.
[1:35:17.660 --> 1:35:20.660]  And so I know this is affecting a lot of people.
[1:35:20.660 --> 1:35:23.660]  Oh, yeah, there's Biden literally sprinting to a child.
[1:35:23.660 --> 1:35:26.660]  You know, this was something I was going to get into tomorrow.
[1:35:26.660 --> 1:35:29.660]  He's shuffling and droning about yesterday
[1:35:29.660 --> 1:35:33.660]  at the 9-11 ceremonies as he's being booed.
[1:35:33.660 --> 1:35:36.660]  He sees a kid and he literally sprints faster
[1:35:36.660 --> 1:35:38.660]  than you've seen him move.
[1:35:38.660 --> 1:35:41.660]  It's like, you know, a pet whenever you're about to feed it.
[1:35:41.660 --> 1:35:46.660]  And it's just like a beeline right to you to eat food.
[1:35:46.660 --> 1:35:48.660]  So here's all the former presidents
[1:35:48.660 --> 1:35:50.660]  exiting the ceremonies.
[1:35:50.660 --> 1:35:53.660]  Biden shuffling along as he normally does.
[1:35:53.660 --> 1:35:55.660]  A lot of people think that he walks like somebody
[1:35:55.660 --> 1:35:57.660]  that has Parkinson's, but doctors have said.
[1:35:57.660 --> 1:35:59.660]  And they're all walking in a line
[1:35:59.660 --> 1:36:01.660]  and then Biden breaks the line
[1:36:01.660 --> 1:36:03.660]  and sprints right over to this kid
[1:36:03.660 --> 1:36:05.660]  and takes his mask off to rub this kid
[1:36:05.660 --> 1:36:09.660]  and blow a kiss to the kid.
[1:36:09.660 --> 1:36:14.660]  Again, it's like an animal running to food.
[1:36:14.660 --> 1:36:16.660]  But I'm asking you in the audience
[1:36:16.660 --> 1:36:20.660]  if you're being affected by this vaccine mandate
[1:36:20.660 --> 1:36:22.660]  and where it's going to go from here.
[1:36:22.660 --> 1:36:24.660]  And so we've got some callers on the line
[1:36:24.660 --> 1:36:26.660]  that are going to be commenting on this.
[1:36:26.660 --> 1:36:28.660]  We go to them now.
[1:36:28.660 --> 1:36:30.660]  Don has called in from Michigan.
[1:36:30.660 --> 1:36:32.660]  Don, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[1:36:32.660 --> 1:36:34.660]  Go ahead.
[1:36:34.660 --> 1:36:36.660]  Hey, Owen. God bless you, man.
[1:36:36.660 --> 1:36:38.660]  And all the info warriors out there at my work.
[1:36:38.660 --> 1:36:42.660]  It's just a matter of time before they implement
[1:36:42.660 --> 1:36:45.660]  the injection mandates.
[1:36:45.660 --> 1:36:50.660]  We're a federal contractor that supplies food
[1:36:50.660 --> 1:36:54.660]  and whatnot to the military.
[1:36:54.660 --> 1:36:59.660]  And this statement by President Penny Wise
[1:36:59.660 --> 1:37:04.660]  and the clown show administration last Thursday,
[1:37:04.660 --> 1:37:08.660]  whenever it was, just really kind of freaked me out.
[1:37:08.660 --> 1:37:12.660]  It reminded me of the right crystal,
[1:37:12.660 --> 1:37:16.660]  not speech by Joseph Goebbels
[1:37:16.660 --> 1:37:21.660]  prior to the giant purge in Germany.
[1:37:21.660 --> 1:37:24.660]  I've been trying to think of what I'm going to do
[1:37:24.660 --> 1:37:27.660]  when I am forced out of my job
[1:37:27.660 --> 1:37:29.660]  and can't pay rent anymore.
[1:37:29.660 --> 1:37:31.660]  If I'm going to flee to a free state
[1:37:31.660 --> 1:37:34.660]  or stand and fight here in Michigan
[1:37:34.660 --> 1:37:38.660]  and I'm a single dad
[1:37:38.660 --> 1:37:42.660]  with pretty isolated social life,
[1:37:42.660 --> 1:37:45.660]  I don't have a big network of people to rely on.
[1:37:45.660 --> 1:37:48.660]  My parents are both elderly
[1:37:48.660 --> 1:37:51.660]  and have now taken the injection
[1:37:51.660 --> 1:37:56.660]  or their health is diminishing exponentially.
[1:37:56.660 --> 1:37:59.660]  They wouldn't listen to me.
[1:37:59.660 --> 1:38:02.660]  So I've decided that I'm just going to stand
[1:38:02.660 --> 1:38:06.660]  and fight and stand together with anybody
[1:38:06.660 --> 1:38:11.660]  that resists this tyrannical decree
[1:38:11.660 --> 1:38:14.660]  by our globalist overlords.
[1:38:14.660 --> 1:38:17.660]  And I ask everyone
[1:38:17.660 --> 1:38:23.660]  that's considering fleeing to a cold and cold free state.
[1:38:23.660 --> 1:38:26.660]  You know, I thought about this a lot.
[1:38:26.660 --> 1:38:29.660]  I have a bad feeling that this is just a way for them
[1:38:29.660 --> 1:38:33.660]  to funnel all of the resistance into one area
[1:38:33.660 --> 1:38:37.660]  and several areas and eventually in the long term
[1:38:37.660 --> 1:38:44.660]  snuff us out all the easier people should probably
[1:38:44.660 --> 1:38:46.660]  stand and fight where they're at
[1:38:46.660 --> 1:38:49.660]  and resist this at all costs.
[1:38:49.660 --> 1:38:51.660]  I'm willing to go all the way.
[1:38:51.660 --> 1:38:54.660]  I know a lot of people are feeling the same way as me.
[1:38:54.660 --> 1:39:00.660]  I just want to give them kudos and my prayers.
[1:39:00.660 --> 1:39:02.660]  Well, there's a lot of Americans
[1:39:02.660 --> 1:39:05.660]  basically facing the same decisions that you're facing here
[1:39:05.660 --> 1:39:10.660]  and you'll meet like-minded people that you will band together with.
[1:39:10.660 --> 1:39:13.660]  I mean, the one option I think that I'm seeing a lot of people take
[1:39:13.660 --> 1:39:15.660]  and I think it's the smart option.
[1:39:15.660 --> 1:39:17.660]  You know, everybody's going to have to make their own decisions,
[1:39:17.660 --> 1:39:18.660]  but I wouldn't quit.
[1:39:18.660 --> 1:39:21.660]  I'd make them fire you and then look at legal action.
[1:39:21.660 --> 1:39:22.660]  It's amazing.
[1:39:22.660 --> 1:39:25.660]  It's crazy to think that we're now here in the year 2021
[1:39:25.660 --> 1:39:29.660]  and we have maps that are going around of free states and slave states.
[1:39:29.660 --> 1:39:31.660]  And it's like, I don't want to be funneled into a civil war
[1:39:31.660 --> 1:39:33.660]  that will ultimately destroy America.
[1:39:33.660 --> 1:39:35.660]  I don't want to be a part of that, but I mean,
[1:39:35.660 --> 1:39:38.660]  I have to report the news and keep the audience,
[1:39:38.660 --> 1:39:41.660]  this is the most informed audience in the world out there.
[1:39:41.660 --> 1:39:45.660]  So, I mean, it's crazy to think we're now in 2021
[1:39:45.660 --> 1:39:50.660]  and we've gone back in time
[1:39:50.660 --> 1:39:54.660]  and we're now looking at maps of free states and slave states
[1:39:54.660 --> 1:39:58.660]  and you have the president coming out and telling America
[1:39:58.660 --> 1:40:01.660]  like he runs your life, that he's getting impatient with you
[1:40:01.660 --> 1:40:05.660]  because he won't do what he tells you to.
[1:40:05.660 --> 1:40:08.660]  A lot of Americans never thought they'd see this day
[1:40:08.660 --> 1:40:10.660]  and it's quite a wake-up call.
[1:40:10.660 --> 1:40:12.660]  Don, God bless, thank you so much for the call.
[1:40:12.660 --> 1:40:15.660]  Let's go to...
[1:40:15.660 --> 1:40:17.660]  Let's go to...
[1:40:17.660 --> 1:40:18.660]  Let's see here.
[1:40:18.660 --> 1:40:20.660]  Let's go to Harold in Arizona.
[1:40:20.660 --> 1:40:22.660]  Harold, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[1:40:22.660 --> 1:40:23.660]  Go ahead.
[1:40:23.660 --> 1:40:24.660]  Hey, Don Owen.
[1:40:24.660 --> 1:40:25.660]  You're great.
[1:40:25.660 --> 1:40:27.660]  I love everything you guys are doing to fight all this good stuff
[1:40:27.660 --> 1:40:29.660]  or this nonsense I should say.
[1:40:29.660 --> 1:40:35.660]  I'm calm because my mom's been working for United Airlines since 1969.
[1:40:35.660 --> 1:40:39.660]  She flew through the whole entire beginning of the pandemic.
[1:40:39.660 --> 1:40:42.660]  This whole entire time she's been flying with no problem
[1:40:42.660 --> 1:40:47.660]  and now they're going to make her go on unpaid leave starting October 2
[1:40:47.660 --> 1:40:49.660]  if she doesn't get the vaccine.
[1:40:49.660 --> 1:40:53.660]  Also, my brother works for the Los Angeles School District
[1:40:53.660 --> 1:40:57.660]  and I don't know if he's going to go on unpaid leave
[1:40:57.660 --> 1:40:59.660]  or if he just ended up getting fired,
[1:40:59.660 --> 1:41:03.660]  but if he doesn't get vaxed by, I think it's October 15,
[1:41:03.660 --> 1:41:05.660]  he will no longer have a job.
[1:41:05.660 --> 1:41:10.660]  I also sell a lot of farmer markets out here in Arizona and California
[1:41:10.660 --> 1:41:14.660]  and some of these markets now are starting to require their vendors
[1:41:14.660 --> 1:41:18.660]  to be vaccinated in order to sell out their markets.
[1:41:18.660 --> 1:41:19.660]  So it's coming quick.
[1:41:19.660 --> 1:41:20.660]  It's coming fast.
[1:41:20.660 --> 1:41:21.660]  It's coming rapid.
[1:41:21.660 --> 1:41:27.660]  It's very discouraging to see how quickly this has been implemented,
[1:41:27.660 --> 1:41:30.660]  but I do appreciate everything you guys are doing
[1:41:30.660 --> 1:41:32.660]  to help bring awareness to this
[1:41:32.660 --> 1:41:34.660]  and hopefully we can fight this back
[1:41:34.660 --> 1:41:37.660]  because it's getting brutal higher.
[1:41:37.660 --> 1:41:40.660]  Well, all the people out there that were politically apathetic
[1:41:40.660 --> 1:41:45.660]  or just kind of maybe looked into the ceremonious or fun like,
[1:41:45.660 --> 1:41:46.660]  oh, I put a sticker on.
[1:41:46.660 --> 1:41:48.660]  I voted like, haha, I'm part of the process.
[1:41:48.660 --> 1:41:51.660]  Yay, I'm somebody, I'm something.
[1:41:51.660 --> 1:41:53.660]  And now they're finally realizing that, no, no, no, no,
[1:41:53.660 --> 1:41:56.660]  politics does care about you.
[1:41:56.660 --> 1:41:57.660]  Politics is in your life.
[1:41:57.660 --> 1:41:58.660]  This president is in your life.
[1:41:58.660 --> 1:42:03.660]  And they're realizing now, wow, you know, that person I vote for,
[1:42:03.660 --> 1:42:06.660]  the policies and everything actually impact me.
[1:42:06.660 --> 1:42:07.660]  Whoa.
[1:42:07.660 --> 1:42:08.660]  I never thought about that.
[1:42:08.660 --> 1:42:12.660]  And so they're realizing that, wow, policies and putting to practice
[1:42:12.660 --> 1:42:16.660]  that Democrats have been putting into practice in inner cities for years
[1:42:16.660 --> 1:42:17.660]  and now the medical tyranny.
[1:42:17.660 --> 1:42:19.660]  Wow, this is actually destroying my life.
[1:42:19.660 --> 1:42:21.660]  This is actually destroying my freedom.
[1:42:21.660 --> 1:42:25.660]  Just like it's destroyed all the major inner cities where it takes hold.
[1:42:25.660 --> 1:42:27.660]  So they're having that wake-up call.
[1:42:27.660 --> 1:42:30.660]  It's not a fun process.
[1:42:30.660 --> 1:42:32.660]  It's not a fun process.
[1:42:32.660 --> 1:42:35.660]  At first, the truth is going to piss you off,
[1:42:35.660 --> 1:42:37.660]  but then it sits you free.
[1:42:37.660 --> 1:42:40.660]  At first, the truth is going to anger you
[1:42:40.660 --> 1:42:42.660]  and then it's going to set you free.
[1:42:42.660 --> 1:42:44.660]  But Biden seems to be getting thrown under the bus
[1:42:44.660 --> 1:42:46.660]  by the Democrats and the media now, too.
[1:42:46.660 --> 1:42:52.660]  So there's going to be some major crossroads
[1:42:52.660 --> 1:42:54.660]  and major events here before the midterm elections
[1:42:54.660 --> 1:43:23.660]  that are going to change our fate.
[1:43:54.660 --> 1:43:56.660]  We'll see you on Monday night. So get yours now.
[1:44:24.660 --> 1:44:26.660]  We'll see you on Monday night.
[1:44:55.660 --> 1:45:00.660]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep
[1:45:00.660 --> 1:45:02.660]  is the cornerstone of good health.
[1:45:02.660 --> 1:45:04.660]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule
[1:45:04.660 --> 1:45:06.660]  is linked with numerous health problems
[1:45:06.660 --> 1:45:09.660]  including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes,
[1:45:09.660 --> 1:45:12.660]  poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[1:45:12.660 --> 1:45:14.660]  Introducing RocketRest,
[1:45:14.660 --> 1:45:17.660]  the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line
[1:45:17.660 --> 1:45:19.660]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:45:19.660 --> 1:45:22.660]  The new RocketRest formula is loaded with the best natural ingredients
[1:45:22.660 --> 1:45:25.660]  to help not only improve your quality of sleep,
[1:45:25.660 --> 1:45:27.660]  but help you wake up feeling refreshed.
[1:45:27.660 --> 1:45:31.660]  Many competitor sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep,
[1:45:31.660 --> 1:45:35.660]  but RocketRest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested
[1:45:35.660 --> 1:45:37.660]  and ready to take on the next day.
[1:45:37.660 --> 1:45:40.660]  It uses a unique quick release capsule system
[1:45:40.660 --> 1:45:43.660]  to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients
[1:45:43.660 --> 1:45:45.660]  like melatonin and magnesium.
[1:45:45.660 --> 1:45:48.660]  RocketRest helps you fall asleep fast, stay asleep,
[1:45:48.660 --> 1:45:50.660]  and wake up feeling rested.
[1:45:50.660 --> 1:45:53.660]  So get the new RocketRest formula from Dr. Jones Naturals
[1:45:53.660 --> 1:45:56.660]  right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:45:56.660 --> 1:45:59.660]  I've been fighting as hard as I can
[1:45:59.660 --> 1:46:02.660]  for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[1:46:02.660 --> 1:46:04.660]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[1:46:04.660 --> 1:46:08.660]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[1:46:08.660 --> 1:46:10.660]  before they went operational.
[1:46:10.660 --> 1:46:11.660]  But we failed.
[1:46:11.660 --> 1:46:13.660]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[1:46:13.660 --> 1:46:15.660]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed,
[1:46:15.660 --> 1:46:18.660]  but they are going ahead with their full operational
[1:46:18.660 --> 1:46:20.660]  deindustrialization great reset.
[1:46:20.660 --> 1:46:22.660]  And that's why it's more important than ever
[1:46:22.660 --> 1:46:26.660]  that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show
[1:46:26.660 --> 1:46:29.660]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[1:46:29.660 --> 1:46:31.660]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[1:46:31.660 --> 1:46:32.660]  and try to stop their agenda,
[1:46:32.660 --> 1:46:35.660]  but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[1:46:35.660 --> 1:46:37.660]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality,
[1:46:37.660 --> 1:46:38.660]  storeable food.
[1:46:38.660 --> 1:46:41.660]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very important prices
[1:46:41.660 --> 1:46:42.660]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:42.660 --> 1:46:45.660]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply
[1:46:45.660 --> 1:46:48.660]  or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[1:46:48.660 --> 1:46:51.660]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up
[1:46:51.660 --> 1:46:53.660]  and before there are long lines and waits.
[1:46:53.660 --> 1:46:55.660]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[1:46:55.660 --> 1:47:21.660]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[1:47:21.660 --> 1:47:23.660]  One more segment left here of the Alex Jones show
[1:47:23.660 --> 1:47:27.660]  and then Alex Jones takes over Sunday night live
[1:47:27.660 --> 1:47:30.660]  a powerful interview with Dr. Richard Bartlett
[1:47:30.660 --> 1:47:31.660]  and then there's going to be some also,
[1:47:31.660 --> 1:47:34.660]  he's going to be having some other breaking news reports as well.
[1:47:34.660 --> 1:47:36.660]  That's coming up in the meantime.
[1:47:36.660 --> 1:47:38.660]  You got callers on the line here.
[1:47:38.660 --> 1:47:41.660]  I'm asking the audience how this vaccine mandate has impacted them.
[1:47:41.660 --> 1:47:43.660]  You just heard from some stories in the last segment.
[1:47:43.660 --> 1:47:45.660]  We've got a couple others on the line right now.
[1:47:45.660 --> 1:47:50.660]  Let's go to David who's called in from Florida
[1:47:50.660 --> 1:47:53.660]  on the vaccine mandate. David, go ahead.
[1:47:53.660 --> 1:47:55.660]  Hey, how's it going, brother?
[1:47:55.660 --> 1:47:56.660]  Good, thanks for calling.
[1:47:56.660 --> 1:47:59.660]  I really appreciate you guys and everything you do.
[1:47:59.660 --> 1:48:01.660]  I won't take up too much of your time.
[1:48:01.660 --> 1:48:02.660]  I spoke to you before.
[1:48:02.660 --> 1:48:05.660]  I'm also the guy that got censored at the Trump rally.
[1:48:05.660 --> 1:48:07.660]  But I just want to call in and tell you guys,
[1:48:07.660 --> 1:48:10.660]  one of my very best friends without being too specific
[1:48:10.660 --> 1:48:13.660]  because we all know everyone lists as infowars, right?
[1:48:13.660 --> 1:48:16.660]  He works for NASA and his dream job
[1:48:16.660 --> 1:48:20.660]  and it took him quite a while to get in there.
[1:48:20.660 --> 1:48:24.660]  He's in a very technical, high position.
[1:48:24.660 --> 1:48:28.660]  About two weeks ago, I put him on infowars.
[1:48:28.660 --> 1:48:33.660]  He started listening to the show and he's watching it with a fervor.
[1:48:33.660 --> 1:48:37.660]  Just studying every single thing that he can get his eyes on and ears on
[1:48:37.660 --> 1:48:40.660]  and he's extremely smart.
[1:48:40.660 --> 1:48:44.660]  He knows when you say something whether it's BS or not.
[1:48:44.660 --> 1:48:47.660]  And he got, right after Biden made the announcement,
[1:48:47.660 --> 1:48:50.660]  I believe it was on the 9th about the mandates,
[1:48:50.660 --> 1:48:53.660]  he got an email from management that said,
[1:48:53.660 --> 1:48:54.660]  hey, you know what?
[1:48:54.660 --> 1:48:58.660]  You're going to have to get the vaccines, get the shots.
[1:48:58.660 --> 1:49:03.660]  And if you don't, then we're going to get rid of you pretty much.
[1:49:03.660 --> 1:49:07.660]  So now he's scrambling trying to figure out what he can do
[1:49:07.660 --> 1:49:09.660]  to get out of doing that.
[1:49:09.660 --> 1:49:12.660]  And if he has to, he'll leave his job.
[1:49:12.660 --> 1:49:16.660]  So I'm just concerned about what's going to happen to our infrastructure.
[1:49:16.660 --> 1:49:22.660]  You know, with all these people getting these franken shots to utilize Alex's term.
[1:49:22.660 --> 1:49:25.660]  I just wonder what's going to happen to our infrastructure
[1:49:25.660 --> 1:49:29.660]  and all of our high technical positions with all of these people getting this stuff.
[1:49:29.660 --> 1:49:32.660]  I mean, are they trying to do the same thing to us there that they're doing with the military?
[1:49:32.660 --> 1:49:35.660]  Are they trying to weaken us so they can just hand us over to Kami China?
[1:49:35.660 --> 1:49:38.660]  I mean, what do you think?
[1:49:38.660 --> 1:49:44.660]  Well, it's both. And if you view it as in a war on us, as in the front on us,
[1:49:44.660 --> 1:49:48.660]  which it is, and if you want to say it's China or the globalist or the world elite,
[1:49:48.660 --> 1:49:51.660]  it really doesn't matter because the impact is the same.
[1:49:51.660 --> 1:49:53.660]  They're shutting down the economy.
[1:49:53.660 --> 1:49:56.660]  They're shutting down our supply chain.
[1:49:56.660 --> 1:49:57.660]  Food prices are going up.
[1:49:57.660 --> 1:50:00.660]  Energy prices are going up.
[1:50:00.660 --> 1:50:02.660]  Taxes are going up.
[1:50:02.660 --> 1:50:04.660]  So this is going to cripple the middle class.
[1:50:04.660 --> 1:50:08.660]  It's going to cripple our economy and it's going to weaken America.
[1:50:08.660 --> 1:50:11.660]  So whether it's China doing it, incompetent politicians doing it,
[1:50:11.660 --> 1:50:15.660]  world elite doing it with an agenda, it's all going to have the same impact
[1:50:15.660 --> 1:50:17.660]  and it's all going to hurt America.
[1:50:17.660 --> 1:50:21.660]  But yeah, these people that are getting the vaccines, they're going to get sick.
[1:50:21.660 --> 1:50:24.660]  And then you're going to have people that are refusing the vaccine.
[1:50:24.660 --> 1:50:26.660]  They're going to get fired from jobs.
[1:50:26.660 --> 1:50:28.660]  So it's just again, it's going to hurt the economy.
[1:50:28.660 --> 1:50:29.660]  It's going to hurt the middle class.
[1:50:29.660 --> 1:50:30.660]  It's going to hurt the supply lines.
[1:50:30.660 --> 1:50:33.660]  And it's just amazing how dumb people are.
[1:50:33.660 --> 1:50:36.660]  They can't see that this is all coming.
[1:50:36.660 --> 1:50:40.660]  I mean, I understand if people didn't want to see or admit that this was coming a year and a half ago
[1:50:40.660 --> 1:50:41.660]  when Info Wars was warring.
[1:50:41.660 --> 1:50:42.660]  Warning about it.
[1:50:42.660 --> 1:50:47.660]  But now it's, I mean, you're standing on the train tracks
[1:50:47.660 --> 1:50:51.660]  and you're not feeling vibrations and the rocks maybe rumbling a little bit
[1:50:51.660 --> 1:50:53.660]  and you're thinking, oh, is a train coming?
[1:50:53.660 --> 1:50:57.660]  Or there's a distant light out straight ahead of you
[1:50:57.660 --> 1:50:58.660]  that you can kind of see.
[1:50:58.660 --> 1:50:59.660]  Maybe it's encroaching.
[1:50:59.660 --> 1:51:00.660]  Oh, is that a train encroaching?
[1:51:00.660 --> 1:51:05.660]  I mean, we can now see the train, hear the horn, the tracks are vibrating
[1:51:05.660 --> 1:51:06.660]  and you can see it.
[1:51:06.660 --> 1:51:07.660]  It is coming.
[1:51:07.660 --> 1:51:08.660]  It is going to hit you.
[1:51:08.660 --> 1:51:11.660]  So we got to get off the tracks or we're in big trouble.
[1:51:11.660 --> 1:51:12.660]  David, thank you for the call.
[1:51:12.660 --> 1:51:16.660]  Let's go to Christine in New Jersey.
[1:51:16.660 --> 1:51:18.660]  I want to talk about the vaccine mandate.
[1:51:18.660 --> 1:51:19.660]  Christine, go ahead.
[1:51:19.660 --> 1:51:21.660]  Hey, how are you?
[1:51:21.660 --> 1:51:22.660]  Hi, good.
[1:51:22.660 --> 1:51:23.660]  Thanks for calling me.
[1:51:23.660 --> 1:51:24.660]  Can you hear me?
[1:51:24.660 --> 1:51:25.660]  Can you hear me?
[1:51:25.660 --> 1:51:26.660]  Okay.
[1:51:26.660 --> 1:51:27.660]  All right.
[1:51:27.660 --> 1:51:28.660]  So I thought of a loophole.
[1:51:28.660 --> 1:51:32.660]  I thought of a loophole for the recent mandate of 100 employers.
[1:51:32.660 --> 1:51:34.660]  It's a temporary loophole for now.
[1:51:34.660 --> 1:51:38.660]  So if any business owners are listening or you can tell a friend,
[1:51:38.660 --> 1:51:39.660]  you know, the business.
[1:51:39.660 --> 1:51:42.660]  So if you say, for example, you have 150 employees,
[1:51:42.660 --> 1:51:46.660]  what I think a business owner should do is just open up a new business,
[1:51:46.660 --> 1:51:49.660]  a separate entity, like a tax ID number, a whole new business,
[1:51:49.660 --> 1:51:53.660]  a manager, separate those, separate them to 75 each.
[1:51:53.660 --> 1:51:55.660]  Now you have 75 each.
[1:51:55.660 --> 1:51:57.660]  It's not a big deal because I'm a business owner.
[1:51:57.660 --> 1:52:00.660]  It's not a big deal for you to open up a business.
[1:52:00.660 --> 1:52:01.660]  It's another business.
[1:52:01.660 --> 1:52:02.660]  Yeah, it's that.
[1:52:02.660 --> 1:52:04.660]  And then there's another option I've seen of people just, you know,
[1:52:04.660 --> 1:52:07.660]  hiring people out as contractors is another option.
[1:52:07.660 --> 1:52:08.660]  Certainly people are going to do that.
[1:52:08.660 --> 1:52:10.660]  But they'll, they'll, I think you're right though.
[1:52:10.660 --> 1:52:14.660]  I think it's a temporary thing because they'll find a way to shut that down too.
[1:52:14.660 --> 1:52:15.660]  Wow.
[1:52:15.660 --> 1:52:19.660]  And then I wanted to encourage people besides that loophole for now.
[1:52:19.660 --> 1:52:21.660]  This is all going to be taken care of.
[1:52:21.660 --> 1:52:25.660]  Anyway, people have to keep this in mind that this is not going to be able to go through.
[1:52:25.660 --> 1:52:28.660]  We just have to wait for the court process is to happen.
[1:52:28.660 --> 1:52:31.660]  But like another thing I want to encourage people and I can't imagine being in
[1:52:31.660 --> 1:52:35.660]  that position where like you're literally going to be fired from your job if you
[1:52:35.660 --> 1:52:38.660]  don't take this still shot, but I want to encourage them.
[1:52:38.660 --> 1:52:39.660]  Don't do it.
[1:52:39.660 --> 1:52:40.660]  Just don't do it.
[1:52:40.660 --> 1:52:42.660]  Wait, wait till they fire you.
[1:52:42.660 --> 1:52:43.660]  Try to go on an appointment.
[1:52:43.660 --> 1:52:44.660]  Find another job.
[1:52:44.660 --> 1:52:47.660]  Even if it's like money temporarily, you'll find something else.
[1:52:47.660 --> 1:52:50.660]  I just want to tell people when one door closes, another one opens.
[1:52:50.660 --> 1:52:51.660]  Yeah.
[1:52:51.660 --> 1:52:52.660]  We can't get into these.
[1:52:52.660 --> 1:52:54.660]  We can't get into this.
[1:52:54.660 --> 1:52:56.660]  People need to band together.
[1:52:56.660 --> 1:53:01.660]  If you're in a company and there's 20 people that don't want to take this or 20 need to
[1:53:01.660 --> 1:53:05.660]  get together, band together and come up with a social action and fight.
[1:53:05.660 --> 1:53:09.660]  Don't give in to this disgusting shot that's killing thousands of people.
[1:53:09.660 --> 1:53:12.660]  We don't know unknown future repercussions.
[1:53:12.660 --> 1:53:13.660]  I think they're going to connect.
[1:53:13.660 --> 1:53:15.660]  It's a 5g to tell you the truth.
[1:53:15.660 --> 1:53:17.660]  They're going to connect you to 5g.
[1:53:17.660 --> 1:53:21.660]  It's something way more sinister going on with why they want everyone.
[1:53:21.660 --> 1:53:24.660]  Absolutely.
[1:53:24.660 --> 1:53:28.660]  If they can get this experimental vaccine mandated and get us to go along with it,
[1:53:28.660 --> 1:53:30.660]  imagine what they'll do next and then beyond, folks.
[1:53:30.660 --> 1:53:35.660]  That's why it's so key to stand this ground now and draw the line in the sand now as well.
[1:53:35.660 --> 1:53:37.660]  Christine, thank you so much for the call.
[1:53:37.660 --> 1:53:42.660]  By the way, I mean, I know people that are going through decisions like this.
[1:53:42.660 --> 1:53:45.660]  It's really sad because people are going to have to make a decision.
[1:53:45.660 --> 1:53:48.660]  Some people are going to make the decision to get that jab.
[1:53:48.660 --> 1:53:53.660]  Others are going to make the decision not to and then have to go through whatever comes after that.
[1:53:53.660 --> 1:54:00.660]  But you know what's sick about it is for the friends or family that I have or that we have,
[1:54:00.660 --> 1:54:03.660]  that are about to go through this and maybe they're lined up to get the vaccine
[1:54:03.660 --> 1:54:05.660]  or maybe they're about to quit their job.
[1:54:05.660 --> 1:54:08.660]  We hug them and we pray for them and we say, hey, you know what?
[1:54:08.660 --> 1:54:09.660]  We hope it works out.
[1:54:09.660 --> 1:54:11.660]  Hey, with your job, I hope it works out.
[1:54:11.660 --> 1:54:12.660]  I love you.
[1:54:12.660 --> 1:54:13.660]  Hey, with the vaccine, I hope it's okay.
[1:54:13.660 --> 1:54:14.660]  I hope it doesn't hurt you.
[1:54:14.660 --> 1:54:15.660]  I hope it's okay.
[1:54:15.660 --> 1:54:16.660]  I love you.
[1:54:16.660 --> 1:54:17.660]  I'm praying for you.
[1:54:17.660 --> 1:54:18.660]  What is it like on the other side?
[1:54:18.660 --> 1:54:20.660]  Oh, you don't want to get the vaccine.
[1:54:20.660 --> 1:54:21.660]  Just die.
[1:54:21.660 --> 1:54:22.660]  Just die.
[1:54:22.660 --> 1:54:23.660]  Ah, you don't want the vaccine.
[1:54:23.660 --> 1:54:24.660]  I hope you die.
[1:54:24.660 --> 1:54:25.660]  We're going to kill you.
[1:54:25.660 --> 1:54:26.660]  Do what we say.
[1:54:26.660 --> 1:54:27.660]  Yeah.
[1:54:27.660 --> 1:54:31.660]  That's the juxtaposition right now.
[1:54:31.660 --> 1:54:34.660]  Hey, I don't think you should take the vaccine.
[1:54:34.660 --> 1:54:35.660]  Hey, well, I have to for my work.
[1:54:35.660 --> 1:54:36.660]  Okay.
[1:54:36.660 --> 1:54:37.660]  Well, I love you.
[1:54:37.660 --> 1:54:38.660]  I'm going to pray for you.
[1:54:38.660 --> 1:54:39.660]  I hope it works out.
[1:54:39.660 --> 1:54:40.660]  I think you're going to be okay.
[1:54:40.660 --> 1:54:41.660]  It's going to be fine.
[1:54:41.660 --> 1:54:46.660]  Oh, the vaccine, the medical tyranny lovers.
[1:54:46.660 --> 1:54:47.660]  Stay here.
[1:54:47.660 --> 1:54:49.660]  You don't, I hope you die from COVID.
[1:54:49.660 --> 1:54:50.660]  Yeah.
[1:54:50.660 --> 1:54:51.660]  Yeah.
[1:54:51.660 --> 1:54:52.660]  We're not going to give you any medical treatment either.
[1:54:52.660 --> 1:54:53.660]  Yeah.
[1:54:53.660 --> 1:54:55.660]  We're going to take your money and we're going to get you fired.
[1:54:55.660 --> 1:54:56.660]  Yeah.
[1:54:56.660 --> 1:54:57.660]  How do you like that?
[1:54:57.660 --> 1:54:58.660]  Yeah.
[1:54:58.660 --> 1:54:59.660]  Just total evil.
[1:54:59.660 --> 1:55:00.660]  All right.
[1:55:00.660 --> 1:55:03.660]  Let's go to David in Michigan.
[1:55:03.660 --> 1:55:04.660]  David in Michigan.
[1:55:04.660 --> 1:55:05.660]  You're on the Alex Jones.
[1:55:05.660 --> 1:55:06.660]  So go ahead.
[1:55:06.660 --> 1:55:12.660]  Hey, Owen, I'm supposed to tell you for my wife, she loves you and you're a heck of a
[1:55:12.660 --> 1:55:13.660]  patriot.
[1:55:13.660 --> 1:55:14.660]  Keep up the fight.
[1:55:14.660 --> 1:55:15.660]  Thank you.
[1:55:15.660 --> 1:55:16.660]  She's very kind.
[1:55:16.660 --> 1:55:22.660]  Hey, in terms of the COVID mandate, so my daughter's been asked by her supervisor,
[1:55:22.660 --> 1:55:28.660]  you know, if, if she would take the vaccine, she told them point blank.
[1:55:28.660 --> 1:55:29.660]  She's had COVID.
[1:55:29.660 --> 1:55:35.660]  She had it a few months ago and that she'll quit and her boss just said, okay.
[1:55:35.660 --> 1:55:39.660]  And so my daughter's actually filing tomorrow.
[1:55:39.660 --> 1:55:42.660]  She's filing because she's an accountant.
[1:55:42.660 --> 1:55:46.660]  She's filing to get an LLC so she can start her own practice.
[1:55:46.660 --> 1:55:47.660]  So she gets fired.
[1:55:47.660 --> 1:55:51.660]  She has an outlet to do something different.
[1:55:51.660 --> 1:55:58.660]  Now, in regards to the actual vaccine, so my wife just spent five days with her mom who
[1:55:58.660 --> 1:56:05.660]  was vaccinated months ago, who's now has COVID and her boyfriend is even sticker.
[1:56:05.660 --> 1:56:10.660]  He got vaccinated as well at the same time with her with the Pfizer vaccine and he's
[1:56:10.660 --> 1:56:16.660]  now in the hospital as of today with COVID or just something else with COVID.
[1:56:16.660 --> 1:56:17.660]  No, they confirmed today.
[1:56:17.660 --> 1:56:20.660]  The hospital confirmed he has COVID.
[1:56:20.660 --> 1:56:21.660]  Yeah.
[1:56:21.660 --> 1:56:25.660]  Now that being said, we know they had my wife try telling them, you got COVID.
[1:56:25.660 --> 1:56:27.660]  He wouldn't buy it because he's vaccinated.
[1:56:27.660 --> 1:56:28.660]  He's 80 years old.
[1:56:28.660 --> 1:56:30.660]  He wouldn't believe that he had COVID.
[1:56:30.660 --> 1:56:32.660]  But my wife's like, well, you had all this.
[1:56:32.660 --> 1:56:33.660]  We had COVID in August.
[1:56:33.660 --> 1:56:35.660]  My wife, my son and I.
[1:56:35.660 --> 1:56:37.660]  So we lost our taste in smell.
[1:56:37.660 --> 1:56:45.660]  We were like a big hangover for about five days, three days of allergy-like symptoms.
[1:56:45.660 --> 1:56:48.660]  And she tried telling them, you guys have COVID.
[1:56:48.660 --> 1:56:49.660]  No way.
[1:56:49.660 --> 1:56:50.660]  We don't have COVID.
[1:56:50.660 --> 1:56:51.660]  I got the vaccine.
[1:56:51.660 --> 1:56:54.660]  Well, he confirmed today when he was admitted to the hospital.
[1:56:54.660 --> 1:56:57.660]  They confirmed with him that he's got COVID.
[1:56:57.660 --> 1:57:00.660]  And, you know, the funny thing is most people don't even know that they've had it.
[1:57:00.660 --> 1:57:04.660]  And so they get the vaccine and then they have a negative response or get even sicker from
[1:57:04.660 --> 1:57:06.660]  COVID because that's what the vaccine does now.
[1:57:06.660 --> 1:57:09.660]  Now, I know three people that have died from the vaccine.
[1:57:09.660 --> 1:57:10.660]  That have gotten the vaccine.
[1:57:10.660 --> 1:57:11.660]  It's unbelievable.
[1:57:11.660 --> 1:57:12.660]  David, I'm out of time here.
[1:57:12.660 --> 1:57:14.660]  Thank you so much for the call.

[1:58:49.660 --> 1:58:55.660]  The puppet leaders of nations across the planet are declaring their allegiance to the New
[1:58:55.660 --> 1:58:56.660]  World Order.
[1:58:56.660 --> 1:59:00.660]  And Democrat politicians have been announcing it here as well.
[1:59:00.660 --> 1:59:06.660]  That means allegiance to a tyrannical world corporate government established by the Rockefellers
[1:59:06.660 --> 1:59:07.660]  through the UN.
[1:59:07.660 --> 1:59:12.660]  And they want inside your body to put in you what they want, when they want, and to have

[1:59:18.660 --> 1:59:20.660]  new world ID.

[1:59:29.660 --> 1:59:30.660]  This is criminal.
[1:59:30.660 --> 1:59:34.660]  And he's lying saying it's an approved vaccine when they did not approve it.
[1:59:34.660 --> 1:59:36.660]  They said that's a 20 to 25 maybe.
[1:59:36.660 --> 1:59:38.660]  They just expanded the emergency authorization.
[1:59:38.660 --> 1:59:41.660]  That's why the two top scientists quit a week and a half ago.
