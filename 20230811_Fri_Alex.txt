[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.200]  In early 2023, Bloomberg reported that U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.760]  Commissioner Richard Trumka Jr. described indoor air pollutants from gas stoves as
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.600]  a hidden hazard, saying that any option is on the table. Products that can't be
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.280]  made safe can be banned, he said. As a former cook, I can tell you that the
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.600]  wait times on your cuisine from restaurants handicapped from using
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.240]  electric stoves will be enormous. Of course, I can guarantee that the
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.880]  political elite will not be affected. When you start making a thousand buses a
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.120]  year, what are you gonna, you're gonna need more room for your customers, aren't
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.080]  you? Yes, sir. The manufacturer Proterra has just filed for bankruptcy. They've
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.120]  got a strong tie to the Biden administration, right? President Biden
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.640]  seems to have been a fan of the company that's now filing for bankruptcy. So as
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.360]  Joe Biden's energy department is on the verge of murdering the culinary industry
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.160]  by eliminating gas stoves, a genuine murder mystery surrounding the drowning
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.080]  death of former White House chef and Barack Obama employee Tafari Campbell
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.280]  unravels. On several uncomfortable questions have sprung up around Campbell's
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.200]  death. Was it an accident or did something sinister happen? Social media
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.840]  is filled with theories, including the claim that Campbell was secretly
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.400]  writing a tell-all book on the Obamas. Campbell was six feet tall and drowned
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.400]  in eight feet of water. Campbell was also a competent swimmer. Campbell's death
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.320]  parallels with Clinton body count member Walter Sheeb, an executive chef
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.280]  at the White House for 11 years under Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. All
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.320]  right, so what did President Clinton like? You know, we really don't get too much
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.200]  into that because what happens is, especially in a time with all of the
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.400]  internet, is that I might say, oh yeah, President XYZ likes this. Yeah. The
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.880]  poor guy, wherever he goes for the rest of his life, that's all he's gonna get.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.480]  So, you know, they both enjoyed good barbecue. Both presidents enjoyed
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.160]  southwestern flavors, big flavors, a little bit spicy. So they enjoyed all
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.680]  sorts of things. It really wasn't one thing that they liked or didn't like.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.000]  Walter Sheeb was found dead after a five-day search and rescue operation. The
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.840]  61-year-old went missing more than a week ago while hiking in the mountains
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.720]  alone near the Tuskegee Valley. Everybody has their own. John F. K. was a playboy
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.960]  with Marilyn Monroe. Trump, Karen McDougal, Stormy Daniels. You know, George
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.880]  Bush linked to 9-11 and weapons of mass destruction. Bill Clinton linked to
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.640]  Arkansas, women, all this, others. Everybody has a reputation. How is it
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.920]  that the reputation that follows them as people close to them die? Asking a
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.840]  bizarre question. Exactly. Did people die? Did people die? No. What pisses me off, and I'm
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.960]  gonna say this again, because you apparently are not listening to me. You
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.200]  had a list of people off an obscure website that, that, that, that, of a
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.040]  conspiracy theory, taking a Venn diagram of everyone that ever worked in the
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.520]  orbit of someone who served in public life for 50 years. You are implying that
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.240]  something nefarious is afoot both with the question and with the list.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.000]  Hillary Clinton, she's a big girl. I'm a big boy, you're a big boy. The people that
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.240]  you just listed, they're all, listen to me, no, these are obscure people that you
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.720]  could not pull out. You're a great politician, buddy. The details surrounding the Obama family's
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.320]  involvement in Campbell's drowning death have been inconsistent. Initial reports
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.560]  detail that police left a call log detailing Obama's private chef's
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.040]  drowning blank. The call was made two miles from Obama's residence
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.240]  contradicting the initial report. Control to Agatown Fire and Water Rescue
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.040]  personnel, Echo 90 and Echo Unit. Respond to 7979 Turkey Land Cove for a 40 year old
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.480]  male, possible drowning. Control to Agatown Fire and Water Rescue personnel, Echo 90 and
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.360]  Echo Unit. Respond to number 7979 Turkey Land Cove Road for a 40 year old male,
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.400]  possible drowning. Units acknowledged. While the call log of the 911 distress call
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.000]  received on the night of the accident conspicuously omits the reason for the
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.800]  call. The Daily Mail reports a female staff member of Barack Obama had been
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.240]  with Campbell when he tragically drowned while paddleboarding in a pond beside
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.520]  the former president's estate in Martha's Vineyard. And now the story has
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.400]  changed as to the whereabouts of the Obamas, placing them on the property at
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.120]  the time of the drowning, contradictory to what had been previously reported. Why
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.760]  all the changes for an accidental drowning? And as Michelle becomes a
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.880]  prospective presidential candidate, did Obama's personal chef know too much?
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.040]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.150]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.

[00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.150]  your entire physiological system, for your nervous system particularly.

[00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.150]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.

[00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.150]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.

[00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.150]  When castles towered over vast landscapes and knights championed honor and valor,
[00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.150]  there came an unforeseen darkness.
[00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.150]  Amidst this impending doom stood a knight called Alex Jones,
[00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.150]  a brave and outspoken herald known as the Truth Sayer.
[00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.150]  Sir Alex Jones was not alone.
[00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:45.150]  In his most desperate hour in the battle against evil, a radiant light descended from the heavens.
[00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.150]  God in all his glory and his legion of angels stood by Alex's side.
[00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:54.150]  The battle raged on, but with every blow Alex Jones' conviction grew stronger.
[00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.150]  With every truth he proclaimed, the demonic forces faltered.
[00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:06.150]  When the enemy was vanquished, Alex Jones swore a solemn oath that should the realm need him again, he would return.
[00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:13.150]  And now it's Alex Jones leading a full frontal assault on the satanic New World Order.
[00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:18.150]  Tune in at InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:37.150]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWars and say I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:44.150]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.150]  It's Friday, August 11th, 2023.
[00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:02.150]  I'm your host Alex Jones and we've got an incredibly important transmission lined up for you today.
[00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.150]  All right.
[00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:19.150]  We have horrifying numbers concerning the increased death rate the American people and life expectancy plunging the fastest it's ever done in our history.
[00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.150]  And of course, there's a different group of reasons that's happening.
[00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:29.150]  They're trying to blame it on fentanyl or even COVID, but it's the COVID shots the main one.
[00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:36.150]  Elon Musk has triggered a big firestorm with a CEO saying they're going to censor and censor big time.
[00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:43.150]  The ADL under pressure from Elon Musk issues tepid condemnation of anti kill the white people, kill the Boris song.
[00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.150]  We've got that coming up.
[00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.150]  Incredible video.
[00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.150]  Watch voters demolish.
[00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.150]  CNN psyop interview.
[00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:57.150]  Say Trump won, slam indictments, bash U.S. support for Ukraine.
[00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:05.150]  We've also got new study raises alarm over leprosy cases reported after COVID.
[00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:09.150]  Vaccinations as U.S. suicides hit all time high.
[00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:18.150]  Jack Smith, the U.N. prosecutor, requests January 2nd trial date once Trump convicted by Super Tuesday.
[00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.150]  Trump responds.
[00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:26.150]  Developing Obama judge in D.C. persecuting Trump for January 6th.
[00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.150]  Signal she will gag Trump in middle of presidential election.
[00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.150]  Incredible election meddling.
[00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:39.150]  The Capitol police head goes public after they first censored his first interview with Tucker.
[00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.150]  The day it was supposed to air, they fired Tucker and Fox said they owned it and shelved it.
[00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.150]  He's interviewed him in an hour-long powerful interview that's posted right now.
[00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.150]  Infowars.com.
[00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.150]  In full.
[00:09:50.150 --> 00:10:00.150]  And he has gone public saying it was Nancy Pelosi that basically ran the stand down and what happened on January 6th.
[00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:05.150]  It was Pelosi, former Capitol police chief, reveals set up behind January 6th.
[00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.150]  Incredible.
[00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:14.150]  And we've got so much other news and the great Mike Lindell joining us in the third hour.
[00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.150]  In the first and second hour, I'm going to go to your calls early.
[00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:26.150]  Now, there's a paradox here, and it's important to describe how I came to this conclusion,
[00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:33.150]  because I found that if you just give people a piece of incredible news and just put it out there,
[00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:39.150]  it gets lost like a fart in the wind, to use the common vernacular.
[00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:48.150]  But this happens to me a lot where I get a splinter in my brain and I have a thought in my mind
[00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:55.150]  and I get very frustrated that I cannot remember a piece of information that is the key
[00:10:55.150 --> 00:11:02.150]  or beyond critical to understanding the enemy takeover.
[00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:10.150]  And so what I'm going to do is, at the start of the next segment, I'm going to cover this.
[00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:14.150]  Now, if I really wanted to have a big effect, I'd hype this for two weeks
[00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:20.150]  and I'd have a special Saturday show or something commercial free and five million people would tune in
[00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:25.150]  and it would break out and General Flynn would talk about it and Tucker Carlson would talk about it.
[00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:30.150]  And maybe I should just do that, because smart news people know how to sit on something,
[00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.150]  hype it up and release it so it has a bigger effect.
[00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.150]  It's like if you throw a beach ball on top of a pool, it just floats around and blows around.
[00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.150]  But if you hold it down in the deep end, it explodes out.
[00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:44.150]  But it takes energy to push the beach ball to the bottom of the pool and then let it go.
[00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.150]  My daughter loves that.
[00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.150]  My six-year-old daughter, I'll take a beach ball, take it to the bottom of the pool.
[00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:53.150]  Our pool is five feet deep, but to the bottom and then she watches it shoot out.
[00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.150]  I'm not even sure I could take it down 10 feet.
[00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:07.150]  But I started talking a few weeks ago about vaccines and meat allergies
[00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.150]  because I saw them in the news saying it was because of ticks, when it's not.
[00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:16.150]  It's happening in countries that don't have the tick and it's exploding and the tick's been around forever.
[00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:25.150]  And then so I went back over their discussions about how the vaccines on the FDA's own website
[00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:33.150]  can trigger you to get this alpha-gal syndrome that's a big deal for so many reasons.
[00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.150]  Not just you individually getting sick when you eat meat,
[00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:41.150]  but what it then does, the economy wants beef production craters because no one can eat it.
[00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:47.150]  Just like this happened with wheat or gluten, which again we know what did it.
[00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:50.150]  It's not an intolerance, it's the roundup on the damn wheat.
[00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:58.150]  But I was walking through the studio yesterday at like 5.30 and Owen was on
[00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:05.150]  and I was getting a glass of water in the break room and I looked up and saw Owen covering this
[00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:09.150]  and it was like I was slapped upside the head.
[00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:19.150]  Because I knew this, we wrote about this two years ago, it's in other documents
[00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:26.150]  and here I am warning you that they're engineering vaccines to make you allergic to meat
[00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:35.150]  and I'd forgotten the WEF admitted it and that they're admittedly doing it.
[00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:39.150]  Bioengineering humans, which I've been saying the last few weeks they're bioengineering us,
[00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.150]  but I'm like why do I know they're doing that?
[00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:45.150]  I can see the programming, the preparation, the explosions of the meat allergies.
[00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:52.150]  And then, son of a bitch, it's not just him, I found a bunch of professors
[00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:57.150]  saying we're going to give you meat allergies through shots, through vaccines.
[00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.150]  God, these people never stop.
[00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:06.150]  Now most talk show hosts cover one article at a time on its face, that's it, compartmentalized.
[00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:11.150]  Where we're different is we bring you in the back story of what's currently happening in a projection.
[00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:15.150]  But that was what was giving me a headache for two weeks.
[00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.150]  I was like there's something else, I'm missing something.
[00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:23.150]  So I've spent, no exaggeration, probably 15 hours the last two weeks researching this
[00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:26.150]  and didn't come back across our own research.
[00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:30.150]  And it hit me like a ton of bricks.
[00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:38.150]  WEF linked bioethicist calls for genetically modifying humans to induce meat intolerance.
[00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.150]  What do you think all these GMO shots, what all this mRNA is?
[00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:47.150]  It is mutagenic, meaning it is mutating you.
[00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:51.150]  And what they always do is oh we might have an ESG, we might have a programmable currency in the future.
[00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.150]  They're already rolling that out.
[00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.150]  Same thing, oh we might want to program you where you can't eat meat.
[00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.150]  Already doing it.
[00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:03.150]  This is such a societal assault, it'll make our brains smaller, it'll make us sick.
[00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:09.150]  Two billion plus people rely on cows, major IMF, World Bank studies, to live.
[00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:17.150]  From India to the United States, from the Netherlands to the UK, from South Africa to Kenya,
[00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:23.150]  from Brazil to Argentina, from Canada to Mexico.
[00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:28.150]  This is so devastating.
[00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:33.150]  And there they are bragging and they're just doing it to us.
[00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.150]  Who wouldn't be pissed about this?
[00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.150]  Who wouldn't want these mad scientists raping us with this?
[00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.150]  Because it's bad enough if somebody hits you over the head and rapes you.
[00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:46.150]  It hurts, later you've been violated, maybe you get a disease.
[00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:52.150]  But this is the whole system raping us and cutting our children's genitals off and we just love it.
[00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.150]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.150]  We're going to cover it when we come back.

[00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:05.150]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength.
[00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.150]  And they can only be obtained through diet.
[00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:13.150]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:19.150]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of Omega-3s.
[00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:24.150]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:11.150]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:15.150]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:19.150]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:24.150]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.150]  Look it up.
[00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:27.150]  Don't let them do this to your family.

[00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.150]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees.
[00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.150]  Instead of making 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.150]  But these really are amazing products.
[00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.150]  The big July 4 sale is going on right now.
[00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:35.150]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.150]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.150]  People are listening more than ever.
[00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:42.150]  But in this major recession, going into depression, and with supply chain breakdowns,
[00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:43.150]  I know it's hard.
[00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.150]  I know times are tough.
[00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.150]  So thank you for your support.
[00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:49.150]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.150]  That you can do for free.
[00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.150]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.150]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.150]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:59.150]  God bless you.
[00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:08.110]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:15.260]  I'm sick and tired of giving in my own way
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:20.260]  I'm sick and tired of everything I see but I know
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:24.260]  Nobody rides for free
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.260]  Nobody rides for free
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.260]  Don't stop me pleading cause I know what I stand
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.260]  I'm out my window, you're not gonna change my plan
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.260]  If you can break away and see what I say
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.260]  You'll understand what's burning inside of me
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:50.260]  I'm sick and tired of talking my little dance
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:55.260]  I'm sick and tired of everyone in my way
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:59.260]  Nobody rides for free
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:03.260]  Nobody rides for free
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.260]  Nobody rides for free
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.260]  Nobody rides for free
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.260]  Nobody rides for free
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.260]  Nobody rides for free
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:35.540]  Ask God to enter your soul and energize you in this animating contest of liberty.
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.780]  So
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.620]  I talked about this last segment and I want you to listen very carefully to me
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:49.139]  I don't like to hype things but people are designed to hype
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.980]  So you grow up they don't do it anymore, but you'd see at night
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:22:00.100]  Big search lights and you either know it was a car dealership with a sale or it was a movie theater
[00:22:01.139 --> 00:22:04.740]  And I was little I'd say dad I want to go see what that is and she go
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.740]  okay, we'll drive and see where it is and it was a
[00:22:07.139 --> 00:22:09.139]  car dealership or a
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.540]  acrobat fair or a movie
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.260]  And I remember pulling up one time at the town east mall and
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.500]  They were had spotlights out because the thing had just come out
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.780]  And I was like eight years old great
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.980]  movie put out by
[00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:38.550]  that amazing director John Carpenter with Kurt Russell my dad said oh it's a
[00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:41.850]  pretty scary movie son I don't think we should see it and I said please let me
[00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:47.970]  see it please let me see it he said all right we went and got a hot dog and
[00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:51.850]  popcorn and a slurpee and movie scared the living hell out of me I had
[00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:57.610]  nightmares about it for a year now one of my favorite movies and I later watched
[00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:03.570]  the 1950s ones with James Arness he wasn't just in a gun smoke he played the
[00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:08.850]  thing in that movie the first version of it where this alien crashes in the in
[00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:13.370]  the in the Antarctic and then it it's able to take over other creatures and
[00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:18.770]  mimic them and it's scary that something comes into your body and it takes you
[00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:24.490]  over and mutates you and turns you into something different but their entire
[00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:29.090]  globalist agenda is really doing that they're not just attacking your mind
[00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:33.170]  they're not attacking you psychologically they're not just poisoning you with 5g
[00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:41.490]  and GMO and nanotech and no no they're colonizing your body and you don't have
[00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:47.010]  tentacles shooting out of you and you know and pus flying across the room you
[00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:52.970]  don't explode into some demon creature in 30 seconds
[00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:59.030]  and all other life forms that's collected across the universe, it just
[00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:03.510]  slowly takes over your body and kills you.
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:09.540]  And it's social engineers you so this information I always go off my gut I
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:15.420]  intellectually study the knowledge but then something in my brain goes
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:23.780]  it's like the toaster is done cooking the bread it's like and you go oh this
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:28.540]  is the big thing we should cover so I'm bringing in all these thousands of
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.860]  articles a week and hundreds and hundreds of video clips and I'm
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:34.060]  analyzing constantly
[00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:39.450]  And not just myself, but the crew says, look, they're blaming this tick, and they're saying
[00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:44.990]  meat allergies exploded, just like they said, wheat allergy exploded, gluten allergy, and
[00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:48.990]  it was right when they started putting it on the wheat.
[00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:52.470]  Not to stop weeds from growing, but to kill fungus on the wheat, so you're getting wheat
[00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:58.510]  soaked in a deadly poison.
[00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:03.590]  Now if you think that's bad, that ain't nothing compared to this.
[00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.790]  So I've done this accidentally before where I do a bunch of research and I'm not ready
[00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.990]  and I talk about something for a week, and then I do a special show and it gets five
[00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:15.670]  million views, breaks out, has a huge effect, changes the world.
[00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:20.950]  And I'm not good at that, I do it by accident.
[00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:24.790]  And the reason I'm doing this now is no one cares if I just came on the show and told
[00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:30.190]  you this, maybe 5% of you just want the straight facts and you're dialed in, you get what's
[00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:31.190]  going on.
[00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:32.510]  The rest of you are kind of like me.
[00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:36.710]  If something isn't hyped up with dun-da-da-dun, dun-da-da-dun, dun-da-da-dun with dancing
[00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:39.750]  girls and everything, you're just like, well, this must not be that important.
[00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:45.110]  It's just mixed in with the Maui fires and the pitos everywhere and the open borders
[00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.550]  and all the rest of it.
[00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:53.110]  But this is big, because it's not just what they're doing to give us the deadly meat allergy
[00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:57.310]  where you eat a piece of steak and it's like a bumblebee bit you and you swell up and you
[00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:01.070]  can't breathe and people die in many cases.
[00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.070]  They're going to do this with everything.
[00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:06.430]  You don't think they authorized glyphosate on the wheat by accident.
[00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.710]  No, they knew damn well what they were doing.
[00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:14.270]  And on a scale of one to 10 of evil, that's about a three.
[00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.310]  A meat allergy is about an eight.
[00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.990]  What it'll do to the economy.
[00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:26.150]  Now they're talking about reducing rice production worldwide because it's grown in water in swamp
[00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:30.310]  and swamp creates bacteria passing gas.
[00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:32.230]  Bacteria go to the bathroom too.
[00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.270]  Their digestive system's the same.
[00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.870]  They've got a little, little, little, little chamber that dissolves it and then they push
[00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.870]  their poop out with methane.
[00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:45.230]  Bacteria fart just like cows and just like us and just like every other thing on this
[00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:49.510]  planet except I guess jellyfish don't pass gas.
[00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:50.510]  Farts do it.
[00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:51.510]  Whales do it.
[00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.350]  If the Easter Bunny was real, it does it.
[00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:54.350]  It's not.
[00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.830]  If Santa Claus was real, he farts.
[00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.230]  And I'm not trying to make a joke about this.
[00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:03.670]  They've now, pull it up, listed methane, there's swamps everywhere.
[00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:04.670]  Methane creates the atmosphere.
[00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:05.710]  It holds in the heat.
[00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:13.030]  It's good that they want to ban rice all over the world or restrict it because it's grown
[00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:19.870]  in water and because evil bacteria are living in the swamp water.
[00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:28.670]  And passing gas think that's a big deal half the world
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.240]  It's the majority of their nutrition from rice
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.380]  You even reduce it it costs mass famine unrest and death
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.160]  Now I pulled this up a few weeks ago
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.840]  I didn't tell the crew to get it, but just just type it. I think it was like Reuters
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.440]  It was also an IMF report a UN report as well
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.200]  To point let me give you the exact headline
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.080]  2.1 billion people
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.160]  survive
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:13.000]  on cattle production so 30% of the world's population survives on cattle
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.600]  production and survives eating meat or in the case of India getting milk and
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:25.520]  making products out of that they don't eat them over there at least the Hindus
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:34.280]  don't my family has a ranch in East Texas we've had under a Mexican land
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.960]  grant we still have a little bit of the land we don't make any money it just
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.840]  pays the taxes but we got a couple hundred cows they take that away from us
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.680]  we can't have the property but we won't starve to death at the third world will
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:52.560]  when I come back folks they admit that they're engineering you to not eat meat
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:57.760]  and poisoning us all right now this is so huge day with us
[00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:59.990]  I

[00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:07.030]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones
[00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:15.430]  So they admit to adding
[00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:20.550]  Protein to your shots to make you not be able to eat meat. Are you gonna put up with that folks?
[00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.550]  We're under total attack. It's all on record
[00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:29.230]  Info Wars the most banned network in the world
[00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:32.950]  You
[00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:45.630]  We interrupt this broadcast with a special report from the front lines of the info war
[00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:57.750]  Attempts have been made to neutralize the info warrior known as Alex Jones
[00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:02.470]  Countless attacks have been witnessed and reported in an effort to bring him down
[00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:10.430]  Alex Jones has been sighted on the battlefield fighting against the forces of evil
[00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:26.430]  We're receiving reports that Alex Jones has broken through the front lines and is now heading toward the broadcast studio
[00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:31.510]  All efforts to silence him have failed emerging victorious against the New World Order
[00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:37.670]  Here's your host Alex Jones find the info Wars transmission at info wars comm forward slash show
[00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:41.230]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
[00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:46.270]  You know, that's a fun little AI thing that
[00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:52.670]  Guys are put out for us and you know people like the Avengers they like the idea of battling aliens
[00:34:53.390 --> 00:35:00.110]  And it's all very romantic but the globalists believe they're creating alien species on earth and genetically engineering us
[00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:02.910]  Those of us that survived to be a new species
[00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:05.590]  So we can look at fanciful
[00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:12.750]  Fairy-tales and fiction and have some fun with it. But at the end of the day, we're living in a real science fiction dystopia
[00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:15.110]  that's getting worse by the day and
[00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:19.430]  Only becoming aware of it
[00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:21.950]  gives us a very good chance of
[00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:24.630]  Stopping it. So
[00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:28.550]  Again before I cover this I'm building it up because it's so important
[00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:32.350]  If I hypothetically and I wouldn't do this
[00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:36.150]  Drove across town to your house and
[00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:40.830]  Knocked on your door and when you open the door hit you in the face with a baseball bat
[00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:46.890]  Tied you up tied your wife up and raped your wife in front of me in front of you
[00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:52.810]  You would have a right to put me in prison you'd have a right if you get out of the the the
[00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.450]  Rope to kill me
[00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:04.730]  But when the globalists sit there and and openly brag about attacking our bodies through shots and GMO and the food the word
[00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.770]  We just sit here and take it
[00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:11.090]  There's another video. It's up on in full wars calm meant to give us a crew
[00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:13.090]  It's senator Paul came out on TV yesterday
[00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:18.170]  And he said we've never in the history of Congress that he's looked at and I agree with him
[00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:20.810]  He consulted the Senate historian archivist
[00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:24.250]  never
[00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:29.730]  Seen someone lie to Congress this cut-and-dry and say we've never done gain of function
[00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:32.730]  There is no gain of function not here not at Wuhan nowhere
[00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:38.650]  When he sent email saying we're doing gain-of-function research that he said we've got to cover up the gain of research
[00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:40.870]  He had conferences called
[00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:44.090]  in support of gain-of-function
[00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:48.450]  It'd be like if
[00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:51.570]  You said the Dallas Cowboys don't wear
[00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:58.650]  Baby blue powder silver uniforms and their symbol isn't a blue star inside a blue star. You'd say no
[00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:01.330]  The Dallas Cowboys wear that uniform
[00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:08.330]  But the bigger issue is why won't the FBI and the Justice Department do a damn thing because they're captured and they work for these
[00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:12.330]  People they control the internet. They're censoring. They control the Justice Department
[00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:17.690]  And they made a run at us with a bioweapon and a poison shot and have killed out
[00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:20.850]  Millions of people around the world and have maimed even more
[00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:29.330]  And then when they find it prestigious universities SV 40 cancer virus in
[00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:36.250]  Google and Bing go and cover it up and block it and force-feed fact-checkers saying it's not true
[00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:39.610]  When it's true on record aiding and abetting killing people
[00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:57.069]  So, did you hear me last segment? Type in world rice production must be cut for the
[00:37:57.069 --> 00:38:03.310]  environment. Rice bad for the environment. More than half the world gets more than half
[00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:13.790]  their nutrition from rice. It's like if you have a fish tank and you turn the oxygen off.
[00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:18.069]  You turn the little bubbler off and the fish are dead in two days. You turn that off or
[00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:21.910]  you go out of town, the power goes off, the pump doesn't turn back on and your favorite
[00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:30.490]  fish are all floating dead. And you guys are putting up the India ban on export because
[00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:39.350]  they've had lack of production. That's not the story. The story is rice is bad for the
[00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:45.910]  earth. WEF calls for cuts in rice production because it causes greenhouse gases. And there's
[00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:52.069]  all the headlines about ban farming, farming bad for the earth, the Netherlands, India,
[00:38:52.069 --> 00:39:00.870]  everywhere. It's literally everywhere saying we want to shut down farms. I've got CNN headlines.
[00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:05.669]  There it is, World Economic Forum. This is how rice is hurting the planet. And they're
[00:39:05.669 --> 00:39:10.790]  going in and paying people with fiat money they got not to produce, using money to kill
[00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:16.069]  productivity and starve people to death. They poison the wheat. They're cutting off the
[00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:20.990]  rice. 20 plus percent reduction in nitrogen production. That'll kill hundreds of millions,
[00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:29.069]  they admit. It's already been done. They went and pulled the plug on the oxygenator and
[00:39:29.069 --> 00:39:34.470]  the fish are swimming around and will be dead in 24 hours. They're cutting off the pipelines.
[00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:38.509]  They're cutting off the fuel. They're telling you, you'll eat bugs. You'll love it. You're
[00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:41.669]  not going to eat meat anymore. You'll laugh at them and say, I'm not going to stop. And
[00:39:41.669 --> 00:39:45.230]  they go, the hell you're not. We're going to give you a shot that doesn't just give
[00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:51.830]  you myocarditis and heart attacks and strokes and blood clots, but to where you have violent
[00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:58.109]  meat allergies. And then I'm researching this and talking about it. I'm going, why am I obsessed
[00:39:58.109 --> 00:40:02.430]  with this? I see him in the news pre-programming the Nobel meat soon because of this tick. Countries
[00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:04.990]  that don't have the tick are saying that they have the same thing. They don't even
[00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:10.950]  have a reason why they're saying COVID creates a meat allergy, all this BS. And then I remember,
[00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:16.189]  wait a minute. The W E F came out two years ago and said, we need to engineer people.
[00:40:16.189 --> 00:40:23.790]  And he wrote papers on it through injections to give you a meat allergy. So you can't eat
[00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:31.950]  me. How much more of a confession do you need? It's happening. It's going on. It'll hurt
[00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:36.470]  you. It'll hurt your quality of life. It'll wreck the global economy. It'll start billions
[00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:42.149]  to death. They're already setting up their factories, these big warehouses all over the
[00:40:42.149 --> 00:40:48.149]  world to produce bugs. And already at grocery stores, all over the Western world, from Japan
[00:40:48.149 --> 00:40:54.509]  to Germany, to England, to Canada, to the United States, it says bug protein, but they give
[00:40:54.509 --> 00:41:01.589]  it a code cricket protein. You don't have toxic chitinous and the hard shell of a bug.
[00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:07.549]  The reason you don't want to eat them is because your brain knows they're toxic. This
[00:41:07.549 --> 00:41:13.069]  is unbelievable. They're like, you will eat bugs because that's the protein they're going
[00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:17.390]  to allow you to have. And you're like, well, I won't eat the bugs. They're like, then you
[00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:25.310]  won't eat anything because we're injecting you where you cannot even eat it. And I showed
[00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:29.430]  you the documents, the articles will go back through them, but then it hits me. Oh, there's
[00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:38.430]  an info wars.com article about this from 2021 and overhead shot police, huge report,
[00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:45.589]  big study, human engineering and climate change. That should say raping humans and mutating
[00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:54.109]  them to our will. Because it is, listen, if I hypothetically pulled up in front of your
[00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:58.589]  house, you don't know me. I got a little baseball bat in my back pocket. I knock on the door
[00:41:58.589 --> 00:42:03.549]  and say, hey, I'm here with the census. I got a question. You open the door and I say,
[00:42:03.549 --> 00:42:08.750]  hey, how you doing? Bam, right in your nose and break your nose, kick you down, take handcuffs
[00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:13.669]  and tie you up. Your wife runs over to stop me, elbow her in the face, kick her in the
[00:42:13.669 --> 00:42:21.350]  groin, slam her down and tire down and rape her. If she gets pregnant, I just bioengineered
[00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:30.589]  your wife. If I give her a disease, I just bioengineered your wife. That's rape. That's
[00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:43.029]  rape. Rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape. Did you hear me? Rape, R-A-P-E,
[00:42:43.029 --> 00:42:52.589]  exclamation point, double hockey sticks. But these creeps and these cowards do it covertly
[00:42:52.589 --> 00:42:57.350]  and they get away with it and they think it's funny. And the average person who sees this
[00:42:57.350 --> 00:43:02.710]  influence says that can't be true. It's too horrible under Stockholm syndrome. And they
[00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:09.910]  waddle on off to their oblivion. So play a clip of the guy on TV. And when I saw this
[00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:13.710]  last night, I did more searches and found a bunch more of them. Extinction Rebellion,
[00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:20.589]  the UN. Oh, we gave people, the UN says, in the 90s in Africa and Asia, a tetanus shot
[00:43:20.589 --> 00:43:27.910]  with a female hormone that's secreted in the second trimester to cause spontaneous miscarriages.
[00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:33.149]  And it happens for the rest of your reproductive life. So when they get up there and they introduce
[00:43:33.149 --> 00:43:37.069]  things like soon you'll have ESG, soon you'll have digital currencies, they're already doing
[00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:43.350]  it. Soon you'll have social credit scores, how fun it is. And they're just telling you
[00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:47.870]  what they've done, like Fauci did four years ago, right before COVID. He goes on C-SPAN
[00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:52.549]  five years ago and says, we're going to blow up the old system of authorization of drugs
[00:43:52.549 --> 00:43:57.589]  over several years and we're going to bring you MRNA and we're going to use a virus, probably
[00:43:57.589 --> 00:44:02.629]  a bird flu out of China to do it. Because they want to brag to their criminal buddies
[00:44:02.629 --> 00:44:10.430]  up there and flaunt how stupid they think we are. I guess we are. Because if some random
[00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:16.310]  dude comes and rapes your wife, he goes to prison for five years, unless he's in a Democrat
[00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:23.549]  jurisdiction, maybe a month. But when they rape us with bio weapons through the shots,
[00:44:23.549 --> 00:44:33.149]  it's all cutesy and it's all funny. So there's an article a few days ago that I guess I missed
[00:44:33.149 --> 00:44:40.870]  on Infowars that we republished. WEF linked bioethicists, that's the ethics of medicine,
[00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:46.830]  called for genetically modifying humans to induce meat intolerance. Now let's look at
[00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:51.629]  his report. Here it is, Human Engineering and the Climate Change. Oh, it's to save the
[00:44:51.629 --> 00:44:59.629]  earth. Forthcoming as a target article in Ethics, Policy and the Environment, S. Matthew
[00:44:59.629 --> 00:45:09.069]  Liao, L-I-A-O, New York University, Anders Sandsburg, Oxford, and Rebecca Roach, Oxford.
[00:45:09.069 --> 00:45:21.910]  February 2nd, 2012. But he made the announcement two years ago. We're already inside the operation.
[00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:32.910]  And how does he say we do it? Exactly how they're doing it. Engineering humans show
[00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:38.229]  that we have a smaller carbon footprint. He wants to make humans smaller, genetically
[00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:45.350]  engineer us, give us shots so we can't eat meat, taking human engineering seriously,
[00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:54.149]  poisoning us, raping us, potential concerns regarding human engineering. Oh, isn't it all
[00:45:54.149 --> 00:46:01.830]  just cutesy-tootsie? But don't just read his paper, hear it out of his own mouth. And then
[00:46:02.669 --> 00:46:19.029]  look at what's happening to you right now. Where's your instincts? Where's your territorialism?
[00:46:19.029 --> 00:46:21.830]  Where's your life force? I'm not talking to our audience. I'm talking to new viewers and
[00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:29.029]  listeners that think this is all funny. You know, if somebody walked up to you at your
[00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:33.990]  office and said, I'm going to take your sandwich and I'm going to eat it, you'd probably say no.
[00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:37.149]  And if they picked it up for eating, you'd probably grab it from them. You might get
[00:46:37.149 --> 00:46:41.069]  in a fight with them because that's your sandwich. You're not going to let somebody run over you.
[00:46:41.069 --> 00:46:45.629]  You're not going to let somebody tie your wife down on a bed and rape her in front of you.
[00:46:45.629 --> 00:46:54.109]  But we let these academics rape us because we're epigenetically threatened by Hitler in a dark
[00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:58.990]  uniform or soldiers or tanks. We see that, we're ready to fight. But when it's a little
[00:46:59.029 --> 00:47:07.189]  trendy lisping of all Noah Harari or this scientist, we just let them do it to us because
[00:47:07.189 --> 00:47:13.910]  we don't see that as a threat. Bill Gates is the threat when they are. So here it is.
[00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:19.629]  I'm going to have it posted back to the Amy White wrote about this three days ago. I missed
[00:47:19.629 --> 00:47:26.790]  it. I have it posted to the main front page of Infowars.com right now. W.E.F. link bioethicists
[00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:31.950]  calls for genetically modifying humans to induce meat intolerance. We can use human
[00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:39.189]  engineering to make the case that we're intolerant to certain kinds of meat, to certain kinds
[00:47:39.189 --> 00:47:46.790]  of bovine proteins. Oh, we can get we can give you an injection that makes you allergic
[00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:55.830]  to bovine protein or other meats so that you can never eat them again.
[00:47:55.830 --> 00:48:02.790]  World Economic Forum included Lowe's proposals in the Great Reset discussion to shift human
[00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:11.549]  diet away from beef to mostly bugs and synthetic meat. Now, wait for this. It gets ten times
[00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:20.549]  worse. Where do you think Bill Gates's company patented grows its meat? Kind of meat grows.
[00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:25.109]  You cut out a piece of my bicep and you put it in a Petri dish. It doesn't grow. Use your
[00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:32.189]  head, folks. What type of meat? If you cut it out and put it in a Petri dish with cuter
[00:48:32.189 --> 00:48:39.509]  with with with protein and sugar, a base to grow life forms, what type of cell riddle
[00:48:39.509 --> 00:48:51.149]  me this Batman, what type of cell grows outside of a blood supply? Cancer. But not just any
[00:48:51.149 --> 00:48:57.790]  old cancer. Most cancer needs a blood supply. It'll just grow faster than regular cells
[00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:05.509]  outside of a genetically designed order. No, ladies and gentlemen, super cancer, immortal
[00:49:05.509 --> 00:49:14.029]  cell lines that never die and never stop replicating. And you can take a chunk. Of an immortal cell
[00:49:14.029 --> 00:49:19.189]  line, they only admit two people they found with them. A black lady in the early 50s and
[00:49:19.189 --> 00:49:24.310]  a tumor grew over her whole body in like a week and killed her. Pull up the first immortal
[00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:30.069]  cell of people. And then a little boy in the 1970s that was aborted at nine months, a little
[00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:36.069]  white boy. And almost all the biotech, everything you have is grown off them. They have reportedly
[00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:43.509]  grown hundreds of millions of pounds of her meat. And they can take a big chunk of a T-bone
[00:49:43.509 --> 00:49:52.189]  sized steak and throw it into a vat and come back in a month. And there's a giant, huge
[00:49:52.189 --> 00:49:59.109]  vat full of her meat. I forget her name, but it's a black lady, Henrietta.
[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:06.140]  Yeah, there it is. Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta Lacks.
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:09.140]  So, if you take growth hormone, it was grown on Henrietta Lacks.
[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:13.140]  They just take human growth hormone and put it in there and it grows it.
[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:16.140]  Almost all the genetic treatments, Henrietta Lacks.
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:21.140]  Factories all over the world, ladies and gentlemen, with her cancer.
[00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:24.140]  And what does Bill Gates do?
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:31.140]  His new synthetic meat has patented Henrietta Lacks' tumor.
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:37.140]  So, you're actually eating your cannibal with the synthetic meat.
[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:40.140]  There he is drinking sewage water, teaching you how good it is.
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:43.140]  Oh, look, it's good to drink sewage. It's good to eat bugs.
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.140]  Thank you, Bill Gates. He goes to the comedy shows.
[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:48.140]  I'm going to make you eat bugs. I'm going to make you eat poop.
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:54.140]  I'm going to make you eat – oh, yes, fine. I'm going to make you eat a dead black woman's tumors.
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:51:00.140]  Now, see what I mean? It's beyond hell-raiser. You can't make this up.
[00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:11.450]  So they grow these big vats of tumors off this dead black woman, or this white, dead
[00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:16.210]  white kid, but she's the main one. I'm sure they found others, they just don't talk about
[00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:23.170]  it. And they got cancers, folks, that are like the movie The Blob. Then they can dice
[00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:28.850]  them all up and turn them into whatever type of meat they claim it is, and you're eating
[00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:36.730]  Henrietta Lacks' meat. I was talking about five years ago, oh, Hollywood stars have begun
[00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:43.250]  to sell their cells so people can eat steaks made out of Brad Pitt, remember that? If you
[00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:52.410]  think I'm joking, look it up. But you know I'm not. So when I say we're not in Kansas
[00:51:52.410 --> 00:51:58.730]  anymore, that's an understatement. Human engineering and climate change, human engineering and climate
[00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:05.130]  change. Here's all the reports, the articles, how great it is. While we all need to go on
[00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:10.930]  the planetary health diet to save the world, he says, by eating tumors of a dead black
[00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:17.410]  woman and we need to shrink humans like they do and downsizing is actually somewhat possible
[00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:21.890]  and is not such a bad idea. Business Insider. Also, let's block out the sun. Bill Gates
[00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:27.690]  said so. Now the government signed on to it. Five ways bioethicists want to change our
[00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:32.170]  bodies to fight climate change. Man, oh, they didn't want to just ban your gas car or your
[00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:39.170]  gas stove. They didn't want to just shut down your barn, baby. They're going to kill your
[00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:44.370]  ass. And you're already eating. When you go get the great, delicious, synthetic meat that
[00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:51.370]  everybody refused and rejected, you're already eating it. In many cases, they also grow the
[00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:59.290]  flavoring on the bodies of dead babies. Liberal. So let's go ahead and just play a clip of
[00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:07.009]  this good old boy. Just a good old boy. Never mean no harm. Been in trouble with the law
[00:53:07.009 --> 00:53:12.930]  since the day they were born. Yeah, the bad guys are selling the moonshine. The bad guys
[00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:18.810]  are smoking cigarettes. The bad guys are being male chauvinists. The bad guys got a shotgun
[00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:24.090]  arrival and a four-wheel drive. But the good guys are little professors poisoning your
[00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:31.090]  shots and poisoning you and your family and collapsing every major food supply we got while
[00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:37.330]  they giggle and laugh because we're too stupid to figure it all out. You will eat bugs. You
[00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:44.330]  will eat tumor meat. You will own nothing. You will have nothing. How about we say no?
[00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:56.090]  Would you eat lab-grown human salami cultured from celebrity cells? See? It's called bite
[00:53:56.090 --> 00:54:02.609]  labs. I'm not making any of this up. Believe me, brothers and sisters. I wish I was making
[00:54:02.609 --> 00:54:07.930]  every damn bit of this up. But I couldn't make this up. Nobody could make this up. The
[00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:12.650]  Bible says in the end days, the satanic world government system will invent new evils. How
[00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:18.370]  do you do that? You just saw it. They're invent... It's been said by the Egyptians, nothing's
[00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:25.090]  new under the sun. Not true. This stuff's all new. So where's your dignity, folks? Where
[00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:32.090]  are you? Who are you? What limit will you not put up with? All right. Let's go ahead
[00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:38.290]  and go to this clip. W.E.F. link, bioethicist calls for genetically modified humans to induce
[00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:43.210]  meat intolerance by putting proteins via shots in your body that make you allergic to red
[00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:50.210]  meat to start, and it's here. They're doing it now. He wrote about it in a paper in 2011.
[00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:59.730]  2012, February 2nd. Here's the paper right here. Just like they won a Nobel Prize in
[00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:10.210]  1992 for chemtrailing, and it was being done two years later. And they're just doing it
[00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:17.130]  to us. Here he is. So I'll give two examples. So one is that people eat too much meat, right?
[00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:22.130]  And if they were to cut down on their consumption on meat, then it would actually really help
[00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:26.529]  the planet. But people are not willing to give up meat. Yeah, you know, some people
[00:55:26.529 --> 00:55:30.810]  will be willing to, but other people, they may be willing to, but they sort of, they
[00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:34.730]  have a weakness of will. They say, wow, this steak is just too juicy. I can't do it. I'm
[00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:39.250]  one of those, by the way. So, you know, but so here's the thought, right? So it turns
[00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:45.170]  out that we know a lot about, so we have this intolerance to, so I, for example, I have
[00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:51.770]  milk intolerance, and some people are intolerant to crayfish. So possibly we can use human
[00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:56.130]  engineering to make it the case that we're intolerant to certain kinds of meat, to certain
[00:55:56.130 --> 00:56:01.130]  kinds of bovine proteins. And there's actually analogs of this in life. There's this thing
[00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:06.330]  called the long star tick, where if it bites you, you will become allergic to meat. I can
[00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:10.410]  sort of describe the mechanism. So that's something that we can do through human engineering.
[00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:16.410]  We can kind of possibly address really big world problems through human engineering.
[00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:21.569]  They're way past putting atrazine in the water to bend your son's gender. And we shouldn't
[00:56:21.569 --> 00:56:24.569]  hate the people that have been hurt by this. They're victims. We should care about them
[00:56:24.569 --> 00:56:27.770]  and love them and let them know what happened to them. Because they're going to take more
[00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:31.049]  and more of the mutants that have been hurt and tell them they love them, they care about
[00:56:31.049 --> 00:56:34.730]  them and that we're the bad ones when they're the ones doing it to them. All right, I'm
[00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:39.170]  going to give the number out right now. And I'm going to take your calls next hour on
[00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:45.690]  this subject and this subject alone, human engineering by the globalists. How do we stop
[00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:55.410]  it? 877-789-2539. 877-789-Alex. 877-789-2539. We're doing first time callers today. First

[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:57.740]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:58.740]  diet.
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:04.419]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it,
[00:58:04.419 --> 00:58:11.259]  and they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s, but the problem
[00:58:11.259 --> 00:58:15.580]  today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[00:59:52.859 --> 00:59:57.859]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:01.859 --> 01:00:05.859]  All right, I talked about Rand Paul with critical information on the master criminal Fauci.
[01:00:05.859 --> 01:00:09.859]  We're going to play a clip of this from Fox News and come back and go right to your phone
[01:00:09.859 --> 01:00:10.859]  and so much other news.
[01:00:10.859 --> 01:00:11.859]  Stay with us.
[01:00:11.859 --> 01:00:12.859]  Infowars.com.
[01:00:15.859 --> 01:00:19.859]  Dr. Anthony Fauci now referred to the DOJ for criminal investigation.
[01:00:19.859 --> 01:00:20.859]  We knew this was heading here.
[01:00:20.859 --> 01:00:24.859]  He accused of lying under oath to Congress about his knowledge of the U.S.
[01:00:24.859 --> 01:00:29.859]  funded covid research in Wuhan.
[01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:31.859]  Knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress.
[01:00:31.859 --> 01:00:36.859]  Do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed that the NIH never
[01:00:36.859 --> 01:00:39.859]  funded gain of function research in Wuhan?
[01:00:39.859 --> 01:00:46.859]  Senator Paul, I have never lied before the Congress and I do not retract that statement.
[01:00:46.859 --> 01:00:49.859]  You do not know what you are talking about.
[01:00:49.859 --> 01:00:50.859]  Really?
[01:00:50.859 --> 01:00:53.859]  Senator Rand Paul filed the criminal referral and joins us now.
[01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:54.859]  Senator, you've been all over this.
[01:00:54.859 --> 01:00:55.859]  You've been aggressive.
[01:00:55.859 --> 01:00:56.859]  You've been determined.
[01:00:56.859 --> 01:01:00.859]  It seems you're at the threshold to the point where you called Matt Graves and said, I need
[01:01:00.859 --> 01:01:02.859]  you to look at this.
[01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:04.859]  What would turn the tables for you?
[01:01:04.859 --> 01:01:05.859]  What evidence do you have?
[01:01:06.859 --> 01:01:11.859]  You know, I don't think there's ever been a clear case of perjury in the history of government testimony.
[01:01:11.859 --> 01:01:13.859]  And I don't say that lightly.
[01:01:13.859 --> 01:01:18.859]  He said adamantly that the government never funded this gain of function research.
[01:01:18.859 --> 01:01:20.859]  We now have the government accountability office.
[01:01:20.859 --> 01:01:24.859]  The GAO has admitted that the funding came from the NIH.
[01:01:24.859 --> 01:01:30.859]  We have the acting director of the NIH admitting it in writing that it came from the NIH.
[01:01:30.859 --> 01:01:32.859]  But now we have really the smoking gun.
[01:01:33.859 --> 01:01:37.859]  And that is Fauci in private saying the opposite of what he was saying in public when he was
[01:01:37.859 --> 01:01:43.859]  publicly telling me that absolutely we did not fund gain of function research in China.
[01:01:43.859 --> 01:01:48.859]  He says privately, we are suspicious that the virus has been manipulated and we are
[01:01:48.859 --> 01:01:52.859]  suspicious because we know they are doing gain of function research.
[01:01:52.859 --> 01:01:55.859]  He then goes on to describe the research.
[01:01:55.859 --> 01:01:58.859]  And it's exactly the research that the NIH funded.
[01:01:58.859 --> 01:02:01.859]  So he's caught dead to rights here.
[01:02:01.859 --> 01:02:06.859]  But we have an incredibly partisan Attorney General Garland who's refusing to act.
[01:02:06.859 --> 01:02:10.859]  So I've taken the extraordinary step of actually going to the local U.S.
[01:02:10.859 --> 01:02:13.859]  attorney in D.C. to see if he will act.
[01:02:13.859 --> 01:02:18.859]  Now the problem is there are partisans littered throughout the legal system.
[01:02:18.859 --> 01:02:19.859]  And people are seeing this.
[01:02:19.859 --> 01:02:24.859]  You don't get prosecuted if you're a Democrat under this administration no matter what you do.
[01:02:24.859 --> 01:02:28.859]  And one of the lines in the internal communication that were recovered was,
[01:02:28.859 --> 01:02:32.859]  Tony doesn't want his fingerprints on any origin stories.
[01:02:32.859 --> 01:02:34.859]  Why would that be?
[01:02:35.859 --> 01:02:38.859]  Well, because ultimately culpability attaches.
[01:02:38.859 --> 01:02:39.859]  Think about it.
[01:02:39.859 --> 01:02:41.859]  A million Americans died.
[01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:46.859]  This is one of the biggest events in our lifetime other than the wars that we've been through.
[01:02:46.859 --> 01:02:49.859]  But in my lifetime, this is a million people.
[01:02:49.859 --> 01:02:54.859]  In Vietnam, as horrible as it was, 60,000 something I think was the total death toll.
[01:02:54.859 --> 01:02:56.859]  But a million people died.
[01:02:56.859 --> 01:02:58.859]  More people died than in the Civil War.
[01:02:58.859 --> 01:03:02.859]  And if it came from a lab that we funded, wouldn't we want to know?
[01:03:02.859 --> 01:03:05.859]  And if someone made the decision, and here's what in all likelihood happened,
[01:03:05.859 --> 01:03:09.859]  there was a safety committee that was supposed to review dangerous research
[01:03:09.859 --> 01:03:11.859]  and decide whether or not we should fund it.
[01:03:11.859 --> 01:03:13.859]  Fauci went around the committee.
[01:03:13.859 --> 01:03:16.859]  He won't admit it, but I think ultimately there's going to be written proof,
[01:03:16.859 --> 01:03:20.859]  and I think the House is going to get this if we continue to look into their records,
[01:03:20.859 --> 01:03:22.859]  because the government is holding these records tightly.
[01:03:22.859 --> 01:03:27.859]  But evidence that Anthony Fauci took this dangerous research and said,
[01:03:27.859 --> 01:03:29.859]  no, no, they get an exemption.
[01:03:29.859 --> 01:03:32.859]  They don't have to be reviewed by the committee to see if it's dangerous.
[01:03:32.859 --> 01:03:38.859]  And so they were mixing viruses together to see if they were more transmissible in humans
[01:03:38.859 --> 01:03:39.859]  or more dangerous in humans.
[01:03:39.859 --> 01:03:43.859]  It turns out they found that they could create viruses that were more dangerous.
[01:03:43.859 --> 01:03:48.859]  Yeah, some platypus and bat in a cave, or was he really as concerned as us
[01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:51.859]  and had many doubts about that story as we did?
[01:03:51.859 --> 01:03:54.859]  One of the quotes from the internal communication was,
[01:03:54.859 --> 01:04:00.859]  there were mutations in the virus that would be most unusual to have evolved naturally in the bats,
[01:04:00.859 --> 01:04:04.859]  and there was a suspicion that this mutation was intentionally inserted.
[01:04:04.859 --> 01:04:09.859]  That doesn't sound like a guy who's trying to tell you it didn't come from a lab leak, right?
[01:04:10.859 --> 01:04:15.859]  And exactly a month later, in a paper that was being written at exactly the same time,
[01:04:15.859 --> 01:04:21.859]  in public, they say absolutely that this virus was not a construct of a laboratory.
[01:04:21.859 --> 01:04:25.859]  So in private, they're saying it has all the hallmarks of being created in a lab.
[01:04:25.859 --> 01:04:28.859]  In public, they're saying it absolutely didn't.
[01:04:28.859 --> 01:04:32.859]  And then they were attacking people like myself and others, other scientists as well.
[01:04:32.859 --> 01:04:36.859]  They were attacking us and saying we were conspiracy theorists,
[01:04:37.859 --> 01:04:40.859]  while in private they're saying this is no conspiracy theory.
[01:04:40.859 --> 01:04:43.859]  This is a real thing, and it's the most likely thing that happened.
[01:04:43.859 --> 01:04:47.859]  So this is a real definition of a conspiracy, of a cover-up,
[01:04:47.859 --> 01:04:49.859]  and we're going to get to the bottom of this,
[01:04:49.859 --> 01:04:52.859]  because we need to try to make sure this doesn't happen again,
[01:04:52.859 --> 01:04:55.859]  and they're still funding this type of research.
[01:04:55.859 --> 01:04:58.859]  Senator, I appreciate you staying on it, you staying to the facts.
[01:04:59.859 --> 01:05:04.859]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength,
[01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:07.859]  and they can only be obtained through diet.
[01:05:07.859 --> 01:05:13.859]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[01:05:13.859 --> 01:05:19.859]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[01:05:19.859 --> 01:05:24.859]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[01:05:24.859 --> 01:05:31.859]  Your best option is our ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil at infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:32.859 --> 01:05:38.859]  Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for both our neurological and cardiovascular systems,

[01:05:40.859 --> 01:05:45.859]  They improve mood, mental clarity, and immune function.

[01:06:02.859 --> 01:06:07.859]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:07.859 --> 01:06:10.859]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:31.859 --> 01:06:33.859]  Nobody cares.
[01:06:33.859 --> 01:06:36.859]  You call it wartime.
[01:06:36.859 --> 01:06:38.859]  So I might as well be again.
[01:06:38.859 --> 01:06:39.859]  So what's the next?
[01:06:39.859 --> 01:06:42.859]  You'll be my wife.
[01:06:42.859 --> 01:06:43.859]  Break the law.
[01:06:43.859 --> 01:06:44.859]  Break the law.
[01:06:44.859 --> 01:06:46.859]  Well, we know who broke the law.
[01:06:46.859 --> 01:06:50.859]  It was the feds helping orchestrate the attack on the Capitol on January 6th,
[01:06:50.859 --> 01:06:52.859]  and they're trying to indict Trump for that now.
[01:06:52.859 --> 01:06:53.859]  They abandoned him.
[01:06:53.859 --> 01:06:56.859]  They're trying to put him in prison for it.
[01:06:56.859 --> 01:07:01.859]  Exposing their operation can and will bring down their entire fraud
[01:07:01.859 --> 01:07:05.859]  because they're using January 6th to brand the American people
[01:07:05.859 --> 01:07:09.859]  and any person that's a loyal American as a terrorist.
[01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:12.859]  Now, I want to go to your phone calls on the big subject,
[01:07:12.859 --> 01:07:16.859]  if you just joined us out there in radio and TV land.
[01:07:16.859 --> 01:07:18.859]  They admit exploding beef allergies.
[01:07:18.859 --> 01:07:24.859]  They admit on the FDA, CDC websites that the vaccines do have the protein
[01:07:24.859 --> 01:07:26.859]  that causes the autoimmune response.
[01:07:26.859 --> 01:07:27.859]  It makes you allergic to beef.
[01:07:27.859 --> 01:07:29.859]  They're trying to blame the Lone Star tick,
[01:07:29.859 --> 01:07:31.859]  even though all over the world where they're getting the shots,
[01:07:31.859 --> 01:07:33.859]  people now are having problems eating beef.
[01:07:33.859 --> 01:07:35.859]  They even have violent reactions.
[01:07:35.859 --> 01:07:36.859]  Some people even die.
[01:07:36.859 --> 01:07:39.859]  It's like if you have a bee allergy and you get stung by a bee.
[01:07:39.859 --> 01:07:44.859]  And then the crew's like, don't you remember?
[01:07:44.859 --> 01:07:51.859]  Here's the WEF scientists writing a paper in 2012 with Oxford and the UN
[01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:58.859]  to give you shots with the same protein that's in the Lone Star tick
[01:07:58.859 --> 01:08:00.859]  so that you can't eat beef anymore.
[01:08:00.859 --> 01:08:02.859]  I played the clip last hour.
[01:08:02.859 --> 01:08:04.859]  I'm going to play it again right now,
[01:08:04.859 --> 01:08:07.859]  and then I'm going to get into some of these reports.
[01:08:07.859 --> 01:08:10.859]  Moving towards sustainability, the livestock sector and the World Bank
[01:08:10.859 --> 01:08:13.859]  must ban 40% of the cows.
[01:08:13.859 --> 01:08:16.860]  How injuring the human body could combat climate change?
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:18.860]  The Atlantic.
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:25.860]  To help save the planet, cut back on hamburger and a half per week.
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:26.860]  And it just goes on.
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:28.860]  This is the geoengineering.
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:31.860]  We're going to inject something in you to give you this protein.
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:36.860]  They said 11 years ago at the UN and at Oxford and at the WEF,
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:39.860]  he brags about it two years ago, and it's ongoing.
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:41.860]  We know they're doing it through the shots.
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:44.860]  I showed you those documents the last few days.
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:46.860]  Last Monday, I put out a whole report that's on Bandot Video
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:50.860]  that went viral on Twitter.
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:53.860]  Think about the idiots that work for the system that just go along with this.
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:55.860]  But forget them.
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:58.860]  What about us putting up with it?
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:02.860]  So I want to get into more of this, but it is such a big deal.
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:04.860]  Let's go ahead and play this clip,
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:06.860]  and I'm going to hit the Tucker Carlson Capitol Police News
[01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:08.860]  to go to your phone calls.
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:10.860]  So I'll give two examples.
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:13.860]  So one is that people eat too much meat.
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:16.860]  And if they were to cut down on their consumption of meat,
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:19.860]  then it would actually really help the planet.
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:22.860]  But people are not willing to give up meat.
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:26.860]  Some people will be willing to, but other people, they may be willing to,
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:28.860]  but they have a weakness of will.
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:30.860]  They say, oh, this steak is just too juicy.
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:31.860]  I can't do it.
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:33.860]  I'm one of those, by the way.
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:35.860]  So here's a thought.
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:37.860]  So it turns out that we know a lot about.
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:40.860]  So we have these intolerance to.
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:42.860]  So for example, I have milk intolerance.
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:46.860]  And some people are intolerant to crayfish.
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:50.860]  So possibly we can use human engineering to make it the case
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:52.860]  that we're intolerant to certain kinds of meat,
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:55.860]  to certain kinds of bovine proteins.
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:57.860]  And there's actually analogs of this in life.
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.860]  There's this thing called the long star tick,
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:02.860]  where if it bites you, you will become allergic to meat.
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:04.860]  I can sort of describe the mechanism.
[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:07.860]  So that's something that we can do through human engineering.
[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:10.860]  We can kind of possibly address really big world problems
[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:12.860]  through human engineering.
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:17.860]  Solve our problems if we take control of your body
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:19.860]  through human engineering.
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:22.860]  What did the UN got doing in Africa and Asia in the mid-90s?
[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:24.860]  They got caught, came out in the news,
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:26.860]  adding a hormone to the tetanus shot that caused women,
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:29.860]  during second trimester, when the body released that hormone,
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:31.860]  to not be able to complete the pregnancy.
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:35.860]  100% spontaneous miscarriages, forced abortions,
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:37.860]  murder of babies.
[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:41.860]  And from here, they've just taken off with everything.
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:44.860]  The medical system may have some good doctors and nurses
[01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:46.860]  and clinics and people in it, but at the top,
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:49.860]  the technocracy, the bioethicists, are eugenicists,
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:53.860]  transhumanist murderers, and you have to avoid everything
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:55.860]  they push, like the plague.
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:57.860]  They have a license to kill.
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.860]  Now look at this headline.
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:01.860]  The full video is up on Infowars.com.
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:03.860]  It was Pelosi, former Capitol Police Chief,
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:06.860]  revealed set up behind January 6th.
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:12.860]  The full 59-minute interview with Tucker is up on Infowars.com.
[01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:15.860]  But here is a few clips.
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:19.860]  Former Capitol Police Chief Stephen Son tells Tucker
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.860]  about feds in the crowd.
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:25.860]  Then, former Capitol Police Chief Stephen Son reveals to Tucker,
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:28.860]  New Jersey State Police beat D.C. National Guard
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:31.860]  to the Capitol on January 6th.
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:34.860]  They had D.C. Police and others there.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:37.860]  Former Capitol Police Chief Stephen Son reacts
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.860]  to shocking tapes of rehabs during January 6th,
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.860]  protection that followed for political cases
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:45.860]  and law enforcement.
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.860]  They try to intimidate people, rehabs,
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:49.860]  saying he's going to sue everybody and sue Joe Rogan
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.860]  for simply pointing out these news stories.
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:53.860]  It's crazy.
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:55.860]  So let's go ahead and play these clips back-to-back
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:57.860]  and go to your calls.
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:00.860]  We got this from military intelligence.
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:04.860]  So in the aftermath of January 6th,
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:07.860]  there's been a huge debate over to what extent,
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:11.860]  you know, there were federal agents or people
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:13.860]  who are working in some way for federal agencies
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:15.860]  in the crowd.
[01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:18.860]  And the initial explanation was, well, none,
[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:20.860]  and you're insane if you think that.
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.860]  You know, you're Alex Jones, you're crazy.
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.860]  And then over the last couple of years,
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:28.860]  we've seen people confirm, people in authority confirm,
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:32.860]  actually, yeah, there were a lot in the crowd that day.
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:35.860]  I mean, that's now a fact.
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:37.860]  Did you know that going in?
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:38.860]  No.
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:39.860]  No.
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:40.860]  So just for perspective,
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:42.860]  since you've been to a lot of these events,
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.860]  there's a huge, a planned demonstration
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.860]  in Washington, D.C.
[01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:51.860]  Will there always be assets, agents,
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:53.860]  people working for federal agencies
[01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:54.860]  in the crowd in civilian clothes?
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:56.860]  There always could be.
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:58.860]  And for, like, inaugurations,
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:02.860]  there would usually be some combined teams out there,
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:04.860]  one for communications, but just, you know,
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:06.860]  for situational awareness.
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:08.860]  So it wouldn't be surprising, you know,
[01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:10.860]  4th of July, different things like that,
[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:12.860]  where you have threat pictures or concerning threat pictures.
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:13.860]  And what does that look like?
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:17.860]  Does that mean, you know, FBI agents dressed in dockers
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.860]  and tennis shoes trying to...
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:22.860]  Well, it'd just be, yeah, just plain clothes.
[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:23.860]  Plain clothes.
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:24.860]  Plain clothes to blend in.
[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:25.860]  So that wouldn't be unusual.
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.860]  And it'd be, you know, just standard police work.
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:29.860]  That'd be good police work.
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:32.860]  So coming into January 6th, and I talk about it in the book,
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:35.860]  with the fact that shortly after January 6th,
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:37.860]  I'm driving through Loudoun County.
[01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:40.860]  Actually, I just talked to somebody from the Hill.
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.860]  And I get a call from overseas.
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:43.860]  And it's press.
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:44.860]  I don't remember what it was.
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:46.860]  It was somebody from Great Britain.
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:49.860]  And they started asking me about feds in the crowd.
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.860]  And I was like, well, I would have been told.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:53.860]  I said, no, we're getting word that there's feds in the crowd.
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:55.860]  I said, no, I would have been told.
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:57.860]  I've got lots of friends with the Bureau.
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:58.860]  They all have my cell phone number.
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:13:59.860]  They would have told me.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:04.860]  You know, thinking about that, and Jill Sanborn's testimony in 2021
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:06.860]  where she said they were taking overt action
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:09.860]  to keep certain people from coming to January 6th to Washington, D.C.,
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:13.860]  that's big for FBI to start taking overt action.
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:16.860]  I mean, that's not covert, overt.
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:18.860]  That's a big deal.
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:21.860]  Fast forward to February of this year, 2023,
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:25.860]  and the GAO report that says on January 3rd,
[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:28.860]  the FBI was tracking four domestic terrorists that we're talking about
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:30.860]  coming to Washington, D.C., the Washington Field Office,
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:32.860]  their AOR area of responsibility.
[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:35.860]  By January 6th, they were tracking 18 or 19.
[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:37.860]  It's in the GAO report.
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:39.860]  Domestic terrorists.
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:40.860]  So think about that.
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:43.860]  They have 18 or 19 domestic terrorists coming to this event.
[01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:46.860]  So, of course, they're going to have resources on them.
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:48.860]  And you're not going to be just putting one agent.
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:49.860]  You're going to have multiple.
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:50.860]  So it would be multiple with that.
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:52.860]  And I don't know how many they actually had coming there.
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:55.860]  Folks never said, hey, we got this from military intelligence.
[01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:59.860]  So in the aftermath of January 6th,
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:03.860]  there's been a huge debate over to what extent, you know,
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:07.860]  there were federal agents or people who are working in some way
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:10.860]  for federal agencies in the crowd.
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:13.860]  And the initial explanation was, well, none.
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:15.860]  And you're insane if you think that.
[01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:16.860]  You know, you're Alex Jones.
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:17.860]  You're crazy.
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:19.860]  And then over the last couple of years,
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:23.860]  we've seen people confirm, people in authority confirm,
[01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:27.860]  actually, yeah, there were a lot in the crowd that day.
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:30.860]  I mean, that's now a fact.
[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.860]  Did you know that going in?
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:33.860]  No.
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:34.860]  No.
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:37.860]  So just for perspective, since you've been to a lot of these events.
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:39.860]  Yeah, for some reason, this is repeating the same clip.
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:43.860]  Go to clip 15, guys.
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:45.860]  And I don't have the answer to this question.
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:47.860]  And I hope I don't ever pretend that I do.
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:51.860]  But it does raise questions about the behavior of some of the people
[01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:56.860]  in the crowd who were instigating others to break the law
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:58.860]  and who weren't arrested.
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:03.860]  And, you know, given our facial recognition software capabilities,
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.860]  hard to believe they can't be found.
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:08.860]  And I would specifically cite a man called Ray Epps,
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:11.860]  who's now a hero on the left and funded by the Democratic Party,
[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:14.860]  et cetera, but take the politics out of it.
[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:15.860]  What is that?
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:18.860]  Here you have a guy on camera repeatedly saying,
[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:20.860]  we're going to the Capitol.
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:22.860]  We need to go into the Capitol.
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:25.860]  Into the Capitol.
[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:26.860]  And he's not in jail.
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:30.860]  When people who didn't go into the Capitol are in jail,
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:32.860]  what do you make of that?
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:34.860]  Again, that's something I actually address in the book.
[01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:35.860]  It's funny.
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:36.860]  There's a lot in here.
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:39.860]  So my concern with that, and I look at it from a chief of police point of view,
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:41.860]  is you have somebody that's down,
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:44.860]  I believe he's right near the old executive office building on the 5th,
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:46.860]  the day before January 6th, talking to a group of people,
[01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:48.860]  talking about we have to get into the building.
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:49.860]  We have to get in the building.
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:53.860]  And then the next day to see him at what's called the Pennsylvania Avenue Gate,
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.860]  it's one of the two fence lines I had down at the West Front,
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:17:02.860]  and he's there, and he clearly sees the metal crowd control barriers that are up
[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:04.860]  with the signs saying restricted.
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:06.860]  So he knows that's a restricted area.
[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:08.860]  And he's up there, and you see him lean in,
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:09.860]  and he whispers in somebody's ear,
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:12.860]  and he covers his mouth in such a way so you can't read his lips or anything,
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:13.860]  whispers in somebody's ear,
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:17.860]  and that person moments later is attacking my officers.
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:19.860]  That's suspicious as hell to me.
[01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:20.860]  It raised a lot of concerns for me.
[01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:21.860]  What is that?
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:23.860]  And what's interesting is I believe. . .
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:24.860]  And that's verified.
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:27.860]  The person into who's ear he whispered. . .
[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:28.860]  Yeah, I think if you watch the video,
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:31.860]  you see that person immediately go and start pulling on the gate
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.860]  and start fighting with the officers.
[01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:37.860]  And what's interesting is I believe he went on 60 minutes.
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:41.860]  And on 60 minutes, what he said was he went up to the officer,
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:42.860]  and he told that officer,
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:44.860]  these officers are on our side.
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:45.860]  Don't hurt these officers.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:48.860]  I believe that was pretty much not verbatim.
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:49.860]  But don't hurt these officers.
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:50.860]  They're on our side.
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:51.860]  Don't hurt these officers.
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:54.860]  Well, if that's the case, why would you cover your mouth
[01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:56.860]  and not yell it to everybody?
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:58.860]  Because it didn't seem like that protester was the only one
[01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:00.860]  that was possibly going to be hurting the officers.
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:01.860]  We had a whole bunch of people next to him.
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:03.860]  Why wouldn't he tell it to the whole group?
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:04.860]  I don't know.
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:07.860]  I know that Epps is being encouraged by partisan Democrats
[01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:09.860]  to sue people who raise these questions,
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:12.860]  but they're fair questions, and I'm going to raise them anyway.
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:17.860]  How, given that tape, could the January 6th committee
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.860]  defend Ray Epps, which they did?
[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:21.860]  It doesn't make any sense to me.
[01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:23.860]  Yeah, I'm having trouble answering that one.
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:25.860]  I don't know.
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:27.860]  All right, and the best clip, for some reason,
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:28.860]  didn't get on the computer, so we didn't play it,
[01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:30.860]  but you can see it at InfoWars.com.
[01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:35.860]  Because Pelosi set it up that they denied them the National Guard
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:37.860]  and they would not respond to him for help that day.
[01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:39.860]  It's an incredible interview.
[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:42.860]  It's up on InfoWars.com, but this is truly disgusting.
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:45.860]  Ray Epps, in his text message, at, what, 245,
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:47.860]  after they'd already gotten to the Capitol, was like,
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:48.860]  I orchestrated it to his family.
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:51.860]  I orchestrated the attack on the Capitol.
[01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:54.860]  And then he's there ramming signs into him as well.
[01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:57.860]  So it's just ridiculous.
[01:18:57.860 --> 01:18:59.860]  And then they threatened to sue Joe Rogan because he says,
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:01.860]  I don't know if he's a Fed, but people are calling him a Fed.
[01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:02.860]  Why isn't he arrested?
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:04.860]  Oh, I'm going to sue you.
[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:07.860]  They put up that disinfo a month ago that he's been charged.
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:09.860]  He hasn't been.
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:13.860]  It's like Elon Musk saying he's going to fight Zuckerberg,
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:14.860]  and it has the effect that he fought him, and then he says,
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:16.860]  Well, I'm not going to fight him now.
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:19.860]  It's psychological stuff where they tell you Ray Epps has been indicted.
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:21.860]  Oh, well, then he wasn't a Fed.
[01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:23.860]  He's not been indicted.
[01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:25.860]  And don't hold your breath.
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:28.860]  But these are the games they play.
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:29.860]  All right.
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:31.860]  Bill.
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:32.860]  Noel.
[01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:33.860]  Tina.
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:34.860]  Ian.
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:35.860]  Granny Green.
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:36.860]  Angry Man.
[01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:37.860]  Stu.
[01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:38.860]  George.
[01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:39.860]  Chad.
[01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:40.860]  We're going to all your calls right now.
[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:43.860]  Let's go to Noel in Colorado on human engineering.
[01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:45.860]  You say it's going to get worse from here.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:51.860]  Go ahead.
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:52.860]  All right.
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:53.860]  So you hear me, Noel?
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:54.860]  You're not there?
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:55.860]  All right.
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:56.860]  Thanks for the call.
[01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:57.860]  I appreciate it.
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:58.860]  Thanks for the call.
[01:19:58.860 --> 01:19:59.860]  Let's talk to a caller in Connecticut.
[01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:00.860]  Let's talk to Tina.
[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:01.860]  Tina, you're on the air.
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:02.860]  Go ahead.
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:03.860]  Hi, Alex.
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:04.860]  God bless you.
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:09.860]  God bless you for guiding us through this nightmare.
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:11.860]  I'm so grateful.
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:15.860]  I'm just stunned today based on your report.
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:18.860]  I never miss you.
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:20.860]  If I do, I watch you later.
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:25.860]  But I have been injured by the shot.
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:28.860]  I went to a prestigious hospital.
[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:30.860]  They basically kicked me out after 10 days.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:31.860]  Said, yeah, we don't know.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:35.860]  Go see one of our doctors, outpatient.
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:37.860]  And you shine a light.
[01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:40.860]  You guide us.
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:42.860]  We will be victorious in the end.
[01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:44.860]  So this is God's will.
[01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:45.860]  But gosh, we need you.
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:47.860]  And we support you.
[01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:50.860]  Gosh, we love your Alexa Pure air filter.
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:51.860]  Not air filter.
[01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:52.860]  Sorry.
[01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:53.860]  There's an air filter, too.
[01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:54.860]  They're both excellent.
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:55.860]  Look, I'm in the same fight as you are.
[01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:58.860]  I want to thank you for keeping us in the fight, Tina, as well.
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:01.860]  What's happened to you since you took the shots?
[01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:03.860]  Oh, gosh.
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:08.860]  Well, the doctor that I saw thought that I had a stroke.
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:12.860]  So I went to the hospital.
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:14.860]  And my veins actually closed up.
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:16.860]  I had the best veins.
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:19.860]  I had what's called POTS syndrome.
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:23.860]  Not able to eat anything.
[01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.860]  I was on apples for the longest time.
[01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:30.860]  Now I only have, like, two things that I've been eating for three years.
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:33.860]  I've developed an allergy to corn.
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:34.860]  And corn is in everything.
[01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:36.860]  I couldn't eat it.
[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:37.860]  And sulfur.
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:41.860]  I couldn't even wash my hair with shampoo.
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:46.860]  Did you take the Pfizer or Moderna shot?
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:48.860]  Pfizer.
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:52.860]  It's the same shot, just the Moderna's many times stronger.
[01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:55.860]  Did you get better?
[01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:56.860]  Did something mitigate this?
[01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:57.860]  Or how are you doing now?
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:22:04.860]  I would say slowly over time it feels like it's detaxing.
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:11.860]  I'm just starting to expand my diet to rice.
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:15.860]  So I'm still suffering.
[01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:19.860]  I'm 114 pounds now.
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:25.860]  So I was 130 and just not able to tolerate anything.
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:28.860]  How fast after the shot did this happen?
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:30.860]  And did your doctor deny any length?
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:42.860]  The doctor said that he had heard of some people having reactions.
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:47.860]  But I actually went to them and thought that I had MS.
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:54.860]  So that was probably two months after, I think.
[01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:56.860]  I mean, my mind is shut, too.
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:23:00.860]  So I went and had the MRI.
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:04.860]  Oh, and then called 911 because I had chest pains.
[01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:06.860]  Wow.
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:09.860]  Yeah, so it was a nightmare.
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:10.860]  Well, we're glad you're a lot better.
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:11.860]  And I'm so sorry this happened to you.
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:12.860]  Were you a listener then?
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:14.860]  Or did you become a listener after?
[01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:15.860]  Or did you get bullied into the shot?
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:16.860]  Why did you take the shot?
[01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:26.860]  I was afraid that I was going to give my husband the virus.
[01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:29.860]  So I believed the prophecy.
[01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:32.860]  So you did it to help people, just like Ernest Ramirez did.
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:33.860]  Yeah.
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:35.860]  Well, once bitten, twice shy.
[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:37.860]  Were you a listener to that person before?
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:39.860]  Or were you a listener after?
[01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:41.860]  I was a listener after.
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:44.860]  And I am so dedicated to you.
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:49.860]  I shut everything else off when it comes to 12 o'clock.
[01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:51.860]  How horrifying is it?
[01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:55.860]  Or is it horrifying to you that we now know they're putting it in the shots,
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:58.860]  they admit it in the FDA documents to give us a beef allergy,
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:02.860]  and obviously would use so many other allergies once we've taken this?
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:05.860]  I mean, this is so murderous, so criminal, so abusive.
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:07.860]  It's total rape.
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:09.860]  Yes.
[01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:10.860]  Yes.
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:12.860]  I'm shocked.
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:16.860]  I mean, I like to think I'm very awake.
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:18.860]  But, yeah.
[01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:20.860]  But it makes perfect sense.
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:21.860]  It's diabolical.
[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:23.860]  Absolutely.
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:25.860]  Diabolical, meaning of the devil.
[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:27.860]  Well, warn everybody you can.
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:29.860]  Nobody can stop you individually spreading the word.
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:31.860]  Please tell everybody about InfoWars.com.
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:33.860]  And God bless you, Tina.
[01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:35.860]  Disgusting what they did to her, huh?
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:37.860]  And they admit they're doing it right here.
[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:38.860]  We just showed you all the evidence.
[01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:39.860]  Incredible evil.
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:42.860]  It's on the FDA and EPA website, CDC website,
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:44.860]  that the shots are causing this.
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:45.860]  They don't even deny it.
[01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:47.860]  But I think you're too dumb to find it.
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:48.860]  And it's got cancer viruses in it.
[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:50.860]  I showed you that mainstream news yesterday.
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:54.860]  Granny Green in Canada, alpha-gal syndrome.
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:56.860]  Give us your take on it.
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:00.860]  Well, thank you once again, Alex, for being you.
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:04.860]  You have done such a wondrous work sharing the truth.
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:05.860]  And, boy, you helped me out, too,
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:08.860]  because I've been on the same track as you for over 30 years,
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:11.860]  and I look like a crazy lady back in the day,
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:13.860]  but not so much anymore.
[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:15.860]  The reason why I'm calling today, too,
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:20.860]  is I don't think this is their first round of trying to stop us from eating meat.
[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:24.860]  20 years ago, I was misdiagnosed with having severe depression,
[01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:26.860]  and they gave me Paxil.
[01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:30.860]  And I started taking it, and I started feeling really weird.
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:36.860]  And it got to the point I could not even look at meat, and I would vomit.
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:38.860]  And it happened so suddenly.
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:41.860]  One day my husband went out, did the groceries,
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:44.860]  come home and started handing me meat to put in the freezer,
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:47.860]  and I started gagging.
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:51.860]  And I literally, it started with chicken, and then it moved to beef.
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:53.860]  Oh, yeah, once you've been poisoned by something,
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:54.860]  just the smell of it makes you sick.
[01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:57.860]  And then, again, they make meat poison.
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:25:59.860]  But it was the pills.
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:02.860]  I do believe it was Paxil, because I had never.
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:04.860]  Yeah, Paxil is really bad.
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:07.860]  It causes all sorts of weird disorders.
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:11.860]  Well, the minute I got off it, and basically I couldn't eat any meat,
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:15.860]  I literally dropped my B12, went right down and everything else.
[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:20.860]  And the minute I stopped taking those pills, I was able to eat meat.
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:23.860]  First off, it was interesting to be able to even look at it.
[01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:27.860]  So I really don't think this is, you know, like this here is the first time around.
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:32.860]  I'd be interested to know how many people that have been on some sort of antidepressant
[01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:37.860]  have really bad reactions right now even to meat.
[01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:39.860]  And the other thing I wanted to talk to you about,
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:44.860]  I don't know if you've heard the case of Garner Harper, Garnet Harper,
[01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:49.860]  and he was denied a kidney in Canada because, like some of us here,
[01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:54.860]  he's a pureblood, and he died, a 35-year-old man.
[01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:55.860]  I saw that.
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:58.860]  Yes, well, he's a dear friend of ours, Alex.
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:01.860]  And what they did to him was totally injustice.
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:02.860]  It was not right.
[01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:04.860]  He left five babies and a beautiful wife.
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:08.860]  And I would just ask that the audience please pray for this family.
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:10.860]  Hold these children up.
[01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:15.860]  He was such a good man, such a good father, and such a good warrior for the cause.
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:20.860]  He stood up and he went and helped out nurses, whoever he could help out.
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:21.860]  And that's a technocracy for you.
[01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:23.860]  Won't take the shot.
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:25.860]  Total Nuremberg violation.
[01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:29.860]  If you take somebody's medical rights or their rights for not taking a forced treatment,
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:32.860]  that is a violation of the Nuremberg Code, punishable by death.
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:34.860]  I was familiar with that case.
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:39.860]  For people who don't remember it, tell us this victim of the biomedical tyranny's name again.
[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:45.860]  Garnett Harper, and he died May 22nd of this year, 2023.
[01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:47.860]  His five beautiful children.
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:53.860]  And what they did to him at that hospital in our city, that alone should be criminal.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:55.860]  We're going to pull that up.
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:57.860]  I remember seeing that.
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:27:59.860]  So sorry to hear that, Granny.
[01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:00.860]  Be safe and God bless you.
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:01.860]  Keep spreading the word.
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:02.860]  We're going to take a break.
[01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:07.860]  Come back with Bill, Ian, Angry Man, Stu, George, Chad, and others.
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:13.860]  Our toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:18.860]  And yeah, this is total war by the deep state, by the medical tyranny.
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:19.860]  They love it.
[01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:20.860]  They think it's funny.
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:24.860]  Now, your average doctor's not in on it, but the bioethics boards are in almost every case.
[01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:26.860]  And they are eugenicists.
[01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:28.860]  They are a Peter Singer death cult.
[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:30.860]  Look into it for yourself.
[01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:31.860]  And they are attacking us.
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:34.860]  And they're laughing, thinking we don't know what they've done.
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:36.860]  Fauci's one of their top people.
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:37.860]  Bill Gates, all of them.
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:40.860]  And it is just going to get more insane on from here.
[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:41.860]  There it is.
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:45.860]  Ontario man dies after being denied kidney transplant for being unvaccinated.
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:48.860]  Absolute evil.
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:49.860]  Murderers.
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:50.860]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:53.860]  Infowars.com is the tip of the spear.

[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:10.860]  Now.
[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:11.860]  Now.
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:12.860]  Now.
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:13.860]  Now.
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:14.860]  Now.
[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:15.860]  Now.
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:16.860]  Now.
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:17.860]  Now.
[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:18.860]  Now.
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:19.860]  Now.
[01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:20.860]  Now.
[01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:21.860]  Now.
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:22.860]  Now.
[01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:23.860]  Now.
[01:32:58.510 --> 01:33:08.510]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:31.580]  Another world, another time. In the age of wonder, another world, another time.
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:41.580]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:48.580]  Live from Austin, Texas, Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:54.580]  And we are back live, Broadcasting Worldwide, on this live Friday edition.
[01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:58.580]  We're taking your phone calls. We open the phones up.
[01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:01.580]  We're not screening your calls other than where you're calling from.
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:03.580]  And if you want to give us a topic, just so you have a clean phone line.
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:06.580]  But nobody's calling in that loved the Pfizer shots or Moderna shots.
[01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:08.580]  Nobody I know wants more of them either.
[01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:10.580]  In fact, it's just person after person.
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:16.580]  Three crew members out of six have family members that can't eat beef now if they took the shot.
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:21.580]  And then we have all the studies that they know it, they're doing it, it's funny.
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:26.580]  They brag about how they're going to do it to us so we can't eat beef.
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:30.580]  And we just sit here and take it.
[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:34.580]  And Fauci has gain of function and lies to Congress.
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:39.580]  And we have his own documents where he ran gain of function programs and called them gain of function.
[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:41.580]  And Senator Paul sends them the whole dossier.
[01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:45.580]  And the feds say, we're not even responding to you.
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:52.580]  All they got in control is the major courts, the Justice Department, and the bioethics boards that Bill Gates has financed.
[01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:57.580]  And it's game over, folks, unless we just do not comply with anything they push or do.
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:59.580]  But now Gates is coming out.
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:06.580]  They've had him for decades with, quote, vaccines or human engineering in the food.
[01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:08.580]  Couldn't be a bigger issue.
[01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:10.580]  Bill in North Dakota, you're on the air.
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:12.580]  Go ahead.
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:13.580]  Hey, Alex.
[01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:15.580]  It's a real pleasure talking with you.
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:23.580]  I don't know if people know this, but we have deaf systems on our trucks, semi-trucks.
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:26.580]  So we have to use the diesel exhaust fluid stuff.
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:30.580]  We have to double-check on the engines.
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:33.580]  On the older engines, we'll be able to get.
[01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:37.580]  Hey, brother, I really want to be able to talk to you, but it sounds like you're in a windstorm.
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:41.580]  So try to get in the cab of your truck, close the window, and I'll go back to you in a couple minutes.
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:42.580]  Okay, we'll try again.
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:44.580]  Let's talk to Chad in Nebraska.
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:45.580]  Chad, you're on the air.
[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:50.580]  Go ahead.
[01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:51.580]  Can you hear me okay?
[01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:52.580]  I can, Chad.
[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:53.580]  Go ahead.
[01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:54.580]  You can?
[01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:56.580]  A hundred percent.
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:57.580]  Okay.
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:35:58.580]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:04.580]  I've been a fan since, like, 2011.
[01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:08.580]  I'm just so angry with what's going on in our country right now.
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:12.580]  And I know that you talk a lot about, you know, we've got to do this in peaceful means.
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:18.580]  But when they're literally trying to kill us, how can we do that with peaceful means?
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:25.580]  Well, again, they don't do it through an army.
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:26.580]  They don't attack you in uniforms.
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:28.580]  They don't show up in UN blue helmets.
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:30.580]  They get the bureaucracy.
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:32.580]  They kill you by cutting off energy.
[01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:33.580]  They kill you by shipping in fentanyl.
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:35.580]  They kill you by poisoning the food.
[01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:36.580]  They kill you with 5G.
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:38.580]  They kill you a hundred different ways.
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:42.580]  We have to become aware of it and pull out of it and dismantle it peacefully.
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:44.580]  The average cop doesn't know this has happened.
[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:46.580]  The average FBI agent doesn't know that.
[01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:48.580]  You could walk up and kill them all day.
[01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:50.580]  That would actually help the globalists create more destabilization.
[01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:52.580]  We have to pull our children out of the public schools.
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:54.580]  We have to stop eating the GMO.
[01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:56.580]  We have to not put up or use 5G.
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:59.580]  We have to not take these poison shots.
[01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:01.580]  I mean, I know it seems easy.
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:07.580]  Like if some guy in a village a thousand years ago killed your son, you'd get a club.
[01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:09.580]  Your wife saw him kill your son for no reason.
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:10.580]  You beat his brains out.
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:11.580]  Problem solved.
[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:13.580]  At least you won't hurt somebody else.
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:16.580]  This is not some caveman level event.
[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:20.580]  You have to be sophisticated and understand it and take it on that way.
[01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:21.580]  Does that make sense?
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:23.580]  Yeah, it does.
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:27.580]  It's just frustrating when you're raising kids in this country.
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:32.580]  This country doesn't look anything or feel anything like the country that I grew up in.
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:34.580]  Well, it's the whole world, brother.
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:35.580]  We need to sue Fauci.
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:36.580]  We need to call for his indictment.
[01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:38.580]  People should peacefully protest him.
[01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:40.580]  He should be hounded everywhere.
[01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:41.580]  So should Bill Gates.
[01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:44.580]  People should pull their stock out of those companies.
[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:46.580]  People should protest at all the clinics.
[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:50.580]  I mean, people have to stop taking it lying down and make a big noise.
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:58.580]  What happens when a crow, one of the smartest birds out there in the whole raven family,
[01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:01.580]  crows always go in twos, in groups of twos.
[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:04.580]  And when they see a person, they know it's non-threatening.
[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:06.580]  They go, ah, ah, a certain call.
[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:07.580]  They can even count.
[01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:08.580]  My dad had a pet crow growing up as a kid.
[01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:09.580]  It fell out of a tree.
[01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:12.580]  And Mr. Crow lived like 10 years until an owl killed him.
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:14.580]  One night, he was sitting down on the clothesline,
[01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:18.580]  and an owl came in and terminated him right as the sun was going down.
[01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:20.580]  That's what they do because he was a crow by himself.
[01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:22.580]  But other crows watch.
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:27.580]  And so we can go, car, car, car, about Fauci, about the New World Order.
[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:28.580]  We can say, hey, that's bad.
[01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:29.580]  Hey, that's not good.
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:31.580]  We can watch out for each other.
[01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:32.580]  We're as smart as a crow.
[01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:33.580]  We're a lot smarter.
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:37.580]  And so it really just comes down to we've got to warn everybody.
[01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:38.580]  We've got to warn each other.
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:40.580]  And we've got to realize we're really under attack, brother.
[01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:42.580]  Yeah.
[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:45.580]  Yeah, well, it was a real pleasure talking to you, Alex.
[01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:46.580]  I know you've got other calls.
[01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:47.580]  No, it's a pleasure talking to you.
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:48.580]  I mean, what else do you think we should do?
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:49.580]  I mean, I hear you.
[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:52.580]  Once we get the government back, we need Nuremberg trial.
[01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:53.580]  They need to be tried, convicted.
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:54.580]  They need to be executed.
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:55.580]  I mean, they deserve it.
[01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:56.580]  I'm not an addictive person.
[01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:57.580]  I'm not into death.
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:59.580]  But, I mean, we need to see national hanging of these people.
[01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:03.580]  They need to be not killed by us extrajudicially.
[01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:07.580]  They need to be killed politically by exposing them nonviolently.
[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:08.580]  Kill their name.
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:10.580]  Convict them publicly.
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:12.580]  And then physically convict them.
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:13.580]  And then they need to be hung.
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:14.580]  It's very simple.
[01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:16.580]  I agree 100%.
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:18.580]  100%.
[01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:21.580]  They're the self-appointed masters of the universe playing God on us, folks.
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:25.580]  And, you know, you go watch a movie like Guardians of the Galaxy.
[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:28.580]  I was in a hotel room Monday night.
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:30.580]  In Dallas.
[01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:32.580]  And, you know, I couldn't go to sleep.
[01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:35.580]  So, I said, okay, let me watch Guardians of the Galaxy.
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:38.580]  The first two were okay.
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:41.580]  And it was a mad scientist that's kidnapping children and doing medical
[01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:46.580]  experiments and accelerating evolution and planning to play God.
[01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:49.580]  And they're telling you who they are.
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:50.580]  I mean, that's not a movie, folks.
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:52.580]  That's what they're doing.
[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:53.580]  Thank you, Chad.
[01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:54.580]  Angry man in New York.
[01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:55.580]  You're on the air.
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:56.580]  Go ahead.
[01:39:56.580 --> 01:39:59.580]  Brother, are you there?
[01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:00.580]  Absolutely.
[01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:01.580]  Everybody keeps asking if I'm there.
[01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:02.580]  I swear to you, brother.
[01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:03.580]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:04.580]  Let's do this.
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:05.580]  Angry man, angry man.
[01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:06.580]  I'm here, brother.
[01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:07.580]  I'm here.
[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:10.580]  Hey, 25 years I've been listening to you.
[01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:11.580]  God bless you.
[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:14.580]  And I'll tell you right now, before you could stop something,
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:16.580]  you have to know when it's coming.
[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:19.580]  And the people in this country don't know what the hell is going on.
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:20.580]  And most of them don't care.
[01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:22.580]  And if you try to tell them anything about it,
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:24.580]  they don't want to hear it or they don't believe it.
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:28.580]  So how do you stand a chance of changing anything when nobody knows?
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:32.580]  I don't think it's going to happen.
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:37.580]  Yeah, I see the comment you put on the screen is no chance to stop any of this.
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:40.580]  I think until the public stops laying over and going along with this,
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:42.580]  I don't think there is a chance to stop it.
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:43.580]  Well, that's the problem.
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:45.580]  You can't get them to wake up.
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:46.580]  Nobody wants to hear it.
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:47.580]  And what they do, they don't believe.
[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:49.580]  So, like I said,
[01:40:49.580 --> 01:40:54.580]  I think we stand about as much chance of a change in anything.
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:55.580]  Well, let me say this.
[01:40:55.580 --> 01:40:58.580]  Historically, it's always darkest until the dawn.
[01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:00.580]  Things have to get really bad before they get good.
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:01.580]  There is a big awakening happening.
[01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:05.580]  But people are still at disadvantage because they can't believe how evil this is
[01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:07.580]  or how premeditated this is.
[01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:10.580]  And I totally and completely agree with you.
[01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:13.580]  And because we're so selfish and so self-centered,
[01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:15.580]  all of us, we're very decadent in this society,
[01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:18.580]  people used to have to depend on each other so people had more empathy.
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:21.580]  They're able to get away with all this.
[01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:23.580]  And when your neighbor dies or you get sick, nobody cares
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:25.580]  because nobody cares about each other.
[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:27.580]  Our listeners care.
[01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:29.580]  That's what the globalists hate, our listeners, because you really do care.
[01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:31.580]  You're a major hope.
[01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:34.580]  You're one of the major focal points and bright spots to this audience.
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:35.580]  I'm not kissing your butt.
[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:36.580]  It's true.
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:42.580]  And so people are too self-centered and too lazy to go read the insurance actuaries.
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:46.580]  In fact, I have a stack of articles coming up next segment.
[01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:49.580]  There is just mass death in the actuaries.
[01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:50.580]  This is not debatable.
[01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:52.580]  These are hard statistics.
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:54.580]  And they're killing us.
[01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:55.580]  And it's only getting more insane.
[01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:57.580]  They're just normalizing it.
[01:41:57.580 --> 01:41:59.580]  And it's so sad, brother.
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:01.580]  Well, I've had it up to here, I'll tell you.
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:03.580]  So I don't know what the hell else to do anymore.
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:07.580]  So I'm trying to tell everybody I know, and they just don't want to hear it.
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:08.580]  They don't believe nothing.
[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:13.580]  So they're going to come ask of me what the hell is going on.
[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:15.580]  I'm not going to explain anything to them.
[01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:17.580]  All right, I'll explain.
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:18.580]  Hold on, let me say something.
[01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:21.580]  Sometimes you're in compartments of dumb people or asleep people,
[01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:24.580]  and they're not going to wake up right away, but later they will.
[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:25.580]  But go to a church.
[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:28.580]  Get involved in a conservative or nationalist organization.
[01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:30.580]  Get involved in a local gun club.
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:33.580]  You're going to find the people, and we need community, brother.
[01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:34.580]  So we need you.
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:35.580]  Don't get down, angry man.
[01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:37.580]  Things are a lot worse than they used to be,
[01:42:37.580 --> 01:42:40.580]  but we're also more aware of what was happening than we used to be.
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:43.580]  So it's rough, but God's still in control.
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:44.580]  Okay, brother?
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:47.580]  Well, thank you for everything you do, brother.
[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:48.580]  Thank you, brother.
[01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:49.580]  I really appreciate you.
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:50.580]  Thank you, angry man.
[01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:53.580]  All right, we'll try back with Bill, then Todd, Ian, Stu, and George.
[01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:54.580]  Stay with us.
[01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:55.580]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:42:59.580]  As the years go by,
[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:03.580]  it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:06.580]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress,
[01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:10.580]  you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids,
[01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:12.580]  vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:17.580]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:20.580]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation,
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:25.580]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:28.580]  and give your body the tools it needs to support your body.
[01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:30.580]  Using a proprietary process,
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:33.580]  we've managed to make this powerhouse formula into a delicious,
[01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:37.580]  concentrated drink mix that's loaded with high-quality ingredients.
[01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:40.580]  Perfect for a hot summer day or relaxing at home,

[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:46.580]  minerals, amino acids, and more.

[01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:02.580]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:04.580]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:08.580]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:10.580]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars,
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:13.580]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:17.580]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:19.580]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:22.580]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:24.580]  five, six, seven days a week,
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:26.580]  it's really just incredible.
[01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:28.580]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew,
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:30.580]  I thank you for your past support.
[01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:32.580]  I only encourage you now to realize that
[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:35.580]  InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:37.580]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us,
[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:38.580]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:42.580]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com
[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:45.580]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:47.580]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:49.580]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:51.580]  actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:55.580]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com,
[01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:56.580]  our funding problems will be over.
[01:44:56.580 --> 01:44:58.580]  Please take action now.
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:01.580]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil,
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:04.580]  which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:07.580]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil
[01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:09.580]  of this essential trace element,
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:13.580]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:16.580]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:19.580]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:24.580]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics
[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:28.580]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:32.580]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day,
[01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:38.580]  derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:44.580]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:50.580]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:53.580]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism,
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:57.580]  get yours now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:45:59.580]  With all the craziness in the world,
[01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:02.580]  the collapsing borders, the war with Russia,
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:06.580]  the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:08.580]  You are crazy, in my view,
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:12.580]  if you don't get high quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:14.580]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[01:46:14.580 --> 01:46:17.580]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:19.580]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:21.580]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns,
[01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:24.580]  but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:26.580]  This is something you need now.
[01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:30.580]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.

[01:46:57.310 --> 01:47:07.310]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:32.960]  Listen, I know it's rough to discover you're being covertly abused by a bunch of twit mad
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:41.280]  scientist jerks. They're mass murderers. They're, they're Joseph Mingela's idols. They make them
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:50.160]  the angel of death, look like a Boy Scout. Literally. And I mean, I know that's why people
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:55.679]  can't handle this show. Because I mean, I just showed you the last two weeks, the FDA, the CDC
[01:47:55.679 --> 01:48:04.880]  saying, here's all the vaccines that give you protein, allergies to beef, that can be violent,
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:10.320]  even kill you just like a bee sting. And then I showed you the WF and the UN saying, we'll just
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:16.080]  give people shots in 2012. They started talking about this to make you sick and make you unable
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:22.480]  to eat. And it's so illegal. It's so out of control. But the same people sterilize millions
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:30.799]  of poor blacks, whites and others in the 20s, 40s, 60s, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s. And it
[01:48:30.799 --> 01:48:38.639]  stopped last state was Washington State in the 1980s. The last cases of government sterilization
[01:48:38.639 --> 01:48:43.759]  of people that may like B minuses, but we're from single homes. They would take you and
[01:48:43.759 --> 01:48:49.519]  sterilize your ass, look it up. So you're like, how'd they get away with that? They just we're
[01:48:49.519 --> 01:48:52.719]  the bureaucrats, we're the health department, we're gonna do it. Hey, there's too many people,
[01:48:52.719 --> 01:48:55.679]  we're gonna give you a shot where you can't have kids, we're gonna give you a shot where you can't
[01:48:55.679 --> 01:49:03.440]  eat beef. And they're on a power trip, folks, they got the power, they're doing it. And people just
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:11.679]  can't deal with this. I send links to all these prominent people, a lot of times they respond,
[01:49:11.679 --> 01:49:18.480]  almost always they respond. But I sent one link to the number one podcaster in the world.
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:24.160]  We just had steaks, and I sent him my report, and he responds to everything I sent him,
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:27.440]  did respond to that. And I need to call him today. But the point is,
[01:49:28.639 --> 01:49:33.280]  because it just sounds too unbelievable. And if somebody addicted to red meat,
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:38.400]  like a Joe Rogan, I am too. I mean, it just doesn't even seem real.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:42.480]  It's like the government's gonna give you a shot where you are allergic to oxygen.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:47.920]  I mean, you know, big old juicy ribeye, folks is as good as you know, sex with your wife. And let's
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:52.719]  just get down to reality here. It's like telling you somebody's gonna chop your dick off. It's just
[01:49:52.719 --> 01:49:58.000]  as bad. I'm sorry to be vulgar here. But I mean, people just don't want to admit this is happening.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:03.840]  And look, I totally get it. You think I like this? They got like taking these people on constantly,
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:09.679]  but I cannot sit here and watch them crap all over. So that's what callers call it. Oh, we thank you,
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.200]  you're so great. You're so wonderful. I say stop it right there. I appreciate you tuning in. I
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:18.639]  appreciate you supporting. You understand we're all under attack. This is so preservation.
[01:50:18.639 --> 01:50:27.759]  This is not heroic. This is not extraordinary. It shouldn't be standing up to people bragging that
[01:50:27.759 --> 01:50:34.240]  they're putting protein in shots to where when your body has an autoimmune response to the COVID
[01:50:34.719 --> 01:50:40.719]  autoimmune response to the COVID or to the hepatitis or to the tetanus, your body also
[01:50:40.719 --> 01:50:46.080]  then has a response to the thing it's bound to. And now you're allergic to it.
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:53.759]  This is not rocket science. And they have turned us into these sick invalids with this crap.
[01:50:54.719 --> 01:51:00.000]  You know, I've had people in business, cheat me, rob me, scam me. But I can always try to make
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.280]  more money and fight the globalists. It's not my God, so I don't get that mad about it. But I know
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:07.040]  people in business that if somebody rips them off for $1,000, they almost have heart attacks.
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:10.799]  They take them to small claims court. They go crazy. They do all sorts of vindictive stuff.
[01:51:10.799 --> 01:51:13.759]  They call the IRS on people. I mean, it's just, it's all just petty.
[01:51:15.759 --> 01:51:20.160]  But when somebody steals your health and even your life, it becomes a crime.
[01:51:20.639 --> 01:51:23.440]  But when somebody steals your health and even your life,
[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:27.040]  if it's the medical system or the government, people go, well, that's just what they do.
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:40.000]  I'm so tired of it. So when I try to cheer up the last caller, I'm cheering myself up.
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:43.599]  But things have been bad for a while. We're just learning how bad they are now.
[01:51:44.559 --> 01:51:50.799]  And I have faith in humanity and faith in God. And it's a tall order, though, to go, man,
[01:51:50.799 --> 01:51:58.240]  they really are putting chemicals, protein crystals. They're obsessed with them. COVID's
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:03.120]  a protein crystal. Mad cow's a protein crystal. What causes it? HIV's a protein crystal.
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:09.200]  Figure this out yet. And because there's so many protein crystals already out there,
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:11.840]  they can hit you with this and it's hard to signature who did it.
[01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:14.480]  Because your body takes them and then changes them themselves.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:18.400]  Alzheimer's, neurological disorders, they're all off the chart. They're killing everybody.
[01:52:21.599 --> 01:52:25.840]  And that's why when the Democratic Party and the CIA and the Justice Department mess with me
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:29.840]  in Congress, the January 6th committee, and all of them really jack with me hard.
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:35.519]  I've talked to the lawyers, other people, and I've seen them do interviews and they admit,
[01:52:35.519 --> 01:52:40.160]  they go, this guy's crazy. We just can't break him. Nothing we do seems to do anything to him.
[01:52:42.799 --> 01:52:46.160]  Do you think suing me and trying to take money away from me and
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:51.120]  interrogating me and stupid depositions is anything compared to the fact that I know
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:55.360]  they're putting cancer viruses in most of the major vaccines and I showed you yesterday
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:53:01.440]  the FDA's website admitting it? I mean, I'm a thousand times more freaked out about that
[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:05.759]  than you messing with me. I'm freaked out that you're minions of the system and think you're
[01:53:05.759 --> 01:53:09.920]  an adversary with me and you're going to get a pat on the head by the power structure for trying
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:14.320]  to take me down when all I'm trying to do is save myself and you along with me. Because that's how
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:23.440]  the universe works. If I can't save you, I can't save myself. This is survival instinct. That's why
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:28.320]  on Patrick bet David, I said, I love my enemies. The ones that don't know what they're doing.
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:33.679]  Like Christ said before I gave up the ghost, he said, forgive them father for they know not what
[01:53:33.679 --> 01:53:41.280]  they do. And I'm not Christ. I'm far from Christ, but I follow Christ. And I understand what Christ
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:45.440]  was saying. There's just, he could see how they were destroying themselves. They were hurting
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:50.559]  themselves and how sad they were and how captured by evil. And he said, forgive them father,
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:56.000]  where they know not what they do. And that's what God wanted from his own son to say that
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.840]  and say, okay, I will now forgive them and wash them in your blood.
[01:54:00.799 --> 01:54:04.960]  Because you asked for it in your dying breath. And he gave up the ghost
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:13.599]  and things are going to get worse and worse and worse. And the people that serve the system
[01:54:13.599 --> 01:54:21.120]  are going to get more vehement, more aggressive, more hysterical, believing that I've used this
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:28.000]  analogy. We'll go back to your calls. And then we got a special guest. I, I knew a couple people
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:33.840]  in business. And then one cousin who was a pretty smart person, but there's an old saying,
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:38.799]  you can't con an honest man, but, but people that want to believe in delusions, you can con them.
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:46.400]  This was really bad in the mid nineties up until about 2000. It was the Nigerian email scam.
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:54.080]  Remember that? And the Nigerians had a scam where they would email you and say,
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:55:01.120]  Prince Abubu Mashaka, the crown Prince of Abubu Mahuka, literally like stuff like that.
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:09.200]  He has picked you and decided to give you an incredible investment because we've done an
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:15.200]  analysis. You're the person, but he cannot get his $5 million out of the bank and give you 500,000
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:21.440]  of it unless you send him $5,000. And you send out a million emails. You get a couple thousand
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:27.759]  people that do it. I knew a talk show host on GCN who was a young guy, pretty popular, having a
[01:55:27.759 --> 01:55:33.920]  good effect and a good show. And Nigerians emailed him and said, we have got a major investment for
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:38.639]  your radio show. So he started trying to raise money on air. They wanted like a hundred thousand
[01:55:38.639 --> 01:55:42.559]  dollars. And then we're going to give him like whatever millions it was. I forget the exact
[01:55:42.559 --> 01:55:47.200]  numbers. And he raised the money, gave it to him. And when they screwed him, I call into the show
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:51.040]  and I said, Hey man, that's a scam, bro. You're not going to get more money. And they're going to,
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:55.280]  once they know you've given some money, you don't want to admit your scam. So you give more money.
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:59.519]  And some people, they would get five or six payments from each one bigger, but the crown
[01:55:59.519 --> 01:56:06.000]  Prince will give you more this time. They're like, I can't not give them 200,000 because Prince
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  Abubu is going to give me a hundred million. And that's what people are like to serve the
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:21.200]  new world order. They just can't admit they've been conned. They can't admit they've been scammed
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:25.840]  and they just, they stay in it and they get deeper in it. At least you're not in it. At least,
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:31.920]  you know, it's out of control. At least, you know, situation's very serious. At least, you know
[01:56:32.879 --> 01:56:36.960]  that you're under attack. These people don't even know it. They think they're serving it
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:44.000]  and getting power with a group of mad scientists, putting HIV and
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:50.240]  cancer viruses and beef protein in the damn shots to just cause havoc.
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:57.599]  You got to be delusional as hell. Take cheesy cartoon in the eighties, He-Man.
[01:56:59.519 --> 01:57:03.280]  And in some of the episodes I watched when I was a kid, some, you know, they get some town
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:07.440]  villager to sell out the Skeletor to be a spy. And then always Skeletor kills him or enslaves
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:11.200]  him in the end. I mean, there was a dude like Skeletor in a dark mountain and he was evil.
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:15.599]  Would you go to him and say, I want to serve you, Skeletor? I mean, you know, Skeletor is
[01:57:15.599 --> 01:57:20.240]  going to screw you over in the end. Right? Well, that's a kid's cartoon, folks. Like
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:24.400]  Emperor Palpatine wants to work with you. You're going to go sign on with Emperor Palpatine because
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:29.440]  it makes you feel powerful. You're a chump. You're a schmuck. You're a fool. You're an idiot.
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:34.879]  Oh, geez. Skeletor, will you be my friend? Sure, I'll be your friend. And just give me
[01:57:34.879 --> 01:57:39.920]  the keys to the drawbridge and I will. Skeletor, what's my reward? Your reward
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:45.200]  is eternal enslavement. Hour number three, straight ahead. Infowars.com.

[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:56.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:58.799 --> 02:00:04.400]  When castles towered over vast landscapes and knights championed honor and valor,
[02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:11.040]  there came an unforeseen darkness. Amidst this impending doom stood a knight called Alex Jones,
[02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:17.040]  a brave and outspoken herald known as the Truth Sayer. Sir Alex Jones was not alone. In his most
[02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:22.879]  desperate hour in the battle against evil, a radiant light descended from the heavens. God,
[02:00:22.879 --> 02:00:29.040]  in all his glory and his legion of angels, stood by Alex's side. The battle raged on, but with every
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:35.440]  blow, Alex Jones' conviction grew stronger. With every truth he proclaimed, the demonic forces
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:41.599]  faltered. When the enemy was vanquished, Alex Jones swore a solemn oath that should the realm
[02:00:41.599 --> 02:00:48.879]  need him again, he would return. And now it's Alex Jones leading a full frontal assault on the
[02:00:48.879 --> 02:00:55.519]  satanic New World Order. Tune in at infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.

[02:01:42.719 --> 02:01:48.080]  about some of the huge developments taking place in the world. January 6th is Jack Smith. Some of
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:53.200]  the big announcements Mike Lindell's got. I want to thank listeners for buying American and doing
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:59.440]  the smart thing. We got a big response when Mike came on two weeks ago. They're trying to bankrupt
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:02.960]  my pillow. They're trying to bankrupt us. And if you don't stand with us, we can't stand. And I'm
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:07.920]  not complaining. I'm just saying we're we're we're made in America. He's made America. We're fighting
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:12.719]  hard. My pillow dot com promo code Alex to get some of the biggest discounts. And they've got
[02:02:12.719 --> 02:02:18.080]  gigantic sales running right now. So we're going to do an infomercial, but we're going to spend a
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:25.519]  few minutes on how you can support the work of Mike Lindell. If more business owners didn't join
[02:02:25.519 --> 02:02:30.160]  the political correct operation or didn't stay neutral but fought for America, we would save
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:34.320]  this country. That's why they've targeted Mike Lindell to make an example of him. They've
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:39.760]  targeted Tucker Carlson. They've targeted Donald Trump. They've targeted everybody else so that you
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:44.879]  get intimidated and you don't stick your head up. Well, we're going to lose everything if we don't
[02:02:44.879 --> 02:02:52.400]  stick our heads up. So whether it's incredible sheets or incredible comforters or incredible

[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:14.879]  higher quality. And of course, he got banned out of Walmart and Bed Bath and Beyond, everywhere else
[02:03:14.879 --> 02:03:20.799]  when he dared to challenge the illegitimate election of that idiot, pervert, moron,
[02:03:21.519 --> 02:03:27.920]  gibbering fool, Joe Biden. So we love Mike Lindell. We appreciate him. But it was like a punch in the
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:32.160]  stomach three weeks ago when I saw the news headlines. Mike Lindell borrows 10 million
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:36.960]  dollars to keep his employees employed. We don't want this thing going under. And if a lot of us

[02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:07.920]  diet. They can be found in grass fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:13.760]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega threes.
[02:05:14.559 --> 02:05:18.719]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:23.200]  All right. We really appreciate one of the hardest working men to
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:25.920]  employ Americans and fight tyranny at the same time. The great
[02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:34.639]  purveyor of the MyPillow empire is Mike Lindell. And to cover the waterfront,
[02:06:34.639 --> 02:06:39.440]  what's currently happening in America and the big event he has coming up here in just a few days is
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:42.799]  the one, the only Mike Lindell. Mike, good to see your face.
[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:48.639]  Oh, thanks for having me on, Alex. Well, you've got a lot to cover and a lot happening. Give us
[02:06:48.639 --> 02:06:53.599]  your take on the latest political developments. Jack Smith, January 6th, the Capitol head police
[02:06:53.599 --> 02:06:58.080]  officer saying Pelosi orchestrated it. I mean, things are really falling apart for the system
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:05.760]  right now. Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, to be honest, all the stuff that's going on right
[02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:11.519]  now there for me has just been a huge distraction because of the event I have coming up. It's going
[02:07:11.519 --> 02:07:16.480]  to we're going to announce the plan that will secure our elections immediately. Remember,
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:22.639]  everybody, if we can't have secure elections, all this stuff that's going on is is just
[02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:30.400]  destroying our country. And and so I'm very you know, I'm very these things that are going on
[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:36.320]  should be driving people to watch this event because this event will secure our elections
[02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:40.480]  and everybody's going to embrace it. That's one thing that has never been done before. This plan
[02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:47.599]  has never been done before in history and it's never been even talked about. So it's not melt
[02:07:47.599 --> 02:07:52.639]  down the machines because I've already talked about that. So it's going to be it's going to
[02:07:52.639 --> 02:07:57.040]  be pretty amazing. Well, you wouldn't even tell me on the phone a few weeks ago. Give us a hint,
[02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:01.040]  though, because I know you got big stuff going on. Others scared of you. I will tell you this.
[02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:07.519]  I went to you know, it's like using a pillow, Alex, if I you know, you use my products and I
[02:08:07.519 --> 02:08:12.480]  give the hosts all the products to use because then you're telling it from the heart. And so
[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:18.160]  what I did is I went out to turning point. I went out there and I met with Charlie Kirk and those
[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:23.040]  guys and said, here, here's a plan to secure elections. And I told him the plan. I spent six
[02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:29.440]  hours there and they go, wow, you know, this is the most amazing plan because it works. We don't
[02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:35.440]  have to rely on legislatures. We don't have to rely on judges. It's just us, the people. And
[02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:42.240]  it's very if we did say the plan, it would the media would get out in front of it and destroy it.
[02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:48.400]  And Alex, I kind of compared to this the way our country is. It goes back to Al Capone. I said it
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:54.719]  before in the 1920s where they couldn't get him on murder, bootlegging, gambling, racketeering
[02:08:54.719 --> 02:08:59.760]  because he had the judges in his pocket, the law enforcement in his pocket, the media in his
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:05.840]  pocket, the politicians in his pocket. That's right. And the people in Chicago felt hopeless.
[02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:10.240]  So they went and came at him from a different angle. They got him on tax evasion. He ended up
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:16.160]  in Alcatraz. Well, right now, it seems hopeless to a lot of people in our country because these
[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:21.200]  things keep happening, this nonsensical things that are going on, this living in this twilight
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:27.599]  zone, this end times of spiritual warfare, good and evil. Well, and we're in those same things
[02:09:27.599 --> 02:09:31.760]  where we've worked so hard for two and a half years, hundreds of thousands of people on the
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:37.679]  ground trying to get, you know, you go in and you do lawsuits and you do this and you go and you get
[02:09:37.679 --> 02:09:43.200]  pushed back even by our own party. Well, you know what? Last year I had in prayer, I said,
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:47.200]  you know, I feel it was right from God going, you know what? You've got to come at it from a
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:53.200]  different angle. And that's what this plan is. But we're going to do two things. This coming,
[02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:58.879]  it's only five days away or six days away now. Next Wednesday, August 16th, we're going to have
[02:09:58.879 --> 02:10:03.760]  a whole day where every state's going to go up there and tell them about the hope that's going
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:08.639]  on in their state. There is hope in every state. You just don't hear about it, everybody. And we're
[02:10:08.639 --> 02:10:15.440]  going to do that. And then Lou Dobbs has agreed to do an address to the nation. He has not done
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:23.840]  a single event or anything since Fox got rid of him on February 5th, 2021. So when I talked to him,
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:28.160]  he said, Mike, I said, Lou, could you could you do this? He goes, absolutely. It's to save our
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:32.799]  country. Then he said, I said, well, I'll pay whatever you need. He goes and he goes, Mike,
[02:10:32.799 --> 02:10:36.559]  I don't want anything. I want to help save our country. And I said, well, that's good because
[02:10:36.559 --> 02:10:43.440]  I'm out of money. And anyway, so we have that first day. Then the next day, everybody,
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:51.360]  it goes 9 a.m. on the 17th to 9 p.m. on the 17th. And we are going to show you the plan.
[02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:57.440]  And this plan will take probably a couple of hours to go through it. That will start around noon.
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:04.160]  And what's going to happen is then we're going to show you what the plan, how to execute it all.
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:10.719]  And you right away in the morning of August 18th, everybody will be going. You'll have relief. You'll
[02:11:10.719 --> 02:11:16.160]  have hope. You'll have you know, that's what we've lacked. We've lacked hope and a plan because
[02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:22.000]  everything seems so overwhelming when they keep hearing about these things. You know, all these
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:26.400]  just things that 20 years ago we would have thought, come on, this would be a fairy tale.
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:31.920]  This would be science fiction. It's the things that are going on right now. So I'm very excited.
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:38.559]  And everybody, you can check out LyndaleEvent.com. You go there, get signed up. It's a free live

[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:50.960]  asking me, well, how can we help out the event, which we can use and the plan. You can go to
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:59.280]  LyndaleLegalFund.org, LyndaleLegalFund.org. People keep asking me that. How can we help this plan and
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:04.480]  how can we help everything you're doing? And either website, the LyndaleEvent.com or
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:11.679]  LyndaleLegalFund.org. And let's get to the bottom line here. We're ragtag
[02:12:11.679 --> 02:12:16.000]  organizations and groups. We're beating the globalists just barely. The left always calls
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.519]  us grifters because you have thousands of employees and you're a self-made man. And
[02:12:19.519 --> 02:12:23.040]  I'm a popular talk show host that funds ourselves. We're not funded by big money
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:26.879]  globalist sorrows. We're funded by the listeners. If they want us to fight a fight,
[02:12:26.879 --> 02:12:31.200]  they got to support. I'm not complaining. It's really up to them. But now is the thick of the
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:34.639]  fight. This coming up election, everybody always says this election is the most important.
[02:12:34.639 --> 02:12:39.519]  I know everyone in their heart knows that's not hype. This is the most important election
[02:12:39.519 --> 02:12:45.840]  since 1776, which was not an election. It was the kickoff of a civil war and a battle for
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:51.840]  independence. So this is such a historic moment. The enemy's mask is off. Their whole operations
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:57.360]  out in the open. And now is the time for maximum political effort, maximum financial support and
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:04.080]  maximum prayer. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. We can use all the help we can get because,
[02:13:04.639 --> 02:13:10.879]  you know, I'll tell you what, you know, Alex, one thing about me, if they say I'm a grifter,
[02:13:10.879 --> 02:13:16.400]  I got to be the worst grifter in the history of the planet because I've never asked for anything
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:21.200]  from anyone until just recently, because we quite frankly, if we don't have the resources,
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:26.639]  this plan doesn't get to the point. I mean, let's say you took on the voting machine companies,
[02:13:26.639 --> 02:13:30.960]  you took on the deep state, you took on the CIA, and they're coming at you with everything they
[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:35.200]  got. But you're persevering. What do people expect? They can't put soldiers in the field
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:39.679]  without support. I know they are supporting. Great job. I'm just saying this is on, folks.
[02:13:39.679 --> 02:13:45.040]  We're in the thick of the fight right now. Absolutely. Yeah. And that's why everything
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:51.120]  you guys buy from MyPillow.com, everything you do there, this is supporting not only all the
[02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:55.519]  families that work there, I have over 1,500 employees there. This is an employee-owned
[02:13:55.519 --> 02:14:02.879]  company that was sued by these machine companies that attacked them for like, I mean, sued for
[02:14:02.879 --> 02:14:09.040]  like $8 billion with a B. For what? Did I execute my First Amendment right of free speech? So
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:13.760]  everything you're buying using that promo code Alex, you guys, we have, this is our 20-year
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:19.040]  anniversary, too. Our 20-year anniversary where all my employees, if you see that first square
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:24.719]  there, if you scroll down a little bit, we made these anniversary, these limited edition MyPillows
[02:14:24.719 --> 02:14:29.920]  for $19.98 you can get them for. Right there they are. We made that commercial, all my employees
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:37.599]  there. And this is a queen-size MyPillow for $19.98 and a king-size $29.98 using the promo
[02:14:37.599 --> 02:14:42.559]  code Alex. But we have new products, too. We have our dish towels that actually dry dishes. What a
[02:14:42.559 --> 02:14:50.000]  concept. But we have over 200 products and people don't realize that MyPillow has all these
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:53.599]  products. We have sleepwear. Well, Mike, let's do this. Mike, let's do this because there's such
[02:14:53.599 --> 02:14:58.559]  quality products that keeps you on the air and me on the air. They put these big billion-dollar
[02:14:58.559 --> 02:15:02.080]  numbers out, even though we'll win on appeal, even in rigged courts, to make everybody feel
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:08.160]  like it's over. We're defeated. We're annihilated. And when they did those rigged cases on me,
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:12.000]  people thought it was really over. Now they see that was a sign-off. It's not. Now they're supporting.
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:15.679]  So spend a few minutes before we get into politics and the world and what you think is going to
[02:15:15.679 --> 02:15:18.639]  happen in President Trump, because I want to pick your brain on that. I know you're focused
[02:15:18.639 --> 02:15:22.000]  on the big event. We'll plug that as well. But spend three, four minutes here. I'm going to
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:26.719]  shut up and let you talk, telling us about these great products and then also your other big shop,
[02:15:26.719 --> 02:15:30.639]  which has all these thousands of entrepreneurs, and they're made-in-America products. I mean,
[02:15:30.639 --> 02:15:34.639]  this is what it's about. Instead of just boycotting Anheuser-Busch, which is great,
[02:15:34.639 --> 02:15:39.200]  how about we boycott? What could we do? They lost $40 billion in stock. What would happen
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:44.240]  if we had $40 billion? It'd be game over. I like that boycott. You've just seen the
[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:50.480]  sandals went by, everybody. These were $60 sandals. They're a close-out special for the summer,
[02:15:51.679 --> 02:15:58.559]  $19. And then we have our beds. People forget we have beds, the best beds ever. I sat and
[02:15:58.559 --> 02:16:04.240]  reverse-engineered on what a bed should be. These are the MyPillow beds with the mattresses. There's
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:12.000]  nothing like them. It's different coil and foam, different combinations. As I reverse-engineered,
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.160]  there you got our hand towels. Now, blankets, people don't realize that we have all these
[02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:23.360]  blankets, quilts, sleepwear. We have all these different things, comforters. We have
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:27.280]  everything for the bathroom, everything for the bedroom. We have couch pillows,
[02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:33.039]  actually couch pillows that you actually can lay on your couch instead of just for decoration.
[02:16:33.039 --> 02:16:38.160]  There you have the pet blankets, the pet blankets, but there's so many more products.
[02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:43.200]  And people see me all the time, Mike, I want to support you, but I bought all your product.
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:47.520]  You know what? You need to take another look because every one of them we have put on sale
[02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:53.520]  for our 20-year anniversary using promo code Alex, you guys. And then, like Alex said,
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:17:00.400]  there's another sister website you can use promo code Alex. It's called mystore.com, everybody.
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:04.720]  I built this. It took millions of dollars to build a couple of years ago,
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:10.800]  built this platform. And what it is, it's a website for entrepreneurs, USA entrepreneurs
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:17.039]  and USA product. You go there and one of the products is my coffee, the best coffee you're
[02:17:17.039 --> 02:17:22.160]  ever going to drink in your life. Okay, there it is. This is our new my store. My store,
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:28.080]  there's the coffee. You save 50%. There's nothing better than my coffee. This was an
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:33.279]  entrepreneur company in Florida and they came to me and I said, you know what? I said, listen,
[02:17:33.279 --> 02:17:38.400]  I'm going to take those in-house here. There's a my store gummies, ashwagandha. I don't know how
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:45.520]  to say it in my vitamin, but we have, and there's the one. Yeah, ashwagandha. Yeah. But if you
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:51.200]  scroll, if you scroll down, we have thousands of products there on my store. These entrepreneurs,
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:56.720]  it's a safe place for them where their products don't get copied by China. They don't get copied
[02:17:56.720 --> 02:18:04.320]  over on Amazon or on Google or over it. And on Facebook, you put up ads and they see, oh,
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:08.080]  there's a good product. I'm going to go copy it. And they don't get lost in the shuffle.
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:14.720]  This is a platform for them. These are all USA made product and all USA entrepreneurs. And they
[02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:20.880]  thank everybody out there for having a platform and for you guys all taking advantage of these
[02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:26.080]  great prices and, uh, on all of their products because they need help. They need, you know,
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:31.279]  they need help too. My store.com forward slash Alex or promo code Alex get even bigger discounts.
[02:18:31.279 --> 02:18:35.680]  Well, I just admire you because you're a cheerful warrior. You go on all these late night shows,
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:40.400]  comedy shows, they attack you. Everybody says you win. Uh, I mean, it's just, you really rise
[02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:44.480]  the occasion because you're pretty good on my show, but you're amazing under pressure,
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:48.160]  better job than even I think Trump does sometimes. And I'm serious when I say that,
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:52.320]  what happens when you're on Jimmy Kimmel, these other shows and they're attacking you viciously
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:57.039]  and you just laugh and win the crowd over. They start sharing for you. I mean, you do something
[02:18:57.039 --> 02:19:02.800]  I've seen nobody else do. Well, you know what, this is all we've had. You guys realize when this
[02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:08.720]  started, we lost the conservative me. We lost Fox news, Newsmax, Salem media. They're not going to
[02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:13.920]  report about the, anything with our elections or the vaccines or anything like that. They got a
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:19.840]  whole listing from, you cannot talk about this. So they went silent on us. Now the left media,
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:24.720]  the media on the left, like you're Jimmy Kimmel's. I go, you know what, if I got to go sit in a claw
[02:19:24.720 --> 02:19:29.680]  machine to get the word out, I'm going to do it. And you know, what's easy for me, Alex is
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:34.720]  the truth. They'll set you free. I don't have to be, I don't have a PR person that says,
[02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:41.039]  or, or a PR controller. And, um, yeah, here he is there. I'm in a claw machine there. If you got
[02:19:41.119 --> 02:19:47.279]  the, uh, and it helped get the word out. And it was, uh, it was amazing. And the, uh, and this
[02:19:47.279 --> 02:19:53.119]  is what I have to do because you know, I don't know the questions that he hit. I love, I want
[02:19:53.119 --> 02:19:56.480]  to go back on this for a second, interrupt you. I love how they thought it would make you look
[02:19:56.480 --> 02:20:00.400]  stupid, but even mainline media said it made you look great. How cheerful you were. It made them
[02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:05.279]  look like clowns that they made you get in a claw machine, but you still get it because you knew you
[02:20:05.279 --> 02:20:10.320]  weren't the clown. They were the clowns. Yeah. Well, and plus I don't care what I got to do.
[02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:14.880]  I got to get the word out. We have to fix our election platforms. I guess, you know, if it,
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:19.600]  whatever it takes, I, it doesn't matter to me what you get the world, the people, the public's
[02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:24.080]  onto this. Now they realize that when they'll let, when the media over there, the fake news attacking
[02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:29.360]  is usually the exact opposite. And if you're able to, if they're able to read between the lines
[02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:33.840]  and that's what, you know, that's, what's worked for me to be able to get the word out for over
[02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:38.240]  two years now, just like, um, here's another thing, Alex, you know, you look at things,
[02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:42.400]  it's just, uh, it's the opposite of what it is. You talk about our great real president,
[02:20:42.400 --> 02:20:46.720]  Donald Trump, when he got, uh, what number third indictment or whatever.
[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:53.279]  Um, I've said it before. And I said, you know, I said the, your, uh, actually I told him that I
[02:20:53.279 --> 02:20:58.800]  said, you know, you keep getting indicted and your polls keep going up. I said, they're doing
[02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:04.160]  these attacks and every time they do his polls go up. And I said, you know, pretty soon you'll
[02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:10.560]  have more votes than there are people because of course, of course the media attacked me.
[02:21:10.560 --> 02:21:14.320]  Mike Lindell says, Donald Trump's going to get more votes than there are people in the United
[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:19.279]  States. Hey, Pennsylvania does it all the time. They have more votes than voters in their election.
[02:21:19.279 --> 02:21:25.920]  But, but my point being is the more they attack, the more people realize that this is the bucket
[02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:32.080]  of common sense. And as long as we don't give up, we had a six year war with the British empire,
[02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:37.600]  never defeated before, not by the pulley and not by anybody. And because of perseverance,
[02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:41.840]  Washington lost all the battles for the last year. But he persevered since you mentioned this,
[02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:46.400]  the full video is on info wars.com, but it's incredible. They tried to get a group of voters
[02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:51.520]  together and they said the election was stolen. The indictments are a fraud. None of them bought
[02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:56.960]  it. Here's a short clip and family around the table. Don't watch and don't trust CNN.
[02:21:57.680 --> 02:22:04.800]  There is reverence for, but listen, the trust is God. Reagan's optimism replaced by Trump's
[02:22:04.800 --> 02:22:09.920]  grievances. We got to find our own way to take care of ourselves. Reagan's disdain of big
[02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:16.320]  government replaced by Trump's distrust of just about everything. I think he thinks he was stolen
[02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:21.520]  from him. Still questions about the 2020 election. And I had a lot of people who agree with him.
[02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:26.480]  Criticism of the Trump prosecutions, but nothing about that deal is the American way.
[02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:32.720]  I don't think. And this, if you think the United States should be
[02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:37.520]  supporting Ukraine in the fight against Putin, raise your hand.
[02:22:41.279 --> 02:22:43.840]  Nobody. You don't have to be that smart to put the
[02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:49.680]  connect the dots, right? And so is the war to cover up
[02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:56.400]  sins committed so you can cover your tracks? There's too much money that's been thrown over
[02:22:56.400 --> 02:23:02.240]  there. You think all the NATO countries would do what Biden told them to do because he's trying
[02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:09.520]  to cover up some Hunter Biden business deal by, um, it all depends on how, uh, so let's see how
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:17.119]  much dirt he has on Biden to keep the money coming. That's, that's, that's out there.
[02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:24.320]  Well, how, how do you, how do you trust when you know the government has shut down Facebook
[02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:29.439]  and shut down Twitter and told them to not show certain, certain news stories?
[02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:32.960]  A few days here makes clear. Trump's grip is very strong.
[02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:38.400]  CNN has like 200,000 viewers. They're a joke. Mike Lindell.
[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:46.240]  Absolutely. And, uh, you know, the, uh, that's the way things are right now that
[02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:50.000]  with the people, everybody's pouring into this bucket of common sense.
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:54.240]  The more things are out there that don't make sense and go, what is this going on over here?
[02:23:54.240 --> 02:23:58.960]  What is this? They're jumping in this bucket from both sides. Alex, I want to tell you,
[02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:04.960]  this, this, this just happened two days ago. You know, the 16 that were charged in Michigan
[02:24:04.960 --> 02:24:08.960]  for, uh, because they stood up with their own electors or whatever and
[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:13.439]  at the Pernam and so on. Well, my Sean, I forget what her last name is.
[02:24:13.439 --> 02:24:19.760]  She was going to come to my event this week and, uh, and she was invited and she's come before.
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:27.920]  And the attorney general, Dana Nestle of Michigan told her, if you leave, you're going to get
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:32.960]  arrested. I'm you're not going to Mike Lindell's advance. It would be the equivalent. If you got
[02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:39.760]  a DWI and you went to a wine tasting event. I mean, how can you tell people where to go?
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:45.760]  Election meddling, total election meddling, just like now they have these three,
[02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:49.360]  four indictments to pin Trump down during the election. Everybody sees through it.
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:57.119]  Yeah, absolutely. We see through it. The public sees through it. Any other time in history,
[02:24:57.119 --> 02:25:03.039]  if you have some stuff like these going on, uh, they, uh, the media would win when you're
[02:25:03.039 --> 02:25:06.800]  destroying Michael and Joe's an election, blah, blah, blah. I would probably have been destroyed
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:12.640]  right out of the gate, but the people see through all these lies. They see through the media. They
[02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:16.880]  even see through the only ones that are really blinded are the ones that are sitting over there,
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:21.760]  watching Fox and Newsmax because they don't know what's really going on because they're, because
[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:28.880]  they're, it's one thing to not talk about. We have media outlets. We, uh, we chose to see, uh,
[02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:33.760]  you know, to watch and trust that they would at least give us the news of an oncoming storm.
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:39.840]  And they're not doing that. It's all deflection. All these things going on is just a big deflection
[02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:44.000]  and a big distraction. They want you. Hey, everybody look over here. Look over here.
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:49.600]  Why they're destroying our country. That's why it's so important. We fix our election platforms
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:54.960]  immediately. Who do you want running our country? Everybody do you want in this age? We're in with
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:26:00.320]  artificial intelligence and everything coming. Do you want people that we really elect making the
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:05.600]  rules or do you want people that are selected making the rules? This is what we're at. We're,
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:12.160]  we're at an apex in history. This is biblical. This is a spiritual battle of epic proportions.
[02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:16.800]  And you know what? We are winning. God wins in the end. We're going to look back someday,
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:20.800]  like I said, everybody, and you're going to see all these bad things you see happening.
[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:25.760]  And then you pull out one of the bad, maybe we don't get to this great place. Remember God uses
[02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:30.400]  all things for good. And all these things going on, you got to look at it from another way going,
[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:34.960]  Hey, it's getting more and more people to this. That's right there. The enemy is being revealed
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:38.640]  and it's painful to see how bad it is, but the enemy is being revealed. And that is a big deal.
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:43.039]  And you're absolutely right. Our problem is not MSNBC and CNN with our small audiences
[02:26:43.039 --> 02:26:47.200]  and brainwash people. It's the mainline conservative so-called outlets that are
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:50.080]  suppressing what's really going on and keeping control of conservatives.
[02:26:51.039 --> 02:26:55.760]  Yep, absolutely. That's it, everybody. You're not hearing the news out there,
[02:26:55.760 --> 02:27:00.400]  but the good news is Alex is like your show and many other things. Remember,
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:09.119]  they tried to take us out forever on January 7th and 8th and 2021. That's the day they tried to
[02:27:09.119 --> 02:27:14.640]  take our voice forever. 1.2 million Americans got deplatformed. Everybody that was speaking up,
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:19.920]  you got deplatformed on Vimeo, YouTube, Sucker Bucks, Facebook, Twitter, all these places.
[02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:21.760]  We got attacked by our hijacked government.
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:30.400]  Oh, and they, and they, uh, got shut down two days later. But you know what? They didn't win
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:36.080]  because our voice, maybe it was real small then, but it expanded. And now we have, we have all
[02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:41.119]  these different social media platforms. Now we have podcasts that people are getting their news
[02:27:41.119 --> 02:27:46.880]  and information from other sources, other than the propaganda that we've been feeding us for
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:51.600]  decades. That's right. We're out of time. Come back again soon. I want to go to your event.
[02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:55.119]  I'm looking at today. If I don't make it, I'm going to be covering it live here.
[02:27:55.119 --> 02:27:58.720]  In closing, how do people find the event? How do they share the event?

[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:41.439]  probably going to come. I just, I just, I feel like I have to. Thank you so much. And we'll,
[02:28:41.439 --> 02:28:46.000]  I'm going to try to call you if you can talk to this afternoon. Okay. All right. We've got it.

[02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:08.560]  the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy. You are crazy in my view,

[02:30:13.520 --> 02:30:16.800]  selling guns and ammo. That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you
[02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:21.760]  haven't. And I'm preaching the choir on that. But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't
[02:30:21.760 --> 02:30:26.640]  have enough storable food or water filtration. This is something you need now. And we've got it

[02:32:27.200 --> 02:32:31.360]  But these really are amazing products. The big July 4th sale's going on right now. This is such
[02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:34.560]  a critical platform in the fight against the new world order. The enemies out in the open
[02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:38.640]  were vindicated. People are listening more than ever. But in this major recession, going into
[02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:43.439]  depression, and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard. I know times are tough. So
[02:32:43.439 --> 02:32:47.360]  thank you for your support. But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles
[02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:51.600]  and the videos. That you can do for free. And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[02:32:51.600 --> 02:32:55.439]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now. And I thank you from
[02:32:55.439 --> 02:33:01.760]  the bottom of my heart. God bless you. Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[02:33:01.760 --> 02:33:04.960]  of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:15.039]  All of us see the sunset, or beautiful snow-covered mountains, or shooting stars, or little fish in a
[02:33:15.039 --> 02:33:20.160]  pool, or beautiful jungle plants, or a cute little baby, you know, in its mother's arms.
[02:33:20.880 --> 02:33:26.880]  And you recognize goodness. You recognize wholesomeness. You recognize things God
[02:33:26.880 --> 02:33:32.080]  made that we communally share in God's creation. And we worship our Heavenly Father,
[02:33:33.039 --> 02:33:38.640]  who's given us the system of Genesis that is our mother. But it is God, the Godhead,
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:46.000]  the male energy of will, and building, and striving. I'm just high on creation, man.
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:59.840]  I can't handle how alive I am right now in the fight against these tyrants,
[02:34:01.119 --> 02:34:05.039]  and how hard I'm going to push to go after them, because I'm so full of life,
[02:34:05.039 --> 02:34:10.240]  and so full of resistance to these murdering pedophiles who want to get in the way of God's plan.
[02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:20.400]  But I tell you, anybody who tries to get in the way of the incredible plan the big guy's
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:24.400]  got for us has got me kicked, and I'm just begging to stay on the team, man.
[02:34:29.279 --> 02:34:33.439]  Just put me in the game, coach. Whatever you say, coach. I know I'm weak. I know I'm pathetic.
[02:34:33.439 --> 02:34:37.360]  Man, you're amazing. I'm so lucky, baby. What do I do, boss? What do I do?
[02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:41.920]  I'm like a hunting dog, man. Just take me out of the house. Just turn me on them.
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:44.800]  Just tell me what I got to do. Tell me why. Tell me how I serve you.
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:46.400]  Tell me what I can do for you right now.
[02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:55.760]  All right. Thanks for holding callers while Mike Liddell was on for a half hour. Let's
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:35:00.640]  go to your calls. The order to receive right now. First, Bill in North Carolina
[02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:04.560]  tried to get on, but he had a windy phone, so he got in the cab of his truck.
[02:35:05.279 --> 02:35:10.800]  New regulations on trucks destroy 18-wheelers, which 80% of our deliveries are made by.
[02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:12.400]  Bill, tell us about this. Thanks for holding.
[02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:20.960]  Yeah. Well, ever since, was it year 2000 or 1998, they put in this system called
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:30.880]  diesel exhaust fluid system. I just want to let callers know these new engines,
[02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:36.720]  they don't last but 500,000 miles. On the older engines, they would last a million miles
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:42.800]  if you could rebuild them. What that diesel exhaust fluid does, it eats through the engine.
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:51.520]  What they're going to start doing, that they're going to cause truck drivers to start burning
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:57.920]  more of it with the newer trucks coming out. What that's going to do, it's going to affect
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:04.640]  the supply chain. Already, these big trucking companies, in order to keep their stuff going,
[02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:12.960]  they have to have two trucks per driver, okay? Because if his truck is broken down,
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:19.279]  they can put him in a truck and get him moving. In the days in which you would just have one
[02:36:19.279 --> 02:36:25.279]  truck per driver, now they have to have two. One's a backup. It's only going to get worse.
[02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:31.039]  That's all I was calling in about, Alex. I think people need to-
[02:36:31.039 --> 02:36:34.880]  Yeah, they're doing everything they can, not for the environment, but to shut our industry down
[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:40.800]  and to force humans with the lawsuits and the cost out of trucks and make it go to robots.
[02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:47.840]  Yep. Yep. Then the other thing is, it's my understanding that the exhaust that's coming
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:58.960]  out of the pipe, because you're burning this urea along with the diesel, it actually forms
[02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:06.240]  the gas cyanide that comes out the pipe. That's why over in California, it was killing off the
[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:11.520]  vegetation that was right alongside the road. I don't think people realize what these things
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:16.240]  are doing. It's much worse than what the old trucks were putting out.
[02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:23.680]  Just like they made them do all sorts of weird gas additives the last 30 years that
[02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:27.520]  bend our genders. Yeah, they know exactly what they're doing. They turn industry into
[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:31.840]  a weapon against us. Tell us the world's ending while they're ending the world as we know it.
[02:37:33.039 --> 02:37:39.600]  Yep. Then on top of it, they have us on what they call ELDs, electronic logging devices,
[02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:45.279]  and they claim that they're for safety. Well, if you take a look at the statistics,
[02:37:45.279 --> 02:37:52.400]  and you can even look it up, or even contact the OOIDA, which is the Owner Operator Independent
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:59.520]  Drivers Association. They will show you that the statistics, ever since they put the ELDs in,
[02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:06.960]  the accident rate has gone up in trucks. Prior to that, we only ran paper laws.
[02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:14.960]  And I could pull over anytime I wanted. If I felt tired, take a nap or whatever.
[02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:21.279]  But with these electronic logs, once you start rolling, you got to run. And if you get sick
[02:38:21.279 --> 02:38:27.360]  during the day, you better keep going. I've talked to a lot of truck drivers. So imagine
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:31.920]  you ate something bad, you got to pull over at a truck stop and use the bathroom. That's counted
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:36.640]  against you. Or when you're tired, you can't pull over two hours and go another eight. You got to do
[02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:44.720]  what it wants. It's so evil. It takes human control out of the equation. Yes, it does. And
[02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:51.200]  then you wonder why these guys are having wrecks because of this stuff. This isn't about safety.
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:55.760]  They don't care about people. It's about AI, computer control. Great points. Thanks for
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:39:02.800]  holding. George in California, you're on the air worldwide. Brother Alex, number one, God bless you
[02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:09.119]  and the crew. Secondly, there's this gentleman, I think you'll have a fascinating conversation
[02:39:09.119 --> 02:39:16.560]  with his name is Russell J. Gould is punctuated with a colon and a hyphen. He knows the language
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:22.320]  of laws. I think you two would have an amazing conversation. But what I called in about was,
[02:39:23.039 --> 02:39:32.560]  I got back into school in 2020. And I took a year off from 21 to 22. Coming back in in 22,
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:40.160]  they were having me submit my childhood vaccination records. And when I looked at
[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:45.760]  the ones they wanted, I had most of them there. Thank God I had all of them. But there was the
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:53.840]  one that Darren talked about the decaf. But there was also a Tdap. And thank God I didn't
[02:39:54.400 --> 02:40:01.039]  need the COVID shot because I had a medical exemption. So I was clear with that. But they
[02:40:01.039 --> 02:40:05.840]  were pushing really hard for me to get these other. Yeah, well, let's be clear, whether it's
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:11.200]  a university or hospital, there's waivers for all of it. They're buffaloing and BSing people.
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:16.240]  It's a scam. There is no law to make you take shots other than the military. And they can't
[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:20.240]  make you take experimental shots, the military, which COVID was so it's all a fraud.
[02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:24.560]  Absolutely, brother, just it got to my attention when you talked about the
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:30.960]  alpha thing with the meat allergy. It's like, wait, they couldn't get me to do the COVID shot,
[02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:35.279]  but they were pushing real hard for me to take not just that decaf, but there's this other one
[02:40:35.279 --> 02:40:41.279]  called a Tdap. Yep. Both those have the alpha-gal protein. I've got the FDA document right here.
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:46.240]  Exactly. I'm going to say it again, a fact. Most of these shots have alpha-gal in them.
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:50.240]  They will give you a meat allergy. They know what they're doing. They brag on TV.
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:56.000]  At day most, they're doing it to you. They don't have a right to attack you and quote,
[02:40:56.560 --> 02:41:00.000]  what's the document called? Here it is. Overhead shot, please.
[02:41:01.039 --> 02:41:06.480]  Human engineering and climate change, giving you shots to cause autoimmune response to beef.
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:12.960]  Yes, sir. And it's like, if they can't get you with one thing, they'll get you with another.
[02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:16.720]  I was just amazed how hard they would push it for me to get these other supposed childhood
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:20.960]  vaccinations updated. It's like, hey, I already took them. I don't need them. So why are they
[02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:25.119]  pushing it so hard? They're covering all their bases and I'm sure there's other stuff in there.
[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:30.240]  Absolutely. Thank you so much. And look, we're tough creatures. They don't want to hit us with
[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:35.600]  one thing that kills us outright. Usually they hit us with a bunch of stuff. That's why it's
[02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:42.000]  so important that you support the broadcast. Our most important work is at hand. This is the last
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:46.640]  day, it'll go through the weekend, but the last live show that we're going to offer the Alexa Pure

[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:20.960]  And then you simply put the poison tap water with the fluoride and the bisphenol A and the
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:26.240]  atrazine and all of it, thousands of chemicals in the average water,
[02:42:27.039 --> 02:42:32.560]  because it all runs off into the aquifers. The lakes are even worse. Filter your water.
[02:42:33.279 --> 02:42:36.160]  It's the number one thing you do to protect yourself and your family. And then it funds

[02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:05.520]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:12.160]  diet. They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it. And
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:19.760]  they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s. But the problem today is
[02:43:19.760 --> 02:43:26.400]  finding fish without a high mercury content. Your best option is our ultimate fish oil and
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:35.200]  ultimate krill oil at Infowarstore.com. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for both our neurological

[02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:01.760]  Hey everybody, Rodney Altbrown here. I want to thank Alex Jones and Infowars for offering
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:08.880]  scholarships to River University. Maybe you're watching Infowars today and you don't know what
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:15.279]  to do with the problems that we face in the world today. You've been through COVID-19, 2019, 2021,
[02:44:15.279 --> 02:44:22.000]  22, 23. But here at River University, not only do we show you what the problem is, but we show you
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:28.800]  how to deal with it. Come, a full three-year bachelor degree will train you up in ministry,
[02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:34.080]  government, worship, that you can go out and actually bring about a transformation
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:39.200]  in the earth today. We have graduates going all over the world from the Arctic to the Outback,
[02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:45.200]  and right here, this is what we do. We specialize in training people and equipping them for
[02:44:45.920 --> 02:44:50.960]  transformation, and that's what you'll do. So scan the QR code right now or go to

[02:44:56.480 --> 02:45:01.039]  The globalists are only humans. Yeah, they have control of the central banks. They have a lot of
[02:45:01.039 --> 02:45:06.000]  power, but they can be defeated. But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:10.160]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[02:45:10.160 --> 02:45:15.439]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with, and you do it with the highest
[02:45:15.439 --> 02:45:21.119]  quality gravity-fed filter out there. This thing does 10,000 gallons. You can sit there and put
[02:45:21.119 --> 02:45:25.600]  hundreds of gallons through it a day. It purifies very quickly, and it cuts out thousands of
[02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:30.960]  chemicals to non-detectable levels. This is what I use, which my family uses. It's the very best
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:36.000]  system out there for the lowest price for a limited time, 10% off on top of that exclusively

[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:46.240]  filters for folks that need those in stock. Get it today, and it funds the Infowar. Don't
[02:45:46.240 --> 02:45:50.400]  procrastinate. This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:55.039]  globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply. In some cases, they add
[02:45:55.039 --> 02:46:00.960]  the water supply like fluoride. When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down,
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:06.800]  this is the most concentrated, high-quality bone broth there is. Concentrated chicken broth,
[02:46:06.800 --> 02:46:11.600]  patented amazing. Then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive dose of beet pollen,
[02:46:12.240 --> 02:46:17.039]  a gigantic dose of highest-quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier from there.
[02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:22.240]  It's about to sell out. We haven't had it in stock for years. This first new run is about to sell out.

[02:53:24.800 --> 02:53:28.960]  Cars have rubber tires that light on fire and they burn down.
[02:53:30.519 --> 02:53:33.560]  In fact, that very place that just was incinerated
[02:53:33.560 --> 02:53:36.720]  there in Maui, I was there four years ago,
[02:53:36.720 --> 02:53:39.840]  and I get there to do whale watching in February,
[02:53:39.840 --> 02:53:43.359]  we were only there for a week, my wife and I,
[02:53:43.359 --> 02:53:45.880]  and there's helicopters and boats everywhere,
[02:53:45.880 --> 02:53:49.519]  and they go, listen, with the whale watching crew,
[02:53:49.519 --> 02:53:51.199]  they were marine biologists, you know,
[02:53:51.199 --> 02:53:52.960]  they do that as their side job, they go,
[02:53:52.960 --> 02:53:54.599]  never seen anything like this,
[02:53:54.599 --> 02:53:56.560]  I've got it on my iPhone somewhere,
[02:53:56.560 --> 02:53:59.619]  they said this is the most incredible thing ever,
[02:53:59.619 --> 02:54:02.359]  we have this particular species of whale that's mating,
[02:54:03.960 --> 02:54:08.880]  I forget which one it is, it's the gray whale or whatever,
[02:54:10.300 --> 02:54:13.359]  we were out there for only a three hour trip,
[02:54:13.359 --> 02:54:16.179]  the sea was almost completely calm, crystal clear,
[02:54:17.160 --> 02:54:20.099]  and there were giant whales,
[02:54:20.099 --> 02:54:23.019]  the female of that species races and runs,
[02:54:23.019 --> 02:54:24.820]  and sometimes for days the males chase them,
[02:54:24.820 --> 02:54:26.539]  so the males don't even eat for months
[02:54:26.539 --> 02:54:28.500]  coming down from Alaska, they get there,
[02:54:28.500 --> 02:54:30.019]  there's no plankton there for them,
[02:54:30.019 --> 02:54:31.560]  but they're there to breed,
[02:54:32.599 --> 02:54:35.380]  and the male whales were going under our boat,
[02:54:35.380 --> 02:54:36.220]  you're not supposed to get close to them,
[02:54:36.220 --> 02:54:37.859]  or they come by you, you can't stop them,
[02:54:37.859 --> 02:54:40.420]  huge whales going under our boat,
[02:54:40.420 --> 02:54:42.900]  50 yards away, they rise,
[02:54:42.900 --> 02:54:45.259]  and like a semi-truck going 30 miles an hour,
[02:54:45.259 --> 02:54:47.460]  this whale hits the other male whale
[02:54:47.460 --> 02:54:51.359]  and blood sprays everywhere, ripping the flesh off of him,
[02:54:52.939 --> 02:54:56.599]  it happened so close once, blood hit me in the face,
[02:54:57.580 --> 02:54:58.920]  you say why didn't you show that footage,
[02:54:58.920 --> 02:55:00.220]  I don't know why I didn't come back,
[02:55:00.220 --> 02:55:02.740]  I was there when I got married seven years ago in Kona,
[02:55:02.740 --> 02:55:04.220]  and the guy was a listener, he goes,
[02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:05.920]  we're not supposed to fly right over the volcano,
[02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:07.380]  but it's active, it was erupting then,
[02:55:07.380 --> 02:55:08.820]  he goes, I'm gonna fly you in it,
[02:55:08.820 --> 02:55:11.380]  we go over it and there's a lot of them,
[02:55:11.380 --> 02:55:12.619]  like 100 yards below us, I go,
[02:55:12.619 --> 02:55:15.380]  oh, I've seen enough, we can go now,
[02:55:15.380 --> 02:55:19.380]  magic place, man, magic, so,
[02:55:23.619 --> 02:55:28.259]  if you look at the area that's over 100 years old of houses,
[02:55:28.259 --> 02:55:30.460]  it's a lot of little houses, little businesses,
[02:55:30.460 --> 02:55:34.140]  little people in the town that burned down,
[02:55:34.140 --> 02:55:35.980]  and yeah, I think the left set the fires,
[02:55:35.980 --> 02:55:39.939]  I think that, the space laser thing,
[02:55:39.939 --> 02:55:41.859]  it's not how they work, folks,
[02:55:41.859 --> 02:55:44.099]  let me explain something to everybody,
[02:55:44.099 --> 02:55:46.800]  they don't like space lasers,
[02:55:47.699 --> 02:55:49.980]  because a laser is pure light
[02:55:49.980 --> 02:55:51.939]  and bounces off things very easily,
[02:55:51.939 --> 02:55:54.820]  you can have a glass surface, say, on a spaceship,
[02:55:54.820 --> 02:55:56.300]  and if you shoot it with a laser,
[02:55:56.300 --> 02:55:58.619]  most of the energy's gonna bounce off,
[02:55:58.619 --> 02:56:02.420]  what they have is cyclotronic particle beams in space
[02:56:02.420 --> 02:56:04.340]  that cycle up in a cyclotron,
[02:56:04.340 --> 02:56:06.380]  a small superconducting super collider,
[02:56:07.300 --> 02:56:11.380]  and then they fire particles at something,
[02:56:11.380 --> 02:56:15.980]  and that fries their systems and makes them explode,
[02:56:15.980 --> 02:56:17.900]  well, you shoot particle beams in a tree, though,
[02:56:17.900 --> 02:56:19.060]  it doesn't do anything,
[02:56:20.019 --> 02:56:23.000]  so they got particle accelerators in space,
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.340]  this whole space laser thing that's just ongoing,
[02:56:25.340 --> 02:56:28.279]  it's just not, under physics, feasible,
[02:56:29.340 --> 02:56:30.939]  I mean, even on the aircraft carriers
[02:56:30.939 --> 02:56:32.420]  and destroyers they've got,
[02:56:32.420 --> 02:56:33.900]  and they've got some jumbo jets
[02:56:33.900 --> 02:56:35.619]  that the whole plane is basically,
[02:56:35.619 --> 02:56:37.859]  the whole guts of the plane is a chemical laser,
[02:56:37.859 --> 02:56:41.240]  and they can shoot out 20, 30 miles and zap a missile,
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:45.800]  but it takes an entire jumbo jet
[02:56:46.840 --> 02:56:51.039]  with a laser in its nose to fry those missiles,
[02:56:51.039 --> 02:56:53.000]  well, you try putting loads like that in space,
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:54.039]  it's very expensive,
[02:56:54.920 --> 02:56:58.320]  so that's the expertise on that,
[02:56:58.320 --> 02:56:59.880]  I'm gonna go on a break, come back with your calls,
[02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:02.640]  Stu, Kendall, Tim, Todd,
[02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:05.279]  and then we'll hand the baton to the mighty Jay Dyer,
[02:57:05.279 --> 02:57:06.279]  who I just did an interview with,
[02:57:06.279 --> 02:57:07.759]  Sammy the Bulgarvano,
[02:57:07.759 --> 02:57:09.160]  that's gonna air, I guess, next week with him,
[02:57:09.160 --> 02:57:11.080]  that was amazing, we love Jay Dyer,
[02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:12.880]  he is coming up,
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:13.720]  please, whatever you do,
[02:57:13.720 --> 02:57:15.279]  share the article, share the video,

[02:57:22.320 --> 02:57:23.880]  you're doing an incredible job,
[02:57:23.880 --> 02:57:25.519]  it's the viewers supporting us
[02:57:25.519 --> 02:57:26.880]  and taking clips to share them,
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:28.679]  is 90% of our success,
[02:57:28.679 --> 02:57:31.460]  keep it up, you don't know how critical you are,
[02:57:31.460 --> 02:57:34.279]  I salute you, and I humbly thank you.
[02:57:34.279 --> 02:57:36.039]  Hour number four, straight ahead,

[02:57:48.119 --> 02:57:51.080]  I beg you to think about how important
[02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:53.240]  your word of mouth is,

[03:00:15.800 --> 03:00:16.800]  Hi Alex.
[03:00:16.800 --> 03:00:17.800]  Welcome.
[03:00:17.800 --> 03:00:18.800]  Hi Alex.
[03:00:18.800 --> 03:00:26.759]  You were talking about power structure taking down the opposition and all that and you were
[03:00:26.759 --> 03:00:31.720]  really hammering it with the shots and it's kind of really, I think it's all linked, but
[03:00:31.720 --> 03:00:38.119]  you've got the physical takedowns with J6 and what's happening there and then the chemical.
[03:00:38.119 --> 03:00:42.679]  But you know, there's 1,100 people who've been charged and they've got to list a whole
[03:00:42.679 --> 03:00:43.679]  bunch more along.
[03:00:43.679 --> 03:00:49.679]  I've got two questions, but I kind of want to start with this first one.
[03:00:49.679 --> 03:00:55.640]  When they take down Trump here, Smith comes at him and Julie Kelly says he's going to
[03:00:55.640 --> 03:01:01.160]  get seditioned on J6, charged him, and now it makes sense because I see these polls now,
[03:01:01.160 --> 03:01:07.960]  you know, 60% of Iowa Republicans say, oh, Trump should still run from Prince.
[03:01:07.960 --> 03:01:13.439]  So she says they're going to charge him with sedition for J6, which means more than likely
[03:01:13.439 --> 03:01:16.199]  and that judge is going out of her mind.
[03:01:16.199 --> 03:01:22.599]  I think she's threatening Trump now with his free speech is limited in its scope.
[03:01:22.599 --> 03:01:24.880]  And what's going to happen when they throw him in jail?
[03:01:25.119 --> 03:01:26.119]  What do you think happens?
[03:01:26.119 --> 03:01:28.880]  I think it makes it even more popular.
[03:01:28.880 --> 03:01:33.080]  I think the Supreme Court intervenes at that time that they have to, or we officially have
[03:01:33.080 --> 03:01:36.439]  a dictatorship of Merrick Garland and the Justice Department.
[03:01:36.439 --> 03:01:40.599]  The Justice Department has to know that the public completely hates them now, that they're
[03:01:40.599 --> 03:01:41.599]  a complete joke.
[03:01:41.599 --> 03:01:42.599]  That's like just a nightmare.
[03:01:42.599 --> 03:01:51.599]  I mean, let me tell you, they've been off more than they can chew.
[03:01:51.599 --> 03:01:56.160]  I mean, this is like you weigh a hundred pounds and can hardly walk and you start a fight
[03:01:56.160 --> 03:01:59.320]  with Mike Tyson in 1989.
[03:01:59.320 --> 03:02:04.679]  I mean, you know, I mean, in 1989, Muhammad Ali and his prime couldn't beat Mike Tyson.
[03:02:04.679 --> 03:02:10.439]  I mean, they're like literally getting in a tiger cage and punching a tiger in the nose.
[03:02:10.439 --> 03:02:12.080]  It's insane.
[03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:13.080]  And I don't like them.
[03:02:13.080 --> 03:02:14.080]  I don't care about them.
[03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:15.080]  They have no value to me.
[03:02:15.080 --> 03:02:16.080]  I don't want a war with them.
[03:02:16.080 --> 03:02:17.080]  I don't want to kill them.
[03:02:17.080 --> 03:02:18.679]  I don't want them to kill me.
[03:02:18.679 --> 03:02:19.679]  It's like dog manure.
[03:02:19.679 --> 03:02:20.679]  You just throw it in a trash can.
[03:02:20.759 --> 03:02:21.759]  It has no value.
[03:02:21.759 --> 03:02:23.679]  It has a negative value.
[03:02:23.679 --> 03:02:26.039]  But at the same time, you know, they're doing what they're doing.
[03:02:26.039 --> 03:02:27.039]  And so they're just idiots.
[03:02:27.039 --> 03:02:28.039]  They're total scum.
[03:02:28.039 --> 03:02:31.720]  And that leads to my second question, because you just said it.
[03:02:31.720 --> 03:02:38.560]  So gentlemen in Utah, Greg Robertson, OK, I want to ask you this and I want to ask your
[03:02:38.560 --> 03:02:39.560]  opinion on something.
[03:02:39.560 --> 03:02:42.160]  So, you know, he would never he'd still be above grass.
[03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:43.160]  I get it.
[03:02:43.160 --> 03:02:46.160]  The guy said whatever he said, but he's 70 some years old.
[03:02:46.160 --> 03:02:47.160]  He can barely walk.
[03:02:47.160 --> 03:02:50.960]  It's a 300 pound man with a cane taking care of his disabled son.
[03:02:50.960 --> 03:02:55.080]  And they went in there to make an example of him and shot him right in the heart.
[03:02:55.080 --> 03:02:56.080]  And you know who turned him in?
[03:02:56.080 --> 03:02:57.080]  This is what I'm going to do.
[03:02:57.080 --> 03:02:58.080]  Social group, whatever you call that, that division that gives the tips on their, you
[03:02:58.080 --> 03:02:59.080]  know, posting that's out of bounds or something crazy.
[03:02:59.080 --> 03:03:00.080]  And they're the ones that did it.
[03:03:00.080 --> 03:03:01.080]  That's Trump's platform.
[03:03:01.080 --> 03:03:02.080]  So my question is, what are these platforms worth?
[03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:03.080]  And what do you think of the truth?
[03:03:03.080 --> 03:03:04.080]  Social?
[03:03:04.080 --> 03:03:05.080]  What do you think of?
[03:03:05.080 --> 03:03:06.080]  I mean, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look,

[03:06:31.640 --> 03:06:35.759]  Hey buddy, I've been a long time listener.
[03:06:35.759 --> 03:06:37.840]  I was listening to your program the other day
[03:06:37.840 --> 03:06:40.160]  with Chris Skye and you guys were talking
[03:06:40.160 --> 03:06:42.199]  about the simian virus number 40
[03:06:43.119 --> 03:06:46.920]  that was discovered in the polio vaccines
[03:06:46.920 --> 03:06:49.039]  back when Dr. Salk and Dr. Sable were developing.
[03:06:49.039 --> 03:06:52.880]  Yep, and that is now in the COVID shots.
[03:06:52.880 --> 03:06:55.320]  Yes, I believe that they added it to the COVID shots
[03:06:55.320 --> 03:06:58.880]  as you guys said, but that stuff was discovered.
[03:06:58.880 --> 03:07:00.640]  And in a book, there's a book,
[03:07:00.640 --> 03:07:02.080]  it's called The Virus and the Vaccine.
[03:07:02.080 --> 03:07:04.720]  You can get it on Amazon for about $20.
[03:07:04.720 --> 03:07:08.759]  And with my current and longstanding distrust
[03:07:08.759 --> 03:07:10.119]  of the pharmaceutical industry,
[03:07:10.119 --> 03:07:12.320]  because of course we already know
[03:07:12.320 --> 03:07:14.840]  that the Rockefellers started all the pharmaceuticals
[03:07:14.840 --> 03:07:16.599]  and the poisons.
[03:07:16.599 --> 03:07:19.320]  They're all based with petrochemicals.
[03:07:19.320 --> 03:07:20.920]  So, I mean, you wanna step that in the body.
[03:07:20.920 --> 03:07:23.199]  And of course, the George Boyce is an American
[03:07:23.240 --> 03:07:24.080]  and you're free to do so,
[03:07:24.080 --> 03:07:27.279]  but at least get educated about it, right?
[03:07:27.279 --> 03:07:29.119]  I recommend that book to anybody.
[03:07:29.119 --> 03:07:31.160]  It will give you a valid argument
[03:07:31.160 --> 03:07:34.519]  about why you should not be taking vaccines.
[03:07:35.800 --> 03:07:38.840]  And if we don't help wake people up soon,
[03:07:39.720 --> 03:07:41.759]  there ain't gonna be people left.
[03:07:41.759 --> 03:07:42.880]  They don't say that,
[03:07:42.880 --> 03:07:44.359]  but there ain't gonna be people left.
[03:07:44.359 --> 03:07:46.279]  We're gonna get genetically modified
[03:07:46.279 --> 03:07:49.439]  by all these poisons and all these shots,
[03:07:49.439 --> 03:07:51.400]  the allergies and all the rest of it
[03:07:51.400 --> 03:07:52.359]  that are just coming out.
[03:07:52.400 --> 03:07:54.840]  That's just the tip of what's coming.
[03:07:54.840 --> 03:07:55.679]  No, it is.
[03:07:55.679 --> 03:07:56.519]  But let me back you up.
[03:07:56.519 --> 03:07:57.880]  It's not just in the polio vaccine
[03:07:57.880 --> 03:08:00.480]  my grandmother was given that died five years ago at 92,
[03:08:00.480 --> 03:08:02.800]  that her doctor told her she was given polio by the shot.
[03:08:02.800 --> 03:08:04.199]  And the AP and Reuters reporting
[03:08:04.199 --> 03:08:05.599]  the number one cause of polio worldwide
[03:08:05.599 --> 03:08:07.199]  is Bill Gates' U.N. shots.
[03:08:07.199 --> 03:08:09.359]  Here is the Epoch Times with the director,
[03:08:09.359 --> 03:08:11.240]  with the studies, with the U.S. government's
[03:08:11.240 --> 03:08:15.439]  monkey virus DNA found in COVID-19 shots, SV40.
[03:08:16.480 --> 03:08:19.080]  And then here's the Google saying it's not true,
[03:08:19.080 --> 03:08:20.439]  aiding and abetting the murder.
[03:08:20.439 --> 03:08:23.000]  So they know exactly what they're doing.
[03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:23.840]  Yes, they do.
[03:08:23.840 --> 03:08:27.480]  They discovered that polio, that SV40
[03:08:27.480 --> 03:08:30.840]  back in the development of the polio vaccines.
[03:08:30.840 --> 03:08:33.240]  The NIH covered it up then.
[03:08:33.240 --> 03:08:35.759]  The NIH has covered stuff up now.
[03:08:35.759 --> 03:08:37.720]  They're continuing to do so.
[03:08:37.720 --> 03:08:39.960]  And eventually we're going to have to make sure
[03:08:39.960 --> 03:08:43.000]  that these people cannot cover anything else up.
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:45.279]  Because again, like I said, they're killing it.
[03:08:45.279 --> 03:08:46.119]  Absolutely.
[03:08:46.119 --> 03:08:47.640]  They're murdering us, they're testing it,
[03:08:47.640 --> 03:08:48.480]  getting away with it.
[03:08:48.480 --> 03:08:49.880]  It's depopulation, it's their plan.
[03:08:50.320 --> 03:08:51.640]  Thank you so much, sir.
[03:08:51.640 --> 03:08:54.039]  Tim in California, you're on the air.
[03:08:55.679 --> 03:08:58.840]  I got this headline from truthout.org
[03:08:58.840 --> 03:09:02.439]  and also it went to ProPublica and later the Guardian.
[03:09:02.439 --> 03:09:06.160]  The EPA, you know, the Environmental Protection Agency,
[03:09:06.160 --> 03:09:09.080]  they approved a fuel ingredient nearly guaranteed
[03:09:09.080 --> 03:09:12.599]  to cause cancer over a lifetime for everybody on earth.
[03:09:12.599 --> 03:09:14.519]  This is how bad it is.
[03:09:14.519 --> 03:09:16.179]  They say it's a million times higher
[03:09:16.179 --> 03:09:18.519]  than what the agency usually considers
[03:09:18.519 --> 03:09:20.880]  an acceptable risk for new chemicals.
[03:09:20.880 --> 03:09:23.359]  And it's actually six times worse than the risk
[03:09:23.359 --> 03:09:25.400]  of lung cancer from a lifetime.
[03:09:25.400 --> 03:09:27.240]  What's the chemical?
[03:09:27.240 --> 03:09:29.480]  They're burning waste plastic.
[03:09:29.480 --> 03:09:31.000]  You can get it from a report.
[03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.279]  Oh, you're talking about dioxin.
[03:09:33.279 --> 03:09:37.439]  Well, it's the EPA released this report on 10, 17 and 22.
[03:09:37.439 --> 03:09:41.720]  No, no, they legalized what, years ago, burning dioxin.
[03:09:41.720 --> 03:09:43.599]  Yeah, you're right.
[03:09:43.599 --> 03:09:45.480]  Chevron's waste plastic fuels.
[03:09:45.480 --> 03:09:49.080]  We have only 6% of our plastic being recycled.
[03:09:49.080 --> 03:09:51.160]  So they're just gonna burn it.
[03:09:51.160 --> 03:09:53.039]  That's right, so the average, I meant to cover this,
[03:09:53.039 --> 03:09:55.880]  the average goody two-shoe recycles all of it,
[03:09:55.880 --> 03:09:58.119]  not knowing they're gonna burn it and put dioxin,
[03:09:58.119 --> 03:10:01.160]  there it is, EPA approval of fuel ingredient
[03:10:01.160 --> 03:10:03.119]  even though it could cause cancer
[03:10:03.119 --> 03:10:05.759]  in virtually every person exposed over a lifetime.
[03:10:05.759 --> 03:10:08.039]  Absolutely, brother, it's sick.
[03:10:08.039 --> 03:10:09.679]  And then they tell you the world's ending
[03:10:09.679 --> 03:10:12.279]  because they're deliberately ending it as we know it.
[03:10:13.240 --> 03:10:16.279]  And they say the reason why is because of,
[03:10:16.279 --> 03:10:18.800]  it's part of the Biden-Harris administration's action
[03:10:18.800 --> 03:10:20.599]  to confront climate crisis.
[03:10:20.599 --> 03:10:21.920]  And they admit this is too much.
[03:10:21.920 --> 03:10:23.880]  Yeah, gotta burn plastic, that'll save the Earth
[03:10:23.880 --> 03:10:25.320]  putting it into the atmosphere, yeah.
[03:10:25.320 --> 03:10:26.840]  I mean, you're totally right, brother,
[03:10:26.840 --> 03:10:28.920]  it is, they are murdering us.
[03:10:28.920 --> 03:10:31.640]  And these idiots, Jill Biden, Joe Biden,
[03:10:31.640 --> 03:10:33.080]  they're all breathing it too.
[03:10:34.840 --> 03:10:37.279]  And they say, look, seven in 100 people who eat the fish
[03:10:37.279 --> 03:10:38.640]  after they start doing this,
[03:10:38.640 --> 03:10:41.560]  it's 77,000 times the normal accepted risk
[03:10:41.599 --> 03:10:42.960]  for even what goes in the water
[03:10:42.960 --> 03:10:44.279]  from this burning of this bubble.
[03:10:44.279 --> 03:10:46.640]  I agree, they've gone full tilt boogie,
[03:10:47.519 --> 03:10:50.560]  bummer us to turn the Earth into a toxic hell hole.
[03:10:50.560 --> 03:10:52.720]  I'm glad you raised that, I meant to cover that.
[03:10:52.720 --> 03:10:55.480]  That's what I'm saying, they have gone crazy.
[03:10:56.720 --> 03:10:59.519]  They admit that, look, out of 100 people that eat fish,
[03:10:59.519 --> 03:11:00.840]  seven of them are expected to die,
[03:11:00.840 --> 03:11:04.640]  which is 77,000 times the normal accepted risk.
[03:11:04.640 --> 03:11:07.160]  They admit to this, they just break all the rules.
[03:11:07.160 --> 03:11:10.000]  It used to be one out of a million, we can your thing,
[03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:11.279]  you can't have your new ingredients.
[03:11:11.279 --> 03:11:14.439]  But they try to ban colloidal silver.
[03:11:15.400 --> 03:11:18.720]  But now it's 1.3 to one, not one in a million, 1.3 to one.
[03:11:18.720 --> 03:11:21.160]  In other words, every single person will get cancer
[03:11:21.160 --> 03:11:23.920]  they reasonably expect, and they're doing it anyways.
[03:11:23.920 --> 03:11:25.920]  It's, that's why I said they're working with aliens
[03:11:25.920 --> 03:11:27.199]  to kill everybody, I mean, it's the only thing
[03:11:27.199 --> 03:11:28.359]  that makes sense, it's like,
[03:11:28.359 --> 03:11:29.960]  thank you so much, Tim, great point.
[03:11:29.960 --> 03:11:32.000]  Kendall in South Carolina will skip the break
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:34.320]  and let Jay Dyer take over, go ahead, Kendall.
[03:11:35.279 --> 03:11:37.160]  Hey, man, how you doing?
[03:11:37.160 --> 03:11:39.759]  Man, you know, that last caller, my crew,
[03:11:39.759 --> 03:11:40.599]  just like they did with me,
[03:11:40.599 --> 03:11:42.199]  they just searched what he said, and there it was.
[03:11:42.199 --> 03:11:45.240]  I mean, they're burning plastic,
[03:11:45.240 --> 03:11:46.720]  you think you're recycling it,
[03:11:46.720 --> 03:11:48.599]  then instead of putting it in a landfill,
[03:11:48.599 --> 03:11:50.519]  it just sits there and does nothing,
[03:11:50.519 --> 03:11:52.960]  they burn it, releasing the poison into the air.
[03:11:52.960 --> 03:11:55.880]  I mean, the most evil thing you can imagine,
[03:11:55.880 --> 03:11:57.320]  they're doing worse than that.
[03:11:59.400 --> 03:12:02.599]  Shit, man, I can't believe any of this stuff.
[03:12:02.599 --> 03:12:06.080]  It seems like they're hitting us from every angle, man.
[03:12:06.119 --> 03:12:09.599]  I've started listening to y'all
[03:12:09.599 --> 03:12:11.240]  just a few months ago, really.
[03:12:11.240 --> 03:12:15.320]  It's, I don't know, it's really opened my eyes to a lot.
[03:12:15.320 --> 03:12:18.000]  I always knew something wasn't right,
[03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:21.480]  and COVID really opened my eyes to that.
[03:12:21.480 --> 03:12:24.960]  And I feel like COVID was the alarm
[03:12:24.960 --> 03:12:26.960]  that woke me up from my sleep,
[03:12:26.960 --> 03:12:29.599]  and then you're like the first show that I've watched
[03:12:29.599 --> 03:12:32.160]  that's, I feel like it's told me the truth,
[03:12:32.160 --> 03:12:34.800]  since anything, all of this has started.
[03:12:34.840 --> 03:12:37.400]  And I just wanna thank you for everything you do,
[03:12:37.400 --> 03:12:40.480]  and everything all of y'all do.
[03:12:40.480 --> 03:12:43.560]  I watch you and Harrison every day.
[03:12:43.560 --> 03:12:45.560]  I'm getting off work when Owen comes on,
[03:12:45.560 --> 03:12:46.800]  so I don't watch as much of him,
[03:12:46.800 --> 03:12:50.759]  but I mean, yeah, I wanna thank y'all for what y'all do.
[03:12:50.759 --> 03:12:53.599]  Y'all have great, great products.
[03:12:53.599 --> 03:12:58.599]  I started out with X3, and it just, man, it's great.
[03:12:59.279 --> 03:13:04.279]  I've tried TurboForce, BrainForce, the real Red Pill Plus,
[03:13:04.599 --> 03:13:06.519]  that's probably my favorite.
[03:13:07.519 --> 03:13:10.679]  I started taking it, and man,
[03:13:10.679 --> 03:13:12.920]  it's insane how quick my muscles are growing.
[03:13:14.359 --> 03:13:16.759]  It seems like I'm on steroids the most.
[03:13:16.759 --> 03:13:18.340]  Well, you are on steroids.
[03:13:19.759 --> 03:13:21.720]  Until the 70s, it was the number one thing
[03:13:21.720 --> 03:13:23.920]  prescribed for arthritis.
[03:13:23.920 --> 03:13:27.420]  Your body produces, the main ingredient is preglanone,
[03:13:27.420 --> 03:13:29.800]  and with all the chemicals in the food and water,
[03:13:29.800 --> 03:13:32.720]  it blocks preglanone, even if you produce it, it blocks it.
[03:13:32.720 --> 03:13:35.759]  So your body makes preglanone, and then makes testosterone
[03:13:37.240 --> 03:13:39.320]  and everything else out of it.
[03:13:39.320 --> 03:13:41.080]  So whatever the hormones are you're supposed to have,
[03:13:41.080 --> 03:13:42.400]  you're a male or female,
[03:13:42.400 --> 03:13:45.820]  preglanone is what all the bodybuilders take,
[03:13:45.820 --> 03:13:49.759]  but it's not like, it's not like an anabolic steroid.
[03:13:49.759 --> 03:13:52.859]  It's the precursor naturally to everything you need.
[03:13:52.859 --> 03:13:55.679]  That's why real Red Pill Plus works so well.
[03:13:55.679 --> 03:13:57.080]  Thank you for the call.
[03:13:57.080 --> 03:14:00.840]  All right, Jay Dyer takes over right now.
[03:14:00.840 --> 03:14:02.480]  Jay, great talking to you.
[03:14:03.240 --> 03:14:04.220]  Thanks for letting me take part of your time.
[03:14:04.220 --> 03:14:05.720]  We're gonna skip the break.
[03:14:08.599 --> 03:14:09.740]  That's right.
[03:14:09.740 --> 03:14:11.480]  I told him to play that as Jay's intro.
[03:14:11.480 --> 03:14:12.320]  Turn it up.
[03:14:15.720 --> 03:14:18.019]  Jay's analysis, bestselling author, good friend of mine,
[03:14:18.019 --> 03:14:19.199]  great researcher.
[03:14:19.199 --> 03:14:20.759]  We're gonna skip this network break in the next one
[03:14:20.759 --> 03:14:22.300]  so he gets his time back.
[03:14:23.240 --> 03:14:25.960]  But man, I hope they air it soon.
[03:14:25.960 --> 03:14:27.039]  I know they said the next two weeks,
[03:14:27.039 --> 03:14:29.080]  that Jimmy the Bull over Govano interview
[03:14:29.080 --> 03:14:32.320]  that we just did together was a powerful hour
[03:14:33.160 --> 03:14:34.000]  and a half, Jay Dyer.
[03:14:35.039 --> 03:14:35.880]  Oh, it was wild.
[03:14:35.880 --> 03:14:38.599]  It exceeded my expectations.
[03:14:38.599 --> 03:14:40.519]  I wanted both of you guys to get together
[03:14:40.519 --> 03:14:43.800]  and kind of cut loose, and you did.
[03:14:43.800 --> 03:14:44.640]  You guys went nuts.
[03:14:44.640 --> 03:14:46.560]  How did you get hooked up with that guy?
[03:14:48.279 --> 03:14:51.080]  I think I did, going on Sean Atwood's podcast,
[03:14:51.080 --> 03:14:52.480]  he covers a lot of true crime stuff,
[03:14:52.480 --> 03:14:54.599]  and I think Sammy and his people saw those interviews
[03:14:54.599 --> 03:14:56.759]  that we did about Vatican corruption,
[03:14:56.759 --> 03:14:59.279]  about the history of the mafia, organized crime,
[03:14:59.279 --> 03:15:00.519]  and the intelligence agencies,
[03:15:00.519 --> 03:15:01.640]  and so they reached out and said,
[03:15:02.160 --> 03:15:03.800]  hey, come on some of our interviews,
[03:15:03.800 --> 03:15:04.960]  and I said, yeah, I'd be glad to.
[03:15:04.960 --> 03:15:06.679]  So they reached out and said,
[03:15:06.679 --> 03:15:08.000]  hey, we'd love to talk to Alex,
[03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:09.340]  so I put that out there.
[03:15:10.840 --> 03:15:11.679]  Do you know when that airs?
[03:15:11.679 --> 03:15:13.560]  They said a couple weeks from now.
[03:15:13.560 --> 03:15:14.800]  Yeah, I think a couple weeks.
[03:15:14.800 --> 03:15:16.840]  They usually edit their stuff for a couple weeks,
[03:15:16.840 --> 03:15:19.400]  and then it goes up, but yeah,
[03:15:19.400 --> 03:15:21.400]  I think you're gonna have him on your show as well, right?
[03:15:21.400 --> 03:15:23.000]  Yeah, please set it up or help me.
[03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:24.039]  All right, Jay, take over.
[03:15:24.039 --> 03:15:25.240]  Thanks for letting me have some of your time.
[03:15:25.240 --> 03:15:26.920]  Have a great weekend, Jay Dyer.
[03:15:26.920 --> 03:15:28.640]  Absolutely, you too.
[03:15:28.640 --> 03:15:29.480]  Thank you, guys.
[03:15:29.880 --> 03:15:32.080]  Today, I wanna talk about a subject
[03:15:32.080 --> 03:15:33.720]  that we touched on a little bit
[03:15:33.720 --> 03:15:36.800]  in previous fourth hours of the Alex Jones Show,
[03:15:36.800 --> 03:15:39.640]  but we didn't really go deep with an expert guest,
[03:15:39.640 --> 03:15:42.800]  so today I have my friend Tim Gordon,
[03:15:42.800 --> 03:15:43.640]  who's coming on.
[03:15:43.640 --> 03:15:44.640]  I can't think of anybody better
[03:15:44.640 --> 03:15:47.000]  to cover this topic of religious engineering,
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:48.640]  and why religious engineering,
[03:15:48.640 --> 03:15:51.039]  and what we call institutional capture
[03:15:51.039 --> 03:15:54.039]  when it comes to the attempt of various power blocks,
[03:15:54.039 --> 03:15:56.679]  various NGOs, various think tanks,
[03:15:56.679 --> 03:15:58.880]  entities, very wealthy families
[03:15:58.920 --> 03:16:00.960]  that would like to take religious institutions
[03:16:00.960 --> 03:16:03.960]  and steer them and co-opt them into a certain direction.
[03:16:03.960 --> 03:16:05.599]  Tim Gordon is an author.
[03:16:05.599 --> 03:16:07.039]  He's a commentator.
[03:16:07.039 --> 03:16:10.480]  He is a Catholic, I would say, insider, you could say,
[03:16:10.480 --> 03:16:13.279]  who knows a lot about the inner workings of the Vatican.
[03:16:13.279 --> 03:16:14.519]  We're not just gonna talk about the Vatican.
[03:16:14.519 --> 03:16:17.400]  We're gonna get into the topics of the New World religion
[03:16:17.400 --> 03:16:18.320]  that they're trying to engineer
[03:16:18.320 --> 03:16:21.560]  and bring about the New Age kind of feminist religion,
[03:16:21.560 --> 03:16:23.560]  and because they wanna emasculate religion
[03:16:23.560 --> 03:16:26.000]  and emasculate Western civilization,
[03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:28.480]  they also really promote feminism,
[03:16:28.480 --> 03:16:31.960]  and that's why Tim is great for all three of those topics.
[03:16:31.960 --> 03:16:35.039]  He is the author of Rules for Retrogrades,
[03:16:35.039 --> 03:16:38.519]  Case for Patriarchy, and Don't Go to College.
[03:16:38.519 --> 03:16:42.039]  So, Tim, let's start it off with the question
[03:16:42.039 --> 03:16:46.560]  of the corruption of the Vatican and the Catholic Church,
[03:16:46.560 --> 03:16:48.039]  not to single out the Vatican.
[03:16:48.039 --> 03:16:49.640]  Certainly, this corruption is rife
[03:16:49.640 --> 03:16:52.720]  within the Orthodox Church, the Protestant world as well,
[03:16:52.720 --> 03:16:54.119]  but could you give us a breakdown
[03:16:54.119 --> 03:16:57.119]  of why Vagano and these different figures
[03:16:57.119 --> 03:16:57.960]  that are very well-known,
[03:16:57.960 --> 03:16:59.439]  why have they written these critiques
[03:16:59.439 --> 03:17:02.680]  and warned about what's going on in the papacy?
[03:17:04.320 --> 03:17:07.160]  Yeah, thanks for having me on today.
[03:17:07.160 --> 03:17:11.720]  Certainly, Vagano is a holy man in the Catholic Church
[03:17:11.720 --> 03:17:15.000]  that's pointing out what this Vatican under Francis
[03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:18.599]  has undertaken since almost right off the bat
[03:17:18.599 --> 03:17:19.680]  in this pontificate.
[03:17:19.680 --> 03:17:22.439]  Really, the second summer he was Pope,
[03:17:22.439 --> 03:17:25.880]  a year and a half in summer of 2014,
[03:17:26.720 --> 03:17:29.680]  Jeffrey Sachs, who you guys all know well,
[03:17:29.680 --> 03:17:31.439]  and Ban Ki-moon of the UN,
[03:17:31.439 --> 03:17:35.320]  spent much of the summer at the Vatican
[03:17:35.320 --> 03:17:37.919]  helping him to write his document
[03:17:37.919 --> 03:17:42.439]  on environmentalism and conservationism
[03:17:42.439 --> 03:17:44.519]  called Laudato Si,
[03:17:44.519 --> 03:17:47.640]  which lends to the population control agenda.
[03:17:47.640 --> 03:17:49.720]  That was summer of 2014.
[03:17:49.720 --> 03:17:51.439]  There's also been Vatican collusion
[03:17:51.439 --> 03:17:55.599]  in a similar direction with the WEF at Davos
[03:17:55.599 --> 03:17:57.840]  over the last four years.
[03:17:57.840 --> 03:17:59.480]  It's all population control
[03:17:59.480 --> 03:18:03.279]  in the name of environmentalism there at Davos, WEF.
[03:18:04.320 --> 03:18:09.320]  There's been thoroughgoing Vatican collusion with China,
[03:18:10.000 --> 03:18:14.840]  CCP China, and even the kind of, I don't know,
[03:18:14.840 --> 03:18:19.599]  ratification of, take CCP-sponsored bishops
[03:18:19.599 --> 03:18:22.560]  that the Catholic Church, Catholic pontiff,
[03:18:22.560 --> 03:18:27.560]  should never cede over to an extrinsic force,
[03:18:28.199 --> 03:18:33.039]  particularly one so hostile to the church as the communists.
[03:18:33.039 --> 03:18:35.960]  So remember, even a little bit further back,
[03:18:36.840 --> 03:18:41.560]  there were the emails that were dumped on Wikileaks.
[03:18:41.560 --> 03:18:46.560]  This is going back to a week before 2016 Trump election.
[03:18:47.439 --> 03:18:49.320]  And of course, it's like the third,
[03:18:49.320 --> 03:18:51.960]  third and a half year of the Francis pontificate
[03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:55.320]  when guys like Podesta were saying
[03:18:55.320 --> 03:18:57.279]  that there's gonna be a Catholic spring
[03:18:57.279 --> 03:19:00.640]  heavily insinuating a kind of collusion
[03:19:00.640 --> 03:19:05.160]  between the Obama-Clinton axis of America
[03:19:05.160 --> 03:19:08.720]  and the new Vatican, which is Pope Francis.
[03:19:08.720 --> 03:19:13.359]  And this is all culminating this fall
[03:19:13.359 --> 03:19:17.759]  with a synod, my church, the Roman Catholic Church,
[03:19:17.759 --> 03:19:20.160]  in Rome in October,
[03:19:20.160 --> 03:19:23.720]  which really seems to be nothing other than preparation
[03:19:23.720 --> 03:19:27.119]  for agenda 2030's realization.
[03:19:27.119 --> 03:19:29.680]  And that has all kinds of insinuations
[03:19:29.680 --> 03:19:32.919]  for your second and your third theme today, Jay,
[03:19:32.919 --> 03:19:34.880]  which is new world religion
[03:19:34.880 --> 03:19:37.960]  and feminist matriarchy taking over everything.
[03:19:37.960 --> 03:19:39.720]  They're all kind of the same topic.
[03:19:41.080 --> 03:19:43.279]  Yeah, and for those that are maybe not familiar
[03:19:43.279 --> 03:19:47.199]  with the Orthodox view, we have a similar situation
[03:19:47.199 --> 03:19:49.759]  with what we call the ecumenical patriarchy,
[03:19:50.359 --> 03:19:52.320]  who's kind of the first amongst the bishops
[03:19:52.320 --> 03:19:54.279]  in the Orthodox Church in terms of honor
[03:19:54.279 --> 03:19:56.119]  and historical privilege.
[03:19:56.119 --> 03:19:59.000]  And the ecumenical patriarchy is also on board
[03:19:59.000 --> 03:20:01.960]  with all the exact same things that Tim is talking about
[03:20:01.960 --> 03:20:05.160]  with the push for inclusive capitalism,
[03:20:05.160 --> 03:20:06.680]  the push for environmentalism.
[03:20:06.680 --> 03:20:09.199]  I think Bartholomew even penned a book
[03:20:09.199 --> 03:20:11.279]  that was promoted by Al Gore and Bill Clinton
[03:20:11.279 --> 03:20:14.800]  on the UN agenda 2030 style
[03:20:14.800 --> 03:20:17.919]  austerity population control agenda,
[03:20:17.919 --> 03:20:19.519]  even though they might not openly say
[03:20:20.279 --> 03:20:21.119]  they support population control.
[03:20:21.119 --> 03:20:22.640]  If you're supporting, you know,
[03:20:22.640 --> 03:20:25.279]  the Lynn Rothschild agenda of inclusive capitalism
[03:20:25.279 --> 03:20:27.320]  and the world economic forum Davos set,
[03:20:27.320 --> 03:20:30.840]  then you are supporting by extension
[03:20:30.840 --> 03:20:33.240]  the population control agenda
[03:20:33.240 --> 03:20:35.480]  because you can't divorce, you know,
[03:20:35.480 --> 03:20:39.039]  the UN UNESCO from that UNESCO was set up
[03:20:39.039 --> 03:20:41.240]  by Julian Huxley by design when he wrote
[03:20:41.240 --> 03:20:42.960]  the philosophy UNESCO for the purpose
[03:20:42.960 --> 03:20:46.359]  of rebranding depopulation as a kind of, you know,
[03:20:46.359 --> 03:20:50.359]  leftist a cause of helping the developing nations
[03:20:50.359 --> 03:20:52.000]  by reducing population.
[03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:54.199]  And now that's been expanded beyond reducing population
[03:20:54.199 --> 03:20:57.359]  to the third world to the entire world
[03:20:57.359 --> 03:20:59.160]  and particularly the Western world.
[03:20:59.160 --> 03:21:01.359]  And one of the key things they had to target
[03:21:01.359 --> 03:21:02.680]  was the Vatican.
[03:21:02.680 --> 03:21:04.759]  And I think there's a long process of this.
[03:21:04.759 --> 03:21:07.240]  One last thing I'll say on this before I throw back to you
[03:21:07.240 --> 03:21:09.720]  is we all know about this in the Cold War
[03:21:09.720 --> 03:21:11.800]  with the way that the Soviets, for example,
[03:21:11.800 --> 03:21:15.320]  would replace bishops in Russia with KGB bishops.
[03:21:15.320 --> 03:21:17.080]  So we have these kind of, you know,
[03:21:17.080 --> 03:21:19.880]  guys that were really just KGB kind of wearing cloaks
[03:21:19.880 --> 03:21:22.480]  and vestments pretending to be bishops.
[03:21:22.480 --> 03:21:25.199]  And a lot of people knew that this was the case.
[03:21:25.199 --> 03:21:27.720]  And I think people think, oh, well, that was the Cold War.
[03:21:27.720 --> 03:21:28.800]  That happened back then.
[03:21:28.800 --> 03:21:30.320]  And we're not in the Cold War anymore,
[03:21:30.320 --> 03:21:32.759]  but it's not any different in the sense
[03:21:32.759 --> 03:21:36.199]  that you can have essentially compromised prelates
[03:21:36.199 --> 03:21:37.119]  across the board.
[03:21:37.119 --> 03:21:39.240]  And the same thing goes for the Protestant world as well.
[03:21:39.240 --> 03:21:42.560]  For example, the Rockefeller family famously bought
[03:21:42.560 --> 03:21:46.160]  and paid for multiple seminaries and universities
[03:21:46.160 --> 03:21:50.840]  for Protestants to attend to ministers specifically
[03:21:50.840 --> 03:21:54.720]  so that they could be trained in the social gospel,
[03:21:54.720 --> 03:21:56.400]  essentially a kind of a liberal gospel,
[03:21:56.400 --> 03:21:59.160]  which removed all of the miracles.
[03:21:59.160 --> 03:22:01.119]  And could you tell us a little bit, for example,
[03:22:01.119 --> 03:22:03.759]  I know, Tim, you've talked a lot about things like Bella Dodd.
[03:22:03.759 --> 03:22:06.919]  And what do you think is going on with the infiltration
[03:22:06.919 --> 03:22:11.119]  with these kinds of examples that go back to the Cold War?
[03:22:11.160 --> 03:22:15.840]  The danger for Alex's audience here is to think
[03:22:15.840 --> 03:22:19.240]  the Orthodox Church, the Catholic Church
[03:22:19.240 --> 03:22:20.880]  are being infiltrated.
[03:22:20.880 --> 03:22:23.400]  Doesn't this mean that there's something wrong,
[03:22:23.400 --> 03:22:25.279]  like root and branch with the plant?
[03:22:25.279 --> 03:22:27.720]  No, it actually means that, look,
[03:22:27.720 --> 03:22:32.720]  the sacramental Episcopal Christian church, churches,
[03:22:35.359 --> 03:22:37.000]  go through that at another time.
[03:22:37.000 --> 03:22:38.640]  These are the number one target
[03:22:38.640 --> 03:22:40.320]  because they've got seven sacraments
[03:22:40.320 --> 03:22:42.519]  and they have bishops who stand directly
[03:22:42.519 --> 03:22:43.759]  in line of the apostles.
[03:22:43.759 --> 03:22:45.599]  That's why they're being targeted
[03:22:45.599 --> 03:22:48.240]  because they don't have the vetting powers
[03:22:48.240 --> 03:22:53.240]  that the NSA or the ONI or the FBI or the CIA have.
[03:22:54.279 --> 03:22:55.119]  They don't.
[03:22:55.119 --> 03:22:58.199]  So in Orthodox seminaries or Catholic seminaries,
[03:22:58.199 --> 03:23:02.160]  they're simply just taking people on their good word.
[03:23:02.160 --> 03:23:06.800]  And sometime after the shadow of Winter Palace, 1917,
[03:23:06.800 --> 03:23:08.800]  sometime after the French Revolution,
[03:23:10.960 --> 03:23:13.119]  the enemy here on earth realized
[03:23:13.119 --> 03:23:14.320]  that they could infiltrate.
[03:23:14.320 --> 03:23:17.119]  And this is a matter of geopolitics
[03:23:17.119 --> 03:23:20.599]  as much as it is a matter of concern for Christians
[03:23:20.599 --> 03:23:21.519]  like you or me.
[03:23:22.400 --> 03:23:25.000]  We have, of course, several records of this.
[03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:26.800]  You mentioned Bella Dodd, Jay.
[03:23:26.800 --> 03:23:31.320]  I mean, Bella Dodd, after she was a Catholic,
[03:23:31.320 --> 03:23:35.400]  Italian-American girl who fell away from the faith,
[03:23:35.400 --> 03:23:38.279]  fell in with Stalinist Russia,
[03:23:38.279 --> 03:23:43.279]  and was planting, implanting evil guys
[03:23:43.519 --> 03:23:47.599]  in Catholic seminaries at the behest directly of Stalin.
[03:23:47.599 --> 03:23:50.800]  She claims after she reverted to the faith
[03:23:50.800 --> 03:23:53.480]  at the behest of Archbishop Fulton Sheen,
[03:23:53.480 --> 03:23:57.720]  she admitted to having placed 1,100 men
[03:23:57.720 --> 03:23:59.720]  in Catholic seminaries.
[03:23:59.720 --> 03:24:04.439]  And she said a handful of them are in the highest places
[03:24:04.439 --> 03:24:05.359]  of the Vatican right now.
[03:24:05.359 --> 03:24:08.519]  For some reason, to my chagrin,
[03:24:08.519 --> 03:24:11.599]  Archbishop Fulton Sheen didn't have her name names.
[03:24:11.599 --> 03:24:14.599]  But she did a tremendous amount of evil.
[03:24:14.599 --> 03:24:17.000]  There's another account of this
[03:24:17.000 --> 03:24:20.320]  by a French-Canadian nun who tended to a guy
[03:24:20.320 --> 03:24:22.240]  who'd been in a motorcycle accident
[03:24:22.240 --> 03:24:26.480]  called the Confessions of AA 1025,
[03:24:26.480 --> 03:24:30.759]  or sometimes SS 1025, where he had a dossier,
[03:24:30.759 --> 03:24:33.519]  which more or less vindicated
[03:24:33.519 --> 03:24:34.640]  what Bella Dodd had said.
[03:24:34.640 --> 03:24:39.080]  He, in other words, is presumably one of those 1,100 plants
[03:24:39.080 --> 03:24:40.359]  that Bella Dodd had made
[03:24:40.359 --> 03:24:43.560]  into North American Catholic priesthood.
[03:24:43.560 --> 03:24:47.000]  And he was essentially an evil dude
[03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:50.199]  who is of the LGBT persuasion
[03:24:50.199 --> 03:24:53.199]  that would from within corrupt the doctrine
[03:24:53.199 --> 03:24:55.919]  and bend it in a feminist direction,
[03:24:55.919 --> 03:24:58.759]  bend it in a religiously syncretist direction.
[03:24:58.759 --> 03:25:01.480]  That means all religions are the same.
[03:25:01.519 --> 03:25:05.680]  Stuff you hear from stoners every day in bad movies.
[03:25:05.680 --> 03:25:08.400]  And bend it in a one world government direction.
[03:25:08.400 --> 03:25:11.800]  And there's a kind of, there's not a trifurcation there.
[03:25:11.800 --> 03:25:16.080]  Those are the three parts of the same attack.
[03:25:17.080 --> 03:25:22.080]  So this plan had gone even further back into history
[03:25:22.359 --> 03:25:25.359]  into the middle 19th century.
[03:25:25.359 --> 03:25:28.919]  And we know it in terms of intercepted documents
[03:25:28.919 --> 03:25:32.240]  by the popes in the middle 1800s.
[03:25:32.240 --> 03:25:33.880]  One of the documents is called
[03:25:33.880 --> 03:25:37.519]  the Permanent Instruction of the Alta Vendita.
[03:25:37.519 --> 03:25:42.519]  Yeah, which is an attack by P2 Lodge,
[03:25:42.519 --> 03:25:44.160]  basically secret societies,
[03:25:44.160 --> 03:25:46.599]  highest secret society in Italy there,
[03:25:46.599 --> 03:25:50.320]  saying we are gonna take the next 100 years
[03:25:50.320 --> 03:25:52.480]  till about the middle 20th century.
[03:25:52.480 --> 03:25:54.880]  And even though the soldier will die,
[03:25:54.880 --> 03:25:56.519]  the march will carry on,
[03:25:56.519 --> 03:25:59.480]  we're going to corrupt Catholic doctrine,
[03:25:59.480 --> 03:26:01.519]  which had not been corrupted to that point,
[03:26:01.519 --> 03:26:02.919]  had never been touched.
[03:26:04.080 --> 03:26:07.880]  For 1900 years, we're going to do it from within.
[03:26:07.880 --> 03:26:09.919]  So whether you're talking Marxist, Mason,
[03:26:09.919 --> 03:26:12.759]  or some other term for it,
[03:26:12.759 --> 03:26:16.119]  the same stuff was going on at the late 19th century,
[03:26:16.119 --> 03:26:17.519]  early 20th century.
[03:26:17.519 --> 03:26:20.519]  And it's not just conspiracy theory,
[03:26:20.519 --> 03:26:23.599]  the way like goofball left caps
[03:26:23.599 --> 03:26:26.279]  will charge a far right wing Catholic
[03:26:27.039 --> 03:26:29.720]  of holding, you have the writings of popes
[03:26:29.720 --> 03:26:33.080]  like Leo XIII, turn of the century popes,
[03:26:33.080 --> 03:26:37.759]  Leo XIII, Pius X, even one by Pius IX
[03:26:37.759 --> 03:26:41.039]  on a kind of modernist infiltration of the church,
[03:26:41.039 --> 03:26:45.119]  which will conduce to these precise three themes
[03:26:45.119 --> 03:26:47.439]  that you and I are talking about today.
[03:26:47.439 --> 03:26:50.199]  And by the way, folks out there might not know
[03:26:50.199 --> 03:26:52.279]  what a papal encyclical is, Jay,
[03:26:52.279 --> 03:26:54.240]  but it's, as you know,
[03:26:54.279 --> 03:26:56.720]  a papal letter of usually warning
[03:26:56.720 --> 03:26:59.640]  to all of the faithful, all the bishops in the world.
[03:26:59.640 --> 03:27:04.480]  The most common topic, the mode of encyclical topic
[03:27:04.480 --> 03:27:05.640]  of all the various topics
[03:27:05.640 --> 03:27:07.919]  that all the papal encyclicals have been written on
[03:27:07.919 --> 03:27:09.080]  at the Catholic church
[03:27:09.080 --> 03:27:12.720]  is infiltration by secret societies.
[03:27:12.720 --> 03:27:13.560]  So it's not-
[03:27:13.560 --> 03:27:15.880]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:27:15.880 --> 03:27:18.720]  Yeah, and to back Tim's point up there,
[03:27:18.720 --> 03:27:19.560]  what he's talking about,
[03:27:19.560 --> 03:27:21.599]  there's actually a single book that actually covers this.
[03:27:21.599 --> 03:27:22.880]  It's a great book called
[03:27:22.880 --> 03:27:24.359]  Popes Against the Modern Errors.
[03:27:24.359 --> 03:27:26.599]  And I'm citing this because it really shows
[03:27:26.599 --> 03:27:29.119]  what Tim's talking about isn't a conspiracy theory,
[03:27:29.119 --> 03:27:33.240]  but rather really the Western Episcopal teaching
[03:27:33.240 --> 03:27:36.320]  for a long time until you begin to have these fissures
[03:27:36.320 --> 03:27:38.640]  where there's a really strong push,
[03:27:38.640 --> 03:27:41.919]  like he said, for a lot of Masonic ideas.
[03:27:41.919 --> 03:27:45.480]  P2 is a great example because as you guys know,
[03:27:45.480 --> 03:27:47.119]  here on The Fourth Hour and on my channel,
[03:27:47.119 --> 03:27:48.880]  we've done a lot of deep dives
[03:27:48.880 --> 03:27:51.000]  into the history of the P2 Lodge
[03:27:51.080 --> 03:27:53.640]  and their connection eventually to elements within the CIA,
[03:27:53.640 --> 03:27:54.720]  particularly Kissinger's,
[03:27:54.720 --> 03:27:58.599]  who found P2 to be a formative way
[03:27:58.599 --> 03:28:01.320]  to not just control the government of Italy,
[03:28:01.320 --> 03:28:04.119]  but to actually set up the Gladio network,
[03:28:04.119 --> 03:28:05.480]  which we've covered when we lectured
[03:28:05.480 --> 03:28:08.599]  through the Paul Williams Gladio text.
[03:28:08.599 --> 03:28:10.279]  He's a Catholic professor
[03:28:10.279 --> 03:28:12.199]  who's a little more on the left side of things.
[03:28:12.199 --> 03:28:14.880]  But what we found interesting when we dove into that
[03:28:14.880 --> 03:28:17.800]  was that his overall thesis also ties
[03:28:17.840 --> 03:28:22.279]  into a pro-CIA right-wing Catholic narrative
[03:28:22.279 --> 03:28:24.880]  that we got from John Koehler,
[03:28:24.880 --> 03:28:26.119]  who's kind of authoritative
[03:28:26.119 --> 03:28:27.680]  when it comes to the history of the Stasi.
[03:28:27.680 --> 03:28:29.400]  Both of those texts really point out
[03:28:29.400 --> 03:28:32.919]  that you have an infiltration of the religious world
[03:28:32.919 --> 03:28:35.240]  from the secret societies, Masonic networks,
[03:28:35.240 --> 03:28:37.880]  allied with certain elements of the CIA.
[03:28:37.880 --> 03:28:39.919]  And I don't wanna be too overly broad
[03:28:39.919 --> 03:28:41.720]  because if you have British intelligence
[03:28:41.720 --> 03:28:43.000]  or the CIA in the Cold War,
[03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:44.640]  certainly there were a lot of right-wing elements
[03:28:44.640 --> 03:28:46.560]  within those structures
[03:28:46.560 --> 03:28:48.240]  that wanted to promote Catholicism,
[03:28:48.240 --> 03:28:51.480]  wanted to promote genuinely conservative ideas.
[03:28:51.480 --> 03:28:54.480]  But the problem is that the real pop power in my...
[03:28:56.400 --> 03:28:59.000]  When hope and love has been lost
[03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:01.119]  and you fall to the ground,
[03:29:01.119 --> 03:29:03.160]  you must find a way.
[03:29:04.880 --> 03:29:07.000]  When the darkness descends
[03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:08.919]  and you're told it's the end,
[03:29:08.919 --> 03:29:11.960]  you must find a way.
[03:29:12.000 --> 03:29:14.800]  When God decides to look the other way
[03:29:14.800 --> 03:29:16.519]  and a clown takes the throne,
[03:29:16.519 --> 03:29:18.240]  we must find a way.
[03:29:18.240 --> 03:29:20.320]  You will find a way.
[03:29:20.320 --> 03:29:22.720]  Dig down and find faith.
[03:29:24.080 --> 03:29:26.279]  When you're close to the edge
[03:29:26.279 --> 03:29:27.720]  with a gun to your head,
[03:29:27.720 --> 03:29:31.160]  you must find a way.
[03:29:31.160 --> 03:29:32.480]  We have entered the fray
[03:29:32.480 --> 03:29:34.240]  and we will not obey.
[03:29:34.240 --> 03:29:36.119]  We must find a way
[03:29:37.119 --> 03:29:38.519]  and find faith.
[03:29:38.919 --> 03:29:43.400]  Dig down and find a way.
[03:29:43.400 --> 03:29:46.080]  We won't let them divide.
[03:29:46.080 --> 03:29:48.840]  We will never abide.
[03:29:48.840 --> 03:29:51.080]  We will find a way.
[03:29:51.080 --> 03:29:53.080]  Infowars.com
[03:29:56.080 --> 03:29:59.320]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store
[03:29:59.320 --> 03:30:00.840]  or like a vitamin shop.
[03:30:00.840 --> 03:30:02.960]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[03:30:02.960 --> 03:30:04.840]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[03:30:04.840 --> 03:30:07.320]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[03:30:07.359 --> 03:30:08.119]  Hey, what's better?
[03:30:08.119 --> 03:30:09.000]  Knockout.
[03:30:09.000 --> 03:30:10.320]  What's better?
[03:30:10.320 --> 03:30:11.039]  Down and out.
[03:30:11.039 --> 03:30:11.640]  What's better?
[03:30:11.640 --> 03:30:13.840]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[03:30:13.840 --> 03:30:16.480]  And the answer is different herbal formulas,
[03:30:16.480 --> 03:30:19.439]  different compounds are better for different people.
[03:30:19.439 --> 03:30:21.960]  So one person might like this coffee.
[03:30:21.960 --> 03:30:23.480]  Another person likes that coffee.
[03:30:23.480 --> 03:30:24.840]  That's how our bodies work.
[03:30:24.840 --> 03:30:26.119]  They're all very diverse.
[03:30:26.119 --> 03:30:27.519]  But we've been able to private label
[03:30:27.519 --> 03:30:29.320]  a national bestseller

[03:32:55.700 --> 03:33:04.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:06.400 --> 03:33:16.080]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jays Analysis, we were
[03:33:16.080 --> 03:33:21.440]  just talking about religious infiltration and how intelligence agencies, governments,
[03:33:21.440 --> 03:33:25.520]  secret societies have attempted, at least for the last few centuries, you can go back
[03:33:25.520 --> 03:33:30.840]  to the ancient world as well, to try to control the church, to try to control what would be
[03:33:30.840 --> 03:33:38.279]  preached from the various religious organizations, to steer them in the direction of what the
[03:33:38.279 --> 03:33:39.279]  state wants.
[03:33:39.279 --> 03:33:44.560]  There's an old movie that I think of called Beckett, and it's about the history of Thomas
[03:33:44.560 --> 03:33:50.539]  Beckett in England, and in that movie, Peter O'Toole plays the evil king who puts his drinking
[03:33:50.539 --> 03:33:55.760]  buddy in as the Archbishop of Canterbury to try to control the church, and this is a big
[03:33:55.760 --> 03:34:00.640]  problem in the West, in the East as well, it's known as the investiture controversy
[03:34:00.640 --> 03:34:04.920]  in the East, you have the history of this with various emperors trying to control and
[03:34:04.920 --> 03:34:07.279]  change the theology of the church.
[03:34:07.279 --> 03:34:11.800]  So this is nothing new, and if we get to the modern period, if you think about the British
[03:34:11.800 --> 03:34:16.400]  Empire, a lot of people don't know or they may have forgotten that the British Empire
[03:34:16.400 --> 03:34:22.560]  controlled through basic ideas like divide and conquer, there's a great book called Secret
[03:34:22.560 --> 03:34:28.800]  Affairs written by a Royal Society researcher, so this is somebody from high-level establishment,
[03:34:28.960 --> 03:34:33.920]  and he's just really tracing the history of the British Empire's usage of radical Islam,
[03:34:33.920 --> 03:34:38.560]  and so one of the ways that people try to control is through controlled opposition,
[03:34:38.560 --> 03:34:42.760]  and that can include religious groups, especially if they're really radical, so the British
[03:34:42.760 --> 03:34:48.880]  Empire would use these radical Muslims to really divide and conquer in the Arab world
[03:34:48.880 --> 03:34:53.600]  so that they could control the Arab world, that was one of the jobs that, for example,
[03:34:53.600 --> 03:34:59.440]  Kim Philby Sr. had or that T.E. Lawrence had, if you've seen Lawrence of Arabia, that's
[03:34:59.440 --> 03:35:06.320]  about that, and the American super-establishment, the superstructure, they've basically inherited
[03:35:06.320 --> 03:35:10.760]  the same thing, and they want to control entities like the Catholic Church, this was famously
[03:35:10.760 --> 03:35:15.520]  known as the doctrinal warfare program of C.D. Jackson coming out of the CIA, and I've
[03:35:15.520 --> 03:35:20.119]  been lecturing on Mockingbird recently, Operation Mockingbird included C.D. Jackson as well as
[03:35:20.119 --> 03:35:21.760]  a lot of Hollywood people.
[03:35:21.760 --> 03:35:25.400]  So what we were talking about there was the Cold War stuff, and really what I was trying
[03:35:25.400 --> 03:35:31.039]  to get to was just that power structure that was really in the background of the Cold War
[03:35:31.039 --> 03:35:35.359]  that really liked a lot of elements of Fabian socialism, they didn't really like Sovietism,
[03:35:35.359 --> 03:35:42.359]  but they liked socialism and slow-kill, slow communism known as Fabian socialism, and
[03:35:42.359 --> 03:35:47.600]  you can see that actually with the Rockefellers, who in their authorized biography, there's
[03:35:47.600 --> 03:35:53.119]  a whole chapter on their funding of two different things that we're going to talk about now,
[03:35:53.119 --> 03:35:55.440]  the first of which is a new world religion.
[03:35:55.440 --> 03:35:59.520]  The Rockefellers put tons of money into the ecumenist movement from its earliest days,
[03:35:59.520 --> 03:36:04.560]  millions of dollars to create the National Council of Churches, World Council of Churches,
[03:36:04.560 --> 03:36:10.760]  with the explicit goal of bending and turning Christianity to a new kind of Christianity
[03:36:10.760 --> 03:36:17.480]  that melds more in a syncretistic way, like Tim said, with an emerging world religion
[03:36:17.480 --> 03:36:19.720]  that they will control.
[03:36:19.720 --> 03:36:24.720]  And this is the ecumenical patriarchate, this is Francis and a lot of people in the Roman
[03:36:24.720 --> 03:36:29.960]  Catholic world as well, and many of the Protestant leaders too, including Jewish and Muslim
[03:36:29.960 --> 03:36:33.400]  leaders that I think go back to some of these older control groups as well.
[03:36:33.400 --> 03:36:37.279]  So Tim, what do you think about this push for a new world religion?
[03:36:37.279 --> 03:36:42.680]  Is this a real thing going on with mainline religious groups?
[03:36:42.680 --> 03:36:43.680]  Without a doubt.
[03:36:43.680 --> 03:36:44.680]  The evidence is plenary.
[03:36:44.680 --> 03:36:49.119]  I think you're second to none in terms of being voiced.
[03:36:49.119 --> 03:36:50.480]  That shows it's absolutely real.
[03:36:50.480 --> 03:36:57.640]  There are a lot of people online that assert the conclusion baldly, what I've always respected
[03:36:57.640 --> 03:36:59.279]  about you, Jay, you bring the receipts.
[03:36:59.279 --> 03:37:04.800]  I mean, look, if someone out there, whether they're a Protestant, Orthodox or Catholic
[03:37:04.800 --> 03:37:12.000]  Christian, is still scratching their heads skeptically, consider the Abu Dhabi statement
[03:37:12.000 --> 03:37:16.720]  signed in 2019 by Francis and other world religious leaders.
[03:37:16.720 --> 03:37:20.520]  To me, this is the ultimate source document.
[03:37:20.520 --> 03:37:28.440]  The main paragraph here that's now famous, infamous, it reads as such, the pluralism
[03:37:28.440 --> 03:37:34.960]  and the diversity of religions, color, sex, race, and language are willed by God in his
[03:37:34.960 --> 03:37:39.440]  wisdom through which he created human beings.
[03:37:39.440 --> 03:37:50.320]  Now it was a slight of hand because of course we're used to liberalism by now 150, 200 years
[03:37:50.320 --> 03:37:55.199]  shoving down our throats the diversity of all these other categories and they're not
[03:37:55.199 --> 03:37:59.160]  nearly so offensive, irrespective of what your real view on it is.
[03:37:59.160 --> 03:38:05.480]  They're not nearly so dangerous as diversity of religions, particularly when you're saying
[03:38:05.480 --> 03:38:12.680]  that the diversity of religions, meaning true faith, one true faith, irrespective of what
[03:38:12.680 --> 03:38:18.480]  you think it is, and all the false faiths are willed together by God.
[03:38:18.480 --> 03:38:23.960]  And there's an important distinction here, not just willed by God in what we call his
[03:38:23.960 --> 03:38:29.880]  permissive will, those wicked things which he will suffer, which he will allow because
[03:38:29.880 --> 03:38:36.600]  of the free will of human beings, but specifically in his wise will, are willed by God in his
[03:38:36.600 --> 03:38:37.920]  wisdom.
[03:38:37.920 --> 03:38:42.760]  So this is to say in his proper will, his wise will.
[03:38:42.760 --> 03:38:45.840]  This cannot be.
[03:38:45.840 --> 03:38:49.880]  There are a couple of bishops, you mentioned Vigano in the Catholic Church.
[03:38:49.880 --> 03:38:55.560]  There's also our Archbishop Athanasius Schneider, who's aptly named one of the other heroes
[03:38:55.560 --> 03:39:03.480]  in the Catholic Church, who rushed to point out that this cannot happen.
[03:39:03.480 --> 03:39:08.560]  God might allow the diversity of religion, which just means error, it just means errant
[03:39:08.560 --> 03:39:11.640]  religion to coexist alongside true religion.
[03:39:11.640 --> 03:39:18.279]  He might allow it to exist in what we call his permissive will, that's a kind of equivocal
[03:39:18.279 --> 03:39:24.039]  name for it, but not in his wise will in terms of what providence actually designed
[03:39:24.039 --> 03:39:28.560]  and hopes for if human beings make the right decision.
[03:39:28.560 --> 03:39:36.960]  So this is proof, this is like, and you do Jay, you can cite book after book after book
[03:39:36.960 --> 03:39:42.320]  of good stuff and you always bring the receipts, but this is a record, as we would say in the
[03:39:42.320 --> 03:39:43.320]  law.
[03:39:43.320 --> 03:39:49.240]  And the Abu Dhabi statement is ground zero for proving the case to skeptics.
[03:39:49.240 --> 03:39:54.240]  Yeah, great example, and that's actually the basis for the multi-faith center that they
[03:39:54.240 --> 03:39:59.039]  built in Abu Dhabi, which is this idea that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam can have
[03:39:59.039 --> 03:40:06.440]  a kind of a chapel, a triad chapel of evil, as if they all believe the same thing.
[03:40:06.440 --> 03:40:11.279]  And even though there might be a tacit recognition that there's differences, the idea here is,
[03:40:11.279 --> 03:40:17.160]  well, let's ignore all of the really significant differences like Jesus, right?
[03:40:17.160 --> 03:40:21.440]  And let's just pretend that we kind of all have the same idea.
[03:40:21.440 --> 03:40:27.119]  And this is a manifestation of what I would say is the same power structures planned from
[03:40:27.119 --> 03:40:28.119]  a long time ago.
[03:40:28.119 --> 03:40:34.440]  Let me give an example, the very infamous H.G. Wells, who was a high-level Freemason
[03:40:34.440 --> 03:40:41.440]  by his own admission, who was an atheist, at least in public perception, but he wrote
[03:40:41.440 --> 03:40:47.199]  a lesser-known book that I have an old copy, it's a 1917 copy of his book, God, the Invisible
[03:40:47.199 --> 03:40:48.199]  King.
[03:40:48.199 --> 03:40:54.199]  And a lot of people think, well, he had to be some kind of a scientism, soy man, atheist.
[03:40:54.199 --> 03:41:00.660]  No, actually, if you look at what he says, if you go to page 101, he says that our God
[03:41:00.660 --> 03:41:05.100]  is actually Prometheus or Lucifer.
[03:41:05.100 --> 03:41:11.980]  And people don't know that he was actually a pre-60s counterculture New Age.
[03:41:11.980 --> 03:41:16.300]  In that book and in other books, he says, we're going to have to have a New Age religion.
[03:41:16.300 --> 03:41:24.140]  And his other cohort in Fabian Socialism was a woman named Helena Blavatsky.
[03:41:24.140 --> 03:41:25.539]  And she was a theosophist.
[03:41:25.539 --> 03:41:29.220]  And what's interesting is that both of these characters, whether it's H.G. Wells or Blavatsky,
[03:41:29.220 --> 03:41:33.460]  they were close to a group of people known as the Milner Circles.
[03:41:33.460 --> 03:41:35.539]  And they were both Fabian Socialists.
[03:41:35.539 --> 03:41:38.060]  And they both pushed the idea of a New Age religion.
[03:41:38.060 --> 03:41:44.699]  In fact, I think, I'm pretty sure Blavatsky cites various Masonic authors to say that
[03:41:44.699 --> 03:41:52.380]  we will have to create a New Age religion to go along with the global world federalist
[03:41:52.380 --> 03:41:53.580]  government.
[03:41:53.580 --> 03:41:55.660]  So this is not a new plan.
[03:41:55.660 --> 03:42:00.420]  It didn't come out with a bunch of boomers in the 1960s smoking weed and saying, yeah,
[03:42:00.420 --> 03:42:02.260]  we just have one religion or whatever.
[03:42:02.260 --> 03:42:03.260]  No, no.
[03:42:03.260 --> 03:42:07.660]  This is an old socially engineered plan by the wealthiest people in the West to have
[03:42:07.660 --> 03:42:10.500]  a religion that they control.
[03:42:10.500 --> 03:42:14.699]  And like Tim said, it's explicitly there.
[03:42:14.699 --> 03:42:16.980]  Tim, we got about 30 seconds here.
[03:42:16.980 --> 03:42:19.180]  What do you think about that?
[03:42:19.220 --> 03:42:25.939]  Well, I think for the folks out there who are at a certain level of religiosity, what
[03:42:25.939 --> 03:42:30.619]  they need to consider is why would the evil elitists who run everything really do this?
[03:42:30.619 --> 03:42:31.900]  Here's why.
[03:42:31.900 --> 03:42:37.740]  Because the drive to know supernaturally, or at least to worship supernaturally, what
[03:42:37.740 --> 03:42:41.619]  we call organized religion, is a natural drive.
[03:42:41.619 --> 03:42:42.619]  It's a natural drive.
[03:42:42.619 --> 03:42:49.140]  And they know that even if they push reductionist materialism, there will always be that supernatural
[03:42:49.140 --> 03:42:50.140]  drive.
[03:42:50.140 --> 03:42:53.140]  So they're going to cull it and steer it the way they want.
[03:42:53.140 --> 03:42:56.460]  No going where this is the oxygen, so we brought back with feminism.
[03:42:56.460 --> 03:43:00.900]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God, through Mother Nature, has given us the
[03:43:00.900 --> 03:43:01.900]  answer.
[03:43:01.900 --> 03:43:06.100]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it

[03:44:56.539 --> 03:45:03.939]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength and they can only be obtained through
[03:45:03.939 --> 03:45:04.939]  diet.
[03:45:04.980 --> 03:45:10.580]  They can be found in grass fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[03:45:10.580 --> 03:45:16.900]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[03:45:16.900 --> 03:45:21.740]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[03:45:56.060 --> 03:45:57.820]  The globalists are only humans.
[03:45:58.140 --> 03:46:01.380]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can be
[03:46:01.380 --> 03:46:02.380]  defeated.
[03:46:02.380 --> 03:46:05.340]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[03:46:05.340 --> 03:46:09.460]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[03:46:09.460 --> 03:46:13.539]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[03:46:13.539 --> 03:46:17.140]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity fed filter out there.
[03:46:17.140 --> 03:46:19.340]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[03:46:19.340 --> 03:46:22.020]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through in a day.
[03:46:22.020 --> 03:46:26.300]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[03:46:26.300 --> 03:46:28.660]  This is what I use, this is what my family uses.
[03:46:28.660 --> 03:46:32.619]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price for a limited time, 10% off on
[03:46:32.619 --> 03:46:33.619]  top of that.

[03:46:45.539 --> 03:46:49.340]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from
[03:46:49.340 --> 03:46:51.939]  hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[03:46:51.939 --> 03:46:54.539]  In some cases they add the water supply like fluoride.
[03:46:55.500 --> 03:47:03.500]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.600 --> 03:47:16.520]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis, and
[03:47:16.520 --> 03:47:20.560]  I want to remind you guys to look for that Sammy the Bull Gravano interview that we did
[03:47:20.560 --> 03:47:24.320]  with Alex, and I was honored to be a fly on the wall and listen to that wild conversation.
[03:47:24.320 --> 03:47:28.480]  That'll be coming out in a couple weeks, and I want to remind you guys too that if you
[03:47:28.480 --> 03:47:34.640]  go to my channel, you'll see some links to Jamie Kennedy, the comedian from Scream, from
[03:47:34.640 --> 03:47:41.000]  Malibu's Most Wanted, we did a live show together in Los Angeles a couple weeks ago, and Jamie
[03:47:41.000 --> 03:47:45.820]  had us on his podcast, and it's over on his channel, the Jamie Kennedy channel on YouTube,
[03:47:45.820 --> 03:47:50.520]  so it's a really wild, funny talk, and a lot of people in Hollywood are getting red-pilled,
[03:47:50.520 --> 03:47:53.640]  so go and check that out over on Jamie Kennedy's channel.
[03:47:53.640 --> 03:48:00.400]  Today my guest is, as you guys know, Tim Gordon of Rules for Retrogrades, Rules for Retrogrades,
[03:48:00.440 --> 03:48:06.680]  I can't say my R's today, but Tim's got awesome books over there, and we're going to transition
[03:48:06.680 --> 03:48:10.600]  into the next segment, which actually ties into what we're talking about with religious
[03:48:10.600 --> 03:48:15.520]  manipulation and the new age world religion and so forth.
[03:48:15.520 --> 03:48:20.920]  Tim's kind of one of the pioneers out there writing about the resurgence of patriarchy,
[03:48:20.920 --> 03:48:26.960]  and although Tim has some great books, he doesn't have a book with himself on the cover
[03:48:26.960 --> 03:48:32.280]  with a marshmallow gun like Kurt Russell in Escape from New York, so you can get my
[03:48:32.280 --> 03:48:36.160]  book over at Jay's Analysis, Essays on Theology and Philosophy, as well as my two Hollywood
[03:48:36.160 --> 03:48:39.800]  books, sign copies in the shop at Jay's Analysis if you want to support the work I do.
[03:48:39.800 --> 03:48:42.960]  You can get Tim's books by going over to Rules for Retrogrades.
[03:48:42.960 --> 03:48:47.920]  Tim, look, I'm listening to this, I'm in the audience, I hear you guys talking about religious
[03:48:47.920 --> 03:48:51.840]  institutional subversion, and then I hear you talking about new world religion, what in
[03:48:51.840 --> 03:48:56.880]  the world does that have to do with feminism and patriarchy, how does that connect?
[03:48:56.880 --> 03:48:59.560]  Everything, literally everything.
[03:48:59.560 --> 03:49:07.880]  Christian masculinism is the true patriarchy, the true red pill for that matter, and it's
[03:49:07.880 --> 03:49:16.520]  literally, even for our Protestant brethren at the family reunion, the patriarchy means
[03:49:16.520 --> 03:49:17.520]  Christianity.
[03:49:17.520 --> 03:49:23.600]  Orthodox and Catholic know it's a bifurcated patriarchy, there's a clerical route, priests
[03:49:23.600 --> 03:49:30.400]  and bishops, and a laity, a lay route, most of us who have wives and families.
[03:49:30.400 --> 03:49:38.360]  But the point is this, Jay, the entire attack that these evil guys have been leveling on
[03:49:38.360 --> 03:49:46.680]  the church's center around what for us is the original sin, supplanting men with women,
[03:49:46.680 --> 03:49:48.680]  that's the original sin, Adam and Eve.
[03:49:49.000 --> 03:49:56.360]  Everyone out there think about this, how fundamental feminism is to the heart of all the isms,
[03:49:56.360 --> 03:50:01.200]  all the evil things that have ever killed human beings on planet Earth, in body and
[03:50:01.200 --> 03:50:02.200]  in soul.
[03:50:02.200 --> 03:50:03.200]  It's feminism.
[03:50:03.200 --> 03:50:07.960]  When Adam stood down, Eve stood up, right?
[03:50:07.960 --> 03:50:16.240]  And say John Chrysostom says, well, sorry ladies, but a woman was tricked by a beast, Adam then
[03:50:16.240 --> 03:50:22.080]  got sort of counter-tricked by a woman, but she's close to his equal, but a woman was
[03:50:22.080 --> 03:50:26.400]  tricked by a beast, that's how the serpent knew to go after the woman.
[03:50:26.400 --> 03:50:32.800]  So this is my book, The Case for Patriarchy, where we outline that all of this collective
[03:50:32.800 --> 03:50:42.680]  psyoping of the West in what I call third wave gender dysphoria, transforming, that's
[03:50:42.680 --> 03:50:49.560]  not the real game, and neither was second wave gender dysphoria, which is the L and
[03:50:49.560 --> 03:50:51.160]  the G and the B.
[03:50:51.160 --> 03:50:57.520]  The original gender dysphoria is the attack on Christian masculinism by the feminists,
[03:50:57.520 --> 03:51:02.600]  which took place really in the mid-1800s, 1848 is when there's something called the
[03:51:02.600 --> 03:51:08.400]  Seneca Falls Convention in upstate New York, where Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other Satanists
[03:51:08.400 --> 03:51:15.120]  like that, first wave feminists, I learned that from you and Rachel, first wave feminists
[03:51:15.120 --> 03:51:21.840]  got together and they outlined real feminism, line by line, it's the same year that Marx
[03:51:21.840 --> 03:51:27.280]  and Engels did their thing, of course, but let's back it up a second.
[03:51:27.280 --> 03:51:31.640]  First wave feminism, second wave feminism, third wave, it's a distinction without a difference.
[03:51:31.640 --> 03:51:36.200]  If you look at the lines of the Seneca Falls Convention memorialized by Elizabeth Cady
[03:51:36.200 --> 03:51:44.760]  Stanton in this document called Declaration of Sentiments, it's just recognizable 2023
[03:51:44.760 --> 03:51:45.760]  feminism.
[03:51:45.760 --> 03:51:51.680]  They want women in the clergy, they want women most of all away from children, because that's
[03:51:51.680 --> 03:51:56.640]  really how they take control of this, which is a huge part of the global elites you're
[03:51:56.640 --> 03:51:59.640]  talking about in the 1930s, 40s, 50s.
[03:51:59.640 --> 03:52:04.720]  They want women away from men, they want a war of sexes, and they want women in the workplace
[03:52:04.720 --> 03:52:08.280]  specifically, not just out of the home, but out of the home in the workplace, then the
[03:52:08.280 --> 03:52:12.680]  state will run the kids, like book five of the Republic says.
[03:52:12.680 --> 03:52:21.480]  But dig this, before I finish, when you trick a group of people that women can act like
[03:52:21.480 --> 03:52:28.480]  men and men can act like women, that's the original sin of Adam and Eve, then it's not
[03:52:28.480 --> 03:52:32.600]  such a big claim to say, well, women and men can act like one another in the bedroom, which
[03:52:32.600 --> 03:52:39.200]  is the L and the G and the B, and conceptually then, it's not such a leap to go to the third
[03:52:39.200 --> 03:52:44.680]  iteration of gender dysphoria, which is, alright, if a dude puts on a dress because he can act
[03:52:44.680 --> 03:52:50.000]  like it, then he can identify as a woman, ontologically.
[03:52:50.000 --> 03:52:51.000]  And guess what?
[03:52:51.000 --> 03:52:52.000]  Here's the real game.
[03:52:52.000 --> 03:52:57.560]  I convinced my friend Michael Knowles of this, and Matt Walsh over at the Daily Wire.
[03:52:57.560 --> 03:53:05.440]  The most destructive one, by 10 to the power of three, is the original, feminism, right?
[03:53:05.440 --> 03:53:08.080]  That's what influenced all of us root and branch.
[03:53:08.080 --> 03:53:16.720]  We were all raised in the matrix of the matriarchy, and it was filtered through our churches,
[03:53:16.720 --> 03:53:24.520]  and Vatican II verifies this, through the 20th century, through our governments, and
[03:53:24.520 --> 03:53:30.480]  we're not really that influenced, guys like you and I, by L or G or B or T, are we, Jay?
[03:53:30.480 --> 03:53:34.920]  But everyone I knew, even the half of my friends who didn't come from a divorced household,
[03:53:34.920 --> 03:53:39.840]  it was their mom running the household, and that's what messed everyone up.
[03:53:39.840 --> 03:53:43.280]  That's what allows evil to prevail in the world, and that's what was the original sin.
[03:53:43.280 --> 03:53:44.280]  I'm taking a broad view.
[03:53:44.280 --> 03:53:45.280]  What do you say?
[03:53:45.280 --> 03:53:50.760]  Yeah, I agree, and to bring it up to the 20th century in terms of power groups, power elites,
[03:53:50.760 --> 03:53:52.880]  there's a lot of admissions of this as well.
[03:53:52.880 --> 03:53:56.600]  That same authorized biography that I mentioned, The Rockefellers by Collier and Horowitz,
[03:53:56.600 --> 03:54:01.200]  there's a whole chapter, not just on the creation of a new world religion and the ecumenist
[03:54:01.200 --> 03:54:06.240]  movement, but there's a separate chapter that deals with the funding of feminism, particularly
[03:54:06.240 --> 03:54:07.880]  third-wave feminism.
[03:54:07.880 --> 03:54:12.600]  Abby Rockefeller gave a lot of money to that and really helped create things like CEL16,
[03:54:12.600 --> 03:54:18.320]  which was this radical communist Marxist feminist groups, and of course, absolutely, those movements
[03:54:18.320 --> 03:54:19.880]  typically coincide and go together.
[03:54:19.880 --> 03:54:25.040]  Again, you can go back to Blavatsky and her sort of pseudo-early feminist movements as
[03:54:25.040 --> 03:54:30.960]  well, and then you go back to, like Tim said, Mary Wollstonecraft, the French Revolution,
[03:54:30.960 --> 03:54:35.920]  also radical egalitarian feminists, and then to bring it up to the present day in terms
[03:54:35.920 --> 03:54:42.240]  of some of the mouthpieces of this, one of the psychonauts, Terrence McKenna himself, who
[03:54:42.240 --> 03:54:47.640]  worships the mushroom, why he talked to the mushroom, and the mushroom told him that the
[03:54:47.640 --> 03:54:51.520]  religion of the future will be the goddess to return.
[03:54:51.520 --> 03:54:57.240]  Literally, there's a whole chapter in Food of the Gods about the goddess being the religion
[03:54:57.240 --> 03:55:01.700]  of the future, and we see a lot of these psychonaut guys as well, just as another example, pushing
[03:55:01.700 --> 03:55:06.320]  this in the counterculture, the Aquarian Conspiracy, which is actually not a conspiracy text, for
[03:55:06.320 --> 03:55:11.840]  those that don't know, it's a Tavistock-created text by Marilyn Ferguson about how the world
[03:55:11.840 --> 03:55:17.440]  is going to change post-60s counterculture through the corporate world and the educational
[03:55:17.440 --> 03:55:20.560]  system adopting feminism.
[03:55:20.560 --> 03:55:26.320]  The book is about feminine attitudes being adopted across the social sphere, corporate
[03:55:26.320 --> 03:55:30.360]  world, legal world, Tim, you can probably speak to that.
[03:55:30.360 --> 03:55:35.960]  So would you say that this has basically taken over the institutions beyond the religious
[03:55:35.960 --> 03:55:36.960]  world as well?
[03:55:36.960 --> 03:55:37.960]  Of course.
[03:55:37.960 --> 03:55:44.920]  I mean, the religious takeover was actually last, because we have more of a doctrinal
[03:55:44.920 --> 03:55:50.160]  starch blocking than, you know, government.
[03:55:50.160 --> 03:55:56.360]  Military was one of the last ones to be infiltrated by the ladies, and sports is currently underway.
[03:55:56.360 --> 03:56:04.000]  But ironically, sports has given Christianity what I care about, Christianity a run for
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:10.360]  its money, Orthodox and Catholic are both being attempted to be overrun by women clerics,
[03:56:10.360 --> 03:56:13.160]  which is truly, truly evil.
[03:56:13.560 --> 03:56:15.680]  Yeah, it's sports, of all things.
[03:56:15.680 --> 03:56:20.480]  Yeah, I mean, I like sports, a lot of my fans and my viewers don't, they don't like the
[03:56:20.480 --> 03:56:23.800]  sports ball, but I do watch it, I do care about it.
[03:56:23.800 --> 03:56:27.280]  And if you don't care about it, you still ought to be able to care about this.
[03:56:27.280 --> 03:56:33.880]  It occupies a major section, lobbying section, special interest section in Agenda 2030.
[03:56:33.880 --> 03:56:34.880]  Why would that be?
[03:56:34.880 --> 03:56:38.920]  Isn't Agenda 2030 about ecology or some nonsense?
[03:56:38.920 --> 03:56:41.080]  It's a major section.
[03:56:41.080 --> 03:56:42.080]  It's culture war.
[03:56:42.080 --> 03:56:44.160]  We need women in sports.
[03:56:44.160 --> 03:56:51.320]  I have taken a shellacking so many times during an MMA fight, or sometimes during the Tyson
[03:56:51.320 --> 03:56:55.880]  Fury, Deontay Wilder trilogy fights, where they're putting women on the undercards.
[03:56:55.880 --> 03:56:57.680]  Why are they pushing this so hard?
[03:56:57.680 --> 03:57:02.160]  Why are they pushing the WNBA so hard, even though 27 seasons, it's never been in the
[03:57:02.160 --> 03:57:03.160]  black?
[03:57:03.160 --> 03:57:04.160]  Why are they pushing it?
[03:57:04.160 --> 03:57:05.160]  It doesn't work.
[03:57:05.160 --> 03:57:06.400]  These are businessmen, right?
[03:57:06.400 --> 03:57:11.600]  It's really important, because there's something called the female athlete triad.
[03:57:12.120 --> 03:57:15.920]  Women are getting so much testosterone that they stop having their periods.
[03:57:15.920 --> 03:57:21.880]  Women are getting so much testosterone that something like 98% of the WNBA is purportedly
[03:57:21.880 --> 03:57:30.360]  L. And this is important, because it not only propagates the culture wars, but it does so
[03:57:30.360 --> 03:57:37.160]  in a particular way where the family is going to be exploded, imploded from outside pressure.
[03:57:37.160 --> 03:57:39.160]  Why would that be in Agenda 2030?
[03:57:39.160 --> 03:57:40.160]  That's the end.
[03:57:40.160 --> 03:57:43.640]  Rules for Retrogrades is the channel, the site.
[03:57:43.640 --> 03:57:44.640]  And check out Tim's books.
[03:57:44.640 --> 03:57:46.960]  I'll have you back on, Tim.
[03:57:46.960 --> 03:57:51.840]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[03:57:51.840 --> 03:57:56.320]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all

[03:58:46.680 --> 03:58:52.960]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[03:58:52.960 --> 03:58:53.960]  the atmosphere.
[03:58:53.960 --> 03:58:56.840]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:58:56.840 --> 03:59:03.240]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[03:59:03.240 --> 03:59:05.400]  into fluorosilicic acid.
